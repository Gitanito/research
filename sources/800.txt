fice to a Work of this Nature.
Spedtre and Apparition make
a great Noifein the World ^^ and
have {at leaji formerly) had a great In--
fluence among us.
Between our Anceflors laying too much
firefs upon them^ and the prefent Age
endeavouring wholly to explode and de^
fpife themJ
the World feems hardly ever
to have come at a right Underflanding a^
bout them.
Some defpife them in fuch an extraor^
dinary manner^ that they pretend to wifh
for nothing more than to be convinced by
Demonfiramn j as if nothing but feeing

the Devil couldfathfie them there was
fuch a Perfon ^ and nothing is more won--
derful to me^ in the whole Syjiem of Spi-
rits, than that Satan does not think fit to
jujlify the Reality of his Beingy by ap-
pearing to fuch in fome of his worfl Fi*
gureSy and tell them in full Grimace who
he isy when I doubt not but they would
be as full of the Pannick as other People.
J^gainy fome People are fo horribly
fritted at the very mention of an ^ppa-
'
ritiony that they cannot go two Steps in
the dark^ or in the dusk of the Eveningy
^without koking behind them ,• and if they
fee but a Bat flyy they think of the Devil,
becaufe of its fVmgs 5 and as for a Screech
Owly at its firft appearancey they make no
fcruple of running into the Houfe in a
Frighty and affirming they have feen the
Devil.
How to bring the World to a right

'Temper between thtfe Extrearns is a Dif-
ficulty we cannot anfwer for ; but if fet-

a Hind of Aver/ion in the Minds of
Men to the Angel of Light, that no
body cares to fee him in Imagination^
much lefs to be forc'd to fee him whe^
ther they will or no.
But now on the other handy if it
is true that the Devil very rarely
does appear , that almofi all real Ap-
paritions are of friendly and ajjlfiing
Angelsy and come of a kind and bene^
ficent Errand to usy and that therefore
we need not be fo terrified at them a$
we are ; // it be true that when any
evil Spirit does appear^ it is limited by
a Superior Power^ and can do us no

APPARITIONS
INTRODUCTION.
Of Apparitions in General : the Certainty
and Nature of them.
F all the Arcana of the invifible World,
I know no One Thing about which.
I
more has been faid, and Jefs underflood,
J than this of Apparition : It is divided fo
^ much between the Appearance of good
and the Apparition of bad Spirits, that our Thoughts
are ftrangely confus'd about it.
First, We make a great deal of Difficulty to re*
folve whether there are any fuch things as Appa-
ritions or no J and fome People are for reducing
them all into Fancy, Whimfie, and the Vapours
j
and fo fliutcing the Door againll Apparitions in ge-
B neral,
The Hifiory and Reality
ncral, they refolve to receive no Vifits from the
invifible World, nor to have any Acquaintance
with its Inhabitants 'till they come there j Not
fatisfy'd with that, they refolve for us all, as well as
for themfelves, and will have it, that becaufe ihey
have no Notion of it themfelves, therefore there
is really no fuch thing, and this they have advanced
with great Aflurance, as well in Print as in other
Difcourfcs. I name no body.
I HAVE, I believe, as true a Notion of the Power
of Imagination as I ought to have, and you fhall
hear farther from me upon that Head 5 I believe we
form as many Apparitions in our Fancies, as we fee
really with our Eyes, and a great many more j nay,
our Inwginations fometimes are very diligent to
embark the Eyes (and the Ears too) in the Delufion,
and perfuade us to believe we fee Spcftres and Ap-
pearances, and hear Noifes and Voices, when in-
deed, neither the Devil or any other Spirit, good
or bad, has troubled themfelves about us.
But it does not follow from thence that there-
fore there are no fuch Things inNature> that there
is no Intercourfe or Communication between
the World of Spirits, and the World we live in;
that the Inhabitants of the invifible Spaces, he thofe
"where youpkafe^ have no Converfe with us, and that
they never take the Liberty to flop down upon this
Globe, or to vifit their Friends here 5 and in ihort,
that they have nothing to do with or fay to us, or
we with or to them. The Enquiry is not, as I take
it, whether they do really come hither or no, but
who they are that do come?
Spirit is certainly fomething that we do not
fully underftand, in our prefent confined Circum-
ftanccsjand as we do not fully underftand the thing,
fo neither can we diftinguiih of its Operations. As
we at prefent conceive of it, 'tis an unreftrain'd,
unlimited Being $ except by fuch Laws of the invi-
fible
of A?P ARlflONS.
fiblc State, which at prefent we know little ofj its
way of converfing wc kilow nothing of^ other than
this, that we believe, and indeed fee Reafon for it,
that it can ad in an invifibleand imperceptible man-
ner ^ it moves without being prefcrib'd or limited
by Space, it can come and not be feen, go and not
be perceiv'd j 'tis not to be fliut in by Doors^ or
fliut out by Bolts and Barsj in a Word, it is un-
confined by all thofe Methods which we confine
our A6tions by, or by which we underfland our-
felves to be limited and prefcrib'd.
Yet iiotwithftanding all this, it cortverfes here^
is with us, and among us j correfponds, tho' un^
embodied, with our Spirits which are embodied j
and this converfing is by not only an invifible, but
to us an inconceivable way > it is neither tied dowii
to Speech or to Vifion, but moving in a fuperior
Orb, conveys its Meaning to our Underftandings^
its Meafures to our Conceptions > deals with thei
Imagination^ and works it up to receive fuch Im«
prefiions as ferve for its purpofej and yet at thd
fame time we are perfeftly paffive, and have no A-^
gcncy in, or Knowledge of the Matter.
B Y this filent Converfe, all the kind Notices of
approaching Evil or Good are convey'd to us^
which are fometimes fo evident^ and come with
fuch an irrefiftiblc Force upon the Mind, that we
muft be more than ftupid if we do not perceive
them i and if we are not extremely wanting td
our felves, we may take fuch due Warning by
them, as to. avoid the Evils which we had No-
tice of in that manner, and to embrace the Good
that is ofFer'd to us : Nor are there many People
alive who can deny but they have had fuch
Notices, by which, if they had given due Atten-
tion to them, they had been affifted to fave them-
felves ft'om the Mifchiefs which followed} or had^
on the other hand^ taken hold of fuch and fuch
B ^ Ad^
The H'tftory and Reality
Advantages as had been offer'd for their Good : for
it is certainly one of the grand and moft impor-
tant Difficulties of human Life, to know whether
fuch or fuch things, which prefent in our ordinary
or extraordinary Circumftances, are for our good,
as they feem to be, and as may be pretended, or not,
and whether it is proper for us to accept them or
no 5 and many unhappily fland in the Way of their
own Profperity, for want of knowing what to ac-
cept of, and what to refufe.
Now by what Agency muft it be that we have
Direftions, for good or foreboding Thoughts of Mif-
chiefs which attend us, and which it is otherwifc
impoffible we fhould know any thing of 5 if fome
intelhgent Being, who can fee into Futurity, had
not convey 'd the Apprehenfions into the Mind,
and had not caufed the Emotion which alarms
the Soul?
And how fhould that intelligent Being (what-
ever it is) convey thefe Forebodings and fudden
JVlifgivings, as we rightly call them, into the Mind,
if there was not a certain Gorrefpondence between
them, a way of talking perfe6tly unintelligible to
us, uncommon, and without the Help of Sounds or
any other perceptible Way ?
Tor Sprits ^without the Help of Voice converfe,
A S thus there is a Gonverfe of Spirits, an Intel-
ligence, or call it what you pleafe, between our
Spirits embodied and cafed up in Flefh, and the
Spirits unembodied j who inhabit the unknown
Mazes of the invifible World, thofe Goafts which
our Geography cannot defcribej who, between So^iie*
'where and No-where dwell, none of us know where
^
and yet we are fure muft have Locality, and for
ought we know, are very near us; why fhould it
be thought fo ftrange a thing, that thofe Spirits
fhould
of APPARITIONS.
Ihould be able to take upon them an Out- fide or
Cafe? why ihould they not be able, on Occafion, or
when they think fit, to drefs themfelves up as wc
do a la Mafquerade^^ in a Habit difguis'd like Flefli
and Blood, to deceive human Sight, fo as to make
themfelves vifible to us ? As they are free Spirits,
why may they not be like what my Lord Rochefler
exprefTcs in another Cafe, > .
A Spirit free to chufe for their own Share
What Cafe of Flefh and Blood they pleafe to wear ?
Roch. Sat. againfiMan.
I do not by this affirm that it is fo, and that a
Spirit may thus aflume a real Cafe of Flefh and
Blood y for I refolve to affirm nothing that will not
bear a Proof, and to fuggeft nothing without Pro-
bability, in all this Work.
B u T it is enough to the prefent purpofe if thefe
invifible Inhabitants can affijme an Appearance, a
Form fufficient to make them perceptible to us;
at the fame time not being at all vefted with
any Subilance, much lefs of the Species which they
reprefent.
I F they can aflume a viflble Form, as I fee no
Reafon to fay they cannot, there is no room then to
doubt of the Reality of their appearing 5 becaufe
what may he we cannot but believe fometimes to
heen^ as what has been^ we are fure may be.
T o fay that the unembodied Spirits can have no-
thing to do with us, and that we have Reafon to
believe they are not at all acquainted with human
Affairs, is to fay what no Man can be afliired of,
and therefore is begging the Queflion in the grof-
fcll manner.
I SHALL therefore fpend but very little time to
prove or to argue for the Reality of Apparition,
Let Mr. Glanville and his Antagonifts, the Hohbifis
B ; and
^ The Hifiory and Reality
and Sadduces of thofe Times, be your Difputants
upon that Subjcftj nor fliall I trouble you with
much Antiquity or Hiftory: a little that is moft
unexceptionable may be neceffary. If there is an
inviiible World, and if Spirits refiding or inhabit-
ing are allowed to be there, or placed there by
the fuprcme governing Power of the Univerfe j it
will be hard to prove, that 'tis impoflible they
fhould come hither, or that they (hould not have
Liberty to ihow themfelvcs here, and converfe in
this Globe, as well as in all the other Globes or
Worlds, which, for ought we know, are to be
found in that immenfe Space j Reafon does not
exclude them. Nature yields to the Poflibility,
5ind Experience with a Cloud of Witnefles in all
Ages confirm the Reality of the affirmative.
The Queftion therefore before me is not fo
IDUch whether there are any fuch things as Appari-
tions of Spirits J but WHO, and WHAT, and
from WHENCE they are > what Bufinefs they
come about, who fends them or direfl:s them, and
how and in what manner we ought to think and
aft, and behave about them, and to them j and this
is the Subftance of this Undertaking.
The Angels are fa id to be mimftring Spirits^ and
we know they have been made ufe of (as fuch) on
many Occalions, by the fuperior Appointment of
him that created them \ why then it may not be
thought fit by the fame Power, to make or fubfli-
tute a Miniftration of thefc unembodied Spirits to
the Service of the embodied Souls of Men, which
arc alfo God's Creatures, we cannot telL
Upon what foot, and to what end, either on
their Side or on ours, and from what Appointment,
is very difficult to afcertain j and yet fomc probable
Gueffes might be made at ittoo,if it was the proper
Work before me> but I am rather adjufling the
Faft, and afcertainin.g the Reality of Apparitions ia
general^
of APPARiriO N S. 7
general, than inquiring into the Reafon^ of them
;
cither the Reafons in Nature, or in Providence,
which are perhaps farther out of our Reach than
fome People imagine.
I T is as difficult too to determine whether the
Spirits that appear are good or evil, or bothj the
only Conclufion upon that Point is to be made from
the Errand they come about 5 and it is a very juft
Conclufion, I think > for if a Spirit or Apparition
comes to or haunts us only to terrify and affright,
to fill the Mind with Horror, and the Houfe
with Diforder, we cannot reafonably fuppofe that
to be a good Spirit 5 and on the other hand, if it
comes to dire6b to any Good, or to forewarn and
preferve from any approaching Evil, it cannot then
be reafonable to fuppofe 'tis an evil Spirit.
The Story of an Apparition diflurbing a young
Gentleman, at or near Cambridge^ is remarkable to
this Purpofe: He fet up, it feems, for a kind of
profefs'd Atheifm j but hearing a Voice, fuppofed
it was the Devil fpoke to him, and yet owned that
the Voice afTured him there was a God^ and bid him
repent. It was a moft incongruous Suggeftion that
the Devil fhould come Voluntier to an Atheift, and
bid him repent; or, that the Devil fhould with a
like Freedom afTert the Being of a GOD.
I F then it was a real Apparition of, or a Voice
from an invifible Spirit 5 (Ifayi/", becaufe it might be
a Phantom of his own Imagination) itmuftbe from a
good Spirit, or from an evil Spirit over-rul'd by a
fuperior and beneficent Power ; and if that were to
be fuppofed, then it would juftify our taking far-
ther Notice of thofe things called Voices and
Apparitions, than I fhall venture to advife.
The PofSbility however of Apparitions, and the
Certainty of a World of Spirits, as I can by no
means doubt, fo I fhall take up none of your
time to anfwer the Objedions and Cavils of other
B 4 People
8 The Hijlory and Reality
People about it •, becaufc I think the Evidence will
amount to a Demonftration of the Fa6ts, and De-
monitration puts an end to Argument.
CHAP. I.
Of Apparitions in particular^ the Reality
of them^ their Antiquity^ and the 2)/^-
rence between the Apparitions offormer
TimeSf andthofe which we may call Modern ;
with fomething of the Reafon and Occafion
of that difference,
NOTHING can be a ftronger Tcftimony of
the Reality of Apparitions m General, than
to defcend to the particular Appearances which we
are aflur'd have been feen and convers'd with from
the fuperior World. And firft I begin with fuch
as have been evidently from Heaven it felf, and by the
foveraign Appointment of Providence upon extraor-
dinary Occafions. And tho' I fhall trouble my Rea-
ders with as little as poflible out of Scripture, ef-
pecially at the Beginning of my Work, becaufe I
am unwilling they fhould throw it by, before they
read it out, which there would be fome Danger of,
if I ihould begin too grave
!
Yet, as I cannot go back to Originals, or be-
gin at the Beginning, without a little Hiftory
out of thofe ancient Times, you muft bear with
my juft naming the Sacred Hiflorians. I'll be as
fhort as I can.
Nothing is more certain, if the Scripture is at
all to be believed among us, than that God him-
felf was pleafed, in the Infancy of Things, to ap-
pear Vifibly, and in Form, to feveral Perfons, and
oa
of APPARITIO NS.
on feveral Occafions, upon Earth j afluming or
taking up the Shape of his Creature Man, when
he thought fit to converfc with him, that he mighc
not be a Terror to him.
Thus jldam was frequently vifited in Eden^
and we have no room to doubt but it was in a
vifiblc Form, becaufe Mam both heard him fpeak,
and as the Text fays, I'hey heard the Voice of the
Lord God ^walking in the Garden in the Cool of the
Day. Gen. iii. 8.
B Y all the Hiilory of the Antediluvean World,
we have reafon to believe, that as God did fre-
quently fpeak to Men, fo he as frequently appear'd
to them •, for we find they converfed with God Face
to Face. C^/t/, tho' wicked, talk'd with God, and
God with him, when he was charg'd with the Mur-
ther of his Brother Ahehy and the Text is exprefs.
Gen. iv. \6. that after it, Cain went out from the
Prefence of the Lord. So that God not only fpokc
to him by a voice, but was Vifible and Prefent to
him.
And as I muft carry the Devil along with me,
hand in hand, in every Period of Time, To even in
Paradife the Devil aflum'd a Shape. For we muft
allow Satan to be a Spirit, and indeed, we have
good reafon to fay he is a Spirit^ free to Chuse
what Cafe of Flejh and Blood he pleafes to put on,
or at lead: feemingly to put on.
Thus he without doubt fpoke in the Mouth of
the Serpent in the Garden, or clfe took upon him-
felf that Shape, tho' the former is the moll: proba-
ble 5 becaufe the Serpent was curft for being but
the Inftrument, however paffive he might be.
Mr. MlftON makes no doubt of the Devil's
afluming a Shape of any kind, B^ajl as well as Man^
when he brings him in whifpering to Eve in her
Sleep, and placing himfelf clofe at her Ear, in the
Shape of a Toad, which he cxprefles in his Sub-
lime
lO The Hijiory and Reality
lime Poem, and with that inimitable Manner, pe-
culiar to himfelf.
First he brings Satan leaping over the Mound
or Fence, which God had placed round the Gar-
den, as a Wolf leaps over the Hurdles into a
Sheep-fold 5 and being gotten into Paradifc, he
places himfelf upon the Tree of Life, in the Shape
of a Raven or Cormorant, There's the Devil's iirft
Apparition.
Thence he views the whole Garden, and all
the Creatures in it, and at laft he fpies ^dam and
JEve, to his great Surprife. But after a while fpent
in admiring their Form, their Beauty, Felicity and
Innocence, as he refolv*d to ruin them, fo he comes
down from the Tree to be nearer themj and
mixing among the Cattle, where he takes upon
him now one Shape, then another, as it beft
fuited him, to be near j^dam and Eve^ and yet to
be unperceived by themj this the Poet defcribes
thus J
5n?en from his hfty Stand on that high Tree^
Down he alights among the fportful Herd
Of thofe four-footed Kinds y himfelf now one,
Now other, as their Shape hefi ferv'd his End
Nearer to view his Prey^ and unefffd
^0 mark what of their State he more might learn,
« -
• —^bout them round
j
A Lion now he fialks with fiery Glare -,
Then as a Tiger,
Milt. Parad. lib. IV. ver. 3pf.
Again, when he makes the Angels find Satan, as I
have obferved, whifpering evil Thoughts to Eve in
a Dieam, and in her Sleep, he fays.
mm
of APPARITIONS, ir
Him there they found^
Squat like a Toad, clofe at the Ear of Evej
AJfaying^ by his devilijh Art^ to reach
ne Organs of her Fancy^ and with them forge
Illujions^ as he Uft^ Phantafmsy and Dreams,
lb. ver.7pp,
'T I s evident then, that the Devil can aflume a
Shape, whether of Man or Beaft, and appear as
fuch, in order to dilguife himfelf from our Sight.
We ihall have a farther Account of him prefently,
but in the mean time let us fee higher, and go into
the After-Ages.
ABRAHAMIS the firft Example, ^ker Noah, ofan
open Converfe with his Maker j and the Scripture
diftinguiihes the very manner > fometimes 'tis faid,
that the Lord had/aid to Abram^ Gen. xii. f . and
again, the Lord /aid to Abram^ Gen. xiii. 14. again
Uhe tVord of the Lord came to Abram^ and the JVord
of the Lord came to Abram in a Fifton. Gen. xv. 1.4,
to the 7th.
But there are other expreis Places in which \t
is faid in plain Words, God appeared to him. Gen.
xii. 7. 'The Lordappear d unto Abram : and Gen. xvii. i.
The Lord appeared to Abram^ and [aid unto him : and
ver. 21. And he left off talking with him^ and God
went up from Abraham. 'Tis undeniable that God
appeared, and was with him, and left off talking
with him, and went from him : all Marks of a vifi^
ble Apparition.
Again, Chap, xviii. here it is ftill more ex*
plicit, and God not only appeared, but appeared
in a Human Shape. Ver. i . And the Lord appeared
td him in the Plains of Mamre^ as he fat in the.
Door of his Tent, Firil 'tis faid, he lift up his Eyes
and looked, and behold, three Men flood by him.
So vifible were they, that he entertains them,

It The H'tftory and Reality
invites them to Dinner, and prepares a fat Calf to
be drefs'd, and Cakes, and Butter, and Milk. In
fhort, he made a Feaftj fo much was he, as it may
be faid, deluded j fo real was the Appearance j nay,
when he fat it all before them, 'tis faid thy did
EAT.
Now, ver. 13. 'tis faid expreflyone of thefe was
the Lor Di nay, in the Original it is Jehovah j
that was when he charged Sarah with laughing,
and flie deny'd it.
N. B. Sarah was the firft of Human Kind,
that ever told God a Lye to his Face.
But fhe was frighted, that's certain i the
Text fays fo.
I N the 17th Verfe, when God tells Ahraham what
he had refolv'd to do to Sodom-, 'tis plain, he fpeaks
in the firfl Perfonas God j j^nd the Lord faid^ Jhall I
hide from jlhraham the thing that I do? Hereupon
Abraham takes upon him to plead with God in be-
half of Sodom 'y and in this he fpeaks as to God him-
felf, ver. 30. O let not the Lord he angry^ ayid I will
fpeak : and before that, ver. 27. Behold now I have
taken upon me to fpeak unto the Lor d, which am
hut Dtift and AJJoes.
Thus I think 'tis evident, that God himfclf
did appear in Humane Shape to Abraham^ and that
more than once. The next Chapter is as plain, that
he did the fame to L o t j or if it fhould be obje-
ded that it is not fo clear that it was God himfelf,
it was two Angels 5 tho' Interpreters do generally
agree, that it was Chrift himfelf, who is called
an Angel, the Angel of the Covenant. But ii that
were doubtful, then it will flill be allow'd thac it
was an Apparition of Angels in Human Shape,
which will itand good in my next Article.
But as I am upon the Higheft and Supreme
Inltances firft, I muft finifli it by two particular
Quota*
of APPARITIONS. 13
Quotations, which cannot be difputed. (i.) One is
of Jacobs Gen. xxxii. 24. fhere wreftled a man with
him: and ver. 28. the Man is faid to be God him-
felf, as a Prince haft thou Power with God, and haft
pre'vaird: and ver. 2,0, after he had bleiTed him,
Jacob caird the Place Peniel^ that is the Face of /
God. For, fays he, / have feen God Face to Face,
Again Jacob fays, Gen. xlviii, 7^, God Almighty ap-
peared to me at Luz in the Land of Canaan^ and blef-
fed me.
(2.) But there is yet a flronger Teftimony than
all this, for it is fpokcn from the Mouth of God
himfelf upon a very particular Occafion, which was
to honour Mofes^ and eftablifli him in the Reve-
rence and Regard of the People, when the Se-
venty Men or Elders were appointed to take Part
of his Work off his Hands, and judge of fmaller
Matters among the People j which is nobly cx-
prefs'd. Numb. xi. 17. i'hey ftoall bear the Burthen
6f the People with thee. In the next Chapter Miriam^
and even j^aron himfelf, fpake againft Mofes-y that is
in fhort rofe in Rebellion j and God, to honour his
Servant, tells them how he had, and would diftin-
guifh Mofes from all the reft. ver. 8. With him will
I fpeak Mouth to Mouthy even Apparently, and
not in Dark Speeches^ and the Similitude of the Lord
fhall he Behold.
Here is a pofitive Declaration from Heaven,
that God would appear vifibly to Mofes -^ the like
Inftance is not to be feen in the whole Bible. The
Word Apparently is plain, it can be no otherwife
underftood, without grofs Equivocating with the
Text.
Come we next to the Times of our Bleffed Sa-
viour, and there we have two eminent Appear-
ances within the Compafs of our prefent Argu-
ment.
I. The
f 4 'The Hifiory and Reality
1. The Holy Ghost appearing in the Shipd
of a Deve.
2.. The Appearance of Jesus Christ after his
Refurreftion, when in the glorify'd Body where-
with he afcended 5 and that this was an Apparition,
is plain, from the feveral Circumftances of his Ap-
pearance.
FIRST, When he join'd the two Difciples go-
ing to Emaus : that he appeared as a Man, the Text
is plain from his walking with them, and Difcourfe
10 them 5 and that it was but an Apparition is
alfo plain. Luke xxiv. i<S. Their Eyes wsre holden
that they JJjould not know him : and ver. 5 1 . when their
Eyes were opened to know him he vani(hed out of
their Sight.
SECQNDLT^ When he appeared to Mary Mag^
^^/^/^ at the Sepulchre, but forbad her to touch him,
John XX. 17. And again 'ver, ip. when he came
into the Room where the Difciples were aflembled,
and when the Doors were iTiuc, and faidj Peace h&
unto to you. Thus it is evident Chrift has appear'd^
and he has told us he ihall appear again^, coming
in the Clouds of Heaven j and we look for that
blefled Hope, and glorious Appearing.
Thus then you have God himfelf, Father^ Sort
and Holy Ghoft, appearing in difl:in6t Times, in fe-
veral Shapes or Forms of Appearance, all giving,
Teftimony in general to the Reality of this Truth,
That Spirits can afTume Humane or other Shapes,
and be made vifible to Mankinds and this is what;
v/e call Apparition.
Having thus brought an Inftance of the mod
exalted Kind, even the Appearance or Apparition
of God himfelf, 'tis needful to ftate a little the
Difference between thofe Appearances, and that
which we are now to difcourfe of.
'Tis an Objedion natural to the Cafe in hand^
We do not queftion, much lefs enquire, whether
infinite
of APPARITIONS. If
infinite Power, to whom all things are not pofllblc
only, but eafy, can aflume a Humane Shape, or any-
other j and appear, when^ where^ how^ and in
ivbat Forjn he thinks fit j and that he has- or may-
have fo appeared. But there is a manifefl Difference
between what God is able, or may pleafe to do up-
on extraordinary Occafions, and what any of his
Creatures may or can do.
Besides 'tis evident, or at lead wc have rea*
fon to believe, that God himfelf did appear in thofc
Times upon thofe extraordinary Occafions only,
and that he has never appear'd fince^ except that
fhould be call'd an Appearance or Apparition which
fpoke to St. Paul at his Converfion, when it is ex-
prefly faid, he faw a Light, and heard a Voice, but
faw no Man 5 tho* afterwards he calls it feeing him^
I Cor, XV. 8 .
Laft of all he wasfeen of me alfo. Wh ere*
as St. Paul^ we all know, did fpeak there of feeing
Chrift in the Flefli, while he was on Earth. But
I fay, except this, we have no Example of any
Appearance of the Divine Majefly in Humane
Shape, or in any other manner whatfoever.
That therefore we muft diftinguiih this from
the Subje£l we are now entering upon, for that the
Appearances of God are extremely different from the
Apparitions of Creatures, whether Angels, Devils,
or Souls of Men. That the Qucflion is nor. Whe-
ther God can do this or that> bur. Whether the Spi-
rits, Spirits Inferior, can do it : and, which is yec
more to our Purpofe, Suppofe it has been fo for*
merly, and in ancient times, whether they do con-
tinue to do fo flill, or have power to do ir, let
the Occafion be what it will.
Thus the Enquiry is reduc'd to a narrower
Compafs. I take upon me the Affirmative j and we
are now to look back into Time for the Confirma-
tion or Proof of it, and by enquiring what has been,
inform our felves of what may be, is, or is to be
cxpeded, as occafion may require. And
The Hijiory and Reality
And firft to defcribe the Thing, and expkin
what is generally underftood by the Apparition of
Spirits; that I may not hold you in Sufpence, or
Criticife upon the bare Words Spirit and ^ppari*
tion^ I come plainly to the Meaning, as I am to
be underftood in this Work : By Jpparition of Spi-
rits, then, 1 mean, when the Invifible Inhabitants
of the unknown World, be they who they will,
afllime Humane Shapes, or other Shapes, and fliow
themfelves vifibly to us, fo as that we can fee them,
fpeak to them, hear them fpeak, and the like.
This is what our People vulgarly qt^ Walkings
and when any fuch thing appears, they know not
what otherwife to call it, they fay Something walks ^
and if it be , the Appearance of any known Perfon
lately dead, they fay Such a one IValks.
Thus I lay every thing down with the utmoft
plainnefs, that I may leave the Reader in no Un-
certainty about my Meaning in the Subject I am
upon, or give room for CaviUngs or Difputings,
at either the Thing it felf, or the manner of Ex-
prefEng ti.

The Apparitions I am to fpeak of are thefe.

These are thofe, who we mean by the Inhabi-
tants of the Invifible World, or Worlds > the
World of Spirits, and the Superior Beings, who
are faid to converfc with the Spirits embodied,
by Vifion or Apparition, or any other Superior
Way.
By Apparition alfo I am to underftand fiich Ap-
pearances of thefe fuperior Beings as are Spontane-
ous and Voluntary, or at leafl fo far as relates to us 5
that is to fay, Idiftinguifh between thofe Apparitions
which appear of their own accord, or by fuperior
Miffion and Authority 5 and thofe which that dark
Race of People among us, who would becall'd Ma-
gicians, talk of5 Spirits, or things call'd Spirits, which
are raifed, as we foolifhly call it, by the Arts of Men j
by Witchcraft, Sorcery, Magick, and fuch other
Infernal Arts, as are, or have been made ufe
of for that Purpofej and by which they tell us Spi^
rits are call'd down from the fuperior Regions (of

ces, and to form Apparitions j and how far they

i8 The Htfiory and Reality
CHAP. II.
Of the Appearance of Angels immediately in
M'tffion as from Heaven ; and why we are
to fuppofe thofe kinds of Apparitions are at
an End.
THAT Angels have appeared to Men, wc have
abundant Teftimony in the Hiftories of
Times Pail, as well Sacred as Prophane j nor {hall
I fpend one Moment of your Time to examine, or
confirm it, except as it comes neceflarily in by
the occafion of other Difcourfe: For it is nouthe
Appearance of Angels as fuch, but the Appearance
of Angels in the Shape of Men, that is the prefenc
Enquiry.
That this has been, is evident, and in general
the Scripture gives this Teftimony to it: when the
Apoftlc advifes to Hofpitality, and to entertain
Strangers, he adds. For thereby fome have entertairCd
Angels unawares, Heb. xiii. z. This muft be meant
of Angels in Humane Shape, otherwife the hofpi-
table Perfon could not be miftaken in fuch a manner:
Befides, it plainly refers to Abraham^ Gen. xviii. i.
fitting in the Door of his Tent, ver. z. three Men
Itood by himj two of thefe were certainly Angels j
who the third was, I have (hewn already. It may
likewife include Lof, in whofe Story, Gen. xix. it is
exprefs'd, ver. i. that they were two Angels, and
'ver. 8. Lot calls them tbe/e Men, and ver. lo, 12,
16. they are called the Men-, fo that Lot believ'd
them to be Men only, and as fuch he not only in-
vited them unto his Houfe, ver. z. but he made
them a Feall, and they did cat, ven j.
These
of APPARITIONS.
These Apparitions of Angels, in the Shape of
Men, are undeniable on other Occafionsj but when
they appear as Angels, it is faid fo plainly, and in
fo many Words > as in the Cafe of Abraham^ when
he was going to offer his Son Ifaac^ Gen. xxii. 1 1.
*the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of Hea*
'ven J and again ver. i
f. ^he Angel of the Lord called
the fecond time.
There are innumerable Examples of Angels
appearing as Angels j but we are upon the Ap-
pearance of Angels as Men, and in the Shape and
Habit of Men. The next Inflance is, of an Angel
appearing to Jofhua^ and who is called the Captain
of the Lord's Ho{l,< JofJo. v. 13. Jofhua looked^ and
heboid there flood a Man over-againft him^ with a
Sword drawn in his Hand, Immediately JofJma^ Sol-
dier-like, gives him the qui vi've^ or in EnglifJj^ who
are you for? art thou for us, or for our Adverfaries?
and the Spe<5tre or Apparition fpoke immediately
again, ver. 14. and then Joflma perceived that it
was not a Man, but an Angel in Apparition 5 and
in the Heads or Contents of the Chapter, 'tis ex-
prefly faid, an Aiigel appears to Jofhua.
ANOTHERExample is, of the Angel that ap-
pear'd to Manoah the Father of Sampfon-y his Wife
indeed calls him a Man of God, and that he ap-
peared to her 5 but fays, that his Countenance was
like an Angel of God, very terrible 5 Judges xiii. <5.
But ftill when he appeared a fecond time, it was in
the Shape of a Man, or elfe why did Manoah de-
fire him to (lay 'till he could drefs a Kid for him ?
and the Words are exprefs, ver. 16. He knew not
that it was an Angel of the Lord,
There are other Examples in Scripture, where
the Angels have appeared in Humane Shape, and
convers'd with Men upon Earth, befides fuch as
have appear'd in their real Angelick Form as An-
gels. How and \\\ what they were known to be
C i Angels,
7he Hiflory and Reality
Angels, in what Form they have been feen, and in
wliat Voice they fpoke, is not difcover'd to us in
the Scripture. Some are of Opinion, that even
thofe Angels appear'd in the Shape of Men, and
cloathed as Men 5 as the Angel that met Balaam
with a flaming Sword in his Handj the Angels
which "Jacob faw afcending and defcending on the
Ladder 5 the Angels that fpoke to Zacharias in the
Temple, to the Virgin Mary in the Chamber,
and that fat in the Sepulchre after Chrift was rifen,
and asked the Difciples,'Z£;/j'j/y^^i: j^^ the Living among
the Dead? and fo in feveral Cafes: All that can be
anfwer'd is, that the Text callM them Angels, and
fo far we are not to doubt it j but I mull alfo al-
low, that they feem to me to have been in the
Figure of Men 5 as for thofe in the Sepulchre,
St. Luke fays exprcfly, they faw two Men in fhining
Garments, Luke xxiv. 4. and in the fame Chapter,
ver. 25. 'tis faid, they had feen a Vifion of Angels.
Thus far it relates to good Angels, fuch as
kave been feen on Earth in Apparition, but have
made fuch an Appearance by vertue of the fuperior
Million, as the Angel Gabriel^ who tells Zaoharias^
I am fent to /peak unto thee.
That thefe have upon many occafions been
feen in Humane Shape is evident j and tho' much
more time might be fpent upon the Proof, I think
'tis needlefsj indeed the Evidence is fufficient.
There is a Queflion dill remaining, relating
to this Part, (yiz) How comes it to pafs that all
this is ceafed, and that the Angels have done
coming, or are no more fent offuch Errands ? but that
all the Angels we have any Account of in thefc
Days, are of a worfe kind, and generally come
upon worfe Errands ? and which particular Obfer-
vation is the very reafon of our Doubts, whether
the Appearance of the other is real or not.
This
of APPARITIO NS. IX
This Queftion might be anfwer'd many Ways,
buc 'tis too grave, for the Times j and as we are
not writing Divinity, I fhall not load you with
jferious Points : The fhort Account of it is this :
IVe have now.^ more fure Word of Prophecy : (that
is) that lince the Preaching of the Gofpel, and
the Revelation of God by a written Word, there
is no more need of what the Text calls a miniftra^
tion of Angels, The Scripture is a daily Revelation,
and the Spirit of God, who is promifed to lead us,
is a daily Infpiration, there is no more need of
Vifion and Apparition 5 and this is that glorious Dif-
ference between the Revelations of thofe Days,
and thefe of ours, and the reafon of the Difference
between the Apparitions of thefe Times and of
thofe.
When I am fpeaking things ferious, I am to
fpeak very fhorc, that I may not fhock your rea-
ding 5 the Tafte of the Times happening at this Jun-
cture to lye another way : but my next Article per-
haps may make you amends, I mean the Appear-
ance of the grand Arch-Angel of all, and, as I fup-
pofe, the only Arch- Angel out of Heaven, namely
the Devil.
CHAP. Ill
Of the Appearance of the Devil ///
Humane Shape.
PRAY obferve, when I am fpeaking of the Ap-
pearance of the Devil, it is not to tell you
that he can and does appear among us at this
time 5 fo you need not look over your Shoulders
to fee for him, or at the Candles, to fee
C 3 if
12 The Hijiory and Reality
if they burn Blue, at leafl: not yet > 'tis time
enough for that by and by.
But I am examining now the matter of Fa£t
only, as (i.) Whether the Devil can appear here, yea
or no 5 whether he is allowed to come, that his Chain
reaches fo far, and that his Tether is long enough?
alfo, (i.) Whether he is ever fent or direded to
come, or that he comes of his own accord, and a-
bouthis own Bufinefs? And as all thefe will lead me
to enquire what has been 5 from thence we may
befl judge, what is, or may be.
That he has upon fpecial Occafions appeared
in former Times is certain, as well from Scripture as
ancient Hiftory, and a fmall Retrofpe6b will fatisfie
you in that Point. If it appears that he has been
here, then 'tis very probable his Chain is long e-
nough, and that he is allow'd the Liberty to come
fo far from Home. For we have no Authority to
fay, or to believe, that his Tether is fhorten'd, or
that he is more reftrain'd now than ever he was
before.
His cntring the Garden of God in the begin-
ning of Time, and the Havock he made there, the
turning Jdam and E^ve out, and even turning the
whole frame of Nature upfide down by his vile
Doings there j all this I have mention'd : But we
have more yet to fay of him 5 for he is ftill in Being,
and ftill the fame malicious Devil, the fame De-
ftroyer and Accufer that ever he was j the Flame of
Fire fet to guard the Garden, did not burn himj
the Deluge didn't drown him : Nor has Juftice
thought fit yet to take him into its Iron Hands,
tho' it will certainly do it at laft; and, as the Scri-
pture fays in another Cafe, his Damnation flum*
bereth not 5 for Juftice is truly reprefented
With Leaden Feet and Iron Hands^ to Jhow
It will be eertainy tho' it may he flow.
The
of APPARiriO N S. 13
The firft time we meet with the Devil's per-
fonal Appearance upon Earth, I mean after the •
Flood, is in the Story o^Job-y nor by all the Cal-
culations of Times, which the learned Chronolo-
gcrs of thofc Days have made, could that be long
after it j for Eliphaz the Temanite could not be far-
ther off than the Grandfon of Efau^ or thereabouts.
Gen. xxxvi. ii.
I N Job's Time, the Text fays that the Sons of
God came to prefent themfelves before the Lord^ and
Satan came alfo among them. So that it feems the Angel
of Light was drefs'd up like the Sons of G o d,
even in thofe ancient Days> and it is not likely that
this was the firft Time neither: Again, it feems
by the Text, that tho' God himfelf might know
Satan in that Difguife, yet the People, among whom
he came, did not know him.
The Anfwerlikewife which he makesto the Qiie-
llion, implies ftrongly, that Satan had been wonE
to walk among thofe Sons of God in Difguife long
before that > for when God fays to him, whence
comeft thou ? his Anfwer feems to be a kind of gene-
ral, 1 come from following my known Bufi-
nefs, my old Trade j doeft thou know I am a roar-
ing Lion, and doeft thou ask me whence I come?
Why, I come from feeking who I may devour,
ranging the World, going to and fro in the Earth,
and walking up and down in this Difguife, as thou
now feeft me, that I may do all the Mifchief I can.
God's Return again to Satan confirms it, as if
the Lord had faidj Well, Satan, then thou muft
have feen my Servant Job ? Haft thou confider'^d him,
tloat there is none like him in the Earth ?
The Devil makes an Anfwer that implies he
Icnew Job very well. Do 1 know him to be a good
Man! yes: But then I know him to be a rich Man
too : 'Tis an cafy thing for a Man to be honeft,
that is fo richj he can have no room for asking
C 4 more:
24 7/6^ Hijlory and Reality
more: What fhould he fteal for, or be a Knave for,
that is the richeil Man in the World ? What fhould
he covet, that has no room for Defire? But if thou
haft: a Mind to try his Honefty, and his Piety, his
Fear of thee, and his Hatred of Evil, blaft: his
Wealth, and take his prodigious Flocks and Herds
of Cattle awayj level him, bring him to be like
other Men in Riches, and reduce him to Beggary,
and then fee if he won't be like other Men in Crime >
nay, he'll be raging and furious, and curfe thee t9
thy Face.
This, tho' it may feem remote, is to my Pur-
popfe thus : it fhows that the Devil was no Stran-
ger among the People. He had walk'd up and
down in Difguife, fo as to know them all, and their
Circumfl:ance J He had been drefs'd up like one of
the reft in Human Shape, fo that he could not be
known from the very befl: of Men, no not from
the Sons of God.
Some are of Opinion, by the Sons of God there,
is meant the patriarchal Heads of Families, who had,
in right of Primogeniture, thePriefthood in Courfe,
and were the only Sacrificers at that Time, as Abra-
ham^ and as Job were \ fo that in fhort Satan has long
ago drefs'd himfelf in the Habit of the Clergy. BleS
us all! we hope he does not do fo ftill \ for if the
Devil fhould put on the Gown and Caflbck, or the
black Cloak, or the Coat and the Cord, and be
walking about the World in that Difguife now,
howeafilymay we be cheated, and miflake the Sons
of God for the Prince of Darknefs.^ and how
could we tell one from t'other ? But of that here?

C H A P. IV.
Of the Apparition of Spirits IJnembodied^
and which never were Embodied-^ not fuch
as are vulgarly called Ghojis^ that is to fay^
departed Souls returning again and a})pear-
ing vifibly on Earthy but Spirits of afiipe-
rior and angelick Nature ; with an Opinion
of another species,
THERE appears a Qiicftion here in the very
Beginning of the Debate, which will be ve-
ry hard to decide, and perhaps impoflible : How-
ever, that we may not ftumble at the Threfliold, I
will touch it as gently, and yet as clearly as I can.
The Queftion is this 5 Whether are there any Spirits
inhabiting the invifible World, which have never
yet been embodied, and yet are not to be reckoned
of the Species of Angels Good ox Bad?
B Y Angels Good and Bad, I fuppofc I may be eafily
underflood to mean what you all think you mean
when you fort or rank them into only two Kinds,
'VIZ, Angels or Devils \ in which vulgar and gene-
ral, not to fay fooliih way of exprefling it, I hum-
bly conceive the felf-wife World much millaken.
It is true it is a Speculation, and every one is at
Liberty to think for themfelves, and among them
fo am I > in which, tho' I have a better Opinion
of my own Judgment than always to facrifice it to
vulgar Notions, and that too at the Price of my
Reafonj yet I have withal fo little Pride, and fo
mean an (Opinion of my own Thoughts, that 1 fhall
not venture to advance any thing, in a Cafe fo ex-
ceedingly liable to Cavil and Exception.

The learned Expofitors and Annotators ex-
tremely differ upon the Meaning of thefe Texts,
and 'tis not my Bufinefs here to reconcile them.
Some will have it to mean nothing but a kind of
an Exclamation or Admiration j What can it be
!
is it an Angel ! And of the firft, about Children,
they fay it only intimates, that their Souls, when
glorify'd, ihall always^ if they go away in Peace,
behold the Face of GO D in Heaven.
Others run out to an imaginary Scheme of
Guardian Angels attending every Man and Woman
while they are upon Earth > a Notion fo uncertain,
if granted, and that has fo many Difficulties to re-
concile, before it can be believed, that 'tis much
better to leave it where it is, and which I fhall ex-
plain prefently a much eafier Way.
N o w, I fay, 'tis not my prefent Bufinefs to re-

think it poffible, and that it is Rational to believe it 5
perhaps I may name you as improbable a Notion,
and much more inconfiftent with the Chriftian
Religion, which yet Philofophy bids us call rational,
and diredts us to believe.
How are we put to it to form Inhabitants for

the very Soul (if that were poflible) and fo are not habi-
table on that Account j that Mercury and Venus are
infufferably hot, that the very Water would always
boyl, the Fire burn up the Vitals j andthat,inniort,

But this is not fatisfa6tory neither > but rather than
not have all thofe opaac Worlds be inhabiied, and
even their Satellites or Moons about them too, they
will have God be obliged to create a Species of Bo-
dies fuitable to their feveral Climates.
I N Saturn they are to live without Eyes, or be a
Kind fo illuminated from their own internal Heat
and Light, that they can fee fufEciently by their
own Beams.
In Jupiter there muft be another Kind, that can
live in Twilight, and by the Refleftion of its own
Moons, and fubfift in continued Froft.
In Mercury the Species muft be all Salamanders,
and live in the continued Fire of the Sun's Beams,
more intenfe than what would be fufficient to burn
all our Houfes, and melt our Copper, Lead, and
Iron in the very Mines 5 fo the Inhabitants muft be
of a Kind better able to bear the Fire than thofe
Metals, and would ftill live tho' they were continu-
ally calcining if not vitrifying into Giafs.
I N Fenus the Heat would boil the Water, and con-
fequently the Blood in the Body, and a Set of hu-
man Bodies muft be form'd that could live always
in a hot Bath, and neither fweat out their Souls,
or melt their Bodies.

of our Species. Now
The Hiftory and Reality
'
N ow if God muft not be fuppofed to have crea-
ted fo many habitable Bodies without peopling them,
and that it would refle6t upon his Wifdom to lay
fo much of his Creation walte 5 that all the Planets
fhould feem to be made for nothing but to range
about the Wafte as a kind of dark Inhabitants 5 of
no ufe but to fhine a little, and that with but bor-
row'd Beams too, upon this little Point called
Earth, where only a Set of Rationals can exift 5 I
fay, if this muft not be fuppofed, but on the con-
trary there are certainly People of one Kind or
another in all thofe Bodies, let the Trouble of ma-
king them be what it will; if this be the Cafe,
and that this muft be believed in fpight of fo ma-
ny Difficulties and Inconfiftencies 5 then allow mc
to argue a little upon the following Enquiry.
Why may I not as well fuggeft, and that with
every jot as much Probability, that there are, or at
leaft may be, a certain Number of appointed Inha-
bitants in the vaftly-extended Abyfs of Space, a
kind of Spirits (other than the Angels good or bad,
and other than the unembodied or uncafed Souls of
Men) who dwell in the invifible World, and in the
Vaft No'where of unbounded Space, of which wc
can neither fay what it is, what it contains, or how
determined : That Great Wafte, of whofe Extent
'tis hardly poffible even the Soul itfelf can conceive,
and of which all the Accounts we give, and Guefles
we make, are fo remote, look fo Enthufiaftic, fo
improbable, and fo like impoflible, that inftead of
informing the ignorant Part of the World by it,
we only arm them with Jeft and Ridicule, and re-
folve them into incurable Unbeliefj depending that
what it is not poffible to Conceive of, is not poffi-
ble to Be.
Now is this immenfe Space indeed a Void? is it
all a Wafte? is it utterly defolate? or is it inhabited
and peopled by the Omnipotent Maker, in a manner
fqited
of APPAR ITIONS.
fuited to his own Glory, and with fuch Inhabitants
as are fpirituous, invifible, and therefore perfedly
proper to the Place?
1 MUST needs fay, 'tis much more rational to
fuggeft this to be, than to bring out a Species of
human bodies to live in the Intenfe Heat of Mer-
cury^ or the acute Cold of Jupiter and Saturn. The
latter is agreeable to the general Underftanding
we all have of fpirituous Beings : We* are well af-
fured there are feme always there, and* that they
can very well fubfiil there 5 that the Place is fuit-
able to them, and that there arc Spirits of fome
Kind or others and why not fuch as we fuggeft ?
It remains then only to examine what Commu-
nication thefe Spirits have with us, whether they
are or are not able to hold Converfation with us,
and whether they really do converfe familiarly with
us, yea or no?
I F it ihould be granted that there are fuch Spi-
rits in Being, and that they pafs and repafs, exift,
and have Egrefs and Regrefs there 5 that they inha-
bit, as a certain bombaitic Author has it,
'Thro' all the liquid Mazes of the Sky ;
I fay, if this fhould be granted, then it remains
that here is a fourth Species that may aflume Shapes
5
for Spirits may do that, and may appear among us,
may converfe with our embodied Spirits, and from
thofe we may receive abundance of additional In-
telligence from the World of Spirits, whether by
Dream, Vifion, Appearance, or any fuperior way,
fuch as to them in their great Knowledge of things
Ihall feem meet. To fpeak as diftin6fcly of this nice
Part as I can, admit me to explain my felf a little.
If we grant that Spirit, tho' invifible in it felf,
may aflume Shape, may veft it felf fo with Flefh
and Blood, that is feemingly, fo as to form an Ap-
pearance,
3^ The Hijlory and Reality
pearance, then all Spitic may do itj fince wc have
no Rule given us by which we may diftinguiih
Spirits one from another, I mean as to their a6t-
ings in the Capacity of Spirits : Wc may indeed,
as I have faid already, diftinguifh them by the Ef-
fed, that is to fay, by the Errand they come on,
and by the manner of their Operations, as whe-
ther they are good or evil Spirits j but not by
their Nature as Spirit. The Devil is as really
a Spirit, xho' a degenerated, fallen, and evil
Spirit, I fay, he is as much a Spirit to all the In-
tents and Purpofes of a Spirit that wc are capable
to judge of, as an Angel j and he is called the evil
Spirit > He has Invilibility, and Multiprefence,
as a Spirit has j he can appear tho' the Doors be
{hut 5 and go out, tho' bolted and barr'd in> no
Prifon can hold him, but his laft eternal Dungeon ^
no Chains can bind him, but the Chains faften'd
on hina by Heaven, and the Angel of the bottom-
Icfs Pit J no Engine or human Art can wound him j
in {hort, he is neither to be feen, felt, heard, or
underftood, unlefs he pleafes > and he can make him-
felf be both feen and heard too, if he pleafes j for
he can affumc the Shape and Appearance of Man
or Beaft, and in thefe Shapes and Appearances can
make himfelf vifible to us, terrify and affright us,
converfe in a friendly or in a frightful manner
with us, as he thinks fitj he can be a Companion
and Fellow-Traveller in the Day, an Apparition
and a horrible Monfter in the Night : in a Word,
he can be among us, and a6t upon, and with us,
vifibly or invidbly as he pleafes, and as he finds
for his purpofe.
Now if he does, and can do thus, meerly as he
is a Spirit, and by his fpiritual Nature, we have
a great deal of Reafon to believe, that all Spirit may
do the fame 5 or at leaft I may ask. Why may not
all Spirit do the fame ? and if there are any Kinds
of
of APPARITIONS. 31
of Spiritjas is not improbable, befides thofe we have
hitherto conceiv'd of, they may be reafonably fup-
pofed to be vefted with the fame Powers, ani may
exert thofe Powers in the fame or a hke manner.
I F any Man asks me how I make out the Pro-
bability of thefe differing Species of i>pirits? I an-
fwer as above, by this. That it appears there are
invifible Operations and a fecret Converfe carried
on among Men from the World ofSpirits, where-ever
that is, which cannot, at leafl to our Underftandings,
be fuppofed to be the Work either of thofe particular
or proper Angels which refidc in Heaven, or the in-
fernal Angels either 5 that thefe Spirits, or if you pleafe
to call them Angels, appear and converfe for Good,
and therefore may not be fuppofed to be the De*
*z;/7,or from theZ)m/; It is faid indeed, that they a6b
by a vifible kind of Reftrainr, in doing Good with
afort of anlmperfeftion and manifeft Debility 5 foas
fometimes to aft, as it were, to no purpofe, being
not able to make the Good they aim at effedual,
and therefore cannot be from Heaven, the Foun-
tain of Good ; who, as he is Good, fo he is in-
finitely able to do all the Good that be appears
willing to do; But this, I think, confirms rather
than confutes my Opinion 5 for, it proves them to
be fent, and under particular Commiffion ; it only
fuggefts, that 'tis probable there are Spirits who
may be more confin'd and reflrain'd in their Power
of adting, fome than others, and this is not at all
jnconfiftent with the Nature of the thing.
The great, and perhaps the ftrongeft Argu-
ment which our learned Men produce for the
Credit of their new Philofophy is, that by this
they can the better folve the Difficulties of feve-
ral other Phoenomena^ which before were hardly
intelligible, or at lead which they could not ac-
count for any other way.
In
3 2 The Hijlory and Reality
I N like manner, tho* the Certainty of my Sug-
geftion cannot be arrived to, or fuppofing it can-
not, and that at bell it is but a Speculation,
fcarcely can be called an Hypothefts^ and that no
Evidence can be given for it, yet this mud be faid of
»
it, that by this Notion we may folve feveral other
Difficulties which we cannot underftand any other
Way: fuch as^
FIRSTj How it is, and from whence, or by
whofe Agency we frequently receive fuch kind No-
tions of Good or Evil as 'tis certain we do, and
yet without receiving any farther Affiftance, which
perhaps it is not in the Power of the kind Infor-
mer to give us, either for the avoiding or embracing
the Evil or the Good which they give us No-
tice of?
What can it be that communicates thefe ap-
proaching diftant things, and which it is fo much
our Intereft and Concern to know ? If it were an
evil Spirit, I mean a Devilj as 1 have faid above, he
would never concern himfelf fo much for our Bene-
fit, feeing he is known to will our Ruin to the ut-
moll of his Endeavour, and to wifli us to fall into
all poffible Mifchief and Difailer.
O N the other hand, it cannot be from Heaven
or from the Angels > for the Works of God are all,
like himfelf, perfed, and he would not fo far difho-
nour his Meflengers, as to allow them, nay to fend
them (for they could never come unfent) to give
us Notice of Evil, and yet take it out of our Power^
to avoid it 3 or to foretell good things at hand, and
then give us no Power to embrace them, or to lay
hold of them i
and it would neither confift with
the infinite Goodnefs, or with the infinite Juftice,
to do thus by his Creatures.
Besides, 'tis a kind of incongruous a6ting, un-
worthy of the fupreme Power, unworthy an An-
gel's appearing s it rather fhews that it is the Pro-
4 dud
of APPARITIONS. 33
duft of fome intelligent Being, who tho* it means
Good, and has a beneficent Nature that would
contribute to our Safety and Profperity if it could^
yet is under fome Limitations of its aftings, is not
able to proceed in the Good it has attempted, that
can juft do us fo much Service as to give us Notice
of what may await us behind the dark Curtain of
Futurity 5 but has no Power to go any farther, 01^
to give'any AfSftance to us in purfuing proper Me-
thods for our Deliverance 5 no, not fo much as to
give Diredions, much lefs Powers to ad j as
a Child difcovering a Fire begun in a Houfe,
may cry out and alarm the Family, but is able to
do no more, no not fo much as to tell them where*
about it is, or which way they fhould go about to
efcape from it, much lefs to quench or prevent it.
These imperfe6b Notices, I fay, feem to proceed
from fome good and kind Being, which is near us^
exifling, tho' out of our Knowledge, yet not fd
remote, but that it is in Condition to fee and
know things good or evil, which tho' approaching^
is yet out of our View, and which, if we could
take the filent Hint, it might be infinitely for out ^
Advantage, but is able to do no more*
Now, if fuch Notices, whether to the Mind
by Dreams when afleep, or by waking Im^ulfe, or by
Voice, or by Apparation > if they were from Heavea
they would never be fo imperfeft and unaffiftingj
we cannot fuppofe Heaven would concern irfelf to
give us Notices of Danger impending, of Enemies
lying in wait, of Mifchiefs approaching, and would
then leave us to fall into the Snare by an unavoid-
able Neceflity.
As to what thefe Spirits therefore are, where
they refide, what Circumftances they are in, and
how they have accefs to our Underltandings, I ac-
knowledge the Difficulty to be great, and do not pre*
tend to enter upon it here 5 that they may fometimes
appear is not improbable: But I hope I may fay,
D that
J 4 The H'tfior^ and Reality
that all Apparitions arc not the Devil^ nor yet may
they be Angels immediately from Heaven, for ma-
ny Reafons.
FIRST', From theMcanncfs of the Occafions, I
mean of fome of the Occafions, on which thefe
things happen. That there are Angels fent from
Heaven on particular MefTages and Errands, to ful-
fil the Mind and Will of their Maker and Sove-
reign, all Men muft grant j I have already prov*d it,
and abundance of Examples may be given of it, be-
fides thofe already named } but we never find thofe
Angels coming upon trifling Errands, and for things
of mean Import, 'the j^ngel of the LO RD appeared
to Gideon at the Threfhing- floor, to fummon him
to the Deliverance of the whole Nation of ISRAEL :
^he Jngel of the LO RD appeared to David with
his drawn Sword, threatning Deftruftion to Jeru-
falem : The Angels appear'd to the Shepherds to fig-
nify the Birth o£ CHRIS f-y as an Angel had done
to the Virgin to falute her, and tell her what great
a Work was to be wrought in her : Angels ap-
pear'd to minifter to CHRIST' after his Temp-
tation in the Wildernefs> and an Angel appear'd
flrengthening him in his Agony, and Angels have
appear'd on m.any oiher fuch eminent Occafions;
but not except fuch Occafions were eminent, and
that particularly fo.
But here you have an old Woman dead, one that,
it may be, has hid a little Money in the Orchard or
Garden; and an Apparition, is fuppos'd, comes and
difcovers it, by leading the Perfon it appears to,
to the Place, and making fome Signal that he
fhould dig there for fomewhat ; or a Man is dead,
and having left a Legacy to fuch and fuch, the
Executor does not pay it, and an Apparition comes
and haunts this Executor 'till he docs Juftice. Is it
likely an Angel fhould be fent from Heaven to find
out the old Woman's earthen Difh with thirty or
forty Shillings in it ? or an Angel fhould be fent to
harrafs
of APPARn IONS. 3;
harrafs this Man for a Legacy of perhaps fiv^e or
ten Pounds? and as to the Devil^ will any one charge
Satan with being follicitous to have Juftice done ?
they that know him at all, muft know him better
than to think fo hardly of him. ,
Who then muft it be? and from whence? To
fay it is the Soul or Ghoft of the departed Perfon,
and that he could not be at reft, 'till the injur'd
Perfon be Righted, is advanced upon no PrincipJe
that is agreeable to the Chriftian Doftrine at all;
for if the Soul is happy, is it reafonable to believe
that the Felicity of Heaven can be interrupted
by fo trivial a Matter, and on fo flight an Occafion?
if the Soul be unhappy, remember the great Gulph
fix'dj there is no room for us to believe that thofc
miferable Souls have any Lcifure or Liberty to come
back upon Earth on an Errand of fuch a Nature.
In a word, there is nothing but Difficulty in it on
every fide : Apparitions there are, we fee no room
to doubt the Reality of that Part j but what, who, or
from whence, is a Difficulty which I fee no way to
extricate our felves from, but by granting that there
may be an appointed, deputed fort of ftationary Spi*
rits in the invifiblc World, who come upon thefe Oc-
cafions, and appear among us i which Inhabitants or
Spirits (you may call them Angels if you pleafc) Bo-
dies they are not, and cannot be, neither had they
been ever embodied 5 but fuch as they are, they have a
Power of convcrfing among us, and particularly wi^h
Spirits embodied, and can by Dreams, Impulfes and
llrongAvcrfions, move our Thoughts, and give Hope,
raife Doubts, fink our Souls to-day, elevate them
to-morrow, and many ways operate upon our Paf-
fions and Affe6i:ions } may give Intimations of Coed
or Evil 5 but cannot, thro' fomc unknown Reftraint
upon their Power, go any farther, fpeak any plainer,
or give the leaft Affiftanceto us, no, not by Gouuqil
or Diredion to guide us or cell us hgw to ad forour
own Prcfervation. D z I
^6 The Hiflory and Reality
I A M told that thefe may be good Angeh for all
that, and that it is no juft way of arguing, to fay
fuch things are too trifling to fend an Angel from
Heaven upon fo mean an Errand, and upon fo in-
coniiderable an Affair j fince we fee Providence
daily giving Teftimony, not of its Government
only, but of its Care and Concern, in and about
the meaneft Affairs of Life: and that the Scri-
pture it fclf frequently gives Examples of it, in his
feeding the Ravens, taking care of the Sparrows,
clothing the Grafs of the Field, numbring the
Hairs of our Head, t3c. So that Infinite is not li-
mited or ty'd up, to or from any degree of afting.
Nor is there any thing great, or any thing fmall, but
as God is feen in his leaft Creatures, Infefts, Mites,
and the likej fo he is aftive in the moft trifling
Event: Nor does that Providence, who yet pro-
tedts us in, and delivers us from Danger, always a6k
alike, but as the Sovereignty of his A6tings is not
to be difputed, fo neither is his Wifdom impeach'd
by fuffcring Evil to fall upon Man, which the
leaft hint from his Light might have guided him
to prevent.
I THINK this is the utmoft that can be faid in
the Cafe, and yet it does not reach us at all 5
for this is not the meaning of my Objection, no,
nor is it the Subftance of it > I am not fpeaking of
Providence concerning it felf in the Care of its
Creatures, I acknowledge all that 5 but then this Pro-
vidence a6ls in its own Way, and by its own invifi-
ble Operations 5 nor is rhtre any occafion for the
Agency of fuch extraordinary Inftruments, and
therefore it may be, that Angels are never fent as
ExprefTes upon fuch Things.
The King or Government of a Nation may in-
fluence the whole Body of the People, at what-
ever Diftance, by the Power of his Laws, direfting
the Magiflrates, and the Inferior Officers, to aft in
the
of APPARITIONS. 37
the Name of the Supreme > and this is done with-
out any Step out of the ordinary way of the Admi-
niftration. But if any extraordinary Occafion re-
quire, then a Meflenger is difpatch'd with particu-
lar Inftruftions, and fpccial Power, as the particular
Cafe may require.
So Providence, (which is, in a word, the admini-
ilration of Heaven's Government in the World)
ads in its ordinary Courfe, and in the ufnal Way,
with an univerfal Influence upon all Things, and
nothing is below its Concern > but when extraordi-
nary Things prefent, then th? particular exprefs
MefTengers from Heaven, {viz. the Angels) are fenc
with Inilruftions on that particular Affair which
they are difpatch'd about, and no other. And I may
venture to fay, thefe are never fent upon Trifles,
never fent but on extraordinary Occafions, and to
execute fome fpecial Commiflionj and this comes
dire£tly to the Cafe in hand.
I N the next Place I demand, when cou'd it be
faid, or what Example can be given, where an
Angel from Heaven has been fent to give any par-
ticular Perfon Notice of approaching Dangers, and
at the fame time left the Mind unalarm'd, and in a
ftate of Indolence, not capable of rouzing it felf
up to fhun and avoid the Danger threaten'd, or
•without Direction and Affiftance to prevent or ef-
cape it J this is what I alledge is unworthy of the
Divine Wifdom and Goodncis.
Look into all the Meflages or Notices that have
been given from Heaven on fuch Occafions, in all
the Hiftories of the Scripture, or almoft elfewhere,
and you will fee the difference evidently. Take a few
for Example.
Two Angels are fent to Sodom, not only to de-
ftroy the City for its Wickednefs, but to fave Lot.
Well, they come to him, they tell him what they
are about to do, and that they are fent to do itj
D 3 namely.
3? The Bijiory and Reality
namely, to burn the City. This might have been
enough 5 and perhaps, had it been noric'd to him by
the Spirits I am fpeaking of, this had been allj and
if Lot had not taken their kind Information, it had
been his own Faulty nay, as it was, the Text faysj
Lot lingered, and 'tis plain he left the City with a
kind of Relufbance.
But the kind McfTengers do not fatisfie them-
felvcs with giving him the Warning, but they roufe
up his Indolence. See Gen. xix. li. Hafi thou any
here ? any that thou haft a Refpe61: for, or Intereft
in, bring them out of this Place, vcr. 13. fVe will
dejiroy this Place. There's a hint of the Danger
approaching, and which is a wife Diredion what
to do, but this does not fatisfie: the Man is
not barely caution'd, and dire6ted, but he is to be
fav'dj and therefore the beneficent Hand is not
content to allarm and counfel him j bur, ver. if.
fVhen the Morning arofe they hajien'd L o t 5 they
flirrcd up his uncoiicern'd Temper, Arise, leji
thou be confum'd in the Iniquity of the City\ and even
this being not enough, for Lot linger'd ftill,and, as
Ifaid,feem'd loth to leave the Places they as it were
dragg'd him outj n^er. \6. they laid hold of his
Hand, and upon the Hand of his Wife, and upon
the Hand of his two Daughters, and brought him
forth, and fet him without the City 5 and what is
the reafon of all this? the Words are exprefs, the
Lord being merciful to him.
The reft of the Story is well known: when
they had brought him forth, they let him know he
would not be iafe even there j but adds, Efcape
for thy Life, look not behind thee: Nay, he tells
him whither he (hould go, 'ver, 17. Efcape to the
Mountain left thou be confum'd. Here was a Mef-
ilige like a Work of Heaven \ here was the War-
ning of Danger, and Dircdions to take proper
Meafures for Deliverance, and thofe Meafures poin-
ted

ted out fven to the very Place where he ihould be
fafe.
Take another Place exaftly like this. Matt,
ii. i;. An Angel is fent to Jofeph in a Dream, to
warn him of the Danger attending the Holy Infant,^
then in the Virgin Mother*s Arms: the Words are
exprels j Herod will feek the young Child to deftroy
him: Does the blelTed Notice leave Jofeph to flcep
on, to fay 'tis nothing but a Dream ? 1 don't fee
any Danger, I believe there's nothing in it 5 as is
our Language often on fuch Occafions. No, no 5
This MefTagc was from Heaven, who never gives fuch
Notice of Evil, and then leaves us unallarm'd, undi-
rected, fupinc and eafie, 'till it falls upon us without;
Remedy i the Angel adds prefently. Arise and
take the young Child and his Mother, and flee into
iEgypt, and be thou there ''till I bring thee Word.
Thus you fee the Nature of the Divine Pro-
ceedings, the effcftual manner of Notices from
Heaven j the Danger is told, and then the Way to
avoid iti and always with a hailing Allarm, Up,
get thee out of the City j Arife, flee into jEgypty
and the like.
A N o T H E R isin the Story o£ Peter in the Prifon :
an Angel is fent to deliver him, ^^ixii. and what does
the /ingel do? a Light fhin'd in the Prifon, and he
fmote him on the Side> this was to awaken and
alarm him^ this, and a Light to fhow; him the
Way, was fiaiEcient to have put him upon trying
to efcape. But the Angel did not come fo far to
do his Work by Halves, but having avvak'd him
he goes on with his Work, and to perfcd his De-
liverance > Arise q^u i c k l y Peter, and rais'd
him up, and then made the Chains fall off from his
Hands.
Nor yet had he done 5 gird thy felf, fays the
Angel, and hind qji thy Sandals, or as we would fay,
put on your Shoes; iftill Peter was at a lofs what to

40 The Hifiory and Reality
do; then the Angel adds, cafi thy Garment ahout
thee^ and follow me. Then he leads him through all
the Wards, and opens the Iron Gate for him, and
never left him 'till he had brought him out into the
Street 5 nay, through one Street, that the Keepers
(hould not know which way to purfue him.
This was an Appearance or Apparition to th6
Purpofej and fuch have been all thofe Tranfaftions
of Heaven, which have been under the Hands of
cxprefs McfTengers. You fee all thefe three were
done by Angels fent on purpofe j Feter exprefles it
in fo many Words, Afts xii. ii. Now I know of a
furety^ that the Lord has. fent his Angela and hath
delivered me.
Now let us fee how it has far'd with thofe who
have received Notices of approaching Danger from
the invifible World, by the Hands of other Mef-
fengers.
JULIUS CMSJR had fevcral Hints given him
of his approaching Fate j one particular Southfayer
pointed out the very Day to him, namely, the Ides of
March^ but he had no Power to avoid his Fate.
The kind Spirit that foreboded, and gave hints to
him, that he was in Danger, as if contented with
having done his part, left him to be murther'd. No
Affiftance given him to rouzc up his Spirits to take
the Alarm : He is not led by the Hand, and told,
go not into the Senate Houfe^ as was done for Lot^
efcape for thy Life. The kind Monitor does not
name the Traytors and AfTaflinators to him, and fay
Brutus^ and Caffius^ Cafca^ and others, wait there to
kill you 5 as the Angel to Jofeph^ Herod will feek the
young Child to dejlroy him.
A ND on the other fide, C^farjhold and unalarm'd,
indolent, and having things not fufficiently explained
to him J (and th " good Spirit, as may be fuppos'd,
able to do no more for him j) goes on, enters the
Senate Houfe, moc';s the Southfayer, and tells him
the
of APPAR ITIO NS.
the Ides of March are come^ who (harply return'd.
But they are not paft. In a word, negledling his
own Safety, and wanting a complcat Information,
he goes into the Senate, and is murther'd.
JULIAN the Apoftate is another Exa#ple:
He had a thoufand ill Omens, as they call'd them,
which attended him at and before his undertaking
the Perjian War 5 fuch as the dying of the Conful
jfulianus o£ his own Name, the burning of the Tem-
ple o^ Apolloy and feveral other Accidents > and tho'
he was the moft fupcrllitious of all the Heathen
Emperors that were before him, and fent to all the
Oracles, to all the Augurs and Southfayers he could
hear of, infomuch that the Citizens of Antioch made
a Jeft of him for itj Yet he was fo blinded by his
Flatterers, or deluded by the Priefts, who conftrucd
the worft and moft portentous things, to mean the
beft Events 5 or, which is beyond it all, by the fu-
perior Decree of an appointed Vengeance j that he
went on and was kill'd in the very beginning of
the War 5 the firft Battel with the Perfians carried
him off.
I MIGHT tnultiply Examples of the like kind,
even on both udes, and cfpecially on the laftj buc
'tis fufficient J our own Experience will confirm it
:
fecret Notices are daily given us of capital Dangers
attending, and yet how do the moft vigilant Ob-
fervers of thofe Signals, and the moft eminent O-
men-Hunters, even after thofe Notices, fit ftill,
and grow indolent ? or elfe, amaz'd and bewilder'd,
they fay, I know there's fomcthing a coming to me,
fome Mifchief attends me, I have plain Notice of itj
but I don't know what it is, I can't tell what to do j
I can do nothing to avoid or prevent it. And thus
they fall into the Pit, as we may fay, with their Eyes
open, and in fpighc of the kind Spirit's beneficent
Warning.
Wh A T
41 The Hifiory and Reality
What can this be? but becaufe the Spirit, tho*
really kind and beneficent, yet limited and impo-
tent in Power, was able to do no more than to give
the Hint, leaving the Perfon to his own Prudence
to g^rd and direft himfelf ?
\ 1 MIGHT add here what 'tis rational enough to
fugged, 'uiz. that Heaven in its infinite Wifdomi.
and Goodnefs may hdve appointed thefe Good
Spirits to give fuch Notices, yet allowing them
to do no more, that the Mind of Man being duly
alarm'd at approaching Evil, and believing fomc-
thing very fatal to him is at Hand j but feeing no
kind Being dire6ting what Methods to take for his
Deliverance, or for efcaping the impending Mif-
chief, fhould turn his Eyes (at lead) a little upwards,
and call for Direction and Council from that Hand,
who alone can both, diredt and deliver.
But hold! whither am I going? This looks
like Religion, and we muft not talk a Word of
that, if weexpeftto be agreeable. Unhappy Times!
where to be ferious, is to be dull and grave, and
confequenrly to write without Spirit. We muft
talk politely, not religioufly^ we may {how the
Scholar, but muft not (how a Word of the Chri-
ilianj fo we may quote prophane Hiftory, but not
facred j and a Story out o^ Lucan or Plutarch^ I'ully^
or Virgil will go down, but not a Word out of
Mofes or Jojhua.
Well, we muft comply however 5 the Humour
of the Day muft prevail j and as there is no inftru-
fting you without pleafing you, and no pleafing
you but in your own Way, we muft go on in that

cn'd by the Stage not the Pulpit, and Wit be
brightcn'd by Satyrs upon Scnfc.
This Hypothefis, of a new fuppos'd Clafs of
Spirits, would lead me into a great many ufeful
Speculations > and I might remark with great Ad-
vantages from ir, upon the general Indolence, which
it is evident has fo fatally poflefs'd our Men of Wit
in this Age. To fee a Fool, a Fop, believe himfelf
infpir'd, a Fellow that waflies his Hands fifty times
a-day, but if he would be truly cleanly, fhould
have his Brains taken out and wafh'd, his Scull
Trapan'd, and plac'd with the hind-fide before,
that his Underftanding, which Nature plac'd by
Miftake, with the Bottom upward, may be fee
right, and his Memory plac'd in a right Pofition >
To this unfcrew'd Engine talk of Spirits, and of
the invifible World, and of his converfing with
unembodied Soul, when he has hardly Brains to
converfe with any thing but a Pack of Hounds,
and owes it only to his being a Fool, that he does
not converfe with the Devil! who if he has any
Spirit about him, it mufl: be one of thefe indolent
Angels I fpeak ofj and if he has not been lifted a-
mong the Infernals, it has not been for want of
Wickednefs, but for want of Wit.
I don't wonder fuch as thefe go a mobbing a-
mong thofe mcaneft of mad Things call'd Free-
Mafons 5 rough Cheats, and confefs'd Delufions
are the fitteft things to amufe them. They are like
thofe fooliih Fifh that are caught in large Nets,
that might get out at every Square of the Maih,

chufe to hamper and tangle thcmfclves, when there
is no occafion for it, and are taken even in thofe
Snares that are not laid for them.

Of the Appearance of departed Unembo-
died Soul.
I
NOW come to the main and moft difputed
Part of ftiadowy Appearance, 'viz, the Appari-
tion of Unembodied Soul.
I T is a material Difficulty here, and ought to be
confider'd with the utmoft Plainnefs, (yiz) what
we mean by Unembodied Souhy whether we under-
fland Souls which have been encas'd in Flefh, but be-
ing unhous'd are now moving abou'-, in what State
we know not, and are to be fpoken of as in their
feparate Capacity: Or whether there is any fuch
thing as a Mafs of Soul, as a learned but pretty
much inconfiftent Writer calls it, which waits to
be embodied, as thefuperior Difpofer of that Affair,
(be chat who or what he pleafes) may direct.
This I confefs is to me fomething unintelligi-
ble, looks a little Platonick^ and as if it were a-kin
to the Tranfmigration-Whimfie of the Ancients j
but if they would found it upon any thing rational,
it muft be upon the Suggeftion mentioned above,
viz. of a middle Clafs of Spirit, neither Angclick-
Heavenly, or Angelick- Infernal : But Spirits inha-
biting the invidble Spaces, and allow'd to a6t and
appear here, under exprefs and greatly llrain'd Li-
mitations, fuch as arc already defcrib'd, and of which
much more may (till be faid.
But that I may clear up your Doubt as to the
Part I am upon, 1 have added at the Head of this
Se6i:ion, the Word Departed^ to intimate to you,
that I am Orthodox in my Notion j that I am none
of the Seft of Soul- Sleepers, or for iroprifoning
Souls
of APPARITIONS. 4y
Souls in a Limhus of the Ancients; but that, in a
few Words, by the Appearance of Souls Unembo-
died, I mean fuch as having been embodied or im-
prifon'd in Flefli, are difcharg'd from that Confine-
ment, or as I call it unhoused and turn-d out of
Poficffion. For I cannot agree that the Soul is in
the Body, as in a Prifon j but rather that, like a rich
Nobleman, he is pleas'd to inhabit a fine Country
Seat or Palace of his own Building, where he
refolves to live and enjoy himfelf, and does fo, *till by
the Fate of things his fine Palace being over-turn'd,
whether by an Earthquake or othcrwife, is bury'd
in its own Ruins, and the noble Owner turn'd out
of Pofleffion, without a Houfe.
This Soul, we are told, and I concur in theO-
pinion, has fometimes made a Tour back into this
World J whether Earth, or the Atmofphere of the
Earth, call it where you will, andexprefsit howyou
will, it matters not much; Whence it comes, how far
the Journey, how, and why it came hither, and a-
bovc all, how it goes back again, and what thofe
various Apparitions are which counterfeit thefe
Spirits: enquire within, and you fhall know
farther.
That the Unembodied Souls of Men Dead,
as we fay Departed, have appeared, we have af-
firm'd from the Authority of the Scripture; which
I muft allow to be an authentick Document, what-
ever the Reader may pleafe to do; 'till a Hiftory
more authentick, and of better Authority may be
produc'd in the Room of ic.
A s to the Appearance of Samuel^ rais'd by the
Witch, I defpife it, as it is ofFer'd in the Capacity
of a Soul, much more as the Unembodied Soul of
Samuel \ which iho' it might have been caus'd to
appear, as the Sovereign of all Spirits, with whom
the Soul of Samuel is at Red:, had thought fit ; yet
could no more be fummon'd from that Reft, by
the
4^5 The Hijlory and Reality
the Conjuration of an old Witch, than the Devil
could fetch it out of Heaven by Force. Nor was it
likely that God, who refus'd fo much as to fpeakto that
abandon'd Prince, whom he had fo righteoufly re-
jc6ted, and that would anfwer him neither by Urim^
or by 'Thummim^ that would neither hear his Prayer,
or accept his Offering, would hear a Witch, a
Creature likewife fentenc'd to Death by his own
righteous Law, and fend Samuel at her Infernal
Paw-wawing from Heaven, to tell Saul that to-
morrow he fhould be cut in Pieces by the Phili"
fiines'y there feems to be no Confiflency at all
in it, no, none at all.
The Appearance of the Thing calPd Samuel^
was, in my Opinion, neither more or lefs than a
Phantafm or Spedtre, which (as the Devil is allow'd
to do) might perfonate the old departed Prophet,
and who, at the Witch's Summons, and by Hea-
ven's Permiilion, came up to pronounce the dread-
ful Sentence upon Saul^ and let him fee what was
the Effe6t of his forfaking God, and rejefbing his
Prophet Samuel, And thus it might be allow'd alfo
to fpeak in the firft Perfon of the Prophet, as it
did> nor do i fay, or think, as fome do, that it was
the Devil in Samuel'^ Likenefs 5 if it had, 'tis not
likely the old Woman would have been fo frighted
as to cry out, feeing fhe was better acquainted
with the Devil^ than to be furpriz'd, if it had been
her old Familiar.
B u T fhe faw fomething fhe did not cxpefl:, and
perhaps had never feen before j for fhe tells the
King, fhe faw Gods afcending out of the Earth
;
by which I cannot but underftand, fhe faw fome
of thofe Spirits which I have mention'd, which
are not Infernal, and who might forefee what the
Devil himfelf cannot 5 for I have no reafon to be-
lieve that Satan knows any thing of Futurity.
If
of APPARITIONS. 47
I Fit be asked here, by what Authority the Witch
could bring up one even of thefe Spirits 5 that in-
deed may be difficult to anfwer, other than thus,
that it might be as Balaam was over-rul'd to blefs,
when he mtended to curfej and that at her Call,
and to pronounce the approaching Fate of Saul^
and Jfrael^iih him, fhe might beover-ruPd, and fo
caird up, or call'd in, a good Spirit inllead of the
Devil.
As for the Speftre's fpeaking in the Name of
Samuel in the Scripture, and the Text reprefen-
ting it as if it were really Samuel himfelf, i Sam,
xxviii. If. JndS^mvitl [aid to Saul, why haft thou
difquieted me^ to bring me up? I take it to be an Ex-
preiHon^i Hominem^ to the common Underflanding,
and to be underftood as all Allegorick or Figurative
Expreffions are underftood j and it no more proves
that it was Samuel^ and is no more to be taken lit-
terally, than the other Words in the fame Verfe
are to be litterally underftood.
I. WHT haft thou di[quieted me? as if it was in
SauV^ Power, by the Conjurations of an ab-
horr'd condemned Limb of the Devil^ a profcrib'd •
Witch, to difquiet the departed Soul of Samuel-^
the Meaning is no more than this, What is your Bu-
finefs with me, what do you trouble me -for? You
that defpifed me, and a6ted contrary to all my Di-
re6tions, and would go on in your Perverfenefs in
fpite of me, and of all I could fay to youj what
do you come to me for, now I am dead ?
1. 'to bring me up? intimating that Samuel was
below, or was called ab InferiSy which is contrary
to Reafon as well as Religion, and neither confifts
either with our Notion, or any body's elfe, except it be
the Soul-fleepers, who tell us, the Soul fleeps with
the Body in the Grave 'till the Refurredlion 5 and if
fo, then muft the old Woman have had Power to
awake him whenever Ae pleas'd.
f Upon
4 8 The yjjifiory and Reality
Upon the whole, it feems this Woman was ^
Witch of Tome Eminency, and had more than or-
dinary Power in her way. For when Saul applies
to her, fhe asks him, Whomflialll bring up? mti-
mating that fhe was able to bring up who flic
would, either from Heaven or Hell,
This Boldnefs plainly infers, that flie had no
Power at all, but this j that being a Witch, and one
that had a Familiar Spirit, flie could caufe her Familiar
or Devil, call it what we will, to appear and perfonatc
who flie pleas'd to name. For why fliould not the
Bevil be as able to drefs himfelf up like one dead
Perfon, as another ? and why not appear as well in
the Shape of a dead Man, as of a living One?
S o that to me there is no more Difficulty in his
DrefTing himfelf like Samuel^ than there was in calling
himfelf fo, or than fpcaking in the firfl: Perfon of
SammU'3,% above 5 Why difquiet Me, and why bring
Me up? AH that feems inexplicable in it is, how he
(hould be able to tell Saul what fliould happen,
(viz,) that God would deliver Ifrael into the
Hands of the PhilifiineSy and him (Saul) with them,
and that to-morrow he fliould be with him 5 that is,
among the Dead, fliould be killed in the Battel.
This mdecd has fomething difficult in it, becaufe
the Devil is not allowed to be a Prophet, or able to
predifi what is to come. But thefe things may be
all anfwer'd by the Story of Balaam^ where the
wicked Creature, tho' a Wizard, and a Conjurer,
yet was diredled, not only to blefs Ifrael in fpite
of all the Gifts and Rewards that the King o^ Moab
ofFer'd him, but was enabled to prophefy of Chrill,
and foretel the glorious appearing of the Meffiah >
Numb, xxiv. 17. IJhallfee him hut not now, IJhall
hohold him but not nigh j ^here Jhall come a Star out
of Jacob, and a Scepter ^^// arife out of Ifrael j and
again, out of J A cob Jhall come he that Jhall have
Dominion, This was a plain and dircdt Prophecy
of APPAR IT 10 NS. 49
of Chrift, who is call'd in the Revelations the
Morning-Star 5 and yet this Balaam was a Witch,
a Dealer with an Evil Spirit, and receiv'd the M^ages
of Unrighteoufnefs.
The next Teitimony which we find in facred
Hiftory, of the Reality of Apparitions, as it refpefe
the Souls of depai'ted Perfons, is the Appearance of
Mofes and Ellas with Jefus Chrlji in the Mount, at
his Transfiguration 5 they not only were there, really
and perfonally, in their Habits, and fo as to be known
to the Difciples, but they appear'd talking with
Chrift y fo that it was a Perfe«5t and Compleat Ap-
parition, {viz.) the particular Perfons appearing, and
known by the Perfons to whom they appear'd.
Mat. xvii. ?. And in another Place, the manner of
the Apparition is defcrib'd, as alfo what they talk'd
of, Luke ix. 38. Who appeared in Glory^ and talk'd
of his Deceafe^ which he jhould accompliJJo in Jeru-
falem.
This is fo plain and unqueflionable an Appear-
ance of departed Souls, that they who difpute it,
muft not only doubt of the Divinity of Scripture,
but mufl difpute its being an authentick Hiftory j
which its Enemies will hardly deny.
WE have yet another Teilimony, and this is as
pofitive and exprefs as the reft 5 Matth. xxvii. yi.
^nd the Graves were opened^ and many of the Bodies
of the Saints which flept arose, and came out of the
Graves after his Refurredlion^ and went into the holy
City^ and appeared unto many-
T H I s is a remarkable Place, and would admit of
a long Expofitionj but I muft not preach, and if I
might, I am no Annotaror; as far as it is to my
prefent Purpofe, the Bodies arofe^ that was extraor-
dinary j but that their Souls were alfo with their
Bodies, is not to be douted, at leaft by mej for I
have no Notion of the Body walking about without
;he S0UI5 nor do we ever read of bodily Apparitions.
t- E An
jo 'J'he Hijlory and Reality
A N Apparition is vulgarly call'd by u? a Ghoft,
by our Northern People a Gheji-y now the Ghoft is
a Spirit, and the Apparition of a Spirit has fomc
Senfe in it j the Spirits alfoafTuming a Shape or Body,
whether Real, or in Appearance only, has fomething
in it to be talked about 5 but the Apparitions of
Body, moving, appearing, walking, or whatever we
may call it, without Soul or Spirit, is what was ne-
ver heard of, and fcarce ever fuggefted.
I T may be obferv'd, that thofe Apparitions quo-
ted from the Scripture, are not Apparitions in Vifi-
on 5 Dreams in the Night, or fuppofed Appearances
only, but plain, open, day-light Vifionsi the for-
mer would not be to my purpofc at all. Thele
'
were Apparitions that were fpoken to, and con-
verfed with 5 and this is a Proof of what I al-
ledge, viz. that Spirits Unembodied may appear,
may reaflume humane Shape, their own former
Likenefs, or any other, and may fhow themfelves
to the World, or to as many Perfons as they pleafe.
The Difficulties which attend this are not a few,
tho' none of them dcilroy the thing it felfj as (i.)
Whether the Souls of good or bad People unembo-
died, are really in a State, or Condition for fuch an
Appearance? and whether it confifts with the juft
Notions we ought to have of the unalterable State?
1 mean fuch Notions as conform to the Scripture,
which, if the Parable of the rich Man and Lazarus
be a juft Reprefentation of it, fcems impoffible to
be, except on fuch an extraordinary Occafion as
that of our Saviour's Transfiguration and Refur-
re6tion 5 that is, by Miracle.
LJZARUS^hys the Text, was, upon his Death,
carried by the Angels into jibraham's Bofom> the
rich Man died, and in Hell he lift up his Eyes.
That this is fuppos'd to be immediately, is evident,
becaufe the .rich Man fpeaks of his Brethren that
were then alive: If he was not carried thither im-
mediately,
of A?P ARITION S. yi
mediately, he would certainly not have been carried
there at all 'till after the Great Audit \ fo that it
was plain he was there prefently after his Death :
and that Lazarus was carried immediately to Hea-
ven is evident alfo j becaufe the rich Man is brought
in feeing him there, and deiiring he may be fcnt
to him.
To fay this is but a Parable, is to fay what may
be granted without Prejudice to the Point, in hand.
For as it is a Parable, it would not have been ap-
pofite, if it had not reprefented things as they were
really to bej it would have been a Delufion, and
brought to deceive j whereas it is a Parable of our
Lord's own bringing, and all thofe Parables that
Chriit uttered, were the mofl: perfe6t Reprefentati-
ens and Illuftrations of the things which they were
broi^ght to fet forth j nor is any one of them lame
in their Allufions, but inftruftive in every Article 5
as the Parable of the Prodigal Son, for Example,
and the Parable of the King making a Marriage for
his Son, and fo of the reft. And why muft this a-
lone be lame, and unapt for the purpofe ?
I F then this Parable is fuited to reprefcnt the State
of the Souls of the Departed, thofe Souls then can no
way be concern'd in the Apparitions which we are
fpeaking of5 except as is before excepted, viz. on
fuch extraordinary Occafions, as that of our Savi-
our above muft be acknowledged to be.
If then, neither the Souls or Spirits pf the Blef-
fed or the Curfcd, the Happy or Mifcrable, the
Sav'd or the Condcmn'd, are concern'd in thofe
Appearances, who then are thefe Inhabitants of the
invifible World ? What are they that conftituce and
poflefs this World of Spirics, fo much talk'd of ?
And if the immenfe Spaces are taken up, if they
are peopled by any fpirituous Creatures, if any
thing but Stars and Planets range through the
empty Place^ as Job calls it. Job xxvi. 7. what are
E i they,
yi The Hijlory and Reality
they, and what are the Spirits that inhabit thofc
Worlds?
There muft certainly be a World of Spirits,
or of Spirit, from %vhence we receive the frequent
Vifits in Publick, and the frequent Notices in Pri-
vate, which are fo perceptible to us, and which we
are fo uneafy about: if they are neither good Spirits
or bad, if they have neither Power to do us Good
or Hurt, as I fee a great deal of Reafon to believe,
then we have not fo much Reafon to be terrified
about them as we generally are : but of that here-
after.
As to the Locality of the Devil^ and his Ap-
pearance, that indeed is another Article, and he
may, as is [aid already^ cover himfelf with what
Shapes, human or brutal, he pleafes 5, but then
this would bring all Apparition to be by the Ap-
pearance of the Devil^ and all the Empire of the
Air to be pofTelVd by him 5 which I cannot grant
:
Particularly, bccaufe, as I faid, fome of thcfc
Apparitions come of good Errands, to prevent Mif-
chief, to proted Innocence and Virtue, and to dif-
cover Injury, Injuftice and Oppreflionj all which
are things very much out of the DeviVs way, re-
mote from his Pra6i:ice, and much more remote
from his Defign ; The Spirits I fpcak of muft be of a
higher Original •, they muft be Heaven-born, of the
glorious Original of angelick Species > and as all
things are known by their Confequences, fo they
are known by their A61:ings> they do Heaven's
Work, are under his immediate Government and
Diredion, and are honour'd with his fpecial Com-
mifHonj they are employed in his immediate Bufi-
nefs, namely, the common Good of his Creature
Man: They that do Good, demonftrate in the beft
manner that they are good.
So that every way we Ihould meet with fome
Difficulty in this Cafe, unlefs folv'd, as I faid before,
by
of APPARITIONS. 53
by the denominating another Clafs of Spirits nei-
ther immediately celeftial, or at all infernal > neither
embodied, or that have been embodied, or that fliall
ever be embodied.
I T cannot beexpe£l:ed I fhould defcribe what thefe
are, and in what Condition j iris fufficientthat I only
fay Such may be there, and that they may be fuch
as he thinks good to place there who made that
empty Place ; I may as well ask the Enquirer
what fort of Inhabitants they are who pof-
fefs the Moon or any of the Planets, and whether
they dwell in a State of Innocence, or have con-
tracted Guilt-, and if the latter, whether there is a
glorious Eftablifhment of Redemption, and a Co-
venant of Life granted for them, as there is here,
by the Purchace and Merit of a Saviour?
I T is no fair Queflion to ask me a Demonftra-
tion for an HypotheftSy or is it reafonable to tell me
they will not believe ir, becaufe I cannot prove the
Affirmative of what I do not affirm. I advance
the Probability, and fay, that it is the more
Probable, becaufe (as they fay of the new Philo-
fophy) by this we can folve feveral other Phseno'
niena^ which we cannot other wife account for 5 and
I alledge it is much more probable and more ratio-
nal to fugged: it, than it is that the Planets fhould
be inhabited, for which 'tis certain that God mufl
have created a new Species of Creatures, or that none
can dwell there.
The Wafte or the empty Space, as Job calls
it^ is full of Spirits*, I beHeve that may be taken
for granted : they are placed there, if they are there^
by the powerful Hand of the Creator : there is no
Philofophy can be pleaded againfl: the Place being
habitable J whereas the Objc6bions againfl the Pla-
nets being habitable arc unanfwerable, but by the
Abfurdity of bringing Almighty Power in to create
feveral new Species of Creatures, fome to live in

Fire, fome in Froll, fome in all Darknefs and Ice,
fome in boiling Waters and fcalding Air.
The Inhabitants which 1 fugged are created
for the Regions of the invidble World, are Spi-
rits, invifible Subftances, Bodies without Body,
fuch as are proper for the Expanfe in which they
live, and eligible for us to conceive of > and tho'
we cannot grafp a Spirit with our Hands, feel it
and fee it, yet we can in fome manner conceive of
it. But, for the planetary Inhabitants, we cannot ac-
count for them to our felves or any one elfe, nor
can we conceive any thing of them that we can fay
is probable or rational
I s it at all irrational to fuppofe, or improbable
to be, that God may have made a Degree of An-
gels or of miniftring Spirits (whether they are
angelick, or of other Species is not for us to de-
termine) who may be of a differing Degree, ap-
pointed for a differing Refidence, and to different
Employments from the fuperior Angels, for a
Seafon ?
As there are different Degrees of Glory in Hea-
ven, Stars of different Magnitude and Luftre in
the Firmament, fo may there not be Angels or
Spirits of differing Quality and Degrees of Power
and Favour? why elfe are they called fbrones^ and
Dominions^ Prmcipalities^ and Powers ? they are all
Titles of Honour given to the Angels in the Scrip-
ture, Eph, i.zi. and vi. 12. If there be feveral
Titles, there muft be feveral Degrees.
There can be no Superior, if there are no In-
ferior 5 what can wc underftand by Thrones and
Principalities in Heaven, but Degrees of Angels?
Befides, what do we underftand by Jngels^nd Arch-
Angels? I "fheff. iv. 16. Jhall defcend with the Voice of
an Arch' Angel: and again, Jude ver. 3. Michael the

If

If there are Angels which are not Arch-An-
gels, but of an inferior Degree j fo there may
be alfo different Degrees, among the Angels
which are not Arch- Angels j and fome of thefe
may be appointed their Refidence in the h\\: or At-
mofphere of this World, (ELarth) or within the
Compafs of this particular Solar Syflem, (for I al-
low there may be feveral like Syftcms)
Thus thofe that will fuppofe thefe Appear-
ances to be of none but Angels, I (hall not con-
tend at all with them : I exclude no Species of
Spirits, but the departed unembodied Souls of Men:
1 have allowed Apparitions to the Devil himfelf
upon his own wicked and proper Occafions. I only
cannot grant, that becaufe God can, therefore he
docs employ him, upon his own gracious and bene-
ficent Orders to his Creature 5 This muft at Icaft
feem to bring Providence to a Neceffity of em-
ploying him for want of other Officers, which I
think is highly detra6l:ing, and diihonouring of the
divine Majefty, as if he was oblig'd to employ the
2)m/, as we fay, for want of a Better.
But excluding Satan, I think God does not
want Agents j he has apparently pofted an Army
of miniftring Spirits, call them Angels if you will,
or what elfe you pleafe j I fay, pofted them round
this Convex^ this Globe the Earth, to be ready at
all Events, to execute his Orders and to do his VVill,
refcrving ftill to himfelf to fend exprefs MefTengers
of a fuperior Rank on extraordinary Occafions.
I MAKE no queftion but thefe are the Angels
which carried away Lazarus into Abraharn's Bofom,
I mean which are fuppofed to do fo.
I DOUBT not, thefe are the Angels of which
Chrift fays, his Father, if he had pray'd, would have

j^ The H'tjlory and Reality
this little Point the Earth, and this defpicable Species
called Man, would be but to oblige me to fay. What
may not God be fuppofed to do for that Creature
whom he /^ lov*d as to fend his only begotten Son to
redeem? So at lead thiit Queflion is fully anfvver'd.
Now, thefe Spirits, let them be what they will,
and call them Angels if you pleafe, I conceive
thefe are they whofe Appearances give us fo much
Difficulty to folve : Thefe may, without any Abfur-
dity, be fuppofed capable of affuming Shape, con-
verfing with Mankind, either in the ordinary or
extraordinary Way, either by Voice and Sound,
tho' in Appearances and borrowed Shapes j or by
private Notices of things, Impulfes, Forebodings,
Mifgivings, and other imperceptible Communica-
tions to the Minds of Men, as God their great
Employer may dired.
Nor are thefe Notions of them at all abfurd or
inconceivable,! tho' the Manner how they a6b may
not be underflood by us: 'Tis but Soul conver-
fing with Soul, Spirit communicating to Spirit,
one intelleftual Being to another, and by fecret
Conveyances, fuch as Souls converfe by.
Neither is' the Apparition of thefe Spirits
any Abfurdityj thefe may be intimate with us, ap-
pear to U5, be concerned about us, without any
thing unintelligible in it: Why may not one Spi-
rit be fo as well as another > and one Kind or Species
of Spirits as well as another ?
I F thefe are innocent, good- meaning, and bene-
ficent Spirits, why may it not confifl with the
Wifdom and Goodnefs of God to fuffer fuch to be
converfant with Men, and to have Accefs to the
Spirits embodied 5 as well as to allow the Devil and
jcvil Spirits to converfe fo among us to our Hurt?
But lee me give one Caution here, and enter

telligence of human Affairs, and this by Magick and
Conjurations, which we vulgarly and judly enough
call \.\it Black Arty I cannot allow thisPart of Science
to have! any Influence upon, or Command over, any-

of the Devil to perfonate the old Prophet Samuel^
and appear in his Shape, fpeak in his Name, and a6b
the Prophet in Mafquerade > fo thele Men of Art

himfelf an Inhabitant of the World of Spirits, and
fo delude Mankind, as he does in almoft every thing
he fays to them> But he cannot really call up one
of thcfe independent free Spirits, who are perfc61:ly
out of his reach where-cver they are 5 and whofe
angelick Nature places them above, not under
him, or at his Command.
Satan is a conquered, fabdu'd Enemy j and
thefe indeed were his Conquerors, and are Hill
his Terror > He abhors them, and hates them, and
flees before them : And what if I (hould fay they
were placed in this Situation, (namely, in the in-

bel, tho' he retires from the Country with his
Troops, the War being over, yet leaves a good
Body of Forces to keep the Peace of the Coun-
try, and to awe the Rebels from any farther Attempt.
Thus they are Guardian Angels really, and in
the very Letter of it, without being oblig'd to at-
tend at every particular Man's Ear or Elbow.
Mankind are thus truly faid to be in the Hands
of God always \ and Providence, which conftantly

CHAP. VI.
Ofthe Manner How the Spirits of every Kind,
which can or do appear among us^ manage
their Appearance ; and How they proceed,
THE Poffibility being thus fettled, and it being
granted that Spirits, or detach'd Angels, do
converfe with Manlnnd vifibly as well as invifibly,
and have Accefs to us, to our Souls as well as Bo-.
dies, as well by fecret Communication, as by open
and publick Apparition > it remains to enquire into
the Manner how this Converfation is carried on.
I HAVE already entred my Proteft againft all
thofe Arts call'd Magical and Diabolic, by which
Man is made capable (at leafl) of being AggrefTor in
this Communication, that he can call up thefe Spi-
rits, or call 'em down rather, and begin the Con-
versation when he pleafes.
Whether by Compact and fecret Hellifli
Familiarity with the De'vil he may not obtain Leave
to ufe Satan with fuch Freedom, I will not deter-
mine j I doubt he may: for the Devil may depute
fuch and fuch Powers and Privileges to his Confe-
derates, as to his Honour in his great Wifdoin
fhall feem meet : But that he can empower them
to do the like with thofe good and beneficent
Spirits of the invifible World, who are (I have fup-
pos'd) Spirits, not Devils^ that I deny, nor do I fee
any Reafon to grant it.
I COME then to the Manner the Spirits, which
I would fuppofe may inhabit the utmoft Wafte,
are^ble to correfpond with us: and firft, as Spirits
or
of APPARiriO NS. yp
or Angels, call them as you will, they are to be fup-
pofed, like other Spirits, to have an exteiifivc
Knowledge, and a View of all created Siibflances,
at lead on this fide Heaven •, a vafl capacious Un-
derflanding, an unbounded Sight, a Liberty of Lo-
co-motion, pafling from one Region to another, -
from one Planet to another j they are not congeal'd
by Cold, or calcin'd by Heat> that they are able
to cxift in all Climates, even from Saturn to Mer-
cury-y that they» may go and come, appear and dif-
appear, here or where elfe they pleafe > in a word,
that they are free Agents, as well in their Motions
as A6bings. Hence they are necelTarily to be fup-
pofed to know all tilings needful to he known, re-
lating to us, as well as to other things> that they
can take Cognizance of human Affairs, and that
not by Grant or Licenfe, or by fccond hand Infor-
mation from Hell, from the infernal Spirit, or any
other Place, but by their own angelick and fpiri-
tuous Penetration > and that they have no Depen-
dance upon Satan, or any Power or Peifon con-
cern'd with him 5 that they a6t alfo as Spirit on all
Occafions.
Tho' we fee nothing of them, they fee us j tho'
we know nothing of them, they know and arecon-
verfant about us, are capable of being affe6i[ed and
moved in our Behalf, and to concern themfelves for
our Good on many Accounts : Hence they often
give us Notices and Warnings of Evils attending
us, tho' they cannot aft fo upon material Objeds,
as to interfere with our Affairs, over-rule our
Fate, or direfb us how to avoid the Evils which
they forefee, or to embrace the Good which they
fee attending us 5 of which, and the Rcafons of it, I
have fpoken already.
As they can thus communicate things to our
Imagination, fo we may fuppofe, that in Profecu-
tion of that beneficent Concern which they have
for
(Jo The Hifiory and Reality
for us, they can and frequently do aflume human
Shape, and come to us, talk to us, and converfe
intimately with us in Apparition and by Voice,
nay even in Dialogue, Queftion and Anfwer, as
they fee Occafion.
This converfing in Apparition, is what we call
Walking , and when any luch thing is feen, we fay
a Spirit walks^ or haunts fuch a Place j and tho' this
is a mighty terrible thing in the vulgar Appearance,-
and the People, when thefe things appear to
them, are apt to fay they fee the Devil-y yet it is
very often a Miilake, and a very wide Miftake, as
appears by the Confequence.
Ihave heard of a Man who travell'd four
Years thro' moft of the Northern Countries of
Europe with the Devils if all thofe Spedres or Ap-
paritions are Devils^ which I muft not grant; nor
was this Speftre fo infincere as to conceal it felf
all the while from him, but difcover'd to him that
he was but an Apparition, without Body, Subftance,
or any thing but Shape.
If the Account 1 have of this Apparition be
true, and I have had it by me many Years, he did
him Good, and not Hurt; he guided him thro' De-
farts and over Mountains, over frozen Likes, and
little Seas cover'd with Snow; he diverted him
with Difcourfes of various Subje61:s, always ifluing
for his Good, and for the Encreafe of Knowledge
:
He went with him over the Sea from Ireland ro rhe
Coaft of Norway: He procur'd Winds for him,
without buying them of Witches and Laplanders:
He did not raife Storms for him, becaufe being a
Traveller and upon a Voyage, he had no Occafion
of them; but he foretold Storms pundually and
exactly, prevented the Ship's putting out to Sea
when Storms were approaching; found the Ship's
Boat and Anchors, when the firil was driven away
in the Night, and the fccond weigh'd and run a-
way

way wiih by the Norwegians in the Dark, the
Ship having been obliged to flip and run up into
Harbour j I fay, he found them, that is to fay,
directed the Seamen where to find them, and to
difcover the Thieves.
He did a thoufand things for him, and for his
Accommodation, in his Travels 3 he was acquainted
where-ever he came, and procured his Fellow-
Traveller Entertainment and good Ufigej he
knew the Affairs of every Country, and the very
People tooj he fpoke every Language, Germany
Norfe or Norway^ Polijh Prujjian^ Ruffian^ Hungarian^
^artavian^ and Turkijh.
He pad Rivers without Bridges, tho' he XjjAuld
never let his Fellow-Traveller fee him do thrj, or
help him to do it 5 nor would he let him fee him
mount into the Air upon any occafion whatever jbuc
would fet him in his Way, give him very faithful
Dire6bions how to find the Places he was going to,
and then ftrike off fome other Way, as if he had
Bufinefs at this or that Place, and would not fail to
meet him again pundually at the place he appoint-
ed.
Sometimes he would be feen at a diflance a
Mile oj more, to-day on his right, to-morrow on
his left Hand, and keeping even pace with him,
come into the fame Village or Town where he
lodg'd, and take up as it were at another Inn> but
if he enquir'd for him in the Morning he was al-
ways gone, and the People knew nothing of him,
except that they juft faw fuch a Man the Evening
before, but that he did not flay.
When he had travelled thus with him from
Ireland^ as I faid, to the Coafl of Norway^ where
they were driven in by Storm 5 and after that by Sea
round the faid Coaft of Norway to Gotien^urgb^where
they put in again by contrary Winds, he perfuaded
the Traveller not to go any fai'thcr in that Ship.
The
^z The Hijiory and Reality
The Traveller being Bound with the Veflel to
Dantzick^ and having a confidcrable Quantity of
Goods on Poard, would by no means be prevailed
with to quit the Ship: His Fellovv-Traveller told
him he had the Second-fightjand that he wasaflur'd
the Ship fhould never come to Dantzick, However
the Traveller not giving fo much Credit to him as
that required, and not knowing any thing of him at
that time, but that he wasaftrange, inrelligenr,' fore-
feeing Man (as he call'd him) wovild continue the
Voyage 5 whereupon the Stranger left him, and
the Ship purfuing the Voyage was furpriz'd with
another dangerous Storm 5 I fay another, becaufc
they had had one before. In this Tempeft the Ship
was driven upon the Coaft of Rugen^ an Ifland on
the German fide of the Baltic^ where with much
Difficulty they put into Straelfund^ a Sea-Port of
PcmereUy and there the Traveller went on Shore.
Here walking penfively and concern'd about
the event of his Fortune, and fearing the Ship
would really be loft, as his firft Man had foretold
him> I fay, walking very anxious upon the Key at
Straelfund^ there meets him a Man who he was ut-
terly a Stranger to, but who faluces him in Engliflj^
calls him by his Name, and asks him what^e did
there.
S u R p R I z ' D with fuch a Salutation, and glad
to fee any Man in fuch a flrange remote Country
that he was like to be acquainted with, and much
more that could call him by his Name, he returned
his Compliment, and anfwer'd that indeed he had
not much Bufinefs there, but that he came thither
by a very unfortunate occafion.
I K NO w you are, fays the Gentleman j you came
in here laft Night m yon Ship j pointing to the
Veflel which lay in the Road betwcn the City and
the Ifland of Rugen.
I D I D fo, fays the fra-velkr^ and I am like to

I DOUBT fo, fays the Stranger^ and I fuppofe that
made you look fo much concern'd.
I CANNOT deny^ /aid he^ but 1 might look
troubled, I think I have Caufe, for I am here in a
ftrange Country, without Acquaintance or Intereft,
and know not yet what Condition the Ship is in,
or my Goods, which I doubt are damag'd.
I A M aflur'd, fays the Gentleman^ the Ship will
not be able to purfueher Voyage, but perhaps your
Cargo may be fafe. 1 underftand the Goods you
have on Board are Herrings.
They are fo, fays the traveller j I have twelve
Laft of Herrings on board, and we have had a
long Voyage already.
I KNOW you hv^Q^ faicl the Gentleman-^ but pull
up your Spirits, your Fiih is all fafe, and you may
get it on Shore > and you ihall either fell it here, or
get Ships here to Reload it again for JDantzick'^2CCi^
feeing you are a Stranger, adds he, I will get you
fome afliflance.
All this while he had not ask'd him his Name 5
but now he faid to him. Will you not let me
know, SiV, who it is I am thus much oblig'd to ?
First, returns he, let me fee and get you fome
help, that you may go cheerfully about your Bufi-
nefs, and we'll talk of that afterwards > fo he bad
him walk a little there, and he would come to him
again.
H E had not walked long but he fees a Meflen-
ger coming to him, to tell him, that there was an
Englijh Gentleman defir'd to fpeak with him atfuch
a Houfe, and that he was to guide him to the
place.
Accordingly he follows the Meflenger,
who brings him to a Publick Houfe where were
Three Gentlemen fitting in a Room, and the Man
he had converfed with made a fourth, who calPd
him in, and bad him fit down,which he did.
4 The
^4 The Hljlory and Reality
The Three Gentlemen faluted him very kindly^
and one of them alfo in Englijh^ and told him they
had received an Account of his Circumftances from
that Gentleman, and that theyfent for him to com-
fort and affift him.
This was a kind and agreeable Surprize to him,
and he could not but receive it with all Civility
and Acknowledgment poflible. After which they
ask'd him to Sup with them,which he accepted of,
and at Supper hearmg the whole of the Cafe, they
fent for a Merchant of that City to come to
ihem.
When the Merchant was come they recom-
mended the Stranger's Affair to him 5 and he, the
Merchant, was foafliftant to the Stranger that he
bought all his Cargo of FiHi, or procured others to
buy it, giving him a Price to his Satisfaction, and
gave him as much Money there as he requir'd, and
good Bills payable at Dantzick for the reft.
I N the mean time, (for this was tranfacling fe-
veral Days) the Three Gentlemen continued ex-
ceeding courteous and obliging to him 5 and after
many other Civilities, they being travelling into
Poland-, invited the Traveller to go with them as
far as Dantzick^ which they knew he was bound
for, and that they would fublill him at their own
Charge fo far. The Traveller confidering his own
Condition, and that the Ship he came in was not in
Condition to purfue the Voyage, rcfolv'd to ac-
cept of the Offer, and accordingly prepared to go
"with them : But he was extremely concerned that
he could not fee the kind Stranger who had firft
faluted him as above, and who brought him to the
Gentlemen that were now fo extraordinary civil
to him > he enquired after him of the McfTenger
that fetched him to that Houfe, but he knew him
not 5 he ask'd the People of the Houfe, but they
could give no Account of himj he ask'd the three
Gen-
6f APPARITIONS, 6s
Gentlemen about him, but they knew nothing
of him 5 the Englijh Gentleman among them faid,
he thought he belonged to that Gentleman, point-
ing to another of the three who was a Germany the
German anfwer'd that he underftood he was the third
Gentleman's Friend, who" was a Swede^ that is a
Pomeranian^ for Pomeren is under the Dominion of
the Swedes. But the Swede faid he thought he was
the Englijh Gentleman's Brother, for he fpoke
Englijh very welU in a word, no body knew him,
and he faw him no more.
I N a Week more or thereabout the four Gen-
tlemen (for now they were fo many) fet out toge-
ther,with every one a Servant 5 except our Traveller^
who had none. Every one that knows the Coun-
try from Stetin to Dantzick and Poland^ knows that
it is a defart and wild Country very thin of Inha-
bitants, and confequently not full of Towns 5
"with feveral Woods and Wafts in their Way, very
difficult to Travel, and this oblig'd them feveral
times to take Guides by the Way^ fo that they
made up with their Guides always Eight, fome-
times Ten in Company, very wellarm'd, and tolera-
bly well mounted.
The third Day after they were paft the Oder^
and began to come out of that Part o£ Pomeren
which lies Eaft of Stetin^ and is call'd the. Ducal
Pomeren^ they obferv'd a Man mean in Apparel, but
appearing fomething more than meerly what Po-
verty reprefents, travelling the fame Way as they
did, but always keeping at about the diftance of
half a Mile from them on their left Hand.
H E travelled on Foot, but kept full pace with
them, and often was fome way before them 5 whe-
ther he was in a Tracker Road, as they were, they
could not tell, but he kept fuch an equal Diftance
as if the Road he was in was Parallel with theirs 5
indeed fometimes they loft light of him f.^r a while 5
F veE
66 7he Hiftory and Reality
yet they were fure to find him again at fome little
diftance, either before them or behind them j and
this continued three Days before they took any
extraordinary notice of him.
But the third Day they were aHttle more cu-
rious about him, and one of them (with a Servant
attending) rode from the Company, iritending to
fpeak with him j but as foon as he law them come
towards him, the Stranger fled farther to the Left
from them 5 ftill however keeping on his Way for-
ward, but plainly fhunning being fpoken with > fo
the Gentleman and bis Servant came back again,
having made no Difcovery 5 except this, that the
Stranger kept no Path or Track, that there was
no Road or Way in the Place where he marcht,but
that he only kept at fuch a certain diftance from
them J from whence they concluded that he
was only fome poor Man that was travelling over
that wild Country, and having gotten fome Intel-
ligence of their Journey kept pace with them, to
guide him the Way : But two Things amufed
them ftrangely that Third Day of their Travel.
I. They obferved that Riding over a large
Plain, where there were fome few fcattering Houfes
which lay on the other fide ofthe Road South, (for
he kept all along (before) on the North fide of
them) I fay, pafling over this Plain, the Traveller
keeping a little behind them crofs'd the Road,
and going up to one of the faid fcatter'd Houfes,
knock'd at the Door and went in.
Upon this they refolv'd if pofiible to get fome
knowledge of him j fo they rode all up to another
of thofe Houfes : Here calling to the Inhabitants,
tho' it was no Inn or Houfe of Entertainment,
but a Poor Husbandman's Cottage, they got
Leave to refrefh thcmfclves, having Provifions and
,Wine of their own, and giving the good Wife a
fmall
of APPARITIO NS. 67
ftnall Bottle of about half a Pint of Brandy at part-
ing, the People were abundantly latisfied.
Here talking of the Traveller, and at what
Houfe he call'd in the Village, (for tho' the Houfes
flood fcragling over the wade, yet as ihcre were near
twenty of them jh all it was call'd a Town) here^
I fay, talking of the Traveller and of his knocking
at the Door of one o\ the Houies, the Woman of
the Houfe underftanding their Language,haftily ask'd.
What, fays fhe, have you feen the Owke Mouraski ?
> Who fhe meant, they did not know; but defcribing
the Perfon to her,and fhe alfo to them, they began to
come to an Under(landing'. Did he not keep Pace
with yow^ fays Jhe^ on the North fide of the Road
all the Way ? Yes, faid they.
A Y, fays pe^ and had youofFer'd to ride towards
him, you would always have found him as far off as
at firll.
That amufed them. Why, what is he ? fays one
of the Gentlemen.
Nay we know not, fays fie^ nor defire to
know.
Why fo ? fays he.
Because, fays fae, he brings no good luck >
pray at what Houfe do ye fay he knockt at the
Door?
They defcrib'd the Houfe, at which the Wo-
man and all the Children fell a crying, and making
a great fign of Sorrow.
What's the Matter, fays the Gentlemen^ what
arc you diftarb'd at ?
O, fays the good Woman.^ that Oinke Mouraski ne-
ver calls at any Houfe in the Town, but fome or
other of the Family dies that Year.
By this it feem'd that he came often that Way,
fo he ask'd the Woman how often he was ufed to
be feen thereabouts.
F z She
(J
8
The Hijlory and Reality
She anfwered, Not often, perhaps once or twice
a Year -, and fays jhe^ fometimes be pafles by and
calls or knocks at no Houfe in his Way, and then,
adds floe^ we are ^lad to lee him.
Why, [ays the Gentleman^ what do you take
him to be the Devil?
N o, no, fays Jloe^ not the Devil^ no, he is a very
good Man.
But why are you fo afraid ofhim then ? fays he.
Because, fays foe^ he knows more than all
the Men in the Worlds he knows if any one
is to die, and then he knocks at the Houfe to tell
them to be ready.
N. B. Here the Woman enquired more exa5lly
about the Houfe where the "Traveller called^ and
the Gentleman going to the Door pointed it out
to her^ at which fie left off crying^ and then
rejoyc'd as much as jhe had lamented before 5 for
it feems floe had mifiaken it for another Houfe
which flood near it^ and where her own Father
and Mother lived.
Then he asked her what Countryman the Tra^
veller was.
She faid, they did not know that, for no Body
ever fpoke to him, they were afraid.
Why, fays he^ when he knocks at the Door
don't ye fpeak to him ?
No, fays fle^ nor does he fpeak a word> but jufl
as he goes away he will fometimes fay re-
peating a word which I do not remember, but
fignifies be comforted -y and then they are fure the
Peifon fhall be fick only, but (hall not die.
But, fays he^ do they entertain him, or give him
any thing?
Y BS^ fays flje^ they fet Bread before him, and
he takes a fmall Piece in his Hand 5 but no Body
can fay they ever faw him Ear.
But what do you take him to be then ? fays he.
A
of APPARITIONS. 6c,
A GOOD Angel, fays the Woman j adding ano-
ther hard Word of their own, fi^nifying that he
did no Hurt to any body j and, fays fhe, to feme
Families he is a MefTenger of Good. All this gave
them Amufement, but no particular Satisfa6bion, and
rather prompted their Curiofity to make farther En-
quiry about him. After about an Hour's refre{liing
themfelves at this poor Cottage, they proceeded on
their Journey, and having rode about two Miles,
they faw- their old Objedt again on the left or north
fide of their Road, as before, and he kept in their
fight in the fame manner all the reft of the Day.
There was a Town, I think 'tis call'd Kint-
zigen, or fome fuch like Name, at a few Miles di-
ftance, and where their Guide told them they fhould
lodge, and before they came to the Town there was
a River, not a great or very wide River, but too
large to ride thro' ir, and at the Town there is a ve-
ry good flone Bridge j built, as they were told, by
the Anceftors of the Kings oiPrujJia^ that is, as I
fuppofe, the old Dukes of Pomerania.
Accordingly they pafs'd this Bridge, and
then went into the Town. It was moft natural to
them to obfervc what Courfe the Traveller would
take to pafs the River, who as he went on muft nc-
ceflarily come to the Bank, •
at near a Mile diftance
from the Town, fo they halted a little, one of them
alighting from his Horfe, as if fomerhing had re-
quired their ftay, that the Traveller might go on
before them, which he did.
Observing him as narrowly as poiHble, they
follow'd him (with their Eyes) down to the very
Edge of the River, nor did he flop or take notice
of them, tho' they faw him ptainly to the very Bank }
but here not being able to keep him exadly \n their
light every Moment, they immediately faw him
going up the rifing Grounds, on the other fide,
F J without
70 The H'tjiory and Reality
without being capable of giving the leaft account
how he pafs'd the Water.
This was the other Paflage, which, I fay, amu-
fcd them very much.
As foon as they came into the Town where they
were to lodge, their Guide looking beyond the
Houfe where they ftop'd, called to them, Look
yonder, fays he, is your Traveller fitting at the
Door of fuch an Inn or Houfe, pointing to the
Places and there they faw him plain at rhc Door ea-
ting a piece of Bread, and having a Pot or Jug of
Polijh Beer {landing by him. One of the Gentlemen
(refolving, if poflible, to fpeak with him) walk'd up in
his Boots to the Place, feeing him fitting all the while
he was going, 'till coming very near, and happen-
ing to turn his Eyes but one Moment from him,
when he look'd again, the Man was gone.
H E ask'd the People of the Houfe about him,
but they knew nothing of him, only that as they
faid there was fuch a Man, but he was gone, and
they neither knew who he was, or whither he was
gone.
Then he ask'd them if they did not know the
Owke Mouraski j they faid Yes, they had heard of
but they did not know him.
Why, fays the Gentleman-i don't you know that
this was he that fat upon the Bench ?
No, they faid^ that could not be he, that was a
poor Countryman, a Traveller.
The Gentleman afiured them that was he j at
which they fecmed very much concerned, but feemed
very willing not to believe him.
W h y, fays he^ are you afraid of him ?
No, fays they^ but we don't like his coming to
us, for, they fay, he brings no good to the Family
where he comes.
But this Difconrfe ended, and the Gentleman
gain'd no Information there.
7 The
of APPARITIONS. 71
The next Day they had his Company again, as
before j and palding by a fingle Houfc upon the Road,
near a Village, but {landing quite out of the Road,
they obferv'd the Traveller to (top at that Houfe,
and go in.
By this time their Curiofity was very much
heightened, and they began to be fomething uneafy
about him 5 it was not very pleafant, they thought, to
have the Devil fo near them, and they could think
him to be nothing iefsj {o they all turn'd back, and
refolv'd to go to the Houfe, and if he was there to
fpeak with him, if pofIible> and if nor, to inform
thcmfelves as much as they could about him.
When they came within about a quarter of a
Mile of the Houfe, they faw the Traveller on the
other fide, having gone out at the back Door, and
travelling forward as unconcern'd, and taking no
notice of them, juft as before.
This furprized themj however they went up to
the Houfe, and enquired about him, as they did
before: but here they received a quite differing Ac-
count of him j here the People blefs'd him, called
him by the fame Name, but took him for their
good Angel, (as they call'd him,) that he always
brought them good Tidings, that they were fure ic
would fare well with them afcer he had been with
them; and a great deal more.
But to bring this Story to a conclufion, fo far
as it ferves the prefent Occafion : This Spedre, or
Apparition, for fo I mufl call it, attended theirt
'till they came within two Leagues of Dantzick^
where the Gentlemen feparated, after a Day or two
flaying in the City 5 the three Gentlemen going
from thence to MariemburgJj in Polijh PruJJia^ and
our Traveller was left in Dantzick.
While he was here a Man made acquaintance
with him who was bound to Koningsberg^ and our
Traveller beinj refolv'd to go for Petersburg-^ was
F 4 glad
72 The Hijlory and Reality
glad to have this-new Acquaintance, which he had,
as we may fay, pick'd up, to go v/ith him 5 To they
embark'd together in a fmall Hoy, upon the Sea or
J^ake call'd the Ffifihaff^ which carry'd them to Ko-
ningsberg. He gives a ilrange tho' diverting Account
of his Converfation with this Man, who told him
fo many Stories of feveral kinds, that it amaz'd him >
and he look'd as if he knew all the World, and all
the People in it, and all things that had happened
in it, or would happen in it for ever to come, and
fomething longer.
However, as the Frifchaf \s not above three
or four Days fail, and they were quickly at Ko-
Tiingsberg^ the Converfation was foon over, and this
new Acquaintance ended 5 but the Traveller conti-
nuing his Journey, enquired in the City if there
were any Paffcngcrs or Gentleman travelling to-
wards Riga^ either by Land or by Sea 5 and being
dire61:ed to a Houfe where Strangers ufed to refort,
he found there feveral People bound for Riga^ fome
Merchants, lome Country-People, fome Seafaring-
People, but msoft enclin'd to go by Sea, there be-
ing VcfTels always ready at the Pillau^ which is a
Town at the Mouth of the Haff^ ready to Sail for
Riga^i if Goods or PafTengers prefented.
But among them all there was an ancient Man,
habited like a Rufs^ or rather like a Greek Prieft,
with a long venerable Beard, a purple Robe or long
Garment, fuch as the Ruffians wear, a high ftiff-
crown'd Furr-cap, and a clofe Veil about his Body,
girded with a Silk Saihj and he declared himfelf
for Riga-y but that being an old Man, he would not
go by Sea, but that he had two Horfes in the City
befidcs his own, having brought two Servants with
him from Grodno m Lithuania^ but one of them had
left him j fo he ofFer'd the Traveller to lend him
pnc of his Horfes for his Company, if he would
travel
of AP PARITIO NS. 73
travel with him to Mittau in Courland^ and thence
to Riga.
I T will take up too much Room here, to give a
full Account of the Travels of this wandring
Perfon, and how in almoft every Place he found
a new Shape ready to thruft into his Company, and
that for four Years intimate Ramble 5 but that at
laft, being in I'tirkey^ his lateft Companion difco-
ver'd to him that he was an Inhabitant of aninvifi-
ble Region, that he had been in his Company in
all his Journey in all the differing Figures that he
had met with, and that in a Word he was the fame
Perfon that embark'd with him in Ireland^ landed
with him in Norway^ left him at Gottenburg^ found
him at Straelfund^^ dogged him upon the way to
Dantzick^ failed with him 10 Koningsberg^ lent him a
Horfe to go to Riga^ and fo on 5 and that he had
only put on fo many Shapes and Appearances, that
he might not be uneafy with him, and tired of his
Company.
How they went on together after that, and the
Converfation that pafs'd between them after the
Difcoveryj how familiar Friends they were for fome
Months after, and what Reafons he gave why he
would never believe that it was a Devil, but a good
and kind Spirit fent to take Care of him, and aflid
him in his Travels; all that, as foreign to my pre-
fent Purpofe, I omit. Perhaps the Story may fee
the World by itfelf, and well worth reading it will
be, if it docs. But of that by the by.
As I do not here enter into the Authority of the
Story, (tho', as I faid, I have feen it in Manufcript
many Years ago) fo I have no more to fay from it
than this, that if fuch good Spirits are converfant
with Mankind, and refident in the invifible Spaces,
we know not vv here > ifwe have reafon to believe they
are not Angels, and yet really by their Adions can-
not be Devils 5 then it follows that there are a
certain
74 'T'he Hifiory and Reality
certain middle Species of Spirits in Being j let them
be what they will, let them be employ'd, directed,
limited and reflrain'd, how and in what manner he
pkafes who is their Maker, and who ought to be
their Guide and Diredorj that's not the matter, nor
can it be enquired into here 5 the Queftion before
us is only whether fuch there are, or no ?
Now if it be granted that there are fuch, and
that brings it down to the prefent Cafe, if there
are fuch, then all Apparitions are not Devils j no,
nor are they walking difturbed Souls of Men lately
embodied and departed : a Notion empty and not
to be defended 5 incongruous, and inconfiftent either
-with Scripture, the Chriftian Religion, or Reafon,
and founded only in the bewildred Imaginations and
Dreams of ignorant People, who neither know how
or by what Rules to judge of fuch Things, or are
capable of right Conceptions about them j who do
not give thcmfelves time to exercife that little Power
of thinking that they are Mafters of, and fo are
left to the Darknefs of their own Fancies, thinking
every thing they fee is a Devil, meerly becaufe they
know not what elfe to make of it, what other Name
to give it, or that it can be podible any thing but:
Devils or Angels can come of fuch Errands.
B y this Miftake they give the Devil the Ho-'
nour of many an A&ion, which he is too much a,i
Devil to have any hand inj alcribe Works of Cha-
rity and Benevolence to him 5 make him move inju-
rious and knavifli Men to do Juftice, Thieves to*
make Reftitution, cruel and inhuman Wretches toi
be merciful, Cheats to turn honeit, Robbers to de-
li ft, and Sinners to r^penr.
Story tells us, that Hind that famous out-law'd
Robber, the moll famous fince Robin Hood^ met
a Spectre upon the Road, in a Place called Stangate^
Hok^ in Huntingtonjhin^ where he ufed to commit
hifS
of AP PARITIO NS. 75
his Robberies; and famous for many a Highway
Robbeiy fince that.
The Spedre appeared in the Habit of a plain
Country Grazier > and as the Devil, you may fup-
pofc, knew very well the Haunts and Retreats than
this Hind ufed to frequent; he comes into the Inn,
and taking up his Quarters, puts up his Horfc, and
makes the Hoftler carry up his Portmanteau, which
was very heavy, into his Chamber; when he was in
the Chamber he opens his Pack, takes out his
Money, which fecmed to be in feveral fmall Parcels,
and puts it together into no more than two Bags,
that it might make an equal weight to each fide of
his Horfe, and make as much fhow of it as poffible.
Houses that entertain Rogues are feldom with-
out Spies to give them due Intelligence; Hind gets
Notice of the Money, fees the Man, fees the Horfe,
that he may know him again; finds out which
Way the Countryman travels, meets him at Stan^
gate-Hole^ jaft in the bottom between the two Hills,
and ftops him, telling him he muft deliver his
Money.
When he nam'd the Money the Grazier feigns
himfelf furprized, puts on the Pannick, trembles,
and is frighted, and with a pitiful Tone fays, / am
(as you fee) hut a poor Man 'y indeed^ Sir^ I have no
Money ; [there the Devil fhew'd that he could fpeak
Truth when it ferv'd his Occafion.] O you old Dog^
fays he, have you no Money .^ Come, open your
Cloak-bag, and give me the two Bags, one on one
fide your Saddle, and one on t' other : what, have
you no Money, and yet your Bags were too heavy to lie
all on one fide? Come, come, deliver, or I'll cut you
to Pieces this Moment. (There he was out too, and
threatened more than he cou'd do.) Well, the poor
Devil whines and cries, and tells him he muil be
mifVaken, he took him for another Man fure, for
indeed he had no Money.
Come,
•J
6 The Hiftory and Reality
Come, come, fays ^/W, come along with me;
and fo he takes his Horfe by the Bridle and leads
him out of the Road into the Woods, which are
very thick there on both fides, and the bufinefs
was too long to ftand in the open Road all the while
to do it.
Wh e n he had gotten into the Woods, Come, Mr.
Grazier, fays he, difmount, and give me the two
Bags this Minute. In fhort he difmounts the poor
Man, cuts his Bridle and his Girts, and opens his
Cloak-bag, where he finds the two Bags. Fery welly
fays Hindy here they are, and heavy as before > fo
be throws them on the Ground, cuts them open, in
one he finds a Halter^ and in the other a piece of
folid Brafs in the exa6t fhape of a Gibbet, and the
Countryman behind him call'd to him, there's your
Fate^ Hind, take care.
I F he was furprized at what he had found in the
Bags, (for there was not a Farthing of Money but
in the Bag where the Halter was, of which pre-
fently,) 1 fay, if he was furprized at what he found
in the Bags, he was more fo at hearing the Coun-
tryman call him by his Name, and turn'd about to
kill him, becaufe he thought he was known } but
he had no Life nor Soul left in him, when turning
about, as I fay, to kill the Fellow, he faw nothing
but the poor Horfe. He funk down to the Earth,
and lay there a confiderable time 5 how long, that
(being alone) he could not tell, but it muft be fome
Minutes. At laft coming to himfelf he goes away
terrified to the lad degree, and aihamed, wondring
what it fhould be.
I HINTED that there was no Money but one
Piece found, which the Story fays was Scots^ a Piece
caird in Scotland a Fourteen^ in Englijh^ a Thirteen
Pence Half-Penny^ to pay the Hangman with > from
whence it may be fuppos'd that Saying is ufcd to this
Day,
of APPARITIONS. 7j
Day, that thirteen Pence Half-Penny Is Hangman's
Wages.
Now tho' the Story has fomc Mirth in it, and
may with the many Stories of that Robber be
laid by as Romances, yet it is thus far to my
Purpofe 5 That this was a Spirit , that mud' be ac-
knowlcHg'd, A good Angel from Heaven wou'd
hardly have been fent to give him fuch an inefFe6tu-
al infignificant Hint, which had no fufficicnt Effe6b,
whatever it might have juft then to furprize him,
for he rob'd continually after that, and was hang'd
at laft for it.
The Devil^ as before, cannot rationally be fufpe-
fted in the Cafe 5 for why fhould the Devil both ^bauk
him, threaten and caution him? threaten him with
hanging him, fright him with the Gibbet and Hal-
tar, and caution him to take care. This was not
for the Devil's Purpofe, it was more for his Inte-
reil to have him go on, though he came to the
Gallows at laft.
If then it was neither ^00^ Angel or Bad^ what
muft it be, and how mult we judge of it ? what
Namemuftwe give him, and who was this Country
Grazier ?
To come off of this, fome will have it be, that
it is the Devil'undcx Conflrainr, the Devil in Com-
miffion, that he is fent on fuch Errands by a fupe-
rior Power that has him at Command j and that
when he is direded to do fo and fo^ he muft obey,
he dare do no otherwife. This is begging the Que-
ftion in the grolTelt manner imaginable. Befides,
why the Devil fent of fuch Errands ?
lA T is not probable^ it is not to be gather'd from^
the ordinary Courfe of Providence. The Devil in-
deed was permitted, or, if you will have it, he
was commiflion'd to ftrip and affli6t Poor Job-y and
he was again permitted to enter into the Herd of
Swine 5 but this does not amount to a Paralel: la
both
78 The Hijiory and Reality
both thofe Examples he was only employ'd as an
Inftrument, and^ as we may exprefs it, in his ordi-
nary Bufinefs, in the way of his Calling, that is to
fay in doing Mifchicf : But here he is fuppos'd em-
ploy'd in doing Good, cautioning a hardened
Rogue to leave off his wicked Courfe, and efcape
the Gallows. Now this is quite out of Satan's
road of Buiinefs > 'tis alfo out of the ordinary courfe
of Heaven's Condudi:, for when do we find God
employing the De'vil in any good Work ? I do not
remember one clear Example of it, in all the facred
Hiftory.
2. I T would argue that Heaven fliould want In-
Uruments, which is not at all juft to infer j will
they pretend, that, for want of more proper Agents^
God {hould employ the Devil to fave a High-way
Man from the Gallows? and, which is more than all
the reft, fhould not bring it to pafs neither? But if
you will allow that this was one of the Imaginary
fpccies of Spirits, who, willing to fave a poor
Wretch that was running head long to the Devil^
took all thefeMeafures to alarm him, and bring him
to juft Refle6lions, but was not able to reclaim
him, was not admitted to give him Notice, when
he was about the fatal Ad he was furpriz'd in, or
to warn him when the Officers came to apprehend
him, this feems rational.
I F the Devil ftiould be fuppos'd to be employ'd
in fuch a Work as this was, and fo contrary to his
Inclination, either he would perform it like him-
felf, treacherous and unfaithful, or at beft, reludant
and unwilling. Perhaps you will fay he durft not
perform it treacheroufly and unfaithfully j and it
may be not : But why muft it be fuppos'd Heaven
Ihould employ his worft and wickedeft Creature,
whom he had long fince disbanded, and caft out
of his Service, rejeding him as unworthy to be em-
ploy'd j and who, if he was employ'd, and durft
not
of APPARITIONS. 7p
not decline the Work, yet, it muft be acknow-
ledged, would obey with the utmoft Averfion and
Unwillingnefsj when at the fame time Millions of
faithful Agents, willing and chearfully-obedienc
Servants, are ready at command, to execute his
Will with the utmoft Vigour and Fidelity?
But to leave arguing upon Infcrutables, let us
come to Narration of Fa(5i:s.
1 HAVE another Account received from a parti-
cular Acquaintance in a neighbouring Nation. I
could name Perfons and Places in a more exa(5fc
manner to thefe Accounts > but fome Reafons of
State forbid us at this time to enter into the Cir-
cumilances or Families. For where Matters of Ap-
parition and Witchcraft are the Subitance of the
Hiftory, it has never been found reafonable to name
Houfcs and Families j and as this Apology will be
allow'd to be juft, I expe6fc it will be accepted by
the Reader in all the Examples I fhall give of this
kind.
A CERTAIN Perfon of Quality, being with
his Family at his Country-Seat for the Summer-
Seafon, according to his ordinary Cuftom, was
oblig'd upon a particular Occafion of Health to leave
his faid Seat, and go to yJis La Chapplle^ to ufe
the Baths there : This was it fcems in the Month
o^ JugMft^ being two Months fooner than the ufual
time ot his returning to Court for the V'inter.
Upon thus removing fooner than ordinary, he
did not then disfurnifh the Houfe, as was the ordinary
Ulage of the Family, or carry away his Plate and
other valuable Goods, but left his Steward and
three Servants to look after the Houle. and the
Padre or Parijh Prieft was defired to keep his Eye
upon them too, and to fuccour them from the
Village adjoining, if there was Occafion.
The Steward "had no publick Notice of any
Hafm approaching J but for three or four Days fuc-
ceffively
8q The Hijlory and Reality
ceffively he had fecrec flrange Impulfes of Dread
and Terror upon his Mind that the Houfe was be-
fet, and was to be aflaulted by a Troop of Banditti,
or as we call them here, Houfe-breakers^ who would
murther them all, and after they had robb'd the
Houfe, would fet it on Fire \ and this followed him fo
fall, and made fuch Impredion upon his Mind, that
he could think of nothing elfe.
Upon this the third Day he went to the Padre^
or Parijh Prieft^ and made his Complaint > upon
which the Pried and the Steward had the follow-
ing Difcourfe, the Steward beginning thus :
FA'tHER'i [aid hey you know what a Charge I
have in my Cuftody, and how my Lord has intru-
iled me >vith the whole Houfe, and all the rich
Furniture is {landings I am in great Perplexity a-
'
bout it, and come to you for your Advice.
Pa. Why, what's the Matter? you have not
heard of any Mifchief threatned, have you ?
St. No, I have heard of nothings but I have
fuch Apprehenfions, and ithasmade fuch Impreffion
upon me for thefe three Days, that=^
* Here he told him the particulars of the Unea-
Jinefs he had been in^ and added^ bejides what is [aid
abovey that one of the Servants had the fame^ and
had toldhim ofity thd* he had communicated nothing
to that Servant in the leajl.
Pa. It may be, you dream'd of thefe things?
St. No indeed, Padre^ 1 am fure I could not
dream of them, for I could never fleep.
Pa, What can I do for you? What would
you have me do ?
St. I WOULD have you firfl of all tell me what
you think of thefe things, and whether there is a-
ny Notice to be taken of them^
*'
Here the Padre examined him more Jiri5ily a*
bout the ParticularSy andfent for the Servant and
examined him apart y and being a very judicious
honefi Man^ he anfwefd him tJpus: Pa,
0/ APPARITIONS. 8i
Pa. Look you, Mr. Steward^ I do not lay a very
great Strefs upon fuch things, but yet I don*t think
they are to be wholly flighted ; and therefore I
would have you be upon your Guard^ and if yoii
have the leaft Alarm let me know.
St, That is poor Satisfadion to me to be up-
on my Guard, if I am over-power'd. I fuppofe, if
any Villains have a HtCign to attack me, they know
my Strength.
Pa, Shall I reinforce your Garrifon ?
St. I w I s H you would.
Pa, Well, Pll fend you fome Men with Firc-
Ai*ms, to lye there this Night.
Accordingly the Prieft fent him five ftout Fel-
lows with Fuzees, and a dozen of Hand-Granadoes
with them, and while they continu'd in the Houfe
nothing appear'dj but the Padre finding nothing
come of it, and being loth to put his Patron to {o
continued a Charge, fent for the Steward, and in a
chiding angry Tone, told him his Mind.
Pa, I KNOW not how you will anfwer it to my
Lord, but you have put him to a prodigious Ex-
pence here, in keeping a Garrifon in the Houfc all
this while.
St, \ Au forry for it, Padre-, but what can I
do ?
Pa, Do! Why, compofe your Mind, and keep up
your Heart, and don't let my Lord fpend two or thred
hundred Livres here, to cure yoii of the Vapours.
St. Why, you faid your felf, Padre^ that it was
not to be wholly flighted ?
Pa. T H A T 's true 5 but I faid alfo, I would not
lay too great a Strefs upon it.
St, What inuft I do then ?
Pa, Do! Why, difmifs the JVfen again, and take
Ivhat Care you canj and if you have any Notice of
Mifchief that may be depended upon^ kt me hav6
Notice too, and I'll affift you.
Q SU
8 1 The Hijlory and Reality
St. Well then, the good Angel muft protedt
my Lord's Houfe, I fee, for no body elfe will.
Amen^ fays the Padre^ I truft the good Spirits
will keep you all: So he blefs'd the Steward, (in
his way) and the Steward went away grumbling
very much that he took away his Garrifon, and left
him to the good Spirits.
It feems, for all this, that the Steward's Notices,
however fecret, and from he knew not who, were:
not of fo light an Import as the Padre thought:
they were 3 for as he had this Impulfe upon hi«>
Mind that fuch Mifchief was brewing, fo it really
was, as you will fee prefently.
A SET of Robbers, who had Intelligence that
the Nobleman with his Family was gone to Ah
La Chapelle^ but that the Houfe was left furnifh'dj,
and all the Plate, and the things of Value were left
in it, had form'd a Defign to plunder the Houfe..
and afterwards to burn i:, iuft as the Steward hac
faid.
They were two and twenty ftrong in the whole,
and thoroughly arm'd for Mifchief Yet while the
additional Force, which the Padre had plac'd t(
reinforce the Steward, were in the Houfe, o^
whom, including the other four, three fat up every
Night, they did not dare to attempt it.
But as foon as they heard that the Guard wai
difmifs'd, they form'd their Defign anew, and, t«
make the Story ihort, they attack'd the Houfe ai
bout Midnight. Having, I fuppofe, proper Ini
ilruments about them, they foon broke open a Win
dow, and twelve of them got into the Houfe
the reft ftanding Centinel at fuch Places as the*
thought proper, to prevent any Succours from thi
•town.
The poor Steward and his three Men were
great Diftrefsi they were indeed above Stairs, am
had barricadocd the Stair-Cafes as well as thi
coulc
of APPARITIONS. 85
could, hearing the Fellows were breaking inj but
when they found they were got in, they expected
nothing but to be kept above Stairs 'till the Houfc
was pluiidcr'd, and then to be burnt alive.
But it feems the good Spirits the Pricft fpokc
of, or fome body elfe, made better Provifion for
them, as you will fee prefently.
When the firft ot the Fellows were gotten in-
to the Houfe, and had open'd the Door, and let in
as many of their Gang as they thought fit, which
(as above) was twelve in Number they fhut the Door
again, and fliut themfelvcs in % leaving two without
the Door, who had a Watch-word, to go and call
more Help if they wanted it.
The twelve ranging over the 'great Hall, found
little there to gratify their greedy Hopes j but brea-
king next into a fine wcll-furnifh'd Parlour, where
:he Family ufually fat, Behold, in a great eafy
Chair, fat a grave ancient Man, with a long full-
Dottom'd black Wig, a rich brocaded Gown, and
I Lawyer's lac'd Band, but looking as if in great
Surprize, feem'd to make Signs to them for Mercy,
3Ut faid not a Word, nor they much to him, ex-
cept that one of them flatting, cry'd, H a ! 'who'^s
here ?
Immediately the Rogues fell to pulling
iown the fine Damask Curtains in the Windows,
md other rich Things j but One faid to Another
with an Oath, Make the old Dog tell us where the
Plate is hid 5 and another faid, // he won't tell you^
cut his Throat iminediately.
The ancient Gentleman, with Signs of En-
:reaty, as if begging for his Life, and in a great
Pright, points to a Doorj which being open'd
would let them into another Parlour, which v^as
;he Gaming- Room, and ferv'd as a Drawing- Room
i:o the firri: Parlour^ and by another Door open'd
nto the great Salon, which look'dinto the Gardens.
Q z They
84 The Hijlory and Reality
Th«y were fome time forcing their way into that
Room 5 but when they came in, they were furpriz'd
to fee the fame old Man, in the fame Drefs, and
the fame Chair, fitting at the upper end of the
Room, making the fame Geftures^ and filent En-,
treaties, as before. I
Thpy were not much concern'd at firft, but
thought he had come in by another Door, and be-
gan to fwear at him, for putting them to the Trou-
ble of breaking open the Door, when there was an-
other way into the Room. But, another wickeder
than the firft, faid, with a heavy Curfe, the old Do^
was got in by another Door^ on purpofe to convey
away the Plate and Money, and bad knock hi:
Brains out. Upon which the firft fwore at him
that if he did not immediately fhow them where i
was, he was a dead Dog that Moment.
Upon this furious Ufage, he points to the Door
which opened into the Salon^ which being a thii
Pair of Folding- Doors open'd prefently, and ii
they run into the great Salon\ when looking at ih
farther end of the Room, there fat the ancien
Man again, in the fame Drefs and Pofture as be
fore.
Upon this Sight, thofe that were foremoi
among them cry*d out aloud. Why, this old Fel
low deals with the Devil fure, he^s here afore u
again.
jBtTT the Cafe difFer'd a little now 5 for whe
they came out of the firft Parlour, being eager fo
the Plate and Money, and willing to find it a l l
the whole Body of them run out into the fecon
Parlour J but now the ancient Man pointing to th
third Room, they did not all immediately rufh ou
into the Salon^ but four of them were left behin
in the Parlour or Gijwning-Room mention'd ju
laowj not by order or defign, but accidentally.
B
of APPARITIONS. 8y
By this Means they fell into the following Con-
fufionj for while fome of them call'd out from the
Salon^ that the old Rogue was there before them again '^
others anfwer'd out of the Parlour, How the Devil
can that be ? why, he is here ftill in his Chair, and
all his Rubbifli : with that, two of them run back
into the firfl Parlour, and there they faw him agi ti
fitting as before. NotwithftaiKling all this, far from
guefling what the Occafion fhould be, they fancied
they were gamed, or fuggefted that they were but
jelled with, and that there were three fevcral old
Men all drefs'd up in the fame Habits for the very
fame Occafion, and to mock them, as if to let them
know that the Men above in the Houfc were not
afraid of them.
Wv^i^iu^ fays one of the Gang^ I'll difpatch one
of the old Rogues, I'll teach one of them how to
make Game at us: upon which, raifing his Fuzee
as high as his Arm would let him, he flruck at
the antient Man, as he thought it was, with all his
Forcej but behold! there was nothing in the Chair,
and his Fuzee flew into a thoufand Pieces, wound-
ing his Hand moil grievoufly, and a Piece of the
Barrel ftriking him on the Head, broke his Face,
^nd knock'd him down backward.
At the fame time, one of thofe in the Salon run-
ning at the antient Man that fat there, fwore he
would tear his fine brocaded Gown off, and then
he would cut his Throat: but when he went to
take hold of him, there was nothing in the Chair.
This happening in both Rooms, they were all
in moft horrible Confufion, and cry'd out in both
Rooms at the fame Moment, in a terrible manner.
As they were in the utmoft Amazement at the

on that fide, run into the Room, and there fat the

tp the Company, and told them, they believed they
were all bewitch'd, and 'twas certain they only
ilmcy'd they fiw a Man in the other Rooms, for
there was the real old Man fitting where he was
at firft.
Upon this they all run thither, faying, they
would fee whether it was the Devil or no 5 and one

A THIRD (for now their Courage began to rife
again) calls aloud^ Let it be the Devil^ or the Devil's
Grandmother, I'll parley with it, I am refolv'd I'll
know what it is : and with that he runs forward
before the reft, and crofting himfelf, fays to the an-
tient Man in the Chair, in the Name of St- Fi;ancis,
and St. —' (and fo reckon'd up two or three
Saints Names that he depended were enough to
fright the Devil) What art thou?
The Figure never mov'd or fpoke-, but looking
at its Face, they prefently found, that inftead of
his pitiful Looks, and feeming to beg for his Life, as
he did before, he was chang'd into the moft horrible
Monfter that ever was feen, and fuch as I cannot
defcribej and that inftead of his Hands held up
to them to cry for Mercy, there were two large
fiery Daggers, not flaming, but red hot, and pointed
with a livid bkiifli Flame, and in a word, the Devil
or fomething elfe, in the moft frightful Shape that
can be imagin'd. And it was my Opinion, when
I firft read the Story, the Rogues were fo
frighted, that their Imagination afterwards form'd
a thing m their Thoughts more terrible than the
f)evll himfelf could appear in.

of AP PARITIO NS.
But be that as it will, his Figure was fuch,
that when they came up to him, not a Man of
them had Courage to look in his Face, much lefs
talk to him j and he that was fo bold, and thus
came arm'd with half a Regiment of Saints in his
Mouth, fell down flat on the Ground, having
fainted away (as they call it) with the Fright.
The Steward and his three Men were all this
while above flairs, in the utmoft Concern at
the Danger they were in, and expelling every
Moment the Rogues would drive to force their
Way up, and cut their Throats > They heard the
confus'd Noife that the Fellows made below, but
cou'd not imagine what it was, and much lefs the
Meaning of it : but while it lafted it came into
the Mind of one of the Servants, that as it was
certain the Fellows were all in the Parlour, and
very bufy there, whatever it was about, he might
go up to the Top of the Houfe and throw one of
their Hand-Granadoes down the Chimney, and per-
haps it might do fome Execution among them.
The Steward approved of this Defign, only
with this Addition 5 if we throw down but into
one Parlour, they will all fly into the Gaming-
room, and fo it will do no Execution j but, fays he,
take three, and put down one into each Chimney,
for the Funnels go up all together, and then they
will not know which Way to run.
With thefe Orders two of the Men, who ve-
ry well knew the Place, went up, and firing the
Fuzees of the Granadoes, they put one Shell into
each of the Funnels, and down they went roaring
in the Chimney with a terrible Noife, and (which
was more than all the reft) they came down into
the Parlour where almoft all the Rogues were,
juft at the Moment that the Fellow that fpoke to
the Spe6tre was frighted into a fvvooning Fit, and
fallen on the Floor.
G 4 The
gg iToe Htfiory and Reality
The whole Gang was frighted beyond Ex^
prcflion 5 feme run back into the gaming Parlour
whence they came, and fome run to the other
Door which they came in at from the Hall 5 but all,
at the fame Inftant, heard the Dm/, as they thought
it was, coming down the Chimney.
H A D it been poffible that the Fuzees of the Gra*
nadoes could have continued burning in the Funnel
of the Chimnies, where the Sound was a thoufand
times doubled by the hollow of the Place, and
where the Soot burning fell down in Flakes of Fire,
the Rogues had been frighted out of their Under-
ilandings 5 imagining, that as they had one dreadful
jDm/jull among them in the Chair, fo there were
ten thoufand more coming down the Chimney to
deftroy them all i and perhaps to carry them all
away.
But that could not be 5 fo after they had been
fufficiently feared with the Noife, down came thp
Shells into the Rooms, all three together : It happen'd
as luckily as if it had been contriv'd on purpofe,
that the Shell which came down into the Parlour
where they all were, burft as foon as ever it came
to the Bottom, fo that it did not give them time
o much as to think what it might be, much lefs
to know that it was really a Hand-Granadoej but
as it did great Execution among them, fo they as
certainly believ'd it was the Devil^ as they believed
the Spe6tre in the Chair was the Devil.
The Noife of the buriling of the Shell was (b
fudden and fo unexpected, that it confounded them,
i|nd the Mifchief v/as alfo terrible 5 the Man that
fainted and who lay on the Ground was killed out-
right, and two more that ftond juft before the
Chimney J fiveofthcm were dciperately wounded,
whereof one had both his Legs broke, and was fo
*
^efpci^aie, that when the People from the Country
cam©
ef APPARITIONS. 8p
came in, he fhot himfelf thro' the Head with his
own Piftol^ to prevent his being taken.
Had the rclt of them fled out of the Parlour
into the two other Rooms, 'cis probable they had
been wounded by the other Shells 5 but as they
heard the Noife in both the outer Rooms, and be-
fides were under the Surprife of its being not a
Hand-Granado, but the Z)^^/, they had no Power to
ftirj nor, if they had, could they know which way
to go to be fafe : fo they ftood flock dill 'till both the
Shells in the other Rooms burft alfoj at which be-
ing confounded, as well with the Noife as with
the Smoke, and expe61:ing more Devils down the
Chimney where they ftood, they run out all that
Way, and made to the Door, helping their wound-
ed Men along as well as they could 3 whereof one
died in the Fields after they were got away.
It muft be obferv'd, when they were thus
alarmed with they knew not, what coming down
the Chimney, they cryed out, that the Devil in
the Chair had fent for more Devils to deftrby them
;
and 'twas fuppos'd that had the Shells never come
down they would all have run away. But certain it
was, that the artificial Devil joyning fo critically
as to Time with the vifionary Devils^ or whatever
they were, com pleated their Diforder, and forced
them to fly.
When they came to the Door to the two
Men, they made fignals for their Comrades, who
were ported in the Avenues to the Houfe, to come
to their Reliefi who accordingly came up, andaf-
lifted to carry off their Wounded Men : but after
hearing the Relation of thofe that had been in the
Houfe, and calling a fhort Council a little way
from the Door, (which, tho' dark as it was, the
Steward and his Men could perceive from the Win-
jdow,) they all refolved to make off.
There
j)0 7^^ Hiflory and Reality
There was another concurring Accident^whicli
tho' it does not relate to my Subjefl:, I mud fet;
downro compleat the Story, i;/2;.That two of thefe
Granadoes by the Fire oftheir Fuzes fet the Chim-
neys on Firej the third being in a Funnel that had
no Soot in it, the Room having not been fo much
ufed, did not. This Fire flaming out at the top, as
is ufual, was feen by fome Body in the Village,
who run immediately and allarmed the Prieft or
Padre^ and he again rais'd the whole Town, be-
lieving there was fome Mifchief fallen out, and
that the Houfe was fet on Fire.
Had the reft of the Gang not refolvM to make
off, as is faid above, they had certainly fallen into
the Hands of the Townfmen, who ran immediately
with what Arms came next to Hand, to the
Houfe. Bat the Rogues were fledjleaving, as above,
three of their Company dead in the Houfe, and
one in the Field.
I M u s T confefs, I cannot draw many Inferences
to my purpofe from the Particulars of this Story,
which however I have told for your Diversion j
but from the General I may 5 namely. This Apparition
was certainly not in favour of the Robbery 5 and if
all the Particulars are true in Faft as related, we can
hardly with Juftice place them to Satan's Account.
Take him as a Deftroyer and a Father of Mifchief,
he could not be fuppos'd to have appeared to pre-
vent the Robbing the Houfe,or to aflift the Steward
in the Houfe in defence ofhis Mafter's Goods: what
Good Spirit this muft be, and from whence, is then
a remaining Queftion, and that brings it to my
purpofe again.
I SHALL give you another Story out of more
Authentick Records, tho' related in a different
manner by feverai People, as their feveral Interefts
inclin'd them.

JAMES IV. King of Scotland being pei%
fwaded by the Clergy and the Biihops to break
with England^ and declare Waragainft Henry Vfll,
contrary to the Advice of his Nobility and Gentry,
who were to bear both the Expence and the Blows
ofa Battel > Ifay^ the King, thus over-ruled by the
Clergy, raifes an Army, and prepared to march to
the Frontiers s but the Evening before he was to
take the Field, as he was at Fefpers'm the Chappel
Royal at his Palace of Lithgo or Linlithgow^ an an-
ticnt Man appeared to him with a long Head of
Hair ofthe Colour of Amber, (fome Accounts would
reprefent it as a Glory painted round a Head by the
Limners) and of a venerable Afpecb, having on a.
ruflick Drefs, that is to fay, in that Country Lan-
guage, a belted Plaid girded round with a Linnen
Safh. This Man was (as it feems by the Story) per-
ceived by the King before he came clofe up to him,
and before he was feen by any of the People 5 and
the King aho perceiv'd him to be earnellly looking
at him, and at the Noble Perfons about him, as if
defiring to fpeak to him.
After fome little time he prefs'd thro' the
Crowd, and came clofe up to the King, and, with-
out any Bow or Reverence made to his Perfon,
told him with a low Voice, but fuch as the King
could hear very diftindly. That he was fent to him
to warn him, not to proceed in the War which he
had undertaken at the Sollicitation of the Priclls,
and in Favour of the French -^^
and that if he did go
on with it he fhould not profper. He added alfo,
that he fhould abilain from his Lewd and Unchri-
ftian Praftices with wicked Women, for that if he
did not,it would iffue in his Dcftru6lion.
Having delivered his MelTage he immediately
vanifh'dj for tho' his prefling up to the King had
put the whole AfTembly in diforder, and that every
one's Eye was ^:iCd upon him, v/hile he was deli-
vering
«i The Hijiory and Reality
vering his Meflage to the King> yet not one could
fee him any more, or perceive his going back from
the Kingi which put them all into theutmoft Con-
fternation.
The King himfelf alfo was in great Confufion 5
he would fain have bcliev'd the Spcdre was a Man,
and would have fpoken to it again, and would have
ask'd fome Queftions of him. But the People con-
jftantly and with one Voice affirmed that it was an
Angel, and that it immediately difappear'd after the
Meffagewas delivered-, that they plainly fawhimand
felt him thrufting to get by them as he went up,
but not one could fee him go back.
The King upon this was fatisfied that 'twas not
a real Body^but an Apparition > and it put him into a
great Coniiernation, and caufed him to delay his
March a-while, and call feveral Councils of his No-
bility to confider what to do.
But the King being ftill over-perfwaded by
thofe Engines who were cmploy'd by Mon-
fieur La Motte, the French Ambafladorj con-
tinu'd in his Defigns for a War, and advanced after-
wards with his Army to the ^weed^ which was in
•
thofe times the ufaal Boundary ofthe two Kingdoms.
Here the Army refted fome time, and the
King being at Jedburgh^ a known Town in thofe
Parts, as he was fitting drinking Wine very plen-
tifully in a great Hall of the Houfe, where his Head-
Quarters was then held,fuppos'd to be the old Earl
of Morton's Houfe in that Town j the Spedre came
to him a fecond time, tho' not in the Form which
it appeared in at Lithgo^ but with lefs regard or rc^
fpc6t to the Prince, and in an imperious Tone told
him, he was commanded to warn him not to proceed
\x\ that War, which if he did, he fhould lofe not
the Battel only, but his Crown and Kingdom : and
that after this, without ftaying for any Anfwcr, like

ney, and wrote in the Stone over it, or that which
we call the Mantle-piece, the following Diftich,
Ldeta fit ilia dies^ Nefcitur Origo fecundi
Sit labor an refuies^ fie tranftt gloria Mundi.
That the King did not liften to either of thefc
Notices, our Hiftories,as well as Buchanan the Hi-
ftorian of Scotland^ take Notice of very publickly
;
and that he marcht on, fought the Englifij at
Flodden-Field^ and there loft his Army, all his for-
mer Glory, and his Life, isalfo recorded ^ I need
fay no more of it.
These two Apparitions were certainly from fuch
Spirits as we are fpeaking of, viz. fuch as mean
well to Mankind, and being Good and Beneficent
in their Nature, would prevent the ruin or de-
ftru6bion of thofe whom they appear to : But
have not always Power to dired the Meafures, or
to oblige the Perfons to hearken to their Advice.
Had it been a Heavenly Vifion, 'tis more than
probable it would have laid hold of the King's
Hand, as the Apparition of iVngels didtoLo/,and as it
were dragg'd him away, and faid You fhall not go
forward, that you may not be defeated and flain,
both you and your Army.
. Again, had it been the Devil^ or an Appari-
tion from Hell, the MefTage would never have
been for Goodj it would never havewarn'd him to
avoid the Battel, which fliould be fo fatal to him,
and in which fo much Innocent Blood fhould be
fhed to gratify the Priefts, who 'twas not doubted
were brib'd or otherwife influenc'd by France^ and
by which the King fliould be fure to lofe his Life.
The Devil is too great a lover of Mifchief to
concern himfelf in fuch an eminent manner for a
Publick Good 5 too great an Enemy to Mankind to
take the Trouble x,o caution the King twice, and
fend
©4 The Hijiory and Reality
fend, as we may fay, two ExprefTes to him to fave
his Life, and prevent a War 3 nor can wc fuppofe
the Devil concern'd to promote Peace in the
World, but juft the contrary -, 'tis his bufinefs to
Foment Diftraftions, publick Confufions, and
War.
But fhould we fuppofe for once that the Devil
ftandfng Neuter between the two Nations, fhould
go fo far out of his v/ay as to endeavour to keep the
Peace for that time only -, yet what fhall we fay to
the other Part of the Melfage at Lithgo^ viz. That
he fhould abftain from his Lewdnefs, and from his
fcandalous Life, his familiarity with Women, and
^.^,, the like? Did ever the Devil pretend to this in his
*""
Life ? if this cou'd be the* Devil^ then he mufl be
allow'd to a6t very much out of his ordinary Way,
as fome exprefs it 3 'tis not his profefs'd, avow'd
Practice.
What then mufl thefe Appearances be, and
from whence ? And how reafonable is it from all
thefe things to believe, that there are fome other
Spirits which we yet know nothing of, or but very
little, who do fo far concern themfelves for the
good of Mankind, as that they frequently appear
to us to warn us of Danger, to alarm us at the
Approach of Impending Mifchiefj advifing and
cautioning us from evil Courfes, and evil A6tions,
as what is deftrudlive to our prefent as well as fu-
ture Felicity ?
If it be Obje6ted, that f^^me have owned them-
felves to be the Souls of departed Perfons, as of
near Relations, Wives, Husbands, ^c. and have
appear'd in their Liknefs, and even in their Cloathsj
it is anfwer'd, That is no Argument againfl the
thing at all 3 becaufe as Spirits are allow'd in our
prefent Difcourfe to afTume any Shape, fo it is not
doubted but they may take up the Shape of the
Dead as well as of the Living, and may afTume the

all the abfurdities of Souls remaining in a wandring,
unappointed, iinfettled ftate after Lifej which, if ic
fliould be granted, we mull in many things contradict
the Scripture, and thereceiv'd Opinions of all the re-
form'd Churches, and almoil of all good Men even
in all Ages.
CHAP. VII.
Of the many firange Inconveniences and ill
Confequences which would attend us itt
this IVorld^ if the Souls of Men and JVo^
men^ unembodyed and departed^ were at Li-
berty to vifit the Earthy from whence they
had been difmifs'd^ and to concern thefnfelves
. about Human Affairs^ either fuch as had
been their own^ or that were belonging to
other Teo^le.
I
BELIEVE there are few fpeculative Delufi-
ons more univerfally receiv'd than this, that
thofe things we call Spe6tres, Ghoilsj^wi Apparitions,
are really the departed Souls of thofe Perfons who they
are faid to reprefent.
WE fee, or pretend to fee, our very Friends and
Relations adually cloath'd with their old Bodies,
tho' we know thofe Bodies to be emboweird, fe-
parated, and rotthig in the Grave 5 as certainly as the
Head and Quarters ofa Man executed for Treafon are
drying in the Sun upon the Gates of the City : we
fee them drefs'd up in the very Cloaths which we
have cut to pieces and given away, fome to ens body
fome to another, or applied to this or that ufe> fo
that
y6 The flifiory and Reality
that we can give an Account of every Rag of
them : we hear them fpeaking with the fame Voice
and Soundjtho' the Organ which form'd their for-
mer Speech we are fure is perillied and gone.
These Similitudes of things fix ; it upon our
Thoughts, that it muft^ be the fame > that the
Souls of our late Friends are aSrually come to revifit
us > which is to me, 1 confefs, the moft incongruous
and unlikelieft thing in the World.
FIRST^ They muft have a very mean Opinion
of the future State, and the exalted Condition of
the BlefTed, that can imagine they are to be inter-
rupted in their Joy j and even difquieted^ as Samuel
faid to Saul, by the importunities of this World's
Affairs : Why haft thou difquietedme^ to bring me »/>? as
if it was in the Power of a defpicable Witch to
bring him up, for it intimates a Force, whether he
would or not > which does not at all correfpond
with the high Thoughts we are dire£ted to enter-
tain of the perfedt Felicity of that State, of which
Eye has not feen, or Ear heard, or Heart conceived.
SECO ND
L
r, They muft have likewife very
mean Thoughts of the State of everlafting Mifery^
who'can think that the Spirits in Prifoncan getloofe
from thofe determined Chains, to come hither and
attend upon the Trifles of Life 5 nor do I know
whether it would be worth their fhifting Hell, and
coming back to this World in the wandring Condi-
tion thofe Things call'd Ghofls are underftood
to be J or indeed to reaflume a Body,without mak-
ing Life a State of farther Probation. For . what
would Life be here for a few Years fubjedbed to hu-
man Infirmity, want, diftrefs, and cafualty, and no
alteration poflible of their future State, no Hope,
no room for changing the Sentence ? They know
little of that Hell call'd Defpair, that can think it
more fupportable in this World, than the Eterna!
State, which it is a profpe6t of, is in that to come*
of APPARITIONS. 97
But this is too grave abundance for the Timej^
and therefore I fay no more of that Part-, but Irouft
bring the Cafe nearer to our prefent Tafte^ as well
as to our Capacity.
Let us next enquire into the Neceffity of
difturbing or difquieting our departed Friends^
with or about the Concerns of their Families : If ,
their coming is by the Permiflion of Providence,
then I demand what Occadon is there for it ? and
of what Service is it? feeing the fame Providence is
able to employ other Servants of the fame Errand,
and to do the fame Bufinefs, and who will not only
do it as well) but to be fure much better. Ic
is anfwer'd, the Sovereignty of Providence is not to
be difputed, He may do what he pleafes, and em-
ploy who he pleafes: but then the Wifdom of ,
Providence too is not known to aft inconfiftent
with itfelfj and, which is a fufficient Anfwer to all
the reft, we are allowed to judge of all thefe
things by ourreafoning Powers, nor have we any other
Rules to judge byj and it can be no Crime to rea-
fon with calmnefs) and with due refpeft to fuperior
Power, upon the ordinary Adminiftration even of
Heaven itfelf
I'll fuppofe that no Apparitions were allow'd
to fhew themfclves on Earth, but on Occafions of
fomeunufualConfequence, and that then they might
always be expe6ted j and there are many affirm it to be
fo> (tho' I openly fay I do not,) but fuppofe it, I fay 5
and that whenever thefe things have appeared it was
in efpecial Cafes, fuch as of manifeftlyinjur'd Right,
Oppreffion of Widows and Orphans, Wrong done
to Perfons unable to do themfelves Juftice, deprefs'd
Poverty, and many fuch Cafes which Souls are faid
to be anxious about, even after Death 5 I fay, if it
were fo, the World is at this time (and^ perhaps^
has always been) fo full of Violence, Injuftice,
H fraud
9 8 The Hifior^ and Reality
Fraud and Oppreflion, that the Souls oF our depar-
ted Friends would hardly ever be at reft.
How many weeping Widows, ft^mng Or-
phans and opprefs'd Families have in our Age fuF-
ter'd by the lofs of the Money which their Fathers
and other Anceftors left for their Subfiftance and
Eftablifliment in a certain City Chamber, or put
into a certain Exchequer upon the publick Faith
:
According to this Notion, neither the vifible or in-
vifible World would have been at Peace : the habi-
ted vifible World would have been continually
haunted with Ghofts, and we drtiould never have
been quiet for the Diiturbance of Spirits and Appa-
ritions : the invifible World would have been in i
continued Hurry and Uncafinefsi Spirits and Unem-
bodied Souls asking leave to go back again to fee
their Wills rightly perform'd, and to harrafs theii
Executors for injuring their Orphans 5 and all the
Ages of Time would have been taken up in giving
Satisfadtion to them in fuch and fuch Cafes.
I T was the Saying of a Roman^ (indeed, I mean.
a Roman in Religion) that it was a Sign to him.
paft all Difpute, that the Dead could never come tc
the C^ick, becaufe the Teftators of all thofe Cha-
rities given by departed Souls of Saints for the
Maintenance of Hofpitals, Chantries, Colleges.
Churches, and religious Houfes, as well in Money
as in Lands and Inheritances, did not walk, anc
haunt King Hen.NXW^ and pull him not out of his
Throne only, but out of his Grave, for taking a-
way, as he did, all thofe Rents and Revenues, Landi
and Eftates from the religious Houfes to which
they belong'd.
Now if they were not difquieted for fo great a
Piece of Injuftice, why fhould they be forcibly ^i-
fturb'd for Trifles, compared to thofe great Events?
Again, fhould departed Souls get leave to come
bacfe;;p this World, to fee Juftice done to their Fa-
milies
of AP P ARITION S. ^^
milies and Relations, how comes it to pafsthat they
have not done it on fuch frequent Occafions as are
daily given thera in the World ? And why do any
People enjoy peaceably the Eftates which they got
wrongfully ? The Works of Heaven are all perfe6t.
Would he havefent Angels or Spirits to procure Ju-
fiice to be done only in Parr, and not in the Whole?
And how much Arrears is the wicked Part of the
World then in, to the better Part? And which
way is it poffihle Right fhould now be done?
Besides, to go back to publick Things 5 what
Rage, what Violences, Rapins, Ruins, not of Perfons
only, but of Nations, have we feen and heard of in
the World ? and yet we fee Death puts an End to
all Grievance, or Complaints of Grievance whatfo-
cver; the departed Souls reft undifturb'd about it,
Refentment all dies with them 5 and whatever the
Apparitions^ which we call Souls, have pretended,
or we have pretended for them, the Souls them-
felves are perfcftly unconcern'd at it all.
What Apparitions have been, have certainly been
ofthofe blefled Angclick Spirits, who may fo far have
concern'dthemfelves in fome Cafes of Violence, Op-
preiiion, manifeft and atrocious Frauds, to allarm the
Offenders, and thereby bring them to do Right, as
well for their own good as for the Relief of the
opprefsM Sufferers, who, perhaps, have invok'd the
Divine Juftice againil them.
Hence give me leave to obferve, tho' it is flill
alittle ferious, and perhaps you may think it is out of
the way, that 'tis not a thing of the lead Concern
to us to have the Cry of the Poor againft us, or
to have the Widows and Orphans, who we have
injur'd and opprefs'd, look litp to Heaven for Relief
againft us, when they, perhaps, have not Money
to go to Law, or to obtain or feek Remedy againft
us in the ordinary way of Juilice. I had much
lather have an unjuft Enemy draw his Sword upon
H i me.

Tongue it felf, which is fo little under Command,
fubmits to this fovereign Mandate 3 and rho'Ido noc
fee that Confcience always over-rules it to Silence,
yet it often makes it fpeak, even whether it would
or no, and that to its own Ruin and Deilrudion ;
making the guilty Man accufe himfelf, and confefs
what his Policy had before fo effedually conceal'd,
that no Eye had feen it, no Evidence could prove

fees him without Eyes, he is prefent with him

need of other Witnels.
I HAVE heard a Story which I believe to be
true, of a certain Man who was brought to the Bar
of Juftice on Sufpicion of Murther, which how-
ever he knew it was not in the Power of human
Knowledge to deted. When he came to hold up
his Hand at the Bar, he pleaded, Not Guilty^ and
the Court began to be at a Lofs for a Proof, no-
thing but Sulpicion and Circumftances appearing

his Hand, My Lord, fays he, (aloud) that is not
fair, 'tis not according to Law, he's not a legal
Wicnefs.
The Court is furpriz'd, and could not under-
ftand what the Man meant 5 but the Judge, a Man
of more Penetration, took the Hint, and checking
fome of the Court that ofFer'd to fpeak, and which
would have perhaps brought the Man back again

fomething more than we do, 1 begin to underfland
him 5 and then fpeaking to the Prifoner,
Why, fays he^ is not he a legal Witnefs ? I be-
lieve the Court will allow his Evidence to be good,
when he comes to fpeak.
No, my Lord, it cannot be juft, it can't be al-
lowed, y^^-j the Prifoner^ (with a confufed Eagernefs
in his Countenance, that fhew'd he had a bold Heart
but a guilty Confcience.)
^ Why not, Friend, what Reafon do you give
iox il'^ fays the Judge.
My Lord, fays he^ no Man can be allowed to be
Winefs in his own Cafe j he is a Party, my Lord,
he can't be a Witnefs.
But you miil:ake,y^;^j the Judge^ for you are in-
dialed at the Suit of the King, and the Man may
be a Witnefs for the King, as in cafe of a Robbe-
ry on the Highway we always allow the Perfon
robb'd is a good Witnefs j and without this the
Highway-man could not be convicted 5 but we
fhall hear what he fays, when he is examined.
This the Judge fpoke with fo much Gravity,
find fo eafie and natural, that the Criminal at the
Bar anfwer'd, Nay, if you will allow him to be a
good Witnefs, then I am a dead Man : the laft
Words he faid with a lower Voice than the reft,
but withal called for a Chair to fit down.
The
of APPAR ITIO N S.
The Court order'd him a Chair, which if he
had not had, 'twas thought he would have funk
down at the Bar j as he fat down he was obferved
to be in a great Confternation, and lifted up his
Hands feveral times, repeating the Words, a dead
JM^n^ a dead Man^ feveral times over.
The Judi^e, however, was at fome Lofs how to
a6b, and the whole Court appeared to be in a flrange
Confternation, tho' no body faw any thing but
the Man at the Bar 5 at length the Judge faid to
him. Look you Mr. -calling him by his Name,
You have but one way left that I know of, and
I'll read it to you out of the Scripture^ and fo
calling for a Bible he turns to the Book o£jojhua^
and reads the Text, Jojh. vii. ip. jlnd Jofliua faid
unto Achan, my Son, give^ I pray thee^ Glory to the
Lord God of Ifrael, and make ConfeJJion unto him^ and
tell me now ivhat thou haft done^ hide it not from me.
Here the Judge exhorted him to confefs his
Crime, for he faw, no doubt, an Evidence ready to
convi6t him, and to difcover the whole Matter a-
gainft him> and if he did not confefs, Heaven
would, no doubt, fend Witnefs to dete£b him.
Upon this the felf-condemn'd Murtherer burft
out icto Tears and fad Lamentations for his own
miferable Condition, and made a full Confef-
fionofhis Crime 5 and when he had done, gavo
the following Account of his Cafe, as to the Rea-
fons of his being under fuch a Surprize, ^uiz. That
he faw the murther'd Perfon (landing upon the
Step as a Witnefs, ready to be examined againft
him, and ready to fhew his Throat which was cut
by the Prifoner, and who, as he faid, flood flaring
full upon him with a frightful Countenance 5 and
this confounded him: (as well it might J and yec
there was no real Apparition, no Spcdre, no Ghoft
er Appearance, it was all figur'd out to him by
the Power of his own Guilt, and the Agitations of
H 4 his

his Soul, fir'dand furprifed by the Influence of Con-
fcience.
The Soul of the Murther'd Perfon feeks no
Revenge -, all that Part is fwallowed up in the
Wonders of the eternal State, and Vengeance entirely
refign'd to him to whom it belongs j but the Soul
of the Murtherer is like the Ocean in a Tempeft,
he is in continual Motion, reftlcfs and raging > and
the Guilt of the Fad, like the Winds to the Sea,
lies on his Mind as a conftant Preflure, and adds
^o that, (ftill like the Seas) 'tis hurry'd about by its
own Weight, rolling to and again. Motion encrea-
iing Motion, 'till it becomes a meer Mafs of Hor-
rour and Confufion.
I N this diftraded Condition, Confcience, like a
Storm at Sea, ftill breaks over him 5 firft gathers
about him in a thick black Cloud, threatning the
Deaths that it comes loaded with 5 and after hove-
ring about him for a-while, at laft burfts with
Lightnings and Thunder, and the poor fhatter'd
VefTel fuffers Shipwreck, finks, and is ovcr-whelm'd
Jn the Middle of it.
I F Juftice does not overtake him, if he is not
difcover'd and deteded, and brought to publick
Shame, as the Laws of God and Man require 5 How
is he put to the Queftion (fo they call it in Coun-
tries abroad, when Men are put to the Rack to
make them confefs) how is he tortur'd with the
Terrors of his own Thoughts , haunted with the
Ghofts of his own Imagination, and Apparitions
without Apparition? the murther'd Perfon is al-
ways in his Sight, and Cries of Blood are ever in
his Ears j 'till at laft, lefs able to bear the Torture
of Mind than the Punifliment of his Carcafs, he
even dies for feai' of Death, murthers himfelf, and
goes away in Horror 5 or, if Heaven is merciful to
him, delivers himfelf up to Juftice, and dies a Pe-
qitent.
\
of AP P ARITIO N S.
I COULD give many flagrant Inftances of this
enough to crowd up this whole Work, but I have
not room for it 5 take one or two for Examples.
A Gentleman, and a Man in good Circum-
fiances too, committed a Murther in or near St. Pan-
eras Soaper-Lane^ London^ many Years ago > the Mur-
ther was attended with fome very cruel and bar-
barous Circum (lances, fuch as he could not ex-
pcft to be pardoned for, fo he fled, and making
his Efcape into France^ got out of the Reach of
Juflice.
His perfonal Safety was for a- while fo much
Satisfaftion to him, that he did not make any Re-
flexions at all upon the Faftj but after a-while,
he took fhipping from France^ and went over to
Martinico^ where he liv'd feveral Years 5 and even
for two or three Years he carried it off well e-
nough 5 but the firft Shock given to his Soul Was
in a Fit of Sicknefs, when being in Danger of
Death, he faw, as he was between fleeping and wa-
king, the Spedlre, as he thought, of the murther'd
Perfon, juft as in the Poflure when he killed him,
his Wound bleeding, and his Countenance ghaft-
ly> the Sight of which exceedingly terrify'd him,
and at length awaken'd him.
But being awake, and finding it was but a
Dream, and that the murther'd Perfon did not
really appear to him, and, as he caird it, haunt him,
he was eafie as to that Part} but being in a high
Feaver, and believing he ftiouid die, Confcience
began to Hare at him, and to talk to him j he
refifled a long time, but Death approaching, he
grew very pcnfive, tho', as he faid, flill more a-
fraid of dying, than penitent for his Crime.
After he recovered he grew eafie, and began
to forget things again 5 came over to Europe again,
and being at Roan in Normandy^ he dream'd he
faw th^ murthev'd Man again, and that he look'd
frightful
otf The Hijiory and Reality
frightful and terrible 5 and with a threat'ning
Afpeft, and this threw him into a kind of Me-
lancholy, which encreas'd exceedingly j the Spe£tre,«
as he call'd it, coming to him every Night.
But this was not all 5 for now as he dreamed
of it all Night, fo he thought of it all Dayj ie
was, as we fay, before his Eyes continually, his
Imagination form'd Figures to him, now of this
kind, then of that, always relating to the mur-
ther'd Man; fo that, in fhort, he could think of
nothing elfe : And tho' he was fatisfied there was <
no real Ghoft, as he called it, or Apparition, yet
his own terrified Confcience made the Thought
be to him like one continued Apparition, and the
murther'd Man was never out of his Sight.
He was fo reduced by the conftant Agitation
of his Soul, that he was in a very weak Condi-
tion, and in a deep Confumption: But in the midft
of thefe Tumults of his Soul, he had a flrong
Impreflion upon his Mind, that he could never
die in Peace, nor ever go to Heaven, if he did
not go over to England^ and either get the Par-
liament's Pardon (for it was in thofe Days when
there was no King in Ifrael) or that if he could not
obtain a Pardon, that then he fhould furrender into
the Hands of Juftice, and fatisfy the Law with his
Life, which was the Debt he owed to the Blood
of the Man he kilFd, and cou'd no other way be
expiated.
He withftood this as a wild diftradled thing,
and the Fruit of his difturb'd Mind: What, faid
he to himfelf^ ihould I go to England for? to go
there is to GO and DIE> and thefe Words, GO
and DIE, run daily upon his Mind ; But tho' they
came firft into his Thoughts, as an Anfwer to his
other Diflradions, yet they tiwn'd upon him fooa
after, and he dream'd that the dead murcher'd Man
faid to him, GO and DIE; and repeating it faid,
GO
of APPARltlO NS. 107
GO to England and, DIE^ and this folloVv'd him
by Night and by Day, afleep and awake, that he
had ic always in his Ears, GO to England and DIE^
In fhorr, and to pafs over fome Cirumftances,
tho' worth telling, which happen'd to him in
the mean time, he v/as fo continually terrify'd by
the Reproaches of his Confcience, and the Voice
which he thought foUow'd him, that he anfwer'd
it once in his Sleep thusj Well, if it muft be fo,
let me alone, I will GO and DIE.
It was fome time however before he did 5 but at
laft, unable to fupport the Torture of his Mind, he
refolv'd to come over to England^ and did fo: He
landed at Gravefend^ and -there took PafTage in the
Tilt-Boat for London.
When he arriv'd at London^ intending to land
at TVefiminfter^ he took a Wherry at BiUinfgate^ to
carry him through Bridge. It happen'd, that two
Lighters loaden with Coals run foul of the Boat
he was in, and of one another, over-againft ^een-^
Hith^ or thereabouts i and the Watermen were fb
very hard put to it, that they had much ado to a-
void being crufh'd between the Lighters, fo that
they were oblig'd to get into one of the Lighters, ^
and let the Boat fink.
Th I s occafion'd him, contrary to his Defign,
to goon Shorea little to the Eaftward of ^ueen-Hith^
from thence he walk'd up on Foot towards Cheap*
^fide^ intending to take a Coach for Weftminfter.
As he pafs'd a Street, which crofTes out of
Bread-ftreat into Bow-lane^ being almoft Night,
and he not well knowing the Streets, having beca
abfent eighteen Years, he heard fome body cry,
Stop him, flop him ! It feems a Thief had broke
into a Houfe in fome Place, as he pafs'd by, and was
difcover'd, and run for it, and the People after him,
crying Stop him, Stop him
!
It /
io8 T'^^ Hifiory and Reality
It prefently occurr'd to him, that being fo near
the Place where the Murther was committed, and
where he had lived, fome body that knew him had feen
him, and that it was him they cry'd after 5 upon
"which he began to run with all his Might.
Had the People cry'd flop thief^ he had had
no need to be alarm'd, knowing, as he faid, that
he had ftolen nothing j but the Crowd crying only
flop him, flop him^ it was as likely to be him as not}
and his own Guilt concurring, he run, as above,
A s he run with all his Might, it was a good
while before the People overtook him 5 but jufl at
the Corner of Soaper-hne^ near about where now
itands the Rummer "Tavern^ his Foot flipt, and his
Breath failing him too, he fell down.
Th e People, not "knowing who he was, had
loft their Thief, and purfu'd him 5 but when they
came up to him, they found he was not the right
Perfon, and began to leave him 5 but his own
Guilty Confcience, which at firft fet him a run-
ning, and which alone was his realPurfuer, continu-
ing to follow him clofe, and which at laft had thrown
him down too,foencreas'dhis Fright, that believing
they all knew him, he cry'd out, It is very true, I
am the Man, it was I did it.

ning to their Doors, as is ufual in fuch Cafes j I fay,

knew him to be the Murtherer, that kill'd the Man
fo long ago i whereas there was no body there that
had any Knowledge of the Matter, and the very
Memory of the thing was almoft forgotten in the
Place, as it might well be, having been done eigh-
teen Years before. How^
of APPARITIO N S. 105
However, when they heard him cry / am the

and / did it^ one of the People that came a*
bout him faid, What did you do? Why, I kill'd
him, fays he j I kill'd Mr. and then re-
peated his Name J but no body remember'd the
Name.
Why, you are mad, fays one of the People 5 and

Man. They purfu'd a little Shoplifting Thief, and
here they have frighted a poor Gentleman, that they
own is not the Perfon, but is an unhappy diforder'd
Man, and fancy'd they puifu'd after him.
But are you fure he is not the Man?
Sure? fays another j Why, they tell you fo
themfelves. Befides, the Man is diftrafted.
Distracted! fays a third^ how do you know
that?
Nay, fays the other^ he muft be diftrafted, or in
Drink j don't you hear how he talks ? / did it^ I
kiWd him^ and 1 don't know what. Why, here's
no body kill'd, is there? I tell you the poor Man is
craz'd. Thus they talk'd a-while, and forne run
forward towards Cheap-fide^ to look for the real
Thief, and fo they were about to let him go. But one
grave Citizen, and wifer than the reft, cry'd, nay
hold^ let's enquire a little further -^ tho' he's not the
Thief they look for, there may he fomething in it\
let us go before myhord Mayor with him: andfo they
did. 1 think the Lord Mayor then in Being, was
Sir William 'Turner.
When he came before the Lord Mayor, he
voluntarily confefs'd the Fa6t, and was afterwards
executed for it: and I had the Subftanceof this Re^
lation from an Ear-witnefs of the thing, fo that I
can freely fay that I give entire Credit to it.
It was remarkable alfo, that the Place where
this Man fell down when he run, believing he was
purfued and known, tho' at firft he really was not,
was
ii(S The Hijlory and Reality
was juft againft the very Door of the Houfe where
the Perfon liv'd that he had murther'd.
Many Inferences might be drawn from this
Story, but that which is particularly to my Pur-
pofe5is,to fhew how Men's Guilt crowds their Ima-
gination with fudden and furprizing Ideas of things 3
brings Speftres and Apparitions into their Eyesj
when there are really no fiich things ; forms Ghofts
and Phantafms in their very View, when their Eyes
are fhut: They fee fleeping, and dream waking; the
Night is all Vifion, and the Day all Apparition^
'till either by Penitence or Punifhment they make
Satisfa6tion for the Wrong they have done, and
cither Juflice or the injur'd Perfon are appeafed.
But to bring all this back to our Bufineft
:
here's no other Apparation in all this, than what
are form'd in the Imagination 5 the Ghofts, the
Souls of the moft injur'd Perfon, whether injuri-
oufly murther'd, or injurioufly robb'd and plun-
dered, fleeps in Peace, knows nothing of the Mur-
therer or Thief, except only that it gives that Part
all up to the Eternal Judge : the Murtherer has the
Horror of the Fa6b always upon him, Confcience
draws the Pifture of the Crime in Apparition juft
before him, and the Reflc£tion, not the injur'd
Soul, is the Spedre that haunts him: Nor
can he need a worfe Tormenter in this Lifej whe-
ther there is aworfc hereafter, or no, I do not pre-
tend to determine. This is certainly a Worm that
mver dies-y 'tis always gnawing the Vitals, not of
the Body, but of the very Soul —But I fay, here
was no Apparition all this while of any kind, no
Spedre, no Ghoft, no not to dete6t a Murtherer.
1. No Devil or Evil Spirit; as for Satan^ he
wotild rather prote^b, or at leaft fhelter him, thac
he might commit another Murther.
2. No Soul of the deceafed, however injur'd
5
the Man acknowledg'd he never faw any real Ap-^
parition. What

of APP ARITIONS. in
What was it then the Man was exercis'd with ?
I anfwer, he was harrafs'd by the ReflcQrion of his
own Guilt, and the Sluices of the Soul were fee
oprcn by the Angels or Spirits attending, and who
by Divine Appointment are always at hand to ex-
ecute the vindiftive Part of Juftice, as well as the
more merciful Difpenfations of Heaven, when they
have them in Commiffion.
These abandon'd him to the Fury of an en*
rag'd Confcience, open'd the Sluices of the Soul, as
i call them, and pour'd in a Flood of unfufferable
Grief, letting loofe thofe wild Bealts cali'd Paffions
upon him, fuch as Rage^ Anguijh-i Self-reproach^
too late Repentance^ and final Defperation^ all to fall
upon him at once 5 fo the Man runs to Death for
Relief, tho' it be to the Gallows, or any where,
and that even by the meer Confequcnce of Things.
But if then Oppreflion, Injury, Robbery, and
even Murther it felf, will not bring the departed
injur'd Soul back in Ghoft or Apparition 5 if whea
it is once Uncas'd, Difmifs'd, or Unembodied, its
Scare is determined, and that it can receive no fuch
Impreffions as to be difquieted afterwards, much
lefs brought back hither to haunt or perplex the
Perfons left behind, what then fhall we fay ?
How then can we think they fhould come back
for Trifles, namelefs Trifles, or Trifles not v/orch
naming ? and what are we to call thofe real Appa-
ritions which we have Reafon to believe are, and
frequently have been feen in the World? what are
they, nay, what can they be, but thefe Angels or
Spirits, call them what you will, who inhabit, of
have their Station in the great Void or Waft? who
have the Guard, not of our Atmofphere only, nay
not of the Solar Syftem only, tho' that is of Immenfe
^nd Inconceiveable Extent, and full of diftant Pla-
netary Worlds, but even of the whole Syftem of
the Creation, the Syftem oi Empy Space.
These
Ill The Hiftory and Reality
These may, and no doubt do vific us ev'ery
Day, whether they are vifible to us or no j theif
Bufinefs is among us, they are pofted in their
Station as defcrib'd, on purpofe to take Cogni-
zance of us, and of things belonging to us, and done
by us.
I F Murther, Rapine, and Oppreffion is exercis'd
upon any, thefe frequently, if not always, concern
themfelves, either to dcteo: it, or to bring the Of-
fender to Juftice, or both, efpecially in Cafes of
'
Blood : And this is the beft way we can account
for the Difcovery of Murther, which is fo general,
that it is our received Opinion, that Murther very
feldom goes undifcover'd; that Murther will
Gut^ that is, will come out to be known and
punifhed.
If inftead of faying Murther very feldom goes un*
difcovefd^ they had {zid feldom goes unpumjh'dj I be-
lieve it might have been univerfally true 5 for fome-
times fecret Murthers are never difcover'd to the
Perfons who knew of the Fad, or in the Place
where it was committed : but how are they purfu'd
by the Divine Vengeance, that is to fay under the
Miniftry of thefe happy Inftruments, who fail not
to purfue the Murtherer? perhaps it may be the only
Cafe wherein they are Agents of Juftice, without a
mixture of Mercy.
How many fecret, and 'till then undifcover'd
Murthers do thefe happy Inftruments oblige the
guilty Wretches to difcover, which no Human
Eye had been Witnefs to ? Some are difco-
ver'd, as in the Example above, and brought to
Puniftiment: Some at the Gallows, whither the
Criminal is brought for other Crimes 5 fome upon
fick Beds, and in View of Eternal Judgment > fome
in Shipwrecks, fome in Battels, fome one way,
fome another.

Nor can it be deny'd, that tho' thefe angclick
miniftring Spirits were to be conftant Meflbngers
of Juftice in fuch Cafes, yet it would be much
more merciful than to give the Soul of the injur'd
murther'd Perfon leave to come back arm'd with
Power, and with thcTerrors ofits invifible State,to do
it felf Juftice, inflam'd with the Refentments which
it might be reafonable to fuppofe it muft have at
the Injury received, able to tear the Murtherer in *
Pieces, and in Condition to carry on its own Quar-
rel, and execute the Divine Jultice,^in revenge of
its private Quarrel.
1. This would be inconfiftent with the fu-
preme Prerogative of Heaven, by which he has
taken all executive Juftice into his own Hand, all
Retribution, all retaliating Juftice 5 and that on
purpofe to reftrain the Rage and Fury of Men,
who would be unbounded in the vindictive Part,
and fct no Limits to their Vengeance j which for
that very Reafon, I fay, God has declar*d he takes
into his own Hand 5 Vengeance /j Mi n e, / will re*
pay. Rom. xii. ip.
2. I F it were not thus, the World would be a
Field of Blood and Confufion, the departed Soul
of a murthered Perfon would be always harrafling,
not the Murtherer only, butallthePerfonsconcern'd
in his Injury 5 and without Mercy would call every
one a Murtherer, that was on the fide of his Ene-
my, whether guilty or not 5 in a word, fuppofe he
dy'd fighting, he would come back to revenge his
own Death, fir'd with a double Rage, and arm'd
with an irrefiftible Ability to revenge.
But not to confine my felf to the Cafe of a
Murtherer only 5 If Souls after Death could re-
turn to vifit thofe who they had any Concerns
with here, let the Occafion be what it would, the
World would be all Confufion and Diforderj Quar-

And how do we know that they would, even
in that enlightned State of Being, be impartially
juft, confidering they would a6t in their own
Caufes ? Are we fure they would not infill upon
pretended Right, as they did perhaps when living?
if fo, then we muft have Appeals even from thC'
Spirits themfelvesifor they would be as liable to do
Injury in their Revenge, as thofe ycc living had
been to do to them.
Here we might make a rational Excurfion up-
on the prefent State of Things : What would be the
cafe, if all the injur'd Souls now in a determined
State, were able to come back, and demand Juftice
of the prefent Age ? what work would it make a-
niong us ? how many wealthy Landlords would be
turn'd out ofPofreffion,and rich Tradefmen oblig'd to

Refentment ; the OpprefTed and the OpprefTor reft

moft inveterate Enemies 5 the conquered in Battel,
and the Slain of the conquering Army, make one
heap of quiet and peaceable Duft,blcnded together,
and mould'ring into the common Element of

A L L the Animofity, being fled with the enrag'd
Souls,carries with it the very remains of the Quarrel,
and they no more appear Enemies, but freely encor-
porate their Duft with one another. The late D.

Souls of the noble Enemies would never have
concerned themfelves again with the Quarrel.

to take from both the power of determining any

oblig'd them mutually to refer the further enquiry
to himfelf.
The tvjo Danijh Soldiers who fought at B&-
verly^ one kilPd upon the fpot,and the other imme-
diately fhot to Death for fighting, and buried to-
gether > there they lie quiet in one Grave, the
Souls of them never vifit one another, to complain
of the Injury.
Could Souls departed come back to demand
Redrefs of Grievances, and to put Men in mind of
the Injuftice done them j could they challenge the
living PofleiTors of their Eftates for the Frauds by
which they were obtained j what Confufion would
Exchange-Alley and the Exchange of London be in?
"what diftradion would it make in all the Affairs of
Life? and how foon would the Men who amafs'd
immenfe Wealth, Ann. 1720, difappear, like /^
—
of Hack ,and fink under the guilt of their good
Fortune ?
1 N a word, it would invert the Order of Eter-
nal Juftice, for it would make this Earth be the
Place of Rewards and Punifhments, and take the
Executive Power out of the Hands of the great
(jovernour of the World.
Depend then upon it, the Souls of our de-
parted Friends, or Enemies, are all in their fix'd and
determin'd State > whether arriv'd at a full Confum-
mation of Felicity or Mifery, that is not the cafe,
nor is it any part of the Queltion 3 but they are fo
rcmov'd from all poflibility of return Hither, or
concern with us, that the very Suggeftion, however
it has for many Ages prevail'd in the World, is full
of Abfurdity. The Joys of the Happy are fo com-
pleat, fo exalted, fo fuperior, that the greateft Af-
fairs of this World are too trifling, to take up the

a vaft Eftate left him in his immediate Pofleffion,
quits his decay'd out-of-repair Cottage upon the
Wafte, and having his Hands full of Goldj'^or even
Bags of Gold, fcorns to take up the Rags and Rub-
bifh of his old dirty Habitation 5 but fays to his
Servants, Let any one take 'em that will, i have
enough here.
On the other hand, the reje6ted and condemn'd
Soul, loaded with his own Crime, and finking un-
der the Weight of inexprcffible Horror 5 {hall he
have any thought about the hated World he came
out of! he who abhors and hates the place where he
fpent a long Life of fuch Crime, as now loads him
with infupportable Punilhment, is he at leifure,
or in compofure for concerning himfelf in Life any
more, where he has already fo miferably ruin'd him-

I F he was to come back hither for any thing,
it would probably be to take the heaps of his ill-
gotten Treafure from the unjuft Pofleflbr, his
Heir j and making reflitution with it to the Poor,
whom he had opprefs'd, to the Widows he had
robb'd, and in general to all thofe he had injur'd,

their Robes and Velvet j and in Hofpitalsand Alms-

A s to what Rell; the Souls of thofe departed
would have, I am not to refolve 5 but I doubt the
Souls and Bodies too of thofe that remain, would
have fmall Reft here, if that were true.
Is it not rather a Proof that the Soul cannot re-
turn hither, to do Right to the injur'd race of
thofe whom it had opprefs*d with Violence, wheii
embodied, that the Ghoft or Soul of fleeps
in its abfent State, and does not call upon his too
happy Heir, and charge him to make reparation in
its Name, for all the Ravages and Plunder, out of
which he rais'd thofe MiUions he left behind ? If
Ufury, Extortion, Perjury and Blood are Injuries
that difquiet the Souls unembodied, How is it
that the Souls of all the Families, and even Nati-
ens of Families opprefs'd and ruin'd by the late —^^-
do not come and do themfelves right out of thp
immenfe Wealth, left in pofTeffion to thofe, who,
'till that Juftice be obtain'd, could have no Clainx
to it ?
But to let the Injur'd and the Injurious fleep
together, as they do, without difturbing or being
difturb'd by one another, let us ask a few Queftions
of the living ? How would a certain wandring
[
Right Honourable, moft fimply elevated Object of |
human Pity, be terrified at the Apprehenfions of |
meeting the difhonour'd Souls ofhis Anceftors ? and i
particularly of his pious Grandfather, who would
if it were poffible chaftife him for his Lunacy, and
drive him home to the Feet of a merciful Sovereign,
to ask Pardon for the moft prcpofterous things that
ever humane Rage drove any Man in his Senfes to
be guilty of

the plentiful Fortunes they left them, by the moS
ridiculous and utterly improbable Scheme of the late

humane Probability j and for which, as the late happy
Lord Derwentwater laid, they fhould not have been

J F Souls could return, how fhould our Friends

their Beds,while they enjoy the ruins of fo many Fa-
milies, and the fortunes of fo many Sufferers, who
hang'd themfelves in Defperatiori for the lofs? and
why do they not fee Apparitions every Night from the

'//« —and a thoufand morej who, could they re-
pals the Gulph, would certainly harrafs them, 'till
they ihould be glad to difmifs themfelves the fame
way, and run to that Hell which they know no-
thing of, from that Hell of Self-reproach, which
they would be no longer able to endure ?
1 GOULD defcend to Particulars, 'till I fill'd a
Roll too long for your readings and I know not
whether it might not be true, as Sir /^ B d
faid in another cafe, that he believ'd all would come
Up that was under Ground, and his Grandfather
would come with the reft and call for his Eftate again.
The Doftrine of difquiet Souls returning hi-
ther, to do or obtain Juftice, to make or demand
Reftitution, and that they could not be at reft 'till
fuch and fuch things were fettled. Wills perform'd,
difpoftefs'd Heirs righted, conceal'd Treafons difco-
ver'd, conceal'd Treafures found out, and the like,
were it true, would make the World uninhabitable
:
Ghofts and Apparitions would walk the Streets at
Noon-Day j and the living might go on one fide
of the Street, and the dead on the other j the
latter would be infinitely more numerous.
I 4 Would
no The Hifiory and Reality
Nothing can be more propofterous than
fuch a Notion. It is true, that the examples given,
or pretended to be given, of it, are but few, and
that very part is againft them 5 for if the thing is
real, why are they but few ? It muft be acknow-
ledged, as the times go, the cafes of the injured and
opprefs'd are not few: On the contrary, as God
faid of the old World, the whole Earth is fiU'd
with Violence. Whence is it then, ifinjur'd Souls,
or the Souls of injur'd, opprefs'd, ruin'd People
could return, that there are not Millions haunting
the Doors, nay the Clofets and Bed-Chambers, of
thofe that enjoy the Wealth which was fo unjuftly
obtain'd ?
I F it could be at all, the Number would be in^-
finitely more j for why fhould one guilty Soul be
uneafy^and not another? All the guilty would come
back to make Reftitution as far as they were able,
and all the Sufferers would come back to obtain ^
it.
Again, the Condition ofthofe that enjoy the ill-
gotten Wealth of their Anceftors would be deplo-
rable ; the Souls of guilty Parents would harrafs
their Sons for the Eftate, to make Reftitution > and
the Soi»''^ of the opprefs'd Sufferers would haunt
them, to get their ownreftor'd: fo that they only
"Would be eafy in the World, who had nothing to
reftore, or who enjoyed nothing but what was of
their own getting > they only would fleep at Night
who had ballanc'd with the Day, who had earn'd
what they Eat, and had Eaten no more than they
earn'd.
But this we fee is not the cafe: that the Souls
of the moft guilty remain where they are, and the
Souls of the moft opprefs'd do not come hither to
complain, ftrongly implies, and is to me a fufficicnc
proof, that their State is detcrmin'd; that the
Gulph is fixed } that they can only look back with
Self^
of AP PAR iriO NS. Ill
Self- Reproach, but cannot comeback to give them-
felves the Satisfaction of doing Juftice to thofe they
have injur'dj that the murther'd Perfon cannot
come back, no, not to deted the Murtherer^ or
the plunder'd Traveller to difcover the Highway-
man. It is plain to me, and will pafs for Evidence,
that they cannot, becaufe they do not 5 and 'tis plain
to me that fome do not, becaufe all do not 5 for if
any, why not all ?
1 T does not confifl: with the inlightned Juftice of
that State which we believe is beyond Life, to let
one injured Soul come hither to obtain Juftice a-
gainft the Oppreffor of his Family, and not let ano-
ther have the fame Liberty 5 or to let one injuri-
ous Soul return to make Reftitution, and make his
Peace, that he may be at Reft, as they call it 5 and
lock up another from it, who would be equally
willing to do it, and is equally miferable in the
want of if.
That it is not fo, is a fufficient Teftimony to
me that it cannot be foj and the miferable Con-
dition the World would be in here, if it were (oy
makes it clear to me that the Wifdom of Provi-
dence has otherwifc determined it.
'
Nor would the Advantage beany thing con-
fiderable, at leaft not in proportion to the Difor-
der it would bring along with it j and were we to
allow the Poflibility, it would bring in fo many
Abfurdities with it in Points of Religion, that it
would deftroy the eftabliih'd Do6irines of all Reli-
gion : For Example,
FIRSr, We believe that the final Eftate of the
Soul is determined with Life, and as the 'Tree falls
fo it muft lie -, that This is the State of Tryal^ That the
State of Retribution : If fo then, to what purpofe
fhould the Souls of the Dead defire to come back,
unlefs they were to have a farther Probation, or
that there was a Poflibility of retrieving their State,
8 and
Ill The Hifiory and Reality
and recovering from the Sentence they were under ?
and if the divine Wifdom had left room for thati,
it would have as wellfpared them la Life 'till it haq
been done.
SECONDLTy To what Purpofe fhould xh^
Soul come back to do Juftice, if doing that Juftic©
could make no Alteration of its future State? If i^
could make any Alteration, then there muft bos
room after Death to recover the Soul from eternaj
Death 5 and if there was, the Eyes may be fup-
pofed to be fo open'd there, that none would omiti
or negled it.
I'HIRDLT^ If coming hither, or doing Ju-
llice here, can be no Help to the Souls departed,
and yet they defire it, you muft then fuppofe
flrong Defire of doing difinterefted Good may poC
fefs the Souls of thofe who are in a State of Con*
damnation i which is inconfiftent with the othei
Circumftanccs of Hell, which we have juft Rea^
fon to believe fliuts out all good Defires, and al
good Principles, from the Souls that are there.
FOUR fHL r. The Suppofition of Souls beinj
in a Condition after Death to return hither, deftroy
all the Defcriptions which the Scripture gives us o-
the future Condition, either of the good or bac
Souls: but that I hinted before.
Upon the whole, 'tis a Notion, however I
may have been received here, perfeftly inconfiftent
with cither Reafon or reveal'd Religion > and I maj
venture to fay it cannot be, 'tis impofiible, and tha^
all the Pretences of a Ghoft or Apparition faying 11
is fuch a Perfon, and that it cannot be at Ref

THE affirming, as in the foregoing Chapters,
that the unembodied Souls of Men do not ap-
pear again, or concern themfelves in the Affairs of
Life; that the Good would not if they could, and
:he Bad could not if they would j does not at all de-
Iroy the Reality of the thing calPd Apparition, or
io I pretend to argue from thence that there is no
iich thing as any Apparition at all : on the contra-

as the Apparition of Spirits ; and this I think I
have already prov'd paft the Power of any Scruple
or Cavil, as alfo that there have been fuch things
in all Ages of the World.
The Dodrine of the Exiftence of Spirits is c-
ftabliihed in Nature j where thofe Spirits refide, is
Matter of Difficulty, and our Speculations are va-
rious about them \ but to argue that therefore
there are none, that they exift not, [that there are
no fuch Beings, is abfurd, and contrary to the Na-
ture of the thing j we may as well argue againft the
Exiftence of the Sun when it is clouded and eclips'd,
tho' we fee its Light, only becaufe we cannot fee
its Beams, or the Globe of^ its Body ; But let us go
back to the Principle.
S p I R I T, ^j /? is to he confidefd here, is to be re-

'^^ Hl^ory and Reality
FIRST^ The Author of all Spirit^ the Fountaii
of all Being, the Original Caufe of Life, and th(
Creator both of Spirit and of all the Subfequents o
it. This we juftly adore, as the Infinite Eternal Spi
ui:GOD 'is a SPIRIT.
SECONDLT, Angels or good Spirits j whicl
are real Spirits, we have Demonftration of it, anc
they have and do appear daily, as the great Autho
of all Spirit directs, for the Service of Mankind, fo
they are miniftring Spirits,
THIRDLT^ Devils or evil Spirits 5 thefe an
really Spirit too, of a fpirituous Nature j 'tis tru(
they are deprived of their Beauty, their Origina
Glory, becaufe deprived oftheir Innocence 5 they an
deform'd as well as defil'd by Crime, but they are no
deprivM of their Nature j they are Spirits ftill, tho
caft down and caft out, and are call'd wicked Spirits
FOUR'THLT,, Souls of Men, whether gooc
or bad 5 their Condition may be as you pleafe tc
fpeak of it, Happy or Unhappy ; the Cafe is th(
fame, it docs no way alter their Nature, but flil
they are Spirits. The Spirits ofjujl Men made perfect-,
there's the happy Spirits: the Spirits in Prifon
and there's the unhappy 5 but both are Spirits, anc
are to be difcours'd of as fuch in this Place.
Now let us bring all this down to our prefenl
Purpofe. I have afterted their Beings let me en-
quire into their State^ as it refpeds our Subjefbj
how far they may or may not, can or cannot ap-
pear among Men, in their prefent Circumfiances.
How they have vifitcd this Earth at feveral Times,
and on what Occafions, has been mentioned alrea-
dy, and as much at large as the defign'd Brevity of
this Work admits of.
I T remains to enquh'e what we have to expeft
of them for the future, and in particular, who we
may expert to fee at any time hereafter j which of
them may vifit us for the time to come, and which
may
of APPARITIONS. i2y
nay not, or can not be reafonably expeded j and
s:his I fhall do with the fame Clearnefs if poffible,
find in very few Words.
Of the four Kinds of Spirit, then, letusconfidcr
the Firft and the Laft.
FIRS'T^ GOD, the Soul and Life, the Being
)f all Spirit^ has appear'd, as I have faid j but we
ire to expeft him no more : I do not fay he can-
lot appear to us, but I believe I may fay he has
determined to blefs the World with no more fuch
glorious Exhibitions, no more perfonal Appear-
mces of the Eternal Face, 'till the moft glorious
'Appearance fpoken of in Scripture, Tit. ii. 15.
i
Looking for the blejfed Hope and the glorious appear-
ng of the GREAf GOD
SECONDLT^ The difmifs'd, departed, un-
j
embodied Spirits, which we call Souls of Men,
'
whether happy or miferable, can by no means ap-
I pear among usj all Apparition of that Kind is ficbi-
;ious and imaginary 5 never was prafticable, except
Dnce by Miracle, and never can again be prafti-
.:able, and therefore is not to be expeded. We are
:old indeed, that once, on the extraordinary Occa-
Gon of the Rcfurredion of Chrift, and to honour
ithat Refurre6tion with a Miracle of the moft fu-
blime Nature, the Graves were opened^ and the Bodies
ifthe Saints arofe and appeared, ^c. The Word is they
'/frofe, and came out of their Graves after his Re-
furrcdion, Mat. xxvii. f^. I might enlarge upon
the Nature of this Apparition of the Saints which
flept 5 the manner of it, and efpecially the Reafon
of it, and fhew you how it was really miraculous,
and done to convince the doubting Difciples of the
Truth of the Refurredion, which fome of them,
being perhaps originaly Sadduces, might ftill que-
ftion i but my Bufinefs is with an Age not too much
delighted in ferious Excurfions, fo I muft not make
any Trefpafs, however feafonable, or turn grave,
however ufcfuL Let
i6 The Hijiory and Reality
Let it then be fuffieient to the Purpofc, thi
Apparition of Souls was extraordinary and mira
culous, and we are to expeft them no more 5 thei
State is determined, the happy are too happy, an
their Happinefs too firmly fix'd, to fufFer any fuc
Interruption 5 the Unhappy have their Confine
ment too firmly fix'd, to break Prifon, and ge
out 5 in a word, thefe cannot, and the other woul
hot if they could 5 and we are not to cxpeft t
fee or hear from them any more on this Earth
'till the Reftitution of all things, and 'till the
iliall be all fummon'd to that grand Appearance, whic
we believe will one Day happen, whatever 01
flaming Age pretend to fay to the contrary.
All Apparition then of thefe two Heads c
Species being concluded impoffible in Nature, an
Jiot to be expected, we muft look for it then i
mong the Angelick Spirits j and here indeed it is t
be found : Angels of all the Kinds have appear'c
may and do appear, and of them alone are all i\
Apparitions, which have any Reality in them, form'(
This is bringing the Matter into a narrow
Compafs, and putting an end to Cavil and Quai
rel about it j there is no need to wrangle upc
it any morej but when you at any time fc
an Apparition, or Appearance of Spirit aflumin
Shape and Voice, and you are furc it is really a
Apparition, not a Deceptio Fifus^ a Cloud, a V;
pour of the Imagination 5 I fay, whenever you fc
fuch an Apparition, depend upon it 5 'tis an Ange
or a Devil.
I HAVE only one DIftinftion to make hen
which tho' it be neceflary, fhall be very fhort ar
clear, viz. That when I fpeak of Angels I mu
be underjftood as follows,
FIRST, The Word Angel is to be underftoc
of good Angels j for the Devils, as I have faid, ai
alfo Angels : Satan is called an Angel qf Light
bi
of APPARITIONS. \if
but the evil Angels I fliall always treat v/ith their
new Sirname, Devih, fo that when 1 fpeak of An-
gels, I am always to be undcrilood of the good
Angels.
SECONDLY, But of good Angels, thefe I di-
ftinguiih alfo into two Kinds;
(I.) The Angels which are aftually in Hea-
ven, fuch as we read of, Gabriel^ Michael, and
others not diftinguifhed by Name 5 thefe have ap-
peared amongft Men, upon this Earth, as I have
i
alfo faid before at large j but even thefe, we have
I
Reafon to believe, we fhall fee no more > God having
I
pleafed to difcover himfelf to his People now in a-
I
nother Way, by another Miniftration, namely, by
I
his Spirit, and by an Evangelick, not an Angelick
Miniftry.
(z.) That Rank of Angels or Spirits, call
them as we pleafe, (and whether inferior or not,
; we are not to determine,) who are placed by
j
the Direflrion of God himfelf in a nearer Situation
[j
to us 5
placed, I fay, by their Maker, under his fu-
j
perior Providence, for the Direftion and Condu6t
of human Creatures, and of their Affairs, or at lead
to Guard them from the Invafions, Threatning,
and Hellifh Defigns of the Prince of Darknefs and
his Angels i and thefe, as I faid, might well becall'd
Guardian Angels to the whole Earth.
Now, thefe two forts of Spirit, viz. the Guar-
dian Angels, the good Spirits detach'd, as I may
and did call it, from Heaven, to have the Infpedion
over, and Care of his new Creation, as well here
as elfewhere; thefe, and the Devils, that other fore
of Angels, of whom I may have Occafion to fpealc
(more than a great deal) in this Work ^ Thefe, I fay,
may, and do appear, and all Apparition is really be-
tween them 5 all Spirit you can fpeak of, or pretend
to fee the Appearance of, muft be one of thefe two,
muft be Jngel or Devil, there is no other, there
caQ
1 28 The Hifiory and Reality
can be no other: Miracle, and fomething more than
miraculous, and Things which we have no Reafon
to look for, only excepted.
But on the other hand, as certain as that no o-
ther Spirit does, or can, and as certainly as they
do not, or cannot appear > fo as certain, and paft
difpute is it, that thcfe Spirits, both good and bad,
do appear to us upon all Occafions -, I mean all
Occafions which they judge needful, and which,
happens to them, whether by choice or conftraint.
It is not indeed in us to determine how they are
mov'd to go upon thefe Errands, or in what man-
ner 5 I may perhaps give fome probable Opinions
about the Manner and Caufes both of their Miffion.
and Permiffionj for I take thofe two Heads to con-
tain the Regulation of their Aftings j I fay Commtf-
fion and Permijjion^ and without thefe we are fure
never to be vifited in this manner, either by one or
other.
I T is true that this gives a confiderable San6bio»
to the Thing call'd Apparition in general, and
makes it appear to be more folemn than we are
willing to make its for by this Rule, neither De-
*vil or Angel appears but upon fome extraordinary
Occafionj and if it be fo, I do not fee why we
fhould like it the worfej for if they were to ftiew
themfelves upon every trifling Occafion, they
would either terrifie Mankind fo as to make the
World intollerable to him, or famiharife themfelvcsi
fo as not to be regarded.
Now as it would be the Devil^ not the good
Spirits, that would thus haunt the World upon
Trifles J (for the other cannot be fuppofed to do it)
fo they would carry on the Familiarity too far, and
Men would be fo far from being frighted and ter-
rified at him, that in fliort there would be more
Danger in the Intimacy 5 and, as we fliy in another
Cafe,,
of AP P ARiriO^S. ijp
Cafe, Mankind and the Devil might be too well
acquainted.
But firft to the Fad, that thefe Spirits, both
good and bad, D o thus A p p e a r j and then to the
Reafon of it. That they do appear, the Hiflory,
Experience, and Report of all Ages confirm it^
they always have, and ftill do. The Appearances of
Spirits are confirmed many ways, Hiftory is full of
Examples > and facred Hiilory itfelf, tho' it does not
give Relation of particular Apparitions, yet con- •
firms the thiiig, as a Reality, and out of Queftion*
Christ himfelf, after his Refurreftion, feeing
his Dilciples frighted and terrified at his Appearance,
takes a great deal of Pains to convince them that
he was not a Spirit or an Apparition, as they feared :
Luke'Kxiv. yj. T'hey were terrified and affrighted^ and
fuppos'd that they had feen a Spirit. This would be
what it is too diihonourable to fay of the facred
Writ, if Apparition of Spirit in the Shape of Bo-
dy did never come, and that there were no fuch
thing in Nature.
See then what our blefled Lord fays to them
upon it, v, 3 p. Behold my Hands and my Feet^
that it is Imyfelf: handle me^ and fee -^ for a Spirit hath
not Flefi and Bones, as ye fee me have. This is as
dire6b and pofitive as any thing of its kind can
be fuppos'd, or defir'd to be. If there were no
fuch things as Spirits appearing, how could Jefus
Chrift have exprefied himfelf in fuch a manner ? the
Language is plain, You think you fee a Spirit, that
is an Apparition, and you may have fome Reafons
for your Apprehenfion, becaufe I came in thus un-
feen, when the Door was ihut : Now a Spirit
may indeed aflume a Shape, and look like the Per-
fon it appears for j but if you were to come near
to it, you would find a Spirit, an Apparition, has
only the Appearance, it has not Flejh and Bones as
ijo The Hijlory and Reality
you fee me have : Therefore 1 am not a SpeElre or
Apparition^ but a real Body.
So when he came walking upon the Sea to his
Difciples, and they were fo frighted that they cried
out, believing that they had feen a Spirit 5 it muft
be out of Queftion that there were fuch things, and
that they, the Difciples, had heard of them 5 nay,
perhaps, they had feen fuch Apparitions themfelves
before that 5 why elfe fhould they be fo frighted as
to cry out, Matth, xiv. 26. And when the Difciples
faiv him walking on the Sea^ they were troubled^ fay"
ing^ It is a Spirits and they cried out for fear. And
why, when our Saviour fpoke to them, did he not
reprove them for being frighted at their own Ima-
gination, and fancy, (like Children,) that they faw a
Spirit, when there were no fuch things in the
World, and no Apparitions to be feen?
On the other hand he fpeaks kindly to them,
knowing that Apparitions are frightful Things to
^People not ufed to fee them, and bids them be of
good Cheerj it is not a Spirit, it is /, he not afraid -^
'tis no Apparl^'on, but myfelf in reality. So alfo
you have the Story, Mark vi. fo.
Again, you have a perfe£t Defcription of an
Apparition in the very manner we are jull now
difcourfing about it, Job iv. if, 16. 'Then a Spirit
pajfed before my Face^ thh Hair of my Flejh foodup. It
fioodjiill^ but I could not difcern the Form thereof: an
Image was before mine Eyes^ there was ftlence^ and I
heard a Voice. Eliphaz was a Man of Senfe, he was
not deluded to fpeak of Things not in Being, he
faw an Apparition, not a Fancy.
Again, Jojhua faw an Apparition, as I mention'd
once before, Jofi. v. 1:5. A Man with a drawn
Sword in his Hand, This was an Angel, that is to
fay a Spirit, and yet it fpoke to him, and had the
Shape of a Man in Arms, with a Sword in his
Hand.
of APPARITIONS. 131
Hand. Had Jojhua ofFer'd to touch it, or been per-^
mitted to touch it, he would not have found it had
Flejh and Bones -y we have our Saviour's Words for
it, A Spirit has not Flesh and Bones; an Ap-
parition is a Spirit afluming a Shape of Fleih and
Blood, but without the Reality.
And this Anfwers all thole fanciful People who
fay to us, that they faw fuch or fuch a Perfon : I
faw him, fays the Ignorant frighted Vifionift, per-
feftly! I know him well enough! I am fure 'twas
him ! I faw him plainly ! Hence they conclude ic
muft be the Soul of fuch a Perfon, becaufc, fay
they, it had his very Countenance and his Cloaths
on : nay, riding on the fame Horfc as he us'd to ride
on : when the truth of the Cafe is this, the Man is ^
dead, his Body rotting in the Grave, his Soul car-
tied into the remote Regions of eternal Felicity
or Horror unalterable, and that immoveable, as to
returning this Way : his Cloaths that were feen,
t are lying in the Cheil, or the Prefs, where they
ufually lay, and the poor Horfc grafing in the
Field, or perhaps quiet in the Stable, and not at
all difturb'd. All that is to be faid, the good An-
gel that perhaps had fome fecret Commiflion to the
Relid: or Remains of the Man's Family j to give
them Notice of fome Evil, to warn, to admonifh, (^c,
aflumes the Shape and Appearance of the Man him-
felf, cloaths himfelf in his Likenefs, forms the
Apparition in Air, of his Cloaths, his Countenance,
his Horfe, as a Painter cloathes the Cloth he paints
on with Faces, Poftures, Habits, Garments, all in
Colours, while the paffive Perfon reprcfented is no
way affeded with, or concerned in the Draught
rcprefenting him.
And why ihould not this Spirit, thus commif-
fion'd to go on fuch an Errand, be able to amufe
us with the Appearance of a Perfon departed; ta-
king up his Shape, Countenance, Cloath?, i^c.
K z tho'
132. 7he Hiflory and Reality
tho' the Soul of the Perfon is not aflFe61:ed with,
or concern'd in it? when it is known that we of-
ten fee Apparitions of Perfons living, whom we fee
and fpeak to, and converfe with j know their Faces,
their Voices, their Cloathsj and yet the Perfons
themfekes know nothing of the matter.
I HAVE by me a very diverting Hiflory upon
this Subjeft, which I Ihall abridge for the prefect
purpofe, as follows, viz,
A CERTAIN young Lady of born in
the County of had been long courted by
a young Gentleman, whofe Father had a very good
Eftate in the fame Town : fhe had kept him Com-
pany too openly, but had not yielded to his Im-
portunities for a criminal Converfation, tho' her
Reputation fuffer'd for it as if ihe had; but at
length (he was fo far over-perfuaded, that fhe made
an Appointment to be at fuch a time at a Far-
mer's Houfe, a Tenant of his Father's, and who
were, it feems, let into the wicked Secret. Ac-
cordingly fhe drefles herfelf up with the befl: of her
Art, to recommend bcrfelf (to the DevU^ I may
fayj) and away fhe goes to meet him, having her
Servant Maid to attend her, becaufe it was over
fome Fields that fhe was tc go.
When flie was near the Houfe fhe finds fome
Excufe or Errand to fend back her Maid to the
Town; the Wenclj, it feems, not being privy toi
the Bufinefs.
As fhe turns about to difrJfs her Maid, the Maid!
ofFer'd to go farther 'till fhe was nearer the Houfe;,
but her Miftrefs {tt^ the Minifler of the Towni
coming along the Path, and making that the Ex-
cufe, O, fays fhe, there's our Miniller, Dr. —
coming, fo I fhall have his Company ; you may
'
go back, Mary^ I fhall be fafe enough.
The Maid fees the Minifter alfo, and goes back
accordingly.
of APPARiriO N S. 133
A s foon as the Minifter came up to her, (for he
fccm'd to overtake her prefently) he gives her the
ufual Compliment, and asks her how ihe came to
be in the Fields alone?
She anfwer'd fhe had not been alone, hue ha-
ving Occafion to fend back her Maid, fhe difmifs'd
her the fooner becaufe fhe favv him coming; f^nd
befides, fays fhe, I am going but to that Houfe
there, naming the Farmer's Name.
O, Madam, fays the Dodor, are you going
thither? then I know your Errand.
She was furpriz'd and blulli'd, but recovering a
little, What Errand Sir? fays ihe.
Why, Madam, fays he, it may not be proper
for me to name the Buiinefsi but you know ic
well enough.
'
What d' ye mean Sir? fays fhe. I don't un-
derftand you
Why, fays he, your Favourite the young Efquire
lis there before you.
She was terribly furprized then, and could
hardly fpeak to him, being touch'd with Shame
tand indignation; fuppofing the young Gentleman
had boafted of her Favours before he had receiv'd
them, and had betray'd her: however, fhe made
Hill ftrange of it : and having, it may be fuppos'd,
conquer'd her Modefly fo far as to make a Promife
or Appointment to {^icn^zt her Virtue to him, fhe
might the eafier conquer the Surprize 5 fofhefeemed
to flight it.
But, Madam, fays the Minifter, if you would
take my Advice- and there he ftop'd.
What Advice, Sir? fays ihe. I don't under-
ftand what you mean.
Why, I wou'd advife you to go back to the
Town again j and not go into the way of Mif-^
chief.

Shi^
134 ^^^ Hiftory and Reality
She ftill with flood, and put him off with the
ufual Anfwer, I don't underftand you 5 what do ye
mean ? and the like> but at laft the Minifter railing
his Voice a little, like to that of a Hern Reprover,
C o M E, come, young Lady, fays he^ you can't
conceal your wicked Purpofes^ you have made Mr.
•
an Appointment 5 he prevail'd on you laft
Night, and you have now deck'd yourfelf up with
your Ornaments to meet him, and proftitute your
Virtue, and your Honour, and your Confcience, all
to his corrupt vicious Appetite j and I know it,
you may fee that I do > my Advice to you is
to go back and break your wicked Promife, and
repent that you made it. I {hall give him the fame
Advice prefently.
I F fhe was furpriz'd before, flie was confounded
now, partly with Horror at the Fa6t itfelf, which
now ihe was ftruck a little with the Senfe of j and
partly, but Tenfold more, with the Shame of its
being known. Jt put her into fuch Confufion,
that at firft {he could not anfwer a Wordj but
after a-while {he faid. If you know the Gentle-
man is there. Sir, I {hall not go, efpecially {ince
you have fuch hard Thoughts of me : and upoa
faying this {he turns about and goes dire&ly back
again, and the Minifter went from her towards the
H. u e. As the Farmer liv'd but a very little way
from the Place where {he ftood talking with hiro^
{he look'd behind her and faw him go into tbfj
Houfc, and the Door {hut after him.
Any one will fuppofe upon this ihock to hef
Defign, and being not only difappointcd in he|l
wicked Pleafures, but expos'd and betray'd, as fhe
imagin'd, by her Lover 5 {he went dire£tly home
without any {lay, and there gave vent to her
PafTions with the utmofl Rage, and with all the Re-
fentment that fuch bafe Treatment could infpire
her with.
The
of APPARITIONS. I3J
The Gentleman, on the other hand, being ex-
tremely difiippointed, and not knowing what could
be the reafon ofjit, after he had waited a long time,
came back to fee what was the Matter, believing
flie muft be taken ill, or that fomeching had hap-
pened very extraordinary.
When he came to the Houfe, (ihe liv'd it feems
with an Aunt, whofe Husband was alfo dependent
upon the young Gentleman's Father,) he enquir'd
for his Miftrefsj but her Maid brought him Word,
that flie could not be fpoken with.
That Anfwer not being fatisfa6bory, and
having reftis'd to be anfwered with two or three
more fuch Excufes, at lafl: ilie fent him Word
plainly, that ihe had nothing to fay to him j and
that fhe not only would not fee him now, but
would never fee him more.
Surpriz'd with this, and not able to guefs
the Meaning of it, he goes awayj but the next
Morning writes her a very civil obliging Letter,
wherein, among abundance of the ufual Expreffions
of Lovers, he begs to know what he had done,
that fhould merit fuch Treatment, and that fhe
would let him into fo much at leait of the Caufes
of her Difpleafure, as fhould put him in a way to
clear himfelfj protefting that he knew not the leaft
Step he had taken to difoblige her, except in pun-
ftually attendmg her Appointment 5 and having the
Mortification of fitting five Hours by himfelf, in
Expeftation of her Company.
In Anfwer to this, fhejent him a long Letter,
full of Reproaches for his vile Ufage of her, draw-
ing her into a finful, fhameful Compliance with
him, and then expofing her, and triumphing over
her Weaknefsj making her with one hand the pre-
tended Obje6t of his Amour, and with the other
the Sport of his Companions. She upbraided him
with telling her that he fat five Hours alone,
K 4 whereas,
The Htfiory and Reality
whereas he had much better Company than flic
could have been 5 feeing the good Doctor, who had
admoniihed her not to expofe her felf in meeting
him, had given him the fame good Advice that he
had done, to her, and fo had not made fo bad a uib
of his Treachery in betraying her, as he expe&ed.
She concluded with telling him, 'twas her Hap-
pinefs that this came to her Knowledge, before fhe
had thrown her felf into the Arms of a Traitor
>
and tho' he had done her the Injuftiee to boaft of
her Weaknefs, fhe thank'd God, he triumph'd
when he had gain'd] but half a Viftory y hat flie
was infinitely beholden to him for her Deliverance,
and that it was the only Obligation he had ever
laid upon her.
I F I could give you the Entertainment of all
the Letters that pafs'd between them, wliile they
were both under the Amufeiy!ent of the myfterious
Part, and perfedly ignorant of the Occafion, and
then add the Surprize of the Difcovery, it would
make two A£i:s of a good Comedy 5 but I muft
fliorten the Story as much as I can.
He was fo furpriz'd with this Anfwer from his
Miftrefs, that he could not tell what to make of it,
and efpecially thofe Paragraphs which related to the
good Dodor's admonifhing her, and being in his
Company 5 all which as he really had known no-
thing of it, fo there was no gueffing at the mean-
ing of it. 'Twas impoffible fo much as to have the
leall Notion abour i:. j 'iwasallConfufion and Dark-
nefs, and without the leaft M^'aning that he could
come at. In a word, abundance of Letters pafs'd
between them, but ftill fhe continued ufing him af-
ter the fame manner, talk'dthe fameftyle, about his
betraying her, and that he a^led the very Part of
the Devil^ firft to tempt, and then to accufej firft
10 draw her in with a thouiand Importunities, and
fhen expofe her for complying. She reproach'd
him
j
of APPARITIONS. ,37
f him with the many Sollicitations and Proteftations of
i\ffe6lion,and appeal'd to him to teftifie, whether he
had made an eafie Conqueft, and whether fhe had
not fo long withftood his moft incefTant Aflaultsj
challenged him to tell how long he had befieg'd her,
and whether ihe had yielded at laft but on an honou-
rable Capitulation, tho' unhappily ihe had granted
Pofleflion without the due Securities. She ask'd
him why, when he triumph'd over her Honour, he
had not had fo much Generofity to own what the
Treaty had coft him, and how long it was before
he had gain'd that little he had to boaft of?
He protefted at large, that he was perfectly fur-
priz'd at the whole Affair, underftood not one
Word of it, could not dive into her Meaning, ab-
horr'd the Thought of what fhe charg'd him with j
and at laft very warmly infifted upon her explain-
ing her felf, and that otherwife, as fhe did him fo
much Injuftice, he would do himfelf Jufticej for
Ee heard {he made it too publick, and that tho' he
ad not done it yet, being tender of her Charafter,
lyet he could not bear to be treated in this manner,
and not know fomething of the Reafon of ic.
At laft he prefs'd her to let him but fpeak with
feer^ which, tho' it was long before ftie would
•grant, yet fhe did confent to at laft, left hefhould
sxpofe her. ^
At this Interview they began to come to an
Underftandingj fhe own'd that fhe was coming to
the Place, but that fhe faw the Minifter go in juft
before her, which made her go back again 5 but
fhe did not tell him a Word of her feeing the Mi-
nifter on the Way.
He protefted there was no Minifter came to
him, or into the Houfej and afterwards brought
:he People of the Houfe to teftifie the fame 5 that
he fat all the while in the Parlour reading a Book,
md that no Creature caipe near him, nor fo much
IS to the Door. This
3 8 The Hifiory and Reality
This ftartled her \ and at laft, with much Im
portunity,ihe told him the whole Story ofher meeting
with the Doftor in the Fields; and, in a word, hov
the Do6tor told her where fhe was going, and t<
who> that he was there wating for her-, and, whicl
confounded her worfc than all, had told her wha
fhc was going about 5 adding, that fhe had made th
Promife the Night before, and that he, meanini
the Gentleman, had told him fo.
N. B, Tn this Part (he was miftakenj the Dofto
faid he had been told of it as foon as Jhe had maa
the Promife^ and ihe in her Surprize underftoo
it, that he faid the Gentleman told him.
He was fo full of this heavy Charge, and hin*
felf in every Part fo clear of it, that it was impo
iible he fliould fit ftill with it. He knew not wht
to make of it, he knew very well that he had m
ver opcn'd his Mouth to any one, Man, Woman
Child about it j that the Farmer, or any of his F
mily, knew not a Word of it, only that he was i
meet her there, as they had frequently done befor
and innocently enough j and he could not fuppo
ihe could be lo weak to talk of it her felf 5 fo th
he could not yet imagine what it could be.
A FEW Days furnifh'd him with an Opportun
ty to talk with the Minifter himfelf, who came fr
quently to his Father's Houfe •, and being one Di
very free with him, he jelled with him, for hindrir
him of two or three Hours of very good Compan
The Do6tor anfwer'd him, he ih^uld be ve
forry to be guilty of any thing fo rude, and defir
to know how it could be.
Why, Dodor, fays he, we were with for
Friends very merry at fuch a Houfe j (infinuatingthf
there was more Company j) and fuch a Lady, fa>
he, (naming her,) was coming to us, and you m
her, and perfuadcd her to go back again.

Si 1^5 fays theDoEioTy I have only one Satisfaftion
in the whole Story, and that is, that it cannot be
true, as I fhall foon fatisfie you.
Nay Dodor, fays the Gentleman^ I don't tell it
you as of my own Knowledge.
N o Sir, fays the DoElor^ and I fhould not have
fo little Refpeft as to tell you it was falfe, if you
had told it me as of your own Knowledge.
B u T do you aflure me, fays the Gentleman^ that
it is not true ?
I D o afTurc you, fays the Do^or^ upon my Word,
that I know nothing of it.
Why, Doftor, fays the Gentleman, do you
give me your Word that you did not meet her in
the Fields, next to Farmer Gi— 's Houfe on the
eleventh Day of the very laft Month, htmgJugufi?
for I have it all doivn in black and white ^ here.
* He pulls out his Pocket-Book^ and looks for the
Day of the Month,
Not only not that Day, fays the Do5lor, but I
never faw her in thofc Fields, or any other Fields, in
my Life.
Why, you furprizc me Doctor, fays the Gentle-'
Vian\ it is impoffible.

Do£for,
Nay, Do£l:or, fays the Gentleman^ if you appeal
to her, you muft be caftj for I will fwear ihe told .
me fo her felf.
This confounded the Doftor for a little while,
but he prefently recover'd himfelfj Sir, fays he, I
was going to defire of you, that we might wait
upon Mrs. together, and that 1 might hear
it from her felf j but upon rccolle6hing all the Cir-
cumftances, I am very happy in one thing, namely,
that let her fay Cq her felf, and forty Ladies more, I
can prove to you, that it is impoffible it fhould be true.
That will indeed put an End to it all, fays the
gentleman y but how can you do that "^
Wh y.
1 40 The Hijiory and Reality
Why, Sir, fays the DoUor^ are you fiire flie
does not give 5>'ou a wrong Day ?
No, no, fays the Gentleman^ I have a Reafon
why it can't be a Miftake of the Day, for 1 have a
Memorandum of the Day upon a remarkable * Oc-
cafion.
^ He had fet it clown in his Book upon the Occajlon
of his being difappointed.
And it is not the Lady's Miftake then, fays the
Do^or-y for you know Women are not always the
exa&eft in their Accounts of Days, nor Months,
unlefs it be on worfe Accounts than I believe you
were to meet about.
Well, Do6tor, fays the Gentleman^ but I am
fure of the Day, for I have it in my Book.
Nay, if it was miftaken a Day or two, fays the
Do^ior^ it matters not j for, as I faid before, I never
faw her in the Fields in my Lifej or if I might
fee her among other People, I am fure 1 never
fpoke to her. But beddes Sir, I tell you, this
cannot be true, for I was at London all the laft
Month 'till the Z7th Day, fo that 'tis impoffible.
Here the Difcourfe neceflarily broke off: the
Gentleman was loth to difcover his Surprize, but
told him he would enquire farther into it ^ and up-
on that he goes immediately back to ihe Lady, re-
proaches her a little with her forming fuch a Story
to pick a Q^ia^Tel-, but not telling her that he had
been v;ith the Minifter at allj only, as he might
ealily know by other Circumilances, that the Do-
£tor"was out of Town, he told her, that he would
not have charg'd her wuh fuch a thing in fuch
harfh Terms, if he was not^ upon looking back a
little upon things, come to a Certainty, that it was
not only falfe, but that it was impoffible to be
true.
They had a long Dialogue upon that Head
5
^nd as he did not prefently tell her the Circum-
ftance$.
of AP PARiriONS. ,41
fiances, thinking he had a little Advantage upon
her, he jelled with her pretty fmartly upon it,
feem'd to laugh that fliefhould firft put fuch a Sham
upon him, and then to tell fuch a formal Story to
make it good, and to excufe her Breach of Promife,
and that not a Word of Truth fhould be in it.
She receiv'd his making a Jeft of it with Di{^
, dain, and told him fhe began now to difcover what
a kind of a Man {he was fo near being ruin'd by ;
and that fhe had been in good Hands indeed, that
could pretend to banter her thus 5 that fhe ihonld
,
have been finely us'd, if the good Miniiler had not
been fent from Heaven to fave her from being
doubly undone.
H E told her flie was foon angry 5 but it touch'd
her home 5 however Madam, fays he, you ihan'c
flander the good Man, for he had no hand in it.
Well, weii, fays fhe, I can better laugh at you
for thai Folly, than I fhould have done for fome-
thing too vile to name, if I had fallen into your
Hands : For, fays jJoe^ I had too much Reafon to
fay now, that I was fure to have been both be-
tray'd, and exposed.
H E faid fhe grew fcurrilous, and went from one
Story to another} that fhe told him a falfe Story,
and wanted to drop it 5 he defir'd her to ftick to
I
one thing, and go through that firil.
. She colour'd, and railing her Voice, told him
'twas below a Gentleman to give a Woman the Lie;
that fhe believ'd, if fhe had been a Man, he durft
not have faid fo to her.
He told her fhe was mad, and that fhe had hap-
pened to fpcak a falfe thing, and was in a Rage be-
caufe fhe could not come off of it.
She told him, he fhow'd her again that he was
no Gentleman; that if he gave her the Z;V again
« fhe would fpit in his Face; and that if he would
'
furniih her with a Sword, fhe would do her fell
juflice,
i4z TToe Hifiory and Reality
juftice, and give him Satisfadion as fairly as if iii
was a Manj and that for his giving her th
Lie, flie threw it back in his Face, he might mak
the bed of it.
That's Gallantly done, fays fe, Madam ir
deed, there's a Sword for you 5 and offers her h
own, laying it down upon the Table before her.
You an't even with me yet, y^j5 Jhe-, i fcorn j
much to take up a Sword againft a Naked Manj i
you ought to have fcorn'd, if you had been a Ger
tlcman, to give the Lie to a Woman.
He began now to find fhe was too hard for him
but he came back to the Queftion.
Well. Madam, fays he^ will you own yoi
felf in the wrong, if I prove to you what I fai
juft now, that what you charge me with not 9nl
is falfc, but can't be true ?
A Y, ay, fays Jhe^ what can't be true muft b
falfe J but what does that do for you ?
Well, fays he^ will you venture fo much upoj
it as - '- '
Here fhe interrupted him with feme warmth;
fays Jhey I'll venture my Life upon it.
N o Madam, not your Life, fays he^ you fhal
only oblige your felf to perform your Promife, if
do prove it j and I'll promife never to ask you more
if I do not.
I can't go that length again, to favc Life
but I'll freely confent to die any Death in th<
World, that is not by lingring Torture, if you can
do it.
Why then Madam, fays he^ you know our Ap
pointment was fuch a Day : fo he reckon'd up thi
Days to her, 'till flie underftood the Calculationi

'ircumftanccs, fuch as cannot be dcny'd. I know

Here he related to her feveral Circumftances, as
'he knew them by his own Affairs, not letting her
now at all that he had feen the Do6tor and talk'd
'ith him about it.
She laught at him at firft, and told him, that
c had been too old for her before 5 but ihe was too

1 44 The Hijlory and Reality
But if you affail^ he will quickly turn T'ail^
For the Devil was never for jilting,
^he Devil can tempt^ hut he cannot compel -,
He can wheedle^ delude^ and invite us j
But he never would fill up his Quota's in Hell
If he only floould Bully and Fright us.
But when once we're got out of his Clutches^
He rages and roars like a Bull:
His Malice and Emptinefs fuch is^
And yet he's of Venom fa full,
jthe way then to deal with the Devil,
Is at his own Weapons to fight him :
When he fets up his Roar^ provoke him the more^
And let him hut fee that you flight him.
For the DeviVs a Coward in Nature,
Apitiful forry Poltroon ;
If you take hut the Whip, he'llgive you the Slip j,
And hefore you can lafh him, he'll run.
Her Singing put him into a Paffion -, for h»
took her Song of the Devil to mean himfelf j an
he told her 'twas all a fcandalous Fiction of he

She bad him do his worft, and made him
Curtfy, as if Hie fuppos'd he had been juft goinj

She told him it was good Advice, . to bid her
not expofe her felf, and fhe had the more need of

Then he told her he would bring the Farmer
and all his Family to her, to prove that the Doctor

before 5 and the Boy fliould teftify that he never
Taw him, nor open'd the Door, nor let him in.

Ma, H E faid, How d'ye do Mrs. Mary ? and
touch'd his Hat, juft as he us*d to do.
Well Sir, fays Jhe^ then you fee I wasn't drunk,
nor I did not walk in my Sleep. If it were conve-

he ihould tell you what he faid to me.
Convenient or not convenient, y?/)'^ /^f, I'll

and then he fwore a little.

and yet he fhall know nothing of the matter.
I KNOW a little too much of that, fays fhe\ ho

This put him almoft out of all Temper, ana
he gave her ill Words again j and at laft added tht

Well then it was the Bevil^ fays be •, I won't
difpute that with you, Madam.
No, no, faysfje, I can fatisfy you that it could
not be the J^evilyl can convince you; you will
acknowledge it prefently : Do you think the Devil
would have turn'd me back again, when he knew
the dreadful Errand I was going on ?
Nay, fays he calmly^ 1 confefs that's the beft
thing you have faid yet ; who then cou'd it be?
fays be-, for 'tis plain it could not be the Doftor.
Then, fays Jbe^ it muft be fome heavenly Ap-
pearance in the Doftor's Cloaths, for I knew not
his Face and his Voice only, but his very Gown j
and if it was a good Angel, I have the more rea-
fon to be thankful that he hindred me from running
into the Arms of the Devil: and with that fhe fell a
crying, flie could hold out no longer.
Well, they parted after this Scuffle, for he
was a little daunted himfelf
But my Story does not end here ; for a little
while after fomething happened that explained all
the reft : The Lady had a Vifit to pay at a Neigh-
bour's Houfe, who liv'd a little out of the Town,
only over one little Enclofure, which flie was ob-
lig'd to crofs : Now as fhe was going over thac
Clofe or Enclofure, who {hould flie meet but the
Dodoragainj and ihe faw him agood while before
he came up to her.
She was furpriz'd at feeing him ; and if {lie
could have avoided him fhe would : but 'twas im-
prnTible. When he came up to her, he pull'd off his
Hat very courteoufly, and immediately began to
L i difcourfe
1 48 TToe Hiftory and Reality
difcourfe of what he had faid to her before ; but
took no Notice at all of its having been deny'd.
Sir, fays Jhe^ I have been very ill us'd upon that
Day's Work.
I KNOW hy fays be^ I know it, repeating the
Words : But your Innocence ihall be cleared up,
I will do it my felf 5 do you be thankful that you
efcap'dthe Snare: And fo, giving her no time toan-
fwcr, he pafs'd by her without taking any farewell:
which being a little Particular, made her turn her
Head to look at him : But tho' it was in the mid-
dle of the Field, which was too large for him to
be out of it if he had flown-as fwift as a Pidgeon,.
(for it was not above a Moment, not a Second of
Time) he was gone, and fhe faw nothing.
She was exceedingly furpriz'd, and ready to
fink into the Ground > ihe was fo frighted that fhc
could not help fitting down even upon the Grafs 5
for her Joints trembled under her, fo that fhe could
not fland.
I T happen'd that a poor Woman of the Town
came crofs the Clofe at the very jundure, and
knowing her, fhe eall'd to her to come and help
her up. She did not tell the Woman what had hap-
pen'd to her, but that fhe was taken with a fit of
trembling, and that if Ihe had not fat down fhe
mufl have fallen down •, all which was true : fo the
poor Woman help'd her up, and led her home,
where fhe continued very ill of the Fright for fe-
veral Days.
In this time fhc had a very great defire to fee the
Gentleman, for by what the Apparition faid to
her fhe made no doubt but he had feen ic too.
After feme time he had heard that fhe was
very ill, and thinking what he had faid to her
might have had fome influence upon her, to hurt
her, he refolv'dto go and fee her 5 for tho' he lUd
ruffled her pretty much j yet, as he faid afterwards,
he
of APPARITIONS. 149
he lov'd her very well > and the better for her To
feafonably recovering her Virtue and good Princi-
ples 5 and much better than he belicv'd he fhould
have done, if he had had his Will of her, as he
ihould certainly have had, if fhe had met him that
time at the Farmer's.
With thefe kind Thoughts he went to vifit
her> and tho' fhe was very ill, yet fhe would be
brought out of her Chamber to fee him.
After fomc Civilities, he frankly told her the
reafon of his Vifit word for word as abovCj and
that he came to chear her up a little.
She thank'd him j but told him it was true it
had extremely troubled her, to think firft how
near fhe had been to her utter Ruin, and then how
needlefly fhe had been exposed for it j and that tho'
fhe had no Guilr, as he very well knew, other than
that which was in the firft wicked Confentingj yet
fhe had been as much expos'd, as if fhe had been
really his Whore.
He protefled to her that he never had opened
his Lips of it to the Do6tor, or any one elfe 5 and
that it was the Refentment at*the charging him
with it, that had made him fo angry, and nothing
€lfe i for that he fcorn'd any thing fo bafe.
She told him it was impofUble for any one to
believe otherwife before 5 but that fhe believ'd he
was fatisfied how it all was, nowj and that fome-
thing had happen'd fince, which had open'd her
Eyes, tho' it hadalmofl kill'd her j arid fhe believ'd
he knew fomething of it too.
H E wanted to know what it was, for he pro-
tefted he knew nothing. What fays he^ is there
any more Myileries ?
SHE faid^ fhe could not tell him, becaufe fhe
fuppos'd he would not believe her.
HE anfwer'd^ he would believe her in every
thing, that he ought to believe any body in.
L J
SHE
I JO The Hijloyy and Reality
S HE told him^ fhe believ'd there would be nc
occafion to tell him, for that fhe did not doubi
but he would be inform'd the fame way that fhc
was, if he was not already.
He importun'd her earneftly to let him £ho\K
what it was; and that with fuch a ferious kind o
Difcourfe, that fhe fancy'd he had feen fomethin^
too 'y but it feems he had not : However he en-
treated her fo much, that at laft fhe let him kno>^
the whole Story, as above.
There is a great deal more belongs to thi;
Story, which would be very diverting, and . noi
without its Ufes too j but as the particular Rela-
tion does not come within the verge of my owr
Knowledge, I cannot vouch all the Particulars, at
leafl not fufficiently.
However, 'tis enough to the Cafe in hand ;
If the Apparition came to prevent this poor de-
luded young Lady from proflituting her felf to gi
Man that had wheedled her in upon fuch difhonou
rable Terms ; it could not certainly be the Devil
or any Spirit of his Clafs, or under his Govern-
ment and Diredion; he would never have exhorted
her to go back, reproach'd her with the Crime,
and prevail'd upon her to believe it had been re
veal'd to him by the Treachery of her Lover.
This muft be certainly one of thofe Angelicfci
Guards which the God of Nature, in Mercy ta
Mankind, has placed as a detach'd Body of Spirit;
to counter-aCt the Devil^ prevent the Arch-ene*
my feducing his Creatures, and over-whelming the
World with Crime; and if the Story be as 1 have
receiv'd it and now handed it down, it feems a
merciful Difpofition of Providence in Favour of
the Gentleman, as well as the Lady; and be it a Pa-
rable or a Hiftory, the Moral is the fame, and the
Improvement of it the fame too : They that are
running the fame Courfe of Folly would have Rea-
fon
of APPARITIONS. lyr
fon to be very thankful if they were fure to meet
with the fame kind of Difappointment, and would
never fay it was the Devil that told it them.
The Gentleman it feems did not flight the
Story fo much as flie cxpe6led he would, nor did
he queftion the Truth of any or every Part of it ;
for fhe told it with fo much Steadinefs, always a-
greeing in every Particular, and gave fo concur-
ring Accounts of the Circumflances as they related
to what had happened before, that it was appa-
rent 'twas no Delufion.
That which made him mofl uneafy, was that
the Apparition feem'd to promife to appear to
him 5 and he had no Defire to be convinced that
way. Indeed the Story, at lead fo far as I have the
Particulars, breaks off a little abruptly there and
does not fay whether he ever faw any thing or no.
Buc it faid, it made him be quite another Man in
his Way of living than ever he was before; and
particularly he was very thankful that he had been
prevented being fo wicked with her as in all Pro-
bability he had been, if this had not happened.
Now this Apparition, as is faid above, could not
with any manner of Reafon, be fuppofcd to be the
Devil '^ for why fhould an Evil Spirit appear, to
keep any Perfon from doing Evil ? Why fliould it
aflume a real Shape, namely that of a Mini iler in his
Gown and CafTock, and that ic was in Appearance
the very Minifter of the Pari(h; for all this fhe con-
ftantly affirm'd, and two things are natural Infe-
rences from it.
FIRSTy That the Appearance was real.
SECONDLY^ That it was a good Spirit.
Let the Divines read us Ledures upon the
Nature of Spirits, and upon how far they can or
cannot take Cognizance of human Affairs ; That I
have nothing to do with here ; ray Bufinefs is to
ohferve the Matter of Fa£t, viz, that they do come
L 4 hitherj
ijt The Hifiory ctnd Reality
hither, do appear, and are feen, talk'd to and con««
vers'd with, and that they do come on good Errands,^
and therefore are not likely to be evil Spirits or
Devils.
Take another Hiftorical Relation, which, tho'
I name no Names, I have very good Authority for
the Truth of, and that more particularly than for
the other.
AGentleman of a very good Eftate mar-
ried a Lady of alfoa good Fortune, and had one Son
by her, and one Daughter, and no more, and after Jii
few Years his Lady died. He foon married a fecond
Venter 5 andhisfecond Wife, tho' of an inferior Qua'
lity and Fortune to the former, took upon her to dif-
courage and difcountcnance his Children by his firft
Lady, and made the Family very uncomfortable,,
both to the Children and to their Father alfo.
The firft thing of Confequence which this Con-
duft of the Mother-in- Law produced in the Family,
was that the Son, who began to be a Man, ask'd the
]F^ther's Leave to go abroad to travel. The Mother-
in-Law, tho' willing enough to be rid of the young
A4an, yet becaufe ic would require fomething con-
siderable to fupport his Expences abroad, violently
oppos'd it, and brought his Father alfo to refufe
him, after he had freely given him his Confent.
This fo affefted the young Gentleman, that
after ufing all the dutiful Applications to his Father
that he could pofHbly do, as well by himfelf as by
fome other Relations, but to no purpofej and being
a little encouraged by an Uncle, who was Brother
to his Mother, his Father's firft Lady, he refolv'd
to go abroad without Leave, and accordingly did
fo.
What Part of the World he travelled into
I do not remember 5 it feems his Father had con-
ilantly Intelhgence from him for fome cime, and
^AZ prevailed ,with to make him a reafonable Al,-

lowance for his Subfiftance, which the young
Gentleman always drew Bills for, and they were
honourably paid 5 but after fome time, the Mother-
in-Law prevailing at home, one of his Bills of
Exchange was refus'd, and being protefted, was
fent back without Acceptance 5 upon which he
drew no more, nor did he write any more Letters,
or his Father hear any thing from him for upwards
of four Years, or thereabouts.
Upon this long Silence, the Mother-in-Law
made her Advantage feveral Ways 5 ihe firft intima-
ted to his Father that he mufl: needs be dead 5 and
confequently, his Eftate fhould be fettled upon her
eldeil Son, (for fhe had feveral Children.) His Fa-
ther withilood the Motion very firmly, but the
Wife harrafs'd him with her Importunities j andfhc
argued upon two Points againft him, I mean the
Son.
FIRST'^ If he was dead, then there was no
room to objeft, her Son being Heir at Law.
SECOND LT^ If he was not dead, his Beha-
viour to his Father in not writing for fo long a
Time was inexcuGible, and he ought to refent it,
and fettle the Eftate as if he were dead 5 that no-
thing could be more difobligjng, and his Father
ought to depend upon it that he was dead, and
treat him as if he was fo > for he that would ufe a
Father fo, fhould be taken for one dead, as to his
filial Relation, and be treated accordingly.
His Father however Hood out a long time, and
told her that he could not anfwer it to his Gon-
fcience ; that there might happen many things in
the World, which might render his Son unable to
write 'y that he might be taken by the 'Turks^ and
carried into Slavery j or he might be among the
Per/tans or u^rabians[yi\\'\ch it feems was the Cafe)
and fo could not get any Letters convey'd > and

'till he knew whether he had Reafon for \t or no,
or whether his Son had offended him or no.
These Anfwers, however juft, were far from
Hopping her Importunities, which fhe carried on
fo far, that flie gave him no Reft, and it made an
unquiet Family 5 ilie carried it very ill to him, and
in a word, made her Children do fo too 5 and the
Gentleman was fo wearied out with it, that once or
twice he came to a kind of Confent to do it, but
his Heart fail'd him, and then he fell back again,
and refufed.
However, her having brought him fo near it,
was an Encouragement to her to go on with her
reftlefs Sollicitations, 'till at laft he came thus far
to a provifional Agreement, that if he did not hear
from his Son by fuch a time, or before it, he
would confent to a re-fettling the Eftate.
She was not well fatisfied with the conditional
Agreement, but being able to obtain no other,
flie was oblig'd to accept of it as 'twas j tho', as
ihe often told him, fhe was far from being fatisfied
with it as to the Time, for he had fix'd it for
four Years, as above.
He grew angry at her telling him fo, and an-
fwer'd, that ftic ought to be very well fatisfied
with it, for that it was time little enough, as his
Son's Circumftances might be.
Well, fiie teiz'd him however fo continually,
that at laft ftie brought him down to one Year
But before fhe brought him to that, fhe told him
one Day in a Heat, that fhe hoped his Ghoft would
one time or other appear to him, and tell him, that
he was dead, and that he ought to do Juftice to his
other Children, for he fhould never come to claim
the Eftate.
When he came, fo much againft his Will, to
confent to fhorten the time to one Year, he told
her, that he hoped his Son's Ghoft, tho' he was
7 not
of APPARITIONS. lyj
not dead, would come to her, and tell her he was
alive, before the Time expired: For why, fays he,
may not injur'd Souls walk while embodied, as well
as afterwards ?
I T happen'd one Evening after this, that they
had a moil violent Family Quarrel upon this Sub-
je6b, when on a fudden a Hand appeared at a Cafe-
ment, endeavouring to open it 5 but as all the iron
Cafements, ufed in former Times, opcn'd outward,
but hafp'd or faftcn'd themfelves in the Infidej fo
the Hand feem'd to try to open the Cafement, but
could not. The Gentleman did not fee it, but his
Wife did, and {he prefently ftarted up, as if ihe
was frighted, and forgetting the Quarrel they had
vpon their Hands, Lord blefs me! fays jhe^ there
are Thieves in the Garden. Her Husband ran im-
mediately to the Door of the Room they fat in, and
opening it, look'd out.
There's no body in the Garden, fays he'. To he
clapt the Door again, and came back.
I A M fure, fays Jhe^ I faw a Man there.
I T muft be the Devil then, fays he^ for I'm fure
there's no body in the Garden.
I'll fwear, faysjhe^ I faw a Man put his Hand
up to open the Cafement j but finding it faft, and I
f uppofe, adds fhe^ feeing us in the Room, he walk'd

I T is impoffible he could be gone, fays he 5 did
noc I run to the Door immediately? and you know
the Garden Walls on both fides hinder him going
P ry'thee, y^jj^i^f angrily^ I an't drunk nor

the Devil^ *twas the Ghoft of your Son : it may
be come to tell you he was gone to the Bevil^
and you might give your Eftatc to your eldeft
Baftard, fince you won't fettle it on the lawful
Heir.
If it was my %ox\^fays he^ he's come to tell us
he's alive, 1 warrant you, and to ask you how you
can be fo much a Devil to defire me to difinhe-
rit him ; and with thofe Words, Alexander^ fays
he aloud^ repeating it twice, flatting up out of his
Chair, if you are alive {how your felf, and don't
let me be infulted thus every Day with your being
dead.
At thofe very Words, the Cafement whi ch
the Hand had been feen at by the Mother, open'd
of itfclf, and his Son Alexander look'd in with a
full Face, and flaring diredly upon the Mother with
an angry Countenance, cry'd Here^ and then va-
nifh'd in a Moment.
The Woman that was fo flout before, fhriek'd
out in a mod difmal manner, fo as alarm'd the
whole Houfej her Maid ran into the Parlour, to
fee what was the matter, but her Miflrefs was
fainted away in her Chair.
She was not fallen upon the Ground, becaule

Her Husband run immediately to the Parlour
Door, and opening it went into the Garden, but
there was nothings and after that he run to another
Door that open'd from the Houfe into the Garden,
and then to two other Doors which open'd out
of his Garden, one into the Stable-yard, and ano-
ther into the Field beyond the Garden, but found

[lone : he ask'd them if any body elfe had been in
he Garden, but they both conftantly affirmed no
)ody had been there, anci they were both rolling
I Gravel- walk near the Houfe.
Upon this he comes back into the Room, fits
lim down again, and faid not one Word for a
Tood while i the Women and Servants being bufy
ill the while, and in a Hurry, endeavourmg to
ecover his Wife.
After fome time flie recover'd fo far as to
peak, and the firft Words fhc faid,
L d blefs me ! what was it ?
Nay, fays her Husband, 'twas Alexander to be
ure.
With that flie fell into a Fit, and skream'd and
hriek'd out again mod terribly.
Her Husband not thinking that would have
iffeded her, did what he could to perfuade her
)ut of it again J but that would not do, and they
ivere obliged to carry her to Bed, and get fome
lelp to her , but ibe continued very ill for feveral
Days after.
However this put an end for fome confide-
•able time to her Sollicitations about his Difinhe-
riting her Son-in-Law.
But Time, that hardens the Mind in cafes of
I worfe Nature, wore this off alfo by degrees, and
iTie began to revive the old Caufe again, tho' not
It firft fo eagerly as before.
Nay he us'd her a little hardly upon ittoo, and
if ever they had any W^ords about it he would
)id her hold her Tongue, or that if fiie talked any
fluore upon that Subject, he would call Alexander
igain to open the Cafemenc.
This aggravated Things much 5 and tho' it ter-
ify'd her a great while, yet at length fiie was {o
exafperated
1 j8 The Hifiory and Reatky
exafperated, that fhe told him fhe believ'd he dealt
with the DevilJ
and that he had fold himfelf to
the Devil only to be able to fright his Wife.
He jefted with her, and^told her any Man wou'di
be beholden to the Devil to hufli a noify Wo-
man, and that he was very glad he had found the
Way to do it, whatever it coll him.
She was fo cxafperated at this, that fhe threa-
tened him if he play'd any more of his hellifli Arts
with her, fhe wou'd have him Indided for a Wi-
zard, and having a Familiars and fhe could prove
it, fhe faid, plain enough, for that he had rais'd
the Devil on purpofe to fright his Wife.
The Fray parted that Night with ill Words
and ill Nature enough, but he little thought fhe
intended as fhe faid, and the next Day he had for-
got it all, and was as good-humour'd as if nothing
had happened.
But he found his Wife chagreen'd and diftur-
bed very much, full of Refentment, and threatning
him with what flie refolv'd to do.
However he little thought fhe intended him
the Mifchicf fhe had in her Head, offering to talk
friendly to her j but fhe rejeded it with Scorn, and
told him fhe would be as good as her Word, foi
flie wou'd not live with a Man that fhould bring
the Devil into the Room as often as he thought
£c, to murther his Wife.
He ftrove to pacify her by fair Words, but
fhe told him fhe was in earnell with him : and ir

the Liberty to go voluntarily before the Juftice of
the Peace, and if he thought fit to let her know
when he would be ready, fhe would be fo too,
and would get fome of her own Friends to go along
with her.
He was furpriz'd at this, for he little thought
{he had been in earneft with him, and endeavoured to
pacify her by all the Ways poffiblej but fhe found
flie had frighted him heartily, and fo indeed fhe
had, for tho' the thing had nothing in it of Guilt,
yet he found it might expofe him very much, and
being loth to have fuch a Thing brought upon the
Stage againft him, he ufed all the Entreaties with
her that^he was able, and begged her not to do
it.
But the more he humbled himfelf, the more
{he triumphed over him 5 and carrying Things to
an unfufferable height of Infolence, ihc told him
at laft fhe would make him do Juftice, as fhe call'd
it 5 that fhe was fure fhe cou'd have him punilli'd
if he continued obftinate, and fhe wou'd not be
expos'd to Witchcraft and Sorcery j for fhe did not
know to what length he might carry it.
To bring the Story to a Concluiionj fhe got
the better of him to fuch a degree, that he offer'd
to refer the thing to indifferent Perfons, Friends
on both Sides i and they met feveral Times, buC
could bring it to no Conclufion. His Friends faid
there was nothing in it, and they would not
have him comply with any thing upon the Pre-
tence of it; that he called for his Son, and fome
body open'd the Cafement and cry'd here j that
there was not the leaffc Evidence of Witchcraft in
that, and infifled that fhe cou'd make nothing of
it.
Her Friends carried it high, inftrufted by her;
She ofFer'd to fwear that he had threatned her be-
fore with his Son's Ghoflj that now he viiibly rais'd
a
i6o The Hijiory arid Reality
a Spectre 5 for that calling upon his Son^ who was
dead to be fure, the Ghoft immediately appear'dj
that he could not have called up the Devil thus
to perfonate his Son, if he had not dealt with the
Devil himfelf, and had a familiar Spirit, and that
this was of dangerous Confequence to her.
Upon the whole, the Man wanted Courage to
iland it, and was afraid of being expos'd 5 fo that
he was grievoufly perplex'd, and knew not what
to do.
When flie found him humbled as much as fhe
cou'd defire, flie told him if he would do her Ju-
ilice, as fhe call'd it, (that is to fay, fettle his
Eftate upon her Son,) fhe would put it up, on
Condition that he fhould promife to fright her no
more with raifing the Devil.
. That part of the Propofal exafperated him
again, and he upbraided her with the Slander of
it, and told her he defy'd her, and ihe might do
her worfl.
Thus it broke off all Treaty, and (he began
to threaten him again > however, at length, fhe
brought him to comply, and he gives a Writing
under his Hand to her, fome of her Friends being
by, promifing that he would comply if his Son
did not arrive, or fend an Account of himfelf, with-
in four Months.
She was fatisfy'd with this, and they were all
made Friends again, and accordingly he gave the
Writings but when he delivered it to her in Pre*
fence of her two Arbitrators, he took the Liberty-,
to fay to her, with a grave and folemn kind of
Speech
:
Look you, fays he, you have worry'd me into
this Agreement by your fiery Temper, and I have
fign'd it again ft Juftice, Confcience and Rcafonj
but depend upon it, I fhall never perform it.
One
of APPARITIONS. x6i
One of the Arbitrators faid, Why, Sir, this i%
doing nothing J for if you refolve not to perform ir^
what fignifies the Writing? Why do you promife
what you do not intend fhall be done? This will
but kindle a new Flame to begin with, when the
Time iix'd expires.
Why, fays he^ I am fatisfy'd in my Mind that
my Son is alive.
Come, come, fays his Wife^ fpeaking to the Gen^
tleman that had argued with her Husband, let him
(ign the Agreement, and let me alone to make
him perform the Conditions.
Well, fays her Husband^ you fhall have the
Writing, and you ihall be let alone 5 but I am fa-
:isfy'd you will never ask me to perform itj and
/et I am no Wizard, adds he, as you have wick-
edly fuggefted.
She reply'd that ihe would prove that he deak
ivith the Devil^ for that he rais'd an evil Spirit by
)nly calling his Son by his Name 5 and fo began to
:ell the Story of the Hand and the Cafement.
Come, fays the Man to the Gentleman that
was her Friend, give me the Pen j I never deak
with but one Devil in my Life, and there it fits^
urning to his Wife j and now I have made an
^^greement with her, that none but the D^wV wou'd
lefire any Man to fign : and I will fign it j I fay,
^ive me the Pen, but fhe nor all the Devils in
lell will ever be able to get it executed^ remem-
ber I fay fo.
She began to open at him, and fo a new Flame
vould have been kindled, but the Gentlemen mo*
lerated between them ; and her Husband fetting
lis Hand to the Writing put an end to the Fray
t that time.
At the end of four Months fhe challengM the
Performance, and a Day w^ appointed, and her two
Mends that had been the Arbitrators were invited
M to
6t The Hijiory and Reality
to Dinner upon this Occafion, believing that her
Husband would have executed the Deeds j and ac-
cordingly the Writings were brought all forth, en-
grofs'd, and read over j and Tome old Writings which
at her Marriage were fign'd by her Truftees in or-
der to her quitting fome part of the Eftare to hei
Son, were alfo brought to be canccird. The Huf-
band being brought over by fair Means or foul, 1
know not whether, to be in a Humour for Peace
fake to execute the Deeds, and difinherit his Son 5
alledging that, indeed, if he was dead it was no
wrong to him, and if he was alive he was very
unkind and undutiful to his Father in not letting
him hear from him in all that time.
Besides it was urg'd that if he fhould at any
time afterwards appear to be alive, his Father (whc
had very much encreas'd, it feems, in his Wealth,]
was able to give him another Fortune, and to make
him a juft Satisfaction for the Lois he fhould fu-
ilain by the Paternal Eflate.
Upon thefe Confiderations, I fay, they had
brought over the poor low-fpirited Husband to be
almoft willing to comply 5 or at Icaft, willing or un-
willing, it was to be done, and (as above) they mett
accordingly.
When they had difcourfed upon all the Parti^
culars, and (as above) the new Deeds were read over,
fhe or her Husband took the old Writings up to
cancel them \ J think the Story fays it was the
Wife, not her Husband, that was juft going tc
tear ofF the Seal, when on a fudden they heard a
rufhing Noife in the Parlour where they fat, as il
fome body had come in at the Door of the Room
which opened from the Hall, and went thro* the
Room towards the Garden Door, which was ihut.
They were all furpriz'd at it, for it was very
diftind, but they faw nothing. The Woman
turn'd pale, and was in a terrible Fright j however.

ats nothing was feen, fhe recover'd a little, but be-
gan to ruffle her Husband again.
WttAT, fays ihe, have you laid your Plot to
bring up more Devils again?
The Man (at composed, tho' he was under no
little Surprize too.
One of her Gentlemen faid to him. What is the
meaning of all this ?
I PROTEST, Sir, fays he, I know no more of
it than you do.
What can it be then ? fciid the other Gentle*
man.
I CANNOT conceive, fays he^ for I am utterly
unacquainted with fuch Things.
Have you heard nothing from your Son? fays
the Gentleman.
Not one Word, fays the Father^ no not the lead
Word thefe five Years.
Have you wrote nothing to him, fays the Gen-'
tleman^ about this Tranfaftion?
N o T a Word, fays he, for I know not where
to dire6b a Letter to him.
S I R, fays the Gentleman^ I have heard much of
Apparitions, but 1 never faw any in my Life, nor
did I ever believe there was any thing of Reality
in them •, and indeed I faw nothing now : but the
pafling of feme Body, or Spirit, or fomething, crofs
the Room juft now, is plain > I heard it dillin^tly.
I believe there is fome unfeen Thing in the Room,
as much as if I faw it.
Nay, fays the other Arhitrator^ I felt the Wind
of it as it pafs'd by me. Pray, adds he, turning to
the Husband, do you fee nothing yourfelf?
N o, upon my Word, fays he^ not the lead Ap-»
pearance in the World.
I HAVE been told, fays the firft Arbitrator, and
have Read that an Apparition may be feen by fomc
M 2. People,
164 ^^^ Hijlory a^d Reality
People, and be Invifible to others, tho' all in
the fame Room together.
However the Husband folemnly protefled to
them all that he faw nothing.
Pray, Sir, fays the firfi Jrbitrator^ have you
fcen any thing at any other time, or heard any Voi-
ces or Noifes, or had any Dreams about this Matter?
Indeed, fays he^ I have feveral times dream'd my
Son is alive, and that I had fpoken with him j and
once that I ask'd him, why he was fo undutiful, and
flighted me fo, as not to let me hear of him in fo
many Years, feeing he knew it was in my Power
to difinherit him.
Well, Sir, and what x^nfwer did he give ?
I never dream'd fo far on as to have him an-
fwer> it always wak'd me.
And what do you think of it yourfelf, fays the
Arbitrator^ do you think he is dead ?
N o, indeed, fays the Father^ I do believe in my
Confcience he is alive, as much as I believe I am
alive myfelfj and I am going to do as wicked a
thing of its Kind as ever any Man did.
Truly, fays the fecond Arbitrator, it begins
to fhock me, I don't know what to fay to it 5 I
don't care to meddle any more with it, I don't
like driving Men to a6t againft their Confciences.
With this the Wife, who, as I faid, having a
little recover'd her Spirits, and efpecially encou-
rag'd, becaufe ihe faw nothing, ftartcd up 5 What's
all this Difcourfe to the purpofe, fays fie^ is it not
all agreed already? what do we come here for?
Nay, fays the firft Arbitrator^ I think we meet
now not to enquire into why it is done, but to
\ execute Things according to Agreement, and what
are we frighted at ?
I ' M not frighted, fays the Wife^ not I ; come,
fays fhe to her Husband haughtily, fign the Deedj
I'll cancel the old Writings if forty Devils were in
the
of APPARITIO N S. 16^
the Room 5 and with that fhe takes up one of the
Deeds, and went to tear ofF the Seal.
That Moment the fame Cafement flew open
again, tho' it was fail in the Infide, juft as it
was before 5 and the Shadow of a Body was
feen^ as flanding in the Garden without, and the
Head reaching up to the Cafement, the Face
looking into the Room, and flaring directly at
the Woman with a ftern and an angry Counte-
noncej Hold, faid the Spe6lre, as iF fpeaking to
the Woman > and immediately clap'd the Cafement
to again, and vanifh'd.
It is impoffible to defcribe here the Confter-
nation this fecond Apparition put the whole Com-
pany intoj the Wife, who was fo bold juft before,
that fhe wou'd do it tho' forty Devils were in the
Room, skream'd out like a VVoman in Fits, and
let the Writing fall out of her Hands: The two
Arbitrators were exceedingly terrify'd, but not fo
much as the ^efl:^ but one of them took up the
Award which they had fign'd, in which they awar-
ded the Husband to execute the Deed to difpofe
of the Eftate from the Son.
I DARE fay, faid he, be the Spirit a good Spi^
rit or a bad, it will not be againft cancelling this;
fo he tore his Name out of the Award, and fo
did the other, by his Example, and both of them
got up from their Seats, and faid they would have
no more to do in it.
But that which was mod unexpcfted of all
was, that the Man himfelf was fo frighted, that he
fainted away ; notwithftanding it was, as it might
be faid, in his favour.
This put an end to the whole Affair at that
time ; and, as I underfland by the Sequel, it did fa
for ever.
The Story has many Particulars more in it, too
Jong to trouble you with ; but two Particulars,
V . M J which
66 The Htjior^ and Reality
which are to the Purpofe, I muft not omit.
Viz.
I. That in about four or five Months more
after this fecond Apparition, the Man's Son arrived
from the Eaft-Indies^ whither he had gone four
Years before in a Portugueze Ship from Lisbon.
2>. That upon being particularly enquired of
about thefe Things, and efpecially whether he had
any Knowledge of them, or any Apparition to him^
or Voices, or other Intimation as to what was do-
ing in England^ relating to him > he affirmed con-
ilantly that he had nor, except that once he drea-
med his Father had written him an angry Letter,
threatning him that if he did not come home he
would difinherit him, and leave him not one Shil-
ling. But he added, that he never did receive any
fuch Letter from his Father in his Life, or from
any one elfe.

ccrnj not but that other Accounts may be as au-

them at fecond or third Hand. When 1 offer thofe
to you, therefore, I tell you honeftly that I have
fuch and luch Relations from good Hands, or I
have fuch a Story by me in Manufcript, and
1 leave you to make fuch ufe of them as you
pleafe.
This Caution of mine, however, ought not to
leflen the Credit of any of the Relations here pub-
lifh'd} for why may not the Account given by a-
nother Hand be as true as this which I give you
from my own Knowledge j and why muft an Au-
thor, in fuch cafes as thefe, be made anfwerable
for the Particulars of every Hiftory, or be bound
to leave it out, which would be the Reader's Lofs,
not his own.
However the following I can vouch from my
own Knowledge. A. B. was a Merchant in Lon-
don, and as he drove a confiderable Trade bcyond-
fea, he eftabliih'd a Fador, or as the Language of
Trade calls it a House, at a certain Port in the
Englijh Colonies in America^ and fent over his Ser-
vants or Apprentices thither, as is ufual for Mer-
chants to do.
One of his faid Apprentices being fitted out,
and ready to Embark, his Cargo being actually on
board the Ship, and the Ship fallen down the Ri-
ver as far as Gravefend\ his Mafter was getting his
Letters and Invoyces, and other Difpatches, ready
for him, he being to go down the River the fame
E vening.
The Hurry which thus difpatching him put his
Mafter into, occafion'd, that when he was call'd to
Dinner at the ufual Hour, he did not take the
young Gentleman with him as ufual, but told him
he muft be content to ftay in the Counting- houfe
'till he came to relieve him.
M 4 Accord-
^8 The Hifiory and Reality
Accordingly Dinner being over, he goes
down to fend him up to Dinner. And when he
came to the Counting-houfe Door, there fat his
Man with the Book-keeper alfo, writing as he left
him.
It happen'd juft that Moment, fome occafion
extraordinary oblig'd him to flep back again, and
go up Stairs to the Dining-Room, from whence he
came J and intending not to ftay, he did not fpeak
to the young Man, but left him in the Counting-
houfe, and went immediately up Stairs.
I T was not poflible that he, or any one elfe, ex-
cept fuchascould walk invisible, could go by, or pais
himunfeen: Good Manners would have hindered the
young Man from thrufting by his Mailer upon the
Stairs, if he had been going up j but he is pofitive
he did not, and cou'd not pafs, without being
feen.
But when he came to the top of the Stairs
there fat the young Man at Dinner with the other
Servants 5 the Room they din'd in being a little
Parlour, which opcn'd juft againft the Stairs, fo
that he faw him all the way of the upper Part of
the Stair-cafe, and could not be deceived.
The Mailer did not fpeak to him, which he
was very forry for afterwards 5 but the Surprize
made him pafs by the Room, and go into the Di-
ning-Room, which was to the right Hand of it,
but he fcnt one immediately to look, and he was
there really at Dinner 5 fo that what he (the Ma-
iler) faw below in the Counting-houfe, mud be the
Apparition, as it certainly was.
But this was not all : The young Gentleman em-
bark'd as above, and arriv'd fafe with all his Effe6ls
in America^ tho' he never liv'd to return. However,
I cannot fay his Apparition in the manner as related
could have the lead Relation to his being fick,
and dying abroad, which was not 'till thv^e
Years
of APP ARirjO NS. i6p
Years afterwards. But what follow'd was of another ,
kind.
This young Man had an elder Brother, who
liv'd in London 'y he was a fine Gentleman, and
a Scholar, and was at that time ftudying Phyfick.
He was alfo a llout brave Gentleman, and in parti-
cular underftood a Sword, that is to fay how to ufc
a Sword, as well as mod Gentlemen^in England,
He had an accidental Rencounter with a Gentle-
man in the Street, in that fhort Street which goes
out of Fket'fireet into Salisbury-Court -^ and being
fo compleat a Mailer of his Weapon, he wounded
his Antagonift, and drove him into a Tavern in the
Street, from whence came out two Men more up-
on him with their Swords, but both of them found
the Gentleman fo much an Over-match for them,
that they left him as fail as the firftj whereupon a
fourth came our, not with a Sword, but a Fire-
Fork taken haftily up out of the Tavern Kitchen, and
running at this Gentleman with it, knock'd him
down, and broke his Skull, of which Wound he
afterwards died.
While this was done in London^ his Brother,
as far off 2iS Bofton in New-England^ writing to his
Mafter the Merchant, (and who gives this Account
of it) after other Bufinefs, writ this Poftfcript.
S IR^ I beg you will be pleas'd in your Return to
this to let me havefame Account^ as much as conve-
niently may hey of how my Brother doesy and
what Condition he is in ; which you will excufa
my Importunity for^ when you read the follow^
ing Acccount^ (viz.)

Now this Letter was fo dated, that it was im-
poffible any Account could be fent of the Difafter,
that could reach thither in that timej for it was
not dated above fourteen Days after the Fa6t was
committed in London -y
and that it was Genuine I
am well afllir'd, becaufe I faw the Letter within
an Hour after it was received in London^ read it my
felf, and knew the young Man's Hand, and the
young Man aifo perfe6i:ly well, as I did his Brothei
that was kiU'd alfo, very intimately.
The young Man was fober, religious and fend-
blc, not given to Whimfie, or light-headed Fancies,
notvapourifhordiftemper'd, not apt to fee double, 01
to dream wakmg, as many of our Apparition-making
people arej he was bcfides that a Scholar, and
very ferious : the firll I mention as a Prot€6kion tc
him from foolifh Imagination, and the laft fronc
Falfhoodj and I am fatisfy'd, the Reader may de-
pend upon both the Stories, 1 mean as to the TrutF
of them.
I N my fpeaking of Apparitions as I have ftatec
the Cafe, I muft take leave to differ from the No-
tions of the .Ancients, who 'tis evident underftooc
all Apparition to be the Souls, or as we call them,
the Ghofts, of departed Perfonsj but when the)
came to make rational Conclufions from thofe firfi
Opinions, What wild Additions were they driver,
to make, to the firfb juft Conceptions which the)
Jiad form'd in their Mmd% ?
of AP P ARITIO N S. 171
Their firft Conceptions, / fay^ were indeed juft,
lonfiflenc with Reafon, and with Nature > for they
roncluded, that when the Body is dead, and the
>oul feparated, the State was determin'd. This
Ay. Pop exprefles very well in his Tranflation of

This was, I fay, a rational and juft Sentiment
j
mi then they were confounded in ail thofe Imagi-

''riends, as if come back from thofe eternal Shades j
,nd how to reconcile this they did fiot know.
To get over this Difficulty, they were driven to
llrange Shifts, and fome of them it muft be con-
cfs'd were very fooliih ones : fuch as thefej

Bones were depofited in an Urn, and that Urn bury'd

Mgyptians^ which gave the Soul a Shape like the
Body, and that it v/as only a Receptacle of the f
Mind 'y the Mind they made to be the fublime and
fuperior Part, and that only.
Thus in the Cafe of Apparitions, they allow'd
that this Cafe or Shell call'd the Soul, might ap-
pear after Death, but the Mind could nor, but
was exalted among the Gods, and took up its Eter-

This laft Notion, tho' grofs and abfurd in ic
felf, was the utmoft Refuge they had, by which to
folve the Difficulty of Apparitions. They imagin'd
that the Soul was not only feparatcd by Death from
the Body, but that there was a Separation of the
Underftanding from its Cafe or Vehicle, as they
caird it> fo that the Soul, which was but the 1-
mage and Form of the Body, might be in Hell 5

Defcription at large.
What learned Nonfenfe, and wiiat a greai
deal of it is here, to reconcile a thing, which upor
the Chriftian Foundation is made as eafie, as an}
thing not immediately vifible to the common Eye,
can be made ?
Nature di£bated, and Reafon confirm'd, thai
the firft Principle, namely, the Soul, or as the)
call it, the Mind or Underflanding, fled to Heaver
immediately after Death, and return'd no more.

many Apparitions of the Dead to the Livings ai
particularly in the famous Example of C^far ap-
pearing to Brutus: and this perplex'd them fo, that
they knew not how to fupport the Principle of the
Soul not returning, under the Experience of Souls
adtually returning in Apparition, vifiting and con-
verfing with then* Friends, which was incontefli-
ble, daily Experience making it known to all
Parties.
To reconcile this they fled to Invention, and
firft to that of the Interval between the Death and
the
of AVVARir ION S. i7y
the Funeral of the departed Souls j of which be-
fore.
But this is liable to fo many jufl: Exceptions,
fo many Abfurdities, that it could not facisfic Men
of Senfe > for firft they were obliged to fay and
prove, (which would be very difficult) that none of
the Souls of the Dead ever appear'd after the Func*
ral Rites were folemnizedj which if one Example
had contradifted, all the Arguments in the World
could not then have fupported the Fiftionj and
this I cannot doubt was contradided on many Oc-
cafions.
. And this no doubt made the ancient Syftem of
the JEgypians be reviv'd, and pafs better among
them afterwards 3 tho' whether the Romans received
it or no, we do not find afcertain'd in any Part of
their Hiftory.
Besides, there was an Abfurdity in the very
Do6trinc it felf j for if the Apparition of a departed
Soul was limited by this Circumftance of burning
the Body, or performing the Funeral Rites > it put
the State of the Dead in that particular Refpcdt into
the Power of the Living : for Example^ If the Living,
who had PofTeflion of the dead Bodies of Perfons
(lain, fuppofe them Friends, had PofTeffion of the
Body, the Soul of that Body, tho' unembodied and
difmifs'd, could not be admitted to reft, or as they
exprefs'd it,couidnot pafs into the Shades or Realms
below > fo if the Enemy had PofTeflion of the Body,
it was in the Power of the Enemy to keep the
Soul out of Heaven : an Abfurdity fo grofs, one
would think the wifer Heathens could never enter-
tain fuch a Thought: Yet that fuch it was, the
Words of Patrocim\ Ghoft quoted from Homer
makes evident.
Let my pale Corfe the Rites of Burial know^
And give me Entrance in the Shades helow,
Unhap-
1 7(J The Hijlory and Reality
Unhappy Patroclus! How grofs would this
found, how harih and unmufical in our Times,
when Chriftianity has given us more juft Ideas of
things? Patroclus could not get leave to go to the
Shades below, 'till his Funeral Rites were per*
form'd 'y that is, in our Senfc, could not be admitted,
no not into Hell it fclf, 'till his Body was burn'd
on the Funeral Pile or Pyre, and his Afhes depo-
fited in an Urn -, that is, buried like a Gentleman.
B Y which Rule, the Souls of thofe poor Crea-
tures who were killed in the Wars, and were left
unburied in Heaps in the Field, or only a Pile of
Stones thrown upon them, as was often the Cafe,
are wandring Hill, and neither admitted into Hea-
ven or Hell.
Again, it was in the Power of the Enemy, if
he had a Body in Poflcffion, to prefervc his Hatred
againft that Enemy even beyond Death, and by keep-
ing him unburied, keep his Soul or Spirit fufpended,
wandring, and forgotten in the Air, and neither ad-
mitted to one or other Place, whether above or
below.
Thus Jchilles had the Body of Hedlor in his
Power twelve Days, and Hom$r brings him in
triumphing over his Enemy in that cafe, and in a
manner unworthy of a Man of Honour. When he
fpeaks to the Ghoft of his j^riend Patroclus^ and
vows to facrifice twelve Trojan Prifoners ac his Fu-
neral Pile i he adds,
Achilles' Promife is compleat^
^e bloody He&or J^retch'd before thy Feet^
Lof to the Dogs his Carcafe I refign.
Gloomy he faidy and horrible in Fiew^
Before the Bier the bleeding Hedor threWy

So again, Achilles mourning over the Body of Pa^
troclus as it lay on the Funeral Pile, and the Fire
not yet J<:indled j I fay, there again he threatens to
deny Hedior a Soldier's Burial.
But heavier Fates on Heftor'j Corfe attend.
Kept from the Flames for hungry Dogs to rend.
This was a terrible Curfe, and very cruel to poor
HeBor after he was dead, not to fuffer his Soul to
enter into the Shades below, which would be (to fpealc
ic in our Language) not to give him leave to go to
Hell > that the Gods it feems thwarted AchilleSy
and would not let his Cruelty take place, but he
was oblig'd to grant Priam a Truce, and let the
^Trojans bury him.
So [pake he, threatning: But the Gods made vain
His I'hreat, and guard inviolate the Slain,
Celeftial Venus hover''d o\r his Head,
And ro
feat Unguents, heavenly Fragrance I fhed^
She watch'd him all the Night, and all the Day,
And drove the Blood-hounds from their deflin'd Prey,
So that the Burying of HeBor was made the Care
of the Gods, defeating the cruel Vengeance of
Achilles,
To what Length did this foolifli Notion of the
Ancients carry this Point ! putting it into the Power
of a Man's Enemy to keep his Soul out of Heaven
itoo, as long as his Enemy thought fit to keep the
Body out of the Grave.
Happy it is for us in thefe malicious Days that
tit is otherwife herej when not Enemies only, but
leven cruel Creditors, might arreft the dead Body of
itheir Debtor, and even fend the Soul of him to the
Devil, or keep it hovering and wandring in the Air
'till their Debts were paid : As Times go now, and
N as
178 The H'tfiory and Reality
as Chanty ftands now rated among us, no poor
Debtor could be at Reft any more after he was Dead,
than he could before, 'till his Debts were all paid.
Nay, tho' it had pleas'd a merciful Father to
forgive him his Sins, and as we allow it*s poflible,
in fpi^e of the cruel 2" S that a
Brankrupt may die in the State of a pardoned Peni-
tent > yet I fay 'till the Debt was paid the more
inexorable Creditor fhould refufe to let him be ad-
mitted into Heaven 'till he was paid the utmoft
Farthing.
I MUST confefs if this were the Cafe among
us, I believe it would be the hardeft thing in the
World to get a poor Bankrupt's Compofition ac-
cepted, or his Certificate fignedj for if it was in
the Power of the Creditors to fend their Debtor?
to the Devil^ I fhould be apt to fay with the Di-
fciples of our Lord, Who then jhall he fa-ved?
How often do we find a Creditor give it foV ai
Anfwer, when a folliciting Friend comes beggin
him to compound, and to accept the utmoft Shi
ling that the Debtor has to offer: How often,
fay^ do we find the cruel Creditor reply, No not 1
nifign none of it^ the Devil Jhall have him before /'i
fign it?
Nay, if his Soul was to hover in the Air, ;
the Ancients fiuicy'd, 'till the Body was buried 5
queltion whether they would let the Debtor go eii
ther to Heaven or Hell 'till they had their Money
efpecially if the hovering or wandering in the A,
was a worfe Condition, as 1 don^t know but, whi
the Devils are faid to be there, it may.
But to return to the Ancients and their Not)
^on of Futurity, and of Souls departed, the Dil
'
culty, as I have obferved, was very perplexinj^
They granted that after the Souls of Men wci
once determined, and tranfported in Charon's Ferr|
boat 10 the other fide of the River *S'/jvv, or tji
Sty
of APPARITION S. 179
'iJ^/^^Gulph, they could return no more 5 and all
their other Fables upon that Suhje6t would have
been overthrown and come to nothing, if it had
been otherwife j fuch as Cerberus barking continual-
ly at the Gate, Charon the Ferry-man carrying all
over but bringing none back, and the like.
But notwithllanding this, as I have laid, they
found feveral of thefe Souls viliting the World in
Apparition, and this quite deftroy'd all the Scheme
of their being in a determin'd States fo that they
knew not what to think of next.
How would it have unravell'd all thofe hard
Knots, and made every thing eafie to their Undcr-
flanding, had they been let into this juft way of
reafoning ? had they difcover'd that there is an An-
gelick World, an invifible World of Spirits, fome
of whom being placed by their merciful Maker,
as an advanc'd Body, at or near the outer Circum-
ference of the Earth's Atmofphere, have a Power
given them at leaft to take Cognizance of human
Affairs J and to converfe with this World, either
by Apparition, Voices, Noifes, good or bad Omens,
or other fenfible Conveyances to the Mind, by
which they can give Notices of Good or Evil, and
can intimate to Man many things ufeful to him
in the Condudt of his Life.
That the Spirits inhabiting this invifible World
are at band> (how near is not neceflary to us to
know) can afTume Bodies, Shape, Voice, and even
can perfonate this or that Man or Woman 5 fo as
to appear in the very Figure, Countenance, and
Cloaths or Drefs of our departed Friends, fpeak
with their proper and di{lin6i: Voices, and in the
fir ft Perfon of this or that particular Man or Wo-
man, and in their Names ^ and can thus fuit them-
felves in their feveral Appearances, to the Occa-
fion they appear for:
N z Hai>
i8o The Hijlory and Reality
Had they known thefc things, I fay, they
would have rejoic'd in the Difcovery, and it would
have made every thing cafie to them. Patroclm
would never have troubled Achilles with a Vifit
from the Air, upon pretence of his being left to
be wandring about the Atmofphere for want of
his Funeral Rites j the Dogs, or the Crows, or the
Worms might have feafted themfelves on He^of^
Carcafs, it would never have difturb'd He6ior in the
leaft, much Icfs would her Goddefs-fhip Ferns have
concern'd herfelf to proteft his Corps 'till the fu-
neral Pile was prepared.
The Dodrine of the Soul's being a Shell or
Cafe form'd into a Shape, as a Mould is form'd into
Shape to receive the Brafs or Copper, and throw
cut a Statue or Figure of this or that Heroe, which
it is appointed to form > I fay, this abfurd Do6brine
of the Soul, Body and Mind being three diftin6t
Perfons in every Man, would not have found Place
in the World j but all things would have been
conceiv'd regularly of, and the World would have
been rightly informed of future things, as well as
of things prefent.
However, to bring it down to our Cafe, all
this concurs to the Do&rine of Spirits, and the
Reality of their Appearance, which is the Cafe be-
fore us: Their Friends departed did appear 5 what
it was appeared they knew not, only negatively
they knew it was not their Bodies, however the
Shape might be aflumed 5 nor could they reconcile
that Part to their Underftanding. How it could
be, that the Body feem'd to appear and did not
appear} or, as we might fay, appear'd as if they
had appear'd 5 but when a Tryal was ofFer'd, no
Body could be found, as was the Cafe of PatrO'
(lus and Acbillcs in Homsr^ which Mr. Pope thusi
tranflates,
of APPARITIONS. i8i
He faid^ and with his longing Arms ejfafd
In vain to grafp the vijionary Shade,
Like a thin Smoke he fees the Spirit fly
j
And hears a feeble lamentable Cry,
How grofs an Ignorance is here in fo great a
Man as Achilles ? to go about to grafp a Vifion ! to
feel a Shade ! One can hardly exciife the Poet for
allowing Achilles^ who was the Heroe of the whole
Poem, CO be fo weak, even in thofe Daysj but ic
muft be allowed 'twas all in a Dream, and imagi-
nary, and it niight well awake him indeed, as ic
did, to grafp at a Man in Armour, and find nothing
in his Arms but Smoke.
The Refult of it all is this, namely, the Re-
ality of Apparition was a certain, undoubted, and
received thing > 'tis evident that they were noc
queftioned j for upon the Reality of the Appear-
ance of Souls, all thofe Pains were taken to fettle
the Poffibility of it. That it was fo, the Fre-
quency of the thing left them no Room to que-
ftionj it would have been ridiculous to have dif-
puted it 5 but how it could be, how to reconcile
it to all the Notions of Soul and Body, the fu-
ture and the prefenc State, that was what no bo-
dy could explain, and no body could undcrftand 5
which Ignorance put their Invention fo much on the
Rack to find out and form Schemes for the bringing
the Particulars together, and making the Appearance
poffible, whichthey daily found was in Fad real.
'TwAs a little ftrange that tho' they were
fatisfied by daily Demonftration that the Thing
was true, yet they were obliged to believe it was
not true at the fame time. They frequently faw
their Friends appear, and yet knew they were noc
in a Condition from whence they could return to
appear. But the ftrangcft thing of all, at leaft to
N J me^
iSz The Hifiory and Reality
me, is, that they iliould not, all this while, con-
ceive the* Poflibility of Spirits aflliming human
Shape, and appearing in their Figures, in their
Shapes, and in their Names.
This would have put an end to all the Dif-
ficulty, and have reconciled all the Doubts that
attended it, and at the fame time would have led
them into feveral fublime Truths, fuch as they
were perhaps perfeftly ignorant of; as particularly
into the great Do6trine of the Unity of infinite
Power > the univerfal Empire of Providence, and its
Government and Influence of and upon all the
Affairs of this World, even the moft minute things
in Life; and many other valuable Inquiries.
That Apparitions were believed to be real in
thofe Days, is evident from many Inftances of it given
in Hiftory, tho' I have not room to look far back.
'Tis faid that Alexander the Great was haunted by the
Ghoft of his Friend Clitus^ whom he had mofl un-
gratefully tortur'd to Death, after a long Series of
the moft faithful Services, and fuccefsful alfo; but
there is no particular Account of it in Plutarch.
/.The Apparition of the Ghoft of Julius Cafar
to Brutus a little before the Battel at Philippic tho'
it be certain, is neverthelefs varioufly reported 5
feme Accounts relate it to be the Ghoft of Julius
Cafar^ and vulgar Opinion concurs with that Re-
port; which is fo receiv'd at this time, that they
fhow you an original antient Piece of fine Italian
Painting at Naples^ where the Phantome is repre-
fented bloody and wounded, with Cafca's Dagger
fticking in his Shoulder, which he, Cafca^ reaching
his Arm over his Shoulder fix'd in or near his Col-
lar Bone before, and left flicking there; according
to which our Frontefpiece to this Work is at lealt
defign'd: Whether that Part of the Story be right
reprciented or not, is difficult to determine.
But
of APPARITIONS. 183
But according to other Accounts, the Appari-,
tion was only of a Man, without any Similitude
of C<efars and that when Brutus^ who was bufy
writing Difpatches for his Army which was then
drawing together to fight the O^avian Troops,
look'd up and faw him, he boldly ask'd, JVJoat art
thou ? and the Apparition anfwcr'd,/*^;;; thy evilGemuSj
and I will meet thee again at Philippi > to which the
undaunted Hero, unconcern'd at the Sight, and as
if he defir'd him not to difturb him at that time,
he being then otherwife engaged, anfwer'd, J-Fell^
ril meet thee there^ and fo went on with his wri-
ting.
B RUfUS was, without doubt, a Hero in his
pcrfonal Valour, and more fo in his Principle, viz,
the Love of Liberty, and of his Country j and as
nothing but the Zeal for the Liberty of his Coun-
try could have embark'd him againft the Life of
defar^ who was otherwife his Benefa6]:or, fo he
was above the Fear of Death, and could not be in
the lead daunted at the Fore-knowledge of his Fate
^x. Philippic feeing he had the Notion of Life which
was general at that time, namely, that a true He-
roe could never be miferable, fince it was always
in his Power to die a Freeman, and not to out-live
any threatned Calamity, whether Perfonal or Na-
tional.
Upon this foot he enter'd that unequal Battel
againfl the OEiavianTroo^s with an undaunted Chear-
fulnefsj for he was fare one way or other to come
off vidorious i that is to fay, that if Augufitts con-
quered his Army, he knew how to conquer J!f^/^/^///ii
if by the Slaughter of his Troops Cafar had the
better of him, and defeated his Defigns for the Li-
berty of his Country, He, by the Slaughter of him-
felf, knew how to defeat Aiiguftus in his Deligns of
conquering ^n/;f//J, lince he refblv'd to die free, and
not furvive the Roman Liberty 5 and fo he did.
N 4 And
184 The Hijlory and Reality
And upon this Foundation it was, that he was
fo unconcerned at his approaching Fate, and fo
undaunted in his looking at and fpeaking to the
Speftrc that appeared to him.
But we have yet abundance more Proofs by
Example of the Reality of Apparitions.
ALA RICH the famous Gothick King, who o-
ver-run fo much of the Roman Empire, had an Ap-
parition which came to him, and told him he
ihould undertake his Expedition againft the Romans^
and that promised him Viftory and Succefs j fomc
faid it was an Angel, others that it was the Ghoft
of his deceafed PredecefTor Rhadagaifeus, When he
firft undertook to raife his Army he v/as intending
to go upon a glorious Expedition to the Eaft, to
wity againft the Hums and the Heruli 5 that is to
fay, into Poland^ Sdavonia and Hungaria^ and per-^
haps Mufeovy or Ruffta. But upon the iVpparition
fpeaking to him, he was encourag'd to undertake a
War againft the Romans in Italy-y where notwith-
flanding he was routed and utterly overthrown by
Stilko 5 he afterwards returned into Italy^ kilPd
Stilico the Roman General, over- run the Country^
and took and plundered the City of Rome it felf 5
this was Ann. 409 : fo that the A pparition,of what-
ever kind it was, muft be fo far Angelic as to fore-
know Events and Iflues of things on Earth, which
muft be fuitable to the Angelic Heavenly Spirits,
and fuperior to the Diabolic Spirits who know
nothing Prophetic.
Nor is it any thing inconfiftent with the An"-
gclic exalted and good Spirits} for this was not
encouraging Evil, but ftirring up a powerful
Prince, who was to be Flagellum Dei^ to exe-
cute the Divine Vengeance upon that wicked Peo-
ple the Romans^ whom God had refolved to deftroy,
or at leafl to reduce very low : like as God is
faid
of APP/IRITIO NS. i8j
faid to flir up Nehuchadnezzar King of Bahylon to
come up againft Jerufakm.
I s A Y this could not be the Devil, be-
caufe (as I have always infifted upon it^fo I do ftill)
that he knows nothing of what is to comej the
Devil is no [Prophet, he cannot foretell or predi6t,
other than by probable Guefles, rational Confe-
quences, and fuch Circumftances in which he can
go farther than other People.
You have an Example of this in the famous
5orcerefs Ja^uelim ; flie pretended to fpeak in the
Name of the Devil, and fometimes to have the
Devil fpcak in her, jind fo to give Anfwers as by an
Oracle, and refolve Doubts and difficult Queftions,
which fhe did to Admiration 5 and thereby got both
Fame and Money. Now it was obferv'd that when
People came to her with Doubts and difficult Cafes,
even fuch as none could refolve, relating to things
paft or prefent, her Anfwers were furprizing j but
if they came to her to ask any Opinion of things
future, and what fhould be to come, the Devil was
always Nonpluft, and generally lyed in his Anfwers
5
fo that none eould depend upon any thing he faid.
In a word the Devil was not able to foretell any
thing 3 and hence I infer, as I have always faid, the
Devil is no Prophet, he can predift nothing, for
he knows nothing 5 and thatif any Apparition comes
to be feen or heard, who takes upon it to tell
what fliould come to pafs, you may depend upon it
that Apparition is not from the Devil.
Hence 1 think we may readily account for
that Story fo well publifli'd, whether fo well
known or no,of which Mr. j^uheyh^s given us the
lafl: Relation, as follows
:
"Two Perfons (Ladies) of Quality, both not
" being long fince deceafed, were intimate Acquain-
''
tance,and lov'd each other intirely : It fo fell our,
*'
that one of them fell fick of the Small-Pox, and
" deiired
1^6 The Hifiory and Reality
«' defired mightily to fee the other, who would
" not come, fearing the catching of them j the
'' Afflided at laft dies of them : llie had not been
" buried very long, but flie appears at the other's
*' Houfe in the drefs of a Widow, and asks for her
'' Friend who was then at Cards, but fends down
*' her Woman to know her Bufinefs > who in
*' fhort told her, flie muft impart it to none but
*' her Lady, who after (he had received this An-
" fwer, bid her Woman have her into a Room5and
" defire her to flay till the Game was done, and
^' ilic would wait on her. The Game being done,
*' down Stairs fhe came to the Apparition, to know
*^ her Bufinefs. Madam^ fays the Ghofl turning up
^' her Veil, and her Face appearing full of the
*' Small- Pox, Tou know "very well that you and I
*' lov'd intirely^ and your not coming to fee me I took
" fo ill at your Hands^ that I could not reft ''till I had
^^
feen you^ and now I am come to tell you^ that you
*' have not long to live^ therefore prepare to die 5 and
*' when you are at a Teaft^ and make the thirteenth in
*^ Number^then remember my Words > and fo the Ap-
*^ parition vanifh'd. To conclude, fhe was at a
^' Feafl where fhe made the thirteenth Perfon in
'^ Number ^ and was afterwards asked by the de-
ceafed's Brother, whether his Sifter did appear to
her, as was reported 3 fhe mads him no Anfwer,
but fell a weeping, and died in a little time after.
^' The Gentleman that told this Story, fays, that
" there is hardly any Perfon of Quality but what
'^ knows it to be true.
'
|
I D o not enter into an Enquiry here whether the
'
Story is true or no, I believe it in Common, for it
was generally believ'd to be true : But 'tis flrange
to have this brought for an Evidence of the Pre-
fcienceoftheD^w73 whereas on the contrary it con*
firms what I have faid, vi%. That this cou'd not be
the Devilyox what we call the Appearance of the De*
of APPARITIONS, 187
i)/7, no, nor could it be the Soul of the departed
Perfonj and for the Apparition faying it could not
be at Reft, either it may be put in by fome of the very
many Authors relating the Story j or it might be
faid by the good Angel or Spirit appearing, to in-
troduce her Meflage, and to rouze the Mind of the
Perfon fpoken to by fomething that fhould touch
her more to the quick, be the more feeling, and
fenfible to her, and fo make a due Impreflion upon
her of the Truth of that which was to follow.
But firft, for its not being the Devil y for I
have granted that the Devil may make an Appari-
tion, tho* far from inferring from thence that all
Apparitions are the Devil: But 1 fay as to its not
being the Devil that appear'd here, in the Shape of
the deceas'd Lady, 'tis Evident,
FIRSI'^ Becaufe, as I faid above, and have re-
peated often, the Devil cannot prcdift, he has no
Prefcience of things before they are in Views he
can juggle and play fcurvy Tricks of many kinds,
as when he prophefied to the Farmer the Fall of
his Stack of Corn, and then rais'd a fudden Storm
and blew it down. It may be he can fee atifomc
farther Diftance than we can, and judge of the Confe-
quences of fuch and fuch Caufes better than we
can, and with a more perfe6b and exa6t Judgment,
But to predict things which are only concealed in
the Womb of Time, and behind the Curtain of
Providence, as this of Life and Death was, it is
not in Satan to do it j and therefore this could not
be from the Devil : the Lady was in Health, was
Chearful, nay Merry, was at a Feaft and at Cards.
Here was no Signal of Death, or fo much as of
Sicknefs : I fee no token of the Devil in ithis Ap-
parition 5 except it be his extraordinary Civility
that he would not interrupt her Game.
SECONDLT^ It could not be the Devil^
becaufe of his bidding the Lady prepare for Deaih >
which,
i88 The Hijlory and Reality
which, as I have often obferv'd, does not feem to be
much of Satan's Bufinefs, not being very fuitable
to his Difpofition, and lefs to his Defign.
There is fome little Incongruity in this Story
too, which renders it inconfiftent, not with the De-
<vil only, but even with the Nature of a Spirit or
Apparition: As (i) Why fhould the Apparition come
when the Lady was engag'd and could not fpeak
to her ? as if flie, being a Ghoft or Spirit as we
vulgarly exprefs it, did not know what ilie
was doing, as well as where fhe was? (2,) How docs
her taking ill the living Lady's notvifiting her, ob-
lige her to come and give her this kind Notice of
her Death ?j / took it fa ill at your Hands^ that 1
could not refi ^till I hadfeen you.
Tho' this does not ihock my Belief of the
Apparition it felf 5 yet it feems to hint that the
feveral Hands thro' which the Relation has pafs'd,
have made up the Speech for the Ghoft, and com-
mitted fome Blunders in it,that are indeed fliocking
to the Reader.
I T feems more rational to be as I have read the
Story, that the Ghoft fhould fay thus : 'I'ho' I took
it 'very ill at your Hands that you wou'd not come to \
fee me-y yet I could not reft 'till I had feenyou^ to^
tell you that you have not long to live^ and that you
Jhould prepare^ 6cc. This is much better Senfe, and
more agreeable to the Nature of the thing j for
certainly coming in that manner to give the Lady
Notice of the Approach of her End, and tocoun-
fel her to prepare accordingly^ muft be allow'd to be
an a6t of Kindnefs, not of Refentment, and a Te-
ftimony of the AfFeftion that was between them 5 and
therefore her taking it ill that fhe had not been to
Vifit her in her lllncfs, could not rationally be
given as a Reafon for it.
But as to the Apparition it felf, fince it could
not be the Soul of the deceas'd Lady, and for the
Reafons
of APPARITIO NS. i8<?
Reafons above was not likely to be the Devil^ or I
may venture to fay pofitively was not the Devil ^
What then was it ? 1 anfvver with a Queftion :
What could it be but a good Angel, or Angelic
Spirit from the Invifible World, lent with a Mef-
fage of Goodnefs, and a merciful Notice of her
Approaching Death j that {he might receive a due
caution, preparing her Mind and turning her
Thoughts to a proper Meditation upon fo ferious a
SLibjed y in a word, warning her of Death that ftie
might prepare for it ?
The Story of Sir John Burroughs^s Son, who
forfaking a Miftrefs in Italy flie murther'd her felf,
and then haunted him as long as he liv*d, this is
of like kind with the reft > and tho' the Devil to
worry and perplex him might take up the Appea-
rance of his Whore, as well reproaching him with
the Crime, as with her Tragical Endj yet it goes
no farther than this, that the Devil may appear, and
may harrafs and terrify thofe he appear'd to, and
this I make no doubt of j and it rather adds to
what is infifted on, I mean the Reality of Appari-
tions •, but the Devil gave this Gentleman no good
advice to repent,or prepare, and the like 5 but only
appear'd, frighted, and terrify'd him to the very
Day of his Death.
I T is alfo remarkable, that tho' this Devil in
Apparition fhewed it felf to him the very Day of
his Death, (for he was kill'd that Day in a Duel)
yet it faid not a word to him of what was to befall
him, or of what he was going to do, and 'tis very
probable did not know it.
There is another Story fomething but darkly
recorded of Charles VII. of France^ which feems
likely enough to be an Apparition of the Devil.
That King had been diftemper'd and very ill two or
three times, but was recover'd again tolerably well,
»nd was riding for the Benefit of the Air in the
Foreft-
ipo The Hifiory and Reality
Forcfl of Mans : On a fudden a Spedre ftarts up 01
out of the Woodsj being a tall meagre ill-look'c
old Man, of ghaftly Countenance and half naked,
and coming diredly to the King takes hold of hi:
Horfe's Bridle, and fays, Stop^ King: Whether go you \
you are hetrafd : and then immediateiy vanifhed
Now firft of all, this was a falihood in Faft, fo]
the King was not betray'd by any body 5 neithe
"was there any Plot againfl him, or againfl: any thai
belong'd to him, ever heard of before, or after
wards j on the contrary. Secondly^ his Reign wait
at that time peaceable and quiet, his Subje6ts al

A GOOD Spirit, an Angelic Spirit, one of th<
Sacred Guard I have fuppos'd to be placed abou
this Earth, or in the Regions adjacent, and em-
ployed by their Bountiful Maker for the good o
Mankind, would never \
have come in fuch a man-

have put on a fierce and frightful Countenance.
thus to have terrified a poor diftemper'd Prince
whofe Brain was already diforder'd 5 taking the ad-
vantage of his Weaknefs, and fo to encreafe th(
Frenzy and Diftradion of his Mind even to hij

This mightily differ'd from the Condu6b of the
feveral Spirits appearing in the Examples mention'c
before, and who kindly warn'd the Perfons of Dan-
ger, foretold Events that they might avoid them,
or prepare for the Confequencesj in a word, this
was an Apparition purely Devilijh^^ox it wasmeerlj
to do Evil, and to the ruin of the Perfon to whoi
it appear'd.

and comes to do hurt, he is a Lover and the Au-

Fountain of all Good, and appears always for good

Obfervation, and a Rule for us to judge of the Na-

CHAP. X.
Of the different Nattire of Apparitions ;
how we Jhould behave to them ; when to
be afraid of or concerned about them^ and
when not,
DANGER maybe the Reafon of Caution;
but Guilt only is the reafon of Fear. Caution
is the Mind's juft Regard to the Evil in view> but
Fear is a Horror of the Soul, in apprehcnfion of
fome farther Evil yet out of view ; unfeen, and
therefore terrible 5 merited, and therefore dreadful.
If there were no Guilt in the Mind, Death it
felf would be no Evil, and therefore not the Sub-
je6t of our Fearj nor is Death it felf our Fear now
as it is in it felf a meer pafHng out of life, otherwife
than as it is an inlet of (brae terrible State beyond ic.
It is not what v/e pafs out of, that is the bitternefs,
but what we pafs into 5 not what we part with, but
what the Exchange will be 5 not the leap out of
Light, but the leap into the Dark : and to come
nearer to it, the Thought of what is beyond Death
is only made better or worfe by what we know
on this fide of it \ the Dread of what is to come, is
founded on our confcious fenfe of what is paft.
This State beyond Death is made our Terror,
as we expeCt in it the Punifliment of Offences, a
Retri-
ip2 The Hijlory and Reality
Retrbitution for an ill-fpent Life, and as we have
upon our Minds a Senfe of Guilt 5 that is to fay, a
Confcience of having ill-fpent our paft time, and
dreading the Juftice of the Superior Hand, in whom
is the Power of Rewards and Puniihments. Now
to bring it to the cafe in Hand.
All. Apparition is look'd upon as a fomething
coming, or fent tous,from that State o^ Beingwhich
is beyond Death, and therefore is look'd upon with
the fame Terror and Fright, which we are feiz'd
with at the Thoughts of Death it felf
Hence, if we could confider calmly the Nature
of the Apparition which we fee, we might pre-
fcntly know whether we had reafon to be terrified
at the Apparition,^^^^ or no: If the Apparition comes
with a MefTage of Peace, if it reprehends with
Kindnefs and Tendernefs, if it admoniihes with Gen-
tlenefs, and gives Advice to amend and reform, it
certainly comes from a good Hand, and we need be
under no concern at all about it, becaufc it has no
Evil in it felf.
I F it come in all its threatning Poftures, ghaftly
as the Devil can make it, horrible as himfelf in Per-
^n 5 yet were there no Guilt there would be no
fear from the Apparition, or even from the Devil ap-
pearing in Perfon j becaufe we fhould know our
felves to be out of his Power.
As then the Good or Evil of the Meflage,
which the Apparition brings, diftinguifhes the Ap-
parition it felf, and tells us of what kind it is 5 fo
as our Minds are, or are not intimidated by our own
Guilt, fo we have or' have not reafon to be fur-
priz'd at the Appearance of a Meflengerjor Meflen-
gers, from the inviQble World, or at whatever he
iball fay.

Mr.
of d?? ARiriONS, ip3
Mr. ^tibery gwts us the Story in his MifceJIanea of.
the Apparition loCaJhio Burroughs^ Efqj in the tinle
of King Charles I, and which 1 hinted at juft now
on another occafionj the Story is as follows :
''
Sir John Burrouglos being fent Envoy to
" the Emperor by King Charles L did take his
" Eldeft Son Cajhio Burroughs tiXong with him;
^} and taking his Journey through Italy left his faid
Son at Florence^ to learn the Language j where
he having an Intrigue with a beautiful Courti-
fan, Miftrcfs to the Grand Duke, their Fami-
liarity became fo publick, that it came to the
Duke's Ear, who took a Refolution to have him
murder'd j but Cafiio having had timely notice
of the Duke's Deiign, by £bme of the Englijb
there, immediately left theCity without acquamt-
ing his Millrefs of it, and came to England.
Whereupon the Duke being difappointed of his
Revenge, fell uf^on his Miltrefs in mod reproach-
ful Language : She, on the other, fide refenting
the fudden departure of her Gallant, of whom
{he was mod paffionately cnamour'd, killed her
felf. At the fame Moment that fhe expired fhe
did appear to Cajhio at his Lodgings in London.
Colonel Re?nes was then in Bed with him, who
faw her as well as he, giving him an account of
her Refentments of his Ingratitude to her, in
leaving her fo fuddenly, and expofing her to the
Fury of the Duke 5 not omitting her own Tra-
gical E^it 5 adding withall, that he fhould be
flain in a Duel 5 which accordingly happen'd :
And thus fhe appear'd to him frequently, even
when his younger Brother (who afterwards was
Sir John) was in Bed with him. As often as llic
did appear he would cry out with great Shrieking
and Trembling of his Body, as well as Anguifh
of Mind, faying, O GOD! here Jhe comes^ pe
comes I and ac this rate (he appear'd 'till he was
Q 'WdllU
ip4 ^^ Hifiory and Reality
*' kill'd. She appeared to him the Morning before
*' he was killed. Some of my Acquaintance (fays
*' Auhery) have told me, that he was one of the
*'^ handfomeft Men in England^ and very Valiant.
The Appearance of this Devil^ for I can call it
no other, had nothing in View but to harrafs
plague and afFright the Gentleman : Perhaps ex-
pefting it fhould bring him into fome fit of Defpe-
ration j fo to deftroy himfelf, as the Woman whc
appear'd had done before.
The Gentleman whom it appear'd to, was con
fcious of Crime J the Woman in whofe Ihape thf
Devil thus harrafs'd him was a Courtefan^ that is ii
Englijh a Common Woman, with whom he ha(
had an Intrigue in Italy : He had not only beei
difhoneft with her, but it feems had been difhonel
to her 5 and the laft, with the affiftance of th
Devil^ had it feems work'd fo upon her Rage as t(
caufe her to be her own Executioner} and I tak
the Apparition to be the Devil purfuing the fam»
Management, and endeavouring to produce thi
fame EfFefl: upon him.
Now fee the Confequence of Crime: the fenfi
of Guilt makes this Apparition dreadful to him
when it appear*d, he trembles^ falls into Convul
fions, cries out, O GOD! here Jhe comes f and in
word, is in an Agony of horror and afFright.
HA D he only convers'd with the Lady as a comi
mon Acquaintance, had he neither been concern^
with her, or had done any difhonourable thing b]
her, he had natural Courage to have look'd thl
Devil in the Face, and boldly have ask'd what h
Jinefs fhe could have with him.
I H A V E read of a Story of a very religious La
dy, who the Devil^ it feems, had fome particuli
Picque at, and fet all his Stratagems at work ti
ruin her, both Soul and Body. He attack'd her in
hundred feveral ways in Covert, as I may call it
tha
of APPARI7 10 NS. ipj
that is to fay by Attempts to draw her into Crime, .
alluring her, and laying Snares for her of feveral
kinds. But when he found Ijimfelf fteadily refifted
by the Lady's refolv*d Virtue, Modefty and Tem-
perance, he attack'd her in Perfon with frightful
Apparitions, afluming ugly and terrible Shapes; and
once appearing all in Fire, y/ith a frightful threat-
ning Voice, he told her he was come to fetch her
away : The Lady had a fecret Spirit of Courage and
Refolution came upon her at the very Moment,
and, as we fay in other cafes, brisking up to him
as if fhe would fight him > Reiift the Devil^ fays
^e^ and he fhall flee from us! come /or me! added
fhe^ I'll venture that ! for I am fure thou lieft, Sa-
an^ thou haft nothing to do with me.
The Devil c^W^ her Whore, and told her fhe
I
ov'd fuch a Man, who was a marry'd Man, and
jiherefore ihe had intentionally committed Whore-
'iom with him, and fhould be damn'd.
N. B. It feems the Lady had lov'd that Gentleman
before he "was otherwife enga^d^ by marrying j
but had never had any Thought towards him^
or the leaf Acquaintance with him^ afterwards.
Thou fhoweft thyfelf, fays Jhe^ to be full of
Subtilty, a real Devil^ and even Malice itfelf : it is
true, I did love that Gentleman, fays Jhe^ and thou
fettedft him to work to perfuade me that he lov'd
me, and to court me with honourable Pretenfions,
and fo far gain'd upon me, that I really loved him >
but
Here he interrupted her, and told her. Such a
time, fays the Devil^ you wirti'd you were a-bed
with him, and you are as guilty by wiping to Sin,
as if you had done it.
I
Thou art the Father of Lies, Sata^, f<^y^ jhe^
and the Father of Lyars, and thou lieft in thisj nay,
thou lieft like a Devil^ that is malicioufly, for thou
iknoweft that it is not true.
O i You
x^6 The Hiftory and ReaUtj
You will be damn'd, fays he, and I will tak(
you away this minute.
Thou canft not take me away without God';
Permiflion, fays Jhe^ and he will not give me into th]
Hands 5 therefore touch rrie at this Peril: and wit!
that ihe fell down on her Knees, and cry'd. Lord
prefewe me from the evil Spirit : with which th(
Devil left her, and walk'd off.
These are Apparitions that may be call'd Ap-
paritions of Devils indeed, and by his Works yoi
may know him, for this is ading like himfelfj bu
where there is no Guilt we need not be afraid o
the Devil^ in whatever Shape or frightful Figur
he thinks to attack us in.
This Lady had never been able to reproacl
Satan with Lying, if what he faid had been true
but fhe knew herfelf innocentjand that put Courag
into her Soul, that fhe indeed Bully'd the Devii
defy'd him, and bad him do his worft.
I T feems the Devil rumag'd hard to find
Crime out to charge this Lady with, and came u
to her very clofe5 but he was put to his fhifts fo
Evidence 5 for even in colledbing all the A6bions o
her Life, he could not find any thing of real Gui
to load her with.
He attack'd her after this in feveral Shapes, am
one time he told her ihe wou'd be damn'd for
Hypocrite > for, fays he, for all your pretende
Sandity you was in a violent Paflion at fuch
time, and you curfl your Coufin -naming he
Name to her.
She anfwer'd, as before, boldly 5 And Satan, fay)
fhe^ tho' you are a Devil, and cannot be afham'd, ye
you are too cunnmg and too knowing to a6b like
a Fool J 1 was angrv, but in no Pafliouj and formj

ne, fo thou haft been the Occafion both of her
MP, and of my Anger.
But you curs'd her, and wifh'd the Devil (mean-
ng me, fays he) might take her.
That's like thee again, Devil^ fays the Lady 5
1
/as far from wiihing thou fhouldft take her, I am not
D much thy Friend to wifh thou fliouldft be gra-
ified in any one's Ruin. But I told her, indeed,
{he did fuch things, thou wouldft take her a-
/ay.
But you ly'd in that, fays he^ for I won't hurt
er.
I AM forry, fays fie^ thou art fo much her
riend.
S H E is mine already, adds the DeviIj I fhall not
:o her any harm.
\ Very well, Devilj fays fie-, then I hope I am
uc of your Lift, or why elfe are you raging at
le ?
Yes, yes, fays he, you fhall be mine quickly, as
;ell as fhe.
I DEFY thee, fays floe again^ and I'll tell the poor
}irl what you fay of her. I hope ihe will get out
f your Hands again.
Then I'll break her Neck that Minute, fays
'6.
That's not in your Power, fays the Lady.
Well, bur, fays he, you play'd at Cards on
hmday Morning laft.
She was a little furpriz'd at the Charge, and
top'd a-whilcj but recovering her Courage, 'Tis
irange. Devil, fays fhe, thou canft bring nothing
>ut Lyes againftmej why 1 have Faults enough,
hat are real Faults, and true, and that I could not
leny. Why I think Satan's turn'd Fool, adds fhe,
s if fhe jeer'd him. Why don't you fall upon me
n thofe Things I am guilty of? and not mal^e Lyes
O 5 for
ip8 The Htflory and Reality
for tfie fake of lying ? I did play at Cards a Sa-
turday Night, but not a Sunday Morning.
But, faid he, you play'd at Cards againft youi
Confcience too, when you believ'd it was a Sin tc
play, and you will be damn'd for that.
Why truly, Devil^ fays Jhe^ you go ncarefl
the Truth in this of any thing you have faid;
for after our Minifter's talking againft: Play, on(
Evening, he fo far perfuaded me that it was noi
lawful, that I did refolve to leave it off.
BtJT you broke your Word, and play'd again
and did it, I tell you, againft: your Confcience.
I D i D not tie myfelf by any Promife, but I die
queftion a little, indeed, whether I fliould play a^
ny more or no.
Yes, and did it againft your Confcience, I tel
you, and you ftiall be damn'd for that.
Here the Lady could not refrain Tears j bu
flill fhe anfwer'd the Devil boldly : As thou art
Lyar, Satan, I hope I (hall not, becaufe thou fayef
I fhall. However, thou fhalt never have it to up-
braid me with again j for tho' I did not pro*
mife to Man, I now promife it to the Devil^
will never play more.
It's too late now^ fays be^ and threatned hei
again.
N o, Satan^ fays Jhe, never too late for any one
to Repent, hut TChee-y and thou fhalt never Repent,
or be Forgiven.
With this, fays my Story, the Devil left her;
I have taken this, by Abridgement, from a verj
large Account of the feveral Difputes this coura^
geous Lady had with the Devil for fome Years
which if I could afTert the Particulars fo as to
fure of the Truth of every Part, and of my owH
Knowledge too, I ftiould make farther ufe of here j
but thus far they jire to the prefent Occafiortj
namely,
I. That
ef AP PARITIO NS, ipj^
1. That where the Devil appears, he always
iocs it like a Devil^ for fome wicked Purpofc or
)ther.
2. Where he cannot prevail and excite to do
Vlifchief, he aflaults with Rage, and threatens
ivith fuffering Mifchief.
The good Spirits or good Angels are quite of
mother Kind j and as they come, or are fent from
)ther Hands, fo they come of other Errands and
n another manner, as I ihall give a more parti-
:ular Account of prefently.
But let us from hence enquire into an Opini-
Dn which I have met with, and that of fome Men
3f Learning and Judgment, viz. That take the
/apparitions in general, whether of good or bad
Spirits, they never, or very rarely, do any harm.
As for the good Spirits, we know, as above, they
will do none} and if the bad do not, 'tis be»
caufe they can't.
The good Spirits, 'tis certain, will do no
harm} it is by their general appearing for good,
that we determine them to be good Spirits} and that
kind of Judgment is certainly very juft: but if
the evil Spirits, which do appear, do no harm
neither, it is becaufe they are under fome extraor-
dinary reftraint of Divine Power} fo that tho' they
may come about in the Air, they are not fuffer'd
to do any confiderable Mifchief in the World. In
both which cafes all the Occafion of our Terror
about them is taken away} for whether they are
good Spirits, or evil Spirits reftrain'd, 'tis much
the fame } one will do you no hurt, and the other
cannot} and there remains no room then for the
Pannick, which is fo much upon us, when we
hear of them.
It is true that Angels have fometimes been
fent in Judgment from Heaven, and have execu-
ted God's terrible Threatmngs upon Men in an
O 4 apparent
20
p
-The Hifiory and Reality
apparent Shape 5 as the Angel call'd the Dcflroy-
ing Angel, which David faw in the Air, with his
Sword drawn and ftretch'd over JerufaJem to de-
flroy it, I Chron. xxi. if. So the Angel of the Lord
that flew 1800CO of the Ajfyrians in one Night j
and it is not improbable that an Hod of Angels
or Apparitions appeared in the AJfyrian Camp, and
cut in Pieces the ^/^n^;? Army, with a Terror that
they were not able to refill.
These are extraordinary and miraculous Cafes j
fo likewife is that when the Angel appeared to
Balaam with a flaming Sword, and told him that
if the Afs had not turn'd away from him, he (the
Angel) had flain him, Numb. xxii. 33. But we
are not now fpeaking of Angels fent out with
efpecial Comjniflions to execute God's Vengeance,
but of the Apparition of good Spirits or Angels
from the invifible World of Spirits, who frequent-
ly appear, and fometimes upon fmall and very tri^
fling Occafions, and who vifit People as well by
Night as by Day> this we call Walking, and Ap-
parition, and this is fuch as is the Subje6t of our
prefent Enquiry.
Of thefe it is that I fay, hov/ever they may
difturb us, and however terrified we are about
them, I hey very rarely do any harm.
I HAVE heard of an Apparition which came to
a Farmer in Surry^ and threatned him that he
would burn his Houfe and his Barn, and all his
Corn and Hay j what his Pretences were the Story
does not relate, or what the poor Farmer had done
to difoblige him 5 but the Man was, it feems,
in the utmofl Confternation, and expoflulated
with the Apparition a great while > but at laft he
pluck'd up his Spirits, and fpoke with a little more
Courage to it.
What art thou, fays he, that threatneft mc
thus without a caufe, and fayefl thou wilt ruin me,
notwith-
of APPARITIONS. zot
notwithftanding I never did thee any wrong? thou
ihouldft be the Devilry thy ufage of me, for good
Spirits never do any Injuftice.
To this the Devil anfvver'd in a long, and to
appearance, a threatning Speech, but in a Language
the poor Man did not underftand one Word of.
J KNOW not what thou fayeft, fays the Farmer^
but I tell thee again thou feem'fl: to me to be the
Devil^ or one of his Angels, and I fuppofe thofe
are Words underftood in the bottomlefs Pitj but
threaten me no more with thy Rage, and with
burning my Houfe and Corn 5 thou art a greatDra-
gon indeed, but thou art chained, and canft do no-
'
thing but what thou art permitted to do by thy
Maker, and I fear thee not. Upon which the poor
Man pray'd Mentally that he might be deliver'd
from the Power of the Devil, and away run the
Spe6l:re, and did him no harm.
This was certainly a commendable Courage,
and had fomething of the Chriftian in it too j and
fuch a Courage, and upon the like Foundation,
would, for ought I know, lay all the Devils that
ever walk'd, and drive away all the Apparitions
and Spirits that People are fo terribly haunted with,
and fo terrify'd about.
CHAP. XI.
Of Apparitions in T)ream, and how far they
are or are not real Apparitions,
THERE may be Dreams without Apparition,
as there may be Apparitions without Dreams j
but Apparition in Dream may be as really an
Apparition as if the Perfon who faw it was awake:
The difference may be here, that the Apparition
in
xot *The Hiflory and ReaUty
in a Dream is vifible to the Soul only, for the
Soul never fleeps j and an Apparition to the Eye-
fight is vifible in common Perfpe6live.
How is it then that we fee in our Dreams the
very Faces and Drefs of the Perfon we dream of5
nay, hear their Voices, and receive due ImprefSons
from what they fay, and oftentimes fpeak to them
with our own Voices articulately and audibly, tho'
we are fall afleep ? What fecret Power of the Imagi-
nation is able to reprefent the Image of any Per-
fon to itfelf, if there was not fome Appearance,
fomething plac'd in the Soul's view, by a fecret,
but invifiblc Hand, and in an imperceptible man-
ner? which Something is in all Refpefts, and to all
Purpofes, as compleatly an Apparition, as if it was
plac'd in open fight when the Perfon was awake.
The Scripture confirms this Opinion by many
Expreffions direftly to the purpofe, and particu-
larly this of Appearing, or Apparition in Dream,
Gen. XX. 3. God came to Abimelech i;^ a Dream*,
had it been faid that Ahimelech dream'd that God
came to him, there might have been fome excep-
tion to the Parallel j but God a6tually came to him
:
and what tho'.^/^/;»^/^J^ was afleep, and in a Dream,
it was not the lefs an Apparition, for God came
to him, and fpoke, and faid to him: and in the 4th
Vcrfe Ahimelech fpoke to the Apparition. What-
ever the Shape was, that the Text does not men-
tion 5 but Ahimelech knew who he talk'd with too,
that's evident, for the Text mentions it fully,
And he faid. Lord, 'wilt thou flay alfo a righteous,
Nation ? and fo he goes on, Verfe the fifth, to
expoftulate and plead for himfelf and his People,
jfaid he not unto me^ flje is my Sifler? fo that he'
knew he was fpeaking to the Lord. The Text is
very remarkable, it is plain that there was an Ap-?
parition, hue the Man was afleep and in a Dream.
Agajn
of APPARITIONS, 205
Again in the cafe o{ Laban purfuing Jacoh^
Gen. xxxi. 24. God came to Laban the Syrian in a
Dream by Nighty and[aid unto him. Here again is an
Apparition, and a fpeaking Apparition too 5 God
came to him, and God fpoke to him 5 and Laban
owns, not that he dream'd of God's appearing,
but that God really fpoke to him, 'u. 19. the God,
of your Father fpake to me Tefter-night^ Joying-
Certainly Dreams in thofe Days were ano- <
ther kind of thing than they are now. God fpoke
to them, and they anfwer'd 5 and when they were
awake tjficy knew that it was God that fpoke, and
gave heed to the Vifion or Apparition of God to
them.
There are many more Inftanccs of the like in
the facrcd Hiftory^ as firft in the remarkable cafe
of King Solomon^ i Kings iii. f. 'The Lord appeared
to Solomon in a Dream by Nighty and God faid^
ask what IJhall give thee.
This is call'd in the Scripture a Dream, v, if.
and Solomon awoke^ and behold it was a Dream > and
yet it is all confirmed 5 and the Petition that So^
lomon made, tho' in his Sleep, or Dream, is ac-
cepted and anfwer'd as his real A£t and Deed, as
if he had been awake. A good hint, by the way^
that we may both pleafe and offend in our Dreams,
as really as if we were awake 5 but that is a hint,
I fay, by itfelf.
That PafTagc of Solomon is very remarkable to
the cafe in hand. If my Readers pleafe to believe
that there was fuch a Man as Solomon^ and that he
had fuch a Dream > they muft allow alfo that it
was a real Apparition, God appeared to him in a
Dream.
To bring it down a flep lower: as God has thus
Perfonally appeared to Men in Dreams, fo have
inferior Spirits, and we have Examples of this too
in the Scripture. Matt, \. 20. While he thought on
thefe
204 ^^^ Hifiory and Reality
ihefe Things^ behold the Angel of the Lord appeared
unto him in a Dream: and again, Matt, ii. 13.
Behold the Angel of the Lord appeared unto Jofeph in
a Dream^ f'^y'^^g'-
^^^ ^ third time 'tis repeated, the
Angel came again to him in jEgypt^ v. ip. of
the fame Chapter J when Herod was dead, Behold
an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a Dream to Jofeph
in iEgypt.
I w I L L for once fuppofe, that no Man need de-
iirc any farther Evidence than thefe for the Reality
of the thing it felf > we may bring it down from
hence by juft Parallels to Matters within our own
Reach, Experience will furniih us with particular
PafTages fufficient j and fome Account I fhall give you
within the Corapafs of our own Times > in which if I
doasmuch aspoffible, as I have done all along, omit
all thofe Accounts which others have publifh'd, re-
fering you to thofe Publications for the particulars,
and only give you new and more modern Accounts,
fuch as come within the Verge of my own Know-

Reafon to give Credit to 5 1 believe the Variety
will be as acceptable, and much more ufeful than a

But before I come to Quotation, or to Col-
lection of Story, 'tis needful to obferve here alfo,
that as it has pleas'd God to appear in this Man-
ner, and to caufe Angels to appear alfo in the fame
Manner, and upon fpecial Occafions, fo I make no
Queflion but the Devil often appears in Dreams
too •, and I might give but too many Examples of
it, as particularly one in the Scripture.
I T is apparent that God gave Satan a kind of
general Liccnfe to atHi£b Job^ only not to kill him ;
with fuch a ternble Commillion it might be ex-

pefted the De'vil would fall upon him with the ut*
mofl Fury he was capable of, or at leaft that he was
allow'd to take 5 he ruin'd his Fortunes, reduced
him to Mifery, murther'd his Children, tormented
him with Boils and Sores j in fhort, left him no-
thing but Potfherds, and an ill Wife to relieve him j
and as he had worry'd him, to ufe a modern Phrafe,
within an Inch of his Life^ he foliowM him in the
Night with Apparition, left he ihould recruit Na-
ture with Reft, and be a little refrefh'd with Sleep.
Job himfelf complains of it, Job vii. 14. I'houfearefi
me with D r e a m s, andterrifleft me with Visions.
Not that God appear'd to Job in any frightful or
terrible Form 5 but the Devil^ to whom God was
pleas'd to give a Liberty of afflifting Job^ took that
Liberty, and exerted his Malice to the utmoft in
fuch a Manner. We are not indeed told whac
Methods the Devil took to fcare and terrifie that
poor diftrefs'd Sufferer 5 but as he can fhow us no-
thing uglier, and more frightful than himfelf, fo
it is very likely he appear'd to him in Pcrfon,
and that in the moft furprizing Manner pollible,
with all the Circumftances of Horror that he was
able.
'Tis thought by fome, who critically note that
Part of the Text where Pilate's Wife warn'd her
Husband to have nothing to do in condemning
Chrift to be crucified, that it was the Devil thac
ilirr'd her up to oppofe it. Satan^ as foon as he
perceiv'd that the Death of Chrift, however inten-
ded for Mifchief by the Jews^ and purfued violently
by them in their Rage and Malice at our Lord per-
fonally, was yet a thing appointed by the determi-
nate Council of God, for the Salvation of Man-
kind : I fay, as foon as he perceiv'd that Part,
which 'tis probable he did not know before, heftrove
all he could to prevent it 5 and as fierce as he had
been to irritate the Jews before, and raife their

others by attacking P/7^/^'s Wife in the Night, an^

Whether it was fo or not, 'tis very probable
the many things fhe fufFer'd muft be from the
Devil 'y
becaufe Heaven, by whofe determinate
Council and Fore-knowledge the Death of Chrif
was appointed, would have done nothing to have
prevented or interrupted his own Appointment.
Now as the Dreams in thofe Days, and our
Dreams at this Time, are exceeding different > anc
that as our Heads are fo full of impertinent
Thoughts in the Day, which in proportion crowc
the Imagination at Night, fo our Dreams are tri-
fling and foolifli : How fhall we do to know when
they are to be taken Notice of, and when not?
When there is a real Apparition haunting us, or
ihowing it felf, to us and when not ? in a word,
when an Angel, or when a Devil^ appears to us in a
Dream ?
I T is a nice Queftion, and as it docs not parti-
cularly relate to the prefent Enquiry, fo it wouk
require too long a Digreffion to difcourfe Critically
upon it •, but I (hall difmifs it with this fhort An-
fwer. We muft judge, as 1 faid before in the Cafe of
open Apparitions, by the Weight, and by the Na-
ture of the MefTage or Errand which the Appari-
on comes about j evil Meflengers feldom come o
good Errands, and Angels good or bad feldom come
on trifling MefTages.
Trifling

Trifling Dreams are the Produd of the
Mind being engag'd in trifling Matters > a Child
dreams of its Play, a Houfe-wife dreams of her
Kitchen, a Nurfe of the Children, a Tradefman of
his Shop } thefe have nothing of Apparition in
them 5 nothing of Angels or Spirts, God or Devils
but when Dream comes up to Vifion, and the Soul
is embark'd in a fuperior Degree, to a Commerce
above the ordinary Rate, then you may conclude
you have had fome extraordinary Vifitors, that you
have been in fome good or bad Company in the
Night, and you are left to judge of what kind, by
the Subftance or Tcnour of the Vifion. If it be to
open the Underftanding, to encreafe Knowledge,
to feal Inftru6tion> hi a word, if it is for dire6bion
to good Adions, or ftirring up the Soul of Man to
perform his Duty to God or Man, 'tis certainly
from above J 'tis an Apparition from God, 'tis a
Vifion of Angels and good Spirits. Job xxxiii. if.
In a Dream^ in a Vifion of the Nighty when deep Sleep

'tis an Apparition of the Devil^ and he employs his
Agents, and perhaps attends in Perfon to draw you
into Mifchief.
A^. ^. Here 'tis worth a wife Man's confider-
ing, whether the Devil reprefenting a Temp-
tation to any Perfon in a Dream, and the Per-
fon complying, he is not guilty of the Fa6fc
as really as if he had been awake. J leave ic
only as a Head of Refledion : For Example,
The Devil^ fubtle in his Contrivance, as well as
vigilant in Application of Circumftances, knows a
Man to be in perplex'd Circumftances, diftrefs'd for

Come, come, take it up quickly, it may fave yoi

difappointed of the Prize which he wanted, and
fancy'd himfelf reliev'd by. 2. That the Devil
Triumphs over him, and he is both deluded into»
the Crime, and deceived in the Expedation of itsi
Reward.
I COULD give this in the Form of a Relationi
of Fad, and give Evidence of the Truth of it 3 for
1 had the Account of it from the Perfon's owni
Lips, who was attacked in Sleep, and (as he faidl
with a fincere Afflidion) yielded to the Temptation j,
and 1 committed the barbarous Robbery, y^/i hsy,

the poor fmiling Infant, who innocently play'd

the Purfe of Gold out of its little Pocket, and bid
rae keep it for her to play with. I robb'd it, fays
he^ in my Imagination, and deferve as much to be
hang'd for it, as if I had aftually committed the
horrid Fa£t at Noon-day 5 Ay, fays he^ with a kind
of Tremor in his Confcience from the Horror of
the Fad, I ought to be hang'd for it, and to be
damn'd for it too, for I as really and effeftually did
it as if I had been apprehended and carry'd to
Newgate for it.
I T is true, it gave him a particular Satisfaftion^
with refpeftto his Perfonal Safety, that he had not
committed the Fa£t j but it gave him no lefs Trouble in
his Confcience, than if he had been a6lually guilty.
What was this but an Apparition of the Devily
|<a real vifible Apparition! vifible to the Mind, tho*
not to the Body? and that in a double Capacity tooj
the Devil without in the Temptation, and the Devil
I within yielding to it.
\
I KNOW another living Example of this kind,
Iand
I had that Part too from the Perfon himfelf
:
He was a fober religious Gentleman 5 he was in the
letter of it a fingle Man j for tho' he had been unhap-
I pily married, he liv'd in a feparate State from his
I
Wife J and, to fay no more of it, upon a juftifiable
'
Occafion, namely, that his Wife was wickedly
gone away, as he fuppos'd, with another Man.
Before he was marry'd to the unhappy Wo^
man, he had lov'd a very handfom beautiful Lady,
and had gone fo far as to court her a long time for
Marriage j but fome Difficulty in their Circumftan-
ces prevented their coming together, and he took
another J which the firft Lady refented fo, as that it
coft her too dear, for fhe died foon after.
The AfHiftion of this was very heavy to him,
P after
lit) "The Hijio^^ md Reiilky
after he found himfelf abus'dinjbis real Marriage, tis
above. I fay after, for at firft it feetns it was not.
Under the melanchbly Reflexions of thefe contrary
Circumftances, which frequently loaded his Mind,
He dreams one Night, that his former Miiftrefs came
to himWithafmilingCototenancej I might have ex-
prefs'd it rather, that his former Miftrefs afpem'^d to
him in a Dream^ and \^ith a fmiling chearful Coun-
tenance, told him, that his Run-away Wife was
Dead, and now you are mine, fays the Apparitioh.
He feceiv'd the News with a particular Satisfa6tion,
^hd embrac'd the Lady, as his former Inclinations
diftated to him> he had not the leafl: Notion, as he
protefted folemnly, or the leaft Remembrance that
flie was dead.
When he awak'd, and found it all a Dreamy
he was exceedingly afflicted with the Surprife^
looking upon himfelf to be as really Guilty, as if he
had been awake, and the Lady alivej and I can^
not but fay he had fome Reafon.
Whether this, if really Tnie, could be any
thing but an Apparition of an evil Spirit 5 the Dt--
vii laying a Snare for him, and prevailing with him
in Dream in a manner, and to commit a Grime, \^hich
he could not prevail with him to be guilty of whdii
Ihe was alive.
I cotTLD give an Account of andthcr Peifon^
'whom the Devil haunted frequently, and that for
^any Years together, with lewd Apparit^ions j temp^
ting him in his Sleep with the Company of beau*
tiful Women, fomecimes naked, fometimes even in
Bed with him j and at other times in Convdrfation
t)rompting him to Wickednefs, and that fometitoesi
he was prevail'd upon to confent 5 but always hap*
pily prevented by walking in time : But the Cafe
^
has on two or three Oceafions been mentioned by
other Hands, and the Perfon is too much known
to allow the farther Defcription of it, without his
Confent. I|
of AP P ARITI NS. in
I c A N N o T doubt but thefc things are flated
formal Apparitions of the Devils and tho' the Per-
fonmay be afleep, andiiot thoroughly fcnfible either
of what he is doing, or of what is doing with hiin,
yet that the evil Spirit isaftually prefent with him in
Apparition, I think will not ad-mit of any Que-
ilion.
The Warld is too full of Examples of this
iind, to enter into a long Accou-nc of the Parti-
culars. There is hardly a Book upon the Subject
^ut is filled up with hiftorical Relations 5 hardly a
jPerfon to be convers'd with ojpon the Sut^e<5l, but
is full of them, either for themfelves or fome of
their Acquaintance > and every one is ^-endering
their Dreams to be considerable, and all to comk:
to pafs: But out of £lvq hundred Dreams fo told,
and which fo much Strefs is feemingly laid on,
'tis hard to find xmQ that we qan call a real Ap-
parition in Dream.
'
The great, and perhaps one of the grcat-
cft Difficulties of Life, I mean that relates to
Dreams, is to diftinguifh between fuch as -are real
iApparitions, and fuch as are only the Frodu6b of
an incumbered Brain, a diftemper'd Head, or which
is worfe, a diltemper'd Mind : But fome 'Dreams
are fo fignificant, and there follows fuch an imme-
diate vifible EfFe6t anUvering the defign'd Illumi-
juation, that it cannot but be fignificant.
A CERTAIN Gentleman who had lately buried
Ais Wife, a Lady of great Piety and Virtue, was
ib exceedingly affli6tecl at his Lo{s, that among o-
,ther melancholy things which were the Effect of
it, this was one 5 that he v/as fo far from defiring
to marry agam, that he entertained a -fettled ri-
veted Avcrfion to the whole Sex, and was never
thoroughly eafie in their Company j and thus he
liv'd near two Years,
P z After
ziz The Hijiory a^d Reality
A F T E R a certain time his Wife appeared to him
in his Dream, or he dream'd that he faw his Wifcj
but I rather put it in the firfl Senfe : She came
to him, as he thought, to the Bedfide, with a fmi-
ling and pleafant Countenance, and calling him by
the Term which fhe always gave him. My Deareft,
H E was in a great Confternation, but could not
fpeak to her J but (he faid, Do not be afraid of me,
I will do you no Hurtj and then faid. What is
the Reafon that you mourn thus for me ?
He ftill faid nothings that is to fay, he dream'd
'
that he faid nothing, but that he fetch'd a deep
Sigh.
Come, comz^faysjhe^ Friends loft arc Friends
loft, and cannot be recalled.
Then he fpokc, that is dream'd that he fpoke^
and ask'd her, why ihe appeared to him.
SHEfaidy to put an End to his unreafonable
Grief.
How can that be ? fays he^ You now encreafe my
Grief, by bringing your felf thus to my Remem-
brance.
N o, no, fays Jhe^ you muft forget me, and pray
take another Wife, which will be the way to
caufe you to forget me effcftually.
N o, no, faid he, that I can never do 5 and how
can you defire it of me ?
Yes, faysjhe^ I do defire it of you, and I come
to dirc6t you whom you Ihall have.
H E defir'd ftic would talk no more to him 5 for,
fays he, you cannot be my Wife j it muft be
fome evil Spirit comc^to tempt me in fuch a Shape,
and to deftroy me.
With that flic feem'd to weep, and to pity
him.
H E figh'd again, and defir'd that if flic was able
to retain any Afteition to him in the Condition flie
of APPARITIO NS. 213
was then in, that fhe would ihow it by coming no
more to diforder him in that manner.
SHE faid^ Well, I will trouble you no more, if
you liflen to the Diredtions I fliall now give you,
and will perform them.
What are they ? fays he.
On the firft Wednefday in OUoheri fays Jhe^ you
will be invited to Dinner to fuch a Houfe, there
you will fee a Gentlewoman drefs'd in white fic
over-againfl: you at the Table j fhe ihall be your
Wife, and fhe will be a kind Mother to my Children.
I T feems fhe gave other Particulars of the Gen-
tlewoman's DreS, and in particular that fhe would
drink to him 5 all which came to pafs accordingly.
After fhe had faid this, fhe difppeared > the
Story does not fay fhe went away with a melodious
Sound, or with rich Perfumes, or the like, as is pre-
tended often in fuch like Cafes 5 nor do 1 remem-
ber to have heard that he married the Perfon, tho'
he really faw her at the Feafl.
But the Queflion from all this Story is only
this, 'viz. Whether, fuppofing the Cafe to be littc-
rally true, was this an Apparition, or was it on-
ly a fimple Dream ? I affirm it muft be an Appari-
tion, that is to fay, a Spirit came to him in the
Perfon of, or perfonating his Wife.
The following Story I had from the Mouth of
the very Perfon who was chiefly concerned in it, I
mean the Captain of the Ship itfelf.
One Captain Thomas Rogers^ Commander of a
Ship called the Society^ was bound on a Voyage
from London to Virginia about the Year 169\.
The Ship was hired in London^ and being fent
light, as they call it, to Virginia for a Loading of
Tobacco, had not many Goods in her outward bound,
fuppofe about two or three a hundred Ton, which
was not counted a Loading, or indeed half her
P 2 Load^
'ti4 7/&<? tiiftory and Reality
Loading 5 the Ship being very large, above five
hundred Ton Burthen.
They had had a pretty good Parage, and the
Day before had had an Obfervation, whereupon
the Mates and proper Officers had brought their
Books and cafl up their Reckonings with the Cap-
tain, to fee how near they were to the Coafts of
America 5 they all agreed that they were at leaft about
an hundred Leagues Diftance from the Capes of Vir^
^m^.Upon thcfe curtomary Reckonings, and with-
all heaving the Lead, and finding no Ground at
an hundred Fathom, they fet the Watch, and the
Captain turn'd in (as they call k at Sea) that is,
went to Bed.
The Weather was good, a moderate Gale of
Wind, and blowing fair for the Coaft, fo that the
Ship might have run about twelve or fifteen Leagues
in the Night after the Captain was in his Cab*
bin.
H E fell afleep, and flept very foundly for about
three Hours, when he waked again, and lay 'till
he heard his fecond Mate turn out^ and relieve the
Watch j and then he call'd his chief Mate as he
was going off from the Watch, and ask'd hiitt
how ail things far'dj who anfwer'd, that all wa^
well, and the Gale frefhen'd, and they run at t
great Rate> but 'twas a fair Wind and a fine clear
Night 5 fo the Captain went to ficep again.
About an Hour after he had been afleep again^
he dream'd that a Man pull'd him or wak'd him,
dnd he did wake. I am not fure, but I think he
faid the Thing that wak'd him bad him get up^
that is, turn out and look abroad. But whether it
was fo or no, he lay (till and compos'd himfelf to
ilcep, and drop'J again, and fuddenly awak'd again,
and thus feveral times 5 and tho' he knew nothing
what was the Reafon, yet he found it was impofli*
ble for him to go to fleep, and ftill he heard the
Vifion
of APPAR IT IONS. iij
Vifion fay, or thought he heard it fay, turn out and
look abroad,
H? lay in this Une^finefs near two Hours, but
at laft it encreas'd fo upon him, that he could lie
no longer, but gets up, puts on his Watch Gown,
and comes out upon the Quarter-deck j there he
found hisfecond Mate walking about, and theBoat-
fwainupon the Forecaflle, the Night fine and clear,
a fair Wind, and all well as before.
The Mate wondering to fee him, at firft did
not know him i but calling, Who's there? the Cap-
tain anfwer'd, and the Mate returns, Who, the
Captain ! what's the matter, Sir ?
SATS the Captain^ I don't know, but I have
been very uneafie thefe two Hours, and fome body
or my own Fancy bid me turn out and look abroad,
tho' I know not what can be the meaning of it.
There can be nothing in it, but fome Dream,
fays the Mate,
SATS the Captain^ How does the Ship Cape?
South-West by South, fays the Mate j fair
for the Coaft, and the Wind Eaft by North.
T H A t's all very good, fays the Captain j and
fo, after fome other ufual Qiieftions, he turn'd about
to go back to his Cabin > .when, as if it had been
fome body that flood by him had fpoke, it came
into his Mind like a Voice, Heave the Lead^ heav9
the Lead.
Upon this he turns again to his fecond Mate,
Mate, fays the Captain^ when did you heave the
Lead? what Water had you?
About an Hour ago, fays the Mate^ fixty Fa-
thom.
Heave again, fays the Captain,
Thejie's no manner of Occafion, Siv^fays the
Mate^ but if you pleafe it fhall be done.
I don't know, fays the Captain,^ 'tis needlefs in-
deed, I think \ and fo was going away again,
P 4 but
The Hifiory dnd Reality
but was, as it were, forc'd to turn back as before,
and fays to the Mate, I know not what ails me,
but I can't be eafie 5 come call a Hand aft, and
heave the Lead.
Accordingly a Hand was called, and the
Lead being caft or heaved, as they call it, they
had Ground at eleven Fathom,
This furpriz'd them all, but much more when
at the next Caft it came up feven Fathom.
Upon this the Captain in a Fright bad them
put the Helm a Lee, and about Ship, all Hands being
order'd to back the Sails, as is ufual in fuch Cafes.
The proper Orders being obeyed, the Ship
ftay'd prefently and came about j and when fbe was
about, before the Sails fiU'd, ihe had but four Fa-
thoms and a half Water under her Stern 5 as foon as
fhe filled and flood off, they had feven Fathom again,
and at the next Caft eleven Fathom, and fo on to
twenty Fathom 5 fo he ftood off to Seaward all the
reftof the Watch, to get into deep Water, 'till Day-
break J when being a clear Morning, there were
the Capes of Virginia and all the Coaft of America,
in fair View under their Stern, and but a very
few Leagues Diftance ; Had they ftood on but
one Cable's length farther, as they were going,
they had been Bump a-jhore (fo the Sailors call it)
and had certainly loft their Ship, if not their
Lives.
Now, what could this be? Not the Devil^ that
we may vouch for him, he would hardly be guil-
ty of doing fo much good 5 hardly an Angel fent
from Heaven Exprefs, that we dare not prefumej
but that it was the Work of a waking Providence, by
fome invifible Agent employ'd for that Occafion,
who took Sleep from the Captain's Eyes > as once
in a Cafe of infinitely more Importance was done
to King Ahafuerus-y This we may conclude. Had
%\i^ Captain il^pt as ufual, and as Nature requir'd,
they
of APPARITIONS. 7.17
they had been all loft 5 the Shore being flat at a
great Diftance, and, as 1 fuppofe, the Tide low, the
Ship had been a-ground in an Inftant, and the Sea,
which run high, would have broke over her, and
foon have dafh'd her in Pieces.
How it happen'd that the Mates and other
Navigators on Board (for it being a very great
Ship, they had fcveral experienc'd Men among them)
(hould all of them have kept, and yet all be out in
their Reckoning, and that fo much as to think them-
felves an hundred Leagues from the Coaft, when
they were not above twenty or twenty five, that
was to be accounted for among themfelves j but cer-
tain it was, if it had not been for thus being
wak'd and jogg'd in the Night, and kept awake
too in fpite of his own Drowfinefs, the Captain
had lain ftill, and the whole Ship's Company been
in the utmoft Hazard.
I F this was not an Apparition, it muft be what
the Scripture calls it in another Cafe, being warned
of God in a Dr$am j which by the way is the fame
thing > but here was fomething more than being
warned, for the Captain own'd he ivas in no Dream.
He dream'd nothing at all, much lefs any thing
of Danger 5 he went to his Bed or Cabbin with
all the prudent Caution that any Man in that im-
portant Truft of a Ship in the Ocean could do ;
and then after having made their Calculations, caft up
their Reckonings, fet their Watch, and made every
thing fure, he laid down with all the Satisfa6tion
that it was poffible for any Man in a like Cafe to
have.
T o any Men that underftand the Sea AfFairs,
this Cafe will be more feelingly and fenfibly read;
they will be more touch'd with the Surprize
the Ship's Company muft be all in, to fee them-
felves juft running a-ground, when they believed
themfelves an hundred Leagues from the Shore, to

The Hifiory and Reality
find thcmfelves within two Inches of Death, when
they believed themfelves as fafe ai a Ship at Sea
^ith a moderate Gale and a fair Wind could be
iuppofed to be.
And how will thofe modern Wits, of which our
Age is fo full, account for this, who allow no God
or Providence, no invifible World, no Angelick,
kind and waking Spirits, who, by a fecret Corre-
fpondence with our embodied Spirits, give merci-
ful Hints to us of approaching Mifchiefs and im-
pending Dangers, and that timely, fo as to put the
Means into our Hands to avoid and efcape them ?
Which wa,y will fuch Men folve the main
Difficulty in fuch a Cafe as this, viz. What this
fhould be? Will they refolve it all into fortuitous
Chance, meer Accident, ameer Circulation of things
in the ordinary Courfc ? As they fay Shoals are raifed
to bar up a Haven, which they tell us, is nothing but
theSand and Stones driven down the Streamof a Ri-
ver, which lodge here or there, as their own Weight,
or the abating Force of the Water, or this or that
Eddy and Countcr-llream checks them, fo deep'ning
one Channel where it was Shoal, and choaking up
another where it was deep, and all by meer Acci-
dent: But this is very grofs arguing.
I T were eafie to confute thefe weak pretences
to Chance and Incident, and to {how the neceffity
of an intelligent Being 5 but that is not my work :
I am not upon the Reality of fuch an intelligent Be-
ing, but the Reality of its ordinary and extraordina-
ry aftings, the Agents it employs, and the manner

Our
of APPARITION S. 2i5>
O tj R Friends the Criticks may Humble here,
perhaps5at the Teeming contradiflion in the Terms,
as particularly this of invifible Apparition. Buc
*ds eafily folv'd, by anfwering that it is but a feem-
ing Contradi6lion5 for both the Apparitions are vi-
fible, only not to the fame Optick Powers 5 the Ap-
parition in Dream is vifible to the intelle6i:ual fight,
to the Eye of the Soul 5 and the Day-light Appari-
tion is vifible to the common ordinary fight : and
you have an Expreflion in the Scripture often made
ufe of, which gives an unqucftion'd Authority for
this way of fpeaking.
'
The expreffing things dream'd of, as things
ieen, is very frequent in the Sacred Text. Jacob
dream'd a Dream about Laban's Cattle, Gen. xxxi.
to. where 'tis thus exprefled, and I faw in a
Dream. Again DanieL vii. i, 2,. Daniel had a Dream
and Vifions of his Head upon his Bed, v. 2.
and I [aw in my Vifion by Night : v. 7. after this I
faw in tbe Night Vifions^ and behold a fourth Beaft :
and V. I ^. Ifaw in the Night Vifions^and behold -y and
befides this, we have the fame way of fpeaking ten
or eleven times in the fame Chapter, and as many
or more times in the next.
'Tis the like in relating the Dreams o^ Pharaoh
and of Nebuchadnezzar^ or the Apparitions rather
which appeared to thofe Kings in Dream. Pharaoh
fays to Jofeph^ Gen. xli. 17, 18, 19. In my Dream
Iflood upon the Bank of the River^ and Behold
there came up-y that is the fame thing as, 1 faw them
come up: v. 19. and Behold feven other Kine
came up.^ or .J faw feven other Kine come up. So
that an Apparition in Dream is vifible to the Soul,
the Imagination kts^ tho' the Eyes of the Body arc
clos'd.
This Digrefiion is owing to the nice Judgment
of our Criticks, whofe exa6fcnefs you fee I mightily
reverence, and am wonderful careful not to fall un-
der
2 20 The Hifiory and Reality
der their dreadful Hands, in a thing fo eOential to
my Subjeft 5 as for Trifles, I leave them to trifle with
them to the utmoft oftheir more maliciouslmpotence.
But I come now to another Relation of Fa6tj
which alfo I take upon me to vouch the Reality o^
having been prefenc at the very inftant of cverjij
part of it.
A Person, whofc Name it is not fo proper tew
mention here, but who may be produc'd if there
ihould be occafion, being ftill living, was under the
di^ifter, about the Year 1701, to fall under a Party
Cenfurc, (the occafion is needlefs to the prefent
Cafe.) In hopes, upon the Recefs of the Houfe, which
was not far off^, he fliould (as is ufual ) be at Liberty,*
he withdrew himfelf, and avoided being taken up as
much as he could 5 but the Houfe refenting it, a
Vote was paft, ordering the Secretary of State to
profecute him at Law j which oblig'd him to refolve
to leave the Kingdom, and in the mean time tO'
conceal himfelf with more exaftnefs j the Govern-
ment having iflued out a Proclamation for appre-
hending him, with a Reward to the Perfon who
fliould difcover where he was, fo as he might be
taken.
I N order to conceal himfelf more effeftually, he
left his Lodging where he had been hid for fome
time, and remov'd to Barnet on the Edge of Hert-
ford/hire y intending, as foon as he had fettled fome
Family Affairs, to go away North into Scotland
But before he went away he was oblig'd to come
once more to London^ to fign fome Writings for
the fecuring fome Eltatc, Which it was fear'd might
be feiz'd by Out-law, if the Profecutio*ii had gone
on fo far.
The Night before he had appointed to come to
JLondon^ as above^being in Bed with one Mr.i^^
D he dream'd that he was in his Lodgings ac
London^ where he had been concGal'd as above, and
iD
of APPARITIO NS. 2ZI
in his Dream he faw two Men come to the Door,
who faid they ^tvt Mejfengers^ and produc'd a War-
rant froni the Secretary of State to apprehend him,
and that accordingly they feiz'd upon and took
him.
The Vifion furpriz'd and wak'd him, and he
waked Mr. D his Brother-in-law, who was in
Bed with him, and told him the Dream, and what
a Surprize he was in about it. Mr. D feeing
i it was but a Dream, advis'd him to give no heed to
it, but compofe himfelf and go to lleep again, and
he did fo.
A s foon as he was faftafleep again, he was wak'd
again with the (ame Dream exaftly as before 5 and
he awak'd his Brother again, as before : It diflurb'd
them both very much 5 but being heavy to fleep,
they both went to fleep again,and dream'd no more.
It is to be obferv'd, that he faw the very Men that
apprehended him, their Countenances, Cloaths^
Weapons, l^c. and defcrib'd them in the Morning
to his faid Brother D — in all the Particulars.
However the Call to go to London being as
he thought urgent, he got ready in the Morning
to go, refolving to flay but one Day, and then fee
forward for Scotland. Accordingly he went for Lon-
don in the Morning, and that he might not be
known, walk'd it on Foot 5 that fo he might goby
more private ways over Enfidd Chafe^ and fo to
Southgate^ Hornfey^ £cc.
All the way as he walk'd his Mind was heavy,
and opprefs'd 5 and he frequently faid 10 his Bro-
ther who walk'd with him, that he was certain
he was going to London to be furpriz'd : and fo
ftrong was the foreboding Impreflion upon his Mind,
that he once flop'd at Hornfey^ and endeavoured to
get a Lodging, intending to fend his Brocher to
London to fee if nothing had happen'd there to give
him any Alarm,
As
21 z The Hiflory and Reality
As he had juft fccured a convenient Lodgings
he accidentally faw a Gentleman ftanding at tbr
next Door, who he knew very well, but durft v\o\
venturc to trufl: on that Occaiion j and finding or
Enquiry that he dwelt there, he concluded thai
was no Place for him, and fo refolv'd to go for-
wards.
The ImprefEon upon his Mind continuing, h«
ftop'd again at JJUngton^ and endeavoured to get
Lodging there j but could not : fo at laft, when hit
Brother brought him word he could not geti
Lodging, except where it was too publick, Well
fays he, than I muft go to London^ and lake wha
follows 5 or to that purpofej and accordingl?
did go, and the next Morning was taken bi
the MeiTengers, juft in the very manner as he hac
been told in his Dream > and the very fame twc
Men, whofe Faces he had fecn, and with thj
fame Gloaths on and Weapons, exadly as he hac
!defcrib'd.
'
This Story I had from his own Mouth, am
confirmed by Mr. R D* his Brother-in-law
to whom he related his Vilian at the very Momei
of it, as above.
I R E F E R it to any impartial Judgment X\
weigh every Gircumftance of this Account (tb
Truth of which 1 have not the leaft Reafon to que
flion) and to tell me, by what Powers, and froo
what Influence could thefe things be perform'd, i
there were no invifible World, and no Inhabitant
there, who concerned themfelves with our Affairs-^
no good Spirits which conversed with our embo*
died Spirits, and gave us due intelligence, .noticflj
and warning of approaching Danger.
If there is any Difficulty in this Gafe, it feemi*
to me to be in the Event of the thing, as in th(
Cafe mentioned : Why was not the lntelligenc<
made fo complcat, fo forcible, and the Impreffior
of AP P jiRITiO NS. 2J3
fo plain, that the Perfon in whofe Favour ic was all
done might have been effedually alarosi'd, his go»
ing forward flopr, and confequencly the Mifchicf
which was at hand, and which he had the notice
of, effedually prevented ?
It is not indeed fo eafy to atifwer that part ^
biit it may be refolv'd into thisjthac the Fault feems
ro be our own, that wc do not give due attention
to fuch notice, as might be fufficient to our Delive*-
. ranee. If an Enemy be at hand, ^wd the Out-Cen-
ttinel fires his Piece, he does his Duty 5 if the whole
[
Cam'p does not take the Alarm, but arc furpriz'd,
(the fault is their own, tfee Man did all that was to
be expe&ed from him j nor do the Officers or Ge^
fterals flight the notice, aixl (ay 'tis nothing but a
forry Fcliow fhoc off his Mufquet, and fo take no
4ilore heed to it.
O N the contrary, they conclude the •Centinel is
Ipofted upon Duty 5 he would not fire his Piece
fwithout a fufficient Catife, and give a falfe alarm to
the Camp for nothkigj there muil be fomething
extraordinary, and accordingly they order the
Drums to bear, and immediately call to Arms.
Thus if the invifible Spirits give a due alarcra^
they do their part > if they jog us and awaken us m
a deep fleep, and pull us again and again, and give
\is notice that fomething is coming, that fome Dan-
ger is at the Door > if we will fleep on 'till it
comes, if we will go on,happen what happen may?,
the kind Spirit has done its Duty, difcharg'd its
Office, and if we fall into the Mifchief, the fault
is our own, we can by no mtans blame the infuffi-
ciency of the Notice, and fay, to what purpofe is
it ? feeing we had due and timely warning, but
Would not take the hint 5 we had due notice of the
danger, and would not Itep out of the way to avoid
4t 5 the fault is wholly our own.
And-
2.2.4 7J&^ Hifiory and Reality
Another Account I had a fufficient Vouchci
for, tho' the Gentleman is now dead j but I hac
great reafon to believe the truth of it.
A YOUNG Gentleman of good Birth and For-
tune, in the beginning of the late War with France.
'
, had a violent inclination to fee the World, as h<
-
^'^
call'd it, and refolv'd to go into the Army j his Fa-
ther was dead, and had left him a good Eftate;
that is to fay, between four and five hundred Pound;
a Year 5 befides his Mother's Joynturd, which aftei
her Life would fall to him ofcourfe.
His Mother cafneflly entreated him not to g(
into the Army 5 but preft him rather to tra
vel^and fo might fee the World, as flic faid, withou
feeling the Calamities of the War, and \vithou;
hazarding his Life.
H E told her Travelling indeed in time of Peac<
was all a Gentleman could do, and was at bef
very expenfive 5 but that now was the time a Mar
^
might fee the World at the expence of the Pub-
lick,' and perhaps might make his Fortune too.
His Mother reprefented the danger of his Life,
and bad him confider how many Gentlemen weni
into the Army, and of them, have few liv'd to come
home again, much lefs to rife to any degree of Pre-
ferment.
He made light of all that, and told his Mothei
(as is the general Saying of warm Heads when thej
pufli their Fortunes, as they call it,) that if he hap-
pened to be knock'd on the Head there was an End
of him, and he was provided for.
Well, Son, fays the old Lady, I am oblig'd ta
fubmit to it, you are your own Mafter 5 but re-
member your Mother's Tears, (and with thofti
Words flie wept I can but entreat you not to go,"
you haveEftate enough to make you eafy j letthofe
go whofe narrow Circumftances make the hazard
rational) and let them go abroad to die, that
can't
of APPARITIONS. ttS
can't tell how to live ; you can pay thofe that do
go J you have no need to run the Rifque, who do
not want the Pay.
He flighted all her entreaties, and told her, if
his Father was alive he did not doubt but he would
give his Confenr, for he had done the fune thing
in his young Days.
No, no, Son, faidhis Mother, your Father knew
better 5 he took a Commiffion when he was the
youngcfl: of three Sons, and had nothing to expe6t
at home but the fate of a younger Brother j but as
foon as he heard that his Elder Brothers were both
dead, and the Eftate all come ft) him, he laid down
his Arms, fold his Commiffion, and faid he had no
more Bufinefs in the Army 5 and he would tell you
the fame thing if he was alive: he ufed always to
fay, that the Sword and the Book are the Portions
of younger Brothers, the Coach and the Equipage
is for the Heir.
Well, 'twas all one> whatever his Mother's
Arguments could do, or even fpeaking Tears cou'd
fay, nothing could prevail^ but he mortgag'd part
of his Eilate to purchafe a Company in the firfl
Regiment of Guards, and into the Army he would
go.
The Night before he fign'd the Agreement for
the Company, being in his Bed and fait afleep, he
faw in a Dream his Father come to him in his
Gown, and with a great Fur Cap on, fuch as he us'd
ito wear : And calling him by his Name, What is
the Reafon, fays he, that you will not liilen to thd
entreaties of your Mother not to go to the Wars;
but anfwer her that I v/ould not diiTuade you ? I
do affiire you, that if you refolve to take this Com-
miffion you will not enjoy it three Years.
W UY^ fays he (in his Dream) what will hinder
me? being it feems dcflrous to know fomething of
his Fortune.
^i6 The Hifiory and Reality
A s K me not the Particulars, fays the jipparition^
but either decline the Employ, or when you have
cnjoy'd it two Years and a half, fell out again, as I
did before you.
I can't promife th2iX.^fays he.
Then you may promife your felf, fays the Jp*
parition^ that it fhall be worfc.
H E feem'd to flight the Admonition, and faid,
it was too late to look back.
Too late ! too late ! fays the Jpparition^xt^t2iiiwg
the Wordsj then go on, and repent too late.
H E was not much affected with this Apparition,
when he wak'd and«found it was but a Dream j for
Dreams, faid he, are not to be heeded i fo he went
on and bought the Commiffion.
A F EW Days after the Commiffion was bought,^
the Father appeared again, not to him but to his
Mother, in a Dream too as before j and taking notice
to her, how his Son had rejefted her Admonition, it
added,
*' Young Heads are wilful : Robert will go in-
*^ to the Army j but tell him from me, he fhall
'* never come back.
All thefe Notices were of no force with this
young Gentleman j but as he had refolv'd, fo he
purfued his Rcfolution, and went into the Army 3
and two Battallions of that Regiment going into
the Field that Summer, his Company was one, and
fo he went abroad into Flanders. ^
H E wanted no occafion to fhow his Bravery, and
in feveral warm A6tions come off with applaufe
fo that he was far from being fufpcded of Cowardife
:
But one Day, and in the third Year of his Service,
the Army was drawn out in order of Battel, the
General having received certain Advice, that the E*
ncmy would come and attack them. As he flood at
the Head of his Company, he was fuddenly (eiz'd
with a cold Ihivering Fitj and it was fo violent
that
\
of AP PARlTIO NS. 117
that fomc Officers who were near him, every one
ac their Poft, pcrceiv'd it.
A s it was to no purpofe for him to conceal it,
he turn'd to his Lieutenant who ftood next to him,
and from whofe Mouth I received the particular
Account of it : I cannot imagine, fays he^ what is
the occafion of this fhaking Fit.
I T is your eagernels to fall on, fays the Lieute*
nant^ I have often been fo, and begin to be fo now j
I wifli the French would come on, that we might
have fomething to do.
I T continued about a quarter of an Hour, and
the Enemy did come on as was expe6led 5 but the
! fight began upon the left, a good diftance from
ithcm, fo that the whole left Wing was engag'd
I before they began.
> While this lafted, the Lieutenant call'd to the
Gentleman, Colonel, y^jj he^ how do you do ? I
hope your fliivering Fit is over.
No, fays the Colonel^ 'tis not over 5 but 'tis a lit-
c better.
I T will be all over prefently, fays the Lieutenant.
A Y, fo 'twill, fays the Colonel^ I am very eafy, I
know what 'twas now 5 and with that he call'd the
Lieutenant to come to him for one Moment.
When he c^mz^fiys he^ I know now what ail'd
me, I am 'very eafy^ I havefeen my Father; I fhallbe
kill'd the firft Volley 3 let my Mother know I told
you this.
I N a few Minutes after this, a Body of the E-
nemy advanc'd, and the very firft Volley the Regi-
nent receiv'd was the fire of five Plottoons of Gre-
ladiers, by which the Captain and feveral other
Officers, befides private Men were kill'd, and the
whole Brigade was foon after put into Confufionj
:ho' being fupportcd by fome Regiments of the fe-
:ond Line, they ralliea again foon after j the Cap-
;ain's Body was prefently recover'dj but he was
Q^i irrecoverably
228 The Htftory and Reality
irrecoverably Dead, for he receiv'd a Shot in his
Face which kill'd him immediately.
If all the Notices from the invifible World
could have been of any Ufe to him, or he had been
to be wrought upon by Cautions and Advices, which
nothing but a moft obftinate Temper would have
fo totally difregarded, the Man had been fafej But
what can be expe6ted when Men are as plainly
inform'd of things, as by fuch Methods can be fup-
pos'd rational, and will not take the Hint?
LUCIUS FLORUS records of Julius Cajar
that a Woman of a Mafcuhne Countenance, and o
a mighty Stature, appeared to him in a Dream, an(
beckon'd to him to follow her 5 that upon his fol
lowing her, (he went over the River Rubicon^ an*
flood on the farther Bank, beckoning to him to com
over 5 upon which the next Day he boldly enter'^
Italy^
pafling the Rubicon^ which was the Boundary c
Italy on that Side.
I KNOW fome relate this as an Apparition t
C^far in the open Day, but I underftand it
therwife, and that it was underftood of the Genii
of Italy^ as they then call'd it, and that he had fuc
a Vifion in his Sleep, which encourag'd him in h
Attempt upon the Liberty of his Country j int
mating, that the whole Country invited him, an
that he might be fure of Succefs.
I SHALL not run out here into the Account (
Dreams 5 the Variety of them is Infinite, and, as
hinted before, few of them of Importance enoug
to deferve any Regard > but fuch Dreams as nece
farily intimate an Apparition of Spirits, thofe
think muft be Significant.
The following is part Vifion, part Apparitio
and feems to make One be an Evidence of the
ther, and therefore is very particularly to my Pu
pofe. ^—H—a Gentleman of Fortune, eldc
Son of the Family, his Father a Baronet, and of
honourat

honourable Line, and then living, being a young
Man, and a Man of Pleafure, had an Intreague with
a certain Lady, in which his younger Brother (of
the two rather more Gay, and given that way
than himfelf) was his Rival: The Lady was hand-
fome, and of no defpicable Fortune, but much in-
feriour to the eldeft Son of the Family, whofe For-
tune was near two thoufand Pound per Jnnum^ af-
ter his Father Sir Q H- .
The younger Gentleman was really in Love
with the Lady, and inclined to marry her, if he could
bring his Father to confent to it, and had two or
three times fpoken to the old Knight about it^ nor
was his Father much averfe to it, only he thought
her Fortune too fmall.
Sir G told his Son, if he had been his
Eldeft, he fhould have been eafier in the Propofal,
Decaufe his Paternal Eftate being Free, and perfe6t-
ly unincumbered, he thought the Heir was not
under that Neceffity of making his Fortune by a
Wife 5 but that a younger Brother ought always to
feek a Fortune to mend his Circum (lances. He us'd
to jeft with his Son, and tell him, it was this made
him connive at his way of Life 3 that a younger
Brother fhould be Handfom, be a Scholar, Drefs,
and be Gay j the firft to recommend him to the
Court, the fecond to recommend him to the La-
dies 5 that the Heir having no need, was often
left to be a Booby Knight, juft able to write his
lown Name, Halloo to his own Dogs, and ride the
light Saddle i but as he had feldom any Share of
Brains, Nature wifely gave the Wit to one, and
[he Eftate to the others fo, fays the Knight,yourBro-
;her has his Affairs in a quite different Situation.
These good-natur'd kind of Arguments the
Did Knight us'd with his younger Son, to perfuadc
him againft marrying the Ladyj but he did not ab-
olutcly forbid him on pain of his Difpleafure^ and
0.5 of
jjo The Hijtory and Reality
of withdrawing his Hand from him, with refpe6fc
to Money, fo that the young Gentleman kept the
Lady Company openly 5 and though he had not
yet made the Propofal to her, yet did really defign
it ; I mean the honourable Propofal, (viz.) of
Marriage.
O N the other hand, the Efquire, as they calPd
him, kept her Company, on another and far worfe
Account, defigning to make a Miftrefs of her, and
not a Wife.
Upon thefe difFering Views, the Brothers ofter
met at the Lady*s Houfe, that is to fay, at hei
Aunr's where Ihe liv'd 5 for fhe had no Father, anc
her Mother had chang'd Circumftanccs, fo that hej
Daughter was as it were in her own Hands.
The elder Brother had this Advantage in hi;
Intereft, (viz) that the Lady lov'd him, and wouk
have been very well pleas'd if he had courted he
for Marriage, but that was not his Defign j fo tha
in a word, the Cafe flood thus, the younger Bro
ther lov'd the Lady, but the Lady lov'd the Efqj.
The elder Brother laid Siege to her Virtue, anc
the younger laid Siege to her AfFeftion > but, as
faid, the Stream running in Favour of the eldeft
the Lady was in fome Danger of facrifizing he
Honour to her Faflion, and the honcft Pretenfion
of the young Gentleman were in fome Hazard of
Mifcarriage.
The Gentlemen carry'd on their Affairs fepa
rately, and their own way 5 but were neither o
them fo clofe as to conceal it from one anothe
that they had fome Defigns, tho' they did not full]
difcover what their Pretcnfions were; however as
have faid that they often met at the Lady's Apartment
it could not be long before they came to a Con
verfation upon the Subjedt, and this unhappily em

to call you Brother: And fince you are diTpos'd to

us'd like a Gentleman, and if you don't know how
to do it, I am able to teach you.
They were now both very hot> for upon the
laft Words of his Brother, the Efquire laid hold of
his Cane, at which the younger laid hold of his
Sword. Look you Sir, fays he, if you are difpos'd
to treat your Brother thusj take Notice Sir, my
Father's Son may be kill'd, but he can't be can'd,
^nd 1 won't take the leaft Offer towards it at your

Some Company that were not far off, and
Friends to both, ran in upon this, and kept them
afunder for that time j but they foon met again at
the fame Places and tho' it was two or three Days
or more, yet they foon began the fame kind ol
Difcourfej and which was Hill worfe, the elder
Brother, who was certainly in the Wrong, yet
always began the Difcourfe.
I T happen'd they met the laft time at the La-

the Lady was very unhappily abroad > ihc hac
charg'd her Maid, if ever the Gentlemen came

Well, Jack^ fays the elder Brother^ you will

I DO not really underftand what you mean by

a Liberty with me, you have no right to.
What Liberty do I takePy^ji the Efquire. I
ask'd you what Bufinefs you had here with Mrs. —
'
was that taking too much Liberty ? and I ask you
again, is that an Offence?
And! told you, fays Jack^ I fliould give you
no Account of my {d*^^ did not I.^ was that an Of-

what you mean by asking me fuch a Queftion.
I KNOW what I mean by ir, and I fhall expc6t

Nay, if you have a Mind to make a Quarrel of

fhall have a dired Anfwer, or a dired Refufil aC

Well, and I do the fame, fays Jack j but there

Why that's true, Jack^ fays the EfquirCj in
fome Cafes, but not in Love-, Priority is no Claim

Then I'm fare, fays Jackj being an elder Bro-

No, no, fays theEfquire^ I don't expeftitj there
are no Relatives in whoring, Jack, I know no Bro-

my Miftrefs.
Very well, fays Jack^ now you have anfwer'd
me more particularly than ic may be you intended j
and perhaps we may come to an Underiland ing
fooner than I expefted.
What do you mean, y^jy the Efquire^ by an
Underltanding ?
Nay, what can I mean ? I mean, that you give
me to underftand, that you court Mrs. —^
to

Better Language, Jack^ however, fays the
Efqtiire: a Miftrefs, you would fay?
N o T I, fays Jack^ 'twill bear no better Language j

Well, and fappofe ic then, what Bufinefs have

Why, fuppofe then that 1 Court the fame Lady

Not at all Jack^ fays the Efquire^ I flian't allow
you fhould make a Wife of my Miftrefs.
Nor I can't allow, y^j^ Jack, that ^ou fhall

But

B u T I ihall make no Scruple of it I aflurc you,
fays the Efquire^ if flie is willing, for all you are my

And I won't flatter you, that let her be willing
or not willing, if you really do it, fays Jack^ I ihall
make no Scruple to cut your Throat for it if I can,
for all you arc my Brother.
Very well, Jack^ fays the Efquire^ then I know
what I have to truft to.
It's very true, fays Jack^ 'tis the old Road of
Knight Errantry Sir, win her and wear her, is the
Word.
And what muft be done then? fays the Efquire.
Nay, fays Jack^ I need not tell you what to
do} I tell you file's my Wife, I think that's enough
to tell you what you ought to do.
A N D I tell you, fays the Efquire^ fhc's my Miftrefs,
that's enough to tell you, you are a Cuckold, or
fliall befo, I think that's fair, to tell you before-hand.
A N D I ihivk^fays Jack^ that's telling me I muft cue
your Throat before- hand tooj for I will neither be a
Cuckold, or be call'd fo by you, or any Man alive.
N, B, At this the younger Brother rofe up in a
violent Rage, and went away j and the elder
Brother, as hot as he, told him as he went out,
he did well to leave him in Poffeflon.
This urg'd him yet more, and he turn'd back,
and faid, I hope you will have the Manners to fol-
low me.^
No, Jack^ fays the Efquire^ and fwore to him,
you ihan't fight for my Miftrefs, and my Eftate
too J I'll take care firft you fliall get nothing by me.
With all my Heart, fays Jack^ we give a
Rogue time at the Gallows to fay his Prayers, you

I SHALL correct you for your Impudence, Sir,
to-nfiorrow Morning, without fail, fays the Efquire.
Must
tj6 7%^ H/fiory and Reality
Must I wait upon your Worfliip fo long? fays
Jack^ and added fomething very bitter, as if his
Brother was too much a Coward to go on with
it. But it appeared otherwife, for that very Even-
ing he receiv'd a Challenge from the Efquire, ap-
pointing Time and Place to meet the next Day by
Five in the Morning.
These two rafh hot-headed young Fellows
were carried into this Fit of «Rage by the Violence
rather of their fiery Spirits and Paflions, than of
their real Jealoufy, for they had fcarce either of
them begun to engage with the Lady one way or
another j but being hot and heady, they raifed the
Storm between themfelves, and the Match and the
Tinder meeting, the Flame broke out by the mecr
Nature of the thing.
But my Bufinefs is not to moralize upon the
Story, but to relate the Fa6t. The Challenge being
given, they had no more to do but to meet, fight,
play the Butcher upon one another, and leave the
Confequences to Time.
The Father, the good old Knight, who was
then living, could know nothing of what had pafs'd
between his Sons, for he was at that very time
down at his Country Seat into IV Jhire^ at lealt
lixty Miles from London.
On the Morrow early, according to Agreement,
the Brothers prepar'd themfelves for the Bufinefs,
and out they went, but by feveral Ways, to the
Place appointed, their Lodgings being in different
Parts of the Town.
The younger Brother, whofe Blood it feems
was warmeft, was firft out, and it was fcarce Day-
light when he came within Sight of the Place ap-
pointed) there he faw his Brother, as he fuppofcd
him to be, walking haftily to and fro, as if he
waited with Impatience for his coming.
Nay,

Nay, [ays he to himfelf^ I am fure I am withia
the Timej however, don't be impatient. Bro-
ther Tb/^, V\\ be with you prefentlyj and with
that he mended his Pace. He had not gone ma- ,
ny Steps more, but he law his Brother (as he Hill
thought him to be) coming forward, as if it was
to meet him, and with his Sword drawn in his
Hand.
You are mighty nimble with your Sword (faid
he again to himfelf^ what, did you think I would
not give you time to draw ? But how was he fur-
prized when he came up to him, and found it was
not his Brother but his Father, and that inftead of
a Sword in his Hand he had nothing but a fmall lit-
tle Cane, fuch as the old Knight generally walked
with
!
He was the more at a ftand, bccaufe he fuppos'd
his Father was, as is faid above, at his Seat in the
Country, above fixty Miles off: However he was
-out of doubt when he not only faw him nearer
hand, but that his Father fpoke to him ?
Why how now Jack^ fays the old Gentleman^
.What, ^ challenge and draw upon your Father.
* When he thought he faw his Brother with his
Sword in his Hand^ he had laid his Hand on his
Sword.
You may be fure, S'w^fays he^ I did not fuppofe
it was you. I don't doubt you know whom I ex-
pected here 5 'tis a poor cowardly Shift for him
iirft to challenge his Brother, and then fend you
in his flead 5 you would not have done fo your
felf, when you was a young Man.
'Tis no time to talk now, Jack^ fays his Father^
I have your Challenge here, and I am come to fighc
you, not to talk to you > therefore draw, fays he^
you know there's no' Relation in Love j and wiih
that his Father draws his Sword, and advances upon
him.
Draw !
238 The Hijiory and Reality
Draw \fays Jack: what, and upon my Father
Heaven's forbid ! no, I'll be murcher'd firft.
But his Father advancing again, and with i
furious Countenance, as if he would indeed kill him.
Jack pulls out his Sword and Scabbard, and throw-
ing it on the Ground, cry'd out. There Sir, take
it, kill me with it 5 for God's fake, what do yoL
mean ?
But his Father as it were running upon him..

his Power, fcems refolv'd to run from him> at

The young Gentleman, furpris'd and amaz'd at
the Rencounter, was all in Terror and Confufion,
and knew not what to do j but going back a con-
fidcrable Way, and obferving that his Father was
gone, as he thought, he refolved, tho' he had no
Sword, he would go the Place appointed, and fee
if his Brother was comej for he fhould not be able
to fay he did not meet him, however he was thus
ftrangely difarm'd.
Accordingly he went back to the Place^
and fat him down upon the Ground, waiting near
two Hours there, but heard nothing of his Bro-
ther j but as he came away again at the End of
the two Hours, he found his Sword lying juft in
the Place where it was thrown down, or as neat
the Place as he could imagine, tho' he was fure it
was not there when he went the fecond time by
the Place.
This amus'd him more, and he knew not what
to make of it j but he took up the Sword and
went home, wondring at what the meaning of all
this fhould be.
H E had not been long at home, but his Bro-
ther's Servant comes to his Lodging with a very
civil Mcflage from the Efquire, to la?ow how he
did;

did J and the Servant was bid to ask him from his
Brother, if he had not met with fomething extra-
ordinary that Morning, and to tell him that he,
;;his Brother) was very ill, or he would ha' come to
.fee him.
The Oddnefs of the Meflage added to the Sur-
prife he was in before} upon which, he calPd the
MefTenger up Stairs, and parlied with him a little
I thus:
J, What's the matter, JVill? how does my
Brother do ?
ifVill. My Mafter gives his Service to your Wor-
(hip, and fcnt me to know how you do.
J, Indeed I'm out of order a little 5 but how
is your Mafter ? what's the matter ?
U^ilL Why truly, and't pleafe your Worihip^ \
I don't know what's the matter^ I think my Ma-

J. Frighted, Willi with what, pry'thee?
your Mafter is not eafily frighted.
IVill. Why no, an't pleafe you, I know he is
Inot ; but this has been fomething extraordinary j I
don't know how 'tis, for I was not with my Mafter,
but they talk in the Houfe, that he has feen his
Father, or feen an Apparition in the Shape of his
Father.
J. Why fo have I too, Will-y now you fright
me indeed, for I made light of it before > why, it
was my Father to be fure.
fVilL No Sir, alas your Father! why, my old

I'll take my Oath I faw him and fpoke with him
in his Bed, and very ill he was 5 I hope your Wor-

Z40 TToe Hijiory and Reality
J, Yes, yes, you know him, no doubt. Will
I think you liv'd four Years with him, didn't you?
JVilL I drefs'd him, and undrefs'd him five Year
,and a half, an't pleafe you. I think I may fay 1 knov
him in his Cloaths, or out of 'em.
J. Well, William^ and I hope you will allov
that I may know my own Father too, or him j
ha' call'd Father thefe thirty Years ?
WilL Yes to be fure, an't pleafe you.
J. Well then, tell my Brother, it was eithe
my Father or the Devil:, I both faw him, and fpok<

Away went Will with this MefTage back t(
his Mafter, and his Mafter immediately goes agau
with Will to fee his Brother.
A s foon as he came into the Room to his Bro-
ther, he runs to him and kifTes him 5 Dear Jack
fays he^ What has been the matter with us to-day
we have both play'd the Fool, but forgive me m)
Parr, and tell me what has happen'd.
JACK receiv'd him with all the Paffions anc
Tendernefs imaginable, and they fell immediatel)
to comparing things with one another. Willh^diok
his Brother in general how it was, as the youngei
Brother had order'd him j that he had feen his Fa-
ther andfpoke to him 5 and now he told him all t\u
Particulars himfelf, as I have related them above,
and how he came at him with fuch Fury, that he
really thought he would have run him thro' the
Body, and that he run away.
The Squire related his Story much to the fame
purpofe. How that as he was coming to the Place
appointed, his Father met him, and ask'd him whi-
ther he was going 5 that he put him off with a
flight Anfwer, and told him, he was going to Ken-
fmgton to meet fome Gentlemen there, who were
to go with him to Hampton-Court.

That upon this, his Father turn'd very angry 5
and I obfcrv'd, [aid he^ his Face look'd as red as
Fire> he ftamp'd with his Foot, as he us'd to do
when he was provok'd, and told me I put him
ofF with a Sham 5 that he knew my Errand as well
as I did my felfj that I was going to murther
my younger Brother, and that he was come to
fatisfy my Fury with his Blood, and I fhould
murther him, not my Brother.
I was fo confounded, y^i^ the Efquire^ I could not
fpeak to him a good while 5 but recovering my
felf a little, and going to excufe my feif, he grew
more angry j when 1 faid my Preteiifions were as
honeft to Mrs. as yours were, he gave me the
Lye, and indeed, Jack^ I deferv'd it 5 tho' I could
not imagine he knew : but he told me in fhort,
that I lyed, for that I courted her to debauch her,
but that you courted her honourably, to marry her,
and he had given his Confent to it.
I w A s confounded, then begg'd his Pardon j ^o
he bad me go Home and be reconciled to my Bro-
ther, or that he would talk other Language to me
the next time he faw me > and now, dear Jack^ fays,
the Efquire^ I am come to ask your Pardon, not only
in Obedience to my Father, but really on my own
Account, for I am convinc'd I was in the wrong
to you very much.
You may be fure the Brothers were immediate-
ly as good Friends as ever they were in their Lives.
But Itill Jack was uneafy about this being the real
Appearance of his Father j and his Brother's Man
William's Words run in his Mind all that Night 5
for as to this firft: Meeting, it was fo taken up with
the Ecllafies of their Reconciliation, that they had
no time for any thing elfe.
But the next Morning the young Gentleman
went to fee his Brother, to return his Vifit, and
talk things over again.

Dear Brother, fays Jack^ I am very uneafy a-
bout one Part of our Story ftillj I am glad from
my Soul thj^t you and I are brought to underftand
one another, and I hope it fhall never be other-
wife 5 but I cannot be thoroughly fatisfy'd about
who it was that was the Peace-maker j if what
your Man Will fays be true, it cou'd never be my
Father.
Nay, fays his Brother^ Will told me that you
faid it was my JPathcr, or the Devil.
Why yes I did fay fo, fays Jack^ but that was
to intimate my Certainty of its not being my Father 5
not that I fuppos'd it was the Devil. But, pray,
how long has my Father been in Town?
Nay, fays the Efqu\re^ I did not know that he
is in Town, but that I faw him I know well enough.
But did not you fend Will down to him, fays
^ack^ into the Country ? and is it poffible he could
come up fince that, in fo little time ?
Yes, yes, he might come up, fays the Efquirey
he often drives it in a Day and a piece, fometimes
in a Days fix Horfes go at a great rate, you
know.
But pray what think you of it yourfelf? you

I never enter'd into that Difpute in my Thoughts:
'Twas my Father fure ! What elfe could it be?
As you faid. Brother, it mud be my Father or
the Devil.
Nay, I don't know what to fay neither, Bro«f

the Devil and my Father have no manner of Cor-

Besides,

Besides, Brother, piys the Efquire^ how fhould
the Devil owe you and I fo much Good- will, as
to concern himfelf to reconcile us? I believe he
had much rather have feen us raurther one another,

I RATHER believe, fays Jack^ he had a Hand '
in making us Quarrel.
Ay indeed, fo do I, fays the Efquire-j I think,
for my Part, I was mad 5 and, as folks commonly
fay, the Devil was in me, or I fhould never have
been fuch a Fool.
Well, but Brother, fays the young Gentleman^
how fhall we come at the bottom of this Matter?
we both think it was my Father, and we both
think it can hardly be him neither, and we both
think it was not the Devil.
A Y, and, fays the Efqtiire^ if it {hould not be
my Father nor the Devil neither, what fliall we

Why that, indeed, makes me fo impatient to

where you know my Father always lodges, ani
to the Black' Swan-TardJ where you know his

and that he is to be in Town about fix Weeks
hence.
Why that's extraordinary too, I confefs, fays
the Efquire-f I never thought of it, becaufe I ne-^
ver entertain'd any Jealoufy of this kind, it was
quite out of my Head j but, upon my Word, you
make me very uneafy about it now.
For my part, fays his younger Brother^ I would

R \ To
244 T^^^ Hijlory and Reality
To bring the Matter to a conclufion, the two
Brothers agreed, and they went both away to fee
their Father. The very Day they took Horfe to
go down, but fome Hours after they were gone,
a Letter came in to the elder Brother's Houfe from
their Father 5 the Contents of which I ihall take
Notice of prefently.
And firft I am to obferve that when they came
to their Father they found him at home, and ve-
ry ill, nor had he been from home 5 and was great-
ly concerned for the Safety of his Sons, upon the
following Occafion.
The Night before he wrote the Letter, fpoken
of above, he was furpriz'd in his Sleep with a
Dream, or rather a Vifion, that his two Sons had
fallen out about a Mifl:refs> that they had Quar-
rcird to that degree, that they had challeng'd one
another, and were gone out into the Fields to
fight J but that fome body had given him Notice
of it, and that he had got up in the Morning by
four a Clock to meet and prevent them.
Upon this Dream he awak'd in great Diforder
and Terror ; however finding it but a Dream he
had compos'd his Mind, and gotten to fleep again:
but that he dream'd it again in fo lively a man-
ner, that he was forc'd to call up his Man that
waited on him to fit up the red of the Night
with him j and he was frighted, and much out of
order with the Fright.
That, in Confequence of this Dream, hchadfent
a Servant up Exprefs, with Orders to ride Night
and Day, to enquire how his Sons did, and to
bring him word if there had been any fuch breach
among them 5 and earneflly to prefs them, if fuch
a breach had been, that they would confent to lee
him mediate between them, that it might go no
farther 'till he could come up, that fo he might
put an end to their Refentments, and make Peace
among
of APPARiriO N S. z^f
among them, according to his Dreams : and this
was the Letter, mention'd above, that came to
Hand in a few Hours after they were fet out.
It cannot be doubted but it was very con-
founding to his Sons to hear the Account their
Father gave them of his Dream, or Vifion rather,
about their Quarrel ; and it was equally amazing
to fee it confirmed by all the true Particulars 5 alfo
that the old Gentleman, to be fure, had been fo far
from being at London^ that he had fcarce been a
whole Day off from his Bed.
They conferr'd together ferioufly upon the
private Queftion, (viz.) whether they fhould
tell their Father the Story of their Quarrel,
but efpecially of their feeing him feverally, and
his really parting them, or preventing their fight-
ing.
Upon the whole, they concluded not to let
their Father know of his Likenefs (as theycall'd it)
appearing to them, left it might difquiet him too
much; and for the reft, as they were perfedly re-
concil'd again, they faid there was no manner of
Occafion to mention it at all 5 fo they only paid
their Compliment as a Vifit of Duty, to fee how
he did, and to ask his Bleffingj IVill having told
them that he was out of Order : and as for his
Letter, they could happily tell him they had not
feen it.
According to this Refolution they per-
form'd the Ceremony of Vifiting their Father, and
made hafte away again, that they might converfe
the more freely about this ftrange Conjun6tion of
Circumftances, which had in it fo many things
furprizing to their Thoughts, and even to their Un-
derftandings j for they knew not what to make of
it, nor, indeed, could they refolve it into any thing
but this, which is to my purpofe exa6lly, and
which is the reafon of my mentioning the whole
R ^ Story,
The Bijiory and Reality
Story, namely, that here was a double Apparition
within the compafs of our propos'd Syftem.
1. Here was the Apparition of the living Pei>
fon of their Father, without his participation in
the Aftion 5 his Face- Voice, and, perhaps, Habit
Was aflum'd, and yet he himfelf knew nothing of
the Matter, was not in the ieaft concerned in ir^
or acquainted with it.
2. Here was an Apparition to the Father m
Dream j 'twas a plain Vifion, the thing that was
true inFaft was reveal'd to him in his Sleep, which
is the very Subjeft I am now fpeaking of. The
Sons were reprefented, or appear'd to him. Quar-
relling, and in a ftate of Feud, as they really were^
and yet neither of them knew any thing of the
Matter.
From hence (fuppofingtheReality of the Story)
It neceflarily follows that a Spirit or invifible Be-
ing, let it be calPd what we pleafe, may take upon
it the Shape, Face, Voice of any living Perfon,
whom it pleafes to reprefenc, without the Knowledge,
Confent, or Concurrence of the Perfon fo repre-
fented, in any manner whatfoever.
And from hence alfo it is evident that Dreams
Are fometimes to be calPd, and really are, Appariti-
ons, as much as thofe other vidble Apparitions which
are feen when we are (as we call it) broad awake j
that Apparition is to the Eyes of the Soul, and as it
is fo, it may be feen as well fleeping as waking,
for the Imagination deeps not : the Soul ceafes in-
deed to a6t organically, but it ceafes not to a^
as a Soul, and in a fpirituous Manner, and confe-
quently can aft upon fpirituous Objefts 3 and that as
well in Sleep as at any other time.
I GOULD load this Account with Story, for
Example is frequent in thefe Cafes, and I am
forc'd to leave out fome which are very good,
and would be entertaining, becaufe they are too
tedious
of APPA Rif IONS.
tedious for the Work j befides, I am not preten-
ding to write a Colleftion of old Stories, if I did
I fhould call it a Hiftory of all the Chimney-Cor-
nei's in the three Kingdoms. However, I mufl
not leave you barren of Examples neither in Ca-
fes fo pregnant > take one more which my Authot
afTures me was never in Print.
A CERTAIN Lady of good Figure and fome
Quality, had a terrible Quarrel with her Husband
upon the great and critical Points of Virtue and
Honour j he was a Gentleman of publick Buflnefs,
and pafs'd for a Man of Senfej but had that par-
ticular Infirmity, which with me will always pafs
for a deficiency in the Underftandingj I mean to
be jealous of his Wife, and yet to be able to fix
nothing upon her, no not fo much asajuft blou
upon her Converfation.
'Tis very hard for a Man to be Fool enough
to difquiet himfelf on fuch an Account, and
not be Knave enough to make it uneafy to his
Wife too } I fay Knave, becaufe where there is no
Juft caufe of Reproach, he cannot be an honeft
Man that loads his Wife with the Scandal of it.
He had thought fit to ufe her very ill upotu
this Subje6t many times, with no manner of Foun-'
dation, nay, indeed, not fo much as a pretence for
it, except what was to be fetch'd from his own
bewildred Imagination j and he gave himfelf up fo
much to his Jealoufy, without grounds, that his
Wife was oblig'd to lay her Condition before
feme of her Relations, who took upon theni to
talk with him about it.
This talking with him had a worfe EfFe£t than
was expefted, for the Man was fo far froai being
influenced by the friendly Expoftulations of his
Wife's Kindred, that he grew rude and abufive to
them 5 and if any one of them fpoke a little war-
mer than ordinary in her favour, he turn'd it pre-
Jl 4 fently
248 The Hijiory and Reality
fently upon that Perfon, as if he had been the Man,
and had been naught with her 5 and yet when one of
them challeng'd him to give any one Inftance of
his Wife's Condudl, or of any Perfon's alTociating
with her in a manner as fhou'd give an honeft
Man the leaft grounds of fufpicion, he could not
ailign the leaft Reafon j but as is moft true in or-
dinary, that thofe who are the moft Jealous have
oftentimes the leaft Caufe for it, fo it was here 5
yet notwithftanding all the Expoftulations that
were, or could be ufed with him, the cooleft Rea-
fonings and moft friendly Perfuafions, he continued
to ufe his Wife fo ill, that her Friends began to
think it neceflary to part them.
The Lady, a Woman of Piety as well as Vir-
tue, tho' griev'd heartily with the ill Ufage, and
particularly as it reproach'd her Virtue, yet was
loath to unhinge her Family and feparate from her
Husband, having alfo two Children which fhe
could not part with, her AfFe6lion not fufFering
her to leave them to want the Care and Condu6t
of a Mother; fo fhe chofe rather to bear his daily
ill Ufage of her, than to leave her Family.
But he carried the Bruitiili Part fo far at
length, that not content to ufe her in the moft
fcandalous manner with his Tongue, he fell upon
her with his Hands, and two or three times, in
Jiis Rage, abus'd her very much : fhe conceal'd
this part (for his fake) as much as fhe could, and
endeavour'd to prevent its being known.
But he took care to expofe himfelf in it up-
on many Occafions, and particularly by affronting
a Gentleman of his own Acquaintance, and feme
Relation to him too: the Cafe was thusj He fell
to charging his Wife with diihonefty in his or-
dinary Difcourfe, and before Strangers > upon which
the Gentleman faid, Fye, Coufin, really I believe
you wrong her, at leaft you fhould be very fure
you
of APPARITIONS. z4^
yoLi were in the right before you talk'd fo 5 your
Lady has a general Charader of an honcft, modefl
and virtuous Woman > and I am told flie is a very
pious and religious Perfon alfo.
A T this he flew out in a Paflion, and faid, D—
^
her, he was fatisfy'd {he was a Whore.
But, Coufin, fays the Gentleman, then I fup-
pofe you know the Perfon too, and could prove
the Fad!
He believ'd he did, he [aid.
Nay, you ought to be very fureof it, Coufin,
fays he, before you charge your Wife fo poii-
tively.
H E anfwer'd, without any manner of Refpeft to
his Coufin, I believe you are the Manj and adds,
I take it for granted.
What Sufpicion, fayi the Gentleman^ did I ever
give you of ir? I was never in your W^ife's Com-
pany in my Life, but when you were prefent.
'T I s no matter for that, fayi he^ if you were
not guilty, why fliould you concern yourfelf to
vindicate her?
The Gentleman, tho' greatly provok'd, kept his
Temper ftill, and fmil'd at him 5 Coufin, fays he^
I doubt you have no better Argument to prove
your Wife's Guilt than you have mine, and if you
haiVt, fhe's as innocent as a fucking Child.
His Smiling provok'd him, and he gave the
Gentleman the Lie, and added fome very fcurrilous
Language to it, fuch as might be expected from
a Mad-man, a Man out of himfelfj not by Luna-
cy, as a Diflemper, but by that worfe Frenzy,
call'd groundlefs Jealoufy.
•
As giving the Lie is the lafl Injury one Man
can do to another with his Tongue, it fo provok'd
his Coufin, that fcorning 1:0 draw his Sword up-
on him, he corrected him heartily for it with his
.Cane,ashe deferv'd 5 and he againjlike a true Coward,
(when

(when they were gone) reveng'd himfelfupon hi;
Wife J for he abus'd her again in a bruitifh and bar-
barous Manner : nor did it pacify him at all that he
vented his Rage thus upon his Wife at that timej
but he continued it upon every Occafion of his being
harrafs'd with his own Jealoufy : and when-ever he
abus'd his Wife after that time, he upbraided hei
with this Gentleman, and with her ftill keeping him
Company 5 tho', as it appeared afterwards, the Gen-
tleman was not in England^ nor had been for fevc-
ral Months.
I T happened one time in particular, that coming
home, not at all in Drink, but very much out oi
Humour, and, as it fecm'd, provok'd, tho' it could
not be fo much as guefs'd atjwhat the Reafon was,
he pick'd a Quarrel with his Wife, and without any
other Provocation than what was to be found in his
own want of Temper, fell foul of her in a mod un^
merciful manner j and had not Help been fetch'd in
'twas fear'd he would have murther'd her. In a
Word, Neighbours coming in to her refcue, faved
her from farther Mifchiefj yet before them all he
bad her go out of the Houfe, and forbid her com-
ing any more within his Doors.
The Lady could not now avoid what flie had
fo long been perfuaded to before j fo taking (bmc
Cloaths, and her own Jewels, which ihe brought to
him, file withdrew the lame Evening to her own
Brother's Houfe, taking fufficient Witnefs of the
occalion of it.
B u T to bring this Story nearer to the Cafe in
Hand : The Gentleman whom he had thus ill us'd,
had (on fome occafions of bis own) been oblig'd a^
bout fvvQ Months before this laft Broil to go oVer
to Germany 5 and as he went from England by Sea
and landed at Hamburgh^ he travell'd fi-om Ham'^
hurgh up to Magd^bw^h^ and from thence to Leip^
ftck in Samny,
A4
of APPARITtO NS. 251
As he was fitting alone in a Summer-Houfe as
ve call it, or Garden-Houfe^ as they more properly
:all it there, belonging to a Burgher of Leipfick^
ind reading a Book to divert himfelf, being in the
leat of the Day, and a little after Dinner 5 he dropc
ifleep, and drcam'd that a Lady was come from
England to fpeak with him, and was in the Houfe
svaiting for him. ;
Upon this Dream, and being not very found
ifleep, only leaning his Head on his Hand as he
^vas reading, he wak'dj and as foon as he wak'd
he ftarted up, and intended to go into the Houle
:o fee who it fhould be, when immediately he fees
I Lady in an EngUJh drefs coming up the Garden
;owards the Summer- Houfe.
He did not know her at firfl: j but when flie
:ame nearer fhe fpoke to him j he calling her by
ber Name, would have faluted her > but fhe feem'd
to decline it, and flepping back, faid. You and T,
Sir, have been fufficiently abus'd upon that Head
already j and I come to you for Juftice. I am ill
us'd, and in danger of being murther'd every Day
!by my cruel Husband on your Account, and am ac
hft turn'd out of Doors.
Alas ! fays he^ Madam, he is a Brutifh Man,
*nd I am very forry 5 but what can I do for you ?
You know my Innocence, fays Jhe^ as far as re-
lates to yourfelfj do me juflice, I ask no more : and
that moment fhe difappear'd.
He was extremely furpriz'd, as he might well
be indeed 5 and the more, becaufe he had not the
leaft notion of its being, an Apparition, no more
had the Burgher's Servant who let her in at the
Door, and waited on her up the Garden to the
Summer-Houfe.
He went immediately back into the Houfe, and
cnquir'd who let the Lady into the Houfe ; and
the Servant that had uiher'd her up the Walk in
the
2^1 The Hijlory and Realky
the Garden told him he did j and alfo that he hac
that Minute let her out again > but looking cm
into the Street, nothing of her could be feen again
or did he ever fee or hear any more of her in tha
manner.
While this pafs'd, the Lady liv'd a very me
lancholly retifd Life in her Brother's Family, feeing
no Company, and fpending her time in a moft un
comfortable Solitude jefpecially grieved for the Re
proach fo caufelefly rais'd upon her Chara61:er, anc
having nothing to comfort her but the knovvledg
of her own Innocence ; that which we call th(
Comfort ofagoodConfcience: which,as the Worl
goes now, I muft be cautious how I lay too mucl*
Itrefs upon, or moralize too much upon, left
Ihould be call'd Religious and Grave, which is
much as to fay Mad.
This Separation continu'd (ome time j all en
deavours to bring it to a Reconciliation had been
try'd, but prov'd ineffeftual 5 the Husband continu
ing infolencly abufive to his Wife 5 and his Wife
(Things being carry'd to fuch a height) infifting
upon a Reparation of the Injury ofFer'd to her Re-
putation, by having either the Fa6ts prov*d, or a
due Caufe of Sufpicion afligned. Between both, a
Reconciliation feem'd impra6licable, and Friends on
both fides having done their utmoil, began to give
it over.
But, to the ngreeable furprize of all that wifh'd
well to the Family, the Husband comes one Morn-
ing to his Wife's Brother all alone, and ask'd to
fpcak with his Wife.
Her Brother was a litttle doubtful at firft
what Anfwer to give him-, and particularly was
afraid to bring his Sifter forth to him, not knowing
what the Devil and an exafpcrated Temper might
prompt him toj and he perceiving it, faid, with a
quite differing Tone from what he us'd to talk with.
You

l^ou need not be afraid, Brother, to let me fee'
my
Ivife, tho' indeed I have given you all Caufe e-
! ough to be uneafy 5 but I affure you I will foon
iitisfy you that I do not come to do her any harm,
jut jult the contrary: I come to put an end to all
j
[lis wicked Breach, and that in a manner as ihall
e to your Sacisfa6l;ion, and hers too 5 and I am very
ailing you fhall be prefent when I fpeak to her,
)r I delire you fhould hear what I have to fay.
He fpoke it with fuch an apparent Alteration in
is Temper, that it was eafy to fee that he was
uite another Man, and that there was no hazard in
tting him fee her: fo he went and acquainted his '
^ife with what had pafs'd^ who tho' fhe was a
ttle afraid at firft, yet upon her Brother's perfua-
ons came down, and her Brother led her into the
wOom to him, in his Hand.
A s foon as he faw his Wife, he run to her, and
)ok her in his Arms and kifs'd her, holding her
it 3 but was not able to fpeak a word for fome
<me. At laft getting a little vent of his Paflion,
^y Dear, fays he^ I have wrong'd and abus'd you j
id I come to acknowledge it in as publick a man-
er as poflible I can. I come to ask you Pardon for
, and am ready to declare my full fatisfadion of
Dur Innocence, in as open a manner as ever the
Om/ and my own ungovern'd Paflion inflam'd me
jainft you. Make your own Demands what Satis-
iftion 1 fhall make you, and what Security I fhall
ive you, that you {hall have no more fuch Treat-
lent, I am ready to comply with them 5 and go
ome with me, if you dare truftme. The Moment
break my Promifc to you in the leall Circum-
ance, you fliall freely remove again without the
.'aft hindrance,or the leaft Contradi6l:ion from me
:
\ the mean time depend upon it, you fhall never have
ly occalion of uneafinefs given you, and as long
1 1 live I will acknowledge, when ever you defirc
it,
jc^ The Hlfiory and Reality
it, that I did you wrong, and that you gave me nt
juft occafion for what has pafs'd.
He fpoke this with fo n^uch Affedbion, andev(
with Tears in his Eyes, that he forc'd Tears nd
from his Wife only, but from her Brother too, anci
another Relation of hers that was in the Rooi
with them. In a word,the Reconciliation was mad
in a few Minutes j for he not only comply'd wit
any thing his Wife or her Brother defir'd, butevei
more than they ask'd 5 and when they propos'd that
to prevent Miftakes afterwards, he would confen
they fhould put into Writing what they defir'c
-. and what he had faid to her, He calPd for a Pe
and Ink, and drew it out himfelf in the fullel
Terms imaginable, to the fame purpofe as has bee:
related, and fuller indeed than they could 'defire
and fet his Hand to ir, defiring the Brother and th
other Relation to be WitnefTes ofit, and then gav
it to his Wife.
Upon this his Wife with a glad Heart wen
home that very Night along with him, her Bro
ther and the other Relation being invited to g
alfo, which they did ; where he entertain'd ther
very kindly at Supper, which finifh'd the Recon
ciliation, and they liv'd very comfortably togcthc
ever after.
But now for the Reafon and Occafion of di
this 5 and whence this ftrange Alteration proeeededl
To this 'purpofe, you are to underftand that gim
Evening this Gentleman being cither in his ChalW
ber, or fome other Room in his Houfe, (the Stoft
is not particular in that part) he fees his Coufii
who had differed with him about his Wife, comi
into the Room, and fays to him, Coufin, I am vd"
forry to hear you have continu'd to ufc your WH
ill, and at lad have turn'd her away upon my Afi
count. I come on purpofe to admonifh you to reP
pent of the Injury you have done her, for fhe is In

or the Wrong you do me, I am oat of your reach
:
3ut fetch your Wife home, and reconcile your
elf to her, or I fball viiit you again much lefs ta
'our Satisfadtion than I do now.
H E gave him no time for a Reply, but imme-
liately difappear'd. It may be eafily guefs'd what a
^nflernation he was left in, when he found it was
n Apparition. He concluded his CouCn was dead,
•ecaufe he faid he was out of his reach 5 and he
oncluded that this was his Ghofr, or his difquieted
ioul, and he dreaded the threatning of his Return/
ie endeavoured to wear it off of his Mind, but it
/onld not do j the Impreflion to be fure would be
trengthned by his own Guilt, and both together
rought him to himfelf.
For this is to be obferv'd in all fuch things, viz.
That it is not the Fright or the Surprize that works
n the Mind, but the Convidion -, 'and therefore
ho' this is one of thofe Relations which I do not:
ake upon me to aflert the faft of from my own
;nowledge, yet fuppofing it to be true, the Moral
J the fame, and on that Accouik I relate it, viz.
That there may be an Apparition of a Perfon
iving J and yet the Perfon living,, and fo feeming
o appear, not know any thing of it, or be any
7ay concern'd in it ; and fo in this Story now told,
c is imply'd, that the Lady here was living when
he appeared to the Gentleman in Germany^ and that
he Gentleman in Germany was living when he ap-
>ear'dtohis Coufin in L^;^i^o;^, whatever manner they
ppear'd in> and yet it feems that neither of them
:new any thing of the matten, and doubtlefs had
10 concern at all in it.
I HAVE not been able to dive fo far into this
Jtory, as to fay, that they were ever enquired of
fterv/ard, whether they were acquainted with the
^ircumftances or no 3 but I am indifferent as to that
Point,
ic^ The Hijlory and Reality
Point, it is out of Queflion with me, that. the,
might not be any way concerned in the thing
ielf, and yet that it might be really an Appariti^
of the Perfons, their Faces, Voices, Cloaths, ai
all the needful Apparatus fit for the Delufion.
There arc many Inftances of like kii
with this, and I have a very particular Relation
me of a Perfon who in Apparition told a Friend (|
his, of the Fire of London^ two Months before
happen'd, mentioned the manner of the Conflagraj
tion, how it would begin in the Heart of the Citj
and would burn Eaft and Weft, and lay the Cit
level with the Ground j to ufe the very words.
H E happen'd not to tell the Place exaftly whet
it was to have been done j if he had, he might hav
been afterwards brought into Trouble, by the un
advifed relating the Particulars 5 for his Friend be
lieved he really fawhim 5 and not that it was an Ap
parition : But it feems he made a long Religion
Excurfion upon the difmal Condition of the Citi
zens, and how their Pride would be brought low
how their Glory would be laid in the Duft> an<
how it was all to be look'd upon as a Blow upo;
them for their Luxury, and for their publick Sins
and fo feem'd to preach pretty [much : And yoi
know if Spirits from the other World were t(
preach, fome People have fuch an Averfion to tha
dull heavy Bu{inefs,as they call it, that they wouk
give very little heed to it. I fay, the Apparitior
feem'd to preach pretty much upon the Subjed:, aqtc
fo the Friend began to be weary of the Difcourfe.
and put him off to fomething elfc, ^
That which feems Particular in this Story, and
which (had I room here) would take up fome time
to Difcourfe upon at large, is, that the Apparitior
went off in Form, not difcovering it felf fo much
as to be an Apparition > but came in at the Door,
was let in by a Servant in the ufual manner, aftei
knockini
of APPARITIONS. z^7
knocking at the Door, and was carry 'd into the
Parlor among the Family 5 that it difcoiirs'd of
other Matters alfo 5 as of the Dutch War, and the
bloody Engagement at Sea : I do not remember
exadly, whether it Hiid a bloody Engagement had
been, or would be 3 but 1 think it was Engage-
ment that had lately been.
That there were feveral other Tranfitions in
their Difcourfe, from one Article of publick Bufi-
aefs to another > and at laft to that of the Fire of
London : The Gentleman who it was difcours'd to
!eem'd not to be much concerned at the Prediction
ibout the Fire, looking upon it as a piece of guefs-
^ork, and that his Friend fpoke it as of a thing
vhich he fear'd, rather than as a thing he foretold,
md pretended to know of : But after the Terrible
^Conflagration had happened, and that the City was
ndeed laid low from the Eaft to the Weft, as
lad been mentioned, then all the Particulars came
nto his Mind with fome weight, and fome unufual
efleftion j for the Circumftances were too evident
o be flightly thought of
However it pafs'd over in the ordinary way,
vith a little kind of wonder 3 and it was ftrange
hat Mr. M ihould be able to talk fo j and fure
^4r. M— deals with the Devil^ and the like>
/hereas all this^while Mr. M 'knew nothing of
hie Story i and whatever Hand it was, and for
whatever kind purpofes, no notice was taken of it,
nd Mr. M—had fo little knowledge of it himfelf
aat his own Houfe was burnt down in the gene-
il difafter, and he had hardly time to fave one
uarter part of his Goods.
It might indeed beform'd here as an Objefbioa
ainft this Notion, of good Spirits from the Infivi-
c World,and their concerning themfelves in giving
lotices of approaching Mifchiefs, viz. That they
not concern themfelves to give fuch Notices in
S Cafes
ijS The Htftory and Reality
Cafe of publick Calamities, when many thoufand
not of Perfons only, but even of Families, are con
cerned, and in danger > and even where many par
ticular Perfons, who at other times have had fud
warnings from them, and have been as it were thei
Particular care, have been left to fall in the com
mon difafter.
This is what I may take notice of again, i
its proper place j but at preCcnt I am rather ot
ferving to you what is, than the Reafon of its bein
fo : The ways and works of Providence are Sov<
reign and Superiour 3 the Manner conceal'd,and bi

nor is it neceflary that we fhould be always able 1

he come to appear in fo fmall a matter, as that
doing Juflice to one fingle Child, when fo mai

Relations concerning themfelves in the leaft
their Deliverance ? and the Man did accordin;^
ask the Queftion, as we fliall fee in its place
but had no anfwer given him, as indeed I think ,
ought not to have expeded : but of this hereaft

had no Power to come hither, and give noflcc of
it 5 if they had, what Numbers of Predidtions,
Fcrvebodings and Apparitions would there have been
in the City for fome Months before
!
But are we not anfwer'd by the Scripture, and
might we not reply in the Language ofour Saviour
fpcaking of the general Deluge, M<2/^. xxiv. :58, 39.
For as in the days that were before the flood^ they were
gating and drinking^ marrying^ and giving in marriage^
until the day that Noe entred into the Ark^ and knew
not until the flood came^ and took them all away j Jq
Jhall alfo the coming of the Son of Man he }
Just fo likewife was it at the time of the Fire
of London: 'tis laid indeed, with fome Remark, that
it was not a Wedding Night to many, if to any one
Couple in the City 3 becaufc the Fire beginning on
the Sunday Morning, very few, ifany, are faid to be
marry'd of a Saturday j but as it was a mighty Cu-
ftom in thofe Days to marry on a Sunday^ fo
there were a great many Weddings appointed for
the next Morning, which were hinder'd without
any forebodings or foreknowledge 5 and that which
was infinitely worfe, many Women in Travel that
very Night, were, as it was reported, forc'd to be
carry'd out of their Chambers in the very Article
of Child-Birth, and fome as I have heard were de-
liver'd in the very Paflage from one Houfe to ano-
ther: Others, not thinking the Fire would follow
fo fall, having rcmov'd but a little way, their
extremity being great, were oblig'd to be remov'd
again \ yet we find no notice of any of thefc
things given in the lead.
This indeed is what I fay we cannot account
for, neither is there any need for us to account for
them in the Difcourle we are upon -, for our Quefti-
pn is not. Why there arc no more Notices given
than there are, and why ihey are not univerfal to
one as well as another 5 as if ic were a Graca Men
Si ought
z6o '
TheHifiory and Reality
ougbl to have an equal Claim to : But 'tis a Pro-
jpoiition that fuch Apparitions there are, and that
therefore there are certain Agents fo appointed to
appear. .
We have like Accounts to thefe at the time of
the great MafTacre at Paris -y a critical Jun6ture, in
which the Rage of Hell feem'd to be carry'd to
^ terrible Height, and when innocent Blood lay
ready to be fpilt in a terrible manner 5 the Unguar*
d^d Proteftants having no Means to avoid the Mil*
.chiefs that attended them, and no Strength to refifl:
the Power of the Cut-throat Armies which fur-
rounded them> fo they had no Intimations from
ihe invifible World to aflift their Efcape.
^yBuT what does this amount to, any more than
the like Cafes may argue in a thoufand Calami-^
ties and Difafters which have befallen Mankind be-
fore? Nay, it confirms the grand Truth which I
have infifted on 5 namely, that Souls departed know
j!ot any thing, and can communicate nothing, tho'
unembody'd Spirit may.
For could the departed Souls ofdeceas'd Relati-
ons have known that their Fathers, or Children,
cr Brothers, or Relids, (^c, were the next Day to
bavc been murther'd, can we doubt but they would
have given them all the Notice, that it was in
their Power to do, and at leaft have alarm'd them
io^ as to put them upon their Guard, and give
them an Opportunity to die like Hero's, as many
of them were? and as they did not do thus, Ithinkj
without Injuftice, or Prefumption, we may con-?
elude they cannot > they could not then, neither
can others do the like now.
And yet as to fuch Notices as the Inhabitants
of the invifible World were allow'd to make, I
believe they were not without them at that time,
iho' it was not thought fit by the Appointment
of Heaven to have the wicked Rcfolution of Mur-
ther
of APPARITIONS. i6t
ther and Maflacre defeated : as to the Rc.ifons
why, which is what we have nothing to do to
difpute, that we leave in Silence, as we may well
do.
The Hiftories of thofe Times arc full of the
fecret Warnings and Notices then given by the kind
Apparitions of thofe invifible Agents (whoever they
are) in Dream. The Admiral Coligni had no 1 is
than three particular Notices given him by Dreams,
that his Life was in danger, and that he would
be murther'd if he ftay'd in Paris-y an Exprefs was
fent him from the Count S -—, at Saumur^ to
make his Efcape and flee for his Life before it
was too latCj nay, it was even faid that the King
of Navarr^ who was afterwards Hen. IV. fent a
private Meflage to him to be gone, and if he ftaid
one Night longer he would find it impoffible:
Bur, as they faid afterwards, his Hour was come,
and his Fate was determined j and he was deaf to
his Friends, for feveral others who had a Jealoufy
Df his Danger, gave him like Warnings, but it was
all in vain, he was deaf and indolent to his own
Safety.
Some others who were more obedient to the
heavenly Vifion, more toucht then with the Senfe
of their Danger, as the Count de Montgomery^ the
Vidame o^Chartres^de Caverfac^^iTidi others, too many
:o name 5 and who had feverally, and fome of them
ointly, timely Warning of their Danger, mounted
:heir Horfes, and fled the very Night before, and
preventing the vigilance of their Purfuers, made
heir Efcape.
I MIGHT here enlarge upon the Probability of
:his as a Maxim, that tho' thefe Spirits may have
eave to give fuch Notice and fuch Warnings to
bme particular Perfons for the faving their Lives,
/et we are not to fuppofe 'tis plac'd in their Power
:b contravene the Determination of Heaven, and
S } to
i6t The Hijlory and Reality
to a£t contrary to Appointments of his Providence,
efpecially in things of general laiporc, fuch as pub-
lick Judgments, which are immediately in the dif-
pofing of his Power, and not to be difappointed
or dclay'd.
Besides, as we may have Rcafon to believe
that they all a<5t by Commiflion, 'tis alfo moft cer-
tain that they cannot go an Inch, no not a Hair's
breadth beyond that Commiflion, or ftep one Foot
out of the Way of it, to the right Hand, or to
the left : and thence we are to infer that they d(>
not give farther or more frequent Notices to us,
becaufe they are not permitted j and this is, befides
the reft, adding a greater Reverence to the thing;
nfelfi for take off their fupcrior Commiflion, and
I know not what we fliould fay to them, or of
,V/hat real Notice or Value they would be.
I CANNOT but fay that there were many No-
tices given of the Calamity of the Parijian Maf-
facre, which were enough to have allarm'd the

THERE is a great Clamouryas I migbt juftly
call it, rais'd about Peoples appearing juft at

no foundation for any of thefc Relations, much Icfs
for the Circumftances j and yet the Apparition it

in the Eafi-Indies^ or at Sea at fome vaft diftance.
A CERTAIN Lady of my Acquaintance going

to one but flie fhould find that he died that very
Aloment, or as near as could be found out.
About two Months after her Husband comes
home very wcllj but had an Accident befell him
in his Voyage, 'viz. that ftepping into the Boar,
or out of the Boat, he fell into the Sea, and was in
danger of being loft 5 and this they Calculated upon
to be as near the time as they could judge, that he
appear'd to his Wife. Now if this was his Ghoft,or
Apparition of his Soul, in the Article of Death, it
feems his Soul was miftaken, and did not know
whether it was difmifs'd or no'5 which is a little
flrange, I muft confefs : but of that hereafter.
Sir Jo' O was a Perfon of Note, and
of well known Credit > his Lady and one of her
Sons iiv'd here in London j and being of a gay Dif-
pofiiion, and given to live high and expenlive, it
was thought fhe fpent beyond what the Knight
could afford, and that he was fenfible of it, and
uneafie at it : She had a very good Houfe in London^
and a Country Houfe or Lodgings for the Summer
at and kept a great Equipage} the Confe-
quence of things did at laft prove, that Sir J 's
diflikc of it was juftly founded ; but that's by the
by.
I T happened one Day, the Lady being at her
Country Lodgings, a Perfon well drefs'd, appearing
very much like a Gentleman, came to her City
.
Houfe, and knocking at the Door, ask'd the Maid
if there were any Lodgings to be let there, and if
her Lady was at home 5 the Maid anfwer'd No,
there were no Lodgings to Lett there 5 and fpeak-
ing as if it was with fome Rcfentment, Lodgings !
fays fhe, no, / think not /'my Lady does not ufe to
Lett Lodgings. Well but Sweet Hearty fays he^ don't
be difpleas'd, your Lady has had fome thoughts of
flaying at her Summer Lodgings all the Winter,

and fo would difpofe of fome Apartments here for
the Parliament Seafon j and I am directed by her
felf to look upon the Rooms, and give my Aniwerj
let me but jufl: fee them, Child, I fhall do you no
harm : fo he flep'd in, and as it were pufh'd by
her, going into the firlt Parlour, and fat down in
an eafy Chair, his Servant flaying at the Door 5 and
as the Maid did not apprehend any Mifchief, fhe
went in after him 5 for he did not look like one
that came with an ill Defign, or to rob the Houfe ;
but look'd like a Gentleman that could have no-
thing of fucha kind in his Viewj fo I fay ihewent
in after him.
When fhe came in he rofc up, and looking a-
30Ut the Room, he found fault with every thing,
:he Furniture, and the manner of it, nothing pleas'd
lim y not as if not good enough for him, but that
ill was too good, and too rich, far above her Qiia-
Mty that own'd it 5 That the Lady did not know
ivhat fhe did, that it was an Expence fhe could not
carry on, and her Eflate would not fupport it 5 but
rhat fuch a way of living would bring all the Fa-
mily to Ruin and Beggary, and the like.
B Y and by fhe carried him into another Parlour,
and there he did jufl the famej he told her he ad-
ftiir'd what her Lady meant j that fhe liv'd in a
Figure which Sir John's Eflate could never main-
tain, and fhe would but ruin him, and bring him
into Debt, and fo he would be undone by her Ex-
travagance.
. Upon this the Maid begun to take him fhort
ft little, and told him, this was all out of the way
Df what he came about 5 if the Lodgings were too
good for him, that was his Bufinefs indeed, butelfehe
had nothing to do with her Lady, and how fhe
pleas'd to furnifh her Houfe : That her Mafler w^s
a Gentleman of a great Eflate, and had large Plan-
tations

rations in Jamaica *j that he conftantly fupply'd her
Lady with Money, fufficient for her Support, and
for all her Expcncesj and {he wonder'd he fhould
trouble himielf with that, which ilic was fure was
none of his Bulinefs : in ihort, the Girl huffed him,
and ask'd him what it was to him, who was a
Stranger, how her Lady Hv'd.
However he turns to the Maid, and fitting
down again, calmly enter'd into fome Difcourfc
with her about her Lady, and her way of Living
and told fo many of the Secrets of the Family to
her, that fhe began to ufe him better, and to per
ceive that he knew more of the Family than fhe
thought he had, or indeed than fhe did her felfj
at lafl the Wench began to be uneafie, and to que-
flion in her Thought, whether it was not her Ma-
iter himfelf, come over Incognito^ and only that he
had not yet difcover'd himfelf.
She tried feveral times to learn who he was, hiji
Quality, his Country, his Name, and how fhe
might fend to him 5 but he put it off, only told her
he would go to where her Lady lodg'd, anc
wait upon her Lady himfelf^ and fo treating the
Servant very civily, and thanking her for fhowin^
him the Houfe, he went away in Form with hii
Servant following him, fo that he did not vanifh a!
an Apparition at all.
Yet the poor Wench was very uneafie, fhe be-
gan to think it could not be an ordinary Creature,
becaufe he gave fuch flrange and particular Accouau
of things done in the Family 5 as where feveral thing;
were depofited that belong'd to the Family, with feve
ral Circumilances belonging to her Miflrefs, to hen
little Son, and to his Father in the Weft-Indies^y and
in fhort, faid fome things, which, as fhe faid, none
but the Devil could tell of: which, by the[way, was
talking as ignorant People talk of fu^'h things
namely.
of APPARITIO NS. ^67
namely, that if any thing be faid, or done, out of
the ordinary Way, and more than is common for
Men to talk, or do, they immediately fay it mufl
be the Devil.
I T mufl be confefs'd, it flicws a Difference be-
tween the Prefent and the Pafl Ages: In former
Times, if a Man did extraordinary Things, he was
look'dupon as infpir'd from Heaven 5 or if great mi-
raculous Things were wrought, it was faid imme-
diately to be from Heaven. Come pee a Man that
has told me all that ever I did^ fays the Woman of
Samaria^ [ohn iv. 2p. and it follows, is not this the
Chrift} fhe did not fay prefently this mufl be the
Devil. Never Man /pake like this Man ! fay the Mef^
fengers fent to apprehend Jefus Chrifl, and away
they came without him, flrook with awful Appre-
henfions, John vii.49. not concluding prefently that
it was the Devil, No Man could do thefe Miracles
that thou doejlj except God he with him^ John iii. 2.
he does not fay, no Man could do fuch Miracles as
thefe, but it mufl be the Devil, On the contrary,his
Conclufion is, We know by thefe Miracles, that thou
art a teacher fent from God, But now, if any thing
be done extraordinary, or faid furprizingly, it mufl
be the Devil 5 as if God had ceas'd to work, and all
Extraordinaries were committ-ed to the Devil.
Thus the Pertuis Roftan^ which is a wonderful
PafTage cut through a Mountain near Briangon^ on
the Frontiers of Dauphine^ ctll'd one of the five
Wonders of Dauphine^ is faid to be the Work of
the Devil y only becaufe the People have no Hiflory
recording the Time or Manner of its making, or by
who j and becaufe they think it pafl the Power of
Men's Hands: and the like of many Places, and
Things in England, But this is a DigrefSon.
The Poor Wench I am fpeaking of was fur-
priz'd very much at this Gentleman, and more af-
ter.
6% The Hifiory and Reality
ter he was gone, than before j for he did not give
her time before, to refle6t upon the Particulars he
mentioned to her, but following one thing with
another, he found her enough to do to take in the
heads of Things in the grofs.
But when he was gone, and flie came to refle6b,
and lay things together, ihc began to confider. Who
muft this be? How could he know fuch and fuch
things? How could he tell whofe Pifture that was J
Where my Miftrefs had fuch a Suit of Curtains,
and fuch a Cabinet ? Who muft he be, to tell me.
how long my Mafter has been at Jamaica^ how
much his Eftate is there, and how much Money he
has fent my Lady over, in fo and fo long time ?
This mult be the Devil in my Mafter's Cloaths, fome-
thing muft be in it, I'll go to my Lady, and let her
know it allj and wirh this the Maid gets a Wo-
man, that ufed to be trufted in fuch Cafes, to look
after the Houfe, and away fhe goes to to
her Miftrefs, without fo much as ftaying to drefs
her.
Indeed I think 'tis a part of the Story, that
the Gentleman dt^iY'di {he would acquaint her
Miftrefs with it 3 that fuch aPerfon had been there;
and gave her fome particular Tokens, by which he
faid her Miftrefs would underftand who he was;
and that ihe fhould tell her what he faid, that
her Income would not fupport the Expences
fhe liv'd at, but thaf it would bring her to Ruin,
and flie would be undone; but this Part I do not
pofitively remember ; but that he told the Maid it
would be fo, that I am particular in.
However, the poor Girl, the more fhe rumi-
nated upon the thing, the more fhe was frighted,
and diforder'd about it; and away fhe went, as I
have faid, to give her Lady an Account of it : and
fhe was the more eager to go alfo, becaufefhe under-»
ftood him, that he intended to wait upon her him-
fclf.

felf, to talk about the Lodgings 5 and fo fhe would
prepare her Lady to receive him, and to confider
what kind of a Man it muft be, that ihe might noc
be frighted at him: But he had been too quick for
the Maid.
When flie came to ihe found her Mi-
ftrefs thrown down upon the Bed very ill, and fo
ill, that at firft they told her flie could not fpeak
with her. Don't tell me, fays Mary^ (that is the
London Maid) I muft fpeak with her, and will fpeak
with her, for I have extraordinary Bufinefs with
her. What extraordinary Bufinefs can you have?
fays the Lady's Woman, taunting at herj if your
Bufinefs was from the Devil^ you can't fpeak with
my Lady juft now, for fhe is very ill, and laid
down upon the Bed.
From the Devil I fays Mary, I don't know but
it may, and I believe it is indeed, and I muft fpeak
with my Lady immediately.
Nay, fays the Woman^ here has been one Mef-
fenger too many from the Devil already, I think 5
fure you don't come of his Errand too, do ye?
I don't know whofe Errand I come of, but
\ am frighted out of my Wits 5 let me fpeak with
my Lady prefently, or I fhall die before I deliver
my MefTage.
Die! fays the TVoman: I wifh my Lady don't die
before fhe can hear it 5 pr'ythee Mary^ if it be any
thing to fright her, don't tell it her juft now, for
fhe is almoft frighted to Death already.
Why, fays Mary^ has my Lady feen any thing
?
A Y, ay : Seen ! fays the TVoman^ fhe has ^^txx

brought her fome dreadful Tidings, I don't know
what it is.
They talk'd this fo loud, or were fo near, that
the Lady heard fomething of it, and immediately
flie rung a Bell for her Woman.

When the Woman went in^ Who is that be*

in from London ?
Yes, Madam, fays her Womm^ here is Mar^
come to fpeak with your Ladyfhip.
MART come, fays Jhe, with a Surprize, what'i
the Matter ! what, has ihe feen any thing too ? mer-
cy on me, what's the Matter ! what does ihe fay ?
She does not fay much, Madam, fays the Wo-

Ladyfhip, and is in a great Hurry.
What, fays the Lady^ is fhe frighted ?
I BELIEVE (he is, fays the Wcman^ but fh(
won't tell any thing but to your felf.
O, I ihall die ! fays the Lady 5 call her up.
Pray Madam, fays her Woman^ don't call ho
up 'till your Ladyfhip has recover'd your fclf s
little from your other Diforders 5 {he'll tell you fom<
wild Tale or other of her own Imagination, tha^
will raife the Vapours, and do you a Mifchief.
O, fays the Lady^ let me hear it, let it be wha
it will J if it be from the Bevil^ it can't be worfi
than it is > call her up, I mull fpeak with her.
Accordingly Mary came up, and the Wo
man was order'd to withdraw.
A s foon as the Door was fhut, her Lady burfl
out into Tears again, for fhe had been crying ve-
hemently before. O Mary^ fays fie^ I have had 1

In a word, 'tis certain it was her Husband it

her his Eilate would not fupport her expcnfivc

ikT^i? 2" immediately ask'd her Ladyihip, what
manner he appear'd in> and by the Dcfcription that
iier Miftrefs gave, it was exadly the fame Figure
that came to her, and defired to fee the Lodgings 5
£q Mary gave her Lady a particular Relation of
what happen'd to her alio, and of the MeiTage flic
was charg'd to deliver.
What follow'd upon this Alarm, and how the
Lady was reduced, and obliged to fell her fine Fur-
niture and Equipage, and came to very low Cir-
cumftanccs, tho' it was a part of the Story, is not
fo much to my Purpofe in the Relation. But what
is remarkable to the Cafe in hand is, that they
alledge, that juft at this Jundurc Sir 7— O
—
ne^
the Lady's Husband, died in the f^efi- Indies : I fup-
pofe by his Death her Supplies were immediately
Hopped, and that was the Occafion of her being
reduced fo fuddenly.
Now the Apparition, and its appearing in the
Shape or Figure of the Husband, his warning her
of her approaching Circumfiances, and moving her
to abate her expenfive way of Liviug, and the like,
all this is agreeable to the Opinion I have already
given, that good Spirits may be allowed to aflume
humane Shape, and the Shape of any particular
Perfon, whether the Perfon be dead or livings and
may appear to us, to caution us in our wrong
Meafures, to warn us againft impending Mifchiefs,
and to direcb us in Difficulties. And how merciful
is it to Mankind, that there are fuch kind Moni-
tors at hand, at any time, for our good I
But that this muft be juft in the Article of
Death, juft when the Perfon was dying, and the
Soul departing i as if the Soul could ftay in ifi
Palfage, between Life, and the eternal State, to
calLat this, or that Place, and deliver a Meffage:
For

For Example > if it was to be carry 'd by the An-
gels into Abraham'^ Bofom, you muft fuppofe thofe

gers perform'd their Task 5 nay that he muft flop
at the London Houfe, afTume a Shape for that Pur-
pofe, talk about the moft frivolous things with
Mary the Servant Maid, and then go with another
formal Errand to—to his Wife, all this in his Journey 5
and having difpatch'd thefe more weighty Affairs,
then go on for Heaven afterwards.
This, I fay, has to me no Confiftency in it, no
Coherence, it does not hang together in my Opi-
nion at all, nor can I make any common Senfe of
it 5 no, not if I was to come to theoldpoetickFifti-
ons of Charon and his Ferry-Boatj even the old
Ferry-Man would not have Itept out of his Way,
'
upon any fuch Bufincfs.
What might be dene by the Agency of thofe
Spirits, appointed by the Great Lord of all Spirit,
to attend for the good of his Creatures, I have not
the leafl Objedion againfl>but that the Soul of the
Deceafed, or Departed, can come of this Errand ic
felf, that I deny, and mufl infifl upon it, that there
is neither Reafon or Religion in it, 'tis founded
wholly in the Imagination j and tho' the Imagina-
tion may not in this Cafe form the Apparition, yet
'tis evident the Imagination only appropriates it to
the Perfon, that is, to the Soul of the Perfon, who
has really no Share in the Operation.
Upon this Foundation likewife flands the old
Heathen Notion, taken from the Cafe of Achllki
and his Friend Patroclus^ that the Soul of the De-
ceafed cannot be at Refl, 'till he has come and given
Notice of fuch and fuch things; that Juflicc be
done to fuch and fuch injur'd Perfons; and Money,

Will of the Deceafed punftually performed: Tliefe
I take not to be imaginary but fi6bitious, and mad6
or fupplyed out of the Invention of the Relator, in
order to difli up the Story.
And this makes the Story of the Duke of
Buckingham''^ Father, of which mention has beeii
made already, be liable to fo many Exceptions :
That his Father could not red:, or his Soul could
not be at reft, becaufe of the wicked Life his Son
George liv'd at Court 5 That part muft certainly be
added by fome of the very very many Relators, or
who have call'd themfelves Relators of that Story ;
and my Lord Clarendon^ who (eems to have been the
1
moft exaft and judicious in the patting the whole
Story together, has none of that Paflage in his Ac*
count of it, as we fliall fee prefently.
Upon what Religious Foundation can we fug*
geft, that the Sins of the Children fhould difquiet
the Fathers in their Graves, or that the Souls de-
parted can receive any Impreflion from the Beha-
viour of thofe in Life, fubfequent to any Adiort
thofe Souls departed have been concern'd in ?
That they may be afFe6ted in a Future State
with the Wickednefs and Offences committed ill
their paft Life, that I will not doubt 5 tho' even
not that in fuch a manner, as to fend them back
hither upon any Errand about itj for all is irre*
trievable j as there is no Repentance, fo no Repa-
ration, there is neither l^ork nor Invention in ths
Gra^ej whither we are all going. The Soul may-
be in a State of Self-Refleftion and Reproach > but
not in a State of Rea6tion, no recovering for our
fclves, nor concern for others j 'tis all out of the
,Queftion, and all the Notices from the other fide
of the Curtain come from other Hands, whofe
Name foever they may fpeak in, or whofe Shape
foev'-er they may affurae.
T
74 "T^^ Hifiory and Reality
1am forc'd, how reluftant foever, to talk Scrip-
ture to my Readers, upon this nice part of the
Subjefb 5 whether they will lay any weight upon
it or no, be that to themfelves.
I INSIST upon it, that the Souls of the dead
can make no Vifits hither when once they are re-
moved j that when they are unembodied, difrob'd
of Flefli and Blood, they have no more concern
with or about us 5 fo as either to difturb their Reft
or ours j and this is plain to me, not only from the
Nature of the thing, from Reafon and Obfervati-
on 5 but from the Scripture. EccL \x. f. For the
Ji'ving know that they jhall die : hut the dead know noi
any things neither have they any more a Reward^ fot
the memory of them is fotgotten. This latter part re-
lates to their having any Reward or Concern ir
things here of this Life, no more Reward or Be-
nefit or Share of things here : But look into the
next words, ver. 6. Jlfo their love^ and their hatred,
and their envy is now perijhed-y neither have they an^
more a portion for ever in any thing that is done unde\
the Sun,
What can be plainer than this, if Scriptun
be of any moment among us ? if not, I can fa]
nothing to that. But I fay, what can be plainer
and what do thofe People mean who tell us a Ghof
or Spirit appear'd, and faid it could not be at Ref
'till it had come to do fo and fo, 'till it had difco-
ver'd fuch and fuch things, and 'till it had feen i
well perform'd ? \
If my Vote in this Cafe may be of any Value
or I may offer any thing by way of Direftion tc
V'eaker Heads 5 let them make this one thing
Chara6ter or Mark to know fuch things by, or tc
judge of them, viz. That when they meet wit!
any Story told in fuch a manner, they fhould con
elude it a fiftion, a cheat 5 that it is only a Srorj
Hiade by the Invention of Story-Makers, a Dclu
fioni
\

fion, and that no Spirit or Apparition really com-
ing upon any Meflage from the Invifible World,
ever talks after that manner 5 or that if they do 'tis
a Cheat of the Devil to carry on fome Delufion,
and to make fome Lye appear plaufible ; for that
there can be no reality in it^that's afferced as abovc^
,
The dead know not any things not any thing HEREy
but rhcir Love^ and their Hatred^ and their Envy is
perijhed.
W E have another Story to offer in this cafe,
which has been menrioifd, as if it were the A(5t
and Deed of the Perfon departed ; and in whofe
Name it was faid to be done, and who, as we may
fay, was perfonated in it. 1 fhall relate the Story
impartially as I receiv'd it, and let all the Advan-
tage that can be taken of it be made, I believe it
will not amount to any rational Conclufion, in Fa-
vour of Ithis Notion, that the Soul of the Perfon
deceafed is any way concerned in it, or in any part
of it.
This is the famous Story of the Apparition of
one James Haddock in Ireland^ which is publifh'd
many feveral ways, and that by feveral Authors j
and fome of them intimating that it was really the
departed Soul of James Haddock^ who could not be
at Reft, as fome of the Writers of the Story would
infinuate, becaufe his little Son by his Wife E-
leanor Welch yf^2& wrong'd in a Leafe left by him to
the Child 5 but kept from him by her fecond Hus-
band .
The abridg'd Story is this. In the Year \66t^
an Apparition meecs one Francis Taverner on the
Highway *, the Man having Courage to fpeak to it,
asks it what he is ? and the Apparition tells him
he is James Haddock^ and gives him feveral Tokens
to remember him by, which faverner alfo calling
to mind owns them j and then boldly demands of
the Apparition what bufinefs he had with him 5
T 2. the
zy6 "The H'tjlory and Reality
the Apparition did not tell his Bufinefs that Night j
but would have had "Taverner YodiC. back his way with
him, and he would tell him his Bufinefs, which
'Tavenier refus'd, as well he mighty and that part
indeed feems the only improbable part of the
Story.
However the next Night the Apparition
comes to him again, and then tells him the Bufi-
nefs, which was to defire him to go to his Wife,
whofe Maiden Name was Eleanor IVelJh-y but was
then marry'd again to one Davis^ which Davis
with-held the Leafe from the Orphan, Haddock^ Son,
and tell her fhe ihould caufe Juflice to be done to
the Child.
tAFERNER neglefted to perform this Er-
rand, and was fo continually foliow'd by the Ap-
parition, that it v/as exceeding terrible to him 5
arid at lafl it threatened to tear him in Peices, if he
did not go of his Errand.
Upon this he goes and delivers the MefTage to.
the Woman, who it feems took but fmall Notice
of it 5 and then the Apparition came again, and
told him he mufl go to his Executor, and do the'
fame Errand 5 which he was it feems afraid to do,
for fear of Davis -, but the Apparition threatened
Davis if he fhould attempt to do him {Ttaverner)
any Injury.
N. B. Here I am to Note^ that this Story made
fo much Noife in the Country^ and the Parti^

But for the reft, I think all the Notions that
the People then entertain'd of it, and even the Bi-
fhop among the reft, muft be very erroneous and ^
miftaken. For,
I. The Biftiop entertain'd the Story, as if this
Apparition was really the Soul of the departed
James Haddock^?L^ appearM by a fecond Examination
of 'faverner by his Lordftiip 5 for the Lady Cm-
way^ and other Perfons of Quality, hearing the
Bifhop had fent for T^averner to examine him, went
all away to be prefent at the Examination: And the
Bifhop being gone to a Town caird Hillshro^ three
Miles off, the Company went all thither, and fa-
verner was fent for to them, and there examin'd
of all the Particulars again, and anfwer'd again to
the Satisfadion of all the Company.
But here (and for this reafon I relate this part)
his Lordftiip, after asking many more Queftions,
concluded by advifing 'Taverner to ask the Appari-
tion when it came again, Whence are you, are you
a good or an evil Spirit? by which is fuppos'd his
Lordftiip underftood, Are you in a good or bad
State 3 for his next Qiieftion was. Where is your
Abode? what Station do you hold ? how are you
regimented in the other World? and what is the
Reafon that you appear for the Relief of your Son
T 3
in
%y% The Hijiory and Reality
in fo fmall a Matter, when fo many Widows and
Orphans are opprefs'd in the World, being de-
frauded of greater Matters, and none from thence
. of their Relations appear to right them ?
And the very fame Night 7'averner meeting
the Apparition again, who, it feems, was fully fa-
tisfy'd with what he had done in delivering the
Meflage to the Executor; at this Appearing 7'a^
verner ask'd him the Queftions above, but it gave
hini^no Anfwer 5 and indeed it could not be ex-
pe61:ed that Cuviofity fhould be anfwered.
For, as I faid above, it is evident by the
Queftions, the Bifliop, in all thefe Examinations,
fell in wr^h the vulgar Error of the Time about
fuch apparitions, namely, that it was the Soul of
James Haddock -y and well indeed might he ask how
he came to Appear, when others in Cafes of
greater Moment did not.
But he fhould have ask'd. How is it poflible
you that are dead fhould be acquainted with thefe
Circumftances, when the Word of God fays ex-
prefly the Dead know qot any thing, and that all
their Love and Hatred is perifhed ? Had he ask'd
him, that, perhaps he might have told him that he
was not the Soul o^James Haddock^ but a good Spiric
fent from the invifible World by the efpecial direfti-
on of Heaven, to right a poor, ruin'd, opprefs'd
Orphan, abandon'd to Injury by its own unnatural
Mother. But to talk of the Soul of James Had^
dock^ and what Station it held in the other World^
the Apparition might well go away, and give no
Anfwer to it.
Nor in any of this Difcourfe did the Appari*
tion pretend it was not at Reft, or could not be
at Reft 'till Juftice was done to the Child, or 'till
the MeiTage was deliver'd: the Apparition was too
jull to itfelf to fay'fo: and on the other Hand,
*tis to me one of the moft convincing Proofs, thac
it
of APPARITIONS. 17^
it was really an Apparition or Appearance of a
Spirit.
Now, as in other Cafes, what Spirit it was may
be worth taking Notice of 5 here is not the lead
room to fuggcft that it was the Devil^ or an evil
Spirit i and therefore the Bifhop was wrong in
that too, to ask if it was a good or evil SpiHtj for
how ihould his Wifdom judge, who was himfelf
a good Man, that an evil Spirit fhould come of 4
good Errand, to right an injured Orphan, an op- .
prefs'd Fatherlefs Child ? the Devil^ or any evil
Spirit, could hardly be fuppos'd to move about
fuch Bufinefs.
I T is to be obferv'd here, and fliould have bcei>
added to the Story, that the faid Davis and his
Wife, tho' it fcems much againfl: his Will, did
give up the Leafe to the Child, the Soi; of that
James Haddock 5 with this difmal Circumftance, at-
tending it, 1)1%. That about five Years after, and
-when the Bifliop was dead, one Coftlet^ who was
the Child's Truftee, threatned to take away the
Leafe again, raiPd at I'averner^ and made terrible
Imprecations upon himfelf if he knew of the Leafe,
and threatned to go to Law with the Orphan.
But one Night being drunk at the Town of Hill"
Hall^ near Lishurne in Ireland^ where all this Scene
was laid, going home he fell from his Horfe and
never fpoke more, and fo the Child enjoy'd the
Eflate peaceably ever after.
I N a Word, the little injur'd Orphan feem'd to
be the Care of Heaven in a particular manner;
and the good Angel which appcar'd in its behalf
without doubt executed God's Juftice upon the
wicked drunken Oppreflbr, the Trufteej and as
he imprecated Vengeance on himfelf, fo that fame x
Spirit might be Commiffion'd to fee it fall upon
him.
T 4 Ano
i8o The Hijlory and Reality
And here it mofl naturally occurs to obfervc
that the departed Souls of Men and Women dead
and buried, cannot be fuppos'd to have any Com-
miflion to execute particular Vengeance on any
in this World j the Suppofition of this would
bring a^ confus'd medly of Notions upon us, fuch
as would be inconfillcnt not with Religion only,
but even with common Senfej and which need
not take up any of our Pains to confute them.
Nothing has more fiU'd the idle Heads of
the old Women of thefe latter Ages than the
Stories of Ghofts and Apparitions coming to Peo-
ple, to tell them where Money was hidden, and
how to find it j and 'tis wonderful to me that
fuch Tales fhould make fuch Impreflions, and that
fometimes among wife and judicious People too,
as we find they have done. How many old Hou-
fes have been almoft puU'd down, and Pitts fruit-
lefly dug in the Earth, at the ridiculous Motion
of pretended Apparitions? of which I ihall fpeak
more in its Place.
I HAVE hitherto lludioufly avoided giving you
any Accounts, however extraordinary, that have
been already made publickj but this one, which
relates to the Afiaffination of the great Duke of
Buckingham^ (whether famous or infamous I know
not which to determine him) in the time of the
late King Charles I, I cannot omit, becaufe the va-
rious manner of its being related fo eminently
touches the Cafe in Hand.
That the Duke of Buckingham was flabb'd by
one Lieutenant Felton at Portfmouth^ as he was go-
ing upon an Expedition for the Relief of Rochelle^
Hiftory is fo full of it, and all that know any
thing of our Englijh Annals are fo well acquainted
"with the Story of it, that I need fay nothing to
introduce that Part: Mr. Aubrey takes upon him
to relate the Story of an Apparition upon this Oc-
eafion in the following manner
;
To
of APPARiriO NS. xSi
"To one Mr. Towes who had been School-fel-
low with Sir George Fillers^ the Father of the
firfl Duke of Buckingham^ and was his Friend
and Neighbour, as he lay in his Bed awake (and
it was Day-light) came into his Chamber the
Phantome of his dear Friend Sir George Viller's,
Said Mr. I'owes to him, Why, you are dead
!
what makes you here? Said the Knight, I am
dead, but cannot reft in Peace, for the Wicked-
nefs and Abomination of my Son George at Court.
I do appear to you to tell him of it, and to ad-
vife and dehort him from! his evil ways. Said
Mr. "Towes^ The Duke will not believe me, but
will fay that I am mad, or doat. Said Sir George
Go to him from me, and tell him by fuch
a Token (a Mole) that he had in fome fecrec
Place, which none but himfelf knew of Accord-
ingly Mr. 'I'o'wes went to the Duke, who laugh'd
at his Meffage. At his return home, the Phantome
appeared again, and told that the Duke would
be ftabb'd (he drew out a Dagger) a quarter of a
Year after > which accordingly happened.
This Part of the Story indeed is calculated like
a true Chimney-corner Piece of Newsj that Sir
George, who was dead, ihould fay he could not reft
in Peace for the Wickednefs and Abomination of
his Son George at Court.
Preposterous ! What State muft old Sir
George be in? If in a State of Mifery, what does he
mean by reJI^ing in Peace? if in a State of BlefTednefs,
what could his Son do to impeach his Reft? and i^c
we fhall give any weight to what the Scripture
fays in that Cafe, he knew nothing of him, let his
own State or his Sow\ Abominations (jxsht calls them)
be what they would. See Job xiv. ip, 20, 21. "The
waters wear the Stones : thou, wafloeft away the things
which grow out of the duft of the earthy and thou de-
firoyefi the hop of man, fhou prevaileft for ever againfi
ztt The Hifiory and Reality
MfH^ ^nd he pajfeth : thou changeft his countenance,,
mdfendeft him away. His fans come to honour^ and he
knoweth it not , and they are brought low^ but he pev"
(eiveth it not of them,
'Tis plain here that the Hope (that is the
Knowledge and Wifdom) of Man as to this World,
js deftroyed and wafh'd away in Death 5 his Sons
may rife or fall, be great or little, high or low,
good or evil, 'tis all one to him, he knows nothing
of it. How then could Sir George Fillers fay, feveral
Years after he was dead too, that he could not reft
in Peace ? What ! had he been at Reft and in Peace,
and was he difquieted again by his Son George'^s
Wickednefs? that does not hang together at all.
The old Knight had been dead feveral Years before
his Son George came to rife at Court j when he did
rife, he was not immediately fo abominably wicked
as he was afterward : Where then was the Soul of
Sir George the Father, all the while? his Reft could
not bedifturb'd 'till the Circutnftanccsthat difturb'd
it happen'd.
B u T my Lord Clarendon tells this fame Story,
with much more Probability of Truth j for
firft he leaves out the Abfurdity, which indeed his
Lordfhip was too wife a Man to impofe upon the
World with the SanSion of his Authority, nor
was there Senfe enough^ in it to give it Credit.
I N the next Place he does not make the Perfon
to whom Sir George Fillers appear'd, be an Equal,
and an Intimate Friend, but one that had liv'd in
the fame Town where Sir George had liv'd, and had
not feen him for many Years, but recollefted him
from the Cloaths he had feen him wearj whereas
the Story above makes them dear Friends, which
if it had been fo, it was not likely he fhould re-^
fufe to hear the Meflagc, ant yet he fcruples it
very much.
But

But there are more difcording Circumftances in
the Story. Let us take the Lord Clarendon's Re-
lation, which is done with an appparent Regard to
Truth, and is as follows
:
The Account ofthe Apparition ofSir George
V\\\Qrs>y relating to the Mtirther of the'Duke
of Buckingham his Son^ as taken from the
Lord ClarendonV Hifiory^ Vol. 1. Fo. 34,
35-. as follows:
6C
'' T H R R E were many Stories fcatter'd abroad at
that time of feveral Prophecies and Predidions
'' of the Duke's untimely and violent Death 5
'' amongft the reft, there was one which was up-
'^ on a better Foundation of Credit than ufually
*^ fuch Difcourfes are founded upon.
'' There was an Officer in the King's Ward-
'^ robe in Windfor-Cajikj of a good Reputatioti
*' for Honefty and Difcretion, and then about the
^' Age of fifty Years or more.
" This Man had in his Youth been bred in a
*^ School in the Parifti where Sir George Fillers^
'^ the Father of the Duke, iiv'd, and had been
*' much cherifli'd and obliged in that Seafon of
^' his Age by the faid Sir George^ whom after-
*' wards he never faw.
" xA B o u T ^\x Months before the miferable End
*^ of the Duke of Buckingham^ about Midnight,
*' this Man being in his Bed at JVindfor^ where his
^' Office was, and in very good Health, there ap-
" peared to him on the fide of his Bed, a Man
'' of a very venerable Afped, who drew the Cur-
*' tains of his Bed, and fixing his Eyes upon him,
*' ask'd him if heJ|aew him.
"The poor 4p^9 half dead with Fear and Ap-
^S prehenfion, being ask'd the fecond time, whether
" he
284 The Hiflory and Reality
*^ he remembred him, and having in that time
" called to his Memory the Prefence of Sir George
'^ Fillers^ and the very Cloaths he ufed to wear,
" in which at that time he feem'd to be h;^bited,
" he anfwer'd him. That he thought him to be
*'
that Perfon > he reply'd. He was in the right,
" that he was the fame, and that he expefted a
*' Service from him, which was, That he fliould
" go from him to his Son the Duke of| Buck-
^' inghatn^ and tell him, if he did not fomewhat to
*' ingratiate himfelf to the People, or at leaft to
" abate the extreme Malice which they had againft
*^ him, he would be fuffer'd to live but a fhorc
" time.
*' After this Difcourfe he difappear'd, and the
*' poor Man (if he had been at all waking) flept
*' very well 'till Morning, when he believed all
*' this to be a Dream, and confider'd it no other-
" wife.
''The next Night, or fhortly after, the fame
X cc
Perfon appeared to him again,|in the fame Place,
*' and about the fame time of the Nighr, with
" an Afpe£t a little more feverc than before, and
'^ asked him, Whether he had done as he had re-
" quired of him > and perceiving he had not, gave
*' him very fevere Reprehenfions, told him he ex-
*' pe6ted more Compliance from him, and that if
*' he did not perform his Commands, he fhould en*
*' joy no Peace of Mindj but fhould always be
" purfu'd by him: Upon which, he promifed him
''
to obey. But the next Morning, waking out of
'^ a good Sleep, tho' he was exceedingly perplex'd
*' with the lively Reprefentation of all Particulars
*' to his Memory, he was willing (till to perfuade
*^ himfelf that he had only dream'd, and confi-
" der'd that he was a Perfon^lt fuch a diftance
*' from the Duke, that he kx^mf not how to find
^' out any Admiffion to his Prefence, much lefs
'^ had
of APP ARiriO NS, i8f
" had any Hope to be believed in what he fhould
" fay y fo with great Trouble and Unquietnefs he
" fpcnt (bme time in thinking what he fhould do;
" and in the end refolved to do nothing in the
" matter.
"The fame Perfon appeared to him the thifd
" Time with a terrible Countenance, and bitterly
" reproaching him for not performing what he had
" promifed to do. The poor Man had, by this time,
" recover'd the Courage to tell him, that in Truth
" he had deferred the Execution of his Commands,
" upon confidering how difficult a thing it would
" be for him to get any Accefs to the Duke, ha-
" ying Acquaintance with no Perfon about him j
" and^if he fhould obtain Admiffion to him, he
" ihould never be able to perfuade him that he
" was fent in fuch a manner > that he ihould at
'' lead be thought to be mad, or to be fet oa
" and employ'd by his own, or the Malice of other
*^ Men to abufe the Duke i and fo he fliould be fure
" to be undone.
"The Perfon reply'd, as he had done before,
" that he fhould never find Refl 'till he fhould
" perform what he required, and therefore he were
'^ better to difpatch it 3 that the Accefs to his Son
" was known to be very eafie, and that few Men
'^ waited long for him j and for the gaining him
*' Credit, he would tell him two or three Parti-
" culars, which he charged him never to mention
^' to any Perfon living but to the Duke himfelf;
" and he fhould no fooner hear them but he fhould
" believe all the reft he fliould fayj and fo repeat-
" ing his Threats, he left him.
"In the Morning the poor Man, more confirm'd
*' by the lad Appearance, made his Journey to
" London^ where the Court then was 5 he was ve-
" ry well known to Sir Ralph Freeman^ one of the
" Mafters of Requefts, who had married a Lady

*' that was nearly ally'd to the Duke, and was himi
« fclf well received by him : To him this Man
" went, and tho' he did not acquaint him witJt
*' all the Particulars, he faid enough to let him
*' know there was fomething extraordinary in it|
«' at>d the Knowledge he had of the Sobriety and
" Difcrction of the Man, made the more Impreffiori
^' on him : He defircd that by his means he might
*' be brought to the Duke in fuch a Place and in
" fuch a Manner as fhould be thought fit, affirm-
^' ing that he had much to fay to him, and of"
*' fuch a Nature as would require much Privacy^
" and fome Time and Patience in the hearing.
''Sir Ralph promis'd he would fpeak firft with
" the Duke of him, and then he fhould under-
" ftand his Pleafurej and accordingly, the firft Op-
*' portunity he did inform him of the Reputation
*' and Honefty of the Man, and then what he de-
" fired, and of all he knew of the matter.
"The Duke, according to his ufual Opennefs
*' and Condefcenfion, told him, that he was the
" next Day early to hunt with the King 5 that

" where he fhould land by five of the Clock in the
" Mornings and if the Man attended him there at
" that Hour, he would walk and fpcak with him

"Sir Ralph carried the Man with him the
" next Morning, and prefented him to the Duke

" and walk'd afide in Conference near an Hour 3
" none but his own Servants being at that Hour
" in that Place 5 and they and Sir Ralph at fuch a'
" Diftance, that they could not hear a Word, tho'
" the Duke fometimes fpoke loud, and with great
*' Commotion, which Sir Ralph the more eafily
" obferv'd and perceived, becaufe he kept his Eyes
" always fix'd upon the Duke, having procur'd the

Besides the above-named clafhing Chxum-
ftances in the differing Relation of this Story, there
are one or two that are very material, as will ap-
pear by the following Remarks.
1. jlUB RET (2iys Mr. towes^ as he calls him,
went to the Duke, and told him the Token > not-
withftanding which, the Duke laugh'd at his Mef-
fage : whereas my Lord Clarendon tells juft the con-
trary, that the Duke gave him an open, tho' a very
particular Audience 5 all his Attendance keeping at a
diflance, and that he held him in that earneft Difcourfe
for an Hour.
2. j^UB RET fAySj the Token Sir George gave
to enforce or engage his Son's Attention, was, that
he (the Duke) had a Mole in fuch a private Part of
his Body 5 but my Lord fays, the Token given was
of fuch a Nature as the Duke fwore none but the
J)m/and onePerfon in the World could know, and
that he was fure that one Perfon would not fpeak of
it J and that the Duke was extremely difturbed when
he heard of it.
N.B. FJME^ tho'' with form Privacy^ fays^
that the fecret ^oken was an incefiuous Breach
of Modefiy between the Duke and a certain
Lady too nearly related to him^ which it fur*
prized the Duke to hear of\ and that as he
thought he had good Reafon to he fure the
Lady would not tell it of her felf^ fo he thought
none but the Devil could tell it beftdes her > and
this afionifoed him^ fo that he was very far
from receiving the Man fightly^ or laughing,
at his Mejfage.
What this Apparition then was, and from
whom, or from whence, remairs to be decided. That
the thing was real, is too well attefted 5 it comes
loaded
of APPARITIONS. i8p
loaded with fo many concurring Circumflances,
and told in the hearing of fo many Witnefles of
good Fame and Credit, that there is no Room
to quellion the Fad 5 and as to the various Ways
of relating it, the Truth of the whole is not a-
batcd by it at all : only as is natural to things of
this Nature which pafs thro' fo many Hands, eve-
ry one exprefling themfelves their own way, tho*
meaning the fame things they often vary at iaft in
the very Subftance, by only varying at firfl in the
Circumftances.
The Truth of the Matter is at lafl, that the
Apparition foi*etold his Ruin, and it foon follow'd*.
Now that this Apparition could not be the Devily
is evident from the Reafons laid down before in
the like Cafes. How can we fuppofe the Devil
would be offended with the wicked Life and abo-
minable Pra6tices of the Duke of Buckingham ac
Court? His inceftuous Lewdnefs, and whatever o-
ther fcandalous Praftices he allowed himfelf in, the
Devil might, perhaps, encourage and prompt him
to, but he would never fend a Meflenger to him
to warn him againft them, and to alarm him with
Apprehenfions of Danger attending him if he did
not reform. This is none of the Devil's Bufinefs,
'tis quite foreign to him, 'twould be the weakeft
thing in the World to fugged it of him.
Again, if it were any thing immediately from Hea-
ven, it would have been efFedual to have awaken*d
and reformed him : But as it might be a kind MefTen-
ger from another part of the invifible World, where
his approaching Fate was known, and who having
given him this Notice, left his Reformation in his
own Power, and laid the Neceffity of it before the
Eyes of his Reafon, as well as of his Confcience,
and that after this his Fall was of himfelfj this
makes it all rational, and eafie to be underftood, and
« agreeable to the ordinary Cuftom of Providence
U ia
ipo The Hijiory and Reality
in like Cafes, of which many Examples might b0
given in the World.
Nor is it ftrange, that the Apparition fhould
perfonate the old deceafed Father of the Duke, and
affume his Shape, to add as it were a Solemnity to
theMeflage, and give it a greater Influence upon thd
Mind of the Duke> and the fame MefTenger might
have aflumed any other Shape or Perfon if it had
thought fit, whether living or dead.
B u T if the Shape alTumed was the moil likely
to give Weight to the Errand it was to be fent a*'
bout, we are not to woncTer at all that a Spirit cm-
ploy'd, or employing it felf on an Errand of fuch
Importance, fhould be able to fingle out fuch Ap-
pearances, or fuch Shapes and Perfons to appear iii
the Figure of, as were apteft to enforce the Mef*
fagc. Thewell-chufing the Perfon is to me a Tefti-
mony for, not againlt the Goodnefs, the Judgment
and Capacity of the perfonating Spirit, and would
with juft reafoning confirm to us the validity of the
Meflage, and of the Meflenger alfo.
A^3b yet 'tis very reafonable to believe, that Sir
"George Fillers^ thus feeming to appear, and whofe
Surface or Gut-fide is put on like a Mafquerade
Habit upon this Occafion, knew nothing of it, and had
no manner of concern in it. Nothing is more won-
derful in any part of the Story to me, than that
Men of Senfe and Learning, as fome fuch have been,
could be prevailed upon, or rather could prevail
upon themfelves, to publifh to the World fuch in-
congruous, fuch irrational things as thcfe 5 that a Man
dead, perhaps twenty Years before, I think it's fo
much at lead > ihould appear, and fay, he could not
jfeft in Peace for fuch and fuch thmgs. And in ano-
ther of the fame Author's Stories, an Apparition is
brought in appearing to Dr. Turbervilk's Sifter, be-
ing a Lady who was dead, and had left fome Chil-
dren to her Husband, which Children were injur'd
7 ^y
of APPA R IT IONS. i^i
by a fecond Wife, Gontrafy to the Settlement of
the firft Wife's Marriage > and this Settlement of the
firfl: Marriage was it Teems hid behind the Wain-
fcot, in fuch and fuch a Place, which no body
knew of but the Children's iMother, that is to fay
the firll Wife. This Lady appeared to difcova*
where this Writing lay, and tells the Perfon to
whom fhe difcover'd it, that 'till fli^ had made this
Difcovery, fhc had wander'd in the Air, but that
now fhe was going to God.
Strange! that Mr. Glanvil, Juhrey^ and o-
thers, could publifh fuch a Story as this, without
fome juft Enquiries to reconcile it to common
Senfe, as well as to Religion} as particularly how
long this Lady had been Dead j for it feems to have
been fome Years, the Husband being married again,
and the Children being in danger of being wrong'd
by the Children of the fecond Venter.'^ Now, did
the Soul of the firft Lady wander all that while in
the Air, to fee whether there Chould be any oc-^
cafion for her, to vindicate her Children's Rights
or no? did fhe ftay from going to God all that
while, only for difcovering a conceal'd Deed, that
lier Children might not be wrong'd } how ihall wc
make fuch a thing out to be rational ? what No*-
tions of Religion or of a future State will fup*
port it?
Why did {he not immediately difcover where
the Deed, or Marriage Settlement lay, and put ix
into the Hands of fome honeft People, in Truft fot
her Children ? and then fhe had not need to have

They muft have ver|^low-priz'd Thoughts of
Heaven, and of going to God, after the departing
or feparating of the Soul from the Body in Life,
who think the PafTage can be interrupted by any of
the Affairs of this Life left unfinifh'd. If even out
Repentance enfinifh'd, our Peace with God unfi*

2 91 The Hifiory and Reality
nifh'd, can never be retreiv'd, if Time is not to be
recalled J buc that as the free falh^ fo it Jhall lie:
Shall we pretend the Soul fhall be flopped and in-
terrupted in its PafTage, to retrieve the Injuftice and
Violence done to the Orphans, or Relicls of the
Family ? fhall the Soul be brought back to find out
old hidden ParchmentSjOr as it is pretended in other
like Stories, to dig up old long-buried Money, and
the like?
No, no 5 thofe things fhould be done in time
:
like Repentance, they fhould not be left to that
Hazards for we may depend, there is no Work, or
Device, or Invention in the Grave, whither we are
all going.
That there are inviflbe Agents, which in Pur-
fuance of the Government of Providence in the
World, may be made Inftruments, to a6b in fuch
Cafes as thefe j to difcover Writings which being
conceal'd may ruin Families, rob and plunder Or-
phans, and diflreft the right Heirs of Eflates, and
in many like Cafes, this need not bedeny'd, and is in-
deed not to be difputedj and 'tis a glorious Tefti-
mony to the Jullice of Providence, that in fuch
Cafes he does not abandon the Widows and the
Orphans, who for want of lofl or conceaPd Deeds,
are fometimes in Danger of being undone, by Vio-
lence and Rapine. But all this is eafier to be un-
derftood to be done without Interruption of the
ordinary Courfe of Things, without obflru6ting the
Soul's PafTage into its determined flate of Happi-
nefs or Mifcry 5 which it mull be the weakeft, and
indeed the wickcdefl thi^g ip the World, to think
can be diverted by thd^ Trifles j and whofe di-
rect Progreflion is plainly flated in the Scripture in
thefe Words : // is appointed unto all Men once to die^
and after Death to Judgment-, or immediately after
Death to Judgment, at Icafl fo as nothing to prevent or
intervenes Heb, ix. zj. It is appointed^ and furely
thefe;
of APPARITIONS. ip3
tbefe things can never break in upon that folemn
Appointment:
Besides, 'tis an evident Impeach naent of the
Power and Juftice, as well as the Wifdom of Pro-
vidence, in his Difpofition of things, as if he could
not find out Ways to do right to injured Orphans,
or to dete6t the Injuftice and Oppreffion of violent
and unreafonable Men, but the Soul of the depart-
ed Mother muft be kept out of Heaven to do it her
(d^. Horrid Abfurdity ! and inconfiftent with all
the Notions that true Religion has infpir'dus with,
relating to a Future State, and to the Gulph that is
fix'd bctwcn this and that.
The Soul can no more be kept out from, or
delayed its Entrance into Heaven, if its Portion be
appointed for Happinefs, by any Concern for the
Affairs of this World, than it can be difquieted af-
ter it is entered thofe Realms of Peace, and didurbed
or brought back from thence upon any Accounc
whatfoever.
The very thoughts of it are fo mean, fo low-
rated and bafe, that 'tis unworthy of our Rea-
fon, but efpecially of our Chriftian reafoning Pow-
ers, to entertain them. I take this Abfurdity in-
deed to be much of the Caufe of that juft Ridicule,
which the wifer Part of Mankind have put upon
moil of the Stories which are told among us about
Witchcraft and Apparitions j for that they are
told with fuch evident Inconfiftences, that they
cannot go down with rational People: Who can
believe what cannot be true? who can make a feri-
ous thing of a piece of ridiculous Nonfenfe ? That
a Soul difmifs'd from Life, and going diredly into
Heaven, fhall be call'd back by the Cry of the
Children after her, with a hold! ftay Mother! come
hack^ and come and tell us where the Writings are for
your Joynture^ or we Jhall be undone? and the poor
Mother, Uncas'd, Unembodied, muft come back,
U }
difmifs
2p4 ^^ Hijlory and Reality
difmifsthe Angels that were carrying her intoJhra^
ham's Bofom, and bid them come for her another
time 3 and here {he muft hover about we know not
how many Years, to do Right to thefe Children.
Sure the fame Power that could thus interrupt her
Paflage into Heaven, might have prevented her fe-
paratjng from the Body, and {he might with as
much cafe, and lefs injuftice to her felf, have beeii
kept out of the Grave, as kept put of Heaven.
But I am fick of the very Repetition 5 the Dcr
lufion is fo grofs, I fay it is not to be wondered
that we are fhock'd by it in our belief of the thing
caird Apparition in general. The ridiculous Par^
difcredits the real Parr, and it being fo fufeiting to
our Reafon to hear the firft Part, we throw off our
Patience, and will hear nothing at all of it.
It is true we fhould not do thus 5 the Reality of
the Thing, abftraded from thefe diftrafted aqd en-
thufiaftick Notions,is not leflcn'd : 'tis our Bufinefs
then to rejeft the foolifli Parr, which indeed has
almoft fmother'd and buried the reft in its Duft and
Rubbifli, and let us judge rightly of things jis they
are. There is no want of Examples, where (Provi-
dence permitting) Apparition has made Difeove-
ities of villainous and diftioneft A6iions and Defigns
;
detefted Violence and Murther, done Right to in-
jured and opprefs'd Widows, and Fatherlefs Chil-
dren j and this without fuch a monftrousandincon-
fiftent Additionjas that of bringing back the Soul froni
its Entrance into Heaven, or difturbing its Reft and
Peace in a future State: things too grofs to be fo
much as nam'd among Chriftians, whofe Faith in
things Future is too well eftablifti'd to be capable
of receiving any Impreffions from fuch Delufions.
Ihave an Example in Srory very particular
to this Cafe ; and which my Author aftlires me of
the Truth of, rho* never yet publifti'd in Print;
Th€ Story is told of the late Reverend Dr. Scot^ a
Man
.Fa^/. 'i/^/; s':/ •'/''•//,u'/u
of A P P ARITI NS. zp^
Man whofe Learning and Piety was eminent, and
whofe Judgment was known to be (o good, as not
to be eafiiy impofed upon.
The Doftor, as I have the Story related, was
fitting alone by the Fire, either in his Study or
his Parlour,in Broadfireet where he liv'd,and reading
a Book, his Door being fhut faft and lock'd>he was
well alTur'd there was no body in the Room buc
himfelf, when accidentally raifing his Head a little,
he was exceedingly furpriz'd to fee fitting in an
Elbow Chair, at the other fide of the Fire-place or
*"
Chimney, an Antient grave Gentleman in a black
Velvet Gown, a long Whig, and looking with a
pleafing Countenance towards him {the DoUor) as
if juft going to fpeak.
N. B. Another Perfon relating this Story^ fays
the Antient Gentleman appear''d ftanding^ and
having jufl opened the Door of the Doctor's
Study^ he was come in 5 and fainting the DoHor
fpoke fir
ft to him : but the Difference is but
Jmall.
The Relations agree in this part, that the
Dodor was greatly furpriz'd at the fight of him 5 and
indeed the feeing him as fitting in a Chair was the
mofl likely to be furprizing 5 becaufe the Do6tor
knowing the Door to be lock'd, and then feeing a
Man fitting in the Chair, he muft immediately and
at firfl fight conclude him to be a Spirit, or Appa^
rition, or i)m/, call it as you will 5 whereas fee-
ing him come in at the Door, he might at firfl
fight fqppofe him to be really a Gentleman come to
fpeak with him, and might think he had omitted
faftning the Door, as he intended to have done. I
But be it which of the two it will, the Do-r
6bor appeared in great diforder at the fight, as he
acknowledg'd to thofe to whom he told the Story,
and from whom I received this Account, with very
little remove of Hands between.
U4 T«E
z^6 The Hijiory and Reality
The Spe6i:re it feems began, for the Doftor
had not Courage at firft, as he faid, to fpeak to it -y
I fay the Spedtre or Apparition fpoke firft, and
defir'd the Do6lor not to be frighted, not to be
furpriz'd, for that he would not do him any hurt >
but that he came to him upon a Matter of great
Importance to an injur'd Family, which was in
great danger of being Ruin'dj and that tho' he (the
JDoftor) was a Stranger to the Family, yet know-
ing him to be a Man of Integrity, he had pitch'd
upon him to do an acb of very great Charity, as
well as Juftice^ and that he could depend upon him
for a pun6tual Performance.
The Doftor was not at firft composed enough
to receive the Introduftion of the Bufinefs with a
due attention 5 but feem'd rather inclined to get
out of the Room if he could, and once or twice
made fome Attempt to knock for fome of the Fa-
mily to come up, at which the Apparition appear'd
a little difpleas'd.
But it feems he need not 5 for, as' the Do6i:or
faid, he had no power to go out of the Room if"
he had been next the Door, or to knock for Help
if any had been at hand.
But here the Apparition feeing the Dodtor ftill
in Confufion, defir'd him again tocompofe himfelf,
for he would not do him the lead Injury, or offer
any thing to make him uneafic 3 but defir'd that he
would give him leave to deliver the Bufinefs he
came about, which when he had heard, perhaps he
would fee lefs caufe to be furpriz'd or apprehenfive
than he did now.
B Y this time, and by the calm way of Difcourfe
above mention'd, the Doctor recovered himfelf fo
much, tho' not with any kind of Compofure, as to
fpeak.
I N the Name of God, fays the Do^or, what
art thou ?
J
of APPARITIONS. x^y
I DESIRE you would not be frighted, fays the
Apparition to him again j I am a Stranger to you,
and if I tell you my Name, you do not know it 3
but you may do the Bufinefs without enquiring.
The Do6bor continued ftill difcompos'd and
uneafic, and faid nothing for fome time.
The Apparition fpokc again to him not to be
furpriz'd, and receiv'd only for Anfwer the old ig-
norant Qucftion,
I N the Name of God,what art thou ?
Upon this the Spe6tre feem'd difpleas'd, as if
the Doftor had not treated him with Refpe6t5 and
expoftulated a little with him, telling him he could
have terrify'd him into a Compliance, but that he
chofe to come calmly and quietly to him 5 and ufed
fome other Difcourfes, fo civil and obliging, that by
this time he began to be a little more Familiar, and
at length the Dodor. ask'd,
What is it you would have with me?
At this the Apparition, as if gratify'd with the '
Queftion, began his Story thus.
I liv'd in the County of
/ do not exadily remember the County he named j
hut it was in fome of the Wefern Counties of
England,
where 1 left a very good Eftatc, which myGrand-
fon enjoys at this time. But he is fued for the Pof-
feflionby my two Nephews,the Sons of my younger
Brother.
N. B. Here he gave him his own Name^ the
Name of his younger Brother^ and the Names of
his two Nephews > hut I am not allowed to
puhliff the Names in this Relation^ nor might
it he proper for many Reafons.
Here the Do6bor interrupted, and ask'd him
how long the Grandfon had been in PofTeflion of
the Eftatej which he told him was Years,
intimating that he had been fo long dead.
Then
^a% The Hifiory and ReaFtty
Then be went on, and told him, that his Ne-
phews would be too hard for his Grandfon in the
Suit, and would OUT him of the Manlion-Houfe
and Eftate j fo that he would be in danger of being
entirely ruin'd, and his Family be reduc'd.
Still the Doftor could not fee into the Mat'
tcr, or what he could do to help or remedy the
Evil that threaten'd the Family 5 and therefore ask'd
him fome Queftions : for now they began to be ^
little better acquainted than at firft.
S ATS the Do^oY^ And what am I able to do in
it, if the Law be againft him?
Why, y^jVJ the SpeUve^ it is not that the Ne-
phews have any Rights but the grand Peed of
Settlement, being the Conveyance of the Inherit
tancc, is loft j and for want of that Deed they will
ppt be able to make out their Title to the Ellate.
'Well, fays the Do^or^ ^nd ftill what can I
do in the Cafe?
Why, fays the Spe5ire, if you will go down to
my Grandfon's Houfe, and take fuch Perfons with
you as you can truft, I will give you fuch In-
ftruftions as that you ihall find out the Deed or
Settlement, which lies concealed in a Place where
I put it with my own Hands, and where you fhall
direa my Grandfon to take it out in your Pre-
fence.
But why then can you not direct your Grand-
fon himfelf to do this? fays the Doctor.
Ask me not about that, fays the Apparition -y
there are divers Reafons which you may know
hereafter. I can depend upon your Honefty in it,
in the mean time 5 and I will fo difpofe Mat-
ters that you (hall have your Expences paid you,
and be handfomely allow'd for your Trouble.
After this Difcourfe, and feveral other Ex-
poftulations, (for the Do6bor was not eafily prevailed
upon to go 'till the Spefibre feem'd to look angrily,
and
of APP ARITIO NS. 2pp
^ndeven to threaten him for refufing,) he did at kfl:
Promife him to go.
Having obtain'd a Promife of him, he told
Iiim he might let his Grandfon know that he had
formerly convers'd with his Grandfather, (but not
how lately, or in what Manner,) and ask to fee
the Houfej and that in fuch an upper Room or
Loft, he ihould find a great deal of old Lumber,
old Coffers, old Chefts, and fuch Things as were
out of Fafhion now, thrown by, and pii'd up upon
one another, to make room for more niodifh Fur-
niture, Cabinets, Chefts of Drawers, and the like.
That in fuch a particular Corner was fuch a
certain old Cheft, with an old broken Lock upon
it, and a Key init,wbich could neither be turn'd in
the Lock, or pulled oijt of ic.
N. B. Here he gave him a particular Defcriptioj%
of the Chefts ard of the Outfidey the Lock and
the Cover^ and alfo of the Infide^ and of a pri--
vate place in ity which no Man could come to^
or find euty unlefs the whole Chefi was. pulVd in
Pieces,
In that Cheft, fays he^ and in that place, lyes
the grand Deed, or Charter of the Eftate, which
conveys the Inheritance, and without which the
Family will be ruin'd, and tqrn'd out of Doors.
After this Difcourfe, and the Doftor pror
mifing to go down into the Country and difpatch
this important Commiflionj the Apparition putting
on a very pleafant and fmiling Afpeft, thank'd him,
^nd difappear'd.
After fome Days, and within the time limit?
ed by the Propofal of the Spcdre, the Dodtor
went down accordingly into fhire 3 and find-
ing the Gentleman's Houfe very readily, by the
Diredion, knocked at the Door, and ask'd if he
was at home; and after being told he was, and the
Servants telling their Mafter ic,was a Clergyman, the
Gentleman
300 The Hijiory and Reality
Gentleman came to the Door, and very courteoufly
invited him in.
After the Do6tor had been there fome time,
he obferv'd the Gentleman receiv'd him with an
iinexpeded Civility, tho' a Stranger, and without
Bufinels : They enter'd into many friendly Difcour-
fes, and the Do6tor pretended to have heard much
of the Family, (as, indeed, he had) and of hi
Grandfather 5 from whom, Sir, fays he, 1 perceive
the Eftate more immediately defcends to yourfelf.
A Y, fays the Gentleman, and ihook his Head, my
Father died young, and my Grandfather has left
Things fo confus'd, that for want of one princi-
pal Writing, which is not yet come to Hand, I
have met with a great deal of trouble from a
couple of Coufins, my Grandfather's Brother's
Children, who have put me to a great deal of
Charge about it. And with that the Doftor feem-
ing a little inquifitivc.
But I hope you have got over it, Sir? fays he,
N o truly, fays the Gentleman, to be fo open with
you, we fhall never get quite over it unlcfs wc
can find this old Deed 5 which, however, I hope
we fhall find, for I intend to make a general Search
for it.
I WISH with all my Heart you may find ir,
Sir, fays the Do^or.
I don't doubt but I fhall 5 I had a flrange
Dream about it but laft Night, fays the Gentle*
man,
A Dream about the Writing ! fays the DoEior^
I hope it was that you fhould find it then ?
I D R E A M ' D, fays the Gentleman^ that a flrangc
Gentleman eame to me, that I had never {tQ,\\ m
my Life, and help'd me to look it. I don't know
but you may be the Man.
1 SHOULD be very glad to be the Man, I am
fure, fays the Dotlor,
Nay,
of APPARITIONS. 301
Nay, fays the Gentleman^ you may be the Man
to help me look it.
A Y, Sir, fays the DoBor^ I may help you look
it indeed, and Til do that too with all my Heart;
but I wou'd much rather he the Man that ihould
help you find it : Pray when do you intend to
make a fearch ?
To-MORRow, fays the Gentleman^ I had ap-
pointed to do it.
But, fays the DoElor^ in what manner do you
intend to fearch?
Why, fays the Gentleman^ 'tis all our Opinions
that my Grandfather was fo very much concerned
to preferve this Writing, and had fo much Jealou-
fy that fome that were about him would take it
from him if they could, that he has hid it in fome
fecret Place 5 and Fm refolv'd I'll pull half the
Houfe down but I'll find it, if it be above Ground*
Truly, fays the DoBor^ he may have hid ic
fo, that you muil: pull the Houfe down before you
find it, and perhaps not then either. I have known
fuch things utterly loft, by the very Care taken to
preferve them.
I F it was made of fomething the Fire wou'd not
deftroy, fays the Gentleman^ I'd burn the Houfe
down but I'd find it.
I SUPPOSE you have fearch'd all the old Gen-
tleman's Chefts, and Trunks, and Coffers over and
over ? fays the DoBor.
A Y, fays the Gentleman^ and turn'd them all in-
(idc outward, and there they lie of a heap up iri
a great Lofr, or Garret, with nothing in them j
nay, we knock'd three or four of them in Pieces
to fearch for private Drawers, and then I burnt
them for Anger, tho' they were fine old Cyprefs
Chefts, that coft Money enough when they were
in Fafhion.
I ' M forry you burnt them, fays the DoElor,
Nay,
301 The Hijiory and Reality
NaV, fays the Gentkmorn^ I did not burn a fcrap
of them 'till they were all fplit to Pieces 5 and ic
was not poffible there cou'd be any thing there.
N. B. ^his made the Do5ior a little eafy, for he
began to be furpriz'd when he told him he had
fplit fome of them out^ and burnt them.
Well, ^\x^ fays the DoUor^ if I can do you
atiy Service in your Search, I'll come and fee you
again to-morrow, and wait upon your Search with
my good Wiflies.
Nay, fays the Gentleman^ I don't defign to part
v/ith you J
fince you are (o kind to offer me your
Help, you fhall flay all Night then, and be at the
firft of it.
The Do6tor had now gain'd his Point fo far
as to make himfelf acquainted and defirable in the
Houfe, and to have a kind of Intimacy j fo that
tho' he made as if he would go, he did not want
in uch Entreaties to make him ftayj fo he confcnted
to lie in the Houfe all Night.
A LITTLE before Evening the Gentleman ask'd
him to take a Walk in his Park, but he put it off
with a Jefl> I had rather. Sir, faid he fmiling^
you'd let me fee this fine old Manfion Houfe that
is to be demoliih'd to-morrow j methinks I'd fain
fee the Houfe once, before you pull it down.
With all my Heart, fays the Gentleman. So he
carry'd him immediately up Stairs, fhew'd him all
the bed Apartments, and all his fine Furniture and
Pi6lures> and coming to the Head of the great
Srair-Cafe where they came up, offer'd to go down
again.
B u T, Sir, fays the Do6lor^ fhall we not go up
higher?
There's nothing there, fays he^ but Garrets
and old Lofts full of Rubbifh, and a Place to go
out into the Turret, and the Clock-houfe.
O
»f APPARiriO NS. 303
O, LET me fee ic all, rtow we are a going, fays
the Dadlor. I love to fee the old lofty Towers and
Turrets, the Magnificence of our Anceitors, the'
they are out of Faihion now 5 Pray let us fee all,
now we are going.
Why, it will tire you, fays the Gentleman,
N o, no, fays the Do6lor^ if it don't tire you that
have feen it fo often, it won't tire me, I afTure
you: Pray let us go up. So away the Gentleman
goes, and the Dodor after him.
After they had rambled over the wild Part
of an old-built great Houfe, which I need not de-
fcribe, he pafles by a great Room, the Door of
which was open, and in it a great deal of old Lum-
ber: And what Place is this, pray? fays ths DoUor^
looking in at the Door, but not offering to go
in.
Of T H A t's the Room, fays the Gentleman foftly^
hecaufe there was a Servant attending them, that's the
Room I told you of, where all the old Rubbifli
lay, the Chefts, the Coffers, and the Trunks > look
there, fee how they are pil'd up upon one ano-
ther almoft to the Ceiling.
With this the Dodor goes in and looks about
himj for this was the Place he was dire6fced to,
and which he wanted to fee: He was not in the
Room two Minutes but he found every thing jufl:
as the Spe6l:re at London had defcrib'd, went di-
reftly to the Pile he had been told of, and fixes
his Eye upon the very Cheft with the old rufty
Lock upon it, with the Key in it, which would
neither turn round, nor come out.
O N my Word, Sir, fays the Doctor, you have
'taken Pains enough, if you have rumag'd all thefe
Drawers, and Chefts, and Coffers, and every thing
that may have been in them.
Indeed, Sir, fays the Gentleman, I have emptied
every one of them myfelf, and look'd over all the
old
304 T^^ Hifiory and Reality
old mufty Writings one by one 5 with feme help,
indeed 3 but they, every one, pafl thro' my own
Hand, and under my Eye.
Well, Sir, fays theDoUor^ I fee you have been
in earneft, and I find the thing is of great Con-
fequence to you : I have a ftrange Fancy come in-
to my Head this very Moment 3 will you gratify
my Curiofity with but opening and emptying one
fmall Cheft or Coffer that I have call my Eye up-
on? there may be nothing in it, for you are fatis-
fy'd, 1 believe, that I was never here before j but
1 have a ftrange Notion that there are fomc pri-
vate Places in it which you have not found j per-
haps there may be nothing in them, when they arc
found.
The Gentleman looks at the Cheft fmiling, I
remember opening it very well 5 and turning to his
Servant, WilU M^ ke^ don't you remember that
Cheft? Yes, Sir, fays H^ill^ very well, I remember
you were fo weary you fat down upon the Cheft
when every thing was out of it, you clap'd down
the Lid and fat down, and fent me to my Lady
to bring you a Dram of Citron j you faid you were
fo tir'd you was ready to faint.
Well, Sir, 'twas only a Fancy of mine, and
very likely to have nothing in it.
'T I s no matter for that, fays the Gentleman^ you
ihall fee it turn'd bottom up again before your
Face, and fo you fhall all the reft, if you do but
fpeak the Word.
Well, S\y^ fays the Doctor^ if you will oblige
me but with that one, V\\ trouble you no far-
ther.
Immediately the Gentleman caufes the
Coffer to be drag'd out, and open'dj for it would
not be lock'd, the Key would neither lock it nor
unlock it : when the Papers were all out, the Do-
ftor turning his Face another way, as if he would
look
of APPARITIONS. joy
look among the Papers, but taking little or no
Notice of the Cheft, floop'd down, and as if fup-
porting himfelf with his Cane, chops his Cane in-
to the Cheft, but fnatcht it out again haftily, as
if it had been a Miftake, and turning to the Cheft
he claps the Lid of it down, and fits down upon
it, as if he was a weary too.
However he takes an Opportunity to fpeak
to the Gentleman foftly, to fend away his Man a
Moment 5 for I wou'd fpeak a Word or two with
you, Sir, fays he^ out of his hearing 5 and then re-
coUecbing himfelf. Sir, fays he aloudy can you not
fend for a Hammer and a Chifel ?
Yes, Sir, fays the Gentleman, Go, Will^ fays hs
to his Man^ fetch a Hammer and Chifel.
As foon as Will was gone. Now, Sir, yS^yj he^
let me fay a bold Word to you ; I have found your
Writings I have found your Grand Deed of Set-
tlement > ril lay you a hundred Guineas I have it
in this Coffer?
The Gentleman takes up the Lid again, han-
dles the Cheft, looks over every Part of it, but
could fee nothing ; he is confounded and amaz'd
!
What d'ye mean.^ fays he to the Do^tor^ you have
no unufual Art I hope, no Conjuring in hand|
here's nothing but an empty Coffer?
Not! upon my Word, fays the DoBor^ I am
no Magician^ no Cunning- Man^ I abhor ic> but I
tell you again the Writing is in this Coffer.
The Gentleman knocks, and calls as if he was
frighted, for his Man with the Hammer, but the
Dodor fat compos'd again upon the Lid of the
Coffer.
At laft up comes the Man with the Hammer
and Chifel, and the Dodor goes to work with
the Cheft, knocks upon the flat of the Bottom j
Hark ! fays he, don't yon hear it^ Sir^ fays he, don't
you bear it plainly ?
X Hear
30^ The Hiftory and Reality
Hear what? fays the Gmtkman. 1 don't undcr-
ftand you, indeed.
Why the Cheft has a double Bottom, Sir, a
^^X^t'^Qiiomj fays the Da6lor -, don't you hear it found
ht)llow?
I N a Word, they immediately fplit the inner
Bottom open, and there lay the Parchment fpread
abroad flat on the whole breadth of the Bottom
of the Trunk, as a Quire of Paper is laid on the
fiat of a Drawer.
I T is impofHble for me to defcribe the Joy and
Surprize of the Gentleman, and foon after of the
whole Family 5 for the Gentleman fent for his La-
dy, and two of his Daughters, up into the Garret
among all the Rubbifh, to fee not the Writing
only, but the Place where it was found, and the
Manner how.
You may eafily fuppofe the Do£i:or was carefs'd
with uncommon Civilities in the Family, and fent
tip (after about a Week's flay) in the Gentleman's
own Coach to London. I do not remember whe-
ther he difclos'd the Secret to the Gentleman, or
no 5 1 mean the Secret of the Apparition, by which
the Place where the Writing was to be found, was
difcover'd to him, and who oblig'd him to comQ
down on purpofe to find it : I fay, I do not remem-
ber that Part, neither is it material. As far as I
had the Story related, fo far 1 have handed it for-
ward 5 and 1 have the truth of it afErtned in fuch
a manner, as I cannot doubt it.
Now to obferve a little upon this PafTigc,
which I am oblig'd to fay is reported to me for Truth,
and 1 firmly believe it to be fo : Certain it is, that
finding this Writing was of the utmoll Importance
to the Family > and tho' I am not indeed inclin'd
to publiih Names to the Story, or to examine in-
'
to the Particulars, bydifcourfing with the Perfons,
for fome may be yet Living, yet I fay the Efta-
blifhment
of APPARITIONS. 307
blilliment of not a Family only, but a Generation
of Families, might depend upon thfs Writing, and
that no doubt made the antienr Gentleman lay it
up fo fafe. But why then might not Providence
permit, nay even dirc6t one of thofe Intelligent Spi-
rits or Angels, mention'd above, to give this Notice,
and in this manner, where the main and only Deed or
Charter for the Inheritance was to be found? as
well as it has upon many lilCe Occafions, or in Ca-
fes alike in their Importance, made ftrange and
unaccountable Difcoveries of Things hid for many
Ages 5 and this without Apparition, but by a ma-
nifeft concurrence of Caufes and Accidents next to
Miracles.
I CANNOT think but that Providence, whofe
Concern for the good and fafety of his Creatures
is fo Univerfal, and who it mull be acknowledg'd
is not unconcern'd even in the minuted: Circum-
ilanccs, may think meet to bring fuch a thing as -
this to Light, upon which the good and welfare
of a whole Family did fo much depend 5 and even
to appear in an extraordinary Manner in it, without
any Impeachment of its Wifdom or its Power 5 and
if the fame Providence that thought fit to fave
this Family from fo much Injuftice as at that time
threatened it, thought fit to do it, by the Agency
of a Spirit coming in Apparition to a third Per-
fon, fo to bring it about as in the ordinary Me-
thod, what hav^e we to do to difputc the man-
ner ? or what juft Objedion lies againft it ?
Upon the whole, here's no Devil here, no ima-
ginary Phantoms in the Air, no Voices and Noifes
d-elufive and impofing upon the Fancy one way or
other; no Soul appearing, and pretending Jt can-
not be at re(l> and yet here is an Apparition di-
rcaing to find out what was in Being, and was to
be found, and what Juftice required fliould be
produc'd.

308 The Hijloyy and Reality
Nor could this be the Devil: that wicked A-
gent goes up and down upon a much worfe Em-
ployment. He is bufy enough, that's truej but 'tis
wid'ning breaches in Families, not healing them 5 in
prompting Mifchief, not preventing it 5 tempting
Man to Robbery, to Whoredom, to Murther j not
moving them to repent. As is the Errand, fuch is
the Meflenger^ as is the Work, fuch is the La-
bourer 5 and the wajP of judging is as juft as it is
certain, 'tis eafy and plain, we cannot fail to know
who and who's together.
'T I s the fame in our moft rctir'd Thoughts j
we may very well know who talks to us, by the
Difcourfe, who tempts us, by the Mifchief he
tempts to. My good, wicked, pious, hellifh
Friend and old Acquaintance Z G mull
never tell me, that he does not know by whofe Di-
reftion he tranfa6ts,and who he converfes with,when
he is bid to break Oaths and Promifes under the
cover of Confciencej when he aflaults Innocence by
Clamour, and leviesWar by Slander, againft Reputati-
on and Virtue on pretence of Zeal to Truth 5 black-
ning Charadters in pretence of giving the Innocent
Perfon opportunity to clear himfelfj I fay he muft
not do this without knowing from whence he de-
rives the extraordinary Motion to it, what Spirit
prompts, and from whofe didates he takes the Di-
reftion.
When he daubs on purpofe to wafh, and ful-
lies with intention to clean the Faces of his Inno-
cent Neighbours, he knows as well as I, he is
a6tuated from Hell, and agitated ab Inferis 5 becaufe he
knows that all Hypocrify is from the Devil 'y and
as he knows himfelf to be a moft accompliih'd
Cheat, even from the outfide of his Face to the
infide of his Soul, he may ling after my Lord of
Rochejier in his Sarcafm upon a much bonefter
Man,
of APPARITIONS. 3op
He faid^ O Lord, O Lord of Hofis,
I am a Ra-^—/d that thou knoixfft,
'Tis a ftrange Hypothefis, that a late Vifionift
in thofe pieces of fecrct Hiftory artack'd me with
t'other Day, viz. That he would undertake to
prove From the late Reverend and Learned (but to
himfelf unintelligible) Jacob Behemen, that a Man's
Soul was capable of comprehending God, Futu-
rity, Eternity, and all occult and retir'd things of
the utmoft importance, but it felfj but that, for
divers wife Reafons, the light of felf- knowledge
was hid from his Eyes j except by immediate Re-
velation J which immediate Revelation Friend Ja-
cob pretended to have attained, only with this un-
happy difafter attending it, 'viz. That he could ne-
ver exprefs himfelf, no not to his own Underlland-
ingj fo that indeed he underftood this only, name-
ly, that he could not underftand what he did un-
aerftand.
Now to leave Friend Jacob to his own Quib-
bles, and to his three and twenty Parenthefis, like
a neft of Boxes one within another, and never to
be prolatedi 'tis my Opinion, that if Mankind
will be faithful to themfelvcs, they may always
know themfelvesi that Friend G* not
only always has the Devil in him, but always
knows it J as it is certain, that he that wilfully
Lyes and Cheats always knows that he Lyes and
Cheats 5 fo it is impoffible 'T— E — fliould be a
compleat Rogue, and not know it 5 he meybe in-
deed not able to know how much a Rogue he is,
'till the Devil and he have drawn out the Thread to
its full length, and tried him efFedually, fcarch'd
him to the bottom, and feen whether he will (lop
at any thing orno> and what the wicked thing
can be that is too grofs for him. But he cannot be
X .}
ignoraat
jiO The Hifiory and Reality
ignorant of himfelf in the main 5 he cannot be fo
blind to his own Infide, as not to know that he is
an Original Kna e 5 that he has broken in upon
Principles, becray'd Truft, cheated Orphans, abus'd
Widows, fold Friendfhip 5 and a thoufand fuch
things as thefe already ; and that he has nothing
for ir, but to put as good an Outfide upon it as he
can, to have the Face of an honeft Man upon the
Heart of a Hypocrite, and to be fure to be a Cheat
to the World, to the end of the Chapter.
Indeed it might not have been improper to
have reprefented thofe two worthy Gentlemen as
Apparitions, for that they are fuch is a mod im-
proving Truth, and what it may be much for the
Service of the World to have publickly known r
But as we are now fpeaking of Apparitions which
reprefent Men and things as they really are, it
feems firft needful to bring their infides to be their
outfldes, and then the World may know them by
their fhadows as well as by their fubftancej and for
this I doubt we muft wait a while, the Iflue of an
Aflizes or two j for certainly, if Juftice takes place,
they may both be heard of at the Gallows.
B u T to bring it home to the prefent purpofe, I
infift that no Man can be deceiv'd in himfelfj he
may know whether he is a Knave or an honeft
Man, whether he is a Subftance, or an Apparition,
whether he be a Rcility or a Shadow •, and that 7^-
€oh Behemen advanced only a Delufion proper for a
Knave, pretending that a Man might be honeft
when he believ'd himfelf to be a Knave, and be
a Knave when he thought himfelf honeft.
But to return to the Affiir of the Writing
found in the Cheft, and which, according to the
Notion which fome have of thefe things, the Soul
of theanticnt Gentlemen above came in Apparition to
difcoverj our Queftion is firft How^did he come to
know in his determined State, his State of Soul-
Exiftence,
of APPARITIONS. 311
Exiftence, be that where it would, I fay. How
did he come to know, that the Writing was noE
difcover'd, and that his Grandfon was in danger
of coming to any injury about it ? How did he
know rhat the Law-Suit was commenc'd, the thing
profecutcd lb far, and the damage like to be fuffer'd
10 very much ?
He might know where it was, if not founds
becaufe he hid it there, becaufe he laid k up with
lb much care > but he could not know what Cir-
cumdance had been attending the cafe fince that
time, what proceedings had been at Law, and how
things flood with the Family 5 if he could, then
the Text quoted before out of Job cannot be true,
that the Son r'tfeth and falleth^ and the Father knowetk
it nat.
Tis obfervablc that this Apparition,whichcame
to Do^or Scot^ did not alledge that he eould not
reft 'till this matter was difcover'd > he feem'd con-
cern'd that the Family would be uneafy, and that
they were foj and that there was great danger,
they mjght lofe the Eftacej but did not pretend he
could not reft in Peace, or as the other, that he .
could not go to Heaven 'till it was difcover'd.
I CANNOT but wonder a little at the Ignorance
of the Ancients, in that Notion of the Soul's wan-
dring in the Air all the while the Body was with-
out a Funeral Obfequy j for according to their Do-
6krine, thofe Souls who had no fuch Funeral Pyre
prepared for them, muft have been wandring in the
Air to this Day, and will be fo for ever> not be-
ing able to get admittance either in one place or
other.
N o wonder the Air is faid to be fo fill'd with
wandring Spirits, with Daemons and Ghofts, as
fomc are of the Opinion it is j for where muft all
the Millions of Spirits be gone, who have lain
without Burial, or been caft into the Sea, or been
X 4 ov^r-
The Hijiory and Reality
overwheltn'd with Earthquakes and Storms, or died
by Plagues, where the living have nor been fuffici-
ent to bury the dead ? and the like in many publick
Calamities.
I KNOW the Roman C^thoYxcks have a way of
performing a Service for the dead by Thoufands
;
and in particular for the Souls of the dead, {lain in
fuch and fuch a Battel : whether that has any relati-
on to this old Pagan Notion, or not, I will not fay.
I know Popery has pretty much of the Pagan in
their Original, I mean of their Wor(hip 5 but will
faying one Service for the dead anfwer the End,
whether they have any Burial or no, and tho' their
Bodies are left, as Achilles fays of Hedlory for greedy
or hungry Dogs to rend ? This they do not anfwer,
and I doubt cannot j fo that perhaps all thofe Souls
kiird in fight arc wandringftill in the Air, and can-
not have admittance, no not to the Shades below.
O N the other hand, if the poor Soldiers bc-
liev'd, that if they were killM in fight, they were
to wander for ever, and not be pray'd out of Pur-
gatory j nay, not be admitted into it; few of them
but would chufe to be hang'd, provided they
might be admitted to be bury'd under the Gallows,
rather than go to the War and die in the Bed of
Honour.
They tell us (who pretend to knowj that the
Corps of the deceas'd Princes of France^ as well
Kings as Princes of the Blood, are not buried, but
depofited in the Abbey of St. Dennis near PariSy
'till the immediate Succeflbr is Dead ; and that
then the PredecefTor is buried, and the next is de-
pofited 5 fo that there is always one kept above
Ground.
I D o not take upon me to determine the Matter,
or to fay whether it is really fo or not : But if fo,
and it fhould be as in the cafe of Patroclus^ that
thofe Heroes are then to be out of the happy Re-
gions,
of APPARITIO NS. 313
gions, I muft fay their Kings are but little behold-
en to that Cuftom, and Lewis XIII had a hard
time of it, to have his Son hold it 70 Years, and
keep him all that while even out of Purgatory j and
jiow long he has to (lay there, who knows ? but
'tis Certain, he might have been 40 or fo Years
onward of his way by this time, if he had not been
fo many Years unburied.
But enough of this Pagan and Popiih Frippery:
our bufinefs is to talk to the more rational World;
their Fate is before them > all Men die, and after
Death to Judgment, nothing can interrupt it, and
what their Sons door fufFcr behind them they know-
not.
CHAP. XIII.
Of the Confeqiience of this T>o6irtne\ andfee^
ing that Apparitions are real^ and maybe ex^
fe[ied upon many Occafwns^ and that we are
fure they are not the Souls of our departed
Friends ; how are we to a&^ and how to
behave to them^ when they come among us^
and when they pretend to be fuch and fitch
j
and fpeak in the fir
fl Terfion ofthofe depart-
ed Friends^ as if they were really them-
felves ?
HAVING thus fettled the main point, andde-
termin'd what Apparition is not 3 namely, not
an Angel immediately from Heaven 5 not a return'd
unembodied Soul> and having advanc'd, in EiTay at
leaft, what we are to fuppofc them to be 5 namely,
a good or evil Spirit from the Invifible World >
and having fettled the Rule of judging whether of
the
3x4 7^^ Hifiory and Reality
the two, whether a good or an evil, accordii>g to
the apparent good or evil of their E>efign> it is
time now to bring the matter into.Pra61:ice5 to fet-
tle the grand Preliminary, and determine, fince this
is their Behaviour to us, how we are to behave to
them.
Nor is this a needlefs Enquiry, for we find the
World at a great lofs on fuch Occafions. Men are
exceedingly terrified and difcorded upon the very
Apprehcnfions of feeing any thing as they call it
from the Invifible World > even the great King
Belfiazzar^ tho' in the midil: of his whole Court,
the Lords of 117 Provinces, a full AITembly of La-
dies and Courtiers j yet when he favv but a piece of
an Apparition, (for it was but one Hand) yet his
Countenance cbang'd^ and the joynts of his Knees were
loofed^ and his Knees fmote one againfl another^ Dan.
V. (5. Charles VI 1 1 of France was not frighted
only, but frighted out of his Wits, with an Appa-
rition in the Fored of Mans^ and never recovered
his Senfes any more > and we have feveral inftances
in Story, of Men, even of the greaxeil Refolution,
who have lotl all their Courage^ and all their Re-
folution, when they have had but a fhort Vifit of
this kind, tho' without receiving any injury from
them.
But whence is it, that the Mind is thtis fur-
priz'd? why is our Averfian (o great to aay ap-
pearance from the other World, without fo rauch
as enquiring into the Particulars ?
There are many Reafons indeed to be affign'd
to prove why it is fo\ but not one good Reafon
that I know of to prove it Jhould he fo^ or that we
have any Occafion to be fo alarm'd and difturb'd at
thefe Appearances i I mean, when the Mind has any
degree of Compofure: It is true,, they come from
an Invifible Place, and that is one of the Reafons
of our fright j becaufe, aswe fay, we know not
whence
of APPARITIO NS. 31J
whence they are, of what Errand they come, with
what Commiffion, and with what Power to execute
that Commiflionjall thefe uncertainties bring a Ter-
ror upon the Spirits > the Soul receives afhockj the
y\.\m is like one of thofe poor People where they
are in an Earthquake, they fee the Buildings totter
and fall before them,and tho' they are not bury'd in
the Ruins, but are perhaps efcap'd out into the Fields
;
yet they feel the Earth roll and move under them^
and they are doubtful and apprehenfive left they
may be fwallowed up every Moment ^ and, accord-
ing 10 the old Poet, it is Matter of real Terror 5
^' Fear chills th& Hcavt^ what Heart can Fear dif--
femhle^
*' When Steeples ftagger^ and when Mountains trem^
hie ?
This uncertainty of the Mind in the cafe of
Apparitions, is the real ground of Fear 3 {yiz)t^\^t
we know not
Whence their Errand comes,
What Commiffion they have,
What Power to execute the Commiffion,
FIRST^ We don't know whence they are, and
from whom their Errand, nor indeed can we be
eafie in the uncertainty: The reafon is, there is a
fccret doubt ofthe Mind, founded upon Guilt: Here
the Atheifl bauks his afTurance, and tho' he pretends
to believe neither God or i>^i;/7,ftagger8 at a MefTeo-
ger that comes for ought he knows from one or
both of them, to convince him by immediate de-
monftration. Here his Heart fails him, he turns
pale, ftarts at the fight, and would be glad to be
aflur'd there were really both, that one might pro-
te6t him from the other.
While he knows not whether the MefTage
comes from Heaven or Hell, whether the MefTen-
ger
ji^ The Hijiory and Reality
ger may be Angel or Devil^ the uncertainty attend-
ed with the real Danger of the word, leaves bira
in Horror^ and he fears Hell becaufe he knows he
has provok'd Heaven, he fears the Devil becaufe he
knows he that can command the Devil is his E-
neiny.
1 N a Word, a fenfe of God makes men afraid of
the Devil^ as they fay fear of the Devil gives a
fenfe of Homage to God.
SECONDLY, We tremble at the MefTen-
ger, becaufe we don't know what his MefTagemay
be J we dread the Officer, becaufe we dread his
Commiffion 5 we are afraid of what he has to fay j
"we know we have no reafon to expe£t good
News from the place, which we fuppofe he comes
from, and therefore we turn pale at his coming,
nor is it poffible to be otherwife.
There are but two Principles that fortifie the
Mind againft the Fears of a future State, no not
that feemingly fortifie it i and thefe are,
I. Innocence, or a good Heart founded in
Religion, Virtue, and an exa& reditude of beha-
viour. OR,
1. Impudence, a harden'd (hutting the
Eyes againft Convidbion, and the Ears againfl Con-
fcience.
It is with fome Perplexity that I found my
felf oblig'd to give a Chara£ber in another place
of a fam'd Man of pretended Brightnefs and Wit :
He was always merry, a conftant Smile fat upon his
Countenance, a perfeft eafinefs poffefs'd his Mind,
he knew not a Moment of Melancholly or Cha-
grin. He never figh*d, becaufe he feldom pray'd or
griev'd j I with I could have faid, becaufe he ne-
ver finn'd. His Heart was light as his Head j and as
for his Heels, he always walVd in Minuit and Ri-
gadoons. His Mirth was as uninterrupted as hi*
Breath, and hclaugh'd by the Confequence of Re-
fpiration j
of APPARITIONS. 31/
piration; his Voice was a natural Mu{ic> and his
Rhetoric was all Sonnet and Solfa's.
Sure, faid I, my Coufiu M
"
D muft
have the cleared Confcience in the Univerfe, he
has not the leaft Scar upon his Infide jand if he was
to fee the Devil^^ he could not change Colour, or
have the leaft Hefitation at the moft frightful Ap-
pearance : He muft be all Innocence and Virtue.
Did the leaft Spot upon his Soul appear^
It could not be : his Confcience muft be clear
:
For where there'*s Guilty there always would be Fear,
'
But I miftook my Kinfman moft extremely, for
on the contrary, his Soul is blacker than Negro
^^;^^/?7d/, the Beauty oi jlfrica', heboafts himfelf of the
moft hardened Crime, defies Heaven, defpifes Ter-
ror, and is got above Fear by the meer force of a
flagrant Aflurance.
He would no more value feeing the Devil in his
moft fiery formidable Appearance, than he would
to fee a ftorm of Fire in the ^empeft^ or a Harle-
quin Diahle'm FrefcOy if you will take his Charafter
from himfelf, he has no more fear about him, than
he has Confcience, and that's fo little, 'tis not worth
naming. He knows no Sorrow, no Chagrin > he
was born Laughing, and intends to die Jefting : and
what is all this founded upon? not glorious Inno-
cence mentioned above, but notorious Impudence.
It's true indeed, I had not car'd to fpeak fo
grofly of one of my near Relations, but he will
have it be foj he fpeaks it of himfelf, bids me^ake
notice of it, that 'tis the Charader he gives me of
himfelf, and d -s me with a full Stream of Bil^
linfgate/i( I dare to give any other Charader of him
than what he gives of himfelf.
,• I MUST acknowledge I did believe the De'vil
and my Coufin were not much at Strife, that he did
not
3 1
8
The Hifiory and Reality
not fear the old Dragon, becaufe he had never done
any thing to difoblige him j but it feems the Cafe
differs, and he defies the Z)^w7 purely upon the fame
foot that he defies him that made the Devil i, and
a61:s the Fury meerly as a Fury, not as a Man of
Senfe or as a Man of Courage.
All that I have to fay to this, is, that this will
laft juft 'till the Rage is abated, and no longer j 'till
the Blood cools, and the Spirits return to their na-
tural Courfe, and then the Wretch will be as cold
as now he is hot, as calm as now he is outragious,
and as bafe and low-fpirited as now he is fiery and
furious.
All the hot-headed Courage of thefe Men, is
only a Flafh, a Meteor in the Air > when they are
cool'd, when the Exhalation is fpent, they arc as
phlegmatic as other People; and then they look
pale, the Countenance changes, and the Knees
knock one againft another, as v/ell as other People's.
There's no fcorning the Terrors of a Meflen-
ger from the other World, but by a fettled efta-
blifhed Compofure of the Soul j founded on thcBa-
fis of Peace within, Peace of Confcience, Peace
and Innocence, or Peace and Penitence, which is
in effed all one: This is the only Face that a Man
can hold up to the De'vil \ with a clean Heart, he
may boldly fee the Devil^ talk to him, defpifc him,
and tell him he fcorns him, for that he has nothing
at all to do with him.
But this is not our prefent Condition 5 few Peo-
ple wear this Armour in our daysj they neither va-
ludiit or know the ufe of it, and therefore 'tis that
we are fo full of Terror and Difturbance when wc
fee the Deml\ at leaft if we think he has any thing
to fay to us.
But now for the great Queftion, Why it lliould
be fo? as 1 faid, 'tis Truth too evident tha^ it is fo,
but
of APPARll IONS. 3i<?
but to fay that itJhouU he fo^ that requires another
kind of Sophiftry to make out.
1 T is true, it requires a great deal of Courage,
and of o#ol Courage too, in bearing up the Soul
againft: the Surprize of fuch things as thefe> a Man
muft be able to talk to the Devil m aDiale(!:l: which
he (to^wj himfelf does not very well underfland,
to bid him be- gone, to bid him Get thee behind me^
and the likej 'tis an authoritative way of talking
that every one cannot fupporcj and if the Devil is
fenfible of it, he will not fail to exert himfelf to
the utmoft, to maintain the Right which he feems
to enjoy, and keep the Hold he has gotten; for he
knows how ill his Caufe is to be defended by Ju-
{lice and Reafon, and if he fhould anfvver as he did
to the Sons of Sceva the Jezv^ what then if you
(hould fay to him, in the vulgar and ignorant Dia-
le6t of fpeaking to Spirits, In the Name of the
Father^^ndi of the Son^ and of the Holy Ghofl^ Who
art thou? or, I charge thee in the Name of the
Father<i
6cc. to be gone, and diflurb me no more.
I s A Y, if the Devil fhould anfwer. The Father
I know, and the Son I know, and the Holy Ghofl
I know, but who are you, you that pretend to ufe
their Names thus.'' What would you fay for your
felf?
Now that we may know how to anfwer the
Devilj as well as how to fpeak to him, (for both are
very neceflluy) let me enter into the State of the
Cafe a little, between ihc Devil and us 5 nay, be-
tween all the Inhabitants of the invifible World,
and their Friends in this, let them be who, or of
what kind they will.
First, In order to be free from the Surprize
of thefe thing*;, you muft endeavour to eftabli/h
your Mind in rhe right underftanding of the thing
call'd Apparition 5^ that you may reafon your fcif
into a fufficient Firmneis, and Stcadincfs of Soul
againft
3^.0 The Hifiory and Reality
againft all the whimfical and imaginary Part
of it.
Let us think of things as they are, not as they
are only imagined, and fuppofed to bej fojt 'tis the
Reality of the thing, not the Shadow, that can fright
and difordcr us, that is to fiiy, that can have any
juft Reafon to do fo.
For want of this we are often feared and terri-
fy'd with Dreams and Vifions, even when we arc
awake, and when really there is no fuch thing in
Subftance or Reality as any Vifion or Apparition,
other than Apprehenfion throws in upon us, and
other than our bewitched Imagination reprefents
to us.
I T is abfolutely neceflary, if you would not be al-
ways looking over your Shoulders, and always form-
ing Spedtres to your Fancy : I fay, 'tis neceflary to
have a right Notion of fApparition in general j to
know what it is, and what it mufl be, whence
it comes, and what the utmoft of its Commiffion
can bej that you may think your felf into a true
and clear Underftanding of it, and then your Fears
about it will be regulated after another manner. For
Example
:
1. Establish your Mind in this particular
and fundamental Article, that whatever appears
it muft be either a good Spirit from the invifiblc
World, an Agent of Mercy, a Meflenger of Peace,
and confequently will do you no Hurt: OR,
2. A N evil Spirity an Agent of Hell from Satan's
Region and Empire, the Air> and that fo what-
ever evil Defign or evil MelTagc he pretends to
come about, and however mifchievous his Inten-
tion is, he cannot do the Hurt he deflres, beeaule
that as the good Spirits are under Diredlion, fo
the bad are under Limitation > the one will not,
and the other cannot hurt you, without an imme-
diate Command from above. The Fear therefore
which
of APP ARiriON S. 3ZI
which wc have upon us concerning Apparition, h
not or ought not to be guided by their Appear-
ance, but by the reditude of our own Thoughts;
and as we are or are not quiet and calm within, fo
we fhall or ihall not be under Apprehenfions from
without.
Fortify your Minds then with a fteady Con-
fidence in the Supreme Maker and Governour of
all things, who has the great red Dragon in a
Chain j and when you think you fee the De'viJ^
fear nothing, for He will never let loofe the De-
ilroyer upon any one whofe Mind is lleadily fix'd
upon himfelf.
This is a critical, and perhaps a too curious
Piece of Practice for me to meddle with, efpeci-
ally here, and muft be but gently touch'd at 5 you
will, it may Be, obje£t too againft the Dodrine
of it, and fay , Who can fo efFedually truft in
God, as not to be at all afraid of the De'vil ? Now,
tho' this may feem true upon many Accounts, and,
as Times go with us, may be really a juft Obje-
ftion, yet, if we will believe Hiftory or Experi-
ence, it is not fo much a Difficulty as to fay Who
can do it? for it has been done.
I REMEMBER the kuowu and famous Story
of a Maid under a real and perfonal PofTeflion of
the Devil^ at Little Gadfden in Hertfordjhire^ tho'
by an unhappy Difappointment I was not prefent,
not knowing of the thing time enough > yet I faw
and conversed with feveral that were prefent and
heard the Devil fpeak in the Maid and by the Or-
gan of her Voice, tho' without any apparent Motion
of her Tongue or Lips, or any Part of her Mouth*
O F this Perfon i^ was poficively true, that
there was a certain good Man, tho' a Lay
Chriftian, who fo frequently pray'd with the poor
Demoniack, being a Neighbour of her Father's,
and fo conftantly talk'd to the Devil^ and batter'd
Y him
3Z2 7t)e Hifiory and Reality
him with Scripture, that he was^ as I might
fay, the DeviPs Terror, and he would not let the
Girl go to any Houfe or into any Room where
this Man (whofe Name was Monks) was} and if {he
was dire6ted to any Place he would (lop her, as if he
was to go and fee firll if Mr. Monks was there or
not, and then he would bid her go, for Monks was
not there.
Now, as I am well aflured of the Truth both
of the Girl's being pofTelTed, really aduated by a De^
*uirm her, and of this Devil being afraid of Mr. Monks 5
then the Queftion above is fo far direftly anfwer'd,
that it is poflible to arrive to fuch a State, as not
only not to be afraid of the Z)m/, but even to make
the Devil afraid of us. I confcfs it would be a State
of Felicity that would make Life very eafie to us up-
on many Accounts 5 and 1 could enlargfe very pleafant-
iy (to my fclf) upon that Subje6t. But as things go
with the World, I queftion much whether it would
be fo pleafant to thofe I am writing to, and there-
fore I leave it : and fo if I have been preaching a
little, it is fo little in length, and I hope fo much
to the purpofe, that you may forgive me for once,
efpecially upon Promife of faying as little for your
Good for the time to come, as I can.
There is indeed a right worthy and commend-
able State of Indifference, not only as to Who (hall
or fhall not vifit us from the invifible World, and
from what Part of it they comej but alfo as to
what Station we are to have among them hereafter j
and this happy Temper is much recommended to
me by fome of my fafhionable Friends, as a mod
defirable Condition of Life: to be perfedly eafy, void
ofAnxiety and Perplexities of any kind, and forming
the moft perfeft Compofure of Soul that can be
imagined.
They defcribe this the moft accurately indeed
by the Praftice, for they fay moft feelingly, that
no
of APP ARITI N S. 313
no Tongue can exprefs the Felicity of it > which
indeed I believe is very true 5 they are perfe6i:ly eafy
about^becaufe thoughclefs of, that dull remote thing
called Futurity. As for there being a State of Life,
or a Something like Life after Death, they can't fay
but it may be fo, for they never enquired much in-
to the Pnnciples of the Saduces^ or into any other
Pricinciples about it. But what that State is to be,
or what we are to be, or not to be, in it, they ne-
ver trouble themfelves about it j they look upon it as
a thing remote, which People are not agreed about,
and they believe never will, 'till they come there;
and to be beating their Heads and perplexing their
Thoughts, about what, when they have done all,
they are fure they fhall never arrive to a Cer-
tainty about, they do not fee 'tis to the Purpofeat all.
This is certainly a mighty brief Way with
their Doubts, and a fhort anfwer to all Enquiries j
and I muft own 'tis putting a fhort end to all
Difputes with themfelvcs, about the thing called a
future State,
But there remains a Queftion ftill unanfwer'd,
and which is a Queftion of moment with me, what-
ever it may be with them, ^vs. Where is the Feli-
city of this kind of Calm ?
O, fays a Deift of my Acquaintance^ Peace of Mind
is a Felicity, I hope.
Yes, faid /, if it be built upon a right Founda-
tion.
Nay, fays he^ Peace is Peace 5 don't tell me of
Foundations.
Hold Friend, y^/W /, even Molinos himfclf the Au-
thor of the ^uietifme^ which one Author well calls
Sotifme^ and ot theSe6t of the^/>/i/?j-,and whore-
folved all Felicity and all Religion into the Calm of
a retired Soul, yet fixed that Calm upon the Me-
ditations of an upright Mind, and the Calm of a clear
Heart.
Y i J
524 ^<^ Hijlory and Reality
I VALWE none of your Se^bs, fays my Friend.
Gallio was a true Politician and a happy Man, ji5fs
xviii. 17. //(? cared for none of thefe things -^
and there
was his Happincfs.
S o a Madman, fays /, is happy in his Lunacy,
and enjoys a thoughtlcfs Calm, all the while he is
in the greateft Hurry and Diforder of his Soul. I
fay, there's no Calm in Diftra6lion.
W E L L, but I am calm, fays be^ and yec I am
not difl:ra61:ed.
I D o N 't know that, faid /, I doubt the Faft.
Well, if I am mad, I don't know it, fays he^
and, as 1 faid before, that's a Happinefs to me.
A HAPPINESS in Mifery, faid I\ and fuch is
all the Peace that fuch a Temper can give.
But why is it not a fufficient Felicity, fays hcj
to be calm and quiet?
Because, faid /, a Mind infenfible and un-
moved in Dangers of the greateft Importance, is
not confiftent with the Condition it felf, or with
Prudence and Reafon, under that Condition.
How is it not confiftent ? fays my Friend,
Why, for Example 5 fuppofe, fays /, a Man in
the upper Rooms of a Houfe, when all the lower
Part was on Fire j the Stair-cafe and all Retreats cut
off, except throwing himfelf out of the Window,
if this Man fat fmoking his Pipe, or finging a Song,
or reading a Play, would not you fay he was de-
mented and mad ?
But how are the Cafes parallel ? fays he.
Exactly, faid /, they agree in every Part
but this > that he is certain the Fire is under him,
and you don't know but it may be fo, and don't-
think it worth while to enquire : and to make it
chime in that Part too, you may fuppofe the Man
ignorant too, only that People call to him, and tell
him the Houfe is on Fire, and he does not fo much
as rife off his Seat to go to the Stair-head and fee
whe-
of APPARITIO NS. 3ZJ
whether it be fo or no j tho* he hears them, and
tells them he hears them, he bids them not trou-
ble their Heads abouc him, 'tis time enough when
he feels it 5 and the next Moment the Floor falls
under him, and foon after the Roof falls in over
him, and fo he is burnt to death.
What do you infer from this ? Jliys he.
I E N QjJ I R F, faid /, whether that Indolence and
Unconcernednefs be confillent with common Senfe,
and if a wife Man would do fo?
Suppose I grant it ? faid he.
So, fays I^ you mud grant that an Indifference
about what fhall be our Share of that State which
is beyond U5, Whether the bright or the dark, is in-
confiftent with common Senfe, and that no wife
Man can a6t fo.
Here my Friend and I ended, for inflead of
being touch'd withit, hetalk'd prophanely, andrhea
I always think 'tis time to leave off talking at allj
for when Men give up their Rcafon to Atheifm,
and their Senfe of GO D to Blafphemy, who ihall
labour to wafh that Ethiop ?
It is the fame in the Cafe before mej here is
an Apparition, or fuppofe itj the Man that (t^s it
is utterly unconcerned about it j he cares not one
Farthing whether it comes from above or from
below, whether it be an Angel or a Devil, a Mef-
fenger from Hell or from Heaven 3 and fo this Man
is not afraid of it, but boldly goes up to it, and
like a Soldier cries. Who are you for ? Whence
come you ? What have you to fay to me ? And it may '
be gives it for Anfwer, Very well, go about your
Bufinefs then, I have nothing to fay to you. And
this fort of Courage, as he calls it, this unconcerned
Bravery, he recommends as the bell way to deal with
thefe Spirits.
But fuppofe the Devil won't be put off fo, but
fays, ril come and Vifit you to-morrow in another

fort of indolent, unconcern'd Eafinefs, and the
JVlan falls into Terror and Amazement j what has he
at the bottom to preferve him from the Devil then?
truly nothing j but he is, like Cajhio Burroughs^ all
trembling, and cries out, O God/ here Jhe comes^ and
is frighted even to Death. Certainly a cold Indiffe-
rence about it whether it be an Angtl or the Devil,
and above all, whether its Meflage be from Hea-
ven or Hell, will not hold it out againft the Ter-
ror that may come along with it from without, or
the refleftions ofGuiltthatmaybe raifed by it from
within 5 fo that fome better-grounded Courage, a
Calm begun from a better Principle, muft be en-
quir'd after 3 oreire,as I faid to my Deiftical Friend,
when you do really fee the Devil you will not be
fo eafy as you promife your felf to be. But this is
too ferious for you, I mult go on.
I COME next to the Enquiry, Whatis our bufi-
nefs, and how fhould we behave if it is our mif-
fortune to have any fuch Appearance come to us?
and fuppofe our Minds to be as much compos'd as
ordinarily may be expe6i:ed, not more than our
Neighbours J but what, Ifay^ (hall we do, and what
is the beft courfe for us to take ?
In my Opinion, and it is the next Advice I
would give, I fay next to that of fortifying the
Mind with religious Confiderations, of which I
have fpoken, and which fhould always go firft,
Jpeak to it.
B Y fpeaking to it, my meaning is. Speak tho' it
does not fpeak to you. I have heard of fome Ap-
paritions, who 'tis faid, had no power to fpeak 'till
they were firft fpoken to,and fome cafes of that kind
are publifli'd by thofe who I fuppofe believ'd them j
tho' I fee no reafon to do fo j and particularly of an
Apparition that caufed a poor Man to follow it
over Hedge and Ditch all Night for many a Night
together,
of APPA R IT IONS, 327
together, 'till the poor Man was almoft hurry'd to
Death ; but could not fpeak to him,and the frighted
Wretch was afraid to fpeak to it 5 but at laft the
Man fpoke, and then the Apparition's Mouth wa-?
loofed too : all which I muft confefs I fee no man-
ner of reafon to believe, and therefore cannot re-
commend it to any body clfe to believe.
There fecms no Coniiftency in the Nature of
the thing, no foundation for it in Religion, or
any thing in it that we can Reafon upon for our
own JJnderftanding j and where neither Nature,
Religion or Reafon allow us any Light in it, upon
what Principle can we go to make our Judgment ?
But leaving it therefore where we find it, I
fay if you fee an Apparition, that is fuch an Appa-
rition as we have been fpeaking of, not a Phan-
tofmof your own BraiUjnot an imaginary Apparition
the effed: of Fright or Dream, or meer Whimfie,
not aj Hypocondriack Apparition, tlie effeft of Va-
pours and Hyfterick Shadows, when the Eye fees
double, and Imagination makes it felf a Telefcope
to the Soul, not to fhow Reahties, but to magnify
Objei^ls at the remoteft diftancc, and fhow things
as in being which are not, if you fee fuch an Ap-
parition as this and fpeak to it, 'tis no wonder you
receive no anfwcr, and fo you go away more
frighted with a (ilent dumb Devil than you would
be with a fpeaking one 5 but I fay, if the Vifion be
real, if it be a Shape and Appearance in form as
has been defcrib'd, never fhun it and fly from it ;
but 7^^^^ to it.
I F you woiefld ask me what you fhould fay to it,
'tis an unfair Queflion in fome Refpe6bs 5 'tis not
pofUble for any one to didtate, without the proper
Circumftances be defcrib'd. The old way you all
know : In the name of^ 6cc. as above, is the common
road. I will not cry down the Cuftcan, becaufe 'tis
the ufual way, and the words are gaod 5 but I be-
Y 4 lieve
328 The Hiftory and Reality
lieve a fincere mental Ejaculatory Prayer to the
Bleflcd Being of Beings for his fupcrior Prefence,
would be as efFe6tual as prefenting the Words to
the Devil as a kind of Exorcifm 5 fuch a Petition
fent up, and then a plain njohat are you ? I think is
Compliment enough for the Devil,
A N honeft, plain, religious Scotfman who I knew,
and who thought he faw the Devil^ tho* he was
miftaken too, yet had this (to me) perfe6Hy new
Expreffion upon the lurprifcj/Z?^ Lord be between me
and thee^ Satan awa^ that is go away, or get thee
away: 'twas certainly a good thought, and th'bpoor
Man was right, for if the Lord was between him
and the Devil there was no great need to fear
him or any of his.
B u T to wave particular Inftruftions in the cafe,
the Occafion will certainly adminifter the Subftancc
of what you {hould fay j the prcfent Dire£i:ion is
only in general, fpeak to it^ never fink under the
Terror or Surprize of the fight. The Devil is rarely
feen in his own Shape, and ordinarily for ends of
his own, he chufes to appear in familiar Shapes,
perfonating fome or other that we know, or have
known, and reprefenting to our Fancy fomething
that will not terrify us 5 nay, 'tis the Opinion of
the learned Divines, that the Devil would do much
lefs harm, and be fir lefs dangerous, if he appear'd
as a raeer Devil^ with his Horns, his cloven Hoof,
and his Serpent's Tayl and Dragon's Wings, as
Fancy figures him out, and as our Painters drels him
up, than he does in his difguifes, and the many
Shapes and Figures he afilimes to himfelf.
,
- So fatal are Mrifques and Difguifes, Habits and
Drefi^es to the World, and fuch advantage docs a
falfe Countenance give to Criminal Performances of
many kinds, that even the Devil is more dangerous
drefs'd up in Mafquerade, than in his own Cloaths,
and in his own Colours > if he would come in all
hi$
of A^P ARiriONS. 519
his Formalities and Frightfuls, he would not be
capable of half fo many Coufinings and Cheatings
as he now puts upon us : now you have him here and
have him there, you have him every where and no
where, he is here a Tempter to Wickednefs, there a
Preacher of Righteoufnefs 5 to-day in one difguife,
to-morrow in another j you know him and you
don't know him, fee him and don't fee him, and
how then can any one tell you what to fay to him,
or how to talk with him ?
However, to come as near to it as ^we can,
the firft and ordinary Quellion, natural to the
Occafion, is to know who he is, and whence he
comes, what McfTage he has to deliver, what Bu-
finefs he comes about, and what you have to do
with it, why he difturbs you in particular, and the
like 5 and if you may obtain fo much Civility from
him, to defire him to trouble you no more 5 cfpecially
if you find the Apparition to be of the worft
kind.
If it is apparently a good Spirit, I think the
Condud fhould di$er, as the Meflage he comes about
will certainly differ 5 if it warns you to repent of
fuch and fuch a fcandalous Life j or if it bids you
reform fuch and fuch a criminal Pradice,which you
know your felf guilty of> accept the kind Admo-
nitionjfubmit to the Reproof, and promifc Obediencej
you may depend, as I have often (ixid, the Devil
comes of no fuch Errand.
I F it tells you fuch and fuch Dangers attend you,
take the kind hint, and ufe the proper means to
avoid them, thankfully acknowledging the Good-
ncfs of the Hand that fent the Notice, as well as
the Meflenger that brought it j for depend upon it
the Dsvil^ who is a Lover and Author, as well as the
Promoter of Mifchief, takes no Pains to prevent it,
but would rather have a Hand in bringing it upon
you,
An0
3
J a The Hiftory and Reality
And if fuch things as thcfe are the Subjefl: of
the Meflage, what can you fay why you fliould be
afraid of the Meflengcr ? 'Tis hard to rejoice in
the MefTage, and be fcar'd at the Meflenger: the
truth is, we are not much accuftom*d to fuch folemn
Admonitions, fuch good and beneficent Cautions
and Affiftancesj and this makes the thing ftrange
and aweful, and be receiv'd with Terror and Fright,
and perhaps if it was not fo we fliould receive
them oftner.
We do not find the old Patriarchs, or after
them, the Children of Ifrael^ were fo frighted at
the Apparition of Angels and Spirits 5 it's true in-
deed when the Angel appeared to Gideon at the
Threfhing-Floor, it is faid he was troubled at his
Prefencej neverthelefs the Mefiage was kind and
encouraging j yet we find he recovered himfelf, and
took Courage to talk very particularly with it, and
to expoftulate with him about the Circumftances
of his Country, and of the People, and even to
ask a double Sign from the Angel to confirm his
Faith : and how went he on ? he obey'd the Voice
of the Vifion, notwithftanding all his Fears and
Doubts, and he bow'd his Soul, and followed the
Direftions given him.
There are abundance of Reafons why wc
fhould liften to fuch Apparitions as thcfe-, their
diftinguifhing Charader is, that they always come
of fome Errand or other for the good of Man-
kind j take it either in general, or in particular:
Sometimes 'tis alledg'd they come upon trifling and
mean Occafions, as is the Cafe in many Inftances
given in Story, and in Print. But it may be an-
fwered with an Enquiry, Are we fure thefe are not
trifling Stories, and brought in byPerfons, perhaps,
but half informed? But what are we to think of
the Apparition to King James V. in Scotland^
who warn'd him againft his Flodden-Field Expedi-
tion?
0f APPA Ririo N s: 531
don? which if he had liften'd to he had fav'd his
Life, and the Lives of ten thoufand of his People
:
for lefs, 'cis faid, did not fall in the whole Un-
dertaking.
And what fhall we fay of the Warning given
to the Duke of Buckingham^ by the Apparition of
his own Father, which if he had liften'd to, 'tis
very likely he had efcap'd the fatal Knife? for Fel-
ton^ who Aflaflinated him, did it, as it feems he
declared at the Gibbet, upon the Account of the
Popular Hatred, and that he thought him a pub-
lick Enemy to his Country.
These, and many more which I have men-
I
tion'd, or which I have not mentioned, have been
the Subje6b of fuch Meflcngers, and were far from
trifling. If an Apparition gives any of us Notice
of our approaching End, and bids us prepare for
it, is not the MefTage folemn, and the Occafion
of it weighty 5 and is not the Notice worth our
Regard? Is the Preparation for Death a trifling
thing? and the aflurance how near the time is can-
not but be a valuable Notice j I am fure ic ought
to be efleem'd fo.
A FLOUTING atheiftick Man of Wit, v/ho
muft be namelefs, becaufe he will not bear to be
nam'd to the Crimes which he is not alham'd to
commit, told me, when difcourflng this Part of
the Subje6t, that it was no Kindnefs at all, for
that Men ought always to be prepared for Death j
and yet cou'd not deny but that ic was a remote
Affair which he had not yet given himfelf the
trouble to think about.
I CANNOT believe but that if fome People,
who now value themfelves upon their bright
Thoughts, and their being above the Power of
Ghagrine, or of any melancholly Refleftions to di-
fturb their Joy, were told (nay, tho' it was by a
kind Apparition) that they were to die, one in a
Fortnight,
4
\]% The Hiflory and Reality
Fortnight, one in three Days ; one at one time,
and one at another, and all within a fliort time, they
would have a little alteration upon their Out-fides.
Q,^ .
]\4 wlio laughs evermore, is conti-
nually tittering and prompting others to the loweft-
priz'd Part of Mirth, who is all Levity and Froth,

for you have but three Months to live, and you

X>ays J I fay, fhould fuch a Meflage be ferioufly de-
livered him in fuch an aweful Manner, as many
Relations tell us have been done to others, I can-
not have fo little Charity for the Beau, but to
think he would change Colour a little, and begin
to confider, and efpecially if at the five Days end
he had News that his other Self, the Image of
his extraordinary Soul, the very Sojio to himfelf,
in Life, tho* not in Figure, was found dead in his
Bed to a tittle of the time.
I s A Y I cannot doubt but that he would learn
to Sigh a little 5 and my Charity is the more exten-
five in Mr. M 's Cafe, becaufe, take him
a little off of his ordinary Titillations, and unhinge
him from the light Article which has gain'd fo
entirely upon him as to Eclipfe him, the Man has
yet fome Brains, and they might perhaps affift a
little upon fuch an Occafion, to condenfe the Va-
pour, and bring the folid Part uppermoft, which
at prefent has not happen'd to him.
And not to fingle out a gay Humour or two
from the reft, how many among our Box and Pit
Heroes, were they told they were under the Sen-
tence of Death, and only Repriev'd for fo many,
and fo many Days : I fay, how many of them would
ihinc at the next Opera ? how would their Coun-
tenances
of A?P ARiriONS. 3JJ
tenances change, and their Knees knock one a-
gainfl: another ? How would they fit down in Tears
and Repentance, or fink into the Death foretold,
even by the mcer Horror of its approach ? for
there is the moil: Dread where there is the lead Re-
pentance : Nor let any one cavil at the Expreflion,
a Sentence and a Reprieve, let them take it as they
will} the thing is no lefs, and can be under-
ftood no otherwife of us all : We are all under the
Sentence, as directly as a Criminal that hears it read
at the Bar, with only this fignificant Difference,
namely. That we are Repriev'd fine die^ the Cri-
minal is not, and the Confequence of this may be
the worfe > for we promife ourfelves it fhall be lon-
ger than we have reafon to believe it is, and fo
are often Executed in Surprize, our Preparations
being delay'd by Prefumption > whereas the Oifen-
der knows he muft die at the Expiration of his
Reprieve, and perhaps is aiTur'd that 'tis in vain to
expe6t any farther delay.
Now a kind Meflenger comes, as the Prophet
did to Hezekiah^ and fays. Prepare yourfelf, for you
fhall die, and not live ; is this Meflage to be flight-
ed and difregarded ? If it is fo treated 'tis at your
Peril, you cake that Part upon yourfelfj and if you
find this the Cafe, you will hardly call the Mef-
fage trifling, much lefs fay fuch Apparitions ge-
nerally come upon trifling Occafions.
History records a great many foreboding
Signs, and fome by Apparition, foretelling the De-
IkvnQtionQ^Jerufalem^ and of the Temple 5 not that
any of thofe Signs could be fuppos'd to give Warn-
ing of it, fo as that it might be prevented j for
our Saviour had exprefly faid it fliould be dc-»
llroy'd, I'heir Houfe fijould be left unto them defolate^

'which jhall not be thrown down^ Matt. xxiv. 2. But
thofe Signs and Apparitions were apparent Warn-
ings
234 ^'^^ Hijiory and Reality
ings to the People, at lead to fuch of thera as had
the Wifdom to take Notice of them, to make their
Efcape out of the City before the Romans invefted
it, and before it was too late 5 particularly the
opening the great brazen Doors of the Temple,
Vfhichjofephus fays twenty Man could fcarce turn to
open or fhut, and which opening of themfelv^s,
an Apparition was feen in the Houfe of God, and
SI Voice heard, faying. Let us Depart hence.
N o queftion, but as the Warning or Alarm was
given to direft many to their Efcape, fo many had
that Wifdom given them as to make their Efcape j
and tho' the Defolation was horrible, and fuch as
perhaps was never equalled, except in the fame
Place, and the fame Country, by the jljjyrians^
when the firft Temple was burnt j yet, as they fay
'tis a hard Battle where none efcape, fo Jofephus
himfelf owns, that many Thoufands, and others fay
many hundreds of thoufands fled in time, and made
their Efcape, flying, as the Text fays, from the
JVrath to come. Nor can I doubt but that many
had warnings in Dreams, that is, as I fay, by Appa-
ritions in Dream, by Vifions, and fome by open Ap-
paritions, that the City would be deftroycd.
RABBI JUDAH fays, the Patriarchs ap-
peared to many, and gave them Notice, that the
Romans would come and befiege their City, and
that the Temple fliould be deftroyed j but I doubt
much of the Story, and that On a double Account,
I .Whether ever any ofthe Patriarchs did {o appear and
forewarn themj for had they done fo, they would
certainly have told them that the MeJJiah was come,
and that therefore the fecond Temple was to be
deftroycd, for that all the Prophefies were fulfiU'd.
Bur, 2. I doubt alfo that Rahhi Judah^ if fuch an
Author there was, never faid fo, and that 'tis only
a Tradition.

It is certain there were the like Omens, and I
doubt not Apparitions too, jufl before the taking
and racking of Rome by the Barbarians^ the Fan^
dais and Goths y and we might defcend to modern
Hiftory for many of the like: fo that thefe Appari-
tions do not always come upon trifling Occafions,
at leaft they are not trifling to thofe whom they re-
gard in particular, and therefore 'tis not an Objedion
for a particular Perfon to make.
I HAVE troubled you with none of thofe Appa-
ritions, which have come to help you to find out Mo-
ney, to reveal little love Secrets and Intrigues, and

ble, can come clothed in Terror if they pleafe, and
have done fo where occafion has call'd for itj
either to enforce their Meflage, or alarm fuch Per-
fons who fet up for a hardened Face beyond the
Power of invifible Terrors.
B u T as their MefTage is generally peaceable, and
the Intent of it kind and good, fo they chufe to
come in a manner, as little attended with the frightful
Part as they can.
But not to dwell on this Part, or enquire
at all what the Meflage is they come about, whe-
ther trifling or otherwife, the prefcnt Enquiry is,
what is our Part, what is to be done when they do
appear: For 'till we fee them, we know nothing of
their Bufinefsj nor perhaps when we fee them, un-
le(s we fpeak to them 5 and we have many Stories
of Apparitions, that only fliow themfelves, and
perhaps it may be never fpeak at all.
This
3 5 (J The Hifiory and Reality
This our People call Walkings and indeed it h
not improperly call'd fo, becaufe, as to us, we know
no more of their Bufinefsj but ic no more follows
that they have no other Bufinefs here becaufe wc
don't know it, than that it is likely they fhould come
hither, and walk to and fro, and have nothing to
do.
As forthofe non-appearing Apparitions, if I may
call them fo, (for not to appear, and not to let us
know what they appear for, feems to be much the
famej) I mean thofe not-fpeaking Apparitions, wc
can indeed give no Account of them, becaufe wc
cannot converfe with them: It feems to me they
are not of the Heavenly or Angelick Kind, becaufe
they would certainly have fome more apparent
Bufinefs, and perhaps not be backward to fpeak of
Jt, at leaft they would not feem to be afliamed of
their Errand.
Nor is it my Opinion, that thofe Apparitions
who come of good Errands can be fuppofed to be
unable to fpeak, if it was neceflary to their Bufi-
nefs to ufe Speech J much lefs that they fhould; re-
ceive their Gommifi^on or their Ability to fpeak
from our firft fpeaking to them : There is no Co-
herence in it : But certainly if the Spirits that ap-
pear upon good Defigns, and come upon good Er-
rands, do not fpeak to usj they are not fent to usj
their Bufinefs is with fomebody elfe, which wc
know nothing of, tho' we may fee the Spcftrej
for it may be that a Man may fee an Apparition that
has nothing to do with him, or to fay to him.
O R perhaps the Speftre may execute its Com-
mifiion cffedually, without fpeaking. A Ghoft was
faid to haunt a certain Houfe in the Gountry not
far from Rygate in Surrey^ it was met in the Gar-
den by one of the Family, who had long valued
himfelf upon believing, and faying alfo, that there
were no fuch things as Apparitions, and that he
would

would be Aire of it when-ever he met fuch a things
he would know what it was made of before he parted
with it.
Going out of the Houfe in the Evening when
it was almoft dark, but not quite, he meets the
Apparition in the Garden > the Apparition ihun'd him,
and would not have been feen, or made as if it would
not have been ktn.HJ! fays he bo\d\y^areyou there f
What are you ? The Apparition ftill makes from him,
and he fpeaks again, Who areyou? What is your Name?
fays he, in a kind of jefting manner. My Bufinefs is
not with you^ fays the Apparition. But I have fome
Bufinefs with you^ fays he^ I muft know what you
are, and I will know what you are j and with that,
fays my Story^ (tho' by the way I muft tell you,
Idon't know how true 'tis) Ifay^wixh that the bold
Fellow offers to go up to it and lay Hands upon
it 5 at which it advanced to him and over-run him,
bore him down, and threw him againft the Garden
Wall, which was at leaft five or {ik Yards from
him, with fuch Violence, that he was taken up
for dead j and I fuppofe he never ventured to lay
Hands upon a Spirit or Apparition again.
No w be this Story true or not, I mention it to
warn rafh Heads, who pretending not to fear the
Devil^ are for ufing the ordinary Violences with
him, which afFedb one Man from another, or with
an Apparition, in which they may be fure to re-
ceive fome Mifchief. I knew One fired a Gun at
an Apparition, and theGunburftin a hundred Pieces
in his Hand, (that is in a great many Pieces.) Ano-
ther ftruck at an Apparition with a Sword, and broke
his Sword in Pieces, and wounded his Hand grie-
voufly. It is moft certain that an Apparition or a
Spirit is not to be cut with a Sword, or fhot with
a Gun J as there is no Subftance, there can be no
Wound made} and 'tis ncfit to Madnefs for any one
to go that way to work, be it Angel or be it Devil
Z But
33?^ The Hijiory and Reality
But to carry this farther: In particular^ an Ap*
parition may Ihcw itfelf, and peForm its Miffion in
a full and compleat manner, and yet not fpeak. I
have a Story by me of a Gentleman who carried
on a Secret and Criminal Converfation with a cer- ,
tain Lady, and having made an Affignation to meet
the Lady, was met at the Place by an Apparition i
of his own Mother } flie faid nothing, fhe did |
not offer to fpeak, nor did he at firft know it to j
be an Apparition. The Gentleman walks about
in the Field near a Houfe where he had appointed
the Lady to meet j the Apparition walk'd about
likewife, and he takes it to be a Woman in ordi-
nary, as any Woman might be feen to walk up and
down in the fame Field or Walk.
B Y and by the Woman or Lady appointed
CQipes, he meets her, and goes forward to falute
h^r; the Aipparition fhows itfelf juft behind the
Lady, and looks him full in the Face > he ftans
back from the Lady, and inftead of kiffing her, cries
cuty and asks her. Who's that behind herj fhe turns
about, but fees nobody, nor he neither, which
frights them both.
He fancies it to be an imaginary Vapour, ha-
ving no Faith at all in Apparitions, and offers to
go up to the Lady again 5 and behold, he {ees the
Apparition juft behind her again, the Face ftand-
ing juft fo as to look over the Lady's Shoulder,
and ftare juft upon him ; he cries out again, and
knows it to be his Mother, who it feems was dead,
and in crying out again, he adds, My Mother/
at which it vanifhes.
Had this Apparition any occafion to fpeak?
Was it not Rebuke enough to look him in the
Face? Even in common Affairs, a Look from the
Eye of one who has Authority to reprove, is fome-
times more effedual than the Reproof, if it was
giv^n in Words at length.
Sup-
of APPARITIONS. 339
Suppose this Spedbre to regard him not with
a threatning AfpeiS:, but with a Countenance of
Pity, of a Maternal Reprehenfion, a Reproof urg-
ing Shame and Reproach, like that of Solomon^-
IVhat^ my Son ! what^ the Son of my Vows ! my Son
he feen embracing a Strumpet! the Man went away,
fays my Story, fiU'd with Confufion 3 as no quellioa
indeed but he would.
Here was no need of Speech j the Look was
a Lafli, and a Reproof fufficient j the Man would
hardly meet there any more, if he would meet the
fame Lady any more, and 'tis very likely he never
did.
'T I s very unhappy in the Cafe before me, that
it is impoffible to atteft the Truth of all the Sto-
ries which are handed about upon fuch a Subje6fc
as this is 5 and therefore tho' I might make Flou-
riihes of the Truth of the Particulars in all Cafes,
as others doj 1 chufe rather to infift upon the
Moral of every Story, whatever the Fadt may be,
and to inforce the Influence, fuppofing the Hiilory
to be real, or whether it be really fo or not, whick
is not much material.
All thefe Cafes, however, return me back ta
the Advice above, namely, always if you fee an
Apparition, y/>^^/^ to it^ fpeak to it early, and anfwer
any Queftions it asks, but be fure to ask it no Que-
ftions except fuch as are rcafonable, and may be
fuppofed to be within the Reach of its immediate
Capacity to anfwer j no Queftions tending to re-
veal the Myfteries of a future State. To ask fuch
Queftions as are a plain diving into the Secrets of
Heaven, which it is already declared fhall not be laid
©pen, is asking the good Spirit, if it be fuch, to of-
fend on his Part, and is really criminal on your Part;
as, to ask what Condition the Perfon is in, meaning
the Perfon whofe Shape the Apparition takes up ;
How be gets Leave to appear here j why he comes
z z in
340 The Hijloyy and Reality
in this or that Manner j what kind of Place Hea-
ven is, and fuch likej as the Bifliop of Down and
Connor ordered James Haddock to ask.
But fuit your Queftions to what the Spe£tre
fliall fay, or as the manner of its Appearance ihall
direft you 5 as particularly, if it requires you to do
any thing, to fpeak to any Perfon, or to deliver any
Admonition to a third Perfon, as in the cafe of the Ap-
parition about the Duke of Buckingham^ and as in
the Cafe of Dr. Scot and others 5 you may juftly ask
Tokens by which you may make your felf be be-
lieved 5 alio fuch Queftions as relate to yourfelf, and
to the Nature of the thing which the Apparition
comes about.
But Queftions relating to things beyond Time,
curious Enquiries into Futurity and Eternity, arc
upon many Accounts to be avoided} and for fome
Reafons which I care not to mention in particular 5
becaufe I would not form frightful Ideas in the
Minds of thofe that read. I have fome Stories by
me which give an Account that upon fuch needlels
Inquiries the Apparition has turn'd itfelf into ter-
rifying Appearances, intimating Refentment 5 not
only a Refentment on its own Account, but as if it
was an OfFence and a high Provocation to the fu-
preme Power to offer to fearch into what Heaven
has concealed : To me, indeed, it feems it would be fo,
and therefore 'tis certainly beft to refrain thofe In-
quiries.
In a word, the Apparition is, as I may fay, Ag-
greflbr j it appears j you are paffive 5 be fo ftill, other-
wife you make your felf the Apparition, and put
the Apparition in your Place : ask it wherefore it
appears to you, whether for Good or Evil > if for Evil,
call upon God for Proteftipn 5 if it comes for Good,
declare your felf ready to receive its Me{rage,and to
obferve every juft Direftion, to obey every righteous
Command, and attend to what it fliall fay.
of APPARITION S\ 341
This is to a£t fearlefs, and yet cautious > bold,
and yet wifely 5 refolv'djand yet humble 5 and in this
Temper of Mind, I think no Man need to be a-
fraid of an Apparition.
You may refolve all fuch things into thisj Whe-
ther they are good Spirits or bad, Angelick Ap-
pearances or Diabolick, they are under fupcrior Li-
mitations : the Devil we know is chain'd, he can
go no farther than the length of his Tether j he
has not a Hand to ad, or a Foot to walk, or a
Mouth to fpeak, but as he is permitted. The Cafe
of his Commiffion to Job is explicit j fuch and fuch
things he might do, fuch he might not 5 even the
Lives of Job's Children, and Cattle, and Servants
were given him > and, like a Devil as he was, he
went to the full Extent of his Commiffion 5 he
fpar'd not one of them that he could deftroy, but
he was forbid to touch the Life of Job^ and he did
not, he durft not, he could not kill him.
I F then we are fure the Devil is reftrained from
hurting us, any otherwife than he is direfted and
limited, we may be fure that good Spirits arej for
their Nature, their Bufinefs, their Defires are all
fix'd in a general Beneficence to Mankind 5 their
Powers and Employments, as far as they arc con-
cerned among us, and in things upon this Surface,
are included in the heavenly Acclamation when
the Angels fung to the Shepherds, On Earth Peace
j
Good-mil towards Men^ Luk-. ii. 14.
If at any time they are MefTengers of Judgment,
Executors of the divine Vengeance, it is likewifc
I by fpccial, nay, by extraordinary Commiffion > and
I then they are indeed Flames of Fire, and pun&ual-
(i
ly do what they are commanded, and no more.
J
But even then, that we may be eafie in the
i matter of Apparition, they do not difguife them-
':i! felves or conceal their Commiffion : As Manoab's
•-Wife faid to him when the Angel appeared to her,
z 3 a
341 7^^ Hifiory and Reality
if the LORD 'were fleafed to kill us^ he ^ouU mt
have received a Burnt-offerings and a Meat-offering at
our Handss neither would HE havefhewed us all thefe
things^ Judges xiii. 23. So here, the Apparition of a
good Spirit would not betray us, would not aft by
Stratagem with us, would not appear in Peace when
he means War j come like a Friend, when he was
fent for an Enemy j give good Council, when he
meant Death and DeftruSion ; But if it appears
in Peace, its Defign and its MefTage is certainly
Peace,
Upon the whole, you have no way any Oc-
cafion to be difturbed at an Appearance, but to
regari the Power fending, not the Agent fent 5
lookmg beyond the Apparition itfelf, and with a
refolved Mmd, and a fleddy, calm Courage, fpeak
to it, and demand its Bufinefsj I do not mean by De-
mand, a Demand of Infuk and Arrogance, but an
humble, yet refolved Enquiry, Why, and on what
Occafion it comes to you.
I H AVEdone counfelling. If this Part is too grave
for you, as I faid before, it is not very tedious,
you may make it a Parenthefis, and the Work
will read without it j for why fhould I defire you
to do any good thing againft your Will ?
1 F you don't think there is any thing in it all,
if it is not worth your Notice, go on without it j,
and when you fee any thing, be not furpriz'd and
confus'd, cover'd with Horrour and Fright 5 as is ufu-
ally the Cafe of thofe who laugh loudeft at fuch
things before they come. PF G , Efqj

Notions of feeing Apparitions, and hearing Peopk
talk of Spirits and the Devil !
How
of APPARITIONS. 34J
How witty would he be upon the poor Ladies,
when they Teemed a little difordered at frightful
Stories of People's walking, and of the DeviTs ap-
pearing in horrible Shapes, and fuch like things, as
the old Women perhaps had weakly enough fiird
their Heads with! Nothing pleafed the young Hero
like making a Jefl of thofe things 5 and the Truth
was, that many of them deferved it : but the Jeft
of all Jefts was, to fee the Efquire come home
frighted out of more Wits than any one ever thought
him Mafter of, when riding home in the dark one
Night, he met, that is, his Fancy met, the Devil in
fome monftrous Shape or other 5 but fuch as his
Terrors could not leave him room to defcribe, only
by two great Saucer Eyes glaring in the Dark, and
by puffing and blowing mod frightfully. (It feems
the Devil had been upon fome hafly Bufinefs, and
was out of Breath.)
I N this Terror he is become fuch a Convert to
the Dodrine of the Reality of Apparitions, that he
dares not be a Moment in the dark, dares not lye
alone, or go up Stairs by himfelf: When upon full
iExamination, the Devil he met was only a hunted
Bullock that fome Butchers had made half mad, and
had purfued 'till they loft him in the Night, and
he paiTed the Efquire in the dark, and was found
the next Morning half dead, near the Place where
his Worfhip was feared vvich him. Yet the Fright
has got fuch Pofleffion of his Soul, that allthelaughr
ing athira,andall the Fools and Childrens mocking
him in the very Streets cannot beat that Fit of
trembling out of his Joints, nor fortify his Soul
againft the Vifion but of a Cat, if it be in the
dark.
S o eminently filly does that needlefs Paffion Fear
bring us to be, when it has oace gotten Pofieffion
of the Mind j Howfoolifh, howinconfiftcnt,are the
Operations of it ! Hence really the Saying, to be

frighted out of our IVits^ or Such a one is frighted
cue of his Wits, is not fo out of the way as fomc
may imagine ; and the Efquire mention'd jufl now
is as effectually fo frighted out of his Wits, even
in the letter of it, as is poffiblej for nothing ever
a6ted more like a Fool than he does now j except
it was himfelf when he made a Jcft of the Reality of
that very thing, of which now he is fo diforder'd

CHAP. XIV.
Of Sham Apfarithns^ and Apparitions which
have been the EffeEt either of Fraud or
Fear.
BY fham Apparitions I am to be underftood fucb
as have been put upon People by the Fraud
and Craft of fubtle Knaves, in order to bring about
their wicked Y>t^\gvi%^ or fuch as Fear and weak
Apprehenfion have prefentcd to, and impofed upon
the Imagination. In fhort,
FI RST^ Apparitions with which People arc
cheated by others.
SECONDLTj Apparitions with which they
cheat themfelves.
FIRST^ Apparitions form'd by the Knavery of
others, to cheat, abufe and impofe upon the Cre-
dulity ofthe People. Such was the Fable of Jupiter
defcending in a Golden Shower, and falling into the
Lap of DanaiC^ whom he had a mind to Debauch,
And indeed, whofe Virtue could we think would
in thofe Days, (not to fay a Word of our more
modeft and fandified Ladies) refill: a fliower
of Gold, falling into their Lap.? with a God in
the middle of it too 5 But that by the way.
The
of APPARITIO NS. 34y
The like Apparition that Immortal Ravifher of
Virgins, calPd Jupiter^ made, when he ftole the Lady
Europa in the fliape of a Milk-white Bull, invi*
ting the Lady to get up upon his Back, and im«-
mediately jumps into the Sea with her, and fwims
over the Hellefpont -, from whence the other fide
where fhe landed is calPd Europe to this Day. In-
deed when Ladies come to ride upon Bulls, what
can they exped ? Such was the horrid Cheat put
upon that poor virtuous, but bigotted Roman Lady,
pcrfuading her that the God dcfir'd to en-
joy her, which fhe in blind Devotion fubmitted to
with Raptures of divine Joy and Elevation •, caufcd
her Bed to be laid in the Sacriftie of the Temple,
deck'd it with Flowers and Perfumes, and caufed
the debauch'd Prieft to be drefs'd up With Robes
of State, and offering rich Odours all the Night 5
when at length, inftead of the God, inftead of the
Apparition which fhe expe£l:cd, flic was betray'd,
and was violated by the Traytor that lay in wait
for her in the Temple. Such again was the Appari-
tion of Jpollo which Lucian fpeaks of, which was
feen fulpended in the Air, and carry'd or mov'd a-
bout from place to place in the Temple of Jpolh
at Hierapolis. Lucian de Dea Syra.
Such was the fordid Impofture of Mahomety
who having brought up a tame Pidgeon to come
to his Ear, where he fed her always with Peafe or
Tares, fo that fhe conllantly came thither at his
Call j perfuaded his Followers that it was an Appa-
rition of the Angel Gabriel fent from G O D to
whifper divine Oracles into his Soulj and that he
received the heavenly Infpirations by that means.
Such was the Voice which pronounc'd him to be the
Prophet of the moft high GOD, which Voice
founding in the Air, no Perfon appearing to fpeak,
was concluded to be the Voice of an Angel, ap*
pearing to him, whereas it was fpoken by his own
Direftiosi
54^ ^^ Hijiory and Reality
Direftion by a poor Fellow who he had placed on
purpofe at the bottom of a Well j and when he
found the Impofture take with the People, he fent
a Detachment of his Followers to fill up the Well
with Stones, pretending it was that it fhould no
more be prophan'd by any Man or Cattle drinking
of its holy Waters, from whence the Voice of an
Angel had been heard -, but really to bury the poor
Wretch at the bottom of it, that he might not
betray the Secret, and difcover the contriv'd Delu-
Son.
^ Such likewife was the Story of the Afs that
carry'd him up into Faradife, and that not only to
one, but through fevcn or eight Paradifes or Hea^
vens, where he faw two and thirty thoufand Vifi-
ons: And fuch were all the Apparitions which that
ridiculous Impoftor feigned to fee upon every Oc-
cafion, 'till his blinded Followers believed him to
be an Apparition himfelf.
Such was the Image of St. G6»<?r^^,rightly call'd
Miraculous, which the Greeks to this Day play
horrible Pranks with at the Ifle of Skyros in the
jlrchipeUgm^ and which they put upon the People
as an Apparition indeed 5 exerciling particular Seve-
rities upon People in feveral Cafes : But as it is ma-
naged by the Priefts, fo 'tis efpecially very furious
Upon all thofe that neglefi: to fulfil the Vows made
to the faid Saint George^ or in general to all thofe
that do not pay their Debts to the Clergy.
Monsieur Tournefort in his Voyage into the
Levant gives a diverting Account of the Condud:
of this Devil of Skyros 5 how they worry the Ig-
norant People to Death with it, and impofe upon
them by it in the groffeft and abfurdeft manner
poffible. As there are not greater Impoftprs in the
World than the Greeks^ and efpecially the Greek
Clergy -y fo there are not a more ignorant, eafily-
impos'd-upon People in the Worldi than the Greek
L.ayety %
of APPARITIO NS. 347
Laycty j and efpeciallythofe whom the GreekCXtrgY
have to do with : Hence it is, that the moft abfurd
Reafonings go down with them 5 and indeed they
may be truly faid to be Believers in the literal fenfe,
for they take all things by the lump, and without
reafoning at all upon them : if not, it would be im-
poffible to pofTefs them, as thePriefts do, with a Be-
lief that the Image of St. George moves the Priclt,
not the Prieft the Image, tho' he carries it about
upon his Shoulders.
Yet this is the faft : The Image of St. George is
no more than a Pifture, and that of very courfe
Painting reprefenting St. George upon a log of
Wood > 'tis plac'd over the great Altar of the Ca-
thedral at Skyrosj which is dedicated to that Saint:
when the Church is full of People, the. Image is
fecn to move of it felf. This they call, and were
the fa6t true, it might well be caird,the Apparition
of St. George y but be the Fa6t true or not, 'tis be-
liev'd to be fo, and that's as well to all the intents
and purpofcs of an Apparition, as if the Image were
invigorated.
But to fpeak it in their own words, the Image
is feen to move of it felf, and to {how it felf in
Apparition to all the People 5 for notwithllanding
its Bulk and Weight, it will tranfport it felf through
the Air into the midfl of the AfTemblyj there it
hovers about, as it were viewing every Face and ex-
amining every Heart; if it finds any one that has
faird to perform any Vow to him (the Saint,) the
Image immediately fixes it felf on the Shoulders of
the Delinquent, fingles him out, and not only he
is expos'd to the whole AfTembly, but the Image
plies him with furious and continued BuJBFettings,
'till he becomes penitent, and promifes again in the
Face of the AfTembly to pay what he owes to the
Churcho
But
348 The Hifiory and Reality
But this is not all : but when the Aflembly is
thus purg'd by the Juftice of this Ghoft in an I-
mage, it is then taken up and plac'd upon the
Shoulders of a blind Monk, who carries it out of
the Church into the Townj the Monk being blind
and not knowing whither he goes, is guided by the
occult impreffion of the Image, who guides him as
a Rider guides a blind Horfe > and thus he carries
him direaly to the Houfc of fuchas are Delinquent
in the cafe of Debt to the Altar of St. George.
Nor is it enough that the Debtor feeing the
Apparition or Image coming to him, flies from it, and
cfcapes from Houfe to Houfc j for the Image caufes
the Monk to follow him by the Foot, as a Hound
docs a Hare 5 fo that,in a word, there's no efcaping
St. George^ no flying from him, the Monk is fleddy
in his purfuit, afcends, defcends, pafles, repafles,
enters all places, 'till the poor Wretch, who maybe
truly faid to be hunted down, or Hounded down as
they exprefs it in the North, is oblig'd to pay the
utmoft Farthing.
This Story fully confirm'd my thoughts in a
Remark which I made from the beginning of this
Work, that really Church Apparitions are the moil
frightful, moil teizing,and terrible in their way, of
all the real Devils that walk about in the World.
But what need we wander thus among the
Ancients, and hunt among the Greek Schifmaticks
for artificial Apparitions, and for Ecclcfiaftic Delu-
fions of this kind ? The Roman Church, that true
Catholick Eftablifhment, built upon the folid Rock
of St. Peter himfelf, how full is it of glorious Frauds
of this kind ? and how has the whole Scheme of
Papal Tyranny been fupportcd among the People
in this very manncr,ever fince the great defeftion of
the Roman Hierarchy, from its true Primitive Pu-
rity, and original holy Inftitution }

Not that I purpofe to make this Work a Col-
ledion of Church Apparitions, whether Popiih or
Proteftant } any more than I fliall enter upon a re*
citing the Univerfalia of State Apparitions j 'tis
well for this Age, both in Church and State, that
my Dodrine of the Reft of Souls is cftablifh'd j for
certainly, if the Souls of the Departed could bedi-
fturb'd either in Heaven or Hell5by the mad things,
or the fimple things, the good things, or the
wicked things tranfa6ted by their Pofterity in thefc
Days, there muft be as great an Uneafinefs in
thofe eternal Manfions on account of the prefent
Age, as ever there was fince Hiftory gives us any
Account of things : Never did any Generation
make fuch Fools of their Fathers, and fuch wife
Men of themfelves, and both fo unaccountable 5
fure it muft be, that the Dead cannot come to the
Quick, and that they know nothing of us, or the
whole World would be one Apparition, and we
fliould, as Sir ^ B faid above, have all
come up again that was under Ground, the dead
World would be too many for the living World,
and we fhould meet ten Apparitions in every Street
for one living Creature.
B u T to come to the Cafe in hand, the firft
Chriftian Apparition I meet with deferves our par-
'
ticular Remark j firft indeed, becaufe of the Impor-
tance of the Occafion, namely, for the Confirma-
tion of the Faith of all true Catholicks in that great
difputed, yet unfettled Point, viz. Whether ever
iS*/. P E T E R was at Ko WE. or no ? a Point fo eflen-
tial, and which the Hereticks take fo much Pains
to make doubtful, that if we Catholicks do not
tftablifh it paft all the Cavils of our Enemies, we do
nothing 5 and for this we bring the miraculous
Apparition of Jefus Chrift to St. Peter juft without
the City, and which carried Peter back again into
the City j fo that as he came out of Rome, and re-
turned

good Authority for the Relation > and therefore
thinking my felf not competent, not a fufficicnt
Evidence, being perhaps fufpefted of Herefy, I
fliall give it you out of the Labours of an
ancient Father of the Roman Church, and you ihall
liave the Story from his own Mouth, and in his own
Words, as follows: It is the famous Doftor Smithy
a Popifti Preacher in Queen Mary's Days, who
boafted that he had overcome both Biihop Ridley^
and Biiliop Latimer^ ia a Difpute againft them about
St. Peter's having been at Rome. Take a piece of
the Reverend Doftor's Sermon.
The Do6tor's Rufinefs was to take upon him to
run down the poor opprefs'd ConfefTors, Cranmer,
Ridley and Latimer^ and make them odious to the
People 5 and being to preiich a Sermon upon this
Subject at Whittirigton College in London^ fthe fame,
or near it, that is now call'd "^x.. Martin Vintry) He
begins thus,
''My Mailers, you are in great E rror concern
*' ing the biefled Sacrament, and all your Trull
*' was in Cranmer^ Ridley^ and Latimer > as for La-
'' timer^ he faid in open Difputation at Oxford^ that
^' he had no Learning in that Matter, but out of
*' Cranmefs Book. Before this I difputed with
'' Latimer twenty Years ago, and then he had no
'' Learning : As for Cranmer^he faid that his Learn-
''
ing came from Ridley, and as for Ridley^ I dif-
" puted with him my felf now at Oxford the other
- *'
T)^Y^ and I proved my Argument thus, Ille cut
** Chriftus obviav^it Roma fuit Roma 5 ac Chrifius
" obviavit Retro Roma : Ergo Petrus fuit Roma. That
*' iSj He whom Chriji met at Rome was at Rome j
but
of APPARiriO NS. 3j
*' but Chrift mec Peter at Rome^ Ergo Peter was
" at Rome.
" By this Argument I prove two things, and
^ lingular Myfteries of our Faith.
'' FIR S jT, "that Peter was at i?^;«^,again{l thofe
*' who clatter chat Peter never was ar Rome.
" SECONDLT, Thac if P^^^r met Chrift
*' bodily, as Abdias reporteth, and which 1 am fure
*' is true, or elfe fuch an ancient and holy Father
'^ would never have written it ; then confequencly
'' he may as well be in the Blefled Sacrament, as
'' he was met bodily. To this Ridley llood like a
" Block, and feeling himfelf convtnc^r*, anf.ver'd
*' nothing. Then faid I, cur non refpondes Haretice^
*' Hiereticorum^ H^reticijfime ? did I not handle
" him wcll.^
*' Then he deny'd the Minor, which I proved
*' thus. Chrift met Pf/^r going out of i^o;;^^, and faid
" Good-morrow Peter! whether goeft thou? Peter
'^ anfwer'd,Good- morrow ^o£?^ Af^//, whither goeft
*^ thou ? Then fxid Chrift^ 1 go to Roine to fuffer.
*' What ! faith Peter : I trow,unlefs I take my Marks
'^ amifs, ye be Jesus C h r i s t : Good Lord^ how
'^ do you ? I am glad I have met you here. Then
" faid Jefus Chrill to Peter^ Go back and fuffer, or
*' elfe I muft > 5? pro te £5? me.
'' When Ridley had heard this my Proof, and
*' Abdias's Authority, a Do(51-or ancient and irre-
*' fi'agable, he anfvver'd never a word 5 and thus I
*' confuted Ridley in the Audience of a thoulandj
" and yet ye fay, that Jedis Chrift was never bodily
*' on Earth fince his Afccnfion.
H E R E 's an Apparition of good Fame, and of
extraordinary Authority j and if any Obje6tion can
lye againft it, 'cis only whether it be true or not j
but I am not to anfwer for that, 'tis certainly
true, that the Learned Do6bor preach'd this excel-
lent Sermon, and that's enough for me.
But
3 y z The Hifiory and Reality
But having thus given you an Apparition of
fuch great Authority, natnely of Jefus Chrift him-
felf, I fhall quote you a few others of a more mo-
dern kind to confirm you in this Principle, namely,
that Apparitions did not ceafe in the Church : Tho*
Miracles are faid to ceafe, and Prophcfies ceafe, tho*
Oracles are dumb, and the Dead do not return 5 yet
that Apparition is not wanting, and the Artifices of
the Fathers remain 5 namely, that they can fhow
you wonders in Vifion every Day for the Confir-
mation of that great Catholick Verity.
I MIGHT defcend here to the famous Appariti-
on of Loudon^ commonly caird the Devil o\ Lou-
don 5 and the yet more famous Apparition of Jetzer^it
Bern in Switzerland. Thefe are indeed Orthodox
Delufions, and both carried on with the utmofl;
Aflurance, I had aim oft faid Villany, by the Priefts
;
But I am not come fo far down yet on our way to
Modern Roguery.
O N E of our Popes I think infifted, that he had
had an Apparition of the Devil to him j whereas St.
Francis^ and St. Ignatius each in their turn put the
Bice of Apparition upon the World, in fo many
particular cafes, that if they had not, as we may
fay, left it off in time, as the World took them for mad
Men and Fools, they [would have taken them for
what they really were, viz. Knaves and Cheats,
and have ufed them accordingly j and indeed it was
once within an Ace with St. Francis of his being
whipt through the Streets at Naples for an Impoftor j
and he had but one way to get off, which was to
add feme things to his Condu6t fo extremely filly
and ridiculous, that he was taken for an Idiot, and
let run loofe in the Streets with a crowd of Boys
at his Heels following and fhouting at him, and
throwing Dirt and rotten Eggs upon him. This
he turn'd into a fpecies of Martyrdom, valued
himfelf upon it, and would not fuffer the Filth to
be
of AP PARITIO NS.' 3J5
be fcraped off from him ; ; ecaiife it was the Orna-
ment and Crown of his Sufferings for preaching
the GofpcL
It was doubtful, for feme time, whether this
holy Enthufiaft had more Apparitions of the Blef-
fed Virgin^ or of the Devil^ following him : It is
true, fome of our Hereticks affirmM he had no
Apparitions at all, either of the Virgin or of the
Devil y but that it was all a devilijh Cheat, whiclt
he had the Face to put upon the World. Buc
this, they tell us, is too uncharitable 5 becaufe 'tis
fuppofing the Wretch himfelf, (who, it is alio w'd, was
a very weak and filly, tho' an impudent Fellow)
was able to Impofe upon all the World at thaE
time, who Univerfally believ'd that he had feea
fome Apparitions which elevated his Mind to than
degree of Euthufiafm which he appeared afted
by.
But then, if we muft allow he was vifited with
Apparitions, it muft be of the Devil^ not the Blep-
fed Virgin 'y becaufe we have no Scripture Autho**
rity to fupport the Notion that fhe ever did, or
can appear at all, either to him or any body elfej
and that all the pretended Apparitions of the Vir-
gin Alaryy of what kind foever, which the Le-
gends are full of, are the meer Impoftures of the
Priefts, as really and openly as if they had been
feen to be performed : Such was her (peaking to
St. Bernard^ when he came up the Nave of the
great Church at Miltan^ at four fteps, twenty Yards
at a fteps at the firft ftep he fiid O Falixl at the
fecond ftep, O Pial at the third ftep, O Santa!
and at the fourth ftep, Maria! to which the Image
anfwer'd. Salve Bernardi. The Marks of the four
fteps. Dr. Burnet^ in his Letters, tells us are to be
feen in the Church ftill, cover'd with little Plates
of Brafs, having the Words feverally cut upon
them : and yet in fpite of the Relique we cannoc
A a for
354 ^^^ Hijiory and Reality
for our Lives believe that the filenc Image fpoke
to him, any more than that he itept twenty Yards
at a ftride.
Upon the whole, we are at a Point with St.
Francis^ that if any Apparition did haunt him, it
was that of the Devil -y and they tell us this was
fo frequent, that at laft he pray'd to the Firgin^
that the Devil might not be allow'd to appear to
him but upon extraordinary Occafionsj and that
whenever he did, he Ihould have the better of the
Devil^ if he contended with him : after which the
Devil never appeared to him at all in his own
Shape, as it feems he ufed to do, but always un-
der fome Difguife, or in other Perfons Shapes,
tempting him in thofe Apparitions, as he found
Occafion \ but that he was always too hard for
him, and drove him away. Who had the Vi£tory
at lafc, Hiflory is filent: but fome are apt to doubt
that the Devil had the better of him then, for
that we do not read much of his Triumph over
the Dcvil^ in ArticuU Mortis,
St. IGNATIUS^ the Patron of the Jefuits^
pretended to make St. Francis^ who was before
him, his Patron, and to Mimick him in all his
moil ridiculous Extravagancies 5 and thefe of Ap-
paritions amongft the rell; and his Life indeed is
full of Hiftorics of Apparitions, either of one Saint
or other, or of the Devil^ or of the Virgin^ upon
all Occaiions, and fome of them the molt trifling
and frivolous in the World.
St. FRANCIS being very melancholly, ear-
neftly defir'd to hear fome Muiick, being told that
Mufick would exhilerate the Soul} and immediate-
ly an Apparition of Angels furrounded him, and
making a Concert of mod harmonious Mufick
play'd admirably for his Confolation, for a very
eonliderable while.
St.

St. IGNATIUS had like Apparitions of An-
gels playing iVeec LelTons of heavenly Miifick to
him when he was writing his Book of Conftitu-
tionsj likewife afier his Death a Concert of An-
gels made mod excellent Muiick at his Grave, and
leveral Stars were feen placM upon his Sepulchre.
N. B. The fir
ft Stars that were ever feen in
Apparition upon Earth j nor indeed did I ever
hear that the Stars ivalk'd before.
Some Apparitions have been form'd by the Po-
licy, or rather the meer Face of the Priefts, to
prove their abfurd Doftrines. Surius^ a zealous
Writer for Invocation of Saints, fays, that what*
ever Hcrcticks may prateJ
(he ihould have faid, what-
ever the Scripture may prate) it is abundantly prov'd
that the departed Saints know our Concerns on Earthy
and hear our Petitions^ and fo he determines the
Queftion in Controverfy, viz. Invocation of Saints*
Surius Not. ad Bonavent. in Fit. St. Francifcii
He docs not indeed ofFer any thing to prove the
Fa6b, but fcveral miraculous Apparitions of the
Blejfed Virgin to the devout Priefts praying to her,
one of which may be as true as the other.
T o prove the PoiHbility of a Perfon being irt
two Places at once, we are afTur'd of the follow-
ing Apparition of St. Ignatius.
LEONARD KESEL, a Jefuit o^ Cologne,
paffionately dcfir'd to fee this extraordinary Perfon >
of whom he had heard fuch wonderful Things re-
lated, and whofe Fame fprcad far and wide for a
mod wonderful Man : Kefel^ an honelt well-mean-
ing Man, knowing very well the bell: way to fee
a Man was to be brought to the Place where he
was, and having no Notion of his being a Worker
of Impoflibilities, tho' he thought him a ftrange
Perfon too 3 yet, I fay, not dreaming of Miracles,
A a a he
15^ The Hifiory and Reality
he writes to Ignatius what a defire he had to fee
him, and begs his Leave, ( for Kefel being a Prieft
of his Order, he could not flir without Licenfe) I
fay, begs his Leave to come to Rome to receive his
BkfTing.
IGNAtlUS forbids him 5 pofitivcly afluring
him that if fuch an Enterview was necefTary, God
would provide a way for it, without giving him
the trouble of fo long a Journey.
KESEL did not underftand the meaning of the
Anfwer, and was extreamly diflatisfy'd to be fo far
under the Difpleafure of his Superior, as to be de-
ny'd coming to fee him, which he fo paffionately
defir'dj however he was oblig'd to fubmir, and
waited the Event.
Upon a Day, fays the Story, when he leaft
thought of it, behold Ignatius comes up into his
Cell, or Chamber, and having talked with him a
very confiderable while, fuddenly difappear'd > lea-
ving the Jefuit exceedingly comforted with fuch a
prodigious wonderful Vifit.
St. FRANCIS did thefe things frequently^
it feems, and rid thro' the Air in a fiery Chariot >
which I dare fay is as true as that St- Dunftanj
while he was a Boy, flew down from the top of
Glaftenhury Hor^ or I'ower^ a Place well known in
Somerfetjhire.
The Converfion of St. Ignatius^ they tell us.
Was brought to pafs by an Apparition of St. Peter
to him, who came and touched his Wounds re-
ceived in Battle, and healed them immediately 5 and
yet it feems as if St. Peter was but a lame Dodor,
for that St. Ignatius halted, and that his Leg was
crooked as long as he liv'd, cannot be deny'dj
whereas when St. Peter healed the impotent Man
at Jerufalem^ the Text fays he made him every
wbii whole^ AUs iii. 7, 8.

St. Frangis is faid to have done innume- .
rable Cures for fick and difeafed Perfons, by ap-^
pearing to them after his Death, and I could fill
a Volume with the Hiftory of them ^ but it feems
to be needlefs, all true Catholicks acknowledge
it.
PASCALL^ Ignatius^ Chamber-Fellow and
Companion, being reduced to <7reat Neceflities af-
ter his Death, implores the AfJiftance of his CoK
legue in the Church of St. Laurence^ or fome
other Church at Rome-j immediately he heard a
melodious Sound, and faw Ignatius appearing to
him, attended with a numerous and beautiful Train
of the Servants of God 5 but what Relief the Ap-
parition gave him in his extream Neceflity, this.
Deponent faith not.
But I may clofe the Difcourfc of impos'd Ap-
paritions with that memorable Story of Jetzer^ a
Dominican in the Monaftry or Houfe of Domini*
cans at Bern^ in Swifferland : The Forgery is ma-
nifeft, and the Reafon of it 5 'twas an Impofition.
upon the Francifcans^ and contrived to carry on the
Contention which was between the two Societies
to a compleat Vi6tory.
The Francifcans infill upon the Blejfed Firgin\
being Immaculate, and born without original Sin^
fandify'd from the Womb •, and therefore they can-
nonize Blefied St. Ann^ who was the Virgin's Mo-
ther, and make her a triumphant Saint > almoft as
glorious as her Daughter^ and have a Service for
her, caird, the Prerogatives of St. Ann, Mother of
the Mother of God: wherein they declare fiie con-
ceiv'd the Bleffed Virgin without the Knowledge
qf a Man, and that it was upon an Apparition of
two iVngels to her, which fhe relates to her Huf-.
band Joachim. There's an Apparition too for the
Confirmation of the Francifcans. (That's by the
way.)
A a 3

35^ The Hijlory and Reality
The Dominicans^ on the other hand, deny
that the Virgin is Immaculate 5 they alloy that
fhc \% conceiv'd in Sin, but that fhe Gontinud'un'
der the Culpa or Defilement but three Days 5 and
they bring in an Apparition of the Blejfed Virgin
to this Friar Jetzer^ lamenting to him that they
fhould go about to make her equal to her Son in
Hohnefs, andconfeffing, in the Words of the Text,
that fhe was Jha^en in Iniquity^ PfaL li.

.
S o here is one Miracle to confute another, and
perhaps both alike autheniick.
But the Story of Jetzer is full of Miracles,
all contriv'd by the Prior, and three of the Fa-
thers : firft, the Apparition of a Soul in Purgatory
comes to Jetzer with a Box near his Mouth, fo con^
triv'd, that when he breath'd upon it, it appeared
to be all Fire coming out of his Mouth > he had
alfo three Dogs hanging upon him, and gnawing
him as his Tormentors.
I N this Pofture he comes to the poor Friar Jet*
zer in the dark, and when he was in his Bed, tells
him his deplorable Condition, but that he might
be taken out of Purgatory by his Means, and by
his Mortifications 5 and this Story he backs with
moft horrible Groans, as in the utmoft Mifery by
his Sufferings.
N. B. Tou are to under
ftand that this Friar Jet-
zer was a Fellow picJtd out to make a proper
T'ool for thefe Impoftures^ being 'very filly^ and
very devout -y and had they not over*a6icd the
ihingy the Deftgn might have gone a great
way.
In Confequence of the firft Apparition, they
made the poor Friar undergo fevere Difcipline,
Whipping and Mortifications, and then the Appa-
;*ition came and thank'd him, and told him he was
^diyer'd out of Purgatory by his Means j,

Part ended, to the infinite Satisfaftion of the poor
macerated Friar.
The next was the Apparition of the fame Per-
fon, but in the Habit of a JSIun^ reprefenting St. j5^r-
har^^ and all in Glory 3 telling him, that the
blefied Virgin was fo delighted with his Zeal and
Devotion, that fhe would vifit him the next Day
in Perfon, and give him her Bencdi6tion for Con-
folation in his Sufferings and Mortifications; at
which the Fool (the Friar I mean) was raviihed
with Joy, and prepared himfclf and the whole Convene
to receive her.
At the appointed time, the expeded Delufion
appeared: The blefied Virgin, clothed with the*
utmoil: Magnificence, drefs'd up with Jewels, as
file ufed to be on Occafionof the mofl: folemnFefi:i-
vals ; attended by Angels which were feeu to be
flying about her, as her Pages.
N. B. l^hey were the little carv'd Angels which
were placed in the Church upon extraordinary
Days^ and now placed as Machines about the
Apparition^ and lifted up in the Air^ with Put"
lies faften'd in the Room above.
In this Equipage, the Lady Queen of Heaven,
Mother of God, was brought in Apparition to her
poor mortify'd and humble Servant 5 fiie carefi: him
with high Expreflions of Afi^e6lion to him, extol-
ling the Merit of his Charity, in fuffering fuch Se-
verities for the meer Love of delivering a poor
tormented Soul out of Purgatory; own'd to him,
that file was conceived in original Sin ; and told him
Pope Juliusy who then held the Chair, fiiould puc
a final End to all thofe Difputes, and fiiould abolifii
the Feali of her Conception. After much more
to the fame purpofe, fiie promifed him a Mifiion to
go to the holy Father in her Name, to aflure him
of the Truth of the Vifion, and that it was her
Pleafure it fiiould be ^o-, and in Confirmation of it
A a 4 all.
The Htjiory and Reality
all, flie gave him three Drops of Blood, which flic
told him were the Tears Chrift fhed, when he
wept over Jerufalem • with abundance of fuch like.
Here was a true fliam Apparition now, form'd
to cftablifti a particular Sc£b or Society 5 and a parti-
cular Profeflion, concerning the immaculate Concep-
tion 5 here could the impatient Friars have fet Bounds
to their Revenge, they had had a compleat Vidtory
over the Francifcans. Nay, had St. Francis himfelf
come up in Apparition on the other fide, it would
not have balanc'd the Cheat 5 for all the World
began to give Credit to the Apparition.
But the Priefts knew no Bounds 5 nothing would
fcrve them but new Apparitions to the Friar, and
new Mortifications to the Francifcans , 'till in fliort
Jetzer himfelf, as foolifli and fimple as he was, faw
through it, detedted the Cheat, and efcaping out
of the Monaflery, difcover'd it all to the Magi-
ftrates, having twice efcaped being poifon'd by
them 5 fo the whole Fraud ended at the Gallows,
or rather gt the Stake, for the four Friars were
condemned to be burnt, and were executed accor-
dingly.
The Hlftory of the Difcovery is not to my
Purpofe, it may be feen in many Authors, as alfo
the Tryal, Sentence, and Execution of the Crimi-
nals ^x. BernJ May ^i, if09, where they were all
burnt together. But this Part is efFe6i:ually to my
iPurpofe, viz. that there has been, and I doubt not
Hill is, a great deal of fliam Apparition impos'd
upon the World by the Delufions of others 5 and as
it lies chiefly among the Clergy, where mud we
look for it, but where it is to be found ?
Nor are the Pagan Clergy free from the fame
vile Pra6tices, namely, to forge Apparitions to con-
firm their Delufions j and the Hiftory of all Coun-
tries are full of Accounts of it, too many to repeat
here.
The
of APPARITIONS. 3<Ji
The PofTeflions and Exorcifms in the difmal
Story of the D£'vils of Loudon^ are full of Appari-
tions and Vifions, by which the wretched Fraud
was carried on, and by which fo much Villany was
pra6tis'd, as is almoft without Example •, a Story
which has already fill'd a Book, and is extant in
many Languages 5 a Fraud not out-done by the
Brachmans and Priefts of the Pagans in China^ or
in Japan.
I MIGHT next entertain you with fham Appa-
ritions put in Pradice by the Devil himfelf, in thofe
Countries where he has made himfelf be worfhip-
ped as a God, and where he fnpports all the Devil-
worfhip by Apparition 3 fhowing himfelf now one
way, now another, as he finds it for his Purpofej
appearing one Day in Fire and Flame, at another
time in Storm and Tempeft, at a third time in Humane
and Familiar Shape; and in all the End is to keep up
the Dread of his Perfon in the Minds of his Worfhip-
pers, and to preferve a Reverence to his Inftitutions,
whatever they arc.
I F we may believe our Writers of Travels, and
Obfervers of Things, the Devil not only aflumes
Humane Shape, but infinuates himfelf in the real
Perfon of a Devil to the Women, and fo poflefTes
them, (to fay no more of it) as to commit
horrid namelefs WickednefTes with them, fuch as
are not to be fuggefted without Horror. In other
Places, the Apparition of the Devil is the Fund of
all their religious Worfhip, and he has Altars ere-
ded, and Sacrifices, nay, which is worfe, Human
Sacrifices off^ered to him.
I N thefe horrid Performances, he appears in ter-
rible Shapes, and the poor Natives are fo frighted
at him, that the Fear only excites the Homage
which tbey pay to him, and fecures to him an en-
tire Sovereignty : for Fear, may, for ought I know,
be the Charaderillick of a Pagan Worihip, as Love
is that of a Chriftian, The
3^2 The Hijiory and Reality
The Great Temple of Montezuma at Mexico
was little elfe but a horrible Butchery of Humane
Carcafles, the Blood of which lay fprinkled or
dafh'd againft the Walls, 'till it lay there har-
dened and congeal'd, if Report may be believ'd, a-
bove a Foot thick, and that they facrifiz'd at lead
twentythoufand People a Year, m that one Pagodc
or Temple.
The Indians confefs'd, that they had frequent
Apparitions among them of the Spiritis, which they
called by feveral Names 5 and that the Great
Spirit, that is the Devil^ alfo appeared to them up-
on their Great Feftivals, in bright and extraordi-
nary Apparition i to approve and accept of their
Worfhip and Homage, and no doubt of their Sa-
crifices too.
I N Cochin China we are told the Devil goes far-
ther y for he not only fhows himfelf in Apparition,
but he utters lying Oracles, even himfelf in his pro-
per Perfon, and alfo whifpcrs fuch Anfwers to the
Priefls, as ferve to keep up a Decorum in their
Worfhip, and a fecret Reverence to his Perfon.
And Father Borri fays, the Devil walks about there
fo frequently, and fo familiarly in Humane Shapes,
that they are not at all difturb'd at him.
At other times, as the fame Author affirms,
they affociate thcmfelves with particular Perfons,
upon various Occafions, and efpccially with the
Women, as above j fo that, in fhort, in fome Cities,
which are very populous, it would be fomething hard
to diftinguifh between the real People and the Ap-
paritions. How far, if it were examined into, it
would not be the like among us, I won't pretend to
fay.
Who knows, in our Throngs of divided Chri-
ftians, whether he meets with a Saint or an Appa-
rition ; whether he talks with a Counfellor or a Devil ?
^nd the art of difcerning would indeed be well
worth
of APPARITIONS. 3(^3
worth having J indeed, it would be worth buying,
if Money would purchafe it. The Devil's Difguifes
are very many, and Apparition is one. of the beft
of them, becaufe he can foon change Shapes, and
change Poftures, which in other Cafes he may find
lefs advantageous to his Intereft. Nor is it eafy
for Mankind to come to the Certainty, even when
he fees an Apparition, whether ic be a Good or an
Evil Appearance 5 and the beft way of finding it
out, except that of judging by the Errand becomes
on, and which I have mention'd already, is to ask
it the Queftion dire&ly > if it equivocates and
/huffles, conclude 'tis the Devil -^ for he is a Sharper,
and a Diflembler from the Beginning : if 'tis a good
Spirit, it will anfwer you diredly and honeftly, and
tell you its Bufinefs at once 5 and this is what I
mean, where I fay. Speak to it.
J F you find it is a good Spirit hearken to it; if
the Devil^ defie it; and whether it be a good or
evil Spirit, fear it not-y for both are under the fpe-
cial Dire6l:ion and Authority of him that made the
World, and will govern it, in whofe Hands you
are; and 'tis well it is fo; For as Good is above
Evil, fo God is above the Devil. Tell him fo",
and bid him Defiance, and if you can but do ic
with a good Heart he's gone; depend upon ir,
he'll never Hand you, Probatum eft. But I muft
leave off the religious Cheats, for they mc endlefs;
'tis time to talk of Apparitions of another nature,
lefs fcrious, and lefs tirefome to hear of.

AS the Devil is not fo Black as he is Painted,
fo neither does he appear in fo many Shapes
as we make for him 5 we Drefs him up in more
Suits of Cloaths, and more Mafquerade Habits, than
ever he wore 5 and I queftion much, if he was to
fee the Pi6i:ures and Figures which we call Devil,
whether he would know himfelf by fome of them
or no.
It would require more Skill than, I doubt, I
am Mafter of, to bring you all to a right Method
of thinking upon this Subie61: ; however I fhall
venture upon it by way of Eflay, that you may
form fuch Images of the old Gentleman in your
Mind, that you may not be cheated about him,
may know him when you fee him, may not call
him out of his Name, or bellow his Right Wor-
(hipful Titles upon another.
It is obfervable, that tho' moft People in all
Parts of the World allow there is fuch a thing as a
Devil, an evil Spirit, an Arch-Enemy of Mankind;
and they are pretty near one another in their feve-
ral Notions of him j for even thofe Savages that
worfhip him, acknowledge they do fo only that he
may not hurt them -, yet they differ exceedingly in
their Ideas of his Perfon, and that almoft every
where} and accordingly it follows that they muft
differ in their Reprefentations and Piftures of him.

I HAVE heard oF fome Pagans who worfhip
a black Cloud for the Devil^ becaufe it often fpcaks
in Noifes, and breaches out Fire. J cannot fay but
worfhipping the Sun for a God^ and the Thunder
and Lightening for a Devil, feems to me to have
more Senfe in it than many of the other Branches of
Idolatry in the World; the one being the moll
natural refemblance of the greateft Good, and the
other of the greateft Evil in the World,
Some, I am told, refemble or reprefent the
De^il by a vaft great Globe of Wood carv'd or
cut all over into Mouths, defcrib'd in a thou-
fand different Diftortions, gaping, grining, and vo-
racious Figures; all intimating a greedy unquench-
able Thirli or Appetite to devour and deftroy 5
rolling itfcif continually about, fo that fome of its
thoufand of Mouths bemg undermoft, are always
gaping and biting, and taking m fomething, but
ever unfatisfy'd, the reft of 'em gaping ftiil for
more. If this hideous Reprefentation is not juft
to his Form, I think verily it is juft to his Nature,
and is very Emblematick : the Thoughts it gives
Birth to in our Fancy, may not be fo remote as are
form'd by thofe fimpie, Coraick, and yet wou'd-be-
frightful Draughts we draw of him; with a Cock's
Bill, Afs's Ears, Goat's Horns, glaring Eyes, Batts
Wings, cloven Foot, and Dragon's rail ; not one
of which, except the laft, having either Antiquity
or Authority for them, that I know of.
It's true, he is defcrib'd in the Apocalypfe as a
great red Dragon, and in another Place as a Beaft,
but neither of them give us any true Idea of his
real Form.
Now
^66 The Hijiory and Reatity
Now if we do not know his Figure, how ihall
we know him in Apparition? for if we know no-
thing of his real Shape, how fliall we judge of him
in his Difguife? How {hall we fingle him out up-
on Occafion? Suppofe we were to look for hitn
at a Mafqueradej For my Part I cannot deny but
I might miftake him, and picch upon a Prieft, or
a Turk, a Tinker or a Tarpaulin, and fay this is
the Devil^ or that is the Devil^ as foon as the real
Hydra-pater himfelf, and let him pafs perhaps for a
No'hody worth taking Notice of.
A s then, Ifay^ we have fuch unguided Notions
of him, and know him fo little in any of his un-
couth Figures and Difgiiifes, 'tis not fo much won-
der that we miftake every ugly mif-fhapcn mon-
Itrous Thing, and call it by his venerable Name.

or fay?
A SOBER grave Gentleman, who muft not wear

370 The Hijiory and Reality
flemper in his Mind than a real Deficiency of Brains,
had, by a long Difufe of the fprightly Part of his
Senfe, which he really had no want of at other
times, fufFer'd himfclf to (ink a little too low in
his Spirits, and let the Hypochondria emit too ftrong-
ly in Vapour and Fumes up into his Head. This
had its Fits and its Intervals jfometimes he was clear-
fighted, and clear-headed, but at other times he faw
Stars at Noon-day, and Devils at Night: In
a word, the World was an Apparition to his Ima-
gination, when xht Flatus prevail'd, and the Spleen
boil'd up ; of all which he could give no account,
nor could he affift the Operation of Phyfick by any
of his own. Powers towards a Cure.
It happened that he was abroad at a Friend's
Houfe later than ordinary one Night, but being
Moon-light, and a Servant with him, he was eafy,
and was obferved to be very chearful, and even
Merry^ with a great deal of good Humour, more
than had been obferved of him for a great while be-
fore.
He knew his Way perfeftly well, for it was
within three Miles of the Town where he liv'd,
and he was very well mounted > but tho' the Moon
was up, an Accident which a little diforder'd him
was, that it was not only cloudy, but a very thick,
black Cloud came fuddenly, (that is to fay, without
his Notice, fo it was fuddenly to him) and fpread
over his Head, which made it very dark } and to
add to the Diforder, it began to rain violently.
Upon this, being very well mounted, as I have
faid, he refolved to ride for it, having not above
two Miles to the Town 5 fo clapping Spurs to his
Horfe, he gallop'd away. His Man, whofe Name
was Gervaisj not being fo well mounted, was a good
way behind. The Darknefs and the Rain together
put him a little out of Humour j but as that
was
'/r'^^///.y^/- .A'^,/^ J'a/7.;^yp
of A P P ARITI NS. 371
was a little unexpe6led perhaps it made him ride
the harder, rather than abated his Pace.
In the Way there was a fmall River, but there
was a good Bridge over it, well walled on both
fides 5 fo that there was no Danger there, more than
any where elfe: But the Gentleman kept on his
fpeed to go over the Bridge, when being rather more
than half over, his Horfe flopt on a fudden, and re-
fufed,as we call it, bearing off to the right hand 3 he
faw nothing at firft, and was not much difcompos'd
at it, but fpurr'd his Horfe to go forward j the
Horfe went two or three Steps, then flopt again,
fnorted, and flared, and then offer'd to turn fhorc
back 5 then the Gentleman looking forward to fee
what was the matter, and if he could obferve what
the Horfe was feared at, faw two broad flaring Eyes,
which, as he faid, look'd him full in the Face.
Then he was heartily frighted indeed 5 but by
this time he heard his Man Gervais coming up.
When Gervais came near, the firfl thing he heard
his Mailer fay, was Blefs me^ it is the Devil!
at which Gervais^ a low-fpirited Fellow, was as
much frighted as his Mailer. However, his Mailer,
a little encouraged to hear his Man fo near him,
prefs'd his Horfe once more, and call'd aloud to Ger^
vais to come j but he, as I faid, being frighted too,
made no haile : at length with much ado his Mafter,
fpurring his Horfe again, got over the Bridge, and
paiTed by the Creature with broad Eyes, which (the
Light a little encreaiing)hcaffirm'dpoiicivcly, when
he was pafs'd, was a great black Bear, and confe-
quently muil be the DeviL
Tho' Ger'vais was near enough, yet fearing his
Mailer would fet him to go before, he kept as far
ofFas he could : When his Mailer caird he an-
fwer'd indeed, but did not come on, at leail did not
make mnch haile > but feeing his Mailer was gone
pail, and that he himfelf was then obliged to fol-

The Hiftory and Reality
low, he went on foftly, and when he came to the
Bridge, he faw what it was his Mailer's Horfe fnorted
at, and refufed to go on j of which you ihall hear
more prefently.
His Mafter's Horfe being got pad: the Difficul-
ty, needed no Spurs, but (as frighted Horfes will)
Hew away like the Wind 5 and the Rain continu-
ing, his Mailer, who on many Accounts was wil-
ling to be at home, let him go> fo that he was at
home and got into the Houfe, long before his Man
jfervais could get up with him.
The Mailer, as lx)on as he came into the Light,
fwoon'd away, and the Fright had had fuch an ef-
fe6lupon him, that when with much Difficulty they
had brought him to himfelf, he continued very ill j
and when his Lady, and a Siiler he had in the
Houfe with him, as much over-run with the Hy^po
as himfelf, came to enquire what had happened to
him, he^ told them a formal Story, that at fuch a
Bridge he met the Devil y that he placed himfelf
juil at the coming ofF from the Bridge, on
his left hand, at the Corner of the Wall 5 that he
flood and flared in his Face, and that he could di-
ilindly perceive it was the Devil in the Shape of a
Bear: He gave other Defcriptions, fo pun£lual and
particular, that there was no room to doubt but it
was an Apparition, and that it was in the Shape
of a great Bear.
GERFAIS came home foon after, and going in-
to the Stable diredlly, as was his Bufinefs, to take care
of his Mailer's Horfe as well as his own, there he told
the Story his Way, among the other Servants, and
efpecially two or three Grooms, and Servants belong-
ing to Gentlemen that were Neighbours j and he
tells them, that his Mafler was in great danger of
being thrown over the Wall of the Bridge, for
that his Horfe was frighted at an Afs which flood
juft at the Corner of the Walh and it was my
Fault
of APPARITIONS. 37J
Fault indeed, fays Gervals, for it was a young Horfe,
and I had never told my Maflerj but it was a Trick
he had got that he could not abide an Afs, and
would by no means come near one if he could help it.
And are you fure 'twas an Afs, Gervais ? fays the
other Servants, llaring at one another as if they were
frighted: Are you fure of it? Yes, fays Gervais^ for
asfoon as my Mailer got by it, I rid up to it and
threfh'd it with my Stick, and it fell a braying,
which you know, fays Gervais^ is a bafe ugly Noife,
and fo I came away and left it.
Why Gervais^ fay they, your Mafter believes
it was the Bevil^ as really as if he had fpoken to it.
I'm forry my Mafter fhould be fo frighted, fays
Jervais', but I am very fure it was nothing but an
J^fs. But the Story had gotten Vent, and the firit
Part of it flew all over the Town that Mr.
had feen the Z)m/, and was almoft frighted to
Death.
Then came his Man Jarvis's Tale, and made
it appear that Mr. -'s llrange and wonderful
Apparition was dwindled into an Afs, and that the
Devil he had ieen in the Shape of a Bear was no
more than a poor Boricco^ as the Italians call him j
this made his Mafter be laught at fufficiently.
However, poor Jarvis or Gervais was fain to
turn out, and loft his Place for its and the wife
Mr.—— to this Day infifts upon it, that 'twas
the Devil, and he knew him by his broad Eyesj
the' 'tis known that a Bear has very little Eyes : but
'tis impoffible to perfvvade any Vapouridi Body,
that they have not (een the Devil, if they have but
feen fomething, and that they arc very fure, they arc
not fure what it is.
I REMEMBER a Dclufion almoft as grof^, the
Memory of which 1 believe remains for a Truth

tertaincd a Notion5from the following Paflagc, that
a Ghofl walk'd in fuch a Place j that fhe (for it
was an antient Lady lately dead) was feen hovering
about the Manfion-houfe which was left uninha^
bitcd for fome time, that fhe would be up and down
in the Houfe very often, in the Day-time, making
a rumbling, and a clattering Noifej and in the
Night-time flie walk'd in the neighbouring Fields
with a Candle in her Hand, and that tho' the Wind
blew ever fo hard, it would not blow the Candle
out J that fometimes ihe would appear in the open
Field, fometimes up in the Trees, and particularly
there was a little Heath near Barking called the
Cotman Deauy where it was faid llie was frequently
feen.
There was a Boarding-fchool of Boys in that
Town, where there was in particular fome roguiih
London Boys, who contrived all this Walking from
theBeginning to theEnd > Firft, they got a fmall Rope,
and tying one end of it to an old Chair which flood
in an upper Room of the Houfe, (for they had
found means to get in and out of the Houfe at
pleafure) they brought the other end of the Rope
down on the Out-fide of the Houfe in a private
Place where it could not eafily be feen, and by
this they pulled the old Chair up, and then let it
fall down again, and made a great Noife in the
Houfe, fo as it might be eafily heard by the Neigh-
bours 5 then other Boys of the fame Gang took care
to call out to the old Women in the nex;t Houfes,
that now they might hear the old Lady a playing
her Pranks j and accordingly they would all air
femble in the Court-yard, where they could plainly
hear it, but not one would venture to go up Stairs.
If any offered to go up a little way, then all was
quiet again J but as foon as ever they retired, the
rumbling would begin again ; This was for the
Pay-
of AP P A R IT 10 NS. 37J
I N the Night, one of thefe unlucky Boys had
gotten a dark Lanthorn, which was a thing the
Country People did not underftand, and with this
he walk'd all about the Orchard, and two or three
Clofcs near the Houfe, fometimes (hewing the Light
on this fide, and then his Comrades calling all the
old Women about 'em to fee it, on a fudden the
Light would go out, the Boy clofing up the Lan-
thorn 5 and then he would run fwiftly crofs the whole
Field, and fhew his Light again on the other fide.
Now he would be up in a Tree, then in the Road,
then upon the middle of the Heath j To that the
Country People made no more Queilion, but that
the old Lady walk'd with a Candle in her Hand,
than that they faw the Light of it > and in a word,
it pafs'd for an Apparition as certainly as we on
the other hand knew what Knavery agitated it all.
It muftbe confefs'd that a dark Lanthorn, join'd
with an Enthufiaftick Head, might prevail to make
fuch a Sham take, with weak and bigotted Peo-
ple, and they were mighty willing to fay before-
hand that they were fure fomething walk'd.
When they heard the Chair tumble about in
the Chamber, tho' pulled by a String and no body
near it, no nor in the whole Houfe, the People who
came together in the Court-yard, fancy'd often the
faw Heads of People moving up and down the
Room where the Noife was, and one faid pofitively

But to realize the Delufion, one cry'd our.
There's the Spirit, there's the Ghoft, juft at fuch a

ptorily to the Place, declaring that ihe fees it plain-

the Ghoft walks and the Houfe is haunted, and for
^ long time ic is believ'd no other \ when here
B b 4 was
37^ T'he Hijiory ayid Reality
was nothing but the mean Contrivance of a few
Boys.
The Notion of Spirits appearing to dtfcover
where Money has been buried, to direft People
'
to dig for it, has fo univerfally prevailed with Wo-
mankind, I might fay and even with Mankind too,
that it is impoflfible to beat it out of their Heads j
and if they ihould fee any thing which they call
an Apparition, they would to this Day follow it,*in
hope to hear it give a Stamp on the Ground, as
with its Foot, and then vanifh j and did it really do
fo, they would not fail to dig to the Center (if they
were able) in hopes of finding a Pot of Money hid
there, or fome old Urn with Afhes and Roman Me-
dals y in fhort, or fome confiderable Treafure.
A COUNTRY Gentleman had an old-built Houfe,
which was the Remains of an old Demolifhed Mo-
naftery or Religious Houfe, and he refolved to have
it puird down, but thought the Charge too much
to beftow5 fo he bethought himfelf of a Stratagem,
which was to give it out that the Houfe was haunt-
ed, and this he did fo artificially, that it began to
be currently believed 5 for he made a Fellow drefs
himfelf up in White, and pafsfwiftly crofs the inner
Court of the Houfe, juft at a time when he had
appointed others to be at the Window to fee it.
They gave Notice to the Houfe that there was
an Apparition \ then the Mafter and Miftrefs and all the
Family were called up to the Window, where, tho*
it was fo dark that they could not diftinguifh what
he was, yet they plainly faw the thing in white
go crofs the Yard, and in at a Door of the old
Building j foon after it was in they perceiv'd
a Flafh of Fire in the Houfe, which was contriv'd
that the Fellow fhould make with fome Brimflonc
and other Materials on purpofe, fo that it fliould
leave a Stench of Sulphur behind it, but not be juft
the Smell of Gunpowder.
As
of A?P ARiriONS. 377
A s he expefted, it began to work % fome fanciful
People having notice of ir, and being defirous to
fee the fame Apparition, had the occafion offered
them, and faw it in its ufual manner of fhowing ic
felf5 its frequent walking was ordinary, at one pare
of the Houfe where the Spirit had an opportunity
to flip out at a Door into another Yard, and fointo
the dwelling Houfe 5 and when it went off thac
way it gave a great ftamp with its Foot, and im-
mediately it was gone.
Upon this it was prefently faid there was Mo-
ney hid, and the Gentleman gave it out that he
would dig there for it, and mighty eager People
were to have it done j however the Gentleman
feem'd to cool in the matter: flill the Apparition
was {ttn to come and go, walk to and again, almolt
every Night, and ordinarily it vanifh^d in a flaili of
Fire as above, which in a word was very extraor-
dinary.
At length fome of the Towns People in the
Village adjoyning, finding the Gentleman began to
flight or negleft it, gave out, that if Efquire •
would give them leave, they would dig, for thac
certainly Money was hid xhere> nay if he would
confent they fhould have it if they found it, they
would dig for it and find it too, tho' they digg'd
the whole Houfe down.
The Gentleman reply'd, that was not fair for
them to pull his Houfe down and have all they
found too, that was too hard j but he would con-
fent to this, That provided they would carry
away all the Rubbilh, and all the Materials which
they dug down, and pile up the Bricks and Timber
in the Yard near the Houfe, and would be content
with half they found, he would give them leave
to dXg,
Well, they confented, and to work they
wentj the Spirit or Apparition which appcar'd at
firfl
ijg The Hijiory and Reality
iirft feem'd to point out the Place, and the firft
thing they took down was a great (lack of Ghim-
nies, and a heavy piece of work ic was> but the
GentlemanjWilling to encourage them, fecretly hid
feven and twenty Pieces of old Gold in a hole in
the Chimney, which had no entrance into it but
by one paflage, which he Brick'd up.
When they came to this Money they were
pp-feftly deluded, and out of their Wits; the Gen-
tleman happen'd to be near, but not jult upon the
Spot when it was found, and he being caird, very
frankly gave it them all 5 but upon Condition they
fhould not expe6t the like, if they found any more.
I N a word,this Bite made the Country Fellows work
like Horfes, and more came into the knot 5 but that
which encourag'd them farther was, they did really
find feveral things of Value in the pulling down the
Houfe, which perhaps had lain hid from the time
of Demolifhing it as a religious Houfej and fomc
Money was found tooj but continual eXpeftation
and hope of finding more fo animated the Fellows,
that in fhort they pull'd the whole Houfe down
5
my, I might fay they puird it up by the Roots,
for they dug up the very Foundations, which was
what the Gentleman defir'd, 'and would have given
a great deal of Money to have had done.
Nor did they leave the Houfe in a heap of
Rubbifh 5 but, according to his Agreement with
them, they carried the Materials away, and fet up
the Timber and old Bricks in an adjacent Yard as
he direded them, and in good order too.
So violent was the Perfuafion, that (upon this
fancy'd iVpparition walking in the Houfe) Money
was hid there, that nothing could ftop the eager-
nefs of the Country People in working j as if the
Souls of the old Nuns or Friars, or whatever they
were who had hid any Treafure there, fuppofing
any was hid, could not be at Reft, as was faid in
other

finding it fo many Years afterward, being almoft
two hundred Years.
I F they could fuppofe any thing fo weak, where
muft they fuppofe thofe Departed Souls or Ghofts
could have been, during all that time? and why did
they not appear before? what had all the Ages be-
tween done to be fo much lefs in their Favour, that
they did not come to difcover this Money to
them ? but that the Depofit fliould remain untr
Ground fo long, without any enquiry after t,
'till this Age, not at all more worthy than their
Anceftors, fhould be inform'd of it.
There is not a thing in Nature fo generally
receiv'd, which has fo little Foundation, either in
Reafon or Religion, either in Nature or common
Senfe j it feems not only abfurd, but ridiculous ;
there is not only no religious Reafon in it, but it
is inconfiftent with it felf : what feems only won-
derful and unaccountable in it is, that fuch grois
things fhould make fuch Impreflions, and that ic
fhould be fo impolfible to beat it out of the Heads
of the pofTefs'd People.
If you fhould offer to tell them that no hidden
Money was ever thus difcover'd, they would laugh
at it as the greatefl Jefl imaginable, and tell you
there were five hundred Examples to the contrary 5
and yet in all my Search after thofe things, and after
evidence of Fa6t, I cannot arrive to one Example,
where ever an Apparition dire6ted to the finding
Money hid in the Ground or Earth, or any other
place, and that any Authentick Voucher has been
brought to prove it. I know there have been many,
perhaps thoufands,of fuch Stories told, and the Parti-
culars are handed down with them > but I fay I never
met with any Authentick Proof of the Fa6t, fuch
as that the Story might be told after them for Truth,
^nd that a Man might fay without Bluihing that he
believ'd
'
The Hijiory and Reality
believ'd it. And let us but enter a little into the
ufual manner in which thofe Tales are related,
there feems to be fomething fo weak and filly in
the telling, as if it was only calculated for Children
and Chimney corners; for Example 5 the Apparition
is caird a Ghofl, 'tis drefs'd up (to fuit the weak-
nefs of the Imagination) in a Shrowd, as if it came
juft out of the Coffin and the Church-yard, and as
if the Habit of the Dead was a(rum'd,to poflefs the
People with the Fancy of its being really the dead
Body of the Perfon, and yet allow it at the fame
time to be a Spirit.
Well, when it comes, and (be it what you
will) forms it felf in Apparition, all in white, and
in a Shroud J what is next? it fays nothing to you,
but goes away before you > and perhaps fpeaks and
bids you go or come along with it, or perhaps
without fpeaking at all, leading and beckoning the
Parties they have appeared to, to follow them, and
then ftamping with the Foot it difappears at
once.
This Stamp with the Foot is reckoned to be a
Direftion to you to dig juft there, in order to find
fome extraordinary Treafure 5 and he would be
reckon'd very flupid and fordidly dull that (hould
negled the Dire6bion, and not dig there > and many
a vain and fruitlefs Pit has been dug on fuch occa-
fions, to no purpofe at all.
But that I may not declare my Infidelity in
thefe things in an unreafonable manner, and disbe-
lieve without any jud Reafon ; let me give you a
long Story, which feems to be left upon Record, of
a Pedlar in the Town of in Suffolk^ a
Story believ'd as certainly as the Gofpel 5 and which
it would be thought very abfurd for any one to
queftion the Truth of.
There was a Pedlar, fays the Story ^ who us'd
to travel about the Country with his Pack, but
kepc
of APP ARiriO NS. 381
Jcepc a Chamber or Ware-houfc in the Market-
Town for the depofiting and laying-upfome Goods
which he had there, and which were too many at
a time to carry them all about with him.
I T happened that this Man having been abroad
late, and coming home with his Pack, fat himfelf
down upon a Stile, refling his Pack at the fame
time for his Eafe: while he fat here, there came up
to him a Ghoft, in the Appearance of a Woman
drefs'd as above 5 fhe came up to him with a fmiling
Countenance, and w^hen fhe difcover'd her felf fhe
ilept backward, and holding up a fine white Hand
beckoned to him with a Finger to follow her.
The Pedlar, frighted as he was, immediately
followed the z^pparition 5 (what he did in the mean
time with his Pack that's a gap in the Story, whiich
Tradition has not fupply'd 5) the Apparition leads
him in this manner, going backward and beckon-
ing with her Hand over two or three Fields, 'till it
came to a particular place, where there lay a great
Stone, and there giving a ftamp with its Foot it
vanifhed.
The Man takes the hint, marks the Stone,
goes home to carry his Pack, as we ought to fup-
pofe, and comes out the next Night with a Spade
and a Pick Axe, and goes to work to dig a great
Pitt in the Earth.
He had not dug far itTeems, (tho' the Story does
not fay exprefly how far) but he found a large
Cheft 5 I fay large, for it could not be a fmall one,
by what you fhall hear prcfently.
He doubled his Diligence when he came to the
Chefl, and with great Labour at length got it out
of the place 5 and we may fuppofe was not long be-
fore he found means to fplit it open, and get into
the infide of it to fee the Contents j for he found
it very heavy when he labour'd to get it out.
In
38
1
The Hifiory and Reality
I N a word, he found the Cheft full of Silver,
that is to fay, full of Money j then keeping his
own Council, he took care to depofite it fo, that
by fome and fome he got the Money all fafe home,
and after that carried the Cheft home alfo.
What the Sum was that he found here,the Story
is not particular inj but it fcems the bulk was fuch,
that the Pedlar thought fit to leave off his travel-
ling about the Country as a Pedlar, takes a Houfc
in the Town, furnifhes himfelf a Shop,and becomes
a fettled Inhabitant and Shop-keeper. During his
appearing in this Figure,it happen'd that the Parifh
Church being exceeding old and out of Repair, the
Parifhioners, (whether by order ofthe Diocefan up-
on a Vifitation, or by the voluntary adt and deed of
thicmfelves the Parifliioners,! know not,) refolv'd to
Repair the Church.
1 N order to furnifli the needful Sums for this
good Work, they call a Veftry, and propofe a Sub-
fcription of the Inhabitants, for fupporting the Ex-
penpe> fo the Minifter and Church-Wardens go
about from Houfe to Houfe to fee what the Chari-
table Parifhioners would contribute, and among the
reft they at length came to the Pedlar's (now Shop-
keeper's) Houfe, and he being told their Bufmefs
defires them to walk in.
After fome Difcourfe, and perhaps treating
his Neighbours, he asks for their Roll or Subfcrip-
tion Paper, in order to fubfcribej looking over the
Roll he fees Sir Thomas ^'^o. Pounds, another
Gentleman ^v^ Pounds, another ten Pounds, another
forty Shillings,and fo on : Come,fays he, give a poor
Pedlar the Fen and Ink-, Will your Gentry fub-
fcribe no more than that ? fo he takes the Pen, and
fubfcribes iis^ and twenty Pounds.
Some time after this, having Occafion to make
a Hatch to his Shop-Door, as in the Country is
very frequent, it happen'd, that fending for a Work-
f man
of AP P ARITIO N S.
man to make this Hatch, and looking about among
his old Lumber, he found nothing fo proper as the
old Cheft that the Money was found in, and ac-
cordingly a Hatch was made of it.
A-wHiLE after this, as the Pedlar was fitting
in his Shop, he obferv'd an Ancient Gentleman
who liv'd in the Town, and who had the Reputa-
tion of a Scholar, and particularly of a great Anti-
quary, flood poring very earneftly, with his Spe6ta-
cles on, upon his new Hatch: This brought the
Pedlar to the Door, who after waiting a good
while to fee what it was the old Gentleman had
difcover'd, at laft he ask'd him what it was he
found upon his new Hatch,that was worth fo much
of his notice.
Truly Neighbour, fays the Gentleman^ what
I obfervc is very remarkable, tho' I cannot tell the
Meaning of it 5 and I fuppofe 'tis in a Chara^Ser
that you cannot eafily read, as well as in a Lan-
guage that you may not underftand.
The Pedlar defir'd he would read it to him.
Why, fays the Gentleman^ you do not underftand
it, when I have read it.
But Sir, fays the Pedlar^ can you npt tell the
meaning of it in Englijh ?
Why, fays the old Gentleman^ it is the 'old Saxon
Englifb in the ancient Gothic Charafter, and it may
be read thus,
Where "this once flood
Stands another twice as g&od.
Hum! fays the Pedlar^ that's old ftuff indeed:
what can that fignify ?
Nay, [ays the old Gentleman^ that I don't know,
for who can tell where this flood ?
^
A y, who indeed ? fays the Pedlar : and if they
did, what can there be in that ?
They
J 84 ^^ Hijiory md Reality
They had a little more Chat of that kind 5 but
in iliort the Pedlar got rid of his old Gentleman as
foon as he could, and began to ruminate upon the
thing 5 where this flood I Why I know well enough,
fays he to hlmfelf^ where this flood 31 I muft go and
fee, it may be there is fome more of the fame.
But then he argued, why this is fo many Years
ago (fix or feven at lead, it feems) and if it was a;
Ghoft or Spirit that ihow'd me the way to it, I
warrant fhe has fhow'd fome body elfe the way ta
the reft: Indeed I did not deferve it, that I did noc
look farther when I was at itj to befure it's gone
by this time.
Thus he argued himfelf almoft out of the
thing again, 'till at length he told his Wife of it,
who it feems had been in the Secret before.
Why, you are mad, fiiys fl^e^ why don't you go-
immediately to the place ?
Nay, fays he^ I don't know whether I can find
it again or no, now.
What, fays his Wife^ muft the Devil come to
fhow it you again ? fure you an't fo dull, but you
may find it again.
'
Well, the Man went however; indeed his
Wife drove him out almoft, Go, try, fays Jhe^ you
can but come without it.
H E goes, and found the place in general, but
could not diftinguifli the particular Spot, which
was levell'd partly by himfelf when he fill'd up the
Hole again, and partly grown up with Grafs and
Weeds 5 fo he comes back again, and tells his Wife,
he could not tell which was the Place, fo as to be
particular enough to go to Work.
Well, fays his Wife^ go in the Night 5 I war--
rant you the good Bevil that fliow'd you the firft
will put you in fome way to find the reft, if there
is any more.
So
of APP ARiriONS. 38y
So prevaird with by his Wife's Importunity
away he went, and I think they fay his Wife wenc
with himj being come to the Place, the Ap-
parition appear'd to them again, and Ihow'd them,
in the fame manner as before, the very Spotj and
then vanifh'd.
I N fhort, the Man went to work, and digging
a little deeper than he did before, he found ano-
ther Cheft or Coffer, bounded about with Iron, not
fo big as the other, but richer 3 for as the firll was
full of Silver, fo this was full of Gold.
They carry'd it home with Joy enough, as you
may fuppofe, and opening it, found (as above) a very
great Treafure. Fame has not handed down the
Sum J but fomcthing may be guefs*d at by the latter
part of the Story, which is told thus.
It feems that all this while the Repair of the
Church (mention'd above) went on but flowlyj ac-
cording to the old Saying, it was Church-JVork-y and
a Veftry being call'd upon fome other Church-
work, the Pedlar, who was prefent among the reft
of his Neighbours, took occafion to complain, that
he thought that Bufinefs was not honeftly manag'd,
that it was indeed like Church-Work^ carried on
heavily.
Some of the Gentlemen took him up a little,
and told him, he took too much upon him 5 that it
was none of his Affair j that he was not \\\
Truft for the Work 5 that they to whom it was
committed knew their Bufinefs, and that he fhould
let it alone, and mind his Shop.
He anfwer'd, it was true, that he was not trufl:-
ed with it, if he had, it fhould have been finifhed
before now; and that he had a right to complain,
becaufe he paid to it as well as other People; ad-
ding, that if they did not difpatch, he would com-
plain to the Biflpp, and obtain another Vification.
Cq Tms
38^ The Hifiory and Reality
This alartn'd the People entrufted, fo they
gave him good Words, and told him, the truth
was, the Parifli Stock was almoft gone, and that
they had not Money to go on, 'till the Gentlemen
would come into a fecond Colleftion.
Say you fo ? fays the Pedlar j there may be fome
Reafon in thatj you can't go on indeed without
Money J but pray how much do you want?
They told him it would coft near two hundred
Pounds more to finfh it, and do but indifferently
neither > for the Roof wanted to be taken off, and
they feared the Timber was rotten, and would require
fo much i^ddition, they were afraid to look into it.
In a word, he bid the Church-wardens call a
Veftry upon that particular Affair, and he would
put them in a way to finilh it.
A Vestry was call'dj the Pedlar told them,
that feeing they were poor, and could not raife
Money to go on with it, they fhould leave it to
him, and he would finifh it for them.
Accordingly he took the Work upon
himfelf, laid out near a Thoufand Pounds, and al-
moft new-built the Church j in Memory of which,
on the Glafs-windows, there ftand the Figures of
the Pedlar and his Pack, and (as the People fancy)
there is alfo the Apparition beckoning to him, to
come to the Place where he dug up the Money.
Thus far the Story. How Tradition came to
hand it down to us in this manner, and fo turn it
into a Fable, I have nothing to do withj but the real
and more probable Part of the Tale is recorded thus.
That there was a Petber, fo the old Englijh
calls him, that is a Pedlar^ who having long ufecl
to travel up and down the Country with his
Horfe, and his Wife, and himfelf, all three loaded
with their Goods, and going from Houfe to Houfe
for many Years, was grown rich, by hislnduitryj
and that being too old to continue the laborious
Part,
of APPARITIONS.
Part, he took a Lodging, firftin the Town, and fold
his Goods in a Chamber, and in the Markets only,
but afterward took a Houfe and a Shop in the Mar-
ket-place, and drove a great Trade.
That growing thus to be very rich, he con*
tributed, upon their firfl coming about for a Sub-
fcription, twenty five Pounds towards the Repair
of the Church \ and after that, finding they want-
ed Money to finifh it, took the Work wholly in-
to his own Hand, and finifh'd the Church at his
own Charge J and that the Pariih, in Gratitude to
his Memory, caufed that Figure of the Pedlar to be
painted upon the Glafs, where the Pedlar and his
Pack is reprefented in one Place travelling about
the Country, by which he got his Living.
In another Place, there are Workmen digging
the Foundation of the Church, and the Pedlar
giving them Dircftions what to do, and how to
proceed; and in another, the Church is built up a
great way, and almoft to the Roof, and the Pedlar
itill direfting.
In another Place, an Angel is painted flanding
by the Pedlar, and pointing with a Rod or Staff in
his Hand, to a Place where the PedJar fets two
Workmen to dig.
Now from the Pedlar's being grown fo uncx-
peftdly rich, common Fame it feems raifed a Re-
port, that he had found a Cheft of Money in the
Ground, and after that another. It feems alfo,
there is an Original for the two Verfes too, which
is thus : when the Pedlar had firft contributed
twenty five Pounds towards building the Church,
and yet the Parifhoners told him, they could not
go on for want of Money; he told them they
mould not be difcouraged, he had given them one
Bag of Money, and, fays he, nuhere that ftood^ fiands
mother twice as good: Til do it my fclf.
C C Z HSNCB
388 The Hijlory and Reality
Hence they thought the Pedlar mull: certainly
have found Tome Money that had been hid in the
Ground, and that the De'vil had difcover'd it to
him 5 and fo came the whole Story to grow up by
little and litde into the Form as I have told itj and
now to confirm it farther, they tell us the Angel,
which perhaps might be but indifferently painted
on the Glafs, or on the Wall of the Church, is
taken for the Ghoft that difcover'd the two Chefts
of Money to the Pedlar, and is ihowing where to
dig for it.
Thus the Story of an Apparition is handed on
to Pofterity, and now 'tis as currently believ'd in
the Country, almoft as the Gofpelj and any Man
would be thought very bold, that fhould pretend
to contradidl it, or to fay that it is not true in e-
very Particular.
If all the Stories of Apparitions leading Peo-
ple to dig for Money, were as well trac'd as this, I
believe chey might be found as plainly fiftitious. In-
vention has been mighty fruitful upon this particu-
lar kind of Notion, that when Money is hidden
fome Spirit or Apparition will difcover it 5 as if the
Souls of thofe that hid the Money were difturb'dj
'till it was found out and made ufe of.
How abfurd the very Suggeftion it felfis, I can
hardly think worth while to fpeak of again j but
there are other Difficulties in it alfo, if an Appari-
tion knows of and difcovers this Money.
1. Why not difcover it fooncr? Why let it lie
in the Ground, fometimes two or three hundred
Years before it has been difcover'd ? and then an
Apparition comes, from none knows where, to bring
it to light.
2. Why is the Difcovery made to a Stranger,
and not to fome of the Line or Race of thofe to
whom the Money did at firil belong.^ One would
fuppofe the Apparition came, or was fent, or di--
reded
of APPARITIONS. 38^
reeled to come, todo Juftice,and to give the Money
loft to the right Owner j whereas thefc Difcoveries
arc often pretended to be made to Strangers, who
liave no Claim or any Right to it, or any Relation
to thofe who laid it there 5 and this indeed is unac-
countable, and makes the reft of the Story impro*
bable to be true.
3. If Ghofts, or Apparitions, and Spirits, or call
them what you will, are thus officious, and bufy to
difcover Money hid in the Earth, fo as to run up
and down to Strangers, who are no way related to
it, or to the Race or Families who were firft
concern'd in it> Why then do they not difcover
all the Money that is thus depofited in the Dark ?
and which no doubt is yet in great Quantities,
lodged out of the Reach of Mortal Sight, and of
which we find frequent Difcoveries made 5 as par-
ticularly a great Parcel of old Gold, found lately in
the digging up the old Foundation of a Houfe iii
Oxfordjhire. A great Parcel of Roman Gold Coin
and Medals found this very Year, in digging up an
old Vault in France^ and which muft have lain there
a thoufand Years at leaft, and no kind Apparition
came to difcover it in fo long time.
Many fuch Examples are daily fhown us of
Money found Under-ground, without the Help of
the Devil^ or of any Apparition, Spirit or Ghoft,
to difcover it, and which had lain, ever fince the
Time of the Romans^ conceal'd and unknown.
From all which Reafons I muft conclude, that
the departed Spirits know nothing of thefe things,
that it is not in their Power to difcover their old
Hoards of Money, or to come hither to {how us
how we may come at it 5 but that in fliort, all the old
Women's Stories, which we have told us upon
that Subjeft, are indeed old Women's Stories, and
no more.
3^0 The Hifiory and Reality
I CANNOT quit this part of my Subje£t with*
out obferving that, indeed, if we give up all the
Stories of Ghofts and Apparitions, and Spirits walk-
ing, to difcover Money that is hid, we fhall lofc
to the Age half the good old Tales, which fcrvc
to make up Winter Evening Converfation, and fhall
deprive the Doftrine of Souls departed coming
back hither to talk with us about fuch things, of its
principal Support 5 for this indeed is one of the
principal Errands fuch Apparitions come about.
1 T is without Doubr, that Fancy and Imagina-
tion form a world of Apparitions in the Minds of
Men and Women j (for we muft not exclude the
Ladies in this Part, whatever we do) and People go
away as thoroughly polTcfs'd with the Reality of
having fcen the Devil, as if they convers'd Face to
Face with him; when in fhort the Matter is no
more than a Vapour of the Brain> a fick delirious
fume of Smoke in the Hypochondria j forming it
felf in fuch and fuch Figure to the Eye- fight of the
Mind, as well as of the Head, which all look'd upon
with a calm Revifion, would appear, as it really is,
nothing but a Nothing, a Skeleton of the Brain,
a Whymfy, and no more*
So Hypochondriack Vafours reprefent
Ships, Armies, Battels, in the Firmament
:
*Till fteddy Sight the Exhalation folves.
And all to its fir
ft Matter Cloud dijfolves.
I T is out of Queftion that the Imagination formt
a great many of thefe Vifions in the Heads of the
People that relate them again to us 5 and they as
firmly believe them to be real Apparitions, as I be-
lieve them to be nothing but Vapours and Cloud*
But on the other hand it cannot be deny'd, but that
there is a ftrange Forwardnefs among our People
to
of APPARITIONS. 3j>ij
to propagate, nay, to raife and invent fuch Stories
of Apparitions and Vifions j to furnifh them out
with popular Circum (lances, and to fprcad them as
Realities, meerly and on purpofe to form a plau-
{ible Relation > and perhaps fome, according to
Cuftom, fall into that old School-boy's Error, of
telling the Tale over fo often, 'till they believe it
to be Truth.
But all this Fiftion and Fable, of which the
World is fo full, does not at all leflcn the folid
Part which I firft advanced, and ftill infift upon,
viz. The Reality of Apparition in general 5 for
the fruitfulnefs of other Mens Imagination in coin-
ing of Falfhood, does not at all ieflen the Validity
of a Truth which the Lie is made to Mimick and
Counterfeit.
WE have had a world of Tales imposed upon
the World about Apparitions fliewing themfelves
to abundance of People, before^ at^and after the late
MaiTacre in Ireland^ Ann. 1641, and it would fill
up a Volume of itfelf to give an Account of them 5
nor is it poffible to diftinguiih between thofe of
them that are Real, and thofe that were Imagina*
ry, efpecially at this Diftance of Timej but if [
may believe the Report of thofe that were upon
the Spot, and of others who receiv'd the Accounts
from the moft Judicious and moft Confidering of
thofe who were upon the Spot, the Fears and
Apprehenfions of the People, efpecially in Duhlin^
where they cxpe6bed the Murtherers would break
in upon them every Day, fiU'd them with Dreana
and Phantofm, Vifion and Apparition, when indeed
there was nothing in it but their own dreadful Ap-
prehenfions.
Nor could they be fo much blam'd as in other
Cafes, for here were People efcap'd from the Mur-
therers, even out of their very Hands j fome that
had feen their Wives, Children, Fathers, Mothei-s,
Husbands,
35^z The Hljlory and Reality
Husbands, Neighbours butcher'd before their Fa-
ces} and no Wonder if thefe had the Images of
Death before their Eyes, after they arriv'd 5 no
Wonder if they had Apparitions and Vifions of the
like Mifchiefs every Hour.
N o Wonder if they faw Clouds o^ Irijh Armies in
the Air, heard Shrieks of dying murther'd Women
and Children, and that they vouch'd thefe things
with the utmoft Solemnity. Now 'tis true in the
common Notions of Humanity, one cou'd not but
pity thofe poor People, and give allowance to
their Fears, and to the Fright and Horrors that
were upon their Minds j yec it does not at all fol-
low that we, who are not under the fame Impref-f-
flons, mud come into the Delufion with them,
give up our Underftanding and our Reafon to their
imagined Vifions.
W E are to judge of thofe things by the Rules by
which we ought to judge in like Cafes, and after
you have made Allowances for the Terrors and
Fright which the poor People might be in then,
we fhould confider the rational Parr, for where
the Apparition is real, the Rational Part is always
apparent as well as the Vifionary Part : for Exam-p
pie,
What Apparitions came from a good Hand,
and for the good of the innocent People, whofe
Dangers were fo imminent, would certainly come
in fome Space of Time before the Danger, either
fo as to give Opportunity of Efcape, or at lead
Preparatory Warnings, that the People might have
time to look up to Heaven, which the butchering
Enemy would not fpare them; and fuch Appariti-
ons as thefe I fhould be inclin'd to give the moft
Heed to 5 but of thefe we read of very few.
O N the other hand, to what Purpofe could Ap-r
paritions fhow themfelves afterward? and from
whom did they come? If the Souls of the mur-
thcr'd
of APPARITIONS, 3P3
ther'd Protcftants cou'd appear and cry for Re-
venge, why did they noc all appear, as well as one
Woman at Bandon- Bridge? Why did they not
Haunt the Murtherers in a moft frightful manner,
and terrify them Night and Day, 'till they brought
their own Guilt to be the word of Apparitions
to them?
Why did not the Terror of Blood lie upon
them, like a conftant Devil harrafling their Souls,
and terrifying them 'till they were made their own
Executioners? We faw none of thefe Things hap-
pen either to them, or to the Murtherers, Aftorsand
Dire6tors of the P^r//?^/^ MalTacre. CharlesVK. King
of France^ by whofe Dire6lion it was all manag'd,

the Government after him, and told his Mother
how to a6b with the Hugonots, 'till his Brother
the King of Poland fhould arrive.
In Ireland the Priefts and Zealots, nay the very
Women, boafted of the Number they had kill'dj
fhow'd the Skeins or Daggers with which they

and another fo many j their Soldiers fought as fear-
lefs after it as before, nor did any Apparition haunt

encourage them, harden them in it, take all Re-
morfe from theiii, and reproach them with Cowar-
dice if they fhew'd the ieaft Inclination to Pity;
tho' I don't hear of the lead Blame the Devil him-
fclf could lay upon them of that kind.
As to Apparitions after it was over, I do not
fee Room CQ think therp fo much as Rational
;
D d theiq
3P4 75&^ Hfftory and Reality
there was not the leaft Occafion of them, or Ufe
for themj the Mifehief was donej what could the
inviiible World have to fay to any body aboue \t
after it was done? We do not read of any Ap-.
paritions, Voices, Noifes, Signs, or Wonders ac
Jerufalem after the Temple was deftroy'd, tho' a-
bove a Million of People are faid (by Jofepbus) ta
have perifhcd there. There were Signs a^nd hor-
rible Noifes, Apparitions and Voices before it, 'm:
feveral Places, but none after it 3 the miferable.
Dead lay quiet in their Heaps, Gra^'es they could net
he caird^ and gave neither their Friends or Enemies
any Difturbance.
To conclude: The fliam Apparitions which Peo-
ple put upon themfelves are indeed very many^ and,
our Hypochondriack People fee more Devils zt
noon-day than Galil^us did Stars, and more by ma-
