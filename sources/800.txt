    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 	 Spiritual Analyst and Scientific Record, The.
 Life—and its Issues.
 1871—1871?  Monthly, bimonthly
 Boston, MA.  Publisher: W.F. Brown & Co..  Editor: J.H.W. Toohey.
 Succeeds: Spiritual Monthly and Lyceum Record
 1/6, June 1871-1871(?)  48 pp.  See the note under Spiritual Monthly.  
This appears to have been the ill-conceived attempt to fill out the subscriptions of the Spiritual Monthly.  Although Toohey had a long history in spiritualism, beginning with the Christian Spiritualist in the 1850s, the journal had little in it explicitly devoted to spiritualism and consisted almost exclusively of articles and notes reprinted from other, secular, journals, padded out with a chapter from "Heinrich Zockokke's" [Zschokke’s] Illumination; or, The Sleep-walker.  Amherst College and NSAC Lily Dale have 1/9, September 1871.          Issues:Spiritual Analyst V1 N9 Sep 1871       </p>
