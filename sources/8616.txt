&nbsp;   In the course of more than twenty    years of research into near-death experiences (NDEs), I have met innumerable    persons who have had NDEs who     had been moved to want to share their experiences with dying patients.''Many of them accordingly come to spend some time working as volunteers    for hospices, and in that setting they have something unique and uniquely    valuable to contribute to the patients to whom they    minister.&nbsp; It isn't just their telling of their    NDE, though   of course that can often be a part of what my friends are prepared to share.'' More    significant, I think, is what a    near-death experiencer is rather than    what he or she knows that is the vital    message that is transmitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Near-death experiencers are at ease    about death, and this is what is communicated when they work with dying    patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember a near-death experiencer who told me that    although she had been involved in     hospice work for nineteen years, she had found only four occasions when    it seemed appropriate to mention her NDE to her patients.'' Instead, she    shared her being, not her story, and that, apparently, told her story in    another way.
           What near-death experiencers have absorbed into   themselves and what they transmit to their patients is &quot;the peace that passeth all   understanding.&quot;' If you read accounts of    NDEs, you will easily   understand the depth of this feeling of peace that comes with the experience of    dying and why it is that near-death experiencers are uniquely qualified    to transmit this knowledge directly to the dying person.'' Listen to just    a couple of these testimonies on this    point &nbsp; 
    
    One woman told me that when she found herself in the light, &quot;the feeling just became more and more and more ecstatic and glorious and    perfect.... If you took the one thousand best things that ever happened    to you in your life and multiplied by a million, maybe you could get    close to this feeling.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Another man wrote, &quot;then there was peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace, but in order to give an idea of what one means by that, the    letters would have to be written thousands of miles high in soft glowing    colors...' It is a complete happiness, total happiness, beyond the realm    of happiness.&quot;&nbsp;
    
    Then, there is the absorption into the light which conveys a feeling of    absolute love, total acceptance, unconditional forgiveness, universal    knowledge and complete perfection.&nbsp;&nbsp; As one man put it, &quot;I just     immediately went into this beautiful bright light.' It was a total    immersion in light, brightness, warmth, peace, security.'' It's    something which becomes you and you become it.'' I could say, 'I was peace, I was    love, I was the brightness.''' It was part of me.'' You just know.''    You're all knowing, and everything is a part of you.'' It's just so    beautiful.&nbsp; It was eternity.&nbsp;    It's like I was always there, and I will always be there, and that my    existence on earth was just a brief instant.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The physicist, David Bohm, said that    the energy of the universe is not a neutral energy but an energy of love, and the near-death    experiencer returns from his or her encounter with death, not just to    confirm Bohm's intuition but to communicate it to others.'' This the    message that those who have already died have to give to those who are    about to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Studies have shown that the personal    presence of near-death     experiencers and the stories they have to tell have a direct effect on      those dealing with or facing death.'' Fear of death is reduced and      feelings of comfort and peace are increased.'' For these reasons, the      near-death experiencer is an ideal midwife to those who are about to    make the transition into death, for they have been there, and they know that      what is coming is a glory that even a Dante would find himself powerless      to describe.' In consequence, all hospices, it seems to me, should desire      to make use of near-death experiencers    in their corps of volunteer.

 When we are born, we emerge out of    the constriction of the womb and birth canal into the wondrous world of previously unimaginable and      virtually unlimited sensory experience.'' And when we die, we go through      a second birth, which may be even more difficult than the first,      leave the world we know for another that transcends anything we can    conceive where we discover, finally, what it is to be alive.'' Fully      alive, and filled with a radiant joy &quot;beyond the realm of   happiness.&quot;&nbsp; This is the the message those who have made the   journey have to tell those who are about to undertake it.' It is the greatest gift that they      have to share and, for some, the reason they have returned to life.''That's why they have and will continue to have a valued place at the      bedside of those who are beginning to prepare for their departure from      the world we will all have to leave behind one day.              --------------------------------------------------------------------------      &nbsp;
