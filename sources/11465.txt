  		              		Experience Description   

    My teenage daughter told me that she wanted to be baptized and become a Christian.  Later on, she said she wanted to attend a bible study group that was held by her church.  Being an agnostic, I wanted to be aware of what she was  involved in and decided rather than just drop her off, I would attend the group with her.  The group was interesting, but did not change my agnostic beliefs.
  
  Later, I was riding my motorcycle home from the office.  It was just after 6:00 pm on a dark, wet night. I was stopped behind traffic on a bridge.  I could see a vehicle in the distance as it approached the rise onto the bridge at high speed.  I thought to myself, 'I hope the driver slows down before he comes up onto the bridge, otherwise I'll end up landing on the utility in front of me or on the other side of the road where oncoming traffic would not have time to stop before running me over.'  I thought this might be the end of my story.  Then I heard the screeching of tires and I was catapulted into the air.
  
  As I was going up, I left my body and had a very quick glance down to my left and saw the accident scene.  I was flying horizontally in a very dark space and heading towards a porthole of white light at the end.  An image of God was in the light.  I felt such peace and joy that it is difficult to describe.  The white light was the only place I wanted be.  The world below was in the past and I had no regrets.  Then I felt a brief moment of angst because I was not getting any closer to the light.  I felt God was stopping me.  If I was dead down below and couldn't get to the light, then where was I supposed to be?   I looked down and to my right.  Jesus was standing in the dark space, some distance from me and looking towards the light.   I realized in an instant what was happening. In my mind, I said to God, 'Get me out of this one and I won't come here again without Him.'  Zoom! I was straight down and blended back into my body.  The things happening around me seemed a little surreal.  I had landed on the white double lines alongside the utility and clear of the oncoming traffic.  I stood up and walked back to my motorcycle.  The driver who had hit me came up to see  if I was hurt and he started to apologize.  The first thought that came into my mind was, 'Don't get angry, Jesus wouldn't want it.'  The only injury I sustained was very heavy bruising over a considerable part of my body.
  
  Many months later,  the bible study group moved to my house and continued there for ten years.  I became more interested in caring about people than material things.  Over the coming years, I became a volunteer visitor for the church hospital chaplain.  I left a long-term career in commercial real estate and became a librarian.  I'm not expecting any stop signs when I'm next heading to the white light as I won’t be going there alone.
  
  It was ten years before I told a friend of my experience. He dismissal this experience, as I expected.  After seven years, I was telling another friend of my experience.  This  prompted me to do some NDE research and I came across this site.  
  
Thanks NDERF and all those who have told their story, it's been a great help.
