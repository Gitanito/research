so when we talk about extraterrestrial
intelligence and these other
dimensions we have to begin to entertain
the idea first of all almost any way
that they would manifest is going to
look like magic to
us and it&#39;s very easy to confuse that
with something from another dimension
that is an ET so you just accept that
that&#39;s the case but there is a distinct
learning curve that happens as you go
out and begin to make contact where you
can clearly discern the energy of a
human
militarized decoy it&#39;s very obvious it&#39;s
invasive if you see the object up close
it&#39;s got seams Parts
protuberances rivets and stuff like this
is not
ET
