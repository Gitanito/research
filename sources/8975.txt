I REMEMBER A TIME FROM LONG AGO

ABOUT A MOTHER AND HER SON

HOW TRAGEDY HAD FALLEN

AND HIS LIFE HAD JUST BEGUN

 

THIS IS A SPECIAL STORY

AND I HOPE I TELL IT RIGHT

THE MIGHTY BOND OF A MOTHERS LOVE

AND THE COURAGE SHE HAD TO FIGHT

 

YOU SEE HER SON HAD TAKEN ILL

AND THE DOCTOR TRIED IN VAIN

NO MEDICATION SEEMED TO WORK

AND THE MOTHERS FACE SHOWED PAIN

 

EXHAUSTED FROM THE CARE SHE'D GAVE

SHE FELL INTO DEEP SLEEP

HER LITTLE BOY TUCKED IN HER ARMS

SHE PRAYED HIS SOUL TO KEEP

 

HIS FEVER RAGED ON THROUGH THE NIGHT

AND HE DIDN'T EVEN CRY

SHE AWOKE TO SILENCE IN THE ROOM

"MY GOD HE'S GOING TO DIE".

 

SHE WRAPPED HIM IN SOME BLANKETS

AND HURRIED INTO TOWN

THE DOCTOR TOOK HIM IN HIS ARMS

AND ASKED HER TO SIT DOWN

 

WITH A MINDFUL EYE HE CHECKED HER SON

AND HE SAID WITH A SOMBER FACE

HE'S IN A DEEP DEEP COMA

TAKE HIM HOME AND WAIT

 

I'LL COME AND SEE TOMORROW

IF ANY CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE

KEEP HIM WARM AND PRAY FOR HIM

HE NEEDS....."AMAZING GRACE" 

 

THE TEARS WERE FALLING FROM HER CHIN

AS SHE CARRIED HER SON HOME

WHERE ARE YOU GOD?  I NEED YOU NOW

WHY MUST I STAND ALONE?

 

THE NIGHT WAS LONG AND NEIGHBORS CAME

TO WATCH WITH HER AND WAIT

AND GIVE SUPPORT THE BEST THEY COULD

AND PONDER HER CHILD'S FATE

 

IT SEEMED AS IF FOREVER

BEFORE THE DOCTOR CAME

HE LOOKED INTO THE INFANTS EYES

AND SAID THERE'D BEEN NO CHANGE

 

THE TEARS FLOWED DOWN THE MOTHERS FACE

HER FEARS WERE COMING TRUE

SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN

BUT THE WORDS KEPT COMING THROUGH

 

SHE COULD HEAR THE DOCTOR TELLING HER

AS SHE WAS TRYING NOT TO CRY

YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER DAY OR SO

BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO DIE

 

IF THINGS DON'T CHANGE BY MORNING LIGHT

I'LL MAKE THE FUNERAL CALL

AND HAVE THEM MAKE A SMALL PINE BOX

AND PLACE IT IN THE HALL

 

IN FRANTIC DESPERATION

THE MOTHERS MIND RAN WILD

WHAT CAN I DO? WHAT CAN I DO?

TO SAVE MY LITTLE CHILD.

 

WITH DISTANT EYES, FULL OF TEARS

SOMETHING SPOKE FROM DEEP WITHIN

TAKE YOUR SON UP IN THE HILLS

TO "NONA" THE INDIAN 

 

AS SHE APPROACHED THE MAKESHIFT DOOR

"NONA" SWUNG IT WIDE

TAKE THE CHILD TO THE TABLE THERE

SHE POINTED AND STEPPED ASIDE

 

NOW THE BOY LAY UNCONSCIOUS

BUT THERE'S A LIGHT THAT HE CAN SEE

A GOLDEN LIGHT, "ITS BEAUTIFUL"!

ITS......... LIKE, ETERNITY

 

IT SURROUNDED HIM WITH AWESOME LOVE

AND CARRIED HIM UP HIGH

MAGNIFICENCE HAD SURROUNDED HIM

HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE

 

HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE TABLE

AND SAW THE WOMEN WORKING THERE

THEY WERE PUTTING OIL ALL OVER HIM

BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY CARE

 

THEY WRAPPED HIM IN A HEAVY CLOTH

TO KEEP HIS BODY WARM

THE LIGHT OF LOVE SAID "GO BACK NOW"

WHEN ITS TIME I'LL CALL YOU HOME

 

HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THAT LIGHT

BUT THE CHOICE WAS MORE DIVINE

THE LIGHT SAID I WILL FOLLOW YOU

AND WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR MIND

 

A MOTHERS PRAYER WAS ANSWERED

THAT NIGHT SHE GOT HER SON

A GIFT THAT GOD GAVE BACK TO HER

A BATTLE THAT SHE'D WON

 

AS FOR THE BOY THAT GOD SENT BACK

HE GREW TO LOVE THE LIGHT

I KNOW .....................I WAS THAT BOY

AND THE LIGHT WAS "JESUS CHRIST"
