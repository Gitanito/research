  		              		Experience Description   

    Greyson’s Scale Score: 27 

  I guess this chapter of my life story starts on July 28, 2016, when I went through a 6-hour heart procedure call RF Ablation to control my Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib).  I thought the procedure was a success. I was A-fib free for 10 months. Then I had an episode in August 2016 which only lasted a couple of hours. However, that all changed on June 28, 2017.  That’s the date I went into A-fib.  For most of 2016, my A-fib seemed to be induced by life stresses.  On June 28th 2017, I had no real stress in my life to speak of. Yet, the A-fib just appeared.  It was a nice June morning and I was rolling boulders I had just purchased for a waterfall and pond I was installing at the place I was living. I was enjoying my hobby and life was good. It was very easy to tell I was in A-fib.  Classic symptoms appeared like clockwork, one after another. I continued to roll boulders and move 10 yards of top soil, via wheelbarrow, to the pond site.  It didn’t take that long to figure out it wasn’t worth the effort. The A-fib was winning. I decided to try and take a nap.  In the past, I could come out of the A-fib by just taking a nap.  Unfortunately, a nap wasn't working. 
  
  The A-fib continued into June 29th.  While at work that night, I made the decision to go to the emergency Room when I got off.  When I got home at approximately 10:55pm that night, I asked my wife to listen to see if I was still in A-fib. I knew I was, I just needed her to tell me I was in A-fib to make the final decision to go to the Emergency room. It didn’t take her long at listening before she said, 'Oh yeah, you’re in A-fib.'  emergency room, here I come.  Being in A-fib is a weird experience just by itself, but what happened to me in the emergency room on the morning of June 30, 2017 had dramatic effect on my life for a very long time.  I  don’t know yet the extent of the effects that are still to come. 
  
  When I arrived at the emergency room, I calmly told the admissions person at the desk that I was in A-fib.  She took my personal information and insurance card.  Within 5 minutes after finishing up with the paperwork, the emergency medical technician came out from the back and got me.  He escorted me to room #3 and began hooking up wires for the electrocardiogram (EKG). The EKG verified I was in A-fib. The nurse then hooked me up to a heart monitor and prepared me for an IV line to administer any medications I might need.  About 10 to 20 minutes went by before the doctor working came in to see me.  After some basic questions, he informed me that they were going to administer some medications to help get my heart back into normal rhythm.  The nurse started the medications via my IV line.  An hour or so went by and it was  clear that the medications didn’t work to get my heart back into normal rhythm.  The doctor came back in the room to discuss the only real option I had left, which was to shock my heart to get it back into normal rhythm. It was a no brainer and I agreed to have the procedure done.
  
  The respiratory therapist came in to set up the ‘crash cart’.  After he applied pads on my left chest and left side of my back, he got me started on oxygen. The nurse had me sign a consent form and all we were waiting for was the doctor to show up to zap me. 

  The emergency room doctor finally showed up and asked me about all my past surgeries I have had. He then asked me if I had any problems with anesthesia.  Next he explained to me about the anesthesia they were going to administer that night. It was called Ketamine.  He told me that it was going to make me have dreams and that it was good that I was in a mellow mood. Now, everybody seemed to be ready.
  
  These are the events I remember when I woke up on the gurney on June 30, 2017. The ketamine was administered at 2:00 am. I knew the time because  the nurse said out loud. I looked at the clock to verify and she was correct.    It didn’t take very long before I felt pressure building in my head.  The last thing I remembered was the doctor saying as he was standing on my left side, 'Do you feel anything yet?'  As soon as he asked that,  for the first time in my life, I let go. I gave up!

   Instantly I was traveling at a very high rate of speed through what appeared to be a tunnel, but it wasn’t a tunnel.  Maybe, it was more like a conduit. The walls of the ‘tunnel/conduit’ were against my body, but I didn’t feel it. It had me in its grip, if that makes any sense.  At one point in the ride I stuck my head out of the tunnel/conduit.  I saw what the movies depict in space  when ships are traveling super-fast. The .stars and planets were whizzing by, leaving light-trails behind them.  What was different was the visual I saw of the texture of the outer ‘tunnel/conduit’ surface.  It was made out of gold flakes.  I saw the tunnel/conduit floating through space. This might sound odd, but the tunnel/conduit had the appearance like what the outside of our large intestines look like, except with gold flakes. 

  The following events happened within seconds of one another or if not all at once:

   When the ride was over, the tunnel/conduit placed me very gentle on a path that led somewhere. I couldn’t see where it was leading to because of the dark figures in front of me. They stood in a single-file line and nobody was saying anything.  I could only see the backs of their heads.  It was like they were shadows of other humans. I immediately felt an overwhelming presence all around me. This presence or should I say ‘His’ Presence was so Powerful, evil could never dwell or even tempt the people of this place. I felt very safe from evil or any harm. But, I felt intimated by this incredible Power  all around me.  It was definitely His world and I wasn’t going to do or think anything He did not want me to do or think. He is definitely in charge.  The air around me felt extremely light and pure. It smelled very clean, which is the best way I can describe it. Again, there was a definite Higher Order than we are used to here on earth. 

    I looked in front of me through what looked like a window opening.  It appeared to be a big pile of extremely white human femur bones.  I thought that was weird.  The noise I was hearing was extremely loud, even deafening.   It reminded me of a production plant with steel, grinding on steel. Then I looked to the right side of me, through another window/opening and I saw a huge beautiful, white city.  It was so big, you couldn’t see the tops of the buildings. The base of each building was incredibly huge. There were no trees. The city was very, very clean and shiny.  The city itself was actually the light.  It was a soft light, but it was as bright as the sun only with a different glow.  I didn’t see the sun or feel the heat of the sun. I then looked back through the window where I had seen the white bones in a pile.  This time, the bones were stack in a perfect pile. I don’t understand the meaning of the two different piles.  The first time I looked at the pile, it looked like somebody just threw the bones in a pile.  The second time I looked at the pile the bones and they were staked in perfect order. 

  Then, I experience an extremely loud deafening sound, louder than the other noise I heard. I could see myself sliding back into my body on the gurney. Before I could open my eyes, I felt pain in my left forearm.  I opened my eyes and looked over at my left forearm that was pressed up against the guardrail of the gurney.  My hand look like it was 10 times its normal size. I didn’t know what that was about, but I took it in stride since it was nothing compared to what I just went through.  I looked straight ahead and saw the nurse standing at the computer typing something.  I told her I just got assimilated!  She responded with, 'What?' Again, I said, 'I just got assimilated!'  She said, 'That’s weird.'  I said it again and she said that the respiratory therapist did say that my eyes were going back and forth at a real rapid pace and that I said, 'Wow' a lot.  She also shared that the Doctor got me off the high gurney.  She added, 'A lot of people cry or whimper when they get shocked. You just grunted.' 

  She then told me that  I was only out for 5 minutes.  I immediately looked at the clock and it was 2:35 am.  'Strange' I thought. I remember her saying she administered the Ketamine at 2:00 am and now it’s 2:35 am.   I was only out for 5 minutes.  Later her report said she administered the ketamine at 2:18 am.  Something doesn’t make sense. If I was only out for 5 minutes, where did everyone go?  There was nobody in the room except the nurse. The lights were off in the room and it looked like it was vacant for a while. Anyway, I waited another hour or so recovering before they finally discharged me.  I don’t believe the emergency room doctor ever came back and talked with me before my discharge.  

  Life went on and I eventually told several people about the white city and the incredible noise that I heard during the experience. However, I continue to tell my wife on a daily basis that something happened to me that I couldn’t figure it out.  When my mind would be idol, I would hear that incredible noise.  I told my wife about still hearing the noise. Later, she said that she was scared because I might start to hear voices. I assured her that I was not hearing voices, but I think she still had doubts. I continued to hear the noise until July 12, my birthday. I got a birthday gift that I will never ever forget.

  I elected to spend my 54th birthday working on the pond and waterfall.  I purchased another 400 pounds of rocks that day.  I had just finished arranging the boulders.  Overall, I was feeling it was very  good day. After my wife cooked the enchiladas, we relaxed on the swing in the backyard where we enjoyed wine and each other’s company. We were talking about something and in mid-sentence ‘the body’ of the NDE was finally revealed to me.  Everything I felt and everything I saw was re-lived in that moment. What a birthday gift!

  This is the body of my Near Death Experience:

  I was standing in line. After I looked at the pile of perfectly stacked white bones again, I was immediately taken inside one of the huge buildings. I was floating in an open room with an incredible, loud buzzing noise that I could not only hear inside my mind, but also felt pushing against me. I was taken up into the higher part of the building where there were screens on all four walls.  There were hundreds of screens side by side and on top of one another. Different screens were playing different events  of my life.  At first, I thought the experience was a joke, but the events kept coming with more intensity as the experience went on. I didn’t have a choice to stop thinking about what was happening. It was consuming me and it wouldn’t stop or  go away.  At that point, I remember asking myself, 'Am I dead?' And then saying to myself, 'I am dead!' What a feeling that I never felt in my 54 years of life, knowing that I was  actually dead.  How many people can talk about that?   I’ve never experienced anything like that in any dream, ever. It wasn’t a dream!   Then, when I came back down to ‘ground level’, I saw a council of elders, dressed in whiteand sitting at a long table.  They didn’t even look at me.  It looked like they were discussing something of importance.   Above them, to the right were two Beings that I didn’t recognize.  They had very loud and powerful voices, speaking with great authority.  I didn’t understand a word they said.  It didn’t seem to be a language from earth. Then the visions seemed to be of future events because I didn’t recognize the people or events that I was being shown. Again, these visions were coming one after another with more intensity as they continued. 

  When I was done in that room, I just all the sudden appeared in another room. This time, I was standing rather than floating as I was in the other room prior.  I will call this room the ‘reality window room.’  A small window appeared above me on the wall of the room I was in.  This window had a wheel on each corner of the window. There were four wheels altogether.  The window was very small when it first appeared, but grew while the wheels were spinning and making a high pitch noise. The window would grow rather quickly and then consume me. I would be inside the window of that reality.  As soon as that window was done showing me things, another reality window appeared.  It was growing and make that loud sound, just like the previous window.  Each window that appeared, had different contents inside but they all had the same theme.  This was Creation!  When the window would absorb me, there would be nothing there.  Within seconds, things grew, things were built, and things were created.  They grew to enormous size. The power and intensity of each window was exhausting!  Just imagine you were standing in the middle of New York City before New Your City was built.  And then, New York City was created in 3 seconds from ground up, right before your eyes.  How loud and intense do you think that would have been?  That’s the intensity and power of each reality window I was consumed by.  The windows wouldn’t stop, they kept coming. 
  
   That is why the first thing that came out of my mouth when I got back into my body on the gurney was, 'I just got assimilated!'  The content of each window filled my WHOLE mind!!! I was forced to ‘absorb’ each reality window.  After what felt like FOREVER, I do remember I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was exhausted.  I couldn’t handle another reality window.  I remember putting my head down before the next window had a chance to consume me. All of a sudden, an incredible noise filled my whole mind and I saw myself sliding back into my body. It was like I was breaking a barrier coming back into this realm.  The noise was very, very loud and very intense.  

  Webster’s definition of Assimilate is 'to take into the mind and thoroughly understand, to absorb into the cultural tradition of a population or group, to make similar.' 

  I now know that I was being shown the Awesome Power of Creation.  His Power is the Greatest Power in the universe.  Now, what do I do with that knowledge? It is one thing to be told about it, but to actually experience it,  brings me to a whole different level.  How can anything in this world compare to what I have experienced?  Thinking of this experiences is very exhausting and very humbling.

  I had no idea ‘what’ He was showing me in the reality windows because I never saw any of the images before.  In the early morning of July 17, 2017, five days after my birthday, I had a rather disturbing dream.  It was just a dream this time.  Although I can’t remember the body of the dream, I do remember the last thing I was told. I was told to remember the 4th dimension.  So I Googled the '4th dimension.' I had never looked into or studied anything on the different dimensions before so I didn’t know what to expect. So I read several articles on the subject and found it interesting, but nothing really stood out as the answer I was looking for.  Then I clicked on images. There it was! I saw  similar  images to what I saw in the reality windows.  I then Googled each of the 5th through the 12th dimensions and click on images for each.  These were very similar images as to what I had to absorb, except my in my experience they were bigger, louder and more of them. Instead of calling them ‘reality windows’ now call them ‘dimension windows’. I didn’t go to them, each dimension window came and absorbed me.      

  I have now read many articles about near death experiences.  Many people claim that they have ‘special powers’ after their experience.  As I finish writing this on August 4, 2017, none have been revealed to me thus far.  However, I was told on the night of July 30th, a month after my near death experience, to ‘represent’ what I saw.  Not sure what that means at this point, but pretty confident I’ll be shown someday.  I was also told that He is the Mighty One of ALL dimensions. That revelation I’ve never heard before. It makes me feel rather small.
