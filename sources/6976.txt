Andrew Carr MacKenzie was born near Dunedin, New Zealand. He worked in Wellington as a journalist until 1938 when he moved to England. He fought in Asia during the Second World War, rising to the rank of captain and distinguishing himself in guerrilla warfare. He then returned to journalism in London, writing for newspapers on the visual arts. He published numerous detective and police thrillers in the 1950s.  Psychical Research

MacKenzie became interested in paranormal phenomena while researching articles for a popular magazine in 1961. He joined the Society for Psychical Research and was elected to its governing council, later becoming a vice president.

MacKenzie regularly participated in fact-finding investigations, for instance visiting the Suffolk village Kersey in 1990 with William Laing, who believed he had earlier experienced a time-slip there.1 Other topics he researched included the Cheltenham haunting and the Edgar Vandy and Palm Sunday mediumship cases.

His chief contribution was books exploring such subjects as ghosts and apparitions, the Belmez faces and time-slips, and numerous book reviews in the Society’s journal. He was particularly intrigued by Moberly and Jourdain’s experiences at Versailles, and explored alleged folkloric stories of the paranormal in Romania, which he visited frequently.2

A reviewer praised the unbiased way in which MacKenzie presented cases in his books.  

He tries and succeeds in being very fair in his assessment of the relevance of the many different suggestions that have been offered to account for the phenomena. The very title he has chosen for his book, The Unexplained, shows that he has no cut and dried thesis to advance. But though unexplained, and apparently unexplainable for the present, he is not willing to cast them aside as mere frivolities with no significance’.3

His unpublished work, comprising thirty files of articles and correspondence, has been catalogued and is housed at Cambridge University Library.  Works  Books
