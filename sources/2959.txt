PREFACE.
IN placing his volume before the tribunal of the
public, the author would confess that he is per-
fectly conscious of its containing some defective
points in argument,-some reasoning which might
be better illustrated,-some subjects which as
yet
cannot be developed beyond a certain extent, or
which require a
larger experience,-and some in-
stances of repetition which might have been
avoided. But he is fain to crave a
degree of
indulgence on the ground of the nature of his
subject,--of its being greatly an
unexplored tract,
and containing much of the "
terra incognita ;"-
and of his own active professional duties, which
have crowded his literary labours into a
very late
hour of the night, and which have occasioned fre-
quent interruptions of a most harassing character.
Yet he would hope that notwithstanding these dif-
ficulties and imperfections, some steps in advance
have been taken towards exploring that most im-
portant subject, THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE or
nonv AND Mum.

ARGUMBNT.-Necessity for attending first to the natural healthy
agency of the organ of mind, upon its mental manifestations, before
we can understand the deviations from its physiological condition.
Mind, as exhibited in man, has no means of receiving notices from
without, or of communicating its own actions,except through a mate-
rial medium :-this medium is the brain-so that the operations of
mind may be influenced by the health or disease of the body
generally, and by original peculiarities of the brain : but the mind,
soul, or spiritual principle is the supreme governor. The little at-
tention' bestowed upon this important subject arises probably from
our
ignorance of the immediate agency of mind. The primary Ob-
ject of this investigation is to study the varied phenomena of mind,
as manifested through its organ :-thus the inquiry becomes strictly
an inductive one, in which we trace how spiritual emotion and
extemal impression are
distinctly characterized by the organ through
which they are given out or received. Influence of~ these views
upon the objects and prospects of education :-the brain requires
cultivation to render it a lit instrument for mental developement.
Distinction between mental and organic life ;-the latter fullils its
functions without education. Each individual among men possesses
a natural character conferred by physical temperament, which can-
not be wholly obliterated by any eH`ort of presiding mind, but which,
on the contrary, gives a tinge to all its actions :-this natural cha-
meter may, however, be controlled by, and therefore demands the
exercise of, moral principle, so as to render the mind always superior
to the impulse of bodily passion.

CHAPTER II.
RECIPROCITY OF BODILY AND MENTAL INFLUENCE APPLIED
'ro
EDUCATION.-Page 8.
Ancuunwr.-Education must proceed:-importance of giving it a
right direction under sanction of the highest moral principle, and
also of clearly appreciating its subject, in the compound nature of
man, in order that principle may be judiciously and successfully
inwrought into the character :-present rapid progress of mental
developement fostered by public opinion. The constantly widening
sphere of the advances of mind over matter chiefly dependent upon
the laws of habit and association, and increasingly-graduated exer-
tions, which,originating with the former, are permanently enstamped
upon the latter, and renders it capable of fulfilling the behests of
the governing principle. Man's power of acquisition limited :-he
does not fulfil the design of his creation, and is under the power of
some
perverting agency, the multiform effects of which, unless con-
trolled or
superseded by moral and religious motive, are
variously
shown in diferent individuals, according to the more or less perfect
state of the organ of mind, and its original peculiarities. Import-
ance of attending to the health, and cultivating the growth of the
brain, concurrently with the moral and intellectual education, that
it may perform its legitimate functions as the obedient servant of
mind, and thus promote the free agency of man. Powerful in-
fluence of opinion upon man's conduct :-advantage to be taken of
the stimulus it has afforded to education,by giving the latter a bene-
ficial direction. To this end, individual peculiarity is to be studied,
and encouraged or repressed according to its good or evil tendency.
Man is a free agent, and minutely responsible for all his actions;
but his free agency may be impaired by defective or neglected
education, without diminishing his accountability. Paramount im-
portance of early education of the brain :-quiescence, and excessive
employment of that organ equally dangerous :-illustrations, and
cautions on this subject :-progression being the physiological law
of man's nature, can
only he accomplished adequately by gradually-
increased exertion of the brain. Sympathetic association of the
brain with other organs and functions of the body, particularly with
the stomach-cruel abuse of this organ-its proper subjection to the
brain, as the organ of intellectual and moral manife tation. The

success of education depends upon the adaptation of its means to
the individual differences of the organ of mind, and these are not
to be discovered by any arbitrary laws of physiognomy, phrenology,
&c. &c., but by the rational study of character. Education incom-
plete, unless based upon the sanctions of revealed religion, and the
prejudices of the young must be secured in favour of religion and
virtue. W'hat is genius ?-A state dependent upon an unknown
and peculiar condition of the cerebral organ.
CHAPTER III.

sUnJr:c'r.-Page 43.
Xnculswr.-Phrenology not of practical importance in the present
discussion, provided that the organ, whether single or
multiple, be
held in entire subjection to the presiding mind ; but as truth is in-
valuable, the question merits consideration as a scientific inquiry;
tmth, therefore, should be the single object of _our investigation,
and the errors and follies of the votaries of phrenology should be
separated from the doctrine. Phrenology not fully bome out by
observation :-its doctrines here defined do not necessarily lead to
materialism or irresponsibility, but, as
frequently held, they possess a
demoralising tendency, and form a stronghold of Socialism. Ten-
flency of phrenology a
proper object of scientific inquiry; and its
being shown to militate against truth derived from other sources,
and to conduct to moral error, is a valid argument against its accu-
racy. 'l he lower animals possess mind in differing degrees,
always manifested through the brain, its appointed organ; the
organisation of each exquisitely fitted to their respective destinies.
But man
possesses a spiritual principle superadded to animal mind ;
his brain, therefore, is more developed ; but the function of mind is
not to be confounded with its organ; neither is the activity or in-
tegrity of the former dependent upon the size of the latter. Instinct
is knowledge imparted prior to education :-man has few instincts
compared with the lower animals, because of his intellectual and
spiritual endowments. Brain is equally and essentially requisite to
exhibit the highest reach of thought in man, as to manifest the
utomatic actions of mere instinct. Peculiarities of spiritual expres-
-on not dependent upon the quantum of brain, nor
upon any de-
hnstrable property of nervous fibre; perfection of sensation and
ls.

high mental developement not necessarily coincident, neither great
bodily and mental power; aptitude for thought in every form is
the result of some undefinable peculiarities of cerebral fibre. Ori-
ginal differences of mental constitution exist from infancy, yet U6
not traceable to organisation only; the converse is likewise true;
and both may be modified by education. Slow developement of
intellectual and moral faculties as compared with that of sensation
and passion, a
proof of some perverting change having passed up0n
the brain as the organ of mind. A variety of spiritual, vital, phy-
sical, and medicinal agencies shown to operate upon the brain, and
to produce changes of mental manifestation. Though no attribute
of mind is manifested without the intervention of the brain and
nervous system, yet it is as illogical to infer the necessity for its atomic
division into many .special organs for the developement of each
faculty, as to assert that the sentient principle resides in the ex-
tremity of each nerve. Review of the arguments for and against
the phrenological hypothesis, and its pretensions shown to be of a
very doubtful nature, if not utterly untenable.

ARGUMENT.-The preceding views neither tend to materialism nor
to a mysterious spiritual agency insusceptible of proof. The former
objection examined; the charge, if true, equally applicable to a
single undivided, as to a plural compounded, brain. Daily expe-
rience proves the manifestations of mind to be influenced by dif-
ferent states of the body, but especially of the brain; yet this
known, and vitally-important fact, is too much unheeded. lnjury
to the brain does afect the manifestations of mind; the contrary
supposition shown to be erroneous. The organic medium, the
brain, is not to be confounded with the originating spiritual princi-
ple; and as the instrument of thought and feeling, it is now im-
perfect, and exhibits its perverted and debased tendencies. 'l`he
integrity of the brain and nervous
system iridispensableto secure
perfection of mental expression, consequently ev' 'Wm
deviation from primordial excellence will give a "Jule

influence on the function of volition. Distinction between the mere
acl of wishing and mental volition. The question of the materiality
of the soul, not so all-important as has been generally consideredv
provided there be always a recognized and essential distinction be-
tween the spiritual soul and its mere organ, the brain. Immortality
not necessarily dependent upon immateriality, though we believe the
soul to be immaterial, because it is destitute of any of the known
properties of matter, and is a principle superadded to, not inherent
in, brain, being found only in man, because he alone is a moral
and religious creature. The immateriality of the soul not more
incomprehensible or mysterious than the commonest physiological
and physical phenomena. Some of the principal objections ex-
amined, and found to lead to absurd conclusions, while the imma-
terial doctrine alone fulfils the conditions of the strictest inductive
philosophy. Animal mind not to be confounded with the super-
added moral principle in man. Fallacy of the attempt to prove
thought and animal desire as originating from the same sources,
whereas they are essentially distinct. Moral motive cannot origi-
nate from the structure upon which it acts; and as this organic
structure is similar in its nature to that of other animals, it can
only be regarded as a distinct, independent, and controlling prin-
ciple. Other objections stated, and refuted; their absurdity.
Since the manifestations of mind do not originate in the brain, it
follows that the destruction of the soul is not necessarily coincident
with the dissolution of the body. The scriptural revelation of the
resurrection of the body, and future expansion and perfection of
mind, perfectly coincides with the researches of modem science,
and with sound metaphysical investigation. These views are
by no
means extravagant, but the result of sober deduction. Analogous
illustrations from the transformations of vegetable, in ect, and
animal life; the properties of chemical compounds are
generally
essentially diferent from their simpler elements, and arise from their
new
combination-analogies bearing on the subject in discussion_
Other objections against the immateriality of the soul examined.
Personal identity not dependent upon any material condition, but
resulting exclusively from the immaterial spirit, and is, in fact, its
own consciousness of continued existence. The doctrine of the
immateriality of the soul does not deprive it of active properties, but
ascribes to it the most energetic powers, while it demonstrates the
absence of material properties: it is, therefore, not subject to the
laws of matter, and can
only act in obedience to certain spiritual
laws, originally constituted by an all-wise Creator. Ignorance of

TABLE OF CONTENTS.
the nature and essence of spiritual existence no valid argument
against its reality. Exposure of arguments against this doctrine,
founded upon the most unwarrantable and gratuitous assumptions.
Mind is discoverable by its effects alone,-and its origin and opera-
tion, however mysterious, are not more inscrutable than physical
agency, in any, and in all its diversified forms. The assertion of a
perceptible motion about the brain in thought is not founded in
fact; and even if it were true, it would not militate against the
theory of an immaterial and governing precipient. Renewed cau-
tions against confounding organ and function. Proofs of an inde-
pendent presiding spirit, derived from certain mental processes-in-
tellectual, moral, and religious. The same truth proved by the
total or
partial absence of these properties, in reverie, dreaming, in-
toxication, delirium, &c., in which the self-actings of organic and
animal excitement are alone manifested. And again, in extreme
cases of religious conversion, and in the ordinary processes of
education. The possession of a
greater number and higher range
of instincts in animals generally over man, an argument in favour of
his being endowed with a
superadded and compensating principle,
the immaterial soul, by which he attains knowledge and reason.
This still further proved by the universal existence of individual
consciousness of an interior self; the le moi of sceptical, the soul of
christian, philosophers ;-and again, the consciousness that the dis-
solution of the body is not coincident with the extinction of the
indwelling spirit; and, lastly, the instinctive desire after immor-
tality-a feeling essentially distinct from the love of life possessed
by man in common with other animals. Some mistakes relative to
the progressive developement of mind, as connected with the growth
of the body. The anomalously wretched condition of man, in the
midst of acreation, where good so
immensely preponderates, indi-
cates that some awfully perverting cause has interfered with regard
to him ; and, also, in order to vindicate the revealed character of
God, the necessity for some other state of existence after the disso-
lution of the body, and the separation of the spirit from its present
material tenement. Existing mental phenomena, and especially the
obstacles in the way of intellectual advancement, another proof of
the immateriality of mind; so also the moral condition of man; the
tendency to evil rather than good is a
point of deviation from
original design, and demonstrates the necessity of future existence
under widely-diH`erent circumstances. Some remarks on the pecu-
liar nature of man, showing the necessity for a future state, and the
consequent immateriality and immortality of the soul.

TABLE OF CON'l`l£N'I`S. xi
CHAPTER V.
0¥ THE ESSENTIAL LAW OF PROGRESSION ENSTAMPED UPON
Tru: CHARACTER or INTELLI-:CTUAL þÿMAN.-*P8,g ¬
164.
Ancuunrvr.-Increasing attention bestowed upon the subject of
education; its resulting display of augmented intelligence; from
the constitution of the human mind this will be progressive. Has
not been productive of unmized good; it will be useful or mis-
chievous, in proportion as those who preside over its agency are
imbued with just opinions of its immediate object and ultimate
destination. Necessity for taking enlarged views of the object, as
well as of the subject of mental developement. Man is not to be
treated as an automaton, or a simple animal, or a
purely spiritual
being; the manifestations of his mind can
only be recognized
through the medium of bodily organization, and are liable to a
variety of modifications dependent thereon: but the organic medium
must never be confounded with the interior spiritual essence. The
desideratum is to carry onward the developement and expansion of
every mental faculty, consistently with due attention to the health of
the body, and with a view to the ultimate restoration of man to his
high and holy origin. Importance of attentively watching and
directing the successive developement of passion, intellect, and moral
and religious feeling, in pursuance of this design. Mental improve-
ment should always have reference to the final developement of
spiritual life: and to this end, the afections must be studied; and
their manifesting organs, which are subjected to the common law of
animal life, must be exercised and improved. Constant ameliora-
tion and progressive improvement to be sedulously pursued, and
this mental growth possesses a reproductive agency, infinitely more
operative than the analogous powers of animal and vegetable life.
This object can
only be fully accomplished by the educalion ofprin-
ciple, which must be everywhere pre-eminent, and therefore can be
found only in religion, or the pure precepts and motives of genuine
Christianity. Happiness and pleasure are not identical : the fomier
will be possessed in largest measure
by him who has the most ex-
panded intellect, applied to the benefit of his fellow men, and
devoted to the service of his Maker. Reason, imagination, and
erperience, are inadequate to guide men to the sure attainment of
real happiness, unless combined with, and controlled by, religious

principle. This dominant principle must not depend for support
upon the maxims of expediency, nor upon the hope of any selfish
enjoyment, however refined, but upon a system of duty, a faithfid
obedience to the declared will of God. Religion alone is able to
give preponderance to man's better tendencies, and to ensure pro-
gressive amelioration. Human perfection consists in the resem-
blance of man to the moral attributes of his Maker and Designer.
Man, as he now exists, the only anomalous imperfection with which
we are
acquainted. He must be taught to imitate the divine perfec-
tions, and these being marked by regularity, beauty, and utility, his
mental and_ moral developement should be similarly characterised.
Definition and explanation of these attributes, and the necessity for
their entire combination to form the character of human perfection.
Obstacles arising from the union of mind with matter-from the
influence of society-from individual idiosyncracies-and from
inadequate methods of instruction. Importance of mental deve-
lopement in its bearing upon religious belief. The faculty of the
will considered; mistaken views generally entertained; it is, when
unimpaired, the result of sound judgment and correct reasoning ; and
therefore perfectly free to choose, but liable to be influenced in its
decisions by the condition of the brain and nervous
system. Para-
mount importance of the will in the spiritual economy of man:
rules for the guidance of this faculty, and cautions to be observed
in its developement and cultivation. The will is influenced to
action by motives ; these must appeal to the understanding and the
conscience, enlightened by, and dependent upon, religious principle.
In man's present fallen and probationary condition, the design of
the Almighty Creator is very manifest, viz. uniform progression
towards moral good, and this must form the first object of the
good man's desire. Rigid discipline is to be enforced in early
life, without impairing the decision of character; it must teach
the power to choose, the obligation to obey. Importance of
distinguishing the eH`ects of idiosyncracy and education in the
formation of habits of mind, and of rightly adapting the mode of
treatment accordingly. Regularity of exercise indispensable to
success. Too great excitation to be carefully avoided, on account
of its consequent disastrous re-action. Benevolence of feeling will
strengthen intellectual capacity. The faculty of imagination re-
quires careful developement, since it exerci es a peculiar influence
upon the moral manifestations of mind. Application of the prin-
ciple of progressive improvement to the christian character; its
perfection is personal purity, and entire conformity to the will of

God. Peculiar ditiiculties in this christian progression, from the
perverted and corrupted state of man ; his responsibility not there-
fore lessened, since the way of access to original holiness is revealed
to him in the pages of revelation, with the unconditional promise
of the Holy Spirit to in truct, to guide, to strengthen, and support
him in the pursuit of all truth. Importance of the faculty of imita-
tion in the formation of character; the Christian must avail himself
of this truth, and apply it to its fullest extent, by continual refer-
ence to the perfect example of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus
Christ; and therefore his conduct through life will be prominently
characterised by consistency, beauty, and utility. Injury occasioned
to religion by a neglect of these principles on the part of its pro-
fessors; cautions and directions on this subject ;-on the man-
nerism of the Christian, and on the mode of communicating religious
truth: finally, habitual self-examination indispensable to the Chris-
tian.
CHAPTER VI.
ON THE THEORY OF LIFE; THE UNPHILOSOPHICAL NATURE
or 'rms IN:-'rm-:L vnzws CONNECTED WITH 'rms HIDDEN
sUnJr:c'r.-Page 235.
*nouunN'r.-Unsatisfactory knowledge as to what constitutes life;
its induence upon mental phenomena. Life is a principle super-
added to, and united with, matter; but, like many other first prin-
ciples, is only cognisable by its effects. It is not the "
sum total
of functions," since it exists in the absence of sensible pheno-
rnena; and it is called forth on the application of the appropriate
stimuli: suspended animation from drowning, &c. Neither is life
the result of organisation, nor constituted by its own functions.
Examination of Sir C. Morgan's hypotheses and inferences-shown
to be unfounded in fact, and unphilosophical and uncbristian in
application. The origin of evil is enveloped in mystery, but bene-
ficence clearly characterises the works of the Almighty, especially
those with which we are best acquainted. Inquiry into the pheno-
mena of life, as exhibited in its origin; this origin, when traced to
its source, is found to be derived from the immediate fiat of the
Creator, and is lost in the mysteries of creation. The successive
developement of vital function traced in vegetables, animals, and
man, in his several stages of growth. The assertion, that the moral

constitution varies vith the physical structure, possesses only a
semblance of truth; its erroneous tendency exposed, and the true
relation between these states pointed out. The principle of life is
not the determining cause of the phenomena manifested in the
world, but the commissioned agent of a superintending Ruler.
Examination of the chemical, mechanical, mathematical, and doc-
trinal theories of life, showing their insufiiciency to explain its phe»
nomena. Nervous influence, though indispensable to the conti-
nuance of the animal functions, is not life, but one of it effects.
The phenomena of life are only explicable or intelligible by calling
in the aid of a new and peculiar property, inseparable from itself,
and which is, in fact, one of nature's primordial laws. Influence of
life on the manifestations of mind; man possesses .spiritual as well
as animal life, in the characteristics of which there is an essential
difference; the latter being perfect from its origin, whilst the
former is continually progressive, and survives and is immeasurably
expanded after the extinction of its animal companion. Distinction
between sensation and passion, as the direct or reflex action to and
from the brain, the organ of spiritual manifestation. Influence of
the passions upon animal life generally, and upon some of the
interior organs in particular; their reflex morbid or healthy action
on the brain, and through it upon the manifestations of mind. Ex-
cessive mental emotion is directly or
remotely subversive of animal
life; and this destructive influence is specially exerted upon the
heart. Mode of operation described, illustrated, and explained.
Immense influence of sympathetic action, mental or physical, upon
the integrity of the animal frame. Constitutional predispo ition to
be controlled by mental principle and christian motive. Indivi-
duality of character mainly dependent upon the degree of subjection
of the appetites and passions to the presiding mind. Observations
on approaching dissolution, particularly shown by the decay of
the senses ; prolongation of the sense of taste,-state of the brain in
approaching death; exposition of erroneous notions entertained
relative to the expansion of spiritual manifestation, as life is ter-
minating; the grand source of error consists in confounding mind
itself with its manifestations: the brain is not exempted from the
general physiological laws of organic decay. Further inquiry into
the immediate causes of death; these may be accelerated or re-
tarded by the neglect or providence of the individual. The organs
of interior life are not directly acted upon by the passions, but
secondarily, through the medium of the brain and nervous
system.

not to be the seat of emotion. The preceding views illustrated by
the influence of the brain upon the lungs in the function of respira-
tion. All the other bodily functions are also intermediately de-
pendent upon the brain for their integrity, upon which they likewise
redect the influence of their morbid irritations respectively. Or-
ganic death, not necessarily the termination of existence. The
mind of man is here understood as a distinct principle, superadded
to animal mind, and over this spiritual principle death has no
power beyond that of suspending its present manifestations. The
phenomena of death afford no argument for the destructibility of
mind ; still less so, when viewed by the light of moral and christian
philosophy. Moral inferences to be drawn from the preceding con-
side rations.
CHAPTER VII.
ON THE MENTAL PROPERTIES; THEIR HEALTHFUL TENDEN-
cies AND nlsonmznnn INFLUENCE.-Page 294.
Anoummrr.-Necessity of distinguishing between the manifestations
of mind in the lower animals, and those which belong only to man,
who exclusively possesses the superadded principle: the former
being purely cerebral, the latter, however modified, still resulting
from the responsible moral being. Great di&`erence consists in the
possession of thought by man, and its absence in brutes. Distinc-
tion between the memory of the two classes, and the results of
information received through the senses; the one producing in-
stinctive, the other reasoning action,-the latter, too, having respect
to the laws of a moral govemor. Thought is liable to disordered
manifestations ;-influence of sleep upon thought. The hypothesis
of Sir C. Morgan, in respect of relative sen ibility, shown to be
unnecessary, unphilosophical, absurd, and opposed to facts. Real
position of the brain, as the medium of mental manifestation; it is
the servant of mind, therefore most untrue to assert that the brain
has no definite function, and is wholly supererogatory: by our
views it is ennohled, and the mental principle is endued with
immortality. Objections answered; that every part of the brain
has been found disorganised ;-conservative efforts of nature to
carry on her functions under difliculties ;-the brain in itself is not
highly sensitive ;-diference of natural appearance in the brain,
and ditiiculty of distinguishing such difference, especially since we

know not the nature of the ultimate cerebral fibre; but these
difficulties are not greater than those which belong to the hypo-
thesis terminating in organisation only :-these difliculties exposed,
-therefore inquiries pushed beyond organisation are not chime-
rical ; nor the hope at some future day to become acquainted with
this unexplored territory. Nature of mind beyond 'our power of
investigation; but we
may study the function of brain, the con-
necting link between mind and matter. Hypothesis of Sir C.
Morgan considered, that thought consists in organic movements,
and is therefore subject to the laws of matter; answer to this sup-
position, and proofs that thought does not consist in organic
movements-that it is not obedient to the laws of matter, and that
there are greater difliculties in this hypothesis, than in the simpler,
juster theory of governing mind directing cerebral organisation.
Observations on the senses; their developement in inverse propor-
tion to the employment of reason; yet the senses are the grand
inlet to knowledge. Reason for this anangement: the senses are
necessary to the conservation of animal life, but their acumen is
more than supplied by reason, and spiritual predominates over
animal life. The senses
may pervert, but do not watch over and
guide the operations of mind, which is superior to them. Much
mental power and action often co-exist without the cognisance of
the senses; examples of this law. What is sensation? How and
where produced? Causes operating to sophisticate the reports of
the senses: iniuence upon organic life, and reasons for this great
diference. Time, and frequency of employment, diminish the
intensity of impression ;-changes effected by advancing years;-
diminishing acuteness of feeling, increased range of intellect, and
certain and final disenchantment from the influence of sense. Im-
pressions made on the senses, how conveyed to the spiritual mind,
without which they have no rational or moral result. Objections
urged against this communication from the crossing and interlacing
of notices on their way; this objection answered and illustrated
by the transmission of the rays of light. Perception is said not to
reside in the brain, because of muscular movements after dissolu-
tion ;-fallacy of this argument, and explanation of the facts.
Mental and moral consequences of perception ;-these arise from
the primordial law of the Creator. Defective states of perception,
errors, hallucinations, &c.-whence arising. Conscience-its legiti-
mate and perverted agency-remorse distinguished from repentance.
Natural religion,-#reflection-proper influence-morbid states of.
Memory, what is it? it is not wholly mental, not simple attention

independent of the will. Distinction between physical and spiritual
memory; loss of memory-causes-forgetfulness-abstraction-ab-
sence of mind, when the brain does not receive adequate impres-
sions. Sensorial torpor-its fearfulness-impressions made, but
not attended to-a kind of dream-involuntary thought-a state
very closely allied to insanity. Deepening shades of cerebral dis-
order, and important cautions as to the treatment of this state.
Partial loss of memory explained. Imagination-its healthy func-
tions-its liability to extravagance. Reverie, to be safely indulged,
must be controlled by judgment. Its great influence upon disorder
-its tendency to monomania-agency upon other forms of malady ;
it may be rendered the means of destroying or prolonging life.
Will-already noticed (Chap. V., on Progression, &c.). Man's
moral responsibility rests on the exercise of this faculty-his power
to choose, and to refuse. When dependent on reason only, it is
feeble, and requires for its strength the aid of passion. Prevalence
of evil, and natural preference for evil. Tyranny of organic ugges-
tions. Diference between the volition of brutes, and the will of man ;
the one impulsive, the other reflective: the one animal suggestion,
the other spiritual govemment. Necessity for cultivating the de-
sire to do good, and to aid it with the motives of benevolence to
man, and love to God. Objections answered, and examples given.
Reasons for greater complexity of nervous, than of the arterial
systems. Influence of presiding mind. Particular providence,
doctrine of. Circumstances which modify the manifestations of
mind, bodily and mental, to be more
particularly noticed (Chap. X.)
hereafter. Dispute between the advocates offree will and necessity.
Important distinction between will and inclination ; frequent mis-
takes on this subject, by confounding the wish with the will.
Necessity for self-denial: this position denied by the ultra-spiri-
tualist, and by the intidel: how these extremes meet, for both
destroy moral accountability, and both by the similar error, of
aflirming man's utter helplessness. Necessity for the subjugation
of passion to principle ; distinction between repentance, and the
loathing consequent upon organic satiety; the one is moral change,
the other, animal exhaustion. But "
mental phenomena are go-
vemed by the laws of organised action." This conclusion shown
to be unphilosophical, as also the assertion, that brain, is "
mind
itself ;" all these difficulties swept away by the truth, that it is the
exponent of mind. Objection answered, that attention is not a
"
mental faculty, but a
peculiar condition of the cerebral organ.
The same reasoning applicable to the phenomena of spontaneous

recollection; beautiful, but fallacious hypothesis on this subject;
theory of organic movements. Ideas, which are
wholly organic in
their origin, are not exempted from moral consequences; and man
remains responsible for all his thoughts and actions: example of
this reasoning in social life. Disposition of certain philosophers
to lower human nature, so as to make the distinction between man
and brutes a mere difference in degree. The question of the after~
existence of brutes in another state of being, impossible to be
solved; and not important, if possible, because of man's superadded
spiritual nature. Arguments on this subject fully stated. Faculty
of imitation instinctive in its early influence; agency of fashion
chiefly operative in the young, and greatly lost in the aged; morbid
states of this faculty-its moral relations, and its influence upon
large masses of mankind, especially in bringing about political
changes.
CHAPTER VIII.
ON MENTAL nlsmsns.-Page 387.
ARGUMENT.-Morbid manifestations of mind dependent upon certain
conditions of the brain. The tyranny of organic suggestions al-
ready mentioned, and their influence as a basis for conduct dis-
proved. Consequences of following such suggestions illustrated
by the influence of himger ; necessity for subjugating selfish desire:
the infirmities of the body are not to be pleaded in excuse for the
obliquities of mind; they are to be watched against and conquered.
Influence of sleep in superseding the manifestations of mind;-
unwonted irritability and oppression of the nervous system-oppo-
site conditions, but both morbid-use of sleep-unnatural drowsi-
ness; eifect on the mental manifestations. Dreaming, not a mental,
but purely a cerebral phenomenon, arising from the primary, or
secondary irritation of some nervous fibres. Classification of
dreams according to the organic irritation which occasions them;
dreams arising from the renovation of past feelings-the recollec-
tions of by-gone impresssions-the thoughts, and anxieties, and
business of the preceding day; some irritation of the brain itself-
some impression made upon an organ of sense, or some other organ
of the body, not immediately an organ of sense, and all these pro-
ceeding from one common root-irritation of the brain. Reasons
for abjuring the hypothesis, that dreaming is a phenomenon of

mind. Dreaming affords no evidence of the soul's immortality-
no
proof of the actings of spirit at all; on the contrary, the action
is morbid and inconsistent with perfect health; and never to be
found, but when the body is more or less disturbed. Answers to
objections on account of the rapid changes in dreaming. Con-
versely, no intellectual process will produce dreaming : the incessant
talking of delirium in fever-sleep-walking-some hysterical con-
ditions-the phenomena of fainting, &c. ; other states of suspended
animation-apoplexy-concussion-slighter injuries of the brain-
mere
momentary stunning. Influence of gradual decay of the
organs upon the manifestations of mind, very diH`erent in different
individuals, yet always more or less discemible. First occurs,
diminished attention-loss of the power of concentration-peevish-
ness, and impatience of contradiction-prejudices and uncontrolled
thoughts. These symptoms vary much according as the decay
begins in loss of vascular balance, or diminished nervous energy ;
the distinction of these two states. Torpor of the brain may arise
from either condition; very slight alterations of the circulation
within the brain produce great effects-irritability-nameless and
undefined apprehension of approaching danger-slighter and deeper
shades of paralysis; all these conditions are
peculiarly liable to
spectral illusions; how accounted for; hallucinations, to disprove
which to the patient is impossible by argument; and these lapse
into insanity, or
fully-formed cerebral disorder, producing þÿgI' ¬8f» ¬l'
misery than any other form of malady. Remedies against it should
be twofold-physical and moral. Indispensable importance of long-
continued perseverance under adverse circumstances, in order to
final success. Bnites are not subject to insanity; hydrophobia
even is not an exception to this law, because it is not insanity; the
prevailing characteristic of insanity is to be found in the moral im-
pressions which pre-occupied the sufferer before the invasion of dis-
order; which become first the exclusive idea, and then lapse into
insanity. Examples in proof of this argument. Mental alienation
differs in nothing from other maladies-in its origin-its progress-
its tennination ; and the only rational treatment is based on the same
views, with the curative indications of other disorders. How is
insanity to be detected ? Difficulties of the subject, with suggestions
for their removal. Great difficulty of distinguishing physical in--
firmity from moral delinquency. Particular attention due to the
function of volition. Insanity is very frequently an amplification,
or distortion of natural character; that is, it is influenced by
original physical temperament; in every variety, it is purely a

cerebral malady. How far the deeper passions may be causes of
insanity; their outbreaks are generally consequences rather than
causes. How far religion can be tenned a cause of insanity; it
never can be in its legitimate influence; but erroneous views may:
these, however, are not religion; reasoning is quite useless. An-
swers to objections arising from the non-existence of organic disease
in the brain of the insane; disorder of function alone is suflicient
to destroy, yet organic disease is more frequent in the insane than
in others; arguments on this subject-especially those drawn from
the habits of the nervous
system. Bearing of idiocy upon this
question; also, what are called mental peculiarities; agency of
remedies; early symptoms of cerebral disorder-nervous headaches
-pericranial headaches, and distinction between them-congestive
headaches-illusions-great instability of pursuit-violence upon
triiies-general change of character, when compared with preceding
years and months. Hypochondriasis, with di order of the func-
tions of interior life; these are generally a consequence, not a cause
of insanity, as well as feebleness of the bodily muscles; the most
successful method of treatment. Demonomania-pseudo-religious
insanity. Comparison of connexion between genius and insanity,
as between religion and insanity. Injustice of ascribing the one
and not the other to insanity. Farther elucidation of this subject,
as
respects the natural and perverted influence of religion. Cau-
tions on this subject; possession; division of pseudo-religious in-
sanity, into the hopeful and the desponding ; characteristics of each
peculiarity; causes operating in producing either state, and errors
of well-meaning persons, with cautions on these subjects. Influence
of physical temperament upon each form of these peculiarities.
Accidental phenomena, arising from past circumstances, or past
trials-or sickness-or speculation-or superstition-selfishness of
the insane; their tendency to introversion; their disposition to
suicide is immense; yet every uicide is not insanity; important
distinctions, and cautions on the subject of suicide.

of the consciousness of such influence, yet great ignorance of its
extent, and widely-ramiiied agency; this influence exhibited in the
efforts of self-preservation-in the expressions ofthe countenance-
the smile-the tear-the frown, &c.; also in various emotions;
in the manifold forms of imitation-in the contraction of awkward
habits-in the moral influence of companionship-in the liability
to disorder, especially of the nervous system-in the simulation
of approaching death-and in the production of disease. Examples
of these states. Influence of mind upon the digestive organs.
Agency of mind in the cure of disease, and its application to modern
miracles. Distinction between these and genuine miracles: the
principles of true and false miraculous agency fully stated ; atten-
tion especially drawn to the nature of the cures said to have been
wmught, these being generally cases of defective nervous
energy.
Important distinction between palliative and curative treatment;
also between being ill, andfeeling ill ; there is no modem permanent
cure of any organic stntctural alteration. Important conclusions
drawn from th e premises; and necessity for the exercise of charity.
The great question of telling, or withholding from, the sick, the
extent of their danger, fully considered and discussed, as
applicable
to the several forms of acute and chronic disorder. Abuse of the
Holy Communion, as sometimes exhibited to the sick. Some ob-
servations on the case of Miss Fancourt, re-published from the
Christian Observer, and a
very recent miraculous clue by Dr.
Clanney.

Ancuusrrr.-The great distinctions of physical temperament; these
are rarely to be found uncompounded; yet may be safely classed
as the sanguineous, the choleric, or melancholic, the lymphatic,
and the nervous; the peculiar characteristics of each; their physical
agency on the body in health or disease; on the ordinary mental
manifestations, and on the disordered mental function to which
each is peculiarly liable. Each one gives its tinge to character in
health, and, still more so, in the states of disorder. Changes of
opinion, as influenced, if not produced, by alterations of physical
structure and condition during the progress of life, exhibited in dif-

ferent ages. This influence of body upon mind, though very great,
has been represented to be greater than it really is. Too great a
mechanical agency of body upon mind, has been attributed to the
latter: origin of many of its disorders accounted for: important
distinctions on this subject, and the real causes of disordered
muscular movement. Morbid sympathies, dependent upon nervous
connexion. Office of the great sympathetic nerve; important in-
ference drawn from the size and function of this nerve. Effect of
various changes, healthful and morbid, on the functions of organic
life, and upon the several manifestations of mind. Nevertheless,
these do not supersede man's moral responsibilities, which remain
the same under all the action and re-action of the nervous system
of mind on body, and body on mind. Reasons for this dependence
and reciprocal agency. The conservative power of nature; various
examples of this watchful agency, which might be indefinitely mul-
tiplied, but are here limited to the diferent habits of serous and
mucous membranes. Conservative power of sleep. Agency of the
atmosphere upon the nervous system, direct and indirect; and
upon the manifestations of mind-particularly with regard to its
dryness or dampness-its pressure. Changes of sentiment-con-
version. Political conversion, though too frequently produced by
interested motive, may be the result of this law; exemplified.
Complexity of operation of causes producing change, in an
organ
which experiences the agency of physical pressure from without,
and of spiritual commotion from within. Changes of opinion
classed under the natural and healthful-the organic and the
morbid; the first only arising from maturity of judgment. Vacilla-
tion, and obstinate adherence to expressed opinion, are, perhaps,
equally opposed to truth. Organic changes depend upon the
altered condition of the brain; elucidations of this state. The
term morbid change defined ; it is intended to represent the agency
of physical causes. Errors in judgment. Insanity; definition of
this term. Influence of physical temperament on the expression of
religious feeling; this has not been sufficiently appreciated. Re-
ligion consists in the service of the head, as in the feeling of the
heart; these properties should never be separated. Quietism is
not equanimity; examples. The manifestations of mind may be
wholly or partially disturbed; rationale of this process, which differs
also according to the original mental calibre. It is not religion
itself, but the ezpressikm of its agency, which is shown thus to vary
according to the mutable medium, through which its immutable
principles are shown. The spirit of man is unifonn and simple;

but the mode of its manifestation is infinitely diversified according
to the medium through which it is exhibited. Exemplification of
this natural law, in the results of grafting, and in other illustrations
drawn from nature. The agency of physical temperament has no
infiuence upon moral obligation. Illustration of this principle, in
the manifestations of mind produced by the influence of religion
upon minds exhibiting different physical constitutions at successive
periods of life; on the emotions of the heart; on the conduct of
the life, in sorrow and in joy-on a deathbed-and in other im-
portant situations. The same is to be remarked with regard to
certain morbid conditions of mental manifestation; examples of
several of these states in the history of past days. This same in-
fluence further shown in prayer-in active duty-and under a
variety of circumstances. Va.rious reasonings on the subject; and
illustrations of the power of the physical temperament to modify
the expression of the deep feelings of the heart. Importance of
keeping in view the motives to duty. Some effects of fanaticism
and rational explanation of the same
upon rational principles.
Result of these views ; to promote charity-diminish the influence
of prejudice-cheer the desponding-check the presumptuous-
arrest the self-willed devotee of feeling, and stimulate the feeble
and the languid.

BODY AND MIND
CHAPTER I.
Iurnonucronv sKE'rcH or-' THE sUBJEc'r.
IF we would inquire into the nature and influ-
ence of the morbid manifestations of mind, which
in every varied shape we constantly perceive around
us, we must first know something of the healthy
agencies of the manifesting organ; and we must
become acquainted with the diversified operations
of physical temperament upon the nature and dis-
position of such agencies: in fact, we must know
something of the healthy machinery, before we can
understand the deviations from its physiological
conditions.
It is a
forgetfulness of this principle which has
thrown such a
degree of abstraction over the
writings of psychological authors; and the small
amount of good which has resulted from their

2 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
investigations, may be traced to their manner of
treating mind as a
simply spiritual principle, and
overlooking the fact that it- has no mode of re-
ceiving notices, or of communicating its own
actions, except through a material medium, liable
to be influenced by health and disease, and by all
the circumstances which act upon the body gene-
rally, but especially by the original character
which has been impressed upon the manifesting
organ.
With another class of writers there exists the
opposite error, of referring every modification of
mind to the organs only, and entirely forgetting
the presiding spiritual principle, which in a
healthy
state of things should guard, govern, and direct
the bodily movements: an error this, which is as
if one referred the musical sounds of a concert to
the instruments by which they were
produced, in
entire forgetfulness of the talent which guided and
governed the execution of all those movements of
the lips and of the fingers, which bring out, and as
it were
impart life and feeling to these sounds.
It is remarkable that, in general, persons are
quite contented to carry on the functions of thought
without observing their peculiarities ;-without no-
ticing the complex nature of the operations of
mind ;-without introverting their attention, or
watching the movements of interior life. It is in-
deed strange, that man should be contented to pass
through life, even to the confines of the grave,
without trying to fathom the depths of his own
ignorance ;-without seeking to develope the ,won-

ders of his own
understanding;-without investi-
gating the nature of his own mind ;--without
endeavouring to trace to their hidden source the
various streamlets of sensation and idea which
seem to claim one common
origin ;-without seek-
ing to define and explain the emotions of the
heart;-and without applying himself in good
earnest to the study of that intellectual constitution
upon which depends so much of his present posi-
tion and future hopes, and upon which the dark
wing of the night of ignorance still broods.
Yet such is the narrow limit of the human un-
derstanding, that this inquiry is beset with ditlicul-
ties; and that chiefly because the knowledge of
frst causes is almost always beyond our reach.
The veil which conceals them throws inextricably
its entangling folds around those who would vainly
endeavour to draw it aside, and exhibit the pri-
mary movements of mind upon matter.
First principles, as they are termed, do not assist
us in this inquiry ; they are certain known results
of unknown causes, which we have traced back to
their origin, as far as we can trace them, but which
are in truth some of those innumerable secondary
effects, produced by the agency and influence of
final causes, all originating from a GREAT FIRST
CAUSE. The highest reach of the human under-
standing is, to discover something of the connection
between the two.. To endeavour to rise beyond
these first principles to their origin, is but to walk
blindfold in a
labyrinth, in which a thousand paths
conduct to error, each successive one

in another; and, at the best, only leading back the
wearied and unimproved inquirer to the very spot
from which he first started.
In reference to our
present object, this know-
ledge is unnecessary, even were it attainable. It
is not necessary to be acquainted with the ultimate
nature of light, of heat, of oxygen, in order to trace
their effects. It is not indispensable to possess an
intimate knowledge of the principle of lyk, in
order to study its phenomena. We need not then
hesitate to acknowledge the existence of an un-
lmown proximate cause of mental action, nor to
investigate its results so far as human nature can
conduct us; the inquiry is strictly an inductive
one, and we
presume only to follow where nature
and science lead.
We do not propose to write a treatise on the
philosophy of mind, nor on what are called mental
diseases; but rather to point out the influence of
physical temperament, both upon the healthy and
the morbid manifestations of' mind; or, in other
words, to trace the influence of cerebral structure
upon its function, and to show how far the
emotion which is in itself qviritual, or the impres-
sion which is in itself external, may be charac-
terised by the organ through which these are
severally given out or received. In conducting
this inquiry, it may be desirable also to glance
at the intellectual condition of the lover animals ;
and sure we are, that if one half of the acuteness
of thought and reasoning, and one half of the
diligence, which have been almost wasted on the

science of mind, had been devoted to our present
purpose, we should not still have had to lament
that an
impenetrable veil seemed to be drawn over
the mode of action of the brain,-over the mani-
festations of mind,-and over the relations of the
organ, to its intellectual and moral disturbances.
In the following pages we do not profess to draw
aisde this veil, but we
hope to raise at least one of
its folds, by directing the attention to the influence
of physical temperament upon the manifestations
of mind, both in health and during disorder; and in
some measure to attempt to trace back their reci-
procal agencies, in confirming or
disturbing the
mental operations.
The influence of these views upon the objects
and the prospects of education; the extent to which
this subject is occupying public attention; and the
indispensable necessity for fixing its direction ac-
cording to the peculiar temperament, induce us to
devote, in the first instance, some time to this
subject, rendered doubly important by the extent
to which its machinery is applied.
The brain, as well as the senses, requires educa-
tion in order to secure its greatest amount and
perfectness of action. It is only in proportion to
the developement of its power, that it gradually
arrives at precision in the exercise of its functions.
Thus, for example, its perception, memory, and
imagination, which are consecutive to and deter-
mined by sensation, grow and expand in proportion
as
they are called into exercise. And again,
judgment, of which these form the triple base,

associates the ideas thus obtained, at first indeed
very imperfectly; but gradually, and by use, and
by the correction of frequent errors, arriving at a
considerable degree of accuracy.
It will not be out of place, thus early in our
inquiry, to remark an essential difference between
mental and organic life. There is no want of
education, for instance, to the stomach; it per-
forms its functions without teaching, and is in no
way improved by any increase of knowledge. And
so, also, with regard to the other departments of
organic life; they admit not of instruction, their
full power is inherent in themselves.
While, however, the brain admits of, and re-
quires, a
process of education, it must be allowed,
on the other hand, that each individual possesses
a natural character, conferred by physical tempera-
ment, which, though it may be modfed, sqftened,
directed, and improved, by the presiding mind,
cannot be entirely changed, and always gives a
tinge to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of its
possessor.
A little reflection will show, that so far as the
expression of feeling and thought is characterised
by physical.temperament, so far it is placed under
the agency of physical causes; and, however it
may be controlled, cannot be superseded. Habit
and exercise may develope power on the one hand,
and give increased facilities of action, but they
will not alter the character of the mental manifes-
tations. Opposite principles may be brought out
to modify the effects of physical temperament, and

indeed it is this natural character which for the
most part requires the exercise of principle. Edu-
cation may moderate the influence of physical
temperament, and may deepen reflection, and may
strengthen and enlarge the judgment, so as to
render mind superior to the impulse of bodily pas-
sion, by a constant reference to the first principles
of moral action. But it is not in her power to
supersede those bodily influences which constitute
the sum of man's natural character, such as we
should find him unrefined by civilization-unim
fluenced by the higher moral motives-unguided
by religion,--a prey to selfish desire-the creature
of passion-with no
hope beyond the gratification
of to-day-with no aspirations after futurity.

8 THE RBCIPROCAL INFLUENCE
CHAPTER II.
RECIPROCITY OF BODILY AND MENTAL INFLUENCE,
APPLIED TO EDUCATION.
IT is very certain that education must proceed ;
a
mighty stimulus has been applied to the intel-
ligence of man, and its operation can no
longer be
controlled: knowledge of some kind, good or bad,
useful or
injurious, he will obtain. For the desire
has been created, and, as in the case of a starving
people, food they will luwe, though at the risk of
breaking up the foundations of their most dearly
cherished social institutions : so the thirst for know-
ledge has been cultivated into appetite, and it now
stands forward in all the vehemence of passion,
whose voice will be heard, and the whisper of
whose suggestion must be attended to. It is no
longer a
question whether man is to be taught, but,
rather, how and what he is to be taught: the prin-
ciple that knowledge is good in itself, seems to be
admitted, and the great point of doubt is as to the
kind and degree of knowledge to be imparted.
A review of the past few years would show that

or Bom' AND MIND. 9
the mind had been gradually undergoing prepara-
tion for this change; and that unless ignorance
were allowed to die a natural death, it must soon
be destroyed by the spirit of man
struggling after
liberty and independence, and unfortunately over-
acting its part, so as to convert these real blessings
into the poisonous fruits of licentiousness, and a
too prominent contempt for all authority, which
would place a barrier to the exclusive reign of
selfish desire.
The results which have flowed from the adoption
of the principle that man must be taught, could
scarcely have been anticipated by its first pro-
mulgators. And yet it is now
easy to see how,
that if every man must be taught a little, each
would be raised in his own estimation precisely in
proportion to the knowledge he possessed; and
that thus trenching upon the grade of society next
immediately above him, that grade also must con-
sent to add to its former stock of information and
intelligence, so that it may not be amalgamated
with that which was the lower, but may still be
able to maintain that distinction of spirits in
society which is so
indispensable to its well-being.
This principle once set in motion, would con-
tinue to operate on the ascending scale of being,
of social man, even to the highest and most culti-
vated of the sons and daughters of intellect and
refinement. A little observation upon the changes
which have taken place in society during the last
thirty years, will sufliciently demonstrate the truth
of this position. And we
would fain hope, not-

10 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
withstanding the evils which have arisen, that the
change has been for the most part beneficial: for
although it has developed in some instances an
impertinent and misplaced show of knowledge,-
and although the race of literary coxcombs, and
pedants, and pretenders has increased,-yet this is a
small evil when contrasted with the amount of real
knowledge which has been diffused, the power
of usefulness which has been conferred on tens of
thousands, and the multiplied comforts which have
arisen to mankind; with all the collateral advan-
tages which have attached to the increased and
increasing attention to every call of charity, to
every suggestion of benevolence. The zephyr of
enlarged and liberal feeling has hushed to repose
the gusts of passion, and the storms and clouds of
intolerance; and the sunshine of peace, and the
glory of knowledge, have replaced the darkness of
error and the gloom of bigotry : the human mind
is no
longer held in the degrading thraldom of
thinking in the same track which others have pre-
viously and so
blindly followed: but it is per-
mitted, nay, encouraged, to stand forth in all its
native loveliness, and strength, and beauty of form
and character; while each day gives it stability,
by enlarging the base on which it rests, and adds
fresh polish to the column which is reared upon it.
Still it must be confessed that this good is not
without some corresponding evil. Under the genial
warmth of the light of intellectual progress, there
has been developed an innumerable and misshapen
brood of parasites, which have first defaced and

then destroyed the leaves of the tree of knowledge ;
while a thousand pigmy shapes of lesser evil,
which had passed unnoticed in the gloom, have
been forced into a state of impertinent observation :
the good laws of legitimate authority have been
thrown aside, and the human mind has claimed
for itself a recklessness of thoughtless, selfish, and
impassioned action, which would sacrifice any good
at the shrine of present inclination. Society has
become a series of concentric but uncombined
circles, without a common centre, and without a
suflicient bond of union to preserve it from destruc-
tion by the first wave of popular discontent; and
its foundation has been undermined by removing
that cement (the bond of union for general good)
upon which the integrity of the column was de-
pendent.
We might indeed trace (and the inquiry would
not be without considerable interest to the mental
philosopher) the variety of consequences which
have flowed from the mighty impetus thus com-
municated to the operations of the understanding,
an
impetus which has constantly gathered, and is
still acquiring momentum as it rolls along, accord-
ing to the compounded ratio of all the cerebral
energy which it everywhere enlists in its support,
and in various ways converts into operative power ;
a
principle possessing a new
creating energy, and
which is therefore constantly reproducing itself,
and will continue to do so, unless interrupted by
some morbikl condition, until the human intellect

has reached its highest aim, and there can be no
longer any place for exertion.
But we
may not be seduced from our
path by
every interesting point of view which presentsa claim
to our attention in the richly-diversified scenery
of life's magnificent landscape; and although we
might rejoice to linger over the successive mani-
festations of this wonder-working principle, and to
trace its hidden agencies, as well as its more overt
influence, yet we
prefer, for the present, passing
over the many phenomena which mark the stirring
advances of mind, in order that we
may ask what
itiswhich has given encouragement and support
to this mighty and successive developement of its
manifestations.
In one word, it is the progress of public opinion
by which the strongholds of prejudice have been
undermined; conscious bigotry has sought the
obscurity which is alone congenial to its sickly
growth; ignorance has been shamed out of its con-
tinuance, and the measure of knowledge which
would have enabled an individual to pass current in
society, has been immensely enlarged. The indo-
lent have been roused, and have been feelingly
taught, that if they will be supine, others will
distance them in the race of competition, and will
carry off tl1e prize, which, in its just proportion,
has been offered to all as thc legitimate meed of
industry and talent combined.
Such has been this progress, that in order to
command public respect and influence, man must

be first entitled to its possession, not by the exterior
glare of his situation, but by the real weight of his
powers and acquirements; and thus, in some
happy measure, the race is not confined to the
privileged few, but is accessible to all.
It will at once be admitted as a truth, that in
every class ol' society there are individual pecu-
liarities of mental calibre, and of that point of
intellectual expansion, to which each can attain.
Yet it will also be admitted, that in proportion as
the individual is fully placed under the influence
of the laws of habit and association, and graduated
exertion, so will his power of acquisition and of'
action be increased, till he has reached the utmost
verge of human investigation and attainment.
The pride Q" man revolts from the admission that
the God of nature has everywhere placed a limit to
research, which it exceeds the power of man to
overstep; and in acknowledging this so
humbling
truth, we rejoice, that although Nature has given
nothing to man without much labour, yet with an
all-bounteous hand she has dispensed her favours
liberally to the diligent.
Such, however, is the powerful influence of mind
over matter, that this limit may, for a
lengthened
and apparently indefinite series of advances, be
constantly thrown more and more backward, while
a
greater fulness and prominence may be given to
the attributes of mind.
We have ascribed this advance to the influence
of mind upon matter, because we believe that the
original difference of mental manifestation is depen-

14 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
dent first upon the physical constitution of the
brain and nervous
system. W'e are not mate-
rialists, nor are we
thorough-paced believers in the
speculations of the cranioscopists* of our
day;
but we do believe that the natural hind and degree
of mental manifestation is dependent upon, and
characterised by, physical constitution; and that
this latter may be modified by causes
operating
upon it ; and, through it, upon the expression of the
perceptions, associations, and actions of the imma-
terial principle.
A single glance at
society will demonstrate this
proposition. In cach one of its successive stages,
from the lowest to the highest, will be found a
difference of physical temperament, and a corre-
sponding distinction in the manifestations of mind ;
obscure and obtuse in the lowest, frequently feeble
and morbidly acute in the highest, and perhaps
reaching the maximum of power and strength in
the middle ranks of life. This rule may be influ-
enced by situation and circumstances, by health
and disease, by education, by laws, habits, religion,
and many other causes; still the principle exists,
and will be found intact; the manifestations of
mind are characterized by physical temperament.
This proposition requires a little further deve-
lopement. Man is a
complex animal, compounded
of the most exquisite organization, and of the
highest order of spiritual intelligence; at least in
so far as we have any acquaintance with the nature
and essence of spiritual existence. A very slight

attention to the operations of mind will, however,
show that, from some cause or other, these are
exceedingly limited in their extent; that a natural
thirst for knowledge is grievously eounteracted by
the difficulties in the way of obtaining it ;-that
the pathway of science is intricate, and beset with
thorns and briers;-that its ascent is rendered
steep and wearisome ;-and that the laborious hours
of the schoolboy, when marked by industry and
perseverance, do not result from any natural apti-
tudes for literature, but commonly more from the
fear of punishment than the love of acquisition.
Yet we do see some few finer spirits vanquish
every difficulty, and in the full tide of their zeal
overcome
every obstacle; yea, go forward in the
paths of knowledge with enthusiastic delight,
counting no
present attainment suflicient, while
there remains within their view another more
distant yet accessible point. Moreover, we do see
dW`erent individuals excelling in dwerent pursuits ;
and this arising, not simply from exclusive devo-
tion to one or the other, but apparently from
possessing some
original aflinities towards one
object in particular. How are these things to be
accounted for, but by supposing that the immate-
rial spirit does not now
possess those full powers for
which it was
originally designed ?-that there is
some cause in the way of its more
complete and
easy growth and advance towards maturity ?--and
that these natural difficulties are
only overcome
by
the undefined peculiarities of those few who are

16 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
constantly reaching forward towards the perfection
of intellect?
Now, if we could ascertain wherein this pecu-
liarity consisted, .we should be enabled to explain
the other diiliculties of the problem. In our
opinion, this difference will be found in the pecu-
liar aptitude of the brain for particular intellectual
and spiritual manifestation. It is allowed that the
operations of the spiritual principle are not extended,
but, on the contrary, are curtailed by its union with
matter. We all know how much the workings of
thought are
impeded by the materiality of spoken
language, and still more
by the material process
of fixing the ideas thus embodied upon paper.
Yet, without these material processes, man would
possess no
power of communicating his thoughts;
and thus remaining as an isolated being in crea-
tion, he would become a
prey to the solitude of his
own bosom, wandering in the gloomy night of
unmitigated sorrow, and unparticipated enjoyment.
Thus man is dependent for the manifestation of his
spiritual attributes ; or, in other words, for the
knowledge of his mental functions, to their material
organ the brain. And in proportion as this organ
is originally more or less perfect, as well as accord-
ing to its native peculiarities, so will be the aptitude
for peculiar pursuits, and the success with which
they will be attended.
This result seems to depend upon a
general phy-
siological law: and the original greater or less ap-
proach to the more
perfect state is strongly marked

in different individual animals of the same species.
The sagacity of the horse and the dog are
prover-
bial: but all horses and all dogs are not equally
sagacious; and the difference is to be sought in
the conformation or construction of their brains.
The same
principle is applicable to man, since
he also possesses a similar, but more perfect orga-
nization ; and in him is superadded the immate-
rialprinczjzle. Still this immaterial soul is equally
dependent, notfor its actions, but for the manifesta-
tion of those actions, as well as for the expression of
thought and feeling, upon matter; and brain is
as
necessary to the exhibition of thought in man as
it is to the development of instinct in him, in com-
mon with the lower animals.
If we
required a confirmation of this principle,
we should find it in the agency of exterior circum-
stances; we should discover it in the steady pursuit
of health, and in the brilliant coruscations of
intellect under the excitement of cerebral stimula-
tion; as well as in the vacillation of the invalid,
the feeble will, the impaired memory, the deficient
imagination of the convalescent, and in the inapti-
tude and listlessness of sickness: and to place at
once in close juxtaposition, both ends of this series
of phenomena, we should find it in the constant
spiritual aspirations of the creature of intelligence
and piety, as in the absolute annihilation of mental
manifestation of the idiot.
Again, collision with other minds, or the energy
of competition, will, by its stimulus to the organ,
enable it to do more than it could have done with-

out this excitement: and, moreover, it is constantly
subjected to that law of progressive action, and of
habit, by which every organ capable of sustaining
a certain degree of exertion now, will be enabled to
do a little more
shortly afterwards; and so may be
carried on to an extent and depth of manifestation,
which at first could not have been anticipated.
The important inference we would draw from
this discussion, is, the necessity there exists for at-
tending to the health, and cultivating the growth,
of the organ, and of placing it under favourable
circumstances for its fullest development.
Education is not sinqnly and exclusively a
spiri-
tual process; nor will it be perfected, unless the
organ upon which it primarily acts be secured
from all morbid irritation, and be gradually con-
ducted to its highest powers of natural action : the
object therefore of education is twofold, viz. phy-
sical and intellectual.
We shall presently revert to this subject; but
here we
only wish to insist upon a
principle, which
will easily account for many of the supposed ano-
malies, or which have passed as such, because they
were not comprehended; and which will promote
enlarged and benevolent views towards those who
cannot see, and think, and feel, and reason with the
same organ. It is, however, abundantly clear,
that the immaterial principle presides over that
organ, through which its operations are manifested ;
that it is not the servant or slave of cerebral pecu-
liarity, but that the latter is placed under tl1e wise
direction and government of the former; that man

is a
_free agent ; that by the agency of his will, he
can control, or
suspend, or
encourage, or stimu-
late any one of his peculiarities; and that he is
morally responsible for all those actions which
result, not from the irritation of matter upon mind,
but from the agency of thought, and feeling, and
judgment, and principle, and reason, and con-
science, upon their (as it ought to be) obedient
servant the brain, the organ by which the faculties
of the immaterial intelligence are manifested.
Here also we see the influence of opinion upon
man-an influence which remarkably exhibits the
manner in which he is subjected to the twofold
agency of physical structure and moral motive; for
it is clear, that the condition of his physique operates
in modifying the manifestations of his morale;
while again the influence of the latter is very great
upon the power and capacity for action of the
_/ormer.
Thus, in the matter of education, the progress of
public opinion has' declared, that man must he
taught : has irrevocably proclaimed, that ignorance
is an evil which ought to be removed; and has
consigned the opposite hypothesis, to the constantly
:narrowing circle of the few, who love not knowledge
ibr its own sake, because they cannot appreciate its
value; and of those more
designing individuals
who dread the diffusion of information, lest it
should unfold their machinations, and put an end
to the thraldom in which they would fain continue
to hold the minds of many, by preserving power
(Z. e.
knowledge) in the hands of lew.

20 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
But public opinion has declared its compassion
for the former class, and has pronounced so de-
cidedly in favour of freedom of thought, that none
can with any hope of success aspire to chain it
down within its former limits. It has become that
broad and ample stream, which, duly regulated,
may convey health and fertility throughout its
course; while any attempt to restrain its onward
flow would result only in so
accumulating its mo-
mentum by opposition, as that it should overwhelm
everything in its way, and prove an occasion of de-
vastation and misery, till it had regained its ori-
ginal channel; when passing on in peace, it will
again convey blessings to all around.
And it must flow on : the great object in view is,
so to preserve its banks from dilapidation, as that it
shall be enabled to convey on its broad and ample
bosom the fullest amount of good, without danger
to surrounding institutions from its occasional out-
breaks. Religion and reason are the appointed
safeguards, and wrru THESE on the right hand and
on the left, there is no
danger from the widest dif-
fusion of useful knowledge. The immortal mind
can no
longer be subjected to despotic control;
and in order to the security of our ancestral, social,
political, and religious institutions, these must live
in the affections of the many who are
capable of
appreciating their value ; they must ensure the
approbation of the wise and good, and they must
do so
by the amount of good which they commu-
nicate, and the amount of evil for which they pro-
vide a
remedy.

Moreover, public opinion has long declared, and
is every day declaring in louder strains, that as
large
and liberal a
policy as is consistent with the con-
servative principle of nature, and with that general
cession of individual rights to the few, for the good
government of the many, is, under all circum-
stances, the talisman by which security may be
obtained, rebellious spirits may be controlled, the
good may be encouraged, and the bad may be pre-
vented doing mischief to themselves or others.
Narrow, and confined, and selfish views will defeat
their own ends; and nothing but that which seeks
to promote its own
power by the happiness and
worth of others, can
long avail. It is to be recol-
lected, however, that these views are
decidedly op-
posed to the ultra-liberalism of the day, which will
be found, on close inspection, actually to originate
in these very narrow, and confined, and selfish
dogmas, tending to the dissolution, not to the con-
servation, of the connecting links of social order.
It has also been declared by common consent,
that the amount of information which was suiii-
cient a few years since, will no longer preserve its
possessor from ridicule, will no longer prevent his
being fairly elbowed by more industrious com-
petitors; and that if any lay claim to the intellec-
tual respect of his fellow man, it must be by deserv-
ing it, by having gained superiority of mind, by
superior industry, and by justly demanding atten-
tion from solidity of judgment and extent of ac-
quisition.

To this end intellectual man must be educated,

22 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
and must avail himselfof all the advantages afforded
by his situation, in order to create that legitimate
influence which arises from the majesty of mind.
This however is not to be accomplished by any
simply mechanical process; and in order to success,
education must be preserved from the domain of
empiricism, and must be placed under the regula-
tion of fixed and suitable principles. The days of
prosperous charlatanism are for the most part
rapidly passing away; the human mind has ad-
vanced to a state of improvement, in which it is no
longer to be duped by a
system of irrational influ-
ence, based as it may be on the unreal fears and
imaginary joys of credulity. These are the mighty
weapons so
lavishly wielded by the Papal church,
for preserving the human mind in the dark thral-
dom of ignorance, and are
decidedly opposed to the
means for recalling it, as far as human agency can
do so, to wear again the image of the Almighty
Creator in the likeness of which it was at first
created.
In this country, at least, we
hope there is no
danger of the successful exertion of this sinister
bias ; we hope that the mummeries of popery,-the
austerities qfpenance-the sale of indulgences-the
history of the holy scapular-the absurdities of
purgatory--purchased prayers for the dead, and all
the lucrative inventions of a
crafty priesthood,--we
hope, at least, that all these evils have perished be-
fore the light of truth ; that the receptacle for holy
water has been clean purged by the flow of the sacred
stream of knowledge, and that the character of the

professed minister of Christ can no
longer claim
the mysterious homage of the priest, but must
rest its pretensions entirely on the attributes of the
good man ; in fact, must appeal for its influence
to the reason and reflection of admirers.
We trace the operation of the same
principle
under other circumstances. Thus the storm can
no
longer be employed as an instrument of terror,
and as an exhibition of the wrath of the offended
Majesty of heaven: its rationale is explained-its
signal benefits are understood, and gratitude to a
God of infinite beneficence has supplied the place of
that undefined alarm, which was so
long cherished
for unworthy purposes in the bosom of man.
So, also, the light of science has beamed upon the
night of spectral illusions : and the only remnant of
reality which ever attached to these symbols offear,
has been that of the fatal influence exerted over
them by returning daylight; the sun of knowledge
has dawned upon them; yea, they have been dis-
sipated into thin air by the day-star of investiga-
tion, and the place of their locality has known them
no more.
Once more, the earth-born sons of ZEsculapius
HAD maintained their hold upon the human mind,
by an invidious appeal to the hopes and fears of
man's bosom ; those powerful emotions, which°,
craftily employed, had contributed to preserve a
sway which will no
longer be yielded, except by
the assent of reason, to the majesty of mind. Now,
when an
opinion is delivered by these adepts, they
must be prepared to defend it, by an appeal to

24 THE nEc1PRocAL INFLUENCE
the understanding, and by the conviction of judg-
ment; or, it will be estimated as it deserves to be,
viz. as a tattered shred of that juggling, whose
requiem was chanted when man first began to
think clearly and to reason
soundly.
And thus it is with avariety of other illustrations,
adapted to every department of life, increasing in
proportion as each is withdrawn farther from ma-
thematical demonstration, and is placed more imme-
diately on the manifestations of mind. We do not
assert that these correct views have entirely super-
seded the chimeras and hippogriffs of the olden
time, but we do say, that they have done much to-
wards this happy issue, and are yet in daily pro-
gress; and we add, that the quackery of systematic
education must eventually give way to the circula-
tion of enlightened principles, and to the cultiva-
tion of the human intellect. A few barren scraps
of Latin, and Greek, and French, will no
longer
fill the desires of the mind; its education must be
intelligent, not automatic ; and principles of reason
and of conduct must now
occupy that debateable
ground, which has been long contended for between
ignorance and prejudice on the one hand, and on
the other by that pseudo-knowledge, which, with
the semblance of information, would leave its pos-
sessor without a
single ray of duty, to become the
easy victim of oppression, or the cruel sport of ill-
regulated passion, or uncontrolled desire.
But it can no
longer be: man has awakened as
from an
uneasy dream; and though the recollec-
tion of its circumstances may have passed away

with the first waking train of thought, yet he
trembles to slumber again, lest the same distracting
images should be presented to him, and lest he
should lose the delightful consciousness of exercis-
ing his reasoning powers, in the way best calcu-
lated to promote the designs of his Creator.
The objects, the pursuit of which should be pro-
posed to himself by the mental philosopher, are,
health of body and soundness of mind, so as to
ensure, by this combination, the largest quantity of
intelligence which may be compatible with the
firmest corporeal fibre; secondly, the formation of the
social character, so as to render each individual
generally acceptable to the largest possible number
of his compeers, provided always that these he
among the wise and good; and, thirdly, to regu-
late his passions, to destroy his selfish propensities,
and to develope the virtues, and the feelings, and
the principles of social life, so as to form at once
the valuable acquaintance, tl1e faithful friend, the
good relative, the consistent patriot, and the obe-
dient subject.
Our attention must be directed for a short time
to these particulars. We have already stated, that
man is a free agent, that he has power to choose the
good, and refuse the evil ; that he has the control
of his will, and that he is consequently responsible
for all he says, or does, or thinks. But in conse-
quence of some
perverting agency, he is so
entirely
prone to prefer the evil, and to be indifferent to the
good, that the repression of the former, and the
growth of the latter, are
objects of considerable

difficulty. Yet we are not supinely to ascribe all
the mischief we discover to this cause ; nor
quietly
to rest contented under its operation, as
though such
a state of things were
entirely beyond our con-
trol.
It is a
duty to inquire into the occasional causes
of this evil. Let, for instance, each parent ask his
own conscience, how far he may himself have
fostered these deviations from rig/zt, by a neglect of
duty, by a
forgetfulness of the course pointed out
to him by reason and religion, by example and by
habit, by taking education too much as a
thing of
course, by a distortion of its objects, by the omis-
sion of` some
part of its primary designs, or
by the
want of that care, and caution, and persevering
diligence, with which they should have been carried
out and developed. Let him again ask his own
conscience, if his attention has been directed to the
control of evil, and to the encouragement of good
passions, or to the excitement and regulation of the
desires of the opening mind in the nursery. Rather
let him say, if the early years of childhood have not
been suffered to lie wasted in this infantile micro-
cosm. Wasted! did we
say? Have they not
been cruelly abandoned to the spoliation inflicted
by the unmitigated waywardness of cerebral pro-
pensity? Have they not been yielded to the con-
flicting tendencies of unlimited caprice, indulged
in every possible form ? Has not this early vantage
ground been abandoned to the enemy; and has
not the growth of evil been promoted by absolute
indifference, or
by irregular and unprincipled

opposition? But where this has been the case,
man ceases to be a
free agent, yet, most unfortu-
nately, Without losing his accountability; for the
voice of reason is stifled by the clamour of passion ;
justice and benevolence yield their sway to selfish-
ness; the firmness of the will is repressed by the
superiority of present desire; the appeal of judg-
ment is no longer heard in the unholy agitation of
contending influences ; the monitions of conscience
are
inadequate to grapple with the power of imme-
diate gratification; infant man becomes the crea-
ture of impulse, and he is hurried on at the bidding
of every fresh emotion, into all the obliquities of
animal propensity, and into entire forgetfulness of
those laws, which are founded not only in the
nature of things, but on that sublime code of
christian ethics, which has been transmitted to us
as the rule of daily life: and this, too, without
losing his responsibility, because the evil has arisen
from the neglect of developing that germ of good
which was in him, and leaving the_spiritual to be-
come the abject slave of the animal nature.
Thus it would appear, that the free agency of
the man is depending upon the education of the
child; for if this be not what it ought to be,-rather
shall we
say, if it be what it too
generally is,-
he will become the slave of his passions and pro-
pensities, and he will lose his intellectual and
spiritual freedom. No wonder, then, that we trace
around us so much evil, so little good, such
starveling intellects, such stunted charity, so
great a
host of malignant passions, spreading over nature's

28 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
fair domain, and enshrouding her finest propor~
tions; for they have been brooded over with
fostering though nnwonted care; and the existence
of this frightful progeny has scarcely been admitted,
or even
suspected, till, in the undeniable features of
maturity, it has not only hid defiance to control,
but has claimed for itself the supremacy of govern-
ment. O that man were wise ! that he would
consider the lesson thus afforded him by reliection !
How greatly would the sum of individual happiness
and virtue be increased! How immensely would
the aggregate of good be augmented by the accu-
mulation of all these individual sums!
To this end, a first claim to attention is presented
by all which relates to the health of the body ; and
of those several organs and functions, which, in their
influence immediate or remote, exert a
generic or
specific agency upon the organ of mind :' and a
second and not inferior claim is to be found for all
those processes, through which the dominion of in-
tellect may be enlarged, the evil passions and pro-
pensities may be controlled, and the mind may be
prepared for that moral and religious training,
which is to complete the perfection of man as a
rational and accountable being.
One of the first laws of physical or organic life,
is, that in order to secure its healthy function,
every organ must be ea:e1'cised; that lengthened
repose is fatal to its tone ; and that excessive exer-
tion, or irritative action, will result in diminished
power or feeblencss. And this is especially true of
the brain.

or nonv AND MIND. Q9
Again, the brain is associated with other organs,
whose direct or
sympathetic influence will exert a
beneficial or a morbid agency, according to the
state of health or disorder of those secondary
organs.
And, lastly, the capacity of the brain for exertion
is progressive, for it is a law of the human mind,
that it cannot be stationary; if it do not advance,
it must retrograde. But its physiological condition
is to seek after improvement; to carry its powers
and principles onwards towards perfection ; never to
be contented with the attainment of to-day, but to
be always advancing ; and finally to be seeking after
that happy immortality, which alone can
employ
all its faculties, or
satisfy all its desires. This con-
sideration will unravel many an
intricacy of mental
manifestation, and wanting this clue, it would be
impossible to explore, what would then appear to
be, an inextricable labyrinth.
The education of the brain, then, as the organ of
thought, becomes a
question of primary import-
ance; for although the immaterial principle will
remain the same under any mode of its exhibi-
tion, yet the manifestation of its influence will be
widely different, and the result upon the individual
himself, and upon those with whom he stands asso-
ciated in a nearer or less intimate connexion, will
scarcely be recognized as coming from the same
spiritual origin. Good or evil, blessing or
cursing,
are
mainly in the power of the instructor; and as
the mind can
only be reached throughits material
organ, it is of the first consequence to consider that

30 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
organ, to estimate fairly its physical relations, to
judge how far it may also be acted upon through
the medium of intellectual manifestation, as well as
the degree in which it may be guided by moral
and religious principles and motives.
With regard to the agency of physical education,
in promoting or
obstructing these views, two very
opposite errors
prevail: the first, in which every
effort is made to stimulate the brain, and to produce
little prodigies of intellectual development and
acquisition, an error which very generally termi-
nates in the destruction of life, or conducts pari
passu to infantile decrepitude ; and the second, in
which the brain is allowed to remain quiescent
during the early years of childhood.
And it may be fairly asked why? Nature has
taken abundant care to perfect the organ early, to
supply it with all that it would require in order to
maintain action; and she has declared, that the
senses are given us, as so many channels for the
reception of ideas. Why, then, it may be asked,
may not attention be awakened to these ideas?
Why may not reflection be developed, and associa-
tion cultivated? In fact, why may not the organ
of mind be led to think, to reason, to combine?
When the senses are
perpetually employed so as to
repress intellectual manifestation, why may they
not also be engaged in promoting its growth? The
effect of regular and moderate exercise, is to in-
crease the aptitude of every organ for its peculiar
function, to 'give it strength, to preserve it from too
high a degree of susceptibility, to furnish it with

such a
regular supply of blood, as shall enable it to
maintain increased action without suffering, and so to
strengthen its vessels and its _/ibres, as that the former
shall not easily admit of over-action, distension, or
congestion; nor the latter of too great tension or
irritation, upon every application of more than ordi-
nary stimulus.
On the contrary, a state of repose is fatal to these
good results, because it places the organ in a
pecu-
liar state of irritability, unequal to its due measure
of physiological action, exposed to a
degree of feeble-
ness commensurate with the duration of its listless
inactivity, furnished only with such a
supply of
blood as shall enable it to vegetatc, (for the supply
is always equal to the dernand,) and placing its
vascular apparatus, and its sentient libres, in a
condition favourable to the development of every
morbid action.
It is a
perfect mistake to suppose that the brain
will suffer from judicious exercise : it is injudicious
and fitful exertion, grafted upon a state offeebleness
resulting from lengthened inaction, which is to be
feared ; and its means of preservation from such a
state are, by gradual employment, to awaken the
powers of intellect, and to
carry them safely on-
ward to their highest reach.
In accomplishing this object, the only caution
necessary to be observed, is not to induce excessive,
or irritative action. This may be occasioned by
long-continued exertion, giving rise to fatigue and
exhaustion, these being followed by a morbid state

of irritability, and oftentimes by greater forts, and
a
consequent semblance q`power ; but really accom-
panied by a diminished capacity for exertion, a state
which, if now mistaken, will soon resultin diflicultly-
recoverable feebleness. The same event may be
brought about, by the abuse of stimuli, and by the
lavish excitement of feeling and emotion, rather
than by the cool growth of intellect, and judgment,
and principle.
These are evils which would endanger the ulti-
mate integrity, and assuredly would diminish the
immediate power of the brain, and should serve as
beacons to guide the pathway of the instructor.
That there should be diliiculties to surmount, is one
of the laws of the probationary state in which we
live, and these should only serve to define the way
in which we
may securely walk, so as to obtain a
high degree of healthful, intellectual manifestation.
Every step in advance will not only be a
point
gained against ignorance, and error, and obliquity,
but it will form a
resting place, from which to set
out for further progress; and these advances and
resting places may be multiplied in an indefinite
series ; and they will proceed in an
augmenting
ratio, because every such advance adds to the
future power of acquisition; and, therefore, after a
certain number of steps have been gained, the
capacity for reaching onwards has been increased to
such an extent, that the same effort will produce
an accumulating qfect; the sphere of intellectual
vision will be enlarged, and the mind will be early

conversant with objects, which, but for this gra-
duated exertion, it could scarcely have hoped to
attain.
Surely, then, it can
require only a moderate share
of intelligence to perceive, how important it is to
develope the physical powers of the organ of mind,
in order to ensure the largest amount ofintellectual
manifestation which is compatible with unbroken
bodily health.
To secure the latter, it must not be forgotten,
that the organ of mind is associated intimately with
other organs and functions; and that it is influ-
enced by their health or disorder; and this, too,
whether they may be mutually and immediately
dependent upon each other; or whether the con-
nexion be only one of sympathy, a term which
perhaps designates a hidden relationshqn, whose
laws we
may be as
yet unable precisely to inves-
tigate.
This term, however, is not to be deridcd as a
synonym for ignorance of certain conditions; for it
is not so ; it implies and intends, where it is morbid,
the capacity of suffering with a distant organ in a
state of irritation ; and it is by no means
necessary
that we should be enabled to say in what this
irritation consists, or to trace the mode of its opera-
tions; it is suilicient to show that it does exist ;
and imbecility alone can doubt it.
One of the most important of these associated
organs, and by far the most cruelly abused, is the
stomach. In point of fact, it often seems to be the
great object of instruction, to educate the powers of

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
this organ, and not even contented with gastro-
nomic development, to diminish those powers by op-
pression. If man were a
polype, if he were all
stomach, this might be unobjectionable ; if he were a
mere
assemblage of bones, and muscles, and nerves,
a caveat might even here be indeed entered, with-
out insisting very largely upon its observance; but
if he be an intellectual, a social, a
spiritual, an
immortal being-then, indeed, it were absurd, it
were criminal, so to abuse that stomach, as to repress
the intellectual, blunt the social, and obscure the
spiritual manifestations, so as to leave no
ust traces
of that "
longing after immortality
"
which should
characterize his thoughts and actions.
The proposition reduces itself to the most simple
form. While the stomach receives only so much
as is required by the necessities of the system, so
long does the brain remain unconscious of having to
support its action ; the work is well, because auto-
matically, performed, and the body is in health.
But when one
step in advance is taken, and appe-
tite is gratified to repletion, the brain becomes con-
scious of having its energies directed to the stomach ;
it is weakened and oppressed; its aptitude for
intellectual exertion is diminished or
destroyed;
the manifestations of mind become feeble or dis-
torted, and a degree of mal-aise in the system is
produced, during the continuance of which, healthy
mental progress is impossible.
Now since the state of the stomach is very much
within our control; and since it is the most
frequent distant cause of that cerebral irritation

which so
commonly terminates in disorganizing
change, it is the highest reach of folly, and of
prejudice, so to stimulate its powers, as that they
should interfere with the healthy action of the
brain.
The mischief, when produced, does not terminate
with the irritation of the day ; since this oppression
frequently repeated, results in such permanent
change of the sympathizing organ, that itself loses
power, and is no
longer capable of the same
amount of intellectual manifestation. And this
enfeebling cause operates in an inverse ratio with
exercise; for, as each step in advance gives an
augmented capacity for future acquisition, so each
successive irritation occasions that retrograde move-
ment, which is accompanied by a
constantly-de-
creasing power for regaining the ground which has
been lost; still less of occupying a new field of
knowledge or
investigation.
The organ of mind possesses individual peculia-
rities; these are in some instances hereditary, and
handed down from parent to child; in others,
they are dependent upon causes with which we are
not acquainted; and, moreover, they will be modi-
fied or changed by any cause which modifies or
changes the brain. And since the organ itself de-
pends for its nutrition upon the general nourish-
ment of the body ; and as that nourishment, when
prepared by a
process of secretion, will partake of
the qualities of the secreting viscus, and of that
nervous
system, without whose aid, no secretion
will take place, so there can be no
question, but

36 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
that the cerebral manifestation will, to a certain ex-
tent, partake of the impressions thus received, from
the character of the nourishment, during the first
years of infantile existence.
From what has been just written, it will follow,
that in order to any plans of education being suc-
cessful, they must be adapted to the individual dif-
ferences of the organ upon which they are to be
impressed; and the exponent of these peculiarities
is to be sought, not in any arbitrary laws of phy-
siognomy or
phrenology; not in any empirical
gauge of intellect; but by the slow process of
watching the manifestations of mind, and of ascer-
taining their extent and power. The facial angle
of Camper, the occipital angle of Daubenton, the
physiognomy of Lavater, the phrenology of Gall
and Spurzheim, Vimont, Leuret, &c., will con-
duct their respective votaries to folly, error, and
delusion, but will never tend of themselves to any
generally beneficial result.
It is time that these puerilities were abandoned,
and that they should give place to the rational
study of character, as exhibited in the mental at-
tributes. We are
fully disposed to allow that the
muscles of expression of the countenance will
be strongly marked by the prevailing emotions:
but even here, there will be found many a source of
fallacy; and besides, after all, it is passion rather
than intellect, which is thus manifested, so that
although the indications of the countenance are not
to be rejected, yet they will be of real value, only as
beacons to guide further inquiries, and point out

certain dangers to be avoided ; not as
affording data
sufficient for inferential reasoning, much less for
the establishment of conduct.
But if this be the case with that mode of exhibit-
ing mind which Heaven in its wisdom has clearly
appointed, what shall we
say of that organic
hypothesis which it has as
carefully concealed,
which is unnecessary to any known valuable practi-
cal result, which is absurd in some of its details,
and which may be injurious in its application ? We
have been nauseated, satis supergue, with the
gaspings of this miscalled science; and we could
wish for no better argument against its utility, than
we met with some
years since, in a
provincial
magazine, while waiting the arrival of the mail, in
one of our most ancient cities; in which it was
propounded that the skull of a recent murderer had
been submitted to examination, and so, forsooth,
his jealousy, which had originated the murder, was
dependent upon a
huge organ of amativeness; he
committed the crime for which he suffered, because
the organ of destructiveness was
large; and he did
so at an
early hour in the evening, and at no
great
distance from a
cottage, because his organ of' cautious-
ness was small. True, indeed, that his organ of
veneration was
large, and we
might have imagined
that this should have controlled the influence of
destructiveness: but phrenology is never at a loss:
this organ had not been cultivated; for if it had,
this individual might have been saved from crime,
and so it appeared from his history, that he did not
go to church; as if t)f{organ of destructiveness

had been more cultivated by murders, than the
organ of veneration by acts ff devotion. It is pity
that the number of murders he had committed, and
the number of times he had gone to church, had
not been placed in tabular opposition, that we
might have formed a fair judgment how far culti-
vation was a cause of the luxuriant growth of either
of the prominent, and apparently opposite organs.
From such absurdities, when so held, leading to
worse results, and terminating in the gloomiest forms
of materialism, and in the subversion of moral obli-
gation,--good Lord deliver us ! We refer to a sub-
sequent page for the more serious discussion of this
question.
Most happily we are not generally left to such a
cheerless system, for the results of religious inilu-
ence. We trust the time is yet far distant, when
we are to be dependent upon an
organ of venera-
tion for the morality and good feelings of our
neighbourhood and country; and we
hope that the
diffusion of a rational and scriptural system of
Christianity will speedily put an end to these hope-
less opinions; that it will secure the prejudices of
the young in favour of religion ; that it will infuse
into their minds principles of practical application,
and lead to a correct government of the conduct;
and that it will dissipate the illusions of enthusiasm,
and place the devotional feelings under the control
of sound judgment, rather than under the influ-
ence of excited sensibility.
lt is not enough that the intellect be developed,
and the literary character be fully formed ; the

foundation, indeed, has been very properly laid,
but principles of conduct must be supplied, and
motives for action must be given, and a
powerful
and adequate sanction must be sought. The
young must not be left to discover these principles,
these motives, and this sanction intuitively ; or
they will become victims to the first designing
demagogue who will craftily tell them that reli-
gion consists in a certain exercise of the imagina-
tion, and in the belief of a certain scheme of
doctrines; that it has no real, practical bearing,
but consists in feelings and emotions; or that it
is limited to a certain imperfect obedience to
truth; or, finally, that there is no such thing as
real religion at all I The young must be impressed
with a sense of their moral accountability, which
will involve the idea of their being responsible for
conduct here; and will naturally lead to defined
views of moral obligation,-these being always
referred for their origin, as well as for their court
of appeal, to the divine precepts ofthe Bible.
By the influence of these principles the natural
temper and disposition will be controlled and di-
rected. We have elsewhere defined temper to be
the expression of that agency which is excited by
the physical temperament upon the intellectual
manifestations; while diwosition forms the sum and
general result of those mental attributes which are
constituted by the intellectual faculties and tlw
passzkms.
Here again, we must ask, what it is which con-
stitutes the aptitude for the exhibition of particular

disposition? This manifestly consists in those or-
ganic peculiarities, which are the gifts of nature,
and which require to be sedulously watched-to be
fostered on the one hand, or
placed under the
dominion of counteracting principle on the other;
for it must never be forgotten that this original
tendency will be developed by early culture ;-that
it may be strengthened by education-heightened
by indulgence-augmented by long-continued habit
-and indefinitely applied, through the influence
of youthful prejudice.
Hence, the very great importance of giving a
correct bias to the first manifestations of conduct ;
hence the necessity for placing education under the
government of reason and principle;-hence the
duty of directing and setting bounds to the indul-
gence of any particular feeling or emotion ;-hence
the rigid scrutiny which must be kept upon every
occasion for sustained action;-and hence the
infinite importance of securing early prejudice on
the side of reason, religion, and virtue.
In a
well-regulated mind these will always go hand
in hand ; for there are no
greater mysteries in re-
ligion, than in every department of nature's extended
domain-even in that with which we ourselves are
closely surrounded. All its requirements are most
rational, and calculated to develope the powers of
intelligence; and when the one has been received
by the other, witl1 a heart desirous of doing the
will and obeying the laws of the moral Governor
of the universe, the fruits of virtue must be the
consequence. The seeds of piety placed in the

bosom of rational man, when assisted by the care-
ful cultivation of education, and watered by the
dews of heaven, must vegetate-must progress
towards maturity-must produce the buds and
blossoms of early rectitude of principle-and must
be followed by the flowers of social and relative
goodness, as well as
by the fruits of practical
benevolence, till having been ripened by time, the
harvest has come, and the shock of well-loaded
corn has been reaped, and gathered into the garner
of the lord of the harvest.
But we
may not expect to reap the harvest,
unless we
prepare the soil, and secure it from the
encroachment of enemies;-unless we
encourage
the growth of virtuous principles, and cultivate the
better feelings of our nature, while we
carefully
repress and eradicate those vices and passions
which are
always of rapid growth, and which
would, if possible, overwhelm all that is valuable
in man, and leave him the debased slave of his
organisation and appetites.
Perhaps we
ought not to quit this part of our
subject without one word on the question of
genius, that much-disputed and ill-understood
phenomenon, the existence of which is denied by
some, and to which a most undue importance is
attached by others. The preceding observations
will have already indicated our view of this sub-
ject. We think the term genius admits of an
easy explanation by viewing it, as consisting in a
peculiar aptitude for the reception of particular
ideas ;-a quickness of perception as applied to

CHAPTER III.
ON PIIRENOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH THE
GENERAL SUBJECT.
IN a former page we have glanced at the subject
of phrenology, or the science of discovering and
apportioning to multifold organs the several mani-
festations of mind; but it is a
question too in-
timately connected with our
present purpose, not
to require more serious discussion, and a
greater
degree of calm investigation.
We do not consider it as a
question of great
practical importance, in a work professing to trace
the influence of the manifesting organ upon the
manifestations of mind, whether the actual work
is accomplished by a
single organ capable of per-
forming a
variety of functions, or by an
assemblage
of organs combined and united by one homoge-
neous tissue, with a
degree of intimacy which
defies division, and with such inter-connexion, that
each separate organ is cognisant of the operations
of the whole,-provided that whole be held respon-
sible for the actions of each individual part, as well

44 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
as of that union, and concentration of actions, which
constitute the entire man.
In this case, whether single or
multiple, the
organization is held in subjection to the presiding
mind; the animal is preserved in subordination to
the spiritual being; the former is the servant of
the latter; and the spiritual being is held respon-
sible for all the actions and promptings of the
lower propensities; and thus the question resolves
itselfinto one of pure science.
Still, as a
question of science, without any visible
practical bearing, it is one of considerable import-
ance, because in itself truth is invaluable, and is
therefore worthy to be ascertained at some con-
siderable trouble: knowledge is power; and the
certainty that the scientific views from which our
practical deductions flow are correct, gives a con-
fidence to our belief, and the consequent setting
forth of our principles, which cannot fail to impress
character upon action. Besides, it so
generally
happens, that a more intimate acquaintance with
the composition of bodies, which before we have
been accustomed to view as
simple and elemen-
tary, brings to light qualities, and relationships,
and affinities, and aptitudes, of which we were
previously ignorant ;-and which now shed a new
light upon various facts, and circumstances, and
actions ;-and do actually confer a
greater power
to think correctly, and to act benevolently.
Hence this question may assume an
importance
which we do not at lirst sight perceive. We are
quite certain, with regard to many physical bodies

formerly deemed simple and elementary, which
the progress of science has since shown to be com-
pounded, that almost in every instance the dis-
covery of their composition has been followed, in
nurnberless ways, by new
practical applications of
things, previously limited within a certain given
circle, and by some new
blessings to mankind~
And, indeed, in the present instance, it were
possible to discover, from the external configuration,
the several aptitudes for mental manifestation;
and by it to ascertain more than careful observation
upon such early Luddings of mental manifestation,
assisted by physiognomy, could give; it were
possible thus to ascertain the propensities, and thus
to educate certain organs, and to repress certain
others,--to stimulate the one, and soothe the
other,-to foster the growth of one set of manifes-
tations, and stunt the progress of another, it is very
certain that a
great point would have been gained
towards the happiness and well-being of a
spiritual
creature, destined for immortality, and placed here
in a
probationary state of existence.
The question is therefore one which requires to
be considered with sobriety and judgment; and
we would be most anxious to separate the errors
and follies of the votaries of phrenology, and even
the occasional absurdity of its details, as enforced
by such votaries from the doctrine itself. In the
following observations, it is truth which we would
seek, and not the establishment of our own
opinion ! and we trust that, whether we are
right
or
wrong now, _the truth will ultimately prevail.

46 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
It is true, that in the circle of our own observa-
tion we have met with some
startling facts in
favour of the doctrine; and it is equally true that
we have met with other facts of a
precisely oppo-
'site nature, and with instances of the most signal
failure, even in Dr. Spurzheim himself. It is also
true that one failure will invalidate a
great number
of successful results, because, if the doctrine be not
generally applicable to the great mass of mankind,
it is, in fact, inapplicable. But in all fairness, we
would give phrenologists the benefit of two circum-
stances; first, the want of perfection in a doctrine
comparatively novel, and dependent, essentially
dependent for support, upon a
great variety cf ob-
servations: and, secondly, we would not charge
upon the doctrine, the ignorance, the want of skill,
the hasty judgment, the precipitate conclusions,
and the wretched credulity of many of its pro-
fessors.
But we would ask, in return for this courtesy,
less arrogant assumption on the part of phreno-
logists; a
greater degree of modesty and difiidence
in drawing their conclusions ; and a
larger amount
of toleration towards the prejudices,-it may be
the stupid, but the well-intentioned prejudices of
their adversaries. It always argues badly for a
cause, when it is supported by vehement assertion ;
by irritable impatience of contradiction; by over-
weening confidence of being right ; and by a want
of forbearance towards those, who may not be so
quick-sighted as themselves, and who, from their
attachment to earlier notions, may not be able

readily to supersede the influence of pristine habits
of thought and modes of feeling; nay, perhaps too,
of some
peculiarity of physical temperament, if not
ofplzrenological organization Use#
There is another important ground for this dis-
cussion, and that is, the bearing which it has upon
moral accountability. If the doctrine be held as
we have stated it, it is evident, that the question of
unity or
plurality of organ is unimportant, and that
each must be equally tried on its own merits, in
reference to the influence of cerebral peculiarity
upon the manifestation of mind ; while each is
equally allied to, or
equi-distant from, the doc-
trines of materialism,-a question which will come
under our notice in a future chapter.
But it cannot be denied, that the natural ten-
dency of phrenology, on minds not instructed to
the contrary, is, that man is the creature of his
organization ; that he is what heis, because he can-
not help it, and because of the predominance of
certain organs ; and that responsible at all for his
errors, they should be looked upon with a
very
venial eye, where the temptation on one side was
so
strong, and the power of opposition on the other
was so weak; nor can it still further be denied,
that such consequences have been held by some of
its professors.
The practical application (mis-application, if you
please) of this doctrine has been lately shown in
the horrible tenets of socialism. These pages may
not be sullied by a transcription of its blasphemies
and impurities ; certain it is_ that the doctrines and

48 THE RECIPROCAL IN FLUENCE
practice of socialism strike at the very framework
of society,-that they uproot every social and
domestic tie-that they destroy all moral account-
ability-that they overturn the most dearly-che-
rished institutions of' religion and virtue-that
they proclaim the omnipotence of inclination, and
declare that man is responsible only to himself-
that his first duty is to obey the promptings of his
organization,-to listen to the voice of passion, and
to gratify such passion at any cost, reckless of
consequences, unmindful of law, human or divine,
and careless of futurity. Certain it is, also,
that the doctrines of phrenology are
appealed
to in evidence of the truth of these abominable
conclusions.
It is indeed allowed, that every good is liable to
abuse; and we would not argue against the useful
application of a doctrine from its abuse, in the
hands of wicked men ; and it has been said, that if
phrenology be true, it is impossible that it can lead
to anything bad, as materialism, fatalism, irreligion,
Sac. And this is true, and might be employed in
argument, if the doctrines of phrenology had been
thoroughly proven, and rested on
irrefragable
grounds. But, pendente lite, it is not fair to employ
this as an
argument, because it is assuming' the point
in dispute as settled beyond the possibility of ques-
tion. And when any new doctrine is propounded,
which confessedly must exert a considerable inlin-
ence on society, it is not unfair-on the contrary,
it is the part ofa wise, and prudent, and cautious,
and scientific philosopher, to ask himself,

are these speculations leading me? Arc they con-
ducting to good or evil? Is their influence pro-
pitious to virtue, and the general good of mankind,
or the contrary ? Do they support, or do they con-
travene, the great truths of revealed religion and
moral action, or do they not? Because if they do
not
support what is so
indispensable to man's hap-
piness and welfare, they cANNo'r BE TRUE! So we
see, that the argument in favour of phrenology
drawn from its truth, before that truth has been
demonstrated, is overwhelmed by the converse
pro-
position, that if the doctrine lead to practical error,
it cannot be speculaticely true ; and it is wise and
prudent to be satisfied on this head.
Nor indeed do we quite see how such conclusions
are avoidable, if the manifestations of mind are
traced upwards from the lowest and most imperfect,
to the highest and most perfect developement of the
nervous
system ; except by supposing, for man, the
supcraddition of an immortal spiritual principle,
which is certainly not generally admitted by phre-
nologists. If the mind of man, and the mind of
the horse or the dog, be of the same order, only
that one has a
larger brain and a
greater number of
organs
*
than the other, the responsibilities of each
would be the same, according to their relative op-
portunities of cerebral action. Now, no one would

It would perhaps be diflicult to calculate what size of brain
man should possess, and what should be the number ofhis organs
in proportion to his sphere, when we find, in a recent phrenolo-
gical work of high character, twenty-eight organs in the skull
ofa goose, ten of which are in the forehead.

be so absurd, as to make the horse or the dog re-
sponsible for their actions as moral accountable
creatures ; but if not, there is no reason, according
to phrenologists, why man should be held respon-
sible for his actions. And if man ceases to be re-
sponsible for his conduct, there is an end of the
social compact ; while the hopes of an hereafter are
upon a level with the prospect of to-morrow's
joys.
The positive establishment of this view, by any
phrenologist, and the natural, unsophisticated, or,
perhaps rather, the unguarded tendency of the doc-
trine being in this direction, it does become, not
only important but indispensable, that we should
view it in its practical bearing. We give to its
professors the full meed of industry ; we allow that
they have added many facts to our anatomical
knowledge; we believe in their sincerity and in-
tegrity, so far as
they think they are
promoting the
interests of science: but if we believe that they
have reasoned incorrectly, we trust that we shall
be listened to with indulgence, while we endeavour
to point out that fallacy.
It has been alleged against phrenologists, that
they make the size of the organ the measure
ty' its
_functional power. This, however, is so
certainly
untenable, that it has been qualified by the modi-
fying explanation, that it is so
"
cceteris paribus."
Now, at first sight, this seems to get rid of the dif-
ficulty, for it is to be acknowledged, that where
nature has sought to accomplish any single great
object, it is to be eifectcd by a

organ. But it is also true, that where greut power
andfacility of action are to be obtained at the same
time, it is generally secured by a number of minute
organs, whose united sum of function makes up the
amount required; and therefore, to those who
doubt the organic divisibility of the brain, it is
unconvincing to descant on
supposed analogies,
which to them do not appear analogous, and which
do not, consequently, seem to possess even the weak
support to the doctrine, which analogy at its very
best would confer.
Still further, with regard to size, being cceteris
paribus the measure of functional power, perhaps
we
might not object to this position: but if it
be true, of what avail is phrenology? Because, if
a small organ of a
superior quality can
give result-
ing power far greater than a
large organ of in-
ferior quality, of what avail is the test of organic
developement? Now, this we most confidently be-
lieve, that there shall be two precisely similar
external configurations; yet, that the two brains
shall possess tissues so dissimilar, as
greatly to
modify the mental manifestations. We find these
differences perpetually in nature ; as, for instance,
in the countenance of the sheep-in the human
voice, or the handwriting of the same classes in
society : the organs of speech, and the human hand,
are constituted with reference to a
great degree of
exactitude, yet nothing can be more dissimilar
than the expression of the resulting function. And,
again, everybody knows that it is not the largest

But with regard particularly to this "locus
stantis vel cadentis argumenti," set up by the
two little terms,-though confessedly of extensive
signification,-" cceterisparibusf' what, may we ask,
is to be the standard of comparison by which we
may judge of what size should be the organic deve-
lopement in brains which possess a certain amount of
energy of function, independent of such develope-
ment? Who first is to decide as to the general
amount of intellectual calibre, and to what test is it
to be referred, if the organic test, which has been
shown insufficient for the purpose, is to be given
up? Is the measure of function, in relation to its
organic developement, to be referred to some
general
standard, chosen from a great variety of experi-
ments on the same
class of society? Or, is the
relative size to be determined in every instance by
a reference to the other developements in the same
individual, and to the amount of their employment 'Z
If so, who is to be the judge? Who shall deter-
mine either the general or the local energy of func-

tionably is, the science of phrenology is useless,
because, after all, to determine the value of organic
developement, it is necessary to be acquainted with
the previous history of the individual, in order to
ascertain what are _the ccetera pares. In fact, the

By the term mind, as it is to be now employed, we
intend a certain assemblage of phenomena, pos-
sessed in a
greater or less degree by the lower
animals in common with man, and which result
from the employment of the brain.
These phenomena do not originate from mecha-
nical agency. Mere machinery can
perform only
definite movements, which may be calculated upon
under all circumstances, so
long as the machine
continues in action, and is unbroken. The products
of animal mind, on the contrary, cannot be calcu-
lated upon, and manifestly differ very materially in
individuals of the same
species.
"le perceive in animals the possession of certain
operations inconsistent with the idea of unvarying
action as resulting from machinery. We discover,
indeed, the exercise of certain faculties, which go
on independently of themselves, or of their will,
viz. the functions of organic life ; but we perceive,
also, another set of functions, by which animals
deliberate, remember, will, choose, love, hate, Sac.,
and these are the operations of mind.
In every instance we shall find, that mind is
suited to the wants and habits of the animal; and
that it possesses precisely that degree of developement,
which is necessary to fit it for its position in creation,

54 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
to preserve it from its enemies, and to enable it to
do precisely what is required of it, in order to
accomplish certain ends, which form a
part of the
grand scheme of the government of the universe;
and this is demonstrated from the lowest created
being, up to spiritual man, destined for immor-
tality.
The carrying out of this principle will lead to a
solution of the problem, why man has so much
larger an amount of mind than other animals,
even to enable him to fulfil the intentions of his
Creator; an amount of mind which would be quite
unnecessary, if the present scene of his labouns
terminated his existence; and if he were not des-
tined to live eternally in that spiritual principle,
which has been superadded to his animal mind ; and
thus man has precisely that degree of developement
of brain and mind, which is necessary for his posi-
tion in creation; and which he requires for the
fulfilment of his duties in society, and his prepara-
tion for immortality.
To return to the mind of animals : we notice the
exhibition of mental phenomena; and as these
must have had_ an
origin, a
moving power, we
reason backward to the existence of animal mind, in
a
degree and proportion according to the organisa-
tion ofthe animal, which again is admirably suited
to the fulfilment of designs apportioned by the
Great Governor of the universe.
Mind, therefore, is understood to be a mono-
syllabiccxpression of phenomena, which result from
the employment of the brain. In this case, brain

OF BODY AND MIND. 55
is not mind, any more than digestion is stomach;
MIND is the resulting function, and not synonymous
with the material substance from which it emanates.
This function is not dependent for its integrity or
extent upon the absolute size of the organ; as, for
instance, in the amount of mind exhibited by the
bee, the ant, the wasp, and other insects, which is
far greater than is shown by many other animals
occupying, apparently, a more important position
with regard to the size of their nervous
system.
It must be remembered, that if this be true, as
to the phenomena resulting from what phrenologists
would call an
assemblage of organs ; so must it be
equally true with regard to each organ from the
union of which that assemblage is composed; and,
therefore, the activity of function displayed by any
ONE ORGAN, Has N0 1>os1T1vE RELATION 'ro ITS

The important question of instinct naturally pre-
sents itself, at the outset of an
inquiry of this kind ;
and especially in relation to the remarkable fact,
that man has very few instincts as
compared with
other animals abstractedly ; and infinitely fewer, as
compared with his importance in the scale of being.
The reason is obviously that which we have
before given, viz., that the mind is suited to the
exigencies ofthe animal ; instinct being, in a word,
that knowledge which has been imparted to the
animal, prior to education, and which, without
thought, fits it immediately for its peculiar posi-
tion in the world. But when there is much reason,

more
especially when conduct is to be based on
moral motive, there will be less room for instinct.
_
Instincts are oftentimes independent of any pecu-
liar organisation of the brain, and arising out of the
organisation of the animal generally. In the brain,
however, will be always found a
peculiar adaptation
to that instinct or imparted knowledge, which fits it
for its position in animated nature. This is seen in
the familiar instance of the fondness of the duck-
ling for water, an instinct precisely suited to the
organisation of its foot.
But if instincts exist, under some circumstances,
for which there is no
peculiar cerebral structure,
it will follow, that even in the lower animals there
is a
principle superadded to brain, which prepares
it for the original design of the Creator. And if
so, there is nothing unreasonable in the position,
that in man, the highest order of created intel-
ligence, a more
important, immaterial, and im-
mortal principle has been superadded to his orga-
nisation, existing independently of that organisa-
tion, except as the medium for its manifestations;
and suitable to its continued existence, after the death
of this temporary building! This principle gives
laws to his organisation, so that he differs from the
lower animals, not only in the number and degree
of his moral feelings and intellectual powers, which
he possesses in common with them, and in the
smaller amount of instinct or
imparted knowledge
which has been given him; but in the superior
power of the will, that will being at the same time
placed under the guidance of higher reasoning

faculties, and of greater knowledge-with religious
sanctions precisely in accordance with the revela-
tion of his future destinies. The analogy of nature
in every department generally indicates original
tendencies undefinable and imperceptible, except
by their resulting efects, and to manifest these ten~
dencies, appropriate organisations are bestowed
upon different individuals; phrenologists, on the
contrary, confound the cause and the effect.
The free will of animals seems' to
occupy a
very
limited range; and, upon reflection, it will at once
be perceived, that so it should be, in conformity
with their organisation-their wants-their desires
-the position they have to fill-the duties they
have to perform-and their individual responsi-
bilities. 1
The free will of man, on the contrary, appears to
himself to be absolute ; the conviction of liberty of
conduct on his part is perfect; and as he is con-
stituted by nature, it is clear that it should be so,
in order to secure his responsibility; and that
without this power of selection, and of determining
his own choice, he would possess no
prospect of
happiness.
In every instance free will is bounded by /mow-
ledge imparted or
acquired, and by implanted desires.
Little knowledge has been imparted to the lower
animals, constituting instinct, therefore freedom of
will is limited: much has been given to man,
therefore his freedom of will is apparently absolute.
This view will account for many disputes on the
subject of free will, and for many seeming discre-

58 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
pancies of conduct in man, and for his not choosing
good in preference to evil. It is, that his nature
has been subjected to some debasing change, which
has limited his will to choose good, or has rather
given him a
propensity to choose evil ; and that there
is a
great absence of the desire to do good. Thus,
man
by nature is a free agent ; but the propensity
to choose evil has taken away from the perfection
of this power; and he is now
dependent, for the
just exercise of this property, upon a new desire
implanted by the Holy Spirit of God, from whom
"
all just works do come." Thus he is free to choose
evil or
good; he is prone to the former from his
corrupted nature; he can
only be equal to the
latter, through the desire implanted by Divine
Grace.
`
Much apprehension has been entertained by
many well-meaning persons on the subject of allow-
ing to animals any other mind than that of instinct
alone, from a
trembling anxiety, lest the mind of
man, and of animals, should be held to approximate
so
closely, as almost to amalgamate, or at least to
originate from the same source ; thus depriving man
of moral accountability for his actions, and causing
them to originate in mere structure. _
But this is a
groundless fear, and productive of
much error; it is groundless, because, in truth, the
mental manifestations of both man and animals are ex-
hibited through the same
organ; and, to a certain ex-
tent, partake of the same nature; but are
precisely
suited to the situation and destination of each ; the
latter (animal mind) being exactly adapted to the

several peculiarities of his station in animated ex-
istence ; and the former to his intellectual and
social nature-to his accountability for his actions-
to his moral and religious character-to his posses-
sion of a new
principle, a
spiritual and immortal
soul-and to the future destiny of that soul in a
state of rewards and punishments.
It is possible that St. Paul, when he makes the
distinction between "
body, soul, and spirit," really
contemplated the entire truth, and spoke of an, as
possessing a
body, and a soul, or mind, in c mmon
with the other higher animals, adapted to`.their
several designed mental manifestations; but that
man
(the highest animal) obtained also a
super-
added principle, here called spirit, for the purpose
of showing forth those moral, spiritual, religious
phenomena, which arise, or should have arisen,
from the original design of the Creator. In this
case, there may be more or less of mental manifes-
tation in the other animals, according to the pecu-
liar grade of each; but there is no moral or
spiri-
tual manifestation, except where man shows the in-
fluence of his superadded principle or
spirit.
A contrary position is also productive of error,
because it asks too much ; and because the facts of
the case are so
directly opposed to the proposition,
as to throw discredit even
upon truth, by endea-
vouring to encumber it with that which is not
true ; and this gives the "vantage ground
"
to scep-
ticism and infidelity.
Now the simple truth is, that animals not only
perceive by the senses, and that this perception acts

60 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
upon the stores of instinct, or imparted knowledge,
suitable to their varying wants ; but, also, that they
possess a different degree of intelligence, and that they
exercise such an amount of reasoning upon it, as to
render their instinctive knowledge applicable under
changing circumstances. It is also clear, that
animals observe minutely, while it is manifest that
this faculty of observation would be comparatively
useless without the memory ofrecorded associations ;
and it is a fact, that their recollection is of the most
vivid character, being, however, the result of ex-
ternal circumstances exclusively. There are few
persons who have not experienced the advantage
and disadvantage of these mental properties in the
horse; the former as
committing themselves con-
fidingly to the safe conduct of their animal under dif-
ferent trying circumstances, when they themselves
were no
longer able to direct his movements; and
the latter, if they had unguardedly whipped their
steed, for starting at some fearful object, and found,
for a
long time afterwards, that he would start ten-
fold at the same
object, from the first impression of
fear being associated with, and multiplied by the
recollection of his chastisement, and by the reflec-
tion of increased terror arising out of this com-

But if animals observe well, remember accurately,
reason upon their self-recorded observations, and
act upon the results, surely we have here a number
of mental phenomena, as
thought, and reflection,
comparison, selection, combination, inference,
choice, or will ; and all these we find exercised in

numberless instances. Their foresight of weather,
and their defence of themselves from its approach-
ing severity ; and their skill and ingenuity shown
in the infinite variety of arrangement for their
nests, the construction of their habitations, and
other preparations for the care of their young; the
choice of situation for these several purposes, and
the varied methods for the protection of their olf-
spring from enemies, are all proofs of contrivauce,
and of reasoning, which cannot be gainsayed nor
disproved.
But if so, we arrive at the conclusion, that the
same
leading principles are found in the mental
manifestations of either, only adapted to their pecu-
liar structure, and for the purpose of gaining cer-
tain definite ends ; these ends being always suited to
the different purposes of their being, and having
always' reference to the termination of that being,
final in the ordinary animal, and therefore irrespec-
tive of conduct; not terminal in man, because his
is a
higher destiny-his a
higher position on earth ;
and because he is especially created to show forth
the attributes of God as
they are revealed to us,
while the animal of a lower grade only illustrates
his Creator, as
respects natural religion.
One other observation only on this subject, viz.
on the susceptibility of animals to education. The
greater part of their knowledge is instinctive, or
imparted, yet they can, and when domesticated
they must, be educated. We do not speak of
learned pigs, &c.; but of education, in their own
relative position, as it is very clearly set forth in the

history of the horse, or the dog, &c. For instance,
each requires to be broke or educated, in order to
render his instinctive knowledge and natural
powers available for the purposes of man.
Before continuing our researches on the phreno-
logical question, we remark, that it must be ad-
mitted by all, that the texture, and composition,
and function of nerves, are really unknown to us,
and therefore we
possess no means of judging of
their organic distinctions or
peculiarities. We
cannot, in this way at least, undertake to say, that
there is a difference between one
portion of the
same substance of the brain, and another portion,
so as to establish a
cognizable distinction. We do
not
rely upon this argument, because we cannot
trace the reason
why any one
portion, or the whole
of the nervous
system performs its function: and
we mention it only as a
negative fact, that phreno-
logists, though they refer to external prominences,
as resulting from corresponding organic develope-
ment, yet do not attempt to show, upon the disen-
cased brain, where one
organ begins, or another
terminates,-nor, indeed, to localize the organs at
all; much less to inform us how to distinguish an
organ of great power and activity from one of less
power and action, the degree rf magnitude being the
same in both cases.
'
All we
really know upon this subject is, that there
is a certain degree of uniformity of structure, in the
nervous system, from the lowest to the highest
order of animated existence, and that in the verte-
bratcd animals, this consists of a brain and spinal

marrow; the former more
particularly devoted to
the senses and intellectual phenomena; the latter
being especially employed for locomotive and
organic life. '
This system is gradually perfecting up to the
highest order of created intelligence-man: but
between him and the most intelligent of the inferior
animals, there is a
grand hiatus, which does not
admit of gradation ; a
step which shows that man is
not only the perfection of an oran
outang, but that
he is altogether a different being; that is to say,
that he has become a
spiritual creature, that upon
him has been lavished a new creation, suited to his
destiny and necessary to his moral responsible exist-
ence, viz. a
spiritual and immortal soul.
One word on the subject of the idiot; and under
this term I propose comprehending those who are
very deficient in intellect, as well as those who are
absolutely incapable of knowing right from wrong.
In this class of unfortunate beings, there are some
whose organisation is so defective, that from their
birth it has been suspected they would grow up
incapable of taking care of themselves; there are
others who originally exhibited an
ordinary degree
of mental developement, but in whom its traces have
been obliterated by an attack oi; convulsions, or
some such fearful bodily ailment; there are others,
who have experienced some violent mental emotion,
and in whom all trace of intelligence has been
swept away by one desolating storm; and there
are those, in whom no defective organisation has

been noticed, but with whom the power of employ-
ing the brain has seemed never to exist, the
essential connecting link between body and mind
having been wanting; so that there have been no
mental manifestations, yet no
apparent ground for
their absence.
On the contrary, in some rare instances, an acci-
dent, a blow, a fall, some acute malady, some
overwhelming emotion, has given such a stimulus
to the cerebral fibre, that mental energy has taken
the place of imbecility, and the fool has been
reinstated in all the powers and privileges of the
man.
It is obvious, that these circumstances, which are
abundantly explained by considering the brain as
the single organ of mind, are not to be accounted
for thus easily by the supposition of its plurality;
because, in that case, the want of developement
within, or the destroying impression from without,
should have been exhibited on
particular organs
only ; and, above all, the existence of organic de-
velopement without a
corresponding display of func-
tion, is so fatal to the hypotheses of phrenology, that
the occurrence of such instances has been attempted
to be denied: still that they do occur, is borne
out by the recorded experience of our lunatic
asylums.
There is also great difference in the capacity of
diH`erent brains for carrying on the mental pro-
cesses; we are accustomed to say, and very justly,
that their minds are of a different calibre, although

there shall seem to be the same
degree of organic
developement. The brain shall appear to be the
same; yet one has the power of a
giant, the other
of a
pigmy. Hence we infer,
First, that though the brain be the organ of
thought, yet the generation of thought, the nature
and quality of thought, and the aptitude for its em-
ployment, are not dependent upon the quantum Q'
brain, not upon any demonstrable property of the
nervous libre.
Secondly, neither is the reach of mental mani-
festation dependent upon the perfection of the
senses; for although these form the inlet for a
great variety of ideas, yet it will often be found, that
the power of abstraction and combi_nation of thought
generally, is greatest in those whose senses are
not eminently developed; and, on the contrary,
there will often be the least mental developement,
where there is the greatest power and acuteness of
the senses, as is manifestly the case with the Indian
tribes.
Thirdly, great bodily and great mental power
are
rarely met with in the same individual, and it
commonly happens, that where there is much in-
tellectual activity, there is a feebleness of vital
power about the brain, which confirms the position
that the capacity for thought is dependent rather
upon some unknown peculiarity of the cerebral fibre,
than upon its quantity, or
cognizable structure. It
is supposed that a
tendency towards water on the
brain is accompanied usually by a
premature deve-

66 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
lopement of thought and feeling. But this is not
true ; it is the too great action of thought and feel-
ing wich overturns the balance of health, and pro-
duces or rather calls upon the brain for so much
vascular action to support it, that the organ receives
more blood than it knows how to dispose of; the
balance ofthe circulation is overturned, irritation is
set up, and effusion takes place by a sort of natural
effort to relieve the vascular tension.
A question will very properly present itself here,
as to the mode by which this variation of mental
calibre is to be accounted for. It is obvious, that
many striking talents will depend upon some
pecu-
liarity in the organs of sense; but the marked
quickness of association in one; the depth of rea-
soning in another; the strength of judgment in a
third; the power of comprehension in a fourth;
the capacity for minute and accurate details in a
fifth; the habits of observation and reflection in a
sixth; and the power of combination in a seventh ;
though they may be iniluenced by the quantum of
blood received and distributed under given circum-
stances, are
really explicable only on the supposition
of the existence of some
peculiarity in the cerebral
fibre.
We also notice here, that there are
many im-
portant functions of the brain, to which no
organ has been allotted; as, for instance, con-
sciousness, perception, reason, &c. And it is clear
that no organ will be charged with these important
functions, because they do not chance to be distri-

butable, yet there can be no
good reason
why a
separate organ should not be allowed them, as
well as to hope, fear, benevolence, and religion.
If a
contrary process were
adopted by phreno-
logists, it would bejfatal to their doctrines; for then
not only would each prominence be the centre of
one peculiar faculty, but there would be certain
projections which must constitute so
many centres
of individual existence; and life would be spent,
identity would be lost, and all that is valuable
would be merged, in the conflict _for power, between
these several existences.
It is not to be believed, that there can be separate
organic fibres for the production of benevolence,
hope, fear, joy, and sorrow-sense of duty to God,
Sac.; these are all the result of spiritual actions,
which are hidden in the deep recesses of the indi-
vidual, and which are
manifested to us
through the
organ of mind, the servant of the spiritual principle,
modified indeed by the peculiarities of its structure,
and of various causes
operating upon it, but not
exhibited through one chosen spot.
It becomes us then to inquire into the influence
of this original constitution; and of various other
causes acting upon the brain.
No reasonable person can doubt, that there are
original diferences of mental constitution; and
these distinctions exist in different children of tl1e
same
parents; so that not only varieties, but
dissimilarities, and even antipodes, occur in the
same
family, and under the same
system of edu-
cation.

68 'rue nncirnocu. INFLUENCE
These distinctions exist anteriorly to mental cul-
ture ; they are to be noticed with the earliest dawn
of passion and emotion; the first scintillations of
intellect will denote the source whence they are
derived, and will exhibit peculiarities which subse-
quent education will not obliterate and scarcely
control, but which will tinge the character for
life. It is not always true, that "
fortes creantur
fortibus et bonis ;" but it is true, on the contrary,
that mental diferences in the offspring from their
parents do often exist, and are to be found under
very great apparent similarities of organisation.
We do not conceive that this fact can be accounted
for but by the supposition, that the Creator, the
Lord and Giver ofwlife, dispenses talent as it pleases
Him, and confers peculiarities which are not trace-
able to organisation, but the manifestation of which
may be influenced both by moral and physical
conditions. And we
perceive the design of these
peculiarities, in enabling each individual better to
fulfil the duties of that station in life, which has
been previously selected for him by an
unerring
Providence.
~
Granting this, it is equally true, that there exist
certain other differences of mental manifestation,
which are
dependent upon bodily organisation, which
are not produced by education or imitation, and
which are oftentimes handed down from parent to
child through many generations ; these peculiarities
are
very markedly apparent under the influence of
certain conditions of the brain; and their mani-
festation is greatly modified by these conditions.

or BODY AND MIND. 69
This manifestation will be modified by cerebral
developement, and especially by its age. In early
life, the manifestations of mind are few and feeble ;
bodily pleasure or
bodily uneasiness seems to be its
first expression, and is thus limited to the wants
and desires of the animal. The recognition of
those with whom it is associated, and from whom it
is receiving constant kindnesses, appears to be the
next link in the chain of developement; and, as
arising out of this, the emotion of gratitude and
affection. Afterwards" the growth of the affective
faculties, and of emotions and passions arising out
of selfishness, claim the precedence over
every other
principle, and for a
very long time give the tinge
of their predominance to mental manifestation.
The intellectual faculties are of far slower
growth, and require a
longer period, as well as the
graduated process of education, for their develope-
ment. These also are
tinged, in early life, by the
prevalence of passion; or
they are characterized
by imagination rather than by judgment, and are
marked by activity rather than by vigour. It
should seem that the brain was
naturally apt
enough for the reception or
expression of the sensi-
tive faculties; but that the manifestation of tl1e in-
tellectual powers and moral feelings was of a far
more diflicult order.
Now, while it is allowed that this latter expres-
sion is dependent upon the growth, maturity, or
decay of the cerebral organ, the inquiry as to the
cause of this difference is not without considerable
interest; since the one
appears so
easy, so natural;

70 THE nEc1PnocAL INFLUENCE
the other so diflicult, so laborious. The true solu-
tion of this problem is to be found in the fact, that
the one has regard to the mere animal, and is
therefore easy, while the other is dependent upon
the spiritual nature to which the brain is subser-
vient; but to w/zic/z,f1°om some
perverting cause, it
has ceased to be a
willing servant. It is obedient
to all the animal impulses; it is very loath to
yield
itself to the higher faculties of man's moral and
social relationship.
But we must carry our views a little further.
As age advances and maturity is established, the
brain has reached the maximum of its power;
reason is fully developed; intellect has acquired its
highest tone ; passion is subdued to the dominion
of moral virtue; judgment has obtained its ascen-
dancy; the full tide of' mental power has reached
its height; and the light of reason is in the zenith
of its strength. But this period passes away; by
slow, and generally imperceptible degrees, the brain
loses first, elasticity, then power; the lessened
buoyancy of mental operation first proclaims the
change which age is about to produce ; a few more
years, and power is perceptibly diminished ; energy
of purpose and of execution give way to
wayward-
ness and irritability; an
impatience of difference of
opinion is soon discernible; narrow and confined
views, tenaciously held, are
exchanged for the pre-
viously broad and ample basis of well-formed and
enlarged opinion ; sinister influence is more
easily
exerted; passion-the passion of old age-creeps
upon the individual; more and more
power and

energy are lost, till by degrees the manifestations
of the mind of man are darkened by the night, the
pitiable night, of second childhood.
There is a remarkable circumstance to be noticed
in the history of cerebral action, viz. the change of
opinion which we sometimes notice in a
very ex-
traordinary manner; not that change which is
effected by the slow agency of the causes to which
we have just adverted, but a
comparatively sudden
operation, occasioned sometimes by some
physical
cause influencing the brain, but much more fre-
quently by a cause
purely mental, acting either
through the judgment or the passions. And this
change is sometimes so marked and so sudden, as
to be quite incompatible with any corresponding
change in the fibres of the manifesting organ, and
is only to be accounted for by the supposition of
an altered action of the spiritual presiding prin-
ciple.
The change of which we
speak, is quite inde-
pendent of that gradual alteration which affects the
brain, as well as
every other organ, arising from the
decay and renovation of its particles, which may
operate the varieties in the habits of thought,
and modes of judgment and ,expression which we
have just before noticed; and which is perfectly
consistent with the continuance of personal identity,
and with the entire mental conviction of being the
same individual, and of a consciousness that the
change is one of manifestation, and of the manyfest-
ing organ, not of the thinking, presiding, governing
spiht.

72 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
There are some other physical causes operating
upon the brain, and its manifestations, which we
must just notice. One of these is temperature.
Every healthy person is conscious of being braced
up by moderate cold, and of being relaxed by heat.
Winter, therefore, is the time for study, provided
that the body be kept moderately warm. The
energy of the brain is increased by a certain degree
of cold, and diminished by either extreme. In too
great heat, the individual becomes oppressed,
languid, and irritable; and in too great cold, con-
gestion and inaptitude for mental exertion take
place ; the former state being probably dependent
upon the immediate impression of heat upon the
nervous fibre; the latter being produced through
the medium ofthe circulation.
Atmospherical pressure, too, has probably a double
agency; it is only under high pressure that cere-
bral phenomena go on, with the degree of elasticity
requisite to ensure comfort. There is probably also,
here, the double immediate agency upon the brain,
and the intermediate operation through the vascular
system. For as the venous circulation is dependent
ibr its continuance almost entirely on
atmospherical
pressure; so, if that pressure be diminished, the
circulation in the large sinuses of the brain will be
impeded to such an extent, that there will be great
inaptitude for mental exertion, and a consider-
able degree of general languor and prostration of
strength.
It would appear, then, that both these causes
operate upon the circulation ofthe blood, as well as

upon the nervous fibre. In all probability, mere
movement in the brain, occasioned by the arterial
action, has an
important agency in keeping that
organ in a
healthy condition. But this action may
be too great or too little; the blood may be pro-
pelled around its circle too rapidly, and then there
exists excitement and over action ; or it may be re-
turned from the brain too slowly, and then will be
found a
languor and feebleness of function, a
pros-
tration of cerebral energy, which is oftentimes very
distressing to the patient, because it so
generally
wears the appearance of a moral feebleness of will.
Over-action of the brain, and want of suflicient
rest, will produce irritability ; a real loss ofpower,
with a
great appearance of action; a state very
generally leading to disorder of the bodily functions,
and this, again, reacting injuriously upon the
brain.
Vhen, however, the blood is not propelled to the
brain with a sufficient degree of power, or when it
is sent up in too large quantities, or when it is too
slowly returned from the brain, there is an immediate
loss of balance in the circulating system ; the veins
become loaded --congested ; there is first heaviness,
then dulness, embarrassment; and, finally, if not
previously remedied, a cessation of action. And
this may exist in various degrees, so as in many
instances to escape detection, to be known only to
the sufferer, and by him to be reasoned upon in-
correctly, and attributed to anything but the right
cause. -

74 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
is nutrition ; like other organs, its fibres must be
renewed ; its perfect nourishment is essential to its
well-being. Unless it be adequately nourished, its
excitability, or power of receiving impressions, is
diminished, and its own interior actions are of a
feebler character.
A variety of stimuli act upon the brain, and act
differently upon the brain of diflerent persons, and
even of the same
person at different periods of life,
under changed circumstances with regard to general
health, action or inaction, freshness or exhaustion,
in different conditions of the stomach, and under
varying states of atmospherical electricity.
Once more, various morbid states of the physique
generally, operate principally upon the brain, and
its manifestations of mental agency : these act pri-
marily upon the organ itself, or
sympathetically
through the irritation of some distant viscus. There
may be a
suspension of action, as in fainting, or
morbid sleep; there may be excited action, as in
enthusiasm ; there may be too great and exclusive
attention to one
object; or there may be perversion
of action, as in all the changing forms of insanity,
from the first trace of eccentric movement to the
total extinction of the character of man.
Thus then we
perceive, that no sensitive, no affec-
tive emotion, no
operation of intellect, no conscious-
ness of being, in short, no manifestation of mind, can
take place without the intervention of the brain; and
we
perceive also, that this manifestation is modified
by varying conditions of that organ immediately;
and intermediately, by many states of health or dis-

ease of body, as well as
by different emotions, and
principles, and thought, and reasoning, and compa-
rison and judgment.
But although, in order to the production of
mental phenomena, there must be a certain condi-
tion of the brain and nervous
system, yet it would
be illogical and absurd, and contrary to fact,
to infer that the sentient principle resided in the
nerves, or in the part first receiving the impression.
The eye does not see, nor the ear hear, nor the
tongue taste; the impression is first made upon
their nerves; but the reception of that impression,
and its being brought round to the thinking prin-
ciple, is consciously, through an intermediate
agency, and by a direct reference from the perci-
pient organ, to the presiding mind : there appears,
then, to be no
necessary ground for the atomic divi-
sion of the brain into many little specialties ; and
therefore, before closing this chapter, we must just
notice a few of the arguments for and against the
doctrines of phrenology.
It has been said, that in order to produce various
effects, nature has varied the material organ ; and,
therefore, that it is reasonable to suppose she has
done so with regard to the brain. But the contrary
is the fact; and it would be just as reasonable to
suppose it necessary to have different eyes for the
reception of impressions given by different colours,
as to suppose it necessary to have different organs in
the brain, for the developement of ideas produced
by form and colour. As we have stated, the con-
trary is really the fact ; for the tongue is the organ

76 THE RECIPROC.-L INFLUENCE
of taste, as well as of every variety of language;
and the hand is not only the organ of touch, but
also of prehensiou, and indication, and expres-
sion, Sac.
Again, itis said, if the brain were a
single organ,
and one
faculty only of that organ predominated,
we should always discover the existence of high-
perhaps too high-action, and yet ve do not. But
this conclusion is not necessary, because the one
organ may posssess a
peculiar aptitude for one func-
tion more than for another; and in such case, there
is no necessity for high action in order to give pro-
minence to the peculiar function. This by no
means
precludes the combination of high action with
peculiar manifestation, but only decides that the
one is not necessary to the other, which is the point
in dispute.
Another argument alleged by the supporters
of phrenology, is, that when mental exertion has
produced fatigue, this fatigue is removed by a
change of subject for attention, or, as
they would
say, by the employment of another organ. But
this again is by no means
necessary, in order to
secure the relief sought. In reading, for instance,
one author may be studied till fatigue is the
result, and that fatigue will be as
effectually
relieved by taking up a different author on the
same subject, as it would by an entire change of
the object, which had first occasioned fatigue, by
the concentration of nervous
energy upon it.
Again, the intellectual powers have been wearied
over one subject of scientific inquiry, and they are

as much relieved by changing the object of literary
research, as
by diverting the attention into an
entirely new channel; the same
organs, speaking
phrenologically, continue to be employed, and the
relief is produced, notwithstanding, by a
simple
variation in the 'mode of attention. It is change of
action which is the source of relief, not change of
organ: even as, by one of nature's laws, it is easier
to walk than to stand quite still; or to have an in-
finite number of` successive actions of the same mus-
cles, rather than sustained or continued action,
even for a short time. Phrenology, therefore,
gains no
support from this supposed change of
organ.
'
A variety of arguments, however, have been ad-
duced on the opposite side of the question, which
it would be right briefly and candidly to notice.
First, it has been said, that in some
subject or
other, almost every portion of the brain has been
destroyed by accident, or lost by disease, or has
been found defective, without any apparent corre-
sponding change in the manifestations of mind.
W'e would give phrenologists the full benefit of' the
answer to this argument, viz. that much of the con-
necting tissue may have been lost or be defective
under such circumstance, without involving the
essential structure, the positive nervous fibres of
any one particular organ, and also that this loss
of cerebral substance, and any corresponding
change of mental manifestation, may have yet
escaped notice; such is the habit of careless ob-
servation among the generality of inquirers. Yet

78 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
it must be allowed to be very remarkable, that a
set of opposite facts have not been sustained by the
phrenologists, in which such injuries have been
followed by such changes. Until such facts have
been produced in such a series as to warrant
drawing inferences from them, the argument must
be allowed to throw some kind of discredit on their
very positive conclusions; and we mention here
this peculiarity of their conclusions, because it is an
attribute which does not belong to profound science
or
deep investigation ; which does, on the contrary,
attach to ignorance of scientific research ; and
which, therefore, does always excite doubt and sus-
picion in the minds of the most patient inves-
tigators after truth.
Secondly, as the same stomach receives and
digests different kinds of food, and ultimately con-
verts them also tothe same elements of nourishment
to the body, which again is distributed to a
great
variety of purposes; so there can be no reason
why
the brain should not receive a
great variety of
notices, and refer them to the same presiding mind,
which again distributes its notices, and issues its
mandates to the several portions of its complex
dominion. There is a
perfect harmony and sim-
plicity in this arrangement, which nothing can
surpass, and towards the accomplishment of which
there are no insurmountable difiiculties.
Thirdly, the same nerves are
capable of a
variety
of functions; as for instance, in receiving impres-
sions, and conveying sensations to the brain; and
of communicating volition from the presiding mind,

through the brain to different parts of the animal
economy. It is indeed true, that these two func-
tions are believed to reside in different sets of fibres,
the one
conveying notices to the brain, and the
other receiving such notices from that organ, and
not capable of acting interchangeably. But if the
same
apparent fibres are capable of performing two
such opposite functions, there can be no reason for
supposing a
probable necessity for that distinction
of organs, which allots different fibres for the execu-
tion of different and highly-divisible functions.
Fourthly, the appearances of the skull are not to
be relied upon, as
giving indications of the pre-
sence of certain organs; for the following rea-
sons :--
a. The external prominences do not always cor-
respond with internal projections of the brain, but
are occasioned by a different cause.
b. The shape, and thichncsss, and texture of the
skull, have reference to the greater or less liability
of the several parts to pressure, or to blows from
without, which might endanger the well-being of
the sensorial organ; and also in some instances to
the attachment of muscles.
c. These appearances are oftentimes dependent
upon their having formed centres of osszfcation
for the bones of the cranium in early life. In com-
pleting the ossification of the head, it is well known
that nature has made beautiful provision for its
early accomplishment, considering the extent of
surface to be walled in. This must have been a
very long process, if the radii of ossification had to

shoot from one common centre to the entire circum-
ference. Therefore nature has subdivided the
work; first, into several bones; and then has given
to each bone several centres of ossification, from
which the radii shoot out, and inosculate with the
radii proceeding from other centres ; the whole work
being completed by the joining of the textures, and
the filling up of the little spaces supposed to be
left by the rationale of this process.
Now it is manifest, that each of these centres of
ossification will naturally possess a
larger quantity
of ossific matter, than at the inosculation of the
radii above mentioned, and, therefore, will retain
the appearance of prominences and projections ;
and will thus produce the semblance of those organs,
the existence of which has been claimed as demon-
strated. This fact is beautifully illustrated by the
bones of a child's skull now before me, who was
murdered by its unnatural parent at three weeks of
age; a
very considerable thickness is to be found
at these ossific centres, while at the extreme points
of radiation the cranium is so thin as to be trans-
parent, and to leave very little ossific matter depo-
sited. Here then would be organs in great activity,
in the central bony origins, and of great feebleness,
or total absence, ata distance from these centres.
The increase of frontal brain, with the necessary
expansion of its external covering, is the consequence
of mental qfort. As muscle is developed by exer-
cise, so also is the growth of brain promoted by any
extrordinary demands made upon it by the govern-
ing _mind. Thus the full developement of the

manifesting organ is in some measure dependcut
upon the mental effort ofthe creature. This will
also serve to explain the mode of operation in edu-
cation, in religious instruction, in the Holy Spirit's
influence: the attainment of the objects proposed
by all these means is usually slow and gradual, and
is likened by our Saviour himself to the impercep-
tible growth of corn.
Fifthly, the size of an
organ, neither in nature
nor in mechanics, is any indication ofits power and
energy of action. On the contrary, firmness and
tineness of texture, and completeness of adjustment,
give that power and energy, which size cannot
communicate, but to which, on the contrary, it seems
to be inimical.
Phrenologists then err against nature and science,
when they attribute increased energy to increased
size. The mainspring ofa watch is not to bejudged
of by its size, whether absolute or relative ; the most
surprising effects are
produced by the minutest
machinery ; the strength ofa bone or
joint does not
depend on its size; on the contrary, large bones
and large joints, (and it might be added, large
heads,) are
commonly feeble; and in all athletic
performances, small bones and joints will always
endure longer, and sustain more fatigue, and per-
form better, than those which are larger.
Lastly, phrenologists appeal very loudly to expe-
rience ; they speak of theirs being a science of ob-
servation-of their accumulation offacts-of their
deduction from facts. Granting them thc credit of
being accurate and disinterested observers, it must

be urged that they are
very far from being uniform
in their experience, or
agreed in their results ; and
consequently that they must be inaccurate observers,
or inconclusive reasoners ; besides that there exists a
great number of counter-facts, which militate
strongly against their conclusions.
Now when the same observers, looking at the
same object, arrive at different results, and draw
dissimilar conclusions in a matter of observation,
which, if true, should be invariable ; and when it is
a fact, that, so far from being invariable, there are
many most startling discrepancies; when it is
recollected, that according to the supposition, the
facts should be invariable, and therefore, that a
very few counter-facts will utterly invalidate what
a
great many can
barely substantiate, it will follow,
that a considerable degree of doubt will rest upon
their conclusions; and that the wise and prudent
will not accept these conclusions, without much
hesitancy.
We are free to admit, that these erroneous obser-
vations and reasonings may be charged on the
infancy of the science, and the inaccuracy of ob-
servers, or the incompetence of the reasoners; but
if the science be still in its infancy, if some of its
observers be thus inaccurate, and some of its
reasoners thus incompetent, who is to decide at pre-
sent on the established facts, or the just reasonings
of phrenology 'I-again, tl1e wise and prudent will
hesitate. ~

have a cause to serve, an
hypothesis to substan-
tiate; and that they set off to look after facts to
support their preconceived opinions, it will follow,
that their evidence should be thoroughly and
severely tested, before it can be received as testi-
mony; and that this fact throws an additional
weight into the scale of prudential doubt and hesi-
tation.
The supporters of phrenology appeal very loudly
to experience. Now experience may be very easily
perverted, by a blind attention to the evidence of
the senses on the one hand, or
by listening to the
suggestions of prejudice on the other.
The phrenologist may be led astray by the evi-
dence of his senses, almost more than any man, in
consequence of the skull of some remarkable person
presenting some
peculiar prominence ; in search of
support for this phenomenon, he will be led away
from the full and mature influence of reason and
reflection, and claim for himself the entire credit
of being guided by experience ; whereas this so
vaunted term becomes nothing better than blindfold
errperiment, unless it is characterized hy that ful-
ness and fairness of induction, which can only
result from the accumulation of our own
facts and
reasonings, enlarged, tested, modgfied, by the facts
and reasonings of others.
The baneful influence of prejudice is also griev-
ously felt in the tendency which it creates, to End
facts suitable to the favourite hypothesis, and to
distort them, so as to make them bend to precon-
ceived notions.

84 THE nncrrnocu. INFLUENCE
Thus the theorist is dazzled away from truth,
while the accumulator offacts perverts it, and is be-
trayed from the only path to real knowledge, viz.
patient intelligent observalian, and enlarged views,
drawn, not as inferences from a small number of
data, but as inductions from a
large series of un-
prejudiced observations, aided by sound judgment
and just reasoning, supported by experience, and
verified by many inquirers, at different times, and in
distant quarters of the world.
We have now
honestly recorded our doubts on the
subject of phrenology ; and without farther passing
sentence on its merits, we shall proceed to consider
the question of materialism,-a charge which
attaches equally (if at all) to those who consider
the brain to be the organ of mind, as
against those
who believe in the complexity of its organisation.

CHAPTER IV.
ON MATERIALISM-ITS REAL BEARING, AND THE
PRESENT DISCUSSION SHOWN T0 HAVE NO TEN'
DENCY T0 THIS DOCTRINE.
BEFORE we
proceed further, it is necessary to
consider two classes of objections which have been
urged against the foregoing views: first, that of
their leading to materialism; and next, of their
tendency to establish a
spiritual agency, of the ex-
istence of which there is no proof.
It is remarkable that charges of so
very opposite
a nature, should be adduced by highly estimable
individuals ; and yet such has been the case
among
the author's correspondents, affording no
trifling
presumption of the accuracy of' his views; for
although the opposite of right is not always wrong,
nor the opposite of error
always truth ; yet when
the self-same proposition, contemplated by different
persons, from different points of view, or
through
variously prejudiced media, produces a
precisely
opposite impression,-the presumption is certainly

86 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
in favour of its truth ;-and of its being placed
among that class of truths which holds the middle
way between contending parties, and which being
undefined by those peculiar prominences of cha-
racter, which each fierce disputant would earnestly
seek after, is therefore left unrecognized by the
partisan, and unacknowledged by those, who, in the
warmth of their zeal, would exclaim with a certain
degree of indignation,
"
He who is not for us, is
against us," in entire forgetfulness, that this sen-
tentious conclusion admits of being, readily turned
into an
equally forcible truth, "He who is not
against us, is for us."
Theseobjections must be examined separately;
and, first, the charge of materialism, which applies
as much to the single as to the plural organ ; inas-
much, that if reference be made at all to organic
influence, it is not very important whether that
reference have respect to one
organ or
many: the
real point of objection being, that the brain should
be supposed to exert any influence upon the mani-
festations of mind.
Now in the outset of our
inquiry it might be
suflicient to ask, if the brain be the organ Q" mind-
thatis, the medium through which its manifestations
take place; how couldit be otherwise, than that
these manifestations should partake of the nature of
the medium through which they pass? And then
unless every brain be of the same kind in every
individual, and under all circumstances of health
and disease-action and inaction-excitement and

collapse-culture and waste-it is impossible that
the manifestations can be alike.
Now this supposition is so
notoriously contrary to
fact, and would, if allowed, conduct to propositions
so
palpably absurd, that the answer to the charge
might almost safely be permitted to rest here,
were it not desirable, at one view, to show that
the charge of materialism has no foundation what-
ever.
Did not daily experience bear out the conclu-
sion, that the manifestations of mind are influ-
enced by different states of the body in general, and
of the brain in particular ; did we not constantly see
the effect of various bodily changes-of the irrita-
tion of disease--of the influence of medicine-of
returning health-of advancing age-and of a
thousand other causes, acting only upon the organ,
it would be very simple d priori reasoning--that if
the brain be the manifesting organ, which all
admit, these manifestations must take a
tinge from
the medium through which they pass; just as
water, a
simple element, takes its character from
the soil through which it has passed; or the air
becomes impregnated with the aroma of flowers, or
with various noxious exhalations ; or as the rapidity
of a current is influenced by the nature of its
banks, the declivity of the country through which
it passes, the obstacles it encounters, and a thou-
sand_other circumstances, permanent or accidental.
Now this t2 priori reasoning is supported by
facts :-for it is a fact,

characterized by physical temperament, which phy-
sical temperament is always constituted by the
brain; so that it may be foretold, by a knowledge
of such temperament, what will be the peculiar
manifestations of mind.
2. That the capacity for education may always
be estimated from such acquaintance with physical
structure.
3. That direct or
sympathetic disturbance of the
brain will introduce disorder into the mental
manifestations; that a
simple headache will take
away the power of thought; that a certain little
more of morbid condition will occasion unreal
fears, illusions, and hallucinations; and that a still
more
aggravated form of malady will produce in-
sanity with all its complications.
4. That even a
fainting fit, which temporarily
deprives the brain of its regular supply of blood,-
an
hysterical paroxysm,-a trifling giddiness, how-
ever
produced, or a blow upon the head which
occasions stunning, or the mildest form of concus-
sion of the brain, will all suspend the manifesta-
tions of mind, and be accompanied by a state very
closely resembling death, or the entire absence of
such manifestation.
With such reasoning, supported by such facts, it
seems almost a waste of time to adduce more argu-
ment in support of the views upheld by the present
work; but in a
question of such vital importance,
and involving in its consequences christian truth,
there is no
point connected with it which must not
be rigidly examined.

Thus, a
living writer, whose opinions are deserv-
ing of the highest respect, and who occupies a
station in the christian world, of the greatest possi-
ble usefulness and influence, writes,
"
Although I
do not think that it can
fairly be accused of incul-
cating materialism, yet I must confess that it re-
quires a
good deal of consideration to see
clearly
the distinction between the moral qualities of the
mind, and the developement of its functions through
the medium of the brain. After all, the single
fact, of a
person having retained all his faculties
uninqiaircd, after that the greater portion of his
brain had become dissolved into lymph, seems to
me to upset a
great part of your reasoning."
And so it must, the _fact were such; for if a
function be carried on as well without the interven-
tion, and even after almost the entire disorganiza-
tion of the organ supposed to be appointed for this
purpose; it would follow, necessarily, that if the
function be carried on without the organ, the sup-
posed organ is not the one destined for the per-
formance of that function, which must therefore be
carried on
by some other organ, or without organic
intervention.
But the fact is not so :-for first, the brain does
not receive any material injury, without leaving its
traces in future life upon the mental manifestations ;
and if these traces be few, and feeble, and transient,
this constitutes the exception, and not the rule.
And, in the next place, it is not a fact, that the
mental functions have been carried on, when the
brain has been dissolved into lymph; for in all

90 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
such alleged instances, the change which takes
place is one of expansion, and not of destruction ;
the brain is not changed into lymph, but the Huid
is poured out into the interior cavities; the walls of
those cavities are pushed outwards, and this process
continuing, the natural junctions of the different
bones composing the skull give way, and by de-
grees the head becomes enormously enlarged-the
brain beingalways exteriorto this iiuid accumulation,
and occupying a surface, large in proportion to the
extension of a substance, which before occupied a
confined space; and as this change has taken place
in early life, and has been very slow in its opera-
tion, the brain has become so accustomed to the
alteration of its position, that the manifestations of
mind, though not equal to what they would have
been in a sound and healthy state, are not so much
impaired as would seem
probable to casual ob-
servers, especially if unacquainted with the exist-
ence of the entire brain, though in a state Q" greater
extension and proportioned thinness.
So much for the facts supposed to be connected
with this objection ; but with regard to the reason-
ing, when we differ from :such a man, we almost
doubt the correctness of our own conclusions ; but
we
apprehend that the difficulty in his mind arises
from not keeping steadily in view that the moral
gualities do not originate in the brain; that the
brain is the servant of mind ; that the organization
was formed for the individual, not that the indivi-
dual was suited to the organization; and that the
mind or spirit is an immaterial principle conferred

only upon man, and superadded to his more
perfect
organisation, to guide, and govern, and direct all
his conduct and his motives.
Thus it will be seen that the spiritual functions
are not developed by t/ze brain, but that they are
only rendered cognisable to us
through that medium.
Mental thought and feeling, emotion and passion,
so far as
they are not connected with purely animal
function, which are common to man and the lower
animals, originate with the spiritual principle, and
give laws to the organisation. Nevertheless, the
e.1yJ1'ession of these spiritual originations may be,
and doubtless is, tinged and characterized, as it is
made known to others, through the material
medium, which is appointed for their manifesta-
tion, and which constitutes a
portion of the state of
trial and probation in which we are
placed ; for the
spirit is accountable for its own
thoughts,-for the
actions and conduct of its servant, the brain; and
upon this has been impressed some
debasing trans-
formation, which chains it down to animal pro-
pensity, and proves a
great source of trial and con-
flict to the best-ordered minds.
In consequence of this change, the intellect is no
longer so
apt for exertion ; the perceptions are not
so accurate ; deep reflection is a burden ; con-
sciousness is liable to error; and so, also, with
regard to all the purely mental manifestations.
lf, therefore, we cannot derive the same
impres-
sion from similar objects, it is, probably, because
we look at those objects from different points of

view; or from some difference in the organs @'
sense, through which all our real knowledge is con-
fessedly obtained.
The point contended for is, that the brain does
exert an influence upon the manifestations of mind ;
that it gives a
prevailing tinge to them when
healthy; that, though originally perfect, some
change has passed upon it, insomuch that the
instrument is impe1y'ect, and that its defects, or
diseases, and even its minor morbid actions, do
exert a
perverting influence over the images of
thought; that they do throw a
disturbing agency
over our
perceptions ; that they do alter the nature
of our sensations; and that oftentimes they do give
rise to impressions which are unreal.
Against conclusions of this nature the charge of ma-
terialism has been brought; and it has been reiterated
and deepened, when this influence has been shown
to extend to the will, so that, according to the func-
tion of volition, it should give tone, and energy,
and action to the body, and persevering exertion to
the mind,°so long as the condition of the brain was
healthy; or that, in its opposite state, it should
enfeeble and even
paralyze the bodily actions, and
render uncertain and vacillating the operations of
the mental will.
We have the highest respect for objections of
this nature, because they originate in the excess of
right,-in a fearful apprehension of diminishing
the moral accountability of the spiritual individual
by allowing too much for the intlueuce of the

body upon the manifestations of mind; and we
cannot help thinking that we must differ from our
.spiritualist friends more in the terms which we
employ, than in the things of which we speak;
since it does appear so
impossible to doubt that the
material brain and nervous
system are the appointed
organ, instrument, and servant of mind; and that
as such, its physiological power of conveying mental
impulse is very great; while the pathological in-
fluence of its disorders is also quite incalculable in
disturbing the harmony, or
completeness, or
per-
fection of these notices.
No two things can be more distinct than the
.spiritual mind and the material brain: yet the
former can receive no
intelligence nor communi-
cate any notices without the latter; and thence it
follows, that if the brain be not in a sound state
that intelligence, and those notices, may be incor-
rect, defective, or
perverted.
Vith regard to the particular function of volition,
on which hangs, after all, the essential point in
dispute; since the question really is, whether the
man is the slave of his organisation, and that his
will to do right may be superseded by a corporeal
tendency to do wrong ; or whether the brain is the
servant of mind, and that the mental will is supreme,
-gives laws to the material organisation,-and is
thoroughly accountable for all its voluntary errors,
all its deviations from right, all its listening and
yielding to bodily influence? .
With regard to the will, it should be recollected
that there is no
possibility of communicating the

sentiments except by a
separate act of volition for
every letter, of every word, of every sentence, which
embodies the ideas, whether this communication be
made orally, or
through the medium of writing.
Admitting the first, which no reasonable person
can doubt, it follows that the energy of this function
is very great, and that the integrity of the brain
and nervous
system is indispensable, in order to
secure a
perfect elaboration of the materials of
thought.
But grant this, and it follows, that the in-
tegrity of the brain be necessary to the perfection
of mental manifestation, and that the brain and
nervous
system be subject in themselves to every
degree of perfectness, as well as to every grade of
feebleness and every variety of perverted action,
so must there be a
corresponding change in the
shades of mental manifestation.
Mistakes are often made on the subject of voli-
tion, both in a
practical and a theoretical point of
view. The mere act of wishing, and the decided
exercise of the will, are often confounded with each
other; yet no two things can be more unlike.
The one is a
merely indolent, passive, inoperative
desire, (even if it amount to desire,) that such an
acknowledged good were
possessed, but there is no
corresponding effort to attain it; the other is a
state of high mental and bodily action, in which, if
it be a strenuous will, both mind and body are con-
centrated upon the object to be obtained, and not
only concentrated, but energized to the highest
pitch of intensity.

or BODY AND MIND. 95
A beautiful illustration of the energy of this
function has recently come before me; which,
when wrought up in this manner, succeeded in
controlling one of the most unmanageable of all
unmanageable diseases, viz. the paroxysms of
hooping-cough. Every one is familiar with the
difliculty of repressing ordinary cough-greatly
increased by the spasmodic paroxysm just men-
tioned. No person, by wishing to control either
the former or the latter, will ever
produce the
slightest effect. Yet, by the exercise of a deter-
mined will, by a continued struggle against the
recurrence of the paroxysms, and by a constant and
energetic warfare, which we should all do well
morally to imitate, and which should make us all
blush for so easily yielding to temptation, this
liability to paroxysm was undermined and over-
come. lconfess this case filled me with admiration
of the individual for her determined energy of
purpose, and with astonishment and thankfulness
to God for his "
wonderful works, and his good-
ness to the children of men."
It seems to be universally allowed, even by those
who are so fearful on this question of materialism,
that we neither have, nor can obtain, any know-
ledge, but such as is communicated to us, through
the medium of the senses.
Now the organs of sense are
undoubtedly mate-
rial, and they depend for their perfection upon the
integrity of material nerves, and a material brain,
with which these nerves are in the closest com-
munion.

96 THE nncrenocfu, INFLUENCE
Since, then, man can receive no knowledge,
except through a material medium ; and since,
again, without the continued assistance of certain
other material nerves, he can neither write, read,
nor
speak, it is clear that he can communicate no
knowledge except through a material medium.
And since man can neither receive nor communi-
cate lznowledgc, except through a material medium,
it is surely not irrational, nor
unp/iilosophical, nor
anti-christian, to conclude, that the intermediate linkin
the chain, the elaboration and clothing of knowledge
so received, or to be so communicated, is also accom-
plished through the instrumentality of a material
medium. And if so, the question of the existence
of amaterial organ, as a servant to the spiritual
principle, and as
necessary to its manQ"estations, n
set at rest.
Ve might quote in this place with advantage, the
following observations from a little work by the
Rev. Richard Warner, entitled "
The Anti-Mate-
rialist," and published some
years since. "
All the
attainments, and all the powers, which distinguish
the most humble from the loftiest mind: the
results of scientific research, and the deepest know-
ledge of the facts, the combinations of genius, and
the creations of fancy, derived, as they originally are,
through the medium of the senses, and depending,
as
they entirely do, on the more or less perfect and
delicate conformation and condition of the material
part of our frame, partake of the nature of matter,
the fountain from which they spring, and the
channel through which they flow.

"
The whole mass, indeed, of what may be
called human knowledge, (that is, of those objects
and facts, respecting which the mind has clear, per-
fect, and satisfactory perceptions,) is limited to the
evidence of the senses, and even the purest branch
of it, geometrical and mathematical truth, rests ulti-
mately on material ideas, on forms and qualities
suggested by impressions made on the organs of
sensation. The moment we dismiss these palpable
guides to what is real and true, we get within the
confines of uncertainty. The regions of abstraction
may be delightful, but they are a land of shadows,
filled by forms without substance, and appearances
destitute of actual existence. The honest, though
humiliating fact is, that laying aside those truths
which are revealed to us
by God, in his own sacred
Vord, we have no
perfect knowledge here below, of
anything that lies beyond the limits of matter; that
the mind cannot rest upon aught as indubitable,
which is not conveyed to it by impressions made
upon the bodily faculties of hearing, seeing, tasting,
smelling, and touching."
This argument might be carried still further, by
asserting that we do not even know the complete
meaning of the term material. We really know
not wherein the elements of matter consist; and
although we are acquainted with some of its pro-
perties, we do not know its essence; neither are we
sure that it may not possess properties, or assume
forms, with which we are unacquainted, and which
are too subtle to be recognized by our senses. Hence
we do not consider the question of the materiality

98 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
of the soul as
being very important, because what
we call spiritual, may, in fact, be an
infinitely fine
modification of matter, far too subtle to be appre-
ciated by our
present powers. All we contend for
is, that the brain is not that modyication of matter;
but that it is subservient to the mind. This might
supersede the question of materialism ; but we wish
to meet it on its own
grounds, to take the common
acceptation of the term, as
generally received, and to
show t.hat our views do not conduct to a belief in its
cheerless doctrines.
Before entering further upon this subject, and
alter the avowal of the foregoing paragraph, it is
necessary to state, that this question is not so all-
inqzortant as it has been thought by many excellent
persons, who have reasoned thus, that only that
which was immaterial could be immortal. This,
however, by no means follows; first, because we
know not what the term material means; and,
secondly, because it is not a
property of matter to
be destructible, but indestructible; and to exist
under ever new and varying forms of combination ;
so that even here, there could be no reason
why a
material soul might not undergo, during the stage
of its existence after the death of the body, that puri-
fying and ennobling change, which would fit it for
its new state of immortality. The flower which
fades, and droops, and perishes, and vanishes from
our sight, may enter into new combinations, and
soon again appear in the form of some other flower
of far richer hues, and of infinitely higher fragrance
and beauty. .

The property of irnnzatemhlity, then, is not neces-
sary to immortalit_y, though, according to our com-
mon forms of Weech, and in comparison with what
we know of other material substances, we believe
the soul to be immaterial, because it wants those
properties of matter with which we are ac-
quainted.
There is, however, not a trace of reasoning to
support the position, that the higher mental powers
which man
possesses are the result of organisation ;
the rational soul is a
principle superaclded to orga-'
nisation, the latter forming the exquisitely adapted
instrument, for the manifestation of the higher
movements of the former.
Thus, mind is a
principle, or, if it be preferred, a
being superadded to, but not inherent in brain, (just
as life is superaddecl to organisation,) and is to be
found only in man, because man alone is a moral
and religious creature, accountable for his actions,
where they are social, to his fellow man ; and for all
his thoughts, and feelings, and conduct, to the
Supreme Governor.
This view is attempted to be discredited by an
opponent, because he cannot understand how imma-
terial mind can act upon material body. And what
then ? Is this the only efect which he cannot un-
derstand, and yet which he receives upon trust?
Can he understand how an
impression upon a
nerve
produces pain? Can he say what pain is?
Can he explain why the process of digestion is
performed by the stomach? Why it is troubled by
any mental impression of a sudden character, or

why it is suspended by cutting off the supply of'
nervous
energy? Can he understand or
explain
how the morbid action of one nerve
produces
morbid action upon some distant nerve? Or can
he understand how impressions made upon certain
nerves, produce saliva in one instance, tears in a
second, or bile in a third ? Can he understand the
simplest phenomena which are around him? Or
can he explain the reason for the simplest chemical
action ?
But if man cannot understand or
explain the
more obvious phenomena, except by merely stating
their efccts, what reason has he to object. against
the manifestation of mental phenomena, shown by
the brain as the instrument or
organ, under the in-
fluence of mind as the agent, because /ze cannot com-
prehend the process. It is a law of our
existing con-
stitution, that there are
many things which we
cannot understand, and that everywhere there is
a limit placed to our researches.
Since, then, an actual incorporeal state of the
human soul is nowhere revealed as an
object of
faith; and since we know not the properties of
immateriality, and are not in possession of any sufli-
cient grounds, why the soul may not be some infi-
nitely subtle modification of matter, we should con-
sider the settlement of this question as
unimportant,
and as being fairly left within the domain of unex-
plored philosophical speculation.
All we contend for is, that the brain which we
see, is not that spiritual essence; though we
fully
admit, that while the body and soul are

healthy condition
ofthe latter they are
co-existing-intimately blended
-in a
way of which we are ignorant, and pro-
ducing eH`ects upon each other reciprocally, through-
out the entire circle of sentient and rational life.
It is necessary in this place to consider some of
the objections advanced against the immateriality
of the soul ; and this is a
question of so much im-
portance, in connexion with our
grand principle,
that the manifestations of spihtual mind are influ-
enced by tbe material medium through which
they become manifest, that we must be permitted
to notice them in detail.
The immaterial doctrine is said to complicate
and confuse discussions on this subject, because
we know not the meaning of the terms material
and immaterial, as
distinguished from each other.
It is, however, unphilosophical to urge this objection,
because we have already shown, that the distinction
is not important; and because the same
objection
might be made against a
variety of other inquiries,
in conducting which, it is agreed by the tacit con-
sent of philosophers in general, to accept certain
terms as
designating the amount of our
knowledge
of certain circumstances with which we do not pro-
fess to be thoroughly acquainted, and as
very
useful to our
ignorance in conducting our investi-
gations.
Such, for instance, are the phenomena of gravi'
tation, and light, and heat, and electricity, and
galvanism, and nervous influence, and life, and

afiinity, and various other agents, of the nature of
which we know nothing, and can
only judge by
their effects manifested under certain circumstances.
But it would be most unphilosophical to allow these
to be employed in our researches, and to refuse a
similar privilege to the immaterial principle, where
the position is precisely identical. Thus, for in-
stance, life is a
principle superadded to matter:
we do not deny its existence, because we know not
even the meaning of the term; but we
study its
operations, and endeavour to acquaint ourselves
with its results, tracing them backwards as far as
we are able. _
Secondly,
"
God is omnqiotent; and he could, if
he so willed, make matter (the brain) to think;
and he could, if he so willed, make thought, or
the substance of thought, immortal." Now this is
admitted ;-but again, upon the principle of the
objectors themselves, we know not the full mean-
ing of the terms we
employ, when we
speak of the
Supreme Governor of the universe, and can
only
judge of him by his works, and by what he has
chosen to reveal of lzimseQ' to us. In occupying
this position, of course I am not contending with
the infidel-it would be mere waste of time to
argue the point with him.
We judge of God by his works; and we find
that under many circumstances one
rapid stride is
made towards the most perfect of his creatures, by
the superaddition of a new
principle. Thus, life is
enjoyed by plants; then is superadded a nervous

system, and the power of locomotion, instinct, with
varying combinations of animal intelligence; and
still higher, the human mind.
It is true that God might make the brain to
think and reason, and might also make that brain
immortal ; but God has not so willed. We find
that brain, as brain, does not reason, and that it is
liable to disease and decrepitude, decay and death,
-to existence under a
changed form, and perhaps
to existence in many brains, during the course ofa
lengthened series of years; and this would be in-
consistent with the idea of an immortal existence:
whereas, the
superaddition of a
spiritual principle
destined to live for ever is consistent with the gene-
ral harmony of God's works, and with what he has
pleased to reveal of himself to his creatures as a
Spirit-man being created in his own image, and
therefore partaking in a limited degree of that
spiritual nature which is to us
incomprehensible,
but not less an
object of belief; nor more incom-
prehensible than the qualities of matter, or even
matter itself.
There is, too, a consciousness in man, that lw
(that is, mind) possesses a
power of controlling and
superseding, to a certain extent, the very many
morbid states of cerebral action. Now, if brain
elaborated thought, how could it control its own
deviations; or how could it exercise self-denial, a
state of self-control, which is, however, rendered
necessary by our peculiar position, and which can
only be effected by the influence of mind over
matter?

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
Seeing, then, that the Almighty Governor of the
universe has not chosen to confer the higher attri-
butes of reason upon matter, and that he has
devolved a
portion of his spirit upon man, why
should we seek to complicate this discussion, by
supposing a different kind of brain conferred upon
man, capable of an attribute totally distinct and
diverse from that possessed by any other brain ;
and why should we not accept the simpler spiritual
hypothesis? And though we know not the nature
of mind, why should we not be contented to study
its effects, and to trace the modifying iniiuence
of the cerebral organs upon the mental manifes-
tations ?
Now this hypothesis seems to fulfil the great phi--
losophical desiderata, viz. that it is true as borne
out by the testimony of revelation ; and that, when
taken in connexion with the preceding views of cere-
bral function, it is sujicient to explain the phenomena.
Nor is the testimony of revelation to be undervalued;
for the entire question must be taken up on broad
grounds, and information must not be rejected
from any quarter. In purely physical inquiries, a
knowledge of all the sciences is indispensable for
the _full discovery of truth. Why then, in the
present inquiry, ought not the positive statements
of Scripture, in its own
peculiar province, to be held
of supreme importance, and to form the sound
basis of physico-metaphysical reasoning T
Thirdly, "it seems
unphilosophical to consider
sensation, and other vital phenomena, as immedi-
ately dependent on the body; but to regard the

mental phenomena as
something essentially diferent or
distinct."
The real truth is, that it is unphilosophical and
irrational to confound things which differ essen-
tially; to place them erroneously in the same scale,
and then to reason
upon them, as if each were uni-
form in nature and properties. Man, in common
with other animals, possesses sensation and other
vital phenomena, which are
dependent upon the
body ; but these differ essentially from thought and
other mental phenomena, which are
superadded to
sensation and other vital phenomena, which do not
originate in the body; which body is in fact sub-
servient to them, and is employed for their mani-
festation.
We do not represent the mental phenomena as
distinct from the body, but dependent upon it, for
their manifestation; the difference consisting in this,
that whereas the animal is the slave of his organ-
isation, the superadded powers of man are such, as
to give laws to that organisation; and to govern,
direct, and control its propensities; that is, that in
man, as in every other gradation of being, the body
is formed for the situation a11d wants of the creature,
not stretching beyond the ordinary requirements of
animal life, except in man, in whom everything
bespeaks, that his physique is subjected to his
morale.
Since, however, the latter is not only different
from, but essentially opposed to, animal wants and
desires, it is surely most unphilosophical to con-
found the nervous systems of the two; and to

106 THE nscirnocn. INFLUENCE
believe them identical, differing only in the degree
of developement, and having all their actions refer-
able to the same cause, viz. the uncontrolled influ-
ence of nervous fibre.
It is therefore clear, that those who contend for
an immaterial principle in man, superadded to, and
giving laws to his cerebral structure, are indeed
supported by philosophy and fact, and that they
are not carried away by vain hypothesis: in truth,
they have no favourite hypothesis to serve, whereas
their opponents have, and are desirous of reducing
the actions of man to the level of an educated oran-
outang.
But it is said by the truly valuable, though we
believe mistaken reasouer, that we have no
proof,
or at least no
good proof; of the existence of an im-
material principle in man, which will not equally
apply to all other animals. The preceding obser-
vations will give a sufficient answer to this objection.
Animals have as much mind (animal mind) as is
necesary for their situation in life: they are not
moral, and therefore not accountable beings; they
live in the selfish circle of animal desire, and ani-
mal gratitication. But when the animal becomes
a moral and accountable being; when he is to
think-to reason-to originate; when selfish desire
is to be yielded to general or individual good; when
appetites and passions are to be governed; when
virtue is to be cultivated, and vice repressed; when
man is expected to govern all other animals,
and especially to govern himself; when he is to
subdue inclination, and to carry out moral princi-

ples in action; in short, when he is to live a life
of self-denial, and of the subjugation of inclination
to a sense of duty; then animal mind would be
totally ineflicient; a new
principle of a new moral
character is given him,-the immaterial soul is
superadded,-and he becomes the immortal crea-
ture: thus proving, that in his origin, progress,
present history, and future destiny, he is essentially
above the animal creature ; and therefore it would
be absurd to deny him the possession of some new
principle, which would fit him for his own
peculiar
situation.
The same
unphilosophical confusion exists with
a far less candid reasoner,*, who believes that
thoughts and desires are but "
modifications of those
parts through whose operation they are
engendered;
and moral motives, like physical stimuli, receive their
power from the condition of the structure on which
they act.
The whole force of this argumentation depends
upon its confusion-"obscurum pro magnifico ;"
and if we succeed in showing that it has no foun-
dation in truth, we need not trouble ourselves with
the results which have been drawn from it, because
if the original proposition be unsound, all the de-
ductions from it will of necessity be baseless.
The first source of fallacy consists in placing
thoughts and desires together, as
having one and
the same
origin. Now it will readily be allowed
that the desires of the animal are but coincident
with, and reciprocally adapted to, modifications of

108 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
the organs appointed for their gratification; and
of their dependence upon, and connexion with,
their respective sensoria. It will also be allowed,
that man, in common with other animals, possesses
similar organs, similar desires, and similar as-
sociations.
But here arises the' confusion, by mixing up
things which the animal possesses, with others
which he has not in common with man; and by
forgetting to ascribe to the latter those peculiarities
which mark him out as so
entirely distinguished
from any other animal.
Thus, thoughts and desires are mixed up together
as if they were
contemporaneous; whereas, no
other animal but man
possesses thought; they do
not think, reason, compare, conclude; desire is
originated by the state of the organisation, and its
immediate gratification is thoughtlessly pursued;
whereas, when the same desire is originated in man,
it is referred to the interior conscience; and in a
well-disciplined mind its gratification is subordi-
nated to moral motives, to social order, to the fitness
of things, to the everlasting beauty of virtue, to
the golden rule of doing to others as he would be
done by, to the laws of God !
Do any of these motives operate upon the animal ?
And if not, it is surely unphilosophical to ascribe
them, or not ascribing them, to reason as if they
were possessed and operative, and thus to confound
things essentially distinct. This primary error
being detected, every conclusion flowing from it
is vitiated, because that is ascribed to animals, as

influencing their actions, which, in point of fact,
they do not possess.
But, secondly, the peculiarities of the character of
man-that of his being a
reasoning, moral, reli-
gious animal, acted upon by his organisation, but
governed by his moral position, which is superior
to, and gives laws to, his animal desires, are not
fairly ascribed to kim. It is true that moral motive
is spoken of as
existing, and as
deriving its power
from the condition of the structure on which it
acts.
Here, there is a suflicient semblance of truth
to make the argument pass current as true. Thus,
it must be allowed that moral action is manifested
through a material organ; and that this action is
to a certain extent modified by its peculiarities,
and by the indulgence and aggravation of a
par-
ticular bias. But it has been shown that this is
the result of some perverting agency; and that it
would not be so, in a
perfect state, because the ten-
dency of all such conditions is to produce disorder
in creation, where, it is manifest, the principle of
order was intended to be predominant. And in
reasoning upon what slzould be, we must take man,
not as he is, but as he ought to be; and t/ten his
opinions and determinations would exhibit the
same absolute perfection, as every other work of
the Creator's hand, when rightly, that is, fully,
understood.
But if moral motive derive its power from the
condition of the structure on which it acts, it is
fair to ask, in what does this moral motive origi-

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
nate, in what does it consist? Does it originate
in the structure upon which it acts? This would
be a solecism in fact, and in language; for it is
evident, that if it act upon a certain structure,
that action is not inherent in the structure, but is
ab exteriori; and as animals in general do not
possess moral motives, it is clear, that these must
spring from some source, which animals do not
possess in common with man.
In what, then, does moral motive consist? It
has been shown, that it does not consist in the
animal structure which is common to man and
animals; and it must therefore depend upon
some additional structure, or
upon some super-
added principle.
Even if it could be shown that this additional
structure existed for the developement of moral
principle ; as there exists no aflinity between animal
structure and moral motive, it would be unphi-
losophical to contemplate this structure, in any
other view than as united to the manfestation of
moral action, not' as
originating such action.
And as this cannot be shown to exist, it is to
the last degree inconsequential and unphilosophical
to assert, that the actions of the animal, and of
reasoning, responsible man, are to be ascribed to
the same cause, traced to the same source, and
bounded by the same
organisation; or to deny that
man
possesses desires in common with animals,
dependent upon his organisation, but that he also
possesses what animals have not, viz. thought, reason,
moral and religious sanction, to guide, and regulate,

and govern his animal propensities; in a word,
that he possesses a
superadded principle-a spi-
ritual soul, destined to enlarge the boundaries of'
his position on earth, to fit him for society, to
enable him to live the life of a
good man, in-
fluenced by moral motive and religious sanction,
derived from the revelation of the will of the
Supreme Governor; to live for ever, when the pre-
sent state of existence has passed; and to enjoy
happiness, or to experience punishment, accordingly
as his thoughts and actions have been consonant
with, or
opposed to, the design for which he was
created.
It will now be necessary to glance at some of
the objections against the immateriality of the
soul :-and first, it has been asserted, that no sub-
stance can act upon another substance, without
possessing some common
property; and since, by
the immaterialists, this common
property is denied
to matter and mind, it is inferred that that which
acts
upon matter cannot be immaterial. It is, how-
ever, quite puerile to draw conclusions from such
premises; for, first, we know not the nature of
matter, and therefore cannot appreciate the several
ways in which it may be acted upon; secondly,
we know not the nature of spirit, and therefore
cannot be acquainted with the varied modes of its
action upon matter ; and thirdly, we know nothing
of the mysterious connexion which exists between
the two; and yet we
pretend to reason
upon all
these unknown circumstances, as if they were
governed by the same laws as the fixed sciences,

112 'rm-; RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
and to draw inferences from that which may be
demonstrated, for that which is incapable of demon-
stration. That mind may possess unknown proper-
ties, having ajinities to, and capable of acting upon,
matter, of which philosophers know nothing, must
be admitted by the candid inquirer: to be con-
vinced that it docs so, requires only an
appeal from
the philosophism of they schools to common sense;
for then it will be seen that a certain thing has
been assumed as a fact, of the existence of which
there is no
proof. But we assert tl1e separate existence
of spirit on the authority of a divine revelation;
and this assumption necessarily precludes the ad-
mission of all physical analogies, as
explanatory of
the agency 'of mind upon matter. Who would
require a mathematical demonstration of facts as-
certained by the taste or smell ?
Again, it has 'been said, that the mind cannot
exist, without occupying a
place, and if so, what is
that place? It is very easy to ask questions of this
kind, and wisely to consider the negative of such
questions as
proven, provided that they are not
satisfactorily answered. But nothing can be more
unphilosophical; even the common sense of man-
kind has stamped this position with a
proverb, viz.
that "
a fool may ask questions, which a wise man
cannot answer." In the present instance, however,
there seems to be no
difliculty in answering tl1e
question ; for. by the terms of the proposition, the
mind being immaterial, we cannot allix the idea of
occupying space to that which has no
particles with
which to fill that space. It is very uuphilosophical

to consider that there can be no existence where
there is no
space demonstrably filled-no palpable
extension. What, for instance, is the seat of life ?
Shall we look for it in the "
punctum saliens," or
the "
ultimum moriens," or where shall we find
it ? We may not here enter upon the question of
life, which will come before us hereafter; it is
only incidentally mentioned, iu_ order to. exemplify
undeniable existence, without demonstrable space;-
and with the impossibility of telling how life acts
upon the assemblage of bodily organs. Life is not
extension: extension, therefore, is not necessary to
our idea of existence; .
So also with regard to
electricity, galvanism,
magnetism, chemical aflinities of various kinds,
nervous influence, &c.; all these are known by
their efects, yet cannot be shown as matter: we
are not acquainted with the mode of their action,
or their relation to other bodies: they possessnot
extension, and are
incapable of demonstration.
It has been objected, that if the soul be purely
immaterial, how can it accornpang/1 the body, having
no local existence? To this, it might be enough to
answer, that we know not but that it may have a
local existence; and that when we
speak of the
localisation of that which is immaterial, we
speak
of that of which we know nothing. W'e know not
but that it might pervade the whole body; we
know not but that its chosen seat may be the brain ;
for being immaterial, it would produce no inconve-
nience by its presence, while it would hold the
citadel, from which its mandates may be issued.

l I4 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
The fourth objection is, that in order to arrive at
any thing like a
comprehensible expression of purely
mental manifestation, we are perpetually obliged to
borrow terms from material objects around us, in
order to express an
approximation towards the idea
intended to be conveyed ; and this arises from our
knowing nothing of immaterial agency, and being,
therefore, obliged to accommodate terms to our
exigencies.
Thus we
speak of apprehension, conception, ab-
straction, emotion, contrition, &.c.; we
speak of a
solid understanding, a clear judgment, a brilliant
fancy, a
capacious and retentive memory, Sac., be-
cause we are
obliged to borrow terms from material
circumstances around us, (not because the qualities
to be represented are material,) in order to explain,
in some measure, phenomena, which, in the pre-
sent state of our knowledge, would be otherwise
inexplicable.
As well might it be insisted on, that the brain
put forth tenacula in order to seize upon an idea;
or that its two hemispheres rubbed together dis-
agreeably in contrition;-as well might it be in-
sisted on, that the faculty of the understanding
was
actually a cube,-that the judgment had been
sharpened by filing,-that the fancy was
transpa-
rent,-or that the memory was
capable of receiving
and retaining large substances, as that the imma-
terial spirit must have a local existence. Both are
manifestly absurd ; we know nothing of the laws of
spiritual life; and it should be ours to rest con-
tented with the fact, that the brain is the organ ¢y"

mind, and with the close study of its manifes-
tations. ~
Still, we must never forget that the brain is not
the ejicient and ultimate agent, although it is the
subordinate drudge. The mind, the immaterial
principle, is the prime mover; and brain is pro-
vided for it, through which all its connexions are
manifested. It is true, that if the brain be destroyed,
the spiritual principle is deprived of its means of
manifestation, but it is not annihilated. Destroy
the eye, and external vision ceases, though the
power of the brain remains for intellectual vision.
One step further: destroy the brain, and the
power of communication with the exterior world
ceases ; the instrument has become unserviceable, but
the immaterial principle remains. We cannot see
without eyes, we cannot think without brain ; but
it is most illogical to conclude, therefore, that the
eye is vision, or brain is thought : this is to confound
the organ and the function.
The same truth is further confirmed by the
phenomena of certain morbid conditions of the
system:-thus, for instance, in paralysis, vain is
the utmost effort of the will to move the paralysed
muscles. Generally, too, the same cause of morbid
action which takes the limb from the control of the
will enfeebles also the power of that will ; it be-
comes weak and vacillating, uncertain and variable,
inenergetic and inconstant; thus showing that
disorder of the instrument interferes at once with
the usual arrangements of the body, and with the

manifestations ty" mind; thus clearly substantiating
the point in question.
W`e infer, then, that there is no
good reason for
believing that the manifestations of mind originate
in the brain; consequently none for tolerating its
fearful consequence, that the destruction of the
soul would be coincident with, or its well-being
would be in any degree influenced by, the dissolu-
tion of the body; it has its own moral existence,
and has employed the brain in its service, but it
has no essential dependence upon the continuance
of its structure.
Even had it been differently appointed by the
Creator, we have already shown that the destruc-
tion of the soul by no means follows upon that
change which we call death. Philosophers admit
that matter is indestructible, and will continue to
exist for ever in its present state, or in new forms
and combinations; the Christian believes that this
new form of being will be a
separate and inde-
pendent existence; and the christian philosopher
combines the two, and, as he contemplates the dim
twilight, and undefined forms of age,or looks upon the
sun as it is going down behind the cloud of disease,
at an earlier period of life, casts his eye forward in
hope to that brighter day when the sun shall no
more
go down-when there shall be one
perpetual
day-a day of spiritual enjoyment--of happiness
augmented by the consciousness of living in the
presence and under the favour and blessing of the
Most High God.

As we
verily believe in the resurrection of the
body, there can be no
difficulty in believing that
the immaterial spirit, so long and so
mysteriously
allied with it, should be re-united to its original
tenement, and then exist under the same forms
and combinations, though the change which shall
have passed upon it by the new-creating power of
God shall have been one of infinite improvement;
so that the body,now perishable, shall be then fitted
for eternal existence in another state of being, and
its immaterial part, no
longer clogged and hindered
by its former encumbrance, shall be fitted for the
pure joys ofheaven, and prepared for the love and
service of God.
It were idle and fruitless to speculate on what
change of being will then have taken place; but it
is easy to perceive, with regard to the body, that it
will be indestructible,-no longer subject to change
and renovation, but always remaining the same;
its appetites and passions, no
longer directed to the
same
objects, will be infinitely purified and sub-
limed, and will receive a new direction, fitted for
a state of spiritual being. The stamp of excellence
will rest upon it, and it will be no
longer liable to
disorder, decay, or
pain; it will be purified from
all that is gross, or
grovelling, or sensual and de-
basing; it will be freed from all its tendencies to
evil, and will he no longer a source of temptation,
trial, and sorrow, to the governing spirit.
Vith regard to the immaterial soul, its full-
blown powers will be developed ; all that here has
been obscure, in consequence of seeking its mani-

festation through a gross material medium, will be
then clear and distinct, in an atmosphere fitted for
the expansion of its powers, as
originally derived
from God himself; the senses will be infinitely
ennobled; the perceptions arising therefrom will
be deepened, and expanded, and magnified;
thought will be capable of a reach altogether inap-
preciable now; the judgment will be freed from
error; the present confined range of ideas will be
supplanted by the grasp of infinite thought; the
memory will combine without effort, and at one
view, the past, the present, and the future; the
affections will expand into perfect benevolence-
love to God and man ; association will be capable
of taking in at once, all that is lovely and good,
while all the former tendencies to evil will be with-
drawn ;-in fact, the germ of all that was
originally
"verygood "in man will receive its fullest expansion
-will be placed upon objects of infinite and peer-
less interest-will be purified from every alloy-
and will exist always, undestroyed and inde-
structible.
There are those who would object that the change
is too great to be believed! Is this objection
worthy to be entertained? Is this change greater
than that which has taken place upon degraded
man since he was
pronounced by his Creator to be
"
very good," and the fact of which is constantly
before our
eyes? But if so
great a
perversion of
its original design, so great a
change for evil, has
been permitted by the Onmqnotent, by which his
gracious purposes have been suspended, is it too

extraordinary, that the seed which
we sow in the autumn, should meet our
eyes and
gratify our senses in the ensuing spring, in all the
beauty and the fragrance of the loveliest Hower? Is
itnot as
extraordinary, that the little, dull, and un-
attractive caterpillar, which we see wrapt in the
sleep of apparent death, and enclosed in its self-
constructed coffin, should by-and-bye appear be-
fore us in life's gayest mood, and in nature's most
splendid attire-arrayed in a structure of exquisite
and inimitable delicacy-and brilliant with hues of
incomparable beauty. The one, ungrateful man
sees and does not reason
upon ; the other he reasons
upon and denies, because he cannot see it. But is
this reasonable-is it just-is it philosophical-is
it logical-is it wise-is it prudent?
Perhaps it may be thought fanciful, and we
by
no means insist upon it, but believing that every-
thing in nature contains some lesson intended
for the use of God's creature, man, we can-
not help mentioning, that perhaps the above
events which happen to the insect tribe, were in-
tended, not only to shadow forth the changes of the
resurrection, but also to tell us, that the award of

good and evil in this life was not _/inal, and that
the equalisation of rewards and punishments would
be in future state of existence. For, as in nature, it
very generally happens, that the most beautiful
caterpillar forms .the dullest moth, and the moth
of greatest beauty and brilliance is commonly pro-
duced from the caterpillar of the least pretensions;
so the final state of existence will rectify all the ap-
parent inequalities in the distribution of tl1e goods
of fortune, and will make clear that justice, and
goodness, and righteousness ofthe supreme Governor,
which here seem to be obscured by events, througl.
the dark vista, of which we cannot discern the end,
-an end which, nevertheless, will assuredly come,
and restore all things to .their just equilibrium.
To return from this digression, it has been said,
and we think injudiciously, that there is "
no case
in which the combination of certain elements pro-
duces something quite different, not only from each
of the simple ingredients, but also different from
the whole compound." Ifthis were true, it would,
we conceive, operate against the great change in the
nature of man which has been just described; and
which is so
great, that but for the union of the im-
material spirit with the body, there would be no
consciousness of personal identity.
But we
apprehend the position is not true. In
many chemical combinations, the resulting com-
pounds will differ widely from the properties of the
original bases, and this too in a most extrordinary
degree, according to the relative preponderance of one
or other of those bases. So also new combinations

possess properties, conferred by their union, which
do not belong to the original ingredients; as, for in-
stance, the power of dissolving gold possessed by
nitro-muriatic acid, but not possessed by either of
the two acids when existing alone, and uncombined.
So also in the phenomena of life, the chicken
apparently possesses no common
properties witl1
the egg, from which under given circumstances it
is produced, and wanting which circumstances, no
developement will occur.
So again, with regard to the seed above men-
tioned, it appears to possess no common property
with the future Hower; yet under the influence of
vital action, the combination of certain elements
produces a
plant quite different in properties from
any which are, or can be supposed to be, in the
seed, and which, but for this vital action, under
favourable circumstances, would never be dis-
covered.
So, lastly, with respect-to-the phenomena of
secretion-ibr instance, the saliva, the juices of the
stomach, tears, bile, &c.;i all theseare produced
under the influence of vital action, from the same
blood in which there exists cl priori not a
vestige
of any one of _these secretions; secretions which
could not, under any circumstances, berecombined
into the same elementalblood ; much less could that
blood be carried backi into its original elements,
through the severalstages of its formation, to its
being furnished with its red particles, and through
the several processes offmaking chyme and chyle,
of assimilation, digestion, deglutition, insalivation,

the stomach, with all the various sources from
whence they were derived.
It has been said, against the supposed immateri-
ality of the soul, that we know nothing of the ex-
istence of matter, except through the mind. Now,
to a certain extent, this is true; but the conclusion
drawn from such truth is erroneous: that is, the
inference drawn from this coincidence of mind and
matter is erroneous. It is certainly true, that we
know nothing of the properties of matter, except as
that knowledge is conveyed to us
through the con_-
sciousness of mind. It is equally true, that we know
nothing of the existence of mind, except as that
knowledge is conveyed to us
through the material
organ the brain. But in either case, it is the medium
for the communication of knowledge; the instru-
ment, not the agent, which has relation to matter,
and which agent we have before shown may be
immaterial; therefore it is assuming the point in
dispute, when it is asserted, that the mind cannot
be immaterial, because it forms the centre Qf con-
sczbusness of our
knowledge of matter.
Another objection of the same kind is, that we
see mind perpetually called into existence before
our eyes; and the inference attempted to be drawn
from this assertion is, that it is therefore undoubt-
edly material. Now the absurdity of this reason-
ing upon the creation of that, which is not obvious
to our senses, is extreme. lt is perhaps best met
by a denial of the assertion; we do not see mind
called into existence before our eyes; we never see

any thing of its origin; we know nothing of its
commencement. We may indeed perceive the in-
strument of mind gradually perfected, so as to be-
come better suited to the developement of its mani-
festations, which therefore may be said to grow, or
to be created. But the fact is, that we know no-
thing of its essence, and all that can be said is,
that the organ appointed for the purpose of convey-
ing notices to the mind, or receiving them in return,
for the purpose of exterior communication, is, by an
established law of nature, of slow growth and deve-
lopement ; and that the manifestations of mind are
proportionate, in order that the individual may pro-
perly occupy his appointed station in society; and
that the beautiful order and harmony which so
strongly characterize all the works of the divine
Architect, may be preserved in this instance also,
one of the most important to the well-being of his
creatures. This argument, by which the objection
is answered, is also supported by the inconceivable
rapidity of mental operation, as of reasoning, think-
ing, writing, speaking, &.c.
Now, thought is a distinct function or oflice of
the sentient principle, and it would be to the last
degree unphilosophical to say, that the function
existed in the brain, because we see
throughout
creation everywhere, brain existing without
thought; therefore, thought is not a
property of
brain or matter, but a
product of the immaterial
principle superadded to brain. And we have else-
where shown, that if thought were material, how-
ever indestructible it might be, yet that the same

thought might exist in different persons in distinct
generations; and, consequently, there could no
longer be that consciousness»of` personal identity,
which is necessary to individual accountability.
The present seems a fit opportunity for intro-
ducing one or two observations on the subject of
personal identity. Since there is no one who pre-
tends to the possession of common sense, yet is
doubtful 'of' his being the same individual that he
was some ten or
twenty years ago, it is 'almost
superfluous to waste much time upon the subject.
Yet, since moral accountability -rests upon this
truth, and since_ erroneous notions respecting it
have been entertained, itis necessary to refer to
it briefly.
~
It has been said, and-isadmitted, that -the body
is constantly changing, undergoing decay and reno-
vation; yet the individual is conscious of being
the same
person, because some
particles of the
original body remain, and that if' no part of' the
body had been left unchanged, there would be a
loss of this consciousness.of` personal identity.
Now this is an error; for, first, we have no reason
to believe, that any molecule of matter now
existing
in our. bodies, will not have been effectually
changed, some
years since, and perhaps oftentimes ;
for no
part is exempted from the general law, and
therefore the consciousness of personal identity
cannot depend. upon the material_fact of some
part
remaining unchanged, as a
lingering nucleus on
which to ground a
reasoning, in proof of iden-
tity.

; or 'BODY AND MIND. 125
The truth admits of much easier and more ra-
tional explanation, since the consciousness of per-
sonal identity Hows from that of continued exist-
ence. The whole may be changed; not a
single
particle of the original body may remain, yet the
change has proceeded so
gradually, that the greater
number of old particles remain, while the new ones
are
prepared; and therefore, at any one
given
moment, there are in the body a much greater
number of old than of new
particles; and the con-
sciousness of personal identity has been trans-
ferred from one set of particles to another, without
any perceptible change. The decay and renovation
have gone on
by an
unperceived process; and it
has been only as a matter of science and reasoning,
that we have known anything of this change; the
consciousness of personal identity cannot, therefore,
rest on
any material condition.
In fact, this consciousness does not depend on
the body, but the mind; it has nothing to do with
the material particles, but rests for its existence
upon the immaterial spirit, and upon the sense of
its continued existence. Now this is, after all,
to be referred to a
species of memory-a recollec-
tion offormer self, as coincident with present se#
The material theory would be inconsistent with
this fact; for if the consciousness of personal iden-
tity depended upon an
oryan of memory, and that
organ formed part of a
body subjected to the ge-
neral principles of renovation and decay, it would
equally be liable to the same
general laws, and

126 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
position of the organ of memory of any given
individual, might at another time form the par-
ticles ofthe same organ in another person, whereby
the consciousness of personal identity must be de-
stroyed; since the same
person cannot exist in
two di{i`erent individuals.
Consciousness of personal identity, therefore, is
an attribute of mind ; and though the organ of me-
mory (ifthere be one) may perpetually change ; and
though the same thing may happen with regard
to the entire brain,-yet, notwithstanding all these
changes, personal identity remains, because it is
a mental and not a
bodily consciousness.
This is one of those truths which do not admit
of demonstration; no
process of reasoning can
conduct us to a
just conclusion; and, indeed, rea-
soning would be utterly thrown away upon that
which must be considered as self-evident. Like
the consciousness of our own existence, it admits
not of proof; it is inherent in our nature, and
placed there by its original constitution; and the
attempt to reason
up to its possession, can
only
be equalled in folly by those philosophers who have
doubted of their own existence.
There are one or two other properties of mind
which we must notice in this place. It has been
alleged, that in contending for the immateriality
ofthe soul, we deprive it of actual properties, and
therefore make it to consist only in a
negation of
properties; and if this were the case, a
wily op-
ponent would infcr, that if the immaterial spirit
consisted only in a
negation of properties, it could

not be the originator of all those active functions
(and especially the will) which we find in man
so
uniformly; and which, if they were not to be
ascribed to this source, need not be traced farther
than the material organ, which would then cease
to be the instrument, and become the prime agent,
thus leading back to the full-blown doctrines ol'
materialism.
But like every other argument of the same kind,
this proceeds upon a
very common sophism, viz.
that of ascribing to opponents sentiments and
opinions which they have never avowed, and then
arguing against them. The advocate for imma-
terialism does not assert that the spirit has no
properties, but that it has no material properties,
and, consequently, is not to be subjected to the
laws of matter. Its properties, therefore, are, like
itself, spiritual, though, by an original law of the
Creator, they are
manifested through, a material
medium, which, in his infinite wisdom, He has
submitted to the governance and control of mind.
But it is contended, that by this mode of rea-
soning we leave the doctrine of mental influences
unexplained; that we do not say what mind is,
but that it consists, as far as our knowledge goes,
in certain manifestations, which we
perceive only
through the /teh; of a material structure, the brain.
And admitting thus much, is the fact of our
ignorance of spiritual nature and essence to be
brought against its existence? Then, indeed, is
our
ignorance of the nature of God to be brought
as an
argument against his existence! Are wc

really to deny the agency of a Great First Cause,
because we are not acquainted with its nature, or
because we
cannot explain its movements? ,Or to
descend to theilevel of the objectors, are we to
deny the existence of matter, because we are
igno-
rant of its nature-because we know not its ulti-
mate composition--because, we are unacquainted
with the earlier stages of its organisation and de-
velopement? Absurd, indeed, were such a denial ;
but not more so,. than of those who deny the im-
materiality of the spirit, because 'they cannot conceive
the form and the mode of spiritual existence, and
know only its agency and manifestation through its
material organ, the brain, which tl1ey, therefore,
most unphilosophically conclude to be mind itsef
The fact is, that the objectors do not bring an
unprejudiced mind to' this inquiry ; they put forth
an
hypothesis which they wish to be true; and
enclosed within the limit of this earth-born wish,
they cannot see
beyond the little_speck of error
upon which they have chosen to concentrate' their
attention. _
Again, it has been objected against_ the imma-
terial doctrine, tl1at,~il` such were the case, there
would be no
change in mind; for that being
immaterial, it would partake of the nature of Deity,
and not be subject to change. Really it is sur-
prising that such glaring inconsistencies should
ever be put forth by acute reasoners. For, first, it
must be evident, that mind is not
Deity, even
supposing it to be an emanation from God; it is
allied to mortality-it is no
longer good; it is

perverted from its original bias ; its operations are
carried on
through a material medium.
Vhat is known of mind, or of the laws which
govern it, to permit this mendacious assurance,
that it cannot admit of change? Absolutely no-
thing; only if this were
granted, it would be easy
to show that it did change; and that this change
was not inconsistent with its immateriality. As
far as we know the truth, it is, that mind is acted
upon by moral, spiritual motives, which we should
conceive calculated to produce such au effect. And
inasmuch as the nature of man is compounded, and
his spiritual agencies are
only perceptible through
a material medium, it is possible, probable, certain,
(as we shall presently show,) that the manifesta-
tions of mind are modified by a
perverling influence
which has passed upon them; by the health or
disease of the manifesting organ, and by many
other causes, acting immediately upon that organ,
or
intermediately through the agency of some
other bodily organ or function.
Those who have felt interested in obscuring this
question, have embarrassed it with a
variety of
presumed difficulties ; for instance, as to the period
when the immaterial principle is communicated,
and when it begins to exert its influence. Now it
is` easy, tor a
very limited understanding, to ask
questions which cannot be answered, and for the
best of all reasons, that there are questions beyond
the reach of philosophy. The present is one of
these curious, useless, unfathomable inquiries. We
cannot dive into the arcana of nature, beyond a

certain point; and it is perfectly unimportant to
determine, when the spirit is connected with
matter, or how it takes its origin. All we can
be required to show is, that there exists in nature
the same inscrutable working; operations whose
agency we cannot trace, and only know by their
effects.
Now can
any philosopher explain, why one
plant is an annual, a second biennial, and a third
perennial-one deciduous, another evergreen? Is
there any means of ascertaining these properties,
except by experience? And is there any method
of descrying, when and how this original law was
communicated? Can any one
explain, how the
little acorn becomes the monarch of the forest?
how the life which- it possesses becomes developed
by time, under the iniiuence of moisture? why it
has been provided with an
apparatus for taking up
that moisture, and for nourishing early and feeble
life, till it has been enabled, by its roots, to take up
its own nourishment? Still further, can
any one
explain, how flowers are
only seen
upon the tree
after a certain number of years, and how it is only
then that it becomes capable of bearing fruit?
Farther, can
any one explain, why one animal
is oviparous, another viviparous? Of the former,
can it be told /zow the developement of the embryo
chicken takes place under the favouring influence
of incubation, and why the process, if it once cease
after a
beginning of developement, ceases for ever,
and is incapable of renovation? Can any one
say
w/zen the principle of animal life is developed ? And,

to
go higher into the scale of animated nature,
can
any one
pretend to describe /zow the principle
of independent life is communicated to the human
ovum, and how the little homuncule is taken care
of, and gradually developed, with a
mysterious
power and wisdom of arrangement, which bafiles
human skill to conceive of, much more to describe
and to imitate?
But if this be the case in many' departments of
nature, (and instances might be almost indefinitely
multiplied,) is it fair to advance it as an
argument
against the spiritualist, that he cannot explain every
question which may be asked? It has been shown
that the naturalist cannot give an answer to much
simpler inquiries, and that he do`es not even know
the meaning of the terms he employs ; can it then
in fairness be asked of the spiritualistr to explain
that which by the supposition is less capable of
explanation, because we are still less acquainted
with spirit than with matter, while it presents no
properties which are obvious to the senses. But
if asked to explain that vhich is less obvious than
what the inquirer finds to be inexplicable, it is clear
that the advantage in argument rests on the side
of the spiritualist, who is only in the same
position
with his antagonist, on
_far more abstruse and dW-
cult questions.
Again, it has been objected against the imma-
terial doctrine, that in thought there is a
distinctly-
perceived motion about the brain; and, therefore,
that the chief mental phenomenon is obviously
characterized by a material movement. Now we

132 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
take leave to deny the fact in the first place, and
to assert, that, true, it would not prove the point
in question ; while the real facts of' the case prove
the contrary.
First, we
deny the fact : we admit that the brain
is conscious of thought--that it is conscious of being
the organ or instrument of' thought, but we
deny
the perception of' motion; first, because it cannot.
exist, and next, because the cerebral substance,
though capable of receiving its peculiar impressions
from without, or
communicating them from within,
in its own peculiar manner, is not in itsey' sensitive,
as is constantly shown by the extent of' disorganising
change which will go on in its fibres, without being
perceived.
If' it were true that this motion was
perceived,
it would not prove the materiality of' thought, but,
at the utmost, would only show, that when the
organ or instrument of` thought was excited into
action, such excitation was
accompanied by a
certain amount of consciousness of what was
going
on.
Such being the case, with the 12 priori reasoning,
we come to the question of' fact. Granting, then,
that there is a
"
perceived motion in the brain,"
it is fair to ask, by whom and by what is it per-
ceived? It has been shown that the cerebral fibre
itself is not an
easy percipient; and the truth is,
that the process of' thought, carried on
through
the medium of the brain as its instrument, is com-
municated to the immaterial mind; that it is per-
ceived by tlle brain as the organ of' mind; and

that its perceptions are
immediately referred to
some
higher governing principle, by which the
several phenomena of thought, comparison, rea-
soning, and reflection, are carried on; thus bring-
ing us back to, and supporting, our view ofthe
immateriality of the soul, by candidly weighing
the arguments against it.
This view is still further supported by the fact,
that impressions are sometimes made upon the
sensorium, which are not perceived at the time,
but which are recollected afterwards. Now if the
mind were simply brain, the impression made upon
it at the time would be perceived if sufliciently
impressive, or the impression would be made, but
not
powerfully enough to produce a
corresponding
perception. The fact is, that the impression is
made upon brain, and recognized by it; but the
mind which at that moment is abstracted or ab-
sorbed by other pursuits, does not attend to the
perception, and after a time comes round to it, as
to a recollected impression, just vividly re-excited
by attention to the impression previously made.
The eye, the ear, the brain, are all organs ot
the first importance for their respective functions;
still the eye is not sight, nor the ear
hearing, nor
does either sense
respectively reside in its ultimate
consciousness in the eye or the ear. Nor is thought
primarily developed in the brain--so that (as it
is contended) brain is thought. The fact is, that
all these are instruments onty, and not the individual
mind, which guides, and governs, and directs those
instruments.

134 'run itncirnocn, INFLUENCE
Once more, there are some mental phenomena,
which support the preceding argument; as, for
instance, the consciousness of each individual of
his own mental existence-a point which is
involved in the discussion on
personal identity, and
which is here only incidentally mentioned, for the
purpose of stating, that ideas are states or affections
of mind, communicated to the brain as the mate-
rials for thought, and not mind itsef but are
originated by it.
Thinking under the influence of the will, arrest-
ing and fixing the attention on the one hand, or
diverting it on the other, are so
many accumulative
proofs of presiding mind. These are not processes,
which are at all necessary to animal life ; they can
scarcely be called necessary to social man, so
perpe-
tually do we find him almost destitute of these im-
portant functions; so
perpetually do we find him
living without thought, exercising no control over
his actions, seeming not to desire to fix or to avert
his attention. But then these phenomena are
to he found where man is not fulfilling the great
end of his creation, viz. the display of the goodness,
wisdom, and glory of God.
But to intellectual, moral man-to man not so
much as he is, but as he ought to be, and as we
find him in the better specimens of our race, these
processes are
indispensable; he cannot live without
much thought and reading-without much reflec-
tion-without much reasoning-without the appli-
cation of his inferences to the emergencies of life-
without preparation for his wants and enjoyments-

or BODY AND MIND. 135
without looking forward beyond the present scene-
without aspirations after immortality -
without
ardent desire to seek, and to obtain, the rewards
promised to the good.
But if so, since it is clear that these manifesta-
tions do not
belong to his animal organisation, it
is equally clear, that they are the result and mani-
festation of that presiding mind, which, however
mysteriously it may be united with matter, and de-
pendent upon it for its manifestations, is still dis~
tinct from it, and will survive the wreck of that
which has been "
clothed upon
"
its spiritual func-
tions.
The presence and influence of presiding, directing,
_governing mind is further shown by instituting a
comparison between the actions of brain, when disso-
ciated from the judgment and will, and taken away
from its higher purposes, and the same actions when
judiciously employed under the direction of the will,
within the range of its own
peculiar oflrice, as the
servant of mind.
Thus, for instance, compare the self-actings
of the brain, in all the varieties of reverie, with
all its castle-building and follies, with all the base-
less fabrics of its own creation, and all the in-
tangible tissues of its wildest fancies; go one
step further, and compare .all the interminable
follies, and impossible situations, and absurd asso-
ciations of dreaming, and all the wild creations of
irritated structure, under the influence of alcoholic
excitement, or
opium, or fever; compare these,
which are
purely organic, with the real actings of

136 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
mind, in reasoning, feeling, knowing, inferring,
judging, and then see what the material brain is, as
the originator of trains of thought, and what it is
as the pure servant of mind, employed in the trans-
mission of thought, and always subjected to the con-
trol of the immaterial being.
But if in the one instance its actings be purely
animal and organic, and if, in the other, its mani-
festations are characterized by far higher attributes.
surely the inference is not to be avoided, that the
function of the brain is purely animal, when disso-
ciated frmn mind ; and that on the contrary, it
marks its high original, its present position in the
moral world, and its future hopes and future des-
tiny, so
long as it is under the guidance (fthe imma-
terial spirit.
Did we
require a further confirmation of this
truth, we should find it in the uneducated, the wil-
fully ignorant man-the creature of impulse-the
slave of animal passion-he who has in a
great mea-
sure discarded the influence of governing mind-
who exhibits human nature in a
rapidly-descending
series-acting under the influence of the brain and
bodily nerves, while the functions of the super-
added mind are
well-nigh suspended. Yet this
unhappy being is at length aroused from his degra-
dation by purely moral means-awakened by the
influence of the Holy Spirit of God-consciencc-
stricken-and finally restored to the favour of the
Most Iligh. With such facts of daily occurrence,
can the philosopher, the man of inductive habits,
doubt the presence of an immaterial principle,

energetic in its action upon the brain, and capable
not
only of controlling its perverse wanderings, but
also of producing an entire change of habits, and
pursuits, and desires, and purposes.
The agency of education, in its physical relation
to the brain, has been already noticed, and its in-
fluence upon the developement of all that is valu-
able in the moral and intellectual nature of man,
will presently claim our attention; so that in this
place we
only mention these facts as additional
proofs of the immateriality of mind, and of its
essential independence fy" brain, although that brain
is necessary for its manyfestation, so long as it re-
mains in close intimacy with the body.
'
We pass on, therefore, to notice the greater
numberof instincts, and the higherrange they occupy
in animals generally, when compared with the most
perfect animal, man. If there were no
compensat-
ing property in the latter; if there were no
supe-
rior advantage in his position, except that of his
living in society ; if there were nothing surpassingly
valuable in his destination, it were indeed extraor-
dinary, that the greatest degree of perfection
should have been given to the most helpless, the
most defenceless, the most feeble creature; that to
him alone should be given the least power of pre-
serving lifc; that upon him alone should be
entailed a mass-of infirmity and disease, of sickness
and sorrow, from which the rest of the creation is
comparatively exempt.
The truth is, that the more
sagacious animals
possess a far larger amount of instinct, or im-

parted knowledge, than man, because they have no
means of originating or
augmenting their stock
of ideas, by study, reflection, or otherwise; there-
fore it is necessary, to fulfil the wise designs of the
Creator, that they should inherit within themselves
all things necessary to their well-being; and it was
consistent with his perfect goodness and wisdom,
to render them free from the irgfirmities which at-
tend upon the higher creature: not (as we are in-
formed by Revelation) in consequence of his ori-
ginal position, which was
very good, but because he
has fallen from that high estate.
It would be perfectly irreconcilable with that
goodness, if man`s destiny were the same as other
animals; for then would he have had fewer advan-
tages, and far greater and overwhelming difhculties
and sorrows to contend with. But this apparent
deviation from perfection of design, and of will, is
quite reconciled by the fact, that the highest animal,
man, is gifted with a new
principle, which brutes
have not ; that to his material organisation is super-
added an immaterial principle, capable of supply-
ing the lack of instinct-enabling him, by reason
and knowledge, to meet the deficiencies of animal
force, constituting him a moral creature, fitting
him for residence in society, giving him the ma-
jesty of mind, placing him in a
position in which
he might, by proper conduct, secure his own
hap-
piness, and in a state of trial and probation during
which the attributes of mind should be developed,
and the spirit should be gradually prepared for that
future destiny of endless happiness, which would

equalize all apparent inequalities here, and vindi-
cate the present, by the hopes and prospects of the
future.
Another proof of the immateriality of the soul, is
to be found in one of those truths, inseparable from
the existence of man-which is to be found in every
man's bosom, but which, being self-evident, does
not admit of demonstration, viz. that consciousness
of thoughtful, responsible existence which he pos-
sesses. There is an internal feeling in the human
bosom, which speaks of something more than merely
animal life, and which by sceptical philosophers
has been termed "
le moi." We receive this term
with all thankfulness; we care not fbr the term,
but the admission of the thidg is all-important.
The admission that there exists within, le moi, a
principle of individual consciousness, distinct from
animal existence, is suflicient for the christian
philosopher, who well knows that le moi is neither
more nor less than the immaterial spirit.
When, in fact, the unprejudiced philosopher
compares his own actions with those of the highest
of the animal creation besides, he will perceive, that
in many of the processes of life he has a
precisely
similar standing; that in many others he is de-
cidedly inferior; and that his supremacy is only
maintained by the power which accrues to him
from his capacity of reniembering, comparing, ima-
gining, reflecting, reviewing, reasoning, judging,
in fact, thinking ; or, in other words, from the act-
ings of "
le moi "-the interior directrix of life,-
the immaterial spirit, which delights and revels in

a consciousness of its own existence, and which
feels that it cannot cease to exist.
We shall presently consider some of the pheno-
mena of life and death ; but here we have only to
notice, as connected with our consciousness of
thoughtful existence, the belief that this quality is
dependent not upon matter, but upon something
distinct from it, and which, though now
mysteri-
ously connected with the body, will survive the
dissolution of its present molecules; and upon this
wreck, will arise to its last stage of spiritual exist-
ence. One of our great bards has most feelingly
awakened this intuitive truth, in that touching
point ofCato's soliloquy,
"
This in a moment brings
me to an end-but this informs me I shall never
die." ,
So true is it, that at death there seems to be an
end of existence, because the mysterious union of
body and mind is rent asnnder; and the former
being no longer capable of continuing the manifes-
tations of the latter, the effects of its influence are
not to be traced upon that body; its life has
ceased; its present arrangement is about to be
dissolved, and its material particles will, many
of them, enter into new forms and combina~
tions, and will undergo changes which we cannot
fathom. But this is no
proof that the spiri-
tual existence is not continued; the servant has
performed his period of servitude; the compact
is at an end ; its particles may become obedient to
another will: but the master spirit remains the
samc. Having nothing in common with the body,

or BODY AND MIND. 141
it cannot be submitted to the same changes, since
the immaterial spirit claims for itself an
indepen-
dent life, and the right of governing and giving
laws to the body, and controlling and directing its
every action; so now, freed from its terrestrial
incumbrance, it escapes from the thraldom of matter,
and is free to enter upon a
congenial state of
existence; a
point at which we
stop in our investi-
gation, because, like many other objects of philoso-
phical knowledge, we have no
longera clue to guide
our
inquiries.
Lastly, we mention the intuitive desire after
immortality, the horror at the idea of annihilation,
and the ardent longing after a continued existence,
as a
strong indication of the immateriality of the
mind, because these are attributes which do not
belong to, but which are alien fiom, matter. The
love of life, and the desire to preserve it, are
instinctive ; they belong to man in common with
other animals, and are
totally distinct from that
longing after immortality, which we find in the
former only, and existing everywhere in proportion
as the man is more distinct from the animal-as he
is more intelligent-more intellectual-more moral
-more religious.
In connexion with this fact, there is a mistake
often made, and it is one of some
importance, be-
cause, if not founded in fact, it furnishes a
weapon to
the enemies of truth. It has been supposed, that
the body assists the spiritual principle in its
growth and preparation for this its final stage,
and therefore it has been very wrongfully as-

142 THE nEc|1'nocA1. INFLUENCE
serted, that the faculties of the mind ripen and
improve almost to the term of the body's ex-
tinction. And so no doubt they do; but not so
their manyfestation. For the manifesting organ is
subject to certain changes of structure, which pro-
duce a
very marked iniluence. Up to a certain
period of life, its aptitudes for carrying on the
mental functions, no doubt, continue to increase;
there is an
augmenting light, and accumulating
power of radiation. But this, too, has its zenith,
and the period of decay comes hastening on; the
views become more contracted, more assailable by
prejudice-the will is more
easily changed, though
sometimes exhibiting that selfish pertinacity, which
certainly increases as we pass through life; the
power of applicationiis lessened, as well as the
desire of acquisition; by degrees the judgment
fails, till the shadows of evening prevail, and pro-
claim that man is rapidly hastening to his long
night. The imbecility of old age, as a
general
rule, is proverbial; and when the contrary is re-
marked, it is the exception which confirms the
rule, and which shows the original strength of
conformation of the organ; a fact which we often
find elsewhere exemplified in the escape of other
organs from the general law of gradual exhaustion.
It is true, that this statement is sometimes
combated by an
appeal to facts, which do occa-
sionally appear to militate against its accuracy.
But this arises only from taking a
short-sighted
view; the influence Q" e.1'perience and accumulated
knowledge give an
appearance ry' power; whereas,

the two ideas must be entirely separated, and that
because, upon close investigation, it will be found
that they possess nothing in common. A good
memory, with correct association, and the early
habit of remarking, and comparing, and deriving
practical inferences from the circumstances, will
gradually produce such a store of ready and
useful knowledge, as will be mechanically, or
rather automatically,employed, long after the power
to select and to combine, and to compare, and to
infer, and to judge accurately, and to act ener-
getically, shall have ceased.
Thus the conversation and thejudgment of those
advanced in life will oftentimes be attractive and
valuable from their recollected stores, and from
the impressions and results of bygone days; whereas,
these very persons, if they were called upon to
work out new conclusions, or to consider new cir-
cumstances, will be found feeble, doubting, erro-
neous, vacillating, because distrustful of themselves.
This is more
obviously and remarkably seen, in
the state of the memory; it is quite proverbial,
that the recollection of the events of yesterday is
clouded and uncertain, whereas that of events
having happened many years since, is clear and
distinct. So with regard to other less cognisable
functions ; at the present day they are feeble; but
in so far as
they depend upon the stores of former
years, they remain strong and perfect. Thus,
therefore, mental power declines with advancing
years, not because the spiritual principle is losing
power, but that its long-occupied tenement is be-

144 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
coming less fitted for its spiritual occupant; that
the time is approaching, when the earthly house
of this tabernacle shall be dissolved, and when mor~
tality shall be swallowed up of life.
There is a marked proof of this fact, in all right-
minded and well-thinking persons, in the greater
prevalence of religious feeling. There is an ab
straction from the world, and all its joys and sor-
rows,--a feeling of their comparative nothingness-
a
sitting loosely by all the objects of present sense-
a truer estimate of life-a gradual estrangement
from those things which have greatly interested,
and a
preparation for that change of being, which
shall be, when the spirit is dissociated from the
body, and when, escaping from all the fetters of
this present life, it shall soar
away into ethereal
regions, better calculated for its final destiny.
If there be one attribute of Deity more strongly
demonstrated than another by natural religion,
it is that of Infinite justice, and goodness, and
mercy. In the great scale of creation, there isa
preponderating good, which is perfectly consistent
with partial or
apparent evil. If a creature be
feeble in one
point, it is compensated by another.
Sagacity may supply the place of strength, or vice
versa ; yet, upon the whole, it will be seen, that
the law of nature is to procure the largest amount
of good, and the largest amount of individual hap-
piness, which the circumstances admit-that is
thefullesl amount of individual enjoyment, which is
consistent with the well-being of the whole.
But there appears to be a remarkable exception

to this law in the history of man.
Though placed
in the highest range of animated existence, his
joys are less unalloyed-his sorrows
infinitely more
multiplied, than those of the inferior animals. As
his senses are less acute, it is probable that he has
far less pleasure, even from their proper indul-
gence, while that indulgence is limited by social
associations and moral laws. Add to this, the
amount of his sorrows and his sufferings; the
difficulty with which he procures the means of
subsistence-the burden of the long infancy of his
family--his liability to sickness, and pain, and suf-
fering,-his early dissolution! And when to this
is appended the catalogue of his mental sufferings,
from the constant conviction of his errors; from
the wanderings and misgivings of his own bosom ;
from his fallacious judgments; from his manifold
deviations from correct moral conduct, as
arising
from infirmity, or from the want of will to do
right; and all the miserics entailed by the passions
of an unsubdued heart, whether indulged or con-
flicted with; still further, add the amount of his
sufferings from the whips and scorns of time-from
the contumely of the world-from the selfishness
and heartlessness of compeers--from the estrange-
ment of friends-from the insincerity of those in
whom he has confided-from the injustice to which
he is constantly subjected-from the wounding of
his best feelings from a thousand exquisitely tender
sources; and, finally, throw into this scale the
amount of his sympathetic sorrows, with all the
misery, and crime, and hopelessness, and desola-

tion around him ; or with his more intimate
friends, when they are called upon to drink the cup
of sorrow-when they are invaded by disease, or
snatched from him by death; and it will be al-
lowed that his joys are few-his sufferings mani-
fold, as
compared with other creatures of far less
pretensions in the scale of being.
But if this be the case, and if it be allowed, that
the design of infinite mind in creation, was to pro-
mote the largest possible amount of happiness to
his creatures ; and, moreover, that that design
can never be wholly frustrated, though it may be
marred, and even for a time obscured and sus-
pended, then two consequences will follow; first,
that some perverting cause must have interfered
to prevent the completion of his original most per-
fect design; and secondly, that in order to obviate
this discrepancy- to equalize the apparent in-
equality in the distribution of rewards and punish-
ments here-and to vindicate the character of God,
as a God of love, and justice, and wisdom, and
power, and mercy, in this the highest work of his
creative hand, there must be some other state of
existence, in which the wrong will be set right-
the well-doer rewarded, and the evil-doer punished.
But since such a state does not exist on this side
the grave, there must be a continued existence be-
yond it; and if so, there must be some part of our
being, which will escape the dissolution of the
grave. This part cannot be material, because then
it would be liable to disorganisation-to existence
under many changes of form, and in many different

persons; and hence the necessity for the _fact of the
mind being immaterial-of the bofly being created
for it-subjected to its will-existing so
long as is
necessary for its purposes-and being then dis-
united, in order to fit it for that glorious change,
of which we know nothing, but that it will be one
of happiness.
Another proof of this immateriality of mind, and
of the necessity for this final equalising change,
will be found in the present state of that mind.
If we look to its aspirations after knowledge-to
the diliiculties with which it is encompassed-and
to the arrest of its progress on
every side, after a
certain length of investigation, one thing is clear,
that the mind was
originally intended for higher
flights; there is a constant sighing and sorrowing
after greater attainments ; and because such higher
reach is rendered impossible, by the cumbrous ma-
terial vehicle through which all its actions are mani-
fested, there is also an internal consciousness, that
this is not its best state--that it is hindered by
the body-and that that hody is less subservient
than it should be to the mind.
If we
carry our view still onward to its moral
condition-if we
perceive its greater tendency to
evil than good-that when we would do good, evil
is ever
present with us-that the heart revolts from
yielding obedience to God, and prefers following
the suggestions of its own
waywardness; that its
natural love of virtue is lost--that there is no ab-
horrence of vice, but that, on the contrary, her
attractions are most seductive, and can
only be

148 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
resisted by principle; when we see how easily the
mind is overturned by disease, led astray by pas-
sion, or
perverted by designing hypocrisy, we are
fain to allow, that its powers are diminished by its
alliance with the body-that its tendencies are
corrupted--that a
debasing change has passed upon
it-and that this wrong can
only be set right in a
future state, which again brings us round to the
conclusion of the immateriality of mind, and to the
necessity of another state of existence.
A few remarks on this state will appropriately
close the present section. It is not proposed to treat
this subject at large, or to meet and grapple with
infidel objections against it-but only to notice in-
cidentally so much as
may be necessary to com-
plete the discussion which has occupied the pre-
ceding pages.
One position maintained, has been, that the spirit
of man is immaterial, and that it is allied to ma-
teriality, only so
long as is necessary to complete
its period of probation here, which is to fit it for
continued existence hereafter. But supposing for
one moment, that the spirit of man were material,
it is perfectly possible that there might be a con-
tinued existence after death; for, although we do
not rightly comprehend how particles of matter,
dissociated by putrefaction, and then entering into
other combinations, should be so far preserved, as
to retain their consciousness of identity ; yet it
were absurd, and contrary to all sound reasoning,
to say that this was
impossible to the Omnipotent ;
or that the Almighty Creator of the universe could
e".

or BODY AND MIND. 149
not re-create so much of the body as should be
necessary to maintain its identity. Possibility, pro-
bability even, is not to be measured by OUR /mow-
ledge of cause and effect, -for there are
many effects
which we cannot trace to their cause, and many
causes of which we know nothing but by their
effects: and in nature there are
many causes and
effects producing constant changes, or
maintaining
existing order, of which we /mow not even their
existence.
But if such be the case-and our
ignorance of
many apparently simple circumstances around us
be so
great; is it not the highest effort of presump-
tion to limit the power of Cmnipotence in this
department of his universal government, because
we cannot trace the footsteps of tl1e Most High?
In the immaterial view of this subject, we find
the question perplexed, with almost as
many difii-
culties, at least to those who seek to know more
than it has pleased God to explain, and to draw
aside the veil which has been drawn over the
arcana of some of nature's processes. In associat-
ing the continued existence of the soul with the
revealed doctrine of the resurrection of the body,
the question very naturally presents itself, with what
kind of body will the soul be re-united? It is a
question we cannot answer. All we know is, that
as there can be no annihilation of matter, so the
spiritual part of man, being less liable to change
than that which is material, its continued existence
is more
easily comprehended, even
by our measure
of knowledge; and the inquiry as to the kind of

body which shall be fitted for its future existence
seems to be more than unnecessary; all we
really
have reason to believe is, that the change will
be one of great purity and excellence; and that
the future body will be better calculated for the
manifestation of all the intellectual and affective
faculties.
Nor is this change more wonderful than that
which we have already instanced as
taking place
in the insect tribe, in the several stages of their
transformations; nor, indeed, more wonderful, nor
more incomprehensible, than changes which take
place in the history of man's own eventful life.
For, to say nothing of the perfectly inscrutable
process through which his life is first developed, we
shall notice only the change which takes place in
one instant in the distribution of the blood through
varied channels.
In intra-uterine life, the future man has possessed
only a kind of vegetable existence, and his organs
have been calculated precisely for this state. But
no sooner has the respiratory function been stimu-
lated by the first access of air; no sooner has the
first cry proclaimed the commencement of inde-
pendent existence, and of animal life, than the
channels of the original circulation become closed-
the lungs enter into their newly-developed action-
the animal has now to breathe for itself--to nourish
itself--to maintain its own
temperature,-in fact,
to perform the functions of animal life, which it
had not done previously.
This change, dependent upon an
original law of

nature, but produced by the stimulus of air to the
respiratory organs, is not more or less wonderful
than would be such a
change upon this body as
shall free it from its infant incumbrances, and
shall enable it to exist in the pure atmosphere of
heaven, and to lead a
spiritual life in the presence
of its God.
Such final alteration, as it has been already said,
is rendered necessary by the inequality in the dis-
tribution of the goods of fortune in this world ; and
it becomes still more
imperative from the insufii-
ciency of this present state to fill the desires of the
mind. Vhatever may be the developement of in-
tellect; whatever may be the literary advantages;
whatever may be the growth of the affections ;
however they may be deeply-rooted in family con-
nexions and the purest earthly friendship; and
however they may be expanded upon HIM who is
Love; still it is manifest, from the increasing dissa-
tisfaction with the things of the world, that this is not
our rest, that here we have no
abiding city, but that
we seek one to come-a state in which there shall
be fulness of joy at the right hand of God.
Were it not thus, how impenetrably gloomy
would be the bed of death ; how unmitigated would
be the sorrow of survivors ; how exquisitely poignant
would be their grief; how unredeemably acute
would be their sufferings! Witlmout the hope
of an hereafter, how infinitely preferable the
state of the mere animal who dies unregretted, and
over whom the tear of separation is never shed!
llow exquisitely painful would be the pillow of

sickness, conducting to the hour of dissolution,
without one
ray of hope beyond it, without one
beam of eternity to shed its 'radiance upon the
coming night; with nothing but gloom-a dark-
ness that might be felt-a darkness that enwraps
intellectual, social, moral, religious, and spiritual
man, in the destitution of returning to his earth
without one
hope, one
joy, one
longing after im-
mortality!
The misery of parting with those whom we have
loved is great indeed, under' the best of circum-
stances; but how immeasurably greater if this
parting were
for ever-if there were no distant pro-
spect of re-union! For ever! how awful the reality,
when the grave has closed upon the remains of
those most dear to us! For ever! O no, this
never can be, that the lot of man should have been
rendered infinitely worse than that of the brute
creation, while /ze alone wears the image of God,
while he is evidently God's highest and most per-
fect work, and while he has been created by a
God of infinite justice and benevolence, of un-
spotted holiness, of him who delighteth in mercy,
and who "
is Love!"
Conscience is peculiar to the human mind:
nothing analogous with it exists in the inferior
animals; and, indeed, from its nature, it manifestly
belongs only to a creature accountable for his
actions, since to none other would it be important
to pass a
judgment upon its own acts, and thoughts,
and words. And as an attribute of mind, not pos-
sessed by brutes, it forms a
proof of the existence

of that superadded iinmaterial spirihwhich consti-
tutes the great difference between man and the
lower animals.
Conscience, then, is a kind of instinctive moral
faculty, which passes judgment upon conduct,
whether right or wrong ; which forms the terror of
the wicked by its upbraidings, and haunts him
night and day with the fearfulness of discovery,
and the apprehension of the Divine anger; while
to the good its approving smiles support him in
adversity; conscious rectitude will enable h_im to
brave the evils and injustice of time, to rise supe-
rior to all the tauntings of this world's ingrati-
tude, to bear to be thought and spoken ill of, to
submit to have his words and actions misinter-
preted, and to be carried buoyant through all the
difficulties of life. Vhere is to be found any ana-
logous principle, elsewhere than in rational, moral,
spiritual man ?
Conscience is independent of education, though
it may be improved by culture. It is discoverable
with the earliest developement of mind ; as
soon as
a child knows right from wrong, it will pass sen-
tence on its own actions, and the countenance will
frequently betray the little offender ; while, in after
life, the crimson glow of shame, and the altered
features, will often tell the torturing monitions of
this interior judge, and will reveal even those
thoughts of the heart which are
scarcely ac-
knowledged by the individual to himself
A still stronger proof of the power of conscience
is to be found in the fact, that the very idea of

154 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
being thought wrong, or of having one's actions
misconstrued, or even the recollection of those
embarrassing circumstances which have previously,
though unjustly, produced
"
confusion of face,"
will renew that confusion, and will throw over the
countenance the appearance of inexplicable blush-
ing. This fact shows the great injustice which
may be done to the most innocent, and the
care which should be taken not to judge from ap-
pearances, than which nothing can be more
decep-
tive, though they strongly illustrate the power of
the faculty.
Conscience is possessed in various degrees by
different individuals: thus, there may be a tender
conscience in one, a hardened conscience in ano-
ther, an
unenlightened conscience in a third, a
stifled conscience in a fourth, a
scrupulous con-
science in a fifth, a
capricious conscience in a sixth,
and a fitful conscience in a seventh. And these
differences are
mainly dependent on the kind of
education the individual has received, and the de-
gree in which the voice of conscience has been
fostered or
opposed, the frequency with which it
has been listened to or disregarded, and the in-
fluence of habit in rendering more obtuse or acute
its sensibility.
That conscience will be the soundest which
exists in a mind strong by nature,-one which has
been enlarged by study, which has been imbued
with just principles of moral and religious action,
which has been accustomed to review its own deci-
sions, and to weigh them in the balance of good, as

or BODY AND MIND. 155
connected with the wants of society and the laws of
God; and which has habitually referred every
portion of conduct, not to the feeling and inclina-
tion of the moment, but to the immutable principles
of truth. Thus will conscience be uniform in its
awards; it will be tender without being irritable;
it will be firm without sternness; unyielding with-
out obstinacy; and consistent in every society,
amidst the approving smiles of friends or the
frowns of enemies,-proof against the shafts of
ridicule, and the still more
diflicultly-resistible
weapon of persuasion from those whom we love,
and admire, and esteem.
It is evident, from all this, that conscience must
attach to spiritual existence, and, consequently,
must form a
proof of the immateriality of mind;
and its perversions, its want of regularity, its ap-
parent assumption for sinister purposes, are all so
many proofs of some
perverting agency having
passed upon this originally good principle. Thus,
the conscience becomes hardened by a
long course
of inattention to its strivings with man; it is un-
enlightened in those who willingly are
ignorant of
the moral code laid down for their guidance; it is
stifled by others, who, persisting in a course of evil,
in opposition to their better judgments, must
silence its uneasy warnings, in order to save them-
selves from the constant gnawing of bitter reflec-
tion ; it is scrupulous in those, who,attending more
to the appearance of conduct before man, than to
the reality of the principles from which it springs,
are
everywhere afraid to act, lest others should

156 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
think them wrong, and thus too generally lose the
opportunities for action, while they are debating
the fruitless question of what others think of them ;
it is capricious in those who, having no settled
principles of action, will act, or abstain from action,
under very similar circumstances, and without
having a
good reason to give for either course of
conduct; it is figful in those who will be very con-
scientious to-day, and relax their principles to-
morrow, according to some
change in their cir-
cumstances or associations; and it is often counter-
feited by those who know that reason, and principle,
and goodness, will be the best passport to certain
advantages, and who really assume the appearance
of this invaluable possession, in order that they
may pass in the rank of friendship with those
others who sincerely wish to do their duty to God
and their neighbour.
Now, where will there be found any approach to
the existence and influence of such faculty except
in man, in whom is superadded the spiritual prin-
ciple which is destined to survive the wreck of his
organisation? It may be safely answered, No-
where. But if so, it follows that man
possesses an
unique principle superadded to his other common
and ordinary mental manifestations-distinct from
them, and belonging to him only, because he is a
moral creature, and an heir of immortality.
The soul,-the principle which animates and re-
gulates, which guides, directs,modifies, and governs,
all the intellectual and affective faculties, and upon
which many of the purely bodily functions are more

or less dependent,-is in itselfdistinctfrom, and in-
dependent zf any organised system of matter.
A distinction has been here drawn, which it is
necessary to notice, because error in principle very
frequently proceeds from admitting ineligible terms;
these become current, and afterwards carry with
them significations which, perhaps, the original
employer never intended they should convey.
Thus, a distinction has been made between the
mind of MAN, which, in fact, (divested of all the
obscurity purposely thrown upon the subject,)
means the brain, representing the organ of which
"mentation" is the function, and that which is termed
the "
theological soul."
Now if this term were employed to represent the
principle which in man, as a rational, moral, account-
able being, is superadded to the mind of the highest
order ofall other animals, there would be no
objection,
and we
might rise from the first developement of the
nervous
system, where there was no locomotion or
volition in the ascending scale of animalisation, till
we found a more
perfectly developed brain, and
with it the power of volition, locomotion, affection,
and a
something very analogous to
thought and
reason, with acute sensation and largely developed
instincts: and this we
might callmind.
But this most perfect creature does not possess
rational motive or reflective action; is not con-
scientious; acts from impulse; is not restrained
by religious principle; does not understand the
habit of self-denial; does not anticipate future
consequences; is not responsible for its conduct;

158 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
possesses not the sanction of human laws, social in-
stitutions, moral teaching, or divine revelation.
Therefore, in man there is a
principle superadded,
to which all these are traceable, and from which
they emanate; and this principle is the rational,
accountable soul, which constitutes man a
religious
animal, and which forms the bond of union and
connexion with his Maker, even the omnipotent
Governor of the universe; which receives his laws,
bows to his commands, and obeys his will, unless
previously alienated from proper dependence upon
God. So far, then, as
representing the immediate
connexion between man and his Maker, through
his rational soul, we would not object to the term
"
theological soul."
But inasmuch as the term has been covertly
employed by those who believe man to be only a
superior animal, endued with a more
comprehen-
sive nervous
system ; that brain being of the same
nature, but capable of more extensive action, being
itself the seat of thought; its function being that
of performing the various intellectual, affective,
sensitive, and passionate actions of the body, and
terminating there ;-man being, in fact, precisely
what his organisation makes him; and all the in-
stitutions of society, all the laws of man, all the
appointments of a christian country, being only so
many incumbrances to freedom of action, and
having no basis in truth or
necessity; it becomes
us
very narrowly to watch over the term, since,
although it may be employed by many sincere
philosophers to represent the affinity between the

soul and its Creator, or the soul which is fitted and
destined for the study, the belief, and the practice
of theology, as revealed to man
by his Maker, yet
it is also employed by many pseudo-philosophers as
a convenient term to enable them to escape the
odium of denying the existence of a
responsible
soul, and avowing atheism at once. But with these
gentlemen it is employed to designate the soul of
theologians; a
nonentity with which they have
nothing to do, but which, for the convenience of
their craftiness, it is desirable not to deny.
Now, it is obvious, that it cannot be a matter of
indifference, whether we
employ terms of so doubt-
ful a construction, that they admit of being em-
ployed as truth, and yet may be rendered available
for the propagation of the most cruel error; and,
therefore, we
strongly recommend the friends of
truth and humanity to abjure a
phraseology so
questionable, and to substitute soul only to repre-
sent the spiritual part of man; to represent that
which makes him to differ from all other
animals; which makes him ruler over all those
animals;-and more than all, ruler over
himself;
-which teaches him to subdue his inclinations, to
love others better than himself, to exert himself in
works of benevolence towards his fellow-men, and
of piety towards God.
It has been stated, that this soul is spiritual in its
nature; and that while it is allied with matter, and
possesses matter for its servant and -its organ,--its
medium of communication between exterior and
interior life ; yet that it is not a
quality of' matter,

that it exists independent of matter; and that it is
distinct from any arrangement of nervous fibre of
whatever kind, however simple or
complicated,
however refined or sublimated.
As such, the soul is exempted in itself from all
the changes of disorder, disease, decay, and death,
so far as these are natural changes, operating upon
bodily organisation. There are
spiritual changes
of growth, disorder, decay, death, renewal of life,
&c.; but all these do not come within our
pro-
vince. All we have to notice, is the way in which,
not the soul itsem but its manifestations, are influ-
enced, assisted on the one hand, or
impeded on the
other; quickened or rendered obtuse; perfected or
perverted, through the instrumentality of causes
and circumstances, which operate indirectly upon
spiritythrough the agency fy" its material organ.
As these will come under our notice more parti-
cularly in a
subsequent part ofour inquiry, we shall
but glance at them in the present section. Let it
be remarked, that these agencies are carried on
invisibly; that they cannot be demonstrated ; and
yet, that the experience of all the thinking part of
mankind has shown their influence to an extent so
great, as not to escape the observation of any mode-
rately accurate observer of himself.
There are times when a state of unconquerable
and unwonted sleepiness claims the supremacy,
and forbids the student from continuing his pur-
suits. It is frequently difficult to trace the"cause
of this oppression, and it often baflles every attempt
at removal. During its persistence, the continuity

of thought is impossible; the brain is disobedient ;
it is contumacious, and its contumacy is carried on
into successful rebellion against the authority of
its ruler. This state may sometimes be removed
by medicinal agents, as tea, coffee, ammonia, wine,
&c.; but there are
periods, when nothing will
succeed. And this condition has a
tendency to
recur, perhaps for several successive nights, until
the chain of morbid actions can be broken through.
The influence of digestion upon the manifesta-
tions of mind, is also considerable. During its
progress, the nervous
energy is accumulated about
interior life; there is a
tendency to sleep; and if
not, there is no
energy ofcerebral manifestation; and
during this time, 'the brain should never be called
upon for intellectual action. The two functions
cannot go on
actively, and at the same time com-
fortably together; intellectual pursuits should be
carried on when the stomach is unemployed ; and
the stomach should not be asked to conductthe
digestive process, while the brain is busied with
other objects of interest, emotion, or
occupation.
Vhen any morbid condition of the stomach occurs,
any temporary indigestion, then happens that
distress to the brain, which renders it unfit for
abstraction, or tbr any study of the severer kind.
To these causes of disturbance might be added,
atrnospherical influence, as regards temperature,
pressure, dryness, or
dampness, &c.; but we will
not anticipate the observations to be made hereafter
upon this subject.

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
other feature which attaches to the mental mani-
festations of man, viz. continued progression, at least
till the organ begins to give way,--a property so
totally distinct from any possessed by the lower
animals, that it forms a
very remarkable preroga-
tive of his nature.
Man's history is that of continued progress.
Whereas the young of animals generally, nay,
infinitely surpass him in the amount of their im-
parted knowledge; and therefore do at once what
he could not do, even after a
long course of instruc-
tion; yet they remain the same; they have no
means of augmenting their knowledge; for reason
and experience, rational experience, are thrown
away upon them: and while their original know-
ledge is greater, and the accuracy and extent of
their senses infinitely greater than his, yet they
never get beyond that amount of information
which is necessary to their conservation; they
never
apply their first principles to new situations,
but remain unchanged, while the essential cha-
racter of man is that of constant change-constant
progression : he is never contented to remain in one
state; he is conscious that nature has given him
nothing except as a reward for his labour; and that
to that labour, she has attached a rich progress in
intellect and virtue; and that the former may be
carried on till the brain begins to wear out, while
the latter will be always improving, especially in
proportion as he draws near to that better land,
whither he is tending.

CHAPTER V.
ON THE ESSENTIAL LAW OF PROGRESSIVE DEVE-
LOPEMENT ENSTAMPED UPON THE CHARACTER
OF INTELLECTUAL MAN.
IN our own
country, as well as in the greater
part of Europe, education has claimed for itself,
during the last few years, such a
degree of increas-
ing attention, and has been followed by such a dis-
play of augmented intelligence, that each year has
widened the sphere of its operations, and has pre-
sented for the mental husbandry, a soil more
appropriate for the reception of the intellectual and
moral seeds, as well as better calculated for their
gradual developement and final maturity.
From the very nature of the human mind, this
distinctive characteristic will be more and more
deeply marked, since it is essentially progressive;
and since, although it may blossom on earth, and
be continually reaching onward towards perfection,
the perfect fruit is only to be gathered in that
ethereal region, where the faculties of the imma-
terial soul shall have escaped the burden of mor-

tality, and shall be expanded in their final state of
spiritual existence.
It is remarkable, that the flame which was first
kindled on the altar of individual charity, should
have awakened a
corresponding emotion wherever
its agency has been felt ; so little can it be calcu-
lated how far the exertions of one, may, by associ-
ation, become ultimately productive of effects, far
beyond the expectation of an
original projector.
No widely-spread and devastating conflagration
has marked the advance of the light and heat
which have been thus developed; they have en-
lightened without scorching; they have warmed
without consuming; and they have relaxediwithout
enfeebling. The domain of intellect has been
enlarged, while it has been subjected to the will;
the emotions of the heart have been cherished,
while the wild governance of the passions has been
subdued; and prejudice has been softened, while
principle has been confirmed; so that man has
been continually becoming a more
intelligent, a
more reasonable, and a more moral creature.
Would that we were not obliged to reverse the
picture; that we could believe education to have
produced unmixed good-good without alloy. But
truth compels us to say, that, like many other
terrestrial goods, it possess a mixture of evil, and
that too of' a somewhat fearful character. VVith
the developement of intellect has arisen aconscious
self'-sufficiency, an
over-weening love of personal
importance, an impatience of control, a dislike of

166 THE P.Ec1PRocAL INFLUENCE
submission to wholesome restraint, an under-
valuing of authority, a
setting up of lawless incli-
nation, as the supreme rule of ultimate appeal, a
sacrifice of relative, social, and governmental ties
upon the altar of individual caprice, and of a
fashionable ultra-liberalism, which spurns at con-
trol, disdains the reference to first principles, which
can alone ensure correct conduct, and plunges at
once into that anti-social system, in which man
lives to himsem becomes the lawgiver to
himsem
and refers to himseif and his wishes, as the standard
of right and wrong. Thus a
growing contempt of
.authority may be said to be the characteristic of
our
age. But this is an evil, which, though it
covyfessedly detracts from that which otherwise
would have been unmixed good, yet by no means
destroys that good, or so
perverts it as to render
evil predominant.
The good on the one hand, and the evil on the
other, together with the conviction that the one
may be increased, while the other is diminished,
will lead us to state the indispensable necessity of
attending to the inculcation of those first principles
qfaction, without which, education can
only be, at
best, a
longer or a shorter series of constitutional
impulses, unharmonized by one master principle,
unchastised by the modesty of true science, and
unprepared to meet and combat with the difficul-
ties of the way. The progress of mental develope-
ment is a talent, which will become useful or
mischievous, in proportion as the presiding mind,

which guides its agency, shall be imbued with just
opinions, of its immediate objects, and ultimate
destination.
In order to render this developement successful,
it is necessary to take enlarged views of its oyect,
as well as of its sulject. Man is not a
simple piece
of mechanism, governed by fixed laws, whose
movements will remain harmonious, so
long as a
certain number of wheels and other similar con-
trivances continue to act according to a
prescribed,
and necessarily unvarying plan, and so
long as
these remain subjected to the common
agency of a
medium atmospherical pressure. Neither is he a
simple animal, a certain finer and more compli-
cated machinery, whose attributes depend upon
his organisation, and result from the harmonizing
principle of life, superadded to this organic machi-
nery, the creature of appetites and passions, of
instincts and impulse. Nor is /ze finally a
spiritual
being, of whose mode of existence we can form but
a
very imperfect idea, and of whose essence we
must remain perfectly ignorant; a
being wholly
abstracted from the laws of animal nature, and
incapable of being acted upon, except through the
medium of intellectual and moral means.
In fact, man is not an automaton-a simple
animal-nor an
unearthly being; his instincts are
few and feeble; he is gifted with reason and re-
flection, to guide and govern his purely animal
propensities; the manifestations of his mind are
enlarged, and he possesses the highest moral sanc-
tions for his control. Moreover, he has the power

168 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
of determining his own will; and yet this will
depends for its firmness and perseverance upon the
healthy condition of the body in general, and upon
the integrity of the brain in particular.
Thus, then, to seek for mental developement in
man, as a
spiritual being only, would be to secure
as
signal a failure, though not with so
fatally in-
jurious a result, as
forgetting altogether the im-
material spirit, to address the exclusive attention
to corporeal manifestations.
Although it is true that the immaterial principle
cannot be subjected to the processes of growth and
decay--of health and disease-of tension and re-
laxation-of tone and feebleness; yet it is equally
true, that the manifestations of _mind can
only be
recognized through the medium of bodily organisa-
tion, and that these manifestations may be variously
modified by the changing conditions of the cor-
poreal organs, through which they are rendered
apparent. Hence in a mind unaccustomed to dis-
tinctions, the bodily mode may be confounded with
the spiritual essence; and error in judgment, if not
more serious practical mischief, will be the con-
sequence.
This view of the su@ect for the process of mental
developement, defines the real nature of its o@ect,
viz. to confer the greatest possible degree of ex-
pansion upon the successive manifestations of mind,
-to carry onward its every faculty to the highest
reach of perfection-to procure the health of the
body; gradually to accustom it to bear without
irritation a still greater frequency and energy of

intellectual association ; and to recollect, that, as
a moral and responsible creature, man
requires to
be strengthened in all that is good, and coun-
teracted in evil propensities-to have his passions
subdued-his vices restrained, and the pure prin-
ciples of moral action placed before him, and
inwrought into every part of his character, so as
to obtain the nearest possible approach to what
he was
originally pronounced to be by Ommlscience,
viz. very good!
Thus, then, the olject of mental developement
may be defined to be, the closest attainable ap-
proximation to the perfection of an
ignorant crea-
ture, which necessitates the _
zealous pursuit of
intellectual acquisition; and also, to the perfection
of a
dependent creature-dependent upon others
during the first years of his existence; dependent
upon the body for the manyiestation of his higher
faculties, and dependent upon the Almighty Giver
of all good, for his moral principles and virtues,
and for the sanctions by which they are enforced.
lt is of great importance to watch the combined
agency of these elements of mental character; to
trace the gradual recession of the instinctive night
of infancy, as the day of reason dawns, and unfolds
to our notice the several faculties of the spiritual
mind; to distribute and associate these according
to a classification which shall facilitate our ac-
quaintance with man, and then to hail the rising
of that sun of perception, whose reflected beams
can alone enable us to explore _the nature and
habits of the individual-his peculiar manifesta-

tions-his intellectual aptitudes-his moral prin-
ciples-his religious duties and obligations; and
let it never be forgotten, that not only will the
meridian of life be characterized by these early
efforts, but that the evening of our
days will close
in gloom, or it will exhibit the mellowed tints of
a
departing summer's day, together with that
peaceful and unruffled calm, which can arise only
from the hushing to repose of the elemental storms
of passion; while this organ must depend upon
the powerful agency of a
controlling freedom of
will, guided, governed, subdued, originated even,
by the soft whisper of religious truth.
Thus, then, it will be seen that intellectual cul-
ture alone will be insufficient to form the character
in all its length, and breadth, and strength, and
depth of manifestation. Man does not live in a
world of intellect; his time is not to be exclusively
devoted to the luxury of thinking, and to receiving
or communicating the stores of genius. Far other-
wise! He is virtually placed on earth as a social
being; he has relative duties to perform; his
talents have been conferred upon him, not merely
as a source of selfish enjoyrnerzt, but as the means
and instruments of usefulness, and of happiness
to others.
For the use he makes of these talents, he is
deeply responsible; and he is placed in such a
scene of trial and probation, as that moral good or
evil will assuredly result from their cultivation,
their neglect, or their abuse. It is not permitted

lectual attainment, social good, relative duty,
gentlemanlike feeling, or moral influence, while
there remains an attainable point in advance upon
any one, or
upon all of these routes; while there
can yet be found on earth one individual to instruct,
to comfort, to protect, to please, or to improve;
or while there exists virtue to love and to esteem-
a God to serve and to obey-or a future state of
rewards and punishments.
Every process of mental improvement should
have a direct or indirect reference to this final
developement of spiritual life; or it will fail of
accomplishing its purpose; and in the' present
age, a man must be a virtuous character, a
philan-
thropist, and a Christian, as well as a scholar and
a
philosopher; or the exterior tinsel of letters and
of wisdom will be tarnished by selfishness, pre-
judice, and bigotry-the lustre of the human mind
will be eclipsed, and society will retrograde into
that original chaos, when it was without form and
void.
To secure this advantage, the heart, that is, the
manifestation of feeling and passion, of virtue and
vice, must be carefully studied. And that success
may be obtained from this study, it must ever
be recollected, that however these principles must
result from spiritual motives and affections, still
they must remain as unknown and inoperative,
unless there was
provided some medium of com-
munication with exterior nature. This medium
must of necessity be material and organic ; and as
such, will be subjected to the common laws of

172 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
animal life, to be improved by exercise, to be en-
feebled by inaction, and to be destroyed by giving
an undue preponderance to the influence of certain
other bodily organs, which, but for great caution,
may very grievously interfere with and impede
the mental functions.
This proposition may, perhaps, at first sight,
appear startling to those who would contemplate
only the spiritual nature of man ; but its truth will
appear by reflecting, that man cannot even
express
his feelings except by signs and gestures; that he
cannot speak or write, without the harmonious
influence of bones and muscles and nerves; all
of them so
indubitably material, that we can never
cease to admire the unknown contrivance which
renders these material organs the willing servants
of the_ spiritual principle.
It follows, then, that to afford opportunities for
the range of moral action ; to develope intellectual
nptitudes, to foster good, and to repress evil
propensities, and to exercise and improve the
organs by which these manifestations are rendered
sensible, are the first objects of mental culture.
Moreover, in this pursuit, constant improvement
or progression is the talisman by which the shafts
of evil are to be blunted and rendered innocuous,
and the tender shoots of virtuous action are to be
protected and fostered. Man must not be suffered
to grow up as a mere
amplification of the child, in
all its waywardness and selfishness, in all its paucity
of attainment, with all its faults exaggerated, with
all its ill-regulated desires, and all its augmented

passions. The human heart will have been studied
for nought, and will have been impressed in vain,
unless it be improved ; unless the temper he amelio-
rated; unless the disposition be raised, and puri-
fied, and ennobled, and sanctified; and unless the
peace and activity of the spiritual principle be
ensured. ~
This is not to be effected at once, as if by some
creative power; the great object to be constantly
kept in view is that the present state of mental ma-
nifestation has resulted from the years that are
past, and should be a
preparative for those which
are to come. r
In this process of mental developement there is
a sort of moral and intellectual growth, a
species of
mtywwtg, or
production of part upon part, even
nature`s modelling process, which the mental culti-
vator would do well to imitate; for according to
the beauty and aptitude of the motives, principles,
and sentiments which /ze fosters, so will be the
consecutive motives, and principles, and sentiments
which will arise from their incorporation with the
character; and from their thus forming points
for the commencement and carrying on future
moral growths.
There is, however, this difference, that whereas
in animal and vegetable productions there isa point
at which growth is arrested, a short-lived maturity
is enjoyed, and the .process of gradual decay com-
mences, there is no such limit to mental expansion ;
every renewed acquisition is an earnest of more
growth ; and it can never be said that the mind is

174 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
perfect until it has been abstracted from life, and
even then, we know not but that its spiritual cha-
racter of progression may cleave to it, and that its
higher powers will be constantly advancing by
exercise, and developing by accessions of new and
more extensive knowledge.
Be this as it may, mental progress in good or
evil now will be incessant; the mind must have
food, and it will grow; the grand question for the
mental and moral philosopher is, whether it shall
be furnished with wholesome nutriment or with
poison; whether its advance shall consist in the
lurid luxuriance ofthe deadly nightshade of selfish-
ness, or in the unobtrusive but fruit-bearing blade,
which will issue in a
crop of genuine principles of
sterling value.
But it may be asked, Hov is the attainment of
this great good to be secured, if it be opposed to
the natural current of the passions and inclinations,
-if it contravene, as it most assuredly does, the
natural perversity of the human will,-if it do not
consist in the simple developement of intellect, nor
in the growth of the affections; and while it is
interminably hostile to every species of ignorance,
as well as to all the charlatanism of systematic
education?
This end is to be accomplished only by the
education of principle-of principle which will be
available under all the changing circumstances of
life; which will afford a
guide for the application
of intellect; which will give laws to the passions,
and regulate the heart; which will oontrol the

wanderings, and define the just boundaries of the
imagination ; which will give energy and wisdom
to the affective faculties, shall become a
primary
motive to action, and shall direct every the min utest
portion of conduct. It is genuine princqnle alone
which can afford a sufficient sanction to the require-
ments of virtue, or
give security for their just appli-
cation in life; or
upon which character can be
safely formed, since it must be everywhere pre-
eminent, or it is absolutely void; since to it nothing
can be unimportant, nothing indifferent, while every
thing must tend to advance or to impede that
progressive march towards perfection, which forms
the only worthy pursuit of a rational and immortal
creature.
This principle can only be found in religion-a
term by many misunderstood, and by others de-
rided and calumniated, but which may be shortly
defined to consist in obedience to the command-
ments of God ; not in any visionary or enthusiastic
system of belief, but in the pure precepts of simple
Christianity. Without this principle to
purify and
ennoble the heart, time, and a residence amidst
the contentions of society, would impair, instead of
improving the moral sense, and would debase,
rather than ennoble the intellectual attributes.
Wanting this foundation, it would be futile to
expect that any process of mental training would
place the young in a situation favourable to their
fulfilling one
day the destination of their existence,
because the object propounded by religion consists
in the practical desire after the greatest possible

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
share of happiness here in the acquisition of know-
ledge and the performance of duty; and having
passed through this probationary scene, hereafter,
in the fruition of rewards which are reserved for
those who have so lived, in the performance of
duties, with just views, and from proper motives.
It is necessary to make a distinction between
happiness and pleasure; the latter may arise from
a
variety of sources, which will not only not confer,
but which are
absolutely inirnical to the former;
while happiness will accrue from many circum-
stances which are
incapable of imparting pleasure,
as, for instance, from self-denial.
It has been observed, that pursuit is the great
secret of mental serenity; and this is so far true,
that without it there can be no
comfort, while a
state of inaction is absolutely fatal to enjoyment;
yet there may be unwearied pursuit without happi-
ness. It is not simply in possessing a constant
object of desire-not even if it be one of vehement
passion, that the essence of happiness consists : it is
necessary that the object should be characterised by
offering a sufficient and satisfactory good as the re-
sult of its attainment.
This position may appear hypothetical, but it is
every way proven in life; the votary of pleasure
nightly seeks his pillow with a consciousness of
disappointment and dissatisfaction, yet awakens to
pursue, with eagerness worthy of a better cause,
the same course, to be recompensed by grasping
the same mortification at tl1e close of each conven-
tional section of time. There bustling activity of

pursuit cannot cheat the mind with the illusion of
being happy, because its attention is so dissipated
and distracted, that it has no time to listen to the
suggestions of intellect, or to the better emotions of
the heart, till the hour of retiring arrives; and
then exhausted nature claims her privilege of enve-
loping disappointment and chagrin with her obli-
vious mantle; and then the victim of unsatisfactory
pursuit awakens to a renewal of the same efforts
upon the simple stimulus which arises from the
craving after action, and from having no other
action prepared for its notice. Still, it will be
seen that this is really a
perversion of the principle
of progression implanted in the human breast.
The same remarks will apply even to intellectual
objects, if they form an exclusive pursuit. There
is, however, here, some degree of satisfaction de-
pending upon the just employment of one section
of the man. Attention to this truth will unravel
the secret of happiness; for it is attainable exactly
in proportion as the object of pursuit is accompa-
nied by some substantial good. The acquisition of
knowledge is good, and thereibre its pursuit is, to a
certain extent, productive of solid advantage.
Vhere this knowledge is employed to enlighten
and improve those around us, it is attended with a
still greater share of satisfaction; but he alone can
be pronounced truly happy, who approaches nearest
to the perfection of the human character in the
largest developement of intellect, in the most ex-
tensive application of his resources for the benefit

178 THE RECIPROCAL 1NFLUENcE
of his fellow-men, and in the most complete devo-
tion of his faculties to the service of his Maker.
It will be further remarked, that the greatest
capacity for happiness will be enjoyed by him who
has the most expanded mental power; and the
desire after its possession may, therefore, form a
powerful motive for the developement of the facul-
ties, and for their subordination to the moral
principles. Without a
large mind, the sphere of
duty is everywhere contracted within narrow
limits ; it consists almost entirely in automatic
action,-it is the result of a mere animal mecha-
nism, of which the moving principle is life.""
But there should be a will to direct these move-
ments, to preside over them, and give them point;
there should be the constant aspiration of an
immortal principle superadded to life; and the first
manifestation of this principle should be the desire
after moral good.
When, indeed, we look to the history of man, we
shall find that this has been an inoperative principle;
yet its traces may be dimly descried through the
tumult of surrounding passions, and the perverting
influence of conflicting feelings and emotions.
The first impression of the Creator's hand upon his
rebellious and ungrateful creature, man-that
which constituted him "
very good," cannot be
wholly effaced ; there are
principles to work upon;
the great object is to direct these principles, so that
instead of allowing the mind to lie waste, or to be

overgrown by weeds, the seeds of good conduct
may be sown, and fostered, and matured: for it
may be assumed, as an
unquestioned fact, that hap-
piness and virtue are, and ever will be, inseparably
united; and that to the enjoyment of the former
the possession of the latter is an
indispensable pre-
requisite.
While many persons so
constantly exhibit proofs
of failure in their pursuit after happiness, it is safe
to infer, either that there is nothing fixed or deter-
minate in the mode of obtaining it, or that the
right road is ignorantly or
perversely abandoned.
And since real happiness has been shown to consist
in the exercise of virtuous principle, it be not dis-
covered, it must follow that it is not sought after
in the exercise of this principle, and in the conse-
quent submission of the heart to its dictates, and to
the commandments of him from whom virtue takes
its origin, and towards whom correct action will
always tend; but in the half-informed exercise of
reason, or in the vagaries of imagination, or in the
results of a defective experience.
Now, all these are inadequate guides. The very
circumstance, that the gifts of reason and the mani-
festations of understanding are
progressing, and
that to secure this advance they require education
and cultivation, proves that they are
imperfect.
Imagination, though a
highly useful auxiliary, and
the most important groundwork of that belief,
whose very essence consists in obedience, would
lead astray the devoted wanderer if its agency
were uncontrolled ; and the errors which are occa-

sioned by drawing general conclusions from a
limited experience are of daily occurrence.
If, then, man would but consider how small a
section of the universe he can be acquainted with,
he would acknowledge that the largest experience
would be insignificant, compared with the general
mass of facts; and he would learn diflidence from
the consideration, that all his premises and conclu-
sions would, in comparison with such mass, appear
as isolated circumstances, and deserving of no more
attention than would attach to them as such.
Since, then, man has no certain guide to happiness
in himself, and since its possession would seein to
be inseparable from the practice of virtue, it may
be inferred that it is not to be attained in anything
short of the exercise of this principle.
The 'fullest eryoyment is not to be possessed in a
situation where every wish is gratified; the lesser
trials and difficulties which are
inseparable from a
life of probation really add to its interest, because
they give a zest to the principle of progression, by
calling upon man foraconstant and an
increasing
effort to overcome them. It would be great injus-
tice to the young, if their happiness were studied
by the removal of every little obstacle from their
way, because these difliculties really serve to season
the current of life, to render it more
palatable by
taking away its insipidity, and to prepare the
thoughtless and the inexperienced for more im-
portant occasions.

would be fatal to desire, as well as to energy of

action ; it would be tiresome from monotony, and
painful from possessing no suflicient motive to
exertion, no
adequate sensation to produce sus-
tained self-denial, or to ensure the growth and
maturity of social virtue. There can be no cou-
tinued happiness where the individual is stationary,
much less should he retrograde-there must be
progress; the faculties must be energetically em-
ployed; and this is not to be expected, unless an
end of adequate importance be furnished as an
ap-
propriate stimulus. And since this is not to be
found in any temporary good, nor in anything
short of that future good which will completely fill
and exercise the bosom, it is evident that the
powers of the imagination must be placed in re-
quisition to assist the mind in realizing the supreme
future good, reaching onward through hope, and
faith, and confidence, to that distant end which IS
attainable, but which will only be possessed by
progressive advances, and by a
gradual unfolding
of the pursuit after, and of the enjoyment of, those
invisible realities which form the great object of
the good man's hope or desire.
Increase of moral virtue, or the fulfilment of the
appetite after perfection, results from this view.
For as it is in the career of literary acquisition,-
in the pursuit of scientific inquiry,-in the deve-
lopement of relative interest,-and in the cultiva-
tion of that charity which has for its object the
wide family of man ; so will it be found also here,
that every fresh step in advance is not only a

gained, but that it confers the capacity for still
greater happiness.
Now this is in itself a source of satisfaction, be»
cause the mind feels that it is growing, expanding
its beauties, augmenting its stores, and yielding its
meed of usefulness to society. But it is more than
this, for by its very progress it is constantly ren-
dered susceptible of still greater improvement,
while the ditiiculties which oppose its advance are
smoothed away; its native strength is increased;
and the knowledge necessary for its judicious ap-
plication is acquired.
In proportion to the number and importance of
these points or
resting-places will be the degree of
individual happiness; since its sources will be
multiplied, and the means of their cultivation will
be more
accurately defined ; for the judgment will
be better informed, and the imagination will be
kindled, and taste will be puri5ed, and feeling will
be refined, and every faculty will be exalted, and
rendered a new
expression of delight, and the
means of widening usefulness.
In moral progress, increasing beauty and aug-
mented value must never be separated. Thus it is
in nature. By one of its primaeval laws, the tender
blade, which we first notice in the autumn, during
the general decay which reigns around, is in itself
an
object of interest; its "inter of infancy is, how-
ever, passed without exciting much attention; in
the early spring we again notice its freshened
charms; every day adds to its beauty; but it is

only when it has passed through the discipline of
sunshine and cloud, storm and wind, that its full
value is developed, and that the well-laden shock
of corn gladdens the eye, and is associated with the
kindred feeling of gratitude for the many whose life
will be sustained, and whose comfort vill be pro-
moted by its instrumentality.
So, also, with regard to the oak: it is sown an
apparently insignificant body ; its early shoots
aH`ord a
promise of increasing pretensions; but
many summers will pass over before it will exhibit
the additional beauty of flowers and fruit, and very
many more before it will have reached the fulness
of its maturity.
So is it with man: his progress may be slow,
but still he does advance, and every year gives him
newly-developed attributes; he may have his
periods of apparent indolence, but the spring-tide
of action returns, and is always attended with
augmented means of usefulness. Be it, however,
remembered, that man is liable to a
process of de-
terioration and decay-of progressive loss of power
-and of debasement of the will.
But when once the essential law of progress is
interrupted, and man becomes stationary, he will
assuredly retrograde, because the stimulation of
every day will exhaust, unless fresh strength be
constantly accumulating; and then what will be
the consequence? The faculties will become ob-
tuse; the views will be obscured; the perception
will be clouded; judgment will be deprived of its
data, and the will of its power; the imagination

will be stunted ; taste will be chained down by the
objects of sense, and feeling will be animalized.
Thus, the manifestations of mind will appear as the
blighted production of an unfavourable season,
while the vacillating will precludes the continuance
of good desire, descries no
beauty in moral virtue,
and therefore has no wish to imitate or
pursue it.
How important is it, then, that the developement
of the human mind should rest on principle, and
that the said principle should consist, not in any
speculative advantage, but in obedience to the will
ofthe moral Governor of the universe. But if so
the object to be sought is not a life of expediency,
whose growth and advancement are to be measured
by an
increasing amount of usefulness, or of intel-
lectual attainment; it is not the simple enjoyment
of virtue, nor the pleasures or consolations of
religion; nor is it the fervour of enthusiasm ; but
it is a
system of duty defined by the moral law of
the Supreme Legislator, and requiring regular con-
formity to its letter and its spirit. ln one word, it
is not the result of excited feeling, but of fait/ful
obedience. The two ideas should never be dis-
joined; and it would be well for those who so
liberally employ this much- abused term "faitlz,"
to recollect that the idea here given of the insepa-
rable nature of faith and works is classically in-
3
volved in the very derivation of the word, since
mane, faith, claims for its root 1m0opa¢, to obey, or
to be obedient; the faith cannot exist unaccompanied
by the works; and good works should always proceed
from that exercise of the reasoning and imaginative

powers which realizes futurity, and which believes
because God has revealed.
In this way it will be seen that expediency yields
to the declared will of Heaven ; the desire of use-
fulness, though it be cultivated into passion, is not
to be constituted the end of action. Intellect,
though it be richly valued, is not to be unduly
exalted beyond its proper subordinate situation.
Virtue is to be esteemed for itseyf rather than for
the reward attached to its exercise. Religion is
to be admired, not for the present good which it
confers, but for its restoring man, degraded man,
to a
higher state of existence, and freshening
anew that pristine beauty which has been so much
lost by the introduction of evil into that creation
which was once
very good.
This principle of evil will be continually at war
with these results, and life will be passed in an
interminable struggle between the duties of prin-
ciple and the inclinations of passion. This is no
novel or controvertible assertion ; nor is it extraor-
dinary, for almost all, if not all, the phenomena of
the physical world result from a sustained counter-
agency, and could not be continued without its
influence.
Even if the reasonableness of this proposition
were not manifest upon very transient reflection;
yet if we scrutinize the inner man, if we notice
what is passing around us, or if we
appeal to past
experience, we shall find a
principle of evil con-
stantly opposing the suggestions of good, and only
calculated (if the powers of the mind be justly

balanced) to afford that continual stimulus to action,
which will preserve slothful man from slumbering
on his way over this probationary scene, and which
would secure his constantly seeking after a
higher
state of existence.
But this balance is destroyed: the happiness of
futurity loses its supremacy in the heart, through
the enjoyment of present trifles; and man listens to
the suggestions of wayward inclination, rather than
to the convictions of conscience and the demands of
duty. In the developement of mental power and
action, therefore, it is of the first importance to
foster and promote the one, and to encourage the
other.
Religion affords the only adequate method of
effecting these objects, since its hopes will stimulate
the former, while its sanctions will operate a trans-
fer of superiority to the latter. Let it be recollected,
that it is the perfection of our present faculties
which will constitute the happiness of heaven, a
state in which the attention will be fixed on the
sublimest truths, perception will be unencumbered
by materiality, reason will be elevated by know-
ledge, the imagination will be filled by all that is
lovely, conscience will be guided by virtue, and that
desire after excellence which still cleaves as a
principle to man, who will no
longer require
intense application, and careful examination and
correction; since the power of acquisi~tion, and the
varied modes of intelligence and feeling, will all be
ennobled.
Now, although this state may not be attainable

by the most assiduous efforts of the psychologist, it
is yet to be sought after; and though perfection
may not be reached, amelioration may. Let the
highest standard of attainment be the object
pursued; for, assuredly, human exertion will fall
far short of whatever limit may have been chosen
as the term of labour. In a word, those faculties
which relate to man's sojourn here below, and those
which prepare him for his future state of existence,
are to be developed : in both instances, he is to be
dissatisfied with mediocrity, and discontented with
any stationary point; he is to recollect, that there
is a
principle of decay, as well as of growth, and
that the activity of the latter will depend upon the
subjugation of the former; while the will to pursue,
and the means of accomplishing these designs,
should become objects of peculiar attention.
It may, however, be asked, what is the perfection
here intended, since absolute per/ection it cannot
be, from the nature of things, as well as from the
terms of the proposition? When we
contemplate
man's organisation, and consider that a material
structure is necessary, and has been appointed for
the manifestations of his mind; and that his
spiritual powers are impaired by this dependence;
when we look for the expansion of his intellectual
views, and observe, that, notwithstanding his largest
desires, a limit is everywhere placed to his re-
searches; and when we reflect upon his moral
position in this world, in a scene of trial and pro-
bation, in the midst of difficulties arising from
himself, and from those with whom he stands asso-

188 THE nscrrnoc/lL INFLUENCE
ciated, we shall conclude that imperfection attaches
to his every progress, and cleaves to him through
life; witness the narrowed understanding-the
perverted affections-the defective memory-the
toil of cultivationf- the necessity for constant
advice, counsel, and guidance; all proving, that in
his present state of being, absolute perfection cannot
attach to any of his thoughts, words, or actions,
except perhaps in some few instances which admit
of demonstration.
Thus mechanical science may be perfected; but
then, the multiplied failures before this point has
been attained,-the dilliculty with which it is ever
reached,-and the doubt, whether the assumed point
of perfection may only form a
resting-place in
the history of 1nan's progress, from which a fresh
start may yet be successfully made, afford corro-
borating evidence of the general truth, and lead to
the conclusion, that there is none
good but One-
that is GOD: and that there is none
perfect, but
the One from whom all approach to perfection has
originated.
Perfection is only to be attained in proportion as
man resembles his Maker. As man is truly an
imitative creature; and as the example of the
Supreme has been proposed for his adoption, his
aim should be to approach this standard of moral
excellence, so far as his powers and opportunities
will admit. In the pursuit after relative perfection,
every encouragement is afforded to industry; and
surely, to fulfil the design of creation, and to restore
-in any degree man's original likeness to his Maker,

is no mean recompense to those who sincerely wish
to banish ignorance, and advance the light of
knowledge. And not only does this prospect exist
from the very nature of things, (as that it must be
constantly augmenting,) but a
promise of success
is specially retained for those who earnestly and
sincerely seek to obtain it.
It is a fixed principle, that every being, and
every thing, is perfect in proportion as it accom-
plishes the design for which it was
produced. Now,
so far as we are
acquainted with the secret inten-
tions of nature, whether exhibited in the mighty
circle of the universe, or in the completeness of its
minutest details, we find the attribute of perfection
stamped upon them all; and although there are
many processes, of which we cannot fathom the
rationale, yet, as those which we do understand are
perfect, we believe that the same character attaches
to those which are unknown; and the reason
why
we cannot comprehend them, is to be found in our
own want of research, or in the imperfection of our
powers.
Why man, originally pronounced very good,
should now seem to be the only imperfect creation of
the On1nipotent,l1as been already explained; and
it has been shown, that this does not originate in
less care, or wisdom, or
goodness in the Almighty
Designer, but in wilful man's corruption of himself,
and in his obstinate wanderings from the right
path.
This truth should, however, operate as a stimulus
for him to endeavour to regain a property which

he has so
miserably lost; and since he cannot
fathom the essential attributes of bodies around him,
nor unravel the purposely concealed designs of the
Almighty, nor enter into the comprehensive views
of infinite knowledge; and since a load of imperfec-
tion rests upon his highest efforts and best designs,
all he can do is wisely to consider wherein consists
the perfection of the divine character, and to imitate
this exemplar, as far as the utmost limit of his
talents will allow. It is impossible to form an idea
of the nature and properties of a
purely spiritual
being; it is therefore the attributes of the Creator,
as exhibited in his works, and as revealed in his
Word, which are
proposed for our imitation; and
the prevailing characteristics of this magnificent
display of wisdom, and knowledge, and power,
and mercy, and benevolence, may be shortly stated
to consist in regularity, beauty, and utility.
Vithout order and harmony, this beautiful world
would be a chaos, and would quickly crumble
into ruins; and those magnificent bodies which
we notice whirling in immensity, would be de-
stroyed by collision with each other; while their
undeviating appearance, the alternation of day and
night, the succession of the seasons, and its conse-
quences upon nature's widely-extended domain, all
exhibit the impress of regularity.
From this uniformity of action results in great
measure that perfect beauty, which attends the per-
formance of all nature's operations, and which we
can only understand in proportion as we become
more intimately acquainted with processes which

(while remaining in ignorance) would inspire far
other emotions; that is, till the ray of truth had
enabled us to explain reasonably what at first sight
seem inexplicable, and was therefore an
object
of fear, or of blind and superstitious admiration,
rather than of that sublime and satisfying emotion,
which arises from embracing a design, and from
entering into the means for its accomplishment.
But, again, nothing has been produced without
an intention of us¢1lness. It is indeed true, that
we cannot always trace this property; but since we
find it impressed upon all, with which we are
thoroughly acquainted, we cannot doubt that it
does everywhere exist: and since, within a few
years, we have discovered the wisest provisions in
circumstances which we could not previously com-
prehend, it does not require a
large stretch of
candour to extend this principle of belief to other
processes, which as
yet we cannot fathom.
The first maxim, then,of reaching onwards towards
perfection, is to introduce harmony and regularity
into the manifestations of mind, to develope the
intellectual powers, to regulate the passions, and to
hold them in just subordination to every olyect of
good, and particularly to the performance of the will
of Heaven.
This point being attained, the mental machinery
ought to work well, and spontaneously to elicit that
moral beauty, which can
only originate from a due
cultivation of talent-and from an
adequate mani-
festation, yet j-udicious subjugation, of feeling and

l92 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
passzkm and afection, to the great design Of
creation, viz. the glory of the Creator!
Much has been written on the nature of beauty;
and without entering into any curious disquisition
on the subject, it is important to ascertain, wherein
consists moral beauty. This inquiry will be facili-
tated, by ascertaining in what consists the beauty
of the material objects around us, and we shall
probably trace its sources to their sublimity-to
their possessing properties which are agreeable to
the senses; and to the wise adaptation of these
properties to (ill the particular space which nature
has designed.
And if so, by parity of reasoning, moral beauty
will attach to objects and principles, in proportion
as they extend beyond the present scenes, and
trend onwards to that state of perfect being, of
which the sublimest conceptions of the human
mind can form such an
inadequate notion ; in pro-
portion as
they fulfil the particular design of the
Almighty Maker-give the widest expansion to
man's intellectual powers-excite the admiration
of his compeers, and are more
extensively useful;
and in proportion as
they ennoble his desires, purify
and exalt his wishes, and render him more and more
anxious to complete the design of his being; an
object, notwithstanding, which seems ever increas-

the importance of imitating that moral beauty which
is "
altogether lovely," is more
impressively felt.
But from these premises it will follow, that there
can be no moral beauty in anything which under-

mines the simple natural impression (and much less
in aught which contravenes it) of any law of nature
or of God; since in the former case motive must
be distorted from its simple design; and in the
latter, it must be opposed to the will of Him who
is moral excellence I
Wherever these properties attach to man, the
remaining attribute necessary to compose a finished
idea ofthe doctrine of human perfection, is that of
usefulness. Nothing has been created in vain;
and if the law of utility really attaches to the
lowest productions of the Almighty Architect, how
much more to his best and highest effort in the
creation of man in his own likeness-the image of
perfection l
The solid productions of this process of mental
and moral developement may not always excite
the admiration of the gay, the giddy, and the
thoughtless, but they will always command esteem.
In every department of man's daily history, the
standard chosen for imitation is the revelation of
the moral attributes of God. Without the infusion
of this master principle, the character will want
its great quality of moral beauty; it will be cold
and calculating-selfish, and narrow-minded; it
will be the mere child of reason-dispassionate,
indeed, but wanting in that energy of action, and
unity of design, which can alone result from en-
listing the affections, as motives to action and
exertion.
Reason, only, it is true, may make a
very useful

194 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
wealth, for reason alone will teach man to be
careful of his own interest; and he will soon learn,
that in this care is involved, not only the necessity
for not injuring the welfare of others, but even the
design of promoting it. Reason alone will make
him a man of enlightened and cultivated mind,
in order that he may extend for himself the plea-
sures of intellectual acquisition-become more
generally acceptable, and (since knowledge is
power) that he may widen the opportunities of
influence over those around him; finally, reason
alone will make him the advocate of religion as a
system of morals, because it is the protectress and
only rewarder of virtue.
The reasonable character, however, when tried
by the tests just recommended, will be found want-
ing in moral beauty; that is, its manifestations
of mind will need the essential attribute of religion
in order to constitute them truly valuable. The
difference is precisely this ;-the man of reason
only, possesses a methodical regularity of move-
ment, which may even amount to mechanical
certainty, and we
may therefore calculate upon his
conduct; but the man of reason and religion
combined, possesses claims to affectionate esteem,
from the lessened agency of selfishness, and from
the proportionably increased devotion of the heart
and understanding, and will, to the real comfort
and advantage of his fellow man, and to the glory
of God.
Such being the nature of the abstract principle
of perfection, it may be worth while to notice its

application to real life, and to those natural and
social inequalities which are so
plentifully inter-
spersed throughout its course. The feebleness of
nature, which depends upon the mysterious union
of mind with matter; and the degree in which the
manifestations of the former are
impeded by the
greater or less inaptitude of the latter towards its
more
purely spiritual function; the animal pecu-
liarities which are handed down from the present
race to posterity-the great varieties of temper and
disposition-and the varying modes of expression
and of feeling, arising from the influence of phy-
sical temperament, will place obstacles in the
onward reach towards perfection, and will often
constitute an
insuperable barrier to success.
`
Again, the influence of society, as it operates
upon large classes of individuals, is opposed to
much progress. In intellect, in feeling, in action,
in motive, and in principle, a
degree of sluggish
contentment impairs the energy of the mind, and
leaves it satisfied with a measure of acquisition far
short of that which it might grasp. Man is na-
turally indolent, and he will not bestir himself
energetically, unless he have a
powerful motive for
so
doing. And should he want the excitement of
emulation-should he find other mindsaround him
contented with a low standard, then will /ze be
satisfied with a
paucity of mental manifestation,
very far short of what he might accomplish by the
diligent application of his mental energies.
These very energies are not always equally sus-
ceptible of improvement. Although they ought

not to have been such as we
usually find them in
adult life, under the influence of neglect, perverse
will, rooted habit, confirmed prejudice, and evil
example, yet under the best moral discipline, and
the most judicious management, there will be found
original predispositions which must be studied-
those which lead to beneficial results should be
encouraged, while those which conduct towards
dangerous errors (and what error can there be
which is not dangerous ?) must be repressed.
It will often happen, that some
very important
faculty exists in so minus a state, and is so com-
pletely overshadowed by some more prominent and
commanding attribute, that it will require great
care to draw it out from concealment, and to give
it every fostering advantage, in order that it may
fairly compete with the greater original strength
and opportunities of some more
superficial and,
perhaps, more striking quality.
Now the principle of treatment in these cases,
is not to stimulate any dominant attribute, so that
the character might become renowned for one
par-
ticular excellence--but to obtain developement of
all the faculties in such proportion, that no one
shall interfere with the regularity, beauty, and
moral worth of any other, or of the whole ; and
to preserve all the manifestations of mind in just
keeping with any one individual expression.
In accomplishing this, faculties which have been
benumbed by inattention must be roused from their
frozen slumber; those which have been enticed
into precocious maturity must be thrown into the

background; and the original strength of their
several peculiarities must be consulted, and dili-
gently ascertained, in order to maintain- the har-
monious equilibrium of the whole. Moral prin-
ciple will often afford _the boundary-line, beyond
which it would be dangerous to employ any talent
however dazzling by its brilliance, however tempt-
ing by its associations, or
by its native facility of
cultivation.
Thus, for instance, vanity is often developed in
the breast by a conscious possession of some pre-
dominating faculty, which gives success
among
compeers and competitors; it becomes attached
to this success, and exactly in proportion as it does
so, virtue loses its attraction and excellence, no
longer forms an
object for imitation ; moral worth
and substantial good obtain a diminished interest,
and, at all events, their influence is greatly circum-
scribed; the idea of duty is lost in the self-
gratulation of triumph; while the conscious self-
importance which is the consequence of this success,
induces its subject to despise, or, at all events,
lightly to esteem the talents of equals; the benevo-
lent affections are repressed-the energy of imita-
tation as
regards good example is paralyzed; the
character thinks to its own exclusive standard, and
a
superficial but showy manifestation ill conceals
the poverty of the soil whence it originates. And
since love to God, and our neighbour, are indica-
tions of mental growth, and since these are ulti-
mately undermined by the exclusive culture we
have contemplated, we can but infer the importance

of maintaining a
just proportion in the several
indications of mind, especially of the intellectual
and affective faculties.
Another obstacle in the way of successful pro-
gress towards perfection, consists in a want of
adaptation of the means to the peculiar or
probable
situation in life of each individual; so that the
faculties more
particularly required in after life
may be timely developed, and duly exercised.
That plan of developement will contribute most to
the ultimate happiness and worth of mankind,
which educes most effectually habits of real thought,
combined with such principles of conduct as shall
form a good social character, a
good citizen, and a
good Christian.
This is not attainable by any mere
system of
teaching; intellectual knowledge will be the only
result of such process; and unless the heart be
stored with principles of conduct, nothing has yet
been done, as it ought to be done. If this be
neglected, all the religious instruction conveyed in
creeds and catechisms, and committed to memory
as a task, will be useless-will drop as barren
flowers, and will yield no fruit. _
This, however, is not the fault of catechetical
instruction, which is highly valuable; the evil
consists in weighing down the memory with a load
of questions and answers, which never reach beyond
that faculty, and which are
consequently inopera-
tive upon conduct. Instruction must reach the
heart, if it would give laws to the understanding,-
define the use of the intellectual powers-and

impose those moral restraints, wanting which, with
all the temptations of passion, all the opportunities
of influence, and all the provocatives of society,
the voice of virtue would be stifled, and would be
supplanted by the impulse of selfish desire; man
would become the slave of vice, and would deform
instead of ornamenting the creation of the Al-
mighty.
The importance of mental developement is further
demonstrated by its influence upon religious belief;
for it is manifest, that without active intelligence
this would soon
degenerate into superstition. If
the creed should involve practically a
system of
irrational agency and supernatural influence; if it
were
independent of the thoughts and affections-
if its observances were grounded on the apprehen-
sion of some unknown future evil, to avert which
certain forms of devotion are to be employed-if
it were to become the result of passion rather than
of conviction; if the Deity were
represented as an
object of dread, rather than of love-as threatening
punishment rather than as abundant in mercy-as
clothed with anger, rather than as
delighting in
the happiness of his creatures-as requiring the
homage of feeling, rather than as
rejoicing in the
sacrifice of well-employed talent-if religion were
portray ed asa
gloomy abstraction, rather than as
the perfection of the understanding. and of the
affections applied to the conduct of every day, and
every hour ; and, finally, if it were made to consist
in a series of privations, without hope and without
joy in this world, then, indeed, would it become

200 THE nr:c11=nocAL INFLUENCE
a
superstition, which would enthral the best powers
of the mind, and chain them down to the utmost
limits of Christianity, from which none of its goodly
proportions could be seen or
appreciated.
Unless the common duties of life be undertaken
with just views of the principles upon which they
are to be constructed, they will be ill performed ;
and this will operate more
particularly upon the
upper ranks in society, exactly in proportion to
the natural influence which attaches to wealth and
power; since the necessity for moral exertion in-
creases with the capacity for action, and the oppor-
tunities of usefulness. Man is not only called
upon to do good, but to do all the good he can; and
with this view, all his resources are to be placed
in active requisition; all his talents are to be em-
ployed-all his feelings energized to the utmost-
and his sphere of usefulness constantly extended
with wisdom and prudence.
i
The agency of man's will has excited ceaseless
attention; and it has done so
particularly, because
it has been usually represented as
presiding over
the conduct, and giving its tone and temper to the
understanding and the heart, rather than as
being
influenced by them; or, it has been considered as a
sort of wayward influence, over which the indi-
vidual had no control, but that it was acted upon
by circumstances from without, or
suggestions from
within, according as these circumstances and sug-
gestions were overruled by a
good or a bad spirit:
both these views are incorrect, and lead to serious
error, in doctrine and practice.

or nomr AND MIND. 201
The will has not been sufficiently considered as
the result of sound udgment and correct reasoning;
and as influenced by the state of the reasoning organ
-by health and disorder-by preceding associations,
habits, and customs; but it has been exhibited as
amysterious influence not to be defined-commu-
nicable to-day, but to be withdrawn to-morrow;
it has been described as a
faculty which is not
unfettered in its choice of good, or refusal of evil,
but which rather acts as under a
necessity imposed
by Him from whom all things proceed, or
origi-
nated from him who perverteth all things.
The consequence of this view of the subject is,
that man is contented to be governed by a blind
choice, rather than to govern hinweyf with a freedom
of will, resulting from the decision of judgment.
But no
steady and consistent action can be obtained
from intelligent creatures without the concurrence
of the will. It is, therefore, of great importance
to improve this faculty, and as far as
possible to
abstract it from those causes of vacillation which
render it feeble and uncertain ; to revive its languid
influence-to strengthen it when impaired-to
fortify it for the hour of trial-to preserve it from
the torpor of indifference-to give it stedfastness
amidst the waves of contradicting impulse--to
render it constant to principle-to fix it upon truth
which cannot change-to protect it from the deadly
influence of newly-awakened desire-and so to
carry it forward, as to traverse the obliquities of
human conduct, and to place it in safety in the
haven of perfection. _

202 Tun RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
Since, then, the feebleness and misguided wan-
derings of the will are the great sources of error;
and since, in spite of the best-directed efforts, they
will still remain in some
degree influential through
life, it will ever be a
grand object of mental culture,
first,-to fortify the will by enlarging the under-
standing, ennobling its designs, giving it just prin-
ciples, fixing its dependence where alone it can
securely rest, and maintaining it in such a state
of active exercise, and in such a situation of pre-
eminence, as that it shall control the instincts, the
passions, and the propensities of animal nature.
Secondly, to correct its wayward tendencies, by
the substitution of principled motive for the un-
certainty of selfish desire.
Thirdly, to exercise a
salutary influence upon
its actions, and to ensure for its operations a wise
and prudent direction, as well as a fixed, and
uniform, and determinate character, by furnishing
the heart with sentiments of virtue, benevolent
feelings, pure and refined taste, with habits of
universal charity ; and,
Fourthly, since the will to choose good and
refuse evil is really feeble, and liable to a
great
degree of apathy on the one hand, and of debase-
ment on the other, it must be led to the only
source of solid principle and good desire, viz. to
the moral government of the Supreme.
Such are the rules for the guidance of this
faculty; and according to their impression, and
to the degree in which they excite attention, its
degradation or its worth-its utility or its worth-

lessness-its easy compliance with, or its steady
opposition to, vlcn-its firm choice, or its wavering
disposition towards good.
It must ever be remembered that it is ours to
choose the good, and to refuse the evil-while the
strength to enable us to do so must be derived, and
will be given, sought for, from on
high : so shall
we be preserved from estimating too highly our
own powers, or from slumbering on
through life
in apathy, waiting for an
influence which will never
be vouchsafed to those who are not sincere in their
earnest desires after that firmness of purpose which
can alone give weight to words and actions, or
render man an estimable character,--one in whom
his fellow-man may confide, and whom he may
securely love.
There exists in individuls a
great difference as to
the firmness of this faculty, accruing not only from
the influence of the moral causes we have just
contemplated, but depending also upon physical
temperament ; exhibiting itself on the one hand in
an
imperturbable firmness; and on the other hand,
in such a
mobility of determination, that it is
diflicult to fix it at all to any useful purpose.
In the former instance, the excessive strength is
to be counteracted, not by diminishing power, but
by cultivating the judgment, and in the latter, by
bringing into action all the resources of mind and
body, in order to produce a
fixed character.
In the family, in society, and in the state, there
is required, in every department of their agency, as
well as in the government of sel/Q a certain yielding

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
of the will, a submission to authority, more or less
limited; for man is indolent and self-willed by
nature, and he will not, of his own free purpose,
bestir himself to industry, or sacrifice selfish gratifi-
cation for the good of others.
This effect upon the will, must be watched with
some
delicacy in early life ; for as it is convenient
to the teacher to obtain a
pliancy, and a diminished
energy of this Faculty in the taught; so
may this
object be thoughtlessly pursued, as'if the great aim
were to subdue a
power which ought to be main-
tained in all its original strength, though placed
under the guidance qfprinciple.
In the government of this faculty, the example
of the teacher will be of great consequence ; for as
the energy of the will may be diminished by the
want of this example, in those to whom the young
are accustomed to look up with reverence, so is it
often impaired by capricious requirements, espe-
cially by the very common mistake of good-
humoured laxity to-day, destroying the tension of
the will, alternated with monast.ic severity to-mor-
row, ruiningits tone; and so
placing it in that fitful
and feverish condition, which necessarily leads to
debility.
And then, morality will be found to consist in
simply good intentions, unaccompanied by fixed
and permanent desire; and devotedness to any
object will be the mere
yielding of a feeble cha-
racter, never to be depended upon, and ever liable
to be driven from its purpose by the zephyr of
changing circumstances; much more, therefore,

by the tempest of vice, or the storms of passion,
which agitate society to its very centre, and which
render its voyage difficult to the young and inex-
perienced.
The full energy of purpose should be most
religiously preserved; since upon it depends that
freedom of choice, which will elevate rational man
above the creature of instinct, and which will enable
immortal man to prefer the path of virtue, to subdue
the inclination towards evil, and to disavow its
authority; to escape from the irrational influence
of unguarded necessity, and make him responsible
for every part of his conduct.
To show that this responsibility rests upon per-
sonal choice, it will be necessary to distinguish
between the effect of mere volition, and the agency
qffree will; the one
may be purely automatic, the
other must result from the exercise of the reasoning
powers; the one is generally attended by mere
consciousness, and follows as a
necessary result from
it, while the other is aided by conscience, and is
accompanied by a conviction that we
might have
determined differently, though reason and reflec-
tion combine to say that we
ought not; the one
may be momentarily suspended by passion, the
other may be subjugated by it; the one is unaltered
by the torrent of desire, while the other is over-
whelmed by it; in fact, the one is chained to
animal nature, while the other is attached to intel-
lectual and spiritual man.
Hence, the very grave importance of not indul-
ging the caprices of the young; since, by such

indulgence, he ceases to be master of himself, and
the consequence of this change is debasing to
the character, and fatal to its consistency.
It is very possible for a
powerful though secondar_y
motive, to exert a considerable influence over the
will; such, for instance, as a wish to please those
whom we love; but this will not be suflicient under
circumstances of trial and temptation; it will only
operate while the motive is alive, and the feelings
are awake to its impulse ; deprived of these, there
remains behind no constant energy, no Exed choice,
no invaluable object of desire, and no free and
reflecting determinativeness to pursue it, notwith-
standing all the inconveniences, trials, and losses,
which may accrue from such pursuit.
Hence, the freedom and the reasonableness of the
will must be cultivated, while every approach to
impulsive action is to be deprecated, as
leading to
irresolution and inconstancy; the first, depending
upon the thousand undefined and uncertain forms
presented by objects not absolutely submitted to
our senses; and the second, constituting a
faculty,
without the permanent duration of action necessary
for its useful employment.
The will habitually accustomed to exercise energy
of manifestation, will be much more to be relied
upon, than where no such habit of energy has been
formed. Hence, the importance of accustoming the
mind to determine for itself, in all the lesser emer-
gencies of life; and then, when the same
process
is required on other more important occasions, it
will have ceased to be that strange tlzing, which, by

its strangeness, destroys the possibility of freedom,
and of 6111111685 of purpose.
Moreover, the freedom -and determinativeness of
the will are both confirmed by its most perfect sub-
mission to moral influence; and nothing is so
fatal to its energy, as undefined, uncertain, and
vague notions as to the boundaries of right and
wrong.
'
Since the will is influenced by certain motives,
it is important that these should appeal to the
understanding and the conscience ;' that they should
of themselves form stable grounds for action; and
that, by the frequency of their recurrence, they
should be wrought into constant habits; otherwise,
the interior presiding mind will be passive, and
without consistency; the impulse of action, and the
stimulus of occasion will alone be heard, and no
broad and general, yet defined, outline will be im-
pressed upon the character.
These motives may be considered as instinc-
tive, or automatic, intellectual, affective, and spi-
ritual.
Among the former may be classed all those
which arise from the physical agency of impression,
the immediate consequence of any excitement of
the senses; that tact which results from the
harmonious blending of a
well-organized system
under the influence of its appropriate stimuli; and
taste, which is the consequence of this action, to-
gether with the 'operation of sympathy and anti-
pathy, aversion, dislike, good or evil desire, &c.

208 'nie nr-:c1PnocAL INFLUENCE
Among the second class of motives, reason cou-
siders the relation which subsists between causes
and their effects, traces consequences to their source,
draws inferences from established premises, weighs
the probable results arising from certain situations
and circumstances, and determines upon the advan-
tages and inconveniences, the expediency or inex-
pediency, of certain actions; always taking for its
_standard the amount of real or supposed good
which may be obtained. Its agency is restricted
to prudential maxims, and it draws its inferences
from the physical and intellectual nature of man,
and from the constitution of society. Though
limited, the influence of reason is always salutary,
because it judges deliberately, and decides upon
broad principles. It balances one set of inclinations,
by calling in their counter-agents, and so maintains
a
proper equilibrium by its strict and even-handed
justice.
The motives which may be classed under the
term afective, are those which How from the infi-
nitely varied modifications of self-love; from the
influence of the opinions of others upon our own;
from the sentiment of all that is just, and true, and
beautiful, in nature, society, and morals; and from
the affections, properly so called.
To these should be added religion, which con-
trols, unites, and energizes all the rest. United
to this latter motive, reason takes a
higher, nay,
the highest possible standing, as the counsellor of
every action; since it purifies and sublimes that

action, by including in its consequences, the influ-
ence of` present scenes upon our eternal and other-
wise unnoticed interests.
These combined motives are
all-powerful ; but
without the latter, they would be nugatory. Phy-
sical instinct may be true to nature, but then that
nature is perverted : reason will be unavailing, and
the voice of the affective faculties will be mischiev-
ous, unless confirmed, enlarged, strengthened, and
governed by religious principle,-the first, the last,
the only universally-operative agent,-the same
under every varying circumstance-to-day, to-
morrow, and for that perpetual succession of the
never-present day, which constitutes eternity ;-a
conception too sublime for finite man to embrace,
except by supposing an infinite series of periods,
with the duration of any one of which he is unac-
quainted.
These motives would proceed harmoniously, were
the heart of man
always influenced by pure princi-
ples and good desires. But the first is lamentably
the contrary : man's physical nature has suffered that
debasing change, whereby his powers are circum-
scribed, and his intellectual manifestations are dete-
riorated ; the growth of his understanding is
stunted; his affections are chilled; and his afiini-
ties with evil are
greater than with good-at least
apparently; the voice of' Divine Truth is scarcely
heard; and thus the will becomes inenergetic, from
the want of High Sanction, and from the impossi-
bility of keeping present to the mind those unseen
realities which form the bond of' union between

210 THE nnclrnoc/u. INFLUENCE
the present and a future life; it is inconstant and
uncertain, under the influence of contending and
frequently-repeated emotion; and it is violent or
depraved, when borne down by evil inclination, wild
passion, or unsubdued affection.
Natural conscience would do much towards en-
lightening the mind, and guiding it in the right
way ; but man is not always, nor even
often, atten-
tive to its monitions; and, therefore, it is to be
cultivated by the aid of revealed religion: and
t/zen, even in the midst of difficulties, though en-
slaved by passion, it is disenthralletl by principle.
Time and other circumstances may give an
increased facility to the operation of this principle,
which in itself possesses an
inappreciable agency
upon the government of the life. It is indeed
true, that the love of virtue for its own sake may
exist in the minds of some few, without distinct
views of its nature, of the source from whence it
springs, or of the sanctions by which it is supported.
But this is a rare qualification, and wherever found,
it must be considered as a talent which admits of
and requires cultivation; and which, in order to
ensure its full effect, and to employ it favourably,
in the onward reach towards perfection, must be
supported by an
appeal to that principle which
never changes ; and to that desire after progressive
attainment, as well as the fixed determination to
pursue it, which will supersede inferior motives,
whether drawn from the influence of the example
of large masses of mankind, from the opinions of
society, or from personal interest; and which will

place the mainspring of action, where alone it call
securely rest, viz. upon religiousprincqzle.
Not that the agency of example, or the influence
of opinion, are to be lightly esteemed; since by
these, the principle which works secretly in the
bosom of man is energized to action, and a
process
of constant amelioration is kept alive in the heart,
is supported by reason, and is rendered available
for all the real emergencies of life, by an en-
lightened judgment betweeen right and wrong.
Hence, also, arises a moral tact, which enables
man to discover the weak points of his own cha-
racter, and by this discovery, to diminish the ob-
staclesin the way of his improvement ; since "
mille
rnala, mille etiam remedia;" the knowledge ofa
disease is more than half its cure; and when the evil
tendencies are known, they may be counteracted,
and their opposite virtues may be encouraged; so
that the operations of good principle upon the
heart, and of virtuous action upon the life, form
mutual re-agents, the power and extent of which
can
only be fully known by considering the changes
which are
produced by them, and the consequent
degree in which the love of virtue is fostered and
enlarged.
Were it lawful to hazard an
opinion as to the
design of the Almighty Creator, in stamping this
character upon his most perfect creature, we
might
suppose that the moral developement of man, or
the perfection of his free choice, was the object of
the Supreme in placing him in his present relative
situation : and, that if he were permitted to lose his

original pmfectness, it was, that he might be deeply
impressed with the necessity for uniform progres-
sion, and for making the most of the trials of this
probationary scene, which would all assist to render
him better fitted to bear the image of the infinite
purity in which he was created; and to copy the
example of that infinite wisdom, and mercy, and
love, which have been set before him for his
humble imitation, and for strenuous exertions after
greater likeness to this pattern of his conduct, and
anchor of his hopes.
Increasing obedience to the voice of principle;
increasing distance from the clamours of passion
and prejudice; and increasing freedom from the
clouds of error and fallacious judgment; in short,
daily improvement, should form the great object of
the good man's desire. Yet the conviction of this
progress will not encourage self-love or
pride;
since the effect of every advance is to throw more
light upon the widening prospect of attainment,
and to increase the sense of responsibility arising
from the consciousness of augmented capacity for
good. Thus a sentiment of humility is occasioned
by the small progress that has been made, com-
pared with the boundless prospect in advance, and
the distance at which the forwardest remains, from
anything like conformity to the sublime model he
has chosen for imitation.
There are, however, minds, which, from some
physical condition of the mental organ, are not
susceptible of very high culture; and the great

complished by apportioning the means adopted to
the peculiarities of the individual.
In early life, a
rigid discipline is necessary to
accustom the young to repress their passions ; and
yet, that they may feel the importance of decision
of character, they must, to a certain extent, be
rendered independent; they must be aware of the
power to choose, and yet of their obligation to obey :
nor is this difficult; since just laws and equal
liberty may perfectly consist together, whenever
their respective limits have been accurately de-
fined.
In the present case, all which augments the
immediate good and future welfare of the young,
may be allowed, nay more, may be encouraged, by
the influence of the principle whose operation we
have traced ; while that alone is placed as a limit
to perfect freedom of action, which would keep from
destroying the present happiness, or the eventual
prosperity of its subjects ; well knowing, that only
that deserves to be estimated as
contributing to the
pleasure of the hour, which will also enlarge the
spiritual powers, and render them better fitted for
the progressive improvement, which is to advance
them towards that state of jinal perfection which is
only attainable in the world to come.
Now, to this end, nothing is indifferent-nothing
useless: the most apparently trivial causes have
become, and will continue to be, occasions for
mental developement; and may be rendered in-
strumental in promoting the design of increasing
growth, and augmenting beauty of manifestation;

214 THE nncirnocar. INFLUENCE
even as the simplest natural changes, the varieties
of atmospherical pressure and temperature, do
tend to advance the natural progress towards ma-
turity and perfection, which is impressed upon
every part of nature's widely-extended domain.
No sooner have events, or reasoning, or sensa-
tion, occurred a few times in the same order and
under analogous circumstances, than they become
intimately associated, even long before the mind is
aware of such bias ; and, afterwards, the recurrence
of the one will most naturally reproduce the other.
Now this, which at first sight may appear a
very
simple process, is, in fact, a habit. Hence, the diffi-
culty of distinguishing that which arises from
idiosyncrasy or
peculiarity ofphysical temperament,
from that which is the result of education.
And yet it is important to form this distinction,
since the influence of the _jiwrmer will be much
greater, and will be less easily counteracted than
that of the latter,-inasmuch as that which is
natural has a
greater affinity with our soil, and
possesses a
larger power of cohesive attraction than
that which is by nature extrinsic, and merely
implanted by a scientific operation. Yet since
these associations will form the basis of character,
and give their colour to action ; and since they will
exert a beneficial or a baneful agency, it is of the
first consequence that they should be rendered
available to a good purpose; that they should be
made to assist, instead of disturbing and defeating
that design of progressive amelioration, which forms
thc most important object of mental developement.

or BODY AND MIND. 215
The success which will attend this process, will
depend greatly upon the nicety with which the
degree of excitement is proportioned to the de-
velopement of cerebral power; too much will de-
stroy the tone of the organ by occasioning irritation ;
too little will produce languor and feebleness from
inaction. In order to diminish the influence of
exciting causes, it is necessary that they should be
placed under the general law, by which the vivid-
ness of impression is precisely in an inverse pro-
portion to the frequency and regularity of its
notices; and that, too, notwithstanding they should
be accompanied by so much of variety and change,
as that the sentient principle should not be reduced
to automatic action, or to, that state of guietzlsm
which is not suited to a
busy bustling world, and
which detracts, moreover, from the social value of
the character.
This result can
only be obtained by regularity;
since the same
impressions are expected to return,
and actually do recur, with the same trains of as-
sociation; that which is painful at first will be
diminished in the intensity of its suffering,--while,
at the same time, the anticipation of that which is
pleasing will not have been disappointed; and
desire will not have been stimulated in vain.
But the period of mental excitation is not indif-
ferent, any more than the degree in which it is
permitted; for in the same
way as if the stimulus
should have been too great; so, if it shall have
been applied at an hour of the day approaching
to the usual allotment of sleep, wakefulness will

be the consequence, together with a
degree of
irritability of the brain, very unfavourable to its
continued energy, and usually denoted by a
high
degree of mobility and disposition to action, with
greatly-diminished power of supporting exertion.
This excitation may not always be the result of
design; it may be called up by accident, or
by
manner, or
by reciprocity of action ; and, therefore,
it is not unimportant to attend to those involuntary
mental impressions, which may reproduce asso-
ciated emotions of a character injurious to a well-
regulated mind, and which, when so
produced,
may be perpetuated by habit, or be re-excited by
the thousand occurrences of daily life.
Too great emotion is followed by exhaustion,
and consequent reaction-both of which are un-
favourable to the expansion, growth, and power of
intellect. Thus the common consequence of highly-
pleasing sensation is a fit of depression; too
powerful an excitement has been produced, equi-
librium has been destroyed, and the balance of
nervous function oscillates violently, until serenity
can be gently and quietly restored; and this is
to be accomplished, ~not
by creating counter-
stimulus in another department of mental operation,
but by wisely diminishing the weight which has
been unguardedly placed in one of the scales of
human action and passion.
For this reason, it is desirable to tix the attention
ou things rather than on persons-on abstractions
rather than on individuals; because, in the latter
case, passion is too easily excited, and sympathy

or
antipathy are awakened, both of which are
commonly too powerful stimuli for the young
mind.
On a similar principle, contentedness of disposi-
tion, and benevolence of feeling, are to be cultivated
as a means of expanding the heart, and of strength-
ening tbe intellectual capacity, by which it will
gradually be enabled to bear a
greater degree of
excitement with impunity, and too high a measure
of susceptibility will be removed.
In this process of mental developement, the early
indications of imagination will require attention-
the more so, as its operations are frequently unseen
and unobserved. In tracing early intellectual
progress, we shall notice that internal improve-
ment, in consequence of which the calibre of mind
is enlarged, and the increase of knowledge is facili-
tated. Thus, increasing experience accumulates
a treasure of facts and opinions, which, in their
turn, form the materials for the exercise of the same
faculties; the spirit of inquiry is fortified by the
action of multiplying observations; the memory
becomes more faithful in proportion as connexion
is established between ideas; judgment is defined
accordingly as it has compared a
greater number
of objects and results : but the power of imagina-
tion increases or diminishes with a most extraor-
dinary rapidity, and precisely because it is permitted
to luxuriate without _fixed rules (though, according
to some arrangement of its own) among the in-
ternal and fantastic representations of external
objects.

Hence the importance of attending to a
faculty
whose mistakes and misapprehensions are not to
be combated by reason, since its voice will not be
heard-and there will be no actual attention to the
positive images of truth. .
Before we abandon this subject, there remains
to be noticed one other application of this principle
of progressive improvement-viz. to the advance
of the Christian in acquiring greater resemblance
to his great Exemplar :-to his progress in holiness.
However unattainable may be absolute perfection,
still it is to be striven after; nor should the Chris-
tian rest satisfied, with anything short of perfect
purity, and perfect conformity to the will of God ;
for here he has no continuing city, but he seeks
one to come; here he has no abiding resting-place,
but is constantly reaching after that rest which
remaineth for the people of God; here he is en-
compassed by infirmity and imperfection; and
while he ardently desires to be free from the
incumbrance of this mortal body, he must at least
equally desire to be gradually preparing for a re-
sidence in that holy, happy place, where sin and
sorrow cannot enter.
"
Be ye holy, even as I am
holy. Be ye, therefore, perfect, even as
your
Father which is in heaven is perfect. l am the
Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou
perfect."
Such is the language of inspiration ! Perfection
is the character of the Christian's aspiration, even
the perfection of the Almighty! He cannot, there-
fore, aim after too high a standard of moral ex-

cellence, and he will be certain of gaining ground
by the attempt. True, indeed, that he will not
fully and finally accomplish his object here-(the
very idea of' constant progression is opposed to such
a
result)-but he will seek after conformity to the
will of God, till he shall be called, in His own time,
to bid the world adieu, and leaving behind him
the incumbrances of dull mortality, to see HIM as
HE is, and to be transported into Hrs image.
The accomplishment of this object is to be pro-
gressive. The Christian must grow in grace, and
in the knowledge of his Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. Everything around him indicates ad-
vance towards maturity; and this advance is ac-
companied by increasing beauty of manifestation.
So also will his principles be deepened in himself,
and more
fully developed in action; the sen-
timent of love to God and his people will be ex-
panded into the desire of serving, and the fear of
offending Him; and the motives will be purified,
ennobled, and sanctified.
This advance will be continuous; there is this
only difference, that whereas the productions of
nature decay and wither, and enter into new forms
and combinations, the Christian's maturity does
not arrive on this side the grave ; the flower which
charms by its fragrance, and is succeeded by the
promise of' fruit, will only be fully ripened in the
atmosphere of' heaven, and in the meridian splen-
dor of the Sun of Righteousness.
It is true that the Christian, in common with
all other men, possesses a
compounded nature-

body and soul; and that the former has ceased to
be, as it was
originally created to be, a
willing
servant of the latter, because of the influence of
sin. Yet man is left without excuse, for he retains
the faculty of the will, and to this faculty the body
is subservient; therefore he is eminently respon-
sible for all his ofences. For, although when he
would do good, evil is ever
present with him,
this is, because he exerts so feeble a will, and pre-
fers listening to the voice of his passions and in-
clinations, rather than by a
painful efort to choose
the good and refuse the evil.
If it be asked, why this effort is paiuful, if the
power to make it formed a
part of the original
constitution of man, the answer is obvious; the
entrance of sin has perverted the will, and alienated
it from good ; so that to man as he is, every effort
after virtue is painful, and for two reasons: first,
the essential character of exertion is opposed to his
slot/zfulness; and secondly, he hast lost all good
disposition.
Yet it is manifest, that this does not diminish his
responsibility; but that, on the contrary, it fear-
fully adds to the amount of his willingly-abused
mercies and privileges, since the Almighty has
given him the faculty which he refuses _to employ.
It follows, then, that when the will has been re-
newed by Divine grace, the Christian is indeed
culpable if he do not hold in subjection the pro-
pensities of l1is animal nature; if we do not con-
stantly struggle agaiust its iniirmities, and if he
do not zealously cultivate all his powers, and

talents, and influence, and opportunities, to the
glory of his Maker and Redeemer.
In this onward progress, however, the Christian
soon discovers his ignorance and feebleness, his
helplessness and dependence on Him, who is will-
ing to save and to protect, and who has promised
to the sincere His Spirit to instruct, His strength
to support, and His guidance to lead into all truth.
But these blessings must be sought for, or
they
will not be obtained ; and he must hourly watch
and pray, lest he enter into temptation,--that is,
lest he listen to the suggestions and promptings
of his own
perverted bosom; he must maintain
a constant warfare of principle against a deceitful
heart; he must hold fast that which he possesses;
and he must be found faithful unto death-or he
can have no
ground for expecting a crown of life.
Not that this continued struggle gives him any
claim to that crown of life; but if the love of God
be shed abroad in his heart, he cannot be at
peace, except by growing conformity to the image
of Christ, his great pattern and exemplar.
One of the laws impressed upon locomotive life
is, that action is necessary to enjoyment ; and this
is truly exemplified in the Christian ; his essential
character is that of progress. But then it must be
progress in holiness-not mischievous action, or
even that bustling activity of business-like or
pro-
fessional charity, which is too often placed as a
substitute for the growth of moral principle.
Therc is great danger from this latter evil, in the

222 THE nncrrnocu. INFLUENCE
present day of' charitable exertion; and it becomes
the sincere to ask how far the motives for this ex-
ertion are
single and uncomplicated ; how far they
may be alloyed by a desire after the praise of men,
or of that influence which necessarily attaches to
prominent diligence in the great duty; and to in-
quire how far this exertion is simply the work of
faith, and labour of love-and how far it is com-
pounded ofinferior motives.
Should the result of this inquiry be, that the
grounds of activity are not so simple as had been
hoped-let not the inquirer on that account lay
aside this exertion, but struggle more
constantly
and earnestly after greater purity of heart. More-
over, let him reflect, that if he be not advanci
a retrograde movement has already commenced.
There is no middle point of indifference, in which
the centripetal force of the love of God, and the
centrifugal agency of the love of sin, can be so
nicely balanced, as that the character may be
preserved stationary; if the former principle of
love to God be not continually increasing, the
latter of aversionfrom Him will usurp the influence
and authority.
Against this influence, the authority of misrule,
the christian soldier is called upon to struggle
continually, and to maintain not only a defensive
but an
aggressive warfare; not contented with
the preservation of his own
standing, but gradually
gaining ground over the power of his enemies.
To this end are appointed trials and difficulties, in
ng;

order that the character may be aroused to exertion,
and energized to action, by being continually re-
minded of the necessity for such efforts.
Here, again, we trace another of nature's univer-
sal laws. So far as we are acquainted with them,
all the phenomena of the physical world arise from
a sustained counter-agency : the safety of the houses
we inhabit; our own erect posture and progression ;
the function of respiration, and even the circula-
tion of the blood; the flight of the summer bird-
ay, and the expansion of the minutest flower, de-
pend upon atmospherical pressure. Let but this be
taken away for a moment, and our houses crumble
into heaps of ruin; man's goodly form is prostrate;
progression is impossible; the sigh of respiration
dies upon the involuntarily-expanded lips; tl1e
blood congests in t.he sluggish veins ; the fluttering
wing drops powerless; and nature's humblest flower
withers and dies.
The same may be remarked of various other
natural processes: it is an universal principle:
action and re-action form the secret of life and
health; and neither the former nor the latter can
be maintained without their respective agencies:
without these all nature languishes ; her works are
interrupted ; and the harmony, and the beauty,
and the value of her productions are
destroyed.
So with the Christian: the trials of life, and the
difi-iculties of his way, are the sustaining counter-
agents for the developement and perfectionment of
his graces ; and without these his regular progress

is arrested, he becomes lukewarm, the fruits of his
principles are immature, and he no
longer forms
that beacon which should give light to the ignorant
and the wanderer from the right path, as well as
aford comfort to himself.
There is another principle which the All-merciful
has implanted in the bosom of man, by which he is
to realize this essential law of progressive perfec-
tion, viz. the faculty qf imitation-a talent of the
first importance to him, and to society at large. If
it be recollected, that to this faculty we owe the
continuation of spoken language, its importance
will be fully seen; but it may be further shown
by its effect upon society, and we
may trace almost
all the good and bad we meet with to the influence
of this principle: man is upheld in the right
way by the countenance of his fellow-man; and
for all the follies, and frivolities, and vices of the
age, he finds for himself excuses in the numbers
which have gone before him in the same way; so
true is it, that the influence of example is incal-
culable.
But the Christian has placed before him a most
perfect example; and it is held up for his imita-
tion, supported by all the most important sanctions
and all the highest hopes which can be given to
sinful creatures, to whom the means of restoration
to holiness have been vouchsafed ; even the perfect
example of Jesus C/zrist, who was a man of suffer-
ing, and acquainted with grief,-who encountered
the greatest trials and difliculties from a

world,_who took upon him our nature, and was
in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin,_who himse# bare our infirmities, and became
acquainted with all the trials arising from a world
which lieth in wickedness. Yet from the beginning
of his ministry to its close there was essential pro-
gress; and he became a
perfect example to his
people, that they might follow his footsteps, and be
made like him.
Now, the essential character of this progress,
which was consummated in the last sad scene of
his suffering life, was that of obedience to the will of
his heavenly Father; and this, too, will form the
scale of the Christiau's growth in holiness, and
conformity to the will of his Saviour, as well as of
the increasing beauty and augmented value of his
fruitfulness:-" His delight is in the law of the
Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and
night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the
rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his
Season ; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatso-
¢=ver he doeth shall prosper."
In fact, the Christian is perfect in proportion as he
accomplishes the design for which he was created,
viz. that of living to the glory of God. This ob-
ject is to be diligently pursued, but it can
only be
fully realized where sin and sorrow never enter,
and where all will be harmony, and light, and
love, and joy. Yet the glory of God will be
promoted by the nearest possible approach to
lgs original state of resemblance to the image of
od.

226 THE nncxrnocfu, INFLUENCE
To secure this approach, the character and con-
duct must be marked by consistency, beauty, and
utility, since these are the prominent characteristics
of the works of the Almighty. One of the greatest
injuries°to real religion arises from the want of
consistency in its professors. If the Christian
show himself as
worldly-minded, selfish, prejudiced,
without tenderness and compassion for the errors
and inlirmities of others,-if he be censorious, con-
ceited, proud,-if he be apt to take offence, and not
very careful to avoid giving offence,-if he be soon
angry, and prone to place an evil construction upon
equivocal words and actions,-if he be uncharitable
and revengeful,-or, finally, if he be so
yielding as
to give up princqnle in conformity to the world,
then will that world take knowledge of him as not
in earnest, or ashamed of his profession, or not a
wit improved by its supposed influence; for the
contrast will be drawn unfavourably to religion be-
tween himself with his unamiable manifestations,
and some other very amiable persons, who, wit/zout
tlzisprofession, manifest far more of the real spirit of
divine truth.
But if he be the converse of the character just
portrayed, all will be convinced of his consistent
attachment to principles which exhibit the second
characteristic of the christian conduct, viz. its
exceeding loveliness; and the combination of these
two (consistency and beauty) will form the com-
pleteness of the character, by the addition of the
attribute of usefulness; for it is impossible that he
can thus act up to his principles, and earnestly strive

after greater progress, without the devotion of all
his powers, and talents, and opportunities, to the
service of his Saviour.
The result will be, that as a
gentleman, a man
of intellect, a
literary character, a social being,
friend, and relative, and, finally, as a man of piety,
he excels, in every department of life; cwteris pari-
bus, his value will be appreciated, and the prepon-
derance will be in his favour; nay, by his delicate
tact, by his intellectual aptitude, by his literary
taste, by his refined feeling, and by the purity of
his thoughts, expressions, and actions, he will
command and ensure esteem, admiration, and love,
-he will present an attractive picture of the fruits
of Christianity.
And when the last closing scene of existence
arrives, he will meet the final struggle in peace,
without terror, in humble reliance upon him who
has conquered death, deprived it of its sting, and
given a sure earnest of' victory to those who re-
main "faithful unto death." His fast-shortening
hours will be peaceful, for he knows 'in whom he
has believed, and whom he has earnestly, though
feebly and imperfectly, striven to imitate, and to
whose finished righteousness and atoning sacrifice
he ascribes all the glory of his salvation.
It should be just remarked here, that this pre-
supposes the integrity and undisturbed state of the
brain and nervous system : for if these be suffering
from the direct or indirect influence of disordered
function, all the manifestations of mind will be dis-
ordered also. _

Q28 rms RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
In this onward reach towards perfection there
are obstacles to the Christian's progress. Perhaps
his physical temperament may present difiiculties
to be overcome ; for the actions, and thoughts, and
feelings of men, are influenced by the medium
through which they are manifested; and that me-
dium has been perverted from its first pure function
by the introduction of sin, and by that debasing
change which has rendered man
prone to evil.
Still it must be recollected, that in circumstances
of ordinary health the physical organ has been sub-
jected to the presiding mind, and that its function of
volition is- pre-eminent. Hence, a
powerful effort
of the will, enlightened by revelation, and sup-
ported by the promised strength and comfort of the
Holy Spirit, will enable man so to triumph over
physical infirmity, as that this shall form no excuse
for defective or erroneous action; he will be wholly
responsible for each deficiency or error; and he
must be stimulated to exertion-to the exhibition
of powerful energy of purpose, in order to supersede
the morbid influence. Physical structure, when
healthy, is placed under the control of governing
mind; and the latter is entirely answerable for the
government of the former.
Again, the Christian is living in society, and is
liable to fall in with its customs, to catch its
manners and habits, and to imbibe its principles.
But if it be true, that the customs, manners, habits,
and principles of the many are
opposed to the
sincere practice of Christianity, there will be some

fear lest he may be induced to comply with that
which his own better judgment disapproves and
disavows.
It is painful to differ from others, because this
very difference involves a tacit censure
upon their
opinions or conduct :
yet it cannot be wholly
avoided; the good 1nan's life must involve a cen-
sure
upon those wllo are
living without God in the
world. But he must take care not to give offence
needlessly, or his good will be misrepresented. He
must bear a decided testimony for the inflexible up-
rig/ztness of Christianity, and for his sincere belief
in its precepts; but he must do so with all that
principled tenderness and compassion, and that
courtesy of manner, which* will disarm prejudice,
and which will not reasonably excite a recoil against
that which is of infinite value. There is no fear
but he will vindicate himself completely from any
charge of latitudinarian belief, if he will only care-
fully study the manner of contending earnestly for
the faith. In fact, the christian gentleman must be
clearly traced ; and then will he win their way to
the heart for the truths of religion through so
pleasing a channel ;-there will be no
place for the
scoffer; and infidelity will be deprived of one of
her strongholds, while it will be practically shown
that the spirit of Christ`s religion is not opposed to
the growth of intellect, the expansion of the afec-
tions, or the cultivation of the taste.
There is, however, a still more formidable ob-
stacle in the route towards perfection: and this
consists in fashionable religion. The intrepid war-

230 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
riors, who had braved the rigors of Alpine per-
petual snows, and who had conquered all the
difliculties of their route, lost their energies when
exertion was no
longer required,-when they could
repose in luxurious indolence, and there were no
difliculties to be vanquished. So the christian
warrior is safe only in proportion as the warfare is
continuous, and as he is aroused to energy and
action by the present prospect of difliculties to
surrnount.
Hence, if he glide along the smooth and plastic
current of fashionable Christianity, there is a
danger of his becoming amalgamated with it,-of
his taking the same mould,--and of his being ac-
tuated by a
spirit which has been declared irrecon-
cileable with the Spirit fy' Truth. His great object
should be to lead those who go with him a certain
distance, to dive deeper into the requirements of
"all truth," and to show them that a
spirit of
meekness, humility, self-denial, purity of motive,
and preference of the will of God to their own will,
are indispensable ingredients in the christian cha-
racter, without which it cannot be complete. Let
not his good be evil spoken of; but let him not so
entirely fall in with the follies, and fashions, and
temper, and spirit of the world in general, as that
it shall be often dgficult, if not impossible, to detect
a difference between the Christian and the man
of the world, except in profession; for, alas!
if a
system of belief be the only difference, the
lot of the sincere man of the world is to be pre-
ferred.

or BODY AND MIND. 231
Another difliculty in the way of the Christian's
growth, is the want of adaptation in the mode of
instruction which he obtains to his own
peculiar
calibre of mind, and style of temperament. To a
refined mind there is something fearfully revolting
in the occasional coarseness and vulgarity with
which real truth is associated ; and it must be
some time before the former can be tolerated for
the sake of the simple-hearted goodness which it
invests and obscures.
There are also lesser distinctions which it is
important to notice, apart from this broad line of de-
marcation. There are minds of all dimensions in the
world, and brains of every varied quality. Therefore,
the same truths must be received through very diffe-
rent media; and, consequently, in order to produce a
similar eject, there must be an
adaptation of the
modes J impression to the prevailing modes ofmental
manifestation. The man of deep thought and of no
thought at all, the mathematician, the natural
philosopher, the metaphysician, the divine, the
physician, and the lawyer,-the man of polite edu-
cation and literary acquirements, the mere
gay
trifier, the precisely moral and the perfectly care-
less, the sceptic, and the enthusiast,-all these, with
many other niodifications of spiritual being, require
a different mode of stating the same truths, in order
to disarm them of the peculiar prejudices attaching
to their position in society. If, therefore, these dif-
ferences be not appreciated, and a similar plan be
pursued with all, an obstacle will be thrown in the
way of many. Yet even this thc Christian is bound

to surmount, and with the Bible in his hand, and
with the many spiritual privileges he enjoys in our
own happy country, he will be inexcusable if he
remain in ignorance or error.
The want of looking to the doctrines of Chris-
tianity as suiteil to the intellectual man and the
man of science, and holding them up as a
system of
belief only, has often proved an obstacle in the way
towards perfection. If religion be considered as a
mere
question of faith, dissociated from knowledge,
the spirit of inquiry is extinguished, and the be-
liever, satisfied with certain grand points of doctrine,
slumbers on in secure but most dangerous self-
complacency.
But this arises from a
partial view of Divine
Tmth, and should be counteracted, for religion is
addressed to the understanding as well as to the
heart; and the assent of the former will precede
the devotion of the latter; belief will be founded
on
knowledge, botlz being the gift of God, and
derived from the enlightening influence of his
Spirit; and out of this will arise an increasing
choice and preference of good; an
augmenting
aversion from evil ; love to God, and hatred for-.all
that is offensive in his sight; devotion to his ser-
vice; and benevolence to man.
°
The absence of a tender and enlightened con-
science will prove a serious difiiculty in the way of
christian growth; this, therefore, should be asked
of God, but it is also to be sought after. There
are those, whose knowledge of the boundaries of
evil appears to be deficient; there are those who

want the susceptibility which should warn them of
its approach; and there are also those who are
wanting in the necessary tact that would enable
them, when danger was discovered, to escape from
its contact.
In order, therefore, in such cases, to ensure
pro-
gression, these characters should seek to define
moral manifestations, to cultivate the impressibility
of their moral senses, and to improve by exercise
their aptitude, which sincere desire, earnest prayer,
and frequent danger, will alone enable them to ac-
complish.
In this pursuit nothing is to be accomplished
without waiting upon God for a
blessing, and nothing
is to be efected WITH it, if there be not at the
same time earnest and persevering efforts to walk
in the way in which we
pray to be led; to _follow
whither we entreat guidance, to be energetic where
we ask for strength, to be holy where we
implore
righteousness.
Finally, this progress can
only be effected by
seeking out and studying the weak and susceptible
points of the character. Every man is imperfect;
consequently, every man
possesses these weak and
assailable points; and christian watchfuluess will
be of little avail, unless it be directed precisely to
those points where it is most required. Ignorance
of self is the most fruitful source of deviation from
the holy law of God; and as the knowledge of a
disease is more than half its cure, so the knowledge
of our
liability to moral evil is more than half the
means of avoiding it. And having detected these

CHAPTER VI.
ON THE THEORY OF LIFE!-THE UNPHILOSOPHI-
CAL NATURE OF THE INFIDEL VIEWS CONNECTED
NVITH THIS HIDDEN SUBJECT.
VE now come to the question, What is life 5?-a
question often asked, and never satisfactorily an-
swered ;-a question about which much has been
written, and slender information given ;-a ques-
tion concerning which there is reason to fear that
much must still remain obscure, unrevealed, unex-
plored, and unknown, in the present state of our
faculties, and of our
knowledge.
Nevertheless, the questions, What is lyk? and
Vhat the influence of life upon mental pheno-
mena? are so
intimately interwoven with our
pre-
sent inquiry, that we dare not pass them over
without consideration .
The origin of living function is enveloped in in-
extricable mystery; and although various theories
of life have been given, it is better to allow that
they are all unsatisfactory, that at best they give
only the phenomena of life, and do not bring us ac-

236 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
quainted with the nature of the original principle,
of which we can
really only say that it is a
prin-
ciple superadded to matter with which it becomes
intimately blended,-that like many other first
principles, it has escaped our notice,-and that
all we
really know is from considering its effects.
But since we know that life exists when none of'
its effects are visible, and when all its functions
seem to be suspended, or at least to be carried on
without any visible agency, it is manifest that we
can form very little acquaintance with its nature,
from considering these phenomena; and that
therefore it is absurd to
say, that "
lyk is constituted
by the sum total fy" functions which any individual
can
pe1jbrm," when it is perfectly certain that life
exists where there is no
apparent function, and
where these functions, having once existed, have
become suspended.
We must enter into this circumstance a little
more in detail: and first, we must prove the exist-
ence of life where there is no apparent function or
phenomenon to distinguish it from positive death.
This is remarkable in every instance of suspended
animation, in which, as for example in the pheno-
mena of drowning, all the functions appear to be
extinct, and which, if left to themselves, would
speedily terminate in irrecoverable death. So
completely does this take place, that, but for our
experience to the contrary, we should say, Life is
gone: and there is no -criterion to ascertain those
cases which are recoverable from those which are
irrecoverable. Yet in this state of apparent death,

in the absence qffunction, life still remains, and may
be recalled: therefore life cannot be constituted
by the sum total offunctions, when it is found to
exist independently of all cognizable function.
It may, perhaps, be said, that life is restored by
awakening the function of respiration artificially;
and so it is, as a means of again setting the machine
in motion. But it is not contended that respiration
is life; it is one of the phenomena of life; and
whether it were this, or life itself, still it would
be manifest, that vitality might exist without it,
and therefore that life must be a
principle super-
added to, and co-incident with, organisation, though
not the result of organisation.
It may, perhaps, be said here, that respiration
is the mainspring of vital action, by touching which,
the sum total of functions were
brought into play,
and thus constituted life. But if so, what is it
which first touches respiration-which brings it
into play-which supports it during a thousand
vicissitudes, and which, in spite of ourselves, sus-
tains it against every ordinary obstacle, and against
the influence of volition? It is life, a
principle
superadded to, and independent of; the will ; con-
trolling function, but not constituted by it.
There are other cases of suspended animation,
as fainting of a
prolonged character-some forms
of hysteria, trances, &c., so like death as to have
been mistaken for it-in consequence of which
mistake, parties have been prematurely buried;
all these things proving that life can exist in-
dependent of function.

It is also certain that function may be carried on
after life is apparently extinct. It is allowed that
imperceptible respiration may be continued-a re-
spiration which cannot be detected ; it is also known
that parturition may and has taken place after
apparent death ; and it is supposed that conscious-
ness remains, in a considerable degree, after what
is called death, together with some other less pro-
minent actions of the body.
But if it be granted that function can be carried
on after life has been suspended, or is extinct, we
have another proof, that life cannot consist in the
sum total of functions; there are
merely certain
phenomena, or expressions of life-of lgfe existing
independently cy" these organs and functions-of a
princivle, not the result of function, but being the
prinznm mobile of these functions, and superadded to
them.
Connected with this hypothesis, is the observa-
tion of Sir Charles Morgan, that
"
the great chain
of created beings does not exist by an absolute,
but by a
proportionate harmony; the existence and
happiness of some individuals being thus rendered
incompatible with that of others. The cruelty of
this arrangement, so difficult to explain under any
dispensation, is a
consequence, like the other ac-
cidents of organisation, of the chemical properties
of certain substances, and of their relations to the
living forces, of which given animated arrange-
ments are susceptible." Then is added in a foot-
note,
"
It is, however, manifest, that no more is
lost than is given, and that what is evil to the

sufferer is positive good to the inflicter. Still every
sentient being, as in itself a whole, may justly
stigmatize as evil all arrangements hostile to its
own
well-being."
Now it is fully conceded, that the mystery of
animated being, and the laws of the Supreme
Governor, are diflicult to explain, because we know
not the terms and conditions which regulate the
Divine will; not more difficult ofexplication, how-
ever, than the origin of many of the chemical
phenomena of which Sir Charles makes so con-
siderable a use; not more diilicult than the thou-
sand processes around us, inexplicable to our
present faculties; since it is one of the humbling
laws of human nature, that on
every side there is
fixed a
boundary to our knowledge which is im`-
passable.
The "
cruelty" of this arrangement is set forth
in broad and distinct colours. Now this is either
unphilosophical or it is unchristian. It is unphi-
losophical, since if life has accidentally resulted from
the sum total of functions, there can be no law
against the accidental dissolution of those functions ;
and where there has been no moral principle in-
volved in the production of life, there can be none
in its destruction. It is also unphilosophical, be-
cause it supposes an
agent ; an
agent is unnecessary,
if life be the result of a
bringing together acciden-
dentally certain organs and functions; and if un-
necessary in the one case, it is absurd to suppose
it in the other.
But the supposition is unchristian, for if the

arrangement be cruel, the arranger must be cruel,
since no sum total of functions can deserve this
epithet; and if so, the Almighty Governor of the
universe must be cruel. It is needless to waste
time in proving this to be an unchristian sentiment ;
we shall therefore leave Sir Charles to the cheer-
less enjoyment of such a
hopeless and heartless
creed, and be contented to prove that the sentiment
is unphilosophical and irrational.
It is allowed, that the origin of evil is enveloped
in mystery; but it is an
unquestioned fact, that
goodness and benevolence everywhere mark the
works and the wisdom of the Creator, and chiefly
in those phenomena with which we are best ac-
quainted. Since such is the fact, with regard to
those processes which we do know ; and since we
are
confessedly ignorant of very many of the con-
current phenomena around us-is it not unphilo-
sophical to conclude, that cruelty marks an
arrange-
ment which we cannot understand ; cruelty being
the opposite to that beneficence, which we find
characterising those processes which we do better
understand.
Besides, we are
quite sure, that in many in-
stances, even in the loss of life, there isa prevailing
beneficence; and therefore we
ought to infer the
existence of the same in instances which appear
to us not similarly characterized. We say appear,
because we cannot be certain, with our
present
faculties, that things are as
they really appear to
be.

the dissolution of life, lyk be constituted by an
accidental arrangement of function, neither can
there be, if life be given by a creative power. For
if life be a
principle superadded to organisation,
there is no reason for its being given or withheld,
continued or withdrawn, but the will of t/ze Giver.
After all, this Giver has been supposed by the alleged
cruelty ofthe arrangement; and it is manifestly un-
philosophical to say, that a Power which can
give a
certain boon to an
organisation which, by the terms
of the proposition, has no choice, nor will, nor
agency in the matter, may not also dictate the laws
which shall regulate tl1e gift, and to which it must
be subject. There can be no
injustice in the with-
drawment of this gift, even if it had not been
penally forfeited, as we shall see in a
subsequent
part of this inquiry. Nor is there any proof that
the enjoyment of the ephemeris is not
fully equal
to that of the most long-lived creatures. As far
as we can learn, happiness and misery are
pretty
evenly distributed throughout creation; and the
latter has resulted, not from the will of the Creator,
who pronounced all his works to be very good,
but from that disturbing agency, which has per-
verted and defaced God°s works, and introduced
disease and misery into the world; were it not,
therefore, for this disturbing agency, good would
immensely preponderate.
It is clear, then, that no sentient being has a
right to complain of his lot; and that it is irra-
tional to talk of the accidental combinations of
matter into certain harmonious arrangements of

organs and functions, the sum total of which con-
stitutes life.
But we must glance a little further at the origin
of life. Life exists in the seed ; take, for instance,
the acorn, the fruit of the oak, which at its ap-
pointed period of ripeness, drops from its parent
tree, and presents no character which would induce
a belief (independent of experience) that it pos-
sessed any properties beyond that of being eatable,
and therefore capable of sustaining animal life.
But this fruit possesses lyk ; a
property, the exist-
ence of which can only be shown by future circum-
stances, but which is, nevertheless, inherent in the
seed ; and which may never be developed, or
may
be most easily destroyed. It will never be de-
veloped unless placed under favourable circum-
stances for awakening the dormant principle; or
it may easily be destroyed by exposure to a little
too much heat.
But if placed within the balmy bosom of the
earth, after a certain length of time, by a
very
beautiful process of nature's, the surrounding mois-
ture is absorbed ; life is developed ; it is supported
during its early stage by the food which itself
contains, till the young plant has acquired sufli-
cient power and vigour to procure its sustenance
from the roots which it sends forth; and from this
early and apparently insignificant origin, stands
forth by-and-bye, the monarch of the forest, slow
in its growth, but magnificent in its maturity, and
majesticin its decay.

lzfe, existing unseen, unknown, independent of
living phenomena, undeveloped except after a
lengthened process; and yet so existing, as under
favouring circumstances to produce the most re-
markable results. Here is life, anterior to the per-
formance of function; lyk, resulting not from
organisation, but mysteriously connected with it,
and which may be called into action when sub-
jected to nature's laws. We trace this commu-
nicated life backwards to the parent stem as the
immediate agent, in handing down the principle;
but if we ascend up to the first creation, it can
only
be derived from one of the primal laws of that
creation, or, in other words, as a
gift of that creating
Hand which called all things into existence, and
which gives life where He has so
appointed.
We take another instance. Life exists in the
egg; it may easily be destroyed by heat, or cold,
or neglect; it may exist for a
long time, if not
called into action; but if, once developed, it be
then neglected, it is no
longer capable of re-de-
velopement; even feeble life is extinct, and decom-
position ensues. Now in the egg there is no
performance of function-it remains just as we find
it, and will so remain if left to itself. But the
principle of life is there; submit it only to in-
cubation for a few hours, and the processes of life
begin, and if allowed to go on, will, through a beau-
tiful series of actions, result in the interesting little
chicken, which will perform automatic acts before
it quits the shell, and will enter at once
upon in-
stinctive animal or
independent life, as soon as it

has quitted it. Now there is nothing in the process
of natural or artificial incubation to give lyk ; it
exists beforehand, and has been only called into
action. But if so, life exists anteriorly to function,
and is the first link in the chain of developement
of those organs, whose functions have been con-
sidered as
constituting lyfe, whereas they are
really
the mere
expression of a result which has accrued
from life existing anteriorly to these functions.
Whence comes this life ? handed down, of course,
through the parent chicken-but as a
principle
superadded to organisation ;-superadded by whom,
but by the all-bountiful Author and Giver of life?
Again, we advance to the perfection of animal
life in man. Life exists in the original ovum, from
which the future man is to be developed; but it
presents no semblance of life-it performs no func-
tion-it possesses no
power of independent life.
Under the circumstances appointed by the laws of
nature, a new action is set up; dormant vitality
is called forth; the beautiful process of gestation
commences ; intra-uterine life is supported till the
full period has arrived that the little embryo is capa-
ble of maintaining its own life; then extra-uterine
life commences: it commences in the first auto-
matic act of breathing, and with it occurs a
change
in the circulation as wonderful as the developement
of life itself; the fcetal is exchanged for the adult
circulation, by the conversion of a
single to a
double heart; instinctive life commences, to be fol-
lowed as the organs become perfected by intellectual
life, to which may be also mentioned, as the crown-

ing point of all, moral lyk, or that which belongs
to the now
superadded principle of a
spiritual ex-
istence.
ln all this, however, it is clear that life precedes
the developement of organisation; and, therefore,
that it cannot be constituted by the sum total of
functions, which are the consequence of the de-
velopement, and which cannot, therefore, pre-exist.
Now it has been asserted, that the organisation
itself submits to a
progressive but inevitable altera-
tion; and that the moral constitution varies with
the physical structure. This is not true; and yet,
like most other errors, it possesses some truth, or at
least so much semblance of truth, as to give it cur-
rency, and cause it to be received as such.
Thus it is an
acknowledged fact, that there is
going on in the human body a constant process
of decay and renovation; that there is a
daily
change; and that, besides these changes, it passes
through the helplessness of infancy-the wayward-
ness of adolescence-the elasticity of early manhood
-the firmness of maturity-the loss of elasticity
but not of energy-of commencing decline-the
quietude and indolence of decay, and the feehleness
of age. It is also true, that in these various
periods there is a
corresponding difference of
mental manyfestation, and that we shall in vain
search for certain traits of mental developement,
in a
period of life unsuitable for their exhibition.
But it is not true that the one is a
consequence
of the other, or that the moral constitution varies
with the physical structure. If so, the former would

be dependent upon the latter; and man's moral
character would be the result of his organisation,
for which, therefore, he would not be held respon-
sible. The error consists in confounding the
manifestations of mind with the moral constitution,
and so
making the manifesting organ the moral
constitution or the spiritual being; whereas, the
spiritual principle or moral constitution is super-
added to life-is imparted to man-the actings of
which are seen
through the medium of physical
structure, but are not caused by it.
The moral constitution cannot vary; it appeals
to principles which are immutable, which cannot
fluctuate, or admit of change, according to the
alterations of physical structure. The spiritual
being is guided and governed by spiritual prin-
ciples, which admit only of spiritual life and
growth, and thus will be always progressive, and
will be under the influence of good principles, and
moral motives and incentives, as well as moral
sanctions and obligations.
While, however, the two are
essentially distinct,
they stand in that relation to each other, of organ
appointed for carrying on, and manifesting the
peculiar spiritual functions. And as
such, it is
allowed most cheerfully that the state of the organ
will have a
great influence, not on the moral con-
stitution which is unchangeable except by moral
inliuence, but on the manykstations rf mind which
are bright or clouded, direct or
oblique, excelleng
or the contrary, according to the state of health or
disorder of the said organ of mind.

Ve have thus a
gradation in the history of IM:
from the humblest individual of the cryptogamous
plants up to man himself, the highest created in-
telligence with which we are
acquainted. In the
former, the proofs of life are to be found, in all the
obscurity of function with which it is enveloped;
and as we
proceed upwards, we find a fuller up-
holding of the principle in the beauty and mag-
nificence of flowers and fruits, in the choice of soils
suitable to each; in their enjoyment, or loss of
enjoyment, accordingly as
they may have been
planted or not in a
congenial soil; in their sleep
or wakefulness, and that at particular hours; in
their love of light, their instinctive affection for
water, their choice of soil to root in, their altering
the direction of their roots from one that is un-
congenial to another which is more suitable in
their neighbourhood ; their enjoyment of warmth ;
the death from cold; their liability to disease;
and finally, the developement of something so
very
like a nervous
system, that, although it cannot be
admitted as such, yet from its functions it would
seem to be as a substitute, given as a
protective
warning on the one hand, as in the species of
mimpsa; or to secure its victim on the other, as in
the dionaza muscipula. _
The origin of a nervous
system is to be dimly
traced in the very earliest and most limited produc-
tions of animal nature, as in the invertebrated class
of animals, ascending by very slow degrees of pro-
gressive developement to that amount of advance-
ment, in which we find first very distinct sensation

man, in whom we
again find superadded some
new principles suited to his present position and
future prospects, as
thought, memory, reasoning,
re/iection-the power of literary acquisition, choice
of action, and conscience. _
In all these varying conditions, lyfe exists often-
times unseen, as the prime moving agent, and
the determining cause of all the phenomena which
ultimately are exhibited in connexion with' its
effects. In all these instances it seems to be pro-
ducing the effects connected with its continuance,-
not, however, as their determining cause, but as the
commissioned agent of the Great Governor of the
universe.
It is not their determining cause,-since, if so, its
effects would always be the same, instead of being
infinitely varied according to the habits and the
situation of the individual. The truth is, that the
nature of these phenomena is determined by the
creating hand,-in every instance, characterized
by infinite wisdom and goodness ; and the principle
of' life is given by him, in order to bring out, to
sustain, and to perpetuate the arrangements which
he has made.
In every instance, this life must be referred to a
hidden principle which we cannot comprehend,-
a
principle which has been conferred by the same
Almighty hand which created an

.
We have had a variety of theories of life,-
chemical, mechanical, mathematical, electrica1,--
all of which must have possessed some semblance of
truth, in order to give them currency for their little
clay of existence, yet all failing in this particular,
that whatever resemblance there might be in some
of these several phenomena to the phenomena of
living action, there was
always this essential dif-
ference, that no known power could give life to
any action, chemical, mathematical, mechanical, or
electrical.
With regard to the latter, it has appeared in so
many instances to resemble nervous influence, to
be capable of arousing the slumbering actions of
life under such extreme circumstances, and to
supply the place of volition to the several muscles
of the body; in fact, to present so
many analogies
with nervous influence as to be supposed to be
identical with it. We shall not attempt to destroy
these analogies-they exist: but even
granting,
what we could not grant, that electricity was not
only analogous, but also identical with nervous in-
fluence, yet nervous influence does' not constitute
life,-it is only one of its phenomena, (an important
one, it is true,) and requires life to characterize its
agencies, or to render it permanently effective, in
continuing any of the vital phenomena.
Here, then, we see that life does not consist in
one
of its phenomena, however important, any more
than in that assemblage of functions which we

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
have before shown do not constitute life. It is
allowed that the different functions of the body
are more or less dependent upon nervous influence.
and that, deprived of that nervous influence, their
function will be perverted, or
altogether suspended.
But this fact will equally apply to the blood, and,
indeed, more
strongly; for unless the nervous
structure gets a due supply of blood, it will not
furnish a
sufficiency of nervous influence to pre-
serve the health of the different organs. The truth
is, that both the circulation of the body, and the
function of innervation are vital phenomena;-are
necessary to the continuance of life, but are not
life itself ; they may assist its restoration, when it
is only suspended, but they cannot communicate
life, and indeed must themselves be set in motion
through its assistance.
So again with regard to the mechanical hypo-
thesis. No arrangement of machinery could give
life,-none could support it-none even could
imitate its phenomena. It might be suilicient to
determine this theory, merely to mention that
machinery possesses no
power of self-preservation,
or of self-restoration. It is set in motion by a
certain power, and may go on as long as that power
is continued, and as the several parts of the ma-
chinery remain unbroken, and in their ordinary
succession; but get one wheel wrong, and the
whole machinery stops, and can
only be again set
in motion by agency from the exterior.
But if in the living machine anything injurious
to life has taken place, or
any laesion has been sus-

tained, the first effort is an
attempt to repair the
mischief, to preserve the system from destruction,
and to protect it from the ravages of disease. In
accomplishing this, it is true, Nature some-
times overacts her part, and produces fever, for
instance, when she only intends a certain amount
of conservative action. But this is a
living process,
and is only another proof of the existence of life
as a
principle independent of machinery, and unlike
any other known agent. The truth is, there is
first machinery, which has no
power of selfirestora-
tion; and to this lyk is superadded, and with it the
power of self-conservation.
To this power, as distinctive from the mecha-
nical theory, must be added that of voluntary loco-
motion, and of volition generally. No power com-
municated to machinery will enable it to move
under the influence of volition, will enable it to
choose or select, to judge and to determine, ac-
cording to certain given circumstances, what will
be best to be done, or, more important than all,
to be left undone; a
property of which not even
the semblance of analogy can be found in mecha-
nical agency.
Not more
happy is the chemical hypothesis. For,
in the first place, life resists the changes which
result from chemical action. So far from the body
being influenced by chemical affinities during life,
it is actually the fact that life enables it to resist
their influence; and the chemical action and re-
action of the particles of which it is composed,
only become cognizable to the senses after dissolu-

252 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
tion has taken place, and decomposition has corn-
menced. Nor can the recomposition of these
organic elements again take place under the
influence of chemical agency; so that, in fact,
chemical agency has nothing to do with their for-
mation, continuance, or restoration; and therefore
it cannot form the origin of vital phenomena, or be
coincident with life itself.
It has been asserted that the process of secretion
is one of elective attraction, and consequently
under the influence of chemistry. But it is clear
that no chemical "
influence can imitate secretion,
or form from one and the same fluid different
products, as bile, tears, saliva, perspiration, gastric
fluid, and many other secretions of very dissimilar
properties; and so it is also clear that the office
of the secreting organ cannot be continued, unless
it be duly supplied with nervous influence; and
it has been already shown, that however there may
be some analogies between electricity and nervous
influence, there is no identity; and that the one
is perfectly incapable of becoming a substitute for
the other.
Moreover, there are other processes in nature,
such as
digestion, sanguification, alimentation, &c.,
which cannot be referred to chemical action, and
over which chemical agency has no influence.
These are
essentially vital actions; cannot be
conducted out of the body-cannot be imitated by
chemistry-cannot be hastened or arrested by its
influence; and so
long as the body remains in
health, and under common circumstances, are

altogether exempted from its agency ; while there
is an essential property in all, distinguishing them
from any analogous processes, a
property to be
termed vital, conferred only by lgfe, and inex-
plicable except by reference to this primordial
law.
Seeing, then, that the phenomena of life are
inexplicable upon any of these hypotheses, and,
moreover, that life exerts a
very peculiar influence
upon them, we must next inquire into the operation
of this influence on the morale, or upon mental
manifestation ; for assuredly, as it produces a modi-
fying agency upon the body, so does it also upon
the mind.
A very little consideration will show that medi-
tation, reflection, selection, association, judgment,
&c., are
dependent upon life; since it must be
clear that we exercise these faculties upon impres-
sions formerly received by the senses, assisted by
others, which we are enabled by research to pro-
cure at the moment; and that by a
just com-
parison of all three, we are enabled to decide.
Thus much before we arrive at action ; and when
we look to its phenomena, to the will, and to its
varied influence upon different parts of the animal
economy, and to the nature of that will, whether
energetic or
feeble, right-minded or
perverse, simple
Or
fabricated from various sophisticated views, we
shall see at once the influence which life must
exert upon the manifestations of mind.
lt must be recollected that in man there is a
spiritual as well as an animal life; and that the

former is snperadded to the latter, and destined to
live beyond it. By this man differs from, and is
superior to, the animals around him; from this
society takes its origin, with all its written and
unwritten laws, sanctions, usages, customs, and
principles, and from this arises the developement
of moral manifestation,-important in a social point
of view-but all-important as
regards the formation
of christian character, and the display of christian
conduct. One remarkable feature of this spiritual
life, because essentially different from any attribute
of animal life, is its susceptibility of improvement.
We have seen that progression is essential to its
very existence; and that while animal lg# is per-
fect for all its purposes from its original, spiritual
life is always on the increase; and that although
its manifestations may be impeded by its con-
nexion with animal life, and its alliance to the
material organs by which it is manifested; al-
though its operations may be checked by an im-
perfect culture of that organ; although they may
be perverted and obscured by disease; although
they may be dimmed by age, and suspended by
death, still the life is in them; still they are
making progress through every difliculty to that
day when the veil of mortality shall be drawn
aside, and, for weal or for woe, the spirit shall
stand disenchanted of its mortal coil, and shall
enter into fulness of joy, or sorrow inconceiv-
able.
In considering the phenomena of this com-
pounded life, it is quite necessary always to keep

in view the distinction between sensation- and
passion. Thus sensation is produced first upon
certain nerves, which are the conductors to the
brain ; by it the sensation is perceived, and
through it the impression is communicated on-
wards to the spiritual life, where, according to its
nature, and actual or fancied associations, it will
develope certain mental conditions, which are
called passions, such as
anger, grief, joy, fear, &c.
Now the influence of these passions upon animal
life is so considerable, and operates so
largely
upon its phenomena, and through them is again
reflected backwards upon the mental manifesta-
tions, producing very complicated phenomena, that
it is necessary to consider them for a moment; es-
pecially since they operate so
largely upon organic
life, that it has been supposed, though unjustly,
that the passions had their seats in the interior
organs of animal life, whereas it will be seen that
they only exert an influence upon those organs
through the medium of the brain.
For example, an
impression is made upon one of
the organs of sense, which is communicated to the
brain, and gives rise to anger: anger disturbs and
agitates the animal spirits ; the action of the heart
is accelerated, the blood is sent round its course
with an increased impetus; it is determined chiefly
to interior life, and the internal organs get an undue
supply, as well as that the momentum with which
it circulates is increased. Hence arise disordered
function, suspension of natural action, perverted
secretion, congestion, inflammation, and a series

256 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
of morbid actions by which the organs themselves
become points of consciousness; the disorder is
perceived by the brain; its capacity for intellectual
exertion is diminished, and the manifestations of
mind are altered.
Again, an
agreeable impression is produced,
which, in the same
way, gives rise to the passion of
joy. But the effect upon the body is very dif-
ferent; for, although its first revulsive action (if
the occasion be a
powerful one) is to drive the blood
back to its citadel, yet an almost immediate re-
action takes place, by which the blood is distri-
buted to the skin, and other extreme vessels, and
an
impression of tone or health is given to the
body, which renders it apt to do well, and fortifies
it against the impressions of disorder.
Upon the same principle, hope and all other en-
couraging passions, give firmness to health, and
uphold the bodily functions; while fear, grief, &.c.,
greatly suspend, or weaken, or
pervert those func-
tions. Sometimes, if their impressions be of a
very
violent character, or the constitution have been
previously enfeebled, or be of a nervous and highly
susceptible character, or be particularly prone to
disorder, or be possessed of a
compact originally
weak, or be exhausted by any long, and _especially
sudden expenditure of nervous
energy, animal life
may be extinguished by the vehemence of the im-
pression produced upon the mind, and through it
on the harmony of the bodily actions.
This generally happens when sudden, by an im-
mediate effect produced upon the head or the heart ;

either the vessels of' the former, are so distended by
the inordinate quantity of blood which they receive,
that congestion largely takes place, and by conse-
quent pressure, the function of' the organ is sus-
pended ; or some one or more vessels give Away; or
there is a considerable breaking up of the nervous
fibre; and in all these cases the phenomena of
apoplexy or
paralysis are
produced.
1
So, also, if the heart be feeble, its supply of
nervous
energy may be suspended by the violence
of emotion, so that its function may be superseded
at once; or
fainting may be produced, and the
heart may be incapable of resuming its action in
time for carrying on the processes of' life, (unless,
indeed, artificial respiration had been employed,
which in such cases it seldom is, though it might
be advantageously/,) or, from an overloaded state of'
its cavities, it is so
gorged as to be unable to act
upon its contents; or from previous thinning of' its
coats, or other disease, it may irretrievably give
way; and, again, animal life will be laid down
under the disturbing agency of spiritual emotion.
This, too, is a
frequent source of slow disease,
where the emotion has not been of so sudden or
violent a character as at once to extinguish life; or
where the original strength of' the organ has been
suflicient to enable it to make asuccessful resistance
against the immediate morbid impulse. And in
this case, perhaps, the phenomena are somewhat
different, and disorder of general function is the
first thing to be observed ; disease making slow pro-

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
gress, and disorganisation being the work of much
time. -
Now this change appears to act thus: a
painful
impression is made, is perceived by the brain, and
communicated to the mind, which becomes pre-
occupied by it, and makes in consequence large
demands upon the cerebral agency; then nervous
influence, which is daily produced in order to sup-
port the bodily actions, and the mental manifesta-
tions, is too exclusively taken up by the latter-not
so much, perhaps, for the purpose of manifestation,
as for the infinitely more
consuming (WCC of bearing
up under, or
concealing the constant misery of a
wounded spirit. Concentrated and hidden suffer-
ing is that which makes the largest demands upon
the brain. Now, the result of this is, that a certain
quantity only being daily produced, and an undue
proportion being given to spiritual suffering,
enough is not left to maintain the functions of
organic life in all their integrity: the supply of
nervous
energy to the respective organs, is irre-
gular, or insuflicient, or
perverted ; and disorder of
the animal functions is the consequence.
Thus, for instance, disease of the heart has been
of much more common occurrence of late years,
especially after any season of commercial distress,
or
political excitement. This was
very remarkably
exemplified after the revolution in France, and in
our own
country after seasons of great and unfor-
tunate speculation. Something may be allowed to
increased habits of observation on this head; dis-

orders of the heart were
neglected till recently, till
attention was aroused to their existence, by Senac
and Corvisart; but this will not entirely account
for the greater frequency with which these disturb-
ances are now encountered.
But it will be asked, how is this?- since the heart
is not a
voluntary organ ; since it is even indepen-
dent of the will; and since, therefore, it is
sparingly supplied with nerves? Alfections of the
heart are
generated by emotion in two ways ; first,
through the medium of the blood, and, secondly,
through the medium of the nervous
system; to
which might perhaps be added, a third mode of
influence, to be termed sympathy with other organs ;
which, however, resolves itself into another form
of nervous influence, only, perhaps, that we
may
not always be able to trace the filaments of nervous
connexion.
a. Disease of the heart is produced through the
medium of the impression of the circulating fluid
itself, which gives rise to uneasiness of the organ;
By being in too great or too small quantity;
By the force with which it beats against the walls
of the heart ; or,
By the degree of energy which it calls upon that
heart to exert to relieve itself of its oppressive load,
or to make up for the deficiency of its supply, as
well as
for its own diminished energy, by the fre-
quency and the irritability of its beat.
A slight degree of uneasiness only is at first
occasioned, then distress and embarrassment; then
intermission, and afterwards suspension, or inter-

ruption of action, till by repetition of these morbid
states, a
change of structure takes place, intended
to accommodate the organ to the new modes of its
action, but which is overdone, and which gives rise
to atrophy or
hypertrophy of its muscular fibres, in
one or more of its cavities, and to those gradual
changes which ultimately terminate in disorgani-
sation.
b. A similar result is produced through the
medium of the nervous
system. But how is this,
since its supply of nerves is so
sparing, and since
it is not dependent on the will? To this question
it is answered, first, that the importance of a nerve
in the animal economy is not to be measured by its
size; for not
only in this, but in other instances,
do we find small nerves
performing the most im-
portant functions, and exercising an
astonishing
power by their direct and associated influence;
this, therefore, does not form an
objection against
tlie degree of agency exerted upon the heart,
through the medium of the nervous
system.
In aid of this a
priori reasoning comes the ob-
servation of facts. Everybody knows that power-
ful emotions exert an immediate influence upon the
heart, and produce distress there, insomuch, that it
has been supposed to be the seat of the affective
faculties. This is absurd: the impression which
gives rise to emotion, whether from within or from
without, is first made upon nervous structure, and
is then communicated to the heart, producing, by
the violence of its action, or the frequency of its
repetition, that state of disorder which has been

mentioned, and which
occasigns a fresh focus of
morbid action, by the irregular and perverted distri-
bution of the blood, which gives rise to uneasiness in
all the organs which it supplies.
This influence is then more
extensively felt in
producing disorder of the general health. Thus, a
certain amount of nervous
energy is necessary to
the function of digestion; cut off this supply en-
tirely, and digestion is impossible: let it beinsufli-
cient, and digestion is only partially accomplished ;
let it be perverted, and a
depraved form of diges-
tion occurs; irritation and uneasiness of the
stomach are
produced, with acidity, and a
long
train of horrors: these produce a reflex influence
upon the brain, shown first in unwonted sleepiness
and inaptitude for intellectual pursuits, followed
closely by dreams, and uneasy and unrefreshing
sleep; next morning, the patient gets up listless
and feeble, and the bodily as well as the intellectual
functions are disturbed; headache and irritability
are the result; nervous energy is wasted upon
trifies, or worse than trifles: the hour of dinner
recurs; there is less power of digestion than the
day before; and this goes on oftentimes in a
rapidly-augmenting ratio, till the stomach becomes
the seat of chronic inflammation, and ulceration, or
other morbid action, which by slow degrees con-
ducts the patient to the tomb, the victim of his own
actions, and frequently the miserable and involun-
tary suicide of his own better feelings and prin-
ciples.

262 THE RECIBROCAL INFLUENCE
stomach itself to escape, yet the food it has par-
tially and imperfectly acted upon, is not fitted for
the next stage in the process of assimilation; for
the same reason, the bile and pancreatic fluids,
with which it should be now mixed, are either in
undue quantity, or of a vitiated quality; and con-
sequently their proper influence is lost; the elabo-
ration' and assimilation of this half-digested mass
are
incomplete; the process of sanguification is
imperfect; and under such circumstances nutrition
is impossible; the process of absorption goes on,
without being balanced by an
equilibrium of de-
posit ; the patient grows thin : and now what more
takes place? Even the deepening shades of morbid
action ; blood is supplied in insufficient quantity to
the brain ; nervous
energy is less and less perfectly
distributed ; various irritations, more or less severe,
take place in the body; the head is more and
more distressed ; there is less and still less aptitude
for intellectual pursuit ; there is a
greater prevalence
of the peculiar temperament, with diminished
power of the will; till the weakest organ of the
body fails, and disorder of general function is con-
verted into local disease, which, in its progress,
makes more or less inroads upon the constitution,
according as the diseased organ is more or less
necessary to the continuance of life ; till, sooner or
later, the system is worn out by lengthened irri-
tation.
Such is an
every-day example of the influence ol
the mind upon the body. The same fact is shown
by many little circumstances, which need only to

be mentioned, in order to secure the assent of
common sense to their truth ; witness the suffusion
of the countenance in blushing ; the shrunk features
and pale goose-skin produced by alarm ; the chat-
tering of the teeth, under fear and other nervous
irritations; the increase of various secretions from
mental emotion, as of the tears in sorrow, or the
bile in anger; the palpitation of the heart, under
almost every sudden emotion, the short and quick-
ened breathing of expectation, the oppressed and
stifled respiration of intense and harrowing emo-
tion; the arrested and almost imperceptible action
of breathless anxiety and expectancy ; the influence
upon the muscles of expression of the countenance,
alternately lighted up with joy, or worn with
anxiety and suffering, and the thousand varied
emotions which they are
capable of expressing;
the plump portliness of the man at ease, and the
extreme thinness of the victim of deep disappoint-
ment, or of any long-continued devouring passion ;
so that to be dried by grief-to be devoured by
remorse-to be consumed by sorrow, are not
only

actual bodily conditions: such is the influence of
interior life upon the body.

represents that state or condition of the mind of

towards his fellow-man; and extends into a thou-
sand ramifications of useful and valuable feeling
and action; a condition which actually represents

Q64 'ras nnclrnociu. INFLUENCE
of the sufferings, wants, sorrows, or destitution
of others, and the sincere desire to relieve tl|en.<
There is a
corresponding condition of the nervous
system, under which one action is physiologically
set up at one
part of the system, in consequence of
some other physiological action being established
at another part of that system: and what is of
more
importance to our
present inquiry, one asso-
ciated morbid action is set up in consequence of an
analogous morbid action going on at a distance;
this too is oftentimes linked in with many other
morbid actions, the connexion with which is very
generally untraceable, and therefore its existence
has been denied, or derided, or doubted, or disbe-
lieved, by persons wanting observation, and who are
not disposed to give credence to anything short of
demonstration.
Yet, as well might it be said, that there was no
sympathy in the human bosom; that man had no
regard for the sufierings of his fellow-men ; that he
could listen unmoved to the recital of others'
wretchedness; that he could have the power of
relieving their sorrows, without the will-without
the promptings of desire to succour the miserable;
as well might it be said, that this last and tattered
remnant of man's original goodness was extin-
guished, as that the analogous principle was want-
ing in his physical constitution.
Of late years, the extraordinary influence of the
nervous system in producing simulated disease, has
attracted no small share of attention; but the
knowledge thus acquired is scanty indeed, com-

pared with what it will one
day be, when we know
more of the nature and extraordinary agency of
that system, which links together every part of the
body into one
mysterious whole, and which is capa-
ble of presenting the most sudden and wonder-
ful transmutations. We shall often have occasion
to notice this influence as we
proceed; it is here
only necessary to put forth the principle, the
workings of which will be afterwards detailed.
This sympathetic action, which may arise in
the brain, or in any part of the living machi-
nery, extends to all the organs and functions of
the body, directly or indirectly, immediately or
remotely. It is this fact which renders it often
difhcult to trace back a morbid action to its origi-
nating cause, precisely because it has no direct
connexion with it; and perhaps has passed through
a considerable series of sympathies, before the
first disturbing cause has arrived at the present,
ultimate morbid action, which, however, never
would have existed but for that cause.
One characteristic of these sympathetic affections
is, that they are
involuntary, and may oftentimes
be removed by an effort of the will; a fact which
shows that one
powerful impression made upon
the nervous
system is capable of suspending or
superseding another powerful impression made
independently of the will, and is one most im-
portant proof of the supremacy of mind over
matter: the mind, that is, the will as a
part of
mind, triumphs over the morbid actions of the
body; and this affords a beautiful illustration of

266 'run RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
what we have before contended for, viz. the ex-
istence of a
supreme governing principle, distinct
from, but giving laws to, and acting through the
medium of; the nervous
system.
One other phenomenon of life must be here men-
tioned, which may be called constitutional predispo-
sition. This may consist in some
large develop-
ment of one or more
organs of the body ; or it may
depend upon the peculiarity of the nervous influ-
ence which is conveyed to them; or
upon the
nature of the nervous centre which receives the
impression conveyed from the organ to the think-
ing principle; it may be repressed by habit, or
augmented by indulgence; or it may exist at one
time, and not at another. But it will constantly
lead to thoughtless action, reflection over which
almost immediately produces regret, remorse, sor-
row, and repentance. Here again, is exhibited
the action of two principles; the one
bodily, lead-
ing to the-gratification of body, and often to a
forgetfulness of better motives: the other mental,
which reproves the individual for having listened
to, and acted upon, his organic suggestions; which
recalls him to his better self, awakens his princi-
ples, calls up his moral defences, enlivens his moral
sense, and carries him back at once to the divine
laws, which are given for the direction of conduct,
and but for which man would be a selfish demon,
and this world a hell of self-gratifying passion,
and of animal predominance without control.
But, God be thanked, we have also a better prin-
ciple warring against this influence of body, and

which carries us above its temptations, by the aid
of that strength which is from above, and of that
mind which has been given by God; and of that
grace of His Spirit which has been promised to the
sincere, that is, to him who seeks to be good, and
to do good-all the good he can.
Nevertheless, partly from original constitution,
partly from early associations, partly from educa-
tion, and partly from surrounding circumstances
and relations, we have to notice great individuality
of character, the predominance of intelligence in
one, of affection in another, of passion in a third,
of animal degradation in a fourth, and of peculiar
aptitudes in all these greater divisions of human
action and passion. lt is very important in the
cultivation of self-discipline, and in the formation
of character, to study these peculiarities, to repress
those which reason and conscience tell us should
be discouraged, and to bring out into stronger and
more prominent relief such moral qualifications as
will prove the antidote against those constitutional
or acquired peculiarities which will keep the
animal in due subjugation to the moral man; and
which will preserve his original dignity, or at least
restore it in some measure to that goodly likeness
whence it has so
grievously fallen.
That will be the best system, the most perfect in
its demonstrations, and the least prone to error
and obliquity, where these several actions are as
nearly as possible equipoised; where passion ani-
mates and kindles, and exalts intellectual life to
its highest pitch, yet at the same time without

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
escaping the government of the will; and where
judgment always effectually modifies and controls
emotions, that is, in fact, where the moral nature
is made to preside over and govern the animal,-
and yet where it is preserved from quietism by the
zest of that life which forms the mainspring of
action, associates man with man, and gives point
and energy to existence.
The various degrees in which this can be effected,
according to the modifying power exerted by
animal organisation over moral and intellectual
manifestation; and, moreover, the various degrees
in which it is influenced by the predominance of
mind, by the prevalence of the will, and by the
just government of organic life; and the conse-
quent preponderance of mind or matter, of the
Wiritual or animal life, of the morale or the play-
sigue; and the several peculiarities arising out of
this predominance constitute individual character,
and form the great and broad basis of human
action as it is, rather than as it ought to be.
It is, however, time that our attention were
directed for a little space to the termination of life.
This may happen from disease, or it may occur
from the general exhaustion and expenditure of
that modicum of life which has been given to
every one on coming into the world, but which
may be shortened by imprudence and disease on
the one hand, or
lengthened by care, and by the
avoidance of causes
tending to the more rapid
expenditure of the principle of life.

of existence in old age, it is not from the giving
way of one particular organ which would constitute
disease, but from the slow undermining of one
function after another, occasioning loss of power
and sensibility, disturbing the united harmony of
the economy, so that life is carried on
by a con-
siderable eH'ort, till the organs are no longer
capable of sustaining that effort, and death occurs,
perhaps even without a trace of disease.
In this case, it is found that the senses
generally
give way first, and that their results become
feeble and uncertain; while those ordinary im-
pressions which should have stimulated them under
common circumstances, no
longer arouse them
into action. A little reflection will show how
obviously this takes place. Perhaps the sight is
the first to give way ; and it is notorious how much
this is the case in the comparatively young ; after
this the hearing becomes less acute, and finally
very imperfect; the touch and smelling become
obtuse and indistinct; and all these cease to con-
vey slight impressions or accurate notices to the
intelligent principle within, through the ordinary
medium of communication. The taste, however,
remains somewhat longer, and is perhaps the last
remnant of animal existence; this is strikingly
shown by the longing, lingering enjoyment of the
pleasures of the table, which is too frequently met
with in old persons, and which is in them not
wrong in itself, but an instance of misplaced atten-
tion aud enjoyment.
It has been supposed by some that the survivor-

ship of taste, the most purely animal sense, was a
proof of how far man had departed from his great
original,-how debased and grovelling his nature
had become, that he should be stimulated and
revived by these sordid enjoyments, so ill suited to
an immortal creature, rapidly approaching the
term of his mortal existence, and preparing for a
new state of being, one of infinite holiness and
purity. But this is not true; man has quite
enough to answer for without making him re-
sponsible for what he is not responsible, and it will
be seen that this change really proceeds from
Nature's conservative wisdom-preserving that sense
which is chiefiy necessary to the maintenance of
life. The others limit intellectual enjoyment,
moral usefulness, and social duty ; but if the same
change had passed upon the sense of taste, in how
many instances would have resulted that gradual
"
dépérissement" ofthe body, which would terminate
in the extinction of life; and how beautifully has
Nature taken care to preserve that life, by render-
ing its nutrition a source of enjoyment !
In approaching natural death, the state of the
brain becomes an
object of considerable import-
ance, because there are persons who contend for the
improvement, ripening, and maturity of the men-
tal manifestations, as man
approaches the term of
his probation, and is about to drop the material
veil of his spiritual faculties. Here, again, the
truth is obscured by a desire to serve a favourite
hypothesis, which after all is perfectly true in
itself, but untrue in its application to certain cir-
cumstances.

It is perfectly true that man's moral nature is
essentially progressive, and that his spiritual growth
is exhibited by the control of his passions, the
watching over and conquest of his physical tempe-
rament, the subjugation of his evil propensities,
and the calmness with which he bears the visita~
tions of the storms of life, his equanimity under
trying circumstances, his benevolence towards
others, his desire to make them happy and good,
his abnegation of self, his diminished love for the
world, and increased desire after all that is pure,
and holy, and virtuous, sufficiently mark the moral
growth, the increased firmness, and development
of spiritual principle.
With this admission the spiritualist should be
contented; for it is as much as he requires. But
when he contends that the manyfestations of this
principle are more accurate, and lively, and bril-
liant, and more easily adapted to all the changing
circumstances, he asks for more than is true ; and
when he goes further, and asserts that the intel-
lectual fire burns brighter as it is drawing nearer
to its extinction, (with an
exception to be presently
noticed,) he contends not only for that which is not
true, but which is notoriously the contrary ; for, in
the first place, we have seen.the change which
takes place upon the senses, and it is allowed on
all hands that there must be a
corresponding paucity
and feebleness of the consecutive ideas.
Then the facts are, that literary labour becomes
irksome; first, the elasticity and tension of the
intellect are
impaired-the power of application is

diminished-the love of pursuit is decreased-the
perception becomes slow and erroneous-the ima-
gination, for a
long time giving way, becomes quite
extinct in old age-the memory of the immediate
past is obliterated-while that of scenes, and
events, and reflections long since passed, remains ;
the aptitude for comparison in order to inferential
reasoning, has been constantly wearing out; and
the mind comes to its conclusions, for the most
part, as the result of applied, and often misap-
plied experience; and therefore the judgment
becomes infirm and vacillating; and all these
things show, that the brain is no
longer that strong
and perfect organ which it once was, but that it
partakes the general decay of nature-a decay, in
fact, which could not occur, if the centre of the
nervous
system retained all its energies.
Two circumstances may be urged against the
truth of this position,_.{irst, the fact, that we do
sometimes see
extraordinary mental power in ex-
treme old age; and next, that there seems to be
oftentimes a
great degree of energy of the brain,
shortly before death takes place. Now, with regard
to the former, it is admitted to be true in some
solitary instances ; but these are
only extraordinary,
the exceptions from the general sequences of
nature, which confirm rather than invalidate the
rule. And as
respects the latter, it is one of those
phenomena, perhaps inexplicable, but which seems
to be dependent upon a
peculiar condition, pre-
ceding, and premonishing the setting in of dire
disaster about to occur in some
part of the system.

in which it is incapable of digestion, or
carrying on
its function,-in which, in point of fact, it becomes
dead. So with regard to the brain, this state of
excitement, this "
lightening before death," is the
intellectual craving which closely precedes the dis-
solution of the connexion between the spiritual mind
and its organ. So true is it, that the brain follows
in its history the usual changes of organic life,
while the spiritual mind rises superior to, and is
not affected by them, except in so far as its mani-
festations are influenced by the state of the mani-
festing organ.
Another proof of this condition is the feebleness
of the organs of voice, and of the power of loco-
motion ; both these, it is undeniable, become feeble
and uncertain; and why? but because they do
not get a due supply of nervous
energy ; the brain
cannot send them a suflicient quantity to give tone
to their actions; hence their feebleness and im-
perfection; hence the reaction of the brain upon
the muscles becomes weaker as man
gradually
draws nearer towards his long home ;
"
in the day
when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
the strong men shall bow themselves, and the
grinders cease because they are few, and those that
look out of the windows be darkened."
YVith regard to the functions of interior life,
these appear to survive the decay which has been
slowly creeping on the other organs of animal life ;

274 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
yet even here the work of dissolution is corn-
mencing and slowly carrying on the final pulling
down of this material tabernacle, which serves as
the temporary habitation for, and instrument j
the spiritual principle.
When an individual really dies from old age, it
will be found that the organs generally become
feeble in their function ; that decrepitude gradually
creeps upon all, without any one becoming the
prominent sufferer; the measure of life, which has
been originally given to each individual, is slowly
spent without being extinguished, and death takes
place, because the feeble flickering light of senile
life has no
longer power to be supported, and the
person drops from present existence, without having
become the subject of disease.
Very much more
frequently, however, general
death occurs from the giving way of one or other
important organ; from its function being sus-
pended by accident, or acute disorder, or some
structural disease. And this will be produced from
various causes ; first the ordinary predisposing cir-
cumstances and occasional causes of disorder; or
the occurrence of any of the acute specific forms of
malady by which human life is constantly threat-
ened ; or
by the slower process of organic changes
so
materially interrupting the peculiar function as
to take away from the constitution something
essential to its well-being, and producing that
degree of irritation, under the combined agency of
which, the system ultimately gives way ; and sooner
or later, according to the degree of importance of

the organ diseased, in the animal economy; and
according to the nature and amount of its degene-
ration or deviation from healthy structure.
Various causes
may have contributed to this
result; as first, the original feebleness of any one
organ; its tendency, whether necessary or acci-
dental, to frequent disorder of function; its want
of employment, and, far more
frequently than all,
the abuse of its function-its too great excitement
and consequent collapse, and diminished vitality-
an effect which always takes away from its power
of resisting disease.
This alteration of structure may be simple or
malignant: it may consist in too great or too little
growth, which would be simple disorganisation;
or a new structure may be developed of a cancerous
or tubercular nature, which, from the rapidity of
its growth or its deep injury to the system, or the
fearful certainty with which it destroyslife, is termed
malignant.
It will be easy to see how each individual may
become accessary to his own destruction by a want
of proper attention in preserving the harmonious
equilibrium of interior life; thus the gastronome
prepares the way for disease of the stomach by the
constant irritation and overloading of that organ;
the brain is enfeebled or exhausted by the habits
of every literary person; the liver gives way from
the stimulation of the drunkard ; the heart and the
stomach, too, are more
particularly under the in-
fluence of strong emotion, and exhausting melan-

276 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
choly, and so on, with regard to all the functions
of interior life.
And it will be remembered, that, begin where
you may, such is the order of dependence of one
organ upon another, that the absence or undue
performance of function of any one introduces that
disorder, which, unless timely arrested, involves
in its fatal influence every other, destroys the
cohesiveness of life, produces morbid sympathy,
gives rise to constitutional fever-and then ulti-
mately the organ dies, and involves its neighbour
and dependent organs in one common ruin.
Take, for instance, the stomach ;-the first
symptom of disordered action, perhaps, consists
in the slightest degree of uneasiness-not, certainly,
to be called pain-only just a centre of conscious-
ness, which teaches the individual he possesses a
stomach, whereas, if perfectly healthy, the function
of this organ would be carried on
unconsciously;
and probably with this condition there is a
frequent
tendency to acidity, so that the work of digestion
becomes laborious; and the food received into the
stomach is very apt to ferment, rather than to
digest.
This state may arise from various causes; and
it is very generally neglected. It may be, that the
supply of nervous energy is not suflicient to prevent
disordered action; and this, because the stomach
is asked to do more than its native power will
enable it to accomplish; or because the supply
of nervous energy is cut off, in consequence of the

brain not producing enough, (which, however,
would involve the idea of prior disorder of the
brain,) or in consequence of too much being ex-
pended upon some other organ or function.
Both cause and effect are
generally misunder-
stood; the patient rests in generalities; he has a
weak stomach, or his digestion is not good, or he
has eaten something which disagreed with him;
and the inquiry ends here, instead of really ascer-
taining what is the cause for this commencement
of evil; and so, the time for remedial agency is
suffered to pass unimproved; nature's apprehension
of evil is entirely thrown away; till the conscious-
ness becomes a
pain, and a
grand centre for the
radiation of morbid action; digestion becomes
more and more feeble; the food is not properly
assimilated ; the body is not
adequately nourished ;
the blood ceases to acquire all the red particles
it demands; the cerebral system is supplied by
blood which is not endued with a suiiicient amount
of vitality; the production of nervous influence
is rendered uncertain, irregular, defective, or even
irritative; every function languishes; every organ
is tossed from its equilibrium, and becomes less
and less capable of supporting life; disease ad-
vances, and the system is worn out by irritation,
if not previously destroyed by ulceration of the
stomach ; so also with regard to other organs, which
we cannot now
particularize.
How far, then, are the organs of interior life
acted upon by passion? How far may they be
said to be the seat of those passions? How far

278 THE ,RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
may life be said to be destroyed by emotion? It
has been asserted that the organs of interior life
are the seat of passion; and that we are to look
to the influence upon them for the cause of death
in all those cases when the event seems to have
been produced by emotion. It is more than ques-
tionable, however, how far emotion has any direct
influence upon these organs ; that it has an indirect
influence through the medium of the brain, none
can doubt; but unless it be direct, other causes
may operate intermediately so as to produce the
effect which may have been ascribed to the agency
of one cause, which, in fact, formed only a linh in
the chain of causation.
Now it has been asserted by Bichat, that death
from emotion, temporary as in fainting, permanent
and irretrievable as is this state when prolonged,
is produced first by the suspension of the action of
the heart, leading to the extinction of the function
of the brain. Now it is perfectly true, that tem-
porary death or fainting is produced by the loss of
action of the brain, arising from a defect in its
supply of blood; and thus the cause of fainting
seems to be the suspended action of the heart. And
so it is; but the question here presents itself,
"
What produces the suspended action ofthe heart?"
VVhy, it is somewhat tauntingly replied, Emotion/
Granted; but how is emotion communicated to the
heart ? How is a
lively feeling of joy, or sorrow,
or fear, or
suspense, or
any other passion given to
the heart? Clearly, only through the medium
of nerves which communicate everywhere, the

different sensations of the different and distant
parts of the animal economy. But these nerves
are a still earlier link in the chain of causation;
nerves
originate from, or terminate in, the brain.
Vhether, therefore, emotion is produced from with-
out or from within, its first impression is made
upon nervous structure; when originating from
without upon one of the senses; when arising from
within as a mental emotion, still made upon
nervous structure, and only capable of manifes-
tation through the material structure, the brain,
and therefore, in both cases, cognizable to the
heart, only through the medium of the brain.
But if the first effect be produced upon the
nervous system, and communicated to the heart,
then the heart's action is arrested or suspended;
the supply of blood is cut off from the brain, and
its function is entirely suspended; the latter is
only a reflex action, dependent not upon a
primary
mar/red action of the heart, but upon a
secondary
influence. Still, if fainting or
temporary death
be produced by a
suspension of action of the heart,
which is only a
consequence or result of another
action commencing in the brain, and communi-
cated to the heart, it can no longer be said that
death from emotion is produced by a
primary in-
fluence upon the heart, which infiuence has been
shown to be secondary and dependent upon a
pri-
mary affection of the brain. It is one of Bichat's
favourite dogmas, that the influence of the passions
is expended upon organic lgfe. If so, the passions
must have their seat in those organs, or
they must

not. If the former hypothesis be assumed, facts
on
every side prove the contrary,-show that they
have a mental origin, and, consequently, that their
influence upon organic life must be intermediate
and secondary. And, therefore, if they have not
their seat in those organs which are affected only
secondarily, it follows that the whole hypothesis
fails in its first and fundamental proposition.
Bichat supports his views by the analogy which
subsists between fainting, which is the result of
emotion, and the same state which follows disor-
ganisation of the heart; and infers, that as the
cause of the one is in the heart, so
ought also the
other. No reasoning can be more
inconsequential;
as if an
analogous condition of the organ might
not be the result of different and even of very oppo-
site causes; and as if there were not a thousand
instances to the contrary ; witness the flow of tears
produced by joy and sorrow-of appetite destroyed
equally by the former as
by the latter emotion;
of chilliness or peau de poule produced by very
opposite emotions-all, however, agreeing in the
one consequence of sending the blood to its citadel.
Again, Bichat supports his opinion by the asser-
tion that the distress which instantly precedes faint-
ing, is felt about the region of the heart, and not
about the brain. It is extraordinary, that Bichat
did not perceive how readily this was to be ex-
plained by the different sensibility of the two
organs, the one
being highly, the other sparingly
sensitive to lesion; and that, were not this sufli-

be accounted for by the distress occasioned in the
heart's action from the interrupted supply of
nervous
energy. And, after all, it is completely
answered by a recurrence to the fact, that the
heart can receive no notice of the invasion of the
peculiar affection except through the medium of the
brain. lt is puerile endeavouring to support his
views by the fact, that the actor in counterfeiting
death from emotion on the stage always carries his
hand to his heart, and not to his head, in order to
express the violence of his sufferings; as if this
were not sufficiently explicable by the prejudices of
education, which speak of the emotions of the heart;
by the faculty of imitation, handed down from
generation to generation; and by the admitted fact,
that distress is produced in the heart through the
intermediate agency of the brain.
l
Again, Bichat contends for his peculiar views by
the frequent occurrence of disease of the heart, in
individuals who have suffered long from mental
emotion. There can be no doubt that the distress of
the organ above alleged to be produced by emotion,
and the consequent interruption of its functions,
must tend to produce disease of the heart; and it is
a matter of recorded fact, that alter any great
political struggle, or commercial crisis, disease of
the heart is much more frequent than in times
when the placid brow of prosperity is not even cor-
rugated by a wrinkle of anxiety. But the same
will be said of the other organs of interior life,
particularly of the stomach, liver, and other abdo-
minal viscera. Nothing, therefore, is more

cult than to lix this as a PECULIAR morbid action;
whereas nothing is more
easy than to explain all
the mischiefs which arise to interior life from one
cause, viz. the defective supply of nervous energy
from that great nervous centre which forms the
emporium of organic industry, and distributes their
several power to work to different organs, accord-
ingly as
they may be differently circumstanced.
And even if this argumentation were to fail, which
it cannot, still there would remain the unanswer-
able fact, that under the influence of emotion
functional disorder and organic disease of the brain
are more common than similar states of the heart,
exactly in proportion as we should expect to be
the consequence of a direct rather than an indirect
influence upon the organ and its functions.
Again, the assertion that the cerebral system
exerts no direct influence upon the circulation, is
only a
proof how far the investigations of science
may be diverted from truth by the pre-conceptions
of some favourite theory, to the support of which
every thing must bend. And, in the present in-
stance, is not the crimson glow of shame produced
by an impression of mind upon the circulation?
ls not the heart palpitating under the breathless-
ness of expectation? Is not its action quickened
by joy ? rendered slower by grief ? until accelerated
by exhaustion? and made irregular by the alter-
nations of hope and fear, of anxiety, and the
relief of excitement from anticipation, of collapse
from disappointment, and many other varying
conditions? And shall it then be said that emotion

has no direct influence upon the circulation? Let
our
only hope and wish be truth; and we shall
perceive that a mantle of ingenious sophistry has
been thrown over this attractive theory. Bichat
goes on to state,
"
Break off and annihilate all the
nervous connexions of the heart with the brain, and
the circulation still goes on." How has this been
tried? Can it be tried, and the individual live?
And if not, is it not just as
argumentative to say,
Break off the connecting links of nervous influence
from any other vital organ, and its function re-
mains unimpaired? Yet is not this egregiously
untrue? _
Lastly, Bichat supports his position by one other
argument equally futile with the rest, viz. that
where fainting is not produced by emotion, still
that other disturbances of the heart's action are to
be found ; and that in all these cases the subject of
such emotion refers the uneasiness to the heart.
Now this would have been already sufficiently an-
swered by what has been before remarked, that the
heart has no cogmlsance of these troubles except
through the medium of the brain. But it is extra-
ordinary that so
great a
physiologist should have
Overlooked one almost universal law of morbid
action, and passion, or
sympathy, viz. that the dis-
order of one
organ is perpetually referred to
another; and that if the pathologist judged only of
the seat of disease from the locality to which pain
is referred, he would every day commit the most
grievous errors.

284 THE unclrnocu. INFLUENCE
Therefore, we conclude from the foregoing rea-
soning, that death, when it is produced by power-
ful emotion, is occasioned either by an action upon
the brain itself, or
through its intermediate agency,
upon some other organ essential to life; imme-
diately, or intermediately, therefore, death from
mental emotion is produced by the disorder of the
vital machinery, set up by the failure or the morbid
action of the brain.
Death, that is, general death, is, however, as has
been before stated, produced by the prior death of
some one organ, more or less important to life,
which by the arrest of its function interrupts the
whole. Let us illustrate this position by consider-
ing the lungs as that portion of the machinery
which has given way; and here, again, it will be
seen how all-important an
agent in the animal
economy is the brain; and however justly the
heart may have been said to be the ultimum moriens,
still it must be confessed that the brain is the
pfrimum mobile, and that the heart cannot exist
without the sustained action of that viscus.
It is well known that the chief function of the
lungs is respiration, and that this respiration is for
the purpose of converting the black blood of the
right side of the heart into the red blood of the left
side; and that this process is effected through the
medium of the air inspired, which parts with its
oxygen, and receives in exchange the carbonaceous
matter of the blood ; by which process it becomes
renovated, again fitted for going the round of the

circulation, and for maintaining that energy and
harmony of action which are essential to the well-
being of the individual.
Suppose, then, this function of the lungs to be
interfered with, and that either by a defect in its
own structure, or
by the absence of a due supply of
pure air, this change is not effected, the blood is
not decarbonized, and black blood is sent to the
brain; inasmuch as such blood is unfitted to sup-
port cerebral action, it becomes at once
irregular,
and soon ceases altogether. It must be recollected
that every kind of suflbcation produces its first mis-
chievous elfect upon the head, from the mere dizzi-
ness
arising from the inhalation of non-respirable
gases or contaminated atmospherical air, to the
fully-formed suspended animation of hanging or
drowning: a condition in which the sufferer is re-
called from death to life by restoring, it is true, the
function of respiration. But how? By inducing
artificial respiration, and in various ways rousing
the nervous
energy of the muscles of respiration,
till they will re-assume their action; so that even
here it will be seen that the nervous
system is the
great agent through which life is suspended and
restored; and it should also be remembered that
the effect of the transmission of black blood is far
more
prejudicially felt upon the brain than upon
the heart itself; and, therefore, under such cir-
cumstances, the function of the former ceases earlier
than that of the latter.
But the brain has a wonderful influence upon
the lungs! Let there be but a
momentary suspen-

sion of cerebral action, and the function of the
lungs is immediately interrupted; not that the
direct action of the brain is indispensable to that of
the lungs, but to the continuance of action of the
respiratory muscles, which are the chief agents in
conducting that all-important process. Let it be
always kept in view, that so soon as the action of
the brain is even momentarily suspended, so do the
muscles become paralysed, and breathing is at
an end.
Such being the fact, it is a
provision of nature's,
of exquisite beauty, and worthy of the highest ad-
miration, that these muscles are
only partly volun-
tary : a fact of which any individual may convince
himself by determining to hold his breath-that is,
to cause the work of respiration to cease. It is
well known that this can be done only within cer-
tain limits, and that after a little while, despite
every voluntary effort to the contrary, and in oppo-
sition to the firmest will, the muscles will act, not-
withstanding every obstacle, and respiration is
continued.
The wisdom of this arrangement is still further
shown by the action of the heart being altogether
independent of the will-at least, as a direct agent,
and under common circumstances,-for it will be
seen that the history reported by Cheyne of the in-
dividual who could die when he pleased was extra-
ordinary; that this power is not possessed by
ordinary individuals; and that even if it were, the
action is not direct upon the heart, but indirect,
through a
power to suspend or
supersede the law of

nature mentioned in the last paragraph, by which
respiration is recalled in spite of every effort of the
will to the contrary ; the exception only proves the
rule, which is, that the will has no
power over the
heart, and for the wisest of reasons,-that the
function of the heart does not admit of suspension,
without imminent danger to the individual. When
therefore, death takes place by the action of the
brain upon the heart, the first link in the chain is,
interruption of the cerebral function, loss of power,
and perhaps paralysis of the intercostal and other
auxiliary respiratory muscles, and diaphragm;
cessation of breathing, and of the renovation of the
blood consequent upon respiration; then, not only
are the cavities of the heart gorged with black
blood, but that viscus itself is supplied with black
blood, and black blood cannot support its vital
energy; consequently, its muscular libres become
feeble, and finally incapable of any action.
It is also possible that the interruption of the
regular supply of nervous influence transmitted
to the heart from the brain may have a considerable
influence in hastening this destructive process ; but
it should seem that the muscular fibres of the
heart did not require this influence to excite them
to action beyond, at least, just so much as
may be
adequate to make them duly sensible of the pre-
sence of their peculiar stimulus-t/w blood upon
which the heart is to contract, and which it is to
distribute over the entire system. But the heart is
a centre of nervous
sympathy of the first impor-
tance, and this sympathy can
only be kept up by

preserving it in close intercourse with the brain.
Therefore, it is probable that its chief supply of
nervous influence from the brain is for the purpose
of fitting it to carry on the important oflice it holds
in the moral and social economy of man; the
beauty, and value, and intrinsic excellence of this
arrangement, are
beyond the powers of estimation
of the human intellect.
All the other functions of the body,-digestion,
secretion, locomotion, and many others, are de-
pendent upon the brain generally, though interme-
diately. The only corollary we would now draw
from this discussion is, how easily and how con-
siderably the brain and its higher intellectual and
mental manifestations may be irritated, interrupted,
perverted, disturbed, suspended, or
destroyed, by
their distant organic irritations: the value of this
inference will be seen
in a future chapter.
Death is not the termination of existence-it is
the suspension of the present orde_r of arrangement,
and notwithstanding all that infidelity may allege
to the contrary, it is most nnphilosophical and
unwise to look upon this separation as the gate of
annihilation ; for even taking up the very inferior
position ofthe fate of the material body, the general
law of nature is, that when the particles of matter,
which now enter into a certain arrangement con-
stituting form shall be dissociated, they will un-
dergo a
change which prepares them for entering
into new forms and combinations. Pl/'hat that
change may be, it is not for us to say; but
there is no
philosophical reason against the ulti-

mate re-arrangement of these particles in a combi-
nation similar to that which has previously
existed: consequently, death forms no argument
for the destructibility of mind.
Mind, as we have seen at an earlier stage of our
inquiry, is a
property imparted to matter, so far as
regards the greater number of created beings; in
whom it is to be found according to their intended
locality, in a
greater or less degree of perfection,
from the earliest traces of a nervous
system up to
the most perfect developement of animal instinct.
But when the term is employed to represent the
mental manifestations of another order of created
beings,-of moral, religious, accountable man,-_
it is then spoken not simply of a
property attaching
to matter, but comprehends a
principle superadded
to animal matter, associated with, but not resulting
from, a certain order of nervous
system ; dependent
upon it for all its manifestations, but guiding,
directing, governing, these manifestations according
to its presiding WILL.
Over this spiritual principle death has no
power,
except that of suspending its manifestations: it has
no essential property in the present arrangement of
nervous fibres; and when that arrangement is dis-
severed, it equally exists in all its integrity, obscured
indeed for a time, during the interval of change
from one to another mode of existence,-a change in
itself not more wonderful than the chrysalis stage
of the hutterlly; and of the history of which we
/mowjust as much. Who would conjecture that the
chrysalis had life, till it was touched; and who

independently of experience, would believe that
the same
chrysalis would in a few days, or weeks,
or months, appear as a most beautiful moth?
The death of the caterpillar was no annihilation;
it was
only a
suspension of existence, and a
prepa-
ration for entering into new forms and more beau-
teous combinations. Just so, but 1) jortiori, the
only change upon mind in death, is the suspension
of its actions ; it is not even
pretended that its par-
ticles are dissevered ; and though we know not the
change which has passed upon it, or the nature of
its mode of existence during the suspension of
its connexion with the body, yet we have the best
reasons for knowing that it is not destroyed, and
for believing that, in some
way or other, to us un-
known, the consciousness of its existence is con-
tinued; and that that existence is productive of
happiness, or of discomfort to itself, according to
the moral position it shall have occupied on earth ;
according as it shall have yielded its noble powers
to become the slave of animal organisation, or as it
shall have claimed for itself the supremacy, and by
the help of God shall have governed the animal
propensities, and submitted them to the great end
of existence, the GLORY or Gon and THE Goon or
MAN.
The phenomena of death, therefore, afford no
argument to the materialist for the destructibility
of mind; much less to the moral philosopher, who
does not close his eyes to the existence of a
spiritual
principle superadded to matter, associated with it
for a time, as the vehicle of communication with

external nature ; and still less to the Christianphilo-
sopher, who looks to the page of Revelation, to
carry on his views beyond what reason can
impart;
and who cheerfully receives what is written for his
instruction, willingly acknowledging, that there
are
many things both in nature and in art, which
he cannot explain; and rejoicingly yielding his
assent to revealed truths, though they are
beyond
his reasoning powers, and revealed for this very
reason, that they are
beyond the powers of finite
minds to discover or to understand ; in which, though
beyond his comprehension, he finds nothing opposed
to reason, but, on the contrary, presenting, as
far as his eye can see, the same
analogies of
nature around him, with the phenomena of which
he is more
largely, though. still imperfectly ac-
quainted.
Thus, then, though the disorder of death has in-
vaded the goodly proportions of the animal frame;
though it has riven asunder its most intimate con-
nexions; though it has extinguished the lamp of
intellect, and suspended all the manifestations of
mind; though the material tabernacle once
tenanted by the immaterial spirit is lying in ruins,
and presents no traces of its former self,-yet that
spirit exists; there it is ready, and awaiting the
time appointed for its final change of being, to
enter into those forms and combinations which shall
be appointed. Of that time, and of those forms, we
lmow nothing ; but we believe that it will assuredly
come; and that the change will be one
infinitely
glorious and happy, extending all the powers of

region of perfect purity, where there shall be per-
fect knowledge and perfect happiness.
It has been asserted that the gradual decay of
mental power, and its renovation, form an
argu-
ment for its future existence. But this is not the
case ; it is dependent upon one of the laws of living
matter; it is, in fact, a
change of the mangfesting
organ, and not of the function manifested, or of the
presiding .spirit which gives laws to that function'
The brain is undergoing perpetual alteration, but
the same mental phenomena continue; the same
order of temperament, and the same consciousness
of identity exist, and give laws to the individual
character, and constitute it the same person, however
it may have been changed by circumstances-how-
ever it may have lost its elasticity by time-however
the angular points and asperities of early character
may have been worn down by contact, and some-
times collision with his fellow-men; and still
further, however much it may have been modified
by impression, exalted by circumstances, or
per-
verted by disease. Notwithstanding all these causes
and many others which act upon the brain, still
that organ continues the medium of mental phe-
nomena, just in the same manner as the liver con-
tinues to secrete similar bile, though every particle
of the secreting organ may have been changed
many times over.
The inference we would draw from these consi-
derations is, that if this be the case, the present life
should be a constant preparation for such a state

294 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
CHAPTER VII.
ON THE MENTAL PROPERTIESJ THEIR HEALTHFUL
TENDENCIES, AND DISORDERED INFLUENCE.
IN the progress of our
inquiry into the reciprocal
influence of body and mind upon each other, it is
necessary to enlarge a little on the healthy mani-
festations of mind, where all is. harmony, and
beauty, and comfort; and to show in what way these
manifestations are to be distinguished from the
mental phenomena of the lower animals, in whom
many of the same
properties are to be found, but
who want the superadded spiritual principle which
belongs to man in the order of God's creation, and
which constitutes him only a little lower than the
angels. It is necessary for us to inquire into
both these points, that we may the better un-
derstand and appreciate what are the morbid ma-
nifestations to be hereafter considered, and wherein
they differ from the defective manifestations of
animals.
ln the subsequent observations, it should always

be recollected, that according to the author's belief,
the manifestations of animal mind are
purely
cerebral; while those of man are the offspring of a
superadded spiritual principle, characterised, in-
deed, aye, even modified, and sometimes perverted,
by the cerebral medium through which they pass;
by its original affinities, by its education, by its
state of health and disorder, whether permanent
or
temporary, and by all the other agents which
promote or undermine the health and comfort of
the body; yet, nevertheless, so as that the spiritual
principle be held supreme, and that it be the
directrix of the will, the responsible moi, which
is to give an account of ALL the deeds done in the
body.
The great characteristic difference between the
two is, in the presence of thought in the one, and
its absence in the other; thought being an attribute
of that superadded spiritual principle, which aspires
after immortality; and which, in so
doing,
stretches out into infinitude; brings near and ap-
propriates the revealed realities of an unseen future
world; reconciles man to his present lot, by the
prospects of futurity ; compares things present with
things to come; anticipates and prepares for
coming joy or sorrow; and identifies man, not
only with all times, all places,'all people, but with
that which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither hath it entered into the heart of man to
conceive.
But do not brutes think ? We fearlessly answer,
No. An antagonist may ask, what then is the sum

of their mental manifestations? Our reply will be
briefly this : It is allowed that they perceive impres-
sions made upon the senses; that they recollect
these impressions, or, at least, that they are capa-
ble of being revived by circumstances connected
with the original impressions; and that there
appears to be a kind of reasoning upon these cir-
cumstances, a
reasoning which results in intelligent
action. The power of anticipation has been denied
to brutes, and with considerable justice; for it is
clear, that they do not anticipate coming events,
at least, by a
process of reflective reasoning. Yet
there is species of forethought or
prescience about
them-doubtless from impressions made upon their
more acute senses, which e-cape ours, and which leads
them to prepare for certain approaching evils, as
to seek shelter from the coming storm, to migrate
on the approach of winter to a climate better
suited to their habits and necessities, and to pre~
pare for the reception of their young. Yet in all
these circumstances, and many others, it will be
seen on examination, that the action depends upon
imparted knowledge or instinct, not upon originated
knowledge or reason.
To exemplify this offspring of animal intelli-
gence, take, for instance, the horse, an animal
which in his domesticated state at least is very
liable to the impressions of fear. He is scared
to-day by some
object which produces in him
apprehension, and the desire to avoid it, which he
does by starting out of the way, to the no small
annoyance of an unaccustomed rider, who in a

moment of thoughtlessness and irritation freely
applies the whip; and for this indiscretion he will
suffer perhaps for months, for on the following
day, when the animal has to pass the same
object,
there is the original impression offear, aggravated
by the recollection of the chastisement he had
received the day before; and it will be long
before this remembrance will be superseded by
kind treatment. Here, then, is the impression of
fear, the recollection of suffering, the expectation
of both evils, and the desire to
fly from them.
But this is not reason ; for if it were he would
have inferred that the chastisement was
given for
starting, and however unjustly given, he would
have endeavoured to overcome his apprehension,
and not by increased fear have incurred the risk
of more chastisement; and, moreover, he would
have discovered that the subsequent kind treat-
ment was to supersede his fearfulness, and to it he
should have at once
responded. Here, then, is the
great difference between instinct and reason.
But we have heard of an instance of recollected
impression which looks still more like reasoning.
A restive animal would not pass a certain spot,
for no
apparent cause but that he would not. His
owner determined upon the following method of
curing him. He sent his groom to the spot, with
directions to keep the animal there for twenty-
four hours. On approaching it, he showed the
usual vicious deterrninativeness not to proceed.
The groom quietly rode him to the spot, and kept
him there. After a time, he began to give symp-

toms of uneasiness, and of a wish to proceed.
But nol the groom obeyed orders; no corn, no
hay, no water, no stable, no nice clean bed to rest
upon, nothing but the constant monotony of main-
taining his position, employing only one set of
muscles, and sustaining the unvarying and mono-
tonous load of the groom's weight upon his back.
When the twenty-four hours were
accomplished,
he was taken home, and ever afterwards was cured
of the disposition to restiveness; and hence it is
inferred that he reasoned that the indulgence of
his evil temper had procured him so much incon-
venience that he had better not indulge it
again. But it is clear that the simple recollection
of the discipline would be quite enough to induce
him to pass the spot without his former restive-
ness; that is, there would be instinctive, but not
inferential action ; action the result of instinct, but
not the consequence of reason.
None can doubt the superior accuracy and extent
of information derived to brutes from their senses,
over the more
gifted animal man; and none can
doubt his superiority, evinced as it is by his
position in society, and by his supremacy over all
the inferior animals. Nor is this reconcileable to
the facts, to the history of the creation, or to the
wisdom and goodness of the Creator, except by the
simple truth of the perfection of brute sense and
instinct, or
imparted knowledge, to supply the
place of that acquired knowledge or reason which
man
possesses, and which renders unnecessary for
his conservation that superiority of notice from the

senses which is possessed by the inferior animals.
This, again, is exemplified in savage life, where
there is little developement of reason, and where
the senses are infinitely more acute than in a
more advanced stage of civilization. Here, there-
fore, again, we conclude that brutes do not
reason.
It appears, then, that the memory of the inferior
animals consists not in mental recollection, but in
the renewal of some earlier impression upon the
organs of sense, which is perceived by the brain,
and awakens into action certain other nervous
fibres, which have been stimulated beforehand into
associated movement; and that this awakening
leads to an instinctive act of volition, which for a
moment looks like consideration, reflection, reason-
ing, result, but which is, in fact, purely sensorial.
Then, also, the excellence of their senses, and the in-
stinct, which belong to their conservation, and which
are so
strongly marked throughout the whole of
nature's domain, will abundantly explain all that
looks like the anticipation of a
spiritual principle;
a
principle which they do not possess, a
principle
which is superadded to man, because he is a moral
and accountable creature, and which we are told
by Revelation (as it also commends itself to our
reason and philosophy) is in itself both immaterial
and immortal.
Thus, then, we are
prepared to understand a
grand distinction between the thought of man
and other animals, viz. that the former originates
or
possesses intuitive thought, which the other

does not. It is not pretended that man has any
other sources of obtaining information except
through his senses; but the point of difference is
this, that the inferior animal perceives the know-
ledge communicated through the senses, and
instinctively acts upon it; while man
equally,
though not so
accurately or
extensively, receives
his information through the senses; but then he
digests, elaborates, and appropriates that informa-
tion ; he lays it up for future use; he reflects upon
it; he associates and compares it with other no-
tices previously received; he rectifies former mis-
takes, or discovers new modes of appropriation;
he weighs the goodness of things in the balance of
reason and conscience; he looks forward to the
bearings of certain actions, to their future conse-
quences upon himself and others; he divests him-
self of selfish propensities in active benevolence to
mankind ; and, above all, he considers what is the
supreme will of the Governor of the universe, and
what will redound most to the glory of his Maker;
and then he comes to a
judgment, an
intelligent,
moral, and religious result, which has arisen
within himself, from the actings of the spiritual
principle, and from its power of ascertaining the
present and future relations of things; in a word,
from intuitive thought.
This thought is liable to disorder, another im-
portant distinction between the mental manifes-
tations of man, and those even of the superior
animals. We believe that their mental properties
are perfect in themselves, that is, adequate to the

end proposed ; and we have no reason for believing
that, during their waking moments, these are
liable to any material alteration. The brain con-
tinues its action; the amount of knowledge re-
mains the same; and the mental phenomena
present the same
phases, except as use and expe-
rience give a
greater facility of employment to the
faculties, in the application of their imparted
knowledge.
But man is liable to perpetual disorder in the
manifestations of mind; any disturbance of the
spirit will irritate the brain, and render it unfit for
the full and perfect performance of its function;
and every little bodily ailment will equally prevent
it from being the willing servant of the immaterial
principle within. A certain degree of cloudiness,
or dimness of thought, creeps over the subject of
these lesser ailments-he often knows not why;
there is an
inaptitude for mental exertions; a tor-
pifying stupidity grows upon him ; he thinks with
effort, and without result; and in this very impos-
sibility of continuing the activity of thought, the
greatest foe to literary activity, sleep, finds its en-
trance. The student rouses himself from its
withering influence, throws aside his books, and
thinks he will write. But, no! not an idea is
forthcoming; and after some vain attempts to
originate, his enemy claims the victory, and the
majesty of mind lies prostrate beneath the tyranny
of, perhaps, some
very little derangement, yet
enough to overturn the harmony and integrity of
the brain's action. And why is all this? but that

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
the finer machinery necessary for carrying on the
higher functions of intellectual existence is more
easily thrown from its equilibrium than those
grosser particles which belong to animal nature
only? Why is it, but that in proportion to its
complication, a
greater variety of causes act upon
it? Vhy is it, but that in the one instance, nature
has done every thing she could to perfect the
animal organisation; and that on the other, there is
a
superadded principle, originally perfect in its
kind, but upon which a
perverting change has
passed, so as to render it liable to a thousand ills,
both bodily and mental, from which spring all the
varieties of morbid manifestation. We do not
purpose to trace the operation of these causes into
the deepening shades of insanity and the cheer-
lessness of imbecility, through many stages of
mental suffering and bodily disturbance; it is
enough for our
present purpose to show that the
one is more liable to disorder than the
other, and
that the creature upon which the greatest pains
have been bestowed, nature's highest and most
perfect work, is in this respect less perfect than
the inferior animal tribes,-a conclusion which is
not to be understood, IF the position of man and
other animals be the same; only that man is more
perfct, which ought to render him less liable to
inqaerfection ,° but which is perfectly eaplicable upon
the assumption of his compounded nature, and of
his possessing a
spiritual principle over and above
the cerebral intelligence of his perfect neighbours.
But we

Charles Morgan, with regard to
"
relative sensi-
bility"--terms which he employs to denote the
keystone of his reasoning, and as
opening a
way to
the explication of mental phenomena. As far as it
is permitted to understand his hypothesis, it ap-
pears to be a material qfset, from that utilitarian
theory, by which every thing exists, according to a
certain ideal fitness ; and is, in fact, the result of
an undefined and powerful principle, which links
together all kinds of phenomena, and produces
them by that species of action and re-action which
arises from certain ill-understood afinities between
certain ill-defined particles; but which, placed
within a certain sphere of action, produce effects,
how or
why it is not sought to explain, but simply
because there are such particles, such aflinities,
and such a
sphere of attraction and repulsion.
Here, sensibility, or the power of feeling, is taken
up as the connecting link in the phenomena of
animal organisation, action, and passion, and is
employed in the room of that moral or
physical
fitness of things which we have just mentioned; and
the term relative explains the relation of the func-
tion to its organ, and of organ to function, in the
scale of animated being, in reference to immediate
circumstances, and to the end purposed to he ac-
complished. This attempt involves the explication
of all mental phenomena, upon the relative sensi-
bility of organic life ; and looks no
higher than to
a certain developement of tissue, leading to a
pecu-
liar, though confessedly an undefined result.
As in almost every other error, there is also in this

304 THE azclraocfu. INFLUENCE
a certain admixture of truth, which, to the fond eye
of the author, veiled his hypothesis with that cha-
racter, and was sufiicient to make it pass for truth
with the prejudiced or the careless; with those who
look out for support to preconceived notions, as
with those who will be contented to receive an
agreeable explication, without the trouble of asking
whether it is vraiseml/lable.
It is quite true that there is a most perfect
adaptation of organ and function to their relative
position in animal life; that the organisation is ad-
mirably adapted to the habits and instincts, wants
and actions, of the animal; that throughout crea-
tion there will be found a law of exquisite fitness in
organic machinery, to fulfil all the apparent duties
of the animal ; and that order and harmony reign
throughout the wide domain of animated nature,
in such way that each animal is perject, occupies its
peculiar locale, and does not interfere with the
actions of any other, except in so far as the univer-
sal principle of conservation renders it necessary
for one animal to live upon another.
But the great question is, whether this results
from a
primordial law of a Great First Cause, or
from a certain subordinate physical agent, termed
"
relative sensibility," distributed to different ani-
mals, in exact proportion to the wants of their
organisation, and the necessities of their vital
position; and being resident in a tissue, whose
developement in the various species is regulated by
the sphere of activity necessary to their PRESER-
VATION. Now, it is granted that this is true

with regard to the power ol' locomotion, but the
great question is, how far this is dependent upon
"
relatives ensibility"; and even if so, how far the
principle can be adopted as a universal law, to
explain the general movements of the animal
economy. It may be allowed that the power of
locomotion is dependent upon the will, and that
the desire and the will to move are also de-
pendent upon a certain state of cerebral organisa-
tion; and, therefore, upon a certain degree of rela-
tive fitness between the organ appointed to move
the muscles, and the muscles themselves, as well as
the thing to be moved by this process. The latter is
an indispensable link in the chain of relation; and
if the hypothesis of relative sensibility is to
explain
all the phenomena, the thing to be moved must
also possess some portion of the same
quality. But
it may be incapable of sensibility: therefore the
relationship may exist without the sensibility;
consequently, sensibility may be a mere
adjunct,
and though very agreeable, by no means
necessary
to explain the power of locomotion.
Admitting, however, for the sake of argument,
the necessity for this hypothesis to account for the
phenomena of locomotion, and its power of explain-
ing those phenomena, we next inquire how far it
can be adopted as a
general principle of explication
for other bodily and mental phenomena. That
there exists some Connexion between the perception
of an
impression made upon the senses, and the
thought which arises from it, or the act of volition
which is its consequence, we are free to allow; and

also that there is a connexion between organ and
function; and in the absence of a better term, we
would not even
object to that of relative sensibility.
But we
deny the proposition, if it be intended to
assert that this is a
necessary connexion; and that
the individual upon whom the impression is made,
may not, perceiving that impression, choose whe-
ther he will attend to it or not,--whether he will
allow its influence as a motive to action or not,-
and whether, admitting its influence, he will allow
himself to become subjected to its tyranny. In
fact, on this point turns the whole of the contro-
versy; if the hypothesis be admitted in its full
extent, man is not accountable for his actions; but
is, what he is constituted by the relative sensibility
of the cerebral tissues, and the sensorial tissue upon
which the impression is first made,-the creature
of impulse and animal propensity; but not the
intellectual, moral, spiritual being, which we see
him to be, and believe him to be.
Facts are
directly at variance with this supposed
method of explaining human opinion or conduct;
for in the best-regulated minds we see action pro-
duced, not according to the cerebral movement,
which has arisen from the excited sensibility of one
of the senses, or of some organ in direct relation
with its tissue ; but, on the contrary, we see reason,
judgment, moral and religious sanction, relative
and social ties, and many other of the better parts
of our
compounded nature, exert their influence to
oppose the propensity thus induced; we see these
motives triumph over the voice of passion, and the

moral, spiritual nature gain a
victory over the
animal; the agency of self-denial places the indi-
vidual above the reach of his organic suggestions;
and he stands forth a monument of thc wisdom of
the Creator, and of that goodness which sustains
his creature through the intricacies of moral proba-
tion, and enables him to act according to Hrs will;
for it must never be forgotten that man is frail and
feeble: he cannot will or act without the power
being imparted to him; but that power will only
be vouchsafed so
long as he wills and earnestly
strives to act.
What, then, becomes of this hypothesis of "
re-
lative sensibility?"--one which is capable of ex~
plaining a
very small series of phenomena, in a
way agreeable, perchance, to those who would have
it so, but unphilosophical, contrary to reason, and
to fact. It is, however, asserted by its promulgator,
that "
if the link between organisation and func-'
tion, in this instance, escape from observation, it is
a most vicious and feeble conclusion to suppose
that it does not exist." Ve fully admit this con-
clusion ; no one can fathom the link (for instance)
which exists between the actual impinging of cer-
tain rays of light upon the eapanded optic nerve,
and the formation of a
picture of that object by
the brain; yet none but a rash or
unprincipled
disputant would disallow its existence. But it is
extraordinary, that so acute a reasoner should not
have perceived that it is equally an absurd and
vicious conclusion to infer, that there cloes not exist
an
intelligent and immaterial spirit presiding over

this organisation, because we cannot trace the link
which connects matter with spirit, or the mode of
communication which influences both in a mutual
re-agency. It is admitted that a
mysterious inex-
plicable connexion exists between the sentient
ext.remity of nerves, and the common centre of
nervous influence in all animals: why, then, can
it be reasonably denied, that in the higher animal
man, there may be a still finer organisation,-a
spiritual being, upon which the higher manifes-
tations are dependent, and to which are referred
those organic movements, which in the lower
animals terminate in the brain, and in the produc-
tion of' automatic, or intuitive, or locomotive, or
sensual action. According to Sir Charles Morgan`s
reasoning, it were absurd to
deny this conclusion-
one, too, which is supported by the wisdom and
experience of all ages.
-
Now to adopt this mode of' argumentation, and
6
this conclusion, is not
'
to suppose that the cerebral
tissue exists without any precise and definite func-
tion; and that is wholly supererogatory in the
economy. It is, on the contrary, to assign it its
first place in the animal economy; not to attribute
to its fibres powers to which they can have no re-
lation; nor to invest it with a function, towards
which it can have no defined affinity ; nor to assert,
that it is wholly supererogatory. It is, on the con-
trary, to say that the brain is the organ of mind;
that its function is to receive and to convey to the
spiritual mind, the notices derived through the
senses from the exterior ; and to transmit, in return,

the creations of spiritual mind to that exterior
existence, in and through which social man is to
be found fully developed. The brain, is in fact,
the medium of communication with the interior
spirit, but it is not spirit itse#; the impressions
received _do not rest solely upon the cerebral tissue,
but are
conveyed to the thinking principle within,
and, after due elaboration, are again transmitted
exteriorly. lt is as the several varieties of the
senses; they receive; they transmit; they attach ;
they disperse; they reflect; they refract; they
converge, and otherwise diffuse the rays of light,
but they are not light itsef It is as the telescope,
the medium of communication with far distant
objects, but not the objects themselves. It is as
the microscope, the means of developing life, and
power, and activity, and beauty, where ordinary
sense was unconscious of its existence ; but it is not
the thing itself which it conveys. It is, in fact,
the servant of mind, fulfilling the highest possible
function in life, communicating with the highest
order of intelligence, and placing man in a due
relation to the noble past, and the mighty future;
yet being always in itself subordinate, and in a
healthy condition, yielding a
ready and cheerful
obedience to the majesty of mind. But surely,
then, it is most unphilosophical and untrue to as-
sert that with such a
position in the animal economy,
it has no
definite function, and that it is wholly
supererogatory in that economy! What organ,
may we ask, has assigned to it a more defined
place-more certain in its object-less assailahle

by disease? So far from being wholly supereroga-
tory, it is shown by the proposition, that no one
thing in body or mind can be done without its
intervention; all that is contended for, is, that it
is the servant of mind! Not that mental pheno-
mena are created by, and terminate in, certain
movements of its tissue, which would be just equal
to saying, that the air which wafted the feather on
its zephyr breath, or levelled in its fury the mo-
narch of the forest, was created by, originated in,
and received its power and function in each in-
stance from the thing which being acted upon,
-evinced the existence and the power, the aatherial
mildness, and the uncontrollable violence of the
agent. Thus, then, it should seem, that so far
from disparaging the organ, or undervaluing its
function in the animal economy, we ennoble its
destiny; since, far from tracing its termination
to a few dark years of brief existence in the present
state, we
ally it with futurity, and place it in its
due relation to a never-ending immortality.
But it is alleged, that in "
different subjects,
almost every part of the brain has been found in
a state of disorganising malady, without any deter-
minate corresponding derangement in the mental
functions." Granted: but what does it prove?
Not, surely, that brain is mind, for if so, how is the
function carried on, when the agent is clisorgamlsed ?
Whereas, if the brain be the mere medium of com-
munication, this is perfectly possible, and we have
only to admire the conservative efforts of nature,
by which, under such apparently diilicult circum-

stances, she contrives to carry on her operations
without any material interruption; so that, if the
fact of the brain carrying on its function under
the influence of disorganisation be of any value,
it is so to those only who look upon this organ,
not as an end, but as a material means for an im-
material purpose.
`
Besides, the very remarkable fact, that the brain,
although the centre of sensibility, is not in itself
generally very sensitive to morbid action, and that
it will bear large injury, and much slow disorgani-
sation, without great suffering, is another reason
why these slowly destructive changes are not much
felt, and another proof of its being a medium of
communication between external matter and in-
terior mind.
Again, it is said, not only is the brain liable
to disorganisation, but also to several varieties of
natural appearance; it is more or less dense-more
or less watery and soft; and yet these persons have
exhibited no marked difference in mental manifes-
tation, and have shown no
symptoms of insanity;
while after death in insane persons no alteration
of structure has been
i
perceived or detected. Now
all this may be perfectly true, but there are in-
superable difficulties in the way of the establish-
ment of this truth. In the first place, we know
not, as
regards our own
eye, what kind of fbre
is best calculated to carry on the cerebral functions;
consequently, we have no standard by which to
compare the most perfect structure.
Secondly, for the same reason, the minute traces

of altered structure would escape observation ; and
very considerable deviations from the normal state
might occur without discovery.
Thirdly, alteration of function by no means con-
stantly involves alteration of structure; on the
contrary, the former generally precedes the latter,
and oftentimes all its traces pass away at death,
and are no longer discoverable, particularly in
regard to the brain, of whose ultimate structure we
know so little : and,
Fourthly, little deviations from healthy function
do not fix our attention; an individual may be odd,
eccentric, passionate, of a violent temper, haughty,
perverse, given to frequent change, fond of some
peculiar hobby to excess, (who, indeed, is not ?)
singular and selfish; and yet all these conditions
may attach to the function, without any corre-
sponding structural derangement, with which, under
the circumstances given, we can be acquainted.
And the tendency of this argumentation is to
show, that, however the cerebral tissue may be
employed as the organ of mind or the medium of
mental communication, it is not the originating
cause of mental operations.
Again, it has been observed, "that inquiries
pursued beyond organisation, terminate only in the
wildest coigecture and the most
contradictory pro-
positions ; while the reduction of intellectual action
to the same laws as those which govern other
organic phenomena, affords a
positive and satis-
factory base for moral and metaphysical investiga-
tion." It is allowed, that this is a

subject, and must ever remain such, so
long as we
are ignorant of the nature of the ultimate cerebral
fibril, and equally ignorant of the connexion
which subsists between mind and matter. We
deny the proposition, however, that any inquiry
pursued beyond organisation must terminate in wild
conjecture; we believe not, if pursued modestly,
calmly, candidly, with a desire to investigate, and
not to make every fact bend to a
preconceived
theory. But we ask, are not the difficulties as
great,
as insurmountable in the way of him who termi-
nates his inquiries with organisation? Ve speak
not now of the lower or of the instinctive actions
of the brain, but of the elaboration of thought, and
reasoning, and judgment, and conscience, and of
the higher intellectual and moral attributes of man,
in his state of social and civilized privilege. How
is thought elaborated? Is it by a
process of diges-
tion, or secretion, or vascular movement, or attri-
tion of original fibres, or
fifty other suppositions,
of which each one is as
good as its predecessor;
and better, till it has been disproved? Is the
action of the brain chemical, mechanical, vital?
If the latter, wherein does it consist? In what
consists the repose of the brain, which is so neces-
sary to its well-being? What constitutes its morbid
sympathies? Why is its action enlivened by tea,
or annihilated by opium? Why is its greatest
brilliance oftentimes connected with feeble general
health? or with a
peculiar frailty of the organ
itself? No psychological conjectures can be wilder
than must be the answers to this string of questions.

But, if so, inquiries pursued beyond organisation
are not clzimerical, inasmuch as we are not here
more surrounded by ignorance than in searching
out the hidden causes and changes of organic life ;
and inasmuch as we may hope, at some future
day, to throw back the boundaries of knowledge
to a
greater extent than at present, and to become
acquainted with some of its unexplored territory.
If the opposing principle were acted upon, there
would be an end to physiological inquiry, inasmuch
as the study of the laws of function would be ar-
rested. Here is the liver, and there is the kidney ;
both are
supplied with nerves and blood-vessels;
and each has some kind of resemblance to the
other. Yet the function of each is dissimilar, and
this dwerence is in all probability dependent upon
the nerves with which they are supplied. But
the organisation of these nerves
appears to be of
the same character; and if we
go farther back-if
we trace their fibres and consider them as
ultimately
terminating in the brain, or
primarily originating
from it, we have in either case to inquire a
step
further than apparent organisation, when we observe
homogeneous fibrils executing so
great a
variety
of function; and it is absurd to say, that we should
not inquire into these functions, and seek to com-
prehend their agencies.
But, perhaps, it will be said, that inquiries into
function are included in what is understood by
investigation into organisation. Ve are
quite con-
tent to admit this; all we ask is, to study the

tions are
complex, not to stop short and consider
the history and effects of one function only, which
regulates organic life; but to let our researches
extend to that higher function, which portrays the
intellectual and spiritual nature; which displays
man, not only as an animal, but as a moral and
responsible being; and which places himin his own
order of creation above the animals, because he pos-
sesses a rational soul, which should govern and
direct the body, and whose commands are con-
veyed by its servant the brain. We ask not to
carry back these researches into the nature of
mind; it is clear that. we cannot comprehend it;
neither do we seek to explain the essence of that
great creating First Cause, which arranged the
laws that preserve nature in her present order.
These things are above our comprehension ; let us,
then, investigate as far as
possible the function of
the brain, and the actual connexion between mind
and matter. To say that such investigations are
futile, is simply equal to saying, that astronomy,
or the laws which regulate the universe, (and our
earth is a
part of that universe,) should not be
studied, because geology brings us
acquainted with
its interior structure or
organisation.
This is still further exemplified, by considering
another startling proposition of Sir Charles Mor-
gan's; viz. that thought consists in movements, and
is,the1-dare, obedient to the laws of MOTION; and
that this truth is demonstrated by thefact, that time
is necessary for its developement.

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
First, that thought does not consist in move-
ments.
Secondly, that it is not obedient to the laws of
motion; and,
Thirdly, that the fact of time being necessary
for its accomplishment is no evidence of the alleged
truth of thought consisting in movements.
First, thought does not consist in organic movements:
and this only is intended by the term in the above
proposition, since, if movements require time for
their accomplislzment it must be because they traverse
space. Let any unprejudiced and learned person,
look at the brain, closely packed as it is within
its osseous covering, and still more
closely invested
by its membranes; and let him ask of what kind
of movementsit can be susceptible; and then let him
consider, if the most visionary psychologist ever
propounded a wilder hypothesis-an hypothesis
which seems, indeed, to have been the organic off-
spring of Hartley 's vibrations and vibratiuncles.
The rapidity of thought, so
great as to exceed
all possible calculation; a
property, too, by which
it readily stretches out into the infinite future, and
comprehends all that is known of the past history
of the world, and combines with these its moral
relations to the Creator; and man's own
agency
in this great spiritual pageant are inconceivable upon
the principle of organic movements, in advance
and retrogradation, and laterally at the same in-
stant of time.
Still further, if thought consist in organic move-
ments, it follows, that there must be a

movements back to that situation, in which they
first received their centrifugal impetus. Now what
is this something? By the proposition, it follows,
that it must be a
something organic; but if so, it
is capable of demonstration; and what again, we
fearlessly ask, what is the organic power which
presides behind the cerebral tissue, and gives it its
movements? If it be said that this resides in a
still finer tissue, not demonstrable to our material
senses, we again fearlessly ask, what sets in motion
this still liner tissue? But we
accept all this rea-
soning from our
opponent, as evidence that there
is behind the cerebral tissue a
moving power-not,
however, consisting of organic fibres, but of the
spiritual being to which the brain is placed in sub-
jection, and which communicates to that brain all
the intellectual and moral power which it possesses,
and its life~giving energy to every part of the in-
tellectual, moral, and social character.
Hence it follows, that thought is not obedient
to the laws of motion. The astronomer may cal-
culate the movements of the heavenly bodies, though
so distant from our vision; but who can calculate
the movements of thought, with all its thousand
associations, any one of which may break the
original chain, and give new
shape, and figure,
and direction to its former bias. The engineer
will tell us how much time and labour will be

318 THE anclvnocn. INFLUENCE
necessary to remove a certain natural obstacle,
in the way of the accomplishment of one of proud
man's favourite schemes, almost to annihilate time
and space; but who can calculate the mental labour
which may be necessary to arrive at a
given result,
by labourers who differ so much in every part of
their material and spiritual nature. The mathe-
matician may acquaint himself with the laws of
motion in direct, and curved, and parabolic lines;
but is there any known law which accelerates or
retards the agency of thought, according to the
squares of its distances from the originally pro-
pelling cause, and which will enable us to calculate
even an
approximation to the amount of time re»
quired by such movements? There is none who
can
attempt this thing; and, if not, what becomes
of the organic movement hypothesis?
Thirdly, the fact of time being required for the
accomplishment of thought is no evidence of its con-
sisting in movements. It may be, that we know
not wherein it consists, and that the connexion
between the organ brain-its function, thought,
and its cause the immaterial spirit, is obscure, and
even unknown; but this affords no evidence ill
favour of an
hypothesis which explains nothing,
however agreeable it may have been to the fancy
of its inventor. Thus, in order to the elaboration
of thought, there must be a
perception of certain
relations of things; there must be a
comparison
of these relations; there must be reflection upon
them; there must be an
adjustment of their dif-
ferences; there must be a
judgment arising out

of a review of all these elements. But are dis-
tinct perception, comparison, reflection, judgment,
or
properties of matter, to be produced by organic
movements? Rather, are
they not all mental phe-
nomena, carried on, indeed, by the brain, as its
instrument, but set in motion by the immaterial
mind? And are there not then more difiiculties,
more
unphilosophical requirements, necessary for
the solution of these organic movements, than for
the far simpler and juster theory of governing mind,
directing the obedient cerebral organisation ? The
mental phenomena of themselves require time for
their several processes, and, if so, it is monstrous
to infer that thought consists in ORGANIC movements.
There are a few observations to be made in this
place relative to the senses, which will be important
in other stages of our
inquiry; and of these we
notice,
First, the remarkable fact, that the developement
of the senses is generally to be found in an inverse
proportion to the developement of intelligence;
that their state of greatest perfectness is, perhaps,
to be found in the higher order of animals without
reason, and that their relative importance is far
greater in savage than in civilized life ; that is, that
they are most perfect, where the acts and resources
of society are least understood-where the boun-
daries of knowledge are most limited-where there
is the least amount of reasoning power, or, as we
should say, where the animal predominates over
the spiritual nature.
But, since it is admitted by all, that we

increase our
knowledge or add to our stores of
acquired information through the medium of the
senses, it would be curious to ascertain why these
are strongest where reason is weakest; or
why
they should be feeble in inverse proportion to the
degree in which they are exercised; a fact which
seems
opposed to the general law of nature; by
which exercise gives the power of habit, and in-
duces facilities of action, which, but for this, would
be wholly wanting. This fact appears so
para-
doxical, that it is really necessary to seek a solu-
tion of the difliculty, especially as we are anxious
to make clear the distinction between animal and
spiritual life; and there is one of nature's laws
which seems to reconcile this apparent discrepancy.
It cannot he questioned, that the perfection of the
senses is greatest in animal life; next in savage
life; and is least where the amount of acquired
knowledge is greatest: and yet that the senses are
the only means for acquiring knowledge, the only
inlet to information, the only source of mental de-
velopement, and the most prominent and decided
part of the cerebral tissue. A little consideration
of the circumstances, will afford a solution of this
difliculty. In the iirst place, with regard to the
higher orders of non-reasoning animals, or of those
which ,have to trust for their conservation to the
amount of imparted knowledge-or instinct given
them by Nature, or Providence, or
by the God of
Nature and Providence; for where we
speak of
Nature, we always intend to go back to the
GREAT FIRST CAUSE. Since then the animal de-

pends for his conservation upon his imparted know-
ledge, and has no other means of awakening that
knowledge, except by a stimulus applied through
the medium of the senses, it was necessary that all
the information acquired should be concentrated
so as to bear upon these instincts; and therefore
the function of the simple brain of animals consists
in receiving notices from the exterior through the
senses, which awaken the conservative instincts,
and prompt to conservative action.
But where there is a more
complicated creature;
where reason is added to instinct; where a
spiri-
tual soul, with its moral and religious responsibi-
lities, is appended to a more perfect organisation;
where the knowledge acquired by the senses, does
not merely awaken instincts, but refers those in-
stincts to reason, and places them under moral
guidance and government; where there is a
power to choose the good, and to refuse the evil;
where the information obtained is digested, re-
flected upon, elaborated, and reproduced in new
forms of moral and intellectual combination ; where
the mind of man is carried backward to its high
original, and forward to its future destiny; and,
finally, where the creature so
placed, possesses a
revelation from the Great First Cause, giving him
rules of conduct, and fully setting before him his
moral and religious position in life, it becomes
necessary that the mental developements should
be in accordance with these high destinies, and that
the spiritual should preponderate over the animal
nature.

Hence the instincts of man are few and feeble,
and were
originally intended to be wholly subject
to his better part. How fearfully the contrary has
been the case! How has he fallen from his high
original! How awfully is he carried away by his
passions, from the gracious design of Him, who
pronounced him "
very good." The origin of this
wretchedness may be mysterious: the fact is un-
questioned, and is one of the deepest mournfulness.
But at present we have nothing to do with this sub-
ject beyond mentioning its existence ; our business
is now to account for the seeming discrepancy
which we have seen to originate in man's constitu-
tion, and to be required by his situation.
But if so, it will be allowed, that~ it was a first
ordonnance of nature, that the .spiritual should pre-
dominate over the animal life. In conformity with
this primordial law, that portion of the brain (if
such there be) which was allotted to the higher
social and moral functions, must be employed, edu-
cated, developed; or equally, if any new function
devolved upon the more perfect brain of man as a
whole, it would still require to be exercised, in
order to be developed. Further, according to
another law of nature's, the function would be
more perfect, in proportion to the amount of its
healthy employment; and this amount of healthy
employment will again be regulated by the degree
of nervous energy imparted ; and will be more com-
plete in proportion to its concentration and cen-
tralization; and will be less if more divided, and
less concentrated. Power is always lost by the

minuteness of subdivision of the parts upon which it
acts; and it is another of Nature's laws, that the
brain can
only produce acertain amount of nervous
energy; and that the intensity of this amount is
diminished in proportion as it is distributed; so
that if one
organ or function receives more than
its due allowance, others receive less, and are en-
feebled by the abstraction of their required quota.
So with regard to the original constitution of man,
the senses are less perfect, because the entire quan-
tity of nervous
energy is no
longer expended upon
them, is no longer devoted to organic life, but is
shared with it, for the purposes of intellectual and
spiritual life. All difficulty, all paradox vanishes
before this explanation; the wisdom of God is un-
attainted; the beautiful processes of nature are
vindicated; and man again stands forth in his
complicated harmony of animal and spiritual
being; of his present and his future existence:
whereas, on the mere supposition of his possessing
a more perfect animal organisation, than l1is almost
campeers of horses and dogs, there would be no
reasonable explanation of so remarkable a
pheno-
menon. Thus, as we proceed, the wisdom and the
goodness of God alike stand prominently and
boldly exhibited by the situation of His highest
creature, man !
Ve have already remarked, that the brain,
although the centre of sensation, is not itself sen-
sitive, at least in the degree which might be cal-
culated upon. Another curious property of this
organ and its dependent functions is, th.at although

324 'rue RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
the senses are the only inlet to real knowledge
from without, yet that mental phenomena are not
alway discoverable through their instrumentality.
It is very important to remark this, because it
proves the subordinate agency of the senses; they
may be employed in the service of mind, but they
are not capable of watching over the operations of
mind, or of contravening its intention. The senses
may be directed, governed, controlled by mind; but
they have no
power of themselves to direct, to
govern, to control. Hence the senses and mind are
not upon an
equality; they do not exert parallel
influences, but mind is paramount; one more most
important distinction from the inferior animals,
all whose actions are
governed by reports from the
senses.
It is not contrary to the arrangements of nature,
that subtle action and great power may co-exist
without the cognizance of the senses; on the con-
trary, it seems to be one of her constant principles,
that the most important actions of life are per-
formed without any consciousness of such action,
until it becomes morbid, and is carried on in
excess, or defect, or is perverted: then comes
a
point of consciousness; but then disease has
commenced. The wisdom of this arrangement is at
once perceptible; were it not so, man would be
constantly watching over his functions, to which he
does not now direct his attention, till they become
disordered-that is, as soon as
they require his
especial care.

the action of the atmosphere. We do not perceive its
pressure, yet it is very considerable, and by it our
bodies are sustained erect, the circulation of the
blood is carried on, our houses arc upheld, the
material fabric of the earth is preserved from crum-
bling into one vast ruin. The air is invisible, we
cannot see it; it is intangible, we cannot control
its movements; it is inodorous when pure ; its dry-
ness and its moisture vary greatly, and yet we do
not perceive it, except in extreme cases; we hear
the sounds which it conveys, but we do not discover
the vibrations which communicate those sounds;
and yet, notwithstanding the want of perceptible
agency in all these cases, the air does actually supply
the lungs, and support respiration, calorification,
and innervation ; it supports combustion ; it diffuses
odours; it gives rain; it wafts ships; it supports
the flight of birds, and preserves man and his sub-
sidiary arrangements from total destruction. So
the brain, unperceived, presides over all the func-
tions of the body: and the spiritual mind pre-
sides over and directs all the functions of the
brain.
The questions, what is sensation? how and
where is it produced? and how transmitted? are
so
many points which have formed rallying places
for the rival votaries of different systems. With-
out enlarging upon these debateable grounds, I
shall content myself with stating very briefly
the agency of these great sentinels and servants
employed for the defence and conservation of the
citadel of the MIND.

326 THE urzcirnocu, INFLUENCE
Thus the impression of exterior ohjects affects
the senses, their nerves, the brain, the mind. The
senses receive impressions; the nerves transmit
them ; the brain perceives them : and voluntary or
instinctive action is the regular sequence in animal
lgfe. In man we go one
step further; the sensa-
tion produced in the brain is taken up by that
organ; its activities are
developed; the mind is
called into exercise; that reflects, combines, com-
pares, abstracts, and finally obtains and employs
results; it determines and wills; transmits its
notices to the several organs of the body, which
now execute its behests.
There is a remarkable difference between the
functions of sensation, and those of interior life,
in the degree of exactitude of the one, and easy
mobility of the other. With a certain number of
exceptions, arising from disorder, during which
sensation is perverted, and its reports are not to be
relied upon, there is in general a
great degree of
regularity and constancy in their action; so that
while the functions of the heart, the stomach, the
lungs, are altered by a thousand different causes,
and oftentimes of apparently a
very slight iniiu-
ence, the sensorial function remains very much the
same, pursues the even tenor of its way, and is
not liable to perpetual changes; changes which
could almost threaten the continuance of personal
identity. It is not contended that healthful sen-
sation is not liable to the inroads of disorder, that
it is not fften perverted, or that it is not subject
to the modifying influence of many morbid causes ;

only, that it is not equally liable to change, and
that, too, upon the slightest possible occasion.
Thus a
powerful impression made upon the ner-
vous
system will quicken the action of the heart-
will suspend that of the stomach-will prevent the
secretion of bile-will increase some other secre-
tions-will annihilate that of the saliva, and will
produce many other great and important changes
in the animal economy; while a similar or ana-
logous influence will only give rise to a
slight
mod§/'ication of sensation.
Were it not so; if, for instance, the perception,
the memory, the imagination, the judgment, and
the will, were liable to all the mutations of organic
life, and that upon the slightest change of feeling,
what would be the result? The confidence of man
in his fellow-man, little as it now is, would be
entirely subverted, and /ze would have no reliance
upon himself; his consciousness of identity would
be obscured by his perpetual vacillations; his
opinions, now sufliciently variable, would then have
no resting place, but would be subjected to every
vital, social, and ephemeral change; and he would
become the sport of a thousand opposing impulses
or movements-perpetually carried about by the
winds of changing feeling, or tossed _on the waves
of contending passions; now debased to the level
of the brutes, and giving unlimited range to the
animal propensities, or seeking to soar above his
own level, and give, rather than receive, laws from
Nature; now allied to the highest intelligence, or
debased even below the range of animal- desire,

328 THE nsclrnocu. INFLUENCE
because there is in him all that is simply brutal in
the animal, in connexion with all the vicious power
of man's understanding.
Time, and frequent impression, or the repeated
exercise of sensation, has a
very large influence in
diminishing its acuteness and intensity; while, on
the contrary, it augments its accuracy. In early
life, perception is more vivid, and emotion more
intense; but by degrees the former is rendered
more dull, and the latter is decreased. In conse-
quence of this change, adult man is more himself
as a
reasoning creature; he has more power to
judge, to deliberate, to form a correct estimate, to
arrive at more
satisfactory decisions; so that in
Nature's wisdom, that which takes away from the
acuteness of feeling, adds to the range of intellect
and action ; and that which pares down the over-
ilowings of the heart, and keeps them within
bounds, augments the power of usefulness, and at
the same time adds to the will to do good for its
own sake. Man, who by the early impressions of
feeling upon a
sanguine and a nervous tempera-
ment, has been carried away into an ideal region
of fairy land, is slowly brought back to himself and
his true position in society, by the quiet operation
of this noiseless, constant agent, through impres-
sions frequently renewed, yet always diminishing
in the amount of sensation produced, till the
sphere of his judgment is enlarged, and he is
prepared for his final disenchantment from the
influence of sense. The period of feebleness, dur-
ing which the brain exhibits its perpetuity of

change and vacillation in extreme old age, is an
exception to the rule, does not often happen, and
when it does occur, is only from Nature's compact
being extended over a
larger period of time than
was intended, and therefore is not now to be taken
into the account.
It has been a
question which has occasioned a
great deal of discussion between contending parties,
as to where sensation resided, i. e. whether in the
organ which first received the impression, the
result of which was sensation, or whether in the
brain, or in some other portion of the system, to
which the intelligence of this notice was
conveyed.
The importance of deciding this question has been
much overrated ; since, after all, it is not of much
consequence whether the impression made upon
the organ of sense
produces there sensation, which
sensation is immediately conveyed to the common
centre the brain, in order that it may be still
further transmitted to the spiritual being within,
for whose knowledge and guidance the impression
has been made, and this sensation has been pro-
duced and transmitted ; or whether the impression
has been made upon the organ of sense, that organ
having no
power to distinguish, and so the impres-
sion has been continuously carried backwards to
the common centre; the attention of the brain has
been awakened; it perceives that an
impression
has been made; it defines and distinguishes its
nature, and then appropriates and employs the
knowledge thus obtained. It must be clear that
in either case the result is the same; an

is made upon a certain portion of the nervous
system; this is perceived by the brain directly or
indirectly, and is conveyed to the sentient principle
within, which issues its notices accordingly. lt is
a
point, therefore, which may be safely left to
future agitators to determine, though it must be
confessed that there seems no occasion for any
other than the simple theory, that the impression
is made upon the organ of sense, is perceived by
the brain, and referred to the spiritual mind.
Thus, wereit not for the percipient and secern-
ing influence exerted by the brain, the eye would
not see, nor the ear hear, nor the tongue distin-
guish tastes, &c., unless these were referred to
some other common and distinguishing centre;
and even then the results would terminate in
instinctive or automatic life; in the excitement
and gratification of certain appetites and passions;
and in the effort of locomotion, as connected with
such gratification; unless these notices were con-
veyed to the interior and presiding mind, which
acts upon them as a rational and intelligent being,
conformable to its high destinies, except some per-
verting moral cause shall have driven mind from
its proper centre, in the great God and Father
of all.
There is here a mutual dependence which it is
right to notice; the impressions made upon the
senses will terminate in no corresponding rational,
intelligent, moral results, unless they be conveyed
to the inner man; while, on the contrary, that
inner man, deprived of the notices conveyed to it

by the senses, would be shut out from information
and intelligence, would remain a chaos and a
blank, over which the deepest night of ignorance
and brutality would brood, neither awakened by
intelligence, nor animated by emotion, nor moved
by moral desire; in fact, it would be shut out
from the pale of intelligent and spiritual life; it
would be as in idiocy, a case not produced by the
absence of mind, but by the inaptitude of the brain
to transmit its manifestations.
An objection has been started against this trans-
mission, that the process being to be effected
through such a
variety of crossings, and net-work,
and interlacings, there cannot fail to be such an
interruption of notices, such jostlings of intelli-
gence to be communicated from various depart-
ments of the animal economy, that inextricable
confusion must be the consequence, so that no
defined information will be obtained. As if the
works of omnipotence and omniscience could be
traced by the twilight ray of man's feeble intel-
lect; or as if the pathway of the fountain of light
and life could be discovered during the all but
night of mau's darkling way; and as if this were
the only example in nature of complicated though
simple action,-complicated to us, because we can-
not understand it,-but simple to Him who has
appointed all things according to his boundless
wisdom and knowledge!
Reasoning apart, the one simple fact of the infi-
nite number of rays of light which are
given off
from luminous bodies in every possible direction,

332 THE nsclrnocal. INFLUENCE
and always, be it remembered, traversing space in
right lines, and which must, therefore, intersect
each other in every conceivable point; and that
this interlacing, to an inconceivable extent, is
effected, not only without confusion, but, on the
contrary, producing an effect of the most perfect
harmony; this one simple fact is a
safcient evi-
dence of the easy transmission of nervous commu-
nication through every part of the animal economy,
and a
sujicient refutation of the objection which has
been started against this arrangement.
The argument is thus summed up:-the objec-
tor says, it is inconceivable that the different
notices of the body can be conveyed through the
medium of the nerves, with their infinite variety of
crossings, and interlacings, and plexus, and
ganglia, forming so
many different centres, from
which are given off fresh channels of nervous
energy. The defender replies, Here is no difii-
culty, for rays of light traverse immensity in every
possible direction without the slightest inconve-
nience. Yet the rays of light, or, at any rate, the
medium through which they pass, are
undoubtedly
material. How much less, then, is the difficulty,
with the notices of nervous influence which are not
material, or which, material, are of a nature so
infinitely more subtle as to have escaped the de-
monstration of their materiality by the grosser ex-
periments which are
applicable to light and heat;
therefore there is no
difficulty in receiving the
opinion, that the material brain is influenced and
governed by an immaterial agent, that agent being,

in the case of man, his own
spiritual essence, the
immaterial soul.
We must just remark in this place, one or two
circumstances with regard to the perception of im-
pressions. It has been asserted, that perception
does not reside in the brain, and is a function which
does not arise from its peculiar structure, because
reptiles and other animals of the inferior classes
"
exhibit unequivocal marks of perception and
volition long after they have been decollated."
It is very important to mark the distinction which
exists between muscular motion, arising from the
irritation of nervous fibre, and that which depends
on the excitement of the same nerves in obedience
to the will; the former is a morbid, the latter only
is a physiological action. Besides, in inquiries of
this kind, it should ever be recollected, that the
nerves of voluntary motion are
dependent chiefly
upon the spinal brain ; and that, although they are
in communication with the intellectual brain, their
origin is from the spinal marrow, and are
only
so far dependent upon the brain, as to be its obe-
dient servants; hence, no
argument drawn from
their function, as attached to organic life, can be
fairly applicable to intellectual lgfs.
It is well known, that tl1e muscles may be ex-
cited to action by the galvanic aura in the lower
animals, some time after they have been decapi-
tated; but it is also known how small a
propor-
tion of their nervous
system belongs to the ence
phalic brain, how large, that which is spinal; and
although the fact of the production of muscular

movements is unquestionable, yet it is boldly
denied that these can, in any degree, be surmised
to attach to volition. As well might it besaid,
that the muscular twitchings which we see in the
butcher's shop many hours after the animal has
been killed and disembowelled, are dependent upon
volition. As well might it be said, that the mus-
cular movements which have been produced in
man
by galvanic irritation, (see Dr. Ure's experi-
ments,) and which have been made to simulate
a
variety of living expressions, as the fist clenched
in anger, the leg projected in rage, the countenance
distorted with passion, were the effect of volition.
As well might it be said, that in those cases of
paralysis of the lower limbs, arising from injury to
the spine, in which there remained no
power to
move these limbs, no sort of voluntary control over
them, yet in which the skin was so
exquisitely
sensitive that the patient could not suH`er it to be
touched, and in which violent involuntary motions
of the lower limbs frequently took place, were also
dependent on the will! A remarkable instance
of this kind lately occurred to the author, and,
amongst other arguments, helped to convince him
of the absurdity of those who refer these move-
ments to volition, and seek to take away from the
importance of the brain, as
being the chief organ
of perception. The fact is, that in all these instances
the perception of the impression is only apparent;
it is not asserted that there is no
perception in the
organ primarily impressed; but if there be, it is
originally derived from the brain; and the per-

ception as to any of the purposes Q" life, is imperfect
till it has been referred to the brain, the centre of
the nervous
system, and the great laboratory of
mind.
Now when any object has been noticed by the
percipient, it is either passed by, as having no in-
terest in itself, or
possessing no relative interest to the
individual, or at least not enough to be cognisable;
or it awakes attention, and developes that kind of
interest, which ensures for it a greater amount of
inquiry; it becomes an
object for scrutiny: if it
be material, an
acquaintance is sought with all its
forms, and connexions, and relative powers; if it
be moral, an
inquiry is instituted as to its prin-
ciples, their relative bearing, their influence upon
feeling, affection, action; how far they are calcu-
lated to do good, and how far they may be abused ;
how far they should be fostered or
repressed ; how
far they are consistent witlrthe moralities of our
nature; and what are their bearings upon the
great family of man, and upon the grand code of
Christian ethics to which we refer every part of
human action and passion. Then, indeed, man not
only sees and hears, but attends, looks, listens, ex-
amines, compares, selects, judges, and determines;
in fact, all his higher functions are aroused, and
his intimate alliance with immortality becomes
manifest.
And whence this interest, this choice, this selec-
tion, this preference of good, this dislike of evil, this
abnegation of self, this keeping under the animal in
order to exalt the spiritual being? Whence, in-

336 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
deed, is it but from that primordial law, which
subjugates the body to the higher spiritual prin-
ciple, places it under control, and renders it duly
subservient? This is the original constitution of
man ; this is the design of the Creator, for him who
was created "
in his own
image ;" this is the legiti-
mate inlluence of mind upon body; and for the
exercise of this influence each individual is minutely
responsible. That this perfect state is not now to
be found; that disorder has been thrown into the
manifestations of mind; that the first link in the
chain should have been broken or
perverted-snb-
jected to error, prejudice, hallucination; that at-
tention should so soon flag from fatigue, or be
diverted from its proper object; that so little in-
terest should be taken in what is right; that
passion should usurp the place of reason; that the
judgment should be so erroneous-the will so
vacillating, the determination so feeble-so easily
turned aside from the path of rectitude-so little
to be relied upon for perseverance; and generally,
that the man should exhibit so
feebly the linea-
ments of the Christian, is much to be regretted.
While we inquire into the causes of these things,
we shall find that some
physical conditions will,
in part, explain them; and that any and every
form of disordered bodily health will disturb mental
function; yet we shall equally find much which
it is impossible to account for upon this principle;
and which we can only explain by taking up the
scriptural account, that man has fallen from ori-
ginal righteousness, and that, in consequence, he

has become more
nearly allied with the unhappy
spirits, than as he was
originally intended to be,
"
a little lower than the angels."
But we must pass on, to`notice briefly a few
other of the phenomena of mind, and first of con-
science.
Conscience is a
principle, the power of which
is felt and acknowledged by all, and which pe-
culiarly distinguishes the rational from the animal
creation. Where there is no
responsibility, there
can be no room for conscience, which is universally
in man as an
involuntaryjudge of right and wrong;
which will often prevent action, or the indulgence
of thought, by its monitious; and which will pass
sentence upon conduct, almost before there has
been time to review it. Conscience may be more
or less enlightened and sensitive, according to the
amount of knowledge possessed by individuals,
and according to the moral culture it may have
received; or it may in some instances be rendered
fastidious by over-much care; or it may be blunted
by want of attention; it may be scrupulous over
things trifling or indifferent, while it may be om-
nivorous over barriers of real importance; it may
be superstitious over
appearances, while it may be
regardless of principles; it may most
unjustly
suffuse the countenance of innocence with the
crimson hue of shame, where no cause for shame
exists, and where the suspicion of its possibility has
been the only source of its production; while, in
other instances of seared moral sense, it will turn
the brow of unattainted defiance to the world, as a

338 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
covering to a secret history of heartlessness and
crime. Yet in all these cases of ignorance, of defi-
cient information, of perversion, or of crime, it is
still conscience-still the principle originally good,
but perverted to error, and imperfect from the na-
tural imperfections of fallen man.
Existing, however, always in proportion to the
light of knowledge, and the influence of truth;
and being, therefore, in very different shades and
degrees, it is still conscience. But it is a
faculty
very liable to be turned aside by physical disorder;
it is one which insanity often distorts, and which
the minor disturbances of the body very frequently
pervert, by producing a
degree of fearfulness and
hesitation, which render man uncertain in his
opinions, changeful in his judgment, and vacillating
in action: he becomes doubtful upon trifles; he
magnifies their importance; he wishes to do right,
but cannot discover what is right; when he thinks
he has attained to a
just judgment, he is tumed
aside by some veriest straw in the scale of moral
action; he becomes the slave of superstitious ob-
servances; he is al~ways desirous of propitiating the
goodwill of his neighbours, and of deprecating
the wrath of the Almighty ; yet he seeks to accom-
plish this object, not by the firmness and fearless-
ness of right, but by seeking to please ot/zers; and
in so
doing, is sure to make shipwreck of principle,
and of a
good conscience.
The frequent failure thus produced will occasion
remorse; and this again will give rise to a
very
unfavourable and depressing influence upon the

powers of life; for, unlike repentance, there is no-
thing to soften down or alleviate the pang of re-
morse, which is only the sting of guilt unatonecl, of
passion uncontrolled, of obliguity uncorrected. Now
it will often happen, and that, too, dependent upon
a
peculiar state of the nervous
system, that remorse
occupies the proper seat of repentance ; that whereas
the former should only exist, as the result of wilful
transgression still persisted in, or, at least, not re-
pented of, nor sorrowed after, nor
forgiven, it is
often to be found in the heart which has been
broken down under a sense of its transgressions,
in which contrition flourishes as a wholesome
growth, and the past has been deeply sorrowed
for, and the future is entered upon, in the fullest
intention to think right and to do right, in the
strength of Hi1n,~in whose strength alone things
remain as
they are, and by whom, equally, man's
life is sustained, and his good resolutions are helped
forward towards their completion. It is impossible
to conceive a more
deplorable condition than that
constituted by remorse,-its unalleviated hopeless-
ness-its entire destitution of aught to rest upon-
its complete abandonment of all that throws a
cheering ray upon futurity-its undermining in-
fiuence upon the several functions of the body, and
their reflex action in beclouding tl1e mental vision,
and adding the barb of despondency to the tor-
turing arrow of refiection, which places the sufferer
in a state of physical abandonment to which the
light of divine truth scarcely reaches.
It must be recollected, that conscience is a

340 THE neclrnocu, INFLUENCE
important mental manifestation for good as well as
for evil; indeed, the power which its exercise has
upon the physique, and the reciprocal influence
exerted by the latter upon the former, prove the
depth and extent of its manifestations in man's
compound nature. Natural religion may be said
to take its origin from this principle; the know-
ledge of right and wrong; the consciousness of
self-approbation ; when governed by the former, and
of self-reproach when acting under the influence of
the latter ; the choice, the voluntary choice of good
or evil, which is implied in the consciousness of
their existence, and the necessary following after
the one or the other ;-all show that there is in the
human bosom, a
knowledge of good and evil, a
power of choosing or refusing; and the consequence
of reward or
punishment, according as that choice
shall have been directed aright, or shall have been
warped and perverted from its original destiny. And
thisconstitutes natural religion; for in these ideas are
involved that of a moral Governor of the universe,
who dispenses justice, and rewards or
punishes
according as the actions of man shall have been
good or bad; not, indeed, according to their ap-
pearance, but according to the motives from which
they spring in the human bosom, whether from a
desire to please God, or to gratify self ; or, in other
words, from love to God, and benevolence to man,
or from a
disregard of both. To conclude in the
words of an
accomplished author,

cette instinct pur et celeste-cette science ainée
qui nous
distingue si bien des anirnaux, cette raison
par excellence, qui luit sur toutes les actions des
hommes, qui rassure l'innocent, qui agite le cou-
pable. C`est le juge qu`on ne

occasions its tremendous power over the animal
economy.
Intimately connected with the power ol' con-
science, is the habit of rtjlection; that property of
the human mind, by which the interior life exists,
and without which man is but the creature of im-
pression and of impulse; of causes
impressing from
without, perceived by the senses, and referred to
the brain, as the common centre of action and
passion. But in order to reflection, the notices
received from exterior life are laid up in store-
houses; the accumulated wisdom of' past ages and
of personal experience, is placed there in readiness
for employment. Man soon learns from his failures,
that he must not act from impression ; consequently,
when the forms of thought, and modes of action,
are
presented to his judgment, the mind is intro-
verted; it falls back upon its own resources; it
rg/lects,-that is, it bends its thoughts backwards,`to-
wards those materials for decision which it pos-
sesses; and from this reflected decision should pro-
ceed promptitude and energy of action. W`ithout
reflection, man thinks inadequately and acts in-

considerately. But there are morbid states of this
process ; man
may become too rfjlective a character ;
his associations with exterior life may be broken
up; he may be lost in his own
thoughtfulness; be-
come deaf to the impressions of exterior life, from
which his knowledge is to be derived; and while
occupied with his reflections, he may allow the time
for action to pass by. The contemplative cha-
racter, and, with a still deeper shade, t/ze pensive,
are morbid states of reflection, and as such are to'
be avoided. It must not be forgotten, that man
has an active duty to fulfil ; and while he will be a
very weak and a
very mischievous character if he
act without reflection, he will not be less so, if the
period for action, the light and life of energy and
exertion, be shrouded in the vapoury atmosphere of
absorption.
A very necessary aid to reflection, and indispen-
sable to its success, is memory. It is obvious that,
without the stores accumulated by the latter, the
_former would be abortive, because it would possess
no materials whereon to work; there could be no
efficient association, no comparison, no firm judg-
ment; action must be the result of impulse or of
prejudice; and the influence of reason would be ex-
tinguished.
What then is memory? We are well aware
that it is mainly dependent upon attention; but it
does not consist simply in a certain exercise of this
faculty; for. first, the memory will often be found
defective, where the attention bestowed has been
very great ; and, next, it will often be spontaneous,

and a vivid recollection of persons, or things, or
circumstances, will be presented to the mind, inde-
pendent of any traceable association; as well as of
events, which at the moment passed almost un-
heeded, and produced no sensible impression. For
the same reason, it is not the result of association,
though oftentimes aided by it, and apparently de-
pendent upon it.
Is this memory entirely a mental operation ? Is
it wholly spiritual-an attribute of the immaterial
mind, or
simply aphenomenon of cerebral activity ?
That it is not wholly mental, is shown by its inde-
pendence of the will, by its existence during sleep,
and by its being to be found very perfectly in
animals. There is, however, this marked difference:
apparently, in animals, memory is only to be
awakened by association, and does not lead to
reflection, or to reflective action. In both these
instances, therefore, it is probably dependent upon
the same cause ; and in both cases is the result of
a
degree of irritation of certain nervous fibriles
which have received an
original impression; and
which are subsequently aroused to their original
sensation, by any cause which again irritates these
fibres. The diiference is t,Zl3,°- that whereas in both,
memory is excited from the same cause; in the
simple animal it terminates in reproducing the
original impression, and in the renewal of that im-
pulsive action which was its immediate conse-
quence ; in man, it leads to trains of reasoning and
reflection, and to a multitude of mental actions,
which vary in proportion to the mental calibre,

and to the moral as well as intellectual grade,
which is sustained by the individual.
Memory, in man, may be increased or diminished
in power; it may be augmented by education and
cultivation; it may be decreased by neglect; it
may be perverted or annihilated by disease ; and it
may be subjected to several forms of partial loss,
which are
very tormenting to their subject, and
which should be sedulously guarded against. It
has several times occurred to the author, to notice
an
originally good memory become feeble and
worthless from the influence of morbid action in the
brain. Sometimes, it has been permanently in-
jured ; at others, it has been slowly recovered when
the morbid cerebral action has ceased. The term
slowly is used advisedly, because all changes in the
structure of nervous libre occur
very slowly and
almost imperceptibly; for, however rapidly the
function of the brain may be carried on, it is
certain that its structural changes are of the slowest
character; still disordered memory possesses a
power of resuscitation which is great, and which
often becomes firm and durable.
In investigating the causes of this loss of memory
from physical disorder, it will be seen that the
power of attention is first attainted ; and this will,
of course, entirely account for the impaired recol-
lection of immediate or recent impressions ; but it
will be found that the loss of memory and attention,
are not correspondent, co-incident, and co-equal,
which proves that the one is not precisely consecu-
tive to the other. And, also, it is to be remarked,

that the loss of memory extends to things which
had formerly made a
lively impression, which had
been attended to, and had been accurately remem-
bered up to a certain period, viz. that of the inva-
sion of physical disorder. It is, therefore, cerebral
disorder which introduces this overthrow of the in-
tellectual function.
It is very important to notice this fact, because, as
a
symptom, it will often lead to the detection of
that incipient cerebral malady, which might other-
wise have escaped notice ; and, also, because many
excellent persons annoy themselves, (and_by this
very annoyance increase their maladies,) by disco-
vering this defect in the memory ; and still more, by
frequently ascribing it to a moral cause, to defective
interest in objects of the highest pursuit; and thus
blame themselves as
incurring moral guilt, for
what is, palpably_ and plainly, physical infir-
mity.
On this ground, we
shalljust notice two or three
of the forms in which this incipient loss of memory
is to be discovered. First, its earliest trace is
visible in a diminished power of abstraction; its
subject feels that he has not the power of directing
and _fixing the attention, to any subject which in-
volves a train of argument, or consecutive reason-
ing, even although that reasoning shall attach to
the exact sciences, and be aided by a
diagram, or a
tangible model ; and, of course, much more where
it is to be fixed upon abstruse reasoning and
abstract science. Even in common and ordinary
reading, the patient will have to read, and read

again, and not be one
jot the wiser, or in the least
degree imbued with the spirit of his author: and
this, not, as often happens, from the mind being pre-
occupied, and the thoughts directed elsewhere, as
occasionally in the healthiest individual, but from
the power of directing the attention being absolutely
lost.
Absence so called, is a
very common cause of
forgetfulness, during which state, although the
impression upon the brain is perceived, and would
be acknowledged if inquired after at the time, yet
is not sufiiciently distinct and powerful to ensure
remembrance. This may be a mental condition,
in which either the impression is feeble, or the per-
ception is inaccurate, or the attention is not awak-
ened, or the mind is pre-occupied; in all which
cases oblivion will be produced: but it is also
frequently a
physical condition of the brain, in
which it is not fitted to receive a
sufiiciently
powerful impression to ensure remembrance. This
may be the consequence of various cerebral diseases;
or it may result only from functional disorder,
sensorial torpor. It is at all times a formidable
symptom; not that it may not exist sometimes
innocuously, but that it is the frequent companion
of disorganisation ; and then the fact of its existing
sometimes without injury, only renders the symptom
more formidable, from the danger of neglecting the
more important connexion with incipient disease,
under the delusive hope that it may not exist;
and this apprehension is increased by the fact, that
if the loss of sensorial energy be not remedied, its

shade is always deepening, though perhaps uuper-
ceived, till by-and-bye the melancholy truth is
revealed, by the patient being reduced to a most
pitiable state of helplessness and misery. Let then
timely warning be taken from the first discovery of
any kind of unwonted forgetfulness.
Sometimes an
impression is made upon the
organ of sense, but perception does notfollow.
The eye sees, the ear hears, the other senses are
legitimately aroused, but the impressions are in-
d-istinctly perceived, if perceived at all, and fre-
quently stimulate the brain erroneously, so as to
produce hallucinations, and many other forms of
cerebral disorder; and oftentimes they are not at
all noticed. The patient is in a kind of dream,
so that though some external impression has been
marle, yet it has not been perceived; the brain
either pursues its former trains of thought,
or
they may have been broken through, or modi-
fied, or
perverted, so as to have lost the cohesion
of their original impression, and to be made up of
a confused variety of cerebral irritations, aris-
ing from the number of nervous fibriles, which
may have been awakened into action, and which
run into confused and fantastic grouping, for want
of that regular and decided perception which would
have led to the exercise of sound reason and
judgment. In this way, involuntary trains of
ideas crowd upon each other, and usurp a domi-
nant situation, which takes away the supremacy
from mind, and hands it over to disordered brain,-
a
species of rebellion in the animal economy,

which requires close watching, inasmuch as it
borders very narrowly upon insanity. Let every
one
cautiously watch over himself, lest involuntary
thoughts be permitted to
enjoy the control of
mind; and, on the contrary, that all the mental
functions he kept in due subordination to that
master spiritual principle.
There is another state of cerebral disorder, deep-
ening as it proceeds, in which the patient is excluded
from the power of receiving impressions at all;
and this state probably arises from the more ex-
tensive disorganisation of the brain, and from the
greaterhopelessness of the case; a condition of
fearfulness, which is only noticed here in order to
ensure an earlier attention to the features of cere-
bral disorder, by which, and by which alone, the
more
deplorable and hopeless results may be
averted. Let, then, the first symptoms of un-
wonted forgetfulness-of unusual listlessness-of
unaccustomed indisposition to exertion-of dimi-
nished energy-of shrinking from application-of
retirement from duty-of omission of details--of
perversion of thought, or
reasoning, or
plans ;-
let all, or any one of these be early discovered,
and jealously watched, for there is no time to lose;
the brain must be saved, or the tomb will close
upon its possessor; or he will inhabit the still more
cheerless cell of insanity.
This subject must not be dismissed without acau-
tion : this state is one which will not generally bear
depletion ; it does not consist in too much arterial
action, nor in venous
congestion, but in torpor of the

nervous fibre, which willcommonly be augmented by
depleting measures.
Nothing is more mischievous
than to mistake sensorial loss af energy for vascular
loss qfbalance; and the distinction being easy, the
mistake never should be made.
There is sometimes a
partial loss of memory upon
particular subjects only ; but this may be accounted
for on the principles above detailed; it is only
necessary to remove irritation of the cerebral tissue
generally, to irritation of a small number of its
fibres, upon which the impression had been origi-
nally made; and the same
reasoning will apply to
the partial, as it has done to the general loss of
memory. It will happen frequently that this state
is accompanied by a
great degree of vacillation in
the reason and judgment; and it is easily to be
understood why the mind, when it has lost its
great prop, its main support, in producing unity
of design, and cohesiveness of action, feels that its
great stay is gone, and that it has only adven-
titious circumstances to support it: hence arises,
first doubt as to the correctness of judgment, and
then follow vacillation, and eternal change of pur-
pose.
But we
pass on to notice the imagination. This
faculty is known chieily by its creative power; it
has, perhaps, less to do with the realities of life
than any other mental manifestation, and it de-
lights to luxuriate in a
region of its own creation.
It does not yield obedience to any known or es-
tablished laws, and claims the privilege of sub-
mitting to no
authority but its own. These

creations are oftentimes at variance with reason,
though generally it is anxious to preserve such a
degree of vraisemblance as to invest them with the
air of distant probability-a connexion oftentimes
so
slight as not to be perceptible by ordinary
faculties. This faculty is exceedingly useful to
the writers of poetry and works of fiction; it is
constantly made the basis of the reveries of the
romantic young, and the foundation of that airy
structure in after life, which has received the
designation of castle building; it gives character
to the waking dreams of time, and deeply tinge
the intercourse of society-always casting a glow-
ing colour over
futurity, and giving its attractive
hues to the new combinations of social life and
circumstances, which arise out of its several
changes, and from each succeeding exigency. To
render its exercise safe, it is necessary that it should
be guided and controlled by a sound judgment,
and then it will give energy and life to the cha-
racter; but if this judgment be wanting, it will
render it Highty and uncertain in its movements.
This faculty has a
large influence upon disease.
Vhen pushed beyond itself, it becomes the ground-
work of superstition and fanaticism; it invests
life with an unreal and undefined boundary, which
is so shadowed off into immensity, that its line
of demarcation is lost; the individual passes out
of the domain of reason; he attends to dreams;
he looks after omens; he listens to voices; he re-
ceives impulses and directions which have 110
foundation in reason or
religion; he is subject to

impressions, and interior groundless notices; his
actions become eccentric; he is deceived by hal-
lucinations; he is subject to various illusions;
and he passes into the character of the monomaniac.
This term is employed, not simply to designate a
person who requires seclusion from society, but
rather that much more
frequent form of mental
aberration, in which the patient thinks and acts in
violation of the better judgment of the many wise
and good, ke, of course, thinking himself right, and
all others most erroneous.
Acting as it does most largely upon the hopes
and fears of man, the imagination not only pos-
sesses a
large influence in the developement of
monomania, but it operates considerably upon al-
most every form of bodily disorder. The radiance
of hope, and the night of despondency; the buoy-
ancy of cheerful expectation, and the depression
of gloomy forebodings; the fearfulness of coming
futurity, or the joyful anticipations of to-morrow ;
the dark unseen, if peopled with shadowy forms of
deepest sorrow, or of happiness not to be appre-
ciated; the expectation of improvement, or the
apprehension of increasing malady; the striving
against disease, or
hopelessly yielding to its influ-
ence; all have their origin in this faculty, and
exert an influence for or against life, greater than
can be easily conceived ; and its judicious manage-
ment, or the contrary, will often be the means of
prolonging or
destroying life. Hence the import-
ance of watching over its agency, and especially
of sedulously guarding it from eccentric action.

352 THF: imcivnocn, INFLUENCE
The faculty of tlze will has already engaged our
attention, while describing the essential character
ofprogression which attaches to the human intel-
lect. We shall endeavour to make the present
notice brief, and only supplementary to the former
discussion.
It must ever be remembered that the moral re-
sponsibility of man rests on his own
power to
change his determinations; for unless he possess
this power, he becomes the creature of appetite
and passion-the victim of impulse-the bondslave
of his organisation. It was
necessary that he
should possess a
faculty of this nature, since it is
evident that if he were the mere animal, with all
the powers of mischief conferred by his intellectual
superiority, the greatest disorder must ensue upon
the most intimate framework of society; the gra-
tification of selfish desires would be the dominant
passion; and to this, the good of others, and even
the ultimate good of self, would be recklessly sacri-
ficed; present enjoyment would be the grand
stimulus to action, and every other consideration
would give way before the inlluence of this tyrant
principle.
Seeing, therefore, that the constitution of so-
ciety requires in man a
power to consider, and t0
alter his determinations,and that without it the social
compact must be dissolved, it follows that, accord-
ing to the nature of things, such an
arrangement
would take place; and we are therefore quite pre-
pared for the fact, that the moral Governor would
endue his creature, man, with some
faculty to

will exi.sts,' but that it exerts so feeble an influence
over the conduct. And this is indeed inexplicable,
except bysupposing some such fact as that which
has been revealed to us, viz; that some' prevailing
cause has operated upon the. will, so that it no
longer chooses' the good, and refuses the evil ; but
that its bias is towards a
preference of the latter,
and a
neglect' of the former. .» _
This is still further shown, .by considering the
power of the will. Now it will be found that the
will, which results from the exercise of reason and
judgment, is aery feeble, and liable to be blown
aside by every gale of ,
passion; .and that it only
becomes strong and energetic by being associated
with the latter. Hence it follows, that if the voice
of reason be weak and that of passion strong; and
that while the' exercise ofthe former is favourable
to the good order of society, the influence of the
latter is decidedly opposed to it,-the tendency of
human conduct will be unfavourable to the growth
of social virtue, and social happiness, which are
coincident with the extension of moral worth. In
whatever way this may be explained, nothing can
be more true, than, that in the history of man, the
prevalence of evil is undoubted; and that, notwith-
standing many good qualities, the uncontrolled
tyranny of his organic suggestions would be such,
that the world would be converted into one scene
of unmitigated crime, and of unalleviated sorrow.
It is allowed, that the inferior animals possess

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
and exercise the power of choice and volition ; they
will decide between two plans of action which may
come before them, and will select the one which
is most congenial to their existing inclination. But
there is this difference between the volzlion of
brutes, and the will of man-that the former affects
only the exterior of things, and is determined by
impressions made upon the organ of sense; while
the latter inquires first into the hidden nature of
the objects presented to its choice -looks beyond the
surface-seeks after associations, connexions, and
every kind of information, which will determine
the nature of conduct, and so assist the judgment:
the one is impulsive ; the other is rqlective volition;
the one is animal suggestion, the other is spiritual
gcrvernment.
This being the case, it is very desirable to enlist
as
many of the passions as possible, in the cause of
virtue and the support of good, and obedience to
the will of God; because these will give strength
to the will, and the desire to do good implanted by
Him from whom cometh every good and perfect
gift; the inclination to do right should be culti-
vated into passion, and should be so invested with
benevolence to man and love to God, as to communi-
cate the energy arisingfrom the alliance of the will
with passion.
It has been objected, that specific directions from
the will are not sent to particular muscles, through
the medium of the nerves, on account of the in-
tricacies and interlacings of those nerves, and the
consequent jostling and confusion of the messages

thus distributed. We shall not retrace ground
already passed over, by showing how unphilo-
sophical and untrue is this objection; and how
absurd it is to argue against the possibility of the
existence of that which every day demonstrates.
Take for example the most complex operation of
muscle, as of the muscles of the hand in writing;
or of the tongue and lips in speaking. Everybody
must be conscious of directing the will to these
particular muscles, and must know, that a
specific
act of volition is required for the formation of every
letter of every word written or spoken ; and yet the
most rapid writer or
speaker goes on uninter-
ruptedly without the smallest difficulty arising out
of the "
commingling, and confusing the different
lines of communication." It is absurd to talk of
this as untrue, because we cannot understand it.
Is this, then, the only thing which we do not com-
prehend? Is there anything beyond mathematical
truth which we do fully comprehend, and are we
quite sure even on this point? Here, then, is the
simple fact ; so it is; of what avail is reasoning to
prove that it cannot be?
It has sometimes been asked, why there should
be a
greater complexity of arrangement and mi-
nuteness of subdivision of the nervous, than of the
arterial system? Now to asking questions, there
is no legitimate barrier; and we do not intend to
hold ourselves responsible to answer all the ques-
tions which may be asked. But in the present
instance the reason is obvious; the arterial system
has but one function to perform, while the nervous

system has many. It is true, that in passing the
round of the system, the arterial blood assists
greatly in the performance of other functions, as
digestion, nutrition, secretion, calorification, and
even innervation itself, yet the functions of the
nervous
system are still more intricate, diversified,
and complicated.
All this is perfectly consistent with a
presiding
mind-a mind which governs and directs all the
movements of health ; and which is still to he traced
in the morbid manifestations of disordered action.
In some minds, a
difliculty has arisen to conceive
how the spiritual being can be at the helm, and
govern and direct all the mental manifesta-
tions; and yet be apparently present in ~the ex-
tremities of the sensitive system, and in the mi-
nutest details of action and passion at one and the
same time. Yet this is borne out byfacts, although
we
may not be able to comprehend them; the
doctrine of a
general and particular Providence
presents a perfect analogy. The Supreme Being
is at the helm, and directs all things. But He
is equally present, and his Providence is equally
extended to the remotest events, and details of the
lives of his creatures. In the one case, He acts
as the moral Governor of the universe; in the
other, He acts through his commissioned agents-
acting, indeed, under their own will, and apparently
from their own resources, yet fulfilling his designs
in the voluntary employment or
mis-employment
of that will, and of those resources which God has
originally communicated. Thus, the spiritual part

or BODY AND MIND. 357
of man, emanating as it has done from divinity
itself, directs and governs all the mental move-
ments; but in the sentient extremities of the
system it acts through the medium of its commis-
sioned agents; agents, which seem to move in-
dependently, but which really have no
power when
cut off from communication with their original
superior.
Many circumstances contribute to modify these
manifestations of mind, both in their origin and
in the remote distribution of nervous fibre, so that
not only the mental operations, but all the func-
tions of the body, shall receive a distinctive cha-
racter from original pre-disposition, from age, sex,
temperament, education, climate, parental pecu-
liarities handed down to offspring, and ALL the
varied forms of disorder. All these circumstances
tend to modify the manifestations of mind, and the
actions of body, so that every individual becomes
characterized by some striking peculiarity, which,
in fact, constitutes his individuality, and in which
to himself mainly consists his identity.
It is scarcely more than necessary to mention
this law of nature to ensure its belief; yet it is right
to notice one or two obvious facts, which support
the doctrine above advanced. Every unprej udiced
person must have observed the difference of im-
pression made upon different classes of individuals,
as, for instance, upon the children of the poor and
the rich ; the one, without care, robust, and strong;
the other, with the utmost care, feeble and sus-
ceptible of every kind of morbid impression, strongly

contrasting with the power of resisting in a
great
degree external morbid impressions, which is en-
joyed by the former. During illness, too, the one
will be attacked by maladies of a severe character,
rather than by that frailty of function which be-
longs to their superiors; and all these states must
be met and combated by different, and even by
very dissimilar methods of treatment. Unless these
facts were noticed and acted upon, the science of
medicine would become one vast chaos of em-
piricism.
We shall not now
pursue this subject, as we
shall recur to it hereafter under the head of physical
temperament, and its influence upon the manifesta-
tions of mind in a
subsequent page. But we have
noticed above, that many other causes exert a
considerable influence in modyfqing the style of
thought and action, of feeling and expression, in
every individual. Now this is unquestionably
true; but it is not true, that this modyying in-
fluence is sufficient to produce a
change of cha-
racter; or that the moral re-actions of the indi-
vidual are likewise necessitated and independent
of the will.
Now this is just the point in dispute between
the necessitarian and the free-will advocate; be-
tween the fatalist and the visionary who imagines
that he can control nature by the expression of
his will; between the ultra-phrenologist and his
spiritual opponent. Man is or is not, however, a
responsible agent; if he be so, he must have a will,
in order to make choice of good_or evil ; but if his

moral re-actions are necessitated, and not under
the influence of the will, he can no
longer he held
responsible for his conduct, since none can be
called to account for conduct, or
thought, or feel-
ing, which are inevitable, and independent of him-
seltf The essential difference between these two
views is, that the one
originates action and feeling
in the brain; the other, that these (action and
feeling) are determined by mind, but that they
admit of modification in their manifestations, ac»-
cording to the original peculiarity or
present con-
dition of the manifesting organ. If the former of
these propositions be true, all our reasoning falls
to the ground: man is not a
reasoning creature,
and he cannot in justice be held responsible for
thought, and feeling, and action, over which he
has no control. This proposition has been already
shown to be monstrous; and it is so
completely at
variance with the order of nature, that we shall
not again pass over a train of argumentation, which
has been before detailed, or
anticipate that which
may be hereafter adduced, when treating of the
morbid influence of the body upon the mind.
There is, however, one
point which it is necessary
to discuss in this place, viz. the distinction between
will and inclination. The two are very often con-
founded as
synonymous; we are
perpetually told
that parties wish to do a certain thing, but that
they cannot. Were it not for the unfortunate phi-
losophical and moral results, which so
frequently
occur from this want of the energy of perseverance,
it would be too absurd to require serious notice;

a certain result; but the attractions of another line'

it, and there being no firmness of purpose, no will
to oppose to its suggestions, inclination obtains the
mastery; the individual does not will to act right,

he constantly acts in opposition to his judgment.
The frequent result of man's acting against his
better judgment, and of his being driven away in
a direction contrary to his convictions, and to his
best resolutions founded thereon, has become one
grand resting-place for those who deny the _free

But if that aid be vouchsafed, it is so to the will;
not to indolent, languid desires, and empty long-
ings, and unmeaning aspirations, but to the will.
It is this only which is energized to action, and
without it there will be no
principled action at

all. But it may be said, who gives the will? Why;
the faculty of volition is given to man, tobegol
verned by his understanding and his reason, and
Divine aid will be afforded to the employment of
that faculty; but this employment must originate
with man, and he may, if he choose, neglect the
suggestion; therefore he is a
free agent; therefore
he is bound to watch over and escape from the in-
fluence of prejudice and passion, which would dis-
tort his views, becloud his vision, and benumb his
voluntary power: therefore, he is bound to govern
and direct, and deny himself, either for his own
good or the good of others. Indeed self denial,
the first principle of benevolence, can
only be found
in a
_flee agent; and without freedom of volition,
the whole nature of man is subverted, his moral
character is destroyed, his accountability for his
actions is submerged in the deep and unfathom-
able waters of Lethe; the employment of his
mental powers can be no
longer enforced ; and the
right use of his reason can be found nowhere,
except in the disputations of the schools.
This position is, however, denied; and, strange
to say, by two kinds of disputants, who, with very
different views and intentions, assert the same
thing; and though antipodes to each other in all
other respects, show at least in this respect a
very
close approximation, viz. the ultra-spiritualist who
affirms that man has no will of his own, no
power
to choose good and to refuse evil, no ability to
select that which is most becoming his station
here; and the modern infidel, who refers all these

things to tl1e organisation, and asserts, that man
is such as his organisation makes him; that he
has no power to change his nature, and that he
is not to be blamed for the indulgence of propen-
sities to which his physical system has rendered
him obnoxious.
Both these casuists destroy, though in a different
way, the accountability of the individual; the
former in the more lamentable way, because moral
obligation is lessened under the specious pretext
of exalting the honour of the supreme moral
Governor. But we
appeal to the fact, that the
Almighty has given to man the faculty of the will,
and if he is not to exert it, it has been given him
in vain, which is directly at variance with the
perfect character of the Giver. And we might
also appeal to the consequences, and to the ex-
perience, that persons in general, holding such
views, are less circumspect, less discreet and
valuable members of society, than those who con-
sider themselves morally responsible for their
actions. And still farther, we
might add, that it
is thoroughly inconsistent with the character of a
righteous Governor, to reward or to punish indi-
viduals for acts over which they have had no
possible control.
The iniidel philosopher who arrives at the same
sceptical conclusion, argues that man's passions
(for it is these which generally lead him into error)
result from his organisation; and that thus, con-
trol in the well-organized animal, is to be found
in their gratification, and in their natural balance;

this balance being proportioned to the necessities of
the moment; so that no other control is to be
placed on the wildness of ungoverned passion,
than some other organic excitement; both being
governed by the necessities of the moment, that
necessity being of course the inclination of the in-
dividual, since "
as each temperament has its pre-
dominant passions, most men are born victims
to some
_feelings to which they are
compelled to obey."
Now if this were true; if men of a certain tem-
perament are compelled to obey certain feelings
attached to their predominant temperament; if
they are the victims of their organisation, there
would be an entire end of making man accountable
for actions which he has no
power to repress; and
the social com pact is dissipated, because that com-
pact necessarily implies a surrender of certain
selfish wishes and inclinations to the good of the
general community; a
subjugation of selfishness
to benevolence; a
subjection of passion to prin-
ciple. This is the keystone of the social arch;
upon this it is founded; undermine this, and it
crumbles into disrupted atoms. What then is
principle? It is the developement of the moral
sense, applied to all the emergencies of life; de-
rived, in natural religion, from a sense of what is
right, and just, and fit, and upright; and in re-
vealed religion, from the obligations of the moral
law; in either case, being suflicient to conduct
the individual in the paths of rectitude; and being
dependent upon the exercise of the will, to call up
those principles to control natural passions and

364 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
desires; and to preserve man from constantly
falling into those obliquities of conduct to which
he has become peculiarly liable, from the dcbasing
moral change which has passed upon him, and
which has rendered him, in the words of his sacred
history,
"
prone to evil, and that continually."
It has been alleged, that repentance for past
transgressions, is only that the state of the in-
dividual is changed with respect to his domi-
nant passion. Now this is true to a certain extent;
but then the change is brought about by moral
motive, and not by physical causes.
Repentance
has been already shown to be very different from
remorse; it is to be also distinguished from that
transient regret with which it has been confounded,
and which involves no real sorrow for the past-
no real desire of amendment for the future. The
materialist wishes to call this state repentance;
because regret is t/aus produced by the gratification
of passion, which takes away from the immediate
desire for its further gratification, through the
satiety it produces, and the organic rest which it
requires; but it is a transient impression, and is
gone as soon as that organic rest has recruited
organic expenditure; and then at once is revived
the desire for the gratification of' passion without
any controlling agency.
Not so, repentance! Here, there is not the di-
minished appetite-and, indeed, the gradually
induced loathing of satiety, and of exhausted
power for the continuance of gratifying impulse;
but a real and effective moral change ; a conviction

It would be mere
quibbling, to say, that this
was
only a

state was obedience to constitutional' conditions,
the' present one of repentance. was
owing to the

would be, that thesespring from repentance.; fbut
even if it were _not so, it is clear that they are
arising from moral, not physical associations, and
therefore are not to be accounted for by the fore-
going hypothesis; an
hypothesis whose primary
object is to tear away moral and spiritual obliga-
tion from their influence upon the conduct of man.

startling proposition, that the brain is totally useless
in all that regards mind ; or ," that the mental phe-
nomena are
governed bythe laws oforganised action."
Now it must be manifest, upon a very little con-
sideration, that this conclusion thus magisterially
drawn, is to the last degree unphilosophical; for
in the first place, it supposes that we are
thoroughly-
acquainted with the nature of mind, which we are
not; and in the next place it supposes, that we are
also thoroughly informed of its relation to matter-
of which, again, we are
really in a
great degree
ignorant. Again, it supposes that mind is subject
to matter-that it is governed by the laws of or-
ganised action; a conclusion which we take leave
to deny; and to assert, -on the contrary, that so
far as
regards mind, the brain is the appointed
organ for ,its manifestation-to receive and to
obey its directions; that it is, in fact, the servant
of mind-a property superior to, and not dependent
upon, organisation, but directing that organised
action according to its will.
It is equally unphilosophical to assert, that the
brain must be useless as relates to mind, unless it
be in fact mind itself; because it assumes the point
in dispute, and asserts that mental phenomena are
governed by organised action; whereas it is asserted
by the opponent, that so far from this being the
case, the organic changes are under the direction of
mental influence.
Again, to assert that the brain must be "
totally
useless as regards mind, unless it be mind itself,"
is to assert that the organ and the function are the

same
thing; and that there can
only be one cause
operating upon that function; as if it were to be
asserted, that the stomach was of no use as
regards
digestion, unless that-function can be performed
without nervous influence, upon which, though
unseen, it is wholly dependent; or, as if it were
asserted, that the stomach was of no use as relates
to the process of nutrition, unless it completed the
formation of the chyle; or to the function of san-
guification unless it added the last perfecting action
to the formation of the blood, viz. the red particles ;
all of which are absurd conclusions,-yet not more
so, than that which asserts, that the brain can do
nothing, or that it cannot perfbrm one alleged func-
tion, unless it can
perform another.
All these difficulties are smoothed away by the
acknowledgment of the simple fact, that the brain
is not mind itsef but inferior and subjected to it;
that it is the exponent of mind ; that it is appointed
to receive its notices, and issue its commands;
while, on the contrary, the mind directs the move-
ments of the brain, accelerates or retards its actions,
presides over its physical functions, and regulates
its actions in conformity with moral and spiritual
principles.
This opinion has been endeavoured to be sup-
ported by the argument, that attention is not a
mental faculty, but a peculiar condition of the
cerebral organ, induced by the strength of impres-
sion made upon it. It might here be fairly asked,
what is a
faculty, but a
peculiar condition of the
organ, which enables it to carry on

next, every variety of

pression, and always tossed away from its present
object by any new
impulse, by any fresh organic
suggestion. Neither, if the hypothesis were true,
could the attention be varied at pleasure from one
object to another, at the bidding of the will, and in
obedience to mental behests; it could be governed
only by the laws of organised action ; .whereas it is
manifest, that however much it is uuhappily dis-
turbed by any disorder in the organisation, yet in
its state of organic lwalthfulness, it is a cheerful
and faithful servant of mind.
Precisely the same
reasoning is applicable to
anotherfaculty, the existence of which as a
faculty
has been denied; and this denial has been sup-
ported by a beautiful theory of organic movements,
in order to account for spontaneous recollection.
Thus it has been said,
"
In efforts at recollection
the ideas sometimes proceed in a
logical and syllo-
gistic series, so that the steps of the process may be
retraced ; more frequently, the organic movements
are performed too rapidly for consciousness, and
the idea flashes at once on the mind, as if without
connexion. It often happens also, that after a
protracted but ineffectual effort, the idea arises
spontaneously, and interferes with the new trains
upon which the mind is then occupied. It should
seem that, in this instance, the cerebral tissue has
been thrown into a state of orgasm by the previous
effort, and repeats at intervals the movements upon
which it has been exercised, independently of the
will, and thus accidentally introduces the required
idea."

370 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
It is readily allowed, that there is something very
diflicult of explanation in that form of spontaneous
recollection, in which, after frequent and fruitless
efforts to remember, the idea at last flashes across
tle perception, without any apparent cohesion with
any preceding train ; but to endeavour to account
for memory upon a series of organic movements, is
unphilosophical and contrary to fact. It.is unphi-
losophical, inasmuch as it supposes the existence of
a cause, which is unnecessary; since if memory be
a mental process, conducted under the agency of
the mental organ, with submission to the mental
guidance, it is unnecessary to suppose a series of
organic movements in order to its production. Ve
know but little of mental operation, but that little
is opposed to the idea of materiality. And it is
contrary to fact; for if there were
organic move-
ments, those movements would` be perceived,
when the attention was awakened to the pro-
cess. But they are not; in the highest efforts
of memory, there are no perceptible organic
movements; the brain may be aroused; it may
be an active and faithful, it may be a treacher-
ous and contumacious servant, but organic move-
ments are not diszoverable; all that is felt, is
distress of mind, because the effort of recollection
is unavailing.
But the process is evidently a mental process,
and not one of organic movement. It often hap-
pens, that, in recollection, the ideas are traced back
in regular cohesive association to the point which is
the one sought for ; and this is taken step by step

as a
regular consequence of voluntary attention;
and the action of the brain is perceived only as
subsidiary. But, sometimes, the effort to trace
back the present, to other by-gone trains of ideas,
is fruitless: the thing is not perceived; but the
right chord has been touched, unconsciously, or
half-consciously, while apparently busied about other
things; the mind has hunted about for the lost
idea, and has picked up the clue, which has con-
ducted, without effort or manifest design, to the
thing sought for. But perhaps the pursuit has
been abandoned as fruitless, and after all the idea
arises spontaneously. Now, this may not admit of
easy explanation ; but it is just as much explained
by saying that it arises from a series of mental, as
from a series of organic movements, each being
equally unperceived, and for the latter of which
thereis no foundation in reason or
analogy. In all
probability, in the search after the forgotten idea,
some train has been awakened, which, unperceived,
leads the inquirer to the object of pursuit; the
original impression made upon some
portion of the
subsidiary organ has been reproduced, which the
mind has caught up and applied. And if this be not
wholly satisfactory, at all events, it has more foun-
dation in fact, than the hypothesis of organic move-
ment, aiding organic recollection, and going no
farther than organisation. We do not judge it
necessary to notice the orgasm of the cerebral
tissue, and the repetition of the movements of that
tissue, independently of the will, which repetition
of movement accidentally introduces the required

idea ; a
farrago of nonsense, which one would think
must be the product of cerebral tissue, unguided by
the judgment, and of cerebral action, when disso-
ciated from its governing and directing prin-
ciple. Grievous, indeed, is it to observe the
follies into which wise men fall, when they wish
to substitute preconceived notions for truth; and
to
support a favourite hypothesis, rather than yield
the mind to any direction higher than mere
orga-
nisation.
There is an
important offset from this hypothesis
of organic movement, which has so considerable a
bearing on the moral character, that it requires to
be noticed in this place. It has been said, that
the ideas which How from impressions commencing
in the viscera, are
wholly organic, and exemptedfrom
moral consequence ; or, in other words, that man
is irresponsible for all actions, the germ of which
is to be found in his organisation; so that for all
his animal propensities, for all the lower feelings
and passions, and all the consequences to which
they lead, he is not rewonsible; their origin is
"
wholly organic," and therefore they are
"
ex-
empted from moral consequence ;" so that the
framework of society may be destroyed by the
influence of human passion, and yet the destroying
individuals are to be held innocent, provided that
these actions are stimulated by the tyranny of their
organic suggestions.
It is not often that we find error holding out a
front so
open that it cannot be sophisticated, un-
disguised even by the flimsy veil of pseudo-bene-

volence; and it is a real relief when the features
of error, its general form and pressure, are thus
held up in all their hatefulness. ln writing for
the general public, we are
precluded from taking
as
examples many of the animal passions; we shall
merely mention, in the present instance, revenge,
in consequence of which an individual commits
murder! Now if it shall have happened that the
first germ of this passion originated in his stomach,
because his victim had stolen his dinner when he
was
very hungry, and he had pursued and in-
flicted summary vengeance upon him, the perpe-
tration of murder is to be held harmless, because
the first ideas which led to the crime commenced in
the viscera, were
wholly organic, and exempted from
moral consequences.
And inasmuch as almost all the ideas arise
through the senses, the greater part of man's
feelings and conduct are
dependent upon his or-
ganisation, in addition to which much of his moral
and social character is governed by passions and
sentiments which have their root in the viscera;
all these are exempted from moral consequences,
and therefore man is irresponsible for almost all
that he says and does in life. Now this is a
simple
following out of the principle to its legitimate
sequences; and if such be admitted, of what avail
are the bonds of social order-what the use of moral
sensation-what the value of relative obligation-
what the use of moral principle and action ? Mau
does as he is prompted by passion ; he pleases him-
self, and therefore he is not responsible ! How

frightful the consequences to be derived from such
a
position! Far better to live with the beasts of
the field; they can but obey the dictates of their
organisation; and they would be less formidable,
because they possess not reason to give energy
and power to their resolves.
In good truth, man has a
spiritual principle
givcn him for the purpose of controlling the irre-
gularities which would otherwise ensue from un-
bridled passion. His moral sense governs the
animal, and makes him answerable for all his
conduct; the whole of his organisation is placed
in subjection to this governing, presiding prin-
ciple, and man is morally culpable if he do not
yield obedience to the infiuence of conscience;
still more so if he refuse to submit his will to the
dictates of this conscience, aided as it is by all the
moral truth with which he is surrounded, by all
the highest sanctions which revelation, and the
belief of the existence of an omniscient God, holy
and just, encouraging the good, and punishing the
wicked, is calculated to produce.
We see the anxiety of a certain class of phi-
losophers to lower human nature as much as
pos-
sible, so that the apparent distinction between man
and brutes should be diminished to a difference in
degree, and not in /find ; and that even this differ-
ence should be so shaded off, as almost to blend at
certain points of approximation, and to leave no
distinctive marks between the two. The design
of this reasoning is very evident: if man should
obey his passions, and all other organic sugges-

tions, and be held scatheless for all the conse-
quences, t/zen it is most desirable that he should
have no future account to give of the deeds done
in the bodyl And since not the most sanguine
visionary believes that there are future rewards
and punishments for the brute creation, then it is
most desirable that man should only be a
superior
brute, because if the same in kind, and only
differing in degree, the question of action is only
one of degree; responsibility for such action the
same-future consequences the same-and there-
fore rewards and punishments the same. If, then,
the question of rewards and punishments be only
one of degree,-and there are
obviously none in
the one instance, so neither can there be in the
other; man
gets rid of the notion of accountability,
and all is well, if he do not act so as to arouse the
passions of his fellow-man; and even then he is
not responsible, and there are no moral conse-
quences.
The question, therefore, as to what is the dis-
tinction between the intelligence of man and brutes
is not unimportant. To this may be appended,
though not necessarily, the question of the after
existence of brutes in another state of being. This
latter problem, perhaps, it is impossible to solve
satisfactorily, because of our own
knowledge we can
know nothing of a state of after-existence, and
therefore we can form no reasonable judgment of
the respective fitness of such after-existence; and
it is a
point upon which Revelation is profoundly
silent, and therefore it may be believed to be one

376 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
into which it was not intended we should inquire.
It has been thought that this question had an
important bearing on 1nan's after-existence; but it
has not, because, in the first place, supposing man to
partake of the same nature with brutes, there are
different degrees of intelligence, and an
omnipo-
tent Creator may have imparted to one a
capacity
for after-existence, which may have been withheld
from another less suited to such existence; and,
in the next place, comes the truth, that man
pos-
sesses a
principle superadded to his more perfect
organisation-a principle differing in nature from
brute intelligence-a spiritual principle-discon-
nected with matter, and destined to survive its
ruin, and to flourish in unceasing and immortal
verdure. Now what are the distinctive features
between the mind of man and the intelligence of
brutes? since, as a mere
question of degree, there
are
gradations of intelligence even in cultivated
society, which will account for much diH`erence of
mental manifestation.
It cannot be denied that the inferior animals
possess rational minds; and it has been already
stated that theigreat difference in their apparent
intelligence, and that of man is, that the latter
originates and acquires, while the former possesses
only imparted knowledge, such as it has pleased
the Creator to bestow, and in all respects best
suited for the situation that animal is destined to
fill. It has also been stated that animals do not
anticipate as a
reasoning process, though they in-
stinctively prepare for certain grand events, which

their instinctive knowledge has tanght them to
expect; as, for instance, to seek shelter from a
coming storm, or to prepare a fit residence for
their expected young, or other similar acts, all of
which differ from mental anticipation, as not being
wrought out, but imparted.
It must be allowed that the intelligence of some
animals is great; that it is even greater than that
possessed by many of the higher order of creatures,
man, in some at least of his less gifted specimens.
But it is after all of a different kind ; nothing can
give to man the superiority of sense, the instinctive
sagacity, the inherent knowledge which are
pos-
sessed by brutes; while, on the other hand, nothing
can confer on the inferior animals the kind of
reasoning intelligence possessed by man, and es-
pecially that moral soul, which rende1's him a
religious, a
responsible creature, and the absence
of which leaves the inferior animal irresponsible.
It appears, then, that a man of limited intelligence
possesses knowledge which the most sagacious
animal has not; while even some
stupid animals
excel the finest specimens of the most intellectual
men in the amount of their instinctive knowledge;
in the extent and power of their senses; and in
the quantity of their imparted information.
But if so, if it be true that in some features of
animal intelligence, the most stupid creatures excel
man, in all the pride and vain-glory of his intellec-
tual possessions, and, on the contrary, that the nar-
rowed nnderstanding of uncultivated man
greatly
excels in reasoning power the highest reach of the

imparted knowledge of the lower animals, it fol-
lows necessarily that the difference between the
two is a distinction of nature, and not only a dif-
ference in degree.
Wherein, then, consists this difference ? In both
cases the brain is the organ of mind; in both
cases
impressions are received from the exterior;
and the mental manifestations are
conveyed from
within outvard, through the medium of a similar
organ; in both cases the brain performs the same
function. It is not here a
question whether the
brain is more or less perfect, because, first, that
is admitted on all hands; and because, secondly,
as the difference to be explained is not one of
degree, but of kind, we shall not have arrived one
step nearer a solution of the problem by showing
that in one case the organ is more
perfect in its
capacity ; since, in truth, while one brain is more
perfect in acquired, the other is far more
perfect in
instinctive, or
imparted knowledge.
Here, it may be said by some
persons, that we
are reduced to the alternative of allowing the
proximate cause of thought to rest in the brain of
the inferior animal, or to admit that he has an im-
mortal mind. Now it is fully allowed that this
question is beset with difficulties, and that it
appears to be one of those in which we
everywhere
find that Nature has placed a barrier to our inves-
tigations; a barrier not to be overleaped, and
through which, therefore, it is the part of wisdom
not to pry, since the seal of omnipotent secrecy has
been placed upon it. Yet if we do not too curi-

ously seek after that into which it is forbidden for
us to inquire, and if we do not impiously attempt
to supersede the creative wisdom of Omniscience,
by doubting His knowledge or His power, or
setting limits to His goodness, there is no reason
why we
may not. humbly seek to trace His agency
in all His works.
Now with regard to these supposed alternatives,
first, that we must admit the proximate cause of
thought to exist in the brain; we
reply that this
is unnecessary, because the Almighty may have
given to the inferior animals a certain something
which we call mind, of the possession of which
man is conscious, and refers in matters of opinion
or action to his understanding, his judgment, his
conscience, clearly distinguishing these powers of
thought from the organ which carries them on;
and this something called mind, is suited to the
condition in life, the wants, the habits, the well-
being, the destiny of the respective animals. To
this mind the impressions from without may be
communicated, and the notices from within may
be conveyed ; and in the absence of moral motive
the functions of life will be performed through the
several impulses of passion and appetite, and other
organic suggestions.
But the too curious inquirer will wish to know
what is the nature of this mind, and what its 'final
destiny? Is it, or is it not immortal? Is it lost
with the life of the animal, or is it destined to live
again, in the same, or in some new form? Ve
cannot tell; it is a
point beyond the reach of

380 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
human intellect. But this is not a matter of such
grave importance as has been represented by
sceptical philosophers, since no
important doctrine
rests upon it. It is absurd, and very unphiloso-
phical for man to dogmatise upon a
subject of
which he is so
profoundly ignorant, as not even to
know the meaning of the terms he employs in order
to explain that which is inexplicable. Now, till
we know what are the ultimate properties of
mat.ter; what is the nature of the ultimate nervous
fibre; how impressions are made
conveyed by it; wherein consists
ence; and what are the disorders
liable, it is quite useless to attempt
of the functions of the brain. So
upon it; how
nervous influ-
to which it is
an
explanation
that as
philoso-
phers, we
ought quietly to study the manifestations
ot' mind, without making intimate researches into
the nature of thought. Thus, therefore, we see
that the question of animal mind cannot, in philo-
sophical truth, be brought to bear upon the other
question of' the brain being the final cause of
thought. ~
Neither is this more
important, in regard to the
immortality of the spiritual part of man, or his
future prospects, responsibilities, rewards, and
punishments. For, first, the Almighty may have
given to animals a rational mind, suited to their
station in life; and this not being a moral mind,
and its possessor not morally responsible, there
is no
necessity for a future state of rewards and
punishments, to
equalize the inequalities of life;
and therefore animal mind may become extin-

guished, or cease to exist with animal life. Or,
secondly, it may be destined to revive in a new
state of existence,-a state of existence suited to its
powers and capabilities,-but not for the exhibition
of attributes which it never possessed; an animal
but not a
spiritual paradise, which latter is reserved
only for that moral and responsible creature, man,
whose education here is evidently one of probation,
to fit him for future activity, and future enjoyment.
Either alternative is perfectly possible; which
exists, is hidden from us, and it is worse than
useless to inquire : for in no case has the truth any
bearing upon the immortality of the soul of man,
or
upon any other great doctrine of our faith. We
know not the whole; if we did, we should find
order, harmony, wisdom, and beauty: we know
not in what way nature has accomplished the
mysterious union of mind and matter: but if
we did know, we should doubtless be astonished
at the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of
God, displayed in the simplicity of the arrange-
ment.
There is one other faculty of the mind, which
claims our attention for a few moments, because it
has an
important bearing upon the healthy, as well
as
upon the morbid manifestations of the spiritual
principle, viz. the faculty of imitation. If we go
back to early infancy, we notice, that upon this
faculty depends almost all the acquired good or
evil of that early period; from the first dawn of
intelligence, we shall find the prevalence of this
instinctive desire ; there is a natural inclination to

382 THE nscrrnocm. INFLUENCE
resemble those around us; and the manners and
habits of individuals, the speech, the modes of
thought and action, are handed down from one
generation to another.
That this faculty is instinctive, will also be shown
by considering, that there is in the human mind a
secret but imperative impulse to imitate that which
pleases; and that the early traces of this faculty
are to be discovered before the developement of
reason, in a
degree sufficient to form a basis for
rational imitation ; and that with augmenting
mental power, it is to be found standing out as a
master principle in the passion of emulation.
Another proof of its instinctive nature, will be
found in the mode by which we
sympathise in the
joys or sorrows of others : we
joy with those who
rejoice; we
weep with those who weep, and simply
because they do so; for this act of sympathy will
oftentimes precede reflection, as to the cause which
has produced those manifestations which we uncon-
sciously imitate.
We see the influence of this principle, in what
may be termed the fashion of the day, that fashion,
often giving currency to things absurd, and much
more frequently to things of little value, so as to
give them an undue preponderance for a time;
and then, by a similar re-action, sending them back
again, into a state of unmerited obloquy and insig-
nificance. This fashion is frequently changing;
but while it continues, it exercises a
very powerful
influence upon conduct ; and thus it is that we find,
not only reigning fashion in dress, but we observe

certain pursuits become fashionable. The study
of some languages, or of some branch of science
hitherto neglected, is now
brought out into active
notice. The advantage of this influence is mani-
fest; because each one seeks to obtain all the in-
formation of his neighbour, and by a more accurate
investigation, to carry on that knowledge one
step
further, which again excites and keeps up the zeal
and activity of the faculty.
This faculty of imitation is greatest in the
young, and perhaps becomes less in proportion to
the developement of the judgment, and to the in-
crease of experience, leading to greater caution
and discrimination. As age advances, the tendency
to imitation certainly diminishes to such an extent,
that after a certain number of years, we shall find the
disposition to receive anything new, to step out of
the beaten track, or to take new impressions or new
views, become so feeble, as to form a
positive ob-
stacle to improvement, and to the enlargement of
the dominion of mind. By degrees it forms a sufli-
cient ground of objection, to any new
thing,
that our ancestors did not think, or do so; age is
remarkable for its pertinacity to old opinions,
and for its indisposition to believe that which is
modern.
That such a
faculty should possess some counter-
feits, should give rise to some errors, and should
possess some morbid states, is not surprising; and,
further, that these states should have a considerable
influence on the physical and moral health of large

masses, is only what should be expected. Ve
perceive this on a
great variety of occasions ; one of
the simplest is perhaps that of yawning, and there
are few who have not experienced the irresistible
impulse to this unfortunate state, merely from
seeing others yawn. It is a well-known fact to
medical men, that such is this propensity in many
states of the nervous
temperament, particularly in
females, that the same form of hysterical rnalady will
become prevalent in a
community, where no such
tendency previously existed ; and that from the
occurrence of a
single case. Thus there are imita-
tive diseases: the attacks of hysteria and epilepsy
may often be imitated, and that too successfully, so
that the deception answers. This exists when there
is a sinister object to accomplish, and 'therefore a
desire to cultivate the invasion" of such malady. Here
the will and the mind are concerned : but the same
propensity to imitation, will be found sometimes
independently of the will, and occasionally despite
its utmost efforts. In these cases, the impression
seems to have been made upon the nervous fibre;
and, as we have said, the faculty of imitation pre-
cedes reason and reflection, the mobility is commu-
nicated directly to the muscular nerves, before the
mind has had time to call its intellectual resources
into active operation. In these cases we should
pity, not blame.
The moral influence of this faculty is also largely
operative ; there is an instinctive inclination to imi
tate those with whom we are associated; and it is

only by calling into active operation the strength
of good principle, that we can
escape from the con-
tagious influence of those around us. It is easy to
swim with the stream, but it requires a
high degree
of moral courage to attempt to stem the torrent;
to dare to be singular; to be firm and unbending in
the midst of parties which court our favour by their
attractions. It is very important to know when to
arrest this propensity to imitation, and how far to
yield our assent to the common modes of thought
and action current among men. Such is the power
of the instinctive principle, that it was
clearly
the design of the Omnipotent Creator, that man
.should imitate his fellow-man; and, therefore,
the faculty should only be repressed when its
exercise interferes with some
principle of action,
some boundary of right or
wrong; it should be
a rare occurrence, when man finds it necessary
to separate himself in conduct from his fellows;
but when the occasion does present itself, he
should do so
unsparingly, unshrinkingly, uncom-
promisingly.
In these days, perhaps, it is scarcely possible to
pass over the influence of this faculty, in bringing
about many of the great revolutions of the world:
it is this which has made armies invincible, and
given a
panic to others; which has made them flee,
when none
pursued: it is this which has given
currency to opinions of misrule and lawlessness,
and a
contampt of authority, which threatens to
overturn our most cherished institutions: it is this

CHAPTER VIII.
ON THE MORBID MANIFESTATIONS OF MIND, DE°
PENDENT UPON CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE
BRAIN 2-MENTAL DISEASE.
W'E have already mentioned the "
tyranny of
organic suggestions ;" we have combated the
opinion, that man was not responsible for thoughts
originating in some
part of his organisation; we
have shown that he is minutely answerable for
every atom of his conduct, because he is placed in
a situation to be superior to his physical system,
and to restrain or
repress its propensities. We
again recur to this subject; first, for the purpose of
marking it as the simplest form of disturbed mental
manifestation, depending on
impressions made
upon the body; secondly, for the purpose of incul-
cating the necessity for watching against these sug-
gestions; and, thirdly, that we may encourage
those who suffer much from their recurrence, and
whose feeble will renders them an
easy prey to the
impulse of passion.
First, were man to follow the suggestions of his

388 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
appetites, uncontrolled by reason, unawed by con-
sequences, ignorant of responsibility, careless of
character, and uninfluenced by religious motive
and sanction, he would degenerate to the lowest
animal, and he would be worse than the beast, in
proportion to his power to injure, by calling into
action all the extent of his resources, his knowledge,
his skill, his prudence, his foresight, and all the
formidable array of mental power which he pos-
sesses: and then this beautiful world would be-
come the prey to remorseless impiety. It is easy
for the reader to conceive the infinite evils which
would arise from such a state of things; but the
details would be scarcely fitted for the public eye;
we shall therefore exemplify our
position only by
the simple appetite of hunger.
The desire for food is imperative; and where
man has it within his reach, it is easily and pro-
perly gratified. But suppose he has no food with
which to satisfy its cravings: his neighbour has an
abundance of food: nature created food for man;
it never intended that the goods of fortune should
be unequally divided; therefore the hungry man
has a
right to the szqnerabundant food possessed by
his neighbour: and even if that neighbour have
not a
superabundance, but only a bare sufficiency,
still the hungry man has a
right to it, if he can
obtain it, because it is one of nuture's universal
laws, that the stronger should feed upon the weaker.
If then food can be obtained upon easy terms,
well! if not, it must be obtained by violence. lf
it can be stolen from its possessor, this would be

easier, and therefore better; but if not, the arm of'
might must be employed to overcome the power of
right, the violence must be proportioned to the re-
sistance; and if that resistance be great, it must
be overcome
by still greater exertion, to be limited
only by that which is necessary for acquisition;
and this, even though at the expense of the life of
the possessor; for after all,
"
what is life?" It is
only a state which may be enjoyed by one, or
by
another ; but to which no one has a
greater right
than another, and to which he has the greatest right,
who can best protect it ; so that if Iam to starve, or
my neighbour be killed in the effort to save
myself
from hunger, his life rather than 'mine must be the
sacrifice. Thus the apparently simple want of
hunger, leads, if uncontrolled, to the overturning
all the important barriers of society, and legislation,
and morals; and the greatest crimes are committed,
if they stand in the way of the gratification of
selfish desire. And if this be the case under cir-
cumstances in which passion is not involved, how
much more where every barrier is swept away at
once
by its resistless torrent !
How great then is the necessity for watching over
the influence of these suggestions, of subduing the
principle of selfishness, of calling into action its
antagonist principle of benevolence, and the influ-
ence of all the laws of God and man, in order that
all the functions of the body may be subjected to the
Superior influence of mind; and that man
may live
in the constant and habitual practice of that self-
denial which will alone enable him to escape from

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
this tyranny. But this is religion! and it is even
so : the animal will claim the supremacy, unless the
spiritual nature shall have been disciplined; and
by God's grace shall have been placed under the
dominion of virtuous suggestion. But this involves
a series of acts of self-denial; a constant struggling
with all the lower feelings and propensities, and a
uniform cultivation of that love to one's neighbour,
which is the second great commandment. In
attempting this, the power of the will must be cul-
tivated, and brought into constant exercise, or it
will soon become feeble and vacillating; it will
parley-and it is already undone so far as
regards
firmness of purpose.
Thirdly, this subject affords encouragement for
those who suffer most from the tyranny of the body.
We are
treading on tender ground; and we are
particularly desirous to comfort the feeble-minded,
but not to give countenance to the indolent; it is to
those who sugfer from the tyranny of the body to
whom we offer encouragement, not to those who care-
lessly avail themselves of this tyranny, as a
ground
of excuse for theirlindolence and delinquencies;
or to those who willingly, cheerfully, andiknow-
ingly indulge all the suggestions of body, and ab-
solutely luxuriate in their own weakness. To these,
the condemnation of neglected talent, perverted
power, abused mercy, and wilful contumacy will
attach. It is always to be remembered, that the
body is subservient to the mind; and that this sub-
jection, though not perfect, is to be constantly en-
larged and extended. It is also to be remembered,

that in our
present perverted state of being, there is
a
principle of evil, constantly and rebelliously at
work against this subjection. So long, therefore, as
man is an
imperfect creature, so long will the
government of the body, by the mind, be imperfect ;
and so
long will the suggestions of the body inter-
fere with the finest properties of the christian
character, check the growth of christian principle,
repress the developement of christian virtue, and
shrivel the expansion of christian feeling. At
every period of the day, and under all circum-
stances, particularly those where it is desirable to
get rid of body and its connexions; upon every
such occasion, will its suggestions become promi-
nent, will becloud the intellect, pervert the judg-
ment, and render cold the heart. Still the spiritual
principle is constantly opposed to these suggestions;
they are never tolerated-much less indulged ; they
are
fought against with all the weapons of this holy
warfare-they are watched over and opposed : and
while this is the case; while the Christian is con-
scious that he is doing his utmost to bring the body
into subjection, though he may lament his deficien-
cies, and his want of success, yet if his opposition has
been sincere, he will escape from the burden of
self-reproach. But if his conscience tell him, that
he has supinely allowed himself to be enslaved by
his animal desires, there is no rest for him at all.
His security and happiness consist in opposition;
his certainty of being overcome-his helplessness,
his miserable remorse, are the sure result of supine-
ness and inaction; of listening to the voice of

392 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
passion, of being found sleeping at his post, and of
being surprised into obedience to the tyranny of his
organic suggestions.
Sleep, though it must not be called a morbid
condition of the brain, is one of those states which
thoroughly suspends the manifestations of mind,
and therefore itsef and its morbid conditions,
become objects of inquiry. The phenomena of
sleep are in themselves very curious; and the
analogous sleep of plants leads us to see that it is
a universal law of nature, not applicable to animals
only, but extending throughout the domain of
active as well as of locomotive life. It is diflicult
to define what sleep is; and these singular analo-
gies of plants increase the difficulty, as it is by no
means
proved that plants possess a nervous
system.
Neither is it the stimulus of light which produces
this effect, since some
plants sleep by day, others
at night, and others at different hours of the same
day. There is, however, this kind of analogy, that
in each case there is a
suspension of active life;
only such an amount of action as is necessary to
sustain lyk is continued, but not enough to exhibit
its active manifestations.
With regard to man, his sleep seems to depend
upon a
peculiar condition of the nervous system;
there is invariable disposition to sleep when that
system is oppressed; and if the oppression be con-
siderable, the sleep is unconquerable, and not to be
superseded; while in the opposite state of irrita-
bility it is almost impossible to woo
sleep, so
completely gone does it seem to the unfortunate

patient. This condition is not always a morbid
state, but is accompanied by a
degree of excite-
ment of the brain, of an
agreeable character, and
the patient will pass weeks of almost entire wake-
fulness, and yet not be the worse for it. During
this time, intellectual activity is augmented, but
not so the power for long-sustained movement;
and unless great care be taken, the functions of
organic life generally suffer for this undue expen-
diture of intellectual energy.
lt seems that a certain amount of sleep is gene-
rally desirable, but that this differs much in differ-
ent individuals. It is one of nature's universal
laws, that every organ must have its period of
rest, and sleep is the rest of the brain, during
which it accumulates nervous
energy, and becomes
again fitted for active employment. It is astonish-
ing how little sleep will produce this effect of rest;
but the refreshment produced by transient sleep
will not last long; it will soon become exhausted,
and will require renewal. After sleep, the brain
should be active and energetic, and a
feeling of
comfort should pervade the system.
There is a state of wretched drowsiness, which is
not sleep, but which is almost equally fatal to
intellectual usefulness and enjoyment; and the
literary man is happy indeed if he has not formed
a
large acquaintance with this tormenting foe to
improvement; he may continue his labour, but it is
wit/:out efect ; he may read or write, but there is no
soul infused into either pursuit: there is a dulness of
impression and apprehension which pervades the

nervous
system. Employment is a burden, and
whatever is done, is done languidly and as a task.
In this state, there can be no fine conceptions, no
enlarged views, no delicate tact and perception of
relative association; and the best, though by no
means a certain remedy, is to throw aside the
books and papers, and indulge SLEEP.
To this necessity of our nature, intellect re-
luctant.ly yields obedience; the hour of retiring is
scarcely hailed as a boon ; and there is a
prevail-
ing regret that mind is so allied with matter that
its energetic manifestations cannot be continued
without an interval of repose. In perfectly natural
sleep, the brain enjoys a
period of entire quietude.
What is the condition of the spiritual principle
during this period of torpor of its organ we know
not, and it is useless to inquire ; but it is probable
that in this stage of our existence the mind is also
quiescent during the time of healthy and perfect
sleep. But it may not be so ; the functions of organic
life are continued, though unconsciously--respira-
tion proceeds--the chest is alternately heaved and
compressed--the heart carries on its wonted beat
--digestion, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, all
these functions are
respectively carried on un-
known, unnoticed, and there can be no reason
why the spirit may not also be occupied without
the cognisance of its organ. This beautiful pro-
vision of nature, for the repair of exhausted ner-
vous
energy, without which no one of the bodily
functions could be long continued, and more
espe-
cially for the refreshment of intellect, is one in

which intelligence seems laid aside; the subject
appears as if dead, and to all intents and purposes
is temporarily dead, though preparing for an in-
vigorated resuscitation.
There are various morbid conditions of sleep,
which it is necessary to notice, because they are
connected with perverted manifestations of mind.
One of the most important of these is dreaming.
Various hypotheses have at different times obtained
currency with regard to dreaming, and many of
these are more or less dependent upon the assump-
tion that it is a mental process; nay, more, it has
been quoted as a
proof of the immortality of the
soul : these opinions are much to be regretted, as
they afford to the materialist and the atheist
strongholds which they would not otherwise pos-
sess.
Now dreaming is not a
phenomenon of mind;
if it were so, it would partake the qualities of
mind. Yet nothing can be more true, than that
in dreaming there is no
just perception-no real
knowledge-no accurate memory-no consequen-
tial association-no consecutive reasoning-no
well-weighed judgment; but that, on the contrary,
the perception of impressions is always perverted;
the knowledge of things is anything but the truth;
the memory of by-gone circumstances is jumbled
in inextricable confusion; the associations are of
the most absurd, and fantastic, and impossible
description; the reasoning, any, is dependent
upon these associations, and the conclusions are
unspeakably absurd, while the judgment is as

possible to
any such mental state. It is
then worse than inconsequential to speak of dream-
ing as a state or condition of the mind; it is
entirely resulting from a
peculiar condition of the
brain, and this condition depends upon the irrita-
tion of some of its fibres.
This irritation may arise primarily in itself, or
secondarily, from the sympathetic irritation of
some distant organ ; and in accordance with their
origin, dreams will assume the shape of "
Past
feelings renovated ;" of recollected impressions ; of
the fantastic grouping of thoughts or anxieties
which have occupied the attention previously; of
the morbid irritation of some
portion of the brain,
giving origin to visions of an untraceable cha-
racter; or of impressions made upon the brain,
through one of the organs of sense; or
through the
unwonted or disordered action of some other organ,
not immediately an
organ cy" sense.
It would not be diflicnlt to obtain something
like a classification of dreams under this kind of
arrangement, having for their primal root irrita-
tion ofthe brain ; thus-
a. Dreams arising from the renovation of past
feelings. At some anterior date, powerful impres-
sions have been made upon the affective feelings,
and in a state of imperfect sleep these are called
up, from the irritation of those cerebral fibres
upon which that impression was
originally made,
not always in a
simple uncompounded form, but
with a character more or less varied, yet always
exhibiting the original root. Thus the author,

when a
boy, was
subjected to a
very thoughtless
but fearful accident, through the mischievous in-
tention of his brother, and this impression, during
sleep, has been called up many, many times since,
even to the present day.
b. Dreams arising from the recollection of past
impressions. This is a
frequent source of dream-
ing; and these impressions may have been very
varied in their character, very distant in time and
place, and very different in their nature and object;
in fact, they may have been anything in the wide
range of personal history ; nay, it must have hap-
pened to everybody, to observe that the recollection
of dreams will serve as the basis of future dreams;
so that the individual so
dreaming shall be per-
fectly conscious of finding himself in a situation
and under circumstances which have previously
occurred to him in sleep, but of which he has no
wa/:ing recollection, and with which he has no
kind of association, clearly tracing back the origin
of this form of dreaming to irritation of the cerebral
fibre.
c. Another fruitful source of dreaming is to be
found in the thoughts and anxieties of the preced-
ing day, or of some antecedent period, which are
revived during the night, but which, in consequence
of the brain having lost the harmonising influence
of the reason
andjudgment, are thrown together in
a maze of inextricable confusion, and yet possessing
sufficient cohesion to show that the original germ
may be traced back to preceding cerebral occupa-
(ion.

398 'run RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
d. The brain itself may have become the seat
of irritation, either generally over its surface, or
throughout its substance, or
only partially through
a
few, or
through many of its fibres: and this
irritation may be very varied in its character; it
may arise from simple worry, from a series of those
contre-temps which often happen to annoy, and
which are
frequently in themselves of a
very slight
aspect; or it may arise from exhaustion-from the
brain's action having been too great or too long
continued; or it may be the product of fever, or
of any similar disturbing cause which acts upon
the brain primarily; or that organ may itself be
subjected to incipient, but deep-seated, and, if un-
controlled, disorganising mischief; all of which
causes will be fruitful sources of dreaming, and of
dreams infinitely varied in character and intensity,
from the trifling instance of some mere
perplexity,
to the highest complication of unheard-of horrors.
e.
Lastly, dreams may arise from impressions
made upon an
organ of sense; or
through the un-
wanted or disordered action of some other organ,
not immediately an
organ of sense.
Thus a
change of temperature during the night,
or that kind of restlessness which has led to throw-
ing off the bedclothes ; or an
uneasy position from
whatever cause, or a sound communicated to the
ear; or a sudden light being thrown in; or the
olfactory or
gustatory nerves
becoming impressed
from an exterior or interior cause, will occasion
dreaming; as also will hunger, or thirst, or indi-
gestion, or disordered respiration, or bile, producing

or BODY AND MIND. 399
irritation of the liver; or
any other uneasiness,
excess, or defect, or even unwonted action (though
natural in its proper time and place) of any organ
or
function of the body; these all will occasion
dreams, and dreams of a
peculiar character, though
our
knowledge is not yet sufficiently advanced to
assign that peculiarity of character to the specific
organ or
function disordered ; nor to the particular
character of such organic or functional disturbance,
varied as that must be in its origin, and circum-
stances, and degree, and intensity.
Yet all these originations of dreaming agree in
the one
simple point towards which they all con-
verge, viz. in producing irritation of the brain, as
varied, indeed, as the cause to which they owe their
origin, yet being in every instance irritation.
There is here, too, ample and satisfactory ground
for explaining every dream. There is no
necessity
for carrying the inquiry further; since to one
or other of these heads may every phenomenon of
dreaming be referred.
To adopt the hypothesis, therefore, that dream-
ing is a
phenomenon of mind, is as absurd as it is
unphilosophical; and, more than this, it is de-
grading; for if dreaming be the pure actings of
mind left uncontrolled, of what character must that
mind be, whose spiritual actings are of so absurd,
so incongruous, so irrational, so weak, and so
wicked a manifestation? Wliat, indeed, would
be the probable character of heaven, if peopled
with minds, whose uncontrolled actings produce
effects like these? To suppose for dreaming, there-

fore, any other than a cerebral cause is unphdo-
sop/zical, because unnecessary ; but it is mischievous
in its consequences, because it degrades spiritual
man from his own level to that of the inferior
animals.
But perhaps we shall have some highly-valued
friend and ally, still clinging to the spiritual hypo-
thesis of dreaming; and that, too, upon the sup-
position that it affords evidence of the immortality
of the soul, from its unceasing action. Now were
this admitted as a fact, we should say that we have
already shown the character of the actions of such
soul; and we
apprehend, that none will wish to
claim immortality for such actings. Yet if these
he the uncontrolled promptings of spirit, when the
body is asleep, they must show the nature of that
spirit; and therefore it is not unfair to accept them
as
offering such demonstration; and loaded with
such consequences, none but an infidel-none but
he who wishes to blot out an hereafter from the
sacred page of truth, will be willing to take dreams
as the offspring of spirit, or as evidence of an im-
mortal nature.
Take for an instant the high qualities of mental
operation, during the waking hours, and contrast,
ing them with the phenomena of dreaming, it will
be seen, that the latter are
wanting in the mani-
festations of the former; it will be seen that there
is no reason, no reflection, no
judgment, no com-
parison, no mental will; the images presented
follow each other without legitimate sequence, and
by associations over which we have no control.

or BODY AND MIND. 401
But if the phenomena of dreaming present attri-
butes which are not according to the workings of
spirit, and if they are
dqicient in the necessary
attributes of mind, the conclusion is surely irre-
sistible, that they are not mental processes, and
only possess that semblance because they are pro-
duced by irritation of the ORGAN
ty" mind. The
term mental will has been employed designedly
because in some dreams there is a
great appearance
of volition, as in sleep-walking, or
talking, or
changing the position ; or in olfensive or defensive
or fearful movements, according to the character
of the dream. But on close investigation it will
be seen, that all these are
imperfect; they possess
bodily but not mental volition; the speech is in-
distinct, confused, and imperfect, and the other
movements partake the same character.
But again, dreaming is a morbid action, never
existing in the best state of health, and always to
be found when the body is disordered, and es-
pecially, perhaps, when that disorder affects the
digestive organs, because of their intimate sym-
pathy with the brain. The dreams of feverish
sleep, the nightmare of hot suppers, the visions,
the voices of impending malady, are
familiarly
known and expected; the sleep of health is not
scared by uneasy dreams, while the pillow of the
invalid is as
certainly haunted by broken slumbers,
and all the fearful imagery of an irritated brain.
The author has elsewhere asserted, and he now
repeats the assertion, that the character of dreams
is impressed by the position and connexion of the

402 THE REc1P1;ocAL INFLUENCE
disturbed organ; and that the time will come.
when dreams will be classified according to that
disturbed organ; and, when reasoning inversely,
the irritated organ will admit of being predicated
from the character of the dreams.
In every such case, dreaming is produced by the
uneasy state of some one
organ, whose function
is more or less disturbed ; and by this disturbance,
the extremities of nerves with which it is supplied,
are also irritated; this irritation is propagated
backwards to their origin; certain fibres of the
brain's structure partake this distant organic irri-
tation, and dreaming is the consequence.
Thus, then, dreaming is a
purely physical pro-
cess ; and although upon the principle above-men-
tioned, the character of the dream is dependent
upon irritation of nervous fibre; yet it will often-
times partake that of impressions made during the
waking hours. Still, it is irritation of nervous
fibre-not mental action-which forms its essential
characteristic; and the ethereal spirit of man has
actually nothing more to do with dreaming than
that it is associated with the brain, and that, during
waking, the brain is its _manifesting organ, and its
servant.
It has been alleged as a
proof of the mental origin
of dreams, that the process is so
rapid-so far too
rapid for any bodily operation, that it must be
mental, spiritual, partaking of that action which
is unclogged by matter, unimpeded by time, and
unimpaired by space. But this argument really
avails nothing, although the premises were
granted,

viz. that in dreaming the process is infinitely more
rapid than in thouglzt ; so that a
very long dream
may be passed through in an instant of time,-in
a
space infinitely too small for a similar operation
of mind.
The truth is, that the action of the brain, when
dissociated from the mind, is far more rapid, than
when under its control; that so
long as it is under
the dominion of judgment, there must be a certain
space of time, though confessedly a small one, to
perceive the impressions, to reason
upon and com-
pare them--to judge of their truth or falsehood-
to consider their relative connexions-to weigh
their importance-to decide upon the feeling, the
doctrine, the opinion, which may arise out of such
mental process; and all this is unnecessary in
dreaming. The impression is made directly or
indirectly upon certain nervous fibres, and these are
linked in with certain others which are, or even
have been formerly associated, but in wild and
inextricable confusion; and in that fantastic kind
of grouping, which happens from taking up any
number of these irritated nervous fibres, at perfect
hazard, and without the remotest except an acci-
dental connexion-a connexion of contiguity only,
-and even this is ever
changing; the slightest
movement of the body, a new impulse of the blood,
or
any other trivial cause, which will give a move-
ment to the little broken bits of organic reminis-
cences, so that the pattern of the kaleidoscope of
life shall be changed, and shall be ever
changing,

404 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
action. Thus, then, it appears that the rapid action
of dreaming is against, instead of in favour, of its
being an intellectual process, since the one requires
time for the developement of reasoning affinities,
the other has none such to develope.
Hence, in the phenomena of dreaming there is
no mental manifestation; and conversely tried by
this test, it will be found, that no intellectual process
will produce dreaming. To this may be objected
the fact of waking dreams. We apprehend, that
the objector would not admire the application of
this doctrine to himself; or admit that at any time
during his waking moments, his thoughts really
assumed the wild fantasies of dreaming; and if he
did, we should know that such an one needed an
asylum to preserve himself and others from risk.
But the truth is, that waking dreams or reveries are
not intellectual processes, and are sometimes in-
dulged expressly in order to afford rest to the
intellect, and to give the reins to the imagination.
But the waking dreamer is conscious of his wander-
ings, and may be recalled at will to the sober
realities of life, and is ashamed of ever having
deviated from them. It is a morbid, not a healthy
process, and one, which if indulged in, has a most
serious influence in weakening the powers of mental
manifestation; and, therefore, it cannot be that
a
healthy process of mental action can ever
produce
such disordered manifestations, so destructive to
intellectual health, so
injurious to the well-being
of cerebral organisation.
There are other analogous states of the brain,

depending upon certain morbid conditions of the
system, as in that well-known form of delirium
during fever, which consists in the incessant talking
of the patient, and with the putting together of the
most incoherent images, though oftentimes with
something like a characteristic grouping. This
is always done without effort and without injury;
the patient seems rather amused with his own
creations, and if allowed to pursue his own
images
uninterrupted by the kindness of injndicious friends,
wishing to correct his erroneous impressions, he
goes on; no mental effort is required, no mental
exhaustion follows; a
proof that this process in-
volves no mind, and that it is confined to simple
irritation of nervous fibre. All that such patients
require is to be watched, because the nerves of
volition and locomotion may be disturbed, and
they might get out of bed, or do other injury to
themselves unprotected. In this last word, lies
the secret of management; patients require protec-
tion, not instruction, much less opposition.
Sleep-walking very naturally follows, as another
state of irritation of the brain. This invariably
happens as the consequence of dreaming; the con-
gestion, fulness, or irritation of a distant organ,
often gives rise to dreaming of an analogous cha-
racter; and the associated muscles act, though
independent of the will. Sometimes, under similar
circumstances, muscular action seems to be sus-
pended or impaired, as that of the diaphragm in
some forms of nightmare, in which the sense of
distress referred to this part is very great. Su,

406 Tm; IIECIPIIOCAL INFLUENCE
when a dream may have irritated the voluntary
and locomotive nerves, there is often a
consequent
action; the patient is about to Hy from some object
of terror, or other pressing danger, and may thus
walk out of the window, &c. Yet it is manifest in
all this, that the mind is not alive to its dangers ;
or it would not incur absolute risk to escape that
which was
imaginary, at least unless insane, a form
of cerebral disorder which we shall notice pre-
sently. In truth, there is simple irritation of
nervous fibre, prompting to locomotion, and no-
thing more; the whole is a dream, but the in'i-
tation of nervous fibre is differently situated.
There are some forms of hysteria which may
not be passed over, in noticing disturbed mental
manifestations, arising from irritation of the brain.
It is probable, that every attempt to pierce the
cloud which envelopes nervous action, and the
connecting links which maintain the communi-
cation between body and mind, will be unavailing.
Yet there are constitutions in which the nervous
temperament largely predominates, and in which
the most extraordinary effects arise from appa-
rently slight causes. Thus, for instance, under
such circumstances, a
slight mental emotion will
be sufficient to alter, or even to suspend, the action
of the heart, to produce violently-disordered res-
piration ; to give rise to spasm of the voluntary
and involuntary muscles; to alter the character of
the secretions ; to occasion violent pain where there
is no
apparent cause of pain ; to suspend the action
of the brain, leaving the patient quite unconscious;

or to produce perverted manifestations of its
action, as in involuntary crying and laughter;
or in altering the temper, disposition, and charac-
ter of the individual; or in producing that form
of mental alienation, which, but for its short dura-
tion, would be properly termed insanity. Pain
in the head, of a
peculiar character, remarkable
for its violence, and from the small space to which
it is referred, is a
very common
consequence of the
hysterical paroxysm; and yet all this shall pass,
and in a few hours-perhaps in a few minutes-
the patient shall be perfectly well again; suffering
only from languor and exhaustion. It is quite
impossible to follow out the various bodily ailments
which are
dependent upon an
hysterical condition
of the nervous
system, remarkable for the disturb-
ance
they produce at the time; for their great
variety and frequent change of symptom; and for
their passing away, and leaving not a trace behind.
All we wish to show is, how greatly the actions of
body and manifestations of mind are
perverted,
by even a
temporary and a
slight functional dis-
turbance of the centre of the nervous and sentient
system.
Again, in the very simple phenomenon of _faint-
ing, there is a
temporary suspension of the action
of the brain, by which all the functions of intelli-
gence are
interrupted by the mere failure of the
heart to supply a sufiicient quantity of blood to the
head. And this, too, will sometimes be produced
by a
primary action upon the nervous
system; a
sudden fright-an emotion of any kind--a disagree-

able sight-a peculiar odour-a painful reminis-
cence-an apprehensive foresight, will often pro-
duce fainting, temporary death, during which there
is a more or less complete suspension of the vital
powers; and which, if not judiciously treated, has
often terminated in real and positive death. A
disposition to frequent fainting is not uncommon,
though it may not amount to a
complete suspension
of action; and this is a
very painful state, as it
tends most entirely to unfit its subject for thought,
and other intelligent manifestation; and yet not
to take away the consciousness of such morbid
condition. This is a state much to be deprecated,
and one of the greatest mental suffering, in conse-
quence of the extent to which the manifestations
of mind are
impaired while the patient remains
feelingly alive to the change.
There are other states of suspended animation
which wear still more
intimately the appearance
of death, as in the consequences of drowning and
other similar forms of suffocation. In these cases,
the effect produced is purely cerebral; it would be
quite absurd to suppose, that the rational and
intellectual thinking person were thus subjected
to a kind of temporary annihilation. The truth is,
that it is uninfluenced by these changes; but its
manifesting organ has become incapable of per-
forming its duty; the connecting link has been
severed, and the manifestations of mind are no
longer to be traced, because the mangfesting organ
is no longer capable of itsfzmction.
So also, in apoplexy, it is seen, that the being

who is this moment full of life and spirits, capable
of the highest reach of intellect, devoted to literary
pursuits, in the full tide of intellectual and spiritual
purpose, in the most perfect enjoyment of the
largest attributes of man, is suddenly, in a moment,
arrested -is prostrate, unconscious -
paralytic,
with a mass of infirmities of the most painful
order-imbecile or childish-the wreck of what
he once was; all his best feelings perverted-
all his brilliant coruscations clouded -
all his
solid intellectual properties gone-ay, fledfor ever ;
and why? Because the vessels of the brain have
become congested-or perhaps a little clot of blood
has been occasioned in some part of that organ;
for in the severe cases, death generally ensues in a
few hours. Now, in all this sudden arrest of mental
manifestation, it is not to be believed that the
source of intellect is destroyed; but only that the
mode of communication is interrupted, and conse-
quently the manifestations are not perceived ; it is
the fault of the organ, which has undergone a
change unfitting it for its function.
The same results will occasionally happen from
accident; as from a blow upon the head, which
without producing any serious mischief, may, and
often does, in one instant suspend the manifestations
of mind; and in certain states of great debility and
exhaustion from other causes, the brain ceases to
be capable of carrying out its functions adequately;
its actions are often perverted; and the mental
manifestations become irritable, peevish, and vacil-
lating, fretful, annoyed by triiies, driven from its

own centre, and seriously intent upon frivolous or
unmeaning pursuits. So also in other temporary
disturbances of tl1e body, as of the stomach, a very
trifling alteration of action in that viscus is sufli-
cient to overturn the healthy workings of mind, by
irritating the nervous fibre, and thus giving rise
to all sorts of dark and gloomy associations, and
images, to illusions and hallucinations without end.
In all these cases of irritation of the brain, whe-
ther direct, as from some morbid action set up iu
itself; or indirect, as in some distant nervous irrita-
tion, thrown back upon the brain; or associated, as
in the case of mental emotion frat disturbing that
organ, or
giving rise to other visceral disturbances,
which in its reflex influence destroys the equipoise
of cerebral action : in all these cases, one and the
same effect is produced ; the organ for the manifes-
tation of mind has been rendered incapable of pur-
suing its function; and disorder or disease is the
consequence.
That this organic disturbance is not, however,
asimple overturn of function on the part of the
brain, that brain being considered as the final cause
of thought, (or being the organ of which mentation
is the function) is shown by various arguments be-
fore adduced ; and still further, by the internal
consciousness which attends some of these states of
suspended animation. In many hysterical condi-
tions of the system, and in some instances of faint-
ing, it is quite certain, that although the manifes-
tations of mind are suspended, the interior workings
are still going on, as evinced by the patient pos-

sessing an entire recollection of all that has passed
during the interval.
The same is noticed in dreaming: though this
process is going on, and the most incongruous
images are presented, with all the vivid reality of
truth; yet the interior moi is conscious, that all
this is only a dream, or manifestation of perverted
action of the brain, not the over-action of mind
communicated through that organic medium.
So also in cases of suspended animation con-
tinuing for a
long time, the patient has been con-
scious of the wailing of friends around his supposed
corpse; he has witnessed the preparations for l1is
own interment; and l1as had a knowledge of all the
horrors which surrounded him, yet without having
power enough over the manifesting organ to set it
in motion. Now these things clearly show the
distinction between presiding mind, and performing,
or functional brain ; the latter is affected ; its oH'ice
is disturbed-perverted, nay, annihilated, while the
mind remains conscious of its integrity, of its own
power, and of that power being insufficient to
command the action of the nervous fibre. Proof
cannot be more
complete of the independent origin,
yet mutually dependent function of mind and its
subservient organ.
But we turn to another part of this subject, the
influence of the gradual decay of the organ upon
the manifestations of mind. Painful as is this
humiliating truth, it is nevertheless unquestionable;
and it involves much, and must therefore be ma-
turely considered. Now, we

412 THE arzciraociu. INFLUENCE
the manifestations of mind, that strength, and beauty,
and power, and extent of these manifestations, is by
no means to be found at the earlier part of life, nor
even in the highest maturity of the body, but per-
haps some ten or fifteen years after that body has
passed its zenith, and has been declining. Again,
then, we infer the mutual independence qfessence, of
body and mind; because the maturity of the two
do not correspond ; and because, so
long as we have
an
opportunity of watching the manifestations of
mind, before actual decay of the manifesting organ
has commenced, we see these manifestations still
progressing, still ripening, and we infer their capa-
city for a still onward reach ; and we who believe
in continued existence beyond the present, look
upon this as a state of progressive advance towards
a condition of life, infinitely superior in intellectual
and affective developement. -
But this continuous progress is obscured in the
great majority of instances, at least, leaving only a
sufficient number of exceptions to prove the truth of
the rule ; we see a cloud drawn over the manifesta-
tions of mind ; decay ofthe manifesting organ has set
in, and whatever may be the mental progress, we no
longer perceive it; the light of mental life is gra-
dually quenched in the twilight and sunset of bodily
vigour.
This change will occur in different individuals,
at very varying periods of life. In some, in whom
tl1e nervous fibre has been originally feeble, or in
whom it has been intensely stretched by deep
thought, by anxious solicitude, by the misery of

domestic trial, by the turmoil of passion, or
by the
stirring events and associations of party and of poli-
tics, the approach of this state of decay will be
visible at a much earlier period. So, also, when
the brain has been irritated by intemperance of any
kind, or where it has been goaded into action by
the excitement of wine, spirits, opium, &c., its
wretched imbecility will be precociously found.
Yet, under all circumstances, when the strictest
care has been taken to maintain the vigour of
the brain itself, and of all the associated organs
and functions, and when that brain has also origi-
nally been a
strong one, even here, a
gra-
dual decay does take place. Perhaps this is first
noticed by the individual, in his having less power
to command the faculty of attention ; he is obliged
more frequently to read, and re-read his author,
before he can
appropriate his meaning; not that
the thing is diflicult, but that, as he says and feels,
he cannot give his mind to it ; meaning, that he can-
not direct the attention of the brain upon the object
of pursuit; or, that that brain has lost power and
obedience; in other words, that decay has com-
menced.
Theloss of the power of collectingand concentrating
the thoughts soon follows. It is impossible to think
closely without the habit of concentration; and
henceit will be found, that old persons take partial
views of subjects and opinions, and become much
attached to their own views, with very little reason
to support them; and precisely because they
cannot concentrate their thoughts on the object in

question, so as to take in at once, enlarged and
accurate views of the subject : these views, in fact,
become more
prejudices than results drawn from
accurate and just argumentation : and, by degrees,
as the shadows of even-tide thicken, the aged become
the easy prey of the best casuist.
The consciousness of this loss of power, leads to
considerable peevishness and irritability; the aged
become impatient of contradiction, and without
being able to render a reason fortheir own
opinions,
they very much dislike the accuracy of their con-
clusions to be impugned, and are
disposed to sub-
stitute petulance for argument. In fact, a con-
sciousness of weakness leads to a demonstration of
irritability, rather than to an acknowledgment of
inability to cope with reasoning.
One step further, and this diminishedipower
over the action of the brain is supplanted by that
organ becoming rebellious, escaping the control of
the mind, and listening to, and acted upon by, its
own
suggestions. These suggestions are
by the
supposition involuntary; that is, they arise as a
symptom of decaying vigour, and as a
proof that
the brain ceases to occupy its proper place in the
animal economy, and to be that eflicient servant of
mind, which is according to the perfect order of
nature. The bordering of these involuntary sugges-
tions upon the varying forms of insanity, in the
production of illusions, hallucinations, Scc., will be
readily seen, and will be more
particularly noticed
in a
subsequent page.

symptoms of decay assume a
very different form,
according to the existing state of the constitution,
and to the preceding habits of the patient. And it
is perhaps one of the most diflicult problems of
medical science, to distinguish between symptoms
which arise from exhaustion, and those which are
produced by oppression. Yet it is of great import-
ance to determine, since the mode of treatment
peculiarly adapted to either would be prejudicial to
the ot/zer.
The appearances of decay vary in some
pretty
distinct features, accordingly as
they arise from
exhaustion of the brain, or from congestion of its
vessels; from sensorial torpor or
irritability; from
sluggish or excited vascular action; or
perhaps,
more than all, from nervous irritation, accompa-
nied by an undefined apprehension of coming or
impending evil, which makes the patient hesitat-
ing, uncertain in his determination, and much
given to change. We will endeavour to trace
some distinctive peculiarities according to the
prevalence of one or other of these states.
a. In exhaustion of the brain, there is commonly
a sense of distress about the head, oftentimes severe
headache, accompanied by a
quick pulse-the pulse
of efort-with corresponding vascular action
about the head; great disposition to wakefulness:
the patient is painfully conscious that his brain
requires absolute rest, and yet he is scared by un-
easy broken slumbers, much dreaming, and a
thousand waking fancies; the studious employ-

416 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
ment of the brain is very onerous, and aggravates
the symptoms.
b. In congestion of the brain, the characteristic
feature is torpor, and diminished sensibility to
impression; there is a dull heavy weight about
the head, and oftentimes giddiness; the pulse
is slow, full, and labouring; there is a
great feel-
ing of weakness, amounting in some cases to
entire prostration of strength: the patient is very
sleepy,-the sleepiness is oppressive during the
day, and uninterrupted during the night; the
brain is benefited by some exertion, and especially
by bodily exercise; and it even
supports intel-
lectual action with advantage, provided it be not
too great; the perceptions are dull, and there is a
great disposition to contemplate the gloomy side of
circumstances and events.
c. In sensorial torpor, which is by no means
always dependent upon congestion, though some-
times connected with it, there is considerable altera-
tion of mental manifestation; and since in the
earlier stages there is not much visible malady,
the unfortunate patient very generally gets blamed
for something wrong in his morale. Thus a
prevailing indolence of manner and conduct is
often ascribed to the want of mental industry,
when it is occasioned by physical infirmity; the
patient lies in bed, when he ought to be up; he
will be found indolently lounging upon his sofa,
when he ought to be studying; the letter-writing
of to-day will be postponed till to-morrow; the

ride, the walk, the errand of charity, the matter
of business, will be all subjected to a similar pro-
crastination ; there is the absence of interest in all
he says and does: he appears to want the proper
amount of relative and social feeling; and he is
inattentive to the wants, the desires, the entreaties
of those around him. By-and-bye, cerebral ma-
lady stands out in full force; the cause of all this
alteration of character becomes acknowledged;
the deepening shades of sensorial torpor lead to
much physical infirmity, and then to the gradual
extinction of life. This state is very generally the
result of great over-action of the brain, which ter-
minates in the loss of nervous
power, and in a
slow but disorganising alteration of some
portion
of its substance.
d. Precisely opposed to this state is the form of
irritable brain. This seems to be dependent also
upon some
preceding unwonted action, during
which the fibre is rendered too susceptible to im-
pression, and the brain has not power enough to
control that irritability. The subject of this state
feels excessively the merest trifles; he does not
brood over them as in torpor, but he is rendered
quick-irritable-irascible-easily wounded-prone
to take offence, and always seems to be on the
qui vive for something to awaken this irritability.
It is diflicult to preserve such a
temperament in
good-humour with himself and others; and the
actions resulting from this state, too generally
betray want of thought and judgment.

will occasion a considerable difference in the ma-
nifestations of mind, and this without producing
congestion on the one hand, or
inflammatory
action on the other, but only that kind either of
slow or of excited vascular action, which is quite
compatible with ordinary health. This may be
characteristic of the individual, and as such may
be called constitutional ; or it may exist for a
time only, and be occasioned by some
great phy-
sical, moral, or mental cause. If the vascular
action be excited, the brain receives more blood
than its function requires, besides the mechanical
movement which it derives from the frequently
repeated impulsion of that fluid upon its fibre,
through the infinitely minute ramifications of the
arterial system. The consequence of this is, an
excited state of the organ ; the ideas flow rapidly ;
the conceptions are more brilliant; the imagina-
tion is more fertile; the perception is more acute,
the feelings intense, the judgment more accurate;
and if this state be preserved within the boundary
line of health, good is produced. But it is a dan-
gerous pinnacle, rarely lasts long, and is com-
monly succeeded by that sluggish action of the
veins, which results from their having received
more than their ordinary supply during this stage
of excitement, and having gradually lost their
power of getting fairly quit of it in due time for
the next quantity. The result is this; the want of
action in the veins is for the time supplied by a.
little more
energy in the arteries, superseding by
the vis <2 tergo the diminished action in the veins.

But it is more than can be accomplished by such
effort; and the arterial action becomes accommo-
dated to the slow venous movement, always sup-
posing that actual disease has not been produced.
And now the ideas become obtuse; they are diffi-
cultly elaborated. Reading is a burden; every
cerebral effort is marked by painfulness; the
student, the author, drags heavily through his
work; it is done, but done with effort, without
animation, badly done; there is much disposition
to drowsiness, which is not easily removed, accom-
panied by a
great deal of general languor, a pre-
vailing indifference and distaste for thought, and a
feeble, hesitating, vacillating, and ever-changing
judgment.
ji Lastly, we notice an undefined form of ner-
vous irritation, accompanied by an
apprehension
of impending evil. It is probably diflicult to con-
ceive any great efl`ect to be produced upon the
nervous fibre, without involving at least some con-
siderable alteration in the vascular action. And
we
fully admit that considerable vascular disturb-
ance MAY canst; but if' it be so, it is not cognizable.
And it is quite certain that in many of the heavier
forms of cerebral disorder there may be lesion of
nervous fibre producing paralysis, where there
shall not have previously existed any remarkable
vascular disturbance, and where it shall not even
exist at the time, except as a
consequence of' such
injury. And if' this be the casein instances of
graver laesion, and the fibres may be actually torn
without much vascular excitement, it follows that

much irritation of nervous Ebre may exist without
a
corresponding vascular change. Experience
supports this reasoning, for it is not uncommon
to find this kind of patient exceedingly nervous,
absurdly fearful, as it might be called-too diflident
to act-too distrustful to be firm-too wavering to
be relied upon, and with a
prevailing expectation
of future evil,-that evil, varying in character from
the common ills of life, its disorders and its trou-
bles, to the highest possible evil to fallen man, viz.
his exclusion from the hope of forgiveness, of hap-
piness, of heaven.
The present may be a fit moment for observing,
that all these states of disordered brain are pecu-
liarly liable to spectral illusions, to hallucinations,
and to varying forms of insanity. There is still
so great a belief in the mental origin of these forms
of cerebral disturbance, that it is necessary to notice
them particularly.
Spectral illusions are
generally dependent upon
irritation of the brain, produced either by something
wrong in itself, by impending important disease,
or
by the actual presence of some
organic irritation
suflicient to prevent its healthy function. Spectral
illusions may, however, be produced in several
ways. In order to the completion of correct sen-
sation, and of its perception by the mind, there
must be first a
healthy organ of sense, upon which
the impression must be made; the nerves which
transmit that impression must be healthy; and the
brain which accepts, perceives, and appropriates
that impression, must be healthy. lf any one of

these links be faulty, illusion is produced. If,
for instance, the expanded retina be unhealthy,
unreal objects may be perceived; if the optic nerve
be unsound, the impression correctly made upon the
retina may be perverted in its transmission to the
brain; and even if all shall have gone on well
hitherto, and the brain be only pre-occupied, it
will not perceive at all, but the impression will
pass unheeded ; and if it shall have been subjected
to
any form of disorder, illusions of various kinds
will be produced. These vary considerably; but
they may be expected, wherever any one of these
links is defective, or in a state of irritation: and
especially that form of disturbed cerebral move-
ment, which consists in spectral illusions, very
generally originates with the third, or last link, in
this chain of organic causation.
It is, therefore, treading very closely, and may,
perhaps, almost be said to blend intimately with that
form of cerebral error which has been termed hal-
lucination. It has been considered, and perhaps
with justice, that this is not an error of impression
upon the organ of sense; nor a
perversion of that
impression on its way back to the sentient prin-
ciple, but that it originates in the brain, and is
altogether unconnected with the organ of sense.
The brain is irritated in some of the various ways,
to which we have already described its liability,
and it is so, either immediately by some commo-
tion within itself, or
by the sudden conversion of
some other form of disorder; or
by sympathy with
the irritation of some distant organ. The second

is a
very remarkable form of disorder; when some
distant irritation ceases all at once, and is converted
into cerebral malady, assuming, and unhappily
often continuing in, the form of hallucination. If
the original malady can be reproduced, the secon-
dary evil will probably be relieved; but when this
cannot be the case, it remains oftentimes a
per-
manent but morbid modification of nervous action.
We know not how this is produced, as we often
are ignorant of final causes; without, therefore,
being too curious to pry into Nature's plans, be it
ours, humbly and modestly, to obtain acquaintance
with the #eats and to guard against them if pos-
sible.
In each of thesetcases, however, when hallucina-
tion is once produced, the brain has escaped the
province of reason; argument is unavailing; the
organ is no
longer submissive to mental authority;
it is no
longer controlled by external realities; it
has escaped beyond the dominion of the external
senses on the one hand, or of the presiding mind
on the other; there is no method of combating
hallucination but by the subduction of every morbid
cerebral action, whether immediate or
sympathetic ;
and, consequently, the first, the last, the only re-
medy, is to watch over and direct the morbid action,
till the brain re-assumes its healthy function, and
puts an end to all the "
perilous stuff, which dreams
are made of."
The course of our
inquiry has brought us down
to the extreme verge of reason, and to the com-
mencement of insanity,-a form of malady which

or BODY AND MIND. 423
requires some little developement; and first, we
must notice some of the phenomena of cerebral
disorder. But before doing so, we should just
remark the disadvantage of calling this class of
diseases mental, and therefore thinking and reason-
ing, as if they were
spiritual ailments. We have
no
objection to the term, if employed to designate
disorders of the organ of mind; but there is an
evident confusion of idea on this subject, and often-
times a
misappre/zension, by which it is understood,
that the term is applicable to mental as contradis~
tinguished from bodily disorder. There is also
a
prevailing dislike to acknowledge the present or
past existence of any such malady in oneself, or
one`s connexions ; and, indeed, it is most carefully
concealed as if some moral guilt or shame attached ;
just as if it were a
malady in any way differing
from an affection of the stomach, or of any other
organ of the body. This, however, arises from its
being thought to be a disorder of the morale; and
one which entails disgrace, rather than excites
compassion towards the sufferer.
It is allowed that no other bodily infirmity pro-
duces an
equal degree of misery to friends and re-
latives, because it affects the organ devoted to the
manifestations of mind, and strikes at once at all
the powers and privileges of man. But it is not
on this account that its wretched victims are to be
treated as outcasts from society, and fitted only for
incarceration; the greater the amount of suffering,
the more strenuous should be the effort to relieve
it; and it should never be forgotten, that these

remedies should be twofold, of a
physical and moral
nature, so as to operate largely upon the disturbed
organ, through the medium of its organisation and
afinities. No other organ is so
favourably situated
for being acted upon; yet on no other organ are
mistakes so
perpetually made: one set of reasoners
employing only spiritual remedies and moral
means; the other utterly despising this treatment,
and believing that nothing is to be done except by
physical agency. As it has been said, the truth
lies between the two; and every person wishing to
treat insanity properly, will not only seek to subdue
the inordinate, or rouse the languid vascular action;
will not only seek to repair any injury to the
nervous fibre; but will likewise combat hallucina-
tions, and substitute correct impressions-strengthen
these impressions by judicious repetition-remove
perverted trains of reasoning-replace them by
correct ones--and give them the power and in-
fluence of habit and frequent association.
Unfortunately, perseverance, though a cardinal
virtue in all that is good, does not often fall to the
lot of man ; when met by repeated disappointment,
he becomes wearied, and fancies that nothing is to
be done, because it has not been done already.
And it is readily granted, that the work is very
onerous, of seeing a
patient from day to day, and
of combating as often the insane ideas, and to be
met every day by fresh arguments in their support,
or
by the reiteration of old ones; yet such must
be done patiently, if there be any hope of success.
It should always be recollected, that permanent

or Bom' AND MIND. 425
impressions upon the nervous fibre seem to be very
diflicultly made, whether in health or disease.
This appears to be one of its peculiarities, that
while its impressions are received with great quick-
ness, they have need to be frequently repeated,
in order to ensure their permanence. This is seen
in the process of education; how frequently re-
peated, and how constantly forgotten is the im-
pression, which is made upon the intellectual
nerves, in communicating the first rudiments of
knowledge! How frequently has the instructor
to lament that he is just where /ze began, and how
necessary it is to repeat impressions frequently,
in order to ensure their permanence ! So also with
respect to its physiological laws; let a nerve be
divided, or let any other injury be inflicted upon
it, how much longer is it before the reparation is
accomplished, than of any other structure of the
body ! So also in the production of insane ideas;
it is only the constant image which produces the
monomaniac; it is only the line upon line, precept
upon precept, that will give any prospect of relief;
it is only by keeping in view the fact, that great
changes are not to be effected on the nervous
system except by time and by a
frequent repetition
of the means
employed.
There are those who employ the fact of brutes
being free from insanity, to prove, on the one
hand, that this malady must be an affection of
mind independent of body; and on the other, to
show, that it is an affection of structure, without
any reference to its function. Both are incorrect.

426 THE nncrrnocm. INFLUENCE
That the lower animals are not subject to this form
of malady is certain; hydrophobia, the mad~
staggers, and some other forms of disorder, being
clearly not to be paralleled with insanity, although
equally clearly affections dependent upon the
cerebral system, in the same
way as
apoplexy,
epilepsy, and paralysis, are not insanity. The
simple reason why animals are not insane, is, that
the brain wants the function which is necessary for
the developement and manifestation of man's super-
added princnzle, viz. MIND.
They are
subject to
inflammation of the brain, or its membranes; but
this does not produce the disturbance of a function
which they do not possess ; consequently their
freedom from insanity only shows the absence of
that function which we
previously know they do
not possess; and which, if possessing, they could
not employ, because their brain has not been fitted
for its manifestations.
On the other hand, the absence of animal insanity
has been brought forward to prove, that this form
of disorder is an
afection of structure, without re-
ference to mind. For it is said, animals possessing
brain are not insane; man
possessing the same
kind of brain, though fitted to his more
perfect
organisation, is su®ect to insanity; diseases happen
to one class of animals, which are unknown to ano-
ther; therefore this is a disease attaching to the
Mons
perfect, and unknown to the LESS developed
structure ; thus resting in organisation, and having
no reference to function, at least so far as its origin
is concerned. The object of this reasoning is to

dispose of the influence of mind upon matter ; and
to supersede the idea of man being any thing beyond
what his organisation makes him; and thus to
lead to his entire irresponsibility.
Now the fact is, that both in the production of
disorder, and in its cure, the brain, as the organ
in a state of irritation, is acted upon by moral and
by physical agencies; and in monomania it will
almost always be found to take the character of
the moral impression which pre-occupied the suf-
ferer before the invasion of disease. Nor is this
extraordinary: the patient becomes the subject
of some deeply interesting, and largely-associated
moral affection ; one, perhaps, which involves the
happiness and comfort of himself and many others,
and very generally presenting a
gloomy prospect.
0n this the mind dwells with sombre reflection,
and still darker forebodings. Reason often dis-
sipates the cloud; but as soon as the reasoning
effort is past, the sky is again overcast, and involun-
tarily the mind returns to its chief object of
interest. The depth of that interest is daily in-
creasing; the reasoning efforts become few and
feeble; the power of resistance to the painful
images becomes less and less; the misery of the
present and the future is more
hopelessly contem-
plated, and even
indulged; the impressions upon
the nervous fibre, more and more
frequently re-
peated, become almost constant, without interval,
without change, without diminution of intensity,
till the nervous fibres have lost at least the habit
of conveying other notices; the morbid train be-

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
comes the exclusive idea ; man has passed the boun~
dary line of reason-is no
longer a
responsible
creature,-is insane/
Two remarkable instances of this kind will ex-
emplify the argument; one, a
gentleman, who,
having lived beyond his income, and fallen into
increasing dilliculties, became insane upon this
point-lived in apprehension of a
jail, of arrest,
and of all the maniacal miseries conjured up from
such a state, although there was no
danger of such
catastrophe, because he owed no one
anything,
and because, though his resources were
greatly
diminished, he had still enough, with proper ma-
nagement, to preserve him in ajluence. The
second instance is that of a
lady, who was pos-
sessed of a remarkable amount of intelligence, and
who had been placed in circumstances, in which
she had been obliged to exert her brain beyond
its power, and, in consequence of which exertiom
the integrity of that brain had been destroyed-
destroyed by intellectual over-action; and what
now was the character of her maniacal idea? That
she had no soul-that God had separated between
her soul and herself-that she had no moral duties
to perform-no commands to obey; there was a
severance of her former from her present self; and
it was such, that she could hold no communication
between her own
spiritual principle and the ex-
terior; and this extending into a thousand ramifi-
cations. Both these states were recovered from.
The fact is, that mental alienation, as it is called,
with all its species and innumerable varieties, dy"-

fers in nothing from other maladies, allowing for
the difference of organ and function. There are,
the same
period of incubation-the same premo-
nitory symptoms of disorder-the same transient
and slight derangement of function-the same
characteristic march of fully-formed disease-the
same advance and decline, marked, as in other
maladies, not by constant progression, but by oc-
casional advances and retrocessions-the one being
greater than the other, according as the xnalady is
loosening its hold, or narrowing its grasp upon the
system, and always being marked by this one fea-
ture, that in the former case, the entire ground
gained is never wholly lost,-and in the latter, the
entire ground lost is never
wholly regained:
exacerbation and remission, called, in the case of
insanity, paroxysm and lucid interval, are
always
to be found. Add to these points of similarity,
that its terminations are tl1e same; these being
in restoration to health, which leaves the patient
just as before the invasion of disorder ; or BY some
other form qf malady which seems to prove critical
of the more
important disorder ; or
by some alteration
of function which leaves the original integrity
more or less impaired; or
by some
change of
structure, which is marked by increasing disturb-
ance, and more cruelly perverted manifestations
of mind ; or, by the substitution of disease, and such
organic changes as are incompatible with restora-
tion to health; or, by complete loss of power, as
in idiocy, or atrophy ; or, by the gradual and com-

430 THE nncirnocu. INFLUENCE
plete extinction j life, cerebral lyk first, and then
also, general life.
It may be also added, that the treatment is the
same, for that kind of plan, which searches after
the originating cause of the disturbance-which
seeks to remove that cause-which endeavours to
abate its influence by the most appropriate means,
(in the case of insanity by means which sympathize
with, and soothe the patient in his imaginary sor-
rows-which partake his sufferings--which console
him-which revive his hopes-give confidence to
his timidity-remove his fears-relieve his discom-
forts, and throw a
ray of cheerfulness upon fi1turity,)
viz. to remove the immediate cause of mischief-to
disarm and abate the predisposing causes-to soothe
existing irritation-to control morbid action-and
to supersede it by the good actions of health ; these
are the simple principles upon which cerebral and
other disorder is to be met and combated, and suc-
cessfully removed.
But granting that insanity is dependent upon
cerebral disorder, how are we to detect this dis-
order? And what degrees of change from ordi-
nary mental manifestation constitute insanity ?
since it is allowed by all, that these manifestations
vary in different persons, and in the same
person
at different times. This is a
very important and
difiicult question ; since, by the premises, it is
shown that there can be no standard test of sound-
ness of mind so
long as sound minds admit of very
varying degrees and kinds of manifestation.

Thus it would appear, that what is insanity in one
may not be so in another ; that there is no absolute
standard of comparison; and that the 'question
must be decided by comparing the manifestations
which now
prevail, with those of a former date,
which may be said to have indicated the general
character, from which the present manifestations
differ so
widely as to constitute insanity.
Yet it must be seen that this subject is beset
by difiiculties; since in forming a
judgment upon
it, with regard to others, the _judge necessarily con-
siders himself as of sound mind; and the question
arises, is this the case? and who is to he the judge?
Since it is one of the remarkable features in in-
sanity, that the subject always thinks himself
right, and all others wrong, upon the particular
object of his deliration.
Again, there are
many varieties of mental mani-
festation so odd, that it is diilicult to say what kind
and degree of eccentricity may be tolerated, as con-
sistent with sound mind, or as the maximum of
allowed error; and on the contrary, to define the
minimum of unhealthy action, which _shall constitute
insanity.
Another difliculty presents itself in the complex
nature of man, viz. to separate physical from moral
agencies, and to ascribe to each its just influence
in the formation of character. There are certain
peculiarities oftemperament, which give their tinge
to thought and action ; but, then, these peculiarities
may have been fostered in one
by injudicious ma-
nagement, by want of control, by neglected or

erroneous education, by position in society, and by
many other circumstances and associations arising
out of such position ; and, again, these peculiarities
may have been sought out and detected, may have
been repressed, and watched over, and directed, and
guided, and governed by education-firmness-diy
cipline-will-and religious motive; and thus two
individuals with precisely similar temperaments,
will yet possess mental manifestations so
very dif-
ferent, that the one
may be considered soundness,
and the other unsoundness of mind. This has led
many persons to infer, that there was no such thing
as
sanity to be met with, except in the Omniscient
and Omnipotent God, and that each and every
individual was more or less insane. Now, although
this is certainly too sweeping a conclusion, it is yet
exceedingly difiicult to define the boundary, espe-
cially between physwbal infirmity and moral delin-
guency.
Perhaps the state of the will may serve to assist
our
way from the intricacies of this labyrinth, more
securely than any other clue; and yet, even here
it may be said, that the function of volition is more
readily distempered than any other; and that one
of the most prominent features of insanity, is the
feeble, vacillating will, the loss of sefcontrol, and
the absence of sefdiscipline. Now, this is granted ;
but it is to be remarked, that there is some diffe-
rence between the cerebral function of volition, and
the exercise of the moral will, which is exhibited
through its agency. At all events, till we
possess a
better test, we
may take this as our criterion, be-

tween physical injirmily, and moral delinquency.
Vhatsoever is willingly, determinately, conside-
rately, and deliberately done, must, il' it be wrong,
be placed to the score of moral wrong; and that
wrong which occurs without the support ofthe
will, independently of it, and even in opposition to
its general bearing, may be allowed to partake of
the nature of physical infirmity.
Now passion, anger, hatred, revenge, and all the
associated malignant passions, are, for example, to be
counted as moral evils, because they occur with the
will, notwithstanding that they appear much more
readily in an irascible temperament, than in one
ofa more
phlegmatic order; inasmuch as man is
responsible for his actions; and if he possess a tem-
perament more
easily excited than his neighbour,
it only becomes him to be watchful over it, the
more
guarded over all the avenues of passion, the
more strenuous in his opposition to evil, the more
zealous in the developement of better tendencies.
In a
healthy state of the mind, and of its mani-
festing organ, the former can
give laws to the latter,
can direct the attention to any given pursuit, can
arrest or
change the course of its thoughts and oc-
cupations, according to its own
pleasure; can fix
the attention upon any one
subject, so long as it
pleases; and can then divert it to another; the
transfer being a
pure, and distinct, and decisive act
of the will; or, instead of making this entire
change, it may direct the train of thought into
something analogous with former trains ; or it may
dismiss the subject altogether. This faculty may

434 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
be called self-possession, or the power of governing
the physical machinery by moral motives, and ap-
propriate stimuli.
Now, this power is lost in insanity! The brain
is no
longer the servant of mind; nervous fibre usurps
the supremacy, and beclouds, obscures, perverts,
or entirely supersedes, the mental manifestations.
Hence arise uncontrolled thoughts; images over
which the judgment has no influence ; imaginations
without foundation; impulses which are not to be
accounted for; apparently sound reasoning upon
false premises; constant change of purpose; action
without definite object ; disproportioned will, some-
times earnest over trifles, and almost nothing over
objects of primary importance; hence the little
reliance which can be placed on the promises of
the insane, or on
any appeal to the higher principles
of moral governance; hence the infinite variety of
shades of feeling in different insane persons, and in
the same individuals at different times; hence that
confusion, and jumbling together of incongruous
images, because there is no will to direct, no
judg-
ment to guide-no mind to govern the organic
movements.
Hence arises the great analogy between insanity
and dreaming. In both cases, the brain acts inde-
pendently of mind, and dissociated from the reason
and judgment ; in both cases the images are of the
most incongruous, grotesque, and confused descrip-
tion; in both instances there is a want of natural
cohesion; in both instances, there is to the indi-
vidual a semblance of the most perfect truth,

though, in fact, there is no truth ; in both instances
there is irritation of the cerebral fibre, and morbid
images are
produced as
arising out of such irrita-
tion, and all its physical associations. -
It will be observed, that in insanity, the morbid
manifestations of mind are often characterized by
the preceding history of the patient; by the pecu-
liarities of his temperament, by the propensities of
his character, by the revival of old associations, by
errors ofthe imagination, by some
bodily uneasi-
ness, and occasionally by a
mysterious change or
iniluence which we cannot fathom. In this, again,
there will be fonnd to be a
great analogy with
dreaming ; and the reason is obvious enough, that
when during a sane state, the brain has been accus-
tomed frequently to receive certain impressions;
and these impressions have been made upon an
organ, which, by nature, possesses some
peculiar
characteristics ; when the conduct through life, has
been marked by the particular expression of certain
habits and modes of thinking, speaking, and act-
ing; when there has been given a
preponderance
to the influence of the moral feelings, or of certain
other passions and propensities; when the imagi-
nation has been permitted an uncontrolled range,
in every possible way, during health; and when
there are a thousand and ten thousand associations,
connected with all these and manyother interme-
diate links; it is easy to comprehend how, when
dissociated from the governing principle, the brain
should take up the recollected impressions of all

these things, and should reproduce them in the
confused and heterogeneous images which consti-
tute insanity; a sufficient proof (if it were needed)
of this malady being cerebral ; and of that cerebrum,
as a
congeries of nervous bundles, being during its
healthy state under the control of another, and a
master principle, which we call mind.
As a further resemblance of dreaming, insanity
often takes its shape and form, from some
bodily
feelings. Very recently there has been under my
care a
patient, who doubtless from many abdo-
minal feelings, conceived herself to be the sub-
ject of tape-worm ; and this idea, the predo-
minant one of her insanity, was
presented in an
infinitely varied series, so as to account for all her
sensations, and to verify all her present impressions
and future forebodings. It is scarcely necessary to
add, that she had no
tape-worm; and that in her
case, insanity resulted from chronic dzlsorganisation
of the brain.
There are some
powerful mental emotions, which
are oftentimes mentioned as the causes of insanity ;
such are the passion of love, or the deep influence
of religion. It may be so in some few instances ;
but we are much inclined to believe, that these are
effects rather than causes; and that the brain,
already pre-disposed to insanity, is excited by the
stirring emotions of these powerful principles ; and
that with its insane bias, it produces, under the
influence of strong excitement, insane ideas, which
naturally take the shape of that cerebral commotion,

which has been so
powerfully excited: and then
are exhibited those phenomena, which, by unthink-
ing persons, are called causes
of insanity.
This perhaps, in speculative matters, might not
be very important, though even
speculative error is
sure to be followed by injurious results. But it is
a matter of much consequence, when applied, as it
too often is, to throw discredit upon religion, with
which an
'irreligious world is but too highly grati-
fied. Now religion, properly so called, is the
greatest soother of life's cares, the best balm for
all its sorrows, the great cure for all its wounds,
the only secure
refuge from all its contumelies, and
the best safeguard for the integrity of the brain.
Religion in itself, with all its moral sanctions, is
the best preserver from the influence of animal pas-
sions and propensities, and the best regulator of all
the affections of the heart; it is the surest guide
through all the intricacies of life's mazy course,-
through all the labyrinths of society,-through the
difliculties and trials of its relationship. Religion,
then, affords the best security for the tempest-tossed
brain ; it gives peace during the storm-quiet de-
pendence upon the care and guidance of Provi-
dence; and the highest hopes of happiness at the
end of the present course, to those who obey its pre-
cepts, and are
guided by its requirements: hence it
cannot of itself produce insanity.
Butitis allowed, that when a_brain is thus predis-
posed, and its possessor is, from some circumstances,
induced to attend to religion, which had been be-
fore neglected, it is perfectly possible that the sense

438 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
of this neglect may be so
frequently and so
power-
fully repeated as to become the exclusive idea;
that there should follow the very natural transition,
of having forfeited by this neglect, all claim to its
consolations, and of having incurred the anger of
God, and become subject to all the consequences of
final impenitence : and then it is perfectly possible,
that such an exclusive idea should become an
insane idea, and should overset the integrity of the
brain.
There are also mistakes in religion, which would
produce a similar influence; as, in taking only
partial views of its great doctrines, which lead away
the mind from truth, and tix it upon some
positiw
error, or upon some misunderstood, or
misapplied
doctrine; or
upon some injudicious and exclusive
view of God's attributes, which by a similar pro-
cess would produce the same result. But it will be
seen at once, that this is not religion ; and that the
substitution of real religion, would be the best cure
for its extravagancies. It is not religion, but the
want of it, which oversets the brain.
This is powerfully confirmed by the fact, that in
all these cases, reasoning with the patients is un-
availing; they are either not accessible to truth, or
if they receive its impression for a moment, it is
directly obliterated ; the hallucination is not easily
to be worn down; and he who begins the treatment
of this form of insanity, by administering the con-
solations of religion, will assuredly fail, though they
will be of infinite importance by-and-bye, when
the irritation of the brain has been subdued by

physical agencies; and then the moral hopes, and
sanctions, and motivesofreligion, and its inseparable
handmaid, consistency of thought and action, will
be of infinite service, in quieting and fixing the
agitated and feeble cerebral fibres.
The non-existence of organic disease in the brain,
among many of those who have died insane, has
been adduced as a proof, that insanity was a
.Wiri-
tual, and not a cerebral disorder. The argument is
specious but unavailing, because contrary to fact.
In the first place, it is not at all extraordinary,
to find death produced from the disorder of some
one of the organs ofthe body, without leaving be-
hind it a trace of disorganisation. Yet there can
be no doubt, that there has existed disorder, and
disorder to such an extent, as to produce the death
of the organ, which local death has proved the
occasion of general death. This may have hap-
pened, and the appearances of disorganisation may
have passed away with life; or there may have
existed such an amount of disordered function, as
to be incompatible with the continuance of life,
although there shall be no traces of such destructive
influence. The latter is the more
probable solu-
tion of the difliculty. But if disordered function
may exist in an organ essential to life, to such an
extent as to produce local and general death, and
yet leave behind no traces of its existence, there
can be no
just reason why disordered cerebral func-
tion should not also exist during life, without leav-
ing behind it any cognizable change of tissue.
Again, it is a fact, that although the brain of

440 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
thcse dying insane does very frequently exhibit no
organic change; and that when organic changes
have taken place, it is impossible oftentimes to pre-
dicate the nature of such change, before examina-
tion; so little uniformity has been found between
the symptoms before, and the appearances after
death; yet the common
changes of disease are
much more frequently found in the brain of in-
sane persons, than among those who have not been
afflicted with this malady ; and they probably exist
in many other instances which escape detection,
because we are so little acquainted with the healthy
structure of the ultimate nervous fibre.
It may be said, that the length of time during
which insanity has continued, would have the efiect
of deepening the impression of chronic alteration ;
and it may do so in some instances. But by the
supposition, there are other conditions, incom-
patible with life, but which leave no traces of dis-
organisation ; and these, though slower in their
operation, because less violent in their nature, would
not necessarily produce organic changes in the
longer time required for the production of the final
result, than in the shorter but parallel case of acute
malady ; so that this also is a
question of time, and
affords no
argument against our main position.
And really, the length of time, during which
the symptoms shall have continued without pro-
ducing disorganisation, is rather in favour of, than
against our conclusion ; for had it been any other
than disorder ry" function, its long continuance
would have been marked by such progressive or-

ganic changes as would have resulted in an early
incompatibility with the maintenance of life; and
when to these are added the little knowledge
we
possess of the structure and functions of the
nervous
system, we shall find no
single argument
against our
position.
But once more, so far as we are
acquainted with
it, the habits of the nervous system make against
our
discovering organic changes: for first, its
changes are
always produced in an
exceedingly
slow manner, as we have before observed; and
next, we are quite sure, that in other violent dis-
orders of that system, it is often difficult, often im-
possible to discover the influence of change. It is,
for instance, doubtful whether tetanus or
hydro-
phobia produce any cognisable permanent change
ofstructure: and it is more than doubtful, whether
that which has been thought (Dr. Reid) to produce
these maladies is cause or eifect, even
granting
that it ever existed. In apoplexy, sometimes a
trace of disease is hardly to be found ; and catalepsy
shall have existed during a
long life, and yet no-
thing be discoverable. A patient shall have been
subjected to violent attacks of hysteria, for twenty,
thirty, or
forty years, and not the slightest visible
influence be perceived in any part of the nervous
system. Yet no one doubts the existence of these
diseases, or of their being diseases of that system,
because their effects are not discernible. So that
the argument drawn from this source has no foun-
dation in truth, in fact, in reasoning.
The existence of idiocy, not congenital, but pro-

duced from some
powerfully operating cause, with-
out any traceable difference in the brain, from that
of the healthiest organisation, is only another proof
that function may be intercepted, where the organ
appears healthy; or that we have no means of
judging of what is healthy nervous fibre; and it
would be well if we would rest contented to find,
and not attempt to pass, the limit, which Nature
has everywhere placed to our researches.
There is another fact which is remarkable, es-
pecially as we have noticed that the brain in
it.s°eQ" is not a
very sentient organ ; and that, in all
probability, its investing membranes are more sen-
sitive than itself; viz. that although it is true that
insanity often exists, where there shall be no dis-
discoverable traces of organic change after death,
yet, that, on the contrary, such organic changes
are
scarcely ever found where the manifestations
of mind have not been more or less altered. It is
said, that the contrary has sometimes occurred;
and on the principle above stated, that the brain
is not a
very sentient organ, we believe that it may
have been so; yet this is the exception to the
general rule, and when observed, is remarked, not
as a
thing of course, but of wonder. And could
we see the interior workings of such minds, we
believe that they would be found altered, limited,
perverted, or
changed in some
way from their
normal condition, although it may not be discover-
able in their external manifestations. It should be
recollected, that there are
many oddnesses which
are
dependent upon cerebral conditions, but which

pass for mental peculiarities, and in this way the
disordered actions escape notice. Yet the rule will
be found logically true, that wherever there has
been seen a trace of organic change, there also will
have been disturbed manifestations.
If we look to the phenomena of cerebral disorder
and to the means which are most available for its
cure, we shall find that these, too, bear out our
original proposition. Since the brain is not very
sensitive to pain, or alteration of structure, we
should not expect to notice its early manifestations
of morbid action very prominently, and they often
escape the notice of those most deeply interested.
A little girl, just recovering from an acute
attack of irritation of the brain-that form of ma-
lady which generally terminates in hydrocephalus,
was observed to be very irritable upon the merest
trifles; it was attributed to the very common irri-
tability of convalescence; but as she advanced a
little more towards recovery, a
great silliness of
expression was
perceived about her, not amounting
to, but bordering upon idiocy ; so
slight as to have
escaped the notice of intelligent parents, but which
was
largely perceived, as soon as their attention
had been directed to the subject; and this is pass-
ing oil' as she gains strength. But for a minute
attention to the manifestations of mind, this phe-
nomenon would have escaped detection; and thus
it is, doubtless, with many other forms of cerebral
disorder. Another patient became morbidlyfemful;
she was
always nervous, and this timidity was con-
sidered as an increase of nervousness; till to fear

444 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
became associated the vacillating will, the absurdly
scrupulous judgment, the unreal apprehension of
evil from the commonest circumstances, which
showed to herself and her friends that there was
something essentially wrong about the brain, and
she was then subjected to
proper treatment.
One of the earliest symptoms of cerebral disorder
is the disposition to magnify trzfles; to be inordi-
nately elated, or
depressed by circumstances or
feelings, which in a
well-poised mind should not
produce any considerable movement; the events
of life are not weighed in their proper balance, and
justly appreciated, but obtain an undue prepon-
derance. This generally passes for zeal, or ear-
nestness, or
great feeling, or warm interest in a
given subject; but it is overdone, unnatural, and
really a morbid condition.
A certain degree of congestion in the vessels of
the brain, giving rise to heavy and protracted
slumber, from which the patient arouses with diffi-
culty; a certain amount of congestive headache
in the morning, which renders him languid and
miserable for perhaps the first half' of the day;
occasional giddinesses of a
very transient descrip-
tion, and never
amounting to any serious disturb-
ance of the circulation, are
yet suflicient to show
that that circulation is disturbed ; to mark (as pre-
monitory symptoms to an attack of insanity) the
organ which is suffering; and distinctively to
declare, that the perverted manifestations of mind
are accompanied by alteration in the vascular con-
dition of its organ.

or BODY AND MIND. 445
At another timethe patient suffers from what
is strictly and properly termed nervous headaches;
a state not dependent upon congestion, or increased
action of the vessels, but upon a certain morbid
condition of the nervous fibre itself; sometimes
confined to a small space, and at others apparently
diffused over the whole head, and giving rise to a
great degree of irritability of temper, or restless-
ness of passion; a
wandering after, and frequent
change of pursuit; a
general malaise; a
great
degree of fidgetiness, which makes its subject
thoroughly uncomfortable to himself and others,
and which often mark the approach of another
and more troublesome form of insanity; more
troublesome in proportion as nervous function is
less under our control than that of the circulation.
There a a
very troublesome form of headache,
which is only named in the present situation in
order to distinguish it from the nervous headache
just described; the one
being a
very common
pre-
cursor of insanity, and the other being apparently
unconnected with any such consequence, and
which, for the sake of perspicuity, may be termed
pericranial lzeadac/ze. The symptoms are much
alike; and the latter has seemed to attack literary
and other persons who have overworked the brain,
but in whom there is no
tendency to
insanity.
Pericranial headache may be known from ordinary
nervous headache by its periodicity, generally con-
tinuing thirty-six hours, and subsiding without any
visible cause ; almost always originating after some
extraordinary cerebral exertion; generally bene-

446 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
iited by bodily exercise, unless the wind be very
high; never increased by the various movements
of the head and body; and though very distress-
ing to the patient, does not produce that state of
irritability of the mind and temper which is the
common
companion of nervous headache. It is
very important to distinguish these two forms of
malady, for the sake of the patient, who may re-
quire much watching in the one case, and in the
other need excite no kind of apprehension.
As in the form of congestive headache, heavy
slumber prevails, so in that of nervous headache
there is a
great degree of morbid wakefulness.
Night after night, and week after week, sleep
forsakes the pillow; and although at first the
transient snatches which the patient gainsseem
refreshing, and sufiicient to enable him to pass
through the day, yet this cannot last long; and
the brain always losing, and never
recruiting,
gives way under a series of excitements from
which it obtains no quietude. A great degree of
irritability is the consequence, and perhaps finally
a state of morbid vigilance, which too frequently
ushers in the fully~formed paroxysm of insanity.
Next comes a certain altered condition of the
organs of sense, giving rise in its advanced stage
to various forms of illusion, which haunt the
insane, and characterize their delirations. An
excessive degree of sensibility to impression forms
the first link in this chain; every feeling is ren-
dered too acute, and all the nerves of sense
aug-
ment the impression which they receive, and

magnify them far beyond the truth. And when to
this state of great susceptibility is added the deep-
ening shade of perversion, then has the boundary-
line of reason been passed, and insanity has com-
menced ; then the report of the senses is no
longer
to be relied upon; and the impulsive patient, or
the one who acts from perverted impressions on the
organs of sense, in other words, the one who acts
from momentary feeling, becomes an
object of
deep so licitude.
This being the case, next follows great insta-
bility of pursuit and purpose; the patient has
become the creature of every changing feeling;
he no
longer appeals to motive, judgment, prin-
ciple, to guide his conduct, but acts automatically
from the character of the impression last made
upon the organs of sense, or
originated in the in-
terior man, and reflected outwards to those organs,
in order ultimately to give rise to the consequences
of non-reasoning action.
The manifestations of mind now mark the
change which has taken place in the manifesting
organ. Perhaps, in the Hrst place, an overween-
ing attachment to some favourite study or
pursuit
is remarked; some relative or friend, perchance,
playfully notices this change, or
perhaps seriously
and gently cautions against that becoming evil by
excess, which in itself was
good. The friend_is not
a little startled and chagrined on
finding that his
playful and well-intentioned remark excites a vio-
lent paroxysm ofanger, which it requires some trou-
ble to appease ; and then, and perhaps not till then,

448 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
does he find this emportement so disproportioned to
the cause which produced it, that he becomes
apprehensive, his fears are awakened, and after
watching closely, he discovers various other alter-
ations of character, which had before escaped no-
tice, but which he now recollects to have existed
for some time, producing, however, only a
passing
emotion of wonder and
surprise.
Upon close scrutiny, he detects _many causes for
alarm; he finds that many of the habits, and of
that congeries of phenomena, which in the aggre-
gate we call character, are changed,-changed iit-
fully, without change of circumstances, and without
adequate reason. It is impossible to notice these
changes, which depend not on
any general stand-
ard, but on that individuality of character which
belongs to each, and which are
only detected by a
comparison of the present with other manifestations
of an antecedent date. It will, however, be found
that the cautious have become imprudent; the
precise perfectly careless; the neat very inatten-
tive to his person; the benevolent selfish; the
religious man inattentive to his duties; the do-
mestic man
always from home; the meek tur-
bulent and irascible ; the courageous timid; the
slow reasoner jumping to a conclusion, and as
readily acting upon his results, without reviewing
the steps by which he has gained them; the in-
dustrious has become idle; the serious frivolous;
the
prodigal penurious, and vice versa; he who
has been accustomed to reason, and to estimate
very highly the power of reasoning, now under-

values any consecutive argument, as
altogether
unnecessary for him to whom has been bequeathed
powers not far short of an
almighty intelligence.
This might be multiplied indefinitely; these only
are mentioned to show the changes of character
which are carried out into every conceivable
variety of individuality, and to exemplify the con-
sequences of irritation of the brain. To these may
be added the increasing bizarreries of conduct,
which are all consistent with the patient`s own
belief and reasoning upon it; this belief, and this
reasoning, however, being entirely dependent upon
hallucination.
Ve must just remark at this stage of our in-
quiry, some
bodily disturbances which very gene-
rally accompany the state of irritation of mind
which we have just described. The first and chief
of these is, dyspepsia, or disordered stomach, in
all its ever-changing varieties of shape, and form,
and pressure. This is so
frequently the case, and
from the earliest observations there has been such
a marked connexion between /zypochondriasis (the
very derivation of which points to under the car-
tilages of the ribs for the origin of the evil) and
disordered liver, that it has almost been believed
that every form of insanity has at its commence-
ment been referred to stomach, and treated as such
successfully. None can
deny the good which has
been effected; but we
may differ as to the cause
of improvement, and as to the nature and agency
of the remedies employed.
We believe, then, that all the phenomenal of

disordered stomach in the insane, are not the
cause, but the consequence, of their insanity. In
truth, the brain spends too much nervous energy
over its dominant or exclusive idea, and thus the
stomach and other chylopoietic bowels are
deprived
of their required amount, and then fall into a state
of disorder, the result of which is more or less of
indigestion, and all the usual wretched accompany-
ing symptoms, which, however, be it remembered,
are the result, not the precursors of that cerebral
irritation, which, carried to a certain point, inter-
feres with the regular function of the organ, and
constitutes insanity.
There are various muscular movements of an in-
voluntary character which accompany insanity;
such as frequent cramps and twitchings of various
muscles, without the power of controlling them;
sometimes only during the night, and occurring
in sleep; at others, influencing all the movements
of progression during the day ; all these being the
consequence of that cerebral irritation which is
going on, and overturning not only the finer
faculties ol' mental manifestation, but also all the
other arrangements of the body which depend
upon nervous influence.
But there is oftentimes a
great degree of feeble-
ness of the voluntary muscles, which seems to arise,
not from any deficiency of muscular power, as de-
termined by muscular fibre, but from the defective
volition communicated to that fibre. We are
quite
aware that paralysis is a
very frequent companion
of insanity; but this occurs only in an advanced

stage of the malady, and as a
consequence of some
disorgamlsation of the brain, arising from unwonted
pressure upon some part of its substance, or from
the rupture of some of the nervous fibres them-
selves ; while the present loss of power is produced
merely by feeble will. The patient is generally
slow in determining upon all good purposes, though
often wilfully persevering in bad resolves; -his judg_
ment is always changing; but in respect of his
muscles, he moves them feebly, except under ex-
citement, and he has a certain fear and apprehen-
sion that he cannot move them at all; he thinks
he cannot leave the chair on which he is sitting,
the bed on which he is lying, or the house he
inhabits; whereas the performance of all these
things requires only an act of moderate volition.
The most successful method of treatment of these
cases will be found in obtaining the confidence of
the patient, becoming the depositary of his secrets,
and gradually and judiciously throwing the bright
ray of hope over
futurity; dispelling the gloomy
night of despair, and animating him with some
motive for effort ; inquiring most accurately after
the remote and immediate, the predisposing and
the occasional causes of this malady in the indi-
vidual, and setting to work sincerely to remove or
suspend all these influences. lt is astonishing how
a sudden fearful impression upon the system will
sometimes dissipate this feeble will, as if by a
charm, and induce that decided exercise of volun-
tary movement, as shall convince the patient that
he is capable of such movement, and he stands at

of
all his apprehensions by the power of accidental
impression. We have mentioned an instance of
this kind in a
lady who was thrown from a
pony
carriage, and immediately recovered; and we
have known the same consequence result from an
alarm of fire, or some other similar power.
But we cannot quit this subject without noticing
that form of insanity which is called demonomania,
including under this term all which may be com-
prehended in the idea of "
religious insanity," if,
indeed, these words convey any idea at all. We
have before noticed the necessity for precision in
the use of terms; and this is one of those uses,
which, however sanctified by custom, we cannot
but object to; not simply on the ground that no
form of bodily disorder can admit of the charac-
teristic "religious," which might be termed a
scientific cavil; but because of the positive error
of association, which it produces in the minds of
the ignorant, the unthinking, and the prejudiced;
as if religion really did produce insanity. If any
term of this kind must be used, we would suggest
the employment of pseudo-religious insanity, as at
once designating that it was either a
false impres-
sion of religion which gives rise to the malady ; or
that religion had been falsely accused of producing
it. In the minds of many, it is held as a most
sacred truth that an attention to religion has over-
turned the reason-this in itself being an
qfset
from monomania.

nexion between religion and insanity, as also be-
tween genius and insanity, it is necessary to con-
sider for a moment wherein that connexion consists;
and it will be found that the two are precisely
parallel cases. In the first place, it will be allowed
that there are some brains predisposed, from here-
ditary or
original conformation, to insanity, as well
as others fitted for the developement of genius.
There are some brains peculiarly adapted to the
manifestation of the highest intellectual efforts;
others, to that of the highest moral fruits. And
as
genius is the highest point of intellectual mani-
festation, and religion the perfection of moral
fruit, so, in both instances, the brain is stimulated
to its highest action. But every one knows, that
an organ stimulated to its highest pitch of en-
durance is very likely to be overset, and is placed
in that peculiar position, in which it is especially
susceptible of disorder; and hence arises the ac-
knowledged connexion between genius, religion, in-
sanity.
Now, nobody quarrels with genius because it is
allied to insanity; nobody undervalues it on ac-
count of this alliance ; everybody considers it as a
boon; courts it as a most valuable endowment;
cultivates its most brilliant manifestations, and
cherishes it with the fondest care. Not so
religion;
when insanity occurs under its influence, religion
is blamed; it is undervalued; it is considered as
an evil; it is sought to be repressed; the indi-
vidual is to be rescued from its agency ; and every-
thing which tends to awaken its association is to

be carefully avoided. How is this? W`hence is
this great difference of motive, feeling, conduct?
Is it not an abandonment of reason and judgment;
and a substitution of prejudice, and of alienation
from that which is good, because man's perverse
heart does not love God ?
There are two ways particularly, in which re-
ligion may be said to produce insanity, though we
have already shown, it can only give rise to insanity
in a brain which is waiting for the first powerful
emotion to overturn its integrity; the first its
natural, and the second its perverted influence.
a. Its natural influence. Religion, as
setting be-
fore man the highest hopes and greatest fears;
infinite happiness on the one hand, and indefinite
despair on the other; as involving the highest
moral sanctions, promises of reward to the obedient,
and a
foretelling of future misery to the wilfully
disobedient ; as
requiring the fulfilment of a certain
moral law, which man in his present state is unable
to obey, but for which, if he sincerely seeks it, he
is promised that aid which shall enable him to
walk in the straight path of truth: the conviction
of every honest heart, that he has no claim to the
blessings, but has incurred the penalties denounced ;
and the hopes of present safety held out in the
Gospel; the earnest desire to do right, and the
fearful array of the many occasions on which that
right has been abandoned ; and the now constant
struggle between duty and inclination ; are all in-
fluential impressions. And when an individual,

towards God and his neighbour, it is not sur-
prising that the subject should become an engross-
ing one, nor that, after a time, it should likewise
become exclusive. And now the brain has lost its
integrity, for it has lost the power of directing the
attention from any one
subject, and fixing it upon
any other, according to the will. This exclusive
attention keeps up one set of impressions, under
which the reason is overturned, and insanity is
formed.
b. Its unnatural influence. This is, when an
individual takes up false notions of religion : when
he looks upon God as
implacable; when he con-
siders that his sins are
unpardonable; when he
looks upon the Omnipotent as a God of vengeance,
and not of mercy and love ; when he contemplates
himself as
predestined to misery; and when he
loses himself in the mysteries of election, and the
purposes of God ; in fact, when forgetting the sim-
plicity of truth, he takes up views which he cannot
fathom, nor even
attempt to comprehend; then
it is, that a fallacious, as well as an exclusive im-
pression, and that, too, always of a
depressing
character, is produced; and then it is, that one
of the most fearful forms of insanity is found. In
all these instances, it will be seen, that religion
operates by producing impressions of an exciting,
or
powerfully-depressing nature upon the brain;
and that thus it works in the same
way as the
highest efforts of genius; as the passion of love,

especially when unrequited ; as too much business
to the merchant, particularly when embarrassing;
as ambition to the warrior; as
political trials to
the statesman: there is no difference; one and
the same law exists for all; the brain is morbidly
impressed in all; the impression becomes exclusive;
and the exclusivencss lapses into insanity; and its
delirations are then characterised by the nature of
those impressions.
There exists another error on this subject, among
many excellent persons, who are not deeply versed
in the mental and moral history of man; this is
an idea that insanity is a
possession of the evil one.
It is not our business to inquire, what was the
possession detailed in the Scriptures; our
only
concern is with what it was not; and we
may
certainly say, it was not insanity, because it was
evidently some spiritual and not a
bodily state;
and therefore, as it cannot be doubted that the
essence of insanity consists in cerebral or
bodily
disorder, it cannot be that the two are the same
thing. ,
With these preliminary observations, we now
remark, that "
pseudo-religious insanity
"
may be
subdivided into the hopeful and the desponding.
In the former state, we find the individual full of
his own self-importance, and of some
extraordinary
commission, which is to be accomplished through
his or her instrumentality. One patient will ima-
gine himself to be our Saviour, sent on earth to
fulfil his divine commission; another, that he is a
prophet, and that he is entitled to expect miracu-

lous interposition to support him, and therefore, that
he is not required to take sustenance, for that it
would even be doubting God`s power if he did
take food ; a third is sent as an
apostle to execute
the will of the Most High upon the earth, and
especially to convert mankind, and restore them
to the image of God ; a fourth is in constant com-
munication from the Most High-receives direc-
tions lrom Him, as to all the events of life-hears
voices, and obeys impulses; communicates freely
with angels and good spirits; and is desirous of
executing the behests, and is prepared with a
special revelation of the will of God to man. One
very aged female patient believed herself pregnant,
and in labour with the Son of God. In all these,
to doubt their high commission is the greatest
possible offence; and in every instance it will be
found that they are very proud, and disdainful of
their supposed inferiors : it is desirable not to en-
deavour to dissipate this illusion abruptly; for by
so doing, the chance of obtaining the patient's con-
fidence is lost, and without it there is no
hope of
usefulness.
In the second, or
desponding state, the patient
is without hope, and can receive no comfort; he
is eternally condemned to everlasting punishment ;
he is given over to hardness of heart; the offers of
mercy are not made to him, for his sins are un-
pardonable; the promises of God are not intended
for him: he has forfeited all hope of the Divine
mercy; he is given over to the possession of evil
spirits; he is irrecoverably lost; and in the midst

458 THE nncirnocsn INFLUENCE
of mercy, and goodness, and love, he alone is the
isolated object of the vengeance of the Most High.
Many causes operate in producing this peculiar
state of pseudo-religious insanity; and none more
than false systems of religious belief, taking up
partial views of the truth, and allowing them to
remain with such a constant weight upon the heart,
that they become exclusive ideas, and overturn the
reason. A right and correct view of religion in-
vests its believers with a cheerfulness that ought
to be cultivated, because none can be so
truly
happy as the Christian-none can
possess such
consolations in all the troubles of life-none can
so
securely rest his infirmities, his unwilling in-
firmities on the compassion of a Saviour, who was
tempted in like manner, though incapable of sin-
none can
possess so secure a confidence of forgive-
ness-and none can look forward with such cheerful
expectation to the hopes and joys of the world that
is to come. But if instead of this rational and
scriptural view of the truth, religion shall have
been invested with a
mysticism which makes it
fearful; if its author shall have been represented
as the inexorable Judge-as delighting in the sins
and the punishments of his children, because they
would display His justice, and add to His glory;
still more, if He shall have been represented as
having pre-ordained some of His creatures to ever-
lasting destruction; if it shall have been said that
they have no
power to turn unto God-to seek his
ways, or to obey his commands; and that, unless
they are of the number of the elect--chosen out of

mankind from the foundation of the world-these
receiving the power to believe, which is withheld
from all the rest of the world ; it is clear, that such
a view of religion must fill the bosom of frail man
with despondency, and naturally tend to overset
his best principles, his highest hopes-take him
from the humble aspirant after conformity to the
will of God, and place him in the lowest grade
of abject, lost, ruined, worthless, and despairing
creatures.
The influence of physical temperament over these
states is also very considerable. Where the san-
guine temperament prevails, there also will be
found the prevalence of hope ; and the insane, there-
fore, will be found a most important personage ; he
will be divinely commissioned; and this commis-
sion will keep him up, above all the troubles of
life; will give him an exalted place in his own
imagination, will make him the especial favourite of
Heaven, and will throw a
bright colouring over the
gloomy present, and the darkling future; so that,
even here, all shall be bright. But on the con-
trary, should the patient be of the melancholic
character, he views precisely the same
objects
through exactly opposite media : that which gives
hope to the one, produces despairin the other; that
which incites to action in the one, paralyses the
other; that which consoles and supports the one, is
productive only of fearful anguish, and anticipated
misery to the other; so that from a
knowledge of
the temperament, it may always be predicated,
which is the prevailing form of insanity.

Accidental circumstances will also exert a cousi-
derable influence over the varying forms of insane
manifestation. One person shall have led a
strictly
moral and religious life; another shall have passed
a life of dissipation: one shall have been remark-
able for the quiet exercise of all the cardinal virtues
-in another, it shall have been difficult to find the
trace of any virtue at all; in one, the history of his
path shall have been marked by benevolence-
another shall have been guilty of almost every vice
against society; one shall be an individual of very
limited mental power-another of the highest intel-
lectual grade, and also of every intermediate mental
calibre ; one shall have been ushered into insanity,
by some powerful mental emotion suddenly induced
-another by the slow consuming fire of some hidden
and unexpressed, but abiding feeling; in one the
perversion of insanity shall have been coincident
with acute disease-in another it shall seem'to have
been caused by the slow overturn of the equilibrium
of health, produced by the gradual failure of some
one or other function; in one some sudden acces-
sion of wealth-in another some
equally sudden or
more slow reverse of fortune: all these will have
operated in producing insanity, and will give a dif-
ferent expression of feature to that disordered state.
In all these, however, a
great prevalence will be
found of the depressed forms, because fear is more
powerfully influential, and more
generally prevalent
than hope ; because, there is in this world a
greater, or at least a more marked prevalence of
suffering rather than of pleasure; of doubt, rather

than of certainty; of apprehension, rather than of
cheerful expectation ; of sickness and sorrow, rather
than of health and joy ; of terror and fearful looking
forward, rather than of the self-possession, and con~
fidence of future prospects; in fact, the clouds pre-
vail over the sunshine, and therefore the gloomy
prevails over the more cheerful expression of feel-
lng.
There have been some other modes of supersti-
tion, whicl1 have excited a considerable influence
over the brain, but which, as
they can
scarcely be
said to he now much operative, we shall barely
glance at; such as the different forms of idolatry;
the worship of the heavenly bodies; the belief in
their influence upon the destinies of man, the
remnant of which is to he found still in our own
notions of the influence of the different phases of
the moon
upon supposed lunatics; and the various
forms of folly and credulity, which have exerted so
deep an influence over the integrity of the brain ;
as all the histories of magic, witchcraft, sorcery, the
pretensions of the exorcist, the claims of the me-
tallic tractors, the divining rod, alchemy, the secret
of perpetual motion, the researches of mesmerism,
and, more recently, animal magnetism, hommopathy,
the study of the occult sciences, all the unjust and
limited views that have ever
prevailed among men,
and all the effects of fanaticism in every shape,
have proved, at different times, so
many rocks upon
which the intellect has made shipwreck, and has
been stranded on the tracklcss shores of insanity.

health of the brain, and the just equilibrium of
mental manifestation.
In whatever way insanity may have been pro-
duced, it is early shown by a concentration on self,
an introversion of the thoughts and feelings, which
leads the patient to be forgetful of his social and
relative position ; and this is exhibited, not as
pure
selfishness, which is too often discoverable in the
sane, but as morbid selfishness; as, for instance, the
insane will neglect themselves, and omit all those
attentions to cleanliness, &c., which are so neces-
sary to present comfort, or to the maintenance of'
the comforts of self; they will be absorbed by the
one dominant idea, and in that absorption they will
omit to take food, and all the attentions to clothing
and warmth, which are so
indispensable to health ;
they will neglect and be averse from their nearest
relatives and best friends, though it is from them
they have always derived their comforts, and do
even now receive all the good which they possess,
and all the care bestowed upon them : while seek-
ing their own
pleasure, and probably pursuing
some illusive phantom, they will neglect their own
interests, and be careless of their health, their pro-
perty, and of' all those who have the highest claims
upon tl1em; so that the selfishness of the insane
will often be remarked as an antithesis to natural
seg'-love.
This, perhaps, is still more
distinctly seen in
their tendency to suicide: the love of life is instinc-
tive in the man, and is a
powerfully operative cou-
servative, or selfish principle: but it is entirely

superseded in the insane. In them it will be per-
ceived, that while the feelings are
very deep and
acute, the judgment is feeble, and the mind is quite
carried away by its own erroneous
perceptions;
erroneous, because the percipieut organ is faulty:
there is generally a
deep feeling of wrong, a con-
sciousness of error, a
profound conviction of moral
guilt, though scarcely ever
assuming a
tangible
form, (and even if it do, it is almost always an
unreal and visionary form,) succeeded by an endur-
ing sense of deserving chastisement for their crimes,
and a fearful looking-for of judgment to come, a
complete despair of safety, or of restoration to the
favour of God, and sometimes a belief that they
have sold themselves to, and are under the power
of, the devil. Under this invariable condition of
suffering, they prefer death to the disquietude which
torments them; and death as a
physical evil, and
the pain which it must occasion, is thought of as
nothing, when compared with the moral suffering
which they endure from the hell of their own
bosoms. Hence the frequency of suicide, affording
by the way another proof, that it is not natural
but morbid selfishness, which is- to be found in the
maniac; natural selfishness would tend to the
preservation of life: nothing short of a morbid
state would induce a
person to prefer a condition
of ultimate and remediless woe, according to his
own
position, to one in which there was a bare
possibility of improvement; or to add to the pre-
sent accumulation of evils, however great, yet this
one other-the extinction of physical lite; or, in

other words, to leap at once into that gulf of
torment, the bare apprehension of which has been
suflicient to make life miserable.
Yet this tendency exists fearfully: none can
doubt this; and none can doubt its being the
highest act of insanity. We mean not to say, that
every act of suicide results from insanity ; we be-
lieve the contrary, and that very many such cases
are the immediate consequence of present disap-
pointment and sorrows, accompanied by a reckless-
ness of futurity ; a desire to get rid of present suf-
fering, and a want of belief in, or consideration of,
the future attendant miseries; the influence of pas-
sion, and the forgetfulness of principle; feeling
being strong, and judgment weak ; the present im-
pression being great, and the resulting inclination
to destroy life being powerful, while the voice of
religion is stifled, conscience and its monitions are
not at hand; the soft whisper of truth, the "
this
informs mel shall never die," is inaudible; and
the act is committed in a state of moody discontent
with the present, and of desponding isolation from
the future world.
But there are
many cases of suicide among the
insane; and the tendency to self-destruction, as a
feature of that inalady, is fearfully great. One of the
great characteristics of this state, is the awfully little
impression upon the morale, that can be made
by the ministers of religion, or by friends. Moral
means and motives should never be forgotten ; but
they will be found unavailing: the patient listens
indeed, perhaps is convinced ; and ten minutes

afterwards, the impression comes upon him; and
the apparently convinced maniac is a
corpse by his
own hands. It is not our
purpose to pursue this
subject further, than to show the dependence of
insanity upon irritation of the brain ; and the
comparatively little use of moral means, unless they
can alter that state of irritation of the nervous fibre.

CHAPTER VII.
ON THE INFLUENCE OF MIND OVER THE BODILY
FUNCTIONS.
BEFORE we enter upon the more important sub-
ject of the influence ofthe body upon the manifes-
tations of mind, it will be desirable to spend a few
words upon that reflex influence which is exerted
by mind upon body.
Every one is conscious of such influence, so far
as regards the voluntary muscles: it is in the
power of the will to employ, or to preserve at rest,
certain muscles according to the object to be accom-
plished; every body is conscious of the power to
accommodate such muscular movements, so as to
make them commensurate with the designs of the
will, whether these movements be small and rapid,
as in writing, speaking, and various other similar
functions; or _
whether they shall be large and less
frequently repeated, as in walking, running, leap-
ing, lifting heavy weights, &c. But persons in
general are not aware how much the energy of the

muscles may be increased, and how much more
than ordinary they will be able to accomplish,
under certain states of mental excitement,-parti-
cularly under the influence of motives to seltlde-
fence, or
self-preservation. It is thus, that the de-
licate female will perform feats of muscular power,
which she would have thought impossible, and
which would have been impossible under ordinary
circumstances, but which become possible with the
aid of mental iniiuence. The same thing will be
perhaps still more
strongly shown in the efforts
which will he made to save her child from danger,
for in the female bosom, the love of progeny greatly
exceeds' the love of life; and, therefore, it is here
that the greatest efforts of self-devotion will he
found, in order to protect her infant from harm.
The same law is traceable in man, though not so
strongly shadowed out, because his muscular power
is naturally greater, and his mental emotions are
not of so
powerful a character: they are of a dif-
ferent order; they will sustain him longer; they
will enable him to exercise more fortitude, to endure
protracted sufferings, to submit to torture, without
the movement of a muscle: and generally to sustain
muscular action far longer; this, again, aifording
another cumulative proof of the body being under
the agency of the mental constitution.
A very common form in which this agency is
discerned, is in the varied expressions ofthe counte-
nance underdiiferentmental emotions; the muscular
movements produced in laughing and sighing; and
the influence upon secretion, as in the flow oftears,

8zc. Practical physiognomy depends upon this
law: Nature has given to the human countenance
a
large number of muscles, for the purpose of ex-
pressing certain feelings, sentiments, emotions,
passions; and according to the frequency or
pre-
dominance of these mental states, will be the
developement of the muscles appointed for such
purposes, agreeably to another law of nature,
which increases muscular fibre in proportion to its
employment; so that, accordingly as one or other
set of feelings, agencies, motives, shall prevail, so
shall the countenance acquire that peculiarity of
expression, which will be pleasing or the contrary ;
will win its way to the heart, or will close the
avenues to friendship; will betray the benevolent
or the selfish character; and in general will ex-
pound the characteristic properties of the indi-
vidual.
So also the emotion of joy will produce the
smile of peace; a keen sense of the ridiculous will
occasion laughter; ennui will give rise to the irre-
sistible yawn: fortitude will occasion a fixed state
of the muscles of the face, teeth closed, and
clenched hands, with the determination not to
give utterance to the sense of suffering; grief
heaves the involuntary sigh, and at the same time
acting upon the glandular system, the big tear-
drop rolls down the cheek of the heart-broken;
the secretion of saliva is arrested-the mouth be-
comes
dry-appetite is gone-digestion is impos-
sible-all the nutritive functions are
suppressed;

of the nutritive system is shown in the wasted and
attenuated form of its unhappy victim.
The influence of mind upon body is further
shown in the faculty of imitation. This is re-
markably exempliiied in the acquisition of lan-
guage; an
image of the thing is formed in the
brain, perceived by the mind, and associated with
certain sounds which have been employed to repre-
sent such image; and the message being commu-
nicated through the nerves to the organs of speech,
certain movements of muscle, &c. take place, by
the aid of the faculty of imitation, which form the
required articulate sounds.
The danger arising from this faculty of involun-
tarily imitating others, so as to contract their
"
gaucheries," their awkward habits, their little
frailties and infirmities, must have been felt by
every person who has at all attended to himselfl
One cannot be long in the society of an individual
who stammers, without feeling a
tendency towards
a similar infirmity, as well as towards an erroneous
pronunciation, or
any other little foible, such as
the method of walking or
talking, &c.
The moral influence, as it is termed, of com-
panionship is very great, and is acknowledged by
all ; so that all are cautious of the society in which
they place their children, and all are desirous of
preserving them from the contamination of evil de-
sires, and vicious propensities, and immoral prac-
tices, because of the danger of imitation.
This is still further shown in the manifestation
of disorder; there are
very many disturbances of

the health which are
produced by this sinister
influence of the mind upon the body, and of the
faculty of imitation arising therefrom; so that it
is very important to remove an
epileptic or hyste-
rical patient from the sight of others; or in those
who are
pre-disposed to these affections, epilepsy
and hysteria will be sure to follow.
There is a state produced by this influence,
which I have noticed several times, by which I was
at first deceived, and which will be best shown by
the following history, the _first in which this con-
dition came to be understood. I had been at-
tending a
very dear medical friend, who was se-
riously, but I hoped, not dangerously ill. An
express was sent, begging my earliest attendance,
and on
my arrival I found there Dr. ---, a
mutual friend. Our invalid friend had awakened
from a short slumber, with a sense of sinking, and
under an
impression that he was
dying; he had
made his last testamentary disposition; he had
taken leave of his family; and he accosted me
by
saying that he was
dying. Dr. F-- and myself
both thought differently, though both were aware
that this impression of mind upon body-this belief
of impending death might occasion positive, Enal,
irretrievable death. We stated our
opinion to our
disbelieving patient; and the case remained an
anxious one for some
days, from the continuance
of the same mental impression, and from the sleep-

or BODY AND MIND. 4-71
he remained nervous for a
long time, and required
change of air and scene ; and alt/wugh the influence
of the mind upon the body remained conspicuous
and interfered with his progress. The same cir-
cumstances have presented themselves to me, se-
veral times since, and with always a similar result ;
and this phenomenon has now so
frequently re-
curred, that it is invariably placed to the account
of the influence of mind upon body.
The same law is exemplified in the production
of disease ; witness the sudden disturbance of func-
tion brought on
by intense feeling or
passion-
giving rise to fainting on the one hand, and to
apoplexy on the other; witness, the slowly-con-
suming agency of some
deep and hidden feeling-
some
feeling which sinks into the heart, and preys
upon the citadel of life, which pales the cheek,
blanches the lip, saps the energy, sinks the eye,
quickens the circulation and the breathing, ex-
hausts the strength, and consigns to an
early tomb
the victim of hopeless, undiscovered passion. Wit-
ness, again, the influence of misfortune, as in the
following narrative occurring within the author's
own circle. Three brothers entered into some most
successful speculations, and realized very large
profits; but they continued the speculation; one
bargain more ! And now the tide had turned; the
article they had bought had been carried up by
speculation to an unnatural height, and they could
no
longer sell, except at a loss; they still hoped
for a favourable re-action, but depression was the
order of the day; to save their credit they must

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
sell; they could only do so at a ruinous sacrifice;
they could not meet their responsibilities; they
stopped payment; next morning one had died by
his own hands; another was seized by apoplexy,
and lived only a few hours; the third died in a
few months from ulceration of the stomach. Here
we see
beautilhlly, though painfully, exhibited, the
influence of mind upon body, according to the
several peculiarities of that body; the first pro-
ducing insanity, for we will charitably hope, that
the suicide was the act of a maniac, and insanity
had been rife in his family; the second, in over-
turning the integrity of the vascular system of the
brain; the third in producing organic disease of
the stomach.
And this very naturally brings us to mention
the influence of mind upon the digestive organs.
lt is very marked even in a state of health; joy
or sorrow will suspend and supersede hunger; every
powerful emotion after a considerable meal will
upset digestion, and interfere with nutrition; and
these impressions frequently repeated will convert
functional disorder into organic disease; some one
of the digestive organs, (whichever happens to be
possessed of the weakest power of vitality,) gives
way, and becomes the seat of structural change,
more or-less incompatible with health, or even with
life. We have not noticed affections of the heart ;
but its diseases are
always found to be more pre-
valent in troublous times; in fact, accordingly as
it shall have been called upon for more or less

of extraordinary excitement. Everybody knows
what is understood by a broken heart; and death
produced by mental agency upon this viscus is not
uncommon.
In conducting this inquiry, we cannot pass over
the agency of mind in the cure, as well as in the
production of disease, and especially in those cases
which have been deemed miraculous. It is an old-
fashioned remark, that " est tout." Now al-
though we
by no means admit this position, yet
we apprehend that there will he found none so
hardy as to afiirm, that faith has not a considerable
influence in the removal of disorder. Even those
who will be disposed to deny the proposition in
theory, will admit it in fact, or when put in ano-
ther shape; as, for instance, none will deny that
the confidence of a
patient in his medical attend-
ant materially aids his recovery, and that the
absence of this confidence makes against him; and
further still, that the agency of medicine is assisted
or retarded by the presence or absence of this con-
fidence. And what is this con{idence but a belief
in the power of the physician, and of his means
to alleviate and remove the existing suffering;
and what is this belief but faith? The fact is
notorious; and to secure this confidence, the phy-
sician has often to medicine the mind-to humour
its prejudices-to meet and dismiss them by a side
wind, rather than by open opposition; and in
various ways to recollect, that his best-directed
prescriptions will fail of producing their intended

influence, unless he can enlist into his views the
beneficial agency of the patient's mind over his
body.
And this brings us to the question of miraculous
cure; and of those cures so said to be effected in
these latter days. No Christian will doubt the
reality of these cures as
performed by our Lord,
and his apostles. None can doubt that our Om-
uipotent Lord had power to cure diseases at his
word, or at his will; and that this power was con-
tinued to his immediate successors,-a body of
men raised up for an
especial purpose as witnesses
of' the truth of Christ's mission, of His death, of His
resurrection. None, moreover, can doubt the prin-
ciple upon which these cures were effected ; or that
faith was
necessary to their completion; "thy
faith hath saved thee ;"
"
thy faith hath made thee
whole ;"
"
seeing he had faith to be healed ;"
"
I
have not found so
great faith, no not in Israel ;"
"
Dost thou believe in the Son of God ?" "
The
father believed those things which were spoken by
Christ." Therefore, it is not a
question with us
as to the miracles of our Lord, or as to the agency
of mind upon body, in producing these effects
under Christ`s command ; these are truths of sacred
and inspired history-the objects of our belief-
and the promoters of our sure trust and confidence
in the Most High.
But our attention is to be directed to those
modern miracles, or rather pretended miracles of
later days. And in doing this, we would first
of all make a distinction between results which

have accrucd from the influence of fanatical cre-
dulity, and those which may have arisen from the
enthusiastic agency of a true faith. In the former
instance, we shall trace the covert wiles of a de-
signing hypocrisy-the barefaced impudence of
mendacious imposture; or, at least, the clouds and
darkness of the grossest ignorance: in the latter
we find a warm heart, without a
very expanded
intelligence, carried away by the excess of its 'own
right feelings ;. and led into extravagancies, which
the more
deeply thinking must deplore, because
of their certain and inevitable recoil upon principles,
which, in common, all Christians hold most dear,
and for the maintenance of which we would ear-
nestly contend. lt is always painful to interfere
with such hallowed emotions; but if it shall be
shown that these agencies, however apparently
dissimilar in their origin, dc, in fact, produce si-
milar efects, by acting upon an identical part of
our compounded nature; and that their ultimate
results are more conducive to the progress of error
than of truth; it may well be questioned, how far
the indulgence of such feelings and emotions may
be praiseworthg-how far they may be innocuous
to the parties so
indulged -how far they may not
be irgurious to the glory ff God, and the eventual
good of man!
The example of Prince Hohenlohe, the most
successful of all modern performers of miraculous
operations, may be quoted as a fair exposition of
the former condition ; while that of some supposed
miraculous cures in our own

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
since, and of which we shall again have occasion
to speak, may be considered as a favourable spe-
cimen of the latter. Both parties equally maintain,
though with somewhat different arguments, that
the power of working miracles still exists, as in the
days of the apostles, provided that the party work-
ing the miracle, and those on whom it is worked,
do really possess a
sufiiciency of faith, a full and
entire confidence in Christ Jesus, and in his Al-
mighty power, with a firm reliance that He will
exercise that power, through THEIR
believing agen-
cies.
It would not do for us to follow the history of
this seemingly disinterested, and successful ope-
rator, or to contrast it with less questionable
modern evidence. It should appear, that in the
early cases, which gave rise to his reputation, the
cure had already been effected by the slow and
combined operation of time, and rest, and reme-
dies,-and that there was wanting only a
powerful
stimulus to the function of volition, to give the
required increased energy to the muscles; and
then with a.
knowledge of the influence of mind
upon matter, and with a
patient of lively imagina-
tion, and highly-wrought sensibility, it was not
difiicult to calculate the probable result; a result
which was
proclaimed as miraculous, because not
produced by ordinary means; and which served
at once to stamp the cure with a sacredness, which
made it more than questionable whether it would
be prudent to hesitate, or hint a doubt as to the
method of its accomplishment.

The enthusiasm arising from these results, how-
ever, gradually faded; and a
reputation, which,
in fact, had only rested upon the great power
exerted by the brain and nervous system, (as the
exponents of mental influence) upon all the other
vital functions, when that influence had been car-
ried up to its highest pitch of tension by favouring
circumstances, was
gradually outlived. So long as
these plans were carried on in public, in the midst
of an enthusiastic and ignorant circle-so long,
success, at least temporary success, was the result,
and miraculous agency the alleged cause, But
when these experiments came to be repeated, be-
fore well-informed and competent judges, the result
was either altogether unsuccessful, or it was no-
thing more than could at any time be produced
by any intelligent person, knowing how to give
a
proper direction to, and proportionably to excite,
an
already highly-excited brain and nervous
system.
Still as we have adduced the present as an ex-
ample of the influence of mind upon matter, and
as we have referred these pseudo-miraculous cures
to the physical laws of our
incorporated nature;
and as there is abundant evidence, that through
the supposed eflicacy of a
holy name, the deaf
heard, the blind saw, and the paralytic was re-
stored to the use of his limbs, it becomes necessary
to inquire a little into the circumstances, in order
that we
may judge of the truth: and especially
is it necessary, to recollect that the influence of
novelty gives a charm to circumstances and nar-

rations, which prompts mankind to believe and to
admire them, because they are new, without sufli-
ciently investigating their title to credibility and
COMPLI-:TENEss; and entirely forgetting, that in
order to establish truth, and to distinguish genuine
from pretended miracles, it is indispensable in all
questions of deviation from the established laws of
nature, that the facts should be authentic-that
they should be related by persons capable of judging
of the circumstances under which they occurred,
and sufficiently impartial to detail them without
gloss or
exaggeration-equally and most carefully
avoiding the ebullition of popular feeling, which
always bears to the side of the marvellous, and the
frigid scepticism of those who will admit and bc-
lieve nothing which does not possess the demonstra-
tion of the exact sciences.
Let us
judge how far the mind was
wrought
upon by Prince Hohenlohe in the performance of
his cures. It appears from the published docu-
cuments that there was no
hope of success, unless
the patient possessed a full and unshaken confidence
in GOD, and a belief, not only that He could, but
that He would, succour those, who in sincerity
sought the relief to be afforded through His ser-
vant, the operator. Having ascertained this from
the patient, the Prince besought God graciously to
remove the disease of the individual, and restore
his lost health, both for the immediate good of the
patient, the support and comfort of His church,
and the glory of His great Name, pleading for an
answer to this prayer, on the ground of the promise

of our Lord Jesus Christ-" Whatsoever ye shall
ask of the Father in my name, He will give it
you ;" on the ground of the faith of the sick indi-
vidual; and, finally, for the honour of His great
name. After a solemn benediction, the patient
was asked, if he felt himself relieved, and, having
given an affirmative reply, he was commanded in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to arise and
walk without assistance. At the least appearance
of fear, hesitation, or
anxiety, the patient was
exhorted to a firm and unlimited confidence in
God-to take courage, and to gain a
victory over
himself, since Divine grace had assuredly placed him
in a situation to employ his limbs, if he would use
on his part the required exertion. And then, if
the event did not correspond with the prediction,
he encouraged the patient for futurity-saying,
that it often happened, that the sick were not
worthy of this grace at the moment, and that their
healing at that time would not ultimately be be-
neficial to their soul's health ; but that they might,
by fasting, by prayer, and penance, and continued
progress in good works, so
prepare themselves for
future acceptance with God, that He would then
grant their prayer.
Here is, indeed, abundantly shown the influence
of a false religion, which is peculiarly a
religion
of feeling; but leaving this consideration, it is not
easy to divine a
process better calculated to exalt
the sensibility of the nervous
system, to excite the
brain to its utmost activity, and to create such a
degree of energy of volition, as to give to this

faculty that astonishing power, which, as we have
already seen, could carry the patient out of, and
beyond himself; and thus effect a
permanent cure,
in those who were
suffering only from a debility
of this function; while it would for a time suspend
the laws of morbid action, even in some cases of
permanent disease; and these would recur, when
the excitement was
past, as was, in fact, the case in
numberless instances.
The performance of these miracles attracted the
attendance of many who came to be healed, and of
many others, who came from curiosity, to witness
the exhibition of this extraordinary power, ren-
dered still more
extraordinary by the fact, that the
acts of healing were
entirely gratuitous, and pro-
duced no ostensible benefit to the "
healer." Pub-
licity was
apparently courted by the Prince; publi
places were often chosen for the performance of
miracles; and in the process, there was no effort
at concealment, no secret arts, no
mysteries, no
particular manifestations; everything wore the
appearance of the genuine simplicity of one who
believed himself gifted of God to heal the sick;
all of which shows an intimate acquaintance with
human nature, and a
consequent power to avail
himself of those physical laws, the influence of
which he had found to be so
predominant, as
very
generally to produce, and almost to ensure these
surprising results; and so much warmth, and zeal,
and energy, did he appear to throw into his pro-
ceedings, that the general enthusiasm augmented
at every word, and that the assembled multitudes

united most earnestly their own
prayers, and wishes,
and hopes for the recovery of the sick, and for the
health of the soul of the performer.
It must be remarked, that the class of diseases
upon which these wonders were wrought, were
generally those which depended upon some loss
of energy of the nervous or muscular systems ; and
occasionally, the sphere of these curative essays
was extended to apparently organic affections.
But any well-informed medical person knows, that
these affections are often only apparent, and depend
really upon a certain morbid condition of the nerves
which supply the organ ; and that this state is not
only remediable, but that it often is removed by
means which act upon the nervous
system; by
those which distract the attention from old morbid
sociations, and substitute new ones; and some-
mes without any means at all, by the mere
agency
of time, and the gradual fading into forgetfulness
of the original morbid impression. These experi-
ments were never made upon a deaf and dumb
person-upon a case of blindness, produced by
disorganisation of the eye-upon spinal deformity
which had resulted from the destruction of the
bodies of the vertebrae-upon the loss of a limb-
or
upon a
disorganised joint. In fact, the de-
partment of cure was limited to that class of chronic
diseases which depends for its characteristic inten-
sity upon a
peculiar laxity of the nervous fibre; a
fact of primary importance, since it shows the
influence of mind upon the bodily functions and
structure in the cure of disease.

482 'rms RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
Our space does not admit of very full details as
to the history of these cures; one general issue
may, however, be stated,-that the patients being
previously wrought up to the highest pitch of
expectation, they were filled by the enthusiasm of
devotional feeling; their bosoms heaved with the
liveliest emotions; they were called out of them-
selves, and in some instances they actually felt,
and in others thought they felt, their pains diminish,
and gradually disappear. There is then a great
similarity between this influence and that of animal
magnetism, and some other curative plans, which
have rested their entire value upon the influence
of mind over the body ; an influence which is most
extraordinary_is deeply and extensively operative,
-and yet baflles all our edorts to ascertain the
mode of its action. In every instance of this kind
there is one master principle, viz. the agitating
influence of the belief of' some unknown and super-
natural agency--producing a
predominant impres-
sion upon the nervous
system, and through it,
upon all the associations of mind, and all the
varied functions of body,-that is, upon all the func-
tions which depend for their continuance upon the
integrity of the cerebral and spinal nervous
systems.
It is certain, that in the instances referred to, a
very considerable effect was
wrought upon many
individuals; but it is also true, that this was
greatly
exaggerated by the ultra-zeal of warm friends, by
an excited imagination, and by a dislike on the
part of the sick to acknowledge that they had not
faith to be healed. ln general, the effect was

liative only, diminishing pain, or relieving it for a
time, to return after a longer or shorter interval,
when the influence of the excitement had subsided :
and it was curative in those happy instances, in
which nature, or antecedent treatment, had already
effected a cure; and an
adequate degree of excite-
ment alone, was
required to give pristine energy to
the restored but weakened organs: or when the
malady had fixed its grasp upon the nervous
system, and only some new and powerful impres-
sion was
necessary to supersede its morbid habit.
In estimating the influence of mimi upon the cure
of disease, it is necessary to keep in view the dis-
tinction, between that which is curative, and that
which is merely palliative; the _former puts an end
to disease, and restores the patient to perfect health;
but the latter (where organic changes have taken
place to such an extent, that they can no
longer be
overtaken by treatment) consists in allaying irrita-
tion, diminishing pain, enfeebling sympathetic
phenomena, taking care of the general health, at-
tending 'to the functional derangement of other
organs; arresting, as Par as
possible, the organic
changes which are
going on in the part primarily
affected, and thereby diminishing the danger to the
general system, which is almost always destroyed,
by the giving way of some one
organ in the first
place.
Another very important distinction is, between
being really ill, and feeling ill. Many persons are
extremely ill without feeling so, to an extent which
renders it diflicult to awaken the necessary atten-

tion to themselves; and, on the contrary, many
others, without disease, experience such miserable
sensations, that they believe themselves ill, and
seek a
remedy, which will enable them to escape
from their own
feelings. It is this state, which too
frequently drives the miserable patient to the em-
ployment of alcoholic or
opiate stimuli; or turns
him over to the tender mercies of some
impudent
pretender; especially if the usual medical attend-
ant, under whose care and management he first
falls, does not happen to possesshis full confidence,
or does not know how to preserve it, or is not
himself well versed in the mutations of the nervous
system.
i
The limit to this curative influence of mind upon
matter, is, that it can effect no
permanent cure
of
any organic structural alteration; and this it is
which forms the essential difference between the
pseudo-miracles of the latter days, which are effected
through natural, though ill-understood agencies;-
and the miracles of' our Lord and his apostles, which
were direct, immediate, perfect,-without natural
or adequate means, and to which disease of struc-
ture was no impediment to the cure.
The agency of the mind upon the body is pro-
duced and kept up through the influence of the
nervous system, a medium of communication, every-
where distributed with the minutest care, and in
the richest profusion; possessing its grand centre
in the head, while its various parts and subordinate
systems are so
closely, so carefully, and so exten-
sively connected with each other, as to indicate

most clearly the perfection of Divine Wisdom, dis-
played in preserving its uninterrupted and harmo-
nious intercourse, and in securing the most general
impression; not the minutest sensation occurs at
the extremity of the system, but itis instantaneously
propagated to its centre; not a desire is excited in
the mind, but a
corresponding action is set up in
the organ destined for its gratification; and the
endless variety of communication with its several
regions, by means of plexus, ganglia, interlacing,
and decussation of fibres, separate twigs of' inter-
course, and the one
agency of the great sympathetic
nerve, is _such as to overwhelm the mind with asto-
nishment. In some
particular forms of' malady,
this intimate union and communication may be
suspended; yet it can never altogether cease, but
with life ; while in a
great number of diseases, there
appears to be such an excitation of the nervous
system, as to give to the influence of' mind upon
body a
greater power than it would obtain in a
perfectly healthy condition ; and these are
precisely
the states of disorder most favourable for the
pseudo-miraculous cures, viz. those which originally
result from, or are kept up by, disorder of the nervous
function.
Without this influence upon the mental system,
the physician will in vain employ all the resources
ot' his art ;° he will be stinted to one class of' curative
measures, important, certainly, but less important
than the influence of the medical practitioner upon
the mind, and his knowledge of the mental and
moral manifestations of the sic/r, and of thc best'

method of deriving advantage from these condi-
tions. Admitting this to be case, in the greater
number of instances, the cure of disease may be
well said to be dependent upon miraculous agency,
if the essential character of such agency were de-
fined to consist in everything which exists beyond
the ordinary bounds of human intelligence ; which it
is beyond our
power to explain ; and which exceeds
the limits of perception through the medium of the
senses. Thus it is frequently said, that events take
place, as
by a
special act of the sovereignty of God,
without the intervention of adequate apparent
means. But if we knew all the circumstances of
these supposed preternatural events, we should
find that it was our
ignorance which induced us to
imagine the especial interference with nature's esta-
blished laws; and which threw the semblance of
mystery over events, which would be explicable, did
we
possess more knowledge, and a more intimate
acquaintance with the laws, which God himself has
established in his creating power and providential
goodness.
This review of the influence of the mind upon
the body, will lead us to the following conclu-
sions :--
a. The more we become acquainted with the
phenomena of the nervous
system, the more do we
find to wonder and admire in the secret me-
chanism by which these movements are accom-
plished.
b. Disorders of the nervous
system, and espe-
cially those which are occasioned by any disturb-

ance in the function of volition, are peculiarly those
which will be found removable by the influence of
mental excitement, or
by means of powerful impres-
sions, acting vehemently upon the brain or nervous
s
ystem.
c. These impressions may be bodily as well as
mental; but it is the latter which are most powerful
in their influence, particularly if they involve the
more
deeply operative passions of our nature.
d. In organic structural diseases of the system,
nervous excitement will only accelerate a fatal ter-
mlnation.
e. That form of malady which involves the idea
of apparitions, has been clearly traced back to the
effects of disordered nervous function.
`
_fi The exercise of charity in judging of disordered
mental manifestation is indispensable. In contem-
plating the extent of structural disease, and disor-
ganisation of the brain, which is often rendered
cognisable after the patient's death, and which has
scarcely been suspected during life, one
deeply
painful sentiment presents itself to the feeling mind,
viz. that of having judged harshly during life, and
of having attributed to moral obliquity that which
really arose from physical infirmity. It is often
under these circumstance, that we attribute irascibi-
lity, and too great sensibility upon trifles, to the
want of a
duly-regulated mind, when they are
actually dependent upon an irritated brain: in-
dolence and inactivity are
imputed to the absence
of sufficient motives to produce action, when they
arise from sensorial torpor, from the physical want of

488 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
power to set in action those motives; and the
negation of proper diligence and exertion in the
right way, is ascribed to the want of a keen sense
of moral duty, whereas all these may arise from
a feebleness of the function of volition, that again
being dependent upon an enfeebled, or oppressed
brain.
g. These conclusions may be followed out in a
variety of details, but it is unnecessary. It is,
however, very important, while stating these facts,
to guard them against misapplication. .Every dis-
ordered mental manifestation is not attributable to
diseased brain; and it must never be forgotten, that
each individual is minutely responsible for all his
mental manifestations, so
long as he is in a state of
cerebral health; it is for each individual to judge
of himself severely, to scrutinize very narrowly his
motives and conduct, and the secret springs of all
his actions and emotions ; but it is for every Chris-
tian to judge of others with an
enlarged and ex-
pansive charity.
h. While, then, we are careful to avoid falling
into a notion of the omnipotence of bodily structure,
o1° of disordered cerebral function, in their agency
upon the manifestations of mind, and especially
upon human motives, let us be guided by the chaste
light of christian charity, in our
application of
these motives. None sees the heart, but God only ;
and may we be desirous of leaving the judgment
in his hands, who knoweth the end from tl1e be-
ginning l

persons, by moralists, and divines, and by the
public generally, which bears considerably on this
influence of the mind over the body, viz. the con-
duct which ought to be pursued towards the sick,
in acquainting them with, or withholding from
them, the knowledge of their danger. And as
this inquiry is not without its difliculties, and is
altogether an important one, both to the sick them-
selves and to their surrounding friends, we shall
venture upon considering it a little in detail.
It is the first duty of the physician to save life,
and to sustain health, and to employ all the re-
sources of his art to lengthen the duration of existence,
and to preserve itfrom all dangers which threaten its
continuance. It is to be supposed, that we are now
dealing with a christian physician, who believes
in a
superintending Providence, who thankfully
owns, that all his talents are derived from the
Author and Giver of all good, and who feels himself
deeply responsible for the employment of those
talents, as the means which God has vouchsafed for
the accomplishment of His designs. Such an one
feels, that while events are not in his hands, and
that he has no
power to command success-but that,
on the contrary, the issue is in the will of the Om-
nipotent; yet, that as he is not acquainted with
that will, it is his duty to act in conformity with its
general principles, so far as he is acquainted with
them. Now, one of the general principles is, the
preservation of life; and therefore he is doing
God`s will, in endeavouring to efiect this object by
all laajfal mea/as . And he is miuutcly responsible,

as much for his errors of omission, as of commis-
sion, provided they be wilful; or shall have arisen
from indolence, or carelessness, or
anything short
of his having done his very best, to arrest the
ravages of disorder and to restore health. In doing
this, he employs means to an end according to the
best of his knowledge ; and he often speaks of, and
thinks of those means as
adequate to produce cer-
tain results. It is not that he forgets God, or that
he loses sight of Hrs power to save life, and to kill ;
or believes that means will be useful, unless they
be so rendered by the blessing of God: he knows
and feels all this ; but in default of his knowledge
of the will of Heaven, in the particular case, he
employs fearlessly the means he possesses of ac-
complishing, what he does know of the will of God;
and in so doing, he employs these means, as if they
were capable of producing their intended results,
exactly in the same
way, as man
every day takes
food, with the full and certain confidence, that
it will nourish his body, though at the same time,
it will only do so, God will.
Much more than enough has been said about this
conduct of medical persons, with regard to means.
We admit, that he is culpable, who, in his employ-
ment of means, forgets the hand which gives them
power: but we insist, that he is not less culpable,
who employs themfeebly, because uncertain whether
he is doing the will of Heaven ; and who, from the
inertness of his practice, suffers his patient to die,
because he will not be a little more energetic, a
little more confiding in the application of his re-

By the proposition, therefore, he who
cannot be acquainted with the certain result of any
case, however much he mayforcbode evil, is guilty,
if, by lack of zeal and energy in the use of all his
means, he puts his patient into a
position, in which
his forebodings will be probably realized ; and who
destroys or
impairs that cheerful confidence in
himself, from his patient, which we have seen to be
almost indispensable to the successful agency of
remedies. Moreover it follows, that the physician
has not completed his duty, when he has merely
prescribed for his patient, if he has forgotten his
compound nature, and has omitted to prescribe
medicine for his mind ; perhaps has even left that
mind to prey upon the body, and to defeat his best
intended efforts for the preservation of life. The
darkness of ignorance may rest upon it; the clouds
of error
may obscure its perceptions ; the storms of
unsubdued passion may sweep across its surface;
the recollections of the past may be embittered by
many an unrepented sin ; the prospects of futurity
may be undefined from being buried in habitual
forgetfulness; or the night of despondency may
brood her sable wing over the sick man's pillow;
and each one of these states may be more than a
counterpoise to the influence of medicine. It is
for the skilful and christian physician to penetrate
this cloud, to lift, without drawing aside, the veil
which conceals these states from public view; and
gently to lead the mind to such considerations as
shall give it peace-well-founded peace,-as every
one knows,--the state of all others, which will

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
carry a
patient through the largest amount of dis-
order, and yet carry him safely through. Now in
this process he has no
right, nor even an excuse for
deceiving the patient, as to the probable issue of
his malady; he has no
right, nor even an excuse
for stating simply the terrors of religion :-in an-
nouncing the former probability, he should exercise
a sound discretion ; he should cling to the side of
hope rather than of fear; should avow, that he
himself knows nothing of despondency, that he is
energised to action by dilliculties, and acts with
more vigour and determined perseverance, in pro-
portion to those difficulties; but that in all cases, it
is the will of God, not our will, which determines
results; we cannot command success, but we
may
and will deserve it. With regard to the moral and
religious state, an observation from a medical friend,
falls with much greater force, than from a
clergy-
man, and therefore should be guarded; it should
be scriptural, and if scriptural, it abounds in hope
and cheerful promise ; it speaks of a God of mercy
and love, of one who is waiting to forgive-who is
waiting to be reconciled to the sincere suppliant,
who delighteth not to punish, wl1o wills and invites
all to come unto him, and to be saved from their
sins, and relieved from their sorrows.
There are those who would consider this process
as temporising. We do not admit the term. But
granting that it were true, is it nothing to gain
time under such circumstances P Is not time every-
thing where moments are of such infinite import-
ance? ls it nothing to gain time for the unfor-

tunate suicidal maniac? If time be gained for
him, is there not more
hope of his safety, than if
he were a
corpse by his own hands? Is it nothing
to extend the day of his opportunities._to administer
the hope and consolation which will sustain him,
and enable him to evince his sincerity by the con-
duct of after life? Sickness is not the time for
serious thought, but it is often the occasion of
inducing that serious thought which leads to re-
pentance towards God, and reformation towards
man ; which turns the heart, and amends the life ;
which alters the whole course ofthought, and makes
of man a new creature, a better husband, father,
friend, and member of society; and is it nothing
to place him in the best position for this, so de-
sirable change?
It will be seen that these remarks relate to the
mode of medicining the mind, not to the question
as to whether a
patient is to be deceived! What!
deceived on the limit of eternity? deceived, when
perhaps in a few days or hours, eternity may bc
employed in cursing his deceivers? Awful respon-
sibility! and most fearfully punished for its neg-
lect! To place before ,the patient the almost cer-
tainty of recovery, when the hope of such issue
is slender, is worse than thoughtless, and infatuated;
it is demented or irreligious ! l At the same time,
a
hasty or
brusgue manner of revealingdanger, would
often snap the attenuated thread of life; and for
this, the physician is, caeteris paribus, as
responsible
as he who takes life. In both cases, the respective
parties may have executed the determinations of

494 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
Infinite Wisdom, but with these they have nothing
to do; they have been voluntary agents, and are
responsible for their own acts, as
free; they have
acted without constraint, and must answer without
excuse. It is, then, rather to the manner of com-
municating this knowledge than to the thing itself,
that so much difference of opinion may exist. By
an
intelligent observer of human nature-of the
progress of malady, and of a
patient's individual
character, both moral and physical, these objects
will not be found irreconcileable,-viz. to .speah the
truth, yet cheer the sujerer; to state that the sun
is setting, and yet to fringe his evening glories
with a
beauty which is inimitable, except in nature,
and which, even in nature, is not to be found, but
in departing day, when night's sable mantle is about
to shroud and sepulchre all the living, glowing
tints of light.
We would never
justify, or even
palliate, the
absurd system of keeping the sick in ignorance of
his state, and studiously alienating his atten-
tion from the great subjects of religion, and draw-
ing an
impenetrable veil over his prospects for
futurity, on the principle of not disturbing his
present peace, and of crying,
"
Peace, peace, when
there is no
peace ;" as if the slumbering inmate
of a house on fire is not to be wakened, lest his
sleep should be disturbed, and lest he be alarmed
upon finding his perilous situation; or as if the
careless one who has fallen asleep on the edge of
a beetling precipice, when the next nod will pro-
bably precipitate him into eternity, is not to be

quietly and gently roused, and warned of his
danger! Nothing can be more dangerous in mo-
rality ; nothing more subversive of all sound rea-
soning, good practice, social duty, benevolence to
man, or
religious principle ! But when the trem-
bling balance of life is so
nicely adjusted, that the
slightest weight thrown into the one scale will
immediately sink it beyond the possibility of vibra-
tion; and when that balance is held by the me-
dical man under God, then we should not only
consider it as sinful in such medical person, to
throw in that weight by his own depressing con-
duct; but that it would be likewise criminal in
him to withhold the weight of his influence from
the opposite scale, in which he is bound to employ
every faculty he possesses, to maintain the power
of his patient, while the fearful struggle with the
destroying cause is continued.
A distinction must here be drawn between
acute and chronic disorder. In the former, if
danger attend the sick, and the powers of the
system are
rapidly exhausting, and dissolution is
approaching; to withdraw any of the props on
which that system rests-to take away the support-
ing influence of mind, is to sink it inevitably,
without any compensating good: for, in such
fearful disease really serious thought is impossible ;
and the individual who so acts is accessory to the
destruction of body and soul, if that soul is un-
prepared to meet its God. In such states of acute
suffering, the patient is always too much occupied
with disease to think at all, or to think correctly;

496 'rms RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
and the appointed medium for the reception and
conveyance of thought, (the brain and nervous
system) is too much under the influence of excita-
tion, or depression, or perverted agency, according
to the varying conditions of malady, to
rely in any
degree upon its manifestations.
But in the lengthened attendance, the changeful
forms, the fitful advances, the languor, the pro-
gress, the gradual exhaustion of chronic ailment,
there are abundant opportunities for leading the
patient to a consideration of the brevity and un-
certainty of life; to the frequent unfortunate issue
of long-continued organic disease; to the agency
of remedies, secondary in themselves, and under the
government of the Most High; successful, or the
contrary, according to his will; and to the neces-
sity for preparedness for every event, however much
we are bound to hope, to seek, to pray for restora-
tion, in submission to Him, whose power we
daily
acknowledge, and to whose appointments we con-
stantly, and often unthinkingly, say,
"
Thy will
be done," when the heart secretly adds,
"
So far
as it is in conformity with my own I" The wisdom
and the prudence of trying both sides of a
question,
which involves uncertainty as to its issue, may
always be introduced; more
especially, where that
knowledge involves eternal happiness or
misery.
The necessity of always making provision for the
events of life, for the disposition of property here-
for the protection of property from Ere, or other
accident-and the insurance of life, as a
guarantee
for the interests of survivors, are so many points

on which to ground the importance and necessity
of the individual insuring for himself, when a still
higher stake is involved, even present peace, and
a future eternity of' happiness. The former is very
constantly mentioned, and one of' the usual argu-
ments is, that patients will not die the sooner for
having settled their affairs ; and will they die the
sooner for having settled their spiritual affairs, and
obtained a
guarantee for futurity, in the promises
of God, to the sincere penitent? Again, the good-
ness andthe mercy of God, in afllicting his chil-
dren, and thus calling their attention to serious
things; to the solemn realities of an unseen,
eternal world; the natural reflections of a sick
room, and of abstraction from all the enjoyments
which health and activity confer; the kind atten-
tion of .f'riends; gratitude for the constant supply
of the wants of an invalid; the aids of medicine
and science in relieving distressing symptoms; the
great advantage as well as
duty of a contented
mind; the direction of the patient's reading; and
the recollection, that in a feeble state of the brain
and nervous
system, this reading cannot be exclu-
sive in order to its being beneficial; the great
original cause of all suffering; andthe hopes and
consolations of religion to all those who will em-
brace her invitations, will afford so
many channels,
through which the attention may be steadily
awakened to its situation and responsibilities, to its
present duties and coming prospects.
Even through these natural approaches, the
subject is to be introduced with delicacy, and at

498 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
proper opportunities-not, indeed, with a criminal
fear of grasping its momentous truths-not with a
sheltering lenity of expression, which seeks to
obscure truth; but with the delicate tact which
belongs to the well-instructed and well-educated:
wanting these, the subject will fail of producing
a
good effect upon the mind, while the injury to
the body may be irreparable, and is wholly un-
warrantable. Nothing can exceed the extensive
mischief which arises from injudicious mismanage-
ment of these advantages, both to the patient and
surrounding friends; but in proper hands these
great topics may be so handled as to produce a
good effect even upon the health; and to neglect
such opportunities, is as criminal on the one hand,
as to destroy life on the other by ill-timed appeals
to powerful feelings. The patient sometimes asks
for the probable issue of his maladies-and in such
instances, the best mode of reply is by a candid
and honest summing up of the general probabili-
ties of such states of disordered function, or
organic
disease, and of the individual peculiarities of the
case in question ; and with all the hope which these
peculiarities admit, drawing the final inference,
that where relative uncertainty subsists, the only
safe comduct is, to pursue the means to the pro-
posed end-but to provide a
place of refuge should
that end not be obtained. This is, as we have before
shown, the course of prudent men, with regard to
the evils of life; many persons even insure, against
a time of sickness and old age, when they shall
be no
longer capable of exertion; and is it not

equally imperative, to be protected from moral
evil,
"
by laying up treasures in heaven, where
neither moth nor rust doth corrupt ?" In this way,
the end will be accomplished, while, if the patient
be bluntly told, that there is no chance for him,
(which no man of science or of truth would feel
justified in saying,) the intended result would be
defeated; confidence in the medical attendant
would be destroyed, and the opportunities of moral
influence and suasion will be utterly lost; oppor-
tunities, which would have remained unbroken,
and influence which would have continued avail-
able for the moral good of the sick, had there been
as much wisdom and prudence, as
over-wrought
zeal in the parties concerned.
Ve cannot avoid just noticing here, the very
different influence produced by the mind upon the
body, according to the nature and connexions of
the organ of that body, whose primary irritation
has been the first cause of disturbance to the mani-
festations of mind ; all, for instance, that is hopeful
and cheerful in anticipation, in disease of the
lungs; all that is dark and gloomy in the same
disease of the stomach and liver; and so, also, with
regard to many other of the injurious changes
which first disturb the manifestations of mind, and
then re-act upon the already tortured body.
All violent emotion should be avoided ; and it is
to be recollected, that violent emotion is not a ne-
cessary characteristic of religious impression : while
its continuance would rapidly exhaust, and perhaps
in itseyf might be sufficient to destroy feeble life.

500 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
Religion has a
power, elsewhere unknown, if judi-
ciously employed, to gild the stormy clouds of the
evening of life with the brightness of a
glorious
sunset- full of hope and of promise for to-morrow's
dawn; and it is upon these that the attention of
the patient should be fixed. But while we thus
speak of the consolations of religion, we do not
intend that miserable abuse ofthe holy communion,
which is too common, and too fatal in its influence,
upon really serious thought. In itself, religion
forms the only source of real peace, and hope, and
rest, and joy, and confidence, and cheerful expec-
tation, all of which tend to support the body, while
they tranquillise the mind, and prepare it for its
coming change, (if it be coming) of throwing off
this mortal, and of being clothed with immortality.
But deeply cruel, and awfully criminal is /ae, who
seeks to produce this peace, by an administration
of the sacrament, and by inducing the sick to
believe, that all the evils of a
misspent life are to
be obliterated by receiving the holy rite, at the
eleventh hour, when there is nothing left to give
to God but the last heavings of expiring nature.
How awful the responsibility, even when this effect
has been produced through inadvertence, or from
a fancied want of time frequently to visit a distant
patient, and thoroughly to investigate his case!
"
Want of time
"
is generally the absence of in-
clination ; for time may be created in some
way or
other, by introducing order and method into our
arrangements, for every real call of duty. Deep
and expansive be the stream of our
charity in all

things towards others; severe and impartial be the
scrutiny of ourselves; or we shall one
day feel the
pang of unmitigated remorse for the criminality we
have incurred under this plausible excuse, from
the neglect of a most important talent intrusted to
our cultivation.
Should any doubt the existence of this influence
of the mind over the body, let him make the fol-
lowing simple experiment; let him examine the
muscles of his own arm, in a state of rest and
relaxation, and he will find them soft, and, even in
a state of health, almost flabby. But let him direct
the energy of the will to these muscles, every fibre
will be in action, and the arm will become tense
and rigid ; let him call upon that arm for extraor-
dinary exertion, and this tension and rigidity are
still more marked. Painters and sculptors are well
aware of this law, and whenever any mighty effort
is to be portrayed, the muscles are as if strained
to their utmost degree of tension.
This law, which in its present illustration is phy-
siological, was
beautifully shown in a state of
disease, in the case of Miss Fancourt, which a few
years since powerfully excited the attention of the
public in general, and of the author in particular,
as
being the alleged result of miraculous agency.
And although for the present this question of
modern miracles seems to have receded from public
view, yet as the principles are
always the same,
and always applicable to every succeeding similar
case, our time will not be lost by adding a few

thoughts suggested at the moment by the considera-
tion of its phenomena?
"
In doing so, I beg to state that I do not call in
question the divine interposition; thc only question
is, whether the performance of the cure has been
through the operation of natural means, employed
with submission to the Divine will, and blessed by
Almighty power ; or whether it has been wrought
by the same power, without the intervention of
adequate means, or
by a
process which is opposed
to the ordinary course of nature. Now I firmly
and conscientiously believe that the means of cure
are obvious; the effect of certain constitutional
laws, and adequate to the end proposed. But even
if we could not perceive that they were so, we should
not be justified in drawing a
sweeping inference,
that the effect was a miracle. There are
many of
the wonders of nature which remain to us inscru-
table, but we do not therefore pronounce them to
be miraculous. We acknowledge the footsteps of
infinite wisdom and love, which moves, where finite
minds cannot perceive its traces; and our hearts
are raised in faith and dependence upon that all-
wise, all-powerful, all gracious Governor, for a
continuance of that government, and of those
provisions, of which we
humbly seek to avail our-
selves, we know not why, but only because we
have been taught, that the blessing of God has been

Since the above was written, a new miraculous pretender
has appeared in the person of Dr. Clanny; the following obser-
vations are only the more called for.

promised to, and will attend upon, the performance
of duty.
"
To illustrate this position with regard to the
nervous
system, on which has hinged the cure of
Miss Fancourt, we know that without its iniiuence
it is impossible to move a limb; only suspend its
agency for a moment, by pressure upon a
principal
nerve, and the limb thus subjected to experiment
is powerless and paralysed; take away its influence
from the stomach, and digestion is at an end; in~
terfere with its regular supply to the lungs, or to
the heart, and the circulation is embarrassed;
remove its unceasing distribution from the dia-
phragm, and respiration is at an end, while irre-
coverable death is the immediate consequence.
Thus we see its effects; we know its importance;
we decide upon its agency; and we are certain
that its infiuence is transmitted through certain
white cords; but here our
knowledge ends. In
what way these _perform their function, we are not
acquainted; much more are we
ignorant as to
what is this nervous influence; but we do not,
therefore, infer, when we move a limb, when we
walk, talk, taste. see, hear, smell, &c. Sac., that
all these actions are miraculous; they are most
wonderful, it is true ; but they result from laws,
which we know exist, though we /:now not the source
of their operation. Thus in the present instance
of cure, effected through the medium of tl1e nervous
system, we
pretend not to trace every step of its
progress; but as natural means are adequate to
the end, and as thc system of God's government

everywhere shows, a
working through the agency
of means; we infer, that the same wonder-working
agency has here also been displayed, but that no
miracle has been performed. It is of no consequence
to the argument, that the parties believed in the
miraculous agency of these very means; God often
pleases to bestow his blessing upon means, without
any intention on the part of the agents, so
per-
mitted or
employed, of bringing about certain
events or effects; and the very fact of their non-
acquaintance with the remedial power of these
means, actually added to their influence.
"
This opinion requires to be supported by some
observations with regard to the nature o_f miracles ;
because it is well known that this forms a
strong-
hold of infidelity ; and that nothing could be more
gratifying to the sceptic, than to have the boun-
daries of miraculous agency so widened, as to em-
brace within its pale the simple effects of natural
phenomena; because if some miracles, or rather
alleged miracles, can be shown to be dependent upon
second causes, the inlidel is greatly assisted in his
denial of a GREAT Fmsr CAUSE !
"
A miracle has been defined to be an
efect or
event, contrary to the established constitution, or
nature of things ; or a sensible suspension or con-
trolment of the known laws of nature, that is, of
God's ordinary appointment.
"
In the cure of Miss Fancourt it has been
shown, that the effect was not contrary to the es-
tablished constitution or course
of things, and that
there was no suspension, or controlmcnt, or deviation

from the known laws of nature; on the contrary,
that the effect produced was dependent upon the
physical laws of the constitution; and that these
laws, though commonly hidden from our sight,
were awakened, in this instance, to the highest
energy of action; that action, however, being per-
fectly natural, and ready to be called forth by any
circumstance of high excitement.
"
But miracles have never been performed in cases
where the ordinary physical laws would suffice to
accomplish the cure, in the hands of our
gracious,
all-bountiful God. In such a case the event is
natural, because it is in conformity with those laws
the ordinary operations of which are
commonly
termed the usual course of nature; meaning by the
term nature, not an atheistical fatalism, but the
all-wise system appointed by tl1e Almighty for the
regulation of the universe under his own infinite
supervision and control. The event would be mi-
raculous, if srqrernalural, if brought about by some
superior controlling agency, by a
power which is
above the ordinary constitution of nature, and which,
for the purpose of showing forth the divinity,
changes the course of nature's laws so as to produce
effects, without the intervention of ordinary means,
or
by means which are
perfectly inadequate, or
which have no relation to the end proposed. Yet
it is not every event, brought about by circum-
stances which we do not comprehend, that is mi-
raculous; for before we can decide upon a miracle,
we ought io be acquainted with the natural and
correlative circumstances under which it has taken

place; for if we know not the ordinary course of
nature under given circumstances, we cannot justly
say that there has been a
suspension of; or devia-
tion from, its laws. And since, in the above case,
the ordinary laws of nature were adequate to the
end produced ; and since these admirable resources
were
really called into active employment, although
their existence was unknown to the parties so em-
ploying them, we cannot hesitate to ailirm, that the
cure was not miraculous.
"
Miracles require a much stronger testimony
than common
facts ; and although we
fully receive
the facts themselves of the present case, yet on the
question of miraculous agency, we
require more
testimony. We are then bound to inquire, whe-
tl1er the witnesses possessed the opportunity of
becoming acquainted with all the circumstances of
the case, and their dependence upon, and relation
to, certain natural phenomena; and whether they
were perfectly free from any bias which might
conduce to warp theirjudgment.
"
Now in both these instances, the evidence is
defective; the parties were not acquainted with the
extent and influence of laws which govern the
function of volition; and they also were under the
influence of certain opinions, with regard to the
performance of miracles in the present age of the
Church, which could certainly give a
leaning to-
wards the easy belief of miraculous agency; and,
therefore, however undeniable their testimony as
to the _facts so far as
they understood them, we
hesitate as to receiving it, for that which requires

Fl much stronger testimony, viz. the existence of
miracle.
"
To conclude, therefore, the present case appears
to be deficient in some of the most important cha-
vacteristics of miracle:
"
a. It is true, that there was an
important end to
be accomplished, as far as the perfect restoration of
the patient is implied in such terms. But the
miracles of Moses, of our Lord, and of his divinely-
commissioned ministers, appear to have had a
further object, as to prove the divine authority of
the prophet; or of the message of mercy and of
love which the latter promulgated. On the other
hand, Ishould not be disposed to allow the evidence
in favour of Popish miracles, wrought for tl1e pur-
pose of proving the Divine authority of the Popish
superstition; and, on the same
principle, should
not be disposed to admit the present miracle, in
attestation of certain doctrinal views with regard
to these latter days of the Church. In
t/reformer
instance of our Saviour and his apostles, the doc-
trines and the miracles are inseparable; in the
latter we can trace no connexion between them:
and therefore we do not find that important ulti-
mate good which has appeared to warrant, and
even to require, miraculous interference with the
laws of nature. I would speak cautiously; I would
not deny the possible existence of such ultimate
end, although it appears imperceptible.
"
b. It has been laid down as a criterion of
miracles, that they be instaneously and publicly per-

formed in the presence of witnesses. Certainly
the present case was not publicly wrought; but
the evidence as to the facts is abundantly sa-
tisfactory, though I have before stated its in-
sufficiency to decide the question of miraculous
agency.
"
c. A miracle must be sensible, and easy to
be observed in such way that the reality of the
event may be readily ascertained, as well as that
its origin was supernatural. Now the evidence in
favour of the miraculous cure of Miss Fancourt
is here defective, because it rests on the physio-
logical laws of the nervous
system, which are not
generally known, which were not known to the
parties, and, indeed, which are
scarcely known at
all; and, therefore, not being acquainted with the
regular order of nature, they could not ascertain
what was the effect of one of her beautiful pro-
visions excited to the highest pitch of intensity;
and what was a
supernatural deviation from her

cl. Lastly, a miracle must be mdependent o
second causes, and must not be performed by the
aid of their intervention. It is not enough, that
the cause is hidden from our view, because then, the
greater number of cures
performed by medicine would
be miraculous. We know that certain remedies
will produce certain effects upon the constitution ;
and in the cure of disease we reason
upon these
effects, and we exhibit medicine for the purpose
of producing them. But in the vast majority of

such instances, we know not the mode of opera-
tion of these medicines. Yet reason and experience
teach us, that there is such a relation between cause
and effect, that we
may, in dependence upon pro-
vidential blessing, securely calculate upon obtaining
the latter, from exhibiting the former. Although,
therefore, this process is hidden from our
eyes, and
oftentimes surrounded by impenetrable darkness,
there is no idea of miraculous agency; the effect
is dependent upon second causes, under the blessing
and government of the Great First Cause. And
in the present instance, the #ect was dependent
upon a second cause, of suflicient magnitude to
produce that effect, viz. upon the susceptibility of
the nervous
system, which enabled it, under the
powerful agency of strong excitement, to give such
increased energy to muscular fibres, as that their
feeble actions received immediate strength and
firmness, and continued afterwards to be strength-
ened, to the patient's inexpressible comfort and
joy, and to her own and her friends' overwhelm-
ing gratitude.
"May we all be more
deeply and abidingly
thankful for that power, and wisdom, and good-
ness, and love, displayed in the formation and
preservation of the body, this earthly house of our
tabernacle, of which we know not one half its
wonders; of which they who know the most are
often too unmindful; and of which they who know
the most, and feel the deepest, are the most feel-
ingly convinced of their ignorance, and compa-
rative imbecility; as well as of the uniformity, and

CHAPTER X.
ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE BODY, EXERTED OVER
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MIND.
IT only now remains, for the completion of our
design, to consider a little the influence of bodily
structure and function upon the manifestations of
mind.
We must here notice, in the first place, the great
physical distinctions which have been called tem-
peraments, and which have commonly been classi-
fied as the sanguineous, the choleric, or bilious,
the lymphatic, and the nervous. Ve shall speak
of these individually; but before we do so, we would
state, that a
pure example of any one of these
temperaments is a rare
phenomenon, so that in
the description which follows, it is the exception to
character, not character itself, which is described ;
for in actual, individual life, it will be ascertained,
that there is a mixture of these arbitrary distinc-
tions, in very different proportions however, and
always leaving a
preponderance, which gives its
tinge to the manifestations of mind, so that it may

be said, one of these great distinctions of tempera-
ment presides, however variable the combination,
however different the proportion, and however cha-
racteristic the peculiar influence upon bodily and
mental manifestation.
Ve shall now notice the physical characteristics
of these several divisions of bodily peculiarity, viz.
the sanguineous, the choleric, the nervous, and the
lymphatic.
a. The, sanguineous temperament is strongly
marked by a florid complexion, fair skin, blue eyes,
light hair generally, and oftentimes red, an ani-
mated countenance, bright red lips, an active and
easily-excited circulation, muscular fibres, firm
without rigidity, and elastic without feebleness.
The disorders of such a constitution are
usually
characterised by high action, accompanied by a
certain degree of power to support it: fever is
easily lighted up; and inflammatory action is in-
duced with considerable violence, and sustained,
too, with no
slight degree of pertinacity. In fact,
wherever arterial action is concerned, there will it
be found to a
very considerable extent; and as it
is accompanied with power, it will bear exhausting
remedies better than any other of the peculiar con-
stitutions to be described. There is more
tendency
to considerable disorder of function than to disease
of structure; and the conservative re-action of
nature is very strongly marked in this tempera-
ment.
With regard to the mental manifestations, the
same general law will be observable; there will be

found to be much action, with proportioned power
to support it; the impressions received by such a
constitution will be of a
lively character ; its intui-
tive conception of the relation of things will be
very easy: it will possess a
good and faithful mc-
mory, a rich and lively imagination, great benevo-
lence of disposition, a fondness for society, an
equal
desire to benefit others, and to be benefited by
them ; and a
very considerable degree of ardour in
the pursuit of any object which has excited its in-
terest and attention.
On the other hand, it must be allowed, that it
possesses evils arising from the same source. It is
irascible, easily provoked, and given to high expres-
sions of anger,-to thoughts, and words, and per-
haps even deeds of violence, which a sober judg-
ment would disapprove; the impressions of a
graver
cast are too transient, and there is a
great disposi-
tion to the volatile; even the deep impressions of
sorrow exhaust themselves in vehement expres-
sions or
passionate exclamations; the bitterness of
unmeasured and unhallowed grief, passes away
with this expression; and the April shower, how-
ever violent, soon gives place to the calm and the
sunshine of its own
self-complacency; it is very
ardent in pursuit, but it is uncertain in its etibrt,
and inconstant in perseverance; that which has
engaged the whole soul for a short time, passes
away, and gives place to new, and because new, a
more attractive source of interest: the same is to
be observed in the relations of friendship; the
vehement ardour of the day subsidcs into- a coolness

5l4 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
and indifference, which is exceedingly painful,
because the high action has exhausted itself, and
requires the stimulus of a fresh object, in order to
its being recruited. The same remark may be
made of its hatred; it is a transient passion-+
violent while it lasts, but soon
passing away.
The mental, or rather cerebral diseases, will take
on the same form; they too will be of a violent
character, and mania, rather than melancholy or
hypochondriasis, will give the prevailing tinge to
its wanderings. There will be a certain degree of
joyousness, of self-contentment, and self-esteem,
about all its delirations ; a consciousness of dignity,
an
impatience of command, an
assumption of
superior knowledge, either delegated from the
Deity, or
perhaps emanating from .Deity itsef
which, with its frequent changefulness, will strongly
characterise the peculiarities of this uncompounded
temperament. Its influence on the expression of
religious feeling will be hereafter considered.
This, as well as every other peculiarity of tempe-
rament, is constantly found in combination with
those of a different caste, and these will be modified
according to the greater or less amount of that in-
fusion.
l>., But we notice, secondly, the bilious, or choleric
temperament. Now, wherever this is the prevail-
ing peculiarity, there will be found, a dark com-
plexion-dark hair-dark eyes-penetrating look
-a
dry skin-strong muscular fibres, but not so
elastic as in the former ; not disposed to, or
capable
of; the same amount of exertion; yet perhaps en-

during longer a sustained eifort, without giving
way so
readily, and without the same amount of'
constitutional suffering.
A great deal of mental power, and the best lite-
rary characters, will be found in this class; because
there belongs to it a
greater degree of constancy
and perseverance of pursuit; and because the secret
of success consists in persevering against present dif-
iiculties, and only looking upon them as stimuli to
call up the degree of energy necessary to overcome
them. There is not here, the same
easy conception
of the relations of things, but there is a
deeper
acquaintance with their hidden connexions, a
greater seeking-out of their intimate points of
approximation, which, after all, constitutes the
deepest knowledge of things as
they are; the
memory may not be so
quick and easy of applica-
tion; but it is ultimately more distinct and vivid,
though exercised over a few objects: there is more
attention to the society of books than of persons;
and the attractions of the library are greater than
those of the drawing-room; there may not be the
same fervour of affection, but there is a
greater
degree of constancy in its exercise, and a greater
amount of self-denial, in order to do good to its
object; there may not be the same vehement ex-
pressions of grief, but there is a
deeper sorrow,
there may not be the same social attractions about
the person, but he is more to be relied upon in
every situation of life, as the man of unshaken
firmness, of unbending principle, of uncompromis-
ing rectitude,-just in every feeling and action;

516 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
cautious, it is true, in forming his determinations,
but not afterwards to be bought from his purpose
by smiles, or swerved away from the line of recti-
tude by all the frowns and obloquy which may be
heaped upon him ; being, in the truest sense of the
word, courageous, because he has the courage to stem
the torrent of evil-to run counter to prevailing
fashion-to yield up himself and all that he has,
as a
willing hostage to right, rather than be tempted
to do what is wrong. It generally happens in
public life, that the largest amount of eloquence,
connected with a
preponderating share of persever-
ance and fortitude, is to be found in the choleric
temperament.
Yet this so
happily-adjusted body has also its
evils. It is peculiarly liable to what are called
bilious headaches, which may perhaps sometimes be
dependent upon the stomach, but which much more
frequently arise from the head, while the stomach
only sympathises, or suffers secondarily from its
affection, It is not high arterial action, which is
commonly to be met with in this temperament, but
generally congestion-a sluggish action in the
veins of the different organs of the body, and par-
ticularly of the head. The constitution will not
bear the same active remedies, as in the sanguineous
temperament; yet, if properly treated, can better
sustain the repeated impulses of morbid tendency,
and rise superior to them. It is more liable than
the former to chronic disorder, inasmuch as venous
congestion takes place slowly-at first, without
exciting much notice or general disturbance; and

thus the way is prepared for alteration of structure,
or slow disorganisation, before almost that it is cog-
nisable ; it is more liable to disorders of the diges-
tive organs, and they persist, oftentimes, with a
great degree of obstinacy.
With regard to its morbid manifestations of mind,
it must be allowed, that here also there are evils to
be combated. It is true, that such a character is
not
easily given to change; is not to be tossed about
by every fashionable alteration of opinion, or
by
any change of personal association ; but then it is
liable to prejudice; its conscientious belief may
become bigotry; its firmness, obstinacy; its cau-
tion, suspicion; its reserve, a concentration into
self, which may be very unamiable, and which may
curtail its usefulness. So also, its courage may be-
come
temerity; its perseverance, the foolhardy
pursuit of objects which are unattainable, or which,
if attainable, are
only to be reached by an effort
rlisproportioued to their value; the fondness for
literary pursuit rather than society, is apt, too, to
make a selfish character, and to take off the man
from the duties of action to the pleasures of abstrac-
tion ; from the realities oflife, to the enjoyment of
its own little world; that "
kingdom," which has
been poetically described, as fitted for the pre-
sidence of mind. There is also, perhaps, too great
a
disposition to find fault with the world-to com-
plain of its treatment-to be captions over its deal-
in gs-to take umbrage upon slight causes-to be sus-
picious of evil, where no evil is intended-and to
imagine that it is unjust, when, in reality, the

difference of thought arises from a want of accord-
ance in the differing physical temperaments, and
from a want of unity in the separate views, and
thoughts, and habits of action.
In mental disease, this, which is perhaps the first
germ of disorder, shows itself more
strongly : the joy-
ousness of the self-conceited happy maniac, the pro-
phet, the apostle, the Son of God himself, is not here
to be met with : but the first striking characteristic
trait is the disposition to gloom-to look at
the dark
side ofevery thing-to be surrounded byaccumulated
ills-to be the sport of evil spirits and evil thoughts
-to be abandoned of God-to become subject to
voices, visions, dreams, &c.-to have incurred the
wrath of Heaven-to be pursued by vengeance
which cannot be escaped-to be followed by ene-
mies, slanderers, murderers-to be weary of life-
to bear it along as an intolerable burden-and,
finally, to escape from its present evils, and the still
greater evils of futurity, by recklessly and know-
ingly, yet insanely, plunging into these greater
evils, by a
hopeless act of self-destruction. Yet
such is the history-the melancholy history of the
choleric patient, among whom are too frequently
to be found the hypochondriacs, the monomaniacs,
and the suicides of' our
day.
Most remarkable is this tendency to suicide in
the hypochondriac, and in the man who is such with
a choleric temperament; and we would state this:
not as a
support to the absurd doctrine so frequently
held in our coroner's courts, where the absurdity
almost universally prevails of finding the cause of

the patient's death, without one tittle of evidence,
without even
inquiring after it, and very generally
with a refusal to inquire after it: when lately this
absurdity was
heightened, within the author's own
knowledge, by the jury finding a verdict, not only
without evidence as to the cause of death, but with-
out one shadow of evidence as to the identity of the
supposed party, touching whom the inquest was
said to have been held. "
O what does it signify ?"
said the foreman,
"
he will be identified to-mor-
row." I repeat, that I do not state this in support
of the absurd doctrine so frequently laid down,
that a
person who commits suicide must be insane
because no man in his senses would commit such
an act. But I state the fact as a
very remarkable
one, that when the organ of mind is diseased, par-
ticularly in a choleric temperament, the tendency
is largely developed, to produce sefdzlsorganisation of
that very organ so disordered : and certainly this
is a
proof, if such were required, of insanity. This,
however, is widely different from that state of things,
in which he is brought to moral despair, by acts
and conduct of his own, or when he has lived a life
of opposition to every moral motive, and religious
sanction,-a life of self-gratification, without refer-
ence to social or relative obligation-alike forgetful
of the laws of God and man, and when, with a
worn-out constitution and a ruined fortune, he
perceives nothing but misery in the world, and
futurity is a blank-if not a hideous yawning of
fearful and remorseless uncertainty ; or when a
man has lived a life of thoughtless, selfish extra-

vagance in the world, and has beggared himself
and his family by his follies, and sees (too late to
retrieve his fortunes) inevitable ruin before him ; or
wheu, after a life of diligent prosperity in business,
some hidden reverse of fortune places him in the
hands of merciless creditors, and he has no
higher
moral or
religious principle to fall back upon ; or
when a
young person has deviated from the paths
of virtue, and "
finds, too late, that men betray,"
and cannot bear up under the finger of scorn, and
looks to the horror of the shame before man, rather
than to repentance before God; in all these cases,
suicide is not insanity. Granted that it is false
reasoning, because the proper doctrines and motives
are not called into action ; but it is a wilful error; it
is the false reasoning, of continuing alien from
God, as all their life has been, and of finishing that
life of forgetfulness, by an act of rebellious defiance
against Him.

pass on to notice the lymphatzb tem-
perament. The great characteristic of this peculiar
style of constitution, (and unhappily it is not in-
frequent,) is the prevalence of the white fluids, and
the general feebleness of the system. It is com-
monly marked by a
pale and thick skin; by great
softness of the muscular fibre; by thick lips, which
give the appearance of the mouth being only half
closed ; by soft hair, generally ofa light flaxen hue ;
by clear, soft, languid, blue eyes,-and by a
feebleness of character, which extends throughout
every department of the mechanism. This consti-
tution is peculiarly liable to consumption, glan-

dular affections, atrophy, and all the varied forms in
which scrofula proclaims its ravages and its power.
Hence, in all the actions, and in all the disorders
of the lymphatic temperament, great feebleness, and
utter inability to support action, are the prominent
features; the system possesses very little conserva-
tive energy; and when once morbid action has
commenced, there is little chance of arresting it ; it
will generally proceed till it has involved the
patient in more or less of misery. There would seem
to be a kind of exemption from these laws, in some
very brilliant children, who come out as
prodigies
of intellect: we hear of them as
evincing mental
talents of the first order, and presently we hear of
them no more. And why is it? The organ,
stretched beyond its elastic power, has given way;
and fatuity has been the consequence: or if the
circulation of the brain, rather than the nervous
structure itself, has been the seat of morbid action,
the little creatures have fallen victims to hydro-
cephalus; so truly may it have been said, that
"
man cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down ;"
his early life was full of promise, but the night of
the grave, or the indistinct twilight of idiocy, has
shrouded him for ever from our view; we
hope
only to breathe a
purer atmosphere, where there
will be no danger of destroying the animal machi-
nery by intellectual labour.
But it may be said, that although this precocious
talent may have been overdone by injudicious
stimulation, yet that, under happier auspices, a
diflerent result would have been obtained; and

522 THE nEc1PnocAL INFLUENCE
so, doubtless, it would to a certain extent, but not
entirely; the mischief has consisted, not simpy'
in over-stimulation, but in the inherent feeblsness
of the nervous fibre, thus affording another eluci-
dation of the principle, that action and power are
by no means coincident properties, that they are
seldom found together, and that the presence of
the former is by no means a
guarantee for the
existence of the latter, but rather is an indication
that it does not exist; the deep waters of intellect
are calm and undisturbed, but are
capable of bear-
ing on their bosom alarge freight of mental wealth,
while the shallow stream of noisy manifestation
ends where it begins, in the bubble of powerless
exhibition. This, therefore, does not form an ex-
ception to the general law of feebleness, which
pervades the lymphatic temperament, and under
which it so
frequently sinks to a
premature grave.
With regard to the mental manifestations of the
lymphatic temperament, the same law will influ-
ence their developement, viz. action without power
to support it; if called upon for much exertion,
the mind will wear out itself and its habitation
in a short time; and thus, it is frequently said
that the mind has worn out the body. If so, the
following is the probable rationale. ln the lym-
phatic temperament, there is more action than
power; therefore too much nervous
energy is ex-
pended upon action; enough cannot be spared
ibr the functions of interior life, and principally
for those of nutrition and sanguification; the body
is not nourished, red blood is produced in still

diminishing quantities; the supply of nervous
energy from its great emporium, is still further
lessened, and its distribution still more curtailed;
more and more disorder is produced, and the
weakest organ or the most oppressed gives way,
and perhaps gives way irretrievably; and very
frequently it is the brain, the organ of mind,
which is first distressed, and then destroyed.
Still further, with regard to the passions and
affections, action without power is again the cha-
racteristic; and, therefore, in all these relations, the
flame of life is fast consumed; the heart exhausts
the head, and destroys the integrity of the system ;
there is a certain vehemence of passion and aH`ec~
tion which cannot be sustained; and is, therefore,
not to be relied upon for continuance, where it
is desirable to remain ; nor for its permanence, where
it is desirable that it should cease ; as, for instance,
in anger, which may be vehement, but will not
be long continued, and the offended party will be
easily soothed into forgiveness. This proceeds
from two causes; first, the inability of the lym-
phatic temperament to maintain action under any
circumstances; and next, the impression of this
law upon the nervous system in particular, the
organ appointed for the manifestation of mind.
ln mental diseases there will be found a
greater
number of fools, epileptics, idiots, and of those who,
not coming under either of these classes, may still
be considered as helpless, feeble, with limited maui-
festations of mind, and of those who are_rather
below than above mediocrity, as regards the average

O
of intellectual calibre, in the lymphatic than in any
other temperament.
d. But we notice, lastly, some of the peculiari-
ties of the nervous
temperament. The predomi-
nance of the nervous
system, to such an extent as
to constitute this form of character, is to be found
in union with each of the former states. Great
susceptibility is the chief property of this condition ;
only the mode J that susceptibility will receive a
tinge from the greater or less prevalence of the
three formerly described constitutions. In the ner-
vous
temperament the patient is generally thin;
for there is too great restlessness of action, too great
mobility of system, tp admit of the deposit of fatty
matter; there is generally very little colour about
the countenance, and perhaps this is accounted for,
by the fact, that, although a rush of blood to that
countenance is easily occasioned by nervous emo-
tion, yet this is only momentary; the blood rushes
back to its citadel, and leaves the countenance
deadly pale; while the general tendency of ner-
vous
patients, is to accumulate blood about the
heart, and therefore to deprive the surface of its
colour. This, too, may be supported by the de-
licacy of the muscular fibre of nervous
tempera-
ments; and the muscular fibres of the heart, par-
taking that delicacy,-the blood, if quickly, is not
energetically sent round the system, because the
heart wants contractile power. The features are
generally animated; but it is not the cheerful,
equable animation of the sanguiueous temperament;
there is a fickle brilliancy about its light, as the

sun's rays are sometimes seen through an un-
clouded but a
vapoury atmosphere : there is a
great
degree of mobility and changefulness about the
countenance ; its expression is most varied and in-
telligent; but there is an air of languor, and even
of occasional melancholy, about its expressiveness,
which gives it a
very distinctive mark; and the
changes of this expression are exceedingly rapid,
so that the entire character is known by its sus-
ceptibility to impression-by the non-continuance
of one
state-by the frequent change of emotion,
and by the great mobility of the animal system,
under the influence of such morbid change.
After all, perhaps this great mobility of the
system is more characteristic of the nervous tem-
perament, for it is very uniformly and strongly
marked both in health and disease. The influ-
ence of emotion may be sudden, and may appear
to be very deep; but it is quickly superseded by
the developement of any new emotion, this again
to be easily displaced by the third succeeding
wave. This is seen in a
very remarkable manner,
in disorders of the nervous
system; there is often-
times no
possibility of catching or detaining the
symptoms; but while one set of functions is dis-
turbed, and we are considering the rationale of
morbid action, in order to draw the curative in-
dications; even before our
eyes, these symptoms
have vanished, and another series of disordered
actions has commenced in some other, and per-
haps very distant part of the animal economy.
This is remarkably shown in the protean forms of

hysteria; the heart, the lungs, the muscles of re-
spiration, the stomach, the bowels, the head, the
muscles of organic life, those of locomotion, &c.,
are all interchangeably affected; the patient laughs
and cries vehemently almost in the same instant of
time-the ideas are
perverted- observations are
made which are
utterly alien to the healthy cha-
racter, and are
prompted by the nature of the
organ, which happens to be at the moment the
primary cause of irritation to the brain; or, at all
events, occupying the most prominent part in the
disordered movements.
The disturbance of the nervous
system may pro-
duce, {simply, a
variety of cramps or
spasms, dis-
orders of breathing, of digestion, and of various
other functions, which may be disturbed, or alto-
gether suspended; but it may also in this form
give rise to tic-douloureux, and the severe forms of
nervous malady.
Still further, there may be great disturbance of
the nervous
system at its centre; and catalepsy,
epilepsy, the appearance of ghosts, visions, reve-
lations from God, communications from the evil
one, and the various forms of insanity, are the
consequence. Even here, amidst these deepening
shades of malady, the liability to change, the great
mobility of the system, and the consequent altera-
tion of appearances, is very characteristic. The
phases of to-day are not traceable to-morrow, and
have given way to a third set of phenomena on
the succeeding day. In fact, versatility is stamped
upon all the movements of the nervous tempera-

ment, whether natural or disordered; and this,
together with great susceptibility to impression,
and the rapid and powerful developement and
manifestation of emotion, constitute its essential
character.
Now these several marked temperaments, and
all the lesser differences which exist from the in-
terlacing of their minor peculiarities, exert an in-
fluence upon all the manifestations of healthy mind,
and give the tinge to what is called character,
which really means the assemblage of mental
phenomena, variously grouped according to the
greater or less prevalence of any one of those
peculiarities ; how much greater, then, will be their
influence, when the entire machinery is overturned
by sickness-when every function is perverted,
every organ irritated, and the balance of healthy
mental manifestation is destroyed.
One cannot wholly pass over the state of sleep,
as a
bodily condition which largely influences the
manifestations of mind. When sleep approaches,
it will first be found that attention flags; the stu-
dent is compelled to go over again the same
ground
in order to catch the idea of his author. In an
instant more, the mind wanders; broken, irregular,
and disconnected images are presented, and unless
superseded by some new
impression, sleep imme-
diately ensues. In this state, all the mental mani-
festations are laid aside; and, although the mind
may go on working, its operations are not dis-
cernible. It may be said, indeed, that mental
operations go on in dreaming ; but a little attention

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
will show, that dreams are not the result of mental
operations, but rather of cerebral action, when, by
some
changed circumstances, it has escaped the
control of the presiding mind. For if it be al-
lowed, as it is on all hands, that mind, whatever it
may be, is superior to body, it will follow, that
mental operations, if conducted during a state
when the body is not subservient to their influence,
will not be impaired by this abstraction, but will
be rather improved by it. And then, when the
character of dreams is estimated; when it is found
that they are full of monstrous, and perverted, and
impossible situations; that they observe no order
or method, in the concentration of circumstances;
that they are full of anachronisms; that time
and space are annihilated; that the actions of
years are
grouped into a few seconds; that they
abound in images of the most incongruous and
absurd description ; that they do not represent the
character, but are often diametrically opposed to
it; that the nonsense
they contain, would be a
disgrace to the most starveling intellect; when all
these things are considered, it cannot but be al-
lowed, that dreaming is not a mental operation,
that it is a
bodily agency, the action of brain when
dissociated from the presiding mind by the influ-
ence of sleep ; a
purely bodily condition in which
are suspended all the functions but those which are
necessary to the continuance of life; thus exhibit-
ing one of the modes of influence of the body over
the manifestations of mind. The actions indis-
pensable to the sustentation of life are continued,

but those required for the manifestation of mind are
laid at rest.
There are few persons who have observed at all,
who have not observed the changes which take
place, in the course of time, in their opinions-in
their modes and habits of thought and action-in
the relative importance which they assign to dif-
ferent objects-in their estimate of human action
and passion-and in the amount of interest which
is claimed by the various circumstances and situa-
tions of life. So much is this the case, that it is
a common
though an erroneous observation, that
man
gets an entire change of himself, once in
seven
years. Commonly-received errors have ge-
nerally some foundation in truth, and this is one
of such errors; it is an error to assert that this
change happens at any determinate period; for
the process is a
gradual' one, and is constantly,
though slowly, going on; but it wh true that it is
going on, though so
slowly, that the change is
only perceptible by instituting a
comparison be-
tween two somewhat distant periods of life. Again,
it has been said, that adult life may be divided
into three ages-that of love, ambition, and
avarice ; and in this there is a
great deal of truth :
we
only require these truths in the present instance,
in order to show the general belief in this doctrine
of change in the manifestations of mind. And
this change occurs
chiefly in the manifesting organ ;
and is a
proof of the influence of body upon mental
agency.
At first, in very early life the brain is incapable

of more than a
very little intellectual effort; and
having few instincts, the offspring of man is pe-
culiarly feeble und helpless; and with all his high
future destiny, and with all his larger brain, and
all his capacities, he possesses fewer manifestations
of mind, than the young of the inferior animals; a
fact which is inexplicable, except by supposing
that the brain is prepared for the service of a
super-
added principle-a spiritual and immortal prin-
ciple. At this early period, even the reports of
the senses are not to be relied upon, except as the
report of one is corrected or confirmed by that of
ot/ters-a plain proof that the mind does not reside
in the senses, and that, although our ideas are
obtained through this medium, it is only by asso-
ciation and comparison that they will become data
for future thought or action, emotion or
passion.
The senses, then, must be educated, or instructed ;
that is, their nerves must be taught to review and
to adjust the corrected impressions. But the nerves
are mere carriers to the brain, and an extension
of its range of power; so that if the nerves
require
to be instructed, so must the brain, in which they
terminate. And, therefore, the peculiarities of the
bodily structure will exercise their power over their
primary impressions or movements as well as on
their secondary aflinities and associations, and their
intellectual or affective results. The influence of
the body over the mind in its early developement,
its maturity, decay, and decrepitude, will be con-
siderable; at first, partaking of all the elasticity,
the lightness, the gaiety of youth; then exhibiting

the firmness, and the strength, and action of early
manhood ; again retaining its firmness, but losing
its elasticity and buoyancy; and then beginning
to show symptoms of the decay, which is even-
tually to terminate in that decrepitude, when the
grasshopper shall be a burden. We have already
spoken of the exception to this general law, where
it does exist; it is enough, therefore, for our
present purpose, that through all the several stages
of existence, the body exerts a considerable influ-
ence over the manifestations of mind, even in its
healthiest condition; and it need not be said, how
much more this is the case, if the body he dis-
ordered, and the phenomena of sudden ailment be
superadded to this constant natural influence.
Then the actions of brain and the manifestations
of mind are overturned ; so that perhaps an entire,
at all events a
great, perversion of thought or
feeling, of action or passion, occurs ; that state which
we have mentioned as
belonging to approaching
sleep, is iirst discovered-brain acting independ-
ently of mind, only that the images are
perverted,
and become liable to all kinds of morbid manifes-
tation.
Not only does the peculiar temperament mani-
fest and display its characteristic traits; but all
the mental manifestations are influenced by phy-
sical causes. Thus the intellectual faculties will be
found to predominate in one, and in another the
affective ; memory will be quick and evanescent in
one, slow and retentive in another, quick and yet
abiding in a third; the attention will be easily

directed, or
impossible to command; association
will be brilliant and correct-brilliant and fanciful,
-or slow and yet most erroneous in different in-
dividuals, because founded on
imaginary points of
resemblance which have no existence in truth;
and in a fourth person it may be slow yet sound,
where it has been worked out with great labour
and anxiety; and all these varieties may be pre-
dicated by an observer, who has at once the intuitive
power of discovering the secret springs of action,
and of knowing what will be the natural conse-
quence of any given combination of tendencies,
which arise out of physical temperament.
This influence of body upon mind, though con-
fessedly great, has been sometimes represented as
greater than it really is. Thus it has been said,
that the mind is in the hand, and that there it
originates the motions which attach to that organ.
But this is untrue; take for example the familiar
instance of the hand as the organ of prehension,
and let its object be to take up an
orange from the
table: there is no
origination of the mental desire
for the orange in the hand ; on the contrary, the
eye is first directed towards it; the impression of
the existence of the orange is made upon the optic
nerve, and conveyed to the brain; the idea of an
orange is thus conceived in the mind, and by asso~
ciation with previous impressions received through
the sense of taste, a
knowledge of its properties is
awakened ; the desire after its possession is kindled,
and unless there be some
opposing moral motive,
(as that of the orange not being ours
by right,)

or BODY AND MIND. 533
the emotion of desire for its possession, is followed
by a
mandatory notice sent down to the hand to
take it; and then, in obedience to, and under the
immediate influence of, presiding mind, the hand
does take it; there being no mind in the hand, but
that hand being acted upon by the brain as the
organ of mind through the nerves which supply
it with the power of voluntary motion.
`
Too great a
degree of mechanical agency has
been ascribed to mind ; as, for instance, it has been
said, that for want of due caution, the mind actually
brca/as up or rends its own animal machinery in
the same
way as bones or muscles have been occa-W
sionally broken or
ruptured by intense muscular
action. But this is not true, in the first place;
for the symptoms of sensorial torpor, which arise
as a
consequence of cerebral over-action, are not
those which are
produced by the lesion of nervous
fibre; the latter is followed by distinct paralysis,
while the former does not produce any such symp-
toms, although they may occasionally be found
co-existent. In fact, the brain is not an
organ,
of which we can
speak mechanically at all; and if
we do so, it must be merely an account of the
poverty of language, not possessing words to ex-
press our ideas, and therefore employing those
which are
only weakly, because analogically, ap-
plicable, in order to express things of which we
know not the ultimate rationale. Thus we are
unacquainted with the precise character of nervous
fibre, and cannot, therefore, tell how far it may be
capable of extension, elasticity, motion, and other

properties of matter ; and, therefore, it is unwise to
talk of rending a
machinery, of which we know not
even that the term machine is at all applicable to
its nature. And then arises the fact, that the
symptoms of overdone brain are not those of me-
chanical injury.
It is dillicult, nay, impossible, to say, dpriori,
what the brain can bear; since one brain can
sustain a
degree of effort and continued exertion
without injury, under which another sinks; and
like every other organ and function of the animal
economy, it is capable of having its power of action
immensely increased by exercise; an effort which
it can
barely sustain now, will, after a little while,
be supported without consciousness of its being an
effort ; and so
power and action will go on increas-
ing, and mutually creating each other up to a
certain point; and it is not until exercise is fol-
lowed by exhaustion, that it begins to partake a
morbid character. Even then, it is not the organ
itself which first suffers, but some other organ or
function of the body, the stomach, the heart, &c.,
digestion, assimilation, sanguification, and so forth ;
it is then that the brain gets a
dgicient or dete-
riorated supply of less-perfectly animalized blood,
than it should do; itself becomes uneasy, restless,
irritable; the sleep is disturbed or
oppressed,
generally the former, and the brain is not sufli-
ciently recruited for the daily purposes of lite.
Nevertheless, these functions are carried on; and
therelbre, every day its capital of strength is di-
minished; it has less and less power of action;

one or another of its actions fail, and generally vo-
lition, because this requires the most active state
of obedience to the presiding mind; and now,
morbid action has actually commenced, and unless
timely arrested, it will go on till the organ ceases
to be capable of intellectual employment, or it will
approach the confines of idiocy; or
insanity and
perverted manifestations will follow ; or it will
become torpid, and incapable of its usual functions,
rarely, indeed, but perhaps occasionally, being
subject to apoplexy or
palsy. But these are rare,
and even where they do exist, cannot be ascribed
to the mechanical agency of mind, tearing up and
destroying its own
machinery. It is not, therefore,
just so to speak; and it is very necessary to make
accurate distinctions in a matter which is so much
the subject of dispute.
The contrary has, however, been supported by
an
argument drawn from the muscular power fre-
quently exhibited, during the paroxysms of de-
lirium, mania, hysteria, epilepsy, and other _ana-
logous conditions ; and these muscular movements
have been ascribed to the inlwrent mechanical force
of mind. But this is not true, because,
First, no effort of mind, however great, produced
under circumstances of unwonted excitement-say
under an
impression of the fear of death, and the
only mode of escape being by some extraordinary
effort,--ever did, or ever could give rise to muscular
actions of such vehemence as those to which we
have alluded; therefore no mind, by the highest
effort of the will, stimulated to the utmost by the

Secondly, the movements in question are inde-
pendent of mind; for if dependent upon mind,
they must have an
object! Now, however much
it has been asserted, and justly too, that mental

yet it never has been propounded by the most
hardy controversialist, that the muscular efforts of
delirium, mania, hysteria, and epilepsy, are
always
with design; they may be sometimes, as when the
maniac struggles to release himself from confine-
ment,- but they are
generally automatab, having no
particular design, and therefore independent of
mind; for in order to their being mental, there
must be a motive, and if a motive, some end pro-
posed to be accomplished ; and,
Thirdly, while no effort of mind could produce
these movements, and while they are
produced inde-
pendent of mind, they are
really and in effect, occa-
sioned by irritation of the nervous fibre; this, per-
haps, being sometimes produced by the disorder of
some organ at a distance; and at others, by an
affection of the brain itself, that brain always
having, in each case, too great a
predisposition to
easy disturbance. It is clear, that hysteria and
epilepsy may be fezyned ; and thus it would seem
as if they might be produced by mind; but the
genuine is easily distinguished from the spurious
paroxysm; and the fact of this failure of the
assumed state, is really a
proqf of the doctrine we
have advanced.

or BODY AND MIND. 537
But if these disordered movements of the muscles
are sometimes the consequence of sympathetic irri-
tation, in some of the organs or functions of inte-
rior or
organic life; it follows, that the nerves
which supply these viscera, are in communication
with the brain; that their irritation, though not
sensibly felt in their extremities, is impressed upon
the sentient organ ; and that this irritation is corn-
municated to the voluntary muscles, in a
way to
us
inexplicable, if we are
required to trace the links
of causation, but which, notwithstanding, sufli-
ciently demonstrates the presiding influence of one
grand principle over the whole, so that no one
part
can sufler, without producing various sympathetic
sufferings.
It may be well to mention here, an instance of
nervous
pain produced by this irritation ; take
tooth-ache for example; the pain shall begin in a
tooth-shall be cognizably dependent upon a tooth
-shall be cured by the removal of a tooth; and
yet, after it has lasted a certain length of time,
where is the pain felt? Not in the tooth, but at
the angle of the jaw-the side of the ear-the an-
terior part of the ear
particularly-the temple-the
side of the head-even behind the ear,-in fact,
successively in every twig of facial nervous distri-
bution : and the sufferer, holding his breath in order
to relieve the pain, is another wonderful proof of this
distant association of nervous influence, in conse-
quence of the immediate connexion of these nerves
with the function of respiration.

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
pain produced by the irritation of the extremities
of nerves, is felt not in these particular fibres, but
at the origin of their branches, or in some other
distinctly-connected twigs, is never to be forgotten;
because it may serve to account for many seeming
anomalies, and will at all events silence an anta-
gonist, who seeks to get rid of some of the pheno-
mena of nervous influence, by saying, that the brain
is not conscious of irritations which take place in
the extremities of nerves, especially those of organic
life: and thus seeking to dissociate the one from
the other, which nature has linked together in a
compact indissoluble, except with life.
And as if Nature had not taken a
suliiciency of
care under ordinary circumstances, to keep up this
uniformity of action and passion, and to preserve
every part of the 'system in one harmonious whole,
she has specially provided for this purpose, one
nerve-the great sympathetic-in order to sustain
this inter-communication between every part of the
animal economy; a
messenger of good offices from
the one to the other, giving notice ofall the changes
in its several departments, and accomplishing the
great purpose of preserving every part of this com-
plicated machinery in one whole; thus proving, that
Nature has taken the greatest possible pains to
preserve life, and making it wonderful, not that life
lasts so long as it does, but that it terminates so
soon.
The important agency of the great sympathetic,
affords an illustration of the fact, that the value of
the function of a nerve does not depend upon its

size : for although it is termed the great sympathetic,
on account of its important ofiice, and the magni-
tude of its connexions, it is in point of fact very
small-perhaps the very smallest of the body, con-
sidering the length of its course, its multiplied
otlices, the number of organs to which it gives
twigs, its connexion with the ganglionic system,
and the complete dependence upon it for the har-
monies of life,-the master-key, which serves to
unlock all the rest. The importance of this fact is
still further illustrated by the phrenic nerve-very
minute, yet long in its course-and given off early,
as if to maintain the easiest possible connexion with
the brain, and so distributed to the diaphragm,
and connected with the function of respiration,
that any pressure upon it puts an end instan-
taneously to that function, and produces imme-
diate death.
We notice however next, that changes in the in-
ternal condition of the viscera, operate powerfully
in modifying the nature of our mental manifesta-
tions. Now, this is really a fact, which is almost
universally admitted, though perhaps little thought
is given to the rationale of the process by which it
is effected. Man is very fond of excusing his own
delinquencies,--his ill-temper, his moodiness, his
irritability, his absurd sensitiveness, his moroseness,
his captiousness, and allthe thousand forms of HOME
disagreeables, and placing them to the score of his
stomach, his liver, his digestion, his bile, &c. &c.,
though he will be seldom found to make these ex-
cuses for the same failings in others; and the little

5410 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
underlined monosyllable just noted, requires some
more
especial attention, since it is at /mme that the
peculiarities are seen, and these excuses made.
Abroad, man is all smiles, and kindness, and bene-
volence; and, generally speaking, interior life does
not disturb his apparent good-humour. Now this is
not, that the same
influence is not continued and
exerted; but that the will is called in to resist its
agency. If so, the will may be, and ought to be,
exerted at home as well as abroad: and if under
given circumstances the mind shows itself capable
of being superior to the tyranny of these organic
suggestions, it is bound to be so at all times; it is
bound to call in its own master principles to super-
sede these morbid tendencies, and to be at home
what he is abroad. Nothing can
get rid of his re-
sponsibility ; and as it has been before stated, so it
is now re-asserted, that presiding mind is the
supreme governor; and that the brain and nervous
system are the servants of that principle; and so
long as man remains in a state of society, he must
maintain this supremacy.
This by no means
supersedes the fact, that irrita-
tions of the ganglionic viscera do modify our sen-
sations greatly; do exért an influence upon the
manifestations of mind ; and do tend very much to
pervert them. Every one is sensible of this :
during
the process of digestion, if healthy, there is an
inaptitude for cerebral occupation ; and if un-
healthy, a
variety of uneasy phenomena are
pro-
duced, so as in aggravated instances to occasion
great perversion of action, as in the visions of the

celebrated Nicolai, and the daily sensations of less
celebrated personages. We are all sensible how
different is our
impression of the same circum-
stances, events, and things, under different states of
organic irritation, insomuch that we can
scarcely
believe them to be the same. This state is generally
accompanied by uneasy slumbers, by dreams,
nightmare, &c., all of which indicate irritation of
some
portion of the cerebral fibre, to such an extent,
that when dissociated during sleep from the imme-
diate influence of presiding mind, they fall at
once into perverted action. And this is that minor
state of irritation, which, in a more
aggravated form,
dissociates the brain from its governing principle,
and produces insanity, which is only a darker cloud
of that early cerebral irritation, which is exhibited
in disordered temper, or
captious feeling. Insanity
we believe to be, very generally, a
primary affec-
tion of the brain ; but it has been shown in some
instances to be secondary, and to be the result of
accumulated irritations, which commence in organic
life, and which at first merely sour the temper.
Hence, the importance of arresting those lesser
irritations, by calling in the aid of good prin-
ciple to extinguish and supersede them in their
very earliest stage, while yet they do not pos-
sess the power and combination of rebellious sub-
jects.
It may be asked, perhaps, why the nerves of
organic life have been thus made to communicate
with the brain, when their agency seems
only pro-
ductive of disturbance. The truth is, we

542 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
the occasional disturbing agency, and do not per-
ceive the constant harmonizing influence. The
reason of this communication is, however, obvious ;
it is conservative, in order that the mind should be-
come
acquainted with the wants of interior life, and
should minister to all its great functions. If this
were not the case, man, with his few and feeble in-
stincts, would be helpless indeed ; and it is in
consequence of his high position in the animal cre-
ation-of his accountability-and of his being here
in a
probationary state, that this connexion proves
a source of trial to him, and an occasion for drawing
out his principles, and throwing him upon himself,
and his spiritual resources.
This, again, leads to the consideration of the vis
medicatrix. A great deal has been said and written,
and absurdly too, on this inherent power of nature,
by which she seeks to repair injuries which have
been effected, or to prevent others from being pro-
duced by certain changes which have taken place
in the system. The absurdity has arisen from sup-
posing the existence of a kind of archaaus, or
pre-
siding spirit, which watched over the laws,-aided
the intentions,-gave notice of the infraction of
these laws, and sought to repair the mischiefs thus
occasioned in the animal economy. The absurdity
consisted not in the facts which were adduced, but
in investing one of nature's laws with a
personality,
and making that an
entity, which is the mere deve-
lopement of a
principle. But the principle exists,
and that principle, perhaps, shows forth the wisdom,
and the power, and the goodness of the Creator,

more
conspicuously than almost any of the other
wonders of creation. This is seen ina thousand
instances, but we must only mention two or three
illustrations. ~
We will take the familiar arrangement by
which food is prevented entering the air pas-
sages. It is manifest to reason, how erroneous this
must be; and it is known from experience, that the
effect would very generally be fatal. Therefore
Nature has provided a valve, which in the act of
swallowing covers over the glottis, and effectually
prevents any food from entering the trachea. This,
then, is Nature's conservative arrangement; but
suppose that, contrary to her intentions, the indivi-
dual breathes while in the act of swallowing, such
breathing lifts the epiglottis; the closure of the
glottis is no
longer complete ; some minute portion
of food enters that aperture, or
perhaps only rests
upon its edge; a morbid condition has been pro-
duced: but Nature's conservative power is again
called in to repair the mischief, and as
everybody
knows, violent cough is produced for the purpose
of expelling the intruding molecule, nor is peace
re-established till such expulsion has been effected.
An attentive observer will also discover how imme-
diately a secretion of mucus takes placed from the
inner lining of the trachea, to assist in dislodging
the foreign body.
The act of sneezing may be mentioned as another
conservative effort, intended to remove from the first
air-passages any substance which might prove irrita-
ting or deleterious to them. Coughing should, and al-

ways would be (ifthe patient were careful and watch-
ful) only another instance of the conservative power of
Nature ; it should be only for the purpose of bring-
ing up from the chest or
wiudpipe, that which was
oppressing and impeding its functions. Hunger,
thirst, and other instinctive properties, are
only
illustrations of this conservative power, and tend to
keep the body from injury. The same effect is seen
as a
consequence of any accidental lzesion, as in the
event of a wound, a fracture, or dislocation : in the
former, the first effort is to unite the divided parts
by an adhesive process, and at once to restore them
to continuity; and where this cannot be effected,
to accomplish the same
object by the formation of
granulations, and then tiling over these with fresh
skin from the edges of the divided surface. In the
case of fracture, a soft medium of re-union is first
poured out-in this, bony matter is deposited, and
the limb is stronger than ever. In dislocation, the
muscles will pull back the bone into its place, if
they can, or if assisted by favouring circumstances,
the olgject of the surgeon; and if they cannot effect
this restoration, Nature will form a new socket for
the joint, and do her very utmost to repair the mis-
chief. And in the event of the death of a bone,
she is ever fertile in her resources, and pours out
such a
quantity of new
living bone around the
dead portion, as to preserve the continuity and
strength of the limb, while she is effecting the ex-
pulsion of the old dead bone.

stances, but we shall only give one more illustra-

tion; and that respects the different habits of
serous and mucous membranes. The habit of the
former is, under circumstances of irritation, to pour
out coagulating lymph, which becomes organised,
and glues together the contiguous surfaces; while
the habit of the latter is to pour out a secretion of
mucus, which does not become organised, but is
removed. Now the effect of this law is visible, for
instance, in the external and internal covering of
the bowel; the former is a serous, the latter a
mucous membrane; and according to the present
arrangement, all goes on well ; but supposing these
habits to be changed-the mucous membrane
pouring out coagulating lymph, and glueing to-
gether the two sides of the cylinder of the bowel,
what follows but irrecoverable obstruction and
death; or, on the other side, a
large quantity of
mucus, or 'even purulent matter is poured out in
the cavity of the abdomen, and death equally
ensues.
Try the same
exchange of function in
the chest; the external covering of the lungs is a
serous, the bronchial, or internal covering is a
mucous membrane. Now, all is well, and under
inflammatory action there is a
good chance of
recovery; but reverse the fact, and the cells of the
lungs, the air-cells, are
largely glued together; or
a sudden muco-puriform effusion takes place into
the cavity of the chest, and death equally follows
in both cases. The same observation may be made
of the brain, and other very important organs.
But suppose, under circumstances of inflamma-
tion, that suppuration becomes inevitable, still we

see
beautifully exemplified, the conservative power
of nature; for aware how destructive must be the
diffusion of pus among the cells of the cellular
membrane, constituting, in fact, one of the most
formidable cases of morbid action, what is her
object? Why, before the formation of purulent
matter, she pours out a considerable quantity of
coagulatinglymph-glues together a certain number
of cells-forms a wall all around the abscess, and
then, when it must break, always takes care that it
should break upon the surface, and not in the in-
terior; at least, the deviations from this process
are
only exceptions to the general rule.
From all these illustrations it will be seen, that
there is no Archaeus, watching over, and directing
Nature's operations ; nay, more, that the presiding
mind has nothing to do with this agency; that it
is purely physical-one of the primordial laws for
preserving existence, everywhere visible in the
animal economy, adapted by Infinite Wisdom to
the variety of structure and formation-to the uses
and abuses of the several organs of the body. This
law, as it affects the manifestations of mind, is also
to be traced; and Nature's sweet restorer, sleep, is
a beautiful illustration of the care which she has
taken of the organ of mind. The brain may be-
come
jaded; it is relieved by change of employ-
ment; but it may be worn out; its energies may
be exhausted beyond the power of change to re-
novate; and then comes sleep, only a
very small
portion of which is necessary to give renewed activity
to the organ. And this state, too, becomes irre-

sistible; its claims will be heard; and the indi-
vidual goes to sleep, stancling, walleing, talking, Sac.,
unless a state of morbid irritability and vigilance
has been induced, which is sometimes the case.
But then disorder has commenced; and all the
frightful progeny of perverted mental manifestation
may be brooded over with fostering wing, and
nurtured into life and activity; unless, by the judi-
cious employment of mental and bodily means, the
irritated brain shall be appeased, and quiet sleep
shall be procured.
There is a state arising from over-goaded brain,
which may be called toqaor, and which produces
an effect the reverse of irritability. In the one
case, there is a
busy and restless desire after action ;
in the other rest, absolute rest, seems to be the
great good of existence ; in the one case, the mind
is wandering after fresh objects of excitement; in
the other, nothing annoys it so much as to be
aroused into action at all. The effect is a dif-
ferent one; but the same result of perverted mental
manifestation, tinged by the state of the mani-
festing organ, will be induced.
A very few words must be given on the subject
of the influence of atmospherical changes. That
this influence is very considerable, is well known ;
but the mode in which it operates is often ob-
scure. It may, however, be directly through the
influence of certain conditions of the air upon the
nervous
system itself; or
indirectly, through the
influence excited upon the circulating system; or
the digestive function; or still further by _containing

548 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
certain noxious properties which operate unseen, and
which, without occasioning positive disease, do
nevertheless interfere with the healthful actions of
the economy.
There are some
properties of the atmosphere
which appear to act directly upon the nervous
system; as, for instance, in the east wind an influ-
ence is produced, which is not to be accounted for
wholly by its dryness. It is confessedly a
drying
wind; and we cannot breathe in comfort an at-
mosphere which does not possess a certain degree
of moisture: but there are few persons who have
not experienced a nameless malazlse, on the imme-
diate setting in of an east wind; a dulness, a
gloom, a tedium, a discomfort, an
inaptitude for
cerebral exertion; while, on the contrary, after the
blowing of the south-west wind, all these clouds
have been dissipated-life has been enjoyed-a
certain degree of elasticity has rendered all the
ideas buoyant and cheerful-and diiiiculties have
been met and vanquished, under which the mind
would otherwise have been 'borne down; and efforts
have been made, which could not previously have
been sustained; thought has been easy--labour an
enjoyment-and success has attended every literary
effort: and all this has been irrespective of the
amount of atmospherical dryness or
humidity-
supposing them to have been the same in both
cases, and in spite of the increased pressure on the
one hand, and the diminished pressure on the other,
which always, or almost always, attend inter-
changeably the east and the south-west winds.

Here, then, is an
example of atmospherical influ-
ence
upon the nervous
system. The -author has
known persons of highly sensitive nerves, in whom
these atmospherical vicissitudes would operate a
change in the feelings several times in the day,
and who could often predict changes from their
bodily sensations which were not otherwise cog-
nisable.
The increased or diminished pressure of the
atmosphere will likewise operate upon the cir-
culating system; and so, indirectly as well as»-di-
rectly, upon the brain. The venous circulation
of the body is mainly dependent upon the pressure
of the atmosphere for its continuance and well-
being; and a certain amount of pressure is neces-
sary to
ordinary comfort; if that pressure be too
great, the blood may be returned too quickly to
the heart, and that organ may be oppressed, by
the increased demand upon its exertions; and if
the pressure be diminished, the venous circulation
will become sluggish; congestion will occur in the
larger veins; and the right side of the heart will
be rendered uneasy-unable fully to disburthen
itself of its load; the same effect takes place in
the venous sinuscs of the brain ; the latter organ
is supplied with a less highly vitalized blood than
it requires; and languor, and feebleness, and dis-
order are introduced into its functions; besides
also, that the brain itself seems to require a certain
degree of pressure in order to carry on its intellec-
tual functions with ease. This is more
fully ex-
emplified by the effect of a
highly ratified at-

mosphere upon the circulation_the consequent
bursting of the blood-vessels, and the disorder
introduced into the cerebral functions. Though
these are not felt under ordinary circumstances,
in the same
way as at the summit of Mont Blanc,
still they are felt, and produce similar influences,
though less in degree.
The dampness or
dryness of the atmosphere will
operate peculiarly upon the mucous membranes
of the body, as the skin, the lungs, the throat,
the~ stomach, the bowels. In either case, great
discomfort is produced; if there be too great dry-
ness, the skin is patched-respiration is uneasy-
--digestion is difiicult-the bowels are constipated ;
and, on the contrary, if there be an excess of mois-
ture, the skin is relaxed--the lungs are_ oppressed
-digestion is imperfectly performed-the bowels
are worried-and the general system feels feeble
and languid; and through this channel, the cir-
culation of the blood is altered-nutrition is im-
paired-nervous expenditure exceeds the supply-
and the brain seems
inadequate to its mental efforts.
Now, though we cannot alter the qualities of the
atmosphere, we
may guard against its morbid im-
pression; and from what has been written, many
useful hints may be gathered with regard to
clothing, the temperature of rooms, their relative
dryness or
dampness, exercise, food, &c. In
respect of temperature, it should be mentioned,
that heat exhausts, while cold accumulates nervous
irritability; and the object is to
prevent an excess
of either the one or the other state; for if nervous

energy be exhausted, the brain is enfeebled; and
if too much accumulated, it loses its elasticity, and
is unable to employ what it possesses; torpor is
produced from this "
embarras des richesses ;" and
this sensorial torpor may not only interfere with
the cerebral processes, but may even destroy life.
From all this it will be seen, how largely these
varying conditions of the atmosphere may, nay,
more, must operate upon the manifestations ofmind ;
the manifesting organ cannot be thus interfered
with, without producing a
great influence upon its
function-not only with regard to the comfort, but
the brilliance and correctness of impression-the
power of attention, memory, association, reasoning,
judgment, all of which may be more or less as-
sisted or
perverted by these variations. In addition
to all these, there is oftentimes a hidden state which
we know not how to explain, and which escapes
the researches of the experimental chemist. The
air of the crowded city and of the country; that of
the mountain and the valley; that of the purest
character, and that which is loaded with malaria,
does not differ materially in its eudiometrical pro-
portions. Yet it does so to the sensations; we are
conscious of the difference; the first air passages
inform us of the change ; they are the conservative
sentinels of the body. And we have reason to
believe, that while there are these great differences
(though in the present state of our
knowledge,
chemically imperceptible) as to the production of
health or disorder, there exist also yet minor dif-
ferences which are
very essential to the comfort

552 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
and well-being of many of the functions of the
body, but particularly of the cerebral organ, and
of its peculiar functions, the infinitely diversified
manifestations of mind. .
In our own climate, where the vicissitudes are
so
great, we are not so much called upon to watch
against extremes, which are rare, but against the
frequent variations. And although the constitution
becomes, by habit, greatly inured to climate; and
although there seems to be always, and every-
where, a sort of relation between the one and the
other; yet, notwithstanding these two modifying
circumstances, the transitions are so
great and so
frequent, as oftentimes to overturn the harmony of
the system, and to produce uneasy or
perverted
mental manifestations. The absence of sun_the
clouds, and fogs, and damps, and gloom of our
climate, have been unjustly accused of producing
tl1e number of suicides which we have unhappily
so
frequently to chronicle. And again, this is not
true; for although our
proportion of suicides does
not exceed that of our
neighbours, whose climate
is exempted from these peculiarities ; yet there can
be no
question, that it does exert a considerable
influence upon tl1e brain, upon the manifestations
of mind, and therefore upon national character.
We would not push this remark too far; it is
enough for our
purpose, that the climate exerts an
influence upon the manifesting organ; and if so,
necessarily also, upon its manifestations.
There is a
something peculiarly injurious, also,
in the mode by which the impression of the atmo-

sphere is received, though it may be the same
atmosphere. In the open air, all will be well,
but received through an
aperture, by which a
current is produced, cold will be quickly caught;
the impression will be immediately felt by the
sensorium; the function of the brain, which has
been carried on well to this moment, becomes
almost instantly beclouded; listlessness creeps over
the frame; dulness and stupidity of thought follow
in its train; intellectual occupation becomes a
burden ; a morbid condition has been occasioned;
and both body and mind suffer from its influence.
A few words on the changes of opinion, which
seem to take place during the course of life, will
lead to the concluding part of the subject. By
this we intend not those violent and rapid
changes which TRANSMUTE character, and which
are
dependent upon some
powerful conviction sud-
denly or
gradually wrought upon the mind. These
may be considered as
spiritual or mental changes
generally effected through some
very powerful
impulse, motive, or emotion, brought before the
mind at a time when it has been prepared by cir-
cumstances or events, to receive such impression,
and to yield obedience to its impulses. This is
remarkably the case with the careless man of the
world, whose heart has been prepared by the Spirit
of God-perhaps through the_agency of sickness
or sorrow, or some other influence which has com-
rhanded attention-to listen, and to receive the
truths which are
necessary to 'eternal peace; and
then there is a
gradual awakening of the attention

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
to moral and religious motive; or less frequently,
conviction flashes deeply upon the mind, and the
individual instantly turns to God with,
"
Vhat
shall I do to be saved Y" These instances of sudden
conversion are not to be lightly esteemed; doubt-
less they do exist; and if followed by a beautiful
consistency of character, they are deserving of the
highest estimation.
The same thing is to be traced in a case of
much less importance, viz. political conversion.
Alas ! for human nature ; deeply regretted is to be
the fact, that this is too often the consequence of
interested _motive; and the frequency of this dis-
honesty has thrown an air of doubt over the sin-
cerity of all these conversions. And yet nothing
can be more
likely, than that an individual who
has been educated in the trammels of party, and
accustomed to go with that party-to think with
the same
thoughts, and to act, and to believe, and
judge, as his party acts, and judges, and believes ;
it is not otherwise than perfectly feasible, that such
an individual should take alarm at the tendency
to evil of some one of its dogmas,-should be scared
on the brink of the precipice over which he sud~
denly finds himself beetling, and should become
anxious to quit for ever the ranks of that party
which had brought him to so terrible a dilemma;
and under these circumstances there would be a
fair and genuine change of opinion. As in all
other changes of views upon important subjects,
the individual very generally becomes a
bigot,-
exclusively attached to his new opinions, and giving

little toleration to others; a result very much to
be deprecated, especially as these impulsive changes,
though taking place with the best of motives, do
often arise from error in judgment, or some
hasty
prejudice :i and more
especially as they always give
rise to the appearance of what is too frequently the
fact, that the change has been effected by new
views [of aggrandisement, or new channels opened
to interested ambition, and therefore possessing a
sordid origin. But confessedly great as is this evil,
and still greater liability to mistake and misre-
presentation; that would be a
yet greater evil,
which holds the individuals whose opinions have
been really and conscientiously changed, spell-
bound within the precincts of party ; and not
having moral courage enough to avow that change,
and to meet the obloquy which would be the natural
consequence of such avowal.
These, however, are not the changes we contem-
plate, when we speak of that which results from
bodily influence upon the manifestations of mind.
This is a
commonly received opinion, although, per-
haps, if broadly stated, it might not obtain general
acceptation in theory. Yet the germ of this opi-
nion is to be found in experience; and the fact,
that you cannot put old heads upon young shoul-
ders; that the old and the young cannot live to-
gether, on account of their dissimilar habits of
thought and action; all tend to prove that changes
of opinion do occur, as
the natural result of ad-
vancing years. Every one who attends to his own
mental operations will have discovered this change

556 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
in himself; will have found that the views of twenty
were much modified at thirty,-those of thirty at
forty-those of forty at fifty, and so on as
years
advance. It may be said, that these changes are
the result of experience; and so in many instances
they are; the folly and étourderie of youth, give
place to the sobriety and judgment of manhood,
and the views become more mature with advancing
years. But upon what does e:cpe1'ie1we act? Does
it not consist in a series of impressions made, and

mind itself may be operated upon by mental or
spiritual motives, we also contend, that the mani-
festations of mind may be, and always are
operated
upon, by changes in the manifesting organ; and
that these changes are
constantly going on, though
they be not such, as to interfere with the conscious-
ness of personal identity.
In looking at this subject, the complexity of the
organ operated upon by physical causes from with-
out, and by spiritual causes from within, must not
be forgotten. Everybody knows, that change and
renovation are
going on all over the system. The
brain is not an
unique exemption from these causes
of change, though they operate slowly. We have
reason to believe, that not a
single particle of the
brain of the present individual belonged to him
ten years ago; yet the sentiment of identity has

to fibre; the loss of substance has never been dis-
covered, because at any one time, it has been so
small as to be imperceptible; and memory of the
past, which would have been obliterated, if it de-
pended simply on
impressions made upon cerebral
fibre-to be retained by cerebral fibre only, has
been preserved by the grand regulator of the mani-
festing organ, even by presiding mind, and this
solution clears away every diiiiculty.
Changes of opinion, then, may be suhdivitled
into-
a. Natural and healthful.
b. Organic.
c. Morbid.
a. We enter first upon the natural or healthful
changes of opinion. These are the result of aug-
mented knowledge, juster views, sounder reason-
ing, more accurate judgment; accumulated ob-
servation, greater wisdom, and more
enlarged
inferences drawn from the mass of facts brought
together by experience. That the intellectual
faculties should be perfected by habit; that intel-
lectual man should be benefited by experience;
that he should learn caution from previous hasty
judgment; that he should be rendered more
circumspect by former errors and failures; and
especially that for the future he should be in-
structed by the results of the past,-by previous
circumstances and events with which he could not
have been acquainted in his early rl ,priori reason-
ings; and, moreover, that time should have deve-

loped tendencies and contingencies which could
not have been procured by any ordinary foresight,
and which perhaps had been studiously concealed;
and, therefore, that he should have become more
apt to investigate, and less prone to judge; these
are, or
ought to be, the result of having the senses
exercised to discern both good and evil ; and from
these result those changes of opinion, which are
here called healthful, and which man is accus-
tomed to value, and to fix upon them that stamp
of maturit_y, which is precisely opposed to the im-
maturity, the credulity, the narrowness, of the
thoughts of the inexperienced young man.
In saying thus much, we would enter a caveat
against that system of vacillation which we per-
ceive marking the character of some otherwise
estimable individuals. It is impossible to ascer-
tain their opinions, for they change with the daily
shifting of the puppets which surround them ; they
take the shape of their immediate society, and the
impress of external circumstances; they distrust
themselves, and under the apprehension that their
own
judgment may be incorrect, they throw them-
selves upon the judgment of others, and are thus
induced to take the mould of the last society into
which they were thrown: a state which arises
sometimes from difhdence, at others from the
want of moral courage to avow their opinions, if
different from their neighbours; at others, from
a
self-complacent desire to be like other persons;
again, from the want of having very defined views
as to the boundaries between right and wrong;

and, lastly, from a selfish desire to be thought as
good, as wise, as
happy as those around them.
Now while it is a
great evil to be thus unsettled
in opinion, and while it is very desirable to possess
clear, distinct, and well-defined views, it is not to
be forgotten that the opposite of error is not
always truth,-the antipodes to vice not neces-
sarily virtue,-and that the opposite to vacillation
is not pertinacious adherence to opinions once
formed. Prejudice, bigotry, an obstinate and
unchanging attachment to opinions ouce imbibed,
and which shall not be subsequently modified by
new and enlarged views, and more accurate rea-
sonings, are to be avoided as much as
perpetual
change. The individual who draws around him
the self-complacent pauoply of a belief in his own
concentrated wisdom, and refuses to alter an
opinion which he once believed to be correct, is
in danger of falling into the grossest errors, and
of exhibiting the unholy example of a man arro-
gating to himself attributes which belong exclu-
sively to the supreme fountain of wisdom and
immutability. Now, even with the most high God,
infinite wisdom must precede unchanging judg-
ment; and the presence of the latter is perfectly
inconsistent with the absence of the former; and
since it is readily confessed that man is not thus
infinitely wise, (on the contrary, that his acquaint-
ance is perfect with not}zing,) it is most absurd that
he should plume himself upon that consistency of
opinion and judgment, which absolutely does not
admit rqiection or review.

560 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
,b. But we
pass on to notice those changes of
opinion which may be termed organic. Every
person who has watched these changes in himself,
and who has looked abroad at the same
process in
others, must possess an entire conviction that this
change is operated independently of the mental
changes we have contemplated; and that the
powers, and habits, and modes of thought, and
feeling, and action, do vary much with certain
changes which are
produced in the organ of
thought. Thus, the mode of receiving impres-
sions-the perception of these impressions-the
ideas to which they give rise-reasoning upon
them-reflection -combination -
comparison -in-
ference-results-are all drawn diH`ercntly, accord-
ing to the maturity and perfectness of the organ.
And this is independent of increased knowledge,
or accumulated wisdom; for the brain of twenty,
which has had large opportunities of observation,
and of acquiring knowledge, (though perhaps
being much to be preferred before the brain of
thirty, equally cultivated, but where the oppor-
tunities of observation, thought, and reflection,
have been small,) will never
possess the same
style
of thought, will never arrive at the same set of
conclusions, or of opinions formed upon them.
The young and the old, the educated and the un-
educated, the healthful and the sickly, the san-
guine and the melancholic, theicholeric and the
nervous, can no more travel at the same intel-
lectual rate, occupy the same intellectual sphere of
vision, or fix their attention upon the same intel-

lectual points of aflinity, than any other utter
impossibility can be brought to pass.
The common remark, that the evening and
the morning story difer, is a
proof of how widely
this agency is diffused; and how great is the
operation of exhaustion or refreshment upon the
brain, in the formation of opinion. The accumu-
lation of nervous
energy upon the stomach in
digestion, and its being thus diverted from the
brain, leaves the latter organ enfeebled for its
intellectual functions; its energies are lessened its
capacities circumscribed; cold and heat operate
conversely in affecting its manifestations; all the
slighter indispositions, a
slight cold, even
fatigue
of muscle, much more fatigue of the organ itself,
will impair the power, pervert the agency, and
alter the results of cerebral operation. These,
again, will operate very differently at different
periods of life, always taking the shape of the
physical characteristics of the system, and to be
predicated, by knowing these characteristics and
the prevailing temperament. And then, as age
advances, and infirmities creep on, opinion becomes
weak and vacillating, or obstinate and unchanging,
according to the mental prevalence of self-love on
the one hand, or of difiidence and distrust on the
other ; both causes operating upon a cerebral fibre,
less and less capable of those powerful demon-
strations which marked the zenith of its power, the
sunshine of its maturity.

opinion which may be termed morbid; always in-

562 THE Rnclrnocu. INFLUENCE
tending by this term, not those which are affected
by moral, but by physical causes. The great dis-
order of' the soul or
spirit is sin-moral evil, which
is only to be prevented by the grace of God, and
only to be cured by the influence of religion; but
this is not the class of morbid actions with which
we have to deal ; our attention is confined to those
morbid manifestations of' mind which are
depen-
dent upon physical causes; and perhaps these per-
versions may be all summed up into one of the
varying forms of insanity.
A question may here be stated as to those errors
in judgment which are not purely spiritual, which
do not arise from lack of information, nor from
carelessness and inattention in the employment of
such information; which are
clearly not the result
of insanity, but seem to arise from placing the
object to be contemplated in a wrong point of'
view; so that all the lines drawn from it, and all
the opinions running upon such lines are erroneous,
proceed from false premises, and lead to wrong
conclusions: the entire views formed during this
process being erroneous. Now, after much con-
sideration, we are
disposed to believe that this
state arises from a
peculiar condition of the cere-
bral organ, in which it is liable to a minor degree
of perversity, not amounting to insanity, but pro-
ducing incorrect results; just as
any temporary
pressure which produces an alteration in the axis
of vision will occasion defective sight; and al-
though the effect be so
slight, and so transient as
to occasion no
permanent influence upon the organ,

no
pahnable change in its condition, or functions, or
structure.
But the greater number of instances of morbid
manifestation of mind, of perverse formation of
opinion, which are not dependent upon moral
causes, are
really and intrinsically attached to in-
sanity, in some of its varieties. This, perhaps,
may be considered as a
very sweeping conclusion,
and requiring some explanation, in order to pre-
vent misconception of the terms, and the mode of
their employment. By the term insanity or insane,
we do not simply mean to express the idea of a
person who is unfit for society-who is an
object of
fear-who requires a
special attendant, and medical
superintendence; neither do we intend an indivi-
dual who differs from ourselves in opinion, and
entertains views which we think strange and
groundless, as if the right to exclusive correctness
of thought attached to ourselves; neither do we
intend that peculiarity of thought and action, which
attaches to individuality of character; neither those
legitimate changes of opinion, which are
produced
by juster thoughts and lengthened experience : but
we intend those manifestations of mind, which,
without adequate cause of change, are at variance
with the individuals former self; a sudden perver-
sion of character, which throws an air of strangeness
over the whole mental fabric; a
perversity of
thought and feeling, which needlessly gives undue
prominence to certain points; an
inaccessibility to
reason and conviction ; and the formation of
opinions without reason, which are strange, gro-

tesque, inconsequent-at variance with common
sense, and especially opposed to the views and
opinions of bye-gone days; a state, in fact, which
borders upon the very verge of that fearful preci-
pice into which intellectual man falls, through the
dark and easy descent of dreams, visions, voices,
revelations, hallucinations, mania, and all the
fearful category of mental alienation.
We conclude our present design by some re-
marks on the influence of the body, or
physical
temperament, upon thc expression of religious feel-
ing.
It cannot have escaped the notice of every atten-
tive observer of mankind, that not only is there
much difference in the mode of expression of reli-
gious feeling among Christians generally; but also
that this expression is in a considerable degree
characterized by physical temperament, and by
other analogous circumstances, as disease, exhaus-
tion, debility, &c. Unhappily for the peace and
harmony of the christian world, this source of dif-
ference of opinion has not been sufiiciently weighed ;
and that has been too frequently attached to moral
delinquency, which really belonged to physical
obliquity; and hence have arisen fierce contests about
comparative trifles, which have been elevated into
undue prominence and importance-by the warmth,
perhaps, of the unduly zealous but sanguine advo-
cate, contrasted with the cold and dogged inflexi-
bility of the sincere but plzlegmatic opponent. The
two cannot receive the same
impressions from look-
ing at the same object, because the intellectual rays

which are
given off by that object, pass to the mind
through very differently characterized media, and
are
very differently refracted in their course. The
great misfortune is, that Christians do not exercise
towards each other that charitable feeling for phy-
sical infirmity, which they are so abundantly willing
to extend towards themselves: and that while they
make every possible excuse for their own
hasty
judgments, crude opinions, injustice, irritable
temper, peevishness, discontent, and a thousand
other more
deeply-shaded moral evils, on account
of their natural propensities--of their being taken
off their guard-of their being overtaken by temp-
tation in a moment of unwatchfulness-of their
easily besetting sin-of their fatigue and exhaus-
tion-of their bad digestion, &c., they do not
admit any of these excuses for intellectual obliguity
of vision, which they so
readily grant to the for-
getfulness of practical morality. And yet surely
the one deserves at least as much consideration as
the other; and inasmuch as intellectual brain is
of higher worth than merely animal brain, it ought
to be conceded that the former possesses a
greater
number of points of easy disturbance; and that,
when disturbed, it deserves a more charitable con-
sideration for its deviations from rectitude, be-
cause, in the instance of animal passion, there
remains the intellectual brain to assist in guiding
or repelling its errors; while in the latter case, the
immediate organ of communication with presiding
mind, is arrested in its healthy action, and is very
diflicultly capable of carrying on its normal func-

tions; and it' is for this reason
chiefly, and in the
hope of securing juster views on
many points,
and a more
expansive charity in all, that we shall
consider this subject a little in detail, and attempt
to trace some of its more remarkable results.
Such is the extensive influence of deeply-rooted
prejudice on this subject; and so
fondly do men
cling to modes of thought and action, which have
been rendered sacred by time and custom, that it is
diflicult to secure a candid and unprejudiced at-
tention, even to truth, when it is propounded in a
new light; and especially when it leads to the
all-important conclusion, that religion consists in
the service of the head as well as in the feeling of
the heart .'
It is probable, that the severance of these two
propositions, which ought always to be conjoined,
according to the individual measure of the intellec-
tual and affective faculties, has oftentimes been
occasioned by some influence of bodily tempera-
ment. Certain it is, that that peculiar expression
of religious feeling, which consists in a
species of
quietism-a resting in the belief of being only a
passive agent in the hands of Providence--of
having every event of life, and feeling of the heart
arranged by Divine appointment-of having every
sentiment prompted by Divine influence-of having
nothing to do, but to wait the exposition of events
-possessing neither will nor
power to act or coun-
teract-but of having every power of the body,
and every manifestation of mind, taken from the
control of the individual, and passively left to an

unrecognized spiritual influence; certain it is, that
this character of religionist is always to be found
in one peculiar form of the melancholic tempera-
ment. And it is equally certain, that the opposite
extreme-the religion of the lwad-that religion
in which the affective faculties bear no
part, and
the heart is really untouched-which consists in
a
great display, and outward show of regard for
its influence-of contention for its doctrines-of
bustling and overweening activity in many of its
practical duties-which courts and invites the gaze
and the approbation of the many-which seeks to
talk much of its doctrines, but to know little of
its precepts-which is ever shaping itself to the
temper of the society into which it is thrown-
which contends for the exterior decorations of re-
ligion, but knows nothing of its internal beautifully
harmonising influence on all the thoughts and
feelings and actions, is equally to be found in one
peculiar form of the choleric temperament.
These forms require blending in order to be per-
fected. It is certain that man can do nothing of
himself, except the power be given him to will and
to do ; but it is equally certain, that he must exert
himself to carry out the will of Divine Providence,
and to act in obedience to the Divine laws; and
without this moral accountability is destroyed, as
we have previously seen.
It is not asserted, that these two forms of error
are
always the result of the prevalence of the me-
lancholic or choleric temperament. Far from it;
on the contrary, it is readily conceded that they

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
may result entirely from mental causes ; all that is
contended for, is, that a
predisposition to these
several views exists in certain physical tempera-
ments; that they will be found to predominate in
those temperaments; and that in them will be
almost always, if not always, the germ of such
views. unless they have been counteracted by edu-
cation, and by the implantation of juster and more
expanded opinions of the Divine economy. Every
religionist who adopts either of these peculiarities
is not melancholic or choleric; but every melan-
cholic or choleric temperament will exhibit traces
of their influence ; therefore the expression of their
views is influenced by physical temperament.
Now, although it is very generally admitted that
mind and body act and re-act upon each other, yet
perhaps very few are
prepared to allow the truth
of the propositions above laid down; very few,
indeed, have considered this state of dependence
of the manifestations of mind upon the peculiarities
of the body; and fewer still have thought of what
is involved in the terms of the announced truth,
or have contemplated the extent to which the prin-
ciple may be applied.
It would be allowed that mind and body
"
act
and re-act upon each other," as a
general proposi-
tion, by many who would deny this agency when
reduced to particulars. Thus it would be allowed
to pass current as a
general truth, by many who
would reject the fact, that any given state of mental
or
spiritual manifestation has been influenced by
the condition of the organ of mind at the time or

by the peculiarity of temperament enstamped upon
it from its origin.
What, then, is intended by those who admit the
general proposition ? It should seem that it amounts
simply to this, that if the body be disordered, the
mind will be enfeebled or irritated, or
incapacitated
for its functions; and that mental impression is
capable of disordering the body, disturbing the
digestion, and in extreme cases of impairing its
vitality.
But it must be allowed that the whole mind is
composed of a
variety of functions-as the whole
body is composed of a
variety of organs; and it is
not illogical to infer, that these several functions
may be more or less disturbed, as well as that one
organ of the body may sometimes suffer without
the whole body being involved in that suffering;
nay, more, it is highly probable, that one or more
of these functions will suffer in proportion to
their sympathy or connexion with the primary
irritating cause. And as in both cases the whole
is composed of parts, although forming, when
united, one whole, it is most
inconsequential to
infer, that the whole 'must suffer in either case,
without producing a
greater effect upon some
part
than upon another.
And again, it is necessary to inquire lzow the
admitted general effect is produced? How the body
is disturbed by mental emotion! How the mind
is disordered by the indisposition of the body?
How the sympathy of action and re-action is main-
tained? Upon this as a fact, there will be no

570 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
difference of opinion ; and it will be readily granted
by all, that this is accomplished by nervous com-
munication. But all nerves have not the same
function ; therefore their direct and reflex actions
cannot all be of the same kind. They carry on
different functions according to the organs to which
they are distributed ; the nerves of the senses can-
not act
interchangeably; those which are con-
cerned in the different secretions of the body would
be useless unless distributed to their respective
organs; and tl1e nerves of voluntary motion could
not carry on the functions of secretion all over the
body, or of expression in the countenance. Then
it must be allowed that each nerve has a different
ofiice, makes a different impression upon the
common centre of sensation, according to the organ
to which it is distributed, or the work for which it
is intended. And if this be granted, it follows,
in a morbid condition, that each nerve, when it
becomes the carrier of morbid action makes an
impression upon the common centre, peculiar to
itscm as well as that general distorting agency which
has already been granted. And if so, not only
must the proposition of confining this influence to
a
general nervous
agency be given up, but it also
follows, that each irritated nerve of the body may
produce a
special irritation of the organ of mind,
and therefore may give rise to peculiar mental
manifestations; and, on the other side, any emo-
tions, and feelings, and thoughts, and actions, may
give rise to very varying effects upon the body,
according to its predisposition to malady, and

according to its original tendencies,-in other words,
according to its physical temperament.
The degree in which this eH`ect will be occasioned,
will differ greatly according to the mental calibre
first given-according to the degree ofits cultivation
-according to the education and associations of
the individual-according to the direction of his
studies-according to his physical habits, and es-
pecially whether they have been self-denying or
self-indulgent-whether he have made body or
mind the supreme object of his attention ; whether
he has been accustomed to follow the suggestions
of body and mind blindly and implicitly, or whe-
ther he has been habituated always to refer action
to reason and to principle as its groundwork;
according as the body shall be generally healthy,
or shall much more
probably possess some feeble
organ; and according to a thousand other circum-
stances, extending into ramifications too minute
to be followed, but embracing every department
of vital agency. Still, however greatly this influence
may vary in degree, it is only in degree ; for the
agency is u-niversal, and is to be found wherever
mind and body co-exist, and is extensive in pro-
portion to the perfectness of both. This being
satisfactorily established, we
may be prepared to
admit the somewhat startling proposition, that de-
votional fervour or depression may sometimes be
more
rationally accounted for, by a reference to
the state of the brain than of the mind, (the pre-
siding soul,) and this without involving the dan-
gerous innovation of making a man's religious

condition depend upon his organisation, which we
have before shown to be destructive of moral ob-
ligation, and therefore abhorrent to the genuine
Christian.
It is not religion itself, or the duties which flow
from it-nor its doctrines and principles-its mo-
tives-its precepts--its sanctions, which can in any
degree be influenced by any physical condition of
its professors ; those hopes, and fears, and prospects,
which are the legitimate offspring of religion, are
unchangeable, because their Author is immutable,
and they are the result of His revealed will, and

_joys and sorrows which arise from its infiuence;
and all the manifestations J mind which constitute
religious character, as it is met with in the world,
mag be, and doubtless are, characterized in passing
through the medium which gives them utterance ;
precisely in the same
way, as the self-same stirring
event, which has been witnessed by half a dozen
persons, will be differently narrated by each, ac-
cording as his feelings have been interested, and
as the peculia1°ity of his' physical temperament
has led him to give the preponderance to one or
other of the series of phenomena of which it is com-
posed. Ve ought not to expect MORE

subject of the highest interest,
and which makes the liveliest appeals to thefeelings ;
which, therefore, is influenced in its expression by
the capacity of the intellect, and the warmth and
prevailing character of the emotions; and, indeed,
to assert that in this matter of the highest moment,

man was
independent of his temperament, and of
other external circumstances, would be to plunge
the correct thinker into a
labyrinth of difficulty,
which would terminate either in the torrid meridian
of enthusiasm, or in the chilly night of the gloomiest
scepticism.
The following observations will, we trust, demon-
strate the truth of this proposition.
First, there is a
unity and simplicity in the
spirit of man; that immortal principle of whose
essence we are ignorant, but which as it is not an
attribute of organisation, and is essentially distinct
from it; as it is the appointed medium of communi-
cation between man and his Ma/cer; and as it is
destined to survive the wreck of the beautiful but
frail tenement it inhabits, must be something essen-
tially distinct from matter. It is the gift of God,
and that which distinguishes man as
possessing
the image of God ; hence, we believe that it ema-
nates from God, and will return to Him who gave
it; consequently, that it is single in its nature
immaterial, indivisible, immortal; and although
mysteriously united to the body, does not derive
7
from it any of its characteristic properties. There
is, except in minds perverted by philosophy falsely
so called, an eternal consciousness of existence,-a
knowledge of individual accountability, and a con-
viction that to itse% as
supreme, the several func-
tions, appetites, and passions, are subservient, and
receive the laws appointed by the supreme moral
Governor for their subjection. Hence man I5 a

responsible agent, and will be justly called to ac-
count for the deeds done in the body.
But while this principle is established, it is
equally clear, that every man has a
peculiar mode
of speaking, and thinking, and writing, and acting.
The same causes
produce very opposite effects upon
different individuals, and even
upon the same
person, under varying external circumstances; there
is also a
peculiarity about the manner of each,
which constitutes the man, which pervades every
part of his intellectual and moral functions, and
which preserves his identity through every outward
change. This peculiarity may be modgied by
disease or
by powerful mental impressions; yet it
will always attach to, and serve to distinguish, one
individual from others of his kind-nay, more, it
will be handed down from generation to genera-
tion; it will be traceable, anterior to education,
and will survive its influence; it may be suspended
by some
great physical disaster, but will be resumed
in proportion as that is remedied. And what does
all this prove, but that the immortal spirit, though
unchanged by its union with the body, has its ma-
nifestations characterised by the physical attributes
of the medium through which they are exhibited.
That this is really only following out one of
Nature's laws, there can be no
question; the only
wonder is, that it should have excited so much
doubt, and such violent opposition, when applied
to the organ of mind. Let us listen to the facts
of Nature`s agency before our
eyes; take, for in-

stance, the process of grafting an
apple-tree ; it is
immaterial whether the stem be taken from the
crab or the wild plum, the fruit produced is not a
crab or a
plum, but precisely the hind of apple
which is grafted; or take a tree which has hitherto
borne pears only, and that of one hind; graft it
with half-a-dozen diferent grafts of pears, and of
apples at the same time; the result will be that
each branch so
grafted, will produce, not the original
pear of the parent stem, but the pear or the apple,
which has been grafted on that particular branch ;
and this not interchangeably, and without the
slightest liability to error. The effect is invariable ;
and what does it teach us, but that the vitality and
the juices of the parent stem are so modyied in their
passage through the peculiar vessels of each graft,
that the original pearjuice is exhibited first in a
dozen different blossoms, and finally in half-a-dozen
different kinds of pear, and as
many dissimilar
apples. Surely, then, there is nothing extraor-
dinary in carrying out and perfecting this law, in
a
higher department of Nature's ample domain.
The spirit then is one; but its apparent aspects
are
many, because they are exhibited through
material agents, differing, it may be, in their struc-
ture, as well as in their aptitude for peculiar mani-
festations or functions.
If it were
necessary to have drawn more largely
illustrations of this very simple natural process,
we
might have found it everywhere; we might
have found it in the identical basis of the diamond
and common charcoal; we
might have found it in

the endless varieties of carbonates; we
might have
found it in every kind of plant, and Hower, and
shrub, and tree-in the tallest pine as in the hum-
blest willow which creeps upon the ground, all pro-
duced from the same
simple element; we
might
have found it in man, with all his bones, muscles,
sinews, nerves, absorbents, blood-vessels, internal
viscera, with each variety of secretion, according
to the peculiar function of the secreting organ ; we
shall find it in the organs appointed for the most
important functions, respiration, digestion, alimen-
tation, &c.-we shall find it in all the organs of
sense; in fact, everywhere we shall find that all
these have one common basis, and yet that each
carries on its own function, (and in several instances
plurality of function,) without ever
interfering with
the other-the only difference being that the blood
brought to each is modified and changed by the
structure and vitality of the organ, to produce the
result which Nature designs. And why is the
brain to be excluded ? Why may not the functions
of that organ be multifolcl; and why may not its
manifestations be modified, not only by the /zeal!/1
or disorder of the organ, but by its original struc-
ture-its peculiar natural impress-its habits-its
associations-its sympathies-its vitality? It were
waste of time to support this proposition by any
further elucidations.
It is, however, necessary to insist upon a second
principle, viz. that
this agency of physical tempera-
ment can have no influence upon moral obligation ;

same; since they are communicated to man
by a
gracious revelation from on high; and since they
are of permanent and universal operation ; they .are
addressed to the conscious principle within, and
admit not of change, according to the caprices .of
every wavering creature of mortality, but abide in
their original strength, and fulness, and sobriety,
whatever may be the feebleness, the contracted
and partial views, the cold or the enthusiastic feel-
ings of those by whom they are received. In fact,
no two things can be more distinct than the holy
influence of religious principle, and the expression of
devotionalfervour: the former is uniform in its ope-
ration; the latter is subjected to the agency of
physical temperament, habit, society, and a
variety
of other extrinsic causes, which may be all classed
under the general term physical. -
From these postulates is to be drawn the infer-
ence, that the expression of religious feeling is
characterized in no small degree by physical tem-
perament, and by other circumstances arising out
of the connexion of mind with matter.
This position will be best illustrated by the ex-
ample of individuals of opposite temperaments,
under similar circumstances, as, for instance, the
highly sanguine, in whom predominate hope and
joy; and the melanclzolic, whose prevailing features
will be gloom and fear. Let the attention of each
of these individuals he jirst seriously awakened to
the truths of religion; the one will feel disposed to
lay hold on the hopes of the Gospel, and will early
reap peace and joy in believing; while the other

will be weighed down with the impression of his
sins, and will scarcely be able to realize the infinite
mercy of forgiveness. Theformer will gladly pro-
claim the change which has taken place in his
views, and will avowedly rank himself with those
who differ from all his earlier habits and modes of
thinking; the latter, with equal sincerity, and
equal reality of feeling, will seek the shade of re-
tirement; will hesitate to join himself in open
profession with those who declare plainly that they
seek another, that is a
heavenly kingdom, and per-
haps will distrust his own
consistency; and will
require the gentle hand of some kind friend to draw
the modest flower from its obscurity, that we
may
be charmed with the delicacy of its fragrance.
It can scarcely be necessary to caution the un-
wary or the captious reader against the abuse which
may be made of this physical agency, so as to
mis-represent the operations of the Holy Spirit of
God, as the author of hope, and faith, and peace,
and joy, as blended with, or
equivalent to, the
mere impulses of animal feeling, and characterized
by the varying state of that animal. It is manifest
throughout, that real religion is never confounded
with animal impulse. It is not the truth or
reality
of religious feeling; it is not its depth, nor the
extent of its practical influence; it is not the
nature of the motives, nor the degree in which
they are operative, which are
governed by the orga-
nisation ; but it is the apparent expression of such
feelings, and convictions, and motives, and ac-
tions.

or Bonv AND MIND. 579
Passing in review the more advanced life of
the two individuals above distinguished, the first
will be found foremost in all the bustling acr
tivity of charity; his purse and his personal
exertions will be at the command of the great
charitable associations of the day; and wherever
his public services may be required, there will they
be found. The latter, with no less sincerity of
attachment to the principle, will not be equally
conspicuous in the arena of public meetings, nor
among the specific agents of charity; he will
prefer the unostentatious circle of his own
neigh-
bourhood for the field of his quiet operations; he
will be found in the humble cottage of the poor;
and many an individual will have to bless his
unseen, unobtrusive, unknown exertions for the
relief of temporal calamity, as well as of moral
wants, and spiritual destitution.
So, again, as regards the influence of religion
on the affections, the one will be pursuing his
happy way in the confidence of his acceptance with
God, and in zealous devotion to His service; the
other, with not less of principle, and steady con-
sistency of conduct, will persevere in the perform-
ance of duty, and will increase in good works, but
will only humbly hope, amidst many fears, that
he may at last be found among those righteous,
which are
"
scarcely saved." The one will have
more of joy, the other of peace; in the one
hope

one will be chiefly remarkable for the active, the
other for the passive virtues; the one will court,
the other will shrink from notoriety; the one
may
become the fearless champion, while the other
remains the timid defender, of Christianity; the
one
may seek danger, while the other is only to
be found unappalled in the hour of extremity,
where his conduct and his example are
required.
Again, let the two become the subjects of sick-
ness, or of misfortune and sorrow, and there will
then be found a remarkable change of expression.
The former has been dependent for the manifestation
of his character upon an unbroken state of health,
upon the integrity of his nervous system; but let
these be disturbed, and where are now his activity,
his energy, his peaceful expectations? He is sus-
pended from active duty, and the victim of dis-
order becomes irritable; repines at the events
which circumscribe his exertions, and ardently
prays for recovery, that he may return to the
sphere of his active duties, wanting which, he
finds the exercise of the passive virtues encom-
passed with innumerable difficulties. It is far
easier to do than to mfer; the very fact of occu-
pation is favourable to strength, and gives energy
to exertion, and confidence of success to zealous
endeavour; but take away these props, and let the
post of duty be only to bear meekly, patiently,
enduringly, the ills with which we are encom-
passed, and such endurance becomes exceedingly
difiicult. This, too, is a
physical condition; and
there are few who have not experienced the benefit

of walking, or of horseback exercise, in dispelling
the clouds which hovered around them when they
have been wearied, and worried, and perplexed by
the intricacies and troubles of life. On the con-
trary, he who during health may have had less
appearance of religion, will now exhibit its sweetest
influence. Always accustomed to struggle against
constitutional melancholy, he will not he de-
pressed by its agency; he will be found stedfast
in the hour of trial ; he will bear much unmoved ;
his patience will be acknowledged by all ; he will
not have to contend with the irritability induced
by disease, but will earnestly strive after submis-
sion tothe appointments of Providence; this sub-
mission not being a
quiet yielding to inevitable
destiny which cannot be superseded, and which
will be made worse
by impatience, but a convic-
tion of the judgment, that what is ordered by
omniscient goodness must be right-and a cor-
responding yielding up the best affections of the
heart to Him whose very nature is love-bene-
volence which knows no bounds, but in the com-
plete happiness of all His creatures.
The same distinction will be visible on the near
approach of dissolution. It will be presently
shown that the phenomena of a death bed are
greatly influenced by the physical circumstances
which produce it,-that is, by the organ whose
primary disturbance, and subsequent loss of vitality,
induce general death; in the present instance,
therefore, it is supposed that the two are
drawing
near to the term of their existence under parallel

circumstances, and in such a
way that the eye
can
contemplate the last closing scene, undisturbed
by much bodily suffering. The original tenden-
cies of the constitution will be still marked, even
when it is about to crumble into ruins; the one,
full of hope and of confidence, will welcome the
last messenger as the appointed angel to introduce
him to the mansions of the blessed; the other,
despite many fears and occasional doubts, (the
passing clouds of a summer's evening sky,) will
still hold fast the profession of his faith in Christ
Jesus, and, relying on the complete satisfaction and
atonement of his Saviour, he will leave this world
in the trembling hope, that although the passing
clouds may have chequered the unbroken serenity
of evening, and even although his sun
may go
down behind the western cloud, yet that it is only
darkened as it passes the imaginary line of that
distant horizon which separates the present from a
future state of' existence, where it will rise to shine
for ever in unclouded glory. However dissimilar
may have been their actual feelings, and more
especially the expression of those feelings, both
these characters have been influenced by the same
principle; have rested their hopes on the same
basis; have been actuated by the same motives;
have lived in obedience to the same
precepts; have
offered the living sacrifice of their hearts upon
the same altar; have reposed on the same sup-
ports in their hour of trial ; and have been equally
accepted by the same compassionate Father and
Redeemer. Now, if these characteristics can be

compared with analogous passages in the history
ofthe lives of the individuals whose death-bed has
been sketched, it will be found that precisely the
same phenomena have characterized and distin-
guished them ; and more, that knowing the pecu-
liarity of temperament, it will be easy to say how
each one has felt and acted under any given cir-
cumstances; how far they have gone together-
how far they have diverged-and, again, how far
they have united in the accomplishment of any
given purpose in life.
A similar principle will oftentimes explain the
difference that is to be found among those really
in earnest about religion, some of whom will be
characterized by ardent zeal and enthusiasm, and
others by quiet steady pursuit, without that glow
of exertion which the former will manifest. Re-
ligion is in itself an inductive science, and as such
appeals to the judgment and the understanding;
but the beliefin its great truths, which expand far
beyond the intellectual reach, depends upon the
proper exercise of the imagination, and involves
the better feelings of our nature. Thus, it is
equally an affair of the heart and of the head;
and the most perfect and the most lovely Chris-
tian will be that one who possesses the largest
reach of intellect, and the greatest depth of affec-
tion; in other words, the one who can most fully
appreciate and receive its sublime doctrines; and
who, at the ,same time, with the simplicity and
confiding affection of a child, can yield himself
to the guidance and direction of his heavenly

Father. And where there is so
great a difference
of intellectual power, of judgment, of reflection,
of feeling, affection, and imagination,in different
individuals, it is not surprising that there should
be very great differences in the modes of thought,
and habits of expression, among those who are
equally in earnest upon this great subject. Con-
stitutional tendency, and physical temperament,
will often account for that which perhaps might
be called worldliness by one class, which class
would in the views of the former be considered as
remarkable for cant. And this may perfectly con-
sist with, and arise from, individuality of character;
hence the former should not be designated as irre-
ligious, nor the latter as
hypocritical.
Again, the circumstances attendant upon con-
version will also frequently receive a
tinge from
peculiar bodily agency. On this subject many
well-meaning individuals feel great anxiety, par-
ticularly if they cannot mark distinctly the period
when that grand change passed upon their unre-
newed hearts, and when they first turned to God
by His Spirit. Now when the sun has risen, we
do not require to be convinced that it is day, by
being told the hour at which its beams first be-
came visible, or the angle of incidence with which
they first impinged upon our
eye from the distant
hill: we look abroad ; we are cheered by the light,
and animated by the heat; we
rejoice in its rays,
and are
energized to action by its influence. So,

sinner's intellectual vision, and has shone into his

heart, we do not require to know the hour when
this glorious change was effected, because we
open
our
eyes, and we see the sun has risen, and that
the summer is nigh; that the individual has
brought forth fruits meet for repentance, exhibit-
ing a
holy and consistent life, and a humble de-
pendence upon the Spirit of grace.
Now these are those in whom this change will
have been so gradual, that it cannot be said with
precision when it took place. The attention will
have been first awakened to this infinitely impor-
tant topic as a matter of study; its necessity will
be perceived; the judgment will be informed; it
will be convinced ; the heart will be influenced by
its determinations; the clouds of error, and the
mist of prejudice, will be cleared away by the
Spirit of God; the offers of mercy will be re-
ceived, and the fruits of a
holy life will be pro-
duced. On the other hand, there are those whose
attention is first aroused by some
powerful im-
pression made on the imagination or the feelings;
or
by some awful manifestation of Divine Provi-
dence; or
by some
personal misfortune or sick-
ness; or
by some event, apparently of little mo-
ment, but which appeals forcibly to the heart.
Thus the sinner is arrested; he pauses; he hesi-
tates; he cries out in the agony of conscious guilt,
"
Lord, be merciful to me a sinner." Here the
chief difference consists in the fact, whether the
awakening cause was first exerted upon the un-
derstanding or the affections ; thus distinctly show-
ing that the expression of religious feeling is

characterized by a peculiar physical state; and
we infer, that if this be the case in one
great condi-
tion, so also will it be in many minor shades of
thought, and feeling, and action; shades which,
in fact, make up the character by their combi-
nation.
But we
go further, and we assert that there are
some morbid conditions which attend this process,
and which evince the dependence of religious ex-
pression upon physical temperament. In those
whose attention has been first fixed upon religion,
through the agency of some
powerful cause operat-
ing on the imagination or the feelings, the influ-
ence of conviction will be deeply and permanently
felt; it will often happen that religion will be
attended to as an exclusive idea; the mind will
not listen to the calls of business, or of relative
and domestic duties; the functions of the body
will be overset; the integrity of the nervous
system will be disturbed ; and brooding hypochon-
driasis, or absolute despair, will be the result.
Now this is not the consequence of religious influ-
ence; for there is a
"
balm in Gilead," and the
great Physician of souls does not infiict a wound
without the power and the willingness to heal.
Where, then, either of the above states is found to
exist, a morbid irritation of the nervous
system,
not the agency of religion, is to be blamed: it is
the brain, as the organ of mind, not the spiritual
prineipk, which is the source of these morbid
manifestations. This is still further shown by the
result of particular treatment. Moral manage-

ment, in the experience of divines, as well as
physicians, will produce very little effect, while it
often happens that medicinal agents will effectually
bring about a cure. Let the ultimate result too
be considered. Under the direction of the phy-
sician, this particular disturbance of the nervous
system will be removed; hypochondriasis and de-
spair will vanish, and their subject will sometimes
return to his former gaiety and thoughtlessness;
he will be absorbed by the pursuit of trifles;
another exclusive idea will commonly occupy his
attention, and his future conduct will be tinged by
this prevailing impression; he becomes eccentric,
and is termed a
ilighty, romantic, odd creature.
This is not always the case; for God, in His
infinite wisdom, sometimes employs this bodily
calamity so as to make a
permanent impression
upon the mind, which (when its material organ
has been restored to health) remains subdued by
religion; it has left the service of sin, and has laid
hold of the hope set before it in the Gospel, which
hope will prove an anchor to the soul, and will
preserve the equilibrium of a nervous system too
prone to susceptibility.
At another time, with perfectly right intentions,
and with every good principle and good wish, too
great a
degree of eagerness and fervour will be
visible in the character; and it will then be
marked by eccentricities, which would pass cur-
rent in the world for peculiarity of manner and
habit, but which in the disciples of Christ are
commonly magnified, and made a
ground of pre-

588 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
judice against real religion. And this consequence
arises from not giving due consideration to the
agency of physical temperament, in a state of
health, and under certain conditions of excitement
or depression. Some practical illustrations of this
principle may be useful, as
placing before the
reader a few of the facts, whence, by induction, these
principles have arisen.
1. A young lady whose relatives have shown
the constitutional tendency to insanity, exhibited
some
years since, decided symptoms of mental
aberration-taking the form of religious fear-as-
suming the tyranny of an exclusive idea, and over-
turning the integrity of the brain. She recovered ;
but is still liable to occasional derangements of
the nervous
system; and although truly in earnest
on the subject of religion, yet her character is
marked by little obliguities, which, in the judg-
ment of those who will not make the requisite
allowance, will operate as a
prejudice against re-
ligion itself. When will candid inquirers separate
the peculiarities of physical temperament, and the
influence of physical disorder, from the unbiassed
manifestations of mental agency.
2. A poor man of active intellect, whose life
had been characterized by much deviation from
the paths of virtue, was attacked by a similar form
of insanity; he was confined to his bed by cerebral
excitement, which was called conviction ofsin, when
one day he said that "
Jesus Christ himself had
come in at the window to his relief," and from that
period he dated his recovery. Whatrightly think-

ing person does not here recognise a
regular
paroxysm of mental alienation, in which a spectral
hallucination, from its powerful impression upon
the sensorium, superseded the first morbid impres-
sion, and served to restore its equipoise to the
disturbed organ? The sequel of this history is
instructive ; this illness proved the means ofawaken-
ing serious attention to the most important of all
subjects; and the individual has since proved a
useful and a virtuous member of society, and a
decided and consistent Christian. True, indeed,
he is apt to be visionary and enthusiastic; his
personal hopes of salvation rest (as he has con-
stantly aflirmed) in this revelation of Christ Jesus
to his bodily senses; and he is much excited if
any doubt be thrown on its reality; his general
cast of character, is that being fond of novelty and
of eccentricities of doctrine; and he is liable to that
determination of blood to the head, and consequent
nervous excitement, which declare the precarious
tenure, by which even now reason maintains her
seat.
Another illustration of this principle will be
found in the history of E. F -, a
truly excellent
woman of liberal education and enlarged mind;
whose conduct for very many'years may be referred
to as unblemished, and whose life, for a considerable
period, has been passed between the alternations of
long intervals of depression and iitful gleams of
cheerfulness, and even of joy. During the former
state, a
degree of languor is observable in the per-
formance of religious services; there is a listless-

ness and inaptitude-nay, more, perhaps a
positive
disrelish for the pursuit: the mind is a burden to
itself, since the consciousness of this indiiference
weighs upon it with all the force and impression of
criminal neglect, and of consequent doubt as to
the reality and sincerity of its endeavours and its
hopes. At another period every thing wears a
brightening aspect; there is a high degree of en-
joyment in every act of religious duty ; there is an
augmented happiness in the pursuit of sacred
objects; there is an
eagerness after religious con-
versation, and a desire to make others sensible of
the primary importance of Divine truth. A super-
iicial observer might here pronounce on the pre-
sence or absence of the sacred influences of the
Holy Spirit; but a nearer and dispassionate view
of the case, would detect the morbid agency of an
irritated brain; and might probably discover in
the hour of depression, that peculiar state of the
nervous
system, in which its manifestations are of
a feeble or asthenic character; and in which the
patient is comparatively safe, although it is con-
fessed, that in these instances,an insane weariness
of life is sometimes produced, together with a desire,
at all hazards, to get rid of the tedinm of its con-
tinuance; a state which is often considered by ex-
cellent persons as a
peculiar temptation of Satan,
but which commonly owns a
purely physical origin.
On the other hand, during the alternating reign of
spiritual comfort, the accurate observer would
equally detect an excited state of the brain attended
by a
quickened pulse, and a whitish tongue; a

great eagerness of expression on all subjects; a
constant disposition to talk; a restless irritability
of pursuit from one
object to another, and again
another; an unnatural hurried manner; a
degree
of good-humour with all things; an
impossibility
of fixing and controlling the thoughts to any given
point; together with a determined disposition in
spite of every effort to wander hither and thither:
nay, more, he would find that by local depletion,
and the other resources of medicine; by abstinence
and absolute quiet; and, above all, by procuring
sleep, (which is generally wooed in vain,) in a few
days the feverish excitement will be subdued ; and
the subject of it will be restored possibly to health,
but more
frequently to his former state of depres-
sion.
Another individual has been subjected for many
years to frequent attacks of nervous irritation,
which are
mainly characterized by deeply-rooted
dissatisfaction with every thing. Surrounded even
by the superfluities of this world's good, she seems
as if bereft of comfort; and is at the same time
tormented by a consciousness of the sin of ingra-
titude, arising out of the impossibility she feels
of entering into or of relishing any of the beauties
of nature, or of the luxurious enjoyments with
which she is encompasesd. But when this morbid
irritation of the brain has been removed, there is
no longer any distaste towards surrounding objects;
there is no
longer any sense of the sinful forgetful-
ness of the bounty of Providence; she glides
carelessly along, amused by the veriest trilles,

without a
single serious thought beyond the passing
hour, and, indeed, apparently, with a studious
determination to drive away any similar impres-
sion.
It has fallen to the author to notice these efiects
under a
variety of circumstances, and in different
forms; once in an individual who had no
religious
duties to perform, because she had no soul-an
irreparable severance had been made between her
body and her former] self; and she was no
longer
a
responsible person, because she had no power
over what was once herself, but was so no
longer.
Again, the same morbid state is to be found in
another instance, where the individual would reason
very correctly, as to what she ought to do under
certain circumstances; but when placed under
those circumstances always acted diametrically
opposite, alleging that she had no power to control
these impulses; and made no effort to control them,
because she waited for the power, which was to
originate the will, which was to re-act upon the
conduct.
It may be said, perhaps, that these were cases of
insanity. It is immaterial to the inference to be
drawn from them. One thing is clear, that they
are exaggeration; of doctrines very commonly en-
tertained, especially the latter; and perhaps the
question of sanity or
insanity is only in this instance
a
question of degree and not of kind. And then,
if these ultra states be called insanity, in which the
function of the brain is thoroughly overturned, is
it not a
just inference that minor disturbances of

the same
organ will produce similar effects, though
in an inferior degree, upon the manifestations of
mind.
T/ze RESULT of such instances is not to be for-
gotten: in the former, the irritation of the brain
has been removed; the soul and body are re-
united ; and there is a
quiet, consistent, pious cha-
racter-active in the performance of every duty-
active, without ostentation-zealous, without en-
thusiasm. Time has not produced the same effect
in the other case, and the hallucinations continue.
These cases have been under similar management,
and have had the same amount of energy expended
upon them; yet with a different result; and why?
Not because the reason has not been convinced,
for, perhaps, conviction has been more easily
wrought in the unsuccessful, than in the successful
case-but because, in the one case, the health of
the manifesting organ has been restored, and in
the other has remained disordered.
Do not these things prove a striking dependence
upon physical conditions, for the expression of re-
ligious feelings? It is not, therefore, the amount
of enjoyment which may be derived from the ser-
vices of religion, but the conscientious perseverance
in its duties, which should form the criterion, by
which to test the sincerity and earnestness of pur-
pose, which animate and guide the heart.
So, also, with respect to the expression of prayer.
A great difference is observable in different indi-
viduals in their power of commanding their atten-
tion, and associating their thoughts, as well as in

elaborating and giving utterance to their ideas.
The spirit of real supplication may rest as deeply
in those who cannot clothe their desires in words,
as in those who are
superficially gifted with at
large volubility of expression. Farther, the same
distinction may be observed in the same individual,
under a
change of physical circumstances. Only
let sickness assail the frame, especially sickness of
a character which distresses the head; or even let
it be subject to great bodily fatigue : and now, an
oppressive languor creeps upon the mind, obtunds
the feelings, impedes the powers of association,
distracts the attention, perverts the perception, and
destroys that nice talent and gift of eloquent com-
bination, which before might have charmed us
by its brilliance and its fervor. And wherein con-
sists this change? It is not that the immaterial
principle is suffering from fatigue, but that the
organ through which its manifestations occur, is
in a state of irritation. It is a well-known fact,
that many of the most brilliant public writers and
speakers, the cornscations of whose imagination
astonish and enchant the breathless reader or
hearer, have been persons labonring under this
affection of the brain; varying during their whole
life, through all the stages of alternate languor and
excitement, from almost idiotic apathy to actual
frenzy. How little, then, is the state of man's
heart, in the sight of God, to be judged of by such
superficial manifestations !
The same observation will apply to the capacity
for fixing the attention upon any serious pursuit;

and this, too, not only as a
general principle, but
with the most marked difference in different per-
sons. There are some individuals possessed of
highly susceptible systems, on whom very slight
causes will operate in destroying their powers of
attention. It will be found that these same cha-
racters are
equally liable to disturbances in the
economy of the animal functions: and that both
will happen in the same
way, and may be accounted
for, on the principle of their possessing a
peculiar
irritability of nerves, in consequence of which, a
slight point of irritation in any part of the system
is rapidly diffused by the agency of those cords
through the whole frame; and occasions that de-
pression and re-action which constitute the phe-
nomena ofdisease. In these subjects, bodily ailment
of a
trifling character will interfere with the in-
tegrity of the cerebral function, and serious thought
will become an
oppressive burden. Now the de-
pendence of mental manifestation upon a material
organ, and the subservience of the latter to the
former, will be shown by the fact, that this indis-
position for exertion may oftentimes be overcome
by a
powerful effort, arising out of a
deep conviction
of duty, or from the unexpected agency of some
extrinsic circumstance. And again, if the sensations
of sickness be long continued; or if they should
be aggravated by any adventitious cause, or if they
should be accompanied by much pain ; or if pain and
disease having subsided, shall have previously pro-
duced notwithstanding such havoc upon the con-
stitution as to occasion positive debility; then the

feeling escapes beyond the control even of these
powerful motives, and intellectual vigour can no
longer be excited by any effort of volition, however
strenuous. This it is, which renders the languor
of convalescence so much more difiicult to bear,
than the continuance of positive disease; the pa-
tient /:nows that he is recovering, yet feels the
consciousness of being inadequate to the perform-
ance of the duties which he most desires; he is
chained down by bodily_weakness which he cannot
possibly shake off, and must wait for a return of
bodily strength before he can
give effect to his
wishes. This consideration should pa1liate,if not
in a
great measure excuse, the peevishness, im-
patience, and irritability, which attend the con-
valesccnce of those who have borne severe and
protracted suffering without a murmur, or a
single
expression approaching to complaint.
This principle is still further illustrated by the
opposite condition of the nervous
system; and as
we have already instanced a
high degree of sus-
ceptibility of that system, so now would we make
mention of those, in whom impressions do not
easily develope morbid irritation. The power of
resisting the influence of disease varies in almost
every individual, and is a well-known physiological
fact; hence, the tendency to destruction of the
animal frame is much greater in some
persons
than in others ; and this difference probably consists
in the possession of' a
greater or less degree of
nervous
susceptibility. Be this or be it not the
rationale of such a condition, it is very certain, that

or BODY AND MIND. 597
there are individuals so
capable of enduring pro-
tracted suffering, as in a
great degree to resist its
disturbing agency upon the nervous system; and
it may be further observed, that their minds appear
to possess so
great a
degree of independence on
bodily function, that they are not influenced, to
the same extent with others, by the varying con-
ditions of fatigue or exhaustion, from whatever
cause
arising. An intimate and extensive ac-
quaintance with the phenomena of health and
disorder, will show that this happy immunity
depends not upon any original constitution of
mind, but of body; a state which renders less pal-
pable the associated links in the chain of morbid
action, and which defends the nervous
apparatus
from excitement upon trivial occasions; in fact,
which renders it less susceptible of diseased irri-
tation, and better capable of resisting its agency.
In these cases, the brain is not the weak but the
strong organ of the body, and therefore it is the
last to be disturbed by any cause which destroys
the balance of health. It will be easily seen, too,
that this property, which is a
gift of the Creator
in the constitution of nature, and originally a
purely physical attribute, may be strengthened and
enlarged by the action of moral means
upon the
organ through which these manifestations of mind
become cognisable; so that a firm and determinate
judgment-decision of character-prompt and per-
severing action-inflexible justice- the infiuence
of the affections and passions-the agency of custom
and habit-and above all, the operation of religious

598 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
principle, will do much towards establishing what
God has thus bestowed; and, on the contrary,
the absence of these circumstances will render this
original gift almost entirely nugatory. The power
of withdrawing from sem and surrounding objects ;
of abstracting the mind from things which make
a
present powerful appeal to the feelings, and of
fixing it upon future unseen realities, is in a
great
measure the result of these two causes; viz. the
original constitution of the mental organ developed
and enlarged by the influence of those moral
agencies which give energy to intellectual and
spiritual action; and which diminish the sympa-
thetic connexion that exists between the organ of
thought, and the other organs and functions of the
body.
This principle will serve to explain the various
and even
opposite features which are remarked in
different individuals, in regard to thejoyful exercise
offaith. Faith is, indeed, the gift of God; but
the manifestations of its influence to us mortals
who cannot read the inmost recesses of the heart,
must be made through the clouds of materiality.
lts operations upon mind and conduct, and our
perception of them, are alike depending upon
organic influence; and are, therefore, subjected to
the laws which govern organic life. lt will be
manifest upon reflection, that the active exercise
of faith, and hope, and joy, involves not simply
a firm belief in certain principles, but also the
exertion of imagination; or rather of that exqui-
site perception and discriminating association which

are the offspring of that mental property; and
these are
essentially depending for their mani-
festation upon the health, and strength, and apti-
tude of' the organ of mind. A little consideration
devoted to the individuals themselves will show at
once the kind of constitution in which these feelings
will be found to predominate; heightened, it is
true, by moral and religious circumstances, but
still most strongly marked in certain physical
temperaments, in which, abstracting the attribute
of religion, the same
tendency will be found to
prevail. It should, however, be distinctly under-
stood that this property, although it appears to
communicate a certain degree of vigour to the
principle, is by no means necessary to its stealfast-
ness; and perhaps, indeed, it is not easy to estimate
the liability of such quickly susceptible minds, to
be overset by the powerful impression of this prin~
ciple, awakened by a conviction of the favour of
God, and by the anticipation of heavenly felicity;
and thus, by the re-action of mind upon matter,
to have the balance of reason overturned, or the
integrity of some one or other weak organ of the
body destroyed. Reflection upon these circum-
stances will show, that the characters so situated
are liable to be assailed by very different kinds of
trials and difliculties, since the tendency of the
one will be to doubt its possession of genuine
faith, and to all the depressing consequences of
this conviction; while that of the other will be
towards the effervescence of joy, and to the luxury
of uncontrolled thought, floating on the surface

of an
ever-wandering imagination. Happy, in-
deed, should we be, that the object to be most
desired, and sought after, is not the joy of faith,
but the humble confidence of child-like depend-
ence; and that the evidence for the existence of
this principle of faith is to be sought after, in the
unyielding perseverance of duty, through all the
diliiculties of this world's contumely, rather than
in the uncharacterized pleasures which arise from
a heart elevated above itself and the things around
it, under the precarious agency of excited and joyful
emotion.
The operation of the same cause
may be traced
towards the close of man's earthly existence, and
upon the eve of his dissolution. I am aware, that
I am
approaching a
very delicate subject; but
truth is of more value than any indulgence of the
erroneous opinions of some
worthy persons, who
may not have sufficiently considered the influence
of the dependence of mind upon matter for its
manifestation ; and who have, therefore, constituted
the death-bed scene an event of much greater
moral consequence than it really is. There are
some circumstances of great importance to be con-
sidered in connexion with this subject, and which
will be now pointed out somewhat in detail.
There are individuals who have viewed the
occasionally unimpaired, and even increased thought,
and vigour of mind towards the close of life, as an
evidence of the immateriality and consequent im-
mortality of the soul. But it is neither; and there-
fore the idea should not be entertained, since, if

erroneous, it can
scarcely be held without evil
effects. And so it is in the present instance; for
if the state just detailed be received as lawful
evidence of the soul's immateriality, and eternal
existence; then the opposite, and by far the more
frequent state, in which the mental manifestations
are obscured, or
perverted by disease, must be
received as lawful evidence of its materiality, de-
cadence, and consequent approach to extinction; a
conclusion which none but the most infatuated will
allow. The truth is, as we have seen, that mind
is depending for the integrity of its manifestations
upon the health of its organ, the brain. And when
organic life is verging to dissolution ; when all the
functions of the body, depending upon the brain
for their continuance, are
feebly performed; and
when every circumstance proclaims the approach-
ing separation of all that is mortal in man from
his spiritual nature ; itis quite impossible to expect
that the manifestations of his mind should not also
be impaired; much less, that they should generally
be brightened, and rendered more vivid and intense.
True it is, that this phenomenon may be observed
in some rare instances; and it may then be ac-
counted for, on the principle above-mentioned, in
explaining the remarkable degree of independence
of some minds upon physical causes; namely,
partly upon original constitution-partly upon the
force of moral influences. But these influences
form exceptions to the general rule, which is un-
doubtedly, that the manifestations of mind are
rendered feeble or obscure, ineflicient, or perverted,

602 'mn RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
exactly in proportion as its organ may have been
subjected to the influence of disease.
Many persons, who are anxious for a
triumphant
death-bed, are not aware how much of animal
fervour may be mingled with such expressions of
ecstacy; and great caution should be exercised
before any reliance is placed upon phenomena of
this kind. Death is a fearful event; and though
disarmed of its terrors to the Christian, it is still
a violence from which nature shrinks; and to the
failing powers of the body, thc quiet confidence of
submissive hope,
"
Thy will be done," will be far
more
appropriate than that exulting language
which depends more upon animal excitation than
upon spiritual attainment. Even our blessed
Saviour prayed that he might be delivered from
the hour of his agony, in submission to tl1e will
of God the Father ; and with this example in their
view, his followers need not be ashamed of shrink-
ing with fear from the physical influence of death.
True, indeed, that martyrs have triumphed in
joy at the stake; but then we must remember
how much their minds were
wrought up to a
pitch
of unwonted elevation, and the extraordinary sup-
port they derived from above, as witnesses for the
truth in Christ; and therefore no
general rule can
be drawn from their endurance of suffering. Be-
sides, even the powerful stimulus of mere fanati-
cism has produced almost analogous effects; and
the firm and determined resolution of the Hindoo
widow to expire on the funeral pile of her husband,
may be quoted as an instance of that ecstatic state

or Bonv AND MIND. 603
of mind which arises from a
powerful impression
carrying it beyond its ordinary self. It is very
possible that the courage and self-devotion of these
deluded victims of false religion may sometimes,
perhaps frequently, fail; but that in some instances
they do not fail, we have unquestionable evidence,
and it is enough for our
present purpose if, at any
time, a
powerful impression upon the idolatrous
mind shall have produced analogous effects with
those which may have given rise to similar con-
sequences, though with very different views, in the
case of a
worshipper of the true God.
ln illustrating this influence of powerful moral
motive, it must not be forgotten that we have
similar effects produced, without even the sem-
blance of fanaticism to give point to motive, and
energy to action, viz. in the unbroken fortitude,
and power of endurance, and exulting triumph
over the cruelties of his tormentors-pointing out
to his enemies the mode in which the intensity of
their inflictions might be increased-and coura-
geously bearing up under every ingenuity of torture
without an
expression of suffering-even taunting
his persecutors with their little capacity to produce
pain-and all for what? only to sustain the
honour of his tribe-only to bear suffering and to
die as a Red Indian ought to do, without giving
a colourable pretext for triumph to his enemies.
And if so inferior a motive can
give to this fine
and noble, but natural character, such a
supe-
riority to physical suffering under merely physical
exaltation, can we wonder that the Christian

martyr may under similar circumstances exhibit
an
equal amount (greater he cannot) of superiority
to pain, when to a similar state of physical excita-
tion are
superadded with him, all the present com-
forts and the future hopes of the christian religion,
and all the supports and sanctions of divine
truth?
However, experience shows that the supposed
rule is fallacious, for many a feeble Christian
expires in trembling doubt, while many a careless
sinner is remarkable for his calm, or rather his
thoughtless dismissal; many a
self-righteous pha-
risee has left this world with exulting recollections
of his own
good works, on which were built his
hopes of happiness beyond it. This observation is
grounded, not upon theory, but upon actually
witnessing the death-bed of many; and this has
occurred to such an extent, and so
repeatedly, that
the nature of the malady, and the kind of tempe-
rament being given, it will be easy to predicate,
cceteris paribus, the peculiarities of the death-bed.
Let not, therefore, surrounding friends be too
solicitous about the last words of the dying, under
the iniluence of disease, and of failing cerebral
power; but let them rather look back upon a
holy and consistent life, spent in the service of
God, as the fruit and evidence of faith in Christ;
and as
springing from the redeemed sinner's being
washed, and purified, and sanctified by the blood
of Christ, and clothed with his spotless righteous-
ness, by the Spirit of our God. Here let them rest
their hopes, on a
ground that will not deceive

them, rather than upon the precarious phenomena
of dissolution, characterized by physical tempe-
rament, encompassed by infirmity, and modified
by a
great diversity ot' organic irritation. This
will form a
testimony to the truth of the Gospel,
far more valuable than the last expressions of the
expiring Christian. "
Blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord ; they rest from their labours, and
their works do follow them."
We all need the motives of duty to be constantly
before our
eyes; perhaps, therefore, there is a
danger
lest the above view of the subject should exert a
benumbinginfluence upon the watchfuluess and acti-
vity of the Christian; and lest he should refer ALL
the circumstances of mental joy or suffering at this
season to purely physical causes. But these phe-
nomena are not wholly dependent upon a
bodily
origin; and indeed the state of the brain itself;
at this very time, will be materially influenced by
its prembus habitual actions. And let him rest
assured, that whatever may be his external situa-
tion at the moment, he has no reason to expect
tranquillity, if his life has not been actively con-
sistent with his profession. This isindeed involved
in the previous supposition; but it needs to be
broadly stated, that if the believer in Christ has
slumbered at the post of duty, the enemy will have
sown tares among the wheat,
"
while men
slept ;"
if he has omitted to cultivate his talents to the
utmost; if he has been remiss in attending to the
ordinances of religion; if he has been careless in
his walk and conversation; if' he has been proud

and highminded; if he has been negligent in
discharging the offices assigned him by Provi-
dence; above all, if he has indulged any secret
iniquity, or allowed any unhallowed passion, or
suffered the existence of any idol in his heart, and
that thus his affections have been in a measure
weaned from his God and Saviour,-tlum, indeed,
though his lamp may not have gone out, yet it
will yield but a feeble and flickering light to
others; his own
hopes, also, will be undefined and
uncertain; he will have planted a thorn in his
dying pillow; he will have thrown a
deep shade
over his prospects; he will have brought anguish
into his bosom, and will have exchanged the placid
smile of serene and humble dependence, for the
tears of bitter penitence.
But there are also other circumstances connected
with the last hours of life, which enthusiasm and
superstition have embraced, and to which they
cling with a
pertinacity of grasp, not unusual when
determinativeness has resulted rather from feeling
than from judgment. Among these may be reck-
oned the vision of angels, and an immediate reve-
lation of the glory of the Saviour, and of the
heavenly world. Let it then ever be recollected
that the spirit, though hovering on the verge of
eternal scenes, is still confined to its material tene-
ment; and that whatever it may perceive, is
through the medium of that corporeal habitation.
It is only purely mischievous to suppose it disem-
bodied, and capable of its future powers and func-
tions. Besides, these things may be rationally

accounted for. In the failing powers of the body,
and particularly of the brain, ocular spectra are
not unusual; and these, characterized by an
imaginative or enthusiastic disposition, will suf-
ficiently explain phenomena which are
purely
corporeal in their origin. The true method of
estimating these circumstances, as well as others
which generally attend the near approach of dis-
solution, is, by remarking their varieties in dif-
ferent individuals, and by comparing them with
the particular organ which is the principal seat of
irritation in approaching death.
It will be manifest, ~upon a
very little reflection,
that in fatal diseases some one organ gives way
first, loses the integrity of its functions and of its
structure; or, in fact, dies first. This disorganisa-
tion may be primarily visible in the lungs, the
heart, the stomach, the brain, or
any other im-
portant viscus. When it happens to be the brain,
the manifestations of mind are in ordinary cases
obscured or
perverted ; but in some other instances
an artificial brightness and intensity may be given
them, just before their final dissolution, as will
appear subsequently. And in those instances in
which any other organ of the body is the first to
give way, its effect upon the mental attributes will
be in a ratio proportioned to the intimate sympa-
thy and connexion which exists between the failing,
dying viscus and the brain ; great, where that con-
nexion is extensive, small, where it is remote and
contingent; in some cases
scarcely at all percep-
tible; in others, forming one of the most painful

THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
phenomena attaching to the pillow of sickness and
the bed of death. And moreover, there will
always be individual peculiarities, referrible to
natural or
acquired idiosyncracies, the principles
of which have been already detailed. All these
considerations should tend to prove of how little
comparative importance are the circumstances of
the death-bed; how all-important is a
holy, vir-
tuous life, built upon the love, and devoted to the
service, of Christ.
There is, however, one other event to be ani-
madverted upon in this place; one, which many
excellent individuals appear to consider as of great
importance, and as
being the effect of a
special
revelation from on high. All such views are in-
judicious, and tend to the excitement of much
prejudice, because they are
opposed to the con-
clusions of truth. Yet the soundest wisdom is to
be found in religion; and that is the truest philo-
sophy which contemplates man in all his relations,
compounded as these are of animal, social, and
religious life. The author was
particularly struck
with this error, on
perusing a sermon some
years
since, on the death of a
clergyman, in which a
state of this kind is evidently set forth as
being
very important. Yet it is not only unimportant,

alluded to was

been failing; and then, just before dissolution, a
sudden coruscation of intellect, tinged by religious

feeling and principle, shone forth; an effect which
indeed might be justly pleasing to by-standers,
as an evidence of what the previous IW had been,
but certainly ought not to have been considered as
the result of an
especial communication from the
Holy Spirit, whatever might have been the im-
pression upon the mind of a
highly susceptible
individual, in a moment of deep feeling, enlarged
by all the interesting circumstances of a Chris-
tian's translation from the misery and feebleness of
disease, to the happiness and energy of heaven.
If the opposite conclusion were true in one case,
it must be true in all similar cases; if applicable
to one, it may be applied to all others, in which
the analogy is perfect; and the consequences
which would arise from this admission, would in
themselves be inadmissible; for if it be ascribed
to an
especial revelation in the case of a
good
man, the same cause must be alleged as
producing
a similar effect, when, in the judgment of the
most expansive charity, hope must be slender.
The fact is, that in both instances these pheno-
mena are referable to one
physiological law, viz.
that just before the giving way of any particular
organ of the body, there is communicated to it,
and to the nervous
system at large, a
temporary
stimulus, which gives to the patient a sensation
as if the individual failing viscus were
actually
in a state of high health and vigour. This law
may be easily exemplified; and indeed it is well
known to all persons who have a weak digestion;
under some circumstances, there will be a

of comfort and elasticity diffused throughout the
system, and, as it should seem, irradiating from the
very organ in fault, the stomach, which to the
uninitiated patient speaks a decided improvement
of health and strength; whereas, in five minutes
afterwards, a consciousness of sinking and debility,
and all the other phenomena of indigestion, will
proclaim that this organ was
only under the in-
fluence of temporary excitation, from the actual
commencement of that morbid action which was
so
speedily to terminate in failing power.
This principle may be applied to the brain; and
it will be noticed that a similar excitation of
mental manifestation is a
very usual phenomenon
as the precursor of dissolution. So frequent, in-
deed, and so obvious is this circumstance, that it
has been noticed by ordinary attendants upon such
occasions; who, without reasoning at all, or rea-
soning only erroneously,_ have termed it, a
"
light-
ening before death," a circumstance which they
consider as
marking the approach of that event.
It is always distinguished by a
high degree of
energy, and intensity of cerebral manifestation;
there is a
strength of voice, and earnestness of
manner, which for days, and even for weeks pre-
viously, have been imperceptible, and which fre-
quently portray the natural manner in excess; and
by this effort the patient's strength is commonly
exhausted, and the last remnant of vitality is
extinguished. This may happen alike to all; to
the righteous as well as to the careless : the object
only is different. In the former case, it is charac-

terized by deep views of religion; in the latter, it
relates to family affairs chiefly, or to some other
subject of great, but finite interest. But one cause
is suflicient to account for precisely similar pheno-
mena, differing only in the mode of their applica-
tion; and if the first arise from a
special revelation,
so must the second likewise. Nevertheless the
latter occasion is not worthy of such a
supposition ;
and as it is important not to call in direct super-
natural agency, in circumstances which may be
accounted for on natural principles; and since
prejudice is excited in weak minds by such a
practice, and a
stumbling-block is thrown in the
way of those who are almost persuaded to be Chris-
tians, it is far better to choose the simple alter-
native of natural or
physiological rationale, than to
contend for a
point on which no one valuable
principle rests for support, which can do no mate-
rial good, and which may do some harm.
The question may here be asked, of what utility
is this discussion; and what practical benefit will
accrue from the conclusions, true? To this, it
might be suihcient to reply, that it is always useful
to arrive at truth, in any particular case, especially
in a
disputed one. But in this instance, the fol-
lowing objects may be stated, as attainable through
the adoption of these principles.
I. To promote a
spirit of charity.
Uniformity in matters of religious belief, so
far as it is really attainable, is an invaluable de-
sideratum; but although there are some cardinal
points on which all true Christians will meet, there

are others on which a certain degree of latitude
must be permitted both on account of mental ob-
liquity, and physical iniirmity; for it is not pos-
sible, that all men should think alike; and, even
if it were, they would still express their thoughts
so dissimilarly, as to give to their hearers the idea
of difference where no real discrepancy existed.
Take a hundred individuals from the same class in
society, and give them some recent and acknow-
ledged event, on which to detail their own views
and feelings; not only will these be different in
almost every instance, but the manner in which
the opinion is conveyed will be equally diversified ;
and this manner forms the style of the individual,
that is, the appropriate expression of his habits of
thought and feeling. When this style is natural,
it is, for the most part, the result of physical con-
formation ; or, in other words, of that combination
of mind witl1 matter, and of their long-continued
mutual iniluence, which form the individual cha-
racter.
It, then, opinion, and feeling, and expression, he
allowed to be so various; and if this difference can
be accounted for, on
peculiarity of physical tem-
perament, may we not claim a similar latitude, not
for one event, and that a recent one, but for many
and largely-complicated series of actions; for many
incontrovertible, though not demonstrable truths;
for an infinite series of moral maxims; and for the
most important doctrines, some of which exceed
the capacity of man's finite understanding, and can
only be received as matters of belief ? Must we

not allow, that the impressions received through
the medium of_physical agency, and again conveyed
to others through a similar mode of communica-
tion, may, and indeed must, receive a
tinge from
such agency; an effect, which does not alter their
original character, but only changes the garb in
which they are clothed? If, then, there be indi~
viduality of character to account for this diversity,
while the soul remains one, is it not just to account
for this variety, upon the manner in which that
soul has been united to the body, and upon the
medium through which it possesses the power of
manifesting its operations, namely, by the agency
of physical means?
There is another class of excellent persons, who
are much disposed to measure the influence of re-
ligious principle by the capacity and disposition
to converse about it. They will complain of indi-
viduals, that they cannot speak about religion; or
they will estimate the value of others, by observing
that they can converse fluently and freely on this
subject. Nothing can be more erroneous than this
criterion; for as a
general rule, in other circum-
stances, it will happen, that they who talk the
most, feel and do the least; and that they are not
to be relied upon, when they come to have their
opinions tried by difhculties and perplexities, which
require the forgetfulness, and even the abjuration,
of selfish inclination and desire. A man of large
profession, is at all times one to whom the cautious
hesitate to yield their confidence; and experience
has shown that volubility of expression is very

generally dissociated from depth of judgment, or
the steady influence of principle; and, moreover,
that it is often connected with a weak and unstable
mind. So, common, indeed, is this result, that
in one of the most painful situations we meet with
in passing through life, viz. the disposition to
suicide-it is said as the result of experience,
"
Be
not afraid of him, for he talks about it." But,
granting to any number of persons an
equal depth
of feeling, and conviction of judgment, there will
still be a great individual difference in their capa-
city for expressing these identical results. One
man will be able to attend to the actions of his
own mind, and to give a clear and connected view
of each step, of a
lengthened series of ratiocina-
tions; but another will be utterly unable to explain
a single grade by which he has advanced to the
same conclusion. One will find no
difliculty in
embodying his thoughts in language, while this
may be diflicult to another, and impossible to a
third. One will describe with great minuteness
of simple detail ; another will give only the broad
and prominent outline; while a third will add to
every phenomenon the glowing heat of imaginative
colouring. One will relate his sensations in the
simplest and most natural method; another with
all the aids and disguises of rhetoric; while a third
will be unable to describe them at all. Yet it will
by no means follow, that of these individuals, the
second feels the most, or that the third does not feel
at all. In all probability, the converse of the

feels too deeply to find common
language adequate
to the utterance of his feelings ; while in the first,
judgment and feeling may be nicely balanced;
and in the second imagination be the preponderat-
ing faculty. But if this be true with the common
matters of ordinary reasoning, how immensely is
its probability enhanced when the attention is
directed to truths beyond the reach of finite capa-
city; and when the whole soul is absorbed in the
contemplation of those sublime and holy doctrines,
which should fill and govern the heart; or when
the eye is stedfastly directed to follow the traces
of His footsteps, who has been set forth as an
example for our imitation. Here, again, we infer,
that the deep agency of Divine truth, and the
power of expressing it, are seldom commensurate ;
and precisely because the former acts upon the
spiritual, while the latter is manifested through
the physical constitution of man. Let, then, a
great degree of caution, and an
expanded charity,
be observed in judging of others from their habits
of mere talking; and let the judgment be directed
rather to the steady consistency of active religious
principle, than to the ready effervescence of feel-
ing, or the learned loquacity of indifference.
II. To diminish the influence of prejudice.
i
The present view should tend to weaken the
agency of that baneful monster, which often keeps
the servants of the same Divine Master from each
other, enthralling their minds with the fetters of
ignorance, and shutting them up, not within the
circle of Divine truth, but within a narrow and

616 THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
exclusive pale of their own creation. It too often
happens, that even those whose minds are imbued
with the humility of scriptural religion; whose
hearts are warmed by tl1e charity of the Gospel;
and whose extensive philanthropy stands confessed
by all who know them; it often happens, that even
these feel, though perhaps reluctantly, and almost
hating themselves for their feelings, a diminution
of esteem for their fellow-Christians, who cannot
think precisely as
they think, on matters acknow-
ledged not to be of primary moment; or who are
not animated by equally glowing anticipations; or
filled with precisely the same fears; or stimulated
to the same degree of hope; or who do not enjoy
an
equal measure of confidence ;-men, whose
course is marked, not so much by the expression
of their views and feelings, their joys and hopes,
as
by the quiet, retiring, even, and consistent path
they have so
long trodden! VVhile a
willing
testimony is often borne to the excellence of their
character, there is the feeling that something is
still wanting; and which something does, in the
estimation of the prejudiced observer, detract from
the completeness of the man, the friend, and the
Christian. Now, it will be seen, that in all essen-
tial particulars, when tried by the law, and by the
testimony, these persons are not found wanting;
there is sterling metal, though it may not have
been so highly burnished, as would be desirable;
or it may not have been wrought after a
particular
fashion ; so that it does not reflect so
many of the
rays of truth as
may be exhibited by some other

minds. And this is precisely the case; the prin-
ciple is the same, but the mode of exhibiting it
varies according to fthe individuality of character ;
this again being modified in its manifestations, by
physical agencies.
With this clue to guide him, when he feels the
recoil of prejudice arising in his bosom, the cha-
ritable and well-judging Christian will inquire
more
narrowly; and possibly may discover, that
the difference between himself and another, which
produces this aversion, consists in the expression
of feeling, rather than in the conviction of judg-
ment. The latter may be coincident, while the
former is widely different. Now that which, even
in common life, contributes to the entireness of
the man, is the solidity of well-informed judgment;
that which thinks accurately, reasons
dispas-
sionately, weighs cautiously, judges slowly, de-
liberates comprehensively, determines firmly, and
acts decidedly. It is, then, to the result in action,
that we should look ; for each step of this process
will be influenced by the physical temperament,
the previous habits, the prevailing sentiments and
feelings. Religion is not merely a matter of feel-
ing, but of judgment, and of action; for, although
the contrary is too frequently the case, and although
feeling predominates, where there is very little
judgment, yet it will ever be found, that, in the
hour of trial, this is not to be relied upon, like the
uniform, unbending principle of settled conviction.
And it should be recollected, that this, too, is the
scriptural test; for the righteous who enter into

6l8~ THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE
life eternal, and who inherit the kingdom prepared
for them from the foundation of the world, are not
such as have been most prominent in the display
of their feelings; but, rather, those whose genuine
unostentatious faith has produced the fruits of
righteousness in the life. "
Come, ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you,
from the foundation of the world; for I was an
hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was
thirsty,
and ye gave me drink; I was a
stranger, and ye
took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was
sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye
came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer
Him, saying, Lord, when saw we then an
hungered,
and fed Thee? or
thirsty, and gave Thee drink?
When saw we Thee a
stranger, and took Thee
in? or naked, and clothed Thee? Or when saw
we Thee sick, or in prison, and came unto Thee?
And the King shall answer, and say unto them,
Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as
ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
ye have done it unto me."
If, then, this unwilling impression of diminished
regard do actually operate even with the liberal
and the charitable, how much more with those
pious persons whose minds have not been expanded
by education, by collision with society, and by
the habit of taking enlarged views of men and
things! It is individuals of this class, who are
particularly subjected to the agency of prejudice;
and whose simple honesty requires to be convinced
of the importance of making an allowance for the

different expression of religious opinions, and feel-
ings, and sentiments, according to the cast of in-
dividual character; this tinge being communicated
by the peculiar mode of mental action; and this
again depending not a little on the particular mo-
dification of physical temperament.
III. A third object of the present discussion, is
to cheer the desponding.
There are those who go on
heavily through their
whole lives-walking in the fear of God-reposing
by faith on the atonement of their Saviour, doing
his will, and seeking the promised influence of his
Holy Spirit, yet apparently wanting in that joy and
comfort, which we might consider should result
from being found consistently in the path of duty.
They are
disposed to question their sincerity and
devotedness to God, because their path is not
strewed with Bowers; they doubt the reality of
their interest in Christ, because they are destitute
of those pleasures which others have experienced
in obeying his laws; and yet they are ever found
at the post of duty ; and in the hour of trial and
temptation they do not fall away, but are
always
discovered firmly clinging to that Rock, which will
resist the attack of all the enemies of their souls.
Notwithstanding, a settled gloom surrounds them,
and prevents their seeing that they are secretly
upheld by the Spirit of Christ; and that it is their
earnest desire, though supported and encouraged
by very little of enjoyment, to obey Christ, and to
minister in every way to his disciples. It may be,
that, in some instances, the mind is clouded by an

620 THE nr-:c1PnocAL INFLUENCE
adherence to some idolatrous aifection, which may
not yet have been effectually given up; or
by
the unacknowledged indulgence of some favourite
sin; but it will much oftener happen, that this
state is depending upon purely physical causes,
and that it may be alleviated by their removal.
There are some minds so constituted, as to be
always anxious; fear is their predominant cha-
racteristic; doubt and hesitation mark their con-
duct; the dark side of the cloud is alone seen
by
them ; difiiculties are
imagined, where none exist ;
trials are fabricated from the simplest circum-
stances; and life ceases to be chequered with good
and evil : for every point is encompassed with more
or less of sorrow, and the heart is sad, in the midst
of every cause of rejoicing. Now, let such a
mind be deeply imbued with religious truth; and
its prevailing natural tinge will be still discernible;
humanly speaking, its way will be marked by
tears, and closely attended by fear; despair will
haunt its footsteps, and it will be well, if sound-
ness of mental manifestation be not the price of a
too exclusive devotion to one
particular idea. This
state may sometimes be removed by causes acting
on the body; but it has continued through life,
and even up to the moment of dissolution; the
departing Christian has remained under a cloud
of bodily infirmity, till he has exchanged all that
is mortal and material, for all that is immortal and
immaterial; and has entered into that light, where
his sun shall no more
go down, neither shall the
moon withdraw her shining. The night of physical

infirmity has brooded over the evening of his life,
with her sable wing; and he has walked on in
darkness, assailed by the wintry storm of ad-
versity, in the long night of seeming absence from
his God, encompassed by uncertainty, attended by
unreal and imaginary dangers, and conscious
of being surrounded by foes to his well-being,
whose power over him appeared to increase in
proportion as his hands hung down. But still he
has been enabled to maintain a
princnoled persever-
ance; and a
glorious day will suddenly break
upon him, when he shall have escaped from the
burden of materiality, and shall have rested from
his labours, by having entered into the joy of his
Lord. This, then, is the criterion; not, does
the Christian rejoice in his path? but does he
walk in it consistently, reaching onward, and still
onward, after greater conformity to Christ ? If so,
he will continue to advance, though he may not
perceive it, and although to his last hour he may
consider himself as wanting in the essential matter
of christian joyfulness. The Christian is com-
manded to rejoice, and he has reason to do so,
apart from physical infirmity, provided that he is
really pursuing the great object of his life; but
as well may it be expected that the blind should
see, or the deaf hear, as that the Christian, pos-
sessed of a melancholic temperament, should always
rejoice: the command, like many others, is given
to those who can receive it, but not to him; if he
rejoice at all, it is when spirit triumphs over an
organ unsuited for the manifestations of joy-or,

in other words, when mind obtains the supremacy
over matter, and the agency of physical tempera-
ment is subjugated by the halcyon iniiuence of
the Holy Spirit of God. This state of continued
gloom was
exemplified in one of the instances
above mentioned,--G. K., who was remarkable for
her exemplary conduct, but who, during a
period
of twenty, or even more
years, considered herself as
lost; and never
being able to realize a
self-appro-
priating interest in the finished righteousness of
her Redeemer, died without enjoying /wpe, though
always clinging to the Rock of Ages;
IV. In these views, there is also ground to
check the presumptuous, and to arrest the self-
willed devotee of feeling.
There are characters, whose physical temperament
is so constituted, that the cloud of doubt scarcely
ever crosses the serene atmosphere of their tranquil
joys: to these everything looks bright_their present
position, and that of those around them, is the best
and the most favoured; their sanguine views are
scarcely ever disturbed by the storm ofdissatisfaction,
or
by the hesitation of fear, or
by the uncertainty of
doubt. Faith, it is true, is the gift of God; and
it may be communicated in very varying measure
to different individuals; but a
great apparent dis-
tinction may very generally dcpend upon that kind
of physical constitution which naturally prompts
agreater display of the principle in one than in
another; so that the same amount of spiritual
faith shall exhibit very different traces, according
to the physical temperament through which these

traces are descried. In those in whom there
seems to be a
predominance of the principle, it
will be found that their feelings are
easily excited,
and that they possess at all times a warmth of
character which admirably fits them for zeal and
activity on the great theatre of christian exertion,

Yet let caution attend their path ; let them recol-
lect how uncertain a

pursuit of the solid results of deliberate judgment;
let them not be high-minded, but fear; let them
not congratulate themselves that their mountain
standeth strong, while it is in any degree based
on an arm of Hesh ; let them inquire /ww mucluof
natural or
physical energy of character attends
their exertions; how much their lively views are
depending upon the sanguine constitution of their
physical temperament; how much their peace and
joy are connected witl1 the integrity oi" their nerv~
ous system; and let them earnestly pray and
strive to be kept humble and dependent, and to
be preserved from being exalted above measure by
the abundance of their hopes; let them, moreover,
learn to look charitably upon those who are not
thus abundantly gifted; let them not rashly con-
sider these as
necessarily possessing a smaller pro-
portion of faith, but as being perhaps less furnished
by nature with the means for its manifestation;
above all, let them avoid a
degree of unsteadiness
of character, so
frequently attaching to this kind
of physical constitution, if allowed its unlimited

range, and which really only forms the material
and the temporary tenement of that immaterial
spirit which will hereafter know all things.
V. The consideration of this subject should
stimulate the feeble and the languid.
If the immortal principle be thus dependent for
its manifestations upon the incumbrances of mate-
riality, still it must be recollected that this forms
no excuse for indolence, or lukewarmness, or
supine
proceeding. For although the operations of mind
may be influenced by matter, it must never be
forgotten that this matter is again capable of being
acted upon by mind; that it is subjected to the
laws of habit and association; and that an
organ
remarkable for its defective formation now, may
by them, and by a
powerful qfect of volition, be
carried to a
degree of energy and perfection which
could not at first have been calculated upon ; that
which is diflicult to-day, may, through the blessing
of God upon christian vigilance and exertion, be
rendered presently attainable; and, after a time,
become so habitual, as to be accomplished without
effort. Duty is the atmosphere we breathe; and
pursuit the very life-blood of christian existence.
When once man
begins to vegetate, he drops the
noble attribute of his character; whenever he can
be satisfied with present attainments, there is an
end of his usefulness and value; he must never be
contented, unless the character of his day, and of
every one of his days, be that of progress ! True,
it may be slow; but still it muSt be advancing, or
he cannot be holy or
happy. If he is feeble and

languid ; if he is less capable of exertion than some
of his more highly-gifted neighbours, it is only a
motive to inspire him with greater energy of pur-
pose, that he may make up by increased exertion
for this apparent loss of power; and let him re-
member that God giveth more grace, not to the
indolent, but to the humble and diligent inquirer.
Let him propose to himself, for imitation, the cha-
racter of Christ ; in it will be traced this attribute
of progressive exertion. And let him feel assured,
that although others with more splendid talents
may outstrip him in his course, yet that Christ
delights to dwell with the humble; that He carries
the lambs in his bosom, and gently leads those that
are with young; and that the reward is promised
not to the gift of brilliant talent, but to the perse-
vering exertion of sincere desire.

I. The brain is the organ of mind.
II. Mind is possessed by man in common with
the lower animals.
III. In man, however, there is this grand dis-
tinction, that he possesses a
spiritual principle su-
peradded to animal mind; of which his enlarged
brain is equally the organ.
IV. But the brain is the servant of mind.
V. As such, man is minutely responsible for all
his acts and deeds, since it is the spiritual moral
principle which gives laws to organisation, and not
organisation which gives laws to spiritual manifes-
tation. _
VI. The doctrines of phrenology may be true,
but are not proven; they are unimportant to the
present discussion; since, if the brain be divisible
into a multitude of organs, they will all come
under the one general law above expressed.

many of its professors, and tl1e materialism to

which they lead, are
equally unphilosophical and
untrue.
VIII. There is a law of essential progression en-
stamped upon man's history; and deprived of this
constant progress, he cannot fulfil the great end of
his being.
IX. This essential progression is dependent,
partly, upon mental experience; partly, upon the
increased aptitude of the organ for conducting its
functions. -
X. Man is a
free agent: he can,'if he will,
choose the good, and refuse the evil; but' that will
may be, and generally is, perverted: and at all
events this function of volition is under a number
of sinister influences.
Xl. This free agency may exist in ignorant
or in enlightened man; but in the former it will
be limited by prejudice and passion; in the latter
it will be guided and governed by the education of
the organ, by moral and religious principles and
motives, and by the influences of the Holy Spirit.
XII. These motives and principles are
dependent
on that future state of rewards and punishments,
which awaits mankind according to the deeds done
in the body, and which forms a
part of revealed
truth, being also perfectly consistent with the
analogy of nature.
XIII. The morbid manifestations of mind, which
are
generally termed "
mental diseases," are de-
pending upon corresponding states of the brain,
as the organ of mind.
XIV. The mind has a wonderful influence upon

the body, both in its sound and disordered con-
ditions; and it is necessary to consider well this
influence, in order to maintain the perfect integrity
of both, and their reciprocal dependence.
XV. The body, that is, the physical tempera-
ment, at all times, and especially its peculiar state
at the moment, has an
extraordinary influence upon
the manifestations of mind; and due allowance
should be made for this influence.
XVI. Nevertheless, as mind is supreme, and body
subordinate; and as the will is that function through
which mind and body are to be governed, man
continues responsible for all his actions, thoughts,
and feelings; and his physical temperament is
never to be admitted as a
ground of exemption,
from certain moral obligations which remain inde-
structible, always the same, and invariably opera-
tive.
XVII. The whole of the foregoing discussion
must be reviewed in order to form ajust concep-
tion of the relative and reciprocal influence of mind
and matter.
