I went into a sudden coma as I was walking along on the street. It happened in Barcelona, on a central street and near the Medical Hospital and the fire station. I fell to the ground as if dead, with complete loss of consciousness. After a while, a firefighter, recognizing the symptoms of hypoglycemic coma, took me to the hospital's Emergency Room. There they performed the necessary treatment. During all this time, I was unconscious and my blood sugar level had dropped to nearly zero. Upon hearing the voice of a few female doctors, among many others (my room appeared full of people although I did not see them) - 'He's returning, he's returning!' - I felt disgust.

And that's the part that is difficult to explain. Everyone sees lights and tunnels. Not me. My experience was, in a certain way, the inverse of this. From the sensation of disgust, I instinctively deduced (no means of rationalization whatsoever) that I had come back from a dark and silent world - but a happy one. Something like being in your mother's womb. I realize it's not a common experience, but it's mine. That day I totally lost the fear of death. There were no judges, nor reprimands, nor a review of your errors. I simply passed onto something similar to a purely spiritual hibernation.
