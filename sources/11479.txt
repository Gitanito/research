It took them over five minutes to get me out. 

In the meantime, I was watching them from up above, I heard all they said and saw all they did. I asked them later if that what I had seen and heard was accurate. Two emergency medical technicians were there. They told the others three or four times, 'He's dead.' I suddenly got a big breath of air and was back in my body.

It took me two years to learn to walk again, I saw no lights, just was up there looking down on the guys working on me, they were already talking about who was going to go tell my wife I was dead. I have been in a lot of pain since then.
