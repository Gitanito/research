  		              		Experience Description   

  The experience is hard to convey into words, so I'll do my best to describe.
  
    In the Spring of 2005, I had a heart attack while I was building a birdhouse with my children. I'm only alive because my young daughter called 911 after I went unconscious. I had a stent placed in the right ventricle. The heart specialist told me, that it was 'touch and go' and I was 'lucky to be alive.' 

  During the heart attack, I was not able to breathe.  I felt my heart beating slower and slower when I heard my children crying out to me.  Then there was darkness. I felt my being or 'consciousness' being pulled into a dark void. My first thought and feeling was curiosity.  I wondered if this was what Elvis felt when he died. Then, I was angry and thought that Death was a sorry excuse for a being since he couldn't come at me face-to-face.  He had to sneak up from behind to get me this way. Then I contemplated that I was dying. As I accepted this, I felt a presence that told me I was dying and that it was going to be ok. In this void, I felt no pain.  I had a relaxing feeling, that was pleasant in a weird sort of way. I was still able to think and was aware that I was in a place and that I was not alone.
  
  I felt the presence of a Being of pure love and acceptance. This feeling of unconditional LOVE is overwhelming. This presence felt familiar, like I have always known this Being.  I thought to the Being, 'I do not want to die in front of my children. I couldn't do that to them.' 

I then became fully conscious as I heard one of the paramedics saying, 'Have a blood pressure 40 over 20.'
