interestingly there was a man on my
Executive Committee it was a very
well-known actor and singer named
borough lives and borough live he was a
33rd degree Mason so all of you people
who think that all these secret
societies everyone in it knows
everything they don&#39;t know anything and
he said to me because we all know that
Marilyn Monroe didn&#39;t die above overdose
boo-boop-ee-doo he said do you know why
they killed Nora this doesn&#39;t the late
Marilyn Monroe and I said well I didn&#39;t
until I got this document it&#39;s a virtual
death warrant because she was found a
couple days later three August 1962
wiretap of telephone conversations
between reporter Dorothy Kilgallen who
was looking into Roswell and other UFO
issues and her close friend Howard
Rothberg from wiretap of telephone
conversation of Marilyn Monroe and
attorney general Bobby Kennedy Rothberg
discussed the apparent comeback of the
subject with Kilgallen and the breakup
with the Kennedys this is referring to
the fact that Marilyn Monroe had been
having an affair with not one but both
Kennedy brothers and it was becoming
conspicuous so they broke it off
Rothberg indicated in so many words that
she had secrets to tell no doubt arising
from her tryst with the president and
the Attorney General once a secret
mentions the visit of the president at a
secret air base for the purpose of
inspecting things from outer space now

true would be a terrible embarrassment
for Jackie and his plans to have NASA
put men on the moon we choose to go to
the moon in this decade and do the other
things not because they are easy but
because they are hard
the such a creatively called the
Attorney General and complained about
the way she was being ignored by the
President and his brother subject
threatened to hold a press conference
and would tell all it&#39;s a tragic
situation because she was an actress who
didn&#39;t understand the national security
state and the viciousness of those who
want to keep these sort of secret
