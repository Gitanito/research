  		              		Experience Description   

    In a drunken stupor, I was lying on the floor. I was barely conscious and  recognized that I had stopped breathing. As my brain was no longer functioning correctly, I was unable to send the 'breathe' message to my body to get it to take the next breath. At that time, I made a conscious decision to let go and die. Upon making the decision, I briefly saw colored static,  felt vibration, and then I was in the black void.
  
  I became my thoughts and memories floating in a black void. I had no body. I could think and had memories of my life. I was completely and frighteningly alone. There was no sound and time did not exist. Snapshots of my life floated by but they had lost all their meaning to me. I had to let all emotional attachment go from the individual people and memories, but I had a general feeling of being incredibly sad and very much alone. At one point, I wondered how long I had been in the void. I could have been floating there for 1000 years or maybe it was 3 minutes, but it seemed to me for about a 1000 years.
  
  When I woke up in the morning, I didn't just wake up. I was aware of my consciousness rushing at light speed, back into my body and I woke with a start. My first thought was astonishment to be alive and to have left the void. I couldn't believe it. I was shocked and I felt terrified. 
  
  I was disoriented thinking, 'What happened? What happened? What happened? Where am I? What was that? Is that it? Am I supposed to understand something from it?'
  
  The aloneness was so sad it was painful.
