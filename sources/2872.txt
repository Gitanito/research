PREAMBLE
In this brochure, I speak to a point of Personal Privilege, to
legions of friends; to the many thousands of loyal students throughout
the land who have accepted me as their teacher, occult guide, and
spiritual adviser; to almost a million readers who have purchased
and read my books during the past thirty years, and to all occultists,
mystics, occult tea.chers, and leaders of the several Secret Schools of
White Magic, with whom I enjoy the most cordial fraternal relations.
This brochure has been prepared for the special aid and benefit
of all those who are truly interested in real Rosicrucianism, and who
are sincerely seeking the way to the Door of the Temple of the Rosy
Cross. If such sincere seekers do not find the path that leads to the
right Door of the real Temple, may that which is said herein be
sufficient to guide them safely away from the Beguiling snares of the
cleverest charlatan of this day, that leads to the trap door and pitfall
of a commercial enterprise and family racket conducted in tire holy
name of the Rose Cross,
As is well known, I am by profession, a physician as well as the
official head of 'the authentic Rosicrutian Organization in America.
In the Journal of the American Medical Association, issue of Decem­
ber 15, 1923, there appeared an article in which lire attempt was
made, by the clever use of strong insinuations, plausible implications
and subtle innuendos, to connect me with frauds, medical quackery
and disreputable medical colleges. It criticized severely many of my
medical teachings and practices; with scorching sarcasm, belittling
references, and villifying defamation it essayed to pronounce the last
benediction on my professional career.. Happily, however, it was a
misdirected effort and did not have the intended effect. Instead of
being a final rite of benediction, it proved to be a splendid profes­
sional benefaction.
Fortunately, I have never participated in any fro.ud or know­
ingly encouraged such practices. I loathe crooked dealing and uon-
ethical conduct. My so-called “quackery” has become recognized
practice in the regular school. My alleged connections with dis­
reputable medical colleges may he fully explained, and when the
actual facts are known, there is—there can be—no condemnation.
The article was written for the purpose of preventing the forma­
tion of a rival medical association and afforded the A. M. A. a splen­
did opportunity to release its pent up spiteful feelings of revenge
against several doctors, as well as myself, who had dared to vigor-
4 An Answer To Mr, Lewis and th e A. M. A.
ously oppose them— especially their pet project of compulsory
vaccination.
Professionally, I ignored the article. Upon its face, it. carried
its own answer, which all medical and professional men fully under­
stood. While not so intended, it made me professionally. It greatly
increased the sale of medical books, especially my hooks on Dietetics,
and consultations with other doctors immediately increased. A host
of doctors, far and near, became my friends; my fraternal circle in
the profession was widened, and the fraternal ties, that bind, were
made secure. It established my professional standing upon a firm
and solid basis.
Not long ago, a unique impostor, with a rare genius for the
successful manipulation of all the subtle wiles of the deceptive arts,
with an astute knowledge of publicity and with a singular system
of high pressure salesmanship, fabricated, instituted, and has since
maintained for private gain, a wholly spurious rosicrucian organiza­
tion. This resourceful charlatan and mountebank extraordinary has
mislead, deceived, and defrauded thousands. He has numbered his
victims and counted his accomplishments alike among the poor,
gullible and ignorant; as well as the learned, rich, wise, and other­
wise. As a propagandist, he is the past master superior, excelling
yet unexcelled. He has deceived the most astute editors of authorita­
tive dictionaries, encyclopedias, and books of reference. Likewise
publishers of high class newspapers and magazines. He has made
dupes of them all. And, all alike have permitted him to use their
publications as free vehicles for his subtle, yet false and insidious,
propaganda.
Being the official head and Supreme Grand Master of the
genuine and authentic Fraternity, Order, Brotherhood and Temple
of Rosicrurians in America, none wrere in a better position than I
to know that the aforesaid so-called rosicrucian order ivas and is a
gigantic swindle, so skillfully designed, so cleverly operated, and so
ingeniously and cunningly hidden beneath a velvet veneer of intrigu­
ing' mystery, plausible deception, and almost perfect camouflage, as
to deceive others not so well advised on Rosicrucian affairs.
It, therefore, became ray duty to direct attention to the truth and
the facts concerning this spurious rosicrucian organization, to advise
and warn all interested parties. This I have done from time to time.
Only recently in several booklets, afterward republished in a per­
manent bound volume,* in the interest of truth and for the benefit
of all who are interested in Rosicrurianism, or the August Fraternity

An Answ er To Mr. Lew is and the A. M. A. 5
— for tliose who have been misled, and for those who are likely to
be misled by the seductive wiles of this master fabricator, shrewd
propagandist, and remarkable swindler. I exposed his methods and
his racket-—the most remarkable of its kind.
' He could not answer the diarges preferred, or face the facts
presented. So, he resorted, among other ruses, to the ancient artifice
long employed by the shrewd and crafty, namely: “When you cannot
face the facts, then direct attention away from the facts, create con­
fusion by making a vigorous, vicious personal attack, on the informer.”
Therefore, he is using the article in the Medical Journal in connection
with his planned and systematized campaign of personal abuse and
vilification against me as strategic subterfuge in lieu of facing the
facts.
feeing that this pseudo-occult swindler is thus using the article
to shield himself and as a means to perpetuate his racket, 1 shall
make reply to the article and full explanations concerning all matters
therein stated.
1 am not a destructionist I would not destroy that which is
good and righteous. However, whenever it is necessary to raise my
voice and to use my efiorts-to-right a. wrong and to protect the inno­
cent, I do not hesitate, or falter.
True it is, that I dislike to criticize and attack the pet plans and
projects of another in which others are interested— even though they
have been, deceived and beguiled—because it generally means war
with the victims whom the charlatan uses to defend himself. I
disdain it because I am a lover of peace, but not peace at any price.
Yet, when I see well-meaning men and women making a pet out of
’ a snake-in-the-grass, kneeling to its siren charms and bareing their
breasts to the poison of its fangs, I am compelled to sound a warn­
ing. This 1 have done—none could do less.
Fraternally submitted,
R. SWINBURNE CLYMER. ■

H. Spencer Lewis And His Spurious
AMORC
In the year 1915, H. Spencer Lewis, without Rosicrucian
authority, fabricated and instituted a spurious Rosicrucian organiza­
tion. which he has been and is now conducting, as a private business
enterprise under the trade name of AMORC. November 15, 1928,
he incorporated this family enterprise in the state of California under
the corporate name of the Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC. The
incorporators and trustees were H. Spencer Lewis, his wife, his son,
his son’s wife and Charles D. Dean. On September 1, 1930, he
filed an amendment to the charter changing the name of the corpora­
tion to The Supreme Grand Lodge of the Ancient and Mystical Order
Rosae Crucis, and vesting the absolute control and total voting power
of the corporation, in the board of trustees, by the following provision
quoted verbatim from a certified copy of said charter, viz:
“Eighth: The total voting power of this corporation
shall be in said trustees and any three of their number shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of ail business of
the corporation."
A FAMILY AFFAIR
This corporation owns all of .the property of AMORC. It is
a closed corporation composed solely of H. Spencer Lewis and his
family, and is governed by a board of five trustees, headed by
H. Spencer Lewis, with his wife, his son, the son’s wife and Clement
Le Brun, one of his handy men. The paying members of AMORC
are not members of and have no interest in or control of the property
of AMORC, although it belongs to them. It is owned by a corpora­
tion which is controlled absolutely by H. Spencer Lewis and his
family. There is an unincorporated subsidiary body under the in­
corporated Supreme Grand Lodge, known as the “Grand Lodged”
which owns no property, to which the membership at large belongs.
The initiation fees, contributions, and monthly dues paid by those
who have joined this enterprise do not go to the unincorporated Grand
Lodge to which they belong, but to the incorporated Supreme Grand
Lodge controlled by H. Spencer Lewis and his family. Although it
purports upon its face to be a fraternal organization and is so con-
8 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
ducted as to give it the plausible appearance of a mutual fraternal
organization, it is simply a family enterprise for the support and
aggrandizement of H. Spencer Lewis and family.
A GIGANTIC SWINDLE
However, it is more than a family enterprise; it is a most
■plausibly designed fraudulent scheme and gigantic swindle. With
this cleverly organized device, conducted under the trade mark-.
"AMORC,” falsely represented to be the perpetuation and continua­
tion in America of the original and authentic Rosicrucian Order or
Brotherhood. During the past 20 years, H. Spencer Lewis has
deceived thousands and defrauded them of millions of dollars.
Although he calls himself the Imperator of the Rosicrucian Order,
jurisdiction of North America, he is not a Rosicrucian. His family
enterprise carried on under the trade marked name of “AMORC—-
Rosicrucian Order” and other Rosicrucian names and appellations,
is not a genuine Rosicrucian organization.
From time to time, we have warned sincere seekers of the Rosy
Cross, as well as the gullible and die curious against this fraud per­
petrated in the name of the Rosicrucians. Recently we issued booklets
and a permanent bound volume* thoroughly exposing this gigantic
swindle and the Lewis family racket, and also pointing the way to
the real, genuine and authentic Rosicrucian Order and Brotherhood
in America.
MR, LEWIS CANNOT FACE THE FACTS. HE RESORTS
TO SUBTERFUGE
Air. Lewis could not in fact and with truth answer. As a sub­
terfuge in the nature of a'reply, he printed a pamphlet which he
styles: White Book D filled with plausible falsehoods, ingenious,
cunning misrepresentations, expertly manufactured and mutilated
evidence and clever stratagems, which has the appearance of. an
answer, but which in fact is not an. answer at all.
Of course, my expose' of this fraudulent scheme and family
racket of Mr. Lewis made him rather angry and resentful. Albeit
he was without an honest straight-forward reply thereto, he resorted
to the age-old, yet clever, stratagem of making an indirect personal
attack on me to detract somewhat from the truth of our expose1 by

Foreword: [Mr. Lewis’ Statement]
The present day activities of this man consist almost
entirely in trying to wreck the real Rosicrucian organization,
known as the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC) with national
headquarters at San Jose, California.
He hopes that by putting it in a false light and causing
dissatisfaction among some of its members they will resign
and join his own organization.
His organization is a small one, is m reality anything
but Rosicrucian, and is housed in a farm house and barn
near Quakertown.*
For years, with manufactured “evidence” and innuendo
as his stock-in-trade, he has printed and flooded die country
with scurrilous booklets in his malicious campaign against
the Order and its chief executive officer. Of a particularly
revolting nature are three booklets being circulated by him
this year (1935).
Revealing himself unconsciously in his writings, he

deceives neither the members of the Order nor the general
public, especially editors, writers, researchers, and leaders
of oilier fraternities.
Nevertheless, something of a tangible nature should
help in circumventing this man in his career as a destruc-
tionist, and it is with this end in view that this authorita­
tive report on him has been brought to light. [End of Mr.
Lewis’ statement, here follows the article:]

The American Progressive Medical Association
Another Attempt to Organize the Twilight
Zone of Professionalism
From various parts of the country, the JOURNAL is
receiving requests for information about a new medical
organization calling itself the “American Progressive Medi-
cal--Association” and,having its “National Headquarters”
at Milwaukee, Wis. Physicians are receiving letters and
application blanks from the “President” of this new society
urging them to send in their application for membership
and the annual membership fee of $5.00. According to
the letterhead of the American Progressive Medical Asso­
ciation, which, by the way, is said to be incorporated, this
organization is “Impartial— Fearless—Progressive—Demo­
cratic.” It has a President, three Vice-Presidents, a Record­
ing Secretary, Corresponding Secretary, a Treasurer, and a
General Counsel-—to say nothing of an Editor and Gen­
eral Manager of its medical journal, the latter, apparently,
not yet bom. It has a “Council on Health and. Public
Instruction,” a “Council on Medical Education and Hos­
pitals,” a “Council on Scientific Research,” a “Council on
Pharmacy and Chemistry,” a “Council on Medical Legis-

Applicants for membership must “agree and stipulate”
that they will give their “moral support to Progressive
Therapeutics.” Furthermore, they “agree to stand firm
for National Reciprocity for all Licensed Physicians with--
out examination or any RED TAPE.”
When physicians ask TH E JOURNAL, as some have,
to inform them as to the “standings of the American Pro­
gressive Medical Association,” they are asking for the
impossible because the Association has not yet been in
existence a month. The best the JOURNAL can do is to
publish what material it has regarding the founders and
officers of this new organization. From this material, any
physician should be able to determine whether or not he
wishes to be associated with an organization so fathered:

SIMON LOUIS KATZOFF, M,D., Bridgeport, Conn.,
First Vice-President and Chairman of the Council on
Health and Public Instruction: (Note by copyist: Long
report to his discredit omitted for same reason given above).
R. SWINBURNE CLYMER, M.D., Quakertown, Penna.,
Second Vice-President: Our record fails to show that this
man was ever regularly graduated by any reputable medical
college. In a paid notice that appeared in Polk’s Medical
Directory of 1906, Clymer claims the degrees of “Ph.G.”
and “M.D.” He is classified as a “Physio-Medicist” and
a graduate of the Independent Medical College, Chicago,
1898. The Independent Medical College was a diploma
mill which sold diplomas to anyone who sent the cash. It
was finally declared a fraud by the federal authorities and
put out of business. In Polk’s directory for 1908, Clymer
is listed as an “Electro-Therapeutic Specialist.” In the;
same directory for 1912, he is given as a graduate of the
College of Medicine and Surgery, Chicago, 1911. Corre­
spondence with a one-time officer of-this extinct school
brought the statement that in 1911 Clymer “was granted
an ad eundem diploma” !
12 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
In 1903, Clymer was “Secretary and Manager” of the
“Twentieth Century Physio-Medical College,” a diploma
mill whose “Main Office” was a post-office bos in Guthrie,
Okla., and whose “Corresponding Department” was a post-
office box at Union City, Mich. Letters written to Clymer
■at Union City, Mich., were answered by him. on stationery
■bearing the same address, but mailed from Hatfield, Pa.
Through the efforts of THE JOURNAL (see issue of
October 1, 1904, P. 990), the post-office department at­
tempted to get a case on this fraud, but Clymer discovered
that the thing was being investigated and dropped that line
of endeavor. However, the diarter of the “college” was
cancelled by the State of Oklahoma in 1904. The name
of Henry J. Barton, of whom more later, appeared on the
stationery of the “college” as one of its attorneys.
In 1904, R. Swinburne Clymer conducted from Hat­
field, Pa., and Union City, Mich., “The International
Academy of the Natural and Sacred Sciences” and at the
same time exploited the “Elixir of Youth,” the “Water of
Life” and “Bioplasma.” The “International Academy of
the Natural and Sacred Sciences” offered a “course” in die
“Natural System of Healing” which proposed to enable
those taking the courses to “Treat Every Known Disease.”
Instruction was given on the mail-order plan and the de­
grees of “M.D.” and “D.O.” were granted. At the same
time, Clymer had offices at Allentown, Penna. Those who
wanted to take the “course” were told to “address the
Associated College, Union City, Mich.” and obtain a
“prospectus and full information.”
In this connection, it is of interest to refer to a fraud
order that was issued by the United States postal authori­
ties against “The Philosophers of the Living Fire” with
which R. S. Clymer was connected. It was operated from
Union City, Mich.,, .the “home” of Clymer’s “Associated
College.” The scheme consisted in obtaining money for
membership in this alleged society for “degrees” in the
“society.” The government investigated and found that the .
degrees were “simply devices for obtaining additional sums
of money from credulous persons.” The “Philosophers of
the Living Fire” was supposed to be a quasi-religious,
secret order with signs, grips, obligations, passwords, and
similar paraphernalia. Henry J. Barton, already referred
to in connection with the “Twentieth Century Physio-•

An Answer To M r. Lew is and the A. M. A.
Medical College,” was head of the concern and was known
as the “Reverent Supreme Grand Rabboni.” In October,
1905, the Philosophers of the Living Fire were extinguished
~ "by“
the fraud order which covered not cnly Barton but “Dr.
R. S. Clymer.” The fraud flared up again in 1917 and
was again extinguished by a second fraud order which
again covered the name of “Dr. R. S. Clymer.”
A testimonial credited to R. S. Clymer from Souder-
ton, Pa., appears in the advertising matter issued by the
“Institute of Physicians and Surgeons” of Rochester, N. Y.
It is to the effect that he has received the diploma from
this “institute” and “it is in every respect equal to my
medical or hospital diplomas.” It doubtless was. The
“Institute of Physicians and Surgeons” was a mail-order
swindle that was put out of business by the federal authori­
ties July 21, 1905. (See “Nostrums and Quackery,” Vol I,
page 407).
In 1910, R. Swinburne Clymer was exploiting the
“International System of Magnetic (Alchemic) Therapeu­
tics.” ' Advertisements were published stating that R. S.
Clymer had obtained a patent from Washington for an
apparatus for the magnetic treatment of diseases and that
a company was “being formed by Dr. Clymer and some
others interested.” This venture was an outgrowth of an
earlier scheme known as the “International System of
Direct Medication.”
Some of the later activities of Clymer concern another
organization, the “Rosicrucian Aid,” conducted from
“Beverly Hall,” Quakertown, Penna. One of the numer­
ous activities of this organization was that of issuing a
book on dietetics which is credited to “R. Swinburne
Clymer, College of Medicine and Surgery, 1902.” It will
be remembered that Clymer had claimed graduation in the
medical directories from the College of Medicine and
Surgery, 1911. \Ve have in our records still other informa­
tion regarding Clymer of a more personal character, winch
need not be gone into at this time.

A BRIEF REPLY TO THE FOREWORD
&Y MR. LEWIS
Mr. Lewis errors greatly. I am not seeking to wreck the real
Rosicrucian organization. I am seeking to preserve it in its pristine
purity and to protect its holy name against the unholy misuses to
which, he has subjected it. I am not seeking members from his
organization. By his sordid methods, he has disgusted thousands
with the name, very few if any of his members when they know and
fully realize the truth about his swindle and family racket will care
to have anything further to do with any organization designating
itself by any Rosicrucian'appellation. Therefore, few if any of his
victims will ever seek affiliation with the authentic order.
Mr. Lewis is quick to charge others with following his own
practices—he manufactures and mutilates evidence to give plausi­
bility to his swindle. When we produce the evidence proving it to
be a swindle, conceived in sordid selfishness and brought forth in
fraud and corruption, he charges that the real evidence is manu­
factured.
We trust that all interested readers will secure the three booklets
(they are free), which Mr. Lewis says are “of a particularly revolt­
ing nature." They contain much evidence and proof certain of his
revolting swindle and family racket.
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A. 15
My campaign has been solely against Mr. Lewis, his swindle
and fraudulent practices—not against his victims and members. It
has not been malicious. I have acted only in the interest of truth
and for the protection of the innocent.
Concerning the statement that our organization (the real Rosi-
crucian Fraternity) is housed in a farm house and bam, see our
reply to his “White Book D ” where he makes the same false state-
ment. Our reply will be sent without cost upon request. '
ANOTHER MISUSE OF THE A. M. A. ARTICLE
In the August (1935) issue of his mouthpiece THE ROSICRU-
CIAfif DIGEST, Mr. Lewis, “The Imperator,” writing under the
title: The Lighter Side of Life's Mysteries, on page 265, comment­
ing on the above quoted A. M. A. Journal Article says:
“We learned some time ago in a magazine published by
the American Medical Association of December 15, 1923,
that this man (meaning the writer), at one time was
connected with so-called schools of medicine which were
claimed to be genuine colleges of medicine or therapeutics,
and that he issued diplomas to others until legal, inter­
ference Stopped the system. In fact-, the medical magazine
alleges that he issued a diploma to himself from one of his
own medical schools■
before he had established it. Whether
his ideas were right or wrong does not concern us inasmuch
as the American Medical Association saw fit to condemn
him as a notorious fraud in the Journal for December 15,
1923.” (Italics ours).
It will be noted that Mr. Lewis is commenting on the above
quoted A. M. A. Journal Article. Nowhere in said article does the
A. M. A. allege, by inference, innuendo or otherwise, that I issued
a diploma to myself from one of my own medical schools before it
was established, nor has the .American Medical Association ever
seen fit to condemn me as a notorious fraud. (Again he accuses
others of doing what he has done—issuing diplomas to himself and
of being what he is— a notorious fraud). It is his own statement
which he cleverly attempts to attribute to the American Medical
Association and its Journal (another of his clever tricks). The state­
ment is absolutely and wholely false.
ALSO ANOTHER MISUSE OF THE A. M. A. ARTICLE
Only recently (1934), the Secretary of the Commonwealth of
16 Aw Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
Pennsylvania, with the assistance and advice of the Attorney General
of the Commonwealth, conducted a thorough and prolonged investi­
gation into the question of the right to the exclusive use of all Rosi-
crucian names, titles, terms, designations, and appellations on appli­
cations made under a Pennsylvania statute for the. Registration of
such names and appellations.
AMORC was a party to said ..proceedings. Mr. H. Spencer
Lewis, through his attorneys and a member of his. organization,
presented the claims of AMORC as. to its Roslcrucian authenticity
and his protest against the registration of Rosicrucian names, titles,
and appellations by the Randolph Foundation of the Authentic Rosi-
crucian Order in America,
As the Supreme Grand Master of the Authentic Rosicrucian
Order or organization in America (the said Randolph Foundation),
I presented the claims of our organization as to its authenticity and
superior rights to the exclusive use of all Rosicrucian names, titles;
arid appellations.
The issue was clearly and sharply drawn. The Secretary and
the Attorney General made a most complete, searching, and exhaus­
tive investigation of all issues raised, kept the proceeding open almost
a year, and gave Mr. Lewis and his spurious AMORC every possi­
ble opportunity and ample time to establish their claims and to justify
their protests. - -
AMORC NOT A ROSICRUCIAN ORDER
However, Mr. Lewis being entirely without proof of Rosicrucian
authenticity of Ids fabricated and spurious organization, and wholly
without justification for his protest against the registration of Rosi­
crucian names by the Randolph Foundation of the authentic Rose
Cross Order; in a futile attempt to confuse the issue, vainly hoping
to overcome the impregnable claims and right of the authentic order
by detracting attention from his own weakness—the absolute nothing­
ness of his claims, and his inability to justify his groundless protests;
introduced the above mentioned and quoted article from the A. M. A.
Journal in said proceedings, caused the same, to be read and used as
the basis of a vicious, malicious, acrimonious, rancorous, atrocious,
and wicked personal attack on the writer-—yet to no purpose—it
availed him nothing.
The Secretary and the Attorney General disregarded the mali­
cious personal attack and decided all issues solely upon their merits,
livery issue was decided in favor of the Authenticity of the Randolph
Foundation of the Rosicntcians in America and against Mr. Lends

and his spurious organization.*
THE ANSWER TO THE A. M. A. ARTICLE
Having made clear for you the motive for the use and the reason
for the circulation at this time, of multigraphed copies of said article,
1 shall answer fully and in detail every false charge, unfair insinua­
tion, damaging innuendo and statement therein made or contained.
I will also show the reason why the article was written, the purpose
it was intended to serve, why the writer of that article treated me in
such a spiteful, step-motherly fashion, and deliberately left inferences
and created innuendo not justified by the facts. However, before
making specific answer in detail to the A. M. A. Journal article, a
few matters of general observation, as a background may be helpful
as giving a better understanding of the specific reply thereto.
MY BACKGROUND
My forefathers migrated to Pennsylvania during the early
colonial ftays from Switzerland, near the German border, where the
Natura Physicians and Naturopathy were predominant. They be­
lieved iai the philosophy and efficiency of the natural systems' of
healing, and were liberals in politics and religion. One of my ances­
tors, George Clymer, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence
and a delegate to the Constitutional Convention from Pennsylvania.
At an early age, I became a student of the Occult Sciences and
a neophyte in the Order of the Rosy Cross. The Secret Schools, as
is well known to all of their neophytes and initiates, and as is also
generally known to students of mysticism and occultism, advise their
neophytes and followers against the use of warm-blooded meat,
. poisonous drugs and serums, or other animal inoculations.
With this background, nurtured in such a family tradition,
trained in an occult school, it is not at all strange that I should be
a liberal in religion and medicine and a Natura Physician.
The system of healing to which I subscribe and follow in my
practice was first known in this country as the Thomsonian or
Herbal System, then the Nature Cure, and later as the Physio-
Medical system.
I AN! A PHYSIO-MED1CALIST
A Physio-Medicist is a physician who does not use poison,
narcotics, harmful drugs, antitoxins, vaccines, serums, and putrified
*See our booklet The Right to the Exclusive Use of Rosicrucian Names
for a full account of all matters above mentioned.
18 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M, A.
genu laden animal inoculations in his systems. He employs the
constructive principle in Nature on the physical, emotional, mental
and spiritual planes of being. He treats causes, not effects and
symptoms of disease, with elementary natural ,remedies such as
water, heat, air, light, magnetism, electricity, etc; with chemical
remedies- such as diet, scientific food selection and combination, non-
poisonous medicines, herbal extracts and vito-chemical remedies,
and also with mechanical remedies such as corrective gymnastics,
massage, osteopathic manipulation, and surgery when indicated and
necessary. Pie also uses psychological methods such as normal sug­
gestion, emotional control, scientific relaxation, constructive thought
and methods of natural living. To such a physician, prevention of
disease is most important.
THE OCCULTIST AND PHYSICIAN
If the Physio-Medicist is also an Occultist, he will successfully
employ the finer, more potent forces and higher laws of Nature. He
will, in truth and in deed, possess a knowledge and skill akin to in­
tuition—and know the highest art of healing, health, and salvation.
He will be a Priest of Nature and an interpreter of her holiest
Mysteries—and will realize the highest ideal of the physician.
It is not my purpose here and now to discuss the relative merits
and demerits of the theory and practice to which I subscribe, as
compared with that of the Allopathic school of medicine, which has
become the dominant, hence the “regular” or “orthodox” school.
I have no quarrel with Allopathic Physicians. There is vastly
more to be learned than is known. It is charitable, reasonable, find
•just to say that no school of medicine, or of the healing arts, has
acquired a monopoly on wisdom, even though they have acquired
the factitious privilege to practice their theories to the exclusion of
all others, under and by virtue of special legislation and the arbitrary
special favor of governmental authority.
I have believed, and still dare to assert, that no one rightfully
has a commission to arbitrarily set up a standard, to cast a measur­
ing line and to say to all others: “Thus far shall thou go and no
further.” It is the unalienable right of everyone to do, without un-
necessaty and arbitrary restrictions, the work which is appropriate
to him, for which he has fitness and aptitude. The words of Augustin
of Hippo are replete with good sense and reasonable justice: “In
the things which are necessary, let there be unity; in those not
absolutely certain, let there be liberty; and in them all, let there be
charity.” There can be no genuine progress in science where these
are not. The Divine Art of Healing should have but a single ethic:

An Answer Tq Mu. Lewis and th e A. M. A. 19
To live in charity and- intellectual hospitality, doing to others as sue
desire them to do to us, and to all as we have the opportunity. This
is the Higher Law of Medicine and the Healing Arts.
It was because I entertain these fundamental convictions and
dared to vigorously assert them in the interest of and for the advance­
ment of die healing arts at the time when the persecuting political
.branch of die Allopathic school was gaining its ascendency by special
legislation and enforcing its views and theories by the authority of
law and special privilege of Governmental sanction, I incurred the
embittered resentment of the then management of the A. M. A., that
later found expression in the back-biting article now quoted and used
for still more unwordiy ends by Mr. Lewis.
THE BITTER CONTESTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION
THE A. M. A. FORMED
In this land of the free, as well as in the tyrannical lands of
kings and dictators, there has existed a dominant persecuting, politi­
cally minded branch of the medical profession intent in compelling
their bretliren to adopt their views and to practice according to their
dictation. They proposed to establish a hierarchy of Medicine to
which all must bow and pay due reverence, the regularity of which
must not be questioned and the theories, teachings, dogmas, doctrines
and practices must be accepted by all who would practice the divine
Art of Healing. To accomplish this object they proposed to grasp
and hold all lucrative medical offices in the Army and Navy; the
Civil Service and Hospitals; to man and control all medical regulat­
ing and licensing boards, and departments of health. To unite and
organize against all medical reform and independent practitioners,
to compel all healers and physicians to join with them end adhere
to their standards, or be excluded from fraternal courtesy and just
recognition as professional men—and driven from the field. Finally,
to completely regulate the medical profession and all healing arts by
law and enforce their views and practices upon the profession and
laity alike by special mandatory class legislation. Accordingly, a
conference was held in New York, in 1846, by which the American
Medical Association was brought into existence for this puipose.
OTHER MEDICAL SOCIETIES
At that time, there existed medical societies representing the
doctrines and fostering the practices of the Homeopathic, Eclectic,
Physio-Medical, and others. Although they differed in the theory
and practice, they were united in their opposition to class legislation
granting exclusive privileges to one class, of healers, or physicians,
s
r

.:
20 A n Answ er T o Mr. Lewis and the A. M. A.
to the exclusion of all others, to mandatory laws enforcing upon the
people their theories and practices, and to all legislation promoting
and fostering the intolerant spirit of medical monopoly.
With the organization of the American Medical Association, the
die was cast and the battle for supremacy and the control of the
medical profession and healing arts was waged with relentless vigor
and accumulating bitterness for more than a half century. At the
close of the nineteenth century when I entered the medical,school
and upon my professional studies, the American Medical Association
had almost succeeded in legislating out of existence all schools of
theory and practice, except the Allopathic School which it sponsored.
At that rime, the fight for compulsory vaccination was at the height
of its bitterness. Of this, I shall say more as I proceed.
Dr. Alexander Wilder, the classic scholar, profound philosoph
eminent physician and Rosicrucian in his History of Medicine, fr
the earliest historical period to the close of the nineteenth centu
in speaking of these contests within the medical profession 'says-
.
“We sometimes hear it pleaded that in the Healing Art
there should be no parries, no separate organizations. Man­
kind have a common interest in health and in the means
to preserve it. This pleading is plausible, and perfectly
consistent with that charity that seeketh not its own advan­
tage, but the welfare of others. But in the human consti­
tution, as in every department of Nature, there is a prin­
ciple of polarity, and an impulse to differentiation. One
class of human beings hold fast, sometimes almost convul­
sively, to what has been long esteemed and venerated; while
another is ready, and frequently even eager, to discover
what is new, and to bring it into possession. In a stale of
savagery, there may be little distinction in art; in the
civilized state there is certain to be differencing of effort
in evety direction. It is in the plurality of faculties, in
the variety of aspirations, the infinite extending of concep­
tions, that man is developed and perfected.”
“In the Art of Healing there is, accordingly, a multi­
plicity of methods to be brought into view, and with each
of them must come the modifying and even the discarding
of older notions and procedures. - With the bringing of
them into contiguity, there is very certain to follow collision,
degenerating into strife. Personal ambition and selfish

motive are likely to transcend philanthropy and love of
truth. There has been in every country and every historic
period an official Medical Practice, taking its sanctions
and theories from enforced authority. It boastfully claimed
to be ample for its purpose, and was characterized by
jealousy and intolerance of innovation. From the Shaman
of the Siberan village to the pretentious stickler for scien­
tific regularity, this has been the case. As in former
religious crusades and persecutions, the aim of the Civil
Power has been involved and employed without scruple to
arrest changes by the punishment of innovators. The
record of history in this respect in both 'hemispheres has
been far otherwise than humane or honorable. In every
new period, there have been demonstrated the shortcomings
of its predecessor, and instead of truth-loving candor, there
have been encountered derision, social proscription, perse­
cution, and even virtual outlawry.”
“In Europe the disciples of Hahnemann, and in
America the associates and followers of Beach and Thom­
son, breasted alike the torrents of calumny and proscription.
The Homeopathists, who bravely adhered to their convic­
tions, opened a New World, like Columbus, to subsequent
explorers and colonizers. Eclectic Medicine in America
was likewise characterized by a career of vigorous protest
and earnest endeavor. It was an enthusiasm not to be
.y .measured by common understanding. Its champions labored
j, to develop a practice of Medicine, not cosseted and fenced
about by special legislation, but having its foundations
planted upon its intrinsic usefulness, without factitious
privileges, always open to new light, and still retaining
tenaciously the principles to which it owes its inception and
continued existence.” (Pages 884-885).
“Even now, with all the boasted learning of our
Modem Time, the diversities of opinion in medical circles
•• are innumerable. There are sects and schools of practice,
j even where there exists arbitrary authority and sentiment

have the sanction of men standing high in the medical
profession. Yet the conservatism of established bodies of
men is so great as to induce resistance, even to ferocious
violence, to changes deserving of a welcome. New views
are generally first denounced as false, afterward derided
as of little importance, and eventually accepted with the
■ assertion that they had always been the property of the
profession. The first promulgators, however, are seldom
included in such favorable reception.” (Pages VI and
VII, Foreword).
In the light of the foregoing, and the facts, conditions, and
situations existing at the times referred to in the A. M. A. Journal
article, we may proceed to deal with it fairly, intelligently, and under-
standingly.
THE ARTICLE MISCONCEIVED AND UNNECESSARY
The article was a misconception and not based upon facts and
the truth so far as I was concerned. That is also probably true
insofar as it applies to the individual doctors therein referred to,
ridiculed, and no doubt unjustly criticized. I was not a member, or
officer, of the American Progressive Medical Association;' A short
time prior to its attempted formation, Dr. Larson, of Milwaukee,
wrote me about forming a liberal and progressive medical associa­
tion. I replied that I believed the conditions and general situation
unfavorable and the time inopportune. Therefore, I refused to lend
my aid to the undertaking. Notwithstanding, Dr. Larson went for­
ward with his futile and unsuccessful plans and had propaganda,
literature, and letterheads printed with my name set forth as “second.
Vice-President.” This was done without my knowledge or consent.
I was in no way interested in that movement and had: nothing to do
with it. v b:
The A. M. A. advised of the attempt to organize a rival pro­
gressive and liberal association, ever jealous of all rivals and deter­
mined to stamp out, in its very inception, all possible rivalry, re­
sorted to the undignified and questionable method, to say the least, of
making caustic personal attacks on those of its professional brethren
who were connected, or supposed to be connected, with the movement.
The bitter attack was as unnecessary as it was unjustified. The
movement gained no headway and never had an actual existence as
a functioning organization.
MY POSITION STATED
Before proceeding further, I desire to state my position, ideas,
...’: M
l
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A. 23
and ideals as they relate to the healing arts, medical profession,
medical education, schools, and associations. I believe that every
healer and physician, regardless of the system practiced, should be
fully prepared, learned and highly efficient in his art. I hold no
brief for “diploma mills,” fraudulent and inefficient schools, and
have no sympathy with those who would lower the standards of
professional training and education, or who would, in any way or
by any means, evade the full measure and highest standard of the
professional responsibility of the physician.
The public health and general well-being of mankind are pre­
cious, and should be duly guarded and protected. I believe that the
medical profession should be carefully regulated to high standards
and increasingly higher standards of efficiency, and that none should
be licensed to practice the healing arts who are not fully prepared to
efficiently treat, cure, and prevent disease and safeguard the health
of those for whom he renders professional service. But I do not
believe that one school has the right to regulate the profession to its
own selfish advantage, to the exclusion or disadvantage of other or
all other schools, some of which may be more desirable and efficient.
I am unalterably opposed to a medical monopoly that arrogantly
establishes a dictatorship over the profession, stifles individual
genius, and retards scientific progress by refusing to recognise all
innovations, however meritorious, that do not conform to their own
preconceived ideas.
I believe in medical freedom, with qualified practitioners, un­
hampered and unshackled; and that professional colleges of all
schools of theory and practice of the healing arts should be estab­
lished and maintained to the highest possible standards of progres­
sive efficiency.
I have always^ opposed the policy of the A. M. A. of forcing its
theories and practices by compulsory legislation, its monopolistic ten­
dencies, its attempts at professional dictatorship, its practices of
personally attacking brethren of the profession who have dissented
from its conclusions and who have refused to bow to its dictation.
1 cannot accept the Allopathic theory and practice of medicine which
it fosters; however, I am in accord with its policy of professional
training and medical education. It has raised these standards, for
which it deserves due credit and high commendation.
In. the early days of my practice, I associated myself with move­
ments for the establishment of Physio-Medical colleges, which I
hoped would develop into strong colleges of high educational stand­
ards, with a complete curriculum, a highly specialized staff, and
adequate equipment to graduate high class, learned, efficient and
24 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
skillfull Physio-Medicists. Those attempts failed, because, unfor­
tunately, there were some associated with those undertakings who
were not willing to subscribe to and support such high standards.
In the later years of my practice, I have been solicited and
urged to assist in the organization of independent, liberal, and pro­
gressive associations. I believe in such an Association. It is certain
that such an organization, or society, if committed to the maintaining
of the..same strict, high standard of medical education as the A. M. A.
would serve a beneficent and most useful purpose. So far I have,
of recent years, refused to join, in, or to encourage such movements
and shall continue to do so until the time arrives when the indepen­
dent, liberal, and progressive practitioners can unite their efforts into
a harmonious movement on high educational as well as progressive
standards.
VINDICATION
We, the physicians of liberal tendencies, of the Thorusonian,
Natura and Physio-Medical school, who are seeking no earthly
glory, who have not pinned upon our breasts ambitions’ worthless
badge, and who are more interested in the welfare of mankind and
the service we may render to and for our fellovvmen, have been con­
tent to see the physicians of the Allopathic school abandon many of
their own fundamental .pet theories and to adopt in lieu thereof, the
major, fundamental, and basic principles of the Physio-Medicists,
which the majority of their physicians are generally using today in
their practice, and which less than fifteen years ago the A. M, A. was
denouncing and ridiculing. It was not then alone sufficient to de­
nounce- and ridicule our system and our remedies, it was also deemed
necessary to villify and belittle, to make personal and sarcastic attacks
on the personnel of our school, who were active in promoting its
doctrines and practices.
There is, indeed, justified gratification in the silent, tacit admis­
sion by the Allopathies of the correctness of the principles of our
practice, even though they have adopted them as their own without
due acknowledgment. Within this fact is found sufficient reward
for our labors, and a measure of compensation for all the abuse that
the A. M, A. has unjustly heaped upon us.
“REGULARITY”
The A. M, A. has attacked me personally; reviled, ridiculed,
: and persecuted me. It has declared me “irregular” because I have
dared to think for myself, because I have opposed some of its
policies and have refused to accept its theory of medicine—yet I

Registration of certificate of graduation in the State of Arkansas.
have always been regular—more so than most of its members. I have
lived up to the highest ethics and noblest precepts of the profession.
My professional brethren who know me personally and those who
have followed my career, know this to be true. I have never attacked,
or assisted in the persecution of any physician of any school. I have
been as liberal in my conduct towards my professional brethren as
I have been in my professional views. I may have disagreed with
some of them, they may have been right or wrong, they have the
same right to their opinion as I to mine. I have always granted to
them the same rights and the free exercise thereof as freely as I
have vigorously fought to preserve it for myself and future genera­
tions. I have always revered the physician as God’s greatest servant
to humanity and one of our greatest blessings. Therefore, I enjoy
the personal esteem, fraternal regard and association of Doctors of
all schools of thought and practice.
WHY THE ARTICLE WAS IGNORED
The highest ideal of the physician is service— service that aids
and blesses mankind—unequivocal, unabating, unselfish service. In
the last and final analysis, if a doctor fails to cure the sick, to take
proper and satisfactory care of his patients, and to render service
to the community in which he resides and labors, he is not a physi­
cian and deserves no professional standing. Having lived up to the
highest ideals of the physician, my professional reputation was not
and could not be injured, in the realms in which I have labored and
served, by the petty insinuating condemnation of that article.
All physicians know and fully understand the coercive and
26 An Answer T o Mr. L ew is and the A. M. A. j
vindictive tactis often employed by the A. M. A.— until very recently j
—to coerce and punish doctors. It proved to be bad policy and has, !
.
I trust, been abandoned. Let it be said for the profession that very }
few members of the A. M. A., Or doctors generally, endorsed such J
methods. Doctors understanding such articles, generally cast them ]
:
aside as unworthy of serious consideration, therefore, my standing \
within the profession, as a doctor, or individual, was not injured, \
As a matter of fact, the article proved to be a professional blessing, j
It greatly enlarged the sphere of my personal acquaintance. Since \
then and now, many physicians of the "regular’' or Allopathic school,
in good standing, consult me and call me into consultation on cases \
relating to diet, direct medication, magnetic therapeutics,. and cn- 1
docrinology.
WHY THE ARTICLE IS ANSWERED NOW |
For the reasons above indicated, the article has thus far been j
treated with well deserved silent contempt, and (until now), has j
remained unanswered. As long as it stayed within the profession, j
■it did not matter and inquired no reply. However, ,.nce it has been j
j seized upon by a dangerous charlatan, the Baron Munchaussen of i
the Occult, and has been and is being widely circulated over the f
; United States among the laity as the basis of a vindictive personal j
. attack in connection with matters in which but few of the medical
profession are interested, I shall answer it not so much from the
viewpoint of a physician, for brethren of my profession, but almost
solely for the benefit and information of students of the Occult,
members of secret schools, fraternities, and especially those interested
in the Rosicrucian Fraternity.
Mr. Lewis is using it as a smoke screen to obscure his operation
'.of a clandestine, spurious, and fraudulent so-called Rosicruciau
organization; to discredit the writer, as the Supreme Grand Master
of the authentic Rosicrucian Order and Brotherhood in America, who ■
'has exposed this gigantic swindle.
Such unholy and despicable use of this article will be con­
demned by laity and physician alike—even the Management of the [
A. M. A. will resent such use of its back-biting wares. To the end
that Mr. Lewis may not accomplish his unworthy purpose and use
the article as a means of diverting attention away from his fraudu­
lent scheme and family racket, we make full explanation of and
reply to the article in the Journal of the American Medical Associa­
tion of December 15, 1923.

An Answer T o Mr. Lew is and the A. M. A..
PHILOSOPHERS OF THE LIVING FIRE
HENRY J. BARTON AND THE
POSTAL FRAUD ORDER
1 made the acquaintance of Heniy J. Barton (now deceased),
about the year 1897, through correspondence. T ie had a deep and
profound knowledge and understanding of the Occult Sciences. He
edited and published an Occult magazine under the title of "THE
■
PHILOMATHIAN.” It was a successful magazine of its kind and
was highly esteemed by serious Occult students. He had the encour­
agement and enjoyed fraternal recognition of many Occult teachers.
I often contributed to his magazine. I recognized his ability as an
Occultist "and believed in him implicitly—nor has iny faith in him
shaken or altered to this day. He was a victim of unkind and un­
fortunate circumstances—“more sinned against than sinner.”
Later, be decided to organize the Philosophers of the Living Eire
for the purpose of promulgating his teachings. They were sound and
true Occult teachings, of White Magic, leading the student along
the upward Path to a higher spiritual realization and development.
He requested permission to use my name as one of the officers.
I granted it. My name appeared upon his literature and letterheads
as the “Grand -Rabboni.” Dr. Barton being the Supreme Grand
~Rabboni and in full charge of its management. Others were asso­
ciated with him in the actual management, I was not. I permitted
him to use my name, that was all. Aside from my name being used,
I had nothing whatever to do with The Philosophers of the Living
Fire.
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE FRAUD ORDER
Prior to the issuance of the fraud order in 1905 against Dr.
Barton’s organization in Michigan, a Postal Inspector came to see
' me in Pennsylvania. He told me that Dr. Barton had informed him
that I had nothing whatever to do with the matter, that Dr. Barton
had admitted that he promoted the society, managed its affairs, and
received all monies derived therefrom; that his investigation had
showed it to be true, and he completely exonerated me. The Inspec­
tor said that the investigation had not been made upon the complaint
of any of the members, or students, but upon information furnished
by Dr. Barton’s wife—of this we will say more later.
When the fraud order issued, it contained my name, with other
names, simply because my name bad been used in the literature. I
was not a party to the proceedings and had no notice of the hearing
before the issuance of the order therefore, my name was wrongfully
and without warrant of law included in the order; however, it be-

An Answer To Me. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
came effective only against Dr. Barton and his organization located
in Michigan. It was never effective against me and my mail; the
mail of any organization with which I have ever been actively con­
nected, has never beenfftif^ected or interfered with to the slightest
degree. It was not a fraud order against me, or against any organi­
zation with which I have ever been actively or actually connected,
although the A. M. A. article intended to leave that impression and
it probably does, but it should not. It is an absolutely false insinua­
tion.
I am reliably informed that when Dr. Barton’s magazine became
a success, he established a printing plant and employed a printer.
The printer fell in love with his wife, the wife with the printer. In
one of those family affairs, of which nothing more need be said, he
threw his faithless wife and her illicit lover out of his house. She
vowed vengeance. She got it. The fraud order resulted.
In 1917, Dr. Barton attempted to reorganize the Philosophers
of the Living Fire; of this I had no knowledge. The original fraud
order was reissued against him,' and his organization; of this I had
no notice. The reissued order contained my name as did the original,
but it was not effective as against me. It was not a fraud order
against me.
Dr. Barton died shortly thereafter, a penniless and heart-broken
man, a victim of the unrelenting vengeance of a faithless Eve, who
fell under the temptation of a printer-devil, a snake that he had em­
ployed and welcomed to his home.
THEN AND NOW
Dr. Barton issued 25 to 30 good Occult lessons to the Degree,
which he sold to his students at a trifle over Sc per lesson, scarcely
enough to cover postage and cost of production. The Post Office
Department being unable to evaluate their intrinsic worth, declared
them to be without monetary value, his Occult society a fraud, and
closed up his organization. This hastened him to an early grave.
Certainly he had robbed no one and had not accumulated a fortune
by fraudulent means, or otherwise, because at the time he was served
with notice of hearing on the fraud order, he did not have sufficient
money to go to Washington to defend himself.
For the past 20 years, Mr. Lewis has been issuing so-called
occult and mystic lessons, sending them through the mails, falsely
representing them to be the teachings of the original Rosierucian
Order. As Rosierucian teachings, they are intrinsically and mone­
tarily worthless. Tb.ese he sells to his victims at 50c per lesson
(4 lessons per month, monthly dues $2.00, plus a $5.00 initiation
29
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and the A. M. A.
fee), from which his gross income in one year was more than
$1,000,000. The Post Office Department has not seen fit to inter­
fere with this occult racket; it has been as mystifying to the Govern­
ment as it has been profitable to Mr. Lewis.
This is astounding. There is no way of accounting for it, except
that times have changed. Albeit, Mr. Lends has ample funds de­
rived from his operations with which to employ able lawyers, eminent
counsel to protect his operations. Thus it is that the unsuccessful
alleged fraud of yesterday was stamped out. with indignation for the
protection of the credulous, while the successful racketeer of today
is allowed to pursue his fraudulent schemes and devices in a big way
and the gullible and the credulous are beyond the pale of Govern­
mental consideration and protection.
OUR SENSE OF JUSTICE
The man who rolls a pair of dice on a bale of cotton in a game
of chance and loses $1.75, has incurred the penalty of the law for
which he is punished. The man who buys 100,000 bales of cotton
on futures, which he never expects to own, or sells 100,000 bales of
cotton which he does not own on a cotton exchange in a real big
game of chance and makes a million, becomes a hero and a. “leading”
citizen. Can it be that this represents the true ideal of justice and
equal rights under a “government of law and not of men?”
Now, let us suppose that because as an Occultist, I was a friend
of Henry J. Barton, whom I knew to be a profound occult scholar;
whom 1 believed to be honest and honorable;,to whom I loaned the
use of my name; who was an unfortunate victim of cruel circum­
stances; against whom and whose organization (with which I had
nothing to do), a fraud order was issued containing my name, but
which did not affect me and was not issued against me.
Then let us further suppose, that because, as a physician with
deep convictions, with a view of service to mankind, I opposed some
of the theories and methods of the A. M. A. representing the domi­
nant school of medicine, that this powerful organization, in spiteful
retaliation, published an article in which it made reference to the
above mentioned fraud order against Dr. Barton and his organiza­
tion, cleverly concealing the whole truth as to my real connection
with the entire affair—telling only a small part of the truth, with
sarcastic comment, so as to leave the false though damaging in­
ference and nasty innuendo that I had, in some way, been associated
with a fraud— for the purpose of punishing me for daring to oppose
them and to discredit any further opposition that I might have the
“audacity” to offer.

Then, let us suppose still further that, as a Rosierucian and
the official head of the authentic Order of the Rosy Cross in America,
I exposed the racket of a man operating a spurious Rosicrucian
Order; who is conducting his fraudulent scheme and device through
the mails; who openly boasts that he knows the way and has the
means of preventing any fraud orders issuing against him—that he
is immune and above the law, and who is also circulating the above
mentioned A. M. A. article through the mails for the purpose of
shielding himself and to discredit the exposer of his racket, so that
he may perpetuate his outrageous swindle.
Can it be possible—is it true, that such as this conforms to our
ideals of justice and our conception of the eternal fitness of things?
A MISCREDiTED TESTIMONIAL
The reference in the article to “A testimonial credited to R. S.
Clymer from Souderton, Pa.,” of which it is stated, “appears in the
advertising matter issued by the Institute of Physicians and Surgeons
of Rochester;” the inference that I wrote the testimonial and caustic
comment thereon is altogether false and misleading. I did not write
that alleged testimonial. I know nothing about the Institute of
Physicians and Surgeons of_ Rochester, N. Y. I did not know that
such an Institution had existed until I read it in this article.
REPUTABLE MEDICAL COLLEGES
The article states: “Our records fail to show that this man
(Clymer) was ever regularly graduated from a reputable medical
college.” . That is a left-handed statement, intended to leave an un­
favorable impression without frankly and fully stating the whole
truth which is not unfavorable, and in which no fair minded person
can, or will find condemnation.
As to what constituted a “reputable” medical college, from 1890
to 1910 is a matter upon which there is likely to be a sharp, well
defined difference of opinion, depending on whether it taught your
theories, philosophy and practice of medicine, or mine. It will de­
pend largely upon the preconceived ideas and basic prejudices of
him who pronounces the judgment.
The reader will not lose sight of the material fact that the medi­
cal colleges—so contemptuously referred to in the article—which I
will discuss later, were medical colleges that existed more than 30
years ago. They must be judged by the standards of their day and
the circumstances of the times; since then there have been many
changes. Standards of medical education have greatly improved a
change welcomed and encouraged by every true physician regardless

An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A. 31
of his school of theory and practice.
The time was, not so many years ago, when Doctors were not
required to have any prescribed preliminary general education, or to
attend a medical college. They could “read” medicine in a Doctor's
office, under his tutorship and private instruction for what would
now .seem a ridiculously short period (judging by our standards of
today), whereupon they were permitted to practice. Strange as it
may seem to us today—some of our most eminent and successful
physicians received their original medical education and training in
that way. After all, it requires more than academic learning to make
the true physician, Even today, with our higher standards, stricter
requirements, and superior medical colleges, many are graduated,
given a diploma and registered with the right to practice who never
become real physicians. Yet, it is well that we have medical colleges
of high standards to better qualify those who, by natural aptitude,
are capable of becoming true physicians.
THE STATEMENT IS FALSE
The statement above set forth, contained in the article, was not
true, was not justified in fact, and should not have been made;
because, the A. M. A. publishes the American Medical Directory from
its records. One of the medical colleges from which I graduated is
shown to be a reputable medical college in its directory for the year
1923, for several years prior thereto, and in its directory every year
since said time, as I shall later show by quotations from the American
Medical Directory. Its Directory is proof that the A. M. A: knew
the statement to be false and altogether misleading. Now, let us
consider the medical colleges from which I graduated.
THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL COLLEGE
When as a youth, I decided to become a physician, I consulted
physicians in whom I had utmost confidence—physicians of standing,
successful and highly respected practitioners— as to which medical
college I should attend. They advised that I attend the Independent
Medical College. My investigation showed that it had a faculty of
able and experienced physicians. That it had graduated a number
of successful and able Doctors. It was a regularly chartered institu­
tion. It had a curriculum that more than met the standards of that
time. It taught in classes personally attended and by correspondence,
which was then permissible. Its diplomas were recognized by the
Boards of Health in. practically all States.
At the time I entered and graduated from this college, it was
a reputable medical college. It taught efficiently the system of heal-
32 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and the A. M. A.
ing in which I believed with all my heart and soul. I attended the
classes in person for the full prescribed time, diligently and studi­
ously completed the prescribed course, and was regularly graduated
therefrom in 1898. Thereafter, it may have “sold” diplomas to
others, that I do not know but I da know that I earned mine. With
the toil of my hands and the sweat of my brow, I earned the money
to pay my tuition. I spent every spare moment on my studies, burned
the midnight oil, intent upon acquiring all possible knowledge and
understanding of the healing art and in fully qualifying myself as
a physician.
I wanted a diploma because it entitled me to legally register and
practice. That was necessary, of course; however, I intended to have
the proper qualifications before I entered the practice.
The faculty were lovable men, scholars, learned in medicine,
and splendid teachers. (See Facsimile reproduction of my diploma
from the Independent Medical College, note the names of the faculty
signed to my diploma. I acquired much knowledge and understand­
ing of medicine, surgery, and the healing arts. I made satisfactory
progress with my studies under the guidance and tutorship of these
splendid teachers, each of whom had the heart of the physician, but
I was not satisfied with myself and the sufficiency of my medical
education as will later appear.
COMPULSORY VACCINATIONS AND INOCULATIONS
It is not my purpose to review the sharp difference of opinions
in the medical profession as to the merits and demerits, benefits and
dangers of vaccinations, or inoculations with cow-pox virus for the
prevention of smallpox, nor to review the long bitter fight to make
such vaccination compulsory by law. Sufficient be it to say that
there was and still is a marked difference of opinion between the best
minds and the greatest physicians in the profession, and that the
contest to make such vaccination compulsory on our soldiers, sailors,
school children, and certain of our citizens was bitterly waged dur­
ing the latter half of the last century and the early part of this.
This contest had reached the heights of its intense bitterness during
the closing years of the 19th century and the first few years of the
20th century. It was at that time (from 1890 to 1905) that the
A. M. A. was making its most arduous efforts to secure its ascendancy
as the dominant school of medicine, and to crush all opposition to
the ambitious and not altogether laudable plan for which it was
organized, by and through its championship of Comptilsory Vaccina­
tion. The Physio-Medical organizations and Colleges opposed the
A. M. A. with vigor, returning vindictiveness for vindictiveness. The
33
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A, M. A
means employed, and the manner in which that contest was carried
on will always be a cankerous spot of shame upon the pages of our
professional history.
The Independent Medical College, its management and faculty
were unusually active in bitterly opposing the A. M. A. in its cam­
paign for compulsory vaccination, and otherwise made themselves
exceedingly obnoxious to the officers and management of the A. M. A.
Indeed, it became a bitter-end fight, for the survival of the fittest.
The A. M. A., the stronger, determined to exterminate the Independ­
ent, to accomplish which every effective means and method, fair
or otherwise, was used. The Independent, finally weakened by the
relentless efforts of the A. M. A. to destroy and annihilate it, resorted,
it was alleged, to the indefensible expediency of issuing diplomas in
1899, after I graduated therefrom, for a price to secure funds to
defend itself against ,the relentless prosecution aijd persecution of its
bitterest enemy, thereby placing in the hands of the A. M. A. the
very weapon with which it was destroyed. The College wT
as dosed
in the latter part of 1899 and its President was prosecuted and
convicted.
At the. time I graduated, its diplomas were recognized in most
of the States of the U. S. I registered under my diploma hr the
States of Michigan, Arkansas, and the territory of Oklahoma, and
was granted a license to practice therein, although I had no inten­
tion of immediately entering the practice. (See facsimile reproduc­
tion of certificates in Michigan, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The
right to practice in Arkansas is endorsed on the back of the diploma).
I had satisfied the law and was registered in three states, in one
of which I intended to ultimately locate, hut I was not satisfied with
myself, i. e. my qualifications and my medical education. So, I
matriculated in the College of Medicine and Surgery to better qualify
myself as a physician. <
THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY, CHICAGO
At the time I entered the College of Medicine and Surgery, it
was well established (established in 1885), had a large registration,
a full curriculum, a large and able faculty, high standards, strict
requirements strictly adhered to, and was rated one of the very best
Physio-Medical Colleges in America. It was then and always has
been considered a first class, highly reputable and highly esteemed
medical college.
Notwithstanding the aspersions cast upon it by innuendo in the
article, the A .M .A . has always considered and classified it as a
reputable medical college and has published this fact year after year,

y. Substantially the same information appeared in the American
Medical Directory for the year 1923 (the year of the article), prior
i: thereto, and every7year since that time. There is, there can he, no
i doubt about the College of Medicine and Surgery being a reputable .
| medkal coll-ege—the A. M. A. so recognized it to be and the A, M. A.
was and is not. overly fond of the Physio-Medicalists.
Allowing for credits given on account of my work in the Inde-
i pendent Medical College which was recognized, I attended the classes
I in person for two years, labored hard, studiously pursued ray studies,
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and the A. M. A. 35
completed the course, complied with and met all the requirements of
the College of Medicine and Surgery, and was regularly graduated
therefrom in 1902, although I did not receive my diploma until the
early part of 1911, due entirely to lack of funds with which to pay
part of my tuition.
, The wholly misleading and altogether unjust statements in the
article implying that I had not been regularly graduated by any
reputable medical school is based upon, but by no means justified,
by the following facts.
First, that the Independent Medical College, which was a
recognized, legal, and reputable College at the time I graduated
therefrom, was afterwards declared to be disreputable. I did not
endorse, I did not participate in, and I do not condone its evil prac­
tices, if any such there were. Should I be held responsible, dis­
honored, and disgraced because of the frauds, wrongdoing and sins,
if any, of the management of a college committed after my gradua­
tion? I earned my diploma; it was honest and its certification was
true to the effect that I had completed the course of study and was
entitled to the degree of Doctor of Medicine.
Second, upon the fact that the College of Medicine and Surgery,
although it graduated me and executed my diploma in June, 1902,
(see facsimile of Diploma for date and signatures), the diploma
was not delivered to me until January, 1911. So, it is upon this
“irregularity” that they condemn and would dishonor me—and it
is on these facts that they base the statement that I was never regu­
larly graduated by any reputable medical college.
My graduation from the Independent Medical College that was
later declared to be a disreputable college, and my graduation from
the College of Medicine and Surgery, a reputable college, was not
quite regular, from which is deducted the statement: “Our records
fail to show that this man (Clymer) was ever regularly graduated
by any reputable medical college.” Strange reasoning, intended to
conceal the truth, and to condemn and dishonor the innocent.
The writer of that article did know the facts and the records of
the A. M. A. did show the facts. This is revealed upon the face of
the article by the statement: “Correspondence with a one-time officer
of this extinct school brought the statement that in 1911 Clymer was
‘granted an ad eundem diploma'!” It was written thus with a latin
term to confuse, to mislead, and to cast an aspersion on me. And
yet, although intended to conceal the truth, it nevertheless reveals it.
The Secretary of the College of Medicine and Surgery (which
is not an extinct school as shown by the A. M, A. directory of Medical
Colleges quoted above but exists by merger today), did write the

A. M. A. and tell them the facts, viz: that I was graduated in 1902
and because facts hereinafter fully stated, in 1911 I was granted an
ad eundem diploma. Ad eundcm means “to the same’’—TO THE
SAME DEGREEt that is, in 1911 I was granted a diploma to the
same degree to which I was entitled upon my graduation in 1902.
THE FACTS OF THE “iR REGULARITY"
As in the Independent Medical College, I worked my way
through the College of Medicine and Surgery. I had no one to assist
me financially, I fought, my way alone. My studies in the latter
school required so much of my time during the last two terms that
I only found time .and opportunity to earn sufficient money to pay
for my books and meager living expenses. When I was graduated,
I owed the school for two terms tuition. Because I could not pay
the tuition, my diploma, although issued and signed by the faculty,
was withheld. At the time of the withholding of the diploma, I felt
that I had been wronged and unnecessarily offended and humiliated.
However, I decided that I did not need the diploma, since its posses­
sion did not increase my learning, nor add aught to my qualifications.
I was more interested in acquiring and possessing knowledge than
in possessing a diploma certifying to it—so I continued my que3t for
knowledge. In the latter part of 1910, the Secretary of the College
of Medicine and Surgery advised me that it had been decided to
deliver my diploma to me and suggested that one good turn deserved
another. I accepted the suggestion, paid the back tuition and the
diploma was delivered to me.
This is the irregularity upon which the statement is based that
I was never regularly graduated from a reputable medical college.
It may be that poverty in worldly goods is a sin. If so, I have
sinned grieviously in my ideals, because I have always esteemed
knowledge, service, and the higher, nobler, spiritual things of life
to be of greater value.
The article makes a point out of the fact that it was stated in
Polk’s Medical Directory that I was a graduate of the College of
Medicine and Surgery in 1902 and also in 1911. In the light of
the foregoing statement of facts, the apparent inconsistency of
apparent conflicting statements are reconciled,
FURTHER MEDICAL EDUCATION
Immediately after graduating in Chicago from the College of
Medicine and Surgery in 1902, I interned in Dr. August Reinhold’s
Sanitarium in New York City, where I remained for one year. Dr.
Reinhold successfully treated many chronic ailments (which other
An Answer To Me. Lewis and th e A. M. A. 37
doctors had failed to cure), with Osteopathy, Electro-Therapeutics,
Nature Cure, and Diet. As an interne in this institution with actual
daily practice and the valuable instruction of Dr. Reinhold, I
rounded out my medical education.
WELL QUALIFIED TO PRACTICE
In 1904, when I entered the practice at Allentown, Pennsylvania,
without being boastful and only intending to state the facts truly,
I dare say that my medical education and qualifications were equal
to that of any medical student graduated from any medical col­
lege of that day. I was successful and immediately gained local
fame as a physician.
OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO OCCULTISTS
Being an Occultist, and knowing full well the deteriorating
effect on the Soul, resulting from the injection of vaccines, animal
serums, and decomposed animal matter into the blood, I fought com­
pulsory vaccination vigorously with all my might and main. The
articles I wrote attracted such wide attention and created so much
undesirable opposition, that one of the large chemical manufacturers
of vaccines approached me with alluring and tempting offers. These
were promptly refused. I plunged into the fight with renewed vigor.
Ever>r Occultist, Mystic, and student of die Occult Sciences will
honor and sustain me for the fight I made against vaccination and
legislation to make it compulsory. It was in this manner that I
incurred the bitter wrath of the A. M. A.
THE A. M.A, “GETS EVEN”
The article insofar as it related to me, was a “pay-off”— a
“get even” article—it reeks with vengeance, caustic retaliation, and
spiteful vindictiveness. Although it was not justified in fact, nor by
the facts, yet, it appears that no jeering insinuation was sufficiently
derisive, and no injury or harm they hoped to do me was quite enough
to satisfy the rancorous, pitiless, relentless, vindictive spirit of re­
venge and retaliation that prompted the writing of that article.
That was their mistake—they have since realized it. I have for­
given their persecutions and the injury they would have done. As
a matter of fact, the article resulted in no professional injury. It
was a tacit admission that my efforts in opposition to compulsory
vaccination and other pet ideas of the A. M. A. had not been feeble,
but sufficiently strong and powerful enough to incite and arouse
unreasonable vindictive abuse. Indeed, tire article, if correctly un-
38 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
derstood, is a professional compliment—a boost, not a knock. As
noted before, after this article appeared and came to the notice of
the profession, the sale of my books on Diet and Medical subjects
greatly increased within professional circles— especially to Doctors
of the Allopathic School.
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY PHYSIO-MEDICAL COLLEGE
This was an ambitious plan, well conceived and a praiseworthy,
good faith attempt by several reputable, well-meaning physicians to
establish a highly efficient and truly reputable Physio-Medical Col­
lege, and in its due process of growth, to eventually take its place
among the best medical colleges in the land. The plan embraced
the association of other colleges, teaching the use of all natural heal­
ing arts, agents, and methods other than the use of poisonous drugs,
serums, vaccines, etc., under a central management, to better protect
and promote all such allied colleges not teaching inconsistent theories
of practice. This was known as the Associated College, with general
offices in Union City, Mich.
I was not one of the original .promoters. It was not my plan.
After all the plans had been made, all the chairs in the college filled,
the organization completed and functioning, prospectus and adver­
tising matter printed and what appeared to be ample funds provided,
I was approached and induced to become the advertising manager of
the Twentieth Century Physio-Medical College. I also agreed to
associate the International Academy of the Natural and Sacred
Sciences, of which I was the founder, with the Associated College
and to cooperate with the general plan.
As advertising manager, stationery and letterheads were issued
to me, upon which my name appeared as “Secretary and Manager.*’
This was misleading. I erred in using them. I had nothing to do
with the management of the college in any way whatever. I acted
only as advertising manager under a contract and solicited students
for the institution. In this I acted in good faith, believing that the
original plan and high ideals would be carried out. However, after
I had spent much effort and had been successful in securing many
students for the college, complaints of students and rumors of irregu­
larities came to my notice which shook my faith in the institution. I
discontinued my efforts and severed my connections.
One high in the management, with the cooperation of others of
the management, had been selling diplomas to students who had not
fully completed the course and who were not entitled thereto. He
had converted what I had believed was to be a high class, efficient
medical college into a “diploma mill.” When his fraud was found
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A. 39
oat, lie attempted to shift the blame from himself to others (includ­
ing myself), who/were in no way connected with, or had any knowl­
edge of the fraud. In this he was not successful. A full investiga­
tion by the Government revealed the real culprits who paid for their
wrong-doing.
1 had no knowledge of this investigation until it had been com­
pleted. On his Way back to Washington, the Post Office Inspector
stopped to see me. He looked over my records, to verify his find­
ings. When he told me about the results of his investigation, I was
astounded to learn for the first time of the unsuccessful efforts that
had been made to involve me in the wrong-doing of others, with
which, he said, I had nothing to do. Therefore, I was at no time
involved in the investigation, nor in the fraudulent practices re­
vealed by the investigation. The record of the investigation showed
me to be innocent of any wrong-doing. The college was unable to
survive and because of the wrong-doing of a few, the efforts of many
came to naught and suspicion, entirely undeserved, was cast upon
them.
I believed then, and I believe now, that we should have such a
college of the highest possible standards, teaching the Physio-Medi­
cal theory and practice. It would be of great value to the medical
profession. I regret that it was not a success as originally planned.
MY OWN ACADEMY WAS NEVER QUESTIONED
In this connection, may I note the fact, that when the Twentieth
Century Physio-Medical College was under official investigation,
The International Academy of the Natural and Sacred Sciences,
■which I founded and successfully conducted for some time, was
not involved and was not under investigation. It never was under
-investigation and its legality was never questioned. It did not offer
degrees of M.D., D.O., or any degrees whatever. It was only through
the Medical Colleges connected with the Associated College that the
degrees were offered— not by the International Academy of the
Natural and Sacred Sciences■
.
THE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY OF THE NATURAL AND
SACRED SCIENCES
(Not a Medical College)
This was not a medical college and was not so represented. It.
was founded for the purpose of teaching—practicing physicians and
students who had previously received their medical education and
degrees, a System of Healing which I had devised, based upon the
application of certain occult laws and principles of nature, consist-

ing of the basic therapy of the Natural System in combination with
the Schuessler Tissue Remedies, or the Biochemic System of Medi­
cine, which was then a new system. I was a pioneer in introducing
it in this country and among our physicians. I now view with
justifiable pride the success of my efforts and the good that has
been accomplished.
Dr. W. H. Schuessler, of Oldenberg, Germany, had originated
his twelve tissue remedies based upon the famous, cell theory of
Professor Rud. Virchow, which, in composition, correspond with the
inorganic elements found in the blood and human body. These
remedies are based upon truly natural laws, and the Biochemic
system combines perfectly with the theory and practice of the
Physio-Medicist.
These remedies are known as elixirs, because of their rejuvenat­
ing effects upon the cells. They have been, often and properly,
called the “Elixir of Youth.” Because they supply the blood with
all necessary inorganic salts they have been referred to as “Water
of Life”— “Bioplasma—the Life of the Blood.” Because these terms
and the Biochemic System were the subject of sarcastic slurs intended
to put me in a false and ridiculous light, I shall for the benefit of
my lay readers, take the space to briefly describe the Biochemic
System.
THE THEORY OF BIOCHEMICAL TREATMENT
The body is made up of cells. Different kinds of cells build
up the different tissues and organs of the bc.dy. The difference in
the cells is largely determined by the kind of inorganic salts which
enter into their composition. If we bum the body, or any part of
it, we obtain the ashes. These are the inorganic constituents of the
body, the salts of iron, magnesia, lime, etc., which build up its
tissues. Besides these inorganic salts, the body is composed of water
and organic substances in the proportion of one-twentieth of in­
organic salts to the remainder of water and organic matter; but the
latter is inert and useless in the absence of the inorganic cell salts.
These are the real tissue builders, the architects of the organism, and
both the structure and vitality of the body depend upon their proper
quantity and distribution in every cell. The biochemical treatment
uses these inorganic cell salts, when properly prepared for assimila­
tion, and they are the Tissue Remedies, considered capable of curing
ever}' curable disease and ameliorating most incurable ones.
Health is the state of the body when all the cells composing the
various tissues are in a normal condition; they are kept in this state
when they each receive the requisite quantity of the needful cell

salts required for the upbuilding of the different tissues.
Disease is an altered state of the cell produced by some irregu­
larity in the supply to the cells of one of the inorganic tissue salts.
Imperfect cell action results, diseased tissues and organs follow, and
all the phenomena of disease are developed. Now the cure consists
in restoring the normal cell growth by furnishing a minimal dose of
the inorganic substance whose molecular motion is disturbed, which
disturbance caused the diseased action. To do this successfully, it
is necessary to know what salts are needed for the upbuilding of the
different tissues and for their normal action. This knowledge is
derived from physiological chemistry, and hence this treatment of
disease by supplying the needed tissue salt is called the biochemical
treatment.
What is more rational, what is more natural, founded as it is
on natural law, that where there is a deficiency in one or more of the
component parts of the constituents of the organism, that this de­
ficiency will produce a deranged, or a diseased condition: or, more
logical, than by the supplying of these lacking elements an equilib­
rium will again be restored, and the organism returned to its normal
condition.
The Biochemic system, in connection with other remedies,
methods and practices of the Natural System, combined into a well
prepared course,of study for the treatment of every known disease,
was taught by mail and in personally attended classes for several
years to thousands of Doctors and graduated medical students who
have been and are today successfully using it in their practice.
The Biochemic or Schuessler Tissue Remedies have been manu­
factured and sold for the past 30 years by all the leading pharinacal
and chemical laboratories in this country. They are now used by
all Homeopathic and by two-tliirds of the Allopathic physicians.
Thus my pioneering labors, so severely and slurringly criticized,
have been vindicated and fully justified.
RECENT RECOGNITION OF OCCULT SCIENCES
BV A PREEMINENT NATURAL SCIENTIST
Paracelsus, the great medieval physician and occultist, used
certain occult laws in his practice with signal success, for wMchrlre-
was severely criticized and ridiculed by the doctors of his day. In
the International Academy of the Natural and Sacred Sciences we
taught, in connection with the System of Natural Healing, certain
occult laws and principles of the finer forces of Nature. In this
connection it is interesting to note that a preeminent Natural Scien­
tist, Dr. Alexis Carrel, a Nobel prize winner, Biologist at the Rocke-
i
:- ,Wi»WSB5?**SS288^& I222?1SO L 3^^^
42 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
feller Institute, in his recent book, MAN— THE UNKNOWN, has
taken a long step forward into the realms of the metaphysical and
gives due recognition to certain laws, principles and teachings of the
Occult Sciences. It is a “breaking over” of the Natural Scientist
into the Occult Sciences. It may be the beginning of the ultimate
universal recognition by all scientists of the occult principles and
occult laws of nature long taught by the Secret Schools, including
the Rosicrucians.
No doubt Dr. Carrel, like all pioneers.in medicine, and science,
will be severely criticized and ridiculed by the “stand-pat,” orthodox
Doctors and Scientists- Be it so, he has written an epochal book
that should be of great interest and worthy of the profound con­
sideration of all, especially all occult students.
MAGNETIC (ALCHEMIC) THERAPEUTIC AND
DIRECT MEDICATION
In connection with the above mentioned course issued and
taught to Physicians in The International Academy of the Natural
and Sacred Sciences, I taught Magnetic-Electro Therapeutics, and
a system of Direct Medication. I issued text books upon these
subjects that were purchased by many physicians not taking the
course. These books are still in demand.
I applied for patents on mechanical magnetic electro apparatus
for direct medication and the treatment of disease. The patent
examiner said that it could not be done and rejected the applications.
1 went to the Patent Office in "Washington and demonstrated that
it could be done. Patents were granted to me on an “Apparatus for
Magnetic Treatment of Diseases,” being Patents Nos. 856330 and
910643, upon which International Patents were granted in all
civilized countries.
Today thousands of physicians use magnetic-electro treatments
in one form or another. Hospitals are elaborately equipped with
magnetic-electro apparatus embodying, in one phase or another, the
basic principles I taught. Direct medication is a common practice
in every hospital in the land. Again, I have been vindicated and
the slurring aspersion cast on my pioneering work in the article have
been proven to be without justification.
THE ROSICRUCtAN AID
The Rosicrucian or Rose Cross Aid is an auxiliary organization ■
of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, having for its purpose the rendering
of the greatest possible service to mankind in every possible way,
and under all conditions.
An Answer To Mr, Lewis and th e A. M, A. 43
When the United States entered the World War, the Rosicracian
Aid became immediately active on a large scale and made the follow­
ing announcement:
“The Rosicrucian Aid represents the Rose Gross, the
modem title of the representatives of the ancient organiza­
tion which has always been active in the periods of national
and international disaster in the work of reconstruction.
According to the ancient rules and privileges of its estab­
lished precedent, that of seeking avenues of service to man­
kind, it accepts the present opportunity.
“For centuries past, the Rosxcrucians have served the
people of warring nations. During the Middle Ages, in
France and other countries, this Order worked on the
battle fields and in the villages, ministering to both the
temporal and spiritual needs of the stricken people, and in
our own country, under the martyred president, Abraham
Lincoln, our men served well in reconstruction work.
“We hold that different ages require different services
and methods. Since America has entered the war, the Aid
decided to give up most of its former work, and devote its
time to two lines, especially. First, that which has to
do with the conservation, substitution and combination of
foods, so that the needed foods may be saved for the Allies
and the boys in the trenches, and at the same time that
health may result to the people of the nation. Second,
that which may be called Higher Race Development, and
which has to do with the cleanliness of the morals of the
nations at war.
“These two subjects we hold to be of vast importance
to a nation at war—and afterwards. The conservation of
healthy manhood and womanhood, and the consequent well­
born children, is of as much importance to a race as the
conservation of food is to the winning of this war. The
two go hand in hand.
“The Aid takes up the subject of Food in detail. It
teaches an economy in the expenditure of money, at the
same time adding to the food value, through tire arts of
combination and substitution. The individual who follows
the instructions, gains in bodily health and vigor at a re­
duction of cost. This applied to the nation results in the
saving of millions. Another result accomplished at this
time is the conservation of certain foodstuffs required by
the government for the support of the Allies.” .
-jr ir r r r r .W - i:'.U:
44 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A.
During the war and the immediate years of reconstruction, The
Rosicrucian Aid distributed among the people throughout the nation,
millions of free pamphlets and booklets giving aid and instruction
in Dietetics; Scientific Cooking: Food Conservation, Substitution
and Combinations; Child Welfare; Higher Race Development, etc.
While some others were profiteering, we were rendering this
free service and selling our books on Diet and Cooking at cost.
While certain, others, loud and prominent in “lip service,” were
secretly avoiding and assisting in avoiding the Draft, we were doing
our patriotic duty and serving humanity.
Do you think, that the performance of this patriotic duty to our
country and the rendering of these services to our people in times
of war and distress deserve the sneering reference of condemnation
made to it in the article, which Mr. Lewis, the pseudo-rosicrucian,
is circulating with the hope of discrediting the Official Head of the
Real Rosicrucians, that he may continue his fraudulent operations,
family racket and occult swindle as if it were a Rosicrucian organi­
zation?
DIETETICS
As was the case with the introduction of the Biochemic System,
Magnetic-Electro Therapeutics and Direct Medication, I was also
among the pioneers in Dietetics in this country. Some thirty years
ago, when Dr. Reinhold, Christian, Tilton and myself began to teach
Diet—the proper combination and use of food as a cure and pre­
ventative of disease, we were jeered and ridiculed by the learned
orthodox members of the' profession of the Allopathic School. Even
as late as 1923, the A. M. A. was still jeering and ridiculing my
work in the field of Dietetics, The last twelve years have witnessed
many changes— and many of those who came to scoff have remained
to praise.
My works on Dietetics and special works on various aspects of
the subject have passed through various editions, several printings
and have been purchased by the profession and laity by tens of thou­
sands. Today, the demand for these books is greater than ever.
Today the Allopathic School, sponsored and represented by the
A. M. A., has adopted and is using as its own all the basic theories
and practices of the System of Dietetics, pioneered and introduced
into this country by myself and. a, few others, to cure and to prevent
disease. The Allopathies are heralding it as a modern idea and a
wonderful discovery of their school. SO MOTE IT B E !—Let the
good work go on. What matter it if I, another, or others receive the
credit for introducing the system, if the good work. goes on and
45
An Answer To Mr. Lewis and th e A. M. A,
service is rendered to mankind. Columbus discovered the New
World. It was named after another who made a map of it. For
his pains, Columbus was abused, humiliated, and placed in chains
—yet he was vindicated. It is a part of the law of progress that
pushes our race onward and upward to better things and higher
ideals, that some must sow- what others shall reap..
NOT MOTIVATED BY SELFISHNESS
I do not entertain the slighest objection to the use by others of
any ideas, remedies, .or medical systems which I pioneered—nor
would I contest with others for the honor that justly may be mine,
However, since my alleged “quackery” of yesterday has become a
part of the “regular” and standard practice of today, it does not
seem to be mete or proper, altogether just and right—nor even possi­
ble— that the Master Chariatari and Ananias of today should use the
A. M. A. article of yesterday to prove that I am a “quack” in order
to leave the inference that he is a gentleman of saint-like perfection
or at least, in a desperate attempt, to leave the impression that he is
not as bad as those who accuse and expose him.
Neither do I entertain any objection to anyone calling himself
a Rosicrucian if he has earned the title and is a*Rosicrucian Initiate.
Nor do I object to anyone instituting a Rosicrucian organization
under due authority and proper circumstances, and teaching the
exoteric philosophy, or esoteric training, and profound wisdom of
the August Fraternity, if he came by way of the Rosy Cross and is
duly prepared and qualified.
LET US HAVE REAL ROSICRUCIANS
Indeed, it is my deepest and most sincere desire that all who
truly seek and are capable of treading the Path shall be shown the
Way and become Rosicrucians— and it matters not whether I, or
another, or other authorized and qualified initiate teachers guide
them to Mastership that makes them Rosicrucians.
I do object to those claiming to be Rosicrucians when they are
not; who claim to expound the philosophy of the Fraternity when
they do not understand it; who pretend to guide neophytes through
Rosicrucian training to mastership, when they know nothing of the
sublime, inner, esoteric teachings of the Order and who have no
right, authority, or qualifications to teach or guide others in the
Way of the Rosy Cross.*
*See my Foreword to Right to Exclusive Use of Rosieruciar. Names.
Book IV in the permanent volume: The Rosicrucian Fraternity in
America.
46 An Answer To Mr. Lewis and the A. M. A.
I do object—seriously and righteously object to a rank pretender
using the sacred name and holy emblem of the Rosy Cross as a trade
name and trade mark for an occult swindle and family racket, which
as rightful Supreme Grand Master of the Rosicrucians in America,
it became my sacred duty to expose, and then using the A. M. A.
article, which wrongfully attempts, by inference and innuendo, to
connect me with alleged past frauds, as a means of detracting atten­
tion from the expose and as a smoke screen to cover his own fraudu­
lent operations.
CONCLUSION
I submit to the candid judgment of the fair minded, that H.
Spencer Lewis, the pseudo-rosicrucian, the mystical racketeer and
occult swindler can not and shall not succeed with such despicable
methods in perpetuation of his own insidious fraud and infamous
swindle. To this end only have I written and published this reply
to the A. M. A. article.
I have acted, as I write and speak, purely and solely in the .
interest of Humanity to whose welfare I dedicated my time, energy,
and talents— and all that I have and am, when 1 adopted the pro­
fession of Medicine and accepted the sacred responsibilities and
sublime duties of the Supreme Grand Master of The Rosicrucian
In America.
