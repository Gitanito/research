Mr. Chairman, Members of the Christian
_
Evidence Society, Ladies and Gentle-
men ;
1. IN the matter which has now been read,
the argument propounds to shew "
INTERNAL
MARKS OF TRUTH AND HONESTY T0 BE
FOUND IN Tim New TESTAMENT ;
"
'and
as a
part of this argument, the reverend
and learned arguist lays down some of the
various marks of craft and falsehood which
are NOT to be found in it.
2. Now the very proposition of such an ar-
gument, in either of these branches of it, sup-
poses a duty in believers, as well as'a right in
unbelievers, to sift this question with the ut-
most
severity of criticism.
4 `
~
3. lf there are such marks of truth and
honesty in the New Testament, our sifting
and our criticism will discover them--will
set them in a more
conspicuous light, and
cause them to shine with a
brighter efliilgence:
but if there are therein the contrary indica-
tions of imposture and falsehood, in the name
of all that is honourable_ and just among men,
Iask, wherefore should we blink or conceal
them? Must we, for piety's or religion's
sake, tamper with a
suspected imposture, and
sell our honour to a
compromise with fraud ?
In the language which belief itself has conse-
crated, l ask,
"
Will ye speak wickedly for
God? and talk deceitfully for him?" Job
xiii. 7.
4. In entering upon this important and in-
finitely consequential investigation, an invest-
igation in which every person in this assem-
bly is, or ought to be, equally interested and
equally affected, I have only to entreat you to
do yourselves the justice to put from your
minds the prejudices which persons who have
themselves seldom or never attended these
discussions have found it convenient to dis-
seminate, in order to discourage the attend-
ance of others; as if nothing like sober argu-
mentation, calm reasoning, sound learning,
-
5
and accurate criticism, were to be encountered
in this Areopagus. Hear and judge; and
judging fairly, if any thing I otfer seem less
true to you than it does to me, judge and
condemn me too`; but only hear that you may
judge, and judge only on what you hear.
5. But this, at least, may be common
ground between us. I ask no more, than
that you grant me that the Good Eternal God
of Truth (and never have I invocated that
name with levity or lightness) cannot be the
author of forgery and fraud. Whatever may
be the perversities or delusions of the human
heart--to whatever extent wicked and deceit-
ful men may have imposed upon others--or
weak and ignorant men been willing to be
imposed on, to Him, at
least, be it our
mind
that we should ascribe "
no variableness nor
shadow of turning."
'
_
6. Now, then, to this great business; and
as the Rev. Dr. Chalmers, in this his Treatise
r"
on the Evidence and Authority of the Christ-
ian Revelation," has propounded to us that
we should try the writings of the New Testa-A
ment upon the same principles of calm and
indifferent criticism
yvhich we should apply
to any other writings, proceed we upon this
6
simple schedule of the whole argument now
before us, i. e.
"
Internal marks oftruth and
honesty to be found in the New Testament ;
and some of the various marks of cra_/2 and
falsehood which are not to be found in it."
And is it possible that any person in this as-
sembly can shut out from his mind the irre-
sistible conviction, that, even if there were all
these marks of truth and honesty which our
author has supposed there to be found, and
none of those marks of craft and falsehood
there to be found, the writings in question
might yet be most gross and palpable for-
geries ; all that Dr. Chalmers, or any one else,
could shew for them in that way notwith-
standing. 4
7. For where was there a forgery in all the
world that had not internal marks of truth
and honesty? or, what does a
forgery consist
in, but in the predicament of exhibiting marks
of truth and honesty, ,where truth and hones-
ty ARE Nor, and not exhibiting marks of
craft and falsehood, where craft and falsehood
Ann?
8. Nor is it enough to prove the authen-
ticity of any important document, to shew
that it nas ten, or ten thousand, marks of in-
7
tegrity, while there can be shawn one single
mark of integrity that it has not; or to plead
that there are as many marks of imposture
which it has Nor GOT, while there is one that
it HAS. That one may be as
insignificant as
you please, a mere
slip of the pen, an iota, a
Scratch, a dot, but it will do the business; the
single leak in your vessel, for all her keel of
copper and ribs of oak, is fatal to your ar-
gosy's insurance. Who would listen to your
ten thousand ingenious arguments to shew
your shining sovereign to be a good one, who
had once heard the tell-tale sound in the ring-
ing of it that said DUMP?
9. But hear our author. "
Under this head,"
he observes (that is, under the head of "
marks
of truth and honesty,")
"
it may be right to
insist upon the MINUTE ACCURACY which runs
through all its allusions to the existing man-
ners and circumstances of the times," (p. 71.)
Now suppose there were such minute accu-
racy of allusion to manners and circum-
stances, it would only put the Gospel on a
level 'with Sir Walter Scott's poems, or Mrs.
Ratcliff's romances, in which there is a like
accuracy of allusion to existing manners and
circumstances, and most minute descriptions
of scenes and times in which the plot is sup-
8
posed to be laid. The Romance of the Forest,
the Tale of Flodden Field, must bring our
imagination to some references to the when
and where the transactions of the scene are
supposed to have taken place. You could
not describe a scene without them, if you
were to try at it. The Christmas pantomime,
the history of the Man in the Moon, is not
put together without such a
congruity of al-
lusion to existing manners and circumstances.
10. But to tell us, that the allusions to the
existing manners and circumstances of the
times, contained in the New Testament, are
"
minutely accurate," is to play desperate, to
out-herod Herod; to fling defiance in the face
of fact, and to launch the most caustic jibe
and 'biting sarcasm against the New Testa-
ment.
ll. W'hat would be said of a counsellor,
who should stand up in a court of justice to
maintain the MINUTE ACCURACY of writings
for which he would be obliged to answer all
that Dr. Chalmers can answer for the minute
accuracy of the New Testament?
"
WHEN did these minutely accurate writ-
ings make their first appearance ?"
"
Oh, my lord, they have no date, only we
9
know that they must have appeared at or
about some time or other. _
-
"
Very well. WHERE, then, did these mi-
nutely accurate writings make their Iirst _ap-
pearance P -
"
Why," says Dr. Chalmers himself,
"
they'
made their first appearance in different parts
of the world," p. 57. That is, some,»l sup-
pose, in Egypt, some in the East Indies, some
at Botany Bay, and some at York.
"
By whom, then, were they written?
"
0, my lord, that`s being" toorminute---we
dont know BY whom they were written, but
we know that they were written Acconnmo
to some persons, who, they tell us, were
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. ~
"
Who, then, collected them into one vo-
lume? _
-
"
Grammaticl certant et adhuc sub judice
lis est. The opinions, or rather the conjec-'
tures, of the learned, says the learned Mo-
sheim,- are extremely yarious."
And for writings, whose authenticity is no
bette? attested than thus, Dr. Chalmers would
challenge the praise of minute accuracy.
'
12. "-lt is really" (says our author) "
a
most' useful exercise to pursue the- harmony
which subsists between the writers of the'
B
10
New Testament, and those Jewish and pro-
fane authors with whom we bring them into
comparison," (p. 75) With all my heart :
l'll pull my gloves off for this useful exercise,
and will accept no seconding in it, but that of
persons whom I suppose Dr. Chalmers him-
selfmust recognise as orthodox and real Christ-
ians, of talents as cultivated, of piety as ar-
dent, and of learning as
extensive as his own.
13. Well, then, in comparing 'the Evangel-'
ists with the Jewish historian, JosEPuUs, our
author tell us, that "
we have every reason to
believe that he was a most zealous and deter-
mined enemy to the cause," (p. 75.) And if
he was so zealous and determined an enemy
to the cause, what must we think of the pos-
sibility of his having been the author of the
celebrated third section, which is found in the
third chapter of the eighteenth book of his
Jewish Antiquities, and which l repeat to you,
in demonstration of the sincerity of labour
which I have expended in this great argu-
ment, that there should be nothing which
could be known by man, touching the evi-
dence of the Christian religion, unknown by
me: that if there were but the iota of a_pre-
sumption in its favour, in the height, thence
would l pluck it down: in the depth--thence
Il
would I dig it up : that if there were a
single
reason for being a Christian, in all the world,
l would possess myself of it; and to come by
ir,
-
`
"
Flectere si neque super-os, Aclxeronta movebo,"
"
If I could not move Heaven, I'd raise all
hell."
14. This it is :---

15. Of which, in English, this is the pur-
port:
"
There existed, about this time, Jesus,
a wise man, if indeed it be fitting to call him
a man, for he was a
performer of extraordi-
nary works, a teacher of such as receive the
truth with pleasure; and indeed he led many
Jews, and many also of the Grecian (race).
This was the Christ, and it will shew him (to
.12
be so,) that when he had been punished on
the Cross, by Pilate and the chief men among
us,` those who had before been attached to
him continued, to be so, for he appeared to
them again alive the third day; the holy
prophets þÿIl"j]g
foretold these things, and
ten thousand other wonders concerning him.
The stock of Christians, as named from him,
has not even yet lailed from among us."
16. If this passage be a forgery, Josephus
might indeed have been an enemy to Christ-
ianity--As I am. lf it be genuine, I ask,
how could Christianity have had a better
friend?
17. But what sort of a friend to Christianity
you will take Dr. Chalmers himself to be,
I leave you to judge, horn this very short list
of the modes qf expression which seem in-
advertently to drop from his pen when it is
Christianity he is describing. Ile calls it
"
the tenderost prepossession of infancy,"--"
"
the peculiar delusion,"---" the spell which
holds the understanding,"--" the infection of
piety," &c. Szc. a sort of phrases which l urge
not in argument against him, for
"
I like this rocking of tht: battlcments,
"
It suits the especial habit of my soul :"
l
13
but when they occur so frequently as they do
in the course of this treatise, they will not
Suffer our suspicion to sleep, without dream-
ing at least, that the language of the Pro-
fessor of the Colleges of St. Salvador, St.
Leonard, ,and St. Andrew does not exactly
convey the sentiments of Thomas Chalmers,
nor would you put kim down among your
ilatterers, who should be looking out for so
many names for yon, rather than call you
"
Honest." _
18. On the 77th page, however, of this
Treatise, our author makes amends for all,
by the bold, and surely l may call it the
wicked hardihood of asserting, that "in every
page of the evangelical writers, there is
evinced a minute, varied, and intimate ac-
quaintance with the Statistics of Judea, such
as to make the conclusion irresistible, that
the authors were the eye-witnesses of their
own history, or lived about the period of its
accomplishment," p. 79.
19. Now, Gentlemen, such a
representation
of the matter is so far from being true, or an
approach to truth, that to demonstration itself
will I dempnstrate, and with the highest au-
thorities of learning that can he pretended in
'I4 _
all the learned world, will I sustain the de-
monstration, that,
'
1. The writers of the Gospels were never in
Judea at all.
2. That they knew no more about the geo#
graphy of the country, than you or I may do
of the streets and allies in Constantinople.
3. That they were not Jews at all.
4. That they lived not in the same
age.
5. That they were ignorant of the Hebrew
language.
'
`
l
6. That they were no more related, and no
nearer, to the hero of their fable, than I to
Hercules. And if l fail of establishing your
conviction on these points, through my own
fault, let the name of an honest man belong
to any body rather than to me.
20. That the authors of the four Gospels
(whoever they were, God only knows) lived
not at the time to which their Gospels refer, is
apparent, from the fact of their relating events
which we know did not happen till many
years after that time. And though this can
be got over, by the old fanatical trick of pre-
tending that they wrote proplzetically, and
foresaw that those events would happen, yet
a prophet would hardly be able to persuade
us, that he had been an inhabitant of Lon-
15
don, if he should even _foresee that St. Paul`s
Church was situate at Hyde Park Corner, or
that the battle of /Vaterloo had been fought
at Exeter 'Change.
21. Yet this is no caricature of Gospel sta-
tistics ; for both Matthew and Mark have
spoken of Christ as
publishing his Gospel
(Matthew iv. 25, Mark v. 20, and vii. 31) in
Decapolis, and in the coasts of Decapolis,
where no Decapolis existed 5 nor was the name
itself in being till the latter end of the reign
of Nero; nor did the evangelists so much as
know what the name meant. (Evanson, page
l37.)
'
22. But St. Matthew, in particular, is so
minutely accurate in his STATISTICS, that
(in ch. ii. v. 22) he informs us, that Joseph,
notwithstanding being warned of God (which
shews what little -respect he had for God),
turned aside into the parts of Galilee, be-
cause he heard that a son of Herod did reign
in Judea, though it happened that a son of
Herod at that time did reign in Galilee too,
which shews as much minuteness and accuracy
of statistical knowledge, as we should allow
to an historian who should describe a man as
taking lodgings in the Borough, in order to
l6~
retire from the dominions of the king of
England.
23. In Matthew xix, Jesus is said to have
"
departed from Galilee into the coasts of
Judea beyond Jordan," when the Jordan it-
self was the eastern boundary- of both the
Jewish and Roman province of Judea, and
consequently no
part of Judea was
beyond
the Jordan, (Evanson, p. l69.) This is the
minuteness and accuracy of a
geographer,
who should describe a man as departing from
London into the coasts of England beyond
the Irish Channel. Could such mistakes have
been possible to a writer who had ever been
an inhabitant of that country, or who knew
any thing of its geography 'Q
24. But you shall see now; that these writers
were no Jews at all. Know ye not, Sirs. that
there never was any thing so essentially cha-
racteristic of a Jew, as his national, his reli-
gious, his unconquerable abhorrence to pork!
--his God forbade it--his faith condemned
it---his nature shuddered at it. The most
glorious martyrs of their history were those
who suffered the most cruel deaths rather
than taste it. Cruden, in his note` on the
word, admits that they would not so much as
v
17
pronounce the name, and quotes the
authority
of Porphyry, that there 'were none in their
country. Yet the word, with an
impertinent
familiarity, occurs thirteen times in the Gos=
pels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. lt* forms
the favourite figure of speech in the mouth of
Christ himself ; and the most striking miracle
that he ever wrought, was on the persons of a
whole herd of swine, whom he sent galloping
down the hill, as if the devil was in them
though the poor pigs had little reason to
thank him for it; and the owners 'sent their
compliments to him, and 'they'd be much
obliged to him if he'd never come into their
part of the world any more. Now, in the
name of God, I ask, could it have been Jews
who told the lie, in this latitude? Surely, if
they had minded only to save
appearances,
they would have saved their bacon. =

25. The Evangelist, St. John, as ignorant of
the geography, the manners, and the language
of Palestine, as Matthew, Mark, and Luke, has
described John the Baptist as
"
baptizing
in 1Enon, near to Salim, because there was
much water there," John iii. 23; when "
there
was certainly no such place as 1Enon, probaf
bly none such as Salim 57 the writer apparent-
ly mistaking the Hebrew word nm which Sig'
c
18%
niiies waters or fountnins, for the name of a
city,* 4; mistake only parallel to that of the
ehild who pointed out the figures in a. picture
of the crucifixion :--" That ugly man on the
cross is Jesus Christ--that's king Herod, that
'killed the poor children--thgt's Pontius, Pi~
that fellow with the long pole in
his hand is SUFFERY DUNDERJ'
_
26. Yet in John i. 28, the Baptist _is de-=
scribed as on hisjoint-stock washing
Qompany in Bethany, bQy0nd_J017da1» Where
Qur English translators have fraudulently sub-
stituted the word Bqzhabara, to screen the
geographical ignorance of the original ,im-
postor, who happenednot to be aware, that
there was no such place as Bethany beyond
Jordan ; a fraud which the learned-and
accurate Griesbach has ingenuously corrected,
by restoring the word Bethany to the text; to
abide the censure of criticism. .

"

28. No person who had ever been in Jeru-
salem--no »person in the least acquainted with
the Jewish history, or aware that it-was an
established article of the Jewish faith, that,
since the las! of their prophets, Malachi, there
were no continued interpositions of mi*aci§
lous agency in flsrael, could possibly have re-
lated such an hi-diddle-diddle sort of al story,
for which the best apology the most learned
exfpositors could make, has been to ex-
pose it to the contempt it merits, by explains
ing, that this angel, alléer alvmigbt h'ave~been
nothing more than a bfu'tcher's boy, who used
to be sc/dt down to the pomho wash such kind
of
delicacies _as bufchers' boys are generally
employed to wash. A
29. From his gross ignorance of the Jewish
20
language, this Evangelist, John, has most pre-
posterously given us the passive participle
an-earumevog, sent, for a version of the He-
brew noun npw whichsignifies the places of
the sending forth of water, that is, the sluicei;
and told us that this is by interpretation, SENT,
as if the pool had been sent to the man, in-
stead of _the man being sent to the pool, as he
was, for the purpose of washing his eyes,
which was very necessary, after the lilthy
operation that had been performed on them ;
though to send a blind man to the water's
edge, was
putting him more in the way of
baptism than in the way of salvation. .
I
30. But the ignorance' of the pretended
-Matthew of the Jewish language, an ignorance
not merely of its vocabulary and of its gram-
rnar, if it ever had any, but of the grandest
characteristic peculiarities of its idiqm, such
as are known to the readers of our English
bibles, or of any thing that was ever trans-
lated out of their language, has betrayed him
into an absurdity so monstrous and so ridicu-
lous, as I dare not quote without pledge of
your leave and allowance to do so. May I?
May I 'Q and shall it not be said, that I threw
an additional air of ridicule on that which was
21
in itself, and in the most simple énaration of
it, infinitely ridiculous?
31. Well, then, surely every one knows,
that it was a regular idiom of the Jewish lanf`
guage to repeat the word on which it was
wished to lay any peculiar emphasis, or to
double' it, by connecting it with a synonime,
expressive of precisely the same thing. This
mode of language is well known to rheto-
ricians as the figure called a PLEONASM, and
has considerable force and eloquence, even
in other languages; as when we say in Latin,
"
Moriens morietur---Dying, he shall die ;"
that is to say, he shall be very dead#--a very
necessary distinction among Christians, who
believe that a man .could be dead, but not
dead enough to stay dead. The Latin of the
vulgate translation,
"
Jure-jurando jurans ju-
ravi-ln swearing, swearing, I havesworn ;"
which is the way in which God swears: that
is, as 'we should say, swearing with a ven-
geance. 'i -
32. Thus we read, that (Numbers xxiii. 24),
"
Behold
the people shall rise up as a great
lion, and lift himself up as a
young lion." In
the Psalms,
"
What is man, that thou art
mindful of him?"and the` son of man, that
zz
.
thou regardest him ?" And again,
"
God is
not a man that he should lie, nor the Son of
man that he should repent," (Numbers xxiii.
19.) where, certainly, the greet lion and the
y0ung,.and the man and the son of man,
meant only one lion and one man, that is to
say, a good one of the sort.
~
33. But poor Matthew, not being aware of
this, and stumbling upon some version of the
ixth of the 9th of Zechariah, that ran,
"
Be-»
hold thy king cometh riding upon anasg and
an the son ofan ass," supposed that these
must needs be two Jerusalem ponies, and sets
King Jesus, like Mr. Ducroxv at Astley'|
theatre, astradle across them both. (Matthew
xxi.) No wonder, then, that his friends out
downbranches of the trees to s1ophin;m
wonder that the boys and girls raised the ble
and cry!
'
"'
The dogs did bark, the children screanfd,
_Up went the windows all,
l
And every soul cry'd out
'
Well done !' .
As loud as he could bowl.
"Away went Jesus, who but he#
His fame soon around;
He carries weight-he rides a race-
'Tis for a thousand pound."
So our Esherman heat thelinen-draper bold.
23
34. Other instances of palpable ignorance,
both of Jewish statistics, and of the Jewish
history, demonstrating the points I have laid
down, are suchas that of John xi. 49, speaks
ing of "
Caiaphas being high priest that same
yea.r:" and again,
"
that being high priea
that year, he prophesied,"---a mode of expres-
sion whioh no Jew, .nor any one born i.n.Pa-
lestine, could possibly have used ,there never
having been an intelligent Jew who knew not
that the High Priest held his oliioe for life;
and that of that oiee, prophecying was no
part. (Bretschneider, 94;) Should we for. a
moment suppose an historian ever to have
been in England who could write that George
the Fourth was kingthisyearg and that being
king, he gave. sentence at' the Old Bailey P
35. 'John vii. 521
'"
Search and look," are
the words which that' writer puts into the
mouth of a
supposed ruler of the Jews, to
Ihomhe has given n Greek name--Nicode
naar- for out of Galilee ariseth no
prophet 5"
when every Jew knows that their most illust-
rions pmphets---their Nahum and their Jonah
'-.ewere both Galileans.
`
,
_
_36. Aa for any pretended harmony, or ¢on-
sistenoy with themselves, in the exhibition of
24
one uniform and perfect character, lput in
the clear judgement and cogent argumenta-
tion of the most learned Dr. Bretschneider,
who in his Probabilia (now on the table--it
is in the Latin tongue) seems to prove, that
the Jesus of John's Gospel is a wholly differ-
ent character from the Jesus of -Matthew,
Mark, and Luke. And Herbert Marsh,-
Bishop of Peterborough, has authenticated
the opinion, ,that the three first Gospels
are nothing more than translations, and
very bad translations too, from some
com-
mon Apocraphal Gospel which has been
lost; Translation of Michaelis's Introduction,
vol. 3, p. 2, p. 361. There are but four Gospels;
our English divines admit that three of them
are
good for nothing; and our German divines
admit that the fourth is absolutely good for
nothing.
37. As for the minute and intimate com-
parison with the contemporary historians of
that period, which our' author has the wick-
edness to assert---for surely it is wickedness
to lie so---that these writings are able to bear,
what must we say of the famous passage in-
the 7th of Luke, that "

38. There is no mention, by any Roman or
Greek historian, or by any ancient author, of
a decree in the reign of Augustus for taxing
all the world, or the whole Roman empire.
Judea was not at that time a Roman province,
and there could not be any taxing. made there
by a decree of Augustus; and Cyrenius was
not governor of Syria till nine or ten, perhaps
twelve .years after. (Lardner, vol. i. ch. 1,
p. 175.
39. Of the pretended massacre of the
children in Bethlehem, another fact, which,
had it happened, could not possibly have
escaped the notice _of contemporary histori-
ans. Should we
bring it to the comparison,
which our author challenges, what must we
think of histemerity? Again I take leave to
hide myself behind the sevenfold shield of a
Christian Ajax, and put in the admission of
the pious and learned Evanson, p. 126:

Josephus and" the Roman historians
give us
particular accounts of the character of
this Jewish king (Herod), who received his
sovereign authority from the Roman emperor;
and inform us of other acts of cruelty which
he was
guilty of in his own
family.--But of
this infamous inhuman butchery, they are en-
tirely silent. Under such circumstances, if
my eternal happiness depended upon it, I
could not believe it true. I am confident there
is no Jew that reads this chapter, who does
not laugh at the ignorant credulity of those
professed Christians, who receive such gross
palpable ialsehoods for the inspired word of
God, and lay the foundation of their religion
upon such incredible iictions as these." There
now! If lhad said that, Ishould have been
put down as a
complete infidel.
41. But I must reserve innumerable other
proofs, that crowd upon me with almost equal
claims, in further demonstration of all I un-.
dertook to demonstrate, for my reply, or for
future occasions.
_
r
Men and Brethren! If what I have now of-
fered seem to you as convincing as it does to
me, and I know not where nor with whom
the power ofg
conviction can be---if any thing
27
can be conceived more convincing--I earnest-_
ly commend this topic to the further prosecu_
tion of your own reiiections.
'
43. My Christian brethren,--if there be any
in this assembly who will answer to that
name--witness for me, I beseech you, be-
tween your own consciences, and those whom
you call the ministers of God`s word, whether
it be I or thaytlw stand before you (judging
from appearances only) with the greater ap-
pearance of sincerity and truth: they, if they
be wrong, yet arrogating the infallibility of
God himself, refusing to give an answer, and
rendering it impossible that their wrong
-should be set right: I, if I be wrong, yetcom-
ing to the light, courting the _means of further
instruction, desiring to be refuted, and en-
treating to be answered.
44. Call on them, I beseech you, to find me
a man, if there be one among them, who can
convict any thing I have said of fallacy or
error, that I may have the pleasure of correct-
ing that error. But wrong not your own no-
ble nature so
grievously, ncr so
impiously
dishonour the Author of nature, as to sup-
pose he can
possibly be the author of a re-
ligion, whose ministers and preachers shall
28
be found afraid and ashamed to come forward
in its defence, where they are liable to en-
counter the opposition of one who is able,
willing, and eager for the encounter; and
Who, plucking the wicked lable from all asso-
ciations with the sacred name of the Almighty,
would cast it to the earth, and exclaim, Great
God of Truth! it is thus I worship thee. Let
the man who believes in the book take it
up! V
