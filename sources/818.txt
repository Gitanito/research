      Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Spiritual Notes.
 A Monthly Epitome of the Transactions of Spiritual and Psychological Societies, and Auxiliary to the Spirit Circle, Medium, and Lecturer.
 1878--1881  Monthly
 London, England.  Publisher: E.W. Allen (for the proprietors).  Editor: Thomas Blyton.

 1/1, July 1878-1881.  2s., 6d. a year, 12-16 pp., illustrated (the first number has a picture of William Eglinton).  After its break with The Spiritualist, the BNAS used Spiritual Notes as its organ.  The journal also carried notable articles on the "Order of the White Cross" which Psychische Studien 6/10 (October 1879): 479 describes as a new secret society formed to teach the "higher truths" of spiritualism.  It was begun by Susie Willis Fletcher and lasted into the 1890s.  The order may be connected with Prentice Mulford, on whom see the note under White Cross Library, since Mrs. Fletcher claimed after Mulfordâ€™s death that he was working under the auspices of her Order of the White Cross.  During the period of its existence the journal was a chronicle of the doings of British spiritualism and spiritualists, including notably William Stanton Moses, Dr. Monck, W.H. Harrison, C. Reimers, James Burns, Kate Cook, Mrs. Billings, William Howitt, William Eglinton, and many more.  Supplements on the status and doings of the BNAS.  Harry Price Library, University of London; Boston Public Library; National Library of Scotland; BL; Society for Psychical Research; LOC.
