  		              		Experience Description   

    On June 26th, 1991, I woke up and ate cereal for breakfast. My two sisters were still in bed. Around 9 or 10, I went with my Aunt and two sisters to a community pool. We lived in a three-bedroom apartment; ironically it was apartment 911. When I walked into the pool area, the maintenance people were putting chlorine in the pool because it was green and murky. I remember the 'No Diving' signs were covered in vines and behind a tree. I was a seven-year-old kid and excited about being at the pool. 

  I was jumping into the pool and  hit the back of my head. I got out of the pool and told my Aunt that my head hurt. She made me sit down.  I sat on the bottom edge of the lawn chair at the 6-foot end of that pool for about two to five minutes. I felt better at the time and  thought I could go back in the pool. I told my Aunt  and she questioned to make  sure I was OK. I told her that I was.   
  
   I jumped in and was swimming towards the 3 foot mark in the pool. My right side stopped working. It was if the inside of me was burning, and the outside body was as cold as ice. My Aunt jumped in, rescued me, and carried me over to the steps at the shallow end of the pool. Although she was talking to me, nothing she was saying to me made any sense. I do remember trying to make the Ninja Turtle hand sign that looked like StarTrek's Mr. Spock's hand when he says, 'Live long and prosper.' I was trying to do this with my right side, but  could not do it. This was shocking to me. My Aunt Trish sent my sister Shannon home to call an ambulance. My grandma was at work, so my Aunt called her too. I was carried  to a lawn chair. 
  
   I remember my grandma showing up and trying to keep my attention. If she were not there, I would have passed away. She kept me fighting,  awake, and alert. Traumatic shock is the body's response to too much pain because it helps numb the pain. Then, I was taken into the ambulance.  
  
  I opened my eyes and  was staring at my body in the ambulance. The paramedics were working on me and my grandma was holding my hand. The paramedics told  my grandma to try to get my attention. The thing I remember before this was confusion, massive confusion. When I opened my eyes, however, I had crystal clear thoughts. I felt love, kindness, and peace of mind wash over me. All my senses were heightened. I was at peace, and I knew what that meant. At the roof of the ambulance, I saw a light. I did not see a tunnel because I was facing my body. I saw a light that was shining through me onto the body in the ambulance. My grandma looked hopeless, as if she was going to lose the little boy that she had taken care of. I will never forget the face of my grandmother.   The feelings I felt were so real and loving that it is hard to articulate. Nobody talked to me or  gave me instructions. All concepts of time or the feeling of time were gone. I felt like I was there for eternity.  I could have stayed because I had that choice. I made my decision to come back.

I woke up in the hospital.  I couldn't talk, walk, or think clearly. My aunt was by my side and smiling. It gave me immense comfort for her to be there.
