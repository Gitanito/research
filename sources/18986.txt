okay so yeah i think you guys are
getting it now
let&#39;s see yes we&#39;re live
so i&#39;m going to give you a quick sound
check
all right
um
there&#39;s clear sky and an object
materializes they&#39;re
here they have been waiting for an
appropriate response for
decades and they have not received one
until now
we&#39;re doing this the protocol it lifts
straight up
right here goes up turns left
partially going in and out of space time
and vanishes
all of their technologies are wired into
consciousness and thought
consciousness is a cosmic internet
that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing
first the expansion of consciousness and
meditation
you can then see them and then you can
communicate with them
had one fully materialized flesh and
blood
who have appeared and vanished and i see
this being come in
you see that the empowerment of everyone
in the audience
to become an ambassador to those
civilizations
welcome to my world so here&#39;s
how society has answered the call
so far we&#39;re going to have
the space force
they&#39;re like goddamn right space force
if millions of people start doing this
an
army of consciousness doing this it&#39;ll
overwhelm the covert systems
this is how disclosure will happen
it&#39;s time for the people to find the
solution
and here it is mass contact through
consciousness
citizens diplomacy ce5
this is the ultimate disclosure event
be part of history be part of the change
it&#39;s a call to action
are you guys ready it&#39;s only 6 38 oh
okay we have
you want to wait a few minutes
i&#39;m ron james we are here at the
scottsdale center for the performing
arts
for the theatrical premiere of dr steven
greer&#39;s close encounters of the fifth
kind
ce5 this has been a long time coming
we&#39;re playing it safe during the
pandemic but we&#39;re ready to see the film
and we&#39;re ready to do a little red
carpet set and interview some of the
people that were involved in it
so without further ado i would like to
invite dr steven greer
come on up let&#39;s talk a little bit
dr greer congratulations on the film
this is our third time
it&#39;s your third film third major film we
had serious we had unacknowledged
yes and now we have ce5 last night i
actually spent some time reviewing the
film again
and i really have to compliment you
because i feel as though
we have pretty much proven the existence
of a
non-human race interacting with the
human race right and now the question is
what&#39;s next yeah and this is the film
that points us in a really good
direction
yes that&#39;s why we did it because the
people
who i&#39;ve worked with for 30 years on the
ce5 team a lot of them are here
i mean there are people here have been
doing this for 29 years with me
um we know that these civilizations are
peaceful
we know that they want to have a
relationship
with humans they&#39;re desperate
for us to stop putting
this into a militarized violent paradigm
so the whole ce5 initiative is about
making contact peacefully with these
civilizations
and actually modeling that for
governments
and a lot of people don&#39;t know a few
years ago we alluded this briefly in the
film the president of france
uh at the time president sarkozy had his
ministry of defense
contact me and we did a training
exercise
in france with admiral moran
there and they&#39;re learning how to do
this
and they totally understood the fact
that these civilizations use
the science of consciousness and higher
states of consciousness
interfacing with electronic systems to
communicate
so of course that&#39;s the what i sort of
stumbled upon or experienced when i was
18
that i allude to in the film but that
now has become a model
for more enlightened people who aren&#39;t
living through a paradigm of
hate and fear and division the big task
is
getting enough people to do it in the
film we talk about
the one percent effect where if you get
one percent of the people in a higher
state of consciousness in meditation
doing something positive it shifts the
other 99
and this is quantum physics it&#39;s very
well established science
and so one percent of america is around
three million
one percent of the world&#39;s around 75
million
and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that we
do it and by the way i just want to say
jimmy lovato says hello to everyone
she&#39;s in california
she couldn&#39;t leave but she was planning
to be here but she&#39;s
very dedicated as you saw last month
we&#39;re in joshua tree
and we did a global meditation just
briefly
and um you know she on her instagram
account has 95 million people so
you know theoretically if we can get
enough people who are
aware of this and they network it to
other people and other influencers
i think what can happen is that we can
see the whole consciousness of the
planet shifts
not just to people who know about this
people don&#39;t even know about it right
right so that&#39;s really what&#39;s exciting
is that we&#39;ve reached the point now with
enough people learning about this
that we could get to that one percent
what&#39;s called phase transition effect
where suddenly the whole planet turns
towards the path of peace
instead of destruction and to me that&#39;s
what it&#39;s about that&#39;s what these ets
are waiting for
what&#39;s really interesting is that the
things that humanity has to do to
collectively correct its course
are common sense things that have been
taught by sages and
spiritual teachings forever and it&#39;s
almost like now we have
an extraterrestrial reinforcement of
what we know and it really boils down to
humanity needs to find its better angel
to get with the program
and stop all of this stuff and if we can
do that we&#39;re going to find our way into
this galactic family that
the sky&#39;s the limit literally yeah and
that&#39;s what they&#39;re waiting on
yes everyone says why don&#39;t they do this
why don&#39;t they do that i said it&#39;s the
wrong question
why don&#39;t we all of us form
teams that are ambassadors making
contact with
these civilizations that&#39;s what they&#39;re
waiting on they&#39;re waiting for a
critical mass
of humanity to do that in in light of
the fact that the governments
have completely mucked this up for 70
years
since the 40s then it&#39;s incumbent on we
the people to do it
and if we do it guess what i&#39;ve always
said if the people will lead the leaders
will follow
it really comes down to the individual
just like it always happens
so here&#39;s an interesting thing about the
power of consciousness
you know when they&#39;ve done studies with
random number generators
random numbers they found that one
person you know just
you don&#39;t have to be trained as a cia
remote viewer just a person off the
street here
was put in a lab they put their
awareness on the random number generator
it will shift if they&#39;re intending it to
shift and put out more ones and zeros it
will
most of the time but if you have two
people who love each other
who are coherent with each other who are
bonded
the what&#39;s interesting is that it&#39;s an
exponential increase in
effect now what what is going on there
and this is the heart math people and
others have talked about that
the resonance between consciousness and
the heart and it turns out the heart
literally has
tens of thousands of neurons and so the
the resonance factor where you add the
i mean it sounds mushy but it isn&#39;t the
love factor
the peaceful factor the uh
sense of oneness factor as well as
consciousness itself when those two
things sync up
it&#39;s an exponentially greater effect
which is
another interesting point about the
movie you know i&#39;ve interviewed adam and
i&#39;ve interviewed russell targe and i&#39;ve
interviewed dr edgar mitchell and almost
everybody else in the film i&#39;ve sat with
at one time or another and what we&#39;re
discovering about physics
the nature of reality how all this stuff
works right is tying in to our contact
with these beings
and so all of this stuff all of this
knowledge and things that were far apart
and esoterically separated at one point
are fusing together
into the next step in humanity&#39;s journey
that&#39;s right you know there are
if you look at the little teeny logo we
have here um
that triangle as you all know
happened from a crop circle in 1992
we were doing a ce5 expedition i was up
on a at woodbury hill
and that one night we went up there with
about 12 people
and i said you know what what if we once
we get up there we&#39;ll decide
on a shape and ask the ets to create
that in a crop circle you know even
though
probably 80 of them are hoaxed sure but
the ones that were real
this was in you know this is 28 years
ago and
so we went up there and we did the ce5
contact meditation and then deep when we
were in deep consciousness we all sent
out
this shape that equilateral triangle
three circles
and within a few hours within line side
of where we were that appeared in the
field a farmer found it in the wee hours
as the sun was coming up
which is like five in the morning and
that far north in july
in england and what was interesting is
that
it was this amazing acknowledgement that
if you guys
build it and we will come all right yes
so if if humans
make the effort at all instead of being
passive
and make contact there are all kinds of
wondrous mysterious ways
that these really advanced civilizations
will say yes
we hear you we&#39;re going to do it and i
think part of that is because
any civilization that goes beyond the
speed of light
they are transdimensional which means
they are
moving and understand the more conscious
realms
of the other dimensions which include
consciousness
what the mystics called the astral body
the fault body
the body of light all those are even
though that it&#39;s been relegated to
mysticism and debunked
that&#39;s actually the science of the next
thousand years
but people don&#39;t realize we&#39;re getting a
glimpse into the next thousands of years
of science on earth
because zero point energy free energy
anti-gravity that was all done and
established by october 1954
a year before i was born and i&#39;m no
spring chicken i just turned 65
in june so the reality is
that just has to be disclosed but and
that has to happen
yeah okay because otherwise we&#39;re just
going to destroy the biosphere
but the real task is in the level of
consciousness
because that is if we get that right
and we get the peaceful awareness and
working together
lovingly peacefully together the rest of
it will come
it will absolutely come and anybody that
wants to really can get involved in the
ce5
and they can have their own experience
right and for people who watch this film
and maybe you&#39;re not sure
that what you&#39;re seeing can apply it
really you can join one of these groups
and you can go out and you can actually
make these things happen
and once you&#39;ve had that experience it
changes you from the inside out
once it happens to you there&#39;s really no
going back and and
questioning yourself it happened and you
were there yeah and there&#39;s uh there are
hundreds of thousands of people around
the world doing this now it needs to be
a few tenths of millions so that&#39;s what
this documentary
is about that&#39;s what the premiere is
about let&#39;s get the word out
because now it&#39;s uh it&#39;s on amazon prime
so
anyone who has amazon prime in the world
with a couple hundred million people
can see both unacknowledged and close
encounters of the fifth kind
it just came out on amazon prime and
just so people get a little glimpse of
this
we&#39;re working to get it out on youtube
movies
soon and uh pluto and tubi and these
other sites so if you don&#39;t have a prime
subscription get that
and i&#39;m open to the public if they know
of large platforms that could host this
in places like india china
and other places um you know they should
contact us and see if we can get it out
there
because this film yeah i i should have
said this before
i open my mouth by anything else thank
you thank you thank you all these people
a lot of the people here funded this
film we have never had
corporate ownership
we&#39;ve raised 905 000
for this documentary and for the
campaign to get
the information out from donors and
they&#39;ve ranged from one dollar
to a little over a hundred thousand
dollars and that&#39;s how you actually fund
it serious
all of them all these documentaries
nobody owns it
yes we so nobody can tell us put that in
take that out
so that&#39;s why you know the people funded
this the people own it and that&#39;s why we
want to get it out to as
many people as possible now one thing
i&#39;ll just say
a few hundred thousand dollars is not a
much of a
amount to do a feature film and an ad
campaign or marketing or getting the
word out
but it can happen in light of the fact
that we don&#39;t have millions of dollars
to put into
uh what most people do to get the word
out on something
it can be done by person to person this
way through the internet
through um social media influencers and
people like demi lovato and
i mean i just had a text from logan paul
you know
break a leg great bro you know all kinds
of people are interested in this a
stephen tyler of aerosmith
and people say why would you even care
about people who are like
i said because i i&#39;m a just
a doctor trying to do this retired from
emergency medicine
those people have followings that are in
the millions tens of millions
that&#39;s how we get the word out so
everyone needs to help us network that
because
honestly the crowdfunding the movie
itself
getting the word out and i just want to
say the distributor that&#39;s distributing
it
pays zero dollars for
marketing or getting the word out or
social media nothing
we have to provide that so i want people
to understand this is not some grand
multi-million dollar corporation doing
this is just us everyone standing here
who have contributed
and i want to thank all of you for doing
that what you did with your initial
crowd funding for sirius
and how big you grew now into the third
film
the deals you got with like netflix i
mean these were groundbreaking deals for
non-fiction
films you know congratulations as an
aside just on that
and what you&#39;ve done with this film you
found good distribution and it&#39;s really
getting out there it&#39;s got huge numbers
of reviews
on amazon and you can usually tell how a
film is doing just by the number of
reviews because it&#39;s a very small
percentage of views yep and so people
are watching this film
yes yes it&#39;s actually had more it&#39;s had
more reviews on amazon
than most 100 to 200 million dollar
hollywood films get yeah that&#39;s exactly
so
what i&#39;m saying is that and but this is
with really no marketing budget no big
corporate and we&#39;re not you know part of
universal studios
so but that&#39;s the power of the people
this is what i keep saying it&#39;s the
power of the people
um and i think that also the strength of
the message you know when you look at
the film you see
there are people from every walk of life
all over the world
who are in the movie saying i have a
team doing this and here&#39;s what&#39;s
happened
and the thing that makes me happiest
honest to god
is when people you know do
the ce5 protocols they go out with a
pure heart and a sincere intent they
have these amazing
contact experiences and i&#39;m not there i
only find out about it
i almost never find out about it because
it&#39;s very hard i just
thought there&#39;s so many people there&#39;s a
lot to keep up with and we don&#39;t
and the other thing we don&#39;t have an
office or staff so my wife
i want to thank emily uh for the i mean
you know she&#39;ll be 72 next month we&#39;ve
been doing this 30 years
she&#39;s been great to work with too yeah
and and but we&#39;ve never had
paid staff or office and a lot of people
are shocked i said no we don&#39;t
you know whatever we get we put it out
we create something put out keep moving
but that the reason we&#39;ve gotten this
far
is the how wonderful people are who
understand the purpose the message and
um
help well you know the other thing is
you&#39;ve been delivering the goods
there&#39;s a lot of people out there making
these films there&#39;s a lot of just wild
stuff out there
but from serious through unacknowledged
to this it&#39;s always
this these are facts you can verify it
and and we&#39;re really laying something
out that&#39;s
that&#39;s real and it&#39;s not pie in the sky
and it&#39;s not too crazy to absorb right
and so you know that&#39;s another reason
why your films just keep getting
exponentially
more viewers and fans and by the way
this documentary close encounters of
fifth kind is the number one
crowdfunded documentary in history
ever in any genre and that&#39;s close to
the people you know and so
i think syria set that same record it
was the same record and then another one
over some star trek documentary somehow
this is number one and so what that
means is without and we didn&#39;t have any
budget
we just kind of put the word out through
our email list and social media
and people came up and helped and
that is how we keep going forward
eventually
my hope is that we can do that with a
new energy
research lab that&#39;s open source uh the
next
big thing is you know we&#39;ve done
disclosure project
close encounters with fifth kind but the
third part of that triangle
this is why we visualized it to connect
some dots for folks
is that the third part of it is the
science and technology part of it
that needs to come out if we&#39;re going to
have a sustainable civilization
eliminate poverty fix the biosphere
correct the environmental degradation
and have a civilization
worthy of being space faring you&#39;re not
going to do that with nuclear power
plants and
coal-fired and uh and no offense to elon
musk
battery driven cars you have to plug
into a grid
that&#39;s running off of coal or gas which
is 90
of it so we have to come out with these
technologies that have been illegally
sequestered right and bring it out but
it has to be done open source
you&#39;re never going to do this with
intellectual property you&#39;re never going
to do it through the patent office it
will absolutely be killed oh no because
they&#39;ll take the same thing and they&#39;ll
put it in a box and make money off
well it won&#39;t change society the way
this is so dangerous
that if the lab working on it isn&#39;t live
streamed on the internet
the people working on it are dead men
walking and i speak from personal
knowledge of this so
that&#39;s the next thing we&#39;ve got to do so
we people say you can&#39;t do every i said
well we&#39;ve got to learn to walk and chew
gum
we got to make peaceful contact but if
we have peaceful contact with these
civilizations but we destroy the
biosphere
that&#39;s not good if we fix the
environment but we go to
defcon 1 and have an interplanetary
conflict because that&#39;s what the
warmongers and sociopaths want
that&#39;s no good so we&#39;ve got to kind of
get
you know heaven and earth together here
you know i mean it&#39;s really critical and
it&#39;s it
i don&#39;t want to go into too much about
that and it&#39;s negative but
you know the you can&#39;t kick the can down
the road forever
well you know one thing that i noticed
is here there&#39;s a lot of sections in the
film that talk about controlling the
narrative
and there&#39;s another narrative that this
e.t presence is some sort of a threat
yes and i know lou alexander and i know
chris mellon
and i have actually seen a trend even on
their part
to kind of move away from this threat
thing they&#39;ve they&#39;ve they&#39;ve been doing
it
on their twitters they&#39;ve been doing it
in the in well that&#39;s all
what fraud that is yeah that you know
the dangerous part of it
corollaries to that have been going into
the white house and on capitol hill
exactly saying the same thing so
hopefully these guys will quit
sounding the trumpet of alarm and start
getting a little bit more on the page of
this does not have to be
a bad dangerous thing well you know one
thing i say to people because you cannot
prove a negative
if somebody is addicted to you know look
we&#39;re a tribal society
that we love to have someone to hate so
you know the demagogues always exploit
black versus white gay versus straight
uh rich versus poor communist versus
capitalist this versus
that so
the the differences amongst humanity
which are
incredibly beautiful actually can always
be exploited by some
sociopath and that&#39;s what most of
history proves whether it&#39;s a religious
sociopath
a political sociopath some power hungry
nut job but we can rise above that
we don&#39;t have to be brainwashed into
that and you know when i was sitting
with demi lovato the first time i met
her back
some months ago and she became a very
enthusiastic fan
oh she loves what we&#39;re doing yeah she&#39;s
very sweet about it very sincere
and i said you know what&#39;s the color of
consciousness
what&#39;s the color of mind what&#39;s the
color of this
essence of the human spirit has no color
has no creed has no ethnicity it has no
actual
religion per se it&#39;s transcendent
so we&#39;re going to have to find and
people say well it&#39;s our shared humanity
i said that would have been interesting
in 1900. in 2020
we have civilizations from elsewhere
concerned about us
weaponizing space all right
and doing other things that are really
dangerous
like atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs so
get into that
some other time so those civilizations
what is their ethnic genetic connection
to us well there could be some
but they&#39;re going to be very different
they&#39;re going to be more different than
someone from japan
versus the congo all right so we&#39;re
going to have to go
beyond this divisive consciousness into
this state of
unity consciousness and oneness and the
only way to do that is understand
the light of consciousness that&#39;s within
every single person
and as urban schrodinger the physicist
said the total number of minds in the
universe
is one it&#39;s a singularity so
i think that is one of the really big
messages of the film
that&#39;s how we can go beyond the
cacophony of divisiveness
and instead of you know our our
differences being things we fight over
they should be things that are beautiful
like the varieties
of a garden all the different flowers
and colors
but we have this the sap running in us
the the essence running within us is a
singularity
and so when we realize that then we can
go beyond all the
the temptations of division and hatred
that the demagogues
always try to exploit well you know one
thing about coming together in that way
that people can&#39;t really seem to bridge
is that it&#39;s okay to
acknowledge differences and there are
things to be celebrated not
as a basis of fear or superiority and so
i think that humanity&#39;s got a ways to go
before they can cross that boundary and
reach that understanding collectively
but it&#39;s what we have to do well
actually
most people are there it&#39;s just the the
people who want to
i love that in vogue song free oh mind
you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re gonna free
your mind of all the crap that&#39;s being
force-fed to you
on the internet in the media i&#39;m gonna
start partying early here no i won&#39;t
um so you&#39;ve got to get your mind freed
from that
it&#39;s sort of a you know sort of a mind
thing yes
um and i think we can do that but the
meditative state is really important
because when
when people go into quiet deep
meditation they can experience a state
of awareness
that is the singularity it&#39;s the oneness
that we all are whether you&#39;re human or
from the andromeda galaxy
and um speaking of which we we can
in a moment have the the wonderful woman
who
uh dear friend for quarter of a century
who took that photo is here
the e.t from the andromeda galaxy that
was a pretty interesting photo there&#39;s a
lot of visual evidence in this film
that&#39;s really hard
to not acknowledge and and notice which
is another milestone in the film
it delivers the goods so i&#39;ll tell you
what i know that you&#39;ve got some people
that were a part of the film yeah
yep i will uh step off we&#39;re going to
roll the trailer for just a second
okay so do it quick so kill my audio and
roll the trailer please
thank you thanks for your help thank you
dr greer hey raven you want to come up
is it two here
there&#39;s clear sky and an object
materializes they&#39;re here
they have been waiting for an
appropriate response for decades
and they have not received one until now
we&#39;re doing this
the protocol it lifts straight up right
here
it goes up turns left person
in and out of space i can&#39;t see everyone
out there how is everyone doing
everyone here coming into the premiere
yeah consciousness is a
cosmic internet that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing
first the expansion of consciousness and
meditation
you can then see them and then you can
we have to be six feet away
fully materialized flesh and blood um
who have appeared
right here and i see this right there
okay
you see that the empowerment of everyone
in the audience
to become an ambassador to those
civilizations
welcome to my world so here&#39;s how
society has answered the call so far
we&#39;re going to have the space force
and like goddamn right space force
if millions of people start doing this
an
army of consciousness doing this it&#39;ll
overwhelm the covert systems
this is how disclosure will happen
it&#39;s time for the people to find the
solution
and here it is mass contact through
consciousness
citizens diplomacy ce5
this is the ultimate disclosure event
be part of history be part of the change
it&#39;s a call to action
who&#39;s just joining us uh welcomes them
to the premiere for
close encounters of the fifth kind and i
want to introduce one of my closest
friends in the world
uh raven bulsie who has been on our team
uh since when 1990 98
98 so 22 years
and raven is someone who
is only deeply intuitive and spiritual
but just an amazing uh solid
person that i trust with everything
but that kind of love and bond
that develops over time with our ce5
teams
results in amazing experiences together
so i just
uh those of you uh we&#39;ll see in the
movie if you haven&#39;t seen it yet
um there is an a part of it where we
talk about this et that appeared
a few years ago at joshua tree national
park
and uh it was late at night
and uh i want to set up kind of the
first
part of what happened and you can talk
about how you ended up getting this
amazing photograph
so we were up in joshua tree national
park
that&#39;s where i was with demi lovato a
month ago a few weeks ago
and we you know make a circle we&#39;re out
under the stars in the middle of 800 000
acres
um beautiful and uh we took a break
partway you know through our process you
can&#39;t sit for five hours
so we had gone to down this path
going to the east and um
so there were a couple people with me
and suddenly there was this
uh sphere that was the size of like a
grapefruit
that materialized right by my right
shoulder
and uh i looked at it and the other
another person next to me saw it and i
said they&#39;re here
because these civilizations because
they&#39;re going through other dimensions
can de-materialize and re-materialize
but they can be in a form that you can
see but it isn&#39;t a solid 3-d
metallic form so i saw that and i went
all right we need to go back and form
the circle
so we go back to form the circle and i&#39;m
calling everyone back
to get in a coherence
because everyone&#39;s talking they&#39;re on
break and it&#39;s you&#39;re outside
and then suddenly i hear on out so just
a few feet outside the circle
a group of five et&#39;s talking
well not english and not any language of
earth but you could hear them talking
and everyone heard uh female voices
which i heard
but but i heard a male voice i remember
i said oh there&#39;s no
there&#39;s one guy in this crowd it&#39;s like
me and my family
i have four daughters three sisters the
only male in a family of ten women
live to tell the tale anyway so uh
so we get back and so you know i i
somehow i say something to you about you
know when you get a uh
take a photo who has a camera and then
you what did you experience and do i
mean
so i i went back to the circle kind of
because he was telling everyone to get
back so
i was one of the first people back in
the circle and there was just one person
next to me
and so i just started randomly shooting
photos
it was pitch black the
the picture i took was only a three
second exposure and i was holding my
breath so
i wouldn&#39;t shake um and all the
uh frames that i took were completely
black but there was one that had
like a bright light in it and
so by that time everyone had come back
to the circle so
i just waited until the evening and i
put it in my computer and then i
realized that
there was this being floating above one
of the chairs um
and it was like looking right at me in
the photo i&#39;m waving
yeah it was like this
so yeah it was pretty amazing and
actually
earlier in that day in the morning
we were actually hearing voices in our
house as well like
we were talking quietly and there were
these extra voices
whispering amongst us so it was the
whole day had been kind of building up
to this
event right right and actually
when you see the photo it you know the
movie only shows a little bit of it but
if you look at the uh online on our
website
you&#39;ll see more and it&#39;s the the
there&#39;s a sphere that&#39;s on the left
that illuminates all the chairs and then
this being
that&#39;s about a i don&#39;t know four or five
feet tall
um a male a receding hairline
and that&#39;s sort of floating like this
and wait
i know i said oh well i don&#39;t feel so
bad
so you know i got a little burn
my increasingly large forehead no i need
a hat anyway
so uh that&#39;s what you know
when i saw that i said well that&#39;s the
sphere that was right beside my shoulder
right but it had been dematerialized and
followed us back to the group
now the part of this story that isn&#39;t in
the movie well you might as well tell it
we have a little bit of time
is that we then have these electronic
sensing devices
so when we got back in the circle
we have um magnetic field meters that
pick up the magnetic field shift and
they&#39;re all
part of the protocol where we ask the
ets to communicate through them like
they would through a
morse code or something so suddenly they
started going off we&#39;re out in the
middle of 800 000 acres there should be
nothing setting these
devices off including
radar and laser detectors and all these
electronics
and i said oh that&#39;s them so i would ask
a question
and that&#39;s how we came they told us that
this being particular being whose name
was bijou
from the andromeda galaxy that they&#39;ve
been following what we were doing for
quite a while and that kind of dialogue
went on for
i don&#39;t know 45 minutes or an hour yeah
about an hour i&#39;d say
it was an amazing experience and it
he has come on other expectations too
that we had where we felt his presence
and um had the same dialogue through the
electronic systems
so interestingly what you&#39;ll find if you
do this
these craft will appear the beans will
appear they&#39;ll be in and out of 3d
we had at that same site one year poor
et&#39;s in the flesh that appeared and
when someone got too excited they then
dematerialized something like that of a
science fiction movie but that is sort
of thing happens quite often
but what&#39;s amazing about this is that
this one i i think here&#39;s what i think
because of her pure-heartedness and she
asked permission
to take his picture that&#39;s why he came
in and out of this dimension allowed
himself to be
so there&#39;s a certain amount it&#39;s like
when you go to native american land
you need to respect it you need to honor
it and you ask permission
you don&#39;t go through there like a bull
in a china shop but
you know raven did that
it yeah i mean there&#39;s been so many
experiences over the years
um but you know the protocols work and
it&#39;s
i mean there&#39;s just so many things you
just can&#39;t even begin to
like talk about because they&#39;re they&#39;re
so internal but
it&#39;s just it&#39;s amazing and you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s fantastic that this is becoming a
global
movement really yep it&#39;s time open
contact
and if the governments won&#39;t do it we
will absolutely yeah
thank you raven thank you hey
uh hey justice and pat why don&#39;t you
guys come up here i want you to talk
about
can the person who&#39;s smoking the cigar
put it out for me
thanks no yeah hi
so these guys don&#39;t have to associate
they&#39;re in my house and they&#39;re all good
come a little closer is this better
lift it up okay
so these two people you probably if
you&#39;ve seen the movie
so the uh this is pet peer saw
and justin justice campbell and
uh they have been on our team for a
number of years and they
actually helped train people in texas
right we do go texas and
i wanted you guys to kind of share what
your experience has been
on these expeditions just whatever comes
to mind and also what you&#39;ve been doing
in texas to help get other people
educated about this okay you want me to
start
sure um you know people ask me
uh about my experiences on these
expeditions with you
and they&#39;ll say uh have you had any have
you had any experiences
and i and i usually say to them you know
i i wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin
i wouldn&#39;t know where to begin if
there&#39;s been that much um
i mean i can just kind of a little bit
say i&#39;ve been
ended up on a craft uh i&#39;ve ended up
inside mountains
i&#39;ve ended up having ets in my room
it&#39;s been a when i started this i
couldn&#39;t have imagined this
this would have sounded like really
really science fiction to me really
but now it is completely
commonplace when i go on these things
for this to happen
it happens all the time it happens
numerous times on an expedition and that
group coherency
that happens when you have 25 or 30
people on a
on a week-long event like this is
just so powerful that it pulls in all
kinds of energy it&#39;s amazing
and i am forever grateful to you
seriously forever grateful to you for
for these opportunities really it&#39;s been
really wonderful uh yeah yeah
it&#39;s great yeah and and
justice uh interestingly
you got you can share what you&#39;ve been
doing but first i want to make a
editorial comment look at the movie
those of you online
all the way to the end of the credits
because there&#39;s a really cool photograph
way at the end
that we had to drop in at the end
because we were really at final cut on
it
from exactly a year ago and we were at
joshua tree national park again
and it was so cold
that i do this sanskrit ceremony of
pooja and there was
little water on the table in these brass
containers and it froze to a block of
ice the flowers all froze everything
froze
the orange froze the orange froze um so
uh in one of those moments when we had
to go in and get warm
uh he has an excellent camera
and he was taking pictures and you look
at this
photo and there are these two et&#39;s with
elongated heads
sitting in two of our chairs that we had
vacated yeah
and it&#39;s an aston and if they were there
people who were there they were
experiencing that
while we were in circle but we left and
the camera they
they allowed themselves to come into 3d
and be
uh photographed and it&#39;s an amazing
photograph so i don&#39;t know you may want
to talk about this kind of experience
you&#39;ve had because he does great work
with cameras i
if you give me a camera all i do is
break it i&#39;m like six ten
thumbs except for the ventilator or
chest tube or something
but uh well let me let me just tell you
it&#39;s been a real honor to be able to go
to the expeditions with you it&#39;s been a
learning experience
like none other people don&#39;t realize
it&#39;s not just about being out under the
stars
but it&#39;s all of the training you give
during the day it&#39;s like a doctorate
in in higher consciousness and it&#39;s
really wonderful so thank you thank you
for that
and uh that night i remember it was like
you said
freezing cold i mean the puja water when
we dumped it we laughed because it was a
chunk of ice
that fell out and hit the ground it was
that cold and the team had gone inside
to warm up
and i forgot the camera outside it was
continually shooting pictures every 20
seconds
and the et&#39;s sat right in the two chairs
right in front of the camera and it
turned out to be a beautiful photo
it&#39;s beautiful yeah they were they were
sitting for a shot they knew it was
going
so all kinds of strange things like that
they go what
no and this is nothing&#39;s photoshopped
nothing&#39;s fake
it&#39;s all real exactly and so what i tell
people this is what happens
people have asked me how often when you
do these ce5 events do you see a craft
or being i said
every single time
every time and the reason for it is that
they&#39;re very interested they&#39;re eager
desperate i&#39;d even use the word
to find humans on earth now
that aren&#39;t brainwashed with the
divisiveness of
good and bad and you know war
and all that who are simply going to be
pure-hearted
at which you know justice is one of the
most pure-hearted men i&#39;ve ever known
pat is the one most pure-hearted and
that purity of heart
and intent and clarity of consciousness
and integrity
is what they&#39;re interested in they don&#39;t
care if you&#39;re a billionaire they don&#39;t
care if you have an md or a phd
or a construction worker or janitor they
care
about your consciousness and your intent
and your state of heart now you may want
to speak to that also
the heart yeah yeah i um i
throughout this i had i basically had
started meditating when i was 12.
so i&#39;m a long time meditator but it
really was not until
really i think maybe four years ago when
i started doing expeditions with you
that i i started adding um
i started adding love to my meditations
i would just go into a meditation i
would fill my heart with love which took
me forever to figure out how to do that
you would think it would be simple
it is simple but it the world had made
it complicated
and when you go in and you make that you
fill your heart with love and then you
start sending that out to the world
this is really to me honestly this is
we&#39;ve talked about this
dozens of times this is possibly to me
one of the most
absolutely important things that the
civilization on this planet
really can do is to meditate to fill
your heart with love and then
send that out and learn to love
all other people because really we talk
about how much we love et&#39;s and that we
want
to make that connection but we really
have to start on this planet
i mean we actually have to learn to love
each other here first
really so that is to me that
meditation that higher states of
consciousness that you get into with
that
and the love connection really to me is
the most important
it is that way that you contact
and communicate with these higher uh
consciousness civilizations because
that&#39;s where they reside
right yes yeah yeah they do beautiful
really
yeah it is beautiful you want to talk
about what you&#39;ve been doing in uh
near dallas with training uh anything
because
to me what justice and pat have been
doing is what i&#39;d like everyone to do
they learn how to do this
and you know in medicine we have a
saying see one do one teach one
what does that mean you see it done once
then you do it and the next time you&#39;re
teaching someone else to do it
so the both of them have just there are
a lot of people doing that all over the
world but they&#39;re here
uh in spite of the craziness of covid
and i that they have really been doing
an amazing
job of helping other people understand
this
so tell me kind of what you guys do
every month well thank you steve yeah we
have uh
um we call it ce5 yes a lot of people
you know
they come from different walks of life
and we come together as a group
and when you have them set all their
differences aside and
we build that cohesion it&#39;s absolutely
amazing
what happens we&#39;ll have contact on the
ground
it can be just scintillating lights or
we&#39;ll have crafts in the sky
and i&#39;ve had video um tapes of crafts
that are
approximately two miles up to one that
we measured about 13 miles big
two months ago yes absolutely amazing
yep massive
and that&#39;s oh by the way we&#39;re in
phoenix
i just realized oh my god all right i
you know i&#39;m doing a lot so i get kind
of
someone says you know you are in phoenix
so there&#39;s a wonderful medical doctor
here named dr lynn ketai
who was going to be here but because
kovat and her her husband&#39;s
health condition she didn&#39;t want to do
that
but as you know she had a book about the
phoenix lights
speaking of two to three mile cross
objects
most people in phoenix don&#39;t realize
that in
march of 1997 everybody you know about
that event where this object
came across the arizona skies
that was a ce5 it&#39;s a close encounter of
the fifth kind
and what happened to make what time do i
have
we have five minutes okay i&#39;ll make this
quick so i was flying in
that night to meet at a digital lab here
with a picture editor from the bbc who
was volunteering
to put together the best photos and
videos for me to give
to members of congress for the briefings
we were doing for congress in 1997 in
april
and when i was i was on the flight and
we were on final approach
to sky harbor airport and i went into
meditation
and i did the ce5 protocols and i asked
the et&#39;s to do something that&#39;d be
unmistakable that we could take back
and give to these members of congress we
landed i go to this lab we&#39;re down in
tempe near tempe and this
retired general who was the spook who
was in this
lab comes running in at like 8 30 or
something like that it was at night
he goes my god the mother ship is right
over
so we go out and hear this huge thing
how many people saw that that night
so i said oh well they came and so the
world
no one knew that that was a ce5 but the
reason that happened
is that we had found out that the
clinton administration
was not going to help so we were
pivoting to getting this information to
members of congress
and so i asked ets to do something that
would be
um dispositive and seen by a lot of
people and they did
so that&#39;s how that event happened in
march in 1997
um don&#39;t really talk about it that often
but it&#39;s
it&#39;s a wonderful and marcel thank you
for all the work
and by the way anybody can do this with
a pure heart
anybody can do contact yeah absolutely
i&#39;m not special
all of you can do it thank you all we&#39;ll
see in the theater
thank you i&#39;m gonna do the transition
and then we&#39;ll uh
thank you appreciate it thank you dr
greer all right soon we&#39;re going to
cut to dr stephen greer giving his
pre-film presentation
and then that&#39;s going to be the end of
the live stream for tonight but i urge
you to check out the movie
on amazon prime and some of the other
places you can see it which is pretty
much anywhere
so this is in my opinion his best film
yet it really delivers the goods
it&#39;s something everybody should see and
so enjoy the film
enjoy dr greer&#39;s presentation in the
theater in about 10 minutes
and we are going to cut to the trailer
and then a static plate while we
change the cameras and then we&#39;ll see
you again back in the theater
can you roll the trailer please
you&#39;re gonna stay for the whole evening
right probably
okay buddy yeah okay so here&#39;s what
we&#39;re doing
there&#39;s clear sky and an object
materializes they&#39;re
here they have been waiting for an
appropriate response
for decades and they have not received
one
until now we&#39;re doing the protocol it
lifts straight up
right here goes up turns left
partially going in and out of space time
and vanishes
all of their technologies are wired into
consciousness and thought
consciousness is a cosmic internet
that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing
first the expansion of consciousness and
meditation
you can then see them and then you can
communicate with them
as one fully materialized flesh and
blood
who have appeared and vanished and i see
this being come
in you see that the empowerment of
everyone in the audience to become an
ambassador to those
civilizations welcome to my world
so here&#39;s how society has
answered the call so far we&#39;re going to
have
the space
and like god damn force space boys
if millions of people start doing this
an
army of consciousness doing this it&#39;ll
overwhelm the covert systems
this is how disclosure will happen
it&#39;s time for the people to find the
solution
and here it is mass contact through
consciousness
citizens diplomacy ce5
this is the ultimate disclosure event
be part of history be part of the change
it&#39;s a call to action
and uh in particular everyone who
appeared in it
daniel sheehan and
david marconi in the state they couldn&#39;t
make it either they&#39;re in california
and of course they&#39;re not wanting people
to go out and most of all i&#39;d like to
welcome all of you on behalf of demi
lovato she was going to be here she&#39;s
very disappointed she put me
she&#39;s an enormous supporter of what
we&#39;re doing and
she wanted me to tell you that she&#39;s so
excited uh to be part
of this and be doing cp5
contact meditation with all of the
people in the world that she can
educate about this and so we wanted to
extend her hello
to you that she could not be here
tonight for reasons i&#39;m sure you&#39;re all
aware if you watch the news
so i&#39;d also like to thank the
people who are on the staff here if you
see all the people who
have the little badges all of our people
are volunteers
so a big round of applause
you know that includes you know of
course alera who has sort of helped
head this out adrian uh who
helped find this facility and get the
ball rolling
and bringing us here to scottsdale i&#39;d
like to
thank uh shane who&#39;s picked out the
music for tonight in the after party
and uh i&#39;d like to thank uh of the
people on
the the film who
have appeared had the courage justice
and pat
and raven and all the people who
appeared in the field are all people who
were on our 65 teams around the world
and they were willing to you know go
forward
and speak the truth about this so now
the world knows
you know this documentary is number one
in the world
on itunes and amazon this spring when it
came out
and it&#39;s now on amazon prime
as well as unacknowledged and i i&#39;m
really excited that
in the next month or two it will be able
to be on
uh youtube movies and a lot of the other
uh streaming platforms that don&#39;t
require a subscription
so our goal is to get this message out
to the maximum number of people
so that we achieve that one percent
effect that you&#39;re going to see
in in the film and what that&#39;s a it
means that when about one percent of the
population
are coherent meditating for a
specific purpose it tilts changes
the rest of the 99 and that means
that we don&#39;t need it&#39;s not like a
political campaign
it means that we can change the world
with a relatively small number of people
if we do it in the correct manner with
consciousness and meditation
and purity of heart what we&#39;re talking
about during the
red carpet outside so that&#39;s the key
thing for us to take away from this is
that people get very discouraged at the
time of all the problems that the world
is facing
but as bad as the problems are the
solution can happen
very quickly but it means we have to
move in that direction so
this this documentary is about 30 years
of research
and contact and the results that have
occurred
from people going forward
to make contact with these civilizations
as citizens
of earth and that&#39;s what these
extraterrestrial civilizations are
waiting for
it&#39;s true that we need to fix a lot of
problems with our
political leadership whether it&#39;s in
washington or elsewhere
but the truth is is that the ets are
asking that we the people reach out to
them
and if we do they&#39;ll respond now they&#39;re
going to respond in ways that may not be
what you want
you know we all have our fixed ideas
that an interstellar civilization needs
to look like we do
except the 747 flying over it&#39;s an et
craft that&#39;s not how this works
their reality is that their
civilizations that go beyond the speed
of light that go from one star system to
another
they have mastered the science of
consciousness
as well as we&#39;ve mastered picking up our
phone talking to each other
using electromagnetic signals at the
speed of light
so we&#39;re dealing with an entirely new
paradigm where
the operating system for
all of these civilizations is based in
the science of consciousness
which is why that&#39;s a major part of this
film
and a major part of the ce5 protocols
if you go to ce5 uh contact
app which is on all the stores now
you&#39;ll see that the main thrust of it
there&#39;s a lot of technical information
but the main thrust is
the meditative state the ability to go
into consciousness and see remote places
and
to become an ambassador to them by
inviting them
politely to come so if we invite them
politely to come
they will come and i think that&#39;s one of
the reasons why
we have to do this within the context of
universal peace
we like as humans to divide into camps
and tribes and fight
and argue but these civilizations if
they&#39;ve survived
the nuclear threshold of technology
never mind
the zero point energy and high end of
trans-dimensional physics that go beyond
the speed of light
technology threshold and they haven&#39;t
blown themselves up
they&#39;ve learned some lessons that we
must learn urgently
and that is that our civilization in
order for it to go forward
will have to become a peaceful
civilization on earth and a peaceful
civilization
in space i was just on the phone uh
earlier this week with phil rozen who of
course was werner von braun
a spokesperson and worked with him in
the last days of his life
and who was asked by bernard von braun
who invented the rock at radolf hitler
as you know
to work on keeping our space
around the earth free weapons and the
reason for that
is that he knew we weren&#39;t alone and
that these extraterrestrial
civilizations were extremely concerned
about us putting weapons in space as
well as our
large weapons of mass destruction atomic
weapons hydrogen bombs and things of
this sort
and part of that is because when we do
something on that level of destruction
it isn&#39;t left in a linear space-time
the electromagnetic pulse goes beyond
linear space-time and it&#39;s destructive
across the universe through these other
dimensions and that&#39;s something that
most people don&#39;t realize
and that&#39;s why in the 40s there was such
a massive
response from extraterrestrial
civilizations to the earth as we began
to
play around unwisely with atomic and
hydrogen bombs uh in the 50s the
hydrogen bomb was in the 50s
and that is a key thing for us to
understand we have not fixed that
problem
so the way we fix it in terms of our
relationship with these civilizations
is that we don&#39;t keep piling on in terms
of
viewing their presence as a threat
as you all know if you&#39;ve seen the
things we put out in the last 24 hours
i&#39;ve been working with
people very close to the administration
in the white house and also people who
are very close to the biden
transition team to try to get an
understanding where this information can
be disclosed
but within the context of a peaceful
announcement
and a hopeful announcement about the
future
the bad news is that people are directly
involved with the administration
have confirmed that the administration a
knows that we&#39;re not alone that the
extraterrestrials are here
but unfortunately b have
made the assessment that they are a
threat to the national security
and they are proceeding with that so
what we&#39;re trying to do
is to turn the ship estate away from
conflict
and an announcement on this issue that
would be a thousand
a million times worse than coded and
that&#39;s what i&#39;ve been working on
those of you who have sort of vanished
since august in a lot of ways
uh to try to get this problem resolved
um
before january 20th if in fact anything
is impacted upon
if it isn&#39;t acted on then then we have
to see what we can do with the
president-elect and we&#39;re working on
that as well
now the good news which is really
exciting
is that the russian federation and the
chinese
and 120 other countries have agreed to
keep
all weapons out of space and to make
peaceful contact
the issue is that they are not going to
proceed without the united states united
kingdom and a few other countries
also agreeing to do that so
it&#39;s all in the air and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re working on in the meanwhile
we the people each one of you can
form a contact team and an ambassador
to these civilizations and show the face
of humanity
that is peaceful that is enlightened
that is awake
that does not want endless war and is
willing to
understand that the foundation of
universal peace
peace on earth and peace out in space is
the fact that the
field of consciousness the spirit within
us
is a singularity and that state of
consciousness
is what all of us need to learn to
access
and utilize the cd5
contact protocols are really about
each person and then teams of people
learning
how to make contact peacefully and not
listening to all the noise the fear
that&#39;s out there
because fear pure fills the mind and it
kills the heart and it&#39;s the opposite of
love
so if we can achieve that level of
consciousness
within ourselves and within those around
us you don&#39;t have to have a cast of
thousands
you can go out with three or four people
and make contact with these
civilizations and they will
respond you&#39;re going to see this so many
of the images
i deliberately chose for this movie were
events that happened
and i was there because one of the
things that i
loathe is people thinking that this
can&#39;t happen
with someone like me there i used to
talk to ego swan who was a well-known
remote viewer with the intelligence
community
about this and you know i said look
every single person who&#39;s conscious
can be aware of that consciousness and
then there
they can go into unbounded mind and they
can see any place
know anything one thing at a time they
can create all kinds of amazing events
happening
we have a tendency to rick to sort of
delegate that to
the dalai lama or a guru or
a savant or what have you and that&#39;s not
correct they&#39;ve done studies with random
number generators wherever
they can take people off the street and
it turned out russell
dr targ says this in the movie it turns
out that people just ordinary people
would be just as accurate using
consciousness to know or see something
or affect
a mechanical quantum generator like a
random number generator as people who
were the adepts
the people who were you know celebrated
as the
the really high achievers and
consciousness
and so i tell people that we all have
this as a birthright
that each one of you have the ability
to experience the aspect of yourself
that is the universal aspect
we have our individualities but there&#39;s
an aspect of ourselves that&#39;s tied into
this unbounded light and that
is what really what we&#39;re doing when
we&#39;re going out and meditating
and making contact and the reason it
works
is that these civilizations that are
interstellar
by definition are trans-dimensional
meaning they go beyond the speed of
light
and when they go past the light barrier
they&#39;re traversing other dimensions
all of which are increasingly involved
with consciousness
thought and thought realms and thought
energy
and that&#39;s why their technologies are
interfacing directly with coherent fault
so what we&#39;re going to do
in a moment is to do a
cd5 contact meditation for just a few
minutes with everyone here
and with everyone online and it&#39;s just
going to sort of be a brief
journey before the movie starts to sort
of set the stage
and that&#39;s what we want to be able to do
oh she wants to play okay can you do
that i can&#39;t go with the ball
sure oh this is daniel she&#39;s so sweet
hey everyone i&#39;m so sorry that i
couldn&#39;t be there with you
in for a real tonight i&#39;ve been
interested in ufos for a while now
because the idea that we are alone in
the universe is extremely fascinating to
me
i met dr greer for the first time this
past summer and i&#39;ve had the opportunity
to spend some time with him and joshua
tree to experience the presence of
extraterrestrials
we spent a few days off the grid
together staring into the nice guy
watching alleged shooting stars as he
likes to call them
the planets and the milky way we also
meditated and took part in some amazing
throughout our time together i&#39;ve gained
a deeper understanding
and appreciation that we&#39;re truly not
alone as we sit and watch the film
keep an open mind and stay open to all
possibilities
oh and enjoy the experience
thank you very much she&#39;s so sweet
so what i want to do um is
have everyone take a moment to center
and a lot of people watching at home who
couldn&#39;t be here including the director
of the film
and michael mazzolo and
my wife emily who by the way is on some
heroine of all of this you know i&#39;m i&#39;m
an emergency doctor
a lot of people don&#39;t know she doesn&#39;t
she&#39;s very self-effacing
humble does not want to be in the public
i want to permit it
it&#39;s bad enough that i am in public
but believe me but she
is the person who is the rock the
foundation
of the disclosure project the cp5
initiative everything
none of it would have happened without
her
the reason she&#39;s not here is because we
uh just had our 10th grandchild
scary
and she&#39;s helping our youngest daughter
with the new baby so he&#39;s a
cute little guy declan and um so that&#39;s
a grandchild number ten
so it&#39;s a beautiful time but this is the
first one of these premieres that she
couldn&#39;t attend but
she&#39;s with us in spirit and
watching out over the baby which is the
next generation
one of the things i want to say before i
do this brief meditation
is also say that a few years ago
maybe three i can&#39;t remember i had this
amazing experience
um because i do these protocols
frequently and just sort of on the fly
and i&#39;m in that state a lot of
contacting these civilizations and
strange things happen all the time
around my house and
life and one morning we i was in the
morning i wake up and there&#39;s an e.t
in my bedroom and literally says
you need to do things to reach the
younger generation
and since then all these different
people like demi lovato who&#39;s my choke
my children&#39;s age
are coming forward so i want to say that
you know it&#39;s not about ageism
even though i&#39;ve become sort of you know
i&#39;m 65 now and i&#39;ve been doing this for
30 years since i was a young doctor
the the future the people who are
coming along after those of us who are
60s 70s 80s
we really need to reach those folks and
that&#39;s why i&#39;m so
grateful to people like demi and other
folks like that who can reach you know
tens of millions of people with this
knowledge
and get them interested and carry that
torch
forward into the future because they&#39;re
the ones who will inherit this planet
and from us because we&#39;re not all going
to be here forever right
and i&#39;m very acutely aware of that i
think well
you know i&#39;m the age my
my children are the age i was when i
started this project
and now i have ran children that are in
their teens so i look at this and i
think well
you know this is the progression as it
should be but we all have to come
together in
heart to heart mind to mind share this
knowledge
and spread the message of great hope
because as you all remember
you&#39;ll see at the end of the film
colonel corso
um who wrote the book the dance roswell
he who you know there&#39;s this wonderful
story of him having this encounter with
an e.t at white sands
back in 1956 and
he was a super action military colonel
the et was asking for their help
stopping the proliferation of these
terrible weapons systems but also
the quote radar systems that were
actually electronic warfare systems that
were knocking down
these et craft that&#39;s what roswell was
as you know
and the et you know in the ep
was asking the colonel to hell and he
said what&#39;s good for me
he said a new world if you can take it
that was 1956 64 years ago
so what i say to people is that
two-thirds of a century on
we need to accept the gift of a new
world
new energy new consciousness a peaceful
civilization on earth and in space
and the good news is we can make that
happen
if we understand the power of meditation
and consciousness and this one percent
effect
where when one percent of the people
begin to be coherent
it affects and changes the other 99 who
don&#39;t even know you&#39;re doing it
that&#39;s the power of consciousness and a
meditation and a prayer
and of the higher states of awareness
and these civilizations know that
they&#39;re waiting for us to awaken to that
and do it ourselves this is our planet
they are here to assist and observe but
they&#39;re not going to do
it for us we have to do it so this is
this entire documentary and the movement
that we&#39;re
involved with is about creating
a new world and that world is ready
to come into being but it has to be by
humans leading the way
each one of us and that&#39;s what i think
we can do
so with that i would like to start
just a few minutes and i want to tell
everyone who&#39;s online or in the theater
uh really how simple this is
you can spend an hour doing this
protocol i&#39;m going to spend five minutes
because what i&#39;m going to describe to
you is this
you you close your eyes you become aware
of the mind that is allowing you to be
conscious
and you gently focus on that using
either the breath
a mantra prayer whatever works for you
and you go into quiet mind when you&#39;re
in that quiet state of mind
you can intend to see sense
know feel remote places
in space anywhere whether it&#39;s outside
this auditorium
or out in another galaxy in that
state you can then perceive or
sense an intelligent life form from
another star system
and then you turn the process around and
show them where you are
kind of like google maps or you zoom in
and that&#39;s really all it is and you can
do it i do it within
30 seconds when i need to and you can or
you can take an hour practicing the
meditation
the idea is that once you learn this you
can
the more you do it the more proficient
you become and the more proficient you
become
you can do it kind of on the fly so
you&#39;d be driving down the road
channel one is your consciousness what
you&#39;re aware of you&#39;re looking at the
road
but in your consciousness you can also
be remote viewing as it was using
consciousness
to see it over the horizon and
to know whether what&#39;s up ahead on the
road but also to know what&#39;s up in space
or under the ground if it&#39;s an
underground extraterrestrial facility
so you can do this very easily it sounds
very mystical and very strange when you
first hear about it
but in reality every single one of you
had some experience in your life
where you have seen the future you&#39;ve
had a lucid dream of what&#39;s going to
happen
you&#39;ve had an intuition about something
that turned out to be
completely true and the reason for that
is that the nature of the conscious mind
is that it is
always everywhere it is never limited in
space
and it&#39;s never limited in time and
because of that
the consciousness whereby you&#39;re hearing
me right now
is in fact the singularity that&#39;s
omnipresent
we cut off the far
horizon but we don&#39;t have to meditation
is about going within
and connecting to that unbounded aspect
of ourselves
and it&#39;s really a beautiful experience
so i want to just take a moment
to do that where we center and
experience that state
and invite these civilizations to join
us before we start
the movie everybody understand
yeah good all right so let&#39;s close our
eyes
and everyone at home do this with us
thank you
