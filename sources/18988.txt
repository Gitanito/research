about six months after I had the
near-death experience and I began
learning meditation I was sitting up on
a mountain up in North Carolina and
right before sunset I looked over
towards the Southwest and I saw a
beautiful silver disc seamless close
encounter of the first kind it looked
exactly like the et craft I&#39;d seen when
I was 8 or 9 when I was a child in North
Carolina which actually ignited my
interest in all this so I said oh well
they&#39;re back I didn&#39;t think much more
about it so I set to meditate and I went
into this very deep meditation by time I
came out of the meditation it was very
pitch dark and there was the whole Milky
Way galaxy was above my head and I
thought was sent in to me it was very
clear it wasn&#39;t my random thought or a
hallucination at all and it said Behold
what a beautiful universe God has made
and with that I would write into the
state of consciousness that I was in in
the near-death experience except now I&#39;m
awake and standing on the mountain and
at that instant I became aware that
there was sort of a glow an energy field
right below the peak and through the
forest I thought it was a deer standing
on its hind legs and it had these
beautiful deer like eyes and I went what
is that doing here you know
and I realized it wasn&#39;t a deer and it
actually appeared and then
dematerialized came over and touched me
on the right shoulder but I could sense
its energy field was still there was
phasing in and out of 3d and the near
dimension of astral energy and with many
when it touched my right shoulder I
could actually see my ski jacket in dead
and all my hair stood on end it was like
this electromagnetic pulse and I had
long hair and it sort D at that instant
I vanished off the mountaintop onto this
ship and then we were bang almost
instantly out of space so at that point
I stayed in this meditative state and
was teaching the ETS what it was like to
be in that state of consciousness but
also be a boy a young man on earth they
were very interested in this and then we
kind of merged together in our
meditation and I created with them this
protocol for making contact with
