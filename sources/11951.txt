  		              		Experience Description   

    It happened one night while I was 12 years old. My hands were still wet after I washed them. I turned off the light by pressing the button of the table lamp. Immediately, I got electrocuted.  The electricity pulled the into my hand. My whole body started  convulsing as  I was screaming. 

  At this time, I felt my legs leaving my body. I was  floating up in mid-air and was suspended over my head. Then I saw a light that was brighter than the sunlight as it encompassed me. I could stared at it directly without hurting my eyes. Yet as comparing with my twitched body underneath, I felt extremely calm. Slowly, I walked  around in the light and then asked, 'Where is this place?' I then saw father and grandfather running to my room from the living room to rescue me after hearing me screaming.

  Meanwhile, my body hit on the wooden door causing the  lamp to disconnect from my hand and fall  to the ground.    I came back into my trembling body that couldn't stop shaking.
