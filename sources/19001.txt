hi friends the most important
documentary of all time is now available
on most digital platforms be part of the
history
if you asking yourself a question what
can I do to bring a positive change into
this world watch the movie it will guide
you in the right direction I think no
matter who you are where you come from
we all have fun within ourselves to make
a difference and so I think it&#39;s our
moment and it&#39;s time we make it right
just got off work not too long ago Danny
and Rochelle watching Close Encounters
of the fifth kind hairs are already
sticking up it was amazing it was very
emotional and kind of sad I feel
terrible for your losses dr. Greer your
service kill it&#39;s a terrible thing to
have I know your friends I know you know
your friends would want you to do what
you&#39;re doing today I already got the c5
app so that&#39;s pretty cool
I thoroughly enjoyed the film I feel
like it&#39;s something I can show my
friends and family and they won&#39;t call
it hogwash anymore I was really really
saddened that the intelligence community
is misinforming the public and I feel
like this film can really reach gay
people about what the governments of the
world are doing and we can get the 1% to
help the rest of the world with
consciousness and meditations I feel
like the world can be a better place
I love you dr. Greer just watch the c5
movie by dr. Steven Greer incredible
movies very eye-opening if you can
please go to see it
