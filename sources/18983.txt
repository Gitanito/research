Dr Stephen Greer thank you good to see
you thank you for your help I appreciate
it thank you the last time I saw you was
probably about two years ago and we had
a series of interviews where you went
deep into a lot of topics dealing with
disclosure and
ET and technology and potential Advanced
Technologies from outer space and so
forth right A lot has happened since
then right I mean you were really you&#39;ve
always been ahead of your time obviously
but some of the stuff you told me just a
couple of years ago have now come to
fruition
which is really really amazing I want to
first start by introducing some of the
people on my networks may not have seen
you before
um they are if they have it they&#39;re
crazy but now that they&#39;re finally
learning who you are for the first time
just tell them a little bit about your
background and how you got started in
disclosure
well you know I&#39;m an emergency doctor
and worked in emergency medicine and and
trauma but uh you know I had had an
experience with one of these objects
when I was younger I always had a
lifelong interest uh my first sighting I
was a eight maybe in North Carolina back
in before you were born in 1963 but
um it was a quite remarkable daytime
close up clearly an extraterrestrial
vehicle uh seamless and so I had an
interest my entire life and uh
eventually in in 1990 I started the ce5
contact initiative which you there&#39;s an
app called ce5 contact you can get that
is an outreach program from humans to
these civilizations to create a peaceful
dialogue and liaison between humans and
these civilizations because frankly uh
in studying this up to that point I
realized that the United States and
other governments had dropped the ball
they had military
 I kept it secret and nobody was
paying attention to the fact that the
UFOs themselves are just like that car
you that brought you here who&#39;s inside
the car you know Billy is or who&#39;s so
who&#39;s inside the spacecraft why are they
here uh and so that was the Genesis of
it now in 1992 on a beach in Florida
near Pensacola we had a major
um event ce5 contact event there were
four ET crafts in the sky that were seen
by about 60 people on a training
Expedition we were doing well including
a couple of Air Force Colonels and
pilots and that made it onto the front
page of the Pensacola paper of the photo
that then led to uh people in the
intelligence Community contacting me uh
some friendly people and some hostile
people yeah uh but that sort of opened
that whole vein uh to it and then a year
later when President Clinton became
sworn in three uh I was asked by the
director of a think tank here near the
Pentagon to set up a briefing attend a
briefing for the director of the CIA
then at that time our James Woolsey for
the president undercover of a dinner
party with me and my wife and the host
and his wife and the CI director and his
wife uh and it was at that time
I learned uh this is my life turned
upside down 30 years ago because I
realized that the president and the
director of the CIA and then others I
subsequently met with were being blocked
from information on this subject and
that the organization running these
covert programs were doing so without
oversight uh from the Congress or the
president and we&#39;re therefore illegal
and unconstitutional so that really was
the Genesis of the disclosure project in
those days we called it project
Starlight if you look at the Clinton
Library was sued by AP and they
Associated Press and they released these
documents and so it was initially a
private briefing process that I did in
my spare time as an emergency doctor
meeting with various members of Congress
people at the Pentagon elsewhere to get
this information to them and to
encourage disclosure of it by the US
government so that so the Genesis of
this goes all the way back to the early
1990s 30 years ago yeah that&#39;s
incredible and I know when I talked to
you on the phone just maybe a few weeks
ago building up to this live uh you know
interview right you had mentioned that
you had to start taking some of these
government officials and some of these
Witnesses through the skiff can you talk
about that are you able to talk about
that on the live here
I can I have to be careful yeah
um so about 16 months ago
a very senior person in the intelligence
Community here
um who works literally with the black
budget and oversees the three-letter
agencies CIA NSA nro
reached out to me because a law
previously had been passed as you know
by the Congress to get a report done on
UFOs and uaps whatever the name of the
day is right and to to basically find
out what was going on with this so once
the Pentagon confirmed the Tic Tac
footage and this UFO footage very
quickly there were people in the
Congress like Senator gillibrand and
others who put through a wall requiring
the Director of National Intelligence as
well as the Pentagon to report on this
uh so those folks had been going
are we blunt they had been gas lit the
people doing the investigations who were
of course not members of Congress these
are senior people in the in the
intelligence community and staff and
they were basically being given new
information which is predictable this is
what we ran into in the 90s
so they contacted me and asked me to
help
provide what&#39;s called actionable
intelligence details of where these
facilities are where these projects are
centered uh Who&#39;s involved what are the
project code names and numbers which I
have and a number of these sort of
issues
so you know we&#39;re a non-governmental
entity I have no legal standing to be
frank but you know we have collected all
this over 30 years as an enormous uh
Archive of intelligence information it&#39;s
the largest in the world by far
and so we&#39;ve had meetings where I would
provide this and then they subsequently
had field people out the field goal and
confirm it so they were able to confirm
what we were saying that there were both
extraterrestrial and man-made UFOs the
bigger secret are the man-made secret
technologies that would get us off the
environment
crisis and and fix the environment and
poverty uh but that they were still
being blocked to access into these
facilities now these were people with
top secret special compartmented
information clearances at the highest
level and you know again I said yes
because the organization doing this
let&#39;s not respect the authority of the
legal constitutional government of the
United States this is not a conspiracy
theory it&#39;s a fact and it&#39;s dangerous so
once you know this is now I realized
that in 93 now they&#39;re senior members in
the US government in the Congress and
White House realizing this is the case
and so so the big question becomes what
are you going to do about it so I said
here&#39;s what I think you should do
and they sent field people out and they
were able to confirm what we had been
saying through the information so we
were giving them the for example we&#39;re
going to release and you&#39;re going to all
see this yeah this weekend at our
two-day conference but also at the
national Press Club on June 12th from 2
to 4 P.M the world can see that for free
right
um
the facilities list and so I I provided
this to these investigators in the
government and their 145 top secret
facilities uh or bases where these
operations have gone as well as
corporate locations so which
corporations are involved where is the
reverse engineering taking place Etc so
all of that was started 16 months ago
now what has helped more recently
is that the Congress and the president
put through a bill two days before
Christmas in 2022 uh the national uh
defense authorization act had a
provision for top secret people
whistleblowers or people who had
non-disclosure agreements in the
military or even corporate world to go
through a process where they would go to
this office aaro arrow and the skiff uh
there near the Pentagon and provide
their information so that process was
the law was passed late December 2022
the first folks started going in in
January and so I&#39;ve been helping
coordinate that and also very clearly
encouraging whistleblowers to come
forward now we have to make a
distinction here yeah there are really
three
categories in these whistleblowers right
people who will not come forward because
they&#39;re hostile to to having this come
out because they&#39;re part of the I hate
to say the illegal project gotcha then
they&#39;re the ones who are cooperating
giving us information
but they don&#39;t want to come forward yet
because the laws need to be tightened up
for their personal protection and
security so as many have gotten death
threats right they&#39;re uh security around
their pensions or their financial assets
and uh also where it&#39;s very clear that
if if they were found to have done
something illegal that they would
there&#39;d be a period of amnesty so we&#39;re
recommending a further Bill be passed to
provide these sort of protections for
these whistleblowers and then there&#39;s
another category and those are the
people who are willing to go through the
process now and go to the skiff and
provide information right now out of a
few of those there are a handful that
are willing to come out publicly gotcha
okay at this press conference right so
you&#39;re dealing a distillation so it&#39;s
you now they&#39;ll give you a number yeah
we now have
752 whistleblowers and Witnesses
uh that we have either previously
interviewed or identified or have
contacts to right and some are
preeminent right for example there&#39;s a
senior official and a Fortune 100
company that would like to share what he
knows but recently after reaching out he
has had explicit threats death threats
to him himself and his family so this is
why we&#39;re encouraging the Congress and
the president to step up the pace of the
protective laws gotcha for these
people&#39;s security and safety right
that&#39;s phenomenal and just for the
viewers to skip when we say the skip can
you break it down for them because we
know what it is but yeah well skiff is a
secure compartmented information
facility so they&#39;re all around the city
in other parts of the United States and
they&#39;re basically places where when you
go in you know you put your phones and
electronics aside it&#39;s a sealed facility
so no electromagnetic signals can go in
or out right
um and it&#39;s a place where top secret
information can be exchanged and shared
in a secure fashion exactly that&#39;s
basically yeah
right this is really top secret this is
where you can really share information
and knowing that nobody can hack into it
nobody can record it they can&#39;t use
those sophisticated uh cameras with
those sophisticated mics outside the
building to hear what&#39;s inside
everything bounces off it&#39;s uh it&#39;s
pretty secure um which is which is very
good it&#39;s not secure from these this
illegal group because they&#39;re using
they have some really high tech they
have what are called scalar or
longitudinal electromagnetic systems
that can penetrate anywhere right and
this is one of the the problems we&#39;ve
had is getting the people in the
conventional government it&#39;s called the
legal government to understand the these
other operations have Technologies
many of them reverse engineered from
extraterrestrial Vehicles we&#39;ll get into
this that are thousands of years past
what right the president or the chairman
of XYZ committee and the Congress would
know about and this is a this is what I
call the technology Gap it&#39;s a
disconnect right
um and it&#39;s dangerous because uh if you
don&#39;t know what your adversary has the
capability to do then you&#39;re not going
to strategically make the right
decisions right so what I&#39;ve been trying
to get them to understand is that their
current secops the Security operation
protocols and these secops are simply
inadequate and therefore they they need
to understand that whatever it is
they&#39;re doing is going to be
transparently known and seen uh by uh
the folks who they consider not
Cooperative let&#39;s call it that way and
not Cooperative to the point of of I
would use the word and and these folks
of agreement with me when I&#39;ve used it
are involved in a increase in this
operation yeah absolutely and I agree
I&#39;ve heard you say that before as a
matter of fact and so you&#39;ll be talking
about this scalar technology this
weekend at the conference right yes we
have a PhD physicist um from uh had been
I believe it Los Alamos and uh he is a
probably World expert on a scalar of
course Nikola Tesla talked about scalar
ways yes back 100 years ago but
he&#39;ll be making a brief presentation and
then one of our Witnesses
um
who was with Raytheon at a covert
facility at South Pole he&#39;s going to
talk about the sort of a application of
that it&#39;s called a neutrino light
sensors an array that&#39;s a couple miles
underneath the ice yeah the South Pole
where he worked at that station and what
that capability uh the capability of
that array is right it&#39;s both I will
tell you it&#39;s both tracking and sensing
and an active weapon system which is
quite Advanced electromagnetic weapon
and rather dangerous yeah wow that&#39;s
powerful neutrinos neutrino light
neutrino light Hector and array wow now
by the way back in the 19 mid to early
1990s I met a man who is CEO of Electro
electronics company
who in the 70s had invented a neutrino
light detector that got a national
security order placed on it and the
national reconnaissance office seized it
wow under National Security order and
they put them on the satellites that are
up there so that they can track and
monitor these extraterrestrial Vehicles
as they come out of what&#39;s called a
trans-dimensional space-time right into
3D
when they do that there&#39;s a burst of
neutrino light and that allows them to
pick up on them yeah and so those are
then uh connected to weapon systems and
you you hear about all these crash
retrievals yeah well now in our archive
we have 121
incidences that we&#39;ve documented many
with whistleblower still living of these
objects being tracked hit and downed
right or extraterrestrial so which is
another whole discussion and that is uh
the danger yeah of having an
unsupervised and unauthorized operation
with those kind of technologies that are
really creating an existential threat to
all life on Earth I will say it very
bluntly it&#39;s a very dangerous
nonsensical thing happening right I&#39;ve
known about this since the early 90s
it&#39;s one of the chief reasons uh back in
uh
oh gosh when when the uh head of the
defense intelligence agency whom I
briefed General Patrick Hughes he&#39;s a
three-star and he had been denied access
to this information now this is the head
of for those who don&#39;t know the defense
intelligence agency would be like the
CIA for civilian right for the entire
military and this guy&#39;s the top guy yeah
and I would did a briefing in his
conference room at the Pentagon and he
flat out told me he was denied access
and uh he thought that there
actions being taken that were dangerous
I said oh you better believe it and I
discussed this with him the fact that we
were interacting and targeting these
objects yeah
um who are frankly completely not
hostile but I will tell you the fact
that they&#39;re not hostile towards humans
and and uh Earth does not mean that they
are happy with what this clandestine
group is doing right because we&#39;re
actually people want to know where the
threat is go look in the mirror yeah
humans have become an existential threat
to ourselves
uh with what we&#39;re doing to this planet
environmentally and otherwise but also
now potentially to other planets yeah so
I think that this is a very complex
problem and one of the one of the big
problems with the news media everything
has to be boiled down into a a 30 to 90
second sound bite and the issue is so
complex uh and by the way it&#39;s another
problem with with members of the
Congress and White House yeah is that
they&#39;re so busy and yet the issue has to
get unpacked one of the things we&#39;re
trying to do we haven&#39;t done it yet is
that we&#39;re going to unveil what we&#39;re
calling the disclosure project
intelligence archive which is many
terabytes of data wow but what needs to
happen anybody out there we need someone
who&#39;s a very good uh data file manager
who can then organize these hard drives
and information and that we can then
what we eventually would like to do is
have a website that would be the
Clearinghouse for all legitimate
information on the subject yeah
um but we&#39;re not there yet of course I
can&#39;t even imagine what that might cost
and then we&#39;d have to raise the funds
but there are a lot of technical
obstacles to doing it just because it&#39;s
a massive we may eventually have some
we&#39;re in the neighborhood of 10 to 20
terabytes wow that&#39;s a lot of difference
which is a huge amount for a website and
also a searchable website where it&#39;s all
indexed and searchable right so this is
a technical problem I&#39;m a doctor
but we need some really good tech people
to help us with that you know I may have
some people on my team that can help
with that uh with the project that I&#39;ve
done with searching for space anomalies
we&#39;ve downloaded over one million images
from the NASA and European Space Agency
Caltech servers and catalog them and
categorize about 50 to 60 000 anomalies
that are searchable linkable
downloadable and everything else that we
did over the course of seven years right
but we do have the capability of doing
something like that yeah we want to
stand this up in the next year yeah um
and we&#39;re still collecting data I will
tell you there&#39;s on average two to four
new top secret whistleblowers coming
into our system every month wow we&#39;re
adding a similar number of top secret
facilities let me give people an idea
for this not vague yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s
a man who um is going to be speaking uh
here he was an army guy at Fort Bragg he
was taken into an underground facility
where there was a kind of a Sonic
electromagnetic anti-gravity operation
with this massive uh
you know thousands and thousands of
pounds heavy uh with like a granite uh
cubic rectangular object floating wow
um and he knew the name of the area
where it is so see every time one of
these whistleblowers comes forward
who&#39;ve actually been in the system
whether it was an accidental event in
his case or worked in it we grabbed that
information and put it on our facilities
list gotcha so when you see this
facilities list that we&#39;re going to be
releasing keep in mind that every dot on
that map and everyone in the list is
backed up from witness testimony and uh
files right of course those we can&#39;t
release without the whistleblowers
permission gotcha so what one of the one
of the things that&#39;s a problem for me
personally is that having debriefed
all these hundreds of top secret
Witnesses but when they&#39;re not willing
to come forward publicly like has
recently happened
with one of them yeah what what happens
is that we&#39;re
the best I can do is provide the
information but what we really need is a
process an open hearing and this I&#39;ve
had a conversation with a member of
Congress in the house is to have an oh
and this is new news uh to have an open
hearing process not in a skiff
where these witnesses can be subpoenaed
and be sworn in under oath and come
forward yeah uh and the whole public
will know about it because I think the
top secret process
is dangerous in the sense that if it&#39;s
top secret going through a pentagon
office like Arrow how much of that will
ever get out to the American public how
much of it will actually get to the
members of Congress because I know that
there&#39;s a letter we have from the chair
and co-chair of the Senate intelligence
committee recently written in April
where they were very unhappy with the
progress and the reporting back out of
Arrow to them I have this letter yeah
and uh we can show it to you my
assistant can get it to you and I think
this is a big problem because it gets
back into is the fox Guardian the hen
house right sort of problem right and
some of the men that we have taken and I
know have gone into the skiff before
Arrow have been extremely unhappy in a
how they were treated and being the
tendency to cut them off and not let
them tell the whole information so one
of our concerns here and I have an
inside track on that very
much in the system yeah is that there&#39;s
a big concern that the leadership of
that office it whether or not they&#39;re
complying with the law uh to let these
people bring all their evidence and
testimony but also then properly report
it up the chain of command uh to the
Congress which is the entity that is
funded and authorized the investigation
so this is something again in a
Democratic Republic like the United
States or any democracy
there has to be proper oversight of
these sort of operations uh and I think
we have to be very very Vigilant that
this doesn&#39;t end up being like prior
government investigations which were
basically dog and pony shows that
further the cover-up right and I&#39;m I&#39;m
actually quite concerned about that uh
from the things I am hearing not from
the rumor mill yeah but or the you know
UFO chat rooms but from these top secret
guys going in what they tell me
afterwards so we are concerned about
that and I think we have to be vigilant
yeah
what government
agencies could have the power to cover
up these UFO and UAP crash retrievals
and so forth without any oversight from
the front government
all of them so let me explain how a
little bit of History here yeah uh when
you start dealing with
top secret operations they&#39;re very
highly compartmentalized and there&#39;s
there&#39;s special access projects and as
you know from our documentary on
acknowledged there are ones that are
unacknowledged special access projects
yeah now within those and those mean
that if you&#39;re not in the project you&#39;re
not to tell anyone outside of it those
have been not just on the UFO issue on a
number of issues yeah
Iran Contra for example
um but now there&#39;s a branch of those
that went rogue
and the Rogue ones
um don&#39;t have any legal oversight so a
lot of people confuse like the black
budget of the United States uh which is
very very secret that the legal black
budget is legal is known by the
president his guys and the chief
oversight committees and members of the
Senate and House yeah I&#39;m talking about
ones that have gone so Rogue and black
that they&#39;re not overseen but they&#39;re
it&#39;s they&#39;re enfolded it&#39;s like those
Russian folding dogs you know where you
stack the dogs yeah what they&#39;re called
yeah exactly and and but they&#39;re they&#39;re
hidden within other saps others other
special access projects and of course we
uncovered this back in the 90s and so
that structure let&#39;s say the
architecture of the secrecy
unfortunately allows for those
operations to go completely unsupervised
even by senior members of the Pentagon
for example General Patrick Hughes or
you all know the memo leaked out from Dr
Davis about my briefing the head of
intelligence for The Joint Chiefs of
Staff Admiral Wilson
that that happened because even though
he had this very high position
which you know he was the J2 he was in
charge of intelligence for The Joint
Chiefs of Staff right and when we gave
him some information about this he made
some inquiries he was not only denied
access
he was threatened
and now you know people go how is that
possible yeah now a lot of people back
in the day when I first said this
happened so this cannot be true later
this memo leaked out from Eric Davis I
went oh God it was true look you know
some of the things I say people go wow
that&#39;s really out there but it&#39;s all
based on fact yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s all
true and people will come to find that
what we&#39;ve been saying in the 90s and
2000s
um and now in the 2020s it&#39;s when it all
comes out at every bit of it will be
true yeah uh as outrageous and I will
admit it is outrageous
um but
if we don&#39;t get a handle on this
we&#39;re really facing a catastrophe yeah
and I mean we really are as a people as
a civilization not only because the
technologies that would get us off of
fossil fuels and say the biosphere are
being withheld but that there&#39;s this
Rogue element that has weaponized these
Technologies uh and without supervision
and knowledge I can assure you that the
people I know in the Congress and the
White House have no knowledge of that
operation and Pentagon the general
Hughes had no knowledge of that
incredible Admiral Wilson had no
knowledge of it so when you have that
happening that that group really is a
threat to World security and National
Security right so one of the things that
I always want I want to remind people
there&#39;s this wonderful quote from one of
the very first directors of the CIA who
in 1947 was CI director uh and of course
that was the year Roswell happened
Roswell happened in 1961 after
Eisenhower made his speech of to where
the military industrial complex and it
was a veiled reference to this problem
uh this man Admiral Roscoe hillenkeater
wrote to the New York Times and he said
quote I&#39;m paraphrasing actually he said
the secrecy around UFOs is a threat to
the National Security not the UFOs so
when I go into these meetings I said I
know what you&#39;re hearing from the echo
chamber of the ufology is that we&#39;re
under some kind of alien invasion in
reality the secrecy around the subject
is a threat to the man National Security
because this group that has run it&#39;s
like a Frankenstein we created in the
40s and 50s that&#39;s gotten off the table
and then is walking amongst us it&#39;s it&#39;s
a monstrous operation right and some of
the guys that I know who recently have
been out in the field trying to
penetrate these programs have texted me
on encrypted systems and said wow these
people are thugs using the word Thugs
and so absolutely they are
um so that&#39;s what you know we&#39;ve been
dealing with now for 30 years uh it&#39;s
good to see there&#39;s some people coming
forward we&#39;re talking about it yeah uh
but uh unfortunately what has to happen
and this is why we&#39;re doing this
National Press Club event here is to
frame the issue uh up to date of what&#39;s
Happening Now that these developments
have occurred in the Congress and call
for these open hearings right and uh we
I think we&#39;re going to have a member of
the uh House of Representatives there
with us on Monday who will also make a
call for that if his schedule if his
flight gets in on time easy wanting to
come and he&#39;s on a key oversight
Committee in the House of
Representatives so what what I&#39;m hoping
is that uh what we&#39;re doing here as a
private entity again I have no official
standing and I don&#39;t want one yeah uh I
bet I would not accept the clearance and
I don&#39;t need a clearance
that&#39;s just going to hold you back oh
yeah I mean you&#39;re in shackles then
aren&#39;t you yeah um it was offered to me
you know I told you the story when the
head of Army intelligence in in 1992
first threatened me and then offered me
two billion dollars to be part of the
board right dealing with this the
so-called you know uh majority joint
intelligence committee magic yeah uh and
I said no thank you but uh and that was
when that was a lot of money two billion
dollars I mean it&#39;d be a lot now but in
1995 that&#39;s a lot of money back then and
it was all black money yeah legally
gotten right I mean are you in believe
the mechanism for the funding which
we&#39;re also going to expose this weekend
nice yeah probably illegal arms or drugs
you name it the whole drug running yeah
criminal operations yeah yep oh
absolutely yeah I tell people this is
why uh there&#39;s an attorney Derek Garcia
who um is coming has come forward I&#39;ve
sort of been mentoring him since he was
a 20
21 maybe when he was at Westland he&#39;s
now an attorney public interest attorney
in Albuquerque wow and he has graciously
uh on his own time uh organized Now 50
lawyers to represent our whistleblowers
to defend them but also to launch this
is a very big news
a civilian Rico lawsuit Rico is the
racketeer influence corrupt organization
act from 1970. it&#39;s usually used against
organized crime by uh federal and state
and law enforcement but there&#39;s a
provision for a civilian private
organization to invoke it nice and
that&#39;s what we&#39;re planning to do which
means we&#39;re going to be issuing
subpoenas if we can get it into the
certified federal system against these
corporations and individuals
who have been involved in this you know
and who have committed various crimes
right all right and so we&#39;re announcing
that this week and also and uh Mr Garcia
will be at the event explaining what
that is wow some of the attorneys who
have surfaced to be doing this and it&#39;s
all pro bono they&#39;re not charging we
don&#39;t have the money to pay 50 attorneys
yeah
um you&#39;d be 50 million dollars but
they&#39;re all wonderful people who are
devoted to disclosure right and are
putting their efforts in and some of
them are preeminent I&#39;m we&#39;re still
waiting to see which of them want to be
publicly identified this weekend yeah
but some of them are absolutely
preeminent uh attorneys in the United
States and that&#39;s amazing and this
conference is going to be a three-day
event basically well the Press Club is
going to be Sunday or Monday the Press
Club National Press Club is Monday from
two until four at the national Press
Club right there uh near where the JW
Marriott is okay and that&#39;s where the
media of course gathers for big press
events it&#39;s where the 2001 event took
place yeah uh you know with the first
national Press Club event that kicked
off the global disclosure movement yeah
but this is sort of an update
um and with new Witnesses of many of
them of dealing with the human uh what
have been called alien reproduction
vehicles uh we have a Raytheon guy from
the South Pole we have a guy who uh two
Raytheon people showed him hovering at
Fort Irwin California yeah uh these
triangular objects that were
anti-gravity uh and he&#39;s going to be
there well uh and we have uh Marine who
was uh his platoon responded in a
humanitarian mission
uh in Indonesia after the earthquake and
tsunami in 2009 yeah and they were
deployed to an area and dropped in by a
helicopter and came across a 300 foot
diameter and I said that&#39;s the biggest
round of the football field yeah
man-made UFO and it was all these uh
Black Ops guys offloading what appeared
to be illegal drugs and weapons wow uh
and some trafficking scheme and they
were threatened with being executed now
we have the names of all six of the
platoon members uh one of them wrote and
said he you know it&#39;s in fear of his
life yeah I will tell you all six of
them were told if you speak of this you
will be executed now this man who&#39;s
coming forward Michael Herrera is
incredibly Brave he was only 19 or 20
when this happened he&#39;s about 33 now
um he&#39;s he&#39;s a very brave person uh very
few people have been willing to step
forward on that yeah because it exposes
two major things the existence of a
secret Air Force capability using these
crafts from Northrop Grumman and
Lockheed and Raytheon and others but
also this Rogue most dangerous part of
the Rogue operation that is globally
breaking all kinds of laws and engaged
in uh violent crimes and Drug running
and clearly criminal activities
you know this disclosure movement is
really so important because
like you just talked about the amount of
crimes that are involved for them to
create these black budget projects and
these secret projects these
unacknowledged projects in order to keep
it running and funded they have to do so
much dark stuff to keep it going which
is a complete threat to humanity in the
planet
well not to mention the Constitution and
the rule of law right I mean if you
don&#39;t have the rule of law what are we
living in the jungle again right aren&#39;t
we yeah so I mean this becomes sort of a
civilizational crisis in my opinion it
way exceeds the risk of China Russia
Ukraine Iran but it isn&#39;t on the radar
fully yet by the members of Congress or
other capitals and leaders or the United
Nations or the White House this is
there&#39;s this uh very uh the reason I&#39;ve
always been in a hurry to do this
is that I know that if this stays on the
course it&#39;s on where it&#39;s going to end
up and it&#39;s not going to be nice it&#39;s
going to be a catastrophe exactly
you know when you&#39;re looking at this you
know all these black budget projects and
what they&#39;re holding back
technologically from the world
what other types of Technologies or what
types of benefits of the technology
could be released to mankind that you
feel are being held back
well you know we just released a few
days ago a documentary film called The
Lost century and how to reclaim it the
key thing how to reclaim that and the
lost century is an expose of a hundred
years is what I call it the Lost Century
of since the time of Tesla yeah a very
Advanced Technologies that have been
seized and sequestered inventors have
been assassinated and the patent laws
have been abused to seize them under
national security provisions I have a
copy of one that we show in the film so
everyone can right now go and see that
film it&#39;s on all platforms iTunes Apple
yeah Google Amazon whatever right now
the reason that&#39;s so important it
outlines
what we&#39;ve lost in 100 years but also
importantly I&#39;m one of these people I
don&#39;t like to just convection about a
problem right I think we need to so
what&#39;s the solution exactly all right so
that was the disclosure project is the
solution to these illegal secrecy uh in
this film we talk about what the
solution should be the pathway to
develop or acquire if anyone listening
has one of these zero point or Quantum
energy devices contact us immediately
yeah we have people with funding in
place to get it out now if we can prove
it yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s ready I mean it&#39;s
substantial funding so
but it has to be released open source
yes that&#39;s the only way open source is
the only way it&#39;s the only way because
if you go through patent or intellectual
property Secrets it&#39;s going to get
seized now most of these inventors uh
here&#39;s the problem they&#39;re very very
bright with physics or electromagnetic
engineering but they don&#39;t understand
the Strategic landscape and the security
landscape uh and what I want to do is
combine what our expertise on the
Strategic and security landscape uh so
we can get out safely yeah with the
people who have the the genius and
Engineering uh and and physics to create
preferably a solid-state version yeah
which of course Floyd&#39;s tweet had if you
look up in our movie you&#39;ll see this
whole expose about Floyd tweet&#39;s device
which was real
but I think that uh when you look at
that what are the implications of that
all that being disclosed yeah just that
it would end poverty on the planet in 20
years but I&#39;m not talking
poverty in the United States is not
poverty that&#39;s not real poverty uh in
Africa and South America and parts of
Asia and South America so you know right
now there are three billion people on
the Earth that have no means to even
cook their food they&#39;re cutting down the
forest and then the desert shrubs to
make charcoal yeah so it&#39;s a huge
problem and so I think one of the big
questions is
if we can bring these Technologies out
given the internet and other and it&#39;s
open source yeah then thousands of
companies will spring up just like the
internet was open source thousands of
tech companies sprung up and created
hundreds of trillions of dollars in
Industries exactly everything from
Amazon to alphabet to whatever so when
this happens it&#39;ll be a tie that lifts
the whole world up now it will also end
off pollution yeah on Earth I mean
literally all pollution air water ground
yeah because these Technologies because
they&#39;re quote free energy and there&#39;s a
chairman of a major corporation America
who wants to come forward who has said
Point Blank yes we have those free
energy devices wow to us now you know
he&#39;s afraid to come forward who knows
these corporate Thugs and we&#39;re
dangerous than the assassins out of the
CIA trust me so I think that this is
this is something that if the People
Unite around us that effort we should be
able to create a civilization within 10
to 20 years yeah where there would be no
poverty no pollution sustainability uh
but wouldn&#39;t be just you know windmills
and solar panels right ain&#39;t going to
get us there no it&#39;s too the energy
density and it&#39;s so expensive this would
be something quite inexpensive would fit
on your table run your house run your
factory run your car yeah and uh would
have zero energy costs and no pollution
because it&#39;s pulling energy out of the
fabric right of space-time What&#39;s called
the quantum vacuum or Zero Point Energy
uh which was proven by the way in the
50s right Professor Casimir right so
this documentary I would encourage
everyone to look at it as soon as
possible it&#39;s called The Lost century
and how to reclaim it we actually have
Motion Graphics to show what the world
looks like in 20 years 50 years 100
years a thousand years it was beautiful
yeah have you seen it yeah yeah so I&#39;ve
seen it you gave me the link uh about
two weeks ago yeah and I watched it
make sure you go watch the Lost Century
you can watch it on Apple you can watch
it pretty much on anything the Lost
Century Dr Stephen Greer it&#39;s an amazing
documentary the way that you did the
graphics in there to show those
projections because it gives you it
gives a person like the ability to kind
of see the future what it could be what
what are we missing here and and that&#39;s
what we could have had by you know the
irony of all of this
um by the time I was born in 1955 I
turned 68 later this month uh all of
those Technologies were in existence
yeah uh the zero point free energy the
electrogravidic anti-gravity that was
mastered in October 1954 wow how do I
know this the top scientists at the
world&#39;s largest Department defense lab
here the Naval Research Labs which
Thomas Edison started
when he was in one of the vaults he saw
the documentation that stated we
mastered gravity control anti-gravity
October
1954. so I was born in June 1955. so by
the time I was born we should not have
had jet engines now Rockets cars with
internal combustion engines coal gas oil
nuclear wind solar geothermal all of it
yeah now
the good news is it&#39;s it&#39;s like the ET
said to Colonel Corso when he said
what&#39;s in this for me he&#39;s and the ET
said a new world if you can take it yeah
but
who&#39;s going to be the losers here well
uh you do have
hundreds of trillions of dollars in
Assets in Petro dollar and oil and gas
Public Utilities so one of the problems
with this is when people talk about a
disruptive technology like you know a
Ride app like Uber or Lyft I mean that&#39;s
I mean it replaced taxis right but this
would totally transform the planet but
there will be people who will be
disrupted yeah okay and I think now the
the not the big corporations that have
already made thousands of trillions of
dollars over 150 years but the average
worker let&#39;s say you&#39;re you&#39;re an oil
rig worker or a public utility worker
there needs to be a plan that as these
Technologies come out yeah we provide
the training and support to transition
them from those smokestack Industries to
this new high-tech energy sector yeah
because there will be huge jobs
resulting from that but we have to think
this through uh and it needs to be
compassionate to the rank and file
people who would be adversely affected
absolutely yeah I mean that&#39;s something
I&#39;ve said for 25 30 years but that can
be done you know we can absolutely do
that as a as a people right not here but
just globally globally globally we can
come together as a people and do this uh
but ultimately it will grow the economy
and the worlds of poverty I I predict in
about 20 years would be gone gone
completely gone Africa everywhere right
so this is very good do I always tell
people
this is extremely
this is why I&#39;m such an optimist I know
these exist and I know what the world
will look like when it can be disclosed
yeah and it really you know I have now
12 grandchildren four daughters because
there would be a whole new world uh if
this could happen uh and it would be a
wonderful world yeah uh if they&#39;re used
for peace exactly now I will say caveat
in my conversations with people in the
military connected to these projects
I agree that the propulsion systems
should remain classified now what do I
mean there if you have an object like
that Tic Tac yeah that&#39;s lockheed&#39;s comp
works by the way yeah I agree with that
extraterrestrial yeah
um news flash you know who made it where
it came from yeah it&#39;s not alien no no
and we have a top secret Witness
who who actually 1991 saw that thing
being offloaded from a C-130 transport
vehicle in the Azores oh man oh yeah
you&#39;re gonna see the drawing of this he
doesn&#39;t want to come forward yet he&#39;s
scared okay but he absolutely saw it and
we have another account of that
identical object uh from multiple
Witnesses from 1967 in Pennsylvania wow
so that&#39;s an old one yeah all right yeah
so uh now I know that when I&#39;ve spoken
to people like David fraver uh who is
the F-18 Hornet pilot he insists there&#39;s
no way we had anything that could move
like that but of course he was a Jet
Pilot yeah and he wasn&#39;t read into these
compartmented operations so uh you know
I always let people have their opinion
but you know to be honest with you if
you haven&#39;t been briefed up to that
level and if chairman of the Senate
intelligence and armed services and
White House presidents in generals
haven&#39;t been told I&#39;m quite sure pilot
in the Navy would not have been read in
um so I think this is for the disconnect
because it seems so unbelievable to
people who are your conventional uh
pilots and Military folks uh but the
truth is is that that&#39;s the nature of
top secret special compartmented right
information is highly compartmented uh
but I think that that is why the
significance of disclosure is is not
just
to correct these legal and other
problems it&#39;s really to transform the
way humans live on the planet in
preparation for humans yeah becoming
Interstellar gotcha so I mean there&#39;s a
long-term trajectory that if we don&#39;t
muck up the whole situation yeah right
and create an extinction level event
from our stupidity yeah
um we we have this amazing boundless
future that&#39;s so beautiful waiting for
us it can be incredible oh it is it will
be I&#39;ve seen it I&#39;m optimistic as well I
don&#39;t believe in the Doom and Gloom it&#39;s
coming to an end and it&#39;s the end times
I really don&#39;t believe in that it is the
best time to be alive and I think the
world on the precipice and people like
you are really pushing the Forefront and
getting us to the level where we can
break through and Usher ourselves back
to a golden age and I think we will
definitely do it because we&#39;ve done it
before Global Golden Age yes if you like
the Shambhala Kingdom the method yeah I
think it might have existed that was in
that small area of the planet for the
whole planet yeah because once we reach
the point where there&#39;s no poverty and
there&#39;s super abundance yeah people can
then turn their attention towards
creative Pursuits the development of
higher States Of Consciousness
meditative States
um travel through space peacefully yeah
that the trick here however with humans
is that in these covert programs the
tragedy is these wonderful technologies
that could be used for good have been
turned to war yeah and if you look at
the course of human history in the
modern technological era
almost every breakthrough
Atomic yeah had its first application in
a weapon system yep and so the the
problem that&#39;s got to get fixed and this
gets to be a very important social even
spiritual uh civilizational discussion
is that is all this is poised it is
coming out this is all coming out
um
we know this is coming out I&#39;m going to
say something a little bit this is okay
dangerous but I&#39;ll be discreet in how I
describe it
but this is all going to come out one
way or another
the question is we neither begin having
a conversation with global leaders
that&#39;s why I&#39;m reaching out to people in
the UK and other countries
about
what does this look like I&#39;m going after
all this is is then known
is it another arms race yeah do we take
these Technologies and weaponize them do
we weaponize them against
extraterrestrial peoples which has
already happened we have to be very
careful because once you cross the
nuclear threshold and pass the nuclear
into these Technologies
they are potentially significantly more
uh lethal than a hydrogen bomb yeah and
so we have to begin to ask the question
what are we going to be when we grow up
yeah as a species you know we&#39;re sort of
in an adolescent rambunctious phase
right and unruly uh humans yeah but if
we reach this point of maturity and
what&#39;s been called a level one
civilization michikaku and others yeah
um where we&#39;re peaceful globally we&#39;re
fixing the environment then there&#39;s
hundreds of thousands of years
potentially of unbroken Evolution and
exploration yeah but if we don&#39;t get
this right I will tell you it is the end
we&#39;re going to hit an extinction level
event so when I say that the stakes
involved with this cannot be overstated
in their importance I I mean it
absolutely it cannot be overstated
you&#39;re right there are theoretical
physicists and astrophysicists that have
claimed that based on just sheer numbers
and civilizations that are out there in
our own Milky Way that reached a high
level and have actually destroyed
themselves there could be literally
thousands or maybe even millions of
destroyed planets out there where the
people destroyed themselves and they&#39;re
just sitting there bearing wastelands
well some people think that happened on
Mars very very long millions of years
ago
um there&#39;s some evidence for that so
yeah you know there are lessons here
um you know we need to learn from
history or we&#39;re going to repeat it yeah
um but I think the Extraterrestrial
civilization is currently involved with
surveilling and looking at the Earth a
lot of people ask why are they always
around our Atomic nuclear facilities
Roswell let&#39;s not forget because the
509th bomber Squadron only place in the
world only place in the world where
there was an atomic bomb in 1947. what
were the ET so concerned about because
they could they have seen this happen
where we get on that path we stay on
that path yeah and that Civilization is
extinct but they also know
that once you get on that path
it&#39;s not far to go to the next level
where you then have Interstellar these
so-called
trans-dimensional technologies that
allow for space travel right because
space travel has to be many many times
the speed of light uh we understand how
that happens if you want to visualize a
piece of paper here&#39;s a point here of a
thousand light years is another Point
you&#39;re not going this way you&#39;re folding
the piece of paper so it&#39;s time and
folding it yeah that&#39;s how you do it
yeah we know how this happens it&#39;s
called entanglement quantum entanglement
but on a macro scale with the whole
spacecraft yeah so
basically when you reach that point if
you&#39;re still violent and Savage yeah
like humans are you&#39;re now a threat
elsewhere that&#39;s right see so I always
tell people where you know humans tend
to be extremely narcissistic and they
don&#39;t do well Looking Through The Eyes
of others which is to me the heart of
compassion of the Buddha you have to be
able to look at
well how does this look this this
Enterprise on Earth right now look to an
advanced civilization that has come this
way before us and survived yeah I&#39;m
afraid that we we look like we&#39;re in
great trouble and I think we are
um you know I joked back in the 90s I&#39;m
an emergency doctor and I know an
emergency when I see one right and and
this we are in a global emergency writ
large yeah uh but most people are not
open awake to that yet and I think part
of what the disclosure project uh is is
devoted to doing is putting out the
evidence and the information but also a
vision of how to uh be awake to this but
not just get into negative conspiracy
stuff but turn it into a positive
outcome doctor of socially
technologically and economically
spiritually so I think those are all big
undertakings that need to that the
conversation on that needs to be joined
yeah now definitely
how do you think this will be the last
question will be closed but how do you
think this disclosure excuse me can
actually help how can disclosure
actually help with the prevention
of government agencies like the Pentagon
giving these private corporations these
contracted jobs so they can hide them
and then we can&#39;t get a foia we can&#39;t
request information on these because
they&#39;re private do you think that we&#39;ll
see a day when this communication or
this collaboration or collusion that&#39;s
happening to keep these things secreted
away and compartmentalized do you think
there&#39;ll be a day when we can break that
rain that they&#39;ve got on that and make
it to where we have access to see what&#39;s
happening if if we can get these open
hearings or even if there is a
classified process first that leads to
open we have the people who can blow the
whistle on that how it&#39;s structured and
then there could be reforms in the law
that prevent it uh I I do know that a
clock has been put on this and this is
the sensitive thing I did
referred to and I have to be very
careful but
I&#39;m working with this a number of teams
here in Washington and we don&#39;t know
each other okay all right and Advising
and providing evidence and information
to them
but there&#39;s one team that absolutely is
hoping this gets resolved
through the Constitutional process
through what we&#39;re doing perhaps with
this Rico civilian lawsuit if there are
any attorneys out there who want to join
us contact us and you&#39;ll see that we
have 50 some attorneys now we can use
more with different Specialties we also
need private investigators former
prosecutors Etc
but
I think that
when we when we look at that if that
can&#39;t get resolved by pretty much the
end of this year or early next year
there are some folks who are very Fed Up
in the Special Operations enforces
community that are going to move but
that that can be dangerous yeah and
could result
frankly in a bloodbath right so what
we&#39;re trying to do is move this very
quickly
um I know those guys very much hope we
succeed
and don&#39;t have to do what they&#39;ve been
chartered to do right so I&#39;m only
referring to this obliquely to say that
you know having been involved with this
for 30 years
well first of all I won&#39;t be alive 30
more years but but I know that this this
process needs to actually get come to a
head in a proper Channel yeah you know
constitutional legal oversight White
House other countries yeah I&#39;m having
conversations with people uh connected
to very senior government in the United
Kingdom okay uh and elsewhere but I
think this is why we need to understand
that this is needs to be taken very very
seriously by people in the the UFO UAP
Community
um but also come together to do it in a
coherent way right and uh the more I
will also make an appeal any of you who
know or are folks who&#39;ve been involved
with this with a corporation or
intelligence or military operations
should contact us because the more
people who come together I think a very
poor way to do this are lone wolves
coming out one at a time yeah but when
you come together as a group it re and
these are people who don&#39;t know each
other but have different parts of this
picture from different agencies services
and corporations that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing
this week and weekend at the national
press club on Monday yeah then what
happens it it reinforces each other uh
whereas if you just do if you have an
extraordinary experience as
an intelligence operative or military
personnel or a Lockheed or Raytheon of
official
and you do it by yourself people go ah
you know it doesn&#39;t seem you know like
that&#39;s possible whereas if you have five
or ten or a hundred I want this to
eventually become
a torrent right of a trickle right where
hundreds and then thousands of people
just come forward yeah now a lot of
people are afraid let me say this that
they can&#39;t do that I believe they can
and the foundation of the disclosure
project which I have not talked about
with you much
is the unless otherwise directed letter
unod we wrote to the Clinton
Administration and all federal agencies
in the Pentagon in late 1997 1998 we
gave them 60 days to respond and the
unless otherwise directed is a military
technique that basically says unless
otherwise directed here&#39;s my assessment
and here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do it&#39;s
written that way so no one has to make
an overt action gotcha you see so we did
this and what we said was
these projects are being run illegally
therefore the non-disclosure agreements
and the secrecy owes that anyone has
taken corporate or governmental are
completely nullified yeah they&#39;re
invalid they&#39;re invalid because the
operation the underlying operation is
illegal gotcha now if you&#39;re just
someone who&#39;s a foot soldier in this a
Delta Force guy or a Navy SEAL or
someone who&#39;s working at a corporation
as a part of this huge operation you
wouldn&#39;t know that we know it because
having briefed people like the CI
director and senators and Senior
flag officers and Generals Admirals at
the Pentagon we know that it&#39;s that way
so we&#39;re going to establish that as a
proof right
now at that point everyone is exonerated
that you can leave one of these
underground bases with part of an ET
craft an ET body documents and your own
information with impunity right because
until those operations are put under
legal oversight by we the peoples and
government those projects are illegal
they cannot use the wall when they&#39;re
breaking the wall exactly this is I want
to say this very forcefully this is why
we need you know dozens then hundreds
and then thousands of people yeah it&#39;s
coming forward basically being liberated
yes exactly it&#39;s a snowball rolling down
the hill basically once all this begins
to happen it&#39;s going to unfold and
there&#39;s nobody that can stop it and
those always our strategy I mean back in
you know when I
tried to get the Congress and the
president to do this in the 90s before
we went public in 2001 22 years ago here
in Washington uh where we are now uh I&#39;d
hope that people in Congress would uh
take care of it yeah I never thought I&#39;d
leave my medical career to address this
yeah uh you know I&#39;ve lost over 12
million dollars in income doing this as
a doctor
um but not that anyone cares about that
but I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s a real
sacrifice for myself I mean come on
that&#39;s a real sacrifice for all the
gossips out there but the point I&#39;m
making is that you know now that we&#39;re
at this point whether the laws are in
place now yeah which we worked hard and
I gave feedback on this one that was
passed
um in uh December yeah that allowed the
whistleblowers initially that wall was
going to leave out corporate guys I said
oh no the center of gravity in this is
Corporate yeah and not government
so I said we need to get those guys
protected too so that&#39;s what we have now
I think again the next thing we have to
have are more protective laws and you
know that are explicit for their
pensions the personal safety right and
amnesty if they were involved in
something illegal so they&#39;re not
prosecuted they&#39;re coming forward
completely and then also an open hearing
process I hope it&#39;s most likely that a
house committee like the government
reform and oversight committee which
does these sort of Investigations would
be the lead investigative committee
rather than in the Senate this is what
uh historically is the case it could
happen under the Aegis of any of these
authorized committees frankly they&#39;re
they&#39;re probably at least half a dozen
committees where this would fall under
their purview money Appropriations right
defense
intelligence yeah oversight
science and technology in the house
there are a number of them that could
hold hearings and maybe they&#39;re the best
path would be multiple investigations
simultaneously yeah well I think if one
breaks through then you&#39;ll see others
then fall in line with it yeah but it
needs to be the initial process up to
the hearing should be that they and I&#39;m
going to announce this
this week we have provided the entire
disclosure project intelligence archive
with the 752 Witnesses all the facility
sites and a lot of other 121 crash
retrieval cases wow uh to the Senate to
the White House to the Pentagon and uh
on Monday I&#39;ll be handing it off
personally to a member of Congress wow
for the House of Representatives that&#39;s
amazing so that&#39;s the and here&#39;s good
news folks
these at this point there can be no
excuses the U.S government now will have
in their possession everything they need
to get to the bomb this and I mean
everything yeah you know we&#39;re the
northern helicopter bases in the Nevada
test range wow where they were deployed
to retrieve both man-made crashed UFOs
and extraterrestrial ones because the
witness who was there gave us that data
yeah and it&#39;s in there so all of that is
there now and now the people you guys us
just ordinary folks like me need to now
say okay the government must be
accountable yeah they&#39;ve been given the
information no more excuses to do it at
the end of the day the government
actually is supposed to work for us yes
into thinking that we work for them I
know I know and people believe it yeah
like they&#39;re our masters no yeah exactly
no they&#39;re the servants get yes of
course we&#39;re the bosses correct and you
know it&#39;s funny because I have a my dad
was a half Native American and my mom&#39;s
family were some of the original
prisoner of war with the British wow my
father was hand-to-hand combat on
amphibious Landing units in World War II
in in the Pacific yeah and had terrible
PTSD over it frankly but uh who wouldn&#39;t
and uh but I always tell people you know
this is a time where we need to come
together but instead of a violent
Enterprise a peaceful one of disclosure
yeah uh and the rule of law but the only
way the Congress and the president is
going to act is that they hear from you
guys so here&#39;s my other request please
write to your two senators and your
member of the House Representatives your
own representative and to the president
asking them to take action and tell them
that the disclosure project has provided
them all the actual intelligence they
need to get to the bottom of this yeah
you know we&#39;ve spent millions of dollars
to 30 years assembling this it&#39;s now
been handed off on hard drives yeah
beautiful and tell everyone again where
uh this event is this weekend and what
they can expect yeah and so you can give
them a link if you can&#39;t be there in
person at the JW Marriott on on Saturday
uh tomorrow the 10th and Sunday we&#39;re
going to have you know a huge 12 hours
of presentations from the witnesses from
me from uh Aerospace historian uh
Michael schrat and others uh Dr zahari
and but then on Monday
the uh 12th at the national Press Club
we&#39;re going to stream live for free
globally that entire Press Club event
with the witnesses
no that&#39;s only an hour and a half
presentation half hour question answer
yeah so the weekend of that you&#39;re gonna
get
uh 10 times more information obviously
right at least 10 times more yeah
um and I encourage people who can&#39;t come
in person to just get the webinar link
because it gives you and if you can&#39;t
see it live we&#39;re going to keep it up
there for a couple months where you can
see it at your leisure yeah so I would
encourage people to do that and it also
helps to phrase some of the costs of
what we&#39;re doing this year we&#39;re going
to spend at least 500 000 on further
developing the archive
confidentially you know I I I&#39;ve been
telling the people I won&#39;t say who but
the people who&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been
bringing the DC to go through this gift

lodging yeah their food for their cars
