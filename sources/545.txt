 The advertisements for the journal made it clear that it would "aim to show that Spiritualism and Christianity, rightly interpreted, are mutual friends; while apart from communications in the 'Open Council,' and for the opinions in which the Editor will not hold himself responsible, no line will be permitted to appear that calls in question the supreme authority of Christ in all matters of faith and duty."  Young (1828-1893) was a former secularist and pastor of the "Iron Church," "a Free Christian Church" in Swindon.  His pastorate apparently fell apart after Young's spiritualist views and his allowing a faith-healing charlatan to use the premises to cure the sick, sore, lame and disabled, with disastrous results.  Sexton was a secularist who turned Christian spiritualist after Robert Owen called his attention to the new movement.  He later renounced spiritualism because of its common opposition to Christianity.  The journal carried book reviews, reports of seances and spirit messages, excerpts from Swedenborg and Robert Dale Owen, the disputes between James Burns and Benjamin Coleman (reprinted as a supplement) and regular letters and articles by F.J. Theobald, J. Enmore Jones, J. Page Hopps, William Howitt, Dr. Berridge, and by Georgiana Houghton, including her transcription of a communication from "David, King and Psalmist" on the interpretation of the drawings he had given through Houghton's hand.  Ownership and editorship of the journal was handed over to Sexton with the issue of August 1874, because of the financial drain of its publication, and in September 1875 Sexton incorporated the journal in the Spiritual Magazine which also he edited, again because of the lack of capital to continue its publication.
