THIRD LECTURE
HERE is one subject, as enthralling as itispro­
found, that we are forced to discuss before
we can go forward with these papers. It is
the serious probability that you, and every
other human being in existence at this mo­
ment, have lived many lives on earth!
Before we discuss why or how planets came
into being—designating thereby what pur­
poses they serve—or why human history has
been what we shall find it, we must take
under scrutiny the mighty tenet that earthly
experiences are now, and always have been, too varied and profitable
for human souls to know but one earth-life and never any more
throughout all eternity.
We cannot take time out to analyze this cosmic certainty after we are
embarked upon our considerations of Astronomy, Geology, and Soci­
ology. Itwould come out of place in the exposition of our theme. We
must look into the philosophical aspects of the proposition here and
now, for more and more as we go on reading we shall be impressed
with the fact that without first giving some sort of credence to this
doctrine of repeated existence, there is neither rhyme nor reason in
the mortal universe of which we find ourselves a part. On the other
hand, as we are disposed to accredit it we shall make the astounding
discovery that it seems to explain or rationalize almost every enigma
that confronts us in Cosmos. This last is a point that we can by no
meansignore.
Human beings want Nature’s processes and wonders explained to
3
them. The first question put by the child to its parents is “Why?”
Men and women—who are ever grown-up children—are still obsessed
with the query of "Why?" So, after exhaustive research, we discern
that there may be a “Why?" if we’re willing to forego our bias fora
moment in considering explanations for the universe as a system.
There are men who, after long thought and study have come to the
conclusion that Cosmos is not impersonal. Cosmos exists for thein­
dividual, not the individual as an incident to Cosmos. The material
to be considered later forces us to adopt the same viewpoint, whether
it gratifies our vanities or not.
This question about living more than once in a physical body cannot
be dismissed by indignantly crying: “I’ve got no use for the occult
doctrine of reincarnation!" or “The Bible says nothing about us com­
ing back to earth and so I refuse to consider such a prospect!’ or If
I’d really lived before, I’d remember it, wouldn’t I? As I can’t recall
doing it, such a proposal is absurd!"
At once we’re challenged by the three responses: first, that reincar­
nation has nothing to do with occultism as such—unless we would
maintain that all life is occult—second, that the Bible has very much
to say indeed about the truth of return to earth-life and that evenJesus
mentioned it particularly, and that third, just because one personcan­
not recall his past careers is no evidence in law that the next mandoes
not, either. -t*
Whether we’re disposed to favor it or not, there seems to be a most
formidable and inescapable case to be made out in support of thecon­
tention that men know earth-life more than once.
Physics provides the possibility of serried earth-lives, psychical re­
search offers astounding testimony that every mortal being has lived
in flesh before, and the science of Ethnology—or the study of thenat­
ural races and families of men—offers no other hypothesis for the
enigmas of human history. But over and above all of these, hereis
the proposal that we must face down:—
Squirm against, or wrangle over, the “theory" as we may, we still
cannot get around the fact that if we care to accredit the fact ofserried
earthly rebirth, most of whatever, has happened in society of earth
makes sense, whereas to repudiate or deny the theory leaves us con­
fronting a world wherein social life is bedlam and reasonless sterility.
C If we’re willing that it should be the latter, why make further effort
to study Life at all?
Frankly, it’s not a matter of trying to “cram" some weird oriental
4
doctrine down anybody’s throat, dynamiting the fundamentals of
Christian theology, or building a life-hypothesis on a set of rakish
notions that contradict the senses. Rather it’s a matter of forgoing
controversy based on personal reactions and examining such evidence
asmayprove to fit the facts.
F we search the whole gamut of human wisdom, as be­
fore stated, and come on no solution to the quandary of
mortality outside, forsooth, or the reincarnational ex­
planation, and then if we examine the reincarnational
explanation and find solutions supplied for every enigma
that mortal life contains, what recourse have we as schol­
ars and philosophers but to conclude that the Doctrine of Rebirth is
thetrue Life Fundamental, and the quicker we understand it, the hap­
pier shall be our prospects?
Remember, throughout this series, that we’re not particularly inter­
ested in advancing freak ideas— for the sake of being “different” or
eccentric or clever—nor proposing knowledge for a cult that profits
anybody’s wallet; we’re giving time and effort to this Study Course
because we want facts not now within our knowledge and an insight
into Cosmos that shall profit us practically.
If human souls actually do return to earth-life—instead of being
dragged by the scruffs of their spiritual necks off into any celestial
courtroom to be “judged”—and if they do evolve from social stratum
to social stratum till all earth’s profits have been taken, and gradual
tions into higher octaves of activity follow then as a matter of pro­
motion, should it not be the part of everyday sense to stop fighting
the doctrine because of our complexes and seek to understand its
processes and benefits? Do we not owe this to ourselves?
Anyhow, it is convincingly demonstrated that we cannot interpret
what has happened upon this planet in bygone ages, or what is hap­
peningin this present, in a way that makes logic, without falling back
onthisdoctrine of rebirth.
So,approaching attesting evidence as to its validity in an orderly man­
ner,we find that our supporting data classify into three divisions.
Undereach division we find three major arguments.
Puttingit in another way, there are three major arguments confirming
the fact of Earthly Return from the Physical or Materialistic Stand­
point; there are three major arguments confirming it from the
Mental or Esoteric standpoint; there are three major arguments con-
5
firming it from the Spiritual or Ethical standpoint. First we wii
them, then we shall examine them :— S
FROM THE PH YSICAL OR M ATERIAL STANDPOINT:
1. In a universe where Nature is observed to waste nothing that is built
from atoms, the item of Consciousness cannot be the sole exception to hi
economy.
2. It is apparent from watching the growth of intelligence in animals th
a
t
Consciousness requires more than one life-span to achieve to the highest e
x
-
hibits of self-awareness.
3. The strange spiritual manifestation known as Individuality must co
m
e
from vaster sources than the biological or parental, since laws of heredity
fail to apply to it.
FROM THE M EN TAL OR ESO TER IC STANDPOINT: |
1. Few people of intelligence live their lives without encountering persons
or scenes that give them a haunting sense of having known such persons or
scenes intimately before.
2. The quality of the individual consciousness seems to remain constant
from the cradle to the grave, therefore it is not developed by any single life’s
experiences.
3. Languages, customs, and terrors regarding natural catastrophes, that are
consciously recalled, together with speakings of children that have no present-
life source.
FROM TH E SP IR IT U A L OR E T H IC A L STA N D PO IN T:
1. Society would be the supreme piece of celestial injustice if human beings
only lived once and only knew the profits or impoverishments to which they
were born.
2. The Law of Compensation, of being repaid in kind for acts committed
or debts contracted, would be farcical and sterile if only one life offered in
which it could operate.
3. From whence come society’s leaders and mentors to groups, indeed from
whence come groupings themselves, unless classifications and discipleships
had been arranged prenatally under sponsors who have had the earlier world-
experiences ?
6
Takingup these nine postulates in the order above listed, we examine
thefirst of them:—
Uow does Nature’s divine economy make the termination of con­
sciousnessan inconsistency?
HIS matter of life-wastage is the one contradiction in all
Nature’s operations—a contradiction, that is, if con­
sciousness in fish, bird, beast, or human be said to perish
when physical mechanism is damaged or demolished.
C Nature, we know, wastes nothing in the world of ma­
terials. Consider the fact that no matter what substance
you may examine, you find that essentially—that is, chemically or
radioactively—it cannot perish to absolute disappearance.
Nature grows a tree. It puts out leaves for a hundred springtimes.
Thena forest fire passes and blights it from existence. But that fire
onlyblights it from existence as a tree. The materials making the
treearestillinexistence, in the form of either gases or ash. The vapor
orvolatilematter has escaped into the atmosphere from the wood dur­
ingthecombustion, the carbon dioxide and nitrogen adding their con­
tenttothe atmosphere. The ash has spread upon the sod and added
itschemical content to the ground. All the ingredients that went to
makethat tree are somewhere in existence; their form may have
alteredbut their quantities remain intact.
Orconsiderwhat occurs in the animal world, the lion seizing and de­
vouringthe deer, the hawk living off the starling, the shark obtaining
itsfoodfrom the cephalopod. Larger and fiercer carnivora preserve
theirphysical selves by taking the chemicals from the bodies of their
prey into their rapacious mechanisms. Absorbing such prey, they
endure for a span, then “die”—and those mechanisms disintegrate.
The chemicals from disintegration cause vegetation about the car­
cassestoflourishabnormally. Nothing going to compose the physical
lionordeer, or hawk and starling, or shark and cephalopod, whether
onedines off the other or meets death and disintegrates from natural
causes, passes from existence. Chemistry and physics both contend
thatthere is precisely the same atomic content in the universe today
astherewasat the beginning of the first spiral nebula.
Asthephysicists put it, “Matter is indestructible.”
Oneanonymouswriter has phrased it thus: “Science finds no time or
place, or thing set apart, and alone sanctified by one instantaneous,
all-embracing creative act. Cosmic evolution or organic transition,
7
the growth of stars and suns, of earth and plant and physical man, are
continuous parts of one restless operation. The more formal chemis­
try of earth and sea and air, the flowing chemistry of protoplasmic cell
and organ, the moulding discipline of associated nerve and muscle,
eye and hand, the alchemy of related lives in Nature’s household, are
but different phases of one continuous all-pervading process of crea­
tion and recreation.
“Nebulae stiffen into stars, and suns give birth to drooling planets, lava-
smeared. Throbbing tides of sea and air, the heartbeats of a planet,
drive the nutrient ocean to the mountain skeleton and through the
capillaries of earth, clothing her ribs in clay and spreading her primal
gardens of ooze. Earth labors in her kitchen and with equal skill in
synthesis, brings forth atoms tied in stable squads and marching regi­
ments, crystals straight-eyed and steadfast, protoids and albumens,
with rounded forms and yielding sides, dancing specks and wriggling
threads—prophets of the life to come—sprawling self-consuming
protoplasm, free to rove or wrapped in rigid walls or bound in glow­
ing brotherhoods of cells together, polyp and snail, worm and crab,
fish and frog, bird and ape, and at last—naked and hand-free—high­
headed man, armored and armed, with conscience and with vision.
Scrutinize as best she may, Science finds no seam in this universal
fabric, no patchwork of Dead and Alive, honored or dishonored, in
creation; no barriers between what Was, and Is, and Shall Bel
In the face of such incontestable scientific certainty, the Luciferian
materialist asks us to accept that Nature thinks more of the chaff-
feather on the butterfly’s wings—in that she is careful to preserve for­
ever the ingredients out of which it is constructed—than she does of
the personality-consciousness of a Shakespeare, a Newton, or a
Michelangelo.
Does Nature conserve all physical substance, down to the most remote
atom that persists in the physical universe, but neglect or repudiate
what is more volatile and therefore should be more valuable than all
of these: Self-Discriminating Life?
The atheistic sentimentalist arraigns Nature for being “cruel’’in that
she appears to take no note of the sufferings and atrocious extermina­
tions of consciousness in a million sentient species. Rapacious attack
and death are everywhere, he bemoans, and Nature which is so prodi­
gious in first spilling life forth, is equally as callous in permitting it to
perish, t?
What, however, if behind this seeming callousness there exists the
8
compassionate knowledge on Nature’s part that it has ordained—and
is sustaining—a process of which ignorant man grasps nothing: that
Consciousness is more positive in its perpetuity than any material
atom in the universe, that it vacates these mechanical forms as they
are damaged or destroyed only to occupy newly spawned forms con­
secutively, that Consciousness isbeyond damage ordestruction byany
material force in the universe, that it makes no difference how many
physical mechanisms it is forced to vacate, Nature’s generosity ever
has new ones ready to receive them?
Consciousness must survive because all chemical and radioactive sub­
stance in the universe survives. There is no such thing as callous
blotting-out of life in Nature because Nature blots out nothing—
merely alters its form of expression or function.
The orthodox theologian concedes that this is so, but rationalizes the
mystery by saying that in man’s case his survival operates in a bliss­
ful state of celestial tranquility called Heaven—or in a doleful state
oftorment known as Hell. But he cannot locate either heaven orhell.
No one has entered either locality to return and describe it.
The Transcendentalist views such theological conjecturing or ration­
alizing with his tongue in his cheek. Arguing from the imperish­
ability of Matter that consciousness cannot be less than Matter in im­
portance, and consigned to extermination with the loss of physical
mechanism, he examines the orthodox provision for the subsequent
stateand is faced by one of two alternatives for belief:—
Either Consciousness changes form, or to get any type of expression
it must acquire a new mechanism to get expression with.
This produces two bedevilments: First, can Consciousness change
form and still be consciousness? Second, if it does not, and wishes a
new body for physical expression, why should not a new body in the
biological sense—and in this same physical universe—be quite as
beneficial to its purposes as some gaseous astral equipment that needs
environment outside the atomic to operate?
The transcendental philosopher sees nothing of particular spiritual
profit for the soul in the celestial tranquility and idleness of the or­
thodox heaven, so he is forced to conclude that if Consciousness sur­
vives as chemical substances survive, and the orthodox heaven pro­
vides no particular spiritual profit and cannot be located in addition,
thenbysimple deduction it follows that life in successive earthly forms
is as desirable as it is probable.
9
HIS brings him—and us—to a consideration of the Sec­
ond Postulate suggesting the fact of Reincarnation: that
it is apparent from watching the growth,of intelligence
in animals and the lower forms of Spirit-Consciousness
in exercise, that more than one planetary life-span is
vigorously necessary to achieve to the highest perform­
ance of self-aware behavior that earth-life may produce. C Nowlet
us get this point very clear: that Consciousness of itself is incompar­
able; that is, a spirit, whether of man or sea anemone, is either con­
scious or it is not. We speak colloquially of a dunce being “half-con­
scious” or a living person whose head has been hit a blow as being
temporarily “unconscious”—all the same we recognize that a truly
unconscious person is as dead as a smelt. There is such a thing as un­
focused Consciousness, commonly known as subconsciousness, but
living beings are at all times aware that they are alive and are usually
able to identify themselves instantly, to themselves, for what theyare,
and the station they are occupying, in the Plan of Creation.
When we come to Quality of Consciousness, or Grade of Intellect,
however, we are dealing in something entirely different.
Here we get into Facility in Conscious Function.
A monkey is conscious but it lacks the quality of consciousness to
write a sonnet.
The average iceman or plumber is conscious but he could scarcely
perform in the earthly scene with the mental adroitness of a Herbert
Spencer, a Steinmetz, or a Gladstone.
Something occurs to make these exhibits of consciousness operate af­
ter their own peculiar gradations of intellect. Biological factors seemto
have little to do with it, for some of the finest biological specimens of
men are found among the grossest savages, and yokels who could
scarcely read, write, or cipher, have given birth to offspring that be­
came Mozarts, Franklins, and Lincolns.
If one earth-life were responsible for changing the quality of con­
sciousness of the yokel to the savant, then every gamin or guttersnipe
ought to end his days as a Sir Isaac Newton or a Leonardo de Vinci
simply by living long enough. Thus every 90-year-old man we observe
ought to be a sage—whereas there are tens of thousands of 90-year-old
men who are quite as much fools as boys of eighteen.
One lifetime, one habitat, one social situation or run of fortune, is
decidedly not sufficient to alter the quality of a human spirit’s intelli­
gence and make it instinctively old in every type of wisdom. On the
10
other hand, it should be entirely plausible that ten, fifty, or perhaps
a hundred mortal careers might begin to make impression upon the
natural functionings of intellect and cause it to act with an instinctive
wisdomout of the sum-total of all such experiencings.
If, therefore, in the same world and possessed of the same physical
equipage, there be one person who at sixty is still a dumb human ox,
andanother person who at sixty is, say, the keenly intelligent head of
amammoth industry, it must follow in logic that one has not enjoyed
thenumber of previous careers that the other has enjoyed.
The sheer brevity of the average human life-span fails to provide ac­
tivityor experience enough to perfect the quality of consciousness in
aperson so that it is noticeable; therefore it is submitted that as there
aredifferences in expressions of consciousness in the men and women
all about us, some must have had functionings in mortal scenes that
others have not yet known.
This logical deduction brings us to the third Postulate: The extra­
ordinary item in the human composition recognized and labeled as
Individuality. . . .
HE DICTIONARY defines Individuality as the state of
possessing distinctive character—an indefinable Some­
thing that outside the quality of the intelligence marks a
man or woman out from all fellowmen or sister-women
anywhere in life. What can that Something be, and from
whence has it developed? C Again we are forced to
concede that parental or hereditary endowments have had little to do
with it. A given pair of parents will have seven children. Six will be
nondescripts, and remain nondescripts all their lives. The seventh,
through nothing which early environment or parentage has done for
him, will be a Personage.
Conversely, a given celebrity will have a fool for a son, and the fallacy
of inherited or inheritable greatness has long since passed into the
language in the form of the axiom that “great men rarely reproduce
themselves.” tf*
Individualitytruly is “the expression of peculiarities of spirit that have
beeneffected because a given soul has functioning in mortality in the
same way over so many periods of lives that the continuity of such
behavior is inescapable.
Inotherwords, a given soul reacts to life’s situations in a manner that
it has developed from similar technique up whole cycles of careers.
%
u
It has brought through from those careers an inevitable self-confidence
that it can handle itself in any dilemma in which it finds itself. Par.
ticularly can it take care of itself in social situations where instinctive
nonchalance or gracious self-assertion is the role.
What matters it whether it gained into life through the loins of achar­
woman in London or a social registerite in Chicago? Once presented
with its new body, and that body rendered independent of the eco­
nomic care of the parents, it will forthwith manifest after the manner
of its character.
That character must perforce have concreted in that peculiar manner
up through a hundred generations, since it begins to exhibit itself in
the child at about the age of seven—and long before the child could
have connived such aplomb or facility for itself.
These three postulates then, the economy of Nature in conserving
in some form whatsoever has been created, the slow growth of intelli­
gence as such, and the exercise of individuality which could by no
manner of means have been evolved in the present career, constitute
the three reasonable symptoms on the physical or material plane for
making it ponderable that each human intellect has had some experi­
ence with mortality before the current life-span.
Now how about the Mental or Esoteric?
ONSTANTLY throughout our lives it is a generally ad­
mitted fact that all of us encounter strangers, new ac­
quaintances, friends, or neighbors, with whose personali­
ties we feel a haunting sense of familiarity. Somepeople
we like “instinctively** as we say; others bestir a violent
hostility from the moment of our meeting them. Rarely
does it occur to us, however, to sit down and figure out why we na­
turally are drawn to certain persons and repelled by others. To say
that we “vibrate** with those we like, is to deal in mere words. Why
should we “vibrate** with some temperaments and be antagonized
by others?
In this circumstance of an “instinctive**
who become our intimates, we behold one of the most potent attest-
ments of previous lives in the earth-state, and evidence that such
familiarity is naught but the mere renewal of some one-time relation­
ship! ii* ±?
This is particularly true of such relationships as are concerned with
romance between one man and one woman.
12
feeling of familiarity for those
Agiven man or woman may search all his or her life for some individ­
ual of the opposite sex who fills all specifications of a *'preconceived
ideal” as to what a spiritual, mental, and physical affinity should be.
Ten thousand such candidates may be met and looked over critically.
Perchance a couple of abortive marriages may be attempted. Finally
‘‘exactly the right person” walks into the other’s affairs, and the heart-
grope is ended.
What can such heart-grope possibly be in the first place but a remem­
bered knowledge of association with some particular personality that
was joined to us closely in previous phases of worldly adventuring?
C If we deny or ignore the reincarnational basis for such "instinc­
tive” intimacies, we are left utterly at sea as to how to explain them.
C Then too there is a similar sense of haunting familiarity often at­
tached to localities, neighborhoods or structures which we recognize
we have never been in before, in the current span of consciousness.
We visit a country or a locality abroad, and some particularly lovely
scene, or some outstanding historic environment, bestirs what seems
equivalent to definite memories of having lived long and avidly in
those surroundings before.
There is one outstanding case of record where an American young
woman, taken to Rome on her honeymoon, paused in great mental
distress on a certain spot in the Roman Forum. *Tve been here be­
fore!” she astounded her husband by exclaiming. "It was long, long
ago! I remember ... I was a Temple Girl ... I let the Light go out
... theyburied me alive in punishment, and this is the spot where they
interred my body!”
The mystified and skeptical husband was finally prevailed upon to
settle the matter by negotiating with the civic authorities for the lift­
ing of a certain slab in the Forum, long-since worn smooth by time.
C Under the slab a cavity was disclosed, and in the cavity reposed
the faint remains of a feminine skeleton!
It did not prove, of course, that the skeleton was hers; yet how did
that particular American woman, down here in the twentieth century,
havesuch "recollections” first aroused within her mind, at all?
Again the hypothesis that all of us have lived before, and often retain
inour cosmic mentalities the memories of high-voltage historical hap­
penings by having lived through them, or died because of them, is
theonlyrational explanation for such phenomena of the spirit.
It is easier to accredit the reincarnational explanation than to go fur-
13
ther afield and try to find others—that turn out to be still more necro-
mantic. . . .
HAT the quality of the individual consciousness is more
or less constant within the one span of mortality, that
we have quite as much “intelligence” at five years of age
as we have at fifty, is another confirmation of the serried-
life theory. True, at fifty we know more facts. We
have passed through experiences that are direct and vivid
in the processes of recollection. But our grasp of them, our ability to
assimilate them, seems to be something that we come into life with,
and consistently retain.
This presupposes that anybody’s quality of consciousness has been a
long time perfecting to what the present life finds it.
All about us, in every form of sentient existence, we see Nature en­
larging and maturing the quality of the consciousness by trial-and-
error methods. If Nature does it at all, in any one instance, it cannot
be a freak of circumstance; it must be part of a process. If it is part
of a process, and each life is a fragmentary demonstration of it, then
we have an equation indicating that each life is a fragmentary demon­
stration of an interminable cosmic career. This follows, because it
is a law of mathematics and physics that the Whole is the sum of all
of its parts.
If this one earth-life were all we had to live, and all persons were born
into the same kind of mortal experiences, they should all arrive at a
uniformity of human intelligence. Mortality would be a standardized
process of spiritual development, and all of us should be as identical
as each pea in a bushel of peas is identical with its neighbors.
We do have evidence that most people, having lived long lives, seem
to have acquired a slightly better grasp on things mentally than they
disclosed as adolescents. But this mental facility is so slight in its
development that one mortal lifetime could by no means account for
the displays of mental agility and spiritual sagacity that we see dis­
played on all sides by our run of daily companions. We have to
account for this difference in gradations of intelligence by acknowl­
edging that whereas Nature perfects intelligence by trial-and-error
lessons, she employs more than one mortal life-span to achieve the
many products of super-intelligence that distinguish modern society.
C Such, however, are mere philosophic postulations; they by no
means fall into the same classification with the phenomena of what
we term Lifted Memories.
14
OW this Lifted Memory business may at times become a
terrific thing to contemplate.
It startles the average person to be told for the first time
that there seem to be people going to and fro in the world
of the present who have the ability to recall specific epi­
sodes from prior lives quite as vividly and provably as
the normal person recalls episodes out of his current boyhood or girl­
hood. Cases referred to at random here, and in this connection, are
merely offered to illustrate the point.
Therewas, in New York City up to 1930, a young woman born in
southwestern Ohio, who in her thirty years had never been out of
theUnited States. Furthermore, she had never studied Egyptology
orArchaeology. This is known to be absolutely so.
Andyet that young woman had a cosmic memory so vivid in char­
acter—of her many previous lives in Egyptian dispensations—that
shewasfrequently consulted by experts of the Metropolitan Museum
ofFineArts to establish the authenticity or “periods” of countless ob­
jects and relics recovered from the sands of the country adjacent to
theNile. There is no evidence that she ever once erred.
Thereare three persons living in the United States at the present time
andknown to your Lecturer, but not known to one another—one re­
siding in New York City, one in Cleveland, Ohio, and the third in
California—who all tell the same general story of an episode in an­
cient history, occurring in the days of the Third Dynasty, in which
theyeach played separate roles. One played the role of a young cap­
tainof the guard, one played the role of his betrayed sweetheart, and
the third played the role of a lady of the court.
These three persons have each told their experiences in that ancient
Egyptian drama, and all three sets of experiences dovetail without
asingle discrepancy.
Only a trio that actually had gone through some volatile social ad­
venture together could recall and describe such perfectly synchroniz­
ingdetails. £? •£*
The obvious explanation is doubtless the correct one. Their spirits
lived mortally in separate physical mechanisms in that far-off time
and day jy
Inthis connection too, cases are known where groups of people living
at present can converse and understand one another in tongues that
have long-since passed from earthly usage.
Hieroglyphics on ancient Central American monuments have been

CCEPTING such logical deductions from the Physical
Mental and Spiritual aspects of mortality, it is not at all
difficult to perceive where society obtains its leaders,
teachers, mentors, and rulers, that have appeared un­
failingly in every age to take charge in every dispensa­
tion and guide it through every political and economic
orgasm. People who “come to the top’*through bona fide physical,
mental, or spiritual merit, life upon life, era upon era, are merely
spirits that have come and gone in more earth-lives than others. They
have, in short, profited from more worldly experiencings. Theyhave
“found their ways around** in so many cycles of existence that they
have become competent to show others “the way around*’... anddo
so, instinctively, ip ip I
Where such spirits originally start from, and what determines their
roles in succeeding lives, lies outside the domain of this Lecture and
can be found treated in many of the Liberation Esoteric Scripts. Your
attention is called here merely to the fact that repeat performances
in the earthly and worldly arena must be what happens, because the
whole phenomenon of the vicissitudes of human history would be
non-interpretable otherwise.
Of course, the lay student, asked to seriously consider this sort of
thing for the first time, at once falls back upon his religious—orat
least theological—reflexes. He cries to himself: “But if this returning*
to-earth again and again, be true, what then becomes of the lifefunda­
mentals as expounded in the Bible? The Bible says that the soul is
created when a baby is born, it lives its life—good or bad—on eairth,
then at the termination of mortality it comes to be ‘judged.’ It is
then consigned to heaven or hell as compensation for its deeds inthe
flesh. The Bible is supposed to be the inspired Word of God. More­
over, Christ said nothing about this earthly-return business—or did
He? To accredit it, I’m being asked to throw overboard the whole
Christian religionl** |
These are natural reactions, true enough. But on the other hand, this
whole series of Galahad Lectures—and the history of the world from
the esoteric standpoint—aims specifically at setting you straight, in
these theses ahead, on such volatile points.
We shall see that the Bible is the literary outgrowth of subversive
and anti-Christian Judaism. You shall be given to understand that
it was written in the days of ignorant and superstitious men whodid
not even know that they were dwelling upon a planet that was round.

You shall hear of the Great Heresy of Ebionitism—or the activities
of asect of Jews who started out in the first and second centuries after
Christ to preserve their own religion by making it appear that con­
verts could not be bona fide Christians without first subscribing to
the tenets of Judaism. You will be told how the Israelites got the
religious notion while residing in Egypt, that the soul slept in Sheol
until the Judgment Day, when it was awakened to be sentenced to
either hell or heaven, and that later, when the Jews were taken to
Babylon and suffered the so-called Captivity—bringing them into
contact with Persian Zoroastrians—they wrote it into their holybooks
that the soul went to Paradise at death; in fact, later writers made it
appear that Jesus said to the thieves beside Him on their crosses: “I
say unto you, this day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise!”
These two views are contradictory and paradoxical. Could a real
Word of God be contradictory or paradoxical?
When we honestly investigate, we discover that the Christian religion
was becoming so widely spread and so securely entrenched that it
threatened to destroy Judaism. So the Ebionites undertook to de­
clare that without Jewry there could be no Christianity—that Gen­
tile Christianity was merely confirmation of Jewish Prophecy.
The Jews “tied themselves into it,” in other words, and shaped the
Christian message—insofar as they could—to give themselves the
predominant place in its background.
The seat of heretical Ebionitism was in the Greek city of Pella inupper
Galilee. And here we find most of the New Testament Gospels com­
piled, from 65 to 200 years after Christ’s death.
There is every evidence poking between the lines, that Christ DID
teach the doctrine of Earthly Rebirth; but that the Jews found ways
to edit out all such truths, to make the new religion conform to their
traditions or support them.
If Christ did not teach the doctrine of Earthly Rebirth, how then ac­
count for the conversation between Him and His disciples on the way
down from the Mount of Transfiguration? Read Mark, the 11th
to the 13th verses of the Ninth Chapter: “And they asked him, say­
ing: Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? And He an­
swered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all
things . . . but 1 say unto you that Elias is indeed come and they
have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.”
The 13th verse of the 17th chapter of Matthew adds this comment:
19
“Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the
Baptist.’*
Christ Himself, in other words, if the conversation be correctly re-
ported—and should it not be correct if reported in the “Word of
God”?—said that Elias had returned to earth in the personage of
John the Baptist. Very good!
The deduction is logical: if it were even POSSIBLE for Elias to have
returned to earth in the personage of John the Baptist, then thereIS
such a process in Nature. And if John the Baptist could ha,veavailed
himself of it, how comes it that everyone does not have the samepre­
rogative?
HE FACTS are, that we have no way of telling what
Christ did say in His worldly ministry, when we come
to enlighten ourselves on the mischiefs thrust into early
Christian doctrine by the vindictive Jews and Ebionites.
Here again, our discussion falls into the domain of eso­
teric literature and will be so treated in its proper place.
We are only interested at the moment in considering the fact that
an accrediting of Earthly Revisitation diffuses a mighty illumination
on the dark corridors of human history, and reveals to us for the first
time anywhere, just what programs and objectives have been arrived
at, by Nature and Nature’s God, by making the long gamut of hu­
man intercourse precisely what it has been.
If you can’t accept it for the moment, skip it! But at least read the
Lectures to come, for the compounding evidence they contain that
something of the sort is so.
