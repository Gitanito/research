  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 7 years old and had just  tidied up my room. I wanted to surprise  my mother. I asked my little brother to go get her to come see my efforts. At the moment when my brother left the room, I wanted to move an old green lamp that was on my little red desk. I took the lamp in my hands and immediately felt a heavy electrical shock in my head. 

  Everything went black. I left my body and felt like I was being sucked up. Then I was floating in a dark space. But it was very different from a dream because this was really me, as if my body became very light. I was really aware that it was myself and  not a dream. My vision was very sharp. There were sounds, but not  music. It was  like the sounds of an organ. My mother used to play an organ, so maybe  my brain replayed those sounds during this experience. These sounds had been very pure and  pleasant.  I told myself, 'So, this is what death is like. It's not so serious. In fact, it doesn't hurt.' I didn't feel any fear. To the contrary, it was very pleasant. 

  I saw pictures scrolling like when watching  an old black and white movie. I saw images of my grandparents. My grandfather was dead already, but my grandmother was still alive. I saw pictures of my school, of the North Sea, and of my parents. Big white letters (an alphabet in disorder) was scrolling by in this black space and  all around me. Some letters were forming words. I remember the word 'bike', 'Pierre', 'children', 'school', and other words that I don't remember anymore. I saw words that I didn't understand. I felt very very good, satisfied and completely reassured. I was very curious about what happened to me. 

  In the darkness, I started to see a glow in the distance. I saw an indescribably, powerful light. It was like the brightness of sunlight going through a prism, as if all colors were present but yet all colors are mixed together. It was much more powerful than simply being ' brightness.' I was attracted  by this light, yet it is impossible to say if I was going towards it or if it was coming towards me. The closer it came, the more I felt the immense love eminating from it. The love was so indescribable, that I never knew it before and never experienced it again. 

  In the distance, there was  a human silhouette in the light.  I entered into a tunnel that had very dark walls. I did not feel  scared. The tunnel was  very soft and reassuring. At the end of the tunnel  was and increasingly  blinding light with with the  silhouette in the distance. I felt like I wanted  to see this person at the end of the tunnel. The attraction was so strong, and the love that I sensed was so powerfully immense. I was totally bathed in the light. I saw a  picture of my  brother and mother when they  were older. They weren't fine and they needed me. Suddenly, I felt torn between going towards this light and not coming back  or deciding to remain and to live for them. If I had not seen my mother and brother I probably would have joined this light with the silhouette. I had the sensation that this silhouette was there to watch over me. He also reminded me of being like a ferryman. I talked to the Being  and apologized for not being able to die and go with it. I had to return home for my brother and my mother. The experience ended there.  I felt brutally propelled into my body. I was hurting and had the feeling that my body was burning.

  During this time, my mother and brother arrived in my room. My mother told me, that at first they believed that I was playing a trick. I was on the floor, my whole body was shaking, and I held a lamp in my hands that were sticking to my face. My mother touched me and got an electric shock. Then she enveloped her hands in a cloth and pulled the plug.

  I was propelled into my body. I couldn't get to breath. My mother was shaking me. She took me in her arms and while still shaking me put me on my bed.

  I felt like  my lungs were burning when I got my breath back. I remember that I had  red pantyhose that was  wet from when my bladder released.  I was wet all over and didn't stop shaking.

  In the following month, I wasn't able to fall asleep and was afraid the silhouette  was coming to get me in my sleep. This lasted for months.

  Now, I sometimes see events that will happen. I also can see in the past of certain people. These are very strong images that I find disturbing. I sometimes feel too strongly the emotions of others and this is tiring for me. I have much too much empathy. Sometimes I sense an immense joy and love and I share it in a spontaneous manner without thinking. Some persons are think I am trying to seduce them, but it's not like that. I  share this joy and love because I have to feel totally free. I don't need to be connected to people. I can simply be there and do nothing, and I feel that it is shared on it's own. It's really hard for me to describe this state. I don't find the right words. I believe that this is beyond me. That it is beyond me, that it is not me. I don't know what it is though.

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes  Accident.       I was alone in my room and wanted to displace an old lamp and have been electrocuted.  Other I immediately lost consciousness. The electrocution lasted a long time until  my mother found me.  If my mother had not arrived in time, I would be dead.

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It's inexplicable. It's as if everything had been solved. No questions anymore. The perfection of the present moment. A perfect balance.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     There was no notion of time at all.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       A global vision.

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events.     I saw pictures of the past.  

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future.     It was not exactly my future, but rather the future of my mother and my brother that would affect me.  

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I chose to come back for my little brother and my mother.

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Secular unaffiliated     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I was 7 years old. I was not a believer. I was scared of death. This experience didn't resemble in any way to the idea I had of it.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     It's difficult to describe this. I was 7 years old. I start to believe that somebody at death did really exist and that he could come to take me any moment.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I saw a silhouette, in a human shape.

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     There is a connection between everything. We are part of a whole. I felt it in a very clear way.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I don't know.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   I don't know. I believe that something of this experience remained in myself. Sometimes I sense and see things. It's difficult to describe or to explain. It's not really a knowing. It's as if I was connected to something that is beyond me.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         I am uncertain if an afterlife exists     Uncertain     I don't know.

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I felt this immense love. I was bathed in it.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life     I think having explained this already.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I needed to keep away from people. I felt too much all the things around me. I was more timid. More withdrawn. Today I'm not at all anymore.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There really are no words to describe something which is solely based upon sensations. The sounds, the colors and the sensations cannot be compared to any other ones.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It's THE most precise memory of my childhood. As if it was yesterday.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     Yes, I think so. It's not simple to answer this question. This hyper sensibility and this ability to see pictures of the past of people, or even sometimes the future, I don't consider it a faculty, but rather as something which is hampering and tiring in experiencing it.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The love that I felt has to be shared.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    With my mother directly after the accident.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I don't remember.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     It is beautiful in the sense that I experienced it. I didn't dream it.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   In dream. In a kind of waking dream. I sensed the love. Not like in the experience. A universal love.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         non  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         There are already many questions.
