  		              		Experience Description   

    About 6:20 p.m. on February 19, I left the store and was heading for my truck.  A delivery van hit me from behind and ran over me. The right side of my jacket must have caught on something because I was dragged for some distance since the clothing on my left side was shredded. My left arm and shoulder got the worst of it. 

  I was unconscious from being hit on the head. I had and still have a concussion. 
  
  The first thing I remember was that I was standing next to a wall of some kind. I assume now that I was in an ambulance, but I was up high and looking down at a paramedic working on someone on a stretcher. I did not feel anything but I became aware of a giant roaring in my head. The roaring was so loud that I will probably never forget it. I have no idea how long I watched, but it seemed like several minutes. Then without warning, I was on the stretcher and in more pain than I ever thought possible.  

  The next memory I have was becoming conscious in a helicopter.  The pain was unbearable and with the helicopter blades thumping, I thought that I was  in Vietnam and had been shot. 

  Every paramedic and all the doctors and most of the nurses told me I was so lucky because I should have been dead.

  In summation, I know that I was looking at myself on that stretcher. I did not see bright lights, nor did I see any departed loved ones. I did not see any tunnels. I did not see hell or heaven or any angels. I only saw the paramedic working on the man on the stretcher. I know I watched the paramedic save my life.

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes , I have deeper faith 

  What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant.   I am much more faithful  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I believe that when the body dies, you still exist. I have always had this belief but now my belief is positively reinforced many times over.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I view life in a better light. I think I'm a better person and I try to be a better Christian.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I absolutely believe in an afterlife. I am a Baptized Christian, but I always wondered about life after death. I no longer have any doubts.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     I should have been dead, but I could see the paramedic trying to save my life. I was out of my body so how could I be aware if there is no life after death?  

  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Uncertain.     I do not know how to explain. It has been very hard to tell as much as I have.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes.  I found out how much pain a human being can tolerate. It's probably more than most people imagine.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.  I am looking at a year of surgeries and rehabilitation. Before the experience, I would have been very bitter. Now, I feel like it will be O.K.  

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain, it has only been a few months since this happened.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I have never communicated this experience to anyone until now  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I was unconscious for two days except for very short times. The time I watched the paramedic was the only thing I remember except when I was being moved. Then, it was the pain was what I remember.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          THE CLARITY I HAD WHEN WATCHING THE PARAMEDIC. I knew he was trying to save someone's life. When I went back into my body, the pain made me aware that I was who he was working on.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain.   In 2018, I suffered  bleeding from my bowels that almost killed me. My blood pressure was 70/50 when my wife got me to the emergency room. I looked death in the face, but it was nowhere as vivid as February 19, 2021.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I believe there is no way I could have watched that without pain.  Then when I was aware of the paramedic's hands on me, the pain engulfed me and the roaring sound stopped. 

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I know I was watching myself. I spent 5 days in the hospital. The number of medical people who have told me I should be dead  astounds me.  

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain.   I do not know.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?  I don't honestly know
