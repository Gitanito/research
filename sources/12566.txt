  		              		Experience Description   

    My daughter was born with Down's Syndrome. People with Down's Syndrome are more susceptible to leukemia. She was having pain and developed spots all over her body, which is a symptom of leukemia. We took her to a doctor but the doctor misdiagnosed the problem and sent her home. A few days later we took her back to the doctor and the new doctor had a blood test done. It showed that her blood counts were wrong, which is strong evidence of leukemia. We were told to immediately take her to the hospital. One of the problems that soon arose was that she developed a bad infection (sepsis) because of the delay in diagnosis. Sepsis is sometimes called blood poisoning. Her organs started to shut down and the hospital staff had to put her on a ventilator and blood pressure medication to keep her alive. She was near death for about a week and we were warned that she may not make it. 

  After she recovered somewhat, she regained consciousness and was trying to tell me something but she couldn't speak with the ventilator in. A little while later they took the ventilator out and she was excited to tell me something. My daughter told me she had fallen asleep and saw my father, who she called 'Grampy Bob.' My father had died 7 years earlier from cancer when my daughter was 7 years old. She went on to say that Grampy Bob told her that she needed to wake up, so she did. She also went on to say that grampy Bob said that he loves you, which was a message to  me. That was surprising because my father and I had a bad relationship and he never told me or my family that he loved us. I believe this is real because my daughter has a mental age of about 7 years old and is not the type of person to lie.
