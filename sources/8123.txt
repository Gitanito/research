  		              		Experience Description   

  We had lost my beloved uncle Dan, in February 2016 after his year-long battle with Stage-4 pancreatic cancer; it would take too long to describe our history, but even as a step-uncle who was only 5 years older than me, he was dear to me from the start. I was 6 when we met, he 11 yrs old. For perspective, Dan was just past his 50th birthday when he died.
  
  Shortly after Dan died, my daughter got pregnant by a young man  named T, who was addicted to opiates. What truly hurt was his mother KNEW and did not get him help for this while he was a minor. My husband and I ensured our daughter stayed alive, well and healthy after T accidentally overdosed in May 2016. We took custody and guardianship of the baby to prevent T's mom from trying to obtain legal custody-solely because she wanted to take T's entire estate from his legal heir. On top of the legal expenses to fight all this, I was falsely accused of a violent pedophile attack by someone online because I didn't agree with his political opinion. My life spiraled out of control at this point after fighting these allegations for almost a year.  While I will not divulge the full circumstance here, on August 10th 2019 I tried to commit suicide after thinking I had ruined my marriage of 13 years.    

    I had a lot to drink this evening. I had been fighting to keep my head above water since mid-2015. While my granddaughter was the brightest blessing I could ask for, my life circumstances were bad. My husband and I had hit rock bottom. He had just walked out of our finished basement. I had been wearing my step-uncle's pancreatic bracelet and I yanked it off, thinking he'd be ashamed of me. I wanted to die and I felt unworthy to wear it. I swallowed a lot of pills, washing them down with more alcohol. I did this out in the backyard at night. It was warm and I know I at least passed out.
  
   I closed my eyes and saw a gray, cloudy-looking background. I clearly remember Danny standing in front of me laughing, like we were sharing a good joke. He said, 'Can you make yourself throw up?' I was so happy to see him! I was relaxed, happy and I laughed back at him saying, 'Of course I can. It's easy - watch!' 
  
  I don't remember vomiting. I vaguely remember leaving the lawn chair I sat in and stumbling back into the house where I slept for 12 hours. Luckily, I  had no real adverse effects from the overdose.
  
  I will also mention that my husband had also independently decided he was done with this life and went into the garage to commit suicide by shotgun. He loaded it, pulled the trigger and only got a click. The shotgun shell has a mark where the hammer hit it but did not discharge.
