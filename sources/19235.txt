what do we have any power
you ask the question what do we have
that that has come about through some of
these research projects and encounters
that are medically related a lot my
understanding is that if the
technologies that deal with regenerative
capabilities exist transdimensional that
are sequestered where you could actually
regenerate spinal column or a severed
limb and nerves things of this sort
cancer other diseases but the problem is
those use technologies that are
transdimensional what I mean by that
they use subtle
energy technologies that aren&#39;t just
kind of like acupuncture but I mean that
are electromagnetic systems that are
very very high-tech almost like an in
Star Trek where they wave a thing you
know how but that would actually work
reliably but they&#39;re - I mean you&#39;re
talking about hundreds of billions of
dollars in pharmaceutical and
conventional medical then there&#39;s
agribusiness MIDI business military
industrial complex a lot of toes would
be stepped on but also more importantly
than that is that if you open a window
into an application that&#39;s medical
related to these technologies people are
going to see the energy implications of
it and with that it&#39;s goodbye oil it&#39;s
goodbye coal so they&#39;ve been sequestered
for the same reason the energy and
propulsion technology yes I understand
from men and women I&#39;ve worked with that
there are amazing technologies that
relate to medical systems and curative
and reparative regenerative technologies
that are transdimensional electronic
systems that would just blow your mind
yeah and and so unfortunately you know
in a sense our medical system is sort of
stone-age from that point of view
yes there&#39;s medical information that can
help and one of the things I&#39;ve said
there are multiple look at this whole
issue of disclosure first there&#39;s two
basic information we&#39;re not alone in the
universe then there&#39;s the the
fundamental technology energy propulsion
and then there are all the ancillary or
associated technologies you know medical
environmental abatement ken shoulders
who is a scientist discovered charged
clusters that would under right
conditions neutralize radioactive
materials so you could take all the
radioactive wastes in the world and
neutralize it this was proven and the
Department of Energy was going to fund
the next level of it and the people in
this cabal circled their limousines and
said no you will not because it was
pulling energy from this quantum vacuum
zero point to do it I know the people
who are part of that initiative all of
them so there are so many spin-offs and
benefits of disclosure of the central
issue but that&#39;s the reason it&#39;s secret
is that the implications are so huge
it&#39;s not just the energy sector or the
transportation sector it&#39;s the medical
as the pharmaceutical it&#39;s all of it but
you know would 99.999% of humanity
benefit if it was used peacefully now
there&#39;s a big caveat if it was used
peacefully yes
the bigger question becomes as a colonel
who was the in charge of future
technologies for the Air Force and I
discussed here in DC not long ago what
if they&#39;re weaponized I said well they
already had been haven&#39;t they but
they&#39;re covertly weaponized but what if
they proliferate and are weaponized so
this gets into sort of the larger
question evolutionary question of are we
willing to go forward as a peaceful
civilization or not because we are at a
crossroads where if we don&#39;t go forward
peacefully we won&#39;t go forward at all
and it&#39;s not world peace its universal
peace its interplanetary so
one path leads to it&#39;s like the hopi
line of the Hopi prophecy rock one line
leads determination and the other one
leads forever out into the future into
the Stars we are the last generation to
make that decision we don&#39;t have another
hundred years so that&#39;s why this is so
critical career to work on this because
I came to realize once I realized what
was behind the secrecy why it&#39;s so
secret that it really doesn&#39;t matter I
can save one life at a time in the ER or
maybe three or four when I&#39;m really
dizzy but I used to have to run multiple
code blues code blues when your heart
stops but now we have the
responsibilities of the earth and all of
her children for the next thousands of
years in the in the balance hanging in
the balance so humans have been trying
to make this transition for a very very
long time and it keeps getting thwarted
by let&#39;s take all special interest
people who are hell-bent on maintaining
the status quo of the financial system
the political system whatever it is but
there has to be say a non-violent
revolution that that has to take place
I&#39;m not a violent person but I don&#39;t
think you let these the sociopaths who
have another agenda to be continued to
call the shots as they have for the last
hundred years we have to have the good
people step forward most people though
who are nice are too nice
and one thing that I found very early on
in 1992 when the head of Army
Intelligence threatened me I said
basically screw you and the horse you
rode in on you get my way you&#39;ll be in
Leavenworth federal penitentiary for the
rest of your life because I&#39;ve got
witnesses and documents that involve you
and covert illegal projects back when
you were a young officer and he went I
said you want to get on the dance floor
come on yeah I&#39;ve got a lot of stuff
that so but that&#39;s you know you I mean
that&#39;s ugly perhaps but you know I&#39;m not
gonna threaten me and get away with it
but I think that most people here&#39;s one
of the problems is that people are
either too nice or they don&#39;t have the
courage like so many of the technologies
that I know are held and by people who
are out there that we&#39;ve met with who
could bring out these technologies the
first time someone comes up to them and
goes boo they put their tail between
their legs in their run they&#39;re not
willing to take the risk now you have to
be willing to take the risk including
losing your life or you can&#39;t go
anywhere with something like this or if
they know they can put you on the run
with the least little threat of defaming
you or threatening you or what-have-you
they know they&#39;ve got you because that&#39;s
what&#39;s going to happen so the currency
that I&#39;m that owned the only currency
that matters you have to know about this
you have to have the vision of what to
do there has to be a certain fund of
knowledge and intellect is why I&#39;m sure
but when push comes to shove how much
heart courage do you have and that&#39;s
true of these medical technologies is
through the basic energy technologies
and it&#39;s true of the state of the world
so we have to find our hearts we have to
find our ability to come together so
that the good people of the earth
prevail over these sociopathic folks who
have a eschatological agenda who love
you know sort of endless war and have
the sort of the crescendo happen with
some sort of bizarre you know Armageddon
type thing now of course if they keep
fooling around they may get their wishes
because the earth isn&#39;t going to be able
to endure 7 billion people living like
we do indefinitely I mean we&#39;re you know
we have both polar ice caps melting and
the equilibrium of the earth is becoming
including the magnetic field include
increasingly
stable so this instability is going to
increase and not decrease since we stay
on the path fraud it&#39;s like the old
saying unless we change directions were
likely to end up where we&#39;re going
