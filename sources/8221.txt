  		              		Experience Description   

  I was diagnosed with endometriosis, so I needed surgery to have it removed.

   While in surgery, I remember seeing a vast amount of grass; high-grain straws in a huge meadow. I was happy beyond words and  dancing in the meadow. The sun was extremely bright, warm and safe. The color of the sun was so vivid. Yellow light spread across my face as I danced and  swayed. I don't remember hearing music. I do remember feeling extremely loved. I felt pure joy that  radiated through my skin. I have never felt these extreme emotions in my earthly life.
  
  My mom and husband said they felt worried that something happened to me because it was such a long surgery. My doctor told me that the endometriosis spread everywhere, including my bowels. In answer to a prior question, he said that hopefully, one day with the aid of drugs that I would become pregnant. I was depressed after coming back to my life. I didn't know where I went during this procedure, nor did I think a near death experience. I am not aware of any complications during the surgery. I don't remember sharing this experience with anyone until recently. People have claimed drugs from surgery made me hallucinate. I didn't entirely agree with them and after reading other people's experiences from your book (Evidence of the Aferlife), I'm almost positive I had an NDE.

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         I was uncertain if an afterlife exists.          I said it was the light that people always say when they see when they die. I felt it could be God, providing me proof of a greater life than of life on Earth.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I felt like I couldn't explain it to people. I was depressed for a week. Everyone assumed my experience happened from the surgery, but I think it was from what I felt after coming back to my earthy body.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience    

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I saw my girls before they were born. I know when someone is sick or depressed.  I feel things very often. I predict death sometimes and pregnancy. I feel emotions strongly. I want to save the world but can't. Also, the devil would attack me often in my dreams. I would get strangled, or abused from the devil. I would only wake up by screaming the name of Jesus. The dreams were real as could be. Also, I sleep with rosary beads and had a blessing not too long ago.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I think the light was a Godly light.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I only first shared this experience with my husband, mom and friend last year. They didn't quite believe me or thought it might be the drugs during surgery. I even asked an anesthesiologist and she said that people just dream. I know of no one who had a procedure that also had a dream or experience like mine.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I kept playing it over and over in my mind and knew it was real. This was nothing from an earthy imagination.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I read your book and was crying. For years I didn't know what the experience was. I knew I wasn't crazy. I just couldn't find much information on my experience. I now know from others; it was what I thought! God and God's love.  
  
Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

  Did the questions asked and information that you provided accurately and comprehensively describe your experience?         Uncertain.     I would like to hear other people and their experiences.
