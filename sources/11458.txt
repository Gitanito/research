  		              		Experience Description   

    I had bronchial pneumonia. My family was advised to rush me to hospital immediately. Before that, I remember not being able to stand without being dizzy. When rushed to the hospital, my mother had me wrapped in a blanket and was hysterical. We got into the car with  me in her arms, wrapped up like a cocoon. I could not see anything. 

  All of a sudden, I was looking out the windshield that was behind me. 'That is impossible,' I thought to myself. I then spoke to myself in a adult voice, and told myself, 'I guess it's time to go back,' and I felt comfortable with my decision. Then I said in same voice, 'No, it would make my mom cry.' 

  I realized years later that I had likely died in the car. I remember nothing after that. Also in 1984, in a dream I was shot. I left my body in the dream, went to a dark place and felt so protected I did not want to leave. Then, I saw a dim light that looked like it was a million miles away. In a second, the light  shot up to me. It  scared me to death.  I woke up, trying to catch my breath. It was a dream, not a near death experience. But it was the most real and not forgotten dream that I ever had.
