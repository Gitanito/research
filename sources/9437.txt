  		              		Experience Description   

    That summer when I was 21 years old I went with several friends to somewhere in Jinshan bay in Taipei to swim and BBQ. We are a group of boys and girls. Immediately after we had arrived at our destination, everybody was setting up the BBQ by the creek. Right there, one of the boys suggested that we go swimming in the creek first. However I thought we should grill the meat first then went for a swim afterward, but the majority of the boys had gone already so I thought as a boy I should go for it, too. Thus I went along.   

  There were two girls by the grill to prepare the BBQ. I felt sorry for them though. I wished I had not gone swimming, however it turned out to be a memorable experience that I could never forget. In fact, I did not know how to swim. I could only play in the water let alone swim. Once everyone was in the water, they all showed off their swimming skills such as breaststroke, supine, and silent swimming. Some of them would even go further to climb up on the rocks then jump off it. I knew I could not swim so I stayed in the shallow water side. However, they went even further to the deep water and I was catching up with them for competition sake. But the further I swam the more I was intimidated. At this moment, I could not reach the bottom of the water, and it was too late to turn back. The rush of the water brought me down deeper into the water. I thought I was doomed this time. The water kept bringing me deep down. I fought to swim against the current upward but I was drowned by the water. I could not swim out of it to reach the surface.  

  As I struggled in the water for a while, I heard my heartbeat become slower and slower.  It was so quiet in the water that you could hear your own heartbeat.  Momentarily right after the last heartbeat, I was sucked upward by a force or in other word it was like being squeezed out of it. I found out I was floating approximately one to two floors of a high rise building above the water. That instant, I was perplexed. I found myself had no body floating. Immediately I felt strange how this happened that I was bodiless and feeling light weighted. While I was floating up in the air I saw two of my classmates were on the surface. The way I watched them was like zoomed in on a camera. There was something in the water that looked like it was me. Feeling unsure as I thought, then I realized that I had died? Right at this moment, my surroundings turned pitch dark, and a light appeared in front of me. It seemed like a tunnel which was the entrance of the reincarnation in the spiritual world.  

  I was pushed forwards by a force. The whole process felt weightless, while I looked at my right hand and it was hand-shaped except for the edges of it were illuminated with transparent, blue light. I thought I must have died.  I could feel a sheet of soft, white surroundings in this realm. There were ancient Chinese Palace stairs where on top of it was a bronze mirror and its size was bigger than TV cabinet. The edge of the copper mirror was decorated with a flower pattern in a Chinese Palace style. There was a force that pushed me in front of this mirror then put me down. I watched myself from the mirror and I saw myself had a head-shaped image illuminating with bright, blue light. Then, the bronze mirror projected my life from young to adulthood at a super high speed, which was playing hundreds to thousands of my life experiences in about 1 to 2 seconds.  

  When my life review was completed, that force lifted me up, detoured the bronze  mirror and continued on forwarding. While I was moving forward, a picture appeared behind my head. It was a lady with black dress lying on her stomach on a rock by the creek, crying sobering. As the force pushed me forwards further, the louder the lady crying in the picture. I could feel that this picture tried to tell me “Are you sure you won't regret?”  And I knew that once I passed the bright light then I could never come back anymore.  

  So I was telling myself that, “No, if I left, my parents would be weeping and sad. No, I have to come back.” Next, I made a left turn and broke away from that force. I looked back and found out it was the dark tunnel that I had entered into previously. In a flash, a force sucked me over.  I was back and was able to feel the flesh again. However, I was still in the bottom of the water, I thought as for me it was not an easy journey to come back (the earth) so I would not want to go back there again. Surprisingly, I never knew how I had learned to tread water. But since I continued doing so I finally reached the surface. Once I was on top of the water, my classmates seemed to notice that I was drowning and they pushed me from the deep water to the shallow water. Eventually, I was on shore. (I would like to share with more people.)   

  The above contents are all true and definitely not superstition. My own experience.
