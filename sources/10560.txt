I saw four people - three men and a woman.  One of the men was in white uniform and I knew the woman according to her clothes. They put me on a litter (ambulance litter) and they pushed it running through a passage for hours, then we arrived to the end of the way. I saw a light. I told them this is was my first time to get a breathing failure and you didn't take me younger brother in spite of that he is an asthma case for fourteen years, so please let me go back.
