A REPORT ON A SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH
MR. WILLY SCHNEIDER.
Edited by E. J. Dingwall.
INTRODUCTION.
(1) Prelimhstary.
The following report deals with a series of sittings con-
ducted by the Society with the Austrian medium Mr.
Willy Schneider, in the months of November and Decem-
ber, 1924. Mr. Schneider is probably the most distin-
guished of modern continental physical mediums. His
mediumship was developed early in life, and having had
a long series of sittings with Baron von Schrenck-Notzing,
he was soon accustomed to that measure of severe control
which^^. so necessary in experiments of this nature. One
of th earliest references to his mediumship, accompanied
by il~astrations which profess to give examjoles of his
alleged teleplastic phenomena, is to be found in von
Schrenck's Materialisations-Phaenomem (2® Aufl. 1923,
pp. 548-602, Abb. 240-244. Cf. Eng. Tr. 1920, p. 335,
figs. 221-225). Telekinesis, however, soon became the
2 E. J. Dingwall. [part
principal feature of his mediumship, although it is said
that the movements of objects were caused by teleplastic
structures proceeding from the body, some of which were
occasionally visible. Early accounts of these sittings were
pubUshed by von Schrenck in his Physikalische Phaeno-
mene der Mediumismus (Miinchen, 1920), pp. 102 £f. and a
full detailed survey of his later sittings in Experimente
der Fernbetveg^mg (Stuttgart, 1924) which includes the
examination of the medium by tke Psychological Institute
of the University of Munich.^
After leaving Baron von Schrenck, Schneider went to
Vienna where he lived with Dr. E. Holub, the head of a
large asylum at Steinhof, where a series of sittings was
held. On February 15, 1924, Dr. Holub died suddenly,
but Schneider continued living under the same roof as
his widow, who moved from Steinhof into the city. Here
more sittings were held and a number of scientific mem-
bers of the University invited to attend. Mr. Schneider
is not a professional medium, and prefers to sit under
conditions permitting proper control, laid down by the
investigators. I was. much impressed when I saw his
work in Munich in 1922 2 and had long wished for the
opportunity of seeing more of him. Late in 1924 the
opportunity arose, and the Society sent a cordial invita-
tion to Mr. Schneider and Mrs. Holub to visit England
and hold a few sittings. The invitation was accepted
and towards the middle of November they arrived in
England, where they remained until December 14.
(2) The Seance Room.
The room in which the seances were conducted was the
Society's own laboratory, which is divided from the rest
of the house by a small ante-room and washin|>^^ place.
All account of the room was published in the Jou\ il for
December 1924, p. 342, which we herewith reprint i, )r the
convenience of the reader, together with a photograph

by its publication in Proceedings S.P.R., 1924, XXXIV., 324-332. .

of the room to which the account refers. A plan was
published in the Journal for November 1923, p. 151. The
room measures 17 ft. x 14 ft. and in the photograph will
be seen at the extreme right, the note-taker's chair, and
in front of it, is the note-taker's table, on which are two
rheostats for the central inverted bowl lights and a box
for taking notes, internally illuminated through ruby glass.
A little to the front and to the left of the table is the
gramophone, and behind it, a camera on tripod. Above
the camera and to the right are two black switches, a
maximum and minimum thermometer, and, just above,
a double lamp bracket, with one of the bulbs enclosed
in a ruby shade. A similar attachment can be seen
on the left hand wall and both of these brackets are
controlled separately by sliding rheostats, one of which
can be seen a little beneath and to tlie left of the
thermometer. Each rheostat is fitted with a sliding scale
attachment.
The cabinet curtains are black satin and slide on rollers
along a bow-shaped bar from corner to corner. Just
within the cabinet can be seen the medium's chair in the
centre, a little table for experiments, and in the ceiling-
one of the hooks for suspending scales. In front of the
cabinet stands the magnesium light apparatus, which is
smokeless and adjustable.
The inverted bowl fitting, suspended from the ceiling
just by the air grid, has been specially designed for this
room and provides upward and downward motion, the
bowl itself being detachable by means of two bayonet
catches. Within the bowl, which is enamelled white
inside, are four lamps on a separately-wired double series,
two being of ruby glass and two of white glass, and all
controlled at three different points in the room.
Just behind the arm-chair to the left is the sliding
shutter which covers the window and effectually excludes
light. Heating is provided by a couple of electric radia-
tors, one of which can be seen behind the note-taker's
table. As fresh air enters, stale air is drawn out through
the central grid in the ceiling by means of an electric fan
outside the room.
4 E. J. Dingwall. [part
In the present series, owing to tlie fact that the medium
preferred the same arrangements to which lie M^as accus-
tomed in Vienna, the chair in the cabinet was removed,
and a settee with a blue cover was substituted for it.
This settee was placed against the back wall, one end
coming up to the left hand waU (as seen in the photo-
graph) and the other being just on a level with the right
hand curtain seen hanging behind the tripod. This cur-
Fig. 1.
tain was drawn in such a manner that its edge hung on
a level with the front edge of the end of the settee on
that side. (See fig. 1) Cl and C2 are the chairs of the
controllers who exercised the control to be described later.
L is a tripod upon which stood a snake lampstand with
shaded ruby bulb controlled by a rheostat from the note-
taker's table ; H is Mrs. Holub's seat, whilst the observers
were grouped round the table which stood in front of the
settee and usually about 6 ins. distant from it. This

table, over which was thrown a large black cloth, measured
2 ft. 10 ins. X 1 ft. 8 ins. x 2 ft. 2^ ins. Around the
table as seen by the plan, was placed a black gauze screen
or fence 2 ft. high, which cut off the possibility of the
observers' feet and legs touching the table. On the right,
directly in front of the note-taker's table (NTT) stood
another table (Ta), on which were j)l^ced the various
pieces of apparatus used during the sittings. These were
usually under the control of the observer seated in the
last right hand chair of the arc facing the wall, and will
be described in their place.
(3) Control and General Conditions.
The control of the medium was substantially the same
as that to whiph he has always been accustomed. As
Mr. Schneider is primarily a medium for telekinesis and
has his limbs fully under the control of the observers, no
detailed bodily examination was necessary. As a general
rule before each seance the medium entered the laboratory
with two of the observers,^ and there changed his clothes
excepting socks and shoes, being reclothed in a suit of
pyjamas and dressing jacket which were his own property,
but which were left in the laborator}^ durmg the whole
period of his visit to the Society. He was then led by
the hands to his place (M) on the settee which was at
the extreme corner on the left, viewed from in front, and
opposite to him were the two chairs destuied for the con-
troUers. These faced the note-taker's table, the medium's
hands bemg grasped obliquely, the thumbs and the fore-
part of the hand b}'' the controller nearer him (Dr. WooUey)
and the ends of the fingers by the next controller (Mr.
Dingwall). His legs were either extended under the side
rungs of the first controller's chak-, or one was extended
thus whilst the other was j)laced in front of the chair,
although at all times behind the two legs of Dr. Woolley
who sat at right angles to him. Ai'ound the medium's
wrists and ankles were luminous bands, and on certain
^In the present series invariably Dr. V. J. Woolley and Mr. E. J.
Dingwall.
6 E. J. Dingwall. [PAR'C
occasions to be described later, luminous pins were also
employed.
Mrs. Holub occupied tlie chair immediately next to Mr.
Dingwall's chair (C2) and in close proximity to the lamp
(L), the rays from which illuminated the space between
her and the table (T). During the seances her right hand
was held by the sitter on the right, and her left, the
wrist surrounded by a luminous band, rested on Mr.
Dingwall's right arm. The sitter occupying the extreme
light of the arc, and whose duty it was to arrange the
apparatus as required, also wore luminous wrist bands
round both wrists, his left hand Avhen not in use being
held during the seances by the sitter next to him on his
left. The note-taker (Mrs. E. J. Dingwall), noted the
times at which phenomena occurred and any other infor-
mation which it was thought desirable to record. The
accounts of the seances that follow are the contemporary
records, supplemented only by observations and corrections
made by members of the committee during the meetings
usually held after each seance to discuss the results.
It was also the duty of the note-taker to be in entire
charge of the lights, both the main lighting of the room
and the ruby lamp on the front of the table, all of which
were controlled by rheostats on her table, Similarly she
managed the gramophone when it was wanted, changing
the records and attending to the winding. There was no
special committee appointed for the investigation : persons
were invited as seemed desirable, but Mrs. Holub, Mrs.
J. G. Robertson,^ Dr. V. J. WooUey and Mr. and Mrs.
Dingwall attended all the sittings throughout the series.
Later Mr. W. H. Salter became a permanent sitter,
and to him fell the task of arranging the apparatus
a]id occupying the seat at the extreme right of the arc.
The position of the other sitters is indicated in the
report.
It can hardly be denied that the phenomena occurring
in the presence of Mr. Schneider have been diminishing,
^ Mrs. Robertson, who is a member of the Societj', was, owing to her
thorough Icnowledge of German, of the greatest assistance in communicating
with tlio mocliuui and Mrs. Holulj.

both in quality and quantity within recent years. There
is nothmg hke the range and power which v/ere noticeable
in 1922 and even later. The phenomena are weaker and
negative sittuigs more common. Such sittings in Vienna
are. not unusual, and although naturally phenomena occa-
sionally occur which are starthng and rarely repeated, the
phenomena observed, with a few exceptions are similar
to those seen in London. The medium and Mrs. Holub
expressed their approval both of the methods of inquiry
and the general arrangements which had been made for
their comfort and convenience.
The only phenomena clearly observed were telekinetic, and
even these were only striking upon a few occasions, which will
be described in the detailed record. On November 15 and
18, vague shapes were seen silhouetted against an object
which moved immediately afterwards, but these shapes were
too fleeting and shadowy to admit any justification for the
assumption that they were teleplastic structures engaged in
telekinesis.
Within recent years the demand of the medium (through
his control. Otto) for music and noise during the pro-
duction of phenomena has become increasingly insistent,
and accordingly the gramophone was played and con-
versation was kept up during almost the entire course
of the sittings except at the commencement of each
when the medium was falling mto trance. The noise so
caused was an unpleasant feature of the sittings, but
it may be said that its occurrence in no way weakened
the vigilance of the controllers during the production
of phenomena. The trance with this medium usually
comes within a few muxutes of the white light being
turned off. Respiration increases, and the head usually
sinks down on the hands of the nearer of the two
controllers. The hands at the same time begin to tremble,
and this trembling motion continues almost without
intermission from the beginning of the sittmg until the
end. During the production of the phenomena the res-
piration increases in short barking breaths, and while
telekinesis is in progress the body often stiffens, and
up and down movements of the hands occur synchro-
8 E. J. Dingwall. [part
nously Math similar movements of objects at a distance
from the medium. The sittings usually lasted from two
to three hours, termination bemg arranged by the control,
who says that nothing more will occur, or that the power
is low, etc. They were almost always in two parts, the
time of commencement of the second part being fixed by
the control before the medium had come out of trance
at the conclusion of the first. At the end of the sitting
the medium again changed his clothes under supervision,
and when thought necessary the hair, mouth, etc., were
examined. Had the phenomena been teleplastic in charac-
ter the control would have been of a much more severe
type ; as it was, a detailed bodily examination was unne-
cessary, as the possibility of using concealed apparatus
during the sitting was rendered so extremely improbable
that the feasibility of the medium doing so would have
to be practically demonstrated before being seriously
considered.^ A further item in the control was a black
gauze inclosure which had been built for the purpose of
holding objects which had to be moved telekinetically.
This structure measured 4 ft. 8 ins. high, 2 ft. 8 ins.
wide and 2 ft. 8 ins. deep. A door provided with holes for
tapes, which were afterwards sealed, closed one side, whilst
on the other was an opening in the gauze extending the
width of the side with the exception of an edge of 3 ins.
at either side, and 12| ins. deep, the top edge being
llf ins. from the top. The inclosure was built for con-
taining a light wood table covered by a black cloth, on
which were placed various pieces of apparatus as described
in the records. ^ When in use the opening in the inclosure
was on the side away from the observers and at right
angles to the medium, and the object of the arrangement
was that a straight line between the medium's head and
the experimental objects should pass through the gauze and
not through the window. Lines from the medium's head
to the window and from the window to the objects on
the table formed an obtuse angle.
The lighting dixring the seances, as already stated, was by

means of the ruby lamp (L) controlled by a rheostat on
the note-taker's table. The light was sufficient to illumine
the space immediately opposite Mrs. Holub and was
lowered and raised as desired by the medium duruig the
sittings.
In the reports which follow we shall omit for the sake
of brevity all the technical details of seance management
which were faithfully carried out, but which have so far
as can be seen no bearing upon the phenomena. Such
details include observation of the variation of temperature
of the seance room, which never changed beyond what
would be considered normal limits ; barometric pressure
;
measurements of the degrees of light used ; etc. They
form part of the Society's official records but are not
printed, as from the practical point of view they are but
of little value to the student.
Detailed Account of the Sittings.
Twelve sittings in all were held on November, 12, 15,
18, 21, 25, 28 ; December 2, 5, 6, 9, 12 and 13. Of these
eight can be considered positive and four negative.
We print below the detailed, contemporary records of
some of the positive sittings. The records of the negative
sittings are omitted for reasons of space and are of little
interest to any but the most painstaking and careful
student of mediumistic environment and other factors.
If any such person desires to consult the original documents
he should make application to the Society.
A selection of pieces was played on the gramophone
during the sittings. The word " music " has been sub-
stituted for the name of the piece as it occurs in the
original documents, and the sitters are named in order,
beginning with the nearer of the two controllers. Dr.
Woolley and then continuing round the arc. During
the intervals between the parts of the sitting, the medium,
Mrs. Holub and the observers left the seance room,
except that occasionally one or two remained behind with
Dr. Woolley or myself for the purpose of inspecting more
closely the arrangements for control.

Sitting II.
November 15, 1924 , .
On the table, around which the gauze fence described
on page 5 had not been placed, were three luminous
cardboard strips, each strip approximately 25.5 cm. long,
and 3 cm. wide and weighing 14 grm. One strip {A) was
placed parallel with the end of the table nearest the
medium and at about 2.5 cm. from the edge, and another
(C) in the same position with reference to the further end.
The third strip {B) was placed parallel with the side
furthest from the observers and at about the same dis-
tance from the edge as the first two strips. A small
luminous aluminium hand-bell weighing 28 grm. and a
tambourine partly painted with lummous paint and fur-
nished with 5 cymbals, with a diameter of 24.2 cm. and
weighing 2.8 hg. were also used.

At this sitting the movements of the handkerchief and
the strip of cardboard were very curious. We cannot
consider the movements of the table or tlie cool breeze
to be in any way evidential as the movements could, in our
opinion, have been caused by the medium's head, and the
existence of currents of air ia the seance room, due
perhaps to the revolving fan outside the room sucking the
air from the grid in the roof, is so probable that no
stress can be laid upon these sensations of moving air.
They are mentioned because they occixrred, and not because
w^e consider them in any sense evidence of supernormal
action. Certainly at times it seemed that the currents of
air were too strong to be due to normal causes, but at
no time did the thermometer readings show any decrease
during the sittings which could be considered abnormal.

The phenomena at this sittmg ceiitered mainly around
tiic tambovuine, table, istrips and handkerchief. The
tinkling of the cymbals of the tambourine cannot, we
think, be regarded seriously as demanding the hypothesis
of the supernormal. The levitation of the strip at
10.35 p.m. was impressive as was also the levitation of
the tambourine a minute later. Similarly the second levita-
tions of the strips at 10.37 p.m. and 10.39 p.m. were
remarkable. The cardboard hung horizontally in the air
slightly shivering as it floated. The hand control was
perfect, but it is unfortunate that some method of head
control could not have been carried out successfully,
although we cannot think that any device could have been
employed by the mouth for moving the strip. The strip
nearest the medium was about 17 ins. [43 cm.] distant
from his hands as they lay on his lap under the control
of W. and D. It appeared noi'mally impossible for his
head to reach to the strip without making a twisting
movement which Avould have been immediately apparent
to his controllers.
SlTTINC4 VI.
November 28, 1924.
This was the most remarkable sittiiag of the series.
The luminous strijDs were in use as usual, and in addition
the medium asked for a luminous cardboard ring which
had been prepared. It was about 12.5 cm. in diameter
and 1.5 cm. wide. A zither, partly painted with luminous
paint was also employed, but no j^henomena resulted from
its use. The gauze fence had been fitted with a third
side enclosing the end of the table opposite Mr. Salter.

seconds before again coming to rest, and, when levitated,
no portion of the complete luminous surface appeared to
be obscured by any supporting structure sucli as I had
noticed with the same medium in Munich. The distance
of tlie ring from the medium's hands was approximately
3 ft. [90 cm.], and it was normally impossible to reach it
with his head under the conditions obtaining at the sitting.

the sitters was the eminent magician, Mr. Douglas Dexter
(Marks) who liad been appointed by the Occult Committee
of the Magic Circle as its representative upon the invita-
tion of Dr. V. J. Woolley. Mr. Dexter has a special
knowledge of subtle devices, and his inability to suggest
any normal method for producing the phenomena he
observed is to be noted with interest. For those who
may wish to know something of the measurements of the
various objects connected with the sittings we append the

Little comment is necessary regarding this sitting. The
observers are agreed that they are unable to suggest any
normal explanation of the levitation of the objects, and
in this connexion part of the notes of Mr. Dexter may
prove interesting. He writes :
I measured the distance between the objects on the
table and the nearest position into which the medium, by
leaning over towards the left, could get his head and
mouth. It was not less than 23 ins. [57 cm.], and to
get as near as this would entail a great strain and a very
uncomfortable position for the medium. So far as I
could see he did not release his hands or feet at all during
the seance. Apart from the most efficacious control, I
was in a position to detect any movement of the arms or
legs. Madame [Holub] never moved from her position
throughout the sitting. None of the sitters could, by
direct contact, have reached the objects placed on the
table without instant detection. So far, I know of no
form of reaching-rod or similar implement that could
have been used by the medium under the conditions
obtaining.
In discussing the facts which tend to support the
supernormal hypothesis he mentions " the extremely light,
delicate movements of the ring. During its levitation it
literally hovered in the air like a snow-flake. There
were no jerks or shiftings, and it was not gripped or held
rigidly."

Sitting VIIT.
December, 5, 1924.
At this sitting the gauze enclosure or cage was employed
further to isolate the objects to be moved. This structure
has already been described on page 8. In the cage was
a plain square deal table, 2 ft. 6| ins. (76 cm.) high
covered by a green cloth. The door was tied with string
and sealed with leaden seals. The distance of the wall
of the cage from the wall of the room on the medium's
side was 2 ft. 4| ms. (72 cm.) and from the back wall
2 ft. 2| ins. (66 cm.). The nearest point of the opening
in the back to the medium's hands when controlled in
their normal position was 2 ft. 1 in. (62.5 cm.) and the
distance from his hands to the centre of the table 2 ft.
4 ins. (70 cm.). (See plate II.) The following is the

The only phenomena of importance at this sitting were
the movements of the tambourine within the cage as
described in the report. Dr. C. G. Lamb of the Engineer-
ing Laboratory, Cambridge describes the phenomena in
detail in a letter to Mr. Stratton, dated December 24,
1924. He divides the phenomena into two classes, of
which the second can again be sub-divided. We have {a)
occasional tinklings of the tambourine, very audible, and
on occasi(Mis almost contiruious, and {b) the motion of the
same which consisted of (1) a rolling motion about its
horizontal axis and (2) a turning motion across its vertical
axis. From his position Dr. Lamb could observe the
rolling motion better than the turning, which was more
visible from the positions occupied by W. and D. From
its original position the tambourine rolled about 20° after
slight oscillations, the action being as if the roll were
stopped by one of tlie cymbals on the tambourine pre-
venting its completion. It then made a turn of about
the same amount and then rolled back a little. In
summing up the normal possibilities of this imparting
motion to the tambourine. Dr. Lamb observes that " the
only peojde who could have moved the object were (1)
Mr. W. H. Salter after freeing his right hand of its wrist-
let and (2) the medium by means of fine threads previously
97.] Sittings with Mr. Willy Schneider. 31
attached to the tambourine and activated by his mouth."
A thread on the cloth would not answer the purpose, since it
was observed that the luminous strips did not move ; that
is to say the tambourine moved independently of the cloth.
Mr. F. J. M. Stratton (Fellow and Tutor of Gonville
and Caius College, Cambridge) in a letter dated December
31, 1924, discussing the possibility of Mr. Salter producing
the phenomena, says that his impression is that during
the occurrences " both of Salter's hands were holding my
right hand," but he admits that Mr. Salter was the best
placed to produce the movements. Unless we assume that
the medium has the power of influencing normal persons
to act abnormally at seances it is difficult to explain the
occurrences normally.
The supposition that Mr. W. H. Salter (Hon. Treasurer
of the Society for Psychical Research) was responsible for
the movements, we can scarcely be expected to discuss
seriously, and the possibility that the medium had attached
threads to the tambourine can be completely dismissed.
We have now given an account of representative sittings
with Mr. Schneider. On December 6 and 9 attempts
were made by the medium to levitate himself completely
into the air, a phenomenon reported to have occurred in
Vienna. This attempt failed, however, and the account
of what occurred need not therefore be printed here.
It only remains to sum up our conclusions on the phenomena
considered as a whole.
Conclusions.
In considering the nature of the phenomena described
above we shall confine ourselves to the movements of the
various objects placed upon the table near the medium.
The movements of the table may conceivably have been
effected by the medium's head, and no doubt it is possible
that skilfully directed air currents, after the manner of
the production of smoke rmgs, or even actual blowing,
may have caused the tinkling of the cymbals on the
tambourine. Certainly at times the loudness of these
tinklings and the regularity of the sound did not seem to
support this hypothesis and there is no direct evidence
32 E. J. Dingicall. [part
in its favour. Evidence of the supernormal character of
these movements is, however, also lacking, and thus the
incidents remain unexplained.
The levitation of the rhig and the strips belongs to an
entirely different class of phenomena. The objections that
can be made against these phenomena are that :
{a) They did not occur at all.
(6) They did not occur as described.
{(:) They occurred, but through the normal action either
of the medium, or Mrs. Holub, or one or both
the controllers, or owe of the sitters.
.Now of these three objections («) prcsup2:)oses the occur-
rence of collective hallucination in the witnesses, and such
a collective hallucination of a body of normal persons
without their knowledge or consent has itself to be
demonstrated. We cannot prove it did not occur,
neither can the objector begin his argument that it did,
until he has shown that it has ever occurred in similar
circumstances. Certaiiily it is easy to imagine the inde-
pendent movement of a luminous object in a dark room.
But on the occasions when the ring or strip was levitated
the observers (a) were able to compare this movement
with the immobility of the other luminous objects on the
table, and (6) all agreed that the actual movement of the
levitated object was wholly different from the apparent
waverings of the luminous appearances due to eye-strain
and similar causes. Thus the first objection can, we
thmk, be dismissed.
The second objection, namely that they did not occur
as described, is impossible to meet unless the objector
states precisely in what ways the movements could have
taken place other than those described by the observers.
Such observations assume a laxity of control which in
fact did not exist, and other unwarranted assumptions
which are ruled out by the actual conditions obtaining at
the sittings.
The third objection concerns itself with possible trickery
on the part of the medium. Now in order to discuss
this, the only basis upon which we can argue is that the
levitation of the luminous objects must have been per-
97.] Sittings witJi, Mr. WiJhj Schneider. 33
formed by use of the medium's mouth. Use of the hands
and feet is definitely exckided by the conditions of control.
In order to raise an object 2 to 3 ft. distant from him,
the medium must have had concealed in his mouth an
extensible apparatus workable by the mouth alone and by
this means have supported a flat object lying on the table
and raise it into the air from below. This feat must
have been accomplished without any obvious interference
with his breathing or speech ; and when completed the rod
must have been in some inexphcable manner withdrawn and
again concealed in the mouth.i We frankly do not believe
such a device exists, and therefore are driven to the con-
clusion that the only reasonable hypothesis which covers
the facts is that some supernormal agency produced the
results. We are fully prepared to abandon this hypothesis
if contrary evidence is offered. In taking this attitude
we have dismissed the other part of the objection which
would attribute fraudulent manipulation to Mrs. Holub
or to one or more of the sitters. During the phenomena
Mrs. Holub's right hand was firmly held by the sitter
on her right, and her left, with the wrist surrounded
by a luminous band, was on Mr. Dingwall's right
arm. The space in front of her was the best lighted in
the room and her form could almost always be seen as a
silhouette by the note-taker. For producing the results
she was in the worst position of any sitter, and under the
conditions, we do not beheve that her confederacy can be
entertained as a reasonable supposition. With regard to
the other sitters, the extreme improbability of their col-
lusion with the medium will be obvious. Thus our results
with Mr. Schneider agree with those already obtained by
Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing and the Psychological Depart-
ment of the University of Munich. In all three cases
phenomena were observed which appeared normally inex-
plicable, and it must be remembered that in the two
former cases the phenomena were far finer in quality and
more striking in effect whilst the control conditions were
at least as satisfactory as the}^ were in our sittings.
^ There are other methods available, but we do not propose detailing
them here. They all presuppose the use of the mouth.

LUMINOUS AND OTHER PHENOMENA OBSERVED
WITH THE MEDIUM JANUSZ FRONCZEK.
Edited by V. J. Woolley and E. J. Dingwall.
INTRODUCTION.
The first point of contact that Mr. Janusz Fronczek had
with the Societ}^ was on August 31, 1923, when Mr.
Dingwall had a sitting with him in Warsaw, Poland.
Another sitting was arranged on September 3 and a third
the following day. The phenomena presented by Mr.
Fronczek are mainly of three kinds : telekmetic, teleplastic,
and luminous. In Warsaw only the alleged teleplastic
phenomena and lights were observed. Of these two classes
the latter were far the more curious, and we believe they
are in many respects unique. At any rate Mr. Dingwall
deemed them worthy of further attention, and attempts
were made to persuade Mr. Fronczek to visit this country
as the guest of the Society. This was finally arranged,
and he arrived in London on April 17, 1925, leaving it
on May 20, we think.
Mr. Fronczek is a young Polish mining engineer, and
alleged supernormal phenomena occurring in his presence
have been reported for some years by various observers.
In 1924 he was accused of producing phenomena by fraud,
^
and from what we have been able to ascertain there were
some grounds for this charge. This fact, however, did not
deter us from making an independent inquiry, as the
luminous appearances observed by Mr. Dingwall on August
31, 1923, warranted careful attention, if only to discover
the exact method by which they were produced. These
phenomena resembled the appearance a green pea would
have if it can be imagined as possessing a minute electric

pocket bulb, the size of a wheat grain, concealed within it.
At Warsaw the lights always appeared to come from the
mouth and to remain apparently unsupported in space two or
three inches from the lips. The brilliancy of each appearance
varied, not only as compared with others but apparently
in itself when still in view. This remarkable phenomenon
of a light which increased in brilliance and then grew dim
seemed so difficult to account for normally that it was
agreed that a vigilant attention might be fruitful in
elucidating its nature.
The Present Investigation.
The present investigation was conducted on similar lines
to that already described with Mr. Schneider. The same
room was used, and the chair seen on Plate I (of the
Schneider report) was that selected by the medium for the
sittings.
Before each sitting the medium entered the seance room
with the two controllers, who, as before, were Dr. V. J.
WooUey and Mr. E. J. Dingwall. There he disrobed
entirely and offered himself unreservedly for examination.
He then put on fresh clothes, which, after the first few
sittings, consisted of a pyjama suit and other garments,
which were left on the premises and examined before and
after every sitting. His ears, nose, mouth, hair, and
beard were examined, and then led by the two hands he
took his place in his chair. The observers then came in from
the ante-room, the medium's right hand being retained by
Dr. WooUey and the left held by Mr. Dingwall. Dr. WooUey
controlled the right foot and Mr. DingwaU placed his
stockinged right foot over the toe of the medium's left
shoe.i The same arrangements as regards note-taking ob-
tained as before, Mrs. Dingwall acting as note-taker and
controlling the lights, which consisted of two 20 Watt
frosted bulbs in photographic ruby shades within the
opaque inverted bowl seen in Plate I (opposite p. 2).
These lamps were controlled by one rheostat on the note-

taker's table, and were raised or dimmed as required or
thought necessary. Generally speakmg the medium soon
fell into what is claimed to be trance, and from then
until the end of the sitting remained passive and silent,
nor did any attempts to get into touch with the Control
greatly succeed. The medium prefers silence or low
conversation during the sitting. At times he was subject
to loud and prolonged fits of coughing which were often
disturbing, and vigorous grinding of the teeth often seemed
to precede the production of phenomena.
Detailed Account of the Sittings.
Nine sittings were held in all, on April 20, 24, 27, May
1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19. Of these, those on April 24,
May 1 and 12 were positive. The number of negative
sittings is noteworthy, and the small proportion of positive
sittings greatly increases the difificulty of interpreting the
phenomena. We print below the full report of the three
positive sittings, and again, as in the case of Mr. Schneider,
omit those details of seance management which at present
appear to have no bearing upon the phenomena.

Note by Mr. Dingwall.
" The phenomena at this sitting were very curious.
The luminous objects on the floor had been approved by
the medium, who said that telekinetic phenomena occa-
sionally occurred in his presence. Now, when the bell
moved both hands and both feet were fully under control.
It was immediately clear that if fraudulent the movement
must have been executed through the agency of the
medium's mouth. It was manifestly impossible that he
'could have actually reached the bell with his mouth, and
therefore the movement (if not supernormal) would seem
to have been performed by something in the medium's
mouth which could extend a considerable distance from
it. The control excluded the introduction of any such
large object, and therefore the problem resolved itself into
the use of the cushion for this purpose.
Now, practice will eventually teach the observer how to
interpret slight movements in the dark. If he knows
what possible avenues to trickery are open, he will
be able to appreciate movements in connection with
such trickery which would be meaningless without pre-
cise knowledge as to the possibilities. In the present
instance I knew the moment that the bell moved that
it was either the cushion or something entirely new and
possibly supernormal. Therefore I awaited the movements
in the left hand and body whicli would presumably occur
when the cushion was again replaced behiiid the medium's
head. The preparations for the second attempt were clear
and highly instructive, for the cushion had this time to
be employed for moving objects in front of the medium.
97.j Luminous and other Phenomena. 39
Therefore I was not surprised that at 10.52 p.m. the
medium pushed back his chair and did so again at 10.56.
Movements then took place similar to those before the
production of the first phenomenon, and at 11 p.m. I
thought that the bell had been knocked over. At 11.5
p.m. I was conscious of further preparations, and at
ll.G p.m. the soft object (i.e. cushion) touched my knee.
Then the ring moved, and then the medium raised his head
rapidly as I could feel by the pull of his hand as the
cushion was brought up and replaced. At the conclusion
of the sitting the fringe of the cu.shion on the left hand
side was wet with saliva and much crumpled, thus pro-
viding additional evidence of the probability of the hypo-
thesis outlined above."
The importance of the above incident is greater than
would be supposed at first sight. Apart altogether from
the brilliance of the trick viewed from the standpoint of
the artist in legerdemain, the episode provides a useful
lesson to observers.
Mr. Dingwall was the only sitter who remembered the
existence of the cushion as a possible piece of apparatus.
To the rest of us it was present as a part of the chair,
and was in effect outside our observational field, and
though the movements of objects did not seem to us to
be of a supernormal character we were completely unable
to account for them.

Observers' Notes to Sitting IV.
G. states that between 9.55 and 10.5 p.m. M. took his
hands and drew him towards him. G. stood and saw
that M.'s head was bent forward and he saw a bright
bluish light, the size of a pea, in the nape of M.'s neck.
W. is of the opinion that the lights he saw were of
two distinct types :
1. A small bright type which was itself a source
of light.
2. Illuminated pa.tches on the surface of the
pyjamas due to the incidence of light from another
source. These were bigger and less defined than (1).
R. agrees with this and thinks that (1) were bluish in
colour.
Control of head, liair, and mouth before M. left his
chair.
May 7, 1925.
As indicated in Dr. Woolley"s note the lights seen at
this sitting were apparently of two kinds, and certainly
they seemed to vary in brilliancy. The flashes which were
seen at intervals were merely the sudden appearance and
97.] Luminous and other Phenomena. 43
disappearance of moving lights which seemed to originate
from the medium's mouth. It appeared to us that the
movements of the lights always corresponded to move-
ments of the medium's head, and J\Ir. Dingwall had the
same impression as he received at Warsaw, namely, that
the lights were about 1 to 2 inches in distance from the
lips, their apparent changes in position being due to head
movements both up and down and from side to side.
Mr. Guttwoch's observation as to the light seen on the
nape of the neck is not in the original notes and was not
confirmed by any of the other observers. The second
class of lights, namely, the illuminated patches seen on the
surface of the pyjamas, appear to be accounted for by
assuming that the light from the small points illuminated
a part of the clothing, and in this case the source of
light was apparently turned away from the observers as
might be the case if we imagine a sphere from only half
of which light was projected. The powder taken by the
medium at 9.1 p.m. was a preparation brought by himseK
from Warsaw which he called Thiocol {Potassium Guaiacol
Sulpho7iate) . This is a recognised remedy, although not
often employed in this country. The control both before
and after the sitting was negative. The powder showed
no luminosity when moistened, warmed, or rubbed, and
the same phenomena were produced later, when the medium
was supplied with the drug bought in London.

This sitting was important, both for the varietj^ of
luminous phenomena observed and for their movements in
relation to the medium. The first intimation that lights
were to be expected was at 9.43 p.m., when Mrs. Robert-
son saw a small light apparently near the medium's mouth.
This was followed for nearly two hours by similar appear-
ances. Throughout the sitting it had been noticed that
the medium constantly rubbed his chest with his hands
(still controlled) and that soon afterwards a light appeared.
Indeed at 10.18 p.m. Mr. Lambert hazarded the guess that
the light came from the hand, a proposition which we
consider later. At 11 p.m. Dr. Woolley, Mr. Lambert,
and Mrs. Robertson saw a streak of light upon the left
shoulder, whilst Mr. Dingwall saw a point of luminosity
within the mouth. It is probable that what W., L., and
R. saw was the light proceeding from the point which
D. localised as being in the medium's mouth, and reflected
from the shoulder, and not that there were two separate
luminous phenomena occurring together. At 11.18 p.m.
Mr. Lambert reported two small lights, and the other
observers confirmed his observation a moment later.
At the conclusion of the sitting and when the medium
signified that the trance was over, he was examined before
leaving his chair. The light was put out and W. ex-
amined the interior of the mouth. A light was seen by
D. similar to those seen during the sitting. G. also saw
it, but W. reported that he had observed two small
luminous specks the size of pins' heads which he thought
48 T'. ./. Woolley and E. J. Dingwall. [part
were adherent to the teeth or gums and were much
fainter than the bright Hght seen during the sittings.
We failed to secure these specks, as they were invisible
when the light in the room was turned on. The re-
maining sittings with the medium were uniformly negative.
Conclusions.
In discussing the evidence secured with the medium
Fronczek we shall confine ourselves to a consideration of
the luminous phenomena. We do not believe that we are
wrong in suggesting that the alleged telekinetic movements
reported in Sitting II. were normally produced by use of
the cushion as described in the notes following the record
of that sitting. Although we do not consider that it is
justifiable or logically sound to condemn all the pheno-
mena of a medium as fraudulent beca.use one particular
phenomenon is found to be so, we cannot help thinkmg
that, in tliese circumstances, other phenomena require
a great deal of evidence in their support before their
supernormal character can be seriously considered. It
miist be admitted, however, that the luminous phenomena
produced by the medium occurred in spite of the examina-
tion both before and after each sitting. If these lights
are normal objects brought into the seance room, we
failed to discover in vv^hat Avay they were introduced.
Before discussing this difficulty, however, it may be of
some interest if we sketch very roughly the sort of method
which, if employed, might give the results observed at the
sittings. Firstly then, it seems to us certain that in every
case ^ the lights were closely connected to the medium's
mouth. In the fourth sitting Mr. Dingwall had the same
impression as that which he had received in Poland,
namely, that the light was in the form of a small sphere
the size of an ordinary pea and attached to the end of
a small stick about 5 cm. in length. In the seventh
sitting tliis appearance changed, and the observers agreed
that it seemed as if the small luminous sphere were
^ We omit, the instaiico when Mr. (iuttwooli said that he observed a
light on the nape of the neck, as no one else observed it, and he may
have been mistaken as to its position.
97.] Luminous and oilier Phenomena. 49
attached to a thread which was held by the medimi^'s
hps. At 10.20 p.m. on May I- the hght was seen
apparently hanging and swinging from the medinm's
mouth "
(p. 45), and the same observation was repeated
at 10.34 p.m. The sudden appearance away from the
mouth was curious and could be explained by an in-
genious use of the hands. As has already been said, it
was noticed that before the appearance of a light the
medium was often accustomed to rub his chest. Now,
this rubbing might have served another purpose. For the
hands ui rubbing the upper part of the chest would have
formed a convenient screen behind which the luminous
body could have been concealed as it dropped from the
mouth as far as the suspending thread permitted. The
sudden removal of the hands would reveal it in such a
way that it would first become visible in the neighbour-
hood of the chest ; this position for it being secured by
the medium lowering his head so that the object hung
against the surface of his garments. Now, supposing that
the little sphere were luminous on only half its surface then
a number of phenomena would result from its sudden
disclosure. For as it rotated the observers would see
what would appear to be different degrees of light, whereas
what would in reality be observed would be different
aspects of the same luminous body. Similarly when the
painted haK hung close to the pyjamas the light from its
surface would cause a faint illumination of the surface of
the material, and thus the single use of one suspended
luminous object would present a number of different
phenomena. Now, if this supposition is, at least to a
certain extent, accurate, what form would the apparatus
used to produce the phenomena most conveniently take ?
It would appear that all that woidd be required would be
one or two small sphere-like bodies, part of the surfaces
of which had been covered with one of the higher grades
of luminous compounds such as are used on the ordinary
commercial luminous watch dials. This preparation emits
just that greenish or bluish light we observed, and being
for all practical purposes permanent, would be found more
convenient than, ordinary luminous paint which requires tp_
p..

be exposed to light before use. The Httle sphere might
either be plain or enclosed in a transparent sheath, and
the whole either fastened to the top of a small piece of
wood or wire, or on the other hand attached to the end
of a short piece of thread. The main difficulty in these
suggestions is that the medium must in some way have
smuggled in his apparatus and that we failed to detect it.
We do not. however, believe that the difficulty is as great
as it may appear. We do not claim to be able infallibly
to prevent mediums from bringing in such tiny objects as
the apparatus mentioned above, and in this particular
case failure to detect them would be the more readily
understandable as the lights were produced only twice
during the entire series. It is certainly difficult to
imagine what method would have been employed, but
probably it was as simple and as subtle as that of
moving the bell and ring in Sitting II.^ Had these
luminous phenomena occurred at every sitting we should
have been able to make a far more detailed study of
them, and also of the methods which might have been
employed to smuggle them in despite our control. At
this point an objection will most certainly arise. it will
be asked what right have we to cast doubt upon the
authenticity of the phenomena when it is admitted that
we failed to prevent our hypothetical apparatus from being
introduced ? The answer is that the lights occurring with
this medium exhibited no quality whatever incompatible
with a supposititious normal origin. Both in their ap-
pearance and their behaviour nothing was observed which
could not be reasonably attributed to normal objects
manipulated in a manner which was easily j)ossible under
the existing conditions. The methods of concealment and
sudden exhibition ; the movements of the head corre-
sponding to the movements of the lights ; and especially
1 It might be suggested that a throat pouch such as vised by certain
natives in India (Med. Press and Circular, 1889, ii, 189) was employed by
the medium and that this contrihiited to his cough. It was notewortliy
that the luminous objects only appeared after the medium had had an
opportunity of I'aising his hands to his mouth whilst taking his cough
powder and drinking water (cf. Sitting IV., 9.1 p.m. and 9.10 p. in., and
Sitting Vll, 9.23 p.m. and 9.43 p.m.).
07.] LfimdnoKS and oilier Phenomena. 51
the luminous particles in the mouth after the sitting, all
these observations tally with a normal explanation but are
difficult of any reasonable explanation if the lights were
supernormal. On the supernormal hypothesis it would
almost appear, as Dr. Walter Prince has pointed out
in reference to certain alleged psychic photographs, that
the controlling agencies, with a malign indifference, had
purposely selected just those touches in the composition
of their work which were most likely to inspire suspicion
in the minds of the critical inquirer.
We feel compelled, therefore, to regard the phenomena
of Mr. Fronczek as probably normal, although we fully
admit our inability to explain in precise terms his modus
operandi. We liad but two opportunities of observing the
luminous phenomena of his mediumship, and it appears
to us more probable that our examination of his person
was ineffective in preventing the introduction of his
apparatus than that the phenomena we observed were
supernormal.
Summary.
1. At three sittings out of a total of nine given by Mr.
Fronczek at the Society's rooms, phenomena occurred which
purported to be produced supernormally.
2. At one of these three the phenomena consisted of
the movements of small luminous objects provided by us
for the purpose, and we suppose these movements to have
been brought about by the employment of a cushion held
in the medium's mouth.
3. At the other two sittings the phenomena consisted
of the appearance of small luminous objects, which ap-
peared to come from the medium's mouth and to be
attached to it, but we were unable to discover their
nature or the method of their introduction into the
seance room.
52 V. J. Woolley. [part
AN ACCOUNT OF A SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH
MR. GEORGE VALIANTINE.
By V. J. Woolley.
During the spring of 1925 Mr. Valiantine paid a visit to
this country as the guest of Mr. H. Dennis Bradley,
and we were able, by the generosity of one of our
members, to arrange through ]\Ir. Bradley that he
should give a series of sittings to some representatives of
the Society.
Some months previously Mr. Bradley had offered to
procure for the Society a definite number of sittings of
which we should have exclusive control and at which all
the sitters should naturally be chosen by us. At a later
date, however, he became unable or unwilling to fulfil this
offer, and on the other hand made it an essential con-
dition of any sittings at all that his friend Mr. Hannen
Swaffer should be present at all of them. I mention
these facts solely because some criticism has been expressed
by various members of our permitting the attendance at
our sittings of a journalist who does not even belong to
the Society.
The mediumship of Mr. Valiantine is mainly of the
" direct voice
''
type, though there also occur at his
sittings numerous movements of material objects (especially
of the trumpets), and touches felt by the sitters, which are
claimed to be produced by supernormal means.
Our aim in these sittings was exclusively to secure
evidential material in the utterances of the voices, and we
made no attempt to test the method of production of the
voices or of any other of the accompanying physical
phenomena lest such an investigation should hinder this
aim.
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 53
For the first sitting we were informed by Mr. Bradley
that there should be not more than eight sitters, of whom
half should be men and half women. The four men's
places were thus occupied by Mr. Bradley, Mr. Swaffer,
Mr. Dingwall, and myself, while in addition to Mxs.
Bradley I was able to invite three of our lady members,
who came anonymously m the hope of securing evidential
material. As JVIr. Bradley has since expressed some
criticism of the choice of sitters for this sitting, it may
be worth mentionmg that to the best of my belief all
three are convinced of the possibility of communication
with the surviving departed and had proved to be success-
ful sitters with other mediums. For one of them I had
myself taken notes at a Leonard sitting a few days
previously when very good results were obtained. Further,
the Society possessed written records of many of the
supposed communications which they had received, but
these had not been published and were not Avidely known,
so that any relevant material produced at the Valiantine
sitting might have been of great value. Unfortunately no
communications of any sort were made either to them or
any other sitters, and nothing occurred beyond some of the
usual physical phenomena with which we were not con-
cerned for the reason I have mentioned, and the voices
of two of Valiantine's habitual " guides who said " good
evening " and " good night " respectively.
At the second sitting no voices were heard at all, and
before the date arranged for the third sitting Mr. Bradley
strongly expressed the view that the sittmgs should be
transferred to his house from our seance room, which he
considered for some reason unsuitable. He further asked
that for the next sitting there should be a complete
change of sitters as far as the Society's representatives
were concerned.
In accordance with this view the thnd sitthig took place
as recorded below, the Society bemg represented by Una,
Lady Troubridge, and Miss Radclyffe Hall only. The
following is thek account of this and the succeeding

54 V. J. Woolhy. [part
I. Lady Troubridge's Records of the Sittings of 13th,
16th, and 21st March, 1925.
On Friday, March 13, 1925, Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I had
our first sitting with the medium George Valiantine at Mr.
H. Dennis Bradley's house, Dormcourt, Kingston Vale. The
sitting began at about 8.30 p.m. and lasted for about two and
a half hours. The circle consisted of the medium, Mr. H. D.
Bradley, Mrs. Bradley, Mr. Hannen Swaifer, myself, and Miss
Radclyffe-Hall ; the two latter sitting on behalf of the S.P.R.
Valiantine was well acquainted with all the sitters except our
two selves, and he had been told before the sitting, by Mr.
Bradley, that the two new sitters were Una, Lady Troubridge,
and Miss Radclyffe-Hall. In any case, we have long since
assumed that our ajopearance must, evidentially, be taken as
familiar to anyone associated with Psychical Research, and that
any medium might be expected to recognise us at sight from
description.
We sat in total darkness in the morning room. We did not
meet Valiantine until we entered the seance room, when we
were introduced to him by name. I entered the room a few
moments before Miss Radclyffe-Hall, who joined us just as the
medium enquired whether we preferred sitting next to each
other. I replied that it was a matter of indifference to us,
and that in a circle we always sat in whatever order the
medium considered best. As a matter of fact, since we were
both aware of the impossibilitj^ of controlling the medium in
any A\ay in a completely dark seance and with no conditions
imposed, the position in which we sat appeared to us un-
important compared to the establishment of a sympathetic
atmosphere that would be favourable to the display of his
powers, if genuine. We took it that he had probably been
told that we were reputed to be careful investigators, and that
such knowledge inight in an}' case introduce an element of
self-consciousness unfavourable to results.
I sat on the medium's right, about four feet from him ; on
my right Mrs. Bradley, then Mr. Swaffer, next to him Miss
Radclyffe-Hall, and next to her again Mr. Bradley with the
gramophone on his right between him and the medium. Just
before the lights were extinguished Valiantine placed two
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 55
trumpets upright in the centre of the circle. These were of
aluminium, in three sections, collapsible. Roiind the wide end
of one was a band of luminous paint and one luminous star,
^vhile round the other was an identical band with a row" of
luminous dots rumring up one side towards the narrow end.
In the darkness these luminous marks became clearly visible.
The sitters did not hold hands either with each other or Avith
the medium. We were, however, told that it was preferable
not to cross the legs or to clasp the hands together. Quiet
conversation between the sitters or with the medium was said
to be advisable as reducing the tension of expectation and
reassuring the sitters as to the medium's whereabouts.
I may say at once that throughout this and all subsequent
sittings, the medium, who remained to all appearance in a
normal state of consciousness, conversed from time to time
quietly with the sitters and asked no questions that could be
interpreted as fishing for information—nor did he do so at
other times when we met him before and after sittings.
During the present sitting, while we are not prepared to
state that he spoke actually simultaneously with any " direct
"
or trumpet voice, he did on several occasions speak from his
chaii- so immediately after a voice had spoken through the
trumpet or at the other side of the circle or high up in the
far corner of the room, as in our opinion to preclude the possi-
bility of his having spoken in those positions and regained
his chair. Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I are also satisfied that on
several occasions the voices came from inside the trumpet in
such a way as could only be produced by spealdng actually
into the narrow end or into a tube connected with it. This
was corroborated by the fact that when, immediately after the
sitting, Vahantine and Mr. Bradley asked me to examine the
trumpets, one of them, from which the voice terminating
the sitting had appeared to issue, was beaded inside its narrow
end and to some extent down its length with moisture, as it
would have been after use for normal conversation.
Of course Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I both realised from the
first that under the conditions of this dark, uncontrolled seance,
it would be impossible to form any definite opinion of the
modus operandi, but we think it only fair to Valiantine to say
that, apart from any evidential value lying in the utterances
66 V. J. WooUey. [PAftT
of tlie voices, "we feel that the total phenomena produced at
this sitting were beyond what could have been obtained by the
fraudulent efforts of the medium unaided by any accomplice,
although, had any accomplice been present, the entire physical
phenomena could have been produced without detection being
possible. These, apart from the various voices, consisted of
touches upon the heads and hands of the sitters, and a rapid
M'hirhng of the trumpet above my head. My head was patted
once, I received three little taps on my left shoulder, and Miss
Radclyffe-Hall Avas touched on the hand by something which is
described as feeling like a bunch of bananas. Gramophone
records were played at intervals throughout the sitting, the
sitters joining in from time to time, and early in the proceed-
ings Valiantine led the circle in the Lord's Prayer.
The " voices " came in the following order, after two or
three records and the prayer :
1. Voice of " Dr. Barnett."' dee]) and quite loud, ap])ear-
iiig to issue from tlie floor inside one of the trumpets
—
n(jn-evidential remarks.
2. Voice of " Bert (the medium's brother-in-law),
falsetto, from near the ceiling—facetious, non- evidential
remarks, possibly designed to reduce tension by causing
" light reUef."
3. Voice of Kokum, a native of some sort—very loud,
non-evidential remarks.
4. Voice of " Pat," an Irishman of humorous type—non-
evidential remarks.
5. Voice of a Sioux C!hief, producing shouts of megaphonic
potency—non-evidential remarks.
6. Voice of someone who claimed to be " Feda," Mrs.
Osborne Leonard's control. It must be noted, however,
that neither Miss Radclyffe-Hall nor I thought that the
voice or accents bore any resemblance to the " Feda "
voice familiar to us at Mrs. Leonard's. It sjDoke at
Valiantine's with an American accent and idioms, pro-
nounced consonants which offer an almost insuperable
difficulty to " Feda Leonard," and addressed me as " Lady
Troubridge," a thing " Feda Leonard " has never done in
over eight years, and a name she would either mispro-
nounce or achieve with obvious difficulty, since the letter
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valianiinc. 57
R is her greatest stumbing-block. However, the other
sitters—whose experience of " Feda Leonard " is brief com-
pared with ours—exclaimed that the " Feda Valiantine
"
voice was exactly like its prototype. Beyond such evi-
dence against authenticity as was furnished by the
peculiarities mentioned above this voice was non-evidential.
7. Mr. Swaffer recognized a voice and some non-evi-
dential remarks as emanating from the late Lord North-
cliffe.
8. Mr. and Mi's. Bradley exchanged some non-evidential
remarks with a female voice which they addressed as
" Annie.''
None of these voices, except the first, used the trumjjets,
which remained upon the floor until they had all spoken.
Shortly afterwards a trumpet rose in the dark to a level
with Miss Radclyffe-Hall's face, and the name Alfred was
whispered in it several times ; it was acknowledged by Miss
RadclyfEe-Hall, and was audible and intelligible to all the
circle ; it Avas followed by a word that began with the
syllable Her. Once it apjDeared to say Herge and upon
that name not being recognized some abortive answers were
given to a question by Mr. Swaffer as to how long the speaker
had passed over. Answers varied from one to fourteen years,
and the trumpet fell down. In a moment or two it was up
again—still directed at Miss Radclylfe-Hall—and gave the
names Alfred Herwood (pseudonym) in a loud whisper quite
audible to me at the opposite side of the circle, and was at
once recognized by me. The trumpet having fallen, I asked
Alfred Herwood to give me the name of the person better
known to him than I Avas and better known to me than
himself and who was a link between us. Almost at once the
trumpet came to me and the name Francis (pseudonym)
was given twice in a loud whisper audible to the entire circle.
This was perfectly correct, as I then informed the circle.
Alfred Herwood was an acquaintance of mine and a friend of
my family who lost his life under unusual circumstances nearly
eighteen years ago, and the other name he gave was that of a
close friend of his and a relation of my own. This person we
both addressed alwaj^s by the Christian name given through the
trumpet. Alfred Herwood and his friend, Francis, died within
58 V. J. Woolley. [part
a week of each other, and that friend's name Avas the last
thing I ever heard him mention. Alfred Herivood has never
been spoken of or purported to communicate with us at any
other medium, which makes the present occurrence of greater
value. On the other hand, both he and his friend were
government officials who died under unusual circumstances
which were much discussed in London at the time, and my
connexion with them is actually known, if seldom remembered
or discussed nowadays, to a number of people.
The next incident of interest Avas when the trum];)et again
went to Miss Radclyffe-Hall and murmured a word in two
syllables which she could not catch. Mrs. Bradley said, " Is it
your Mother ?
" But the voice said " No " to this. The
trumpet then came to me, and after several abortive efforts
I was able to distinguish without doubt the surname East-
man (pseudonym). This name I acknowledged as known to
me, whereupon the sound of three kisses were heard in the
trumpet, and it rose to my head and tapped it three times.
I then said : "I recognize your name, but there are two, or
even three people living whom you would like to send a
message to. Will you give me the name of one of them ?
Several apparent efforts were made—unintelligible whispers—and
the trumpet fell three times to the ground ; then the whole
circle heard a whisper :
" Give my love to Eastman." I re-
plied :
" Correct so far as it goes, but I think you can do
better." Presently another effort was made. " Give my love
to her—give my love to my daughter," and, finally, in response
to my pressing for the name, the voice whispered quite clearly :
" Give my love to '
X,' " giving a most unusual Chi'istian name.
The giving of the surname Eastman was quite good,
provided the medium is held not to have made any enquiries
regarding our intimate friends, in which event he could natur-
ally have learnt that " X " Eastman, who has recently lost
her mother, is one of our intimates. Evidence purporting to
come from Mrs. Eastman has been received by us elsewhere,
but although some incidents have been pubUshed the names
involved were all disguised, and such pubhcations would have
afforded no clue to Valiantine regarding the Eastman
comiexion.
An interesting feature of this particular incident is that the
97.] Sittings ivith Mr. George Va.liantine. 59
Valiantine 3Irs. Eastman made a mistake which the
Leonard 3Irs. East^nan has never fallen into. In her life-
time Mrs. Eastman was a reserved and far from senti-
mental lady, who was only slightly known to Miss Radclyffe-
Hall and myself during the last year of her life. At Mrs.
Leonard's, Mrs. Eastman expresses no particular affection
for or interest in us ; her attitude is that we are her only
means of sending evidence to her daughter. At Valiantine's,
Mrs. Eastman kisses me—a thing that she never dreamed
of doing in life, and at a later sitting addresses me as dear,"
tells me she is " coming home w ith me, "
and, in fact, evinces
a strong personal interest and affection which she never felt
either for Miss Radclyffe-Hall or myself in her lifetime.
The thii'd and last attempt to give evidence at this first
sitting referred to Miss Radclyffe-Hairs father. The trumpet
went to her and she was only able to distinguish the words
Your father,' followed by an unintelligible name. She
suggested that the voice might be intended for me, but this
was vigorously denied, the voice sajdng quite loudly :
" No,
no, I want you,'' and the trumpet falling to the ground. It
rose up again however and said, in tones quite audible to the
other sitters, " Your father, Radclyffe,"" adding a message of
approval that the sitter was '"
investigating and trying to prove
immortaUty," after which the trumpet fell and rolled on the
ground, Mr. Swaffer replacing it upright. Miss Radclyffe-Hall's
father has purported to communicate through Mrs. Leonard,
and on this occasion the giving of his name as Radclyffe
"
Avas rather a good point. The medium remarked at the time
that the voice had probably lacked the power to add the
" Hall " and thus give his entire name, but, as a matter of
fact. Miss Radclyft'e-Hall s father was christened '"
Radclj^ffe,"
his full name being Radclyffe Radclyffe-Hall,"' and therefore
he might be supposed to have wished to give his Christian
name, which Avas probably unknown to the medium. On the
other hand, in this case as before, the mental tone Avas some-
what out of key, since on no former occasion has Radclyffe
Radclyffe-Hall shown any particular interest in his daughter
"working to prove immortahty," and at a subsequent Valiantine
sitting he purported to be anxious about and to send messages
to a person who passed out of his life quite seventeen years
60 V. J. WooUey. [PAKT
before he died, to whom he would be most luiUkely to send
any message, and who would haA^e no wish to receive any.
After the above incidents some remarks from the " controls
"
closed the sitting.
Our second Valiantine sitting took place at 8.30 ]i.m. on
Monday, March 16, 1925, at Dorincourt.
The circle was the same as before, with the addition of
Dr. V. J. Woolley, Hon. Research Officer of the S.P.R., who
sat between me and Mrs. Bradley. Owing to the extra sitter
the circle was more croAvded, and I sat only about two feet
distant from the medium.
There was a longer delay than on the former occasion before
the voices began. The Lord's Prayer was recited and four or
five records played before the first voice was heard.
"Dr. Barnett," "Pat," " Kokum," and "Bert" spoke
briefly and non-evidentially, and once again there was a voice
that claimed to be that of ••
Feda," which spoke as before,
using American accent and idioms, and s]3ealdng always in the
first person singular, a thing " Feda at Mrs. Leonard's does
only occasionally, and again pronouncing all her R's Avith ease
and addressing me as '•
Lady Troubridge." Just before this
voice spoke a female voice had twice AA'hispered just above my
head my name " Una," but seemed unable to say more. Just
after that I Avas tapped three times on the head, and tAvice,
separately, single taps on the arm nearest to the medium.
When I announced the taps Valiantine enquired which arm
had received them. Dr. Woolley Avas then tapped on the head,
then Mr. Swaffer and Mrs. Bradley. Miss Radclyffe-Hall was
not touched.
There followed various attempts to use the trumpets. Voices
purporting to be those of Miss Radclyfi'e-Hall's father, of Alfred
Herwood, of my relation
—
Francis—his friend, of Mrs. East-
man, of Dt. WooUey's father, and of Mr. SAvaft'er's brother,
spoke at intervals, but added nothing to the evidence given at
the former sitting beyond the fact that my relation mentioned,
correctly, his relationship to myself. No test questions were
repUed to, and there Avere certain further disturbing factors :
1. Alfred Herwood persisting in speaking to Miss Rad-
clyfl'e-Hall, Avhom he never kncA\' in life, and calling her
" dear.""
97.] Sittings wiih Mr. George Valiantine. 61
2. My relation calling me dear,"' a term he never used
when addr^essing me, except when displeased ; in fact,
rarely, if ever, even then.
On the other hand, we considered a certain impatience and
excitement disj^layed by the '"
Radclyffe-Hall " voice as char-
acteristic of him and of his manner Avhen communicating
through Mrs. Leonard.
Also we considered that, in s])ite of the darkness, we had
some opportunity^ of ascertaining that the medium at any rate
remained seated in his chair when voices were wandering round
the circle. He spoke frequently, yawned, moved and breathed
audibl}^ immediately before or after the voices spoke, much too
promptly, we thought, to admit of his having spoken and left
or regained his seat. On one occasion, I am prepared to
assert that he uttered two or three syllables of comment from
his chair before " Dr. Barnett's " voice had ceased inside the
trumpet on the floor, so that I heard both voices simul-
taneously. I was waiting and watching for this phenomenon
and am certain I was not mistaken, althougli Dr. WooUey and
Miss Radclyffe-Hall, whose attention I drew to it, had not
remarked it. Other members of the circle said it had occurred
earlier in the sitting, but, if so, I did not remark it. In my
opinion this occurrence does definitely go to prove that the
voices cannot in every case be produced by fraudulent efforts
of the medium unaided by any accomplice.
The latter part of the sitting was taken up by a three-
cornered discussion between " Dr. Barnett." H. Dennis Bradley
and Dr. V. J. WooUey, in which the other sitters joined
occasionally, as to whether the test sittings at the Society's
seance room in Tavistock Square should be resumed, Mr.
Bradley pronouncing himself as stronglj^ against their resump-
tion. The medium took no active part in the discussion,
during which Dr. WooUey invited " Dr. Barnett "'
to state his
reasons for considering the S.P.R. seance room as unsuited to
the sittings. Dr. Barnett appeared very antagonistic to any
scientific investigation and to any attitude save that of un-
qualified behef in the spirit oiigin of all the phenomena. He
said that " test conditions " and any feeling of doubt on the
part of the sitters created an atmosj)here that absolutelj''
blocked phenomena, and that the objections to the S.P.R,
62 F. ./. WooJIei/. [part
seance room lay, not only in ceTlain " contra])tion.s " which he
alleged, in spite of Dr. Woolley's denial, were there, and which
he implied, with some derisive laughter, were known by Dr.
Woolley to be there, but still more in the " blank mentality
"
of Dr. Woolley himself and other investigators. Dr. Barnett
volunteered the remark that he wondered why Dr. Woolley had
ever been selected as Research Officer, but he had no remedy
to suggest beyond unqualified belief, and he refused to accept
Dr. Woolley's repeated assurances that the seance room at
Tavistock Square is devoid of traps or contrivances for the
torture and undoing of mediums, or the explanation offered
that such simjile ])araphernalia as exist, connected with lighting,
etc., are placed there for the medium's convenience as much as
for that of the investigators.
George Valiantine looked ill and seemed exhausted after this
sitting, the result, in Miss Radclyffe-Hall's, Dr. Woolley's and
my opinion, of the over-heated discussion initiated by
Dr. Barnett, which had gone on during the sitting—in
which incidentally he had taken no ]iart beyond remarking
that he was (piite willing to continue the sittings at Tii\'istoc'k
Square.
The sitting I'liclcd at about II p. in., and I ascertained
afterwards that one of the trumpets was dam]") inside as on
tlie first occasion.
After the sitting, as on the former occasion, Valiantine made
no effort to elicit any iitformation from us and impressed us
favourably. He expressed himself as quite willing to try and
sit for Miss Radciyffe-Hall and myself in daylight, with the
assistance of Mrs. Bradley and lier small son aged, T think,
eight years.
Our third sitting with Valiantine toolc place at 6.30 p.m. at
Dorincourt on Friday, March 21, 1925. Present, the former
circle with the addition of Mrs. V. J. Woolley. The latter had
arranged, at very short notice, to take the place of Sir Oliver
Lodge's secretary, Miss Nea Walker, who had been expected.
We, Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I, had been advised of the
alterati(m by Dr. Woolley some thii'ty-six hours before the
sitting, and Mr. Bradley had lunched with Di'. Woolley on
the day of tlie sittiiig and had been informed of it then. I
do uot think', liovvever, that Mrs. Bradley liad been told, or
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 63
that she knew that Miss Walker was not coming and was to
be replaced by another lady.
Dr. and Mi's. WooUey drove to Dorincoiirt with us and, on
arrival, Mr. and Mrs. Bradley being from home, we three
women went upstairs to leave our wraps. On coming down-
stairs we found Valiantine at the foot of the stairs, and while
I was shaking hands with him Miss Radclyffe-Hall introduced
Mrs. WooUey by name to Mrs. Bradley, who was advancing
towards us from the front door. There is no doubt that had
Valiantine been attentive and alert to catch names he could
then have heard his new sitter introduced as " Mrs. WooUey,"
since the name was spoken a few feet away from him. Miss
Radclyffe-Hall made no attempt to conceal the name, as we
had been given to understand that no reUance was being
placed upon anonymity of sitters in these sittings.
It must, hov/ever, be noted that Mrs. Bradley, as will be
seen b} the sequel, did not catch Mrs. WooUey's name at their
first introduction, so that Valiantine may not have done so
either at that time. It is, however, in my opinion, impossible to
believe that he did not hear it later, just prior to the sitting.
When we were all assembled in the drawing-room, with the
exception of VaUantine, who was preparing the seance room,
Mr. Bradley suggested that Mi's. WooUey should remain
anonymous to the medium, but upon its being pointed out to
him that Valiantine must be talien to have heard her name in
the hall, he abandoned the idea of anonymity. Mrs. Bradley
and I then entered the seance room and found Valiantine there
alone, placing the trumpets by the electric chandelier in order
that the luminous paint should acquire luminosity. I at once
asked him how we should sit, and whether, if I sat next to
him as on the former occasions, Mrs. Bradley might sit between
me and Dr. Woolley. The mecUum agreed at once, and Mrs.
Bradley added that her husband would sit as usual by the
gramophone on Valiantine's left, Miss Radclyffe-Hall next to
Mr. Bradley, then Mr. Swaffer, and I added, Dr. Woolley
next to you, Mrs. Bradley, and then Mrs. WooUey."' IVfrs.
Bradley looked surprised and said: "Is that Mrs. Woolley?"
I thought she was conveying reproof at my mentioning the
new sitter's name, so I reminded her :
" Yes, Mrs. Woolley,
you know we agreed that Mr, Valiantine must be held to know
64 F. ./. Woolley. [part
that it is Mrs. Woolley." Mrs. Bradley still looked surprised
and queried : "'Is she Dr. Woolley"s secretary ? And I
replied: "Not tliat I Icnow of—she's his wife—they both came
with us in the car." And I repeated : She's Mrs. Woolley,
Dr. Woolley 's wife." During this entire conversation, Valian-
tine Avas standing idle, apparently listening, at ray elbow,
facing towards us. Under these circumstances I do not think
there can be any doubt that he heard and understood the
entire conversation. I now believe that Mrs. Bradley asked
the questions about the secretary, having it in her mind that
a new sitter was expected who was someone's secretary, and
not having grasped the alteration of plans.
As this conversation ended Valiantine reached down the
trumj)ets from the chandelier and, while discussing with him
the possibility of designing a trumpet of a better type, I was
able to ascei'tain that both trumpets were warm from the
electric light and quite dry inside and out. I particularly
examined the mouthpieces, putting my little finger into the
narrow ends. I gave Valiantine every opjiortunity of objecting
to this inspection by asking him whether it was deleterious to
phenomena that a stranger should handle the trumpets just
prior to a sitting. He replied that it did no harm.
We sat in the same order as before, save that Mrs. Bradley
had changed places with Dr. Woolley and Mrs. Woolley sat on
his other side. About eight gramophone records were played
and the Lord's Prayer recited before anything haiopenecl at all.
Then " Dr. Barnett's " voice was heard from one of the
trumpets on the floor, weaker than usual, greeting the circle.
A short while after " Bert " from near the ceiling announced
that the conditions were " exquisite." Another longish interval
of gramophone and then " Feda's " voice—still quite unhke
' Feda Leonard "
—was heard very Aveakly calling me " Lady
Troubridge " and speaking with American accent and idioms
—
a peculiarity not shared by " Dr. Barnett."
Feda Valiantine " aimounced that :
" Raymond is here and
wants to speak with Miss Walker." This remark was clearly
audible to the entire circle. After a moment's silence Mr.
Bradley repeated :
" Raymond is here and wants to speak to
Miss Walker?" Adding: "Does he think Miss Walker is
b,ere 1, Can you see her ?
" AAd " Feda replied ;
" Ray-
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 65
mond can, and he wants to speak to her." Someone in the
circle, I think Miss Radclyffe-Hall, said :
''
Who does Raymond
Avant to speak to?" And the Feda " voice answered:
''Miss Walters." JVIr. Hannen Swaffer repeated: "Walters?
Is it Walters or Walker ?
" And Miss Radclyffe-Hall said
:
'"'
It sounded like Walters that time "—a statement which I
corroborate. There was no immediate answer, and Mr. Bradley
urged " Feda " not to go away without further elucidation, as
she had " placed us al) in a very embarrassing position." He
repeatedly urged that she must continue the subject, and
presently the " Feda " voice armounced once more that " Ray-
mond has come to give a message to Miss Walker." Mr.
Bradley then said : "If Raymond can see Miss Walker here,
let him take the tnimpet to her."" And Miss Radclyft'e-Hall
added :
" Yes, take the trumpet over to her." Almost as she
spoke, one of the trumpets seemed to leap from the ground
and with a violence such as we had not jet observed hurled
itself at Mrs. Woolley, striking her in the darkness so that she
cried out ; it then crashed to the ground simultaneously with a
loud cry from Mr. Bradley: "That's the stuff, 'Feda,' that"s
the stuff to give them ! Now we've got the real evidence at
last ! Now they can't say we haven't given evidence," etc.,
etc., and more to the same effect. JVIr. Bradley was so much
excited and spoke so loudly that no one else could make
themselves heard for some moments, and he gave us the
impression of a man wrought up with excitement at the
verification of his own expectations. So much so that when at
last Mrs. Woolley could make herself heard, saying : " But
I am Mrs. Woolley," IMr. Bradley answered incredulously
'
What ?
'
' And she seemed to feel it necessary to repeat her
statement :
" Mr. Bradley, I am Mrs. WooUey, I'm not Miss
Walker." Adding :
" Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry !
" Mr.
Bradley's obvious bewilderment and disappointment were very
evidently genuine, and very distressing to witness. He im-
mediately began to display obvious distrust of the entire
phenomena, and I thought it only fair to Valiantine to inter-
pose a statement, which was endorsed by Mrs. Bradley, as to
"VaUantine's having heard us mention Mrs. WooUey's name
several times just before the sitting. Valiantine added quite
quietly :
" Yes, I knew it was Mrs. Woolley."
E
66 V. J. Woolley. [part
There followed an upbraiding of the purporting " Feda " and
of the controls by Mr. Bradley, who demanded an explanation
of the mistake. Then came a perfectly obvious attempt to
explain away the error b}^ " Dr. Barnett " and the supposed
" Feda." We were told that the mistake was ours, that the
circle had misunderstood ; that Raymond had never thought
that Miss Walker was there, and "'
Feda " affirmed that she
had said :
" Raymond is here and he wanted to speak to Miss
Walker," meaning that he was disappointed at Miss Walker's
absence from the sitting. Mr. Bradley pointed out that the
trumpet had gone to Mrs. Woolley in immediate reply to the
request that Raymond should use it to indicate Miss Walker,
and the controls immediately asserted that this had been mere
coincidence and had had nothing to do with Raymond, but
that a strange spirit who desired to speak to IVIrs. Woolley,
" a lady friend " of hers, had seized that moment to raise the
trumpet to her and attempt communication.
In order to calm the circle and close what was becoming an
impossible and very painful situation, I suggested that argu-
ment should cease and that the circle should again recite the
Lord's Prayer. VaUantine seemed deeply depressed, but he
acquiesced and led the prayer, almost immediately after which
" Dr. Barnett," speaking as usual from one trumpet on the
ground, closed the sitting. As soon as the lights were turned
on Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I examined the trumpets. One
was perfectly dry ; the other, from which " Dr. Barnett's
"
voice had seemed to come, was moist inside its narrow
end, but not, as on the former occasions, right down its
length.
Valiantine made no effort after the sitting to explain the
mistake—either to exculpate himself or to resent criticism,
which he received freely at sujjper both from Mr. Bradley and
Mr. Swaffer. He still impressed Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself
favourably, although we cannot minimise the imj)ortance and
extraordinary nature of the occurrence. Valiantine sat next to
me at supper, drank lemonade and ate heartUy, appearing far
less perturbed than I was myself. Later that evening he
agreed quite willingly to try for the voices in dayUght on the
following Monday with myself and Miss Radclyffe-Hall and
Mrs. Bradley and her little boy.

II. Lady Trotjbridge's Recobd of Daylight Sitting
March 2.3, 1925.
As previously arranged Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I arrived at
Dorincourt soon after 3 p.m. and were received hy Mr. Bradley's
eldest son. After he had entertained us a few minutes in the
drawing-room Mrs. Bradley joined us and told us that
Valiantine had not yet woken from his afternoon nap. Siiortly
afterwards young Bradley went to see if the medium was
awake, and presently Valiantine joined us in the drawing-room.
We all repaired to the morning room and started sitting in the
bright liglit of a sunny afternoon. A large window extends
right across one end of the room, and one curtain was partially
drawn across one-half of it, leaving an opening of about five feet
by seven feet through which the light streamed into the room.
Young Bradley left the room, and Valiantine, going to a glass-
fronted bookcase in which were his two trumpets, selected one
of them (to the best of my belief one that I have seen used
at former sittings), the one with a luminous star at its wide
end near the band of luminous paint. He sat down in an
armchair with his back to the light, having directed us to sit
in front of him thus :

He rested his head and shoulders on the low back of the easy-
chair, Miss RadclyfEe-Hall sat in front of him with the small
end of the trumpet to her right ear, whUe Vahantine placed
the palms of both his hands flat against the wide end of the
trumpet, supporting it on his crossed thumbs. In this position
Miss Radclyffe-Hall could not see his face, though Mrs. Bradley
and I were both able to do so. For some minutes nothing
occurred except that Miss Radclyffe-Hall said she could hear
dull httle taps inside the trumpet, but these Avere inaudible to
me where I was sitting. However, both Mrs. Bradley and I
were satisfied that the medium's hands made no movement.
Presently the medium suggested that Mi-s. Bradley and I should
68 F. J. Woolley. [part
leave the room, and that Miss Radclyffe-Hall should see whether
things went better if she tried sitting alone with him.
Mrs. Bradley and I went and sat in. the drawing-room and
waited. Miss Radclyffe-Hairs record tells what occurred during
our absence.
Wlien she called me to come in again I took her place at
the narrow end of the trumpet, with its orifice to my right
ear, but Miss Radclyffe-Hall remarked that she had been sitting
latterly with her left ear to the trumpet and that I had better
adopt the same position. This I hastened to do, being thus
able to watch the medium's face while I listened. Almost
immediately some metallic taps occurred in the trumiDet.
Valiantine enquired whether I did not suffer from facing the
glare from the -^^indoAv, but beyond that offered no objection.
He placed his hands against the wide end of the trumpet as
before, and I noticed that the position was a tiring one for
his arms. At my suggestion Miss Radclyffe-Hall fetched a
cushion and placed it between the chair-arm and his right
elbo\\-, affording him better support, and having done so she
remained for some minutes kneehng beside him on his right
and closely watching his hands. Almost immediately small
metallic taps were heard in the trumpet close to my ear, and
rapidly became louder till they were audible to Miss Radclyffe-
Hall and to the medium as well as to myself ;
they became
quite loud and then varied in strength and were given singly
or in groups of two or three as requested by us, and this in
spite of the fact that both of us were closely watching the
medium's hands, she on his right side and I somewhat to the
left. He held his fingers extended so that the tips of all eight
fingers were visible to us both, and although Valiantine habitu-
ally wears a heavy ring upon one finger, we have been quite
unable, experimenting with a trumpet, to produce the raps
without showing movement of one or more fingers. Miss.
Radclyffe-Hall moved round the medium, watching his hands,
and on one occasion she remarked to the supposed operator
that he or she had better do their best since it was very
important for the medium, and that she had her eyes riveted
upon his iiands. While she was kneeling beside him she also
asked that the taps, which seemed to be located in the end of
the trumpet nearest my ear, should move to the medium's end
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 69
•of the trumpet, and her request was at once comj)lied with.
When she made the remarlt about watching the medium's
hands, Valiantine laughed and waggled his t^vo thumbs to draw
attention to their position, and almost simultaneously the taps
recommenced. Except for one sound more like a sigh than a
whisj)er I heard no voices so long as Miss Radclyffe-Hall was
in the room. At one moment the telephone rang and Valiantine
eeemed quite unperturbed and merely asked her to answer it.
Two or three moments later it rang again and she had to
answer once more and take a message to Mrs. Bradley. When
she returned Valiantine suggested that since she had obtained
voices when alone with him I might do likewise if she left us,
and she did so. After a few minutes a voice whispered
Alfred Alfred (the Christian name given at previous sittings)
quite audibly and intelligibly, but at a moment Avhen, owing to
slightly shifting a cramped position, my eyes were not actually
on Valiantine's mouth. He was lying back in the chair with
his chin raised, and the trumpet orifice covered by the palms
of his hands was about two feet from his face, and to one side
—
not, in mj opinion, a favourable position for projecting a
whisper do^^n it. Having readjusted my position we tried
again, but beyond more taps nothing occurred. VaUantine
yawned frequently and seemed droAvsy, I thought. He then
proposed that we should draw the curtains and try in the
dark. While he drew them he left the trumpet in my hands,
and I was at full liberty to handle or examine it had I
thought any purpose could be served by doing so. We sat for
some minutes in the dark, but nothing happened, not even
raps, till Mrs. Bradley summoned us to tea.
Immediately after tea VaUantine proposed that we should try
again, and Miss Radclyffe-Hall suggested that we should sit in
red electric light—there being such a Hght in the seance room.
It was placed on a shelf in the corner of the room farthest
from Valiantine but facing him, so that, after a moment or so,
my eyes becoming used to it, I could easily discern every
feature and movement of his face. As he wore an ordinary
stiff collar I could not observe Avhether his throat moved or
not, but as he kef)t his head back I could see under his chin.
I could also see with absolute certainty whether or not his
jnouth was closed. The taps in the trumpet began again almost
70 F. J. WooUey. [part-
immediately—Valiantine was now holding only his right hand
over the trumpet, using the other to shade his eyes from the
red glow, but the shadow stopped just below his eyes and did
not affect the rest of his face. In any case I could see that
his eyes Avere often closed and that he seemed drowsy as I tad
observed earlier ; he still yawned a good deal. As soon as the
taps began again he enquired whether the controls liked the
red light. Not only were there three brisk taps in the trum-
pet, but as in answer a sharp tap came on the shelf at the
far end of the I'oom, just where the red light was standing.
Valiantine laughed and exclaimed :
" Listen to that, they seem
to like the red light ! And almost as he ceased speaking
another ta]) came from the same position. Then, with my
eyes fixed on the medium's mouth, which was quietly closed,
I heard a fairly loud whisper in the trumpet: ''Alfred Her-
wood.'' I answered : Are you there, I'm so glad." And
the whisper resumed : "I am so glad to speak to you here."
During these tAvo sentences I am quite certain that Vahantine's
mouth Avas quietly and firmly 'closed, that his lips did not move,,
and that his face conveyed no impression of strain or effort..
I could not, of course, as stated earlier, actually see his throat,,
but I think any movement of it would ha\^e been visible
betAveen his chin and collar. Owing to my sitting lower thaa
the medium (I had earlier discarded the stool used before and
was sitting on the floor) the trumpet was even farther from
his face than before, and unless he could articulate those words
with closed mouth and motionless lips I am of opinion that he
did not speak them. I have tried rejpeatedly before a mirror
to enunciate the same words and at certain consonants
—
b, m, p—I am forced to move the lips quite visibly, while they
must remain apart slightly if any Avords are to be pronounced.
After that beginning several sentences were whispered in the
trumi^et, some quite uninteihgible, then my name " Una
several times in a female voice. After this I shifted the-
trumpet to the right ear so that I could no longer observe the
medium's face, feeling that Valiantine had endured long enough
the tension of being stared at. I merely listened to a voice
which claimed to be that of Mrs. Eastman, who had been a
purporting communicator at the earlier sittings. The voice
said : "'I wish 'X '
(her daughter) would come here," and
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 71
sent love to her. It added that the speaker was coming home
with me and had often been with me in Sterling Street. At
first I could not catch the name of the street, and Valiantine
asked the speaker to spell it : the reply was S.T.E.R.L.I.N.G.
The voice called me " Dear," and said she was very happy.
I then closed the sitting, as I thought VaUantine had sat long
enough, though he expressed his willingness to continue. As
regards these " communications," on this occasion Alfred
Herwood did not make any mistakes. Mrs. Eastman, on the
other hand, was not true to her jDrototype. In Hfe she would
never have called me " dear " or offered to come home with
me, since I hardly knew her and there was literally no affection
between us. She was an extremely stately and reserved old
lady, whom I met only a few times in her capacity as mother
of an old friend. Through IVIrs. Leonard's mediumship and
that of a relation of her own she has given rather remarkable
evidence, but far from asserting her happiness has expressed a
firm discontent and displeasure at having passed over and at
the conditions she is expected to enjoy.
Then, again, Miss Radclj/ fife-Hall and I do not now live at
Sterling Street, and left that house a year ago—although, and
this must be clearly understood, at the time of the above
sitting we still appeared in the Telephone Dii-ectory as resident
at that address, as witness the fact that a day or two before
the sitting under discussion Mr. Hannen Swafifer had addressed a
letter to Miss Radclyffe-Hall to SterUng Street, having presumably
looked up her address in the Telephone Directory. Mr. and Mrs.
Bradley, on the other hand, \\dth whom the medium is living,
are weU aware of our correct home address, and had they
casually mentioned it would not have spoken of SterUng Street.
I do not think that Mrs. Eastman can be taken to have
alluded to past days in Sterling Street, since she died not very
long before we left it, and would certainly never have troubled to
visit us there, except in the event of her daughter visiting us,
which, as it happens, she very rarely did after her mother's death.
III. Miss Radclyffe-Hall s Recokd of Daylight Sitting
]\Iakch 23, 1925.
As arranged at the last sitting, in Dr. Woolley's presence,
Lady Troubridge and I drove down to Dorincourt this after-
72 V. J. WooUey. [part
noon, aiTiving at about 3.15 p.m. We talked for about twentj^
minutes with Mrs. Bradley and her elder son, while Valiantine
remained asleep upstairs—or so Mrs. Bradley thought. Pre-
sently young Bradley Avent up to tell him of our arrival, and
in a short time Vahantine joined us in the drawing-room, and
Mrs. Bradley, Lady Troubridge, young Bradley and I pro-
ceeded with him to the seance room. Mr. Valiantine went to
the bookcase and took out fust one trumpet, which he replaced,
and then the other, which he extended. The trumpets had all
the aiDpearance of being the same as those I have seen used on
three previous occasions at dark seances ; that is to say, that
each trumpet had at its wide end a band of luminous paint
(not luminous in the daylight of course), and one had a line
of luminous paint dots up one side, the other, the one selected
by Valiantine, a single star above the band on one side.
Young Bradley then left the room.
Mr. Valiantine sat in an arm-chair with his back to the
window, I sat on a stool in front of him, close to his left
knee, holding the narrow end of the trumpet j^ressed to my
right ear. Mr. Vahanti]ie covered the wide end with his
hands, supporting the trumpet with his thumbs. For a little
time nothing much occurred, and Mr. Valiantine suggested that
we might get on better if Mrs. Bradlej^ and Lady Troubridge
left us. This they accordingly did. Almost immediately I
began to hear small indescribable movements inside the trum-
pet, then dull taps that might liave been made by the fleshy
tip of a finger (they sounded soft and muffled), then one
metaUic tap. Mr. Valiantine heard them too and remarked on
them, but only after I had acknowledged them. I asked for
more metallic taps and got them. I then heard a voice
whispering in my ear, I thought it said " Una " and told it so,
asking if it wanted Lady Troubridge, the voice said :
" No, no,
Johnnie," and then " It's your Father."
During the A\'hole of this I could not get a good view of the
medium's face or hands, which was most unsatisfactory ;
moreover, I fancy that I hear better with my left ear. I told
Mr. Valiantine that I wished to place the trumpet to my left
ear as I could hear better, and begged him to cover up his
end and keep the light well out of it while I moved round ;
I kept a thumb over my end. I turned on my stool so that
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantvne. 73
I faced Mi\ Valiantine completely, and then put the trumpet
to my left ear. Metallic taps began again immediately. I
fixed my eyes on Mr. Valiantine's fingers and thumbs. I could
see half-Avaj^ doM'n his eight fingers, and could see nearly the
whole of his two thumbs which supported the trumpet. I
could not detect the least suspicious movement, yet the taps
continued. Some of the taps were given singly, some in little
rhjrthmical groups. Next came the voice whispering again,
calling me " Johnnie " and saying that it was my father. I
could see Mr. Vahantine's face, which was a little to one side
of the trumpet, and during the whole time that the voice was
going on his mouth remained closed, there was no look of
strain on his face or around his lips, his colour did not change,
neither could I see any signs of perspiration. Once or twice he
closed his eyes for a moment, appearing a little cLrows}^. I
thought. I s]3oke to him occasionally, asking if he could hear
the words. He heard some and repeated them, but some
neither he nor I could catch, and some that he thought he had
heard he repeated wrongly. For part of the time he Avas
leaning back "^'^ith his head against the chair. The voice asked
me :
" Are 3-ou hard of hearing, my dear ?
" Then said
something I could not catch. It then said, "Tell your mother
I'm all right." And then more inarticulate whispering. I then
said :
" Father, give me mother's Christian name." And after
several attempts the name "Marie" was given, which was
correct. The medium said :
" I think he said '
Annie.'
"
I said :
" No, that's not it," but did not tell ]\Ir. Valiantine
what name had been given. After this there was an un-
successful attempt to give my grandfather's Christian name, the
words being very blurred. Then more taps ! During the
whole time that a voice was coming from the trumpet I stared
at ]VIr. Vaiiantine's lips and they remained Avithout movement.
Only after the voice stopped speaking on one or two occasions
did iVIr. Vahantine's lips open to address a remark to me or
to answer a question of mine or to urge a " Communicator "
to try and speak.
Once during the phenomena Mrs. Bradley's younger child, a
small boy, burst into the room and was told hy Mr. Valiantine
to go away, which he did. The A\hole time we could hear
people laughing and talking and opening and shutting doors
—
74 F. J. WooUeij. [part
enough, I should have thought, to upset any medium, but
through it all the voice went on speaking, or taps recurred, and
Mr. Vahantine remained quite placid.
After the voice seemed to have departed Mr. Valiantine
asked if I would like to call in Lady Troubridge. I did so,
and she sat down immediately on the stool, but placed the
trumpet to her right ear as she had seen me do before leaving
the room. I told her that I had sat the other way, and she
immediately changed round and faced the medium, placing the
trumpet to her left ear. I stood at one side watching Mr.
Valiantine. Presently taps began in the trumpet, some of
which Lady Troubridge or Mr. Valiantine declared, and some
of which were quite audible to me. I fixed my eyes on Mr.
Valiantine's hands, A^'hich I could now see practically in their
entirety, but the taps continued—I saw no movement of any
kind in the medium's hands, at least of a suspicious nature,
sometimes he shifted his hands on the trumpet, but not at the
moment of the taps occurring. Once I said : " Whoever is
there, tap loud, please, as this is most important for your
medium, I have my eyes riveted on his hands." Or words to
that effect. Mr. Valiantine kept his fingers extended, and then
waggled his thumbs and laughed. Then his hands remained
quite still, and some low taps occurred in the trumpet and
were quite audible to me. At about this stage Lady Trou-
bridge suggested that if I placed a cushion under the medium's
right arm it would be more restful for him, and I did so,
remaining for a few moments kneeling beside him, and while
there more taps occurring in the trumpet and seeming to come
from the end close to Lady Troubridge 's ear, I asked that the
taps should move to the other or broad end of the trumpet
;
my request was at once complied with, and she heard the taps
clearly coming from the broad end of the trumpet. Presently
Lady Troubridge discarded the stool and sat on the floor, by
which means the trumpet was lowered and the medium's arms
in a less strained position. No voice spoke in the trumpet,
but early in her sitting Lady Troubridge had mentioned that
she heard a sound Like breathing coming from the trumpet for
a moment. Twice during the time I was present at her
sitting the telephone rang in the seance room. On the first
occasion the medium asked me to answer it and tell the caller
97.] Sittmgs iviih Mr. George VaUantine. 75
to ring up in haK an hour's time. Tiiis I did. The second
time it rang a message was given me regarding Mr. Bradley's
car, and Mr. VaUantine asked me to convey it to Mrs. Bradley ;
this I also did. In the end Mr. VaUantine asked me to
remain out of the room, as perhaps they would get on better
without me, and I compUed.
A Uttle later Mrs. Bradley went into the seance room to
announce tea, and I foUowed her. I found the room in dark-
ness, the curtains having been drawn in order to try and get
the voices. After tea Mi\ VaUantine asked Lady Troubridge to
sit again, and I suggested that they should sit with a red
electric light (one electric globe at end of room facing VaUan-
tine). My suggestion was agTeed to.
A record of what then occurred has been made by Lady
Troubridge, who sat alone with Mi". VaUantine.
Mr. VaUantine wears a deep gold band on one finger (I think
the third finger of the right hand). We have tried to produce
raps on a metal trumpet like that employed by him, and with
a heavy ring worn, but have failed to do so without movement
of the whole finger, such movement as must have been clearly
visible during the sitting at which the raps occurred.
We have tried to produce inteUigible whispers with the mouth
closed and motionless—Lad}" Troubridge is better at this than
I am, but her Ups have to remain sUghtly open and look puffy
and her throat moves. Also, her face looks forced and
strained.
After the sittings young Bradley asked me to explain the
system of Cross-Correspondences to him, which I did in Mr.
VaUantine's presence. He seemed anxious to know what Dr.
WooUey thought of his mediumshij), and I repUecl that we had
not yet discussed the sittings. The S.P.R. was mentioned, and
I told him that Mrs. Piper was their pensioner—Mr. VaUantine
seemed favourably impressed and showed no antagonism towards
the Society. He said that he thought Mrs. Salter [who
had been present at one of the earlier sittings] a most
sympathetic sitter, and again repeated that he personally had
been quite wiUing to continue the S.P.R. test sittings. Mrs.
Bradley suggested that he might try again with them later on,
and VaUantine repUed that he might do so on his return from
America in three months' time. Lady Troubridge and I did
76 V. J. WoolUy. [part
our best to convince him in every wa)^ of the friendly and fair
attitude and intentions of the Society, \ve think ^vith some
success.
Mr. Valiantine has a hirge gold front tooth—a most useful
beacon in observing whether or no his lips are closed.
IV. Note by Lady Troubridge.
Two points struck us some time after the above sittings
regarding which we shoiild have liked to question Mr. Valian-
tine, but we have not since had the opportunity of seeing him.
The first point is why, in view of the fact that at the dark
seances the trumpets are used with the wide end towards the
sitter's ear and the narrow or mouthpiece end to^^'ards the
supposed communicators, the reverse should be the case at
the daylight sittings, when the mouthpiece of the trumpet is
placed to the sitter's ear and the broad end is apparently
the " receiver " of voices and raps.
The second point is : In view of the fact that we were told
it was important to concentrate darkness ^\'ithin the trumpet,
A\'hy does IVIr. Valiantine sit so that the ^^•ide end of the
trumjoet—the least easy to cover—should be towards the strong
light of the window. If the medium M^ould sit sideways to, or
facing the light—or, alternativel3% if the trumpet \vere used as
<at the dark seances with its wide end towards the sitter,
keeping the interior dark -would be a comparatively easy
jnatter—also, the wide end of the trumpet being towards the
medium tends to collect extraneous sounds such as the move-
ments of the medium, rustling of his clothes, and wliilp tli<i
fact remains that unless the medium utters the words heard in
the trumpet, their existence remains unexjjlained, the wide end
of the trumpet being towards the medium might give rise to
sus]3icion in the event of inadequate light, or of the sitter
being doubtful of his powers of observation. In future experi-
ments we would therefore suggest to Mr. Valiantine that he
should trj and sit with the trumijet in the normal jjosition,
i.e. mouthpiece toAvards himself and the window and wide end
towards the darkness and the sitter's ear.
Una V. Troubridge.
97.] Sittings with Mr. George Valiantine. 77
The last sitting of our series was a daylight sitting given
to Mr. DingAvall and myself on April 7, and the conditions
were the same as those of the one last described by Lady
Troiibridge.
Both of us heard raps which seemed similar to those she
has described, but as I wish only to deal in this account with
evidential utterances I do not propose to consider them in
further detail. Both of us also heard whispering sounds,
apparently m the trumpet, at times when we are con-
vinced that Mr. Valiantine 's lips were entirely closed, and
I was able also to distinguish the words " Father WooUey,"
but nothing further.
In considering the series as a whole there is very little
that can be added to the accoiint given by Lady Trou-
biidge and Miss Radclyft'e-Hall, who, indeed, received the
only evidential communications, and who have included in
their account the necessary commentary. The remarkable
incident that closed the last dark sitting is very difficult
to account for on any theory, and it is much to be
regretted that Mr. Bradley's impetuous misinterpretation of
the facts brought the sittuig to an end before the error
could be properly elucidated.
It is, however, certain that the speaking intelligence
which called itself Feda did actually mistake another
sitter for the Miss Walker who had been expected, and
it is possible to suppose that it may have been influenced
to do so by a belief in the mind of the medium or of some
sitter that Miss Walker had actually been introduced under
a pseudonym. The powerful effect which such beliefs have
ujDon mediumistic communications is well established in the
recent paper by Mr. S. G. Soal ^ on a series of sittings
with another direct voice medium.

A REPORT ON A SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH
THE MEDIUM MARGERY.
By E. J. Dingwall.
FOREWORD.
Before dealing with my experienpes of the Margery
mediumship, I wish publicly to express my thanks to
certain persons who rendered those experiences possible.
Firstly then, I wish to thank Margery herself for so
kindly permitting me to attend the sittings as a privi-
leged guest, and also to F. H., the husband of the
medium, I wish likewise to express my appreciation of
his kindly hospitality. To Mrs. Aiigustus Hemenway
also I must tender my sincerest thanks for her royal
hospitality and kindness, without which this inquiry
could never have been attempted. I also wish to acknow-
ledge gratefully the encouragement, advice, and other help
so freely given me by Dr. Elwood Worcester, Dr. Gardner
Murphy, Dr. Mark Richardson, and others too numerous
to mention.
It will be understood that the sittings to be described
were placed by Dr. Crandon under my supervision, sub-
ject to certain agreed conditions which I will in due course
describe.
80 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
INTRODUCTION.
Preliminary.
The following report concerns a case of alleged physical
mediumship, which is perhaps the most important of its
kind hitherto presented for the consideration of psychical
researchers. It first attracted my immediate attention on
December 16, 1923, when the medium, Mrs. L. R. G.
Crandon (hereafter called Margery) and her husband (here-
after called F. H.) visited London and held a sitthig in
my room at the Society for Psychical Research. At this
sitting occurred a table levitation in full white light which
was capable of but two interpretations. The first hypo-
thesis was that the movement was due to some super-
normal action, and the second was that it was caused
normally by the medium, by her husband, by both in
combination, or by one or more of the sitters. Now this
levitation was very striking, and, if fraudulent, involved
some skill in its performance. If supernormal, on the
other hand, the phenomenon was important as an indi-
cation of remarkable incipient mediumship, and from that
date I followed the case as far as I was able to do so
from published accounts and from letters received at in-
tervals from the United States. My interest in the case
grew rapidly when I learnt that Margery had entered for
the $2500 prize offered by the Scientific American maga-
zine. Throughout the summer of 1924 I had been trying
to see whether arrangements could be made for me to
visit the United States in order to call upon the medium
and make a first hand acquaintance with the phenomena
occurring in her presence. This was finally made possible
through the great kindness and generosity of one of our
Boston members, well known for her sustained and
impartial interest in the scientific aspect of psychical
research.
Before deahng with the sittings I attended, short bio-
graphical sketches of the parties concerned may be of
interest, and for this purpose I have received permission
98] ivitli the Medium Margery. 81
from P. H. to insert those supplied by him to the Journal
of the A.S.P.R., March 1925.
Mina Stinson Crandon was born near Toronto and received
her early training and education there. Her health and psy-
chology have always been normal. She graduated with good
standing in all her classes. She had one year of Latin and
one year of French, but outside of that has studied no
languages.
At about the age of seventeen she came to Boston and
became secretary to one of the larger churches. She is married
and has one child, and is in perfect health physically and
mentaUy.
She was five years younger than her brother Walter, who
passed over in 1911 at the age of twenty-eight years. He was
injured by a locomotive and survived the injury only three
hours.
In his youth Walter Stinson had tables tilt and levitate, in
his presence, in daylight. This was looked on as a diversion
and never taken seriously. His mother, who is still living,
over seventy-five years of age, has been able for years to do
automatic writing.
Since this mediumship began, Margery has continued to be
in apparently perfect health and suffers some, but not great,
reaction after sittings which involve deep trance and the so-
called higher physical phenomena.
Dr. L. R. G. Crandon was born in Boston. His mother
came from a healthy, energetic family from Maine ; her brother
was Rear-Admiral J. E. Pillsbury, U.S. Navy. Her father's
family came from Plymouth, Mass., a direct descendant from
twenty-three of the origmal Mayfloiver passengers. His great-
grandfather was Collector of the Port of Plymouth for thirty
years, appomted by Washington. His father is President of
the Boston Ethical Society.
Dr. Crandon graduated from Harvard CoUege in 1894, re-
ceived his M.D. degree m 1898, and an A.M. from Harvard
in Philosophy m 1909. He has been, and still is, in the
practice of surgery m Boston. He is m no way psychic, but
is deeply interested in the matter from the points of view of

The early history of the Margery mediumship is described
by Dr. Crandon in the same number of the Journal as
follows :
Margery's husband first became interested in psychical re-
search in 1923 when he read On the Threshold of the Unseen,
by Sir William Barrett, and Crawford's four books on the
reality of psychic phenomena.
About June 1, 1923, a rough wooden table without nails,
after the specifications of Crawford, was made for the " Margery
"
household, and six people sat round it in red light as an
experiment. Successful tilting was obtained almost at once,
and by the simple process of ehmtnation it was found to occur
only in the presence of Margery, though she need not be
in contact with the table. A code of communication with the
possible operators was at once estabhshed, and apparent identity
of several discarnate relatives of the people about the table was
made out.
The mediumship developed rapidly, involvmg complete levi-
tation of table in red hght, and then appeared in rapid suc-
cession aU the varieties of phenomena which occurred in the
presence of the Reverend Stainton Moses, and others pecuHar
to this mediumship alone. This hst includes the foUowuig
categories, there bemg several varieties under each heading :
1. A great variety of raps, varying in force from the tap of
'
a finger-nail to the kick of a heavy boot
;
2. Raps which answer questions coherently through a code
of about eight words ;
3. Lights two to five inches in diameter shown to some or
all sitters, pale, non-radiant, non-illummating, extremely mobile ;
4. Scents of many odours, like perfumes, and one an ap-
parent combination unlike any known to the sitters ;
5. Musical sounds—chimes, bugles, clock-beUs, and other
instruments, though none was in the room ;
6. Trance-writing in nine languages.
7. Movement of furniture, smashing of the cabinet, lifting tlie
table Avith a sitter on it, balancing of unequally loaded scales
with a celluloid cover
;
8. Passage of matter through matter ;
the apport of roses
and of a live pigeon ;
98] with the Medium Margery. 83
9. The direct independent voice of Walter, the control
;
proved to be independent by simple and fraud-proof methods ;
10. The production of teleplasm in the red light, and flash-
light photographs of it in the midst of red light ;
handUng of
these masses m red light by the sitters ;
11. (Telekmesis) movements of lumuious objects by the tele-
plastic terminals, visible to all sitters.
In July and August, 192.3, trance appeared with trance-
speakmg and trance-writmg, but stopped December 1, 1923, and
was not seen agam until January, 1925. December 1, 1923,
and for the thirteen months followmg, all occurrences were
without trance, the psychic talking freely and enjoying the
sittmg as well as the others. In September, 1923, the first
efforts at mdependent voice were heard. This quickly became
standardised into an easily heard loud whisper, commg mostly
from the cabinet but repeatedly, for special guests, being heard
ui other parts of the room as far away as eight feet from the
psychic : in other words, a truly independent voice, never
automatic, in the opmion of constant observers. This direct
independent voice made communication with Walter, the
control, so easy that systematic development of the phenomena
followed rapidly. Each sitting now presents, as it Avere, a
cross section of the whole story of psychic research. The
voice prophesies or promises the physical phenomenon, then,
under test conditions, the thing occurs as promised. New
physical experiments and tests are proposed to Walter, he
discusses them with the sitters, he agrees with them as to
what conditions should surround the tests and is, himself,
apparently intrigued by new apparatus and pleased to get a
hard problem.
The investigation of the Scientific American Committee^
had begun in the spring of 1924, and owing principally to
the action of one of its members much acrimonious discussion
had arisen and the sittings had been suspended. This discus-
sion was at its height when I arrived, and the medium and
her husband appeared to be in a highly nervous condition.
Before detailing my experiences, I wish to give my
impression of the principal characters. The medium,
1 See Scientific American, July, August, November, 1924, and Mr. J. M.
Bird's book Margery (Boston, 1925).
84 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
Margery, is a highly intelligent and charming young
woman, exceedingly good natured and possessed of a fund
of humour and courage which make her an ideal subject
for investigation. Her husband is a hard-working and
skilful surgeon, of wide reading, and possessing extensive
knowledge of many social questions and problems. If
Margery's mediumshij) is in fact fraudulent (and there is
little, if any, direct evidence in support of such a sup-
position) it is, I think, j)i'actically certain that F. H. fully
acquiesces, if he does not actively assist in the fraud.
The deception (if such there be) could not possibly succeed
without both his manual dexterity and his tenacity of
j)urpose. The question of motive, in view of F. H.'s
professional and social standing, is a difficult one. It would
perhaps seem incredible that he should take part in a hoax,
for any purpose inconsistent with what he considered the
interests of scientific truth. It is, I think, however, just
possible that a hoax designed to test the gullibility of
observers, and to discredit what he might consider
" Spiritualistic su2)erstition " would appeal to his fervent
rationalism.
To say that the Margery mediumship is one of the most
important of its kind would be an understatement : it is,
I think, the most remarkable hitherto recorded. For we
have here not only alleged telekinetic and teleplastic pheno-
mena, but also the occurrence of what is claimed to be
a truly independent voice, which is heard throughout the
sitting and which controls the phenomena, foretelling or
promising a phenomenon, which in many cases is produced as
promised.
But the difficulties of investigating it are correspond-
ingly great : they can only be appreciated in full by those
who have had practical experience of them. I did not
succeed in achieving my primary purpose, of coming to a
definite conclusion as to the genuineness or otherwise of
the phenomena. During the course of the sittings the
evidence seemed to me at one time for, and at another
time against their supernormal nature, but never to incline
decisively either way. It was always necessary to hold
both hypotheses in view and to modify the procedure from
98] with the Medium Margery. 85
time to time according as one or other hypothesis appeared
the more probable. In the Report that follows I have
endeavoured to set out fairly and fully the facts as I saw
them and to give the reasons which led me to waver in
my views as to the nature of the phenomena, in the hope
that this may be of assistance to future investigators.
These two hypotheses will in the rest of this Report be
referred to as the "first" and the "second" hjrpothesis
respectively, and at the risk of repetition I wish to em-
phasise the fact that whenever the results of any sitting
are discussed on the basis or from the angle of either
hypothesis, it must not be assumed that I, or any other
sitters, in fact, accept that hypothesis as covering such
results in the sense that the hypothesis is considered fully
satisfactory in all essential particulars.
The Present Investigation.
Before detailing the general conditions obtaining at the
sittings it may be found convenient to sketch briefly the
position of the case when I arrived in Boston.
The investigation of the Scientific American magazine
had reached a dead-lock. F. H. was strongly ojjposed to
the members of the Committee, and although Professor
McDougall had been a member of that Committee, the
request that he should collaborate with Dr. Worcester and
myself was readily granted by both F. H. and Margery,
although I could see that their feelings had in no wise
changed. It was also agreed that Dr. and Mrs. Mark
Richardson should be occasional sitters, as they were
friendly with Margery and her husband, and Dr. Richard-
son's position in Boston entitled him to respect.
Having arranged the personnel of the inquiry, the other
conditions had to be discussed. Since the absence of any
suitably equipped laboratory compelled me to accept the
sittings in the house in Lime Street, where Margery lives,
it was at once apparent that minor phenomena had to be
discounted to a large extent. Although the room was
open at all times to a search, it was so encumbered with
furnishings that any feeling of certainty regarding its
innocence had to be abandoned. The next great difficulty
86 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
arose regarding the control of the medium during the
sittings. F. H. and Margery vehemently opposed a con-
trol of one of the medium's hands by one or other of my
collaborators, and as it appeared useless to insist upon
conditions disliked by the psychic at the very starting
point of what might prove an excellent investigation, I
examined their objections carefully and, after having what
I considered confirmatory evidence from independent
sources, I decided that the best plan was to sit quietly
under the conditions approved of by the medium and
await results. It was thus agreed that during many of
the sittings I was to control the left hand of the medium
and P. H. the right, but obviously for the purposes of
flawless evidence this hand control of F. H. must be re-
garded as non-existent.
If it be asked for what purpose this laxity of control
was permitted I should answer that it is of no use trying
to investigate i^henomena except under conditions which
make their occurrence possible, and whether supernormal
or not they are unlikely to occur under conditions dis-
pleasing to the medium. It may, therefore, be wise to
begin with imperfect control which, when j)henomena occur,
it may be possible to improve. It may, moreover, happen
that the phenomena that occur are of such a nature that
demonstration of their genuineness or falsity does not
depend on the weak j)oint in the control. And it was in
fact my primary aim to secure phenomena, the super-
normality of which would be self-evident from their very
nature.
GENEPvAL ACCOUNT OP THE SITTINGS.
The Seance Room.
The room used by Margery for the experiments was
formerly a sort of lounge and book den at the top of the
house. It measures approximately 18 feet 1 inch x 17 feet
and is 9 feet high (5-48 m. x 5-18 m. x 2-74 ni.). The ac-
companying diagram (Fig. 1) shows a rough plan of the
room and general arrangements. D is a pair of doors
98] with the Medium Margery. 87
leading into the upper landing secured by a lock and
turnmg upon hinges which permit the doors to swing clear
of the floor by a wide margin. F is the fireplace, and
on the mantelpiece is the lamp L, controlled by a rheostat
R. This lamp consisted of a ruby bulb enclosed in a black
tapering wooden box arrangement and over the front of
the box were a few sheets of white tissue paper to diffuse

the light. C is the cabinet measuring 4 feet x 3 feet x 6
feet high (1-21 m. x 91 cm. x 1-82 m.), and M the medium's
mahogany chair of Windsor pattern with arms. The legs
were 19 inches square (48 cm.) on the floor, the side
rungs beuig 4| inches (12 cm.) clear of the floor, and the
front and back 8 inches (20 cm.). The thickness of the
seat was IJ inches (3 cm.), its widest part 21^ inches
(53 cm.), and deepest 17 inches (43 cm.). The back was just
22 inches high measured from the seat, and the weight over
88 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
13 lbs. (5-8 kg). "Domes of Silence" were fitted to each
leg, and the chair was usually just within the cabinet, the
back of which was about 3 feet Sins. (Ml m.) from the doors.
W indicates a row of windows looking on to Lime Street,
and shaded with blinds and curtains, whilst B is a long
book case filled with books occupying almost the entire
length of the room. T is the seance table made of soft
pine and measuring roughly 2 feet 6 inches x 1 foot 8
inches x2 feet 3 inches high (76 cm. x 50 cm. x 68 cm.),
before which Margery is usually seated, F. H.'s place being
between her and the rheostat, R.
The cameras which were employed at the sittings were
managed entirely by Mr. R. W. Conant, of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, and I wish here to record
my thanks to him for so skilfully succeeding in a difficult
task, and also to Mrs. Dennett through whose generosity
materials were purchased and the use of a stereoscopic
camera made possible.
Conduct of the Seances.
Before dealing with the general method of conducting
the seances, it will be here convenient to print as it
stands and to analyse as far as is possible the conditions
drawn uj^ by F. H., which were demanded as a preliminary
to my having any sittings at all. These conditions, which
are exceedingly important when viewed in the light of our
two hypotheses, were as follows :
(1) It is understood that the name. " Walter " is applied to
the personaLity which manifests in the seance room, purports
to be the deceased brother of the medium, and operates as
the " spirit control," without in any way bmdmg any signer
hereof to any particular interpretation of the true character of
this personality.
It is agreed between tlie investigator and the doctor that :
(2) Neither the investigator nor any of his agents shall turn
on any light m the seance room except with the prior know-
ledge and expressed consent of Walter.
(3) The investigator shall supply the doctor with a signed copy
of his notes of each seance, before he attends the next seance.
98] with the Medium Margery. 89
(4) These notes shall, withm the investigator's best memory,
mclude every fact with relation to the phenomena and the
accompanying circumstances which he regards as in any way
important. This is not intended to imply that the investigator
need say anjrthing about causes in these notes ; but it is
understood nevertheless that if at the end of any seance he is
convinced that he has discovered fraud, he must say so in his
notes. The doctor understands that if there is in the investi-
gator's mind merely the possibility of fraud, he is under no
obhgation to record this in his notes.
(5) Subject to Walter's approval, the investigator shall be in
charge of the personnel and procedure at all seances ;
except
that the doctor shall not be excluded without his consent, and
that the investigator shall introduce no sitters without the
doctor's approval.
Now, regarded superficially, these conditions appear to be
reasonable, just, and carefully edited. Nos. 1 and 2 can
at once be granted, but upon studying the others it is
seen that they may facilitate simulated phenomena.
Thus if the phenomena are not supernormal, (3) gives
the other parties full information as to the discoveries
made by the investigator. For example, if a touch is
experienced in the third seance, and the iiavestigator re-
marks certain facts which lead him to suppose that a
reaching rod is being employed, then these facts must
become the property of one of the persons concerned in
the manipulation of that rod before the next sitting. These
persons can in this way keep themselves au fait with all
the investigator's discoveries, and since they are virtually in
entire charge of the sittings (notwithstanduag clause 5) dis-
covery of the methods employed is rendered absolutely im-
possible unless the phenomena are produced so crudely as to
invite instant detection. Thus in my sittings I never detected
anything that could positively be called fraud, and I think
the majority of Margery's investigators are in the same
position. It does not in the least follow, however, that
because fraud is not detected it does not exist. It may
well be that the conditions insisted on by the medium and
her husband render that detection a virtual impossibility.
On the other hand, it has been urged that F. H. has been
90 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
driven to make these conditions in order to safeguard the
honour and safety of his wife and of himself, and m par-
ticular to prevent second thoughts being substituted for
original impressions in the records of the sittings when
signed by the observers.
In accepting these conditions I was fully cognisant of
their shortcomings and of the criticisms which could so
easily be levelled against them. But it seemed better to
accept what was offered than to commence the series by
objections and refusals. The fact that the seances were to
be held in the medium's house, and that the medium's
husband was often to be allowed to control her on one side,
robbed them of so much evidential value that it did not
seem worth while to insist upon what were, after all, less
important details.
The Sittings.
The sittings themselves I divide into two groups (a) what
I shall call the official series at which were generally present
as observers Professor McDougall, Dr. Elwood Worcester,
and myself, and (6) the ordmary seances, which I shall
call private sittings, where I was a friend assisting with
others, but at which the control was slightly more rigid
than that to which Margery had usually been accustomed.
The sittings are usually held in darkness. That this con-
stitutes a grave weakness is obvious. Red light is permitted
only at the dictation of the controlling voice,^ wliich claims
that periods of darkness are necessary for the purposes of
incubation.
Sitting I. {Private).
December 30, 1924. 10 Lime Street, Boston. 8.55 p.m.
Present {in. order of place commencing from Margery's right
hand as she sits in the cabinet) :
^ P. H. ; Mrs. J. De
Wyckoff ; Dr. Mark Richardson ; Mr. Fred Adler ; Mr. J.
De Wyckoff ; Mi-s. Richardson ; E. J. D. ; Mr. J. M.
Bird sits just behind F. H. and Margery.
1 This voice claims to be independent in the sense that it is not the
medium who speaks.
2 This order is kept throughout the following series of sittings.
98] ~
with the Medium Margery. '91
This was a friendly group arranged for the occasion, so that
I might have the opportunity of observing the general condi-
tions of the sittings. The medium sat in the cabinet, and
before her was placed the seance table already described on
p. 88, whilst on the table was placed the bell box which had
been introduced as a test apparatus by the Scientific American
Committee.^ This box was placed upon the table, its longer
side parallel with the same side of the table and the opening
of the flap facing F. H. Two small megaphones, one with a
luminous band, stood at the right side of the medium's chair.
These were \0\ inches (27 cm.) high, the circumference of the
larger ends being about 23 inches (57"5cm.), and the smaller
7J inches (18 cm.) respectively.
We commenced with darkness, and the voice and light
whisthng soon began. The control varied throughout the
sitting ; sometimes I had Margery's left hand and both
feet, sometimes both hands and both feet, or again both
hands and one foot. After about a quarter of an hour the
bell rang, and this was done repeatedly both in darkness
and red Hght. It also rang when I raised it from the table
in red light, and continued ringing as I held it and moved it
almost beyond the left hand wing of the cabinet. 'V^Tien the
red light was on I remarked that the flap was lowered beyond
its normal level, and when the bell rang the flap did not seem
to be depressed but merely shivered.
1 See J. M. Bird, op. cit., pp. 287-292 ; 392-404 ; 469-484. This
device, the details of which had already itndergone many changes, was
of the simplest possible construction. It consisted essentially of a pad-
locked box containing a battery and electric bell, which could only be
rung normally hy pressure upon a hinged flap upon the top, which was
furnished with the necessary contacts, and was normally held apart by
a long steel spring screwed to the top of the box. The box was made
of stained pine and measured 14 inches (35 cm.) x 8J inches (21 cm.) x 5
J
inches (13 cm.) high ; the flap was of unpolished soft pine and measiired
8 inches (20 cm.) square. The contacts were of copper and the steel
spring measured 7J inches (20 cm.) long. This spring had been sub-
stituted for another spiral spring, which had apparently been formerly
used and which had been loosely placed under the board. The flap had
previously been fastened to the base on the top of the box by a velvet
strip, which had been detached several times as fresh experiments had
been made. The whole apparatus weighed about 8 Ibsa (36 kg.), and a
brass lock and Yale padlock completed the outfit.
92 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
A voice was also heard from apparently inside one of the
megaphones which was raised and touched my nose, and soon
afterwards Mi's. Richardson experienced a touch upon her right
arm and shoulder, whilst almost immediately I did the same.
It seemed like the gentle pressure of two fingers, the distance
from the medium being about two feet.
The phenomena at this sitting were typical of the ordinary
occurrences with Margery's mediumship. We have (1) the
voice, (2) telekinetic movements both connected with the voice
and inde23endent of it, (3) action at a distance in darkness and
red light, and (4) touches. Disregarding the voice for the
moment, we have mainly telekinetic movements of the mega-
phone and the ringmg of the bell box which can be considered
together. A great weakness m the conduct of the Margery
sittings is the insistence of periods of darkness by the control.
Assuming genuineness, this may be explicable on the assump-
tion that smce the mediumship was developed along these lines
it was difficult to change it. But on the second hypothesis of
trickery such periods of darkness provide intervals not of in-
cubation but of preparation, so that the observers can finally
see the presentation of a finished phenomenon. It was ap-
parent to me at this first sittmg that this difficulty would be
almost insurmountable for two reasons. Fhstly, if the pheno-
mena were genuine, the training involved before the darkness
could be dispensed with would probably take up the whole
available time at my disi^osal, and secondly, if they were
produced by trickery, the suggestion would be resisted and
further difficulties would arise. The methods of dealing with
such suggestions by F. H. and Margery are of some interest.
The medium will, as a general rule, accept any control or any
suggestion within reason, but at the same time she reserves to
herself the right of disclaiming responsibility for any negative
results that may ensue, asserting that it is the control
Walter and not herself who produces the phenomena, and
that he must be consulted and not she. This is reasonable if
the phenomena are in fact genuine, but if they are fraudulent
the device constitutes a convenient method of escape, as when
pressed by suggestions which are distasteful to him, Walter
either makes promises Avhich are never fulfilled, or turns the
thing into a joke Avith a series of droll witticisms, at which
98] ivith the Medium Margery. 93
he is both skilled and highly amusing. During the coiirse of
the sittings I tried a number of these experiments, and the
results may i^rove instructive when viewed from the angle
either of behef or scepticism. In the present sitting the period
of darkness prevailed before the ringing of the bell and at
intervals after it. The most impressive phenomenon was the
touch on my shoulder. Although I constantly asked the
control for fm-ther examples of touching, this was the one
occasion only upon which such phenomena occurred. The
ringing of the bell box in red light was good, and had I
intended to continue its use, I should have made a complete
study of it. But the apparatus was too clumsy to be of any
particular service and little information could have been ob-
tained from its use.
Sitting II. (Official).
January 1, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.25 p.m.
Present (in order from medium's right hand) : F. H. ; Dr. E.
Worcester (W.) ; Professor McDougaU (M.) ; E. J. D.
This was the iirst of the official series. A small family
group had sat the night before, but with negative results.
For the purpose of control over the medium's head, hands, and
anlfles, she wore a luminous disc on her forehead attached to
a tape tied round her head, and luminous wristlets made out
of broad elastic around her wists, similar rings being placed
around her ankles.
The phenomena at this sitting consisted mainly of table
movements. Some of these were strUimg and difficult to
account for normally, assuming the existence of control of both
hands and feet of the medium. Nothing, however, occurred
which deserves comment at any length. Both before, during,
and after this seance, Margery appeared unwell and depressed.
Sitting III. (Official).
January 2, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.42 p.m.
Present : As in Sitting II. and same order.
It had been arranged that at the conclusion of every sitting
the notes should be compiled by the observers, F. H. acting as
amanuensis for the group. In the following sitting these notes
94 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
will be printed as they were written except that here and there
some minor alterations have been made for the sake of
clarity.
The general conditions were the same as before, except that
the medium had discarded a portion of her garments and was
clothed in a thick woollen bath-robe and stockings. Luminous
letters pinned on the cuffs of F. H. and E. J. D. were for the
purpose of allowing M. and W. to see the approximate positions
of their hands. Hands were joined round the circle.
On the table were placed a twelve-cymbaled tambourine Avith
a luminous T painted upon the membrane ; a ukulele with a
luminous U painted upon it on one side ; a small luminous
ring about 1^ inches in diameter, and a black handkerchief
upon which was painted a crude representation of a grimiing
face in luminous paint, Avhich had been named by the previous
circle the " Houdini Handkerchief."
The following is the record of the sitting made by F. H.
by dictation from the group :
Phenomena began with vague noises apparently caused
by some of the objects on the table. The luminous T
and ring were occluded several times by what seemed to
be an opaque object passing above them. Dr. W.'s hand
was touched by a hard object, which appeared to be the
handle of the ukulele. Tambourine was raised a few inches
into the air, fell on Dr. W.'s hand, and rested there for
some five minutes. Houdini handkerchief moved shghtly,
and part of it apparently rested over the ukulele. Ukulele
was raised some eight inches above the table ; it appeared
first to lie flat in air, then to stand upright, so that the
U was clearly visible. Houdini handkerchief was moved
so that the features showed motion ; mouth appeared to
open three times (Dr. W.). Ukulele raised into air, verti-
cally, handle downwards, facing McD. and D. at west
judged that handle was clear of table. Then shghtly
turned round, and twanged in the air. Psyche (F. H.'s
name for the medium) complained of pain in right arm
and side, described in terms of biting sensation. Followed
by pain in side ; then trance. Three phases of trance,
with revivals of consciousness between. During trance
;
with the Medium Margery. 95
ukulele twanged certainly, and probably moved somewhat.
Short trance period -with no action ;
pause in seance at 10.30.
Pause lasted about five minutes. Slight rustlings on
table and movements of Houdini handkerchief. Followed
by tippings of table away from Psyche towards Dr. W.
Followed by complete levitation of table. During move-
ments of table in some cases it was noticed that luminous
bands about Psyche's ankles and wrists were motionless ;
and Dr. W. reports that he controlled the right leg of
F. H., which was not in contact with the table. Levita-
tion of table involved apparent lifting, horizontally, into
air to a minimum height of six inches, all legs o£E floor.
West end then rose higher, four feet from floor ; red light
turned on and table found resting on the psychic's knee
and shoulder, top at angle of some 45 degrees with hori-
zontal, lower legs at least 14 inches off floor. Uncertain
whether resting natm^ally or not. Light off almost at
once. Table descended, at first slowly, then Avith bang
on floor. Table tilted towards Dr. W., came doAvn heavily
on its side ; then sloAvly and intermittently raised back
into normal position. Light turned on and table found
nearly horizontal, resting on arms of D.'s chair. Light off
at once. Table tilted towards east, falling upon F. H.'s
foot heavily.
Conversation with Walter about future arrangements.
Closed at 11.5.
Control : Luminous bands sewn on MTists of Psyche's
bath robe and on stockings, about ankles. White tape
about forehead, in centre of which sewn a luminous disc.
Luminous D on lower right sleeve of D., luminous C on
lower left sleeve of F. H. Psyche's right foot, shoeless,
resting on F. H.'s left foot, according to his report ; and
her left foot according to D.'s, under his shoeless foot,
excejDt for a few seconds when coming out of trance. A
cushion was placed in front of the psychic on the floor
upon which her feet were placed. Hands held on either
side.

96 Beport on a Series of Sittings [part
The phenomena occurring at this sitting were mainly of the
telekinetic variety, and the opaque object which was seen to
pass over the luminous T upon the tambourine and over the
ring indicated that some material structure was at work.
During the first part of the sitting the medium fell into what
may be called trance, assuming that this was not simulated.
The head fell back and the body became limp, these states
alternating between different periods of apparent consciousness.
The movements of the table Avere very curious, and are diffi-
cult to account for on normal grounds. Had F. H. not been
present, and had the medium's feet and hands been adequately
controlled on either side, it would have been difficult to escape
from regarding these movements as supernormal. It is clear
from the record that the only hands and feet that we can
reasonably consider j^artially available were F. H.'s left hand
and left foot and Margery's right hand and right foot. The
luminous anlilet rendered any extensive use of her right foot
difficult, and similarly the luminous C on F. H.'s left cuff
prevented too free use of his left hand unless the hand had
been altogether withdrawn frojn the sleeve.

This was a sitting held away from the medium's house in
the Boston residence of Mr. and Mi-s. Augustus Hemenway.
A room had been chosen which was partially empty, and a
rude cabinet made out of a three-winged screen erected with
its back to the wmdow. Over the screen a black silk gown
had been flung ; the room darkened ; a thick red paper shade
placed over the electric lamp, and the victrola put outside the
door and connected to an electric motor. A plain painted
table similar in size to that at Lime Street stood in front of
the cabinet. The medium wore wristlets, anklets, and head
disc as usual. F. H. and E. J. D. also wore wristlets. The
other sitters wore no bands. On the table were the luminous
ring, tambourine, and ukulele. F. H.'s record reads thus ;
98] with the Medium Margery. 97
Walter came through in a few minutes and had a more
or less lengthy conversation mth Mr. Dingwall as to the
details of the next few sittings. He promised something
so unprecedented and amazing that we were quite over-
whelmed by it. He gave us instructions, however, not to
put this promise on paper, or to tell anyone. He then
gave minute details as to what to do and what not to do
on this great occasion, and then went on to the work of
the evening.
The control was by means of the illuminated bands on
wrists of everyone [this is incorrect, see above] and on
ankles of Psyche and her head also (as before). Under
these conditions, with all hands obviously inert, Walter
lifted the tambourine and ukulele from six to fourteen
inches many times. He did a lot of work with the table,
in the way of tilting and levitation, and best of all,
allowed Mr. Dingwall to hold up his thumb on edge of
table, whereupon Walter put the centre of the tambourine,
balancing it thus on the thumb perfectly on request of
Mr. DingwaU. Mi-. Dingwall was then allowed to hold the
tambourine in one hand, and Walter then pulled on it and
twisted it in any directions asked by Mr. Dingwall. Mi".
Dingwall said this he had tried for in many places all over
the world, but never before had it. The pull he estimated
at two and one half to five pounds.
Sitting closed at 11.55 p.m.
As before the sitting represents a fair specimen of
Margery's mediunisliip. Moreover, the seance shows good
progress when regarded from the point of view of the
first hypothesis. Certain manipulations of a ring and of
tlie tambourine showed no dexterity, although the levita-
tion of the former was quite impressive. At one time the
tambourine rose near the corner of the table nearest to
the medium's left hand, which I was controlling. It rose
some inches above the surface of the table ; then it moved
towards the edge, sank beneath the projecting end and
remained apparently suspended, having passed over the
medium's hand and mine during its movement. This inci-
dent remains the most interesting of all the examples of
98 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
alleged telekinetic phenomena that I witnessed with
Margery, althongh the attempts to balance the ring on
the end of my finger were also curious, and only suc-
ceeded after repeated attempts. The tambourine appeared
to be held fairly rigidly, and although I have many
times tried to experiment on levitated objects alleged to
be supported by supernormal structures, I never succeeded
to the extent that seemed possible at the sitting. I tried
on the tambourine, pull, push and torsion, it seemed as if
it were held by some elastic structure, and my sensation
was similar to the one I exjierienced with another medium
under better conditions of control. The experiments with
the ring also were highly instructive, supplemented as they
were by the more advanced series with the tambourine. It
would appear that, upon the first hypothesis, the support-
ing structures were being manipulated with but slight skill,
and upon the second that the appearances were being
cunningly simulated to give the observers the impression
of clumsy manipulation.
The conversation with Walter at the commencement of
the sitting was obviously insj)ired by my own plans which
I had partially discussed with F. H. These plans centred
around the observation of the actual mechanism of tele-
kinesis. Walter promised assistance in this respect, and
his promise was connected with an attempt to show us
the comjjlete emergence and subsequent disappearance of
the teleplastic substance. I of course supported him in this
and discussed it in some detail ; a point which it may
prove useful to remember in dealing with the succeeding
sittings. It must be remembered that, as I said before,
it was my j^rimary aim to secure phenomena, the super-
normality of which would be seh-evident from their very
nature. The ap^Jearance of living, mobile substance emerg-
ing from the body of the medium, followed by the sub-
sequent formations of definite shaj)es out of an amorphous
mass would fulfil these expectations to a very considerable
extent.
The chief question which now occitpied my|^ immediate
attention was the best attitude with which to approach
such phenomena. It appeared to me that some sort of
98] with the Medium Margery. 99
hypothesis would have to be adopted. The attitude of
suspended judgment is one which, viewed in its proper
aspect, seems the reasonable one to adopt in nearly all
of the debatable questions with which science is called
upon to deal. But as working hypothesis it is often ill-
adapted to the purposes of psychical research. For example,
such an attitude is often irritating to the sensitive subject,
who fails to understand the reasons for which it has been
adopted. Hence it appeared to me that it might be as
well to take either the first or the second hypothesis as
the working hypothesis, and then see how the facts sup-
ported the theory as develoj)ment proceeded. After taking
full account of the previous history of the mediumship,
the personahties of the medium and her husband, and any
other facts that seemed to me relevant, I decided to adopt
the first hypothesis to work on.
In the succeeding sittings I hope to show how far the
result of the seances fulfilled my expectations. It will be
indicated how the phenomena developed along orderly and
progressive lines ; how at times the probability of the first
hypothesis became so strong that it seemed likely that it
would prove a "true" interpretation of the facts ; how the
development ceased just when a continuation would have
led to decisive results, and how finally every crucial test
failed.
Sitting V. {Private).
January 5, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.10 p.m. 10-30 p.m.
Present : W. ; Dr. M. Richardson ; Mrs. Richardson ; D.
This was a sitting at which F. H. was not present, and at
which the victrola was not played. I had hoj)ed to obtaua
silhouettes of the telekinetic structures, and for this purj)ose
had jirepared a sheet of cardboard Avith lummous paint, A\iiich
I secured with a couple of stout thumb tacks to the end of
the table facing myself and at right angles to the medium.
There was also a luminous strip upon the top of the table
along the edge nearest the medium and also along the edge of
the two ends. The medium wore luminous wristlets, anklets,
and head disc as before. Dr. Worcester controlled the right
hand and right foot, Avhilst I controlled the left hand and left
100 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
foot. The phenomena obtained at this sitting were exceedingly
interesting. The absence of F. H. was, from the evidential
point of view, an improvement, and consequently phenomena,
which with his presence would have to be discounted, were
impressive and important.
The first occurrence which attracted my attention was the
bending of the cardboard apparently from its medial line and
along its entire length towards myself. I noticed this once,
and upon its repetition asked W. not to bend over the table
as he was bending the board. He replied that he was a foot
away from the edge of the table and had not touched the
cardboard. The movements of the cardboard occurred at
intervals throughout the sitting and there were also a series
of extremely puzzhng table movements. The sitting closed at
10.30 p.m.
This seance was one of the most important of the entire
series, and suggested the authenticity of the phenomena.
Under the conditions obtaining at this sitting I found
it difficult to imagine any normal method for moving the
cardboard, and wished that fiurther opportunities might have
been presented to study it. The board bent along its entire
length, and its thickness was such that pressure at one corner
would scarcely have been siifficient thus to affect it. We must
assume a uniform pressure along the smiace near its upper
edge, but how this could have been successfully applied I am
at a loss to imagine. Similarly the movements of the table
were difficult to explain even assuming that one foot was free,
which W. stated was not the case upon his side, and I feel
fau-ly certain was not the case on mine. Confederacy on the
part of W. and Mr. and Mrs. Richardson I can scarcely enter-
tain, and the phenomena appeared to be evidential, although
obviously too slight to be conclusive. At any rate the results
woukl have to be seriously considered before the validity of the
second hypothesis could be accepted. In this case one must
assume that some adroit manipulation of a rod or some such
piece of apparatus held between the medium's teeth was
responsible for the movements of the cardboard, and that the
medium's use of one foot for two sufficed to free one foot in
order to manipulate the table. Even then I am not sure that
one foot was capable of moving the table to the extent which
98] ivitJi the Medium Margery. ioi
we observed. Although the opportunities afforded at a single
sitting were not sufficient to justify any positive statements
on the matter, I should have been mclined to the supposition
that these phenomena were indeed supernormal had not sub-
sequent events compelled me provisionally to substitute the
hypothesis of trickery for that of genuineness. Whatever then-
explanation (and if trickery were employed it was '
probably
very simple), the events of this sitting were certainly startling,
and if not supernormal indicated great sublety and shrewdness.
Sitting VI. (Official).
January 6, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.40 p.m. 10.20 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D.
The control was as before, but F. H. wore another coat Avith
a luminous band sewn on the left cuff. On the table was a
mechanical press bell, uj^on the knob of which was fastened
a cork and on the top of this a luminous disc. There were
also two luminous rings, one larger (A) than the other (B),
and a small basket with handle and white tissue paper inside.
There were four luminous pins at the top corners of the
basket. The sitting was in darkness except Avhen indicated in
the account.
I had introduced the beU and basket for special reasons.
The use of the beU was to provide a convenient method of
observing A\'hether an alleged psychic structure was capable of
ringing it, and if so, additional evidence might be obtained by
the occlusion of the luminous disc, since the only means of
ringing the bell normally was by striking the press button or
striking the bell itself. In the latter case the sound differed
materially from that made in the former. The basket had
been introduced to discover how far such light objects could
be sviccessfuUy manipulated, and later to try various experi-
ments also Avith Aveights inside the Ijasket, but these Avere never
attempted.
The folloAA'ing is the official record as dictated after the
sitting.
Variation in control this evening, F. H. Avearing another
coat and a broad luminous band on his left Avrist. On
the table : mechanical beU, to knob of AA'hich fastened a
102 Beport 071 a Series of Sittings [PAET
cork, on top of this a luminous disc. Two round luminous
rings, one larger (A) than other (B). Little basket with
handle and inside some white tissue paper. Four luminous
pins on top corners of basket.
Phenomena began by (A) being slightly tipped up, it
being uncertain whether caused by current of air or some
other cause. Then Walter asked D. and W. to move
nearer the table. Soon after this he asked D. to place
his hand, palm upwards. Psyche's hand holding his wrist,
on the surface of the table towards the centre of edge
facing medium. After a few moments D. felt a cold,
viscous, clammy material just touch the nail of his middle
finger, which was shghtly raised above the table. This
touch was almost immediately followed by another on the
ball of the same finger. Then by similar touches over a
larger siu'face of fingers and hand. The substance re-
sembled a cold damjj tongue, which sometimes appeared
to thicken at the end and exert pressure. This pressure
was not as if the whole material were exercising it, but
as if a harder object were covered with a clammy shell,
and the pressure were bemg exerted by it through the
shell (D.). M. put hand across table with Walter's per-
mission ; felt something hke a cold hand flapped on back
of his hand, three or four times. W. would say that it
rested on his hand toward end of his fingers, was drawn
across his fingers ; would compare it to feehng of piece
of cold raw beef or possibly piece of soft, wet rubber.
He should also add that the impact was distinctly audible
as well as tangible. M. verifies this.
All di'ew hands away and relaxed ; Walter asked D. to
]}ut hand on table as j)reviously. Same tongue-lilie struc-
ture was then repeatedly drawn over surface of hand, and
by permission he closed his hand twice over it. It curled
ujD easily within his hand and withdi'ew itself with sinuous
slithering movement. It appeared to D. to be a httle
drier than formerly. D. then asked Walter whether the
substance could touch his knuckle ; on affirmative answer,
he tiu'ned his hand over and what seemed to be a larger
piece of the substance covered first of aU his fingers and
then the back of his hand. Withdrawing itself, it almost
with the Medium Margery. 103
immediately again covered his hand with sharp slap ; and
its end appeared to extend beyond his hand on to ring (A),
the latter being flipped across the table on to the floor.
Sound of slap mentioned was distinctly audible. Visible
as it fell across ring. As heard to fall, M. saw what
might have been long flabby finger fall rapidly across ring,
rapidly withdraw, dragging ring off table.
W. now put his hand over toward that corner of the
table. Back of hand struck smartly twice. This time he
received impression that substance was more massive,
covering a larger portion of his hand and appearmg to be
heavier. He would make it plain that this phenomenon
occurred to him twice ; first time, on side of table toAvard
D. ; second time, when M. and W. retained their contact,
their hands being toward opposite side of table.
Walter then asked for luminous plaque [i.e. cardboard].
This was placed standing upright on the bent edge. D.
then observed after few moments a movement of the edge
of plaque near Psyche. Followed by a mass of black
substance resembling about two inches of the end of a
mittened hand. This projected and withdrew several times ;
finally the mitten-like hand appeared to be sliding across
the sui'face of the table and then rose ujj against the
luminous plaque, showing itself as a curved shape with
slight crook at end. Almost exactly resembUng the hand
structiu:e photographed with Stanislawa P.
W. could only describe (didn't see so much because of
position) an object with a stealthy gliditig motion, appar-
ently along surface of table, at right lower corner of
plaque. This advanced and receded several times ; he
could only describe colour as dark grey or greyish black.
M. while plaque was vertical, saw merely vague opaque
object of rounded form covering lower and distant edge of
plaque.
While basket was standing on front of plaque, mass of
substance crept toward it with a clearly audible sound
flicked basket out of way. It went into Psyche's laj).
The plaque was brought or fell into horizontal position.
M. saw very distinctly black object creeping over its far
edge. D. had asked that it divide itself ; M. now saw
104 Report on a Series of Sittings '[part?
rounded blunt edge of the opaque object projecting and
withdrawing over edge of plaque ; then became distinctly
divided, really looked like very large, clumsy fingers close
together, one a little apart from the others. Then he saw
it again ;
complicated shape, but saw it briefly and cannot
describe in detail. Like eccentric finger shadows.
Short rest period ;
plaque itself upon which basket had
been placed then began to move. Then rose into air
2|-3| inches. Remained floating for a few seconds, fol-
lowed by oscillations, undulations, movement to and fro.
In spite of these movements little basket remained on the
plaque, though one might have supposed it would be dis-
lodged (W.). While this agitation was going on Walter
asked why it had not been made firmer. It then de-
scended slowly on the table. While floating it had moved
nearer to F. H.'s hand, holding Psyche's left.
M. now suggested change in control. Plaque had been
making few movements up and down, projecting over
Psyche's edge of table. Therefore, he short-circuited F. H.,
taking their two hands under his left. Worcester at the
same time short-circuited M. to control F. H.'s hands on
M.'s side. Further plaque movements now occurred.
Lifting of Psyche's end, and certain amount of to and fro
movement. Rustling noise ;
plaque gave further move-
ments, finally toAvards M.'s arm, not far. After a con-
versation with control sitting closed at 10.20.

This sitting was an important one when, considered from
the point of view of what had preceded it. Assuming the
validity of the first hypothesis it is what might have been
expected. We saw in the previous sitting in Clarendon
Street how objects were seized and held as if by elastic
structures intelligently directed. Here the structures be-
came themselves visible and tangible. Teleplastic tele-
kinetics were exemplified in a manner hitherto unrecorded
in the history of psychical research. The reasons given
by the control for this progress was that until then it was
98] with the Medium Margenj. 105
not safe to exhibit these higher phenomena in the unsatis-
factory conditions of the previous investigations. The
substance itself can obviously be compared with that
observed with other mediums, as, for example. Miss
Kathleen Goligher and Mile. Eva Carriere. The slithering
tongue-like fins were similar to the rude claw-lilie terminals
occasionally seen with Willy Schneider, and in this respect
Margery's mediumship resembles his rather than that
of Eva, whose alleged teleplastic faculties were directed
rather towards artistic formations than towards mechanical
work.
The second hypothesis [i.e. of trickery) must now be
considered in the light of the official record printed above.
For the present it must suffice to call the alleged tele-
plastic material the " substance," postponing for the
present all discussion as to whether it was a normal or
supernormal product and as to its nature.
Now we must remember that, as there was no searching
of either the medium or her husband, it was possible for
either the one or the other or both to bring certain
articles into the seance room. Since also the right hand
of the medium and the left hand of F. H. must be con-
sidered free, actions could be performed by them just as
far as the luminous bands sewai on their cuffs permitted
when the sleeves were pulled up the arm out of the way,
or F. H.'s arm, and even Margery's, withdrawn altogether.
That is to say that, assuming P. H.'s sleeve were pulled
up, or his arm entirely freed from it, then Margery, by
holding her wrist near his arm just above the elbow would
give him plenty of opportunity to manipulate any object
either directly or by means of a device such as forceps
or similar instrument.
Now, when my hand was lying on the table palm up-
wards, all that had to be done was for F. H. or Margery
to touch my middle finger with some object covered with
a layer of the substance. We have no right to assume
that all these appearances were the same object. There
may have been half-a-dozen different objects, the only
point of similarity being that they were all covered with
or encased m the substance. Assuming that a strip of
106 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
the substance was held in the jaws of a long forceps all
the flickings and slaps are easily explained, and when the
" long flabby finger " dragged the ring off the table its
weight and clammy surface would have easily been capable
of doing it. The clumsy hand which lay across the
luminous cardboard sheet and resembled eccentric finger
shadows is more difficult to account for normally, although
it seems to me possible that it might be said that the
appearance was due to F. H.'s hand encased in some
rough glove-lUve sheath. The levitation of the basket on
the cardboard was most impressive, and it is difficult to
assign any normal cause which could be considered
reasonable. It is perhaps possible that it was supported
by a flat surface attached to the end of a forceps and
controlled by F. H. or conceivably by F. H.'s own hand,
and the change in the control, when the hands of both
F. H. and Margery were controlled by M. suggests that
the more feeble movements of the cardboard which pro-
jected over the edge of the table facing the medium were
produced by a rod device manipulated by the medium's
mouth. The rustling noise might well have been the rod
as it scraped over the surface of the plaque, but all such
explanations must obviously be only tentative. Whatever
may be thought of the results of applying the second
hypothesis to the sittmg, it is clear that some such
theories must be held if the occurrences are to be described
on normal grounds. Moreover, the progress m the pheno-
mena would have to be ascribed to a cunning plan by
F. H. and Margery, by which it was hoped to ensnare
the observers by simulating just such an advance as they
might be expected to anticipate. As I was still working
on the first hypothesis I naturally did not suggest to F. H.
any of these unpleasant reflections. If the phenomena
were supernormal they would, I thought, prove themselves,
or otherwise they would break down under the moderate
tests I determined to apply.

Sitting VII. (Official).
January 7, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.55 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; Dr. M. Richardson ; W. ; Mrs. Richardson ; D.
At this sitting the development proceeded as before. The
substance was now visible for some seconds in the red light,
and it was repeatedly handled by all present. The number of
observations were many, and the notes dictated at the end of
the sitting somewhat incomplete.
On the table there were placed the two luminous rings, the
little basket and the bell. Darkness was the general rule
except when the Control asked for red light to display the
substance. The following is the record of the sitting :
In ten minutes rusthng in Psyche's lap. 3Ir. D. : Thought
a mass of substance was in Psyche's lap. Walter then
directed my palm to be put up on middle of table, near
the edge. Then for five minutes—palm struck by cool,
clammy apparently disc-like object ; on repeated flicks being
given to my hand, I noticed that the shape of the object
was constantly changing. It appeared to lengthen and to
widen, and occasionally parts apj)eared to be thickened, as
if some internal mechanism was causing a swelUng in parts
of the mass. At times two distinct pressures at least were
felt, the sensation being as if crude, clammy, unformed
fingers were pressing both the lower portions of my fingers,
and also the upper at the same time. This pressure was
sometimes increased to 2|-3 pounds, and when the sub-
stance was drawn from the hand it always appeared to be
shghtly viscous, a phenomenon which was later clearly
demonstrated with relation to the smaller luminous ring.
W. then asked me to put my hand beneath the table
behind the mass, which was lying on the surface as far
as two inches from the top. I felt a loose, clammy,
skin-like appendage which, proceeding from the mass on
the table, appeared to curl away towards Psyche's right side.
Dr. Worcester : My observations begin from permission
to advance my hand under Mr. D.'s. I felt the end of
my fingers smartly struck by a substance already described,
and it seemed to me not so cold as last night. The
I
108 Report on a Series of Sittings [pakt
substance rested across the back of my hand for a per-
ceptible length of time. It gently withdrew and retm-ned
•—-apparently in somewhat greater volume.
Mrs. Richardson : My wrist held by Mi-. D. I put my
fingers on table near Psyche. Mass rested on back of my
four fingers. It felt like ice-cold, uncooked liver. It was
withdrawn and replaced twice. It left a lasting sensation
on my fingers.
Dr. Richardson : My hand was palm down on table.
Ends of fingers were flicked by this material. My ex-
perience was that of Dr. W., but perhaps less in degree.
The Psyche now went into trance. The mass was now
visible on the table on account of the large ring near F. H.
Walter then asked red light (low) for five seconds (arranged
beforehand for the purpose)
.
3Ir. D. saw lying on the table near the edge near Psyche
near east end, a mass of greyish white substance, Avhich
seemed like back of an armadillo. It seemed to be per-
haps two inches thick and curved down in aU directions
towards the surface of the table.
Dr. Worcester : I saw the same mass, graying, some-
what rounded—less clearly than Mi'. D. saw it.
P. H. saw the same—lilie half a human brain—not
smooth on surface.
3Ir. D. : After a few minutes darkness Walter asked me
to feel the substance and note a hole like a gullet at the
base of the cord leading to Psyche. Prom this he said
he drew power to move objects—a statement I asked him
to explain later. I first put my hand on the top of the
substance. It was soft, clammy, and cold. I then
lowered my hand, and noted that where the cord joined
the mass there appeared to be a sort of skinny frill about
half-inch high. Beneath this was the neck from which the
cord hung, and in this neck I felt the deiDression into
Avhich, at Walter's request, I j^ushed my forefinger. It
was soft and cool like the rest of the substance, but it
did not extend so far as quarter inch. While this was
being done. Psyche groaned each time.
Relaxation. Then ten seconds of brighter red hght.
Mr. D. : I saw extended on the table from the edge near
tvitJi the Medium Margery. 109
Psyche from one inch from middle Hne of table a long,
knobby, greyish white shape like a crudely formed right
hand—the thumb being merely a mass of substance joining
the main mass. All agree.
After another relaxation, the mass struck top of table
violently. The basket was flicked over and the small ring
(B) raised in the air—and then seen apparently sticking to
end of structm-e—with great speed. The blow was like
a seal's flipper. At D.'s request, plaque was put on table
at east end, luminous side towards D.
Mr. D. : Against it I saw a mitten-like structm'e creep-
ing forward at side near Psyche, and plaque was turned
on its back. Its surface was now flicked several times
and its end was curled. The structure had changed its
shape ; a long tongue-like j)rojection, five inches long and
one inch broad, now extended from main mass, which also
had no longer a clear outhne, but was broken up irregu-
larly like amputated fingers. As structure was thrown
about there were convulsive movements of both forearms
of Psyche. All agreed to this description.
Mr. D. : I now remember that earlier in the sitting I was
allowed to hold the mass and press it. It was cool and
clammy as before, readUy yieldmg, but with a tendency
to withdi-aw shghtly towards Psyche—who groaned slightly.
The bell was put on plaque, the mass was thrown over
it. The beU rang. The top with luminous cork attached
itself to the substance and was lifted. Walter laughed.
WhUe these experiments were on Dr. W. and D. held
two corners of plaque—^at Walter's request.
Control as before described. During first five minutes
of sitting shght forearm twitching.
During trance Walter continued to speak and spoke a
great deal. Closed 10.20. Walter told us to expose
Psyche to no white light, but let her rest in dark for
fifteen minutes.

110 Report on a Series of Sittings [paet
This sitting was very similar to that on the previous
day, and the same considerations can be applied to it
when viewed in the Hght of the second hypothesis. Now,
as before, we must assume the same possibility of freedom
of action on the part of F. H. and Margery, and also the
existence of several masses of substance or objects covered
by it. The temptation of svipposing that these objects
were all one and that the change of shape was due to
some process of growth must be steadily resisted. Such
processes can be simulated, and indeed must be assumed
to have been simulated in instances to be discussed later.
Certaualy no mere mass of substance can exert pressure as
described above. This pressure may just have been an
illusion on my part, but if real, such pressure can easily
be obtained if the jaws of a forceps are covered in a
layer of substance, and the impression of palpable fingers
becomes highly reahstic. Moreover, the flicks described
could have been given by different objects, thus causing
the recipient to assixme change of shape in the same
object. In order to illustrate my meaning somewhat more
fully, I will show in parallel columns how the second
hypothesis can receive support from the official record.
Let us assume that F. H. and Margery bring in (1) a
good forcejDs with jaws covered with a thick layer of the
substance, which being of anmial membrane will be cool
and can easily be made slippery and moist by the use of
saliva ; (2) a piece of the substance cut round into a disc-
lil?;e shape ; (3) several pieces cut like sheep's tongues ;
(4) a round mass of substance, either solid or possibly
inflated ; (5) a rudely formed " hand " made out of the
substance.

legs. No. 5 is now displayed.
This phenomenon can be un-
derstood if it is assumed that
No. 5 is now manipulated by
Margery. The violent move-
ments of the forearm suggest
that this was possible. The
viscous nature of the mem-
brane (due perhaps to saliva)
would be sufficient to raise the
ring, and the cork of the bell.
From the above it will be seen that stripped of its
glamour the sitting can be regarded in the light of the
second hypothesis without too many unfounded assump-
tions. To the question whether such things are possible
the only answer that can trutlifully be given is that they
are, and anyone with some practice can reproduce these
phenomena. On the other hand, there is nothing in the
account which does violence to the first hypothesis beyond the
extreme improbability of the whole affair. Moreover, since
similar phenomena, although far less fine in quality, have been
observed with other mediums under conditions of control
which seem to me to exclude trickery, there was no question
that the occurrence might be in very truth what the medium
and her husband claimed that they were.
It appeared to me folly to interrupt the series and pos-
sibly obtain no further phenomena. The first hypothesis
was giving results hitherto unrecorded. If progress were
maintained, then the phenomena would soon be self-
evident apart altogether from the presence of F. H. and
his relation to the medium.

Sitting VIII. {Official).
January 8, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.47 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; J).
This sitting continued the orderly progress of those on
January 6 and January 7. The situation had been discussed
with F. H. and Margery, as I was feeling my way towards
ascertaining their views upon the whole question. Walter
had already promised us the phenomena of visible extrusion,
and reabsorption, and as such occurrences would be better
observed with the medium in black tights or similar garb I
had raised this question. Unfortunately these tights were
objected to on the ground that the materiahsed substance
would fail to pass through them, a theory in flat contradiction
with results observed with other mediums. Instead of tights
F. H. and Margery suggested a loose bath-robe and stockings
as appropriate garments for the sittings. This would give free
play to the extruding substance, which could emerge from
between the folds of the robe and thence proceed on to the
surface of the table. This was one of the most remarkable
sittings that I have ever attended. I was gradually working
up to the crucial experiments, and aheady there were signs
of the possibflity that the first hypothesis might have to be
discarded. I proj)ose dividing the official report in para-
graphs lettered consecutively A. to J. In discussing the sitting
it will then be convenient to indicate the paragraph by their
letters rather than resortuig to recapitulation. The official
report reads thus :
A. 8.57 : Rustling in Psyche's lap, and soon after sound on
table—a flick. Trance then came on. Then D. was told
by Walter to feel substance as it lay on Psyche's left thigh
above the knee. This done, and D. felt clammy substance
lying between skin and robe. It moved slightly when D.
touched it. It seemed to jerk, and was withdrawn some-
what up the thigh.
B. D. was told by Walter to extend his hand, and cold
stuff was felt and pressed by D. A round mass with
knobby prominences on top. Dim led light 3 sees., D. saw
24" long greyish mass at edge of table near middle. It

had a number of knobby projections vipon it. M. de-
scribes mass as size of two fists resting on edge of table,
with five or six rounded knobs on upper surface. Seemed
to be pale reddish colour. Dr. Worcester describes it as
somewhat smaller, greyish to brown, otherwise the same.
D. and M. then, on request, followed a cord from mass
downwards which entered folds of dress. Mr. D. : This cord
seemed soft and clammy like rest of substance but not so
solid—diameter J"—hke a ribbon with things protruding—
a
cord-band. Dr. Worcester : I passed my hand over mass and
along cord till I touched the dress. Diameter, 1" to 1|".
Seemed to be composed of strands. Dr. McDougall : I did
the same and got feeUng like placental cord—-texture with a
membrane—clammy
.
C. Relaxation : red light stronger 2 sees., showed same
position and bulk—a mass appearing more closely a crude
human hand—crooked at "finger ends." Mr. D. : I thought
I saw beguming of knuckle and rude attempt at skin mark-
ings and apparently veins. Dr. M. : I saw rough forma-
tion, approximately a right hand with first two jomts visible.
D. D. then asked for visible telekinesis. Then structure
covered larger of two rings—nearer border. Then red light
3 sees., then 2 sees., then again 2 sees. On each occasion
just as light went out the hand drawing the luminous ring
with it made shght movement towards Psyche about 1".
E. Then the larger ring was seized and waved about some
6" above the table and twisted about. Then, following
instructions, D. raised forefinger and large ring was put
on it ; then smaller ring was pushed up (D.), and after
several attempts it was placed on same finger tip. Then
rings were moved about and one ring was slapped down
on pahns of M.'s fingers. The mass on M.'s finger made
shakmg hand movements.
F. Then both rings were dashed about over table with
laughter from Walter.
G. BeU was flapped violently and rung violently twice.
Cork top came off and was replaced once. Walter was
advised not to touch metal top. He replied, " No danger,
I'm the sanest man outside of the scientists." Luminous disc-
top of beU was eclipsed by tlie mass when bell was struck.

H. When larger ring was wanted, it was at centre of table.
To get it Walter pulled the table towards Psyche.
J. Psyche began to come out and sitting ended at 10.20.
Instructions from Walter not to move about much to-night

In this sitting the first indication of the appearance of
the substance was that felt on the left thigh somewhat
above the knee. When I touched it it jerked slightly and
seemed as if it were pulled upwards. The first experiment
towards strengthening the validity of the first hypothesis
is described in D. It failed. The " hand " lying on the
table, which was covering the nearer border of the larger
luminous ring, when asked to move the ring did so, but
the movement was not independent but was caused by the
whole structure being pulled by the cord towards the medium.
It must be remembered that the violent movements which
occurred afterwards and which are described in E, F,
and G were in darkness. Not the slightest sign of inde-
pendent movement could be obtained in red light. From
the point of view of the second hypothesis this is exceed-
ingly important. Viewed from this angle the situation
might be somewhat as follows : the pieces of substance
visible at this sitting might be the same as those seen the
night before, and the brownish, reddish tint might be due
to the material becoming older. The cord, made perhaps
of some animal gut, might be fastened to the substance
at one end, and to the other could be attached a bulb
securely held between the medium.'s legs. A pull upon
this cord would naturally move the substance, and a
similar independent movement was achieved. It is con-
ceivable also that a piece of the substance had been made
into a sort of bag-like structure which, when connected
98] with the Medmm Margery. 115
with the tube and bulb, might be inflated with air ejected
from the bulb by pressure of the medium's legs.
Sitting IX. {Official).
January 9, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.20 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D.
This sittmg can be considered a development of the last. A
substance apparently the same was felt upon the medium's thigh,
and its coldness struck me as being marked in comparison with the
warm skin upon which it rested. The cord also was examined
in greater detail, and the periods of red light were longer.
The searching of the medium by W. was really without value
as also were the searches conducted by M. They were carried
out in order to prepare the medium and F. H. for what I
hoped would be stricter conditions later.
As before, I divide the paragraphs of the official reijort into
sections. It reads thus :
A. Psyche was dressed in a woollen bath-robe and stockings.
She was searched by Dr. Worcester. Mr. Dingwall and
F. H. were searched by Dr. McDougall.
B. A rustling sound was heard almost at once in Psyche's
lap, and at about that time she passed into trance.
Walter instructed Dingwall to follow up left stocking until
he reached the thigh. D. then reports on top of the
warm skin of the left thigh a mass like a pan-cake, ice-
cold, similar to that which was described yesterday, but
less heaped up. D. was slow in orienting himseh ; where-
upon Walter said, " Your hand is caught in the lining of
the bath-robe, follow the stocking." D. said this was
true. Just after the rustling in the lap, a mass was
apparently laid on the table. It appeared as if the mass
on the table and the mass on the thigh were present at
the same time.
C. Part of the large luminous ring was obscured by a
finger-like process.
D. Under instructions of Walter, D., W., and M. were each
allowed to feel down along the cord leading from the table
mass towards Psyche's abdomen. All felt a ribbon cord,
116 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
and described it as being |" to 1^" long and 1-|" thick,
somewhat rough.
E. The finger-hke processes of the mass lifted the luminous
ring and waved it about with great freedom, the fingers
gomg as much as 3 inches above the table.
F. We were then given three periods of red light, each
brighter than the last, and five seconds each. There was
seen a mass lilve a hand (similar to lOuski's) as if it were
a sculptor's model of a hand with the deep skin markings
across the knuckles showing, and some marks like veins.
G. Between the light periods a new experiment was devised
by Walter : Dingwall encircled the cord with his right
thumb and forefinger, the cord resting where the tips met,
and when the cord was thus held the mass, by finger-Uke
process, picked up the big luminous ring and flapped mass
and ring with a loud noise back on D.'s hand which held
the cord. This was done seven times. Walter said, " Do
you feel the stifi^ening in the cord ?
" D. said it felt
elastic rather than stiff.
H. A knobby mass was then shown in red light, then a
fairly good hand, and then a mass with five sharply
pointed pseudopods like a star-fish, aU in red light.
McDougaU had asked to be allowed to reach across with
his left hand and grasp the link between F. H. and
Psyche, F. H.'s right hand being grasj)ed by Worcester
and McDougaU at the same time. Walter now allowed
this and three phenomena followed, clearly seen by all
observers : (1) the big ring was thrown by a black finger
process from the centre of the table to Psyche's edge ;
(2) the large ring was lifted 4" high, and then carried
over to Psyche's abdomen ; (3) McDougaU says the third
phenomenon happening during his control of Psyche was
further movement of the big ring. Dingwall and F. H.
state that the basket was moved during this last ex-
periment.
J. The illuminated plaque was then introduced. The mass
threw itself at once on it and followed in each case
Walter's promise. One, two, three, four or five fingers
of all shapes were made to suddenly grow out from the
mass, some slowly, some quickly. Then a short, coarse
98] with the Medium Margery. 117
thumb, and finally one long projection with a hook on it,
in aU twelve inches long. All during the plaque pheno-
mena Walter kept up almost continual conversation, mixed
with his characteristic laugh, all heard in between Psyche's
obvious snores.
K. The bandeau on her hair apparently became loose.^
Walter said, " It's in her eyes ; it troubles her in her
trance." Dingwall was told to pull it tight and string it
over her ears. Thus he did with no success. Whereupon
Walter said, " I'U fix it. I'll put it down on her neck,"
and it was done promptly by Walter.
L. Further phenomena were now observed on the plaque.
All Uttle fingers grew out, rather than protruded. Then
a hand appeared as i£ aU the fingers had been amputated,
about Y lo^g 5 then the mass became shapeless, Hke a
club ; the movements were sometimes violent, sometimes
stealthy. Sometimes three fingers, sometimes five.
M. Before the ilhiminated ring was thrown on the floor by
Walter, it was folded up and buried under the tissue
paper in the little basket. The basket then went up in
the ah, fell on its side, and was pushed into F. H.'s lap.
N. The trance was very deep aU through this sitting, and
Psyche was restless as to arms and legs. At one time
her head fell forward on the table with deep snormg.
0. At one time Walter, speaking of the great night which
is approaching, said that on that night D. was to have
one leg, F. H. the other, and " Dr. McDougall may have
a wing." Then he said, " Dr. W. may hold her nose if
he feels neglected." Both Dingwall and McDougall re-
ported during the sitting that the mass grasped their
hands, and made motions as if " shaking hands."
P. We were told to let Psyche wake up in successive
exposures to red light. Sitting closed at 11.10 p.m.
Viewed in the light of the second hypothesis the pheno-
mena of this sitting are more difficult to describe than
those in the last. We will consider the occurrences men-
tioned in G, H and J. In G is described the
phenomenon of the flapping hand. On this hypothesis I
would incline to the view that the mass of substance upon
^ See note by Dr. McDougall, p. 155.
118 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
the table representing the " hand " was connected as
before with the tube and bulb. Pressure upon the bulb
would force air up the tube and cause just such an elastic
tension as I felt. Now since one hand was engaged with
the cord and the other controlling Margery, the forceps
might then have been employed to seize one end of the
mass furthest from the medium and then flap it backwards
and forwards over my hand. With the jaws covered with
similar substance accidental touching would be concealed
and the effect rendered highly curious and intriguing.
In H with change of control the phenomena are diffi-
cult to account for, although it seems possible that a rod
in the medium's mouth might have caused them, although
I did not think so at the time, and am still very doubtful
on that point.
In J are described the movements of the mass on the
plaque, which are very impressive. It is not easy to
hazard even a guess how these effects might be produced
normally. It might be urged that inflation by air could
produce the effects, although their ajipearance did not
suggest it during the sitting. It is one of those pheno-
mena (and by no means the only one) which are seen
with Margery, and appear impossible of explanation when
seen but once. At anyrate the occurrence of such a
phenomenon led me to persevere with the first hyj)othesis.
It was, however, clear that before the second hypothesis
could be used as a working theory, it would be necessary
to improve the test conditions, and as a preliminary I
thought it desirable to try to ascertain how far F. H. and
Margery were likely to consent to this.
Accordingly, after complimenting them both on the suc-
cess already attained, I suggested to them that I should
make an effort to revive the interest of the Scientific
American in the case. My proposal was on these terms :
a gauze cage was to be employed (of the kind used with
the medium Willy Schneider), closed on all sides except
for a slit at the level of a person's knees. The table was
to be placed in the cage, and the cage itself placed in
front of Margery with the slit towards her. F. H. would
control one of her hands and I the other. Professor

McDougall would clasp F. H.'s left hand and Margery's
right, and Dr. Walter Prince (then Chairman of the
Scientific American Committee) would clasp my right hand
and Margery's left. The medium and controllers would
all wear lummous wrist bands as before. The conditions
were, in fact, such as would prevent any normal contact
with the substance for the purpose of effecting changes of
shape and movement when it was lying on the table
within the gauze enclosure.
Neither the Chairman of the Scientific American Committee
nor F. H. would agree, the latter giving as his reasons
personal objections on the medium's part to control by
members of the Committee. These reasons seemed to me
inadeqviate, and m view of the obvious insufficiency of the
conditions hitherto prevailing as a test of the genuineness
of the phenomena, seemed to me to lend considerable
weight to the second hypothesis.

Preserit : F. H. ; Mr. F. Adler (an old friend of F. H.) ; D.
At this sitting I had a long discussion with Walter. Assum-
ing the first hypothesis to be true, it seemed that Margery
wanted a rest Avhen her recent illness in New York was con-
sidered and her nervous tension recognised.
During the sitting I discussed the plans for the next
experiments. It appeared a good opportunity to make some
inquiry into the mechanism of the independent voice, in order
that rest might be secured for the medium's organism as a
whole. I tried to persuade Walter to say something about
his methods of producing the voice. Pointing out how some
material apparatus would seem to be necessary to produce the
air waves, I suggested that, as he said the materialised ap-
paratus was usually about three inches from the medium's
mouth, it might be possible to obtam a silhouette of the
moving structure by means of a luminous plaque behind the
medium. All my suggestions were, however, rejected, and
Walter, in accordance with conduct which is common with
him, namely, that of promising something more wonderful than
120 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
that asked by the investigator, assured us that he would show
a marvellous materiahsed head upon the medium's shoulder.
We then discussed the plans which I was making for photo-
graphic work, and finally Walter tried a few experiments with
the gauze cage, which was in readiness should F. H. and the
Scientific American Committee consent to the tests to which
I have alluded above. The following is from F. H.'s notes of
the sitting :
Walter came through very shortly, seemed cheerful and
wUhng to co-operate m every way with Mr. Dingwall's
ideas. Mr. Dingwall had thought that the strain of last
week's sittings was so great on Psyche that it would be
well to wait perhaps four days longer, but Walter said
" No," that we must sit every night in order that he could
practise ; that nothing he did would injure Psyche.
Mr. Dingwall then talked of methods to demonstrate the
mechanics of the independent voice. Mr. D.'s idea was
to place a faintly illuminated plaque behind Psyche's head
so that the mechanism of si^eech would show up in profile.
Walter said this could be done if the light was sufficiently
dim, but his idea was better and more convincing, namely,
to materialise his head on Psyche's shoulder, and let us
see him taUi.

At this sitting appeared what was alleged by the control
to be the beginning of the talking head. I had tried to
persuade Walter to allow me to devise some experiment for
demonstrating the independent voice, but all my suggestions
were, as already said, refused, and we were promised the
materiahsed head of Walter himself instead of the relatively
simple phenomena asked for. The official record reads as
follows :
Trance came on more gently than usual, and was fol-
lowed, after considerable interval, by an appearance
tvith the Medium Margery. 121
apparently on table top of a vague patch, or sphere, of
light three inches or more in diameter, lasting 30 sees, or
more and then fading. Then an interval. Mr. D. : Then
Psyche bent down her head and touched table with it,
adjusting her left hand and my right hand in various
positions, then rising to sitting position as before.
Then again same light sphere appeared as before, slightly
larger in diameter—then a hissing sound was heard^
—
apparently to D. and F. H. from the sphere on the table.
McDougall locahsed the sounds in later events as from the
table top or thereabouts. Dr. Worcester says his percep-
tions did not tally with those of the other observers. Dr.
W. : I saw a faint nebulous diffused light in same position
as described. I should not be able to say I heard any
sound as from the table. I heard a scraping noise dis-
tinctly when Mr. Dingwall put out his hand.
I heard four or five sounds which I should describe as
snorts when I extended my own hand, and I felt corre-
sponding puffs of air on my hand, but my feeling would
be to refer the dnection of the snorts to the head of
Psyche.
Walter said he was going to show something funny.
Mr. D. : I put my hand out with palm towards W. and M.,
and then the disc shape of light appeared (2-3 sees.) and
then came the hiss, and at every hiss the current of air
was distinctly perceptible on my palm.
Dr. M. : During these phenomena F. H.'s mouth and nose
were four times on my left shoulder and four times on
the palm of my left hand.
Dr. M. : At Walter's directions I laid right side of my
head on the table, at fii'st close to Psyche's edge and later
drawing it back at Walter's request. F. H.'s mouth was
on back of my left hand throughout and I felt no re-
spiration from him. Then I was aware of a hand or
hands resting about the vertex of my head. My face was
towards Psyche. I then felt seven or eight puffs of cool
air on middle of my face from direction of Psyche, and
same time heard the hiss about 8" from my nose,
coinciding with each '^v&. Mr, D. : Psyche's left hand,
according to Walter's instructions, was on M.'s head during
122 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
the above tests. I held Dr. W.'s right hand with my
left, and with my right (according to Walter's instructions)
covered Psyche's mouth with a folded clean handkerchief,
my hand covering the clean handkerchief which extended
apparently over her mouth as I used my right hypothenar
eminence as a guide which rested immediately under her
nose ; then the hand was entirely over the mouth ; the
head of Psyche was slightly inclined backwards and
I detected no sign of respiration or expiration. She
was sitting upright in her chair. There were eight sets
of the hissing phenomena—each time five to eight times
repeated.
Walter told us to meet at eight to-morrow and to have
the cameras here. Then in breaking up the sitting he
told us to flash white hght on Psyche twice to accustom
her to it.

The phenomena discussed in this sitting were, in my
judgment at least, exceedingly remarkable. The luminous
appearances especially seemed to me interesting, and I do
not find it easy to devise a scheme whereby the same
effects might be simulated. The light appeared to me to
grow in size, increase in brilliance, and then to undergo a
series of changes both in size and luminosity. The hissing
noise which proceeded from the patch appeared to me to re-
semble the expulsion of air from a nozzle, and, if fraudulent,
suggests a new use for the rubber bulb. The theory might
be presented as follows : Assume a tube provided at one end
with a bulb held between the medium's legs and at the
other a nozzle ;
laying her head upon the table would be
merely an excuse for the medium to place her apparatus
thereon ;
pressure upon the bulb would expel air from the
nozzle, and so the resulting hisses would be easy of ex-
planation. An adherent of the first hypothesis could, how-
98] ^viih the Medium Margery. 123
ever, agree with Walter that one must breathe before one
can talk, and would await developments. After all, the
appearance of a living talking head independent of Margery,
should it occur, would be difficult to simulate.
Sitting XII. {Official).
January 15, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.45 p.m.
Present ; F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D. ; Mr. Conant outside the circle.
For this sitting I had invited Mrs. Augustus Hemenway to
come beforehand to search the medium. I had hoped that a
similar search might have been made with F. H., but he was
unwiUing to sit except ia his usual clothes, partly perhaps that
he might be ready for any emergency call which might come
through by telephone. It had also been arranged that Mr.
Conant should come to the sitting and take photographs if the
opportunity arose. Just as the medium was ready for the
sitting Mi-s. Hemenway came to me and told me that the
right ear of the medium was bleeding. I went in and found
that blood and matter were running out of the ear down the
side of her face. Upon seeing this I cancelled the sitting
immediately, against the will of my colleagues.
Since Mr. Conant had come with the photographic apparatus,
it seemed a favourable opportunity to try a flash in order to
find the correct focus and furnish us with a photograph giving
an idea of the general conditions. Hardly had Margery sat
down before I noticed certain indications which, upon the first
hypothesis, would lead one to suppose that the trance was
imminent. Apprehending the state of affairs, which was of
interest from whichever angle one would choose to regard it,
I incidentally resolved to make an experiment on the basis of
the first hypothesis.
Now, anyone at all acquainted with the psychology of
mediumship will be aware of the dangers of gradually per-
mitting the primary personahty to be unduly influenced by
the secondary or trance personahties. In order to live in the
practical world a dominant primary personahty is desirable,
nay, even necessary. It is convenient, therefore, to regard with
124 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
disfavour the slightest signs of the subject passing into dis-
sociated states except upon those occasions when this is
deUberately sought. In the present instance it appeared that
the trance was commencing agamst the will of the subject,
consequent upon the suggestions both of environment and cus-
tomary conditions. I therefore did everything I could to
prevent this occurring, and much exaggerated the concern that
I felt in order to note the reaction in F. H. To my surprise
he opposed my wishes and called for the red light to be put
out in order to favour the appearance of the trance. This
I forbade until after the flash for the trial photographs. Just
after the flash I heard Walter's laugh, and at the same time
saw the left corner of Margery's mouth fall, as if puUed by
a string. There was no longer any doubt that the laugh pro-
ceeded directly from her mouth, although the action by which
it was produced was suggestive and exceedingly interesting.
Since the medium was apparently in deep trance a short
sitting was held in which I elaborated my scheme of testing
F. H.'s attitude towards this important incident. The con-
versation with Walter turned upon the pomt of joint respon-
sibility, he for his side and me for mine. I informed him
that the trances must only be permitted at the pre-arranged
times, and that if they came on at other times they would
interfere with the medium's daily life, and the result would
be that the sittings would be stopped. My colleagues both
apparently disapproved of this course, and Professor McDougall
asked whether I realised that I might have an independent
personality on the other side with whom to deal. Moreover,
F. H. seemed greatly delighted at Walter's success in forcing
himself upon us, a point upon which I had expressly exag-
gerated my concern in order to stimulate discussion.
After the sitting I discussed the whole affair with F. H.
from his professed point of view. Assuming that Walter is a
spii'it and the brother of the medium, what guarantee had he,
I asked, for supposing that Walter will always be in control,
since he had aheady had experiences where foreign agencies had
controlled the medium and had caused much unpleasantness ?
^
^ Apart altogether from this case, the occurrence of the trance states
when unwanted by the subject, is, I believe, a danger signal, just as is the
phenomenon of "hearing voices" in another connexion. • •
98] with the Medium Margery. 125
His reply did not seem satisfactory, and the force of my
objection, supported by many cases from the hterature of
the subject, appeared not to appeal to him. I came to the
conclusion that, bearing in mind that he was a medical man,
his belief in the personality of Walter could not be what he
professed it to be, and thus the result of the episode provided,
as I had hoped that it would, some suggestive material. The
following is the official record of the sitting. It will be noticed
that the phenomena were similar to the previous night :
Dingwall noticed some signs of on-coming trance at once,
and then while noticing these signs Dingwall saw left
corner of her mouth faU and the right corner rise. At
that moment a laugh like Walter's was heard. Dingwall
placed it as coming from movith. Dr. Worcester heard
laugh at his right and then he heard a whistle at his left.
F. H. placed it there also. Conant heard both, also
Psyche.
Trance then came on just after the trial flash light was
burned.
After discussion with Walter as to future plans, in which
Dingwall and Walter expressed opposing opinions, Walter
said, " I want to experiment with deep trance ten minutes."
This followed at once. Seven slow, deep respnations fol-
lowed, and then a period of apparently no breathing for
ten to fifteen seconds ; then six regular respirations, then
ten to fifteen seconds silence, then five and silence, four
and silence, etc., down to one long one. Then head and
left arm went on table, and head banged two or three
times. After two or three times of this, whUe she was
erect, a luminous cloud seven inches diameter, but less
diffused than last night, was seen at right of Psyche's edge
of table—seen by Drs. Worcester, McDougall, and F. H.
—one time accompanied by a rubbing sound three times
on table.
Sitting closed at 10.10 p.m., just as Psyche came out.
Just before sitting Mrs. Hemenway discovered Psyche's
right ear was bleeding. It was a dilute blood as if it
contained some lymph from middle ear. She had some
ache in ear all afternoon—a little of it after sitting last
night. •

Present : F. H. ; M. ; W. ; D.
The record of this sitting is as follows :
On this night, as on each night previous, Mrs. Augustus
Hemenway came before the sitting and examined Psyche,
even to the extent of taking down her hair. Psyche was
dressed only in a bath-robe and stockings. Dr. McDougall
examined Mi-. Dingwall and F. H.
Trance came on almost at once. Vague huge patch of
light over left of Psyche's chest in two parts—persistent
—extending downwards. Seen by Worcester, McDougall,
and F. H.
Twice when Psyche's mouth was held by Dingwall's
hand over it and she was quietly and normally breathing
through her nose, and F. H.'s face was on Dr. McDougall's
left shoulder, five to eight sounds were heard like nasal
breathing and loud, and not near Psyche's head—^If to
2^ feet away. Three other series occurred without the
mouth control (D. and F. H.)

The most noticeable event of the seance was the vague
patch of light. It seemed to extend from the lower left
hand side of the neck to just below the left breast.
Perhaps it may be urged that the appearance was not in
reality upon the robe as we believed at the time, but was
a patch of phosphorescent material powdered on the
medium's bare body and became visible through opening
the robe. I detected no movements on my side indicating
that the robe had been opened, but the possible freedom

of the right hand should not be overlooked m this con-
nection. As before, the most puzzling feature of the light
was the apparent change both in contour and brilliance,
a fact for which I have no adequate explanation, if the
picture my memory preserves of the incident is to be
trusted. This sitting was origmaUy intended by Walter
to present an example of birth and dissolution of the
substance. Nothing, however, of the kind occurred. The
reason given for the failure is, I think, important, as
it was another of those incidents which made me
seriously consider whether the first hypothesis was
justified working theory. From what the control
had said it was clear that the extrusion of the substance
would resemble a normal birth, and in this respect the
case links up with facts already observed with other
mediums. Whether these facts provide a basis for a
belief in their supernormal nature need not concern us
here. What is important to remember is the observation
of the method of the extrusion of the teleplasm in
Eva C, Kathleen Goligher, etc., as vouched for by the
witnesses. Now, Walter directed that in preparation for
this great event a flat piece of wood should be provided
which should rest upon the medium's chair in such a way
that whilst she was seated upon the part resting on the
seat of the chair, the front part should project beyond
the chair about twelve inches or more. This precaution
was necessary, so he averred, since without it the substance
might fall to the floor, the cord be broken and a catastrophe
result. Now this statement is in flat contradiction with
everything which has hitherto been described by reliable
witnesses with teleplastic mediums. I need hardly remind
those who read this paper (and presumably are acquainted
with the literature) that there are many instances in
which the substance has actually fallen to the ground
without any such catastrophic results. One would have
supposed that after the substance has emerged or is
emerging, the vital principle animating the structure would
have been sufficient to maintain its rigidity without any
external mechanical support. To this objection, as to all
others of a Uke nature, F. H., in company with other
I
128 Re'port on a Series of Siitings [PABT
critics, will reply in the doctor's favourite aphorism,
" You didn't make the Universe ;
you must accept it," to
which I would respectfully rejoin that it is not a case of
acceptance but of interpretation, and we must interpret
in accordance with our knowledge of the facts as we are
able to obtain them.
The results hitherto obtained had been so remarkable
that I hoped that the reality of the phenomena of the
extrusion and re-absorption of the substance would be self-
evident. My own provisional impression of the mediumship
was that the phenomena were authentic, and I had partly
given my opinion to this effect to my colleagues and
others. I now (July, 1925) no longer hold this view, and
admit my change of mind, which, however, I shall again
not hesitate to modify if freshly discovered facts appear
to warrant it.
Sitting XIV. (Official).
January 18, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.30 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; M. ; D.
The board was provided as before, but except for communi-
cation with Walter, who again insisted on its necessity, this
was a wholly negative sitting.
Sitting XV. (Private). .,
January 19, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.25 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; D. ; Mr. R. W. Conant attended to the cameras
of which there were four, one of wliich was stereoscopic and
was generously procured by Mrs. C. Dennett.
Mi\s. Hemenway searched the medium as before, and the
medium wore bath-robe, stockings, and luminous bands as
usual. The following is F. H.'s record of the sitting :
Deep trance came on at once, and with fairly good rapidity,
accomj^anied by comments and directions from Walter, we
were shown the actual production of the teleplasm from the
abdomen of the psychic. From time to time the red flash
light was alloAved. A mass formed on the abdomen, which
shortly differentiated itself into a fahly well formed liand,
98] ivitli fhe Medium Margery. 129
fingers downwards, attached from the wist to the umbilicus
by a cord apparently f" in diameter, aU white.
Later ]\'Ir. Dingwall put out the palm of liis hand. A
mass was thrown on it, and although this mass apparently
did not move, Mr. Dingwall could feel apparently
another hand above it moulding the mass. And sure
enough, the next red iiash showed a fairly well formed
hand lying on top of Mr. Dingwall's hand, while at the
previous sight only the uniormed teleplasm was seen.
Walter then told us to direct our attention to the head
of the j)sychic, and the red flash revealed a mass like a
huge knobby potato, pinkish grey in coloiu", attached to
the left head apparently near the ear. It seemed to be
4^3x2 inches.
Three flash light photographs ^ were taken of all these
phenomena.
We were then allowed to see the absorption of the
teleplasm into the body.
Sitting closed at 10.50 p.m.
This sitting is very important. It provided unique
opportunities for observation : it might also have been
expected to provide indisputable proof of the reality of
the supernormal substance ; and that the extrusion and
re-absorption could not conceivably have been engineered
by normal means. It did none of these things. Although
all that occurred coiild have been interpreted in two ways,
yet I was forced to admit to myself that the evidence in
favour of the second hypothesis was stronger than that
for the first.
The fatal flaw in the evidential nature of these pheno-
mena lies in the choice of the light and dark periods by
the Control. These ahvays are selected exactly when the
observer does not want them. I say always, but perhaps
it is fair to add that in other sittings the observer some-
times had his way, but then the phenomena presented did
nothing to strengthen his first hypothesis, but rather pro-
vided material for another. In this sitting, as I persistently

130 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
urged, everything depended upon the growth and re-
absorj)tion being carried out in red light. What was
wanted was not the finished or partly finished product,
but the making of the production itself. These " hands
"
are supposed to grow, to expand, to approach perfection.
But we want to see these steps in operation ; to see the
growth progressing ; to see the actual extrusion and re-
absorption. At this sitting none of these things were
permitted except a momentary glimpse of the supposed
re-absorption, which was not in the least impressive.
From the point of view of the hypothesis of trickery the
steps would be somewhat as follows :
(1) F. H. secures two or three finger-like pieces of sub-
stance and gives them to Margery, who lays them against
her genitals.
(2) A larger mass is similarly arranged.
(3) The same mass is re-adjusted. The use of a small towel
demanded by Walter provides the excuse for interference.
(4) The mass has been arranged and the end of the
structure tucked into the navel.
(5) The mass is substituted for another, or the same one
is re-arranged and the " fingers " arranged over my hand
with much skill.
(6) The whole mass is withdrawn and a single piece used
and (1) again arranged, so that only a portion protrudes ex
vagina.
(7) The same or a similar mass is now placed on the
left cheek and ear. This mass is subsequently withdrawn
and carried away, either by F. H. or by the medium.
But this hyjDothesis of normal production would be im-
possible were it not for tlie periods of light and darkness
selected by the control. As it was, the real observations
had to be made during a few seconds only, so I con-
centrated my attention upon but a few points. Paying
especial attention to the supposed attachment of the sub-
stance to the body, I tried to discover whether the
substance seemed to be really growing from the navel or
whether it had the appearance of having been tucked into
that cavity, and from what could be gathered from so
98] with the Medium Margery. 131
fleeting an inspection the second mode of attachment
seemed to be more probable. Moreover, the movements of
the " hand," when it lay over my own were so startlingly
dissimilar from that produced by a living hand that the
assumption that the teleplastic hand was being manipu-
lated by a real hand was forced upon me. Thus, if we
continue to accept the first hypothesis, we have to
assume that a second materialised hand, endowed with all
the attribvites of life, was manipulating the other hand in
order to provide material for supposing that the teleplastic
hand was moving upon mine. This is so extravagant a
hypothesis that the second theory of normal action be-
comes almost irresistible, unless the objector chooses to
regard my impressions concerning the movements of the
teleplastic hand as due to illusion.
After this incident I decided to direct my attention to
the point of the movements of the substance, and in the
next sitting it will be seen how startlingly the results
support the second rather than the first hypothesis.
This seance marks the turning point of the inquiry.
Until this sitting my provisional acceptance of the first
hypothesis, with all that it implied, had produced the
most astonishing results. The atmosphere of mutual con-
fidence had provided an easy course of progressive work,
and would have been fully justified had not the pheno-
mena broken down at a crucial point. Many of the
phenomena, however, remained unexplained, and I deter-
mined to proceed as before, observing the same outward
demeanour, although my opinion of the validity of the
first hypothesis had been somewhat shaken.
I
Three photographs were taken at this sitting, of wliich
I publish three representative specimens from the twelve
exposures made in the four cameras (Plate I, Figs. A, b, c).
I, Fig. A, is an enlargement of the first result, and shows
the " hand " as it appeared when lying upon the body of
I
the medium. The appearance resembles a crude model of a
left hand formed out of some skinny substance. T is the
thumb, and F the fingers ; N is the navel from which the
" arm " appears to be growing ; and Tr is a part of the
" wrist," the " rings " of which so strongly suggest that
132 Meport on a Series of Sittings [part
it is part of a trachea that the theory has been advanced
that the hand is made np out of the lung of some animal.
We shall discuss this later, and, in the meantime, pass to
Plate I, Fig. B, which is an enlargement of the second exposure.
Part of my hand is seen at DH, the tliumb being DT, and
the extended fingers DP. The " hand " rests across my
hand, its " fingers " towards my thumb, and its forefinger
just at the edge of the towel T. The " wrist " is formed of
two tubular appendages, and the join of the " thumb " to
the rest of the " hand " shows a couple of orifices sup-
ported by a piece of skinny material. The surface of the
" hand " shows rude skin markings and part of the fore-
finger exhibits a ridge or line of substance which runs down
towards the tip. The third exposure (Plate 1, Fig. c) shows
one portion of a stereoscopic picture of the substance at the
side of the medium's head. A mass of material appears
to spring from Margery's left ear, and on its outer edge
near the turned-up coUar of the robe lies a rude finger, RF,
which resembles the second finger of Plate I, Fig. a, inas-
much as it has the skin turned up at its tip. The end of the
substance, which is dotted with mmute orifices, 0, strongly
resemblmg bronchioles, seems to enter the medium's mouth.
We cannot discuss here the possible normal nature of the
substance as revealed by the photographic results. It is
clear that no certainty can ever be reached in this respect,
and I hope to deal rather more fully with this problem
in the Conclusions at the end of the report.
Sitting XVI. {Official).
January 20, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.15 p.m.
Present : W. ; F. H. ; M. ; D.
At this sitting F. H. consented to relinquish his seat to
Dr. Worcester, and occupied another between the latter and
Professor McDougall. With this exception the control was as
usual. The official rej)ort reads as follows :
Psyche was searched and examined by Mi's. Hemenway,
and conducted into room by Mr. Dmgwall direct. Her
hands were held or were in view on table from that time
on. From then to end of sitting Mi-. Dingwall never lost
with the Medima Margery. 133
contact with Psyche's left hand. Dr. Worcester held right
hand and never lost contact with hand or wrist for a
second.
Dr. McDougall searched F. H. (clothed) before sitting.
McDougall says this is not really relevant, because F. H.
was adequately controlled on both sides from start to
finish. Dr. Worcester agrees with this. When F. H.
turned on rheostat, Dr. Worcester followed and held
F. H.'s hand.
Trance came on quietly in two or three minutes. Within
ten nlinutes Mi-. Dingwall heard oozing sound near Psyche's
lap and then movements of her legs. Mr. Dingwall felt
usual cold mass on left thigh small ; then Walter said,
" Turn red hght on two seconds," and we saw mass Uke
elongated tuberosities in Psyche's left groin. Then left leg
went up on table, and then Psyche put her held left hand
down and threw mass on table.
Then Dingwall, Worcester, and McDougall, each sepa-
rately with back of his hand, felt mass on the table—cold,
firmer than previously, and knobby. Mr. Dingwall says
not so cold as usual, more skinny and gristly, resilient.
Walter directed next red flash to be turned on, and we
saw what was just now felt. To Mr. Dingwall the base
of the cord to-day was thicker than usual, and part where
it disappeared at edge of table it was ropy and dark
brown colour. We saw a heaped knobby mass ; Dr.
Worcester saw an elongated mass extending from edge of
table, 2^"-3" Avide and 4"-5" long, terminating in a point
extending north. To Dr. McDougall it seemed to have
finger-like processes extendmg north [sic).
Then a photograph was taken (four cameras, one of
which is stereoscopic) by flash. After this flash we could
see on table top (which had become luminescent from par-
ticles of Geley's powder) a black outluie more or less like
a starfish—visible to Mr. Dmgwall and F. H.
Red flash revealed a mass visible on table similar to
what had been seen before—^heaped up, and a cord was
seen going down towards Psyche's knees. Dr. Worcester's
hand was put on mass near origin of cord by Psyche's
hand. It felt like the mass.
134 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
Then on request in red flash Mr. Dingwall saw mass
pulled backwards slightly. Three times more it was done.
Dr. Worcester saw it the third time, Dr. McDougall the
fourth time. F. H. saw it twice, Mr. Dingwall saw it
three times—like an amoebic shrinking. Psyche very rest-
less, light talking trance, complained of pain, headache,
soreness all over.
Her head then went several times on table, lying on its
left side. Then trance became deeper. Walter said, " Let
it be there. I am going to show you something : one
psychic phenomenon. Ha ! Ha ! Ha !
" Then, under in-
structions, red flash turned on head two seconds showed
large mass front of and on right ear. Then a photo was
taken of the mass. Then each was allowed again to feel
the mass. Dr. Worcester says : "I felt the mass twice
—flrst gently, at which time it appeared to extend from
right temple to top of ear and front of ear. The second
time Psyche took my hand and pressed it with much
greater force against her head than I should have thought
it wise to employ myself. By this time the mass had
considerably enlarged in extent and thickness. It ap-
peared to extend from nearly the top of the head to the
lower part of lobe of ear. The mass thickened as it
descended. Nearly as I could judge it was perhaps f"
thick at lower end. Psyche pressed my hand strongly
against the substance. I felt it to be cold, clammy, and
quite elastic. By compression of the substance my hand
seemed to touch the side of her head, but it was forced
up again. This was by far the most impressive contact
with the substance I have had." Mass in red light looked
l)rownish grey to Worcester, McDougall, and F. H., lighter
in colour to Dingwall.
Psyche then sat up and was wakened gradually by red
light periods.
McDougall referring back to mass on table says : "I was
given contact with it on table. I could feel the elongated
tuberosities corresponding to what I had seen : a soft,
resiUent mass like a membrane filled with some semi-fluid
substance."

At this sitting the phenomena were similar to those
remarked previously with some important exceptions. As
indicated above, one reason for the change of positions in
the sitters was that I wished to inquire into the alleged
self mobility of the substance. According to the first
hypothesis the substance is living, or at least temporarily
endowed with what we loosely term " vitality," and when
it emerges from the body of the subject and makes its
way upon the table, it does so by its own inherent
qualities. Therefore, the moment it should be heard to
fall upon the table top was anxiously awaited. The first
indication that the substance was emergmg was the sound
it apparently made when issuing from the body, or almost
immediately afterwards. I felt it on the medium's person,
where we all saw it lying as described in the report.
Now, then, was the opportunity for it to display its quali-
ties of self mobility and climb upon the table. But
nothing of the sort occurred. Psyche put her left hand down,
with D.'s still controlling it, and threw the mass upon
the table. Is it not exactly what we should expect on
the second hypothesis ? The mass may have been con-
cealed in the vagina and thence expelled ^
; thus the only
course open would have been for the medium to throw it
upon the table and then devise means of manipulating it
there without the use of the hands. Movement in the red
light was confined to the mass being pulled backwards as
if by the cord. The movements upon the table were
1 1 here submitted Plate IIb to an eminent gynecologist with the
request for information as to the possibility of concealing such a sub-
stance. The following is her reply :
" Yes, of course it would be quite
possible to pack a considerable portion of such substance into the
vagina, and this could only be definitely excluded by examination im-
mediately before putting on tights. By muscular contraction (which,
however, I should think would be obvious) the substance might be held
or partially expelled. . .
136 Rejiort on a Series of Sittings [part
caused by the medium manipulating the mass with her
mouth as ajDpears plainly in the photograph reproduced
(Plate II, Fig. a). Margery, her head-band pushed up to the
top of her head instead of round her forehead, is seen
with the substance in her mouth. W. holds her right
hand and I hold her left, whilst M. leans forward with his
head on the table. The mass has two or more elongated
projections like rude fingers extending towards the centre
of the table, and the general position of the circle is clearly
illustrated. The second photograph (Plate II, Fig. b) is one
of the stereoscopic results taken from the side. It shows a
mass of substance lying over the right ear. Extending
towards the neck is a projecting piece, P, upon which is a
sharp ridge, with which may be contrasted that visible on
the " hand " seen on January 19 (see Plate I, Fig. b). From
the main portion springs a caudal appendage, C, and ap-
parently joining it towards the upper part and almost at
the centre is seen the opening to what appears to be a sort
of tube,^ T. The end of the caudal portion hangs over the
mouth, E. .

Present : W. ; F. H. ; M. ; D. ; Mrs. Hemenway was seated

On the day x^revious to this sitting I received from Professor
McDougall the letter of January 18, since jiublished in his
article in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical
Research for June, 1925, and I also had some talk with him
and Dr. Worcester. It is to be regretted that we had not
compared notes sooner, as knoAvledge of the suspicious circum-
stances observed might have helped nie to change my working
hypothesis sooner.
The following is a record of the sitting :
Usual search of persons was made.
On table large and small ring, spatula and bell. Basket
to right of medium on floor.
Another photograjDh taken from the front shows this tube, T, more
clearly. Its diameter seems slightly greater than that of the caudal
strip at the part next to it. (See Plate II, Fig. c.)

D. saw it as fleeting ghmpse second time.

trolled D. -Psyche link. Psyche's right leg and both F. H.'s
legs were controlled by Dr. W.—^nothing happened.

The results of the sitting were curious, and in one way
supported the second hypothesis rather than the first.
The levitation of the basket, which was observed only
fleetingly by myself, and well by Dr. Worcester and Mrs.
Hemenway, might conceivably have been produced either
by the medium or by F. H. Professor McDougall has sug-
gested that the levitation was produced by the medium's
right foot, but my impression at the time was that it
would have been difficult to have done this without exposure
of the luminous bracelet on the right ankle, and that if,
as the appearance of the phenomenon indeed suggested at
the time, the levitation had been performed fraudulently,
F. H.'s left foot was the one probably responsible. It is
noteworthy that when a proper control was insisted on no
resulting phenomena took place, but this again, like so many
other similar facts, is capable of a double interpretation.

At this sitting W. again occupied F. H.'s usual place. The
sitting was remarkable for the alleged control of the medium
by the late Professor Hyslop, who wished to communicate with
W. I was totally unimpressed by this occurrence, and from
my limited experience it seemed quite unlike anything I had
hitherto encountered, and strongly suggested simulation. There
were no telekinetic or teleplastic phenomena, and the record
reads thus :
Trance came in 5-10 minutes. Dr. Worcester :
'
My
left hand was seized by Psyche in powerful convulsive
grip—-the holdmg hand quivered. A long hissing sound
was made as of deep inspiration. Then came word
" Worcester," and in reply to cj^uery as to identity, trance
voice said " Hyslop." Just before this Psyche's hand
jerked out of Worcester's control and struck three times
violently on table. I feared she would hurt herself.
When I recovered her hand, her elbow was rigid and I
could not straighten it. Tried then for message. When
the voice said, " Act at once, or aU wUl be over." Then
he said, " My work of twenty-five years wiU be utterly
Avasted " (words to that effect). "Bring it over."' Dr.
Worcester said, " I think I take your meaning ; what about
Prince ?
" Hyslop said, " He has done the best he could."
Walter (Worcester) said, " Have you confidence in him 1
"
Hyslop said " Yes." Earher Hyslop said, " I've been try-
ing to get at you for three days." The table was struck
hard two periods—three or four times. During two-thirds
of this conversation the red light was on and the circle
was broken. Left leg was up in a spasm. Hyslop said,
" I have warned you of this before " (see Dr. Douglas
memoranda). Then Walter came through and light was
put out.
Walter was asked to work on lighted megaphone at
right back of cabinet ; or on luminous basket fastened

apparently—suggested moving megaphone forwards, and

The following day F. H. met Professor McDougall and
myself at lunch in Professor McDougall's apartments. We
discussed the whole situation, and F. H. seemed upset and
worried at the turn things had taken.
During the days immediately preceding January 31
there were no official sittings. Margery was ill, and for
various reasons the idea of a Harvard series had to be
abandoned. I spent much time at 10 Lime Street, and
F. H. and I had many pleasant talks and discussions.
I also made some private experiments in various directions
and made a series of inquiries, nearly all of which sup-
ported the first hypothesis as opposed to the second. It
stUl seemed to me almost incredible that the second theory
was valid, and yet the failure of all the crucial tests could
not be overlooked. On January 27 the medium was still
ill, and an official sittmg had to be postponed. Towards
evening, however, she insisted upon a home circle being
formed, at which I was present. (Sitting XX.) Mr. Adler
and Mr. Conant were present, and F. H. and myself
occupied our accustomed places. On the table were the
bell, two luminous rings, the tambourine, and a flat
wooden throat spatula, one end of which I had painted
with luminous paint on both sides. The two small mega-
phones stood to the right of Margery's chair, and the
basket rested on the mouthpiece of the one nearest the
table. The medium complained of headache, but the con-
trol laughed and talked as usual.r After a time the
medium, still grumbliBg, laid her head down on the table,
140 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
her haix lying over the spatula. Then she raised her head
and leaned back a little. Soon the spatula moved an
inch or two towards her in jerks. It fell off the table on
to her lap and remained, according to Mr. Adler's account,
hanging down near the right corner of her chair, whence
it subsequently fell to the ground. As these movements
were going on I noticed many jerks of the luminous head-
band. The sitting closed soon after the spatula had
fallen.
Now, the movement of the spatula could easily be
accounted for up to a pomt without recourse to the
supernormal. When the medium laid her head on the
table a hair might have been attached to the spatula possibly
by means of a little wax, although it would certainly
appear very difficult to do this efficiently. Then as she
raised her head slowly the hair would be lengthened, and
then the spatula would be moved and drawn into her lap.
It would then fall off and remain hanging. The move-
ments of the head confirm these theories, and yet no
direct evidence exists that these methods were employed.
I mentioned them to F. H., but he dismissed them im-
patiently as unworthy of attention.
On January 30 Professor McDougaU drew my attention
to certain signs upon the enlargements of the photographs
of the two " hands " obtained on January 19 (see Plate I,
Figs. A, b). Thus in Plate I, Fig. a, he noticed in the section
marked Tr certain ring markings which strongly resembled
the cartilaginous rings found in the mammalian trachea.
This discovery led him to the theory that the " hands
"
had been faked from some animal lung material, the tissue
cut and joined, and that part of the trachea had been
used for the same purj^ose. The appearance of the
wrinkled lookmg skin, and other indications to be discussed
later, are consistent with the same idea.
On January 31 I read before an invited audience at
Jordan Hall, Boston, an account of the sittings, the best
account of which was published in the Boston Herald of
February 1, 1925.
Having finished the official series I determined to con-
tinue the inquiry by havmg a number of private sittings
98] loiih the Medium, Margery. 141
at which Margery and her husband permitted me to be
present. These sittings were to be held informally, and
I hoped also to see some of the reported telekinetic
phenomena in red light and possibly some more of the
teleplastic phenomena. The first of these sittings was on
February 1.
Sitting XXI. {Private).
February 1, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9 p.m.
Present : F. H. ; D. ; Mrs. BroAvn ; Mr. F. Adler ; Dr. E. Brown ;
Rev. F. Edwards ; Mr. A. W. Gray.
This was a sitting for friends of Margery and F. H., and
what F. H. calls " An old folks at home gathering." There
were some few mental phenomena, mostly in connection with
Mr. Edwards, and these by request of F. H. have been omitted
in the following report of the sittmg which he has drawn up.
Walter came through almost at once, Avith whistles and
greetings.
Mr. Gray was told to keep his famdy away from dab-
bling in this matter of sphituahsm ; let them come to
Lime Street if they choose, otherwise let it alone, they are
too nervous.
A partly luminous throat stick was moved along table
and lifted from it. Its motions corresponded to motions
of the psychic's right hand, though the whole hand was
constantly curled inside F. H.'s hand.
Red hght telekinesis was promised for the next night.
Sitting closed at 10 p.m.
The next sitting, XXII., was on February 2, but was
negative. On the following day Margery appeared ill and
depressed, but on the same evening F. H. proposed a sitting,
XXIII. , at which we obtained only the vocal phenomena and
then not in the megaphone, which phenomenon I persistently
urged Walter to give to us. Instead, he promised the
materialised talking head, although I tried to explain how
much more important the voice in the megaphone would be
if we could get it under control conditions. The refusal to
entertain any proposals for obtaining certainty of the in-
dependence of the voice is to be noted in this connection.

Present: F. H. ; Mr. F. Adler ; D.
At this sitting the materialisation again appeared, and again
I took the opportunity to discover a single fact which would
seem to prove the second hypothesis invalid and which would
compel me to return to the first. The masses were quite
different from those seen before. Instead of a clammy, greyish
thickened mass appeared an object made of a rough white skin,
clearer looking than before and more finished in appearance.
This is what we would expect upon either hypothesis, that is
to say, that the regularity of forms and general finish was due
to practice, normal or supernormal. The following is a record
of the sitting :
Light trance in three minutes. Then a mass appeared
on left thigh—felt by Mr. D., 5" long and 1" thick, cool
and clammy, heaped up—softer than formerly. Psyche's
hand combined with D.'s was on it for next 15 minutes.
Her hands were restless—a roj)y connector or cord with
shiny rings or necks Avas felt going towards her body.
Then a flaj) was heard on table as if mass were put on
table. Then it was felt by Mr. D. Then we were per-
mitted to see it in red hght—2 sees., then 5 sees.—like a
small spaniel's head or the skull of a fish—mass whiter
than ever before—hke rough white skin—soft and resihent to
the touch, and grew less clammy and was quite dry and
gristly. Mr. Adler says : "It was a soft, quite cool sub-
stance, with whitish skin." We then had 6 periods of
5 sees, each with full red light to look at it. Each time
it appeared to take undoubtedly different forms (like stump
of hand or a big crumpled rose, etc., etc.).
Then the mass was seen in red light on the abdomen
three times. Then it appeared on the table again with
finger-like processes over edge of table towards Psyche.
Then it was seen again on abdomen, showing attachment
of the umbilicus, thick ropy. D. tried to discover if it
were withdrawn into umbiUcus, but canj^only say it ap-
peared to emerge from there and so stayed. When D.
98j tvith the Medium Margery.
asked for withdrawal the mass below moved upwards as
if jDreparatory to answering the request.
Walter was in excellent humour. Amongst other things
he said :
" Pay no attention to her, let her groan. She
really hasn't any pain. Blow your nose, Kid. I'm like
an octopus, I can attach myself anywhere and then put
life into it. She must sit every night. Don't ask her
how she feels. We have much to do in the next ten days."
During the sitting the victrola slowed down for at least
fifteen minutes (Walter said it was sick) and then resumed
normal speed.
Psyche complauied of pain at intervals, and pointing it
out by putting her hand on one side, on the other (D. or
F. H.) said—" It hurts here "—and the hand was then put
on the mass or on the cord as if it were part of lier.
Walter said :
" Cut three inches off the table legs.
Dingwall and I are two head apart. Let her wake up
gradually and then rest ten minutes."

The two classes of phenomena at this sitting were (a)
the materialisation and {h) the slowing of the victrola.
This latter phenomenon had been repeatedly observed be-
fore my arrival in Boston, but this was the first occasion
that it had occurred in my series.^ The victrola is
driven by an electric motor attached to a lamp holder and
runs evenly during the sitting, a repeater being used so
that the same record is played over and over again. I
had made a cursory examination of the apparatus, but
not being an electrician my inspection was of little service.
On handling the connection, however, the motor suddenly
stopped, for what reason I was unable to discover, as all
the connections were securely attached. On mentioning
the matter to F. H. he soon remedied the fault, although
he did not tell me wherein the trouble lay.
With regard to the materialisations, these differed con-
siderably from those seen previously. In the first place

144 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
they no longer appeared solid or semi-solid, but as if in-
flated by air. The same experiment was tried regarding
the mode of attachment to the navel, but again it failed.
When I asked for the cord to be withdrawn into the
navel the mass beneath moved, but not the cord from
the abdomen. The feel of the cord also was different
from that experienced before, and the rings or necks which
were tangible upon it again reminded me of what would
seem to be perceptible were a trachea to be handled in
the same manner. We repeatedly handled the substance
upon the table, both in darkness and light, and at times
the pressure I exerted upon the substance was considerable.
The ends of the " fingers " were stiff and skinny, and
powerful pressure upon them produced no effect on the
medium, who groaned only when the whole structure was
pressed by the palm of the hand or by the fingers. This
sitting did nothing to support the validity of the first
hypothesis, and indeed gave material to the second. My
attempts at obtaining a single phenomenon which would,
if properly observed and checked, have done much to
restore my confidence had signally failed. The periods of
darkness and light were still occurring at just those in-
tervals when they were most hindering to observation,
and the presence of the right hand of the medium in her
lap during a great part of the sitting was also a circum-
stance to be noted. From the point of view of the
second hypothesis there was nothing impossible in what
had occurred, and the appearance of the new form of
teleplastic material was consistent with the idea that a
fresh supply of the " substance " had been obtained and
shaped accordingly to need.

This was one of the most important sittings that I had with
Margery, and some admirable photographs were taken. The
following is the record of the sitting :
tvith the. Medium Margery. 145
Within seven minutes mass felt protruding from robe
and in Psyche's lap. Then a flap was heard on the table
top. Then Mr. D., with right hand controlling P.'s left,
felt the mass on the table. Movements were heard on the
table, main red light then on for five minutes ; this was
followed by varying periods of darkness and red light—and
occasionally by red torch only. At these lighter periods
we observed the object lying on the table. It appeared
to vary in form, as if the thing was one mass which
changed its shape ; to F. H. and Mr. A. it appeared as
if fingers Avere not visible at times, but the whole mass
was fused together like molasses candy ; to Mr. D.
and Mrs. H. it looked like different poses of the
same object (to F. H. it was molten, to Mi-. D. it was
posed).
Mr. D., by j)ermission, lifted the mass in his right hand
and estimated it to weigh about 2\ to 3 ounces. Mrs.
Hemenway was allowed to lift the mass in her two hands ;
it weighed 3 ounces to her, it was cold ; it felt like a
soft baby's hand which was fat, no feeling of bones.
She lifted it in the main red light.
To Ml'. Dingwall parts of the mass appeared colder and
more clammy than other j^arts.
Mr. D. looked at mass through his magnifying glass.
The skin-lilie surface showed cross marks like that of a
very aged hand. Walter called attention to these mark-
ings three times Avith pride. He said :
" This mass is
really blood, the white corpuscles. When it goes back it
strikes the heat and dissolves."
After exposure in all to red light 15 to 20 times, two
j)hotographs were taken 6 minutes apart. The first one
was taken at end of a period of the main red light turned
on continuously Avhile Conant opened the cameras. At this
period Mr. D. put his right cheek three times on the mass.
It felt cool and dry like dessicated skin. The same period
of red Light was- on during the flash-light. This Avas true
of both exposures. Conant Avas also allowed to feel the
mass in red Hght. The second photo Avas of the Walter
hand, laid across Mr. D.'s right palm upwards—^photo-
graphed during red light.
146 Eeport on a Series of Sittings [part
Psyche, after the photos, was very uneasy, complained
(in trance) of abdominal discomfort and pain.
After second photo of object in Mr. D.'s hand, Mr. D.
asked F. H. to keep Psyche's right hand away from
object to see if it would detach itself by self-movement.
This was done. Psyche turned in chair and object was
pulled slowly out of Mr. D.'s hand as if pulled by Psyche's
body. It then fell off Mr. D.'s hand on to her lap, and
Mr. D. tried to follow it but was prevented by violent
movements of the medium and by her placing her left leg
on the table ; her hand took his hand to outside of left
leg away from the object.
Walter said he would then make a hand, but after
5-10 minutes try W. said further trial would probably
bring haemorrhage and so interfere with next sitting.
Psyche was weighed before and after sitting and lost

In this sitting the observations were similar to those
made the day before except that the control permitted
much more free handling of the substance. It had the
same appearance as before, and this time the cord seemed
to me to have a different feeling from that previously
experienced. It will be remembered how in Sitting IX.
the cord appeared to swell when the object on the table
moved. So in this sitting the cord changed its shape.
Firstly it seemed ribbon like and then round, just as if
some substance was passing through it into the " hand."
In order to try to discover whether this was indeed
occurring I obtained permission to raise the hand from
the table. It appeared to be a light skinny bag weigh-
ing about 2| or 3 ounces. The skin was white and
showed criss-cross markings, but Walter's description
of the mass can scarcely be taken seriously. After the
second photograph had been taken I determined to try
an experiment in order to see whether it were possible to
obtain a decisive test by the application of something
Fig. B,
Platk III
Fig. C,

98] with the Medium Margery. 147
more than mere persuasion. The complete demateriahsa-
tion of materiahsed hands withm the hands of the ob-
server has been reported so frequently with other mediums
that it seemed to be a good opj)ortunity to try in this case.
I therefore requested F. H. to keep the medium's hand
away from the object and myself secured the " hand " in
my left hand. The medium at once began to turn in her
chair and the mass was pulled out of my hand. It
seemed simply an elastic bag and crumpled up as it was
pulled away. I tried to foUow it when it fell uato the
medium's lap, but she resisted strenuously, throwing her
left leg on to the table and forcing my hand away from
it with her own. Another crucial test had failed com-
pletely.
I print three photographs to illustrate this sitting. (Plate
III, Figs. A, B, c). Fig. A shows the " hand " lying upon the
table taken by a stereoscopic camera to the right of the
medium ;
Fig. b is the same taken from the left ; and Fig.
c is a view of the " hand " lying over my hand. These
results are exceedingly interesting. In Fig. a we see a right
hand with three fingers and part of a bent thumb curled
round towards the left, T. It appears made of wrinkled
skin, and on the right side on the part nearest the edge
of the table are little pits or depressions on the surface
resembling the cut-tube-like appearances noticed before, P.
Plate III, Fig. B shows the hand as seen from the left. This
time the thumb appearance is seen to be composed of
what is presumably meant to be a thumb and third finger.
Crudely formed nails are clearly visible upon both thumb and
finger. The beginning of cord is seen hanging over the side
of the table, the substance being rounded and seeming to
dip downwards sharply as it drops over the edge. At the
base of the thumb is another crater-like depression like
that seen in the first photograph, and the markings are
more knobby and uneven.
The third photograph (Plate III, Fig. c) shows the hand
hmply lying over the fingers of my outstretched hand.
Instead of havuig a solid and substantial appearance it
is flaccid and shrivelled exactly as if it had been deflated.
The depression seen in the second photograph towards the
148 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
right hand portion of the hand is clearly visible, and the
whole appearance is one of deadness and entire absence of
vitality. Indeed, the photographs strikingly confirm what
touch had already suggested, namely, that we have here
a dead unanimated structure which, if endowed with
vitality borrowed from its creator, exhibits no signs of
such life under close inspection and touch.
After the sitting on February 5, and during the hours
following the events of the same day, I had impressed
very forcibly upon F. H. and Margery the extreme de-
sirability of having test conditions for at least a few
sittings, especially for experiments with the materialisations.
F. H., however, was of the opinion that there would be
no more materialisations for the present, and his opinion
seemed so positive that I could scarcely conceal my
surprise. I had, however, noticed before that both F. H.
and Margery seemed to be aware when materialisations
were to be expected, and this fact seems important in
view of the second hypothesis. The reason doubtless
alleged for this prior knowledge is that the control tells
them what to expect, but the control often promises
phenomena which never occur, so that the reasonable
position would seem to be of expectancy and anticipation
rather than confidence. However that may be, F. H.,
both on February 6 and 7, broadly hinted that the
materialisations were over and should not be essayed out
of regard for the medium's health. It is true that during
this period Margery appeared ill and depressed, but I had
hoped that by February 9 she would be well enough to start
a series of sittings in the Hemenway home at which F. H.
would not be present. The sitting, XXVI, on February 6
was entirely negative, as was also that, XXVII, held the
next day, February 7. On February 9 Margery still com-
plained of being unwell, and I had to cancel the sitting for
that night. The end of my visit was now approaching, so I
preferred that we should hold two sittings in Lime Street,
at which Margery should sit in her accustomed place and
at which F. H. should not be present. I also proposed
that she shovild wear the luminous bracelets and head
disc as before, but that I should control both her hands
98] loith the Medium Margery. 149
and feet, and that on the table and on the floor around
her should be jilaced objects, in order that we might try
for telekinesis under similar, although not so strict, con-
tions as with Willy Schneider. The first of these sittings
was on February 10.
Sitting XXVIII. {Private).
February 10, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 9.10 p.m.
Present : Dr. Mark Richardson ; D.
Dr. Richardson sat next to me and held my left arm with
liis right hand. His left hand was more or less free and he
wore a luminous wistlet on his sleeve. I held both Margery's
hands and had my unshod feet upon hers. On the table were
the tambourme, the sjjatula ^^'ith luminous handle, and the two
luminous rings. On Margery's right on the ground were the
small megaphone standing on its larger end with the basket
on the top of the smaller end ; the ukulele and, at the back
of the cabinet, the Scientific American bell box. On the
medium's left towards the back of the cabinet stood the
second small megaphone with a luminous band around it. The
arrangements for this sitting were carried out in order to de-
termine how far (if the first hypothesis be true) the medi-
umistic faculties of Margery were capable of overcoming the
difficulties of a new control. For this purpose I had arranged
the sitting for telekinesis only, and it will be seen how various
objects which had been accustomed to be used during the
entire series of the sittings had been placed round the medium
in all directions.
At this sitting there were no phenomena whatever, the
sitting closing about 9.45 p.m. The result was exceedingly
disajDpointing. The complete absence of the voice phenomenon
was noticeable and regrettable, since my close position would
have enabled me to discover with some degree of assiu'ance
the place from which it was directed. Not one of the several
objects which were on the table and floor were moved, and
even if this had been done under the conditions obtaining it
would scarcely have been considered entirely conclusive. The
medium, however, was unwell, and perhaps this may account
for the total failure.
150 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
Sitting XXIX. (Private).
February 11, 1925. 10 Lime Street. 8.50 p.m.
Present : Dr. Mark Richardson ; Mrs. Hemenway ; D.
The same arrangements obtained at this sitting as those on
February 10. Mrs. Hemenway held my left arm and Dr.
Richardson her left hand. The seance was a complete failure.
The medium complained of headache and left the room at
9.20 with nausea. Thus, whatever may be the reasons, the
two sittings which were held under conditions similar to, although
not equalling in rigidity those employed with such a medium as
Willy Schneider, were total failures. The voice was not heard
and there was no telekinesis ; there was not even a rap.
This was the last sitting I had with Margery. The next day
I had planned to go with Margery and Mrs. Hemenway to
Harvard in order to try a few psychological tests which I
thought might be helpful. 1 wanted to see how the medium
re-acted to the psycho -galvanic reflex, and my friend, Mr. G.
H. Esterbrooks, had very kindly consented to be present and
take the readings. When Mrs. Hemenway and I arrived we
found Margery ready to start, hut she informed us that F. H.
had expressed his strong disapproval of her visit and she would
not therefore come. The experiments, therefore, had to be
cancelled, and the incident constitutes one of the very few
examples of suggestions made by observers which were met by
flat refusal on the part of either F. H. or the medium. On
February 13 I left Boston e7i, route for England.
CONCLUSIONS.
Having comjileted this survey of my sittings with
Margery, it only remains to sum up my conclusions.
I liave tried to show in the jjreceding pages what plan
was followed during the investigation. I was not pre-
pared then, and I am not prepared now, to treat every
medium as a rogue and a charlatan, although I am fully
aware that many mediums merit both those names. The
methods I adopted succeeded to the extent that pheno-
mena occiured hitherto unrecorded in mediumistic history.
Now, as I have already said, this apparent success
98] with the Medium Margery. 151
may be due to two causes : Firstly, it may have been a
real result of the apphcatioii of a method which as re-
gards this medium was new ; or secondly, it may have
been but a pseudo-progress cunningly arranged according
to a pre-conceived scheme. However that may be, the
resulting phenomena were unique in many respects. How
is it, then, that they did not in the end insj)ire in me
complete confidence ?
Now, in the Margery sittings, as I have akeady said
elsewhere, the first hjrpothesis was held just as long as
seemed to me justified by my observations. Then it was
wholly discarded for the second, I think rightly, when we
consider all the relevant circumstances. But, it may be
asked, what observations were made which led me to discard
the first hypothesis ? What justification have I for dic-
tating what ought, or ought not to happen, or what sort
of appearance any specific phenomenon ought to have ?
Now, the answer to this question depends upon the con-
ditions to which the objector refers.
Suppose that I say that I am a medium and, sitting
at a table in a dark room, put a sponge upon the table,
telling my sitters it is teleplasm. Or to take an even
more extreme instance, suppose that by some marvellous
dexterity I place the sponge on the table in fidl light.
Now, the only methods by which my sitters can investigate
that sponge are methods of comparison. The rules of the
game forfeit any cutting, or seizing, or forcible handling.
The thing looks like sponge, feels like sponge, and acts
like sponge, but can we say that it is sponge. It is clear
that we cannot, but are we not justified in supposing that
it is until some quality is revealed which demonstrates the
inapplicability of the term sponge to the object on the
table ? Thus, if the sponge-like substance dissolved and
was re-formed before our eyes, taking definite shape and
form, then we would hesitate before saying that it was a
sponge, although it might be an object like a sponge
possessing these strange attributes. We neither know what
teleplasm is nor what it may resemble. For all we know
teleplastic formations (if they exist at all) may be just like
sponges, white paper, chifi^on, lungs, or rubber bulbs.
152 Report on a Series of Sittings [part
But this circumstance, if true, renders interpretation
exceedingly hard. For how can we tell that some tele-
plastic chiffon may not be real chiffon and a teleplastic
sponge a real sponge ? We cannot tell unless certain
tests are made, and the great majority of these tests are
forbidden. It therefore appears that the comparative
method is alone available, and it is precisely by this
method that I was forced to the conclusion that the tele-
plastic products shown by Margery exhibited none of these
qualities which one would have thought that they would
have shown. If it be urged that we have no right to
expect anythmg, then the only answer would seem to be
that it is idle to attempt to distuiguish the genuine from
the simulated, and that it would be more profitable to
turn one's attention to some subject less exasperating.
Apart, however, from all questions of probability, have
we any definite, fully substantiated data which may help
us in arriving at a conclusion ? I do not think that we
have anything so important as this. I might quote a
dozen incidents which favour the second hypothesis, but
at the same time I could quote another dozen favouring
the first. Perhaps the one great point which supports the
second hypothesis is that the phenomena witnessed by me
could, I think, be duplicated by normal methods, as I
have tried to indicate in the main body of this paper.
When one sees an experiment at a magical entertainment
one can easily satisfy oneself with some sort of attempt
at describing its modus operandi. It does not necessarily
follow that it is the -modus operandi used by the performer,
but if it has been thought out with any careful attention
to detail, it Avill furnish the thinker with at least one
method of producing the effect. So in my attempts at
pointing out the normal methods, all that I can claim to
do is to indicate the sort of methods I should myself use
if I were to attempt to duplicate the phenomena described.
Probably, if the phenomena were due to trickery, the
actual methods used were simpler than those suggested.
At any rate, they show, I think, that there is some
normal explanation, should the phenomena prove to have
been simulated. This point is the chief one which marks
98] with the Medium Margery. 153
the case off from such cases as that of Willy Schneider
or Pallaclino. For in these cases a normal explanation
covering the main body of their phenomena seems to me
to be lacking. I cannot conceive any normal explanation
for what has been observed ; and it is precisely for this
reason that in these two cases I adopt the first hypothesis
as opposed to the second, although I am always ready to
change my hypothesis if sufficient facts are brought to my
notice which would seem to justify it. If the phenomena
of Margery occurred under the same controlled conditions
as those with Schneider and were then proved to be
fraudulent, I should abandon any further investigation of
the physical phenomena. It is j)recisely because I am at a
total loss to describe the Schneider phenomena in normal
terms at all that the first hypothesis seems to me to be
reasonably justified as regards his work. It was because
I endeavoured (and failed) to secure the consent of F. H.
and Margery to try for the prodviction of teleplastic
phenomena inside the cage, that my mind began to turn
towards the possibility of the second hypothesis. The
reasons given by F. H. for his opposition were so totally
inadequate, and the conditions he rejected so satisfactory
from the evidential point of view, that I could not fail
to ask myself whether F. H. knew that the teleplastic
products which flapped about so gamely when hands were
available would cease their gambols when those hands were
controlled. The opportunity was so golden that the atti-
tude of F. H. seemed to me inexphcable except upon one
hypothesis. Similarly, the startling^ changes of January 20
following the brilHant successes of the previous experiments,
could scarcely fail to suggest that the self-mobility of the
substance was non-existent. The one fact which stands
out clearly in favour of the first hypothesis is undoubtedly
the personaHty and position of Margery and her husband,
and the improbability of their engaging in persistent
trickery. Apart from this, what remains to support the
reahty of the phenomena ? I have no satisfactory answer,
but hasten to add that my inability to furnish one has
^ I refer to the decided change both in the production of the substance
and its movements when displayed. (See p. 135.)
154 Report on a Series of Sittings [PABT
not yet persuaded me to accept the second hypothesis
with all its implications.
Since we have now discussed in a general way the
various problems in this case which . clamour for solution,
perhaps I may be allowed to point out a few comparisons
that can be drawn between the teleplastic products as
exhibited in the photographs and the normal structures of
the animal organism. It will be remembered that it was
suggested by Professor McDougall that the " hands " ex-
hibited certain points of similarity with the structure of
animal lungs, the appearance marked Tr in Plate I, Fig. a,
suggesting strongly part of the trachea, showing as it does
signs of rings which, as I have ah'eady said, might be
interpreted as the cartilaginous rmgs present in that part
of the animal anatomy. Similarly the appearance of the
surface suggests something analogous to lung tissue, and
the smell of the substance which, according to Dr. Wor-
cester, resembled the smell of the entrails of a freshly
kiUed animal, pointed in the same direction. However
that may be (and there is no certainty about the matter),
the points of resemblance between the teleplastic hands
and certain parts of the animal organism are worthy of
some attention. For purposes of comparison. Dr. V. J.
WooUey has j^rei^ared a crude hand from calf's lung (see
Plate IV, Figs, a, b, c).
Plate IV, Fig. A is the lung hung against a white back-
ground for the sake of comparison. The surface of the left
hand "finger" especially towards the tip should be compared
with the lower side surface of the forefinger of the "hand"
seen in Plate I, Fig. A ; and in the same plate the trachea,
Tr, should be noticed, with which compare the trachea seen
on Plate IV, Fig. B. Plate IV, Fig. c, should be compared
with Plate III, Fig. a. The orifices seen on the upper portion
of the lung closely resemble the similar appearance on the
right hand side of the " hand " on the table, and also
the same orifices are visible upon the other unpublished
photographs. The fact that these and other resemblances
appear does not, of course, prove that the objects are what
they resemble. Supernormal growth may closely resemble
normal growth. But the fact that if not supernormal

they would require for their production the kind and
degree of manipulative skill acquired by hands accustomed
to the handling of the human anatomy cannot be dis-
regarded when we remember that F. H. is a skiKul
surgeon. What conceivable motive there can be for the
fraud (if fraud it were) beyond that of testing the sus-
tained credulity of psychical researchers I am at a loss to
imagine. Pojmlus vuU decipi, and there is no particular
importance in showing it. The importance would be in
the deception of different observers of a high degree of
competence by a medium consenting to sit under the most
rigid test conditions. Apart from these considerations, the
mediumship remains one of the most remarkable in the
history of psychical research. It may be classed with those
of Home, Moses and Palladino as showing the extreme diffi-
culty of reaching finality in conclusions, notwithstanding the
time and attention directed to the investigation of them.
NOTE BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM McDOUGALL.
[The following note is taken from a letter from Professor McDougall to
Mr. Dingwall, dated May 28, 1926, in reply to an invitation to add any
comments wlaicli might be thoi.ight desirable.]
There is only one point of some slight importance in which, so far as
I have noticed, my notes and recollections do not quite tally with your
account, namely in regard to the sitting Jan. 9 [pp. 115 seq.]. I recall
fairly confidently that the forehead limainous disc was displaced before all
three of the occasions on which I controlled for a few seconds the right
hand of Margery as well as F. H.'s left hand. . . . The disc, you will
remember, became visible to me and at least one other at the moment
the third movement of the ring concluded and was seen retreating
upwards from the table. I have described this in my article in the
A.S.P.R. Journal [June, 1925, pp. 300, 301]. Its importance is that
these three occasions were the only ones upon which the telepjlasm
seemed to move {i.e. more than a very slight withdrawal due to pull on
the cord) when M's [Margery's] right hand was controlled ; and the
movements of the teleplasm are the only grounds for regarding it as
supernormal. . . .
(Signed) W. McDOUGALL.
Note by Mr. Dingwall.—My own memory is not clear on the point
raised by Professor McDougall, but I recollect that he mentioned what
he had observed soon after the sittiiag.

APPENDIX
NOTE BY DR. L. R. G. CRANDON
10 Lime Street,
Boston, Mass., May 21, 1926.
Mr. Dingwall, has been so good as to send me proof-sheets
of his paper {Proceedings, June, 1926) concernmg the "Margery"
mediumship. It is based on his experiences in Boston, U.S.A.,
in January and February, 1925, and is therefore unfortunately
' out of date." Control since then has been by wire lashings
in a glass cabinet. When ]\Ir. Dingwall was here, however,
he had whatever control he requested. He has now been so
kind, also, as to jiermit nie to " add any comments that I
may desire printed in an ajipendix."
Mr. Dingwall comments on his own paper thus ;
" Those
who have read it have all come to different opinions as to
the real views of the author." If the purpose of the Society
and its funds be to remain in a ludicrous position of straddling,
in order always to be right, it is here fulfilled. This fear of
hoax and fraud, which is the sole idea established by the
report, is the sad mental miscarriage sired by the ever dis-
creet M'Dougall. What an unworthy contrast do we here behold
to the courage and self-respect of Richet, Geley and Schrenck-
Notzing ! The Research Officer had the opportunity of being
tlic official discoverer of the outstanding physical mediumship
of modern history, but he " had eyes and saw not."
The inaccuracies, in fact, are so many that it is futile to
attempt to list them. The " Margery " mediumship, as always,
is ready to stand or fall on the notes made at the time and
signed by all sitters. The modern laboratory method has no
place for afterthoughts or " facts " made to help out an
hypothesis.
98] Note by Dr. L. R. G. Crandon. 157
The old Biblical sage wistfully remarlced : "Oh, that mine
enemy would write a book." He knew, as well as we, that
when a man starts to write on a subject which contains any
controversial element whatever, then the chances are rather
more than even that the result will be something extremely
vulnerable or jjatently ridiculous. When Mr. Dingwall thus
analj^zes the " Margery " phenomena it is obvious that he
must reason as follows :
{a) If I pronounce these phenomena genuine and they are
thereafter admitted by the scientific world to be genuine, I
am, as a psychical research officer, instantly functus officio.
(b) If I pronounce these genuine and " Margery " or F. FI.
are afterwards found to have produced all these effects nor-
mally, then I shall be laughed out of the psychic arena as a
credulous yokel.
(c) Therefore, I will posit " hypothesis I " supporting super-
normal origin, and " hypothesis II " pointing to a fraudulent
origin, then balance myself with exquisite orientation between
the two so that in whichever direction the psychic cat may
jump I shall be there. Could any course he more prudent or
more ingenious ?
From start to finish Mr. Dingwall has not jiroduced one
scintilla of probative evidence that the " Margery " jihenomena
are not supernormal. He has propounded a multitude of
theories of infinite variety as to how these things might have
been done normally. I have a better theory still. An accom-
plice small in stature, clothed and hooded all in black, with
felt slippers on, could wheel in a tea-wagon with Avell oiled
rubber wheels. It would contain " a rod "
(p. 100), " a piece
of apparatus to be held between the teeth "
(p. 100), " a half-
dozen different objects covered with a substance "
(p. 105),
" forceps "
(p. 106), " a glove-like sheath "
(p. 106), " forceps
covered with animal substance covered with saliva "
(p. 106)
(possibly an extra dish of saliva in case the first should dry
too soon), "a piece of same cut into disc sha^^e "
(p. 106),
" several pieces cut like sheeps' tongues "
(p. 106), " a round
mass of same possibly mflated "
(p. 106), " a rudely formed hand
of same " (p. 106), " a tube "
(p. 107), " a cord of animal
gut "
(p. 114), " a bulb "
(p. 114), " a bag-hke structure "
(p. 114),
" a nozzle "
(p. 122), " a long hair with wax on it
"
(p. 140).

No matter how good the control of " Margery " and myself,
the show would triumphantly proceed, unless a cold in the
head should cause the accomplice to sneeze ! Q.E.D. In
reality there is not one debatable point raised by Mr. Dingwall
which has not in the past year been resolved in favour of
supernormality. Under conditions of control, more severe than
any suggested by Mi'. DingwaU, evidence has been amassed
to a degree unsuspected by him. I have no space here to
detail it. Some of the later developments such as described
in the Journal of the American S.P.R. are known to Mr.
DingwaU. A patient awaiting of scientifically collated results,
would, I think, have been wiser than his present excursion into
the realm of fanciful hypothesis, which excursion is, to use
Mr. Dingwall's own phrase, " highly curious and intriguing."
I am temjoted, using the words in a purely Pickwickian sense,
to lay down two hypotheses to explain Mr. Dingwall's treat-
ment of the subject as far as hypothetical explanation goes.
Hypothesis I. The author is a nut.-*-
Hypothesis II. The author is a nut.
" The evidence seems to me at one time for and at one
time against " one or the other of these hypotheses, but I
am consoled by the fact that ultimately Mi'. Dingwall will,
like the honest investigator Avliich he is, both know and
declare that in the " Margery " case we are dealing with genuine
supernormal iilienomena. Till that time, all of us must be
patient.

KEVIEW.
Mk. Hudson Hoagland's " Report on Sittings with Margery."
Atlantic Monthly, November 1925.
The '
Margery ' problem, elsewhere amply dealt with in the
present volume, is one of such constantly shifting scenes that
it is almost impossible to keep pace with its development.
We have first the operations of the committee of the Scientific
American, who, after something like 90 sittings, arrived at
conflicting conclusions : the majority negative, the minority
positive regarding '
Margery's '
claim to supernormal faculties.
We then have Houdini's '
exjsosure,' the accuracy and method
of which appears disputed by at all events some of the above-
mentioned majority. Next, IMr. Ding-wall's series of experi-
ments, and his Report, noAv issued, from which it appears that
circumstances led him to box the compass of most opinions
and to end with none. Then Mr. Bird's book, which, however
it may be open to criticism as regards details, yet unquestion-
ably puts up a claim for the occiu'rence of certain phenomena
not lightly to be dismissed. Then at last, in November, there
appeared in the Atlantic Monthly an article by Mr. Hudson
Hoagland, a member of a committee of young Harvard
graduates, with which was associated a casual sprinkling of
miscellaneous scientists, which, taken at its face value, cer-
tainly seemed to give the death-blow to '
Margery's '
claims
as a medium. An analysis of this Report, in conjunction with
later developments, shows, however, that the end is not yet,
and that before these claims can be regarded either as esta-
blished or scotched beyond reasonable question, a much more
authoritative verdict must be awaited. In short, the Report,
somewhat magniloquently described by the Atlantic Monthly
as '
the Chmax to a Famous Investigation,' is not a chmax
at all.
160 Everarcl Feilding. [part
I confess I do not share the view, which has elscAvhere been
freely expressed, that by virtue of their youth and inexperience
in psychical investigation the Harvard committee was incom-
petent to undertake it. On the contrary, from the full notes of
the experiments now pubUshed in a pamphlet entitled Margery,
Harvard, Veritas (Blanchard Printing Co., Boston, 1926) by a
group of '
Margery's '
supporters, and which claim to appear
" absolutely as witten and signed," ^ it would seem that not
only were the intentions of the committee both serious and
honest, but the conditions which they imposed or attempted
to carry through were well considered and their tests ingenious
and effective. It is rather the behaviour of the committee,
or certain members of it, towards one another and towards
'
Margery '
and her husl)and, and the almost preposterous
conclusions to which they arrive, which lead one to doubt
their competency, and which are so surprising as to leave one
Avith a conviction that, in order to make the whole story at
all vraisemblable , we must supply some fact or motive hitherto
undisclosed and one which, if known, may go to the root
of the whole matter.
I have, before writing this, had the advantage of reading
Mr. Bird's review of the Hoagland report in the December
Journal of the American S.P.R., to which I would refer
readers Avho wish to get a more complete account of the
facts. Mr. Bird, who as Secretary of the Scientific American
Committee, pronounced in favour of '
Margery's '
mediumship
and has since ranged himself wholeheartedly with her sup-
porters, was obviously in a difficulty when dealing with Mr.
Hoagland. Making all allowances for his position, his review
is, to my mind, an exceeduigly able and fair-minded produc-
tion. I see that he arrives at the same conclusion that
I had independently come to, that we have not been told the
whole of the story.
And now for the story itself. Mr. Hoagland described how
during the latter part of Mi'. Dingwall's visit he became
acquainted with Dr. and Mrs. Crandon and, with some other
Harvard friends, was admitted to sittings at their house.
Though several of the jjarty were franldy sceptical, the

the notes and, in reply, reasserted by the editors of the pamphlet.
98] Review. 161
Crandons welcomed their criticisms and suggestions, impressing
them with the sincerity of their attitude, and readily acquiesced
in their proposal to put the investigation on to a laboratory
basis and to hold sittings at Harvard. Certain conditions were
imposed. Sitters were not without '
Walter's '
consent to touch
or pidl any telejjlasmic arm, nor to use any light, white or
red, during the sittings, nor to expect to use new methods,
apparatus or controls. Dr. Crandon was to attend the sit-
tings, bvit, subject to the exclusion of any internal medical
examination of the medium, both he and she were willing to
submit themselves to search. I do irot find, however, in
Mr. Hoagland's Report any reference to certain other important
agreements which, as I learn from the various documents before
me, were also made, e.g. that the signed notes of each sitting
should be delivered to Dr. Crandon before the next sitting, and
that if no suspicion of fraud is entered in these notes it shall
be deemed non-existent. Nor do I find mention of the pledge
to silence with which Mr. Bird says these young gentlemen
jiledged one another, and Dr. Crandon, and Mr. Bird himself,
and everybody else concerned.
But to continue with Mr. Hoagland's story. They held
six sittings at Harvard, beginning on May 19, 1925, and two
at Mr. Hoagland's own house with the same group. It is
not my intention to burden this notice with details of their
experiments, for which readers should refer to the original
documents already mentioned. It is enough to say that from
the beginning the medium and her husband and, later on, all
l^resent wore luminous elastic bands on foreheads, Avrists antl
anldes. Although Dr. Crandon attended the sittings and,
except at the final sitting on June 30, controlled the medium
on her right, he was liimself also controlled by Mr. Hoagiand,
who " factually and visually controlled Dr. Cirandon's hands
and Mrs. Crandon's right hand, as well as the Doctor's knees
and head," establishing what was called '
double control '
;
and Mr. Hoagiand stated that it was with this double control
that most of the phenomena occurred. Another investigator
was assigned the task of visual control of the feet (by means
of the luminous bands), and a third that of the head bands.
At most of the Harvard sittings there was an ajDparatus to
jjass an electric current through the entire circle of sitters
h2
162 Everard Feilding. [part
wliich instantly registered in the hall, where an observer was
placed, if anyone broke the circle. In these circumstances
phenomena resembling those familiar at the medium's own
house occurred. " Apparently something resembling an arm,
presumed to be telejalasm, came from the lower portion of the
medium's body and moved objects within a radius of several
feet of her. This terminal was silhouetted against the luminous
surfaces of objects j^icked up [by it], and showed variations of
shape from time to time." Weights were lifted which a spring
balance—on which, on one occasion, the medium's chair was
mounted—showed were added to the weight of her body.
Sitters were touched by the teleplasm on the backs of their
hands or heads ; hair and clothes were pulled ; small luminous
objects were lifted ; the bell-box, described in Mr. Dingwall's
Report, was rung ;
and, in short, more or less the whole
programme familiar to those who have read that Report was
repeated. In addition, a coordinate board, 16 ins. x 24 ins.,
ruled off in inch squares by fine lines of luminous paint, was
introduced in the course of the sittings with the object of
getting '
Walter '
to pat his terminal out over this dimly
luminous field and leave it, so that the coordinates could be
read to the dictaiahone and dimensional drawings of the
silhouette could later be produced. Mr. Hoagland says that
Walter '
was most oljliging in this resj^ect, sometimes showing
as many as three different structures on the board at once,
though of these only one at a time was active, the others
aj^parently being motivated by the active arm. This active
arm was always moved rapidly over the board so that prior
to the sitting of June 2!) they were never able to get an
adequate idea of its dimensions, except that it was long,
reaching the full length of the board on occasion, that it
taj^ered away from the medium and jjossessed a sort of crook
or liockey-stick formation at the further end. The other
objects varied in shape, and were described in the notes as
starfish and general irregular forms, one very common shape,
however, being that of a rectangle, rounded and somewhat
pointed at the front end, and about eight inches long and two
to three inches wide. The importance of this observation will
be appreciated later on. The control exercised was dictated
at the time to a dictaphone, and an examination of the notes
98] Review. 163
witten out afterwards and signed shows that in almost every
case this control, of both hands and feet, is reported as
perfect.
We now come to the seventh sitting held at Mr. Hoagland's
house on June 29th.
After a number of phenomena, including a long-drawn
attempt by Walter to tie a knot in a rope, Mr. Code, one of
the younger Harvard group, reported that the medium's
right ankle band was off. '
Walter '
denied this (untruthfully,
as he admitted at the next sitting, explaining that he did so
to prevent an explosion from a rude professor from the Middle
West who was making a mock of the proceedings generally),
and covered part of the complete luminous circle on the floor
with something. A minute later '
Walter '
called attention to
the anklets. The left one seemed normal, but the right one
slightly elongated as if over both instep and heel. '
Walter
'
said, " I can hide them from you any time I Avant," and
proceeded to obscure most of the right anklet. The notes
say : "It was clearly not the left foot that obscured the
right anklet." At the end of the sitting both the bands
were found on the feet roimd the instep and heel, but not
round the anldes as at the beginning of the sitting.
After this came a levitation of the so-called '
doughnut,' a
ring of luminous paper, which '
Walter '
brandished near the
face of the above-mentioned rude Middle West professor, who
blew at it violently and caused '
Walter '
to drop it from the
end of his terminal. '
Walter ' thereupon regained it, this
time holding it more firmly, and insisted on the professor
blowing again, which he did three or four times unsuccessfully.
This indiscretion on the part of "
Walter '
afforded Mr. Hoag-
land the opportunity he had long been wanting, since it gave
him a fairly extensive silhouette of the terminal against the
coordinate board as it held the doughnut in the air for some
seconds. What he saw holding the doughnut appeared to be
a human right foot, the toes clamped over the periphery of
the disc, creasing it in a way verified on examining it after-
wards. Further, by shifting his position, he clearly saw the
ankle and leg silhouette to a point above the knee, and since
the operation was successively repeated he was able to check
his observations several times.
164 Everard Feilding. [PABT
Immediately after the sitting, Mr. Code, who is said to be
a clever magician, and whose suspicions were previously
awakened by his observation of the dropped anl?let, proceeded
to give Mr. Hoagland and another sitter an imitation seance,
with himself in the role of '
Margery.' Controlled in the same
manner by these two, and with the anklets over his bare
feet, he contrived, under an assumed trance restlessness, to
remove his slippers and to take off the right anklet, covering
the rear half of the band, which was luminous inside and out,
with a slipper, giving the impression that it was still on his
ankle. With his right foot now free, he proceeded to duplicate
'
Walter's '
various effects. He rang the beU-box, levitated the
doughnut, pulled hair, vnitied Hoagland's shoe, and produced
silhouettes on the coordinate board, even showing two terminals
silhouetted at once, by the use of his leg and a slipper, which
latter produced the same effect as that of the rounded
rectangular object previously mentioned, which might, therefore,
in its turn have been produced hj the medium's slipper.
With practice he even prodiiced three objects at a time, the
third being part of the di-essing gown which he wore. Mr.
Hoagland suggests that some of '
Walter's '
shapeless objects
could readily have been produced by a corner of the medium's
dressing-gown. It is claimed that the effects of Code's leg-work
produced phenomena identical with those of '
Margery ' in so
many incidental details, which I need not particularise, as to
leave little doubt that similar means could have been employed
by her. The inference obviously was that '
Margery ' had
done everjrthing with her leg, and that the observer told off
to watch her feet had been amazingly unsuccessful at his job.
As it was, however, still arguable that it was her psychic and
not her normal leg, the experimenters were willing to give
'
Walter '
another chance.
It is stated in the notes to the sitting which preceded
Code's imitation that the bands used had been supplied by
the observers, and that though the medium had complained
that they were too loose and had attempted to tighten them
with safety pins, the band's coming off was made laossible
by the carelessness of the observers. Also, that it was agreed
that for the next sitting the medium should be asked to wear
luminous bands of adhesive plaster instead of the old ones of
98] Review. 165
elastic tape. It may also be noted, in view of what followed,
that there is an addendum by Professor Shapley, ^x}lo now
attended as a guest of the younger Harvard group, recording
an understanding that every effort would be made to avoid
pubhcity with regard to the investigations, to which the five
members of the group appended their signatm-es, agreeing to
the above understanding, among others.
They approached the nest sitting with interest. If '
Margery's
'
leg was to be immobilized and no phenomena occurred, it
would naturally be a strong confirmation of their hypothesis.
Mr. Hoagland says that before the sitting '
Margery ' herself
complained that they had supplied her with inadequate bands
on the previous occasion, and suggested the use of surgeon's
plaster to prevent the bands from falling off. The first thing
that happened was that '
Walter '
showed an uncanny knowledge
of what had happened after the last sitting, of Code's
imitation of the phenomena and of the conversation generally.
He then warned them to control the medium's feet not only
by watching, but also by holding them, after which he
proceeded, much to Mr. Hoagland's amazement, to produce
what seemed to be his usual terminal and rang the bell-box.
It soon appeared, however, that there was a marked difference
between the '
teleplasm '
of this evening and that of previous
sittings. The silhouette showed long tapering fingers instead
of the stubby formations formerly seen, and the reach was
only about one-third of what it had been. Whereas previously
'
Walter '
had generally confined himself to touchmg the backs
of hands or heads, he now readily allowed the sitters to feel
his ' hand,' which was cold, moist and flabby, with fingers
consisting of long, cordlike structm-es. It was also noticed
that there were slight but distinct movements of '
Margery's
'
right hand correlating with the movement of '
Walter's,'
leading to the inference that some artificial object was being
manipulated by it, in spite of the presumed control of it by
Code, who, in accordance with tlie arrangement come to the
night before, had taken Dr. Crandon's place at '
Margery's
'
right. At one time there were two hands on the table,
visible against the coordinate board, one being well formed,
and the other bemg " a long extension shaped like a cat's
tail."' After one of these appearances it is reported in the
166 Everard Feilding.
notes that Code's left hand, controlling '
Margery's '
right,
" has been on her right knee continuously." It is unnecessary
to give further details, though I may note that at the end of
the sitting Code reports that " Walter's farewell chuckle seems
to be high above '
Margery's ' head." I mention these two
obsei-vations specifically because they seem to show that, in
addition to falsifying the phenomena as Avill presently appear,
Code must even have been falsifying the notes.
And now for the alleged explanation of all this. After the
sitting, according to Hoagland, Code proceeded to coniide to
his associates that, following the sitting of the night before,
when he thought he had solved the means of the production
of the phenomena, " he began to look with concern at the
human problems involved." He had formed a sincere friend-
ship for both Dr. and Mrs. Crandon, who had at all times
shown the utmost goodwill towards them all, as well as genuine
faith in the jihenomena, and he thought the most likely
hypothesis was that the Doctor, at least, was sincere. He
went further than this, and thought that Mrs. Crandon herself
was also probably sincere, and he evolved a theory that, based
on a genuine belief in spiritism, on the powerful unconscious
suggestion of Dr. Crandon, on the psychic literatiire she
had been reading, and under the inlluence of the circle of
sympathisers, an artificial dramatic '
Walter '
personality had
been created, into which she would lapse casually, unremembered
by her normal consciousness, both in and out of seances, thus
causing her not only innocently, so far as her normal
consciousness Avas concerned, to produce the phenomena in the
seances, but also to prepare beforehand the artificial accompani-
ments and ajiparatus generally. Moved, therefore, by friendship
for her and her husband, and in order to prevent a catastrophic
exjjosure of the mediumship, he had visited Mi's. Crandon that
afternoon, told her of their discoveries the previous evening
and of their expectations for the forthcoming seance. (This, it
Avill be seen, explained how '
Walter "
had acquired his knowledge
of what had happened at the imitation seance.) He then,
confirmed in his belief by the conversation, decided to help
Mrs. Crandon out. Though Hoagland saj^s nothing of this in
his Report, it seems, from the other documents before me,
that Code claims to have adjourned with Mrs. Crandon to the
98] Review. 167
seance room at the top of the house and to have had a
dayHglit seance at which he ai^ranged Avith '
Walter '
the
procedure for the evening, and agreed to release '
Margery's
'
right hand to facilitate an alternative method for the produc-
tion of the phenomena which had hitherto been produced by
her leg.
And this is what he says that, unknown to liis colleagues,
he actually did. As a free hand alone is insufficient to
account for what occurred, it is further necessary to suppose
that other objects, felt and shown on the coordinate board,
had been prepared beforehand, and concealed internally in
such a way as to escape the search before the seance ; for
it is at all events not claimed that, in addition to putting
her own arm at '
Margery's '
disposal, he extended his courtesy
so far as to offer the hospitality of his pocket for the disposal
of these objects.
It is not only Code's conduct, to the strangeness of which
I shall rev^ert later, but also that of the rest of the committee
which seems remarkable, if judged by ordinary standards.
Notwithstanding the pledge of secrecy to which I have
alluded, Mr. Hoagland prepared the Report which I am con-
sidering, in which he was assisted by Code under the belief
that it was destined, not for pubhcity, but for a strictly scientific
circle ; and then, without the assent of his coUeagues, proceeded
to send it to a popular magazine. Code, to do him justice,
protested against this, and promjjtly released Dr. Crandon
from the pledge under which he too was bound not to
pubHsh the notes of the sittings which, superficially at all
events, even down to the end, appear to be in '
Margery's
'
favour.
A reviewer unacquainted with the personalities in the case
is at a great disadvantage when trying to appraise the value
of the Hoagland Report. A& Mr. Bird says, it is well done,
and he admits tliat he does not see how, to one having no
furtlier source of information, it could be other than con-
clusive. I quite agree, but its full acceptance seems to me
to depend on affirmative answers to the following questions :
(1) Is Code telling the truth about his interview with
'
Margery 1 and his arrangements -with her—or with 'Walter,' if
one admits the validity of his theory of the complete dis-
168 Everard Feilding. [part
•
sociation between these two—to collude in the phenomena at
the last sitting ?
(2) Was his imitation of the phenomena really as successful
as claimed, and was it performed in the same conditions of
control ?
(3) Assuming the freedom of a leg in the first six sittings
prior to that of June 29, could aU the phenomena then
manifested have been produced by it ?
As regards the first question, if one has only Code's conduct
and such poor evidences as he offers for the possession of even
the gUmmerings of common sense to go upon as credentials for
his good faith, T should esteem the answer somewhat doubtful.
The theory of the real imiocence of mediums caught flagrante
delicto is a favomrite one among spiritualists, but while I am
not prepared to deny tha.t in certain cases, where no apparatus
is used, it may, and probably has, some validity, I think that
to apply it to such a case as this, where long, elaborate and
skilful preparation is indispensable, argues an unsophistication
of intellect, to put it mildly, which I can scarcely believe
possible in a Harvard graduate. But apart from his capacity
for reasoning, Mr. Code's ideas of the line of conduct demanded
by friendship on the one hand, or loyalty to colleagues on the
other, seem to be little less than pathologically peculiar. To
save '
Margery ' from an exposm-e he leads her—it must be
assumed under a pledge of secrecy—^into further fraud, and
then immediately, that very night, splits on her. Further, by
way of assisting his friends in their investigation, he stages
an elaborate deceit in which he himself takes part, without a
word of warning to them beforehand. Of course, Mrs. Crandon
denies the whole story, and there is a suggestion of an
undisclosed eavesdropper at the interview who confirms her
denial. She admits that Code told her of the grouji's con-
clusions and offered to release her hand at the next sitting, and
says that she indignantly declined. And that Mrs. Crandon
would be so innocent as to walk into a trap laid so openly is,
to judge by all one has heard of her extremely alert intelligence,
at least as unbelievable as Code's theory of her sweet natural
guilelessness if the phenomena are fraudulent.
The interview at which the collusion was arranged must
indeed have been a strange one, for I find in the pamphlet
98] Review. 169
Margery, Harvard, Veritas a quotation from a letter from Code
to the Boston World of October 25 to the following effect :
" Margery never '
confessed '
to me at any interview or sitting,
private or public, nor did I ever say she did." It is difficult
to understand how one can arrange to become an accomplice
to a person who does not admit that she needs one. IMr.
Code will, I presume, say that it was '
Walter '
who confessed,
not '
Margery.' So that one must suj^pose that after Mrs.
Crandon had been charged with fraud, and denied it, she
deliberately granted a dayUght sitting to enable Code to make
the same charge to '
Walter.' It seems on the face of it
remarkably improbable. " People don't do such things," or
if they do, there must have been some motive actuating
either Mrs. Crandon's or Mr. Code's behaviour which wholly
eludes the public.
As regards my second question, Mr. Bird tells us that he,
too, had a two-hours' session with Mr. Code, in which the
latter exhibited his mediumistic prowess. He says his repro-
duction of a certam part of the phenomena left little or
nothing to desire, but that his attempts to reproduce others
were a gross failure. For this, indeed, lack of long ]oractice
would normally account, but he says the failure was made
worse by Code's comj)lete lack of appreciation that he had faUen
short.
And as regards my third question, it is quite impossible, as
I have foimd in other cases, to judge of the feasibility of this
or that effect from a \\Titten record. Mr. Bird is of opinion
that even at the one seance at which he attended it would
be necessary to suppose some other agency than a mere leg.
How far his opinion is coloiu'ed by his other beliefs I have no
means of judging.
To sum up : IVIr. Bird, who says he has had close and
cordial relations with Code for some months, coixfesses that it
is extremely difficult for him to believe that either he or
Mrs. Crandon is deliberately lying about this question of the
interview. Yet, as he points out, one of them is obviously
carrying a desperate lie to the last desperate ditch. For me,
who am unable to judge of the personal equation, it is impos-
sible to form any opinion on so deUcate a question as to
which is the culprit. The scales, of course, are heavily
170 Review. [part 98
balanced against a medium on her defence, while the only
motive that can reasonably be ascribed to a departure from
truth by any of the Harvard men is that which is indicated
by '
Margery's ' supporters, viz. that the scientific prejudice
against an acceptance of this class of phenomena is so strong
that their reputation and position at the University would be
gravely imperilled by their endorsement of it. On this point, a
statement by one of the group appears in the New York Times
of March 4, 1926. He says :
" Harvard, far from discouraging
investigations, helped us all it could ; its psychological depart-
ment lent us a laboratory and agreed that Mrs. Crandon's
mediumship might be treated as a subject for a possible
doctorate thesis if results were obtained constituting a '
con-
tribution to learning.'
"
But it would seem that whether or not '
Margery,' like most
other mediums, helps out her phenomena, if phenomena there
are, by the use of her leg, and by the concealment about her
of pieces of lung or other normal substances, her repertoire
is of such a character that the Hoagland report is not likely
to be accepted as definitive. She is now, according to latest
reports, in order to meet the Hoagland criticisms, sitting in
a closed and locked glass cabinet, with, her hands emerging from
holes at either side and bound with wire and sealed, and
with her head and feet likewise bound and sealed within,
and yet objects placed within are raised and moved in graceful
circles high above her head. She also succeeds in overcoming
the ingenious apjoaratus invented ])y Dr. Mark Richardson,
details of which will be found in the highly interesting
December number of the Journal of the American Society for
Psychical Research, for rendering it impossible for her to use
her own vocal organs daring the production of '
Walter's
'
voice, thus apparently demonstrating the independence of this
voice from the medium's. And until Houdirii, who has now
made it his business to expose by imitation the effects of
aU the best-known mediums in the United States, succeeds,
in the same conditions (which seems not to be his invariable
practice), in imitatmg these phenomena, judgment must, in
my opinion, be suspended as regards the finality of the
Hoagland Report.

PART 99
JULY 1926
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
Psychical Research and Established Science.
Delivered at a General Meeting of the Society
on March 18, 1926.
By Dr. Hans Driesch.
The historian of the future will assign to the Society for
Psychical Research a value and rank not inferior to that
which he attributes to those great societies and academies
of the past which have laid the foundation stones of new
and important constructions in philosophy and science, and
among which the academy of Plato is the most famous.
You may see from these words how highly I esteem
the honour which you have conferred on me by electing
me your president. The election has indeed been a real
pleasure to me, and there is only one point that might
have prevented me from acceptmg it : the question
whether I am worthy of this honour.
To tell the truth at the very beginning : I have never
made a successful psychical experiment myself, though I
have tried to do so. I have seen some phenomena, but
only as a spectator. Thus the only possible thing I may
M
172 Dr. Hans Driesch [part
claim to have done for the elucidation of our great object
is this, that I have prepared its road in a certain way.
For my own manner of thinking and working, both in
biology and psychology, has led me to theoretical ideas,
according to which the phenomena called " psychical " are
not absolutely isolated, nor almost paradoxical, so to speak.
The results of modern biology and psychology, in fact,
tend already in a certain direction, or, rather, reveal to us
already a certain side of Reality's essence, acquaintance
with which is able to make psychical phenomena, in part
at least, mtelligible. On the basis of modern biology and
psychology these phenomena cease to be something that
is absolutely opposite to our whole aspect of empirical
reality.
Let me, then, speak of psychical phenomena as being the
continuation of certain biological and psychological facts,
which are already well established and well known.
I begin with the physical, or rather psychophysical side
of Parapsychology ; and by these words I understand tele-
kinesis, levitation, materialization as occurring in continuity
with a living person's body, excluding at the beginning
materiaUzations without continuity, so-called " poltergeists,"
apports and the like.
Some of you will probably know that my conception of
biology is vitalistic. I, in fact, believe that I have been
able to prove, jyer exchisionein, that the mechanistic, or
rather summative, theory of life is unable to account for
the facts of embryology, heredity, and organic movement.
All this has been explained in full in my Oifford Lectures,
delivered before the University of Aberdeen in 1907-1908,
and more briefly in my London lectures of 1913, which
were published in the little booklet. The Problem of
Individuality.
The organism is, no doubt, a material system, i.e. a
system that consists of what we call matter, that has a
weight of so many pounds, etc. But a material system
is not necessarily a mechanical one. That is to say, all
events occurring in a material system wUl not necessarily
be explicable in terms of physics and chemistry, or, in
shortj mechanics, and are, in fact, not explicable in this
99] Presidential Address. 173
way, whenever the material system in qviestion is of the
so-called organic kind, as is shown by what I call my
vitalistic " proofs."
The forces of matter are at work in an organism ; there
is no doubt about this. But something else is at work
in it also, directing the material forces without changing
the amount of energy, to put it shortly. And to this
unifying, non-material, mind-like something I have given
the Aristotelian name of entelechy, well aware of the fact
that the meaning I have given to this word is not exactly
the same as that of the great Hellenic thinker.
We may say that entelechj^ controls the movement of
matter. Now it is very important for what is to follow
to observe that entelechial control upon inanimate matter
always has its beginning and its end. The first occurs in so-
called assimilation, of which dissimilation is the counterpart.
The conception of a beginning and an ending of
entelechial control being established in biology proper, we
at once see that aU physical phenomena of Parapsychology,
so far as they happen in continuity with a living person's
body, fall under this heading. Matter, not hitherto con-
trolled, begins to be controlled whenever a telekenesis,
levitation or materialization occurs, and ceases to be
controlled with their disappearance. The only difference
between ordinary vitalistic and parapsychological control
relates to the range or area of controlling ; this area being
of far greater extent in the second case than in the first.
But in a certain sense embryology is already " materiali-
zation " from the vitalist's point of view. Think of the
little material body, called an egg, and think of the
enormous and very complex material body, say, an
elephant, that may come out of it : here you have a
permanent stream of materializations before your eyes, all
of them occurring in the way of assimilation, i.e. of a
spreading of entelechial control.
We have already said that entelechy controls matter
without changing the amou.nt of energy in the controlled
organism. We may at least conceive vitalism in this way.
The action of entelechy, then, is merely an ordering one ;
it " creates " nothing, neither energy nor matter.
174 Dr. Hans Driesch [part
But does this not also hold in Parapsychology ? Matter
is everywhere ; and we need only assume that in levita-
tion, materialization, etc., as far as these phenomena take
place in bodily continuity with the medium, pre-existing
matter becomes ordered. There is no need for accepting
what might be called " creation " in any way. Only the
area of the ordering power is enlarged, together with the
increase of the area of control in general, as mentioned
above ; for to control means to order.
All those physical phenomena of Parapsychology are thus
a part of a sort of super-vitalism, but have nothing in
them that is absolutely alien to the phenomena of well-
established science. Now the relationship between the
abnormal and the normal, which we have studied so far,
was only concerned with the usual general frame of
becoming, so to speak : Control, the beginning and end
of control, ordering, have been the only points of dis-
cussion. But if we go more deeply into the matters in
question, a still closer relationship among parapsycho-
physics and normality reveals itseK.
In embryology an innate idea, as it were, is transformed
into material existence. May it not be that acquired ideas
are also transformed in such a way ? In a certain sense
we might say, perhaps, that this is already the case in re-
generation and adaptation, as these phenomena occur on
the basis of a specific state of affection of entelechy and
do not arise simply out of entelechy as a whole. But we
know of still other phenomena, in which the conception of
an " acquired " idea comes upon the scene in the clearest
way.
There are the well-known physiological effects of sug-
gestion and auto-suggestion : inflammation may be pro-
voked by the mere idea of it, and in a similar way all
sorts of physiological processes may be influenced. For
logical and methodological reasons I should not like to
say that the idea qua idea, or even that my conscious
possession of the idea qua conscious possession is the
active factor, for consciousness, in my opinion, is not of
a dynamic nature, but is a mere index of a specific status
of the active unconscious, or, rather, " super-conscious
"
99] Presidential Address 175
mind or of some specific so-called subconscious conditions
in it. But in any case we may say that in the Coueistic
phenomena just mentioned there exists an immediate
psychophysical effect starting from specific mental conditions
which are quite certainly not of the iianate, but the
acquired kind.
We, now, have only to enlarge again the area of
validity of this sort of psychophysic action to " under-
stand " the parapsychological phenomena in question, that
is to say, to recognise them as something that is already
familiar to us in principle. For this is certainly one
meaning of the ambiguous word to %mderstand.
What is new in materialization and the like is only the
truly /orm-building character of the effect of acquired
states of the mind indicated by siiecific ideas, and further
the fact that the effect is carried out at a distance, though
in continuity with the medium's body.
It is interestmg to notice in this coimexion that a
German palaeontologist, Dacque, has in fact tried to apply
parapsychology to phylogeny, in so far as he assumes that
phylogenetic modifications owe their origin to subconscious
ideas on the part of the organism. What is generally
called " mind " or " soul " thus becomes part of the general
entelechy ; and entelechy acts by morphogenetic parapsy-
chological auto-suggestion.
Here we see the reverse of what we have tried to do
ourselves : We have put parapsychophysics into relation
with some well-known psychophysical phenomena in order
to make the former familiar to us. Dacque, on the other
hand, tries to explain the morphogenetic process as a
whole by parapsychophysics.
But the idea that parapsychophysics only requires an
increase in the area of known agents is common to both
of us.
Let us, then, sum up : Vitahsm, in particular, if com-
bined with the theory of suggestion, prepares the road for
super-vitalism, i.e. for an understanding of a certain class
of the physical phenomena of Psychical Research ; we may
call vitalism a bridge that leads into parapsychology. To
a biological mechanist these phenomena would, in fact.
176 Dr. Hans Driesch [part
remain an absolute enigma. And vitalism is a well-
established doctrine to-day.
I even dare to say that if we were not in possession
of the parapsychophysical facts, we should have to suggest
that on the Jmmdation of vitalism something of this sort
might exist.
Our consideration of one aspect of the so-called physical
phenomena of our sphere of research has been rather
optimistic. I am sorry to say that a pessimistic chapter
is to follow.
What we are able to " understand " in one field, at
least in principle and by the assumption of an enlarged
area of the working of known agents, embraces only such
kinds of parapsychophysical phenomena as occur in con-
tinuity ivith a living person's body.
The great question now is whether there are not physical
phenomena of some other kind : discontinuous phenomena,
to put it shortly.
Haunted houses, poltergeists, apports belong here, and so
do all sorts of so-called ajjparitions which occur without
continuity with a medium's body and are yet not the
mere effect of telepathic hallucination, either individual or
collective.
The first question, of course, is whether all these things
are really facts. Crawford, Schrenck, Geley, have not
observed anything of this sort. All their levitations and
materializations did occur in continuity or at least possible
continuity with a living body, and the same seems to be
true with regard to those few cases of " Spook " which
have been investigated in a really scientific manner.
But the scientist must never say " never." And there-
fore, in the sphere of our purely theoretical discussion, we
may assume hypotlietically that most of the alleged
phenomena mentioned above are facts.
If they are, our super-vitalism does not help us : we
have to enter the field of a super-vitalism of a higher
order—the bridge <2ud real bridge is broken.
Of the spiritualistic hypothesis we shall speak later on.
This hypothesis would, of course, explain our phenomena,
99] Presidential Address. 177
but not on the foundation of a super-biology in the
proper sense. If we do not want to accept spirituahsm
and yet accept the phenomena as facts, the only thing
left to say, so it seems to me, is that the mind may realize
a morphogenetic action at a distance. This would then
be a really new fact of an original and elemental char-
acter. You might say that this means nothing but the
introduction of a hypothesis ad hoc or, rather, the intro-
jection of an effect into a cause, comparable to the
virtus dormitiva of opium. And I should not be able to
object to such a statement.
That we only need to enlarge the area of validity of a
causa vera in the case of such physical phenomena, which
occur in continuity with a living person's body, whilst
- this is not possible with regard to discontinuous psychic
phenomena, seems to me to explain the fact that most
people are so much more inclined to accept the pheno-
mena of continuity than they are to accept their counter-
part.
We now come to a theoretical analysis of psychical
phenomena ; and this is the field in which this Society
has made its greatest discoveries.
A terminological introductioji and a classification are
necessary m the first place, as the words in iise have not
always had the same meaning with the various writers.
But terminology is a secondary matter and so is all
classification. For I fully agree with Professor Richet,
that all classification in our field can be only a pre-
liminary one.
All psychical phenomena consist in the abnormal trans-
mission of something, which in this way becomes part of
the knowledge of somebody, either in the conscious or in
the subconscious form of kiaowing.
I mean by agent the person or object in which the
matter to be transmitted has its origin ; the 'percipient,
then, is one who knows about that matter at the end of
transmission, he is always a person. He may be either
mentally active or mentally passive ; and the same is true
about the agent, if he is a person and not an object.
178 Dr. Hans Driesch [PAET
By object I mean a state or condition of the universe
qua mere state or condition, i.e. without particular re-
ference to mental conditions embraced in it.
By telepathy I understand the fact that a passive per-
cipient acquires an immediate knowledge of another
person's mental conditions ; this other person, that is to
say the agent, may be conscious of what he gives or
subconscious ;
in both cases he is mentally active.
In mind reading the agent, in the sense defined above,
that is the person in whom the matter in question has
its origin, is passive, the matter in question being a con-
scious or subconscious idea. The percipient is active, he
wants to know, either consciously or subconsciously.
In experimental cases telepathy and mind reading may
be combined.
In clairvoyance the agent is an object, the percipient is
consciously active or not ; in the latter case we may
speak of spontaneous clairvoyance.
It may be that the three phenomena, defined so far
terminologically, are the same thing in the last resort.
But in any case we do not know that in the beginning ;
it even seems rather doubtful to me.
Prophecy is clairvoyance into the future, retrospection
into the past, cryptaesthesia into objects outside the limit
of the power of the sense organs, e.g. into microscopical
conditions.
There remains what has very badly been called psycho-
metry, i.e. the fact that in connexion with the perception
of some object the percipient has knowledge about the
history of that object and in particular about persons or
events concerned with it.
We proceed from mere classification and terminology to
theory, and begin by saying that, in any case, we shall
not jump into spiritualism at once. We leave this ques-
tion to the end of all, and shall first try to find other
ways of explanation ;
" explanation " meaning, as before,
the insertion into the general logical scheme of known
classes of facts, with permission to enlarge their area of
validity.
99] Presidential Address. 179
And at first we shall reject two sorts of explanation
which have been of a certain importance in literature.
It is meaningless to speak of a " psychic energy " pass-
ing over from the agent to the percipient or, in psycho-
metry, acting by an intermediate object. Kotik has
advocated such a view. But the concept of energy is of
as little use here as it is in normal psychology or vitalistic
biology. For the points in question are meaning, order,
ordering and the like, and energy has only to do with
quantity, being a measurement of causality as the pound
is a measurement of matter.
The second parapsychological theory in question is the
one which tries to explain telepathy and mind reading by
physical radiation, i.e. by electromagnetic waves originating
in the brain of the agent and affecting the brain of the
percipient. This, of course, is a purely physical theory,
and it is only possible on the foundation of so-called
psycho-mechanical parallelism, so much in vogue in a
former period of psychology. Baerwald, who has recently
given up the very sceptical position advocated before and
agrees that telepathy and mind reading—though only they
—are facts, has driven the radiation theory to its very
extremes. Now I myself believe I have shown that
psycho-mechanical parallelism is an impossibility. But that
is not relevant here, and I therefore shall oixly try to
prove that, even if the parallelism were a legitimate hypo-
thesis, telepathy and mind reading could by no means
be explained on its foundation. As Tischner has already
given us a very good analysis of the matter in question,
I shall only mention one specific topic ; but this, in my
opinion, is decisive. On the parallehstic theory there
would be a specific material state in the brain of the
agent, corresponding to what he consciously possesses at
this moment ; vibrations would go out from this brain
state and would induce the same material state in the
brain of the percipient. The percijDient therefore ought to
be in the same state of consciousness as the agent—but
he most certainly is not. And it is for this very reason
that the radiation theory breaks down. A man in great
danger thinks of his wife, and the wife " sees," let us
180 Dr. Hans Driesch [part
assume, the phantom of her husband. But neither does
the wife think of herself nor the man in danger see his
own phantom ; and this " ought " to happen on the
parallehstic theory !
But it is easier to criticize than to form an explanation.
What, then, shall we say in a positive way about the
explanation of psychical psychic phenomena ? How may we
be able to connect these phenomena with the well-known
scientific facts, as we have done m the field of parapsy-
chophysics ? Shall we also be able to construct a "bridge"
that leads into the psychical part of parapsychology as
we were able to do with regard to psychophysics ?
I believe that the ultimate foundations of such a bridge
are already given in the breakdown of association psycho-
logy. Modern normal psychology already, working with
the concepts of " Gestalt " and with directing psychical
factors comes in here ; and so does the modern theory of
complexes, of sub- and co-consciousness. The concept of
a mere summation, in analogy to mechanics, is given up
here, just as mechanics is given up in biology.
But for an explanation we need more than this.
Let me now say, m the first place, that I agree that
there is a certain relationship between telepathy and
mind reading, and that, on the other hand, clairvoyance
into the past, the present, the future, and into micro-
scopical dimensions seem to have a certain relationship
inter se. But the second group of facts, in my opinion,
is not reducible to the first, or, in other terms, clair-
voyance in its various forms—granting that these are
" facts "—is not reducible to telepathy and the like. We
therefore want hoo different kinds of explanation, one for
each group. This, at least, seems to be a necessity in
the present state of psychical research, though we do not
intend to deny a priori that in a not very near future all
psychic phenomena may prove to be one at the bottom.
Of course we do not speak here of muscular so-called
telepathy and mind reading of the Cumberland type.
Neither do we speak of all those cases in which any kind
of whispering of the Lehman type has certainly occurred,
combined with some sort of hyperaesthesia.
99] Presidential Address 181
But might not hyperaesthesia, in the case of Professor
Gilbert Murray for example, have played its role even if
any sort of real whispering was excluded 1 This is what
some people have assumed. And they have assnmed it
with regard to telepathy and mind reading as well as
with regard to clairvoyance—in the case of Herr Kahn for
instance—in this way explaining these tv/o groups of
phenomena on the same foundation. But I believe that
when we are faced with the phenomenon of reading a
folded letter in a thick envelope the assumption of hyper-
aesthesia is quite impossible, and that also in the Murray
case there are a good many particulars which exclude it
definitely.
Let me, then, follow my own way of explaining ;
always,
of course, on the assumption that all the facts enumerated
above are " facts," not telepathy and mind reading only
—
as to which no one doubts to-day.
It is a well-founded metaphysical hypothesis that all
Egos and minds and entelechies are ultimately one ; that
the Spiritual is part of metaphysical Reality, though this
One may under certain circumstances appear as the many.
Let me only mention some of the results of my own
former embryological work : One egg may give two or
four organisms a^id souls, if only you separate the
blastomeres ; and two eggs may give one organism and
one soul. Can souls divide and unite ? Would it not be
more adequate to say that Oneness and Manyness in these
cases depend on material conditions and have both their
last root in The One ? And not on embryology alone
may be founded the hypothesis of Spiritual Oneness.
Moral feeling and a good many other topics of our inner
life would hardly be understandable without the assump-
tion that everything which is spiritual and whole in the
world has The One as its last foundation.
It now seems to me that the assumption of The One
gives us the means to understand at least a little about
telepathy and its relative, mind reading.
By the aid of The One it may occur under certain
circumstances, unknown at present in detail, that one
182 Dr. Hans Driesch [PAET
of the many reveals to some other one his conscious
contents.
We are familiar with the phenomena of personal dis-
sociation, so well studied by Janet, Binet, and Morton
and Walter Prince. Here we see two or more Egos re-
lated to one Soul ; and they may know about their
conscious contents in a miitual way, though in form the
other Ego may appear to be a stranger. This may also
be taken as an analogy to mind reading and telepathy.
It seems to me that Wilham James has conceived our
phenomena m a similar way.
It is much more difficult to understand clairvoyance
proper, to say nothing about prophecy at present.
Here we might say that metaphysically knowing is a
primordial relation in the realm of Reality and that all
particular acquisition of specific knowledge occurs in the
frames of knoiving in general. And there exists even more
than mere knowing in an original way : all our knowledge
of the so-called a iniori type is already specific knowledge.
We may say that the subject-parts of Reality are in pos-
session of the most general type of order of Reality as a
whole. And all animals endowed with what we call
instinct seem to possess still more of specific Imowledge
in an innate original way.
Might clairvoyance not be a mere enlargement of this
innate Imowledge about particulars ?
Leibniz has called his monad a miroir de Vunivers. It
knows, according to him, everything from itself, though
most of it in the form of a petite perception, i.e. under
the limit of consciousness. All so-called psychophysical
interaction is nothing but illusion. The clairvoyant then
might be such a miroir de Vunivers in part endowed with
an abnormally low limit.
But I do not overlook one great difficulty of the
miroM'-hypothesis. Why, you may ask, do we have our
sense organs, why must we learn and undergo experience,
if at the bottom we are all clairvoyants ?
Let me answer that in the deepest state of hj^nosis
the Ego seems to remember everything that has happened
99] Presidential Address. 183
to it in detail, whilst the normal Ego has " forgotten " so
very many things. Here we might also ask : Why does
forgetting exist actu, if total remembering does exist
potentia 1 For we know that the latter does exist potentia.
The conscious state seems to be a handicap to the faculties
of the hypnotic state in the case of remembering.
Might not our normal conscious state be also a handi-
cap to our primordial miroir faculties, i.e. our clair-
voyant faculties 1 But why, then, does the normal con-
scious state with so many handicaps exist at all ? Shall
we follow Bergson's opinion, that the limited power of the
conscious Ego with regard to its memory and its miroir
faculty is a kind of adaptation, that a perfect memory
and an absolute clairvoyance would make us unfit for
actual life, overwhelming us with too many data ?
I must confess that I have no answer to this question
and that ur any case the contrast between the all-remem-
bering hypnotic state and the very poor memory of the
conscious Ego is one of the greatest problems to me. So
is clairvoyance in a still higher degree.
But facts always come first, and remain facts even if
we are unable to understand them.
Prophecy and so-called psychometry are still greater
enigmas to us than clairvoyance proper.
In some cases prophecy may be reducible to a " read-
ing " of the intentions of a human person on the part of
another, but certainly not in all ; and whenever prophecy
is related to mere objective conditions this sort of explana-
tion fails, of course, completely. It is an old assumption
that the world of genesis, to use Plato's term, has as its
last foundation or as its boundary something timeless : in
this sense prophecy might be the " reading " in the mind
of a superentelechy. But it is useless to go here deeper
into details.
Psychometry, finally, can certaiialy not be explained by
the assumption of some sort of energy investing, as it
were, the object in question ; this we know already on
general grounds. But what shall we put in its place ?
If the person, to whom the object in question belongs, is
present, we may assume that we have a case of mind
184 Dr. Hans DriescJi [part
reading before us : the person present perceives the object,
and all sorts of ideas related to it come into his mind,
in the conscious or the unconscious form, and are then
" read " by the medium. But this explanation is not
good for all cases, and I confess that I have no explana-
tion to offer for the rest.
At the end of all we come to spiritualism, which is, no
doubt, a legitimate hypothesis, i.e. a hypothesis that is
logically possible, for it does not contain a contradiction.
William James, as is well known, has confessed that the
Piper phenomena might be explained as resting on tele-
pathy and mind reading, but that spiritualism would
explain them in a less artificial and more natural way, so
to speak. He adds that for general methodological reasons,
following the postulate that entia non sunt creanda praeter
necessitate?)!, he prefers to keep to telepathy, and this is
certainly a sound principle of theoretical research.
But might it not be, in the face of recent experimental
results, that the necessity for creating new entia, namely
the spirits, would one day become absolutely urgent ?
Three classes of phenomena have been mentioned in
favour of spiritualism, called by British authors Cross-
correspondences, Literary Puzzles, and Personal Details. Of
these Personal Details, including Literary Puzzles to some
extent, seem to me to be the most important. We, of
coiirse, might bring in the operation of telepathy and mind
reading here also. But then we have to assume, first,
that mind reading is selective, and secondly that it is
guided by a certain totality not known to the medium,
i.e. by the idea on the part of the medium of the personal
character of a dead person. You may assume here that
this idea also comes from one of the sitters ; that it is
telepathically implanted into the medium's subconscious
mind, and that the medium then behaves according to it,
just as a hypnotized person in consequence of a suggestion
may " play " at being a child or a dog or Napoleon.
But there is no doubt that the whole explanation becomes
very artificial and complicated in this way, especially as
regards the selection of particulars. And it is a further
99] Presidential Address. 185
advantage of spiritualism, of course, that it would also be
able to explain such kinds of physical phenomena as occur
without continuity with a living person's body, as discussed
before.
But I do not regard the argument in favour of spirit-
ualism as decisive.
Let me shortly note that spiritualism does not necessarilv
include personal immortality in the common meaning of
the word. Oesterreich has remarked that it might be
possible that, under the conditions of mediumistic ex-
periment, the personality of the dead does nothing but
emerge from some super-person, into which it had been
absorbed, and that, after the experiment, it will surrender
itself again qua person. Then there would be immortality,
which in its most general meaning is almost certain, but
not personal immortahty in the strict sense, and even the
personal appearance of a dead person during the time of
experiment would not prove the latter.
Mackenzie, on the other hand, the Italian parapsycho-
logist, advocates the possibility that the so-called spirits,
speaking or writing by the aid of the medium, though
they are " persons," are yet persons of a quite artificial
and transient character, formed only under the conditions
of the experiment for a short time, just as the various
Egos in ordinary dissociation are formed. The spuit, in
this case, would then not be really identical with a dead
person, though he might resemble that person. This re-
minds me of the concept of Egoness as established in
orthodox early Buddhism (Hinayana Buddhism).
What then shall we say about the spiritualistic hypo-
thesis in the proper sense, including personal immortality ?
I think the only possible answer is, firstly, that we do not
know at present, secondly that we may know some day
in a scientific way, and finally that all of us xvill per-
sonally know in the future—if there is anything left to
" know " at all.
Let us sum up. We have tried to show that there are
bridges, as it were, connecting the world of mere matter
with Psychical Research. And we can find out some such
186 Presidential Address. [part
bridges. Vitalistic biology is a bridge leading into phy-
sical parapsychological phenomena as far as they occur in
connection with a living person's body. Modern psycho-
logy, the metaphysics of the One and the many and the
metaphysics of knowing, make telepathy, mind reading and
clairvoyance proper understandable forces to a certain
degree.
We have to leave unexplained all discontinuous physical
phenomena, prophecy, and most cases of psychometry—to
say nothing of apport and dematerialization.
In this field new entia must, so it seems, be introduced ;
and among these new entia may be spirits proper.
Thus, then, what we are able to offer is by no means
definitive.
Psychical Research is still in the state of a child, a
healthy, growing child. Let us hope that it may soon
become a man full of strength and power.
Then Psychical Research will form the centre of all
science and philosophy, the very foundation of what we
call in German " Weltanschauung."
At the present day the main thing we need is to get
Psychical Pvesearch under the strict control of experiment.
We are in the Galvani period—to speak by analogy; we
want to enter into the Faraday period. I am sure we
shall enter it one day. And I am also sure that, when
we shall have entered it, a good many of those, who are
not our friends at present, will say :
" We have always
said so."
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 187
A REPORT ON SOME RECENT SITTINGS WITH
MRS. LEONARD.i
By Mrs. W. H. Salter.
Introduction.
The incidents discussed in the following paper are taken
mainly from sittings held with Mrs. Osborne Leonard by
one of the Members of this Society, the Rev. W. S. Irving.
In Part II., however, I have grouped together certain
records sent to me from time to time by other sitters.
In only a few cases is any other medium than Mrs.
Leonard concerned. In the Ikon case (see below, p. 268)
the verification of a statement made at a sitting with
Mrs. Leonard occurred at the house of Mr. Vout Peters.
Mr. Peters wUl be known to many of our Members, and
an account of some evidence obtained through his medium-
ship will be found in Sir Oliver Lodge's Raymond, pp.
100 ff. In two instances (see below, p. 264 and p. 318)
extracts are given from sittings with Mrs. Warren Elliott
(Miss Violet Ortner), and on p. 297 is an extract from a
sitting Mr. Irving had with Mr. Vout Peters. In two other
instances (p. 222 and p. 306) exti'acts are quoted from
sittings with Mrs. Annie Brittain. Evidence obtained
through her mediumship has been printed in the S.P.R.
Journal from time to time. In particular I may refer
readers to the incident of " Charley L." printed in Vol.
XX. of the Journal, p. 122.
Mr. Irving had his first sitting with ]VIrs. Leonard on
Tuesday, January 25, 1921, and since then he has had
1 Part of this paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society
on February 5, 1925.
IT
188 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
sittings with her two or three times a year. Occasionally he
has acted as his own recorder, but as a rule he has a
note-taker with him. His sittings are all carefully re-
corded ; he may indeed claim to be a model sitter in
respect of the trouble he takes to verify and check every
statement made, so far as he possibly can, and I should
like to take this opportunity of thanking him for j)utting
his evidence at our disposal.
Mr. Irving originally went to Mrs. Leonard as an
anonymous sitter. After his tenth sitting, on July 25,
1922, he writes :
Mrs. Leonard told me that she believed she had learnt my
name during the holiday from which she had just returned.
She had read a letter in the S.P.R. Journal, signed " W.
S. Irving." She does not as a rule read S.P.R. works,
but a friend had asked her to read an article on psychic
photography therein, and she had, without thinking, read
further. She thought the letter might be mine.
This statement is worth quoting, if only as one more
instance of how scrupulous Mrs. Leonard is to mform her
sitters of any knowledge concerning them which has come
to her by normal means. Most of the sittings I am dis-
cussing here occurred after Mr. Irving's name was known
to Mrs. Leonard, but in view of the particular type of
evidence to be considered this fact is of little importance.
The purporting communicator at Mr. Irving's sittings is
his wife, who died in 1918 after a short illness.
The evidence considered in this report is of several
different types, hut most of it has one common charac-
teristic, that in part at least the knowledge shown by the
medium could not have been derived directly from the
sitter's mmd. The elimination of that one hypothesis
leaves us still with a sTifficiently complex problem, but it
does narrow the field a little ; and in view of the fact
that where the knowledge shown is possessed by the sitter,
telepathy from the sitter may be held the most probable
explanation, it seems worth while to give some special
consideration to evidence which does not fall within this
category.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 189
There are three other possible sources of supernormal
knowledge for which the cases here described afford some
evidence : (o) telepathy from living persons at a distance,
i.e. not the sitter ; (&) clau-voyance ;
(c) communication
from the dead. In some cases any one of these hypotheses
is admissible, and it does not seem possible in the present
state of our knowledge to form any opinion as to which
of them is responsible for the phenomena described. Some-
times the evidence seems rather to point to clairvoyance,
but whether the clairvoyance is exercised by the medium,
or, as alleged at the sittings, by the ostensible communi-
cator, we cannot say. The cases which aiford the strongest
evidence of communication with the dead are those which
either exhibit clearly some characteristic of a communi-
cator's personality or appear to be directly drawn from
the communicator's memory of past events (see, for
example, the " Lace Collar " incident, p. 286).
In regard to this question of evidence of surviving
personality. Miss Newton has sent me the following
expression of opinion :
Mr. Irving has read to me nearly all, if not all, his notes
on his sittings with Mrs. Leonard, and I have also read
a large part of them. I have been impressed by the
completeness and consistency of the personality of the
purporting communicator, which shows certain qualities
that seem to me from my experience of communications
received through Mrs. Leonard distinctive of this com-
municator, and such as do not occur with other sitters.
1. Newton.
With this short introduction I will now give in Part I.
of my paper a series of incidents taken from Mr. Irving'
s
sittings.

PART I.
EVIDENCE OBTAINED BY THE REV. W. 8. IRVING.
CHAPTER I.
Cases in which the Communicator Purports to give
Information Concerning Recent or Contemporary
Events, Unknown the Sitter.
It happens sometimes at sittings with Mrs. Leonard that
Feda—or, it may be, the communicator—asserts that she
has visited the S.P.R. rooms at Tavistock Square or some
other place associated m some way with the Society, and
she reports various more or less trivial incidents which she
j
says she has observed. One of the earliest of these
|
statements occurred in September, 1922, but there would
seem on this occasion to have been some confusion between
the S.P.R.—to which Feda habitually refers as " the
'searchers" or "the psychical 'searchers"—and the London
Spiritualist Alliance. There is some reason to suppose
that the same confusion occurred on a previous occasion.
§1.

Feda. This is to do with Psychical 'Searchers. They're going
to have a new group picture to hang up. She
sensed that very strongly. It's not generally known
yet, in fact she's not sure they've got it, but they're,
going to hang it up. Somebody else is leaving there.
Don't know if it's generally known, but she sensed
it. She does not mean Mrs. Nelly []\Irs. Salter], but
somebody who's been there a long time. And they
can't open tlie cupboard. Did they say anything
to you about not being able to open a cupboard ?
W. S. I. No.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 191
F. Dora [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] sensed distinctly
they'd not been able to ojien a cupboard and they
would have some difficulty with it. She supposed
somebody had lost the key or something. Oh !
I know they caU them types [tyi^ewriters]. Did you
know they wanted to change one ? She sensed they
did. . . . That's all about the " researcher " people.
Mx. Irving enquired of the S.P.R. Secretary, Miss Newton,
whether any of the statements made at this sitting could
be verified ; to which Miss Newton rejilied that none of
them seemed to apply to anything which had lately hap-
pened in the Society's rooms. Mr. Irving then sent the
same enquiries to Mr. G. E. Wright, at that time Secretary
of the L.S.A., and received the following reply :
Oct. 30, 1922.
The four items you mention certainly seem to connect
up with things that have happened here, though not all
of them are very near to date.
1. "They were going to have a new group picture to
hang up." No new picture has been obtained and hung
up, but at the time you mention we were re-hanging a lot
of pictures, which was a subject of some difference between
my colleague, Miss Phillimore, and myself. The picture of
a single figure which I had put over the mantelpiece was
eventually removed, and a picture containing a number of
figures siibstituted for it. The date was just about
September 22.
2. " Some one was leaving who had been there a long
time."
Mr. South, who had been at the Alliance over forty
years, gave up his post at the beginning of Jul}^
3. "They can't o-pen a cupboard."
Miss Phillimore, when she went on her holiday on
August 1, left two cupboards locked and did not leave the
keys, which cost me some little worry.
4. "They are thinking of changing a typewriter."
For some time we have been thinking of changing a
typewriter, as Mrs. Musgrave was using her own. The
Royal typewriter was actually ordered on September 13,
192 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
and delivered on September 16. This latter item appears
to me exti aordinarily accurate, but all four are good apart
from the question of time, and, as we all know, time
sequence is always very weak in trance communi-
cations. . . .
G. E. Weight.
In regard to the items numbered (1) and (3) in Mr.
Wi"ight"s letter Miss Phillimore adds a confirmatory state-
ment, and Mr. Wright sent for our inspection the invoice
for the new typewriter which is dated September 19, 1922.
With regard to the second item, Mr. South's resignation,
as Manager of the L.S.A. Book Department, was referred
to in the issue of Light for June 24, 1922. It is not
unlikely therefore that Mrs. Leonard had some normal
knowledge of this ; but in that case it is curious that
there should have been the apparent confusion between
the L.S.A. and the S.P.R.
This conftision is of course a weak point in the evidence,
but the coincidence between all four of the points men-
tioned at the sitting and recent events at the L.S.A.
seems beyond what chance would be likely to give. None
of them, it is to be observed, applied to the S.P.R.
§2.
I turn now to another incident of the same kind which
was subsequently linked uj) with one of Mr. Irving's
picture tests.
^
At two sittings of Mr. Irving's on April 17 and 19, 1923,
a series of statements were made about incidents at the
S.P.R. rooms. Out of these I select the following two :
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, April 19, 1923.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr. E. J. DingwaU.
Feda. Do birds come outside the window a lot ? At what
Feda calls " the 'Searchers' " place. She got a feel-
ing some one there noticing birds rather often. " In
a way I psycognitised that condition." Yes, she
thinks that's right. . . .
* See below, p. 283.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 193
Fruit ! Has some one been taldng fruit in there ?
You might just ask. I feel as if some one were
concealing fruit there. Isn't it a noosance ! She
says, " I couldn't see it, but I felt it, fruit, fruit."
She felt as if some one pushed it away somewhere.
She says, " You can ask nicely."
Note by Miss Newton.
I like the birds coming up to the window in our new
house. I noticed them when I went the first time to see
the house. They were busily hopping up and down the
branches of a tree that comes close to the window in the
small room we use as a dressing-room. I had a distinct
feeling of gladness when I saw them. When I think of
the country I think of busy twittering birds. Our offices
at Hanover Square were so high that we saw no birds
except now and then a single sparrow on the stone coping.
I used to wish that one could combine work with a country
outlook. The birds at the window of Tavistock Square
were unexpected and delightful. I have the same feeling
of gladness when I enter the room every morning to take
off my hat.
The fruit incident is as follows :
Returning from Provence on April 10, 1923, I continued
for a little Avhile a habit I had formed there of eating
next to no breakfast and a good deal of fruit an hour or
so later. On my way to the S.P.R. every morning for
about a week or ten days I bought three or four oranges,
which T brought in with me and ate with a feeling of
gene. Once I was interrupted by Miss Horsell [the Assistant
Secretary], and on my remarking that it was disgraceful of
me to be eating oranges in office hours, especially as some
one might call and not like the smell of oranges, she said
that some one was actually at the door at that moment
;
and I hastily thrust the peeled oranges out of sight under
the papers on my desk.
Miss Newton's original notes on this sitting were not
dated, but were written shortly after she read Mr. Irving's
record, within a week or so of the sitting. The notes
were amplified on one or two points and some fiu^ther
194 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
corroborative statements by Miss Horsell added on July
25, 26, 1924.
The' other statements made on this occasion were correct,
but are not sufficiently distmctive to be worth reporting
in detail.
§3.
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 29, 1924.
Sitter : W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr. R. R. Farmer.
Feda. Going to the Psychical 'Searchers' place ? She's taken
a jump, Mr. Bill, right to the Psychical 'Searchers'
home. . . .
Some one unexpectedly has had some flowers there too.
She didn't see them, but she could feel them. She
says, " I visualise them as being red. You might
enquire about them," she says. [Note 1.]
Wait ! A what ? Wrapped up to be sent away ? She
felt something had just been wrapped up and sent
away. Not for good. To have something done to
it and then come back again. A parcel. That's
right. [Note 2.]
And there was some one new joining the 'Searchers.
Dora says she doesn't think any one outside would
know this. While she was there she had a very
strong feeling that a new person—some one fresh
—
was going to be there, working there, joining the
'Searchers, the Re-searchers, the Psychical Re-
searchers. Some one new, some one quite new.
A quite recent development, she felt. [Note 3.]
" Who took the stamps V He can't ask that !
" Who
took the stamps ? Why weren't they there ?
"
[Here Feda hurriedly remonstrated that they might
think stealing was meant.] She says, " Just keep
it like that." [Note 4.]
Note by Miss Newton.
1. On January 29 Mr. Dingwall brought me a plant, a
red azalea in full bloom. The gift was entirely unexiJected.
Mr. Dingwall has never given me a plant before, nor
flowers in winter. He did on one or two occasions during
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 195
the summer bring flowers from his own garden, but not
red ones.
2. Sir William Barrett sent us some Parts of the Proceed-
ings and asked us to get them bound for him. The covers
for these Parts were received from the makers and de-
spatched on January 29 to various of our members in
accordance with the orders that we had received. Sir
William Barrett's Parts were made up in a parcel and
taken to the bmders with instructions that the bound
Volume was to be returned to us. We do not know the
actual day on which this was done ; the cover is not
included in the list of those sent out on January 29. The
order for binding was completed on February 13, and the
binders state that they probably received the parcel at
least a week earlier.
3. I do not know what this means, unless it refers to the
appointment of Dr. Woolley as Hon. Research Officer,
which had been discussed for some weeks before the
appointment was made. So far as I am aware no one
" outside would know."
4. / took the stamps. It was during the week commencing
January 21, when the railway strike was on and IVIiss
Horseli arrived late every morning and left earlier than
usual in the afternoon. She was not here at all on
Saturday morning, the 26th, and it was then I took
the stamp book from her drawer, which she keeps locked.
On the 28th she looked for the book, to make it up as
usual on Monday morning. She could not find it. I
thought that I had returned it to the drawer and I could
not find it. Some time during the day I came across it
among a pile of letters and papers on my desk. I do
not remember any other occasion on which the stamp book
was missing. I seldom borrow it, as Mss HorseU enters
the postage and keeps the book.
I. Newton.
(corroborated by) E. M. Hoesell.
With regard to the red azalea, another point is worth
noting. Both Miss Newton and IMr. Dingwall agree that
the plant was brought to the rooms on January 29, the
196 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
day of the sitting. Miss Newton thinks Mr. Dingwall
brought it in about 12 noon, whereas Mr. Dingwall himself
is under the impression he brought it when he came in
after lunch about 2-2.30 p.m. Mr. Irving's sitting began
at 2.40 p.m. on that day, so that even if Miss Newton's
recollection is correct, the plant had only been at the
rooms a few hours. The search for the stamp book took
place on the 28th, the day before the sitting.
In the case of the other incidents I have related, the
events to which reference was apparently made had oc-
curred some days before the sitting. I mention these
facts as they have some relevance to the question of the
modus operandi.

Feda. Now she want to go to the Psychical 'Searchers now.
Wait a minute. Are they getting a new lamp ?
Got a feeling some one has just been talking about
getting a new—She says, " I think I'm using the
right word—lamp, lamp. To use in the Psychical
'Searchers' rooms."
Note by Mr. Dingwall.
On July 11, 1924, I bought a tubular electric lamp to
fit the note-taker's desk in the laboratory. There had been
a good deal of discussion as to the best source of light
and several lamps had been inspected and tried before
deciding upon the one which was eventually bought.
E. J. Dingwall.
Jidy 20, 1925.
Feda. Oh, and she also felt that room has to be made for
something, a kind of clearing out, a making room,
for something new. They'll be having—that's too
quick !
—quite a turn-out, which will be rather in-
convenient and awkward, but, she says, " I'm afraid
is unavoidable." She says she thinks something is
known about this, but she's not sure it actually has
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 197
been done. It more the idea she got, not that she
saw anything actually taking place. . . . [Note 1.]
Who said, " Might have better arrangement for hot
water " ? Will you ask if they talking about a
better arrangement for hot water ?
W. S. I. They'd better have an arrangement ?
F. No ! You haven't got it right. A better arrangement,
as if there could be an improved arrangement for
hot water, she says. . . . [Note 2.]
Dirty windows ! The windows wanted cleaning ! Isn't
it a noosance ! One particularly, more than the
others. Must have been overlooked, she says. Dora
wouldn't have dii'ty windows !
W. S. I. No.
F. She was very particular that way. [Note 3.]
The word " cupid " coming to her strongly. " Now,
she says, I think they must have that word written
very largely on something that has been discussed,
or written there, lately." She says, " I know I was
getting- somebody else's mental picture of it, so,
—
she says,—rather interested to find out if I'm right
about that." " 'Tisn't, she says, what you'd expect
to find there." . . . [Note 4.]
Notes by Miss Newton.
1. Room had to be made for the steel cupboards which
are now in the Office. It was difficult to find room for
them and for the furniture that would have to be dis-
placed, and the question occupied our minds for some little
time before the cupboards were dehvered. The bill for
them is dated July 8, 1924.
There was not only a clearing out to make room, but
also a clearing out of other places, where the documents
which were to be stored in the steel cupboards had hitherto
been kept. It was certainly " rather inconvenient and
awkward," for we had no spare time to devote to it.
2. We considered and discussed the question of better
arrangements for hot water in connection with our tenant's
lease of the upper floors in June and July, 1923, more
than a year before the sitting. Again we discussed it in
198 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
connection with the substitution of the Eagle Range for
the obsolete range in the kitchen, a month or two after
the sitting.
3. The windows were dirty, when we returned on Sep-
tember 10 after the vacation. They had not been cleaned
since July. One window was specially dirty ; this was the
upper landing window, which had never been cleaned dur-
ing the Society's tenanc)^ on account of the necessity of
using a special ladder to reach it. One day, soon after
September 10, I noticed how very dii'ty it was, and spoke
to Miss Horsell about it, and she told me the window-
cleaner was going to bring a special ladder. She had
mentioned this at the end of July to our housekeeper,
who was also concerned about the dirty window. All the
windows, including this one, were cleaned in September.
4. Mrs. Ham, the housekeeper at 31 Tavistock Square,
showed me to-day (September 29, 1924) a white china cupid
which had been given her by our tenant's housekeeper,
when leaving, some time during the first half of August.
Neither Miss Horsell, Mr. Dingwall, nor I laiew anything
about this until Mrs. Ham told me, and showed me the
Cupid, when I enquired on September 29 whether there
was such a thing m the house. _
I. Newton.
It will be noticed that in regard to some of these
incidents, those of the " new lamp," the " clearing out,"
and the arrangement for hot water, there is no close
coincidence with the date of the sitting, and the evidential
value of the iiacident is thereby diminished.

(At his previous sitting, on September 23, 1924, Mr.
Irving had conveyed to Feda a request from Miss
Newton that Feda should go to her flat and give
tests concerning things there on the first suitable
occasion. Feda agreed to do so.)

call dark. Feda isn't dark ! With a very pretty face
—just like Feda's. Wait a minute. And the face is
rather round, not a thin long face that some people
think all people belong to the East have. And she
had large eyes, and a nice small mouth—hke Feda's 1
Feda's mouth is only a quarter as big as hers [Mrs.
Leonard's]. And I got a straight nose—not long,
only just medium—but very straight one. Mr. Bill,
I saw this at Mrs. Isabel's and I Avanted her to
know it was like me. And will you ask her why
she does not put her hats away, for if she leaves
'em about like that some one might sit on them 1
She left a hat out on a chair yesterday. And,
Mr, Bill, I see that she's got some pale pinky stuff,
some soft stuff, that I think she must have got
lately. Long piece of new, pale pink. And I
thought it would look nice when properly done, but
I think she's going to make it into something.
That's what it felt like. And, Mr. BiU, you Imow I
like cats ? The one I mean wasn't a live one. I
couldn't pick it up to see if it was a stuffed one.
I won't be long, Dora. I don't know—hadn't got
a proper back to, but it was a figure of a cat, do
you see ? There was something red close to him,
and he looked like a very pretty, nice round-faced
cat, not a thin one.
Notes by Miss Newton.
1. Picture of a girl. The description corresponds, as
far as it goes, with a copy of Greuze—The Milkmaid
—which hangs by the side of the fireplace in my room.
2. Why she does not put her hats away ? I am sorry to
have to admit that I rather often neglect to put my hat
away, and that I leave it on a chair or on a couch until
the morning. This nearly always happens when I am
200 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PAET
spending the evening out, and have no time to put my
things away before I go.
(This statement is confirmed by Miss A. B. Hornibrook,
a friend of Miss Newton's.)
3. Pale pinky stuff. I had no pale pinky stuff, but I
had been, a week or ten days before the sitting, with a
friend to buy some pale pink silk, and it was essential
that it should be soft. A few days later (and just before
the sitting) this friend visited me in my flat, and I re-
member she then told me that she didn't like the pink
stuff, it Avas not as soft, as it should have been for her
purpose.
4. Picture of a cat and something red close to him. The
only red thing in my room is a small red candle on a
red match-box, which stands on the mantelpiece. Quite
close to it is a miniature painting of the head of a Peki-
nese dog, a round-faced, fat Pekinese. There is no picture,
nor figuie, of a cat in the room.
{b) Extract from, a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
Thursday, November 20, 1924.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. E. J. Dingwall.
FedA. She's speaking about Mrs. Isabel now ; Feda's Mrs.
Isabel ? Yes, Feda's Mrs. Isabel. Wait a bit !
You'll have to tell me that in another way. Mr.
Bill, Dora's been to see her too. Yes, and will you
ask her did she want some new music just lately 1
Dora couldn't quite see what it was, but she felt her
wishing for new music. [Note 1.] And what is the
good of cutting stuff up into small pieces, and
rolling it up, and joutting it away, and not using
it ? Pink ! She intended to do something with it
at the time, but she's left it and left it, and left
it, and Dora knows it is something pink. [Note 2.]
How stupid people are with keys ! And she was
saying too, " How stupid people are v^'ith keys !
How stupid they are !
" Something another person
had done about keys and, Dora sayS; Isabel was
rather cross about. Stupid arrangement, that was
the idea she got from her. . . . [Note 3.]

Notes by Miss Newton.
1. I have not wanted new music ; I cannot identify the
aUusion, unless it is an idea associated with (3).
2. This allusion at once reminded me of the numerous
small pieces of a navy bhie jumper which I had unpicked
and intended to use as a pattern for another, and in the
meantime had rolled up and put away in a drawer, where
it has remained for some time. I have come across it
two or three times lately, a long slender roU, and remem-
bered what I intended to do with it. Associated with it
in my mind, because it too reminds me of an intention
not carried out, is a small roll of 2^i'>^k lingerie material
cut out. But this is in one ]3iece, not " small " pieces.
It is true that I have "left it and left it."
3. On Monday, November 10, 1924, I forgot when leaving
the Office to turn off the electric heating switches which
had been on all day in the seance room. I remembered
them later, and as the medium, Willy Schneider, was arriving
from Vienna the same evening for an investigation by the
Society, I was afraid to risk an accident in the seance
room by leaving the switches on all night. I therefore
left my friend, M. B. C, with whom I was dining before
going to a concert of Hungarian music at 8 p.m. at the
AeoHan Hall, and returned to 31 Tavistock Square, where
I found all the doors in the haU locked, and the house-
keeper and his wife out. I could not find the keys, and
so could not get to the seance room, the intervening room
being locked. I was cross and thought it stupid to have
put the keys where they could not be found, altogether
" a stupid arrangement," and said so to M. B. C. when
I rejoined her at the Aeolian Hall.
I. Newton.
The allusion at the sitting to new music is perhaps an
instance of how an idea may be got telepathically and
misinterpreted. It will be noted that the idea of music
was closely associated in Miss Newton's mind with the
incident of the keys, for she was on her way to a concert
when this incident occurred.
202 Mrs. W. H. Salter.

[part
§6.
A simple and striking instance of the kiad of evidence
with which this chapter is concerned occurred at a sitting
taken by one of our American Members, Mrs. Edward
Wood Allison, who came over from America in the summer
of 1924 for the purpose of havmg sittings with Mrs.
Leonard, and obtained some good results. At a sitting
she had on Jime 11, 1924, either Dr. Allison or Dr. J. H.
Hyslop, who were purportmg to communicate,—it is not
very clear which—was said to have paid a visit to the
Secretary, Miss Newton, in her flat. In this connection
Feda referred to an impression of some laundry having
just been delivered, and went on :
Feda. Would you mind asking IVIrs. Isabel why she wanted
to know would the one key open two things, two
locks. This is from your gentleman [Dr. Allison].
She was a bit puzzled about a key. She kept
saying, " I wonder if this will do as well as the
lock it Avas meant for."
To this Miss Newton appends the following note :
June 11, 1924.
When J\Irs. Allison read the above note to me I was
at once reminded of the following incident. I have a
small locked hanging cupboard in my flat which, having
lost the key, I have not used for some years. For the
last two or three weeks I have had it in mind, for having
found a use for it, I decided to hang it, if I could get
a key to open it, and I have been intending to go to
a locksmith and borrow some small keys. Last Thursday
evening—or it may possibly have been Friday morning,
but I think not—I was getting ready to go aAvay for
the week-end, and putting away an attache case I had
just bought for a birthday present for a friend. I caught
sight of the key and wondered if it would fit the cupboard
lock. It did not, and I then thought of the key of my
own attache case and tried it, and then the keys, one after
the other, of four or five writing and other small cases,
wondering in each case " if this will do."
Feda said earlier in the sitting that a visit had been
!J9] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 203
made to my home—by either Dr. Hyslop or Dr. Allison—and
she referred in connection with it to the delivery of my
laundry. The delivery of the laundry takes place on
Thursday evening.
I tried the keys either on Thursday evening or Friday
morning. I think it was probably Thursday evening, for
on Friday morning my cousin called before I left for the
S.P.R. and consequently I was pressed for time.
I. Newton.
§7.
Extract from a Sitting luith Mrs. Leonard,
Tuesday, April 28, 1925.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.
Feda. Will you also notice if any one shows you some new
wood, new wood, of a rather beautiful kind ? Dora
feels some one Avill show it to you with a little
pride. Dora gets the idea that it's either new wood,
or wood that's been newly polished or painted.
Now, Mr. Bill, you may go to two places where
that will happen—one place will not be nearly so
right, so important, as the other. Now, can you
explain that bit better, Dora ? She says, " Both
places will fit, two places will both fit this test,
though in rather different ways, and—use this word
—degrees." One place is the Psychical 'Searchers.
That, she hopes, Avill be rather an interesting veri-
fication. [Note 1.]
Also with the Psychical 'Searchers, see if they're going
to have their—what done ? Grates done. Dora's
sure that something had been talked and thought
about in connection with their grates. Not their
greats people, but fire-grates. Mr. Gelly and Mr.
Piddy, and the old Lady is greats, but not fire-
grates, and I think that part of it is rather a joke.
[Note 2.]
Attempts at turnmg the place into a 'servatory !
W. S. I. I should think it is.
F. There's been some measuring going on there, Mi'. Bill,
like some one carefully saying, " How long is that ?
"
204 Mrs. W. H. Suiter. [part
This way (Feda illustrates measuring horizontally).
Like that sort of way. [Note I.]
And will you ask what it is that won't fit into the
—
" Now, Dora says, I'll have to use two words—the
recess or corner ?
" Have you got that ?
W. S. I. Yes. [Note 3.]
F. Hanging something new up on the wall ! Will you
see if something new has just, quite lately, been
hung up on the wall ? Dora's got a very strong
feeling of something, but couldn't tell if it was any-
thing important or not. She only got the thought
of the action. [Note 4.]
There's something else that she got puzzled h'er a
little. Some one has been thinking there that there
ought to be a better system of—what ? Signalling.
Yes, use this word signalling. Dora says, " It will
probably mean some one ringing the bell, or sig-
nalling in that way. Like letting one know, she
says, so please be sure to find out what it was."
Dora didn't quite understand it. [Note 5.]
Mr. Bill, there's another thing. I don't know if you
know it yet. Are you going to talk about some
new experimenting? Dora feels that you'll be drawn
into a dis-cushion.
W. S. I. Is that the latest pronunciation ?
F. That's right! Some say "discussion." It should be
" dis-cushion." A discussion about—what, Dora "?
About a new method or new idea of psychical
experiments. [Note 6.)
Azotes by Mr. Irving and various Members of the
S.P.R. Staff.
1. Next day, Wednesday, April 29, 1925, I had a sitting
with Mr. Vout Peters, and after the sitting asked him if
he had a Buddha in his house. This I had to do, because
at a Leonard sitting on September 25, 1924, I -was asked
whether I had been somewhere lately where there was a
Buddha, and the only possible place I could think of was
Mr. Vout Peters' house. '^\r. Peters took us into his front
room and shoA\ ed us three. One, very small, in a cabinet,
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 205
he pointed to, was made of wood. The wood was neither
new nor painted. No wood was shown me at the S.P.R.
Rooms, and at another Leonard sitting on Thursday, April
30, 1925, the subject was returned to, as follows :
Feda. There's something that you thought you were going
to find, that she told you of at the sitting with
Feda the other day which you haven't found yet.
May not get through till to-morrow. Have you got
that down, Mr. Bill, for it's rather important ?
Something she expected you to find out yesterday,
and it hasn't been your fault, and it isn't Dora's
fault, but circumstances have prevented you tracing
it. . . . Dora keeps saying, " To-morrow, to-morrow."
She feels you're going to verify something to-morrow.
Note Continued.
Again the test failed ! Though I was at the S.P.R.
Rooms for some time on Friday morning I -was not shown
any wood. On Saturday, therefore, before returning home,
I read this to Miss Newton. She tells me that she has
been showing a new polished bookcase to people lately.
It looks therefore as though an attempt to impress Miss
Newton to show it to me failed—perhaps because the notes
of sittings we had to go through I'equired concentrated
attention and there was little time afterwards to talk about
anything else.
W. S. Irving.
The new sections of bookcases were delivered and put
in place in the Library on April 15, 1925. They are
highly polished, and do not match in shade the old
sections. The man who took the order said that was
unavoidable, on account of the newness of the wood in
the sections to be added.
The addition of the six large new sections and the
re-arrangement of the old ones were the outcome of much
thought, measuring and planning with the object of
acquiring extra book-space and at the same time of
removing the defect of hitherto uneven lines of shelves.
This object accomplished, we felt a " little pride " in

2. In the autumn of 1924 tlie excessive consumption of
coal in the kitchen during the year began to cause us
anxiety, and in November the question of remedying it
was much in our minds. On December 5 the House and
Finance Committee examined estimates both for the re-
pairing of the old range and for the substitution of a
small modern economy-range, and after fully discussing the
question, they decided on the latter. The arrangements
for this were then the subject of discussion between us
and both the builders and the Bedford Estate, where
objections were raised. Finally differences were adjusted
and the grate was put in early in February, 1925.

3. The re-arrangement in the Library left over a stack
of sections which were required for the accommodation of
books recently added to the Loan Library. The only
available room for it was the recess in the N.W. corner,
where two large pictures of psychical interest were hanging.
When the stack was in position, it was found that there
was not enough space between it and the corner for the
picture that had been hanging there. ^ ^-r

6. On the Friday of this week, May 1, 1925, Dr. Woolley
kindly invited me to take part in a sitting for physical
phenomena that evening, which I did. I knew nothing at
the time of the Leonard sitting of these new experiments.
W. S. Irving.
With regard to the question of what normal knowledge
]\'Irs. Leonard might have concerning recent events occur-
ring at the Society's rooms, it is to be observed that she
has never visited these rooms since the removal of the
Society to 31 Tavistock Square. She did on two or three
occasions visit the Society's former rooms iii Hanover
Square for the purpose of giving sittings there. In one
or two cases it is possible, though not, I think, very
probable, that she may have derived some information
from chance remarks made by sitters who were Members
of the Society and had been lately to the rooms. But in
several cases Imowledge of the events to which reference
seems to be made could only have been obtained—by
normal means—from the Officers of the Society, and this
explanation we may reasonably dismiss.
CHAPTER II.
Book-Tests.
Readers of Proceedings will be familiar with that par-
ticular type of evidence, obtained through Mrs. Leonard's
mediumship, to which the name of " book-test " has been
given, for a report on the subject by ]Mrs. Sidgwick was
published in Volume XXXI. pp. 241 ff. The book-tests
there dealt with, are described by Mrs. Sidgwick as "attempts
by IVIrs. Leonard's control to indicate the contents of a
particular page of a particular book which j\Irs. Leonard
has not seen with her bodily eyes and which is not,
208 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
at the time of the .sittuig, kiiowji to the sitter." I
do not propose to enter into any general discussion of
l)ook-tests here, since this ground has already been
covered hy Mrs. Sidgwick. I need only say that, broadly
speaking, I think Mr. Irving's results in this field may
be considered fairly typical. I have not fomid in Mr.
Irving's records any instances of success as striking as
the very best of those recorded by Mrs. Sidgwick ; on the
other hand the average of his results is good, quite up to
the average of other successful sitters. In this particular
kind of evidence, as Mrs. Sidgwick found, sitters, or per-
haps we should say communicators, differ greatly in the
degree of success they attain. An interesting point in Mr.
Irving's tests is that in an unusual number of instances
the books to which reference was made were situated in
rooms which were almost, if not quite, unknown to Mr.
Irving, and with which he had no close link of any kind.
To succeed in these circumstances is asserted by communi-
cators to be more difficult. To what extent this assertion
is justified we cannot say without knowing more than we
do at present as to the modus operandi, but it is certainly
the case that successfid instances of this particular type of
book-test are rare. I have included three such instances
(see below, pp. 209, 216, 239). Of these three the
second is better than the first, and the third is the best
of all. This last case contains one of the few instances I
have observed in Mr. Irving's records in which a correct
statement was made to the effect that a particular word
would be found on a particular page. A few similar cases
are discussed by Mrs. Sidgwick in her report, pj). 270-289.
It is unfortunate that there are not more of such cases on
record, since they are free from the defect so often observ-
able in book-tests that the indications given in regard to
the matter to be found in the place nadicated are too
vague and leave too much scope to individual interpre-
tation. In the particular case recorded here the evidence
is slightly marred by some doubt as to the way in which
the pages of the book are to be counted—another difficulty
which is only too frequent in book-tests—but when due
allowance has been made for this defect the case still seems
99] Siftings ivilli Mrs. Leonard. 209
to me to afi'ord good evidence for knowledge supernor-
mally acquired.
The first attempt at a book-test whicli occurred at Mr.
Irving's sittings will be found recorded in the S.P.R.
Journal, Vol. XX., pp. 153 ft". I will now give the various
examples I have selected from Mr. Irving's later records.
§1. "Telepathy."
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, June 8, 1921.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr. G. E. Wright.
Feda. Now then, there's something more. This is something
lilve a book test too, from a different place. It's
where Mr. Charley [Colonel Baddeley] stays in
London. It's like a kind of flat and she says she
doesn't think you go up any stairs to it. You
know where she means now ?
W. S. I. Yes, I do.
F. You know the room he sits in ? It's rather a com-
fortable room. Well, do you remember some books
on shelves near the fire ? She says there's one slielf
(Feda holds her hand about 4 feet 6 inches from the
ground). Count from the left on that shelf and take
the fourth book. Page 71, 71. You're sure it's not
17 ? No, 71. About half way down a reference
—
wait a minute—a reference to something Dora was
very fond of on the earth ; and then she uses a
funny word, she says peculiarly fond of. But, turn-
ing over that page on to the next one, a great
feeling of happiness comes from the words at the
top of the next page, and she felt so much that
she would have liked to repeat them to you, could
she materialise and speak herself. You would un-
derstand that it's just what she would like to say.
She says, " Now just before that message on page
71 she didn't get such a happy feeling from the
book. She got a feeling of sorrow, anxiety, some-
thing made her feel depressed ; and she says that's
all about the actual book, but she had a feeling
that Mr. Charley intended buying something new
210 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
wliicli lic'cl j)ut iK'ar tliowe books, he'd been tliinking
of it."
Some one belonging to him took her there. She says,
" You know I only did it for a test."
W. S. I, Yes.
V. Because she thought it would be a specially good thing
being in his room. She says, " It couldn't be tele-
pathy from you then."
Noie by Mr. Irving.
On Thursday, June 9, I went to Colonel Baddelej^'s flat
to see if 1 coidd verify this book-test. I had not seen
Colonel Baddeley for two months, and do not think I had
. been in his dining-room for nearly five. The flat is on
the ground floor. Colonel Baddeley and I verified the test
together. The book shelves are in the dining-room, the
tojo shelf being about 4 feet 6 inches from the ground. The
books were placed in the shelves in piles horizontally.
Taking the count from the left, the question arose whether
the fourth book should be the fourth from the top or
bottom of the shelf. I decided on the top, before opening
any book. The fourth from the top was Telepathy, by
W. W. Baggally. The reference on p. 71 was to a de-
scription of an exhibition given to Mr. Baggally by the
Zancigs. The communicator in life was intensely fond of
all entertainments of this sort. There was a reason why
she should be, which I have told to the Secretary of the
S.P.R., but caimot make public.
Turning over the page and commencing in the middle of
the third line from tlie top of page 72 I found the words
" the fact that there is a method of communicating."
Turning back again, and two thirds down page 70, the
greater part of which page is taken up with a letter, I
found " the contents of the above letter were of a dis-
couraging nature."
Colonel Baddeley had been intending to buy a new book
which had been recommended to him, but had not done
so. It was stated at the sitting that the communicator
thought it would be specially good that the book chosen
for the test should be from Colonel Baddeley 's room, as
^9] Sittings loitli Mrs. Leonard. '
211
showing tJiat it was not telepathy from mc. It i.s in
striking accord Avith tlic characteristic humour of tlie
communicator that the book selected should be Telepathy.
With regard to the communicator's reference to some-
thing she was " peculiarly fond of," both Miss Newton and
I have been informed of Mr. Irving's reason for thinking
that the passage apparently indicated is appropriate, and
we think that he is justified in his opinion.
It should be stated that Mrs. Leonard had never visited
Colonel Baddeley at his flat.
§2. A Book About Birds.
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 24, 1922.
Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley.
Feda. Book about birds, birds. Book about birds, book
about bkds. I d6n't think that's the sort of book
he would have, Mrs. Dora ? She's talking about a
book about birds, seems all about bkds. Seems to
be a book you've got now, Mr. BiU. I don't know
if you'll remember Dora rather fond of birds ?
W. s. I. Yes.
F. Not about one particular breed of burd, but all kinds
of bu-ds, and I got a feeling of pictures of birds
too, not only just readings. I think she been re-
minded of this book lately. Not a new book, Mr.
Bill, feel to Feda as if a good many years old.
Get a strong feehng with it that—first that had to
do with all English birds—she gives me the feehng
of bu-ds belonging to a place a long long way away.
Rather a south place, south and warm, southern,
southern. Just near the beginning, I think there's
a name rather 'portant beginning with F. I keep
getting the figure 16. Letter F, and then 16. I
don't hke to say it tiU she tells me, but I wonder
if it's anything to do with page 16, as she keeps
making a movement of turning over. AU to do
with the bird book. About page 16 whatever this
is is at lower part of book, at bottom. Get these
words '•
brown spots, brown spots." I'm just giving
212 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
it as she says it, 'cos it's best. Got to what ?
Got to have some alterations done ? She's jumped
away from the bird book now—pity because it's a
nice book. It's a particular book rather, that is,
Mr. Bill. Not like a book she thinks you wouldn't
know. She going back to it now. Usually wher
she gives it, she doesn't know, she says first book,
second shelf, like that. Something in the bird book
—dunno what it's for—somebody's written inside it.
Got a feeling—I can't see it, but she pretends to
write something inside it. She just Avent like that.
Note by Mr. Irving.
I at once recognised this book from Feda's description,
as being a copy of John's British Birds in their Haunts.
It deals mainly with British birds, but includes also rare
visitors to this country. The book is copiously illustrated
with pictures of birds. 1 have had the book for nearly
35 years, as it one of several given to me when a
boy as a school prize. I seldom have reason to refer to
this book, but recently had occasion to in connection
with the tests for chance-coincidence in book-tests Avhich
you [Mrs. Salter] sent me. (See 8.P.R. Proceedings, Vol.
XXXIII. p. 606). This was one of the ten books from
which my " chance " tests were taken. Four days after the
above sitting I returned home and tried to verify the test.
The book was on the shelves in my drawing-room. It has
626 pages without counting a long preface. I had no con-
scious knowledge of the contents of any particular page.
On page 16 I found nothing particularly appropriate to
the test, so examined page 15, which is at the back of
page 16, as in a former book-test of mine I had found
confusion between the front and back of a page. More
than half of page 15 is taken up by a picture of The
Peregrine Falcon. This picture is 3 inches long, and the
breast of the bird appears to be heavily spotted. ITnrler-
neath the picture are the words in large letters :
THE PEREGRINE FALCON.
FALCO PEREGRIN US.
There follow eleven lines of description. Line 5 has the
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 213
words " Ui)pei" plumage tinged with bruwii." Lines G and
7,
" Eggs dull light red, spotted and blotched with deep
red." These last words are only | of an inch from the
bottom of the reading material on this page. The book
can well be described as a " nice " '"
particular " book.
It is a valuable copy, bound in morocco and gold, with
the crest of Bedford School in gold on the cover. On the
inside of the cover is Avritten my name, and also " Class
Prize. Form III. 2. Midsummer, 1887.''
Since the apparently relevant matter was found on page
15, not on page 16, it is worth noting that on this occa-
sion the communicator does not seem to have been as
explicit as usual in the matter of the ^^.ge reference.
Finally the reference is given by Feda as " about page
16,
"'
which seems to indicate some consciousness of doubt.
With reference to Feda's words about " birds belonging
to ... a south place," Mr. Irving sent me a quotation
from the Preface to the book, as follows :
The pecuhar geographical position of the British Isles
renders them the resort, either permanent or temjjorary, of
a large number of Birds : amongst which are many periodical
visitors, both from high latitudes, driven southwards in winter
by the severity of the cold ; and from Africa, whence they
fly northwards at the opposite season, in order to avoid
the intense heat of an intertropical summer.
§ 3. " Burning Fires."
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, September 22, 1922.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley.
Feda. It's a book-test first she's giving. Now wait. Mi\
Bill, are you ready ? Do you know what she calls
the shelves you've got with some books on them,
rather low ?
W. S. I. Not for the moment.
F. You must get the place right, you see. It is where
you hve, Mr. Bill, like in your own place. Some
people have to reach u^) high for books—these not.
She says shelves, shelves, not one shelf under a
214 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
cupboard. They feel to be fairly broad. She says
the second shelf up counting fiom the bottom, 5
from the right, 5, 5, Avait a minute, that's not right
!
She wants to make a remark hei'e. In that room
it would be more natural for you to walk round
and count from the right, but she hasn't done.
She's gone to left, Mr. Bill. Couldn't help feehng
that, the arrangement of room, furniture, etc.
Note by Mr. Irving.
The room is my drawing-room, and a round table nearly
3 feet in Avidth is in front of the book-shelves. It is easy
to get to the books on the right, but not to those on the
left without moving the table.
There followed an attempt to refer to the contents of a
book described as " the fifth from the left " in the shelf
mentioned above. Mr. Irvmg could find nothing appro-
priate in this book, though he found what he thought
were appropriate passages in the fourth book from the
left. This part of the test, however, I do not give in
detail. A second test from another book in the same
shelf was given as follows :
Feda. Going along to the end of that shelf, right-hand side,
felt a book, the end or end but one, reminded her
of Asia. A good deal to do Avith the East in it.
She wants you to open that book, do you see, and
she Avants you to open it at page 107, and look
about half-Avay to three-quarter Avay down the page,
and you'll see something about fires burning, burning
fires. [Note 1.]
At the very beginning of that book, she means right,
right, right at the beginning some Avonderful Avords
that should exactly apply to you and to your
present conditions ; in fact they are a clear indi-
cation of the line you should take, of the way you
should think of things at present. [Note 2.]
Is there a little table, a very small table, close to
these books ?
W. S. I. Fairly small, in fact two tables.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 215
Yes, she says, the rather bigger one, she thinks., a
little nearer the books. One has got—oh dear, oh
dear ! isn't it a noosance !
—one has got a piece
coming undone from underneath his top. Think
it's top of his leg.
W. S. I. I didn't know.
F. She's telling you. It's coming undone. She kno^^'s
you won't mind when you find she's told you about
it. [Note 3.]
Notes by Mr. Irving.
1. The end book on the right was Old Tef<tament Portraits,
by Cunningham Geikie. The book is almost entirely con-
nected with Asia. It is a series of biographies of Old
Testament heroes, most of them living in the Holy Land,
but the later ones in Babjdon and the Persian Empire,
etc. I have never read this book.
The book is a large one, each page ^ inches in length.
On page 107 and 5| inches down the page are the words
"Mount Sinai." No student of the Bible could fail to
think of burning tire in connection Avith this mountain.
I quote the following from the BooJi of Exodus :
" And
Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord
descended upon it in fire. . . . And the sight of the glory of
the Lord was like devouring iire on the top of the mount."
2. In consequence of the emphasis laid upon this part
of the test being right at the beginning of the book, I
searched the fly-leaves. The first was blank, the second
had the title only of the book, the third had the adver-
tisement of three books by the same author in large type
with short criticisms below. The third of them was as
follows :
Light from Beyond.
To cheer the Christian Pilgrim.
3. The larger table is right in front of the shelves, only
about a foot away. The smaller table is ^ feet to the
right. I find that two of the supports are rather loose
near the top of the legs, but this is too trivial a matter
to be noticed. I think there has been an attempt here
to refer to an incident many years old. This table is of
216 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
imitation marquetry, and was painted and polished by my
wife. The top of the table was broken in two during a
removal, and had to be clamped together under the top
to be rendered serviceable.
§ 4. The Book Shop.
Further Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
September 22, 1922.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Colonel C. E. Baddeley.
Feda. J3o you know—however will he find that out, Dora ?
However am I going to explain that to him ? Oh
dear ! dear ! I don't know ! Mr. Bill, I don't know
how you're going to do this. You know where you
live ? Well, she's taking me rather away from
where you live to a street she's often been to with
you, and that you often go doAvn now, do you see ?
You go—you're in a street like that (indicates
straight forward), and j^ou come into what you call
a main road. You turn round that way [to the
right] and you get to some shops, and one of the
shops on that side (Feda \\aves her hand to the
right) seems to sell rather a mixed-up kind of lot
of things. I dunno what it is I see, but I see in
the window like packets about that big [about six
inches] with little pictures on in front.
W. S. I. How broad ?
F. Not more than three to four inches broad, Mr. Bill,
and in the corner of the window there's some sticks
—not standing up straight, but leaning against some-
thing. It looked to her like a glass dish too in the
window, with some little round things in it too,
small. Several things with pictures on too in the
window, do you see ? When you go in through the
door of the shop, it's not a very long counter,
rather short. The other side of the shop there's
some book- shelves and Dora noticed that the top
shelf was hardly ever touched, or put out of place
—supposed it Asas too luuch trouble—so she ran
down to-day and took a book-test. Top shelf—
•
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 217
rather high up. The book she took was third book
from the left, and she opened it at page 33, and
there was such a nice message on that page, on the
lower part, a nice message from her to you ; and
the message seemed to speak of proving love—not
only loving, but proving love. Turning that page
over—stood upon something—she made it as simple
as she could—turning that one page over she got a
feeJing it spoke of rich and richer conditions, gaining
money, do you see 1 'Fraid that didn't apply to
you, Mr. Bill, she say, but she thought it would
interest j^ou. . . . She says she felt sure these
books are hardly ever touched. Mr. Bill, she's been
there with you. Do you Imow—is there a woman
connected with that shop looks about middle-aged ?
She try to identify it.
W. S. I. Is it a Library ?
F. Tisn"t a big Library. It's a shop that sells other
things, but they lend books out too. The Library's
only a small part of it, do you see ? A very small
23art too. About this ^^'oman—Dora kept sensing
the woman looking about that age and suffering
from bad health. Not see her, felt her.
W. S. I. Which side of the road is the shop ?
F. As you stand in front of the shop and look up that
way—I can draw it, ]\Ir. Bill.
W. S. I. Oh, good. (Feda draws as below :)
[Drawn from here hy Feda. W.S.I.]^
F. As you stand by the shop, buildings not quite flat
—
one sticks out more than in. If you look at him
^ This is not a tracing of Feda's drawing, hut is a sufficiently exact
reproduction of it. The dot is intended by Feda to represent tlie position

218 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
now she thinks you'll see where he is. Mr. Bill,
she says she did get part of the position wrong at
first ; she's made it right by what she done with
Feda. Is there a meat place near it ?
W. S. I. Rather.
F. You would pass a meat place going to it.
W. S. I. Yes.
F. Don't like meat places, nasty places. There's a board
up with a B name on it—not stand tor butchers
what makes meat, it's a name. The more she can
give about it—but higher up than this shop isn't
part of a place being taken down 1 Part of his front
being taken down, do you see ? Noosance ! Like
taken off—like his face, 'tis a noosance ! Mr. Bill,
the street isn't quite even there, it goes a bit
narrower. Wait a minute. What is it ? Dora says
remember about it. Is it an arch ? Is there an
archway close there ? I get the feeling of an arch-
way close there, Mr. Bill.
W. S. I. Right.
F. Feel as if I turn off there like that, you can go down
to a stream—running water. There's like a very
narrow place near to that shop, Mr. Bill. Is there
something to do with horses in the window ? Dora
sensed something, looking in window, to do with
horses. You might look and see. She's 'fraid she's
giving you a lot of trouble Avith tests to-day, but
the test is mackintoshes and umbrellas, test is.
W. S. I. Is what ?
F. Means that. No, she says " water-tight." The more
water-tight, the more difficult it must necessarily
be to verifv. That is right.
Note by Mr. Irving.
At the time of the sitting I had been away from home
for 18 days in London and Yorkshire. The shop described
is in the little town of Newent, about one mile from my
Vicarage. The description of tlie road to the sho]:) is
fairly accurate ; about half-way down to the shop the
road turns to the right, as described, at a point where
Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 219
another road joins it from the left, almost at right angles,
but it is not so much a main road as the road on which
T live. I did not recognise the shop until Feda described
the interior with the book-shelves, because the shop is on
the left-hand side as you go from OxenhaJl to Newent.
Feda indicated the right. This may, however, not have
been a mistake, as I first supposed ; it may liave been
due to the method by which the test was given. If
pictures of various points eyi route were flashed up by the
communicator and the last was given from a point opposite
the shop but a little to the left, the position would be
correct. This is the jjoint from which Feda's drawing was
made. There is no doubt whatever as to the shop in-
tended. It is the only book-shop in Newent, and is as
described by Feda. " 'Tisn't a big Library. It's a shop
that sells other things, but they lend books out too." On
Monday, Sept. 25, I Avent into Newent to verify the test.
The shop has two windows, one on the right as you enter
which I will call -window A, the other on the left in an
annex, window B. I believe there is a small third
window also, but that does not concern the test. Beyond
the fact that there was probably stationery and ornaments
in the window I had no idea of the contents. They are
not as a rule interesting in small local shops. In window
A there were three or four boxes of about the size men-
tioned, some of cardboard, some of wood with coloured
pictures and coloured letters on the outside. In the corner
of the window about half a dozen lead pencils tied together
standing upright. Also many picture postcards, china vases
and small round articles of china. In window B one or
two boxes with pictures on, rather narrower than described,
two toy horses and carts fairly large, a hunting-crop and
two Avhips, and three large cardboard boxes in a prominent
position filled with round balls, some large, some small,
some coloured and some plain. I noticed next day that
there was a bundle of broomsticks standing outside the
window of the next shop, leaning against the corner.
On entering the shop the counter is on the right and is
rather short. On the left, opposite the counter, were
shelves full of new books—not part of the LibrarA'. The
220 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
top shelf was, I should think, about OJ feet in height.
I bought the third book from the left on the to]) shelf.
It proved to be Roland Yorke, by Mrs. Henry Wood.
The lower part of page 33 is about a man who has just
heard of the premature death of a favourite nephew, but
who does not go to the funeral mainly because he does
not wish to leave his wife who is ill. Commencing rather
more than half-way down the page the text is as follows ;
Mrs. Greatorex had fallen into ill-health for some
time past now ; in fact she was slowly dying of an in-
curable complaint. But for not liking to leave her,
Mr. Greatorex might have hastened down as soon as
the sad news reached him of his nephew's premature
end. I say he '"
might," but Mr. Greatorex was him-
self only recovering from an attack of illness, and was
scarcely strong enough to travel. And so he ivaited
at home unih all the j^a^iejice he could call up, under-
standing nothing but that his nephew John, Avho had
been as dear to him as were his own children, was
dead,
I am suggesting that the " proving love " as a nice
message from my wife to me is contained in the sentence
about " waiting at home with all the patience he could
call up." It is in accordance with messages I have been
getting from my wife through Feda and Belle [Mrs.
Brittain's control] to the effect that she is doing so.
Turning over the page, I found on page 34 as follows—
I
commence at line 14 :
It was a very large house : it had been two
originally. In the old old days some thirty or more
years ago, Mr. Greatorex had rented only one of the
houses. As his family and his business increased, he
bought the one he occupied and the next adjoining
and made them into one.
There is a middle-aged woman connected with the shop.
I don't know about her health—she's not a robust person.
The details of the surroundings seem fairly accurate. I
enclose Feda's drawings [see above] and one of mine for
comparison. I have to pass three meat shops between
99] SiUing.'i with Mrs. Leonard. 221
Oxenliall and this shop. A board over the shop has W.
H. Bendle on it. Higher up the street I noticed a ladder
and found tJiat a workman had just finished colour-washing
in yellow the outside of a house, and was beginning to
paint. The street goes narrower where the shop is and
also higher up. There is the " archway to the George
Hotel " about 50 yards from Bendle's, on the other side
of the road ; and about another 50 yards further on, but
on the shop side, a footpath goes through Newent Church-
yard and down a narrow lane over a small stream of
running water. I was not sure of this, as I hardly ever
use this path, but have been to see.
To this note were appended the two following confir-
matory statements :
On September 25 I inspected the two windows of Mr.
Bendle's shop. The contents of the windows were as
stated by Mr. Irving. t~. ^^

Sept. 25, 1922, was Roland Yorlce. The books are oppo-

with Feda's sketch.
§5. " The Sum Total OF Life."
On January 24, 1923, Mr. Irving liad a sitting with
Mrs. Brittain, at which there was an attempt at a book-
test. Nothing at all definite was given in regard to the
contents of the book, but a short passage from the record
of this sitting is worth rpioting lun-e.

W. S. I. I wonder if Belle's gone.
Belle. I've come back. She says, " It isTi't in the bookcase,
it's on your desk." I should say they've been
moving something while you've been away. She
says, " It's on your desk, and you'll be so glad."
Note by Mr. Irvirtg.
The interest of this is that on the next day I had a
liConard sitting, when a book-test Avas given through Feda
from the place indicated on my desk. The message was
api^licable to me. . . . Feda has never before taken a
test from the books on my desk, though Belle has once
before tried to.

Feda. This is at home. It doesn't look to Feda like a
bedroom, but it's a room with a table in the middle,
a room more like a sitting-room you sits in. As
you sitting at table, you sits almost facing the
books that she means. That's how you sit there
sometimes, do you see ? Now, she says, do you
think you recognise the place ?
W. S. I. One of two.
F. This isn't just one shelf or one table with books on.
W. S. I. There are two lots of books there.
F. One lot is about that height (Feda indicates about
4 feet).
W. S. I. Isn't it a little higher ?
F. She says, " I was just going to say not lower—it
might be a little higher." And, do you know, but
have you been knocking some nails in, or altering
something there ?
1 Mrs. Brittain'fi iisun.1 ' oontrol.'
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 223
w. s. I. No.
F. Boras got a strong feeling of suuietliing that -would
suggest that, suggest it, she thinks you'll understand
that. As you look down, do j^ou look on sometliing
white 1
W. S. 1. Yes.
F. That what I see—^^vhite. And the light from the
^\'indoA\- comes in a little sideways—not right on to
the books, do you see ? Looking at the floor just
there something seems to want mending. Dora's
pretending to look do-wm\'ards, wants renewing,
mending there, particularly just there, which you
will see when you look. Now, ]\Ir. Bill, you un-
derstand the books about that height ? Take first
book you touch (Feda ^^-aves her hand slightly to
the left).
W. S. 1, Left ?
F. Take it all and open it at page 41. On the upper
part it speaks of removing, removing and change.
It reminded her very much of circumstances con-
nected with you and her a long time ago, when
she was on the earth. '"And turning over to page
50, near the top of 50, there seemed words which
imphed that we were not sufficiently long enough
time together," She says, " Words there imply, and
it was true." Lower down same page, she says,
"You know the old saying 'And they lived happily
ever after,' well—they're not quite those words, but
something that mean the same thing," and Dora
wants you to think of it as a prediction of your
future together. . . . Dora says, "The whole thing,
the sum total of our lives, is incorporated in those
pages of this book. Just on those particular places
on the pages." You got that ?
W. S. I. Yes.
F. She's got such a strong feeling something's coming
loose close to these books. She feel you want to
fix something up better. It's close there.
W. S. I. Not the pile of books on the top ?
F. No.
224 Mrs. W. JJ. Salter. [part
Note hij iMr. Irrimj.
The room described is niy dining-room. To the right,
front of where I usually sit is my A\riting-desk with a
row of books along the top. To the left front is the
sideboard, but there are only two or three books and
papers on that. The desk is clearly indicated ;
it stands
at an angle between the window and a French window,
so that the light does not fall directly on the books. On
Friday, Jan. 26, being still in town, I read this test to
Miss Newton and remarked that the book from which the
test was taken must be one of two, Kelly's Clerical Direc-
tory, or Mortimer's Helps to Meditation. I had referred to
both books shortly before leaving home ;
and, so far as
I could remember, both had occupied the pMce of end book
at the left-hand side recently. I did not know which I
had left there. On verifying the test, I found that the
end book was Kelly s Clerical Directory, nearly 2000 pages.
On page 41, near the top, middle and bottom, it is all
" removal and change," for it is a hst of Curacies and
Incumbencies, held by various Clergy. The same, however,
^^ould apply to half the other pages ; and there is nothing
corresponding to the script on page 50. I then tried the
next book, Mortimer's Helps to Meditation, Vol. II., with
the following results : Page 41 ,
commencing in the 4th
line,
" The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself, first the
blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he
putteth in the sickle, because the Harvest is come." On
page 50, Zl inches from the top of a page 8| inches in
depth, I found :
" Sin, as a necessary result, caused the
death of the body by introducing that seed of decay which
resulted from the Fall." Lower down the same page,
about an inch more than half-way down: "The life of the
Soul is its Union with God, in which it finds at once the
attainment of its perfection, and the consummation of all
its desires."
With regard to the details mentioned in the room, I
had not been knocking in any nails, but the French
window had been sticking, warped by the damp, and it
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 225
had to be hammered at every time it was opened. It is
]Dainted white, and is just opposite where I sit at table.
A mat against the window is, I see, wearing badly. I
have found nothing coming loose close to the books, but
the back of the sideboard, nearly three yards away,
wants securing tighter. My question as to the height of
the books was put because I kncAv there were a lot of
books on the sofa in the window, but these are only
\h feet above the ground. I have only Vol. II. of
Mortimer's work.
It is unfortunate in this case that there seems to have
been some confusion between the first and second books in
the row on the desk. However, as Mr. Irving "s note shows,
this confusion may have been due to the recent moving
of the books and not to a mistake on the part of the
communicator or Feda. Of the three main points in the
test the second and third are the best ; for the statements
made as to the passages indicated are fairly definite and
the passages quoted by Mr. Irving correspond to these
statements ;
they are the kind of thing we might expect
from the clues given. As to the first point, although the
words " change and removal " cannot be said to be in-
applicable to the Biblical passage about the harvest, yet
these words are not quite what the passage would seem
naturally to suggest. A slight straining is required to
make the answer fit the riddle. I mention this weakness
because it is one that is often found in book-tests. It is
characteristic of what—if we are to make a rough classi-
fication—we may call second-class as distinct from first-
class tests.

Feda. There's another place she's going to in yoiir house,
but this is more than one shelf—more books all
close together. Feda going in a room, as if books

you call it—pretty near to side of them feels some-
thing like a roll—standing upright, not lying down

VV. S. 1, Draw it. (Sitter hands writing-pad to Feda who

or cylinder standing upright.)
F. That's him ! He shaped just like that. Feda call
him a roll 'cos he shape like a roll, but might look
like that, something rolled up in that form just like
what she's drawcd ; and a piece of furniture, some-
thing curved down [or back],^ (Feda draws in the
air something suggesting the curved back of a chair)
not straight back. The walls are either very pale
colour, or white. I seem to get all white. I
thought at first j^ale grey, now white. She told

VV. S. I. I know where this is.

that. You know Mr. Charley ? [Colonel Baddeley].
It fits him. It's to do with him. But, she says,

you about. As well as being a reference to him,
something that fits him personally, it Mill remind
you of important conversations, rather jDarticular

Perlin, Pearliness. Don't think I've got it quite
right, Dora. There's a name, she thinks it's a
name. Yes, I'm sure it's a name—a peculiar name,
sounding like Pulliness, PuUiness, Palliness. [Also
recorded as Palisen, Perlisen.] She didn't get it
from the page 48, she got this from the beginning
of the book, and the word head, head, close to it.

ing things, things that grow :
" J^xtending growtli,"
she says, "was impressed on me so strongly."' A
little to the right of the test-book was a book that
seemed to her to have a good deal of poetry in.
You're not showing me proj^er poetry ! That's not
proper poetry, no ! There's something a little bit
different about this poetry to ordinary poetry. It
is not good ICnglish poetry that rhymes. Not " Mary
had a lamb."
S. 1 That doesn't rhyme !
"Three bags full, Have you any wool?" That rhymes!
This doesn't. Short lines, and longer lines. She
nod her head when I say it didn't rhyme. Slie
says, " Quite right." It's poetry that there would
be a good deal of difference of opinion about.
Thirteen, but on page 13 there is quite a—what ?
Quite a good description in a few A^'ords of your life
with her before she passed over, and what it meant,
and what it still means, she says. The way you
still look at it, and the way she still looks at it.

This is my drawing-room. The books are, as described,
in shelves, to the left front as you enter the room. On
a chair about six feet to the right of the book-shelves,
lay a large roll of paper 19 inches long by 4 inches in
diameter. This roll I knew to be there, and to be, as I
found it, lying on its side, not standing up as described
Ijy Feda. The back of the chair is something like the
description. The walls are white and gold, the ground-
work white with vertical gold lines—the latter somewhat
faded. The 5th book from the left, 3rd shelf up, was
Day Hours of the Ch'iirch. Following the custom my com-
municator generallj' adopts of omitting the pages of
Introduction in Roman numerals, I examined page 48 of
the book itself. It is in double columns. Line 14, left-
hand column, in a page of 49 lines, is "I shall not die,
but live." The communicator s^joke in this sitting of
having seen Colonel Baddeley [who had died in the pre-
228 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
vi(ju,s Apiil]. I liavc luul Jiuuiy coiivcusiitiuns vvitli him
about life after deatli.
Page 1 of the book j^roper is largely taken up by a
picture representing; I think, the Judgement. At the
bottom of the picture, among man}'' other figures, an angel
is pulling up people out of a ]"iit. In one person only the
head is visible ; in two head and neck. There are short
lines of print at the side. . . . Within a span of the
test-book on the shelf below is Flowers of the Field, by
Johns. Title outside. The next book but one to the
test-book is Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare. The book is
not poetry, but on a few pages—including the test page
—
the Shakespearean text is quoted. Page 13 contains a
verse from Ariel's song from The Tempest. On this
page, 13, I found the words, " Nothing now remained to
complete his happiness." Tliis point I consider definite
and accurate.
To this note is appended a confirmatory statement as
follows :
I certifj^ that I met the Rev. W. S. Irving on his
return from London on August 11, 1923, and further
accompanied him to his house.
The books Day Honrs of the Church, Lamb's Tales from
Shahesj)eare, and Johns' Flowers of the Field, were found
as stated by Mr. Irving. The references to the respective
pages in the books are as described by him.

On receiving Mr. Irving 's record of the above sitting I
wrote to him saying that it seemed to me an odd coin-
cidence that Feda should quote the line " Mary had a
lamb," apparently apropos of Lamb's Tales from Shake-
speare, and I thought there might have beeir some attempt
to refer to the title of the book. Mr. Irving replied as
follows :
Oct. 17, 1923.
It is indeed a curious coincidence—if it is a coincidence
—that " Mary had a lamb " should lie quoted by Feda in
99] Sittings ivitli Mrs. Leonard. 229
cuuuL'clion Mitli ljanil)"« Tales froiii S/niLxviiairc. It is,
however, weakened somewliat by tlie fact tliat Feda has,
I know, once before quoted to me " Mary had a lamb "
in comiection with poetry. On the other hand, since
sending in the script. I have examined the book again,
and find that on the cover it says, " By Charles and Mary
Lamb." The word " Lamb " is practically obliterated by
wear and tear. My attention was drawn to the coinci-
dence by Mr. Dingwall as well as by yourself. I had
missed the point. I wonder if the book was chosen
deliberately by the communicator knowing that Mary had
a lamb " was in Feda's mind, and thinking therefore that
it would be easy to get the title through ? . . .
W. S. Irving.
It is perhaps worth noting that although most of the
passages quoted in Lamb's Tales are in blank verse, and
therefore unrhymed, the particular passage which appears
on p. 13, a verse from Ariel's song, is rhymed. This fact
seems to have escaped the communicator's notice. Prob-
ably the intention was merely to indicate in a general
way the nature of the verse with which the book was
concerned.
§ 7. Cowper's Poems.
Extract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Leonard, November 22, 1923.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Savy.
Feda. Now, Mr. Bill, she's got another book-test from
home. . . . She's going to a place she's taken
books from before at home, not a bedroom, but a
room you sit in, like this kind of room. Only, Mr.
Bill, it's much lighter-looldng room altogether.
Mr. Bill, I think it's because the walls is lighter
than these ; and do you know the book shelves ?
As you come in door, just go 'cross, and they're
there. (Feda points straight ahead.) You can walk
straight to 'em. You know the shelf you would
call the lowest ? Well, she's taking that one, and
she's taking the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th, the 5th book from
230 Mrs. W. II. Salter. [part
tln'. Jt'ft, |iage (iS, ])agc (iS, near the tuji. Uli, what
a funny thing ! JieftTs tu Jiute-takcis ! On the
lower part of the same i)age describes what she feels
like—what Dora feels like—when you find something
that's really evidential after a sitting. [Note 1.]
And then she went back on this shelf to the 4th
book—that's the next to the one she's been in.
She Oldened that right at the beginning, the very
beginning ; she found there were such appro-
priate words applied to the impressions and the
sense of her presence that you get at home. Mr.
Bill, I must tell you she's trying to make me see
this book, see inside of it, and it doesn't seem to
be the begiiming of the proper reading, something
that comes right at once in the book, before that.
[Note 2.]
And, Mr. Bill, have you got a Saint's ? Have you
got a book about Saints very close to this one,
because I get the idea of Saints from it, and Mrs.
Dora keep saying, " That's right, that's right. The
idea of Saints." [Note 3.]
Also close to the 5th book—the first one she went
to—there's a book that she feels doesn't belong to
you. But it must, or he wouldn't have it there !
She says, " Never mind, say what I say." She
senses strongly it belongs to some one else, an older
man than you, some one who's passed over. She
shows me a letter W in connection with this. She
tried to write the name and I saw a large W com-
mencing it. " The book will give you the clue to
that at once," she says. Spotted book, s2:)otted
book, spotted book. She also felt a book, she's
going to call it a spotted book. She felt it must
be a book, when you opened it you found it all
over spots inside. Like measles ? " No, no," she
says, " I don't know what gives me the idea of
spots." . . . Dora says, " I can't say I really saw
the spots in the book." I must go slowly.
[Note 4.]
[Another book-test was then given which is omitted
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 231
here, as the page does not seem to have been cor-
rectly indicated].
Near to where these books are, is there anything left
lying there looking like bits of coal ?
W. S. I. Shouldn't think so.
F. I got to tell you. She kept touching something that
she couldn't make out, like bits of something, they
were black, looked like small bits of coaL But
perhaps you'll look there ? See if you can see what
she means, and she says, " That's Avhat they seemed
to me they were—coal." Yes. Mr. Bill, have you
got something there that she would feel connected
with her sittings ?
\V. 8. I. I don't think so.
F. She sajs, "Yes, yes." She says you've forgotten and
it's a good thing you have. Directly you get there
you'll be reminded of her sittings at once and of
Feda. You've also got the wrong date, wrong
numbers or something there, wrong date. Something
Dora felt as if she wanted to pull down, and take
away. You have left it there and it docsn t mean
anything now. Wrong dates. [Note 5.]
Notes by Mr. Irving.
1. The room is my drawing-room Avhich is papered ^ith
light-coloured paper ; the only book-shelves are to the
left front as you enter the room. I very seldom go to
this shelf, and had not for a long time, nor had I any
idea \^'hat books were on the shelf. The 5th book from
the left on the lo-^i-est shelf was Cowper's Poems. I have
not read this book. Page 68, second line, I found the
words :
" prescribes the terms."
There are 35 lines on this page. Line 20, which is on
the lower part, therefore, of the page, is :
" The tidings of unpurchased heav'n create."
And line 22 contains the words "all language at a loss."
Both these sentences would fit the test.
2. The book was Ki^ig Henry IV. Pari II. Inside the
232 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
cover I found a Coat of Arms ; and underneat]i, in good-
sized letters, tlie words :
" Non sans droict."
1 am told that " Not without reason " is a legitimate
translation. " Not without right " would also do.
3. The second book from the left on this shelf was The
Visio7i of St. Christopher, by Fryer, and the 3rd book from
the left was The Little Floivers of St. Francis of Assisi.
4. The " spotted book " is undoubtedly the 1st book on
the left on this shelf. It also proves to be a book that
does not belong to me, but to my father-in-law, Mr. R. W.
E. Whitehead, and which I did not know was in my
possession. The book is Nouvelles, hy Alfred de Musset.
The covers are mottled and spotted and the inside of the
covers, and the first and last sides of the fly-leaves are
mottled also. Inside the book is written in French a
a short note from my father-in-law to my wife asking her
to take care of the book for him for a time. It is dated
30.7.15. The name " R. W. E. Whitehead" is also in
the book. It has been stamped in. After the la])se of
eight years I cannot tell whether I have seen these things
before or not. I think probably I have, almost certainly.
Mr. Whitehead is still alive.
5. There were a few very tiny specks of what appear
to be coal close to the shelves. This is curious, as it is
long since I have had a fire in the drawing-room, and the
grate is near the door. A new jihotograph of ]\Irs.
Leonard is on the piano, one which in September I told
Mrs. Leonard looks like her when Feda is controlling.
The calendar on my wife's writing-desk is left at Sep-
tember, 1918, as she left it. The last two points of course
were known to me.
I have included this test mainly on account of the
knowledge shown concerning the room in which the books
were situated, and especially for the reference to the
" spotted book." The attempts to describe the contents
of the books seem to me to suffer from the defect to
which I have already referred above (see p. 208 ) ; too
much " int('r])T('tation is r('f|nircd.

§8. "Making of Man."
Extract from Sitting loith Mrs. Leonard, A'pril 30, 1924.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. E. J. Dingwall.
DA. They've [the Psychical Researchers] got some new
books there. A new book. Wait a bit. That'll
be a awful hard one ! Mr. Bill, there's some one
in that room, the Psychical 'Searchers' room, has
got a new book which has been there, and she
Avould think \^'as c{uite new, and had not been read
before at all. It was put down there on a table
and left there.
S. I. Gently.
Left there and she felt it might not have just been
there, but left there a little while without any one
thinking anything verj^ much of it one way or
other. She says, " Have you got down those
"ticulars ?
"
S. I. Yes.
She want ^ow to try and get it clear as you can
about this book. From the feel of the book it
seemed to refer to psychic matters, but to only a
side of them which would interest certain people
—
would not interest everybody—she doesn't think.
And she opened the book page three, three. Page
thirty -three. And on that page—wait a minute
—
good description of place ? Try again. Was a
very good description of a place, and not only of a
place, but of a state or condition in which she, Dora,
is now living. And on the same page it speaks of
breaking down difficulties, breaking down barriers.
Dora says, Struck me that's what I've been doing
by getting through to you—wasn't put in that way,
but it fitted very well." She says, " It's an argu-
mentative kind of book." She says, ''
It opens in
an argumentative strain." That's not nice ! And
each time she looked into it she seemed to get the
element of argument. Wait !
" But just at the
beginning," she says, " but I don't think the first page
•
—I took it to be on the one, two, three, on the
234 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
third page, there was a reference to "
—what, Dora ?
—
to cross ? Wait a minute. To cross ? No ! There
was a reference to—oh dear !
—to cross-correspon-
dences. Wait ! Or at least, she says, " words which
meant that." One might almost call this book a
history. Not an ordinary history, but a history of
people—the things they'd done—as well as a cata-
logue—not cat and dog—catalogue of facts. Not
^
really an interesting book, she says, only interesting
to some people.
W. S. I. Wait.
F. 8he says, " When I touched it, I had a strong feeling
of some one who's passed ovei'. Once before I gave
you a test from this place which w&s connected with
some one who's passed."
W. S. 1. Yes.
F. "So," she say, "like that way. When I felt that
again, I thought I must speak of it, as you will be
able to place it." Do you think you've got all
that down ?
VV. S. I. Yes, but we should like to know where the book is,
if ])ossible.
F. Can you say where the book is ? She says, " It was
quite a new book—^just put, not on a shelf, but on
the top of a table." Dora says, " I don't know if
I'm right in saying table. It's not in the middle
of the room, it's on a shelf or something against a
wall, but it was—" Wait a minute ! 'Tis naughty
of you, Dora, you know they've got to write it.
Slie is still talking ! It was put in such a way
tliat it would not be noticed by everybody, so
would not be likely to be taken up or disturbed in
any way, and it was lying by itself. Seemed to
her only been there a short while, Mr. BilL She
says, " You see I don't thin]< it worth while taking
an ordinary book-test from these rooms." She says,
" I'm sure it's better to take an exceptional book,
a new book, that people would not have read or
looked into."

99] Sittings loith Mrs. Leonard. 235
The description quoted above was identified by Miss
Newton as referring probably to Making of Man, by
Sir Oliver Lodge. Concerning this book Miss Horsell, the
Assistant Secretary, notes :
Sir Oliver Lodge's book Making of Man came from the
Publishers a few days before Easter [April 20]. As it was
addressed to the Editor, I put it aside on the top of the
cupboard at the back of my writing-desk, as far as I can
recollect. It remained there over the Easter holidays until
I gave it to Mrs. Salter on Thursday', April 24.
E. M. Horsell.
May 21, 1924.
My own recollection is that after Miss Horsell showed
me the book on April 24, 1924, I left it at the S.P.R.
Rooms, but whether in Miss Newton's room (Miss Newton
being away at the time) or in Miss Horsell's room, I
cannot say. On April 26, 1924, I wrote to Mr. W.
Whately Smith about reviewing the book, and on May 6,
1924, the book was sent to him from the S.P.R. Office.
These dates are proved by the post-books. Only one
other quite new book was received at the S.P.R. Rooms
at about this time, and to this book very little of what
was said at the sittmg applies ;
only such general state-
ments as that it refers to "psychic matters," a statement
which would apply to almost every book found at the
S.P.R. rooms.
The passages in Making of Man, to which reference
seems to be intended, are as follows :
(Page 33.)
The Universe is one : it is not so much a sequence as
a co-existence. What we call " the next -world " is co-
existent and simultaneous with this.
(Lower on the same page.)
We may not fully understand why we should have had
to enter into this relation with Matter, an apparently alien
thing which, as all artists know, has to be coerced to
represent our ideas, and manipulated to display our con-
ceptions. But evidently the episode of earth-life is of
Q
236 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
importance ; we can surmise that the difficulties we en-
counter in Matter, the troubles caused by our animal-
ancestry, and all the struggle and effort which is here
necessarj', even for maintenance, have a training and
disciplining effect.
With regard to the statement that " it's an argumenta-
tive kind of book," " it opens in an argumentative strain,"
it may be noted that the preface begins with the words :
" The arguments of this book are," and the book as a
whole may be said to be argumentative in tone. The
allusion to " cross-correspondences " is not very clear, but
the reference is apparently to the title-page of the book
upon which appears Sir Oliver Lodge's name, followed by
a list of his titles, degrees, etc. It is mentioned among
these that he is a Corresponding Member of several foreign
Societies.
The reference to " corresponding Member " may possibly
have suggested " cross-correspondences," although there is
of course no allusion to cross-correspondences as they occur
in scripts. The title-jjage is not actually numbered, the
printed numbering begiiming with page 7.
To explain the statement that " one might almost call
this book a History. Not an ordinary history, but a
history of people—the things they'd done," the following
page-headings may be quoted from Chaj)ters III. and IV. :
" The Coming of Man ; The Rudiments of Life ; The
Rudiments of Sense ; The Rudiments of Mind ;
Primitive
Forethought ; The Development of Man ; Creation in
Literature ; Science and Poetry ; The Present Condition."
The following passages arc also taken from these
chapters :
(Pp. 79, 80.) The gradual growth, from mere creature
comfort, worlving through long periods of development up
to a higher potentiality, is thus depicted by F. W. H.
Myers in his poem called " A Cosmic History," in which
he rapidly traces the evolution of living creatures from the
dust of the earth, and then the mysterious incoming of
Mind. . . .
(Pp. 100, 101.) To reahsc the possibilities latent in
99] Sittings ^oifh Mrs. Leonarrl. 237
man, we must attend not to the average or the general
body of mankind, but to those geniuses of the race wliose
achievements stand out as signs and symbols, or portents,
of what the average may in time attain. . . . When one
visits a library, one feels overpowered by the industry and
minute care and labour which has gone to make it what
it is. Picture galleries, libraries, cathedrals, show what has
been so far accomplished. But beyond and above all that
industry we can recall to ourselves higher and more unique
achievements, in expressing human emotions, in under-
standing human character and actions, in penetrating into
the secrets of Nature. It must suffice to cite three typical
instances—Beethoven, Shakespeare, Newton—and leave the
rest to thought and imagination. Already the development
of man has been prodigious.
The statement that the book gave the communicator
" a strong feeling of some one who's passed over " pre-
sumably refers to the fact that it is dedicated " To
the Memory of my Friend F. W. H. Myers and of
my Son Raymond, his Pupil, with Gratitude for their
Help."
With regard to the position of the book the communi-
cator at first says that it was on " the top of a table "
;
subsequently she corrects this and says " it's not in the
middle of the room, it's on a shelf or something against
the wall."
The cupboard on the top of which the book lay until
April 24, 1924, as appears from Miss Horsell's statement,
is against the wall of the room. Where exactly the book
was at the time of the sitting on April 30, 1924, cannot
now be ascertained, as I have indicated above, but we
may take it as established that it remained at the S.P.R.
Rooms until May 6, 1924.
It appeared desirable to obtain evidence as to what
normal knowledge of the book IV'Irs. Leonard might have
had at the time of the sitting, and accordingly Miss
Newton wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge, on May 21, 1924, to
ask whether he could say whether Mrs. Leonard had a
copy of his book, Making of Man, and whether he had
238 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PABT
himself given her one. Sir Oliver Lodge replied as
follows :
May 22, 1924.
I have no reason to suppose that Mrs. Leonard has seen
my book.
I keejD a list of all those to whom I have sent a co^^
—over 100—but her name is not on the list.
I think she occurred to me, and I refrained. If I ask
her if she has in any way seen it, I know that she will
answer truthfully. I will ask her.
Oliver Lodge.
Subsequently Sir Oliver Lodge sent us Mrs. Leonard's
reply to his question as follows :
May 23 [1924.]
I have not seen a copy of your latest book Making
of Man, but heard of it first through a journalist who
lives next door, and who called and asked me to lend him
a copy. I intended getting one—in order that he might
read it^ as well as myself—as he is a nice man who is
spreading knowledge of the subject.
I should love to have a copy of the book, but am afraid
it might influence my mind, or rather people would think
it did, which is almost as bad.
It may be best for me not to read it at present, so that
I can truthfully affirm I have not done so.
I would rather leave it to you. It is a great tempta-
tion. Your lecture interested us so much, we feel we
want to read Making of Man. Perhaps it is best for
me to know nothing about anything ! Novels seem to
be the only mind-diet approved for me—by the other
side. . . .
Gladys Leonard.
The lecture referred to was a lecture on " Mind and
Matter," given by Sir Oliver Lodge at the Steinway Hall
on February 6, 1924. It is reported in Light, February
16 and 23, 1924.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 239
§9. "Infelice."
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
Tuesday, September 23, 1924.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.
Feda. Don't know how he's going to get that ! Is it in
London? Dora says, "This is a little bit difficult
to explain to Feda, but this is a jolace in London,
a room in London, and you could verify these
things either to-night, or in the morning, because
you'll be in the place where the books are." Now
it's not the Psychical 'Searchers' place, and it isn't
—you luiow where Mr. George used to be
—'tisn't
there, but she's just going to put it as a place
you're going to be in to-night.
W. S. I. To-night ?
F. Yes, to-night. So there can't be any mistake about
it, because you're going to be there to-night. Mr.
Bill, she must get the description of the room right
here. You go in at the door, and cross the room
to the right, not opposite, but to the right. (Feda
indicates crossing the room, not to a point opposite
the door, but to the right front.)
W. S. I. Little .to the right ?
F. To the wall opposite the door, but the books are
slightly on the right. Dora was a little puzzled as
to these books being on ordinary shelves—some
irregularity about them. An arrangement of them
made her feel she must measure, instead of trying
to find the shelf. She says, " I should judge it to
be about 4 feet from the floor," and she says she
thinks she's probably right, 'cos, she says, " I was
rather good at guessing little things like that when
I was here." Look ! 'Bout that was what she
felt, and she thinks that 'bout 4 foots. (Feda in-
dicates height on the screen behind Mrs. Leonard.
We measured later and found that the place indi-
cated was 48| inches from the floor.) She says,
" On a Line with bottom of this thing, so look after,
the top one here, just underneath him." She says
240 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
she guesses that to be 'bout 4 feets. " Now you
take the books as usual from left to right," she
says, and she took the fifth. As she opened the
book, the very beginning, she had the feeling it
must be a Bible. Then she discovered it wasn't,
but that certain words, and the names given, were
well-known Biblical ones, and that you could dis-
cover them at tlie very beginning of the book, and
even before you began the actual reading matter.
Then, she said, look at page eleven, and you will
see a description of evening, things one does in the
evening, things that hapjien at night. Got a strong
imj^ression of night from this page. Thought she
saw the word " soft " on the lower part of the page.
She felt a very peaceful condition from it, as of
Avords suggesting peace, and^—wait a minute—she
turned over the l>age, and looking down the next
page she came across a verj^ good description of a
picture that you got at home, Mr. Bill, a picture
you're fond of too, you're fond of. She says, "Not
a new picture, one you've had a good long time,
but the important part of that book-test."
W. S. I. Did you say " That is " ?
F. "That is." Now do you think you've got that clear?
W. S. I. I shall be in one room rather like that, but not quite,
and one I might go to that is like it ; which is it ?
P. The one you might, but you are going to. As if she's
pushing you. You're almost as bound to go as you
are to tlie other room. I think Dora exj^ects you to
go there, Mr. Bill. Yes, she is, Mr. Bill. You
must go.
W. S. I. Right, I'll go.
F. Then Dora says, " Funny thing, it's not good enough
to get it out of the other one."
W. S. I. That quite answers that.
F. " Now, she says, you've got all I said about the fifth
book, page eleven, about '
peace '
and so on, turn
over page and then the description of the picture at
home." [Notes 1 and 2.]
Now, Mr. Bill, on this same line of boolvs, but a little
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 241
more to the right than the books she's told you
about, she kept being reminded of some one.
She says, " Some one I have spoken to you about
before, a Canon, Canon." She doesn't mean a gun,
she means a gentleman. It's some one she spoke to
you about quite a long time ago, she says, and she
felt strongly that his name, or reference to Canon,
was on the outside of a book just there. She says
do you remember the man she means ?
W. S. I. Yes.
F. - Because there's something else about him as ^^•ell, do
you see ? Take the seventh book from the left, the
next but one to the one you had before, and, she
says, look at page thirty-seven, thirty-seven—you've
given that page several times before—she seems
rather fond of sevens !
" On that page thirty-seven,
you'll find a slight description, not a long descrip-
tion, a short description, of the circumstances con-
nected with that man which I tried to speak to
you of some time ago, and which I had been rather
worried about." She says, "Do you remember that
my test then was spoilt ? " She says, " You
understand, don't you, to whom I am referring ?
"
Get it clear.
W. S. I. The Canon.
F. Yes. She says, " Get it quite clear, and ask her if
you're not clear. Be sure and ask her. It's a
clear reference to circumstances that I helped you
with some time ago in connection with him."
W. S. I. I remember all that.
F. "Now a book towards the left again—going back to
the left—the title might be applied in a compli-
mentary sense to my evidence, and please don't
think I'm conceited about it."
W. S. I. Oh no.
F. She says, " I've got to say that, it's part of the test."
She says, have you got it down exactly as
she said it? About "conceited"? "Because you
would when you see what the word is," she says.
[Note 3.]
242 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
Will you enquire if a ladder's been desired for that
room, or if a ladder's been in it lately 1
W. S. I. Desired or been in it ?
F. Desired and been in it. "I got the thought of a
ladder so strongly in that room." [Note 4.]
Damp, damp, been something wet or damp in this
room, which she could feel, as though she wanted
to dry something up. Got that ?
W. S. I. Yes.
F. Wet or damp. [Note 5.]
And also Dora says, " You know that I hate dead
insects." She didn't lilie insects when she was here.
Nobody does in this country ! She hopes they've
left him there. There was a large dead insect close
to the books, and she has an idea it will still be
there. " His presence wouldn't be evidential," she
says, "if it were not near the books—but it is."
[Note 6.]
Cheese, cheese. I don't know what you mean
!
Cheese, cheese. Wait a minute ! Is cheese to do
with this same thing ? Cheese. Dora says, " I got
such a peculiar feeling in this room of cheese."
She says, " You know I've got to give these absurd
thoughts." She says, " I looked all round and
couldn't see what it was, but I got the feeling
cheese, cheese." Do you know, Mi\ Bill, she says
when she's seen or felt a silly thing like that before,
she's generally been right. [Note 7.]
Would you look round too and see if there's a picture
of a crown in the room ? She says, " I kept feeling
and visualising a rather magnificent crown." She
says. " I wonder if I'm right using that word '
mag-
nificent.' The idea I got—something very important,
a very imj^ortant crown, not just a ducal one, but
some very important crown." Is that right ? Yes.
[Note 8.]
Hidden poetry. She felt strongly that there was some
poetry in this room, but as if hidden away—prob-
ably put into a box or drawer, in the room. She
says, " I could sense poetry in the room, but I
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 243
couldn't see it anjrwhere. I know it's covered up
in the room—shut up in something—and I felt that
it was closed up in something dark. Not a light
cover, but a dark.
W. S. I. Colour ?
F. Cover. [Note 9.]
Oh, typed. Paper with typing on in this room.
Wait a minute ! Paper with typing on in this
room, or else, she says, print that was made to
look like ty}3ing. [Note 10.]
And she says, " Feathers, feathers." Wait a minute,
please ! She says, " I felt feathers, as if there was
a bunch of feathers, not one feather only, but some-
thing like a group or bunch of feathers." None of
these wiU be in your mind, Mr. Bill. She's pur-
posely felt the things that would not be in your
mind. Dora's very clever at sort of missing those
things. [Note 11.]
W. S. I. She's very clever generally.
F. Yes, she says, she knows. And what ? Wait a
mirmte then ! Now, Mr. Bill, that's all for that
room, but she's got some more tests she's going to
give you before she goes home. . . . She says she
always listen to what Peda call you. You know,
Feda call you Bill. She more polite. She say
Will. Well, this name "Bill" she's going to present
to you in large letters to-night.
VV. S. I. Something new, sounds bad, in a way.
F. She's going to put the word—she knows she can—in
great big letters just in front of you, in such a
way that you can't avoid seeing it, nor can you
mistake it.
W. S. I. I like that sort of thing.
F. "So," she says, "you needn't go looking for it. It'll
be just there in front of you, very large." She
says, " Very large."
Now, be careful over this ! She says, " As you're look-
ing at that, you'll be also surrounded with something
to do with politics. 'Least you'll have been think-
ing of them a second before—such a little while
244 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
before, so the idea of politics is to be considered as
well as the fact of the name being there." Now,
she says, she"s not sure if you'll have had to discuss
it, or read about it, but she knows the idea of
politics will be very much mixed up with the name.
She says, " This working along the line of associa-
tion interests me very much," she says. Wait a
minute ! [Note 12.]
Oh ! Short of vegetables ! Short of vegetables ! Wait
a bit ! Mr. Bill, can you remember saying just
lately about being short of vegetables ?
W. S. I. Yes, I said some one was.
F. Dora didn't know what you referred to, but she heard
you say "short of vegetables." The reason for
mentioning that is that you'll be reminded to night
about the same thing. It'll make you say it again,
" Oh, short of vegetables." Perhaps he'd better buy
some and make sure ! No, Dora says, that would spoil
it. No, you couldn't take any with you, Mr. Bill. She
says you'll know exactly what she means. [Note 13.]
Mr. Bill, she says such a peculiar thing. It's because
of something you were thinking of, she saying it.
She says, " Of course babies who are not born have
souls, babies who don't live properly." But, Mi".
Bill, she's saying that rather specially. It's some-
thing you were thinking of a little while ago.
W. S. I. Yes, I remember.
F. She thinks you would. She says, " They do." Wait
a minute, Dora, please. . . . [Note 14.]
Extracts from the D. G. I. Control, which followed.
D. G. I. There's another thing I wanted you to remember
—
about seeing some old friends who reminded you of
me. I Avanted you to know I was there. I wanted
you to remember that, Will.
W. S. I. Is that the jAixce where tlie book-test is ?
D. G. I. Yes.
W. S. I. I thought it was.
D. G. I. You shouldn't have mentioned it. PeojDle I like, you
know.

Will, not at the present moment, but I felt that one
of these was ill a little while ago. Not so much
now, Will. I'm not asking this, I'm only putting
it in the form of a question—did they ask you, or
tell you, about a friend of theirs that passed over
lately ? Oh no, you might hear that now. Some
one they're very interested in.
W. S. I. Thej' didn't tell me anything.
D. G. I. A man. Will, you'd better ask. I think it's only
just occurred. It will be most interesting if it's
occurred and they haven't heard yet. Will, you'd
better tell them, I think, because it'll make them
look out for it more.
W. S. I. Is it a very close relation ?
I can't tell. I only get the thought, the vibration,
that some one has passed over quite recently, a
man. When I'm a^\'ay from here, I shall probably
know everything. [Note 15.]
Notes by Mr. Irving.
1. In order that the identity of Y. (pseudonym) may
not be discovered, I have been obliged to disguise certain
details in my notes on these tests from his house. Full
names and facts have been given to the Secretary of the
S.P.R. Ml'. Y. is the son of some old friends of mine
who live in a parish in which I used to be interested.
Mr. Y. is now married and lives in town. In recent
years I had met him but seldom, and at the time of the
sitting knew nothing of his business or occupation. I had
visited his house for the first time and dined with him
and his wife on the Sunday immediately before the sitting,
and after dinner we had talked on psychical matters. I
told him some of my experiences in research, and said that
it would be interesting if my communicator would give me
a book-test, or other tests, from his house. My wife
had known him in Life fairly well. Mr. Y. at once
suggested that should I get any tests of that nature, I
should come round straight to his house after the sitting,
and take " pot-luck " at dinner. I did not of course
examine his books, and neither in the book-test just
246 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
described, nor in the impression tests that follow, does
there seem to be any material that could have been known
to me, save in the case of the one or two minor points
that are noted.
2. Feda's description of the room left me at first in
doubt as to which of two rooms was intended, my bed-
room at my London rooms, where there is a book-shelf
opposite the door, or the drawing-room at Mr. Y.'s house.
The answer to my question as to whether I must, or
might, go to the room that night settled this point. There
are in ]VIi-. Y.'s drawing-room two sets of book-shelves, one
opjiosite the door, the other to the right front as you go
in. The latter are indicated. They do not start from the
floor, but are over a bureau and have glass doors. The
shelf which approximates most nearly to the description is
the second shelf up. Its height from the floor is 50 inches.
The fifth book from the left was Infelice, by A. J. Evans
Wilson, Nesbit and Co., Ltd. On the title-page I found
the names Tiberius, James and St. Elmo, and the words
"The Grace of God." On the first page of the reading
matter, numbered, however, page 7, " Hannah." On the
pages numbered 17 and 18, Cyrus and Solomon. On page
8 was the Biblical quotation " sounding brass or tinlding
cymbals," also I found the words " to baptise " on the
same page. On the page numbered 11 I found nothing
as described, but counting the pages from the beginning
of the printed matter (a method my communicator seems
to adopt at times) we come to page 9 as the eleventh
page. Here I found a description of certain " things that
happen at night" as follows: "The glare of the fire, and
the mellow glow of the student's lamp fell full on the
pale features." On line 26 of this page of 48 lines, not
counting the heading—that is, rather more than half-way
down the page—Avas the word " soft." On page 8, which
touches page 9, when closed, were further references to
evening and night. " Good-night, Miss Elise." " It was
a tempestuous night in the latter part of January. . . .
As the night wore on, the wind increased in violence . . .
tlie hands of the china clock on the dining-room mantel-
piece pointed to nine." On the bottom line of the page
i
Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 247
numbered nine were the words " your words of benedic-
tion." Turning over the page, I found on the sixteenth
line of the page numbered ten, the word " violets." I
have in my drawing-room at home a good-sized framed
painting of a mass of violets, mingled with forget-me-nots
and maiden-hair fern, in the form of a horse-shoe. This
painting my wife and I bought and framed ourselves, some
25 years ago, when buying things for our first furnishing.
I am very fond of it, not only for association's sake, but
also because it is a beautiful piece of water-colour work.
Confirmatory Note by Miss Newton.
I have verified the above allusions in Mrs. Y.'s copy of
Infelice.
The incidents related in the first chapter, which occupies
pp. 7-16, take place in a parsonage on a wild and stormy
evening. A bright fire is being kept up and the " pas-
tor's " supper kept warm. When the pastor returns, he
is informed that a stranger is waiting to see him in the
library. " Before you go in," said his sister, "let me give
you your supper, for you must be tired and hungry."
But the pastor says he must first see the visitor, whose
errand may be urgent. She is a woman with a " sweet
though tremulous voice " and " large soft brown eyes."
After rather an excited and stormy interview on her part
she refers to the parsonage as " this sanctuary of peace."
I. Newton.
Notes by Mr. Irving {continued).
3. More than one Canon has been spoken about in my
various sittings, but I recognised the " Canon " meant here
by the sentence about " a test then " having been " spoilt."
This particular Canon was Vicar of the parish where Mr.
Y. lived some years ago. The sentence " on this same
line of books " is unusual. I found no mention of this
Canon's name on the outside of any book to the right on
this shelf, so tried the shelf below. On the shelf below
and one and a half feet to the right was a pile of books
placed horizontally on the shelf. The top one, which was
only one and a half inches below the shelf above, and
248 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
forty-eight and a half inches from the floor—the height
originally given through Feda—was an album containing
newspaper cuttings which had been pasted in. On pages
three and seven Canon is mentioned by name, his
actual surname being given after the word Canon. It is
not a common name. On page eleven I found his photo-
graph among a group of people. In another album
immediately below the first, on the second page, were
photographs of the interior and exterior of his church. . . .
A book towards the left was " Good Words." It was
on the test shelf.
Mr. Irving then goes on to discuss the reference given
at the sitting to the seventh book from the left in the
original shelf. In regard to this reference there seems to
have been some confusion and the details are not given
here.
Notes by Mr. Irving {continued).
4. I went direct to Mr. Y.'s house immediately after the
sitting, only stopping for tea en route, and verified these
tests. Mr. Y, said that about a week before this he had
found that the lamp hanging from the ceiling wanted
cleaning, so went and fetched the steps. Also about five
weeks before ladders were being used in this room, the
drawing-room, by men white-washing the ceiling.
5. On Monday, September 15, a water-bottle had been
upset on the bed in the room above and everything was
soalced and had to be aired.
6. We could find no dead insect in the drawing-room
near the books. On Sunday, September 21, Mrs. Y. tells
me that she thought she saw a spider in the dining-room
cupboard, but left it, as she is frightened of them.
7. Mrs. Y. had got some frightfully strong cheese, and
had been talking about it every day, she tells me. On
the day of my sitting she had bought some milder.
8. A good-sized vase in the room of old Worcester
parrot china has a crown on its base. The only other
crowns we could find were on the buttons of Mr. Y.'s
uniform in a photograph.
9. Mr. Y. had hidden some poetry of his own in a
Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 249
dark-covered book behind the left-hand bookcase border.
The border projects, so that the book was out of sight.
Also there was some poetry written by Mr. and Mrs. Y.
together in a bright red-covered book in a sliding drawer
in a desk in this room. I had no idea myself that they
ever wrote poetry.
10. On my asking about this Mr. Y. first handed to me
a book called A Practical Course of Touch Type-writing
,
by C. E. Snaith, and then put before me a bundle of bills
for decorating and furnishing which were tj-ped. By
showing me the latter he fulfilled, it would seem, a pre-
diction given later in the sitting (see above p. 243 and
note 12 below). I knew that expensive decorations had
been done recently.
11. Mr. Y. went straight to the bureau under the right-
hand bookcase, and brought out a large bunch of feathers.
12. During dinner at the Y.'s, and before verifying most
of these tests, Mr. Y. remarked to me that the crush in
the Tube had been great that night when he returned from
work. This gave me the opportunity to ask what he
was doing now, and where working. He replied, "In a
Parliamentary Office at Westminster." The subject of
politics was thus introduced. It must have been half an
hour later, however, before the bills were put before me
as described above.
13. In verifying these tests I missed this one, and it
was not till I got back to my roonas that night and went
again through my notes that I found it. About three
weeks before the sitting a neighbouring vicar had come to
lunch with me at my vicarage, and my housekeeper had
provided three or four different kinds of vegetables. My
friend had remarked that he wished he had vegetables
like that, but the fowls destroyed his. This I told my
housekeeper and she gave him a vegetable-marrow to take
home. At dinner at the Y.'s that night the only vege-
table had been potatoes. At dinner there on the Sunday
before there was also celerj''.
14. On Sunday, September 21, at dinner we had talked
about various theories with regard to the soul, transmigra-
tion, absorption, etc. Mrs. Y. had asked me if I thought
250 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
that babies who die after birth and before baptism go to
Heaven. Mr. Y. had remarked, " My wife's very keen on
a brand-new soul for ever}^ baby that's born into the
world."
15. Mrs. Y. had been taken ill in June and had had to
go away early in August. I believe though that this had
been spoken about on the Sunday before the sitting.
On my enquiring about the " friend " said to have
" passed over," Mr. Y. told me that on September 20 he
had been shocked to hear that his cousin's wife's father
had been killed in a motor accident. He had read this
in the paper. He can scarcely be called a " friend," but
the occurrence impressed Mr. Y. strongly because of its
suddenness. ^ -r
W. S. Irving.
Corroborative Statement by Mr. Y.
I certify tliat the Notes to the above test are correct,
and that I was present when the test was verified.
(Signed) [E. Y.].
In spite of some confusion and inaccuracy here and
there the above record, taken as a whole, affords striking
evidence of apparently supernormal knowledge. The fact
that Mr. Irving had dined with Mr. and Mrs. Y. at their
house a few days before the sitting may have established
a necessary link, but, as Mr. Irving himself points out, a
considerable part of the knowledge shown cannot have been
derived from his mind.
It is unfortunate that in regard to the most precise
point given in the book-test described above, the reference
to things done in the evening and the occurrence of the
word " soft," there should be some doubt as to how the
pages are to be counted. This is a constantly recurring
difficulty in book-tests, as readers of Mrs. Sidgwick's paper
will remember. If, as communicators allege, the tests are
carried out by " weighing up " the pages, and not by
reading the actual printed number, the difficulty seems
unsurmountable.
It is of interest to note that at this same sitting on
September 23, 1924, another successful book-test was
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 251
given, (from another house) in which there was again a
verified reference to a particular word. It is a fact,
which many sitters with Mrs. Leonard and other mediums
have doubtless observed, that good evidence tends to be
concentrated in particular sittings ; in other words a
" good " sitting is likely to be good throughout and a
confused sitting confused throughout.
Further Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, September 23, 1924.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.
Feda. Now then, she's going home now. She doesn't like
to leave you without going home at all, " gives
you something to do, when you get back," she says.
Wait a minute ! Now, ]\'Ir. BUI, she's not going to
her old place. You know two or three times
running lately she's gone to one place. She's going
to another room. Wait a minute ! Have to be
rather careful. You have mentioned this room
before though. Wait a minute ! How are you
going to get that ? Rather large chest of drawers
in it ? She's going to another room, and she was
looking round to show me something about it, and
she says, " Large chest of drawers."
W. .S. I. I know the place.
F. Wait a minute ! Now what does that mean ? Mr.
BUI, do you understand if there are some books
near the chest of drawers ? For she keeps on about
the chest of drawers. Mr. Bill, she is movmg her
hand rather high. I feel like higher than the chest
of drawers itself, not in the drawers. You'll have
to count from the left, take the first book you
come to on the left. The begimiing of this book
she got the idea of spring-time. Very clearly and
distinctly, as if the word had j)opped out at her.
Now, wait a minute, please, Dora. She then went
to page one, figure 0—ten. That's a nice number to be
sure it's right, for you can't get 0, one, but you
can get one, 0. Just near the top of the page
certain words could refer to marrying again. At
the bottom of the same page—then she stopped
252 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
and said, " You can pnt down re-marrying if you
like, but I like the words better marrying again,
it seemed to fit in." At the bottom of the same
page there's a little message, just a few words, that
Dora doesn't want to say much about, but that
you will take as a personal message, something she
would like to say to you. Not a very evidential
one, but it fits in with the time of the year. Have
I got that right, Dora ? It fits in with the time
of the year, she says.
W. S. J. Yes, I understand.
F. And in this same book, 46, on page 46, there's a
what ? There's a further reference to the same
thing, only in a more evidential way. Wait a
minute ! It specifies—that's right—it specifies a
reason for her wanting to send you a personal
message just now.
W. a. I. The reason ?
F. A reason. Not your words, Dora. You wouldn't
say 'em like that. Dora says just now, Mr. Bill, is
rather important time of the year. It's an anni-
versary, well, it's a double one, isn't it ? she says.
She looks at you and says, " Will, it's a double
one." " Now, she says, Will, you heard what I
said, it's a double one." She said, " I had to get
that in puriDOsely." Wait till he's jiut that down,
Dora. Because on the outside of a book there
—
close to the one she was quoting from is a book
whose title conveys her meaning exactly, about a
double one ;
repeating her words a little differently,
but the same sense exactly.
Note by Mr. Irving.
I verified this test by myself, without a witness, because
I gathered from the script that it was intended to be a
" personal " rather than an " evidential " book-test, and
it is extremely diflicult to get books witnessed properly
here without causing local talli. I find that the test is
evidentially strong, however, and that there is no reason
why I should not make it public, I have therefore sent
i
Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 253
the book to the S.P.R. Secretary to examine, and have
certified that the book " The Shakspere Birthday-Book
"
was found by me in the position described. The book
I recognised from the descrii^tion given througli Feda as
having been taken from a row of books on the top of a
chest of drawers in my bedroom at home. No boolv-test
has been given before from this room, but the room has
been described. In the middle of the chest of drawers
is a work-basket of my Avife's. To the right of the work-
basket is a short row of five books, to the left a row of
seven books. The first book counting from the left iii
the left-hand section was "The Shakspere Birthday-Book.""
I have never read the book, but at times have glanced
into it. It belonged to my wife, as did nearly aU the
books in this room. It is not however the Birthday-book
in which my wife entered the dates of her friends' birth-
days. That book is next to it on the right, and is called
" Children's Birthday-Book." At the beginnmg of the
" Shakspere Birthday-Book " on the first page of the Preface,
which is numbered 5, I found near the bottom of the page.
Faster than Spring-time showers
Comes thought on thought.
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
On page 10 the fifth and sixth lines from the top,
counting the heading,
0 Time, thou must untangle this, not I
;
It is too hard a knot for me to untie.
At the bottom of the page—save for the last two lines
—
is the following which I take to be the personal message :
There is a tide in the affairs of men.
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows, and in miseries ;
We must take the current as it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
On page 46 I found the lines :
So part we sadly in this troublous world.
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
254 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
My mother died on September 29, 1912, and my wife
on October 25, 1918—hence the words " It fits in with
the time of the year," and " It's an anniversary. . . .
It's a double one," in the script. The phrase " sweet
Jerusalem " is not one my wife would have used when on
earth. I take the first j^ersonal message to be one to
]3ersevere in psychical research while I have the oppor-
tunity. The second joersonal message is obvious.
The book, the title of which is said to convey the com-
municator's meaning exactly " about a double one," must,
I think, be the " Children's Birthday-Book." Death is at
times spoken of by communicators as birth into new
life.
The reference to ca personal message to be found at the
bottom of the tentli page docs not seem to me a strong
point ; the verification is too indefinite ; the statement
made at the sitting suggests a message more immediately
personal to Mr. Irving than an allusion to the importance
of persevering in his psycliical researches.
Nor does the point concerning the title of a book wliicli
is to refer to the communicator's statement about " a
double one " seem to me satisfactory. I should myself
have expected from the statement made at the sitting
some allusion to I'epetition, or at least to " doubleness
"
in some form. It has occurred to me that the com-
municator may have been trying to refer to the fact that
there were two Birthday Books in the shelf, the one from
which the tests were taken and the " Children's Birthday-
Book " standing next to it.
The quotation found near the top of page 10 contains
words which might clearly refer to marriage, or to the
breaking of the marriage bond ; the idea of re-marriage
is not clearly expressed. The other points in the test,
as Mr. Irving says, are definite. Both Miss Newton and
I have seen the " Shakspere BLrthday-Book " and verified
Mr. Irving's statements concerning its contents.
Below are two instances taken from Mr. Irving's sittings
in which an actual word given by the communicator was
found at the place apparently indicated.

This test was taken from Mr. Irving's drawing-room.
The book was Robinson Crusoe. On page 28, on the
third and fourth lines from the bottom of the page, were
the words " History of the Wars of Charles XII., King
of Sweden."
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, April 28, 1925.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Dingwall.
Fkda. On the second shelf, you must take the fourth book
from the left. . . . Twenty-seven, what are 3'ou
suddenly giving twenty-seven for ? She's giving
twenty-seven, twenty-seven. Oh, Mr. Bill, it's the
page. . . . Will you also notice if on this page, or
the page facing it, if there's anything about cooking ?
Dora got a strong idea of cooking.
The test on this occasion was taken from the bedroom
in London, where Mr. Irving was staying at the time.
The book apparently indicated was The Virginians, by
Thackeray. On the seventh lino of page 27 were the
words " a good cook."
§ 10. CoNCEENiNG Canon PARKER ^ AND Leckhampton.
I have classified the following incident book-test,
because it falls under the general head of suggesting super-
normal knowledge concerning printed matter. It more
closely resembles some of the " newspaper tests " which
IVIr. Drayton Thomas has reported, both in his book and
in an article printed in the S.P.R. Journal (Vol. XX. p. 89).
The present case is unfortunately of a kind which it is
not easy to describe clearly without being long-winded,
because such parts of the statement as are veridical are
' Pseudonym.

Extract from Sitting tvith Mrs. Leonard, January 23, 1923.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : ]VIr. R. R. Farmer.
Feda. All right, I'll tell liim that. Do you know Dora's
been helloing some one who's passed over again ?
A man, not a Avoman. She says I must go steadily
here. Just lately, quite latelj^ a man has passed
over that Dora has been able to hel]), and he's
passed over since your last sitting here ; no one
she spoke of then, no, no, no ! That's why she
wants you to go careful. The man had not passed
over then. She wants me to be very careful,
because it's a test. You have not seen this man
for some time, Mr. Bill. He belongs to your earlier
life, and you knew him better than Dora did. You
were not living where you are no^v when you knew
him, and he would be older than you, considerably
older. Oh, wait a minute. I don't feel that he
belonged to that part of the world where you come
from at all, not now.
W. S. I. I've got that.
F. I get a letter C with him, C, and at one time he
used to talk to you a lot and sort of advise you.
You and he wouldn't always agree, you'd see things
differently. You would like be naturally inchned to
disagree with him, but I don't think you did. Why
didn't he ? Was he frightened of him ? His
position and age made it almost impossible for you
to stand up and disagree with him. He was a tall
man, large, rather bony frame, dark, but even then
dark turning grey. I get a name like Black,
Blaben, Blacken. I have to give it to you as
being Black, Blackburn. Feel he had a lot to
do with that name, don't laiow if to do with
a person or place ; and the name beginning Cross,
Crossley, I'm not quite sure of this, but it
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 257
sounded like Crossley, is liaised up with it too.
That name seems to be important, Mr. Bill. Cross,
Crossley, Crus, Crosslan. Dora says, " This man has
only passed over quite, quite lately. You might
not even have heard of it yet. Don't try and
guess." She always try to find out things you
don't know. Yes, tell me ? Oh ! This man was
the cause or part of the cause of a disappointment
to you, a set-back to you. Have you got all that
down ?
W. S. 1. Yes.
F. She doesn't suppose you'll know much about it until
you hear about the man, then it'll bring it all back.
Limiton. There's another name bcgiiming with an
L that's also connected with it. Not an ordinary
name like Lizzie, It's like Limiton. Just keep
that just as she's given it. Don't worry about it
• at all.
Note by Mr. Irving.
In spite of various incorrect statements I recognised the
above as a description of a former Vicar of mine, Canon
{Parker'], Curate-in-Charge of Lccldiampton, with whom I
worked from 1909-1912. He is not tall, but short, and
wiry and energetic. Canon {Parker] has now retired and
lives in Devonshii'e.
W. S. Irving.
Subsequently at Mr. Irving's request Miss Newton
added to this note the following confirmatory statement :
Feb. 1, 1923.
When Mr. Irving read the notes of his recent sittings
to me on Friday, January 26, 1923, he told me that
certain allusions and descriptions applied, he felt sure, to
Canon [Parker] of Leckhampton, and that he understood
from what Feda said that he would soon hear of Canon
[Parker s] death. My recollection is that Mr. Irving told
me that he had not heard of Canon [Parker] for some
time and knew nothing of his present conditions.

Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 25, 1923.
Sitter and Recorder : Rev. W. S. Irving.
Feda. Do you remember if Dora was sometimes called by
another name, not Dora ? I get a feeling she was
called something else.
W. S. I. By me ?
F. By her people, do you see ? She doesn't want you
to call her something else. By her people she had
sometimes been called by another name. Do you
think you can find this out ? Liu, Loe.
AV. S. 1. Draw it, (Sitter hands writing pad to Feda, who
draws wildly several Avords begimiing with L ; Leelo,
Lacey, better Feda, Lumda.)
F. Leek—she's got it down once. Then she says Lex,
Leek, Le, Le, Luckii, Leckri, Luck, Leek. Mx. Bill,
do you know there are two names beginning with L ?
Two. One's a bit longer than the other. Larry,
Lacli, Lachrun, Lerrican, noosance ! She calls Leck-
ton. She says I get the sound of it, but not quite
right. Both names that would be connected with
her earth life. Lechi. There's one starts with a
sound like Lechan.
W. S. 1. Shall I tell ?
F. No ! Better not. Lett. She was reminded of it
when she was trymg for a different name. She was
tiying and that reminded her. She says she was
called by another name, but not Dora.
W. S. .1. Is this an attempt at the name ?
F. No ! Lcck, she's gone back to it. Lecture, lecture.
It's like the beginning of lecture and it's something
she's been interested in, very interested indeed.
Then—I don't know why-—she says " Not finished
with yet." It's not a thing she's been interested
in and won't be any more. There's going to be
something happening that will keep up her interest,
do you see 1 And isn't it something you've been
thinking of lately ? She seems to have got it
through being with you, yes, she has ; and she says
she feels something rising out of this that she wants
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 259
to help about, that she'll have to help about in
some way. She says she's always glad when she's
given you a hint of something she's going to do.
She says you say, " Ah ! That's what she said in
the sitting." Arising out of this word " Lek " is
something Dora's going to help you with.
Extract from the same Sitting about an how later, during a
"personal control" by the Communicator, D. G. I.
W. S. I. Why did you talk so much about that place ? Is it
important ?
D. G. I. There isn't any importance about it at all, I only
wanted to make it clear to Feda. One has to be
definite sometimes to get the thing straight. None
of it was imj^ortant, but it was evidential.
(About a quarter of an hour dealing with other
matters.)
D. G. I. Do you remember another place where there were two
corners and at one there was an hotel and a post
office, and a place they sold fruit and vegetables,
close together bet^^'een the two streets ; and I used
to go there a good deal at one time 1 To the side
of it there was a blank place, waste ground, and a
sort of Orphanage, Home or Institute close there
too. You'll be going there soon again. Don't for-
get, to the side there's all waste ground.
VV. S. I. Where we lived ?
D. G. 1. Yes, I went many many times down that particular
bit of road.
W. S. I. Leckhampton Road Corner ?
D. G. I. Yes. Don't you remember if you walked back again
you'd go ujDhill a little 1
W. S. I. No. [It was correct.]
D. G. I. I notice things more than you do.
It may be well at this point to sum up briefly what
the statements quoted above appear to indicate. At the
sitting of January 23, 1923, it is stated that a man,
identified by Mx. Irving as Canon Parker, has quite lately
died. In connection with him the letter C is given, the
260 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
names Black or Blackburn and Crossley, and another name
beginning with L, which is said to sound like Limiton.
The letter C may be accounted for as a reference to
Cheltenham, Canon Parker having been at the time of his
association with Mr. Irving Curate-m-Charge of Leckhamp-
ton, which is a district of Cheltenham. Limiton is prob-
ably a first attempt at Leckhampton, which emerges more
clearly at the next sitting. The names Black or Black-
burn and Crossley had no meanmg for Mr. Irving in
connection with Canon Parker.
At the next sitting on January 25, 1923, the communi-
cator passes from an attempt to give some name by which
she herself was called to attempts at two names beginning
with L, one of which is said to be "a bit longer than the
other." There can be little doubt, I think, that one of
the two names at which the communicator is aiming is
Leckhampton, at which, as I have suggested, a previous
attempt had been made on January 23. The first syllable
Leek is given repeatedly and with emphasis, and Feda gets
as near to the sound of the whole word as " Leckton
"
and " Leckan." With regard to this name it is said that
the matter is " not finished with yet," something further
is to hapjien which will be of interest in this connection,
and the communicator will try to help. It is worth
noting that in the course of her apparent attemj)ts at
Leckhampton Feda wrote the name " Lacey " and after it
the words better Feda," which seem to indicate that
Lacey is a " good shot." Moreover, she states almost
immediately afterwards " she's got it down once," which
seems to imply that one of the names written is correct.
But Lacey bears little resemblance to Leckhampton, be-
yond the fact that both begin with an L. This point is of
some interest in view of the sequel. What this sequel was
is indicated in a note written by Mr. Irving as follows :
On Saturday afternoon, Jan. 27, 1923, before leaving
Paddington by the 3.15 ]3.m. train, I bought at the book-
stall on the departure platform the Daily Mail, a Magazine,
and The Guardian to read on the journey. At home I
take in The Church Tivies only of the weekly church
papers, but on my return journeys from town I sometimes
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 261
buy The Guardian instead, as my copy of The Church
Times is awaiting me when I get back. The last time
before this when I may have done so would be Nov. 18,
1922. I had not bought The Guardian since nor had I
seen one so far as I know. I at once looked to see if
the name of our old friend and vicar. Canon [Parker] was
in the Obituary Column. It was not. On reading through
the paper I came to a letter by Canon [Parker] on the
subject of the New Lectionary.
^ ^ Irving
In the light of this subsequent development Mr. Irving
concluded that what the communicator was endeavouring
to say at the sittings of January 23 and 25 was that
Canon Parker, with whom he had for some time been
quite out of touch, would very shortly be brought to his
notice, as ho in fact was by the letter in The Guardian,
the statement that Canon Parker was dead being a mis-
take on the part of Feda. Mr. Irving suggests that the
repeated references to a name beginning with the syllable
Leek cover attemjjts to allude not only to Leckhampton
but also to Lectionary, the subject of Canon Parker's
letter in The Guardian. Mr. Irving may be right on this
point, but it is one which must remain conjectural. It is
rather against his theory that one of the few indications
given in regard to these two names is that one is "a bit
longer than the other." Of the names Leckhampton and
Lectionary neither has any marked advantage, the first
having eleven letters and three syllables, the second four
syllables but only ten letters.
On the other hand, a closer examination of the contents
of The Guardian of January 26, 1923, the number contain-
ing Canon Parker's letter, does suggest that it is from this
source that some light on the statements made at the
sittings of January 23 and 25 may be obtained. It will
be remembered that in connection with the man who has
" passed over quite lately " the name Crossley was given.
A short passage from the sitting of January 23, 1923, may
be quoted again :
" ... The name begiiming Cross, Crossley, I'm not
quite sure of this, but it sounded like Crossley, is
262 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
linked up with it too. That name seems to be
important, Mr. Bill, Cross, Crossley, Crus, Crosslan.
Dora says, " This man has only passed over quite,
quite lately."
In The Guardian of January 26, 1923, the first of four
" In Menioriam " notices records the death of " Charles
Crosslegh," for many years Vicar of Bradnuach in Devon,
and after his retirement " a familiar and honoured figure
in the cathedral and city of Exeter." It seems at least
possible that where Feda went astray was in attaching the
idea of recent death to the man identified as Canon
Parker, whereas it should have been attached to the name
" Crossley." It may further be suggested that the reason
why the name Crossley was given rather than another as
an indication of the contents of The Guardian was that
Charles Crosslegh, like Canon Parker, is associated with the
County of Devon. The place where Canon Parker now
lives is at no great distance from Exeter.
Another point suggesting that at the sittings of January
23 and 25, 1923, there was an attempt to indicate the
contents of The Guardian of January 26, is that printed
in large type at the head of the contents sheet in this
number of The Guardian are the words " Concerning a
Fact of Nature. By T. A. Lacey," this contribution being
apparently in the nature of a " special article." It will
be remembered that the name Lacey was written at the
sitting of January 25, 1923, and emphasised by the words
" better Feda." It is at least an odd coincidence that of
the names given at these sittings two names otherwise
unaccounted for, namely, Crosslegh and Lacey, appear
prominently in the copy of The Guardian bought by Mr.
Irvmg on January 27, and containing Canon Parker's letter.
The only name given on January 23, 1923, which remains
quite unexplained is "Black" or "Blackburn." On
March 9, 1923, Miss Newton addressed the following ques-
tions to Mr. Irving, to which he replied on March 10 :
(1) When did you last see or hear of Canon \Parker'] ?
Ansioer. So far as I can remember the last time I saw
Canon [Farktr^ was i]i Gloucester in the spring or summer
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 263
of 1921. A few weeks later I heard that he had left the
Diocese. I don't know when I last heard of him, but
not for months. I am out of touch noAv with Leck-
hampton where we worked together.
(2) Is it true that " at one time he used to talk to you
a lot and . . . advise you, and that you and he wouldn't
always agree . . . but . . . his position and age made it
almost impossible for you to stand up and disagree with
him " ; and that " he was the cause, or part of the cause
of a disappointment to you, a set-back to you " ?
Answer. Yes. The description here was so accurate that
there was no doubt at all in my mind who was being
spoken of. Canon {Parher'] was very democratic in views,
in touch with modern thought, keen on furthering re-union
with Nonconformists, etc. On many points I was not
myself in sympathy with his outlook, as I am naturally
conservative-minded. On the other hand he was my Vicar,
a Canon of Gloucester, and one of the most important
men in the Diocese. I had a strong personal admiration
for him, and my position as liis Assistant Curate made it
necessary for me not to put forward my own opinions.
Canon [Parl-e.r] must have been about twenty-five years my
senior. At one time he was the cause of a disapisointment
to me, for he refused to recommend me for a particular
post that I was anxious to get. We have always under-
stood, however, that later on he recommended me for my
present benefice, and I am surprised that this was not
mentioned instead of the disappointment.
(3) Does Feda's description of Canon [Parker'] remind you
of any one else, " some one who has passed over since
your last sitting " ?
Answer. No.
Mr. living's statement (see his note above on p. 261)
that to the best of his knowledge lie had not seen a,ny
number of The Ouardian since November 18, 1922, is of
some importance in view of the fact that letters from
Canon Parker on the subject of the New Lectionary
appeared in the issues of January 5 and 19, 1923, as well
as in the issue of January 26, 1923.

CHAPTER III.
Picture-Tests.
The particular typo of evidence with which I am con-
cerned in this chaj)ter is one which, so far as I am
aware, is peculiar to Mr. Irving's sittings ; at any rate no
incidents of quite the same kind have been reported to
us by other sitters. The evidence has been obtained
mainly in sittings with Mrs. Leonard, but before describing
any of these picture-tests, as they are called, in detail it
will be of interest to quote a short extract from a sitting
Mr. Irving has recently had with another medium, Mrs.
Warren Elliott, not only because this extract affords some
evidence of supernormal knowledge, but principally because
it suggests a personal link between these picture-tests and
the particular communicator from whom they purport to
come, i.e. Mr. Irving's wife ; it suggests, I mean, that
the picture-tests are " in character."
Extract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Warren Elliott,
November 18, 1924.
Sitter and Recorder : Rev. W. S. Irving.
(After an excellent description of the communicator's
character, Mrs. Warren Elliott continued :)
Mrs. W. E. Was she in some ways almost childish ?
W. S. I. No, certainly not.
Mks. W. E. Well, I want to tell you what she shows me. I
feel I want to play with picture puzzles, bricks.
I want to play Avith them. [She says :]
" I have
proved to you since my crossing I am still in-
terested in picture puzzles, though in a much
more sacred and helpful way."
Note by Mr. Irviyig.
My wife and I used at one time to go in largely in our
spare time for trying to solve puzzles in Tit-Bits, Answers,
etc. It was not merely an amusement, we were very
99] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 2fi5
poor at the time, and large prizes were offered for correct
solutions. IVty wife was much better at, and keener on,
these things than I was. I liave ah^ays considered her
skill at giving tests a proof of identity, but I had never
connected, consciously, tUl now her "picture-tests" given
through ]VIrs. Leonard, with a special type of j)icture puzzle
she was fond of. In these picture puzzles you had to
find the names of towns or stations, etc. from a picture
—for instance, take a simple illustration. A Imight in
armour crossing a bridge would be Knightsbridge."
About 60 of these would be given, most of them very
difficult to interpret, and valuable prizes awarded to those
who were most successful in elucidating the puzzles. In
the "picture-tests" I have been getting through Mrs.
Leonard a picture is described more or less in detail and
I am told that I shall " see this picture " or " be shown
this picture " almost immediately. I have now had a
large number of these tests. I had three more on the
day after this sitting. Most of these pictures are seen as
described, though not quite all, and a few are too inde-
finite, also, for certainty.
It does not seem possible that IVIrs. EUiott should nor-
mally know about these. She does not Imow my real
name, and only three have so far been published of these
tests—in the S.P.R. Journal for November, 1921.
The only other point which it seems desirable to record
before passing on to the tests themselves is that Mr. and
Mrs. Irving, being both of them much interested in drama,
had been in the habit for some years before Mrs. Irving's
death, of visiting the cinema together, this being the only
form of dramatic entertainment easily available in the
country parish where Mr. Irving lives. This habit Mr.
Irving stUl keeps up.
It is worth noting that the first attempt at anything in
the nature of a picture-test occurred at Mr. Irving's first
sitting with Mrs. Leonard on January 25, 1921, at which
time he was still anonymous to Mrs. Leonard. This case,
of which a full account will be found in the S.P.R.
Journal (Vol. XX. pp. 153 ff.) may be regarded as forming
26G Mrs. W. H. Salfer. [part
a kind of transition between book-tests and picture-tests.
The picture, subsequently identified as the one to which
reference was intended at the sitting, was found in a book,
The Ci'imson Tide, from which a book-test was given at
the same sitting, and so far as that part of the evidence
goes, the incident might well be classified as a book-test.
But the communicator also emphasised the circumstance
that at a place identified at the time of the sitting as the
S.P.R. Rooms at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., Mr.
Irving would subsequently have his attention called to a
picture which would have a special meaning for him in
connection with what had been said at this sitting. The
communicator's words as given by Feda were :
" Your
attention will be drawn to a picture ... I am going
to make you look at a picture, and there will be some-
thing that will seem a link to you, will have a mean-
ing for you, and you will know I told you beforehand."
This statement was apparently verified on February 1,
1921, when the Secretary, Miss Newton, whilst discussing
with Mr. Irving the record of his sitting on January 25,
1921, called his attention to a picture in The Crimson Tide,
suggesting that it had a significance in connection with the
book-test given at that sitting which Mr. Irving had
hitherto overlooked. This allusion to a future event which
the communicator claims that she is able in some way to
influence distinguishes the incident from the normal type
of book-tests and brings it into line with the series of
picture-tests, subsequently given at Mr. Irving's sittings,
several of which I shall now describe.
The first picture-test proper, apart from the transitional
incident quoted above, occurred at Mr. Irving's third
sitting on June 8, 1921. This incident has also been
reported in the Journal (Vol. XX. p. 168), but it seems
worth while to repeat it here :
§1. "The Devil's Claim."
Extract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
June 8, 1921.
Feda. And then she [communicator, Mr. Irving's wife] says :
" I want you to know you're going to see a picture
Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 267
soon that will remind you of me in my earth life.
I'll influence matters so that you're sure to see it.
I did before, you know." . . . [Note 1.]
[After a digression to another matter Feda returns to the
subject of this 'picture.']
What ? You're going with her where ? To see some
pictures ? Perhaps he doesn't like pictures ! She
says she's going with you to see some pictures, many
pictures. As if you're going to be in a place soon
Avhere there are a lot of pictures. Not in Psychical
'Searchers' rooms. No ! Different kind of place
altogether. Because there's something there she
wants to make you look at there, a picture, that,
when you see it, will remind you of the sitting to-
day, of the fact of her coming to you. She"ll be
able to impress you immediately to look at the right
one. There'll only be one that will fit it. [Note 2.]
Notes by Mr. Irving.
(1) During my visit to town I stayed with Mr. and IVIrs.
Whitehead, the father and mother of the communicator.
On coming down to brealifast on the morning of June 9,
the day after the sitting, I found the brealdast-room
empty, and, while waiting for the others to come down,
saw a large cabinet photograph of my wife on the mantel-
shelf. No mention had been made to me of this photo-
graph on this visit, though two months before Mrs. White-
head had told me that she believed she had one somewhere
that I might not have seen before. She had found it on
the previous day, during my absence at the sitting, and
placed it where I found it for me to see. It had been
taken nearly thirty years before.
(2) On Thursday evening, June 9, getting back from
town earlier than I expected, I went into a Cinema, the
one almost next door to the " Hippodrome " at Catford.
The second film shown was " 'The Devil's Claim,' featuring
Sessue Hayakawa." One scene was of a man visiting a
"seer," apparently a female trance-medium. The sitting
was shown on the film ; medium on a sofa, apparently in
268 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
trance, sitter, but no notetaker. There was also what
appeared to be a semi-materialisation. I had not looked
to see what films were being shown before going, nor could
anything of a spiritualistic nature have been suggested to
me by the posters, had I looked at them. I went round
next day to see. I had read no review of this film, and
believe it was the first day it was shown there, Thursday.
It was apparently American in origin. Though frequently
I go to Cinemas, I cannot recall having seen before any
sitting shown so stronglj^ resembling in certain points an
ordinary trance-sitting.
Mr. Irving has sent us corroborative statements from
Mrs. Whitehead, and from the Manageress of the Cinema,
but it does not appear necessary to jirint these statements
here. They bear out what Mr. Irving has said in all
essentials, and in particular the statement from the
Manageress confirms his impression that the film in ques-
tion, " The Devil's Claim," was shown at that particular
Cinema for the first time on June 9, 1921, the day of Mr.
Irving' s visit.

Feda. That's about the book-tests, but she got another one
that she thinks of in connection with the book-tests,
but you couldn't quite call it that. It's a picture-
test. You have to show it more plainly, Dora.
Yellow, gold, yellow, gold, looks like the sun. A
picture suggesting yellow, gold, looks like the sun.
Like a large, brightly coloured, then she says
aggressive sun. Do you mean a boy ? No ! A sun !
Do you see ? Do you understand that ? I don't
know if this is a picture of the sun, but it looks
like it. Close to, and partly, if not entirely, round
the sun spikes, lines, bars, are lines and bars of
unequal length. White, white, white splashes, or
lumps of something on the lower part of the ])icture.
A man in old-fashioned dress, not a young man.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 269
ail elderly man in very old-fashioned dress, such as
one doesn't see now at all—seem to be doing some-
thing with his hand. What she's doing look to
Peda as if he was catching hold of something like
that. His hand, not flat to him. Do you see, Mr.
Bill, he's holding it out a bit ? There's a little
lesson to read from this picture, rather interesting,
she says, " But while I was looldng at it I was
rather confused as to whether it was two pictures
touching each other, or close to each other, or
whether it was all part of the same picture." She
say, " You can understand what I mean, can't
you ?
"
W. S. I. Yes.
F. You can understand that if you was looking at two
pictures close together under rather difficult condi-
tions, not seeing them very easily, you might easily
take them for one. Station, station, seem to get
the word station, the idea of station, as if picture
connected with the word station. She says, Mr.
Bill, she doesn't want yo\i to go looking for it, she
can make somebody show it to you like she did
before—soon. Perhaps they [recorder has " you "]
won't be aware they're showing it, or doing it, but
she says, " I shall be responsible."
W. S. I. She's a marvel, Feda !
F. (DraA^'s in the air a figure something like a horizontal
T.) Wait just a minute. She says, " Feda will
have to take this in my words. There's something
holy, something suggesting the Cross Avhich you'll be
reminded of same time as the picture. A reminder
of holy things, something to do with sacrifices too,
sacrifice and leaves, and leaves, green leaves. Stone,
stone, coming a long Avay round, long way round,

270 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PABT
Note by Mr. Irving.
On. the afternoon of the day on which tJiis sitting took
])lace I walked down to Hunter Street to try to book a
sitting with Mr. Vout Peters for September. The person
who came to the door told me that Mr. Peters was en-
gaged and that it was impossible to disturb him, but if
I cared to wait he might not be long before he could see
me. After waiting in a front room for about half an
hour, Mr. Peters hurried in, followed by three people who
had apparently been having a sitting. He seemed sur-
prised to find me waiting, but barely pausing to say " Sit
down a moment," strode across the room, and pointed to
a picture in a corner which I had not noticed, saying,
"These are the Ikons." Afterwards he showed us another
Ikon in another part of the room which he called the
" Veronica " head. It represented the head of our Blessed
Lord as traditionally said to have been found imprinted
on St. Veronica's handkerchief. On examining the first
Ikon shown I found that it closely corresponded with the
description given through Mrs. Leonard of the picture that
I was soon to be shown. (See Plate I.) The Ikon was not
large, approximately 10| inches by 8-|. It rei^resented a
full-length figure of St. Vladimir who first introduced
Christianity into Russia. The Saint is depicted as wearing
a crown and long flowing robes. Round his head is a halo
as big as a penny, the golden rays of the halo are shorter
at the sides than they are above the head of the Saint.
St. Vladimir is represented as holding up in his hands a
cross. The colouring of the groundwork of the picture
round the Saint is gold, except at the base. In the back-
ground are clifi^s and green trees. Immediately round the
picture itself, inside the frame, is a strij) of brown tm with
some yellow markings on. The colour of the wall-paper
lias been white with red roses, but the roses have faded in
colour and are now almost white—blotchy white. The
Saint in apjoearance is elderly, he has a grey beard, and
the style of his robes is of the type that one so often
sees in coloured ])aintings of our Blessed Lord and His
disciples. In a sense these Ikons may be said to be two

pictures in one, as I am told that the ])icture projier is
first painted and then a large part of it is overlaid ^itli
gold. They resemble closel}^ in appearance
Stations of the Cross. I had onlv once before this been
to Mr. Vout Peters' house, on April 18 last, for a sitting
which took place in the study at the back of the house.
I remember that there were some Ikons in that room
which I noticed then ; and I have thouglit since that it
is quite likely that I may have been shown those in the
front room also, after the sitting. The picture of St.
Vladimir, however, when seen this time, did not bring
back to me any recollection at the time of my having
seen it before, nor am I sure that I went into the front
room at all then. ... I had told no one but Mr. Ding-
wall that I thought of calling there to boolc another
sitting on that day. The pseudonym that I have given
to Mr. Peters is not one that I have used elsewhere.
Mrs. Leonard knows my identity now.
The following corroborative statement was received from
Mr. Vout Peters, contained in a letter to Miss Newton :
15.8.23.
On Friday, the 10th of August, 1923, at between 4 and
5, I invited a party of people, two ladies and one gentle-
man, to see some Russian Ikons I had in a general
sitting-room I have in my house. I had been giving
them a seance in my seance room, and after the seance
they had admired some beautiful Ikons I have there.
Hence the invitation to the sitting-room. When I entered
the sitting-room I saw there a clergyman who had been
to see me once before, whose name I do not know. I
asked him if he would care to inspect the Ikons ; to do
so he had to cross the room, as he could not see the one
I showed him where he was sitting. I did not know he
was coming and he never has been in the room before. . . .
Alfred Vout Peters.
With reference to Mi-. Vout Peters' statement that Mr.
Irving had never been in the room before, Mr. Irving-
wrote to me on October 25, 1923, as follows :
272 Mrs. W. II. Salter. [part
When I wa« in tuwii last Miss Newton rcail to ine Vout
Peters' statement on the case. He says in it that I had
never seen the Ikon before. I don't feel satisfied about
this. In my statement I say I think it quite lilvely that
I had. It is impossible now to be certain, but I still
think it likely that I may have seen it and forgotten it.
This does not diminish the value of the test owing to the
way it was brouglit off, as you will see when you read it.
W. S. Irving.
On November 23, 1923, Mr. Irving wrote a further note
on tlie case, as follows :
Additiojial Note to the Ikon Test.
After sending in my notes on this test I v^'as again
reading through the latter part of tlie script, when it
occurred to me that the words suggested that there was
something else to look for as well as the picture. "There's
something holy, something suggesting the Cross, which
you'll be reminded of same time . . . something to do
with sacrifices too, and leaves, green leaves. Stone, stone,
coming a long way round. ..." The following seems to
be applicable : Some time about the end of 1916 or
beginning of 1917, I had a letter from a lady in Norfolk,
whom I will call Mrs. X, asldng permission to imt a
Memorial to her son in my church at Oxenhall. The son
had been killed in the war. Her fiirst suggestion as to
the form the Memorial should take did not seem suitable
for our little church. It was ultimately decided that a
large granite cross, about 14 feet in height, and bearing
a figure of our Saviour in Sicilian marble, should be erected
outside the church. This, at Mrs. X's suggestion, was to
serve as a War Memorial for the Parish—not only for her
son ; and the names of all Parishionei's who sacrificed
their lives in the war were to be engraved thereupon.
The Memorial was made by a firm in the Euston Road,
brought down here, and dedicated by the Rural Dean at
a service which I conducted, on June 14, 1917. A lady
who was living with us at the time tried to take snap-
shots of the Dedication Ceremony ; these were not, how-
ever, very successful. . . . On looking recently at one of
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonanl. 273
these snapshots it struck me how very likely it is that
my communicator was reminded of this scene by the Ikon.
At the Dedication Ceremony there must have been a
distinct resemblance to the picture, the cross, and the
figure in ancient robes—myself wearing a cope, etc. Flowers
and leaves are continually placed at the foot of the cross
to-day by friends a.nd relations of those whose names are
inscribed thereon.
g Irving
In one of these snapshots, which Mr. Irving sent us,
the cross is seen, and in another (Plate II.) is the figure
of Mr. Irving wearing a long cope which has a general
resemblance to the priestly robe worn by St. Vladimir
in the picture. Mr. Irving adds that the communi-
cator, Mrs. Irving, was present when these snapshots
were taken. " I remember she told me that she tried
in vain to borrow the camera for a moment and take the
snapshots herself." The Ikon is also reproduced in order
that readers may judge for themselves how closely it cor-
responds to the description given at the sitting of August
10, 1923. The large " aggressive " sun can be clearly seen.
With regard to Mr. Irving's suggestion that the reference
to two pictures may be explained by the way in which
the Ikons are painted, it seems to me that it is rather
more likely to be due to a rather vague appreciation of
the fact that there was more than one Ikon in the room.
As will be seen by J\'Ir. Irving's note another Ikon was
actually shown by Mr. Peters to Mr. Irving and the other
persons jDresent, and he had in addition several other Ikons
in his seance room at which his sitters had just been
looking. The probabihty of this interpretation seems to
be strengthened by the reference to " station," which
immediately follows the allusion to seeing " two pictures
close together." The second Ikon shown to Mr. Irving-
was, he tells us, a representation of the " Veronica
"
Head, and the incident of St. Veronica is commonly
included amongst the " Stations of the Cross." On this
point Mr. Irving writes :
Most of our favourite churches have Stations of the
Cross, including one at whicli I was for a time Temporary
274 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
Assistant-Curate. Also my wife, when a girl, was at a
Roman Catholic School at one time. Stations of the
Cross were familiar things to her in Church worship, and
she liked them.
With reference to any possible suggestion of collusion
between Mrs. Leonard and Mr. Vout Peters, it is important
to note that Mr. Irving did not go to Mr. Peters' house
by appointment and only Mr. Dingwall knew of his in-
tention to go there.
§ 3. The House and Ship Case.
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, November 22, 1923.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs. Savy.
Fkda. Wait a minute, 'cos I've got to see what you're
showing as well as hearing. She's trying to show
me something, and she wants me to see it very
carefully before I say exactly what I think it is.
"A country lane," she says, "very bright green,
grass I suppose, each side of the lane, but some-
thing peculiar—this grass doesn't seem right, it seems
the wrong colour." But grass is green, Dora !
" Yes, I know, but wrong shade," she says. And
a white and scarlet house. That would be a nice
one ! In the background, yet showing up very
prominently in the picture.
W. S. I. Picture ?
F. Yes, you didn't tell him it was a picture ! " Yes,"
she says, " this is a picture, but I wanted Feda to
get the idea of it. It's so important to be exact."
She says as a matter of fact this is a picture she
feels you'll be seeing at once—she thinks to-night.
In an unexpected place—an unlikely place. She
wants you particularly to notice the shade of
green which she thinks is wrong. Now, Mr. Bill,
she doesn't know whether this she's going to tell
you is 071 the picture or close to—like round it,
black and white stripes—a series of black and Avhite
stripes. Is there a window near it, Dora ? She
put her hand out close to the picture, Dora did,
99] Sittings tvitJi Mrs. Leonard. 275
wlie felt as if «lic were toueliing a window. Siie
says, It miglit be a glass door, it struck me as a
window." Bron—Brun, and a word, she says, " I
suppose it's a name—was suggested to me by this
picture. It began with B. I seem to get a name
commencing with Bron or Brun. This, I hope,
you will understand too. Look for it carefully."
He always does ! She also felt—now how can I
describe that to him ? She says, "This may rather
amuse you." Close to this picture, in the near
assinity [sic) of the jDicture, something seemed to her
a dangerous place. Something could be very, very
dangerous. This feeling's very strong in her, Mr.
Bill, a dangerous place. She doesn't want you to
take it as a warning, or anything silly of that kind.
A warning isn't silly 1 A warning couldn't be !
But simply a test. This place of danger is con-
nected Avith noises. Any moment 3'ou might hear
startling noises ; but look for the picture first. She
says, " It's extraordinary how I can make you look
at the thing I mean sometimes." " But," she says,
" no, it's not extraordinary, because at home you
often answer directly to what I tell you." She says,
" You take my impressions wonderfully sometimes."
. . . Mr. Bill, you may not remember this at the
moment—have you been looking at a picture of a
ship lately ? Rather particularly looking at ships ?
W. S. I. I saw an advertisement of one this morning.
F. I do not think it is important, but she just got it
from your mind. You were a little impressed by
the picture of a ship. This was not just an adver-
tisement, but a jjicture of a ship. That's the right
one, Mr. Bill, but you going to look at one that
might easily be the duplicate of it to-night. Not the
same one, a similar looking ship, and, she says, " I
think it'll strike you as being similar at once."
Note by Mr. Irving.
In order that what follows may be fully understood I
must briefly sketch my movements during this week. On
7() Mrs. W. H. Sailer. [part
Tuesday, Nciv. 20, I Avas at the S.P.R. Rooms going
through soine notes with Miss Newton. I remarlved to
lier that I did wish I could see the film " One Exciting
Night " again, as I had a minor point to verify before the
" Noise " test could be i:)ublished, and I also wanted my
description of the film confirmed by a witness. On Tues-
day, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons I was occupied
with sittings. On Thursday evening I was looking for the
red and Avhite house. On Friday, having in the earlier
jiart of the day finished my week's work, I thought I
would have a few hours' recreation and take my sister-in-
law, Mrs. Savy, to a show. Arriving at our meeting-place
too early, and having to wait, I filled in the time by
walking to the Palace Theatre to see what was on there.
I found it was a film called " Down to the Sea in Ships."
This was illustrated by many pictures outside the theatre
of a large three-masted sailing-vessel with all sails set.
There were eleven pictures of this ship on one side only
of the theatre. This at once recalled to my mind a film,
either, I think, part 1 or part 2 of the serial, " Japhet in
Search of his Father," which I had seen a few weeks
previously at the " King's " Cinema, Gloucester. I re-
member the ship, because I was particularly struck at
the time with the beauty of the pictures of this ship in
full sail and thought how different modern ships look.
The ship I had thought of at the sitting was a three or
four-funnelled Atlantic liner. I had seen that advertised
at King's Cross Station ])vior to the sitting.
The " Palace " programme did not seem interesting, so
after dinner I suggested to Mrs. Savy that we should go
to the " Grange," Kilburn, as the music there is good.
I did not Imow what was on, but had seen earlier in the
week " Scandal " advertised there ; I thought probably it
would be still on. The piece proved to be " One Exciting
Night " —the one piece necessary for me to see if the
"Noise" test Avere to be published with my other tests.
After the show we walked to Brondesbury and Kilburn
Station. As I was getting our tickets Mrs. Savy said to
me, " Why, there's your red house !
" Hanging by the
right-hand side of the ticket-office window was a good-
99] Silfhtgs vjifh Mrs. Leonard. 277
sized picture of a red and white house, the liouse projier
being white, witli bright red roof and ciumneys. In the
foreground is a country lane with a stile leading onto a
road. Each side of the lane is bright blue grass. The
station is i?ro?Klesbury and Kilburn. About five or six
feet to the left of the picture hangs the Table of Fares,
in, of course, what look like black and white columns.
To the right and a little further off the Time-Table of
trains. (I am not sure which side is the Time-Table and
which the " Fares.'") This booking-ofiice is close to a
very dangerous crossing, Edgware Road, as the road is very
wide, there are no shelters half-way across, and it is at
the foot of a long slope doAvn which cars come very fast.
It is almost under the railwaj^ bridge across which electric
trains rattle every few minutes.
Later. I have discovered by looking back through last
week's Daily Mails that " One Exciting Night " was
advertised in that paper as being at " The Grange,"
Kilburn, in Thursday's and Saturday's issue. I myself
generally read the Daily Mail, though I believe I missed
it altogether on one day in the middle of the week, I
forget which. Being very busy, however, I had not time
to do more than skim through the paper. Certainly I did
not consciously read the advertisement column of announce-
ments on Thursday ; and I consider it unlikely that I can
subconsciously have noticed " One Exciting Night " adver-
tised at Kilburn. The print is small. I was also most
anxious to see the piece and could hardly have failed to
grasp it, had I read it.
I should like, if I may, to put forward a theory con-
cerning the events of this evening, Friday, November 23.
If I interpret what happened correctly, I think that it was
the intention of the controlling intelligence to make me
verify these tests on the previous evening; but owing prob-
ably to my mind being over active and on the look-out for
the red and white house, it proved impossible to impress
me where to go. On the Friday, however, when m}
week's researches were over, and I was allowing myself a
little relaxation, with a mind less occupied and strenuous,
the chance was given. I tliink I am justified in assuming
27S Mrs. ir. SaJtcr. [part
that t]ic8e tJux'c tests proving veridical one after another,
as they did, is beyond chance-eoincidence. If this intelli-
gence be my own subconscious mind, which I find it
difficult to beheve, it would seem to have the power to
see the sign-boards outside a theatre whicli T had not
been near ; to find out that a film necessary for me to
see as soon as possible Avas being shown at a Cinema
which I had also not passed during tliis visit to town
;
to describe, in very considerable detail, a picture which
I may or may not have seen before, but certainly liad
not for months, as I seldom pass Brondesbury ticket
office ; and finally to steer me by mental impression from
one place to another to verify three things in less than
six hours. Once before I had a somewhat similar ex-
perience of three supernormal veridical impressions in one
evening, but unfortunately in that case the material was
too personal for jiublication, and also there was no
witness.
November 26, 1923.
In reply to an enquiry from Miss Newton, Mr. Irving
stated in a letter dated January 3, 1924, that
Mrs. Leonai'd knows nothing of my movements when in
toAvn. To the best of my belief she has no knowledge
that I have ever been to Brondesbury or to the " Grange "
Cinema at Kilburn.
With reference to this statement I vi^rote to Mrs. Leonard
on January 21, 1925, asking her (1) whether she travelled
much on the London underground railways, (2) whether
she had been in recent years to Brondesbury and Kilburn
Station, (3) w^liether she had any reason to associate
Mr. Irving with Brondesbury. She replied as follows :
Jan. 23, 1925.
I have been once in my life to Brondesbury Station
about ten years ago, at least I think it was Brondesbury,
or Brondesbury Park. It is the station between Kilburn
and Cricklewood.
I hardly ever go on the Underground. I have not been
to Brondesbury or Kilburn Station since the time I went
99] Sittings ivifh Mrs-. Leonard. 279
in 1915—or late 1914. I have passed through Kilburn High
Street in a car occasionally, but never been in the station.
No. I have never associated Mr. Irving with these places,
nor heard him speak of them as far as I remember. . . .
Gladys Leonard.
Subsequently Mr. Irving made some further enquiries at
Kilburn Station, the result of which he communicated to
Miss Newton. She reports her conversation with Mr.
Irving as follows :
Sept. 18, 1924.
This morning Mr. Irving told me that he made
enquiries at Kilburn Station last night as to how long the
picture had been there. He was told by the ticket col-
lector that it had been there at least two years.
Mr. Irving remembers that about one and a half years
ago he had an appointment with some one outside the
station and had walked up and down at least a quarter
of an hour waiting. He thinks therefore that it is highly
probable that he must have seen this picture.
I. Newton.
To sum up the above incident : the four points to which
Mr. Irving' s attention was specially directed at the sitting
of November 22, 1923, were (1) a picture of a ship which
would remind him of another picture of a ship lately seen ;
(2) a picture of a red and white house with a lane and
grass of a colour which seemed unusual ; (3) a name
beginning with " Bron," and (4) associated with the picture
and the name a place described as dangerous and noisy.
All these points were verified during the evening of
Friday, November 23. It seems not unlikely that the
name " Bron " given at the sitting may have uncon-
sciously suggested Brondesbury to Mr. Irving, and this
possibility is strengthened by the fact that he had prob-
ably seen the picture of a house outside Brondesbury and
Kilburn Station some months before the sitting. The
name " Bron " and his own unconscious recollection of the
picture may have sufficed to turn his mind towards the
" Grange " Cinema at Kilburn, when casting about for a
possible explanation of the statements made at the sitting.
280 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [fart
These circumstances do not, however, account for his
apparently casual and accidental visit to the outside of
the " Palace " Cinema where he saw pictures of a sailing
ship and thereby verified another point in the test. Nor
do they afford any explanation of the statements made at
the sitting, which appear to be based upon a fairly exact
knowledge of ideas lying dormant in Mr. Irving's mind
and a consequent knowledge of what he might be likely
or might be easily persuaded to do. And therein, as it
seems to me, lies the special interest of these picture-tests.
They appear to be intelligent forecasts based upon (a) a
considerable knowledge of Mr. Irving's own thoughts and
circumstances, (6) some knowledge of the thoughts of other
persons, and (c) in some cases direct clairvoyance.
Whether these supernormal powers are to be attributed
to Mrs. Leonard herself, or to Feda, or to the supposed
communicator is a question which must, I think, be de-
termined according to the general nature of the evidence
obtained through Mrs. Leonard's mediumship ; such tests
as these do not in themselves afford strong evidence of
personal identity, although, as is shown by the extract
given from the sittmg with Mrs. Warren Elliott, they are
of a type which might readily suggest itself to a person
of this particular communicator's turn of mind.
In regard to the above statement Mr. Irving wrote to
me on January 19, 1925 :
Your comment in the Ship and House Test as to the
nature of the Dkecting Intelligences was anticipated by
my communicator on April 19, 1923. I think her words
are worth recording
:
D. G. I. Isn't it funny I can lead you to things at times ?
It shows I've power with j^ou apart from the
sitting. They surely wouldn't think it was the
directing mind of the medium, would they ? Have
they thought she might be giving a sitting while
you're looking, so she couldn't be directing your
mind. No ! Its just the hapjiy, happy truth I'm
witli you and just getting things through in the best
way I can, just enough to remind you I'm there.

Sitter: Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder: Mrs. Dingwall.
Feda. Could you show me what that is ? A creek, a river
winding ? Mr. Bill, she showing me a picture of a
r-r-river, a narrow, narrow river. Up the side of the
river is trees and like scener}^ country scenery, not
a river in a town. And, she sa^'s, it's a picture
that you're going to look at almost immediately ;
and which is very much like one that j^ou have at
home, which is not a fancy picture, but a—wait a
bit—What 'i Wait a minute. A picture of a place
you and Dora been together to. She says that the
river part of it will not be stamped on your mind
so particularly. I'm only describing that to you
because it's in both pictures. The pictures are not
copies of each other, but they're very like. [Notel.]
[Feda then gave another picture-test of an old man in
a curious dress, which was said to be also one that
I should see "very, very soon" and of which it was
said it " also has a duplicate at home " and " It's
that that interests me." There was a picture in
" The Eternal City " (see note below ) that somewhat
resembled the picture described, and that in one or
two points reminded me of a picture at home, but
was not definite or clear enough in detail to be
evidential. W. S. I.]
F. Oh, what's those 'I Are they steel things, long things
that sticks ? I don't think he would be going to
such a place ! Mr. Bill.
\\. S. I. Yes 1
F. Wonder if yoii be going to a place where there are
swords. That Avouldn"t be nice ! What Dora calls
"weapons." Dora has such a strong feeling of you
in a place where there are swords, and weapons.
I go slowly ! And she says, " Put this : both old
and new." " Old and new " is important, she says.
She says, " I feel there will be two swords in a
prominent position. That is what I would like you
2S2 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
to 'member," she says. Why is it dark in that
place, Dora ? While she's trying to show me that,
I have a feeling, an impression, of shade and dark-
ness. Yes, yes, that's right. Wait ! She says,
" Want you to remember that." She says 'tis im-
portant. [Note 2.]
Notes by Mr. Irving.
(1) The sitting ended at about 5 p.m. On the way to the
station I remarked to the note-taker that I was reminded
of the Lake District and that I thought that perhaps we
might see the picture next da> at Mrs. Brittain's. I had
a sitting booked with her and I believed there were some
pictures of the Lake District in a room there. My reason
for mentioning the Lake District was that Feda'e description
had reminded me of two holidays that my wife and I had
spent, in 1901 and 1902, at the English Lakes, where there
are many narrow, woody rivers. We took a camera with
us in 1902, and the particular snapshot of which I was
thinking as answering to the description was one that I
still have, of Stock Ghyll Force, near Ambleside. About
an hour and a half after the sitting, I went into King's
Cross Cinema without knowing anything about what pic-
tures were being shown, save that I saw outside the door
that " The Eternal City " was billed. The Pathe Pictorial
contained views of the Lake District. There were three
pictures showing the little rivers of the district. I take
it that the statement given through Feda that "the river
part of it will not be stamped on your mind " was made
because in my picture at home there is hardly any water.
In summer these little " becks " become often nearly dry.
At the Cinema there was more water shown.
(2) The comedy shown at the King's Cross Cinema was
called " Don Quickshot of the Rio Grande." In the earlier
scenes Don Quixote in armour is shown, mounted on a
horse. Galloping up to an old gateway he thrusts at the
gate-keeper with his lance, which is, I think, shivered by
tlie ])low. Drawing a long sword, he hastens to the rescue
of a lady in distress, smiting vigorously ; and with his
sword spits two people at once. The scene then changes
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 283
from ancient times to modern. Don Quixote becomes Don
Quickshot. An American cowboy has been dreaming of
doing heroic deeds like j)eople in the past. You see him
practising shooting with the long bow. Later, in a house,
a man draws a bowie-knife, and throws it at the back of
Don Quickshot. I gather that another man was transfixed
instead, for in the later scenes Don Quickshot is being
pursued by the Sheriff. I have only once before been to
the King's Cross Cinema.
Mr. Irving sent us a confirmatory statement from Mrs.
Dingwall in regard to his conversation with her whilst
walking to the station after the sitting and a programme
of the King's Cross Cinema, which shows that on April
28, 29, and 30, 1924, the pictures shown included " Don
Quickshot of the Rio Grande " and " The Eternal City."
The Pathe Pictorial is mentioned on the programme, but
there is no indication as to the nature of the pictures
included in this section.
Mr. Irving also sent us his snapshot of Stock Ghyll
Force, Avhicli shows a narrow white ribbon of water
heavily shadowed by trees.
§ 5. Eating Fruit.
Extract from Sitting ivith Mrs. Leonard, July 29, 1924.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mi's. Dingwall.
FjiDA. She says, " Do you remember a silly little thing I
told you with regard to fruit ? ^ You're going to
be reminded of that in a picture almost immediately."
She says, " I think quite quickly, within twenty-four
hours." She says, " It will be quite a definite thing,
an unmistakable thing, that you'll be forced to look

She means something by that, Mr. Bill. I can tell
when she means a little more than she can say.

Note by Mr. Irving.
I tried a new plan this time. In order that my com-
municator might know what my movements immediately
after the sitting would be, I made a programme for
myself, before leaving home, as to what entertainments 1
would go to on the evening after the sitting and the
following evening. I chose the " Pavilion " Cinema at
Shepherd's Bush for the Tuesday (July 29), and the
Shepherd's Bush Empire (Varieties) for the Wednesday.
I had no knowledge beforehand what pictures would be
shown at the Pavilion Cinema, and was careful not to look
at the advertisements. This programme I kept to. On
Monday evening, July 28, 1924, the day before the sitting,
I went to the " Grange " Cinema at Kilburn, and saw a
film called " Fashion Row," featuring Mae Murray. On
Tuesday morning, July 29, I received a ' note from Miss
Newton asking me to send another copy of the "16 im-
pressions Tests." By this letter I was reminded of the
" Fruit Test " which was one of the sixteen. After the
sitting I went to the Pavilion Cinema, according to plan,
and did not discover till I got inside that the film which
had just started was " Fashion Row " which I'd seen only
the night before. I thought it best, however, to sit
through it as I was there, and not to change what I had
arranged to do. Half-way through the piece I found that
I was looking at a picture in which Mae Murray, as one
of the heroines, was looking after a fruit stall ; she sells,
or gives, a banana to a young man who asks for some,
and then gets a largo bunch of bananas to sell. I had
of course seen this incident the night before, but not
knowing that the subject of fruit was to come up, had
forgotten it. After the performance I bought an Evening
Ncvjs to see, if I could, in what percentage of cinemas
this particular film was being shown. I found that
" Fashion Row " Avas advertised in seven out of the
t'wenty-four.
One may suppose that the communicator's statement
that Mr. Irving Avill be forced to look at the picture in
question, tliat "it's almost looking for" him, is an allusion
99] Sitting•'s with Mrs. Leonard. 285
to the fact that it was to be brought to his notice twice
over on consecutive nights. As Mr. Irving mentions in
his note, it had actually been brought to his notice on
the night before the sitting, but not recognised by him
at the time as having any interest or significance.
When I read a report on these picture-tests at a meet-
ing of the Society on February 5, 1925, a question was
raised as to the extent to Avhich the tests could be regarded
as att'ording evidence of the communicator's identity. On
this point Mr. Irving subsequently wrote to me as follows :
Feb. 16, 1925.
In addition to the points you then mentioned there is
the claim made in some of the tests that they are like
pictures " at home." (This was said with regard to the
"Battle" and "Narrow River " ^ ]iicture-tests.) Or "will
remind you very strongly of the Church at home." Or
" also has a duplicate at home." . . .
I doubt if this point has been made enough of, probably
because the best of these rese}nblances do not occur in the
picture-tests which are most striking. The claim, however,
seems to be correct in nearly every case—in one I am not
quite certain.
The other picture-tests, although it is not stated so in
the script, were found to be like pictures at home, or in
some way connected Avith places in which my wife was
interested.
W. S. Irving.
CHAPTER IV.
Miscellaneous Incidents.
I WILL conclude this part of my paper by recording three
incidents which do not fall into any of the classes pre-
viously considered. In the case of the first, and most
striking, of these incidents the source of the information
given at the sitting may be the communicator's memory
of facts known to her during her lifetime. The last two
incidents cannot be so explained, since they appear to
^ Seo nhnvo, p. 2SI, .
286 3Ir.s. W. H. Salter. [part
involve knowledge of events which have occurred since the
communicator's death. They differ from the incidents re-
corded in Chapter I., in that the relevant facts were
known to the sitter. In the third incident there seems
to be an attempt to refer to a certain recent event
through two mediums. (For another example of this,
taken from Mr. Irving's sittings, see S.P.R. Journal,
Vol. XXI. pp. 104 ff.)

"
W. S. 1. I don't know.
F. She says, " I think yon have." She's showing nie this
very plainly. Mr. Bill, it's not a straight piece of
lace—not straight, rather curved, as if it were made
a shape ; and it's got a pattern on it. It isn't,
but it looks abuost like, the shape of a daisy, and
then there is a sort of pattern.
W. S. I. Can you draw it ?

you about it. Oh, has he '(

it, not to wear it. You wouldn't look nice in it.
She says, " You've got a very good picture of it,"
she says, " a very good picture of it." She says,
" I don't mean a photo of it." She doesn't mean
she was photographed in the collar.
W. S. I. Oh, I thought she did.
F. But something you've still got of hers, looks to Feda
like a book, and there's a picture looldng exactly

calling it a book, it's not exactly a book. Well, it
looks like one, ]\Irs. Dora ! She says, " Well, Feda
can call it a book, and the description will do, but
it's a very thin book. You've got it at home and
the patterns are with it."
W. S, T. I know it.i
F. She thinks you will, but she says it might be a
reproduction of the collar, so wonderfully exact ; but
also on the outside of the same book—she says,

it, are some remarks about schools and classes. Have

this book, in fact I did use it, a little while
before I passed over. You must have seen it lying

it, but, she says, it's not where you keep books

Notes by Mr. Irving.
(1) I have found a lace collar that I think is the one
intended on a dress of my wife's which was hanging in a
wardi'obe behind other things. If this be the collar meant,
Feda is not correct in saying that it is not a straight
piece of lace, for it is ; but it does not look so, because
it is sewn onto the collar of the dress. From the back
of the dress it looks just like the shape drawn by Feda,
Sitlings wiih Mrs. Leonard. 289
but this is illusionarv. The lace goes ovei' the sliuulders,
and down tlie front of tlie dress in a V-shai>e. That the
communicator knew tliis, though Feda did not, is, I think,
shown by the sentence the stitches have come undone
near the front corner," I found a slit, a tear, in the
lace in the jolace indicated, one and a half inches in
length. This was not in my conscious mind, but whether
I have ever known about it, it is not possible now to find
out. The pattern of the lace is called, I find, the
" Shamrock pattern." The lace is three inches in depth,
but only about two inches is visible on the collar, as the
upper part is turned over and stitched inside the dress.
The lace was made by my wife herself, who made many
lace things. Feda's statement that she " didn't get it
from a place close to " may refer to the silk or to the
pattern from which the collar was made.
After a hunt I found a picture of it on the cover of
Needlecraft, No. 21. This and several other copies of
Needlecraft, I found among a pile of papers in a room that
I do not now use myself. I often saw my wife studying
Needlecrafi in life, but it is doubtful if I have ever come
across this particular number since her death. " Mi'S.
Irving " was written in pencil on the cover in my wife's
handwriting. The pattern on Needlecraft, No. 21, is an
exact reproduction of the lace on the collar. There are a
number of other patterns also of lace in Needlecraft, which
is a thin magazine with paper covers published by the
Manchester School of Embroidery and., containing about 15
pages in each number. I had no conscious knowledge that
a pattern of lace made by my wife was either on the
dress or on the cover of the book, though I must have
seen the lace on the collar and seen it made. The " slit
"
is not visible unless the collar is closel}^ examined.
(2) From the description something of the nature of
Weldoji's Journal seemed indicated. An exhaustive hunt,
however, failed to bring to light any magazine of that
kind. There was also this difficulty that the " cutting-
out book " was said to have been used a good deal by
my wife, whereas fashion books are continually changing,
nor could I recall having seen my v.ife make frequent use

"
I could call to mind were recipes for cooking which many
years ago my wife used to collect and ]:)aste into a book.
It seemed highly doubtful if the book still existed, and
there seemed to be little to be gained by looking for it,
for it was not likely to be illustrated with ladies' dresses.
I hunted for it, however, and found on Christmas Day two
of these cookery books on an upper shelf in a kitchen
cupboard, covered with dust. They had clearly not been
moved for a very long time. The first had a dark red
cover, but had inside only recipes written out in my
wife's handwriting. The second was a brown-covered
exercise-book, stained with red. On the front cover were
the words "The St. Paul's Exercise Book." On the back
cover were arithmetical tables. The words " middle-class
cookery " occur at the top of six pages in the book, which
consists of cookery cuttings apparently cut out of various
papers and jDasted in. I could not find any connection
with Jadies' dresses in the book, till I thought of examin-
ing the backs of the cuttivgs, when I found illustrations of
ladies' dresses, both with and without " ladies inside them,"
and also diagrams for " cutting out." They must have
huen taken from some fashion paper of long ago, probably
near the beginning of the century, as they are decidedly
old-fashioned.
W. S. Irving.
Mr. Irving also sent us the following confirmatory
statement :
December 30, 1923.
I have this day compared the illustration of Irish crochet
lace on the cover of the magazine, Needlecrafi, No. 21,
with a lace collar on a dress belonging to Mrs. Irving and
certify that this lace collar appears to be an exact copy
of the illustration. A tear about 1| inches in length
appears about two inches from the bottom of the collar
viewed from the front.
R. R. Farmer.
I have also myself seen a photograph of the lace collar
in whicli the shamrock pattern and the tear are distinctly
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 291
visible, and Mr. Irving sIkjwxmL luc tlic copy of Nccdlecrafl
,
No. 21, with Mrs. Irving's name written at the top. It
is to be observed that the statement made at the sitting
that the name of a great friend of Mrs. Irving's was on
the cover is incorrect. The name was Mrs. Irving's own.
I have also seen the cookery book to which Mr. Irving-
refers and the representations of ladies' dresses which
appear on the back of some of the cuttings pasted into
the book. It will be noted that the book is first referred
to by Feda as " the cutting book, the old cutting book
with the diagrams in." This would have been, so far as
it goes, a correct description of the book. The further
amplification " cutting-out book " was apparently a mis-
take. The statement that the cover is red is also wrong ;
this may be due either to confusion with the other cookery
book found with it, or to an impression of the red splashes
on the brown cover. The reference to "remarks about
schools and classes," though not very definite, is correct,
the book being called the " St. Paul's Exercise Book."

Feda. What's to do \\ith a window ? Where's the window ?
What window ? Where did you say ? Near a
window ? Feda can't get that at all. She seems
to have jumped now, she is talking of a window
now. She says, " I stand by a window so often
and I thought you so often looked to where I stood
b}^ it, as if you expected me to be there." But
when you look at the window you have to look
a little at one side. It's in a place you are in
sometimes ; and when you stand like that and think
of her, she always sees you look to one side a little,
as if you 'spect her to be standing there—and she
does. She says, " You'll do it again soon, you often
do." "Both get it," she says. She says, "You've
'
done it almost unconsciously so far," but she thinks

lltat now she lias Cold you, you \\'\\\ remember the
next tiiue you do it. I must tell him that. When
you does that, suppose you here, the window is
there (Feda points to left front), and she stands by
it. She says, " You'll do it again soon, and it will
remind you." There is something by the wall there
near the window which draws her, interests her, as
if it reminded her of the earth, close by the Avindow,
quite close. Hymn, hymn. She doesn't mean a
man "him," but a real "hymn." Feda likes
"Abide with me." She nods her head and says,
"So do I." She's mixed it up, you say. What did
you say ? Stink, stink ? What did it remind you
of ? Feda can't quite get that. What's she j)re-
tending to do 1 She's moving something. (Feda
makes swinging movement, moving hand backwards
and forwards.) What did you sa,y ? She says, " I
come then, I'm there."
What is it ? Is it a vase ? Show Feda the shape of it.
(Feda draws in the air with both her hands.)
Something shaped like this, raised a bit, and then
narrower, shiny and hard. Has it two bits sticking
out at the sides ? Not big things, two little things.
Half-way down there are rings. Can't you put your
nails through and feel grooves ? Is this ever near
a picture ? She links it up with a picture. (Here
Feda traces a cross with her finger.) She's making
a cross or two. No, no. It's a cross she's making.
W. P. I. Or two ?
F. A cross. When you said " or two " she said, " no,
no." Yet there is a cross. She says, "Not a
cross, but something looks as if it had a design of
a cross on it." When she sees the things she is
describing she sees something with a cross on it.

scribed was thought at the time to be either the Altar
Cross, or the Processional Cross at G. It is clearly, how-
ever, the Cross on the Hymn-board that is meant. The
hymn " Abide with me " has a special significance with
regard to the communicator. The only alteration made of
late near F has been the changing of the position of the
large altar candles. They were moved forward last autumn
owing to the ravages of the mice.

On the Th\irsday before the sitting two of the chief
singers in my little choir at Oxenhall were married. For
one or tAvo Sundays before, when the banns were being
called, the lady stayed away froju some services. She has
an unusually powerful voice, and the other members of
the choir had got into the habit of relying on her to lead
them, and the result now is that there is continual danger
of collapse. On one Sunday recently, as the organist also
had not turned up, I thought it necessary to change
nearly all the hymns at the last moment and substitute
better known ones. As the lady and gentleman have now
left the j)arish, I shall have to try to pull the choir to-
gether again.

§ 1. MRS. DAWSON-SMITH'S SITTINGS.
The communicator in the sittings recorded below was
Lieutenant Frank Dawson-Smith, 1/5 Battalion The King's
African Rifles, who was killed on the Abyssinian frontier
on January 11, 1920. His mother wrote on October 14,
1920, in a letter addressed to Sir Oliver Lodge's Secretary :
I don't know if you remember the account (it was in
every }3aper all over the world) of a mutiny of Somalis
on the Abyssinian frontier. My boy was the only white
man and in sole command of the native troops. He had
a district to patrol of 4000 square miles, and his nearest
white man was 250 miles away. Owing to the rabid
instigation of a fanatic of " Mad Mullah's," 20 of the
native troops mutinied ; the rest of the Somalis (notably
excitable and cowardly) fled, and left my boy to face those
fiends alone—one white man alone among that horde of
black devils. He faced them cool, calm and smiling to
the last ! And they killed him. Then they looted all he
possessed and deserted him. He was found lying dead
and quite alone in the native Boma, and he was buried
with mihtary honours, and a Memorial Cross erected to
mark the spot where a hero fell " For God, for King and
for Country." . . . He had been all through the war in
France and Flanders and was wounded at Passchendael,
before he finally got transferred to the Kjng's African
Rifles, and was sent out to East Africa and given the
entire command of the Expedition to the Northern District
Frontier.

anonymously through Su- Oliver Lodge. On January 10,
1921, she had a second (also anonymous) sitting ;
she was
accompanied on this occasion by her daughter, Miss Madge
Dawson-Smith. At both sittings a certain amount of
evidential matter was obtained of the type usually asso-
ciated with Mrs. Leonard's mediumship (together with some
statements which were incorrect or confused), but by far
the most striking incident was one which occurred at the
second sitting. I will quote first several extracts from the
records of the two sittings, showing evidence of super-
normal knowledge, and will then give in detail the incident
referred to. The notes of the two sittings were made by
Mrs. Dawson-Smith ; the comments are taken from letters
she wrote either to Sir Oliver Lodge or to his Secretary.

FedA. The communicator says : " Have you got the snap-
shots ?
"
Mks. D.-S. I have those you sent me before you passed over.
F. He says :
" Ah, but there are more to come. Will
you remember what I say ? You will laugh over
it and I want you to laugh. Don't forget it. I
feel strongly you will get it and you will see what
I mean. I am taken in such a funny position." . . .
[Note 1.]
He calls you by a funny name (more whispering, " No,
no, not that "). He must mean Mum. Not—well,
but the other is nothing. (Pause.) He says he
called you Moth—that spells " moth " (pronouncing
as written), but he says, " No, no, ask her, she
knows, don't you, Moth ?

Mrs. D.-S. It is short for mother.
P. Just a piece of a word. He says, " Yes, a piece of
mother," and he laughs. . . . [Note 2.]
He keeps calhng, " Eric, Geoff." (Feda shouted the
tAvo names.) And Eric! He says, "All right, ])ut
that down and I'll explain afterward." . . . [Note 3.]

language. He was studying them. He says, " I
started to learn the two languages, I have dabbled
with many, but these two were different. I could
.speak one fairly well—but I know little or nothing
of the other." . . . [Note 4.]
He is pleased about the memorial. You know what
he means ? His name and a date—and he likes
what you have put on it. He says, " Something
else is being done w^hich you will know soon, not a
private one but a public one." . . . [Note 5.]
Notes by Mrs. Dawson-Smith.
1. The above was verified in December, 1921, when a
brother officer brought two packages my son had left. In
one was a packet of films and some prints. I laughed
when I saw the one he evidently meant me to notice.
It was a snapshot of him surf- bathing on the coast at
Kismayu, and he was taken at an awkward moment and
certainly would not have wUlingly posed for a photograph
in the state of " nature unadorned " in which he appeared
with a broad grin as he emerged from the surf. [See also
further incident concerning photographs in second sitting.]
2. Feda wrote "Moth "^ and then stopj)ed and said that
was nothing, until I suggested it was part of my own
name. My boy always called me " Moth " (pronounced
Muth). In writing to me he called me Mother.
3. Eric was a boy who passed over 15 years ago—
a
very dear and close friend of my boy's. Geoff was killed
during the war and was in days gone by a great chum
of my boy's.
4. Swahili vocabulary. He started later on to learn
Somali, but had not time to do much before he was
kiUed.
5. A white marble tablet has been erected in our church
—in memory.
The further statement concerning a public memorial
was subsequently verified. The information is contained
' Feda's habit of writing letters with her finger in the air is familiar
to sitters with Mrs. Leonard. .

Feda. He is pleased about the new photographs. He holds
two photos, one in each hand, as if giving them. ,
" There is a photo of me—you haven't got it yet."
'
It is not a proper photo—he calls it a snapshot.

He is trying to do his best to get it to you. He ,
is going to try and impress the person who has it I
to send it to you. It may take some time, but I
think you will get it. . . . [Note 1.]
And he says, " Do you remember I spoke to you last i
time about a memorial, something being done, and
I was so pleased about it. Not for my sake, but
for you, because you would be so glad." It is not I
a private one, but a public one. . . . [See Note 5

He keeps on showing Feda you (Miss Dawson-Smith)
sitting with sheets of paper as if you were filling
them uTp in parts. He saw you doing this and was
trying to help you, in a room near a window. A '

ings which the mutineers had left after rifling my son's
kit.
The letter was written by this officer to a man in
Ireland, telling him of his finding the photo, etc., and that
he was coming home on leave and would bring them to
England. The man wrote to me, telling me, and 1
arranged to meet my son's brother-officer in London in
July, 1921. This I did—and he gave me the packet he
had gathered from the ruins, and in it among the rest was
the last photo my son had taken—his orderly, under his
instructions, had snapped my son—a splendid likeness.
2. The description of the room where she [Miss Dawson-
Smith] writes at the C.0.0. hut in Cologne is exact, even
to the folded newspaper which she buys daily on her way
to her office and keeps folded on her table beside her
until lunch time. I knew nothing of it and did not
recognise it, but of course she did.

Feda. And he says, "Have you got my little key? You
were touching it the other day. As you moved
about, you touched the key. And there was an
old purse with a receipt in it, a tiny paper. It
feels old. I wish you could find it, old, worn and
soiled, mixed up with a lot of other things." He
doesn't think you have it. Do find it. He calls it
a counterfoil. Try and unearth it. He will be so
interested. He knows you have it, a long narrow
strap close to it. "I noticed that accidentally."
He says this is important.
In sending the record of the sitting to Sir Oliver Lodge
on January 15, 1921, Mrs. Dawson-Smith remarked in
regard to the above statement that it was " correct."
Subsequently, nearly four years later, she wrote to Sir
Oliver Lodge as follows :
November 23, 1924.
I think you will be interested to hear of another fulfilled
prophecy. [Mrs. Dawson-Smith then proceeds to quote the
extract from her sitting of Januar}^ 10, 1921, as given
above.] .
304 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
I liiuitecl for this pa]3er, aiad over a big trunk in our
box-room I noticed a long strap hanging. I opened the
box and hunted through the contents and came across a
worn old leather purse, and in it a worn old counterfoil
of a money order. I carefully took it out and put it in
my desk, thinking the importance might be found later.
And true ! The following explains :
T had a letter from the " Enemy Debt Clearing Office
"
demanding a sum of money said to be owing to a Ham-
burg firm, which was incurred in July, 1914—before the
war. I knew my boy had paid it, as I remembered how
anxious he was to send the money before war was declared,
as he owed it and wanted to pay as a jwint of honour.
So I wrote to the Controller and explained that the
account had been paid ten years ago. Then the Hamburg
people said they had not received it, and if I had no
proof other than my memory, it would be pressed (the
claim). Theri I remembered my boy's message at Mrs.
Leonard's and I hastened to look at the counterfoil and
found it the identical paper needed to prove the account
had been paid. Needless to say I sent a complete account
of the transaction to the Controller, and he of course
verified it in every particular, and wrote to apologise for
having caused me so much worry and trouble, and to say
no further action would be taken in the matter. . . .
Katie Dawson-Smith.
Later Mrs. Sidgwick, to whom Sir Oliver Lodge had
sent a report of the incident, wrote to Mrs. Dawson-Smith,
asking whether it would be possible " to send us for in-
spection the correspondence with the '
Enemy Debt
Clearing Office,' and, if you still have it, the counterfoil
itself."
On December 4, 1924, Mrs. Dawson-Smith sent to Mrs.
Sidgwick the counterfoil and two letters from the " Enemy
Debt Clearing Office." Concerning these documents Mrs.
Sidgwick writes as follows in a note dated December 9,
1924 : .
Mrs. Dawson-Smith has shown us the counterfoil, which
is a " Certificate of Issue of a Money Order " numbered
99] Sittings ivith Mrs. Leonard. 305

She has also shown us all she has kept of her corre-
spondence with the Clearing Office (Enemy Debts), Cornwall
House, Stamford Street, London, S.E., namely, two letters
dated Oct. 11, 1924 and Nov. 18, 1924 respectively. These
are sufficient to show that a claim was made against Mrs.
Dawson-Smith by one August Foekelmann, Hamburg,
through the Clearing Office, for a sum in the neighbour-
hood of £8 due since 1914, and that after some corre-
spondence the Clearing House abandoned the claim alto-
gether and regretted any inconvenience that might have
been caused to her.
The above-mentioned documents have been read by Sir
Oliver Lodge as well as by myself.
Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick.
It will be seen that at the time of the sitting with
Mrs. Leonard on January 10, 1921, the only circumstances
relating to this incident of which Mrs. Dawson-Smith had
definite knowledge were (a) that her son had incurred a
debt with a German firm, and (b) that he had paid the
debt shortly before the war. The exact description of the
place in which the counterfoil was to be found certainly
suggests that the communicator's memory was the source
of the knowledge shown. The emphasis laid upon the
importance of the counterfoil, though interesting in view
of the sequel, does not seem to imply any more exact
knowledge of the future than would be within the scope
of any person who had the circumstances of the case
clearly in his mind. Obviously it might be of importance
to be able to prove payment of such a debt, and docu-
mentary proof was therefore worth preserving.
On February 24, 1922, Mrs. and Miss Dawson-Smith had
a sitting with Mrs. Brittain at which a good deal of
evidence of supernormal knowledge was shown, although

little concerning matters unknown to Ijotli sitters. I give
some extracts from this sitting below, together with Mrs.
Dawson-Smith's comments. These were contained in a
letter to Mrs. Sidgwick dated December 8, 1924. Mrs.
Dawson-Smith states that the appointment with Mrs.
Brittain was made through a friend " quite anonymously.
Mrs. Brittain did not know our names nor from what
part of the country we came." Concerning the record of
the sitting she states that " my daughter (Madge) and I
both wrote, she in shorthand."
Extracts from Sittmg with Mrs. Brittain, February 24, 1922.
Sitters : Mrs. and Miss Dawson-Smith (both recording).
Mrs. Britt.mn. . . . Here is Frank with a chum called Geoff
who was killed in a flying accident. But Frank is
the one to be talked about. He says Geoff is not
to barge in. [Note 1.] I see Frank in a far
country, either India or Egypt or somewhere East
—
he is surrounded by black men, he is the only white
man. He was killed through treachery by a bad
black man. He was Commander. He was used to
commanding mans, white mans and black mans,
many soldier mans. . . . [Note 2.] (To Miss D.-S.) Oh,
you are a soldier in khaki with a funny hat. Frank
is laughing and says something about " Knight of the
Garter." [Note 3.] Belle [Mrs. Brittain's "control"]
has come and says she is going to talk to you now.
Belt.tj. . . . The big boy is very tall—six foot two-three,
broad on the shoulder, big muscles, showing not
much " meat " on him, nice high forehead, brown
face, sunburnt, the fresh air and hot sun gives
him fine colour, nice white teeth, big and wide, firm
chin with a little dent in it—do you remember it ?
He has a saucy smile and laiighs
—" Ha, ha !
" ...
[Note 4.] Some peoples call him " Smithie " and
sometimes " Biff." I don't know why they call him
" Smithie " because it isn't his name—but they call
him " Biff " because he goes like that (illustrating
boxing). ...
He goes " pom tiddley om pom, pom, pom " (illns-

trating by slapping his bands on bis knees). . . .
[Note 5.]
Mrs. D.-S. Can you tell me how to get the missing case ?
B. He says, " The stuff has come to London, and is stored
with other things, with the label off. You can't
lose a hippopotamus like a pocket-handkerchief."
He says it is a hippo. There is some mans whom
you have bothered and bullied who will find it. . . .
The hippo can't be lost. There are a lot of names
on it but the chief label is lost. It is a wooden
box with a tin inside as lining. It will make cup-
board afterward. He is called Mac, poor old Mac,
he was a good pal to me, and he suffered a lot ;
the man it was given to [Nigel Macldntosh] (pseu-
donym) a little fair man—Ginger Mac. There are a
lot of the village boys here. Did you know [Nigel
Mackintosh's] mother ? You will find the case all
right, but you won't know where to put the things.
They are joUy nice things for you. You did get
some skins, didn't you ? . . , [Note 6.]
Have you had a St. Bernard dog ? There's a big one
standing by you. It died of distemper. It is with
Frank, he found it waiting for him. [Note 7.]
Notes by Mrs. Dawson-Smith.
1. My boy [Frank] had a dear chum called Geoff who
was killed in a flying accident in England, before he could
be sent to France. This was in 1917. Not only are the
names given correctly, but the fact that it was an acci-
dent—not killed on active service. [See also Leonard
sitting, p. 300 above, for the name Geoff.]
2. My son was in sole command of the native troops on
the Northern Frontier District (Abyssinian Frontier) of East
Africa, and he was killed by the treachery of one of his
own men after signing a Peace Treaty.
3. My daughter was an Officer in the W.A.A.C. in France
and was mentioned in despatches by Sir Douglas Haig for
gallant conduct in the field.
4. The description of my boy Frank is exceedingly good
and easily recognisable by all who knew him.
308 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [PAET
5. This I'cfei'.s Lo a liUlc joke my buy and girl had in
which they always spoke the magic words and beat the
time on their knees.
6. The case in question contained two hippo feet and
some animal skins. It was given in charge of a brother
officer of my boy's who brought it to England and left it
at the cloak room at King's Cross, where it remained
unclaimed with the labels torn off. I traced it thus far,
only to find 1 was a month too late, as it had been sold
by auction as unclaimed property. The officer, Captain
[Nigel MackintosK] had returned home on sick leave, and
he died at his home in Scotland before he could let me
know about the case he had brought. His mother wrote
after his death and told me all she knew.
7. That is a brief paragraph and not written entire
because we thought the sitting was over and Belle had
gone. We had put our pencils and notebooks away and
sat quietly waiting for the medium to awake. What
followed was this :
Mrs. Brittain opened her eyes and suddenly stared over
my shoulder, looking startled and alarmed. I was sitting
in a low chair facing her. She said with a gasp, " Oh !
don't growl like that—oh how dreadful !
" Then she grew
calmer and said, " Have you a St. Bernard dog ? It is a
big one. He died of distemper." My daughter at once
said, " No, we haven't had a St. Bernard. Our dog is an
Airedale." Mrs. Brittain instantly said, " You never saw
him ; it was long before you were born. The dog is
standing by Mother—he loves her and is very jealous of
everybody who goes near her."
This was all perfectly correct. We had a St. Bernard,
and he died of distemper when my boy was four months
old. The dog was devoted to me and to my baby
(Frank) but would not allow anybody to come near us.
Katie Dawson-Smith.
In August, 1925, I sent a draft of my report on this
case to Mrs. Dawson-Smith, asking for a corroborative
statement from Miss Dawson-Smith concerning such points
as came within her knowledge. I also pointed out that

.since at the- sitting with Mrs. Leonard on J;uiu;iry 10,
1921, and at the sitting with Mrs. Brittain on Febrnary
24, 1922, there seemed to be alhisions to Miss Dawson-
Smith's work in the W.A.A.C., it woukl be well to state
whether she attended the sittings in uniform, and I asked
for some further information concerning the extent of Mrs.
Dawson-Smith's knowledge about the " missing case " at
the time of the sitting with Mrs. Brittain. I received in
reply the following corroborative statement attached by
Miss Dawson-Smith to the report of the sittings as printed
above :

M. Daavson-Smith.
I also received a letter from Mrs. Dawson-Smith, dated
September 1, 1925, from which I quote the following
extracts :
. . . My girl (Madge) was not in uniform on either
occasion. She always wore mufti in England.
... I had been trying to trace the missing case, but
I had no real clue to go upon beyond the fact that I
had the letter from [Nigel MackintosJis] mother, after his
death, telling me of his passing and long serious illness,
when he had been too suffering to inform her of the case
of which he had taken charge, and had merely said he
left it at " the cloak room." I did not know even where
the cloak room was ! As far as I can recollect I was only
thus far on my quest when I went to Mrs. Brittain and
asked about the missing case. I then made further en-
quiries, writing to all the London Termini with the de-
scription given by " Belle," and after long waiting I ran it
to earth at the King's Cross Lost Luggage Depot and
learned that " a case as I had described had been sold at
their recent sale of unclaimed property." So that ended
my search, and but for " Belle's " close description I
should never have found out what had become of my
boy's trophies. I suppose that when she said I should
"find the case" she meant I should discover what had
happened

With reference to my comment upon the coimterfoil
incident that " the enipliasis laid upon tlie importance of
the counterfoil . . . does not seem to imply any more exact
knowledge of the future than would be within the scope
of any person who had the circumstances of the case
clearly in his mind " (see above, p. 305), Mrs. Dawson-Smith
writes in the same letter :
I think my boy knew what would happen and wanted
to help me over the worry. He knew, of course, that as
the wife of a poor country clergyman I have to practise
rigid economy, and the sum claimed, although to many
would be a trifle, to me it would demand many anxious
moments of i3lanning and contriving and ultimately some
sacrifice to obtain. So, with his love and dear thought
of sparing " Mother " if he could, he paved the way for
me to meet the claim and so ease my burden of worry. . . .

§ 2. MISS DALLAS'S SITTINGS.
I give below a record of two sittings with Mrs. Leonard
sent to me by Miss H. A. Dallas, who was the sitter.
In the first case a young man purported to communicate
whom at the time of the sitting Miss Dallas was quite
unable to identify ; he was subsequently identified by his
brother, referred to here as C. B. Vince7it (pseudonym),
from the statements made at the sitting, Miss Dallas
having at the time no acquaintance with this brother
or with any other members of the young man's family.
The first information I had of the case was contained in
a letter from Miss Dallas, written on January 15, 1924,
enclosing her notes of her sitting with Mrs. Leonard
and a statement as to knowledge subsequently acquired.
Miss Dallas asked me to return these notes, but offered
to send me an account of the incident, with corroborative
evidence, if I thought the matter worth recording. I
replied that I should be glad to have a record of the
case, and on February 13, 1924, Miss Dallas wrote to me
again enclosing the following statement :
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 311
On Oct. 4, 1923, I had a trance sitting with IVIrs.
Osborne Leonard, and in the course of this Feda described
a j^oung man whom I could not recognise. I noted every
detail carefully ; I was at a loss as to how to identify
him. My only clue was the one word " Manchester,"
uttered by Feda in this connection.
A day or two before this interview I had received a
letter from a complete stranger and it bore the postmark
" Manchester."
I wrote to my correspondent, therefore, and mentioned
that I had been given the description of a flying man
called " Jack " ; I added one or two details. She replied
that she was not able to identify him, but that she had
shown my letter to a friend who had called to see her
and that the details I had mentioned were claimed by him
as applicable to his brother. I then copied my notes
fully, asking him for a definite answer on each point, as
follows. I also asked for his [that is the dead brother's]
photograph to examine. He sent me three photographs.

H. A. Dallas.
In a subsequent letter Miss Dallas offered to obtain from
"Jack's" brother, Mr. C. B. Vincent (pseudonym), a state-
ment as to his having had no previous acquaintance either
with Miss Dallas herself or with Mrs. Leonard. Mr.
Vincent wrote as follows :
Feb. 20, 1924.
1 wish to state that I had never met or corresponded
with Miss Dallas before her interview with Mrs. Osborne
Leonard in October, 1923.
I have never met or corresponded with Mrs. Leonard up
to the present, nor had I ever heard of her before.
C. B. [VINCENTl
I questioned Miss Dallas as to what knowledge of
" Jack's " family or of the circumstances of his death her
correspondent in Manchester had had, and also whether
there had been any allusion to " Jack " in the letter
received by Miss Dallas a few days before the sitting.
Miss Dallas replied thus :
Feb. 23, 1924.
... I think that my correspondent (Miss Burrows)
must certainly have known the circumstances of " Jack's
"
death, as his brother and his wife had been friends of hers
for about two j-ears, but I do not know whether it had
occurred to her that the letter might ajjply. I did not
give full details in that first letter. I can ask her, if you
like, and I can also ask her to send me a note to the
314 Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
effect that she had not mentioned " Jack " in her letter
to me. Miss Burrows' letter arrived just before I went up
to town, and to the best of my memory I had not yet
answered it when I visited Mrs. Leonard on the following
day.
H. A. Dallas.
Concerning the points mentioned above Miss Burrows
wrote to me thus :
lOth March, 1924.
I wish to say that in my first letter to Miss Dallas I
did not mention either Jack [Vincent] or any of his
people ; and not until after Miss Dallas had sent the
notes did I tell her of the [Vincents]. Previous to my
third letter to Miss Dallas they were entirely unknown
to her.
Sarah Emily Burrows.
Miss Dallas also sent me the photograph of " Jack "
which is referred to above, and I verified the details
mentioned in the sitting. The description seemed to me
quite good.
Miss Dallas endeavoured in November, 1923, to obtain
some further communication from " Jack " through her
friend, Miss Bazett, and Miss Bazett has been kind enough
to send us a record of the impressions she received.
There is some evidence in this record of information super-
normally acquired, but there is also a good deal of con-
fusion and misstatement, so that I have not thought it
worth while to quote the record here.
The second case contributed |
by Miss Dallas is as follows :
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, September 13, 1920.
Sitter and Recorder : Miss H. A. Dallas.
Peda. a gentleman, elderly, a little bent, cheek bones show,
eyebrows with long hairs, good forehead, good
shaped head, rather thin hair on top, grey. W
will lighten the burden of material conditions. (Here
intervened apparent reference to a personal matter,
perhaps suggested by the word " burden " ; this
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 315
seems to have nothing to do with the above). Still
something they have to do in removing limitations.
He is interested in your writings, a new book, new
people broiight into touch, old conditions droppinf
away, a new lead to help people.
Note by Miss Dallas.
I did not recognise the description as applicable to
any one I know. The mention of a " new book " re-
minded me of the MS. of a " Manual of Prayers for the
Bereaved " which I had tried to get published ; but the
publishers did not care to undertake it, and " material
conditions " did not admit of my publishing it at my own
expense, so I had accepted the " limitation " which these
conditions imposed, and had put the idea of publishing
quite aside for the present. A few weeks later I saw a
request in Light for a prayer that could be used for the
Departed and wrote to that Journal (Oct. 6), offering to
lend my MS. to any one who would care to see it. Several
applicants wrote to me and among others a gentleman
whose first name was Walter ; he asked to see the MS.
with a view to publication. I did not quite understand
what that might mean, so I wrote explaining that I had
not been able to secure a publisher. He then wrote again
offering to take the MS. and publish at his own expense.
This surprisingly generous offer has been carried out. I
noted that his name began with W and when I saw him
I observed that he answered to the description Feda had
given to me ; I remarked to him that she had said that
his eyebrows were long-haired (this was not noticeable), he
replied : "I have to cut them sometimes." He removed
" the material conditions " which hindered the publication
of this new effort " to help people " by financing the
project, and when I paid him a visit to talk over matters
I was brought into contact with a circle of " new people,"
to whom at his request I gave an address on psychical
matters. At a later date I found that I had a book on
my shelf in which this gentleman was mentioned in con-
nection with a psychical experience ; I have no recollection
of ever having read this, and wlien I received his letter
X
Mrs. W. H. Salter. [part
I did not recall the book or recognise his name. I
subjoin extracts from two letters received from him and
from Mrs. Leonard in reply to enquiries from me as to
whether they had ever met.

I have no knowledge whatever of Mr. W. [Jones] of

anonymously . . . but I have no knowledge of him at
all. It is always a pleasure to me to answer anything
of this kind. Evidence is most important.
Gladys Leonard.
Further Statement by Miss Dallas.
In order to make clear the significance of the next
incident in the trance a brief statement is necessary as to
matters which preceded it :
Durmg the war I made the acquaintance of a widow,
Mrs. Raymond D., whose husband had recently died from
wounds received, and who was in great distress ; the result of
our meeting was that she experimented carefully and with
moderation, and received communications she was able to
verify, and which convinced her that her husband was in touch
with her and their children. Her own psychic faculties, and
those of the sister who experimented with her, were evidently
very strong. It was delightful to notice the change in her
outlook, and the effect was so marked that her Vicar told
me he regarded her as the best instance he had seen of
the value of attempting this sort of intercourse with the
Departed.
On May 5, 1918, Mrs. D. wrote to me saying that she
had been told (through table tilts) that her husband knew
Raymond Lodge, and on July 5 of the same year the
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 317
table tilts, when spelt out, read : "I know medium
Gladys." This seems to have been in reply to a question
she put a few days previously, asking her husband if he
could find a medium he would like her to visit. Mrs. D.
did not recollect any medium of that name and asked,
"Can you tell us more?" "No." "Shall we ask Miss
DaUas?" "Yes." "Is the medium Gladys on your
side ?
" " Yes, guide."
These questions show that Mrs. D. had no conscious
knowledge of the medium referred to.
At the tune I received her enquu-y I did not recall the
fact that Gladys is Mrs. Leonard's name ; but I was with
Mrs. D. and her sister on July 18. We had a sitting
together and after other communications the table tilted :
"Raymond thanks H. A. D." Then (for no obvious
reason) I remembered vaguely that Gladys is Mrs.
Leonard's Christian name, and I remarked that I thought
this was so; the table tilted "Yes." "Did you hear
of her through Raymond Lodge ?
" " Yes."
We then spoke of Mrs. Leonard and our thoughts
wandered from the table until they were recalled by it
tilting agam and spelling. " Y gone ?
" It appeared
that we had broken the connection in much the same
way as if we had hung up the telephone receiver ! Com-
munications of some interest connected with the war were
then resumed.
After this Mrs. D. secured an appointment with Mrs.
Leonard, Sept. 7, 1918, arranged anonymously by myself.
On this occasion she received a good description of her
husband and among other things Feda said : "He tried
to get through to you in two ways, through some one else
and through you as Avell, tried to give message to some one,
not a professional ; you were afraid to take message through
H, H, H (?), trymg to get through to H to send message.
He is leavuig no stone unturned to try to get into touch."
Mrs. D. writes :
There -was a great deal more which was most
convincing to me. . . . You know that I was not
fully convmced. ... I do not think Mrs. Leonard
at that time knew that I k]if>w yon.
318 Mrs. IF. //. Salter. [part
3Iiss Dallas's Statement Continued.
As I made the appointment she probably inferred that
I knew her (Mrs. D.), but this remark in Mrs. D.'s letter
shows that she herself made no allusion to me at the sitting.
Miss Dallas then goes on to suggest that the allusion in
Mrs. D.'s sitting to her husband having tried to " get
through ... in two ways " refers to a sitting Miss Dallas
herself had had on August 29, 1918, with Miss Violet
Ortner (Mrs. Warren Elliott), at which Mrs. D.'s husband
had purported to communicate. Miss Dallas has sent us
the following extract from her record of the sitting :
Mrs. Waeeen Elliott. Raymond lias just appeared. I hear,
" Raymond is here." [Do you know] Raymond
Lodge ?
(My note has only the names " Raymond Lodge,"
but, if I remember riglit, she put the remark in
the form of a question.)
H. A. D. There is anotber Raymond I know.
Mks. W. E. Is tliere a distant connexion ? And somehow
marriage is mixed with it.
He sends a message to thank you for the help
you gave him.
H. A. D. He lias done that before. I am very glad.
Mks. W. E. Will you send his people his love ? They are not
leaving a stone unturned ; their efforts will be
successful. He is surjirised at the change which has
taken place and is grateful to you. If there is
anything he can do for you, he will do it.
With regard to the reference to marriage Miss Dallas
notes that this was correct, as Mrs. D. is a distant
connexion of hers by marriage. She also called attention
to the verbal correspondence between Mrs. D.'s sitting
with Mrs. Leonard on September 7, 1918, and her own
sitting with Mrs. Warren Elliott on August 29, 1918, in
the allusion to " leaving no stone unturned."
We may now return to Miss Dallas's sitting with Mrs.
Leonard on September 13, 1920. of which Miss Dallas
has sent us tlic following rocoi'd :

H. A. D. Not Raymond ?
F. Not Raymond Lodge—tall nice-looking, rather long,
not oval, chin well rounded, jaw firm, nice mouth,
lips a little full, nicely curved upper lip, under lip
pressed firmly, spiritual looking face, brown hair,
forehead square, hair short, side and back, rather
long on top. [Note 1.]
(After some reference to his wife's domestic
worries R. D. said that he would give me a " Times
.
test " which he had learnt about from the " parson's
father." Doubtless by the "parson" was meant
the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas. In the Times of
the following day (Sept. 14) I was to look for this :)
Front page, second column from left, about two
inches down, there will be your mother's name, one
of her names [Note 2, a]. But very close to it is
another name connected with her, which will help
to identify [Note 2, b] ; also the name of a place
just below your mother's name, a place which your
father was connected with in a very important way
on earth [Note 2, c]. On the first column not
quite half-way down is your father's name [Note
2, d]. And the name of a near relative of his is
given almost side by side [Note 2, e]. Higher
up in the first column, near the top, there are
your initials close together—the first letters of
names forming your initials [Note 2, f]. As I
looked down the first column about two-thirds of
the way down there was the first syllable of Mar-
g-uerite, m conjunction with a place she and I were
very interested in. I am somewhat interested in
Marguerite. I ought to be—better not tell her I
said that [Note 2, g].
(Attempts were then made to mention Mr.
Stanley De Brath's name, thus :
" Bath—Bath-
Bra tli," and Feda said :)

Notes by Hiss Dallas.
1. I had never seen him [R. D.], but I had seen his
|
photograph. His wife wrote to me, " The description is i
striking, especially the curve of the upper lip, but I should I
not call his lips full, though they are not thin . . . the li
way he holds himself makes him appear taller that he is." I
2. (a) Correct ;
my mother's name was Emily. I
{b) Correct ;
my father's first name, Alexander, occurs
on the second line below.
(c) The name of the County, Hants, in which his parents
lived and where he was brought up apj)ears on the same
line as my mother's name, not below, as stated. i
(d) Slightly misplaced ; his name occurs more than half-
|
way down. '
(e) The name of a son, John, follows immediately, side
by side.
(/) I cannot find this either in the first or second
column.
{g) Marguerite is his wife's name. This is slightly
misplaced, it occurs about half-way down. Only two
names beginning with M appear, and one is Marshall.
Two names, Broclchurst and Church Stretton, occur in this
connection ; neither of them are associated with both \
persons, but Brockenhurst has association with both the
communicator and his wife.
(h) On enquiry I found that Mr. De Brath had thought
of writing, but not to ask a question. R. D.'s wife has i
been in communication with Mr. De Brath, so R. D.
might be likely to know him. His name, Stanley, occurred
in the Times at the spot indicated.
The last Times test in this series I could not verify.
In reply to an enquiry from me as to whether Miss
Dallas had mentioned the name Marguerite at her sitting
on September 13, 1920, she wrote to me as follows :
99] Sitti)ig'^ tvtlh Mr.s. Lcoitard. 321
July 5, l'J24.
... I certainly did not mention the name Marguerite
in this connection in Mrs. Leonard's presence, before Feda
mentioned it. I am sure of this for two reasons : first
because I am very cautious about giving away what
might spoil evidence, and if I occasionally make a slip
I always notice it and regret it afterwards ;
secondly
because, as I never have called Mrs. D. by her Christian
name when addressing her, or S]3eaking of her to others,
it would not be likely that I should use it inadvertently.
Whether the name may have been mentioned in one of
Mrs. D.'s sittings I cannot say . . .
H. A. Dallas.
Subsequently I wrote to Mrs. D. to ask whether tlie
name had occurred at any sitting she had had with Mrs.
Leonard before September 13, 1920. There was some
delay in getting an answer, owing to illness in Mrs. D.'s
family ;
eventually she wrote to me as follows :
10.3.26.
... In answer to your question about my name—I had
a sitting with Mi-s. Leonard dated 1.5.20, when referring
to an attempt at psychic photography the following
message came through :
(I quote from notes made at the sitting.) " Do you
know what the flowers are ? You said daisies ; he means
marguerites."
This was the only reference made to my name at any
sitting I had . . .
M. M. D.
Miss Dallas concludes her report of her sitting with Mrs.
Leonard on September 13, 1920, by recording the following
incident, in which • information was given concerning a
matter of which she had no normal knowledge at the
time.
Statement by Miss Dallas.
The communication which followed appeared to be from
a friend who had been much in my thoughts, particularly
in connection with a book I had been reading ; it seemed
322 ilfr.s. W. H. Salter [part
as if lie was aware of tliis. 'I'Ik' only detail which is
evidential of something more than telepathy came at the
close of the sitting, when I was told that I was going
soon to meet some one connected with this friend " on
the earth plane."
As his relatives are almost unknown to me I had not
any anticijoation that I should meet them. I had arranged
to have tea that afternoon with a lady from the United
States. When she arrived she brought with her a lady
who was quite a stranger to me, and not expected. In
the course of conversation I learned that she is the god-
daughter of the friend who had just communicated through
Feda.
§ 3. EVIDENCE OBTAINED BY MRS. DRUMMOND i
AND MRS. LE BLANC SMITH.
Mrs. Drummond, as she is called here, is a Member of
the Society who has had a considerable number of sittings
with Mrs. Leonard, at which her son Ian and her husband
have purj)orted to communicate. Incidents previously re-
ported to us by Mrs. Drummond have been printed in the
S.P.R. Journal (Vol. XX. p. 128 and p. 398).
In May, 1923, Mrs. Drum.mond sent me an extract from
a sitting she had had with Mrs. Leonard on January 3,
1923, with the following covering letter :
25tli May, 1923.
Is the enclosed incident of interest to you ? The type-
written notes were sent to me by Mr. W. {Brown'] (pseu-
donym) with permission to send them to you. He is very
emphatic that his identity should not be disclosed and he
chose his own pseudonym. I don't think he is satisfied
with any evidence he has had throiigh Mrs. Leonard or
any other medium.
L. D. [DRUMMOND].
When I sent the proof of this part of my report to
Mrs. Drummond m the early spring of 1926, she told me
^ Pseudonym.
99] Siifings ivith. Mrs. Leonard. 323
tliat she lie]ieved tJiere T\onld now be no objection to
revealing the fact that the jjerson referred to above as
Mr. Brown was in fact the late Mr. William Archer.
At Mrs. DrummoncVs suggestion I wrote to Mrs. William
Archer and obtained from her and from Mr. William
Archer's Executor, Colonel Archer, permission to publish
the name in this rejDort. Some of our Members will be
aware that at a meeting of the Society held on February
18, 1926, a paper was read by Dr. William Brown, which
included a report on some sittings with Mrs. Leonard at
which Mr. William Archer had purported to communicate.
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 3, 1923.
Sitter and Recorder : Mrs. Drummond.
Feda. You were thinking of [Archer'\.
L. D. D. Yes.
F, And he [Ian] says, " I see his boy over here many
"times and you know he helps his father to write,
not automatically, but to write things ; his father is
a clever man and he writes not only stories but
plays, and his boy has been trying lately to write
something very special with him, but it was founded
on some old matter of a long time ago which his
father had not used but has been thinking of using
lately. Do you think you could let him know ?
He does know, but he wants telling, it is rather
important. Just lately he has been going back and
using up some material that he had a good many
years ago, and now he has an idea of making
something of it and his boy is very interested in it."
Note by Mr. Archer.
On the very day of this sitting (January 3, 1923) I was
on the other side of tiie Atlantic, working at a play
founded on an Elizabethan subject (" some old matter of
a long time ago ") which I had had in my mind ever
since 1920, but had begun to put in form only in November
last {" just lately he had been going back and using iip
some material that he had a good many years ago
The references to this play are therefore exactly accurate ;
324 Mrs. ir. //. Sailer. [part
and iiicy arc rendered all the mure curious by the faot
that I had never spoken to any human being of my in-
tention of writing a play on this subject. I have had
several sittings with Mrs. Leonard (the latest in August
1922), but I am pretty sure she does not know my name.
Even if she does, any telepathic explanation of this incident
would presuppose a power on Mrs. Leonard's part to read
(at great distances) my unspoken intentions, and to ascer-
tain what, at a given period, I was worldng at—a matter
quite unknown even to the people immediately around me.
At one of Mrs. Drummond's later Leonard sittings a
reference, which proved veridical, was made to Mr. and
Mrs. Le Blanc Smith and their son Ralph. Mr. and Mrs.
Le Blanc Smith have had numerous sittings with Mrs.
Leonard, at which their son has purported to communicate,
and evidential statements have been made.
Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, February 14, 1924.
Sitter and Recorder : Mrs. Drummond.
P'eda. Ian says :
" Ralph, I've been with him of course."
L. D. D. What were you doing ?
F. " Yes, trying to help some one. I have got a little
job to do with you, Mum. Ralph wants it."
L. 1). D. What is it i.
V. Oh, not exactly to get messages, but to lick something
into shape for him. Not a nice way to say " lick,"
Ian. " You'll understand soon, but I think you
ought to have known already, something they
(Ralph's people] want you to do. I can impress
you and help you about it and I am going to do
it, something they want you to do with somebody
else for them, not psychic material, but about a
psychic thing," he says, and he approves, and he
will help you in the aforesaid licldng process.
L. D. D. Ralph wants me to help ?
F. Yes, they were talking about it yesterday, I don't
mean here, at home, and they were saying that they
would be so pleased if you could do it for them,
because they don't ]<now the correct procedure, so
99] Sittings -with Mrs. Leonard. 325
I suppose you will sooii know about it, even if you
don't know now, and lie says, " Yes, I bet you
will." Mr. Arthur [Mrs. Drummond's husband] is
very interested and keeps nodding his head and
saying "good." It is not a lot of trouble, but Ian
says, " I expect I will have to help you with it."
Shortly after the sitting Mrs. Drummond wrote to Mrs.
Le Blanc Smith to ask whether the above references had
any meaning for her. To this enquiry Mrs. Le Blanc
Smith replied as follows: 7 o
^ March 3, 1924.
Thank you so very much for your very kind letter. I
know exactly what Ian means. I said the other day I
wanted very much to send you some information Ralph
gave me at a sitting which I had no knowledge of and
which I found was right in every particular, and that
I wanted you very much, if you thought the test good
enough, to send it to the S.P.R.
We further talked of you in this way another time, and
I said how very much I Avanted to find some friend
(especially a psychic one, if possible) who woiTld call on a
great friend of mine who is going to live at Hensham,
and somebody said, " Doesn't [Mrs. Drummond'] live in
Sussex ? It would be splendid if she would." But of
course you are miles and miles away, but Ian may have
got that too, and " miles " don't count with them. It is
very good, isn't it ? I will write out the sitting and take
it over to the old woman whose relations (dead years and
years ago) it concerns and get her to sign her replies to
it. She is over 80 and nearly blind, and the information
is all correct as far as it goes.
I think that Ian telling you I wanted to ask you this
is a very good test, don't you ? Because I said it here
just casually to my husband and Mrs. D who was
staying here then. I never thought of or mentioned it at
Mrs. Leonard's. ... ^ „
B. Le Blanc Smith.
The incident in regard to which Mrs. Le Blanc Smith
had been thinking of asking Mrs. Drummond''s advice
occurred at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard on December 4,
326 Mrs. W. II. Sailer. [part
1923, at whicli ]Mr. and Mrs. Le Blanc 8mith were both
present. 1 give below an extract from the record of the
sitting and a preliminary note of explanation by Mrs. Le
Blanc Smith.
Note by Mrs. Le Blanc Smith.
" M. F." or Mary Farr is an old woman over 80 years of
age and nearly blind, but in full possession of all her facul-
ties. She gave my children their first lessons, and "Ralph,"
my elder son, killed near Ypres on 26th November,
1915, was very fond of her. She was their daily
governess, and I never knew anything of her people, who
were dead before I knew her, beyond the fact that they
had been very respectable old-fashioned farmers. Some
years ago my son Ralph through a table sitting at Mrs.
Leonard's asked me to go and tell " M. F.", as he called
her, about spiritualism. He added, "I've prepared her, it
will be all right, she'll understand." I went very reluc-
tantly, but she was indeed " prepared " and took the
deepest interest in it, and it has been the joy and conso-
lation of her lonely old age, with no relation or old friend
living, debarred from books by her almost complete blind-
ness. She is always happy and cheerful, full of confidence
and hope in the future life.
I had never heard she had an uncle, or any particulars
about her people, and knew nothing of the photos men-
tioned.

she was not well before she passed over, iU a long

her " her little girl," her sister.

would have got rid of it. Uncle died of same

Notes by Miss Farr.
1. Miss Farr says, "The lady was her mother, the de-
scription answers exactly." The " lady girl " was her
daughter, Miss Farr's sister, passed over about eleven years
of age, from consumption ; her uncle died of consumption.
2. Quite correct.
3. Miss Farr says, " Yes, when I was young I wished
for a '
hoop '
or steel petticoat, when I was at home on
holiday. My mother refused to buy me one and my uncle
walked five miles to Hatfield and bought me one. We
were then living at Barber's Lodge Farm, near Hatfield."

Concerning the circumstances in which these notes were
obtained Mrs. Le Blanc Smith writes to Mrs. Drummond :
March 11, 1924.
I went to Standon this morning and have written doA\n
the exact answers " M. F." made to each statement or
question of Ralph's. . . . The "hoop" incident is cer-
tainly wonderful. I knew absolutely nothing of it, not
even that she had had an uncle. t> t -r.

§ 4. MRS. FERNALD'S SITTING.
The incident recorded below was reported by Mrs.
Fernald, who is a Member of the Society, to the Secretary,
Miss Newton. I give first Miss Newton's coijy of an
extract from Mrs. Fernald's notes of a sitting with Mrs.
Leonard. The sitter on this occasion was Mrs. Fernald's
husband, Mrs. Fernald herself acting as recorder ; the
ostensi1>le communicator is their son.

Extract from Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, March 6, 1925.
Feda. The young one's mind is divided between two places
—very interested in your being here and in another
place away from London. A curved part of the
coast, near the sea—ships. He's very fond of this
place. You will be reminded of this place by
having it put in front of you very soon. A ship-
ping place, used as a port—an island close to it.
He shows me you holding something in your hand
—a paper or narrow book with printing or pictures.
As if you opened it suddenly and are suddenly re-
minded of this port. You'll see it before you go,
but you'll go. Even within a few hours you'll be
reminded of it. An island that you'll be reminded
of. That's what it is. An island, and that is what
it is called.
Note by Miss Newton.
March 30, 1925.
Mrs. Fernald read the notes of the sitting to me on
March 9, 1925. She told me then that she had no doubt
at all that the place described was San Francisco, a place
her son was exceedingly fond of, near where they have a
house overlooking the bay and Angel Island, one of three
islands in the bay. She also told me that Feda had
seemed to be trying to give the name of an island, and
not succeeding had concluded with " Well, an island it is,
and an island it's called."
To-day, March 30, Mrs. Fernald brought me [a] packet
as she had received it. It consisted of five Sections, or
Numbers, of Progressive California in Botagravure, issued
by the San Francisco Chronicle, all dated March 11, 1925.
Section E was placed first, and on opening the packet one
would be confronted by the picture on the cover, which
was a reproduction, 12^ by 10 inches, of a photogi-aph of a
])art of San Francisco Bay showing Angel Island. (See
Plate III.) The publication may be described as "a
paper or narrow book with printing or pictures." It is
16^ in. long, \\\ in. wide, and eacli Section contains from
Plate III.
99] Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 329
16-32 pages covered with small reproductions of photo-
graphs illustrating current events, with brief printed notes
regarding them.
The date of the postmark on the packet is illegible.
The name of the sender, Miss Livermore, is written on the
wrapper. Mrs. Fernald told me that she is a friend from
whom she hears " once in a blue moon," and that the
packet was entirely unexpected.

Statement by Mrs. Fernald.
March 31, 1925.
On Saturday, March 28, I received a tightly rolled
parcel through the post. On opening the roll a full-page
picture of a part of San Francisco Bay showing Angel
Island was the first thing I saw. Immediately I recalled
Feda's words in our Leonard sitting of March 6. [Quota-
tion from sitting follows, see above.]
The confirmation of Feda's words was so striking that
I took the roll of " papers or narrow books " to Miss
Newton on Monday, March 30, in the original wrapper, as
it had come through the post. There were five illustrated
pamphlets in the roll, showing different Californian views.
The Angel Island view was on the top and the first one
to be seen as the packet was unrolled. The date on the
pamphlet (a newspaj)er supplement) was March 11 —five
days later than the Leonard sitting.

Miss Newton wrote on May 9, 1925, to the Business
Manager of the San Francisco Chronicle, asking upon
" what date Section E of Progressive California in Rota-
gravure was first on sale and available to the public."
The following reply was received :
May 29, 1925.
Replying to your letter of May 9 in reference to the
date of publication of the Progressive California in Rota-
gravxire, I beg to advise that this number was put on sale
to the public on March 11. Ho\^ever, various sections of
330 Mrs. IF. H. Walter. [part
this publiccation were printed in advance. For example,
the first section was printed on February 2 and another
on February 25. . . .

Mrs. Fernald wrote to her friend Miss Livermore to
ask her to record the circumstances in which the copies
of Progressive California were despatched. In reply Miss
Livermore wrote to Miss Newton as follows :
San Francisco,
April 25, 1925.
Mrs. Fernald has asked me to write you exact data in
the matter of my sending her those views of San Francisco
Harbour which came to her as such a coincidence after
having had a description of them in a sitting with Mrs.
Leonard.
They were published as a supplement to the Daily
Chronicle and were delivered with the regular paper on
March 11.
At once on seeing the pictures I thought of three friends,
all absent Californians, who would be interested in seeing
them. I left the papers lying on my desk for about a
week—undecided as to whether to send them to a friend
in Paris, or to one of two friends in London. I can't
tell you the precise date of my sending. I woke up that
morning with a brisk and firm decision to send them to
Mrs. Fernald—more to clear my desk than for any other
reason.
And this is all I can tell you about it. It seems a
remarkable coincidence and I am very glad to have given
Mrs. Fernald this pleasure. -r, -r

In reply to a further enquiry as to the circumstances in
which the statement at the sitting of March 6, 1925, was
made, Mrs. Fernald wrote to Miss Newton as follows :

D3'ke's [the communicator's] mind being divided between
two places quite out of a clear sky. There was nothing
to lead up to it. Neither my husband nor- I had spoken
a word during the sitting. I was writing my notes at
the time as fast as I could get the words down, as appar-
ently unmoved by any of Feda's statements as if I had
been taking notes on a lecture. My husband sat like a
graven image through the whole of the two hours. We
had never spoken to any one about our proposed visit to
Mrs. Leonard. From the first it had seemed of paramount
importance to us both that no one should know that we
were going to her—and to Miss Walker, Sir Oliver Lodge's
Secretary, through whom the appointment was made, we
were known as Mr. and ]\Irs. Eliot.
Josephine H. Fernald.
Miss Newton did not in fact see the notes when Mrs.
Fernald brought them to the Rooms in April, but she saw
them at a later date and has sent the following note :
October 22, 1925.
I have examined the notes taken at the sitting. There
is nothing in thein that might appear to have led up to
the incident recorded, or to suggest that the sitter and
note-taker had any interest in America or in any other
place away from London.
Mrs. Fernald told me that she and her husband have
lived in London since 1907.
Isabel Newton.
It would therefore appear that at the time of the sitting
Mrs. Leonard had no reason to associate Mr. or Mrs.
Fernald with California, although it is possible that some-
thing in their voice or manner may have led her to think
they were Americans. It is worth mentioning that since
1898, Mr. and Mrs. Fernald have spent only three years
(1903-1906) in America. I am told by people who have
met Mrs. Fernald that her connection with America is not
immediately apparent. Mr. Fernald, it will be observed,
did not speak at all during the sitting.
It should also be noted that the view of San Francisco
Bay which was reproduced on the cover of Progressive
332 Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. [part
California, and to which reference appears to be made at
the sitting, is not an obvious or typical view, not the
kind of view that would be likely to be suggested to
Mrs. Leonard if she had somehow formed the idea that
her sitters were Californians. The general sweep of the
bay is not shown at all, whereas the island referred to at
the sitting is conspicuous. On the other hand the view
has special associations for Mr. and Mrs. Fernald. On
this point Mrs. Fernald writes :
October 22, 1925.
Our house is on a slope of Mount Tamalpais overlooking
the more northern part of San Francisco Baj^, which has
altogether a length of fifty miles. The house was built
for the view—the most conspicuous feature in the fore-
ground is Angel Island. The other t\^-o islands in the
bay cannot be seen from our house.
Josephine H. Fernald.
Miss Newton and Mr. Dingwall corroborate Mrs. Fernald's
statement as follows :
October 22, 1925.
Mrs. Fernald has shown us snapshots taken at the house
in California which confirm her statement that Angel
Island is a conspicuous feature in the view from the
house.

This volume is one of the most important critical siu-veys of
physical mediumship which has hitherto ajjpeared. It is
primarily an examination of printed records supplemented
occasionaUj^ by an account of the results of the authors"
personal experiences. For many years it has been said that
no serious critical study has been undertaken by those who
frankly dismiss the accumulated evidence in favour of the
authenticity of the alleged physical phenomena of spirituahsm.
That objection can now no longer be urged. For in the
volume before us the authors have evidently been at some
pains to examine the literary evidence, and in their ov.ii
words, they find that the final result of theii' inquiry is to
conclude that no scientifically valid proof of so-caUed physical
mediumship has hitherto been brought forward.
The authors of this remarkable work have been generous to
their opponents in the choice of material. The volume opens
with a general introduction, which is immediately followed by
an admirable chapter on methods of investigation, in which
the weaknesses and flaws in mediumistic inquiries are ruthlessly
examined. We are not sure how far Dr. v. Gulat- Wellenburg
(who is the author of this section) is a\\-are that the defects
he notes are only too painfully famiHar to the workers in this
field. But the difficulties which confront the reformer appear
almost insuperable, and Count v. Klinckowstroem is right when
334 E. J. Dingwall. [part
he says that so long as the investigator preserves the tra-
ditional methods of inquiry, methods which have remained
almost unchanged for decades, so long no way seems clear by
which the phenomena can be properly interpreted (p. 95).
As an introduction to the detailed analysis of individual
cases Count v. Klinckowstroem touches upon the Hodgson-
Davey experiments, and also contribiites a short account of
the contents of the well-known book The Confessions of a
Medium (London, 1882), which he might well have supple-
mented by a similar reference to the rarer and more inter-
esting Revelations of a Spirit Medium (St. Paul, Minn., 1891.
Keprinted 1922). Although Count v. Klinckowstroem lays
stress upon these confessions, he must be aAvare that the
contents have little value in a consideration of modern physical
mediumship as investigated by competent observers. These
volumes present a picture of the ordinary spiritualistic " circle
"
at which the observers are merely tools in the hands of the
medium. Such performances are probably not now common
in Europe, but they are still far from rare in the United
States, and we haA-e ourselves seen more flagrant examples
than anjrthing recorded in the Confessions of a Medium.
They are of value rather as psychological studies of states
of mind, and it is note^'orthy that the AAriters of this volume
constantly insist upon this important and often neglected
factor.
The examination joroper is begun by Dr. Rosenbuseh, who
takes the inquiry of the London Dialectical Society as his
first subject. The study is fair and judicious, although we
cannot assent to his rather brusque dismissal of the incident
recorded by the Sub-Committee as described on p. 10 of the
Report} On the other hand it can hardly be denied that the
Dialectical Society failed to produce the quality and standard
of evidence which would prove acceptable among serious
inquirers to-day. The fourth chapter is by Count v. Khnckow-
stroem and treats mainly of Sir William Crookes's experiments
with Home and Florence Cook. It is the former that
the Aveakness of the criticism is most apparent. The author

is forced to admit that the evidence of fraud in the case of
Home is almost non-existent and at the same time his pheno-
mena were far more varied and impressive than that of any
other medium of the past. It is true that criticism can easily
be levelled against certain isolated cases. But minor omissions
and inaccuracies are small compared with the immense bulk of
evidence regarding the amazing occurrences in his presence.
Substitution of hands and the surreptitious use of the feet
siniijly do not meet the case. The observers were either
hallucinated or some at least of the phenomena really occurred.
There seems no escape from this conclusion, and Count v.
KUnckowstroem cannot avoid one or other horn of this
dilemma by vaguely discussing the incompleteness of Crookes's
experiments or the imperfect explanations of Mr. Podmore.
On the other hand his criticism of Florence Cook and the
problem of Katie King is sound, and we are glad to note that
he fully appreciates the difficulties which, in reference to this
case, confront those who maintain the teleplastic basis of
mediumistic materialisations. Similarly \\e agree with his
treatment of Prof. Zollner's experiments, although the recent
story concerning Slade's alleged confession needs confirmation.
In Chapter VI. Dr. Rosenbusch discusses Palladino. This
medium is easier to deal with than Home, since all admit that
she occasionally resorted to fraud, but we cannot entirely
assent to Dr. Rosenbuschs summing up of the problem.
" She was certainly a conjurer,"' he writes, but was she
something more ? Were there under the layer of false pheno-
mena genuine ones also ? Was there even one genuine one ?
Does there exist one single compelling observation that shows
that a phenomenon occurred which was beyond her actual
faculties or the possibihty of fraudulent creation ? We have
never found such an observation in the abundant materials
before us."" In support of this opinion Dr. Rosenbusch has
been at pains to examine the literature from the early days
of Damiani, Chiaia and Barth down to the American sittings
in 1909.^ But as with Home the criticism is weak, since no
^ The examination of the original authorities is somewhat wealtened by a
number of errors due mainly to difficulties in translation and to an im-
perfect acquaintance with the whole of the literature. Mr. R. Lambert
has indicated some of these in Psi/chische Studien for November, 1925.

definite theory is adduced to account normally for the pheno-
mena observed by reputable witnesses. The argument rather
runs on the assumption that since some tricks were discovered,
the remaining j)henomena Avere tricks also though undiscovered.
There is certainly something to be said for this hypothesis,
and we might agree with it if the phenomena were all of the
same class : but to suppose that release of a hand or foot
which explains some phenomena also explains those observed
by Sir Oliver Lodge on the lie Roubaud, appears to involve
suppositions for which there is no valid basis whatever. Simi-
larly in the survey of the Society for Psychical Research sittings
at Naples stress is laid on what is considered the weakness
of Mr. Baggally's hand control, but to suppose that this made
it possible for all the phenomena to be produced by the
medium's hands and feet, including the visible and tangible
hands and black objects, seems to us to demand further
evidence than that which Dr. Rosenbusch has offered. For
to assume that one person is capable of producing 305 " pheno-
mena " fraudulently when two expert witnesses are doing
everything that they can do under the circumstances to prevent
that fraud, is to suggest a dexterity which does not, in our
opinion, exist. The same criticism can, we thinlt, be apphed to
Dr. Rosenbusch's analysis of Mile. Tomczyk's phenomena, an
analysis which is the first of its kind. He confines himself
almost solely to the telekinetic phenomena, and his conclusion
is that the medium attached normal threads or wires to the
objects and then hfted them. Now this again demands a
behef (we would almost call it a credulous behef) in the power
of the conjurer which is quite unwarranted by the facts. For
the facts are these. Dr. Ochorowicz had his early experiments
in WarsaAv in 1909. In 1914 MUe. Tomczyk was in London,
where similar although weaker phenomena were observed.
That is to say that for six years this medium produced one
type of telekinetic phenomena. Supposing this to have been
a trick, the solution was simple. It is that indicated by Dr.
Rosenbusch himself. But not a single observer seems to have
seen the necessary threads or wires being attached to the
objects to be moved or detached from them. If the trick be so
simple, it can be repeated. Can Dr. Rosenbusch discover a
single conjurer who is willing to repeat these effects for any
99] Reviews. 337
length of time ? We believe that if he proposes it, he will
be received with a laughing refusal. For, as Professor Hoffman
has said in Modern idagic, the first rule to be borne in mind
is this :
" Never tell your audience beforehand what you are
going to do," and" it follows that you should never perform
the same trick ttvice on the same evening." In this case the
medium broke these two rules for six years. Can we indeed
suppose that her investigators were so amazingly incompetent
that they all failed to detect her methods of gaining possession
of her threads and attaching, detaching and getting rid of
them ? Certainly if this be the case, thenh uman testimony
is worthless in this branch of psychical research, since no
arguments such as those adduced from exjjeriments ui slate-
"RTiting and billet-reading have here any weight. For here
the obseiTfers know how the trick is done before they see it ;
yet they camiot detect one move which is concerned with its
perpetration. Such amazing lack of acute observation is almost
unthinkable, apart altogether from the other factors pointing
to the supernormal character of the phenomena, to which Dr.
Rosenbusch apparently attaches small weight.
In the eighth chapter Dr. Rosenbusch examines the Goligher
phenomena and here builds up a strong case against the
supernormal character of the occurrences. The whole chapter
should be carefully studied, and we shall content ourselves here
with quoting a part of the final x^aragraph which sufficiently
indicates Dr. Rosenbusch's judicious and penetrating analysis
of this extraordinary case. The case of Crawford," he writes,
is more interesting than the case of Miss Gohgher. . . . For
behind the fantastic misinterpretations of these scarcely original
productions of an unsavoury sorcery hes the more weight}^
problem of their deluded sponsor. These reports of Crawford
are not to be explained by the imjierfection of human obser-
vation. Here are to be discerned the more severe aberrations
of mental life, and the range of their activities is astonishing.
Is the case of Crawford unique ? What precise conditions
predispose the mind for assimilating a superstition so easUy 1
And what power of perception caused Goethe to characterize
his occult experiences in the following striking phrase :

Having examined the cases of Sordi and Gazerra, Dr. v.
Gulat-Wellenburg passes to a detailed survey of the case of
Eva C. He contributes a discussion in which good use is
made of the many suspicious incidents which occurred with
this medium and prints certain of the more curious photo-
graphs to illustrate his criticisms- The treatment appears to
be restrained, and evidently a very careful study of the docu-
ments has been carried out. We are not clear, however, w^hat
his conclusions are, and there is small mention of the regurgi-
tation theory, which aj^art from the confederacy of Madame
Bisson, seems the last (if very insecure) refuge for the sceptic.
Perusal of the chapter will probably leave the critical reader
^'^here he was before except that Dr. v. Gulat-Wellenburg 's
acute analysis of the foot incident on May 29, 1911, and the
apjjearance of the " sKpper on May 17 and 20, 1912, will incite
the student to attack the records of other sittings in the same
spirit. The treatment of the Society for Psychical Research
series (pp. 353-365) is careful and the author deserves credit
for his painstaking and laborious work. On the other hand.
Count V. Khnckowstroem is more superficial in an examination
of Kluski and Willy Schneider in Chapters XI. and XII.
More might be made of evidence against the former, and too
much stress has been laid on the incident where a mould of
unexpected shape appeared at a sitting in Warsaw. Moreover,
no mention is made of the articles of Nordmann and Morhardt,
A\hich are at least worth consideration.
The treatment of Willy Schneider is again weak, although
Count V. Khnckowstroem is to be congratulated upon his fear-
less attempt to cast doubt upon the results and methods of
control. We cannot agree to the importance he attaches to
the exposure by Mr. Seeger (pp. 414 seq.), and we consider
that the weight he gives to Professor Henning's alleged ex-
periences with a Russian "medium"^ is altogether out of
proportion. He accepts Prof. Henning's statements without
any proof being offered, and even without the signed state-
ments of the witnesses or the name of the medium. Yet
after deaUng with these occurrences of very doubtful authen-
ticity he writes, These amazing phenomena put the case of
Willy considerably in the shade "
(p. 446). We are frankly
1 See Proc, S.P.R., 1924., pp. 327 seq.
99] Reviews. 339
surprised that Count v. Klinckowstroem has allowed himself
to be diverted from the path of fair criticism by these
phenomena reported by Prof. Hemiing. We have examined
this report with some attention, and evidence is totally
lacking that the phenomena were in any ^^ay like those so
graphically described by Prof. Henning. On the contrary.
Prof. Hemiing's narrative leaves the impression that a few
miserable parlour tricks were presented to him and his friends,
and that the performance was then raised to the dignity of
an investigation in order to jjrovide material for just that
criticism that Count v. Klinckowstroem has used in comiection
with it. If Prof. Henning wishes to be considered seriously
he must permit other observers to see these marvels as Baron
V. Schrenck-Notzing has done with Schneider, and as every
scientific man does when he demonstrates some new pheno-
menon. We should like ourselves to examine Prof. Henning's
" Russian medium and to report faithfully our experiences.
But from ^^'hat we have been able to ascertain Prof. Henning
is as shy of allowing psychical researchers to see his medium"
as the " medium is of permitting any sort of adequate
investigation. The criticism of Wdly Schneider is of the same
type as that of Home. Mere freedom of hand or foot does
not explain the phenomena, neither does the theory of an
ingenious use of a wire in the mouth. In our opinion the
facts compel the adoption of the hypothesis of supernormal
action until it is shown that a normal theory fits the facts.
This Count v. Klinckowstroem has not shown in the case of
Willy Schneider. He is much more successful with Guzik in
Chapter XIII., whereas in Chapter XVI. he reverts to appar-
ently unwarranted faith in the rehabihty of \^'itnesses if their
observations are contrary to the medium's claims. In Chapters
XIV. and XV. Dr. v. Gulat-WeUenburg deals with Nielsen and
Laszlo, dismissing the claim of the former and appreciating
the importance of the latter.
Whatever we may think of the conclusions of the authors,
of this volume, it must, we think, be agreed that they have
contributed a permanent addition to the scanty material on
physical mediumship. The book is one for the student and
not for the propagandist : it presupposes a serious interest in
the problems apart altogether from their relation to survival
340 E. J. Dingwall. [part
of personality after death. This aspect of the question is left
almost untouched except in so far as it is indicated that the
religious atmosphere of seances is a factor in increasing super-
stitious behefs on the jjart of the sitters. The question that
the authors have attempted to answer is whether any super-
normal physical phenomena occur as described. If we under-
stand them rightly their answer is in the negative. They do
not deny the possibihty of such phenomena occurring. They
merely state that they have failed to discover any scientific
evidence that they do so occur. We fear that the circle of
readers in this country will be small, both on account of the
length of the volume and also the difficulties involved in
translation. Should any enterprising publisher prepare an
English edition he may obtain some satisfaction from the
knowledge that the book is the most important critical survey
of physical mediumship since that made by Mr. Podmore.

Der Okhidtismus in Uricunden. Edited by Max Dessoir. II. " Die

By Dr. Richard Baerwald.
Berlin, UUstein, 102.5. Pp. ix.+382.
This stately volume is one of a series under the editorship
of Prof. Dessoir which is designed to instruct the general public
in Germany on the subjects included in what the Germans
prefer to call " occultism."' " Physical Mediumism," by three
writers, and " Suggestion and Hypnotism, "
by Prof. Albert
Moll, are the other volumes announced in the series, which,
if one may judge by this volume, should fulfil its purpose
very well. It is composed of selected extracts from standard
" classical " works on the subject, most of which are unknown
and unprocurable in Germany, accompanied by critical com-
ments. The ground it covers is best indicated by an enumera-
tion of the topics it discusses, viz. Kerner's Seer of Prevorst,
Telepathy, Phantasms of the Living and the Dead, Clairvoyance,
Prophecies, and Spirit-communications, which consider Flournoy's
case of " Helene Schmidt,"' Mrs. Leonard, Raymond and Cross-
99] Reviews. 341
Correspondences, with special attention to the Ear of Diony-
sius." The selection, containing as it does a large amount of
material from '
the researches of the S.P.R. (for which Dr.
Baerwald always expresses the highest ajipreciation and resj)ect),
must be pronounced excellent, and the narrative is lucid and
well-arranged. Besides his copious quotations from the S.P.R.,
he also gives interesting accounts of cases not so well knoAvn
in this country, such as the experiments of Doctors Chowrin,
Naum Kotik and WasiHewski, of Richet and Geley with
Ossowietzki, and of Dr. Pagenstecher with Maria Reyes de Z. ;
and altogether his book is a competent and creditable piece
of workmanship.
It is when it comes to theorizing and explaining the facts
that it becomes permissible to part comjaany Dr. Baer-
T\'ald. He beheves in telepathy and apparently in nothing
else—except hyperaesthesia—and tries to reduce everything to
them by extending their powers to an unlimited extent. He
holds that telepathic communication, A\hich he conceives on
the analogy of wireless radiation, is primarily between the
unconscious parts of t^wo souls Avhich are en rapport, and is
ready to beheve also that all souls are thus unconsciously m,
rapport, and that, consequently, any kno\A'ledge in the possession
of any mind may be tapped by a sensitive.
Moreover, although the unconscious is officially described as
infantile m its mentahty, he tends to attribute to it a high
degree of practical intelhgence and remarkable feats of dra-
matic impersonation. It is obvious that, so lavishly conceived,
telepathy " may be alleged to explain anything, and that it
becomes next to impossible to guard against it. No stress is
laid on the negativity of the conception, on the scantiness of
the direct evidence for it, and on the competition of alternative
theories. It becomes a key that turns in every lock, though
it remains to be seen whether it will really open any doors.
Nor is it clear that it has a scientific status superior to that
of other hypotheses AA'hich are equally wide and vague, say
than " spirits, '
or divine (or diabohcal) intervention. Wide
and vague hypotheses are incidental to the initial stages in the
growth of any science, and at present characterize all oiu- efforts
to understand the subjects of psychical research. AH of them,
even " spirits," are capable of scientific use, all, even " hyper-
342 F. C. S. Schiller. [PAKT
aesthesia," are capable of blocking inquiry. There is no
occasion, therefore, for any one of them to give itself airs and
to pride itself on any inherent scientific respectabUity. For
all at bottom suffer from the same weakness, which besets aU
theorizing in a subject not yet brought under experimental
control. We cannot verify them by accumulating evidence at
will, and we cannot make crucial experiments. So we camiot
use the pragmatic, i.e. the really scientific, test, and 7nake
them work. Until we can do so, it must remain open to every
one to beheve as much, or as httle, as he likes, and vain to
browbeat dissenters with the threats of scientific authority.
Science itself in modern times has modified its basic doctrines
so rapidly and radically, and become so conscious of the prag-
matic nature of its method, that it has grown more and more
careless about the ideal of coerciveness foisted on it by the philo-
sophers, and no longer expects its truths to comply with the
dogmas extracted by former generations from their less adequate
knowledge. If a truth is good and useful and the best to be
had, it is not essential that it shovdd be absolutely certain and
capable of extorting universal assent. It is recognized, not
because we cannot help ourselves and there is no alternative,
but because it is the best available and we desire the power
over events which it gives us. Now Dr. Baerwald too often
tries to make capital for his pet hypothesis (which for all one
can tell as yet inai/ turn out to be the best) by arguments
based on the false ideal that " truth " rests on coercion (cf.
p. 159) ;
yet he too at times sees quite well that " 7iearly
(sic) all our human knowledge consists of probabihties," and
that an ever-growing probabUity with a gradual approxi-
mation to certainty " may be as valuable and sufficient in
psychical science as in any other (cf. p. 79). That is the true
method of science, if it is added that absolute certainty is as
unnecessary as it is unattainable !
Toleration of alternative theories then is even more expedient
in science than in rehgion ; and for all to recognize what a
variety of alternatives is possible, and then for each to work
his own theory for all it is worth (and no more !), seems the
poHcy most hkely to conduce to progress in Psychical Research.

ONE CROWDED HOUR OF GLORIOUS LIFE."
BY J. G. PIDDINGTON.
The complexity of cross-correspondences makes them diffi-
cult things both to present and to follow. If they are
simplified too much, their true nature is misrepresented,
and their value as evidence of intricate supernormal
activity improperly diminished. The cross-correspondences
embedded in the scripts of our group of automatists are
not simple things ; neither are they neat and compact,
but extend themselves all over the place, intersecting and
dovetailing with one another, so that it is hard to say
where a given instance begins and where it ends. Years
ago, when they were first observed, it was an easier
matter to deal with them, because we then supposed
each cross-correspondence to be an isolated thing, and to
be confined within narrow bounds ; and we had little or
no suspicion of their ramifications, and of their inter-
lacings with each other.
Were I to attempt to trace in a single paper the devious
course of a cross-correspondence from its source in the
scripts, say, of 1901, to the point it has reached in, say,
1926, few readers would have the patience to accompany
me to the end of the journey, and I shall therefore confine
myself to rendering an account of a section of a cross-
correspondence, a part of a much larger puzzle. At the
same time I must emphasise the point that it is only a
section. I must also explain that I have not found it
possible to cut it out from its matrix without some
ragged ends adhering to it ; and that about these ragged
ends, when I do not ignore them, I am obliged for
brevity's sake to make statements unsupported by detailed
^evidence.

The section of a cross-correspondence which forms the
subject of this paper is extracted from the scripts of
three automatists, Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Salter, and Mrs.
Willett.
It being convenient for purposes of reference for a paper
to bear a distinctive title, I have called this one " One
Crowded Hour of Glorious Life." I have chosen that
quotation as a title, not because it epitomizes or suggests
the main lines of thought running through the concordant
scripts better than would several other phrases found in
them, but because it so happens that within a short
interval of time it occurred in the scripts of the three
automatists independently : that is to say, without any
one of them knowing of its occurrence in the script of
the others.
Moreover, being myself unable to resist the conclusion
that many of the coincidences between the scripts of our
group of automatists are due to some one's intelligent
design, and are not to be set down to chance, to common
associations of ideas or to unmethodical, meandering,
telepathic interchange, I assume that this three-fold repeti-
tion of " One crowded hour of glorious life " is meant to
indicate a connexion between the three different contexts
in which it was inserted. " One crowded hour," though the
most salient, is not, however, the only link between the
scripts to be discussed ; other links are " The paths of
glory lead but to the grave," certain allusions to Achilles,
and quotations from Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the
Duke of Wellington.
The scripts in question are as follows :

The cross-correspondence proper, if I may so term it,
is confined to the scripts marked D to K, Script L forming,
as it were, an appendix to it. Scripts B, C, and M
are included in the series, because they give the clue to
the meaning of " He gave his bridle reins a shake " in
Script E, and of " Boot saddle to horse and away " in
Script I, and show that these two quotations are early
emergences of the Claverhouse topic.
Script A contains the first reference to
" Not once or twice in our rough island-story,
The path of duty was the way to glory "
;
and 1 have had it printed with the other scripts, because
it was seen by Mrs. Willett before she made in Script K
a probable allusion to these lines in the form " the way
to highest glory leads but to the grave," which looks like
a mix-up of " The paths of glory lead but to the grave
"
and " The path of duty was the ivay to glory." Mrs.
Salter likewise saw Script A before any of her contribu-
tions to the cross-correspondence were made. She, how-
ever, never quotes or refers to the Tennyson lines. I
think it will be agreed that beyond the bare fact that
Script A had referred to these lines, neither Mrs. Willett
nor Mrs. Salter covdd have derived any hints of value
from the context in which they there appear.
Mrs. Verrall in Script D puts together " Not once or
twice in our rough island-story " and " The paths of
glory lead but to the grave " ; while Mrs. Salter in Script
F puts together " The paths of glory," etc., and " One
crowded hour of glorious life " ; Mrs. Willett finally, in
Script K, jiutting together " One crowded hour " and
" The way to highest glory leads but to the grave."
When Mrs. Salter wrote Script F she had not seen the
first part of Script D, and when Mrs. Willett wrote
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 351
Script K she had not seen either the first part of Script D
or any part of Script F. They had both seen the second
part of Script D from " Now write this " to the end ; but
I do not see how this part of the script could have
suggested to one the combination of The paths of glory,"
etc., with One crowded hour," or to the other the
combination of " One crowded hoiu' " with " The way to
highest glory leads but to the grave."
Meanwhile, as if to lay stress upon it, " One crowded
hour of glorious life," which had appeared first in Mrs.
Salter's Script F, is repeated sixteen days later in Mrs.
VerraU's Script G, and then again repeated some six months
later in Mrs. Willett's Script K.
I want to draw attention to only one other verbal
coincidence, and to that one because it is possibly due to
a normal cause. Mrs. VerraU's Script H has " Then dust
to dust With moth and rust," while Mrs. Salter's Script J
has " dust to dust " and " Lay not up to yourselves
treasure upon earth " ; —the original context of the second
phrase involving a reference to " moth and rust." Mrs.
Salter had been told of " Script H by Mrs. Verrall on
August 24, 1910, i.e. some six weeks before Script J was
written. " Told of " means, not that the text of the
script was shown, but that its general import was revealed.
But even if we assume that Mrs. Salter saw the full text,
though it will account for the verbal coincidence, it will
not, in my view at least, serve to account for the far
more striking coincidences of thought between Script J
a,nd Mrs. VerraU's jDrevious scripts.
It will be convenient at this point to state what other infor-
mation about each other's scripts the automatists possessed.
On June 4, 1910, ]\Irs. Salter was shown ScrijDt G, and
on June 5, 19)0, Mrs. Verrall saw Scripts E and F. This
may sound as if a lot of information was given away,
which might account for at least some of the coincidences
between the automatists. That is not my view ;
and, if
the reader will make a careful study of the scripts, keeping
well in mind the dates when they were written and the
dates when information about some of them was communi-
cated, I believe it will not be his view either.
352 J. G. Piddmgton [part
Henceforward I shall be able to proceed without having
to stop eyery now and again to state what knowledge of
each other's scripts the automatists acquired at various
times ; for I have given all the relevant information on
that head.i That information is derived from records
kept by Mrs. Verrall ; and those members who know how
scrupulous she was in such matters, will, I think, feel
assured that no essential information has been omitted
or withheld.
So far I have touched only on the verbal coincidences
between the scripts, and have said nothing about the
coincidences of thought where there is no coincidence of
language. These I will do my best to bring out by
means of a running commentary, in the course of which
I shall at the same time give the literary sources of
most of the quotations in the scripts, and cite or sum-
marize the contexts of these quotations.
" The Paths of Glory lead but to the Grave."
The source of this is Gray's Elegy in a Country Church-
yard :
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Await alike th' inevitable hour :
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
This quotation first appeared in Mrs. Verrall's Script
and she made the following note on the original script :
" Wolfe had been mentioned at dinner. These words
are said to have been Wolfe's last."
1 1 do not count as rdemnt information tlie fact that Script B was
seen by Mrs. Verrall on September 26, 190S, and by Mrs. Willett on
February 26, 1909, or the fact that Script C was seen by Mrs. Verrall
on September 7, 1909 ; for to suppose that the quotations in Script B
could have suggested to both, and the quotations in B and C have
suggested to Mrs. Verrall, '"
One crowded hour of glorious life," seems
to me altogether too far-fetched ; and there is nothing in the contexts
of these quotations to suggest Claverhouse either. Nor do I include
uiider the head of '"
relevant information " the fact that Mrs. Willett
did not see Sci'ipts C, E, F. G. H. I and J, till after the date on which
she wrote Script K.
100] One Croivded Hour of Glorious Life 353
I do not know what authority there is for these words
having been Wolfe's last.^ Whether they actually were,
however, does not matter : the essential point being the
association of them in jVIrs. Verrall's mind with the death
of WoKe. The E7icl. Brit, gives the following version of
Wolfe's last words :
I .
" While he was lying in a swoon some one near him
exclaimed, '
They run ; see how they run !
' '
Who
run ?
'
demanded Wolfe, as one roused from sleep. '
The
enemy,' was the answer ;
'
they give way everywhere.'
Wolfe rallied for a moment, gave a last order for cutting
off the retreat, and murmuring, '
Now God be praised,
I will die in peace,' breathed his last."
Note in this connexion that the first quotation in Mrs.
Salter's script (Script F) of The paths of glory " is
preceded by eV^^aros" Xoyo?, which, though not classical
Greek, may well be good vScript " Greek for the last
words of a dying man. Note also that immediately after
quoting " The paths of glory lead but to the grave
"
Mrs. Salter writes " One crowded hour of glorious life."
" One Crowded Hour."
To Chapter XXXIII. of Old Mortality Scott affixed as
a motto the following lines—long thought to be his own,
but now known not to be :
Sound, sound the clarion, fiU the fife !
To all the sensual world proclaim,
One crowded hour of glorious life
Is worth an age without a name.
It is clear that Scott chose this motto because of its
appropriateness to the sentiments which in Chapter XXXIII.
he puts into the mouth of Claverhouse. Addressing
himself to Morton, who has just been greatly upset by
the sight of bloodshed, Claverhouse says :
But in truth, Mr. Morton, why should we care so much
for death, light upon us or around us whenever it may ?
Men die daily—not a bell tolls the hour but it is the
1 See pp. 372-373 below for the facts.
354 J. G. Piddington [part
death note of some one or other ; and why hesitate
to shorten the span of others, or take over-anxious care
to prolong onr own 1 It is all a lottery .... It is
not the expu-ing pang that is worth thinking of in an
event that must happen one day, and may befall us on
any given moment—it is the memory which the soldier
leaves behind him, like the long train of light that follows
the sunken sun—that is all that is worth caring for,
which distinguishes the death of the brave or the ignoble.
When I think of death, jVIr. Morton, as a thing worth
thinking of, it is in the hope of pressing one day some
well-fought and hard-won field of battle, and dying with
the shout of victory in my ear—that would be worth
dying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for !
Scott, no doubt, in attributing to Claverhouse the hope
of some day dying in the moment of victory, had in mind
the real circumstances of his death. Claverhouse was
mortally wounded at the battle of Killiecrankie, while
leading his Highlanders to victory. As he lay on the
ground he asked :
" How goes the day ?
" of a soldier,
who replied :
" Well for King James, but I am sorry for
your lordship." "If it goes well for him," said Claver-
house, " it matters the less for me."
When in Script L Mrs. Salter repeats " One crowded
hour " she follows it with two quotations : Fame is
the spur " from Milton's Lycidas, which is said to be
" nearer the thought," and " Slowly and sadly we laid
him down " from the Burial of Sir John Moore. The
latter is rejected, not because it is wrong, but because it
merely repeats " the same thoiight." What is the thought
common to all three quotations ? If " One crowded
hour " means, as the evidence shows it to mean, Claver-
house's hope of dying in the moment of victory, then
the parallel with the death of Moore at the end of his
victorious retreat on Corunna is obvious ; and the parallel
with .young Lycidas cut off at the moment when poetic
achievement was about to bring him earthly fame, if not
quite so obvious, is clear enough :
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 355
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes ;
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
Comes the blind Fury with th' abhorred shears.
And slits the thin spun life. But not the praise
Phoebus repli'd.
"Captain, my Captain."
The combination of One crowded hour " with " The
paths of glory lead but to the grave " found in Mrs.
Salter's script, and there associated with the deaths of
Claverhouse, Moore and Lycidas, is reproduced in Mrs.
Willett's script (Script K) ; and it is there associated,
by means of the words " Captain, my Captain," with a
death that struck down, not a soldier nor a scholar and
poet, but a statesman in the verj^ hour of triumph :
0 Captain ! my Captain ! our fearful trip is done.
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won.
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring ;
But 0 heart ! heart ! heart !
0 the bleeding drops of red !
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.
These lines are the first verse of Walt Whitman's
poem on the death of Abraham Lincoln.
Achilles' Choice, and ^oXiKoa-y^iov t^^of-
In Script E Mrs. Salter combines " He gave his bridle
reins a shake "
—which, as we have seen, represents the
Claverhouse topic—with " the giens of Pelion . . . the
tough ashen spear ^oXiKoa-yj-ov ejxoi. war—the rivals face
to face." Some of these phrases refer to Achilles' spear
—
the only spear in the Iliad that was at the same time
iKoa-^iov, ashen, and connected with Mount Pelion :
" the Pehan ashen spear, which Cheiron gave his father,
plucked from a peak of Pelion, to be the death of warriors."
I
356 J. G. Piddington [part
It was with this spear that he slew Hector, the champion
of Troy. The rest of the phrases—viz. " war—the rivals,
face to face"—, as "Achilles' choice" in the very next
script of Mrs. Salter's makes certain, allude to Achilles'
fight with Hector.
In Script F Mrs. Salter combines " The paths of glory
"
and "One crowded hour" with "Achilles' choice."
By " Achilles' choice " is meant his resolve to do battle
with Hector, although, as he well knew, his own death
was fated to befall straightway after Hector's. From
Thetis, his goddess mother, he had learnt that twain
fates were bearing him to the issue of death. He was
free to choose either : he could sail home from Troy,
forgo all chance of fame, and live to a ripe old age ;
or, if he stayed and fought, he could win imperishable
glory, but never see his dear native land again. Rather
than life with dishonour, he chose death with honour,
and he made his choice, I would ask the reader to bear
in mind, believing, or at least fearing, that after death
there followed no life of Elysian bliss, but a forlorn exist-
ence among the phantoms of men outworn.^
This view of the after-life held by Achilles is referred
to, and contradicted, in Script K ; for that is what is
meant by
No Shades but Reality incorporeal,
and by
the capacity of soul which takes visible form in the
Man of Action is not lost at death fight ever fight on.
" Fight ever fight on " is a slightly incorrect quotation
—correctly given elsewhere in Willett script—from Brown-
ing's Epilogue to Asolando :
One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,
Never doubted clouds would break.
Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,.
Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better.
Sleep to wake.
^See Iliad. XXIIT., iio-li, 99-107: XVIII. 121.
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 357
No, at noonday in the bustle of man's work-time,
Greet the unseen v/ith a cheer !
Bid him forward, breast and back as either should be,
"Strive and thrive!" cry "Speed,—fight on, fare ever
There as here !
"
Browning's is a very different outlook from that of the
living Achilles as represented in the Iliad, and still more
so from that of the dead Achilles as represented in the
Odyssey, where he is made to place the very poorest lot
on earth above even Idngship in the shades.
At this point I want for a moment to go outside the
•evidence contained in the particular group of scripts we
are considering, and to say that I believe that " Achilles'
choice " bears in the scripts a double meaning : referring
partly, as explained, to the choice made by the Homeric
Achilles ; and partly to the line of conduct in which
Socrates persisted at his trial, although he knew that it
would almost inevitably involve his being put to death.
In his defence Socrates compared the choice he was
making to Achilles' choice, and having made the com-
parison, he added :
Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, 0 men of Athens,
. . . if . . . now, when, as I conceive, God orders me to
f fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into myself
and other men, I were to desert my post through fear
of death . . . For this fear of death is indeed the pretence
of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being the appearance of
knowng the unkno-wm ; since no one knows whether
death, which they in their fear apprehend to be the
greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.
In this particular passage he speaks of the possibility
of death being the greatest good ; but later on in the
Apology he expresses the hope that after death he will
hold converse with the great heroes of time past and
change replies with all the circle of the wise," and
" above all " be able to continue the pursuit of philosophy
358 J. G. Piddington [part
to which his life on earth had been devoted. Socrates'
choice, then, unhke Achilles', was made in the hope—to
adopt and adapt the language of Script K—that the
capacity of soul which takes visible form, not only in
the Man of Action, but also in the Man of Thought, is
not lost at death.
Tennyson's " Ode on the Death op the Duke op
Wellington."
The thought that the capacity of soul which takes
visible form in the Man of Action is not lost at death
is expressed elsewhere in the scripts under review by
means of quotations from, or allusions to, Tennyson's
" Wellington " Ode. The scripts contain, it is true, only
one explicit and straightforward reference to it, namely
:
" Not once or twice in our rough island-story.
The path of duty was the way to glory '"
;
but I hope to show that " dust to dust—ashes to ashes
"
in Script J is also a quotation from it, and that the
verses which form Script H are a paraphrase of part
of the Ode.
Taking the verses in Script H first, let us compare
them with some passages in Tennyson's Ode :
Script.
Toll, Toll the bell
The echoing knell
That speaks the passing soul.
Then to the skies
Let clamour rise.
Name, title, fame
All he can claim
Honour where honours due.
" Wellington " Ode.
Let the bell be toU'd :
And a deeper knell in the heart be knoll'd ;
And the sound of the sorrowing anthem roll'd
Thro' the dome of the golden cross . . .
And thro' the centuries let a people's voice
In full acclaim,
A people's voice,
The proof and echo of all human fame,
A people's voice when they rejoice
At civic revel and pomp and game.
Attest their great commander's claim
With honour, honour, honour, honour to him.
Eternal honour to his name . . .
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 359
Till in all lands and thro' all human story
The path of duty be the way to glory :
And let the land whose hearths he saved from sham©
For many and many an age proclaim
At civic revel and pomp and game.
And when the long-illumined cities flame,
Their ever-loyal iron leader's fame,
With honour, honour, honour, honour to him.
Eternal honour to his name . . .
Let the bell be toll'd :
And a reverent people behold
The towering car, the sable steeds :
Bright let it be with its blazon'd deeds,
Dark in its funeral fold ...
Hush, the Dead March wails in the people's ears :
The dark crowd moves, and there are sobs and tears t
The black earth yawns : the mortal disappears ;
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
When " dust to dust—ashes to ashes " appears m Mrs.
Salter's Script J, it is immediately preceded by a reference
to the following passage in the Sermon on the Mount :
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where
moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break
through and steal : But lay ujd for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves do not break through nor steal : For
where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
With this combination of " Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth " and " dust to dust—ashes to ashes,"
let us compare the contexts of " The path of duty was
the way to glory " and of " Ashes to ashes " in the
Tennyson Ode :
Not once or twice in oiu? rough island-story.
The path of duty was the way to glory :
He that walks it, only thirsting
For the right, and learns to deaden
Love of self, before his journey closes,
He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting
Into glossy purples, which outredden
AU voluptuous garden-roses.
Then dust to dust
'With moth and rust
'Writ in the graven scroll.
Tears will be shed
Tears for the dead.
360 G. Piddington [part
Not once or twice in our fair island-story
The path of duty was the way to glory :
He, that ever following her commands,
On with toil of heart and knees and hands.
Thro' the long gorge to the far light has won
His path upward, and prevail'd,
Shall find the toppling crags of Duty scaled
Are close upon the shining table-lands
To which our God Himself is moon and sun.
Such was he : his work is done.
O peace, it is a day of pain
For one, upon whose hand and heart and brain
Once the weight and fate of Europe hung !
Ours the pain, be his the gain ! . . . .
While we hear
The tides of Music's golden sea
Setting toward eternity.
Uplifted high in heart and hope are we,
Until we doubt not that for one so true
There must be other nobler work to do
Than when he fought at Waterloo,
And Victor he must ever be.
On God and Godlike men we build our trust.
Hush, the Dead March wails in the people's ears :
The dark crowd moves, and there are sobs and tears :
The black earth yawns : the mortal disappears ;
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
;
He is gone who seem'd so great
—
Gone ; but nothing can bereave him
Of the force he made his own
Being here, and we believe him
Something far advanced in State,
And that he wears a truer crown
Than any wi'eath that man can weave him.
To adopt once more the language of Script K, where
seems to be applied to Lincoln in particular, such
100] One Croivded Hour of Glorious Life 361
capacity of soul as took visible form in the Duke of
Wellington cannot be lost at death.
But this doctrine is not confined in the scripts under
review to Men of Action such as Wellington and Lincoln.
It is asserted also of Men of Thought : of Milton's
^'learned friend" young Lycidas, of Robert Browning
the poet, and, for reasons which I will now give, of men
of the type of Frederic Myers.
"To DARE AND AGAIX TO DARE " AND AlL THAT I
STROVE TO BE."
In Script I the Claverhouse topic, which is represented
there by " Boot saddle to horse and away," is followed by
" To dare and again to dare."
This is a reference partly to the closing lines of Myers's
Passing of Youth, and partly to a passage near the end
of Myers's Fragments of Inner Life. The lines in the
Passing of Youth I need not quote, because their point
is sufficiently given by the passage in Fragments, which
runs thus :
I am well aware that my temper is in disaccord with
that of Buddha, of Cleanthes, of Marcus Aurelius. This
' passionate affirmation of the will to live " as Schopen-
hauer would call it . . . makes the essence of my
being ....
I know that my nature imperatively craves what the
nature of Marcus Antoninus did not crave,—a personal,
an unbounded, an endless career of life and joy.
Yes, and I believe, as against a.11 Stoic and Buddhist
creeds, that this temper of mine, however much of
chastening it still may need, may yet be that which best
subserves the cosmic aim ; which helps the Universe in
its passage and evolution into fuller and higher life. To
be purged, not dulled, is what we need : to intensify each
his own being, a pulse of the existence of the All.
We need ... a summons "to no houri-haunted paradise,
no passionless contemplation, no monotony of prayer and
j)raise ; but to endless advance by endless effort, and, if
362 /. G. Piddington [part
need Ije, by endless pain." Be it mine, then, to plunge
among the unknown Destinies, to dare and still to dare !
The Claverhouse topic and " To dare and again to
dare " in Script I are preceded by
" All that I strove to be."
This, as other scripts of Mrs. Salter's show, is an at-
tempt at
" What I aspired to be
"
in Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra : the misquotation being
due partly to confusion with " All I could never be
"
in the same poem, and partly to a connexion of thought
with the stanza immediately preceding the one in which
" What I aspired to be " occurs. If I quote these two
stanzas, it will be seen why Script I associates Myers's
" to dare and still to dare " with them :
Then, welcome each rebuff
That turns earth's smoothness rough,
Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go !
Be our joys three-parts pain !
Strive, and hold cheap the strain ;
Learn, nor account the pang ;
dare, never grudge the throe !
For thence,—-a paradox
Which comforts while it mocks,
—
Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail
;
What I aspired to be.
And was not, comforts me :
A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale.
The second of these two stanzas is closely connected
with the two following later stanzas :
Therefore I summon age
To grant youth's heritage,
Life's struggle having so far reached its term :
Then shall I pass ajoproved
A man, for age removed
From the developed brute ; a god though in the germ.
100] One Croivded Hour of Glorious Life 363
And I shall thereupon
Take rest, ere I be gone
Once more on my adventure brave, and new :
Fearless and unperplexed,
When I wage battle next,
What weapons to select, what armour to indue.
The reader should bear these stanzas from Rabbi ben
Ezra in mind while he reads the following phrases that
form part of Script I :
All that I strove to be . . . Boot saddle to horse and
away Reck not of danger if the prize be fair On to
the battle warrior do and dare To dare and again to
dare— lo/j-ev that is the key note lofxev
" Do and dare " is not exactly a reference to, but
answers to Browning's " dare, never grudge the throe "
;
and in the same way t'o^ei' answers to " nor sit nor
stand but go !
"
"Yofxev.
"lojuev, which means " let us go "—in the sense, that is,
of " let us go forward "—is a reference to a famous passage
in the twelfth Iliad, where Sarpedon, using the argument of
" noblesse oblige,'' tells his peer and comrade Glaucus
that it behoves them both to take their stand and fight
in the foremost ranks of the Lycians, whose chieftains
they are.
A translation of the essential part of Sarpedon's speech
is to be found in a passage in Jebb's Romanes Lecture,
in the course of which he told the following story in
illustration of the valvie of classical studies and literature
in training statesman :
In 1762, at the end of the Seven Years' War, Robert
Wood—he himself tells the story in his " Essay on the
Original Genius of Homer "—being then an Under-Secretary
of State, took the preliminary articles of the Treaty of
Paris to the President of the Council, Lord Granville,
who was lU, and had indeed but a few days to live.
Seeing what his condition was, Wood proposed to with-
364 J. G. Piddington [part
draw ; but the Statesman replied that it could not pro-
long his life to neglect his diity, and then quoted in
Greek from the Iliad the words of Sarpedon to Glaucus :
" Ah, friend, if once escaped from this battle, we were
ever to be ageless and immortal, I wordd not myself
fight in the foremost ranks, nor would I send thee into
the war that giveth men renown ; but now—since ten
thousand fates of death beset us every way, and these
no mortal may escape nor avoid
—
now let us go forward."
" He repeated the last word '/o/xei^ several times," says
Wood, " with calm and determined resignation, and then,
after a pause, asked to hear the treaty read."
I do not claim—I am not sure that I even think
—
that Script I is referring to this story ; but I am sure
that it illustrates the meaning of the script's hiuep.
We may compare with the spirit of the Granville
anecdote " The path of duty was the way to glory,"
Claverhouse's speech to Morton, and particularly, I think,
" 0 Captain ! my Captain !
" in Script K.
I pass on now to deal with a few small points.
Script G opens with the name " Oxenham." I believe
it to be one of a very small number of references in
scripts to Kingsley's Westward Ho I I do not understand
the point of the reference, if such it be ; but that is not
a reason for dismissing it as meaningless.
Nor can I throw any light on the following passage in
Script G:
Better have had the—then leave the blank space for
another to fill— And overcome it Than to have lost the
memory of such power
I suspect it to be a literary reference ; and if any of
my readers can trace it I hope he will let me know. A
possible point of connexion between this crjrptic phrase
and its context on the one hand and Script F on the
other should be noted.
Script G has :
One crowded hour of glorious life. And again Better
have had the . . . and overcome it,
I
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 365
while Script F has :
One crowded hour of glorious life—Achilles' choice
—
better so.
In Script E the name " Medea " crops up between
" the glens of Pelion " and references to Achilles' spear.
It is possible that " Medea " is a meaningless association of
ideas, which intruded itself during the emergence of the
idea of Achilles' spear ; for it was on Pelion that Medea
plucked the herbs " that did renew old Aeson," and on
Pelion likewise that Cheiron plucked the ash from which
Achilles' spear was made. At the same time there are
several references in the scripts to Medea's herbs, and it
may be that some connexion is intended between them
and the Achilles topic ; but if so I have no explanation
to offer.
The extract from Script K opens with the words :
Sound the trumpets Beat the not ploughshares
The general sense is plain : namely, that martial exploits,
not the achievements of peace, are the theme. The
phraseology is reminiscent partly of Isaiah ii. 4, or Micah
iv. 3, or Joel iii. 10, and partly of Dryden's Alexanders
Feast :
The joUy god [Bacchus] in Triumph comes ;
Sound the Trumpets ; beat the Drtims.
The script, however, is referring to War, not to Bacchus ;
and the line about Bacchus has simply been used to suggest
the following verse in another poem of Dryden's, his
Song for St. Cecilia's Day :
The Tkumpets loud Clangor
Excites us to Arms,
With shrill notes of anger
And mortal alarms.
The double, double, double beat
Of the thund'ring Dkxjm
Cryes, heark the Foes come ;
Charge, Charge, 'tis too late to retreat.
366 J. G. Piddington [part
In this same script—K—the words "from white Cloud
free" belong to the preceding "No Shades but Reality in-
corporeal " ; "If you will from white Cloud free " meaning :
" If you prefer, instead of '
Reahty incorporeal ' you can
say '
from white Cloud free '."
The expression is taken from Blake's Little Black Boy,
and means simply " when this mortal shall have put on
immortality," the Cloud symbolizing the body which
vanishes at death and no longer envelops the soul.
Blake's poem is about two little boys, one black and the
other white ; their bodies being spoken of respectively
as a black cloud and a white one. In Script K " from
white Cloud free " is used in just the same sense as in
the poem ; but " there were Black Clouds too," though of
course suggested by the poem, seems to bear a different
sense, and to serve as a transition to the idea of a great
national danger or disaster, such as the American Civil
War,—or at least that is how I read the context :
there were Black Clouds too and much pestilence Cap-
tain my Captain But the end was not yet,
the " pestilence " and " the end was not yet " being
reminiscences of the " wars and rumours of wars " passage
in the Gospels. This interpretation anyhow suits the
next paragraph of the script (not included in the extract
printed on p. 349 above), which explicitly refers to the
Battle of Philippi, one of the great battles of the Roman
CivU Wars.
We have here a good example of what I have called
a " ragged end," for " there were Black Clouds too
"
marks a point where the " One crowded hour " train of
thought branches oS into another train.
I turn now to Script D. It will be remembered that
the second part of this script, from " Now write this
"
down to the end, was shown to Mrs. Salter and Mrs.
Willett before either of them made her contribution to
the cross-correspondence.
Whether the words about a search beginning in fear
and ending in joy have some definite application I do
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 367
not know ; but at any rate they obviously lead up to
the assertion that
as long as there is life there is neither beginning nor
end—only continuous development
;
and this assertion, especially considering the quotation
from the Wellington " Ode that precedes it, we may,
I think, regard as expressing in general terms the doctrine
formulated later in a less general way, that " the capacity
of soul that takes visible form in the Man of Action is
not lost at death.''
Mrs. Verrall communicated this part of her script to
Mrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett, because she fancied that
it might relate to a matter in which both of them felt
a personal interest. Whether it did or not—and, speaking
for myself, I do not believe it had the slightest relation
—
I can assure the reader that the meaning tentatively read
into the second part of Script D by Mrs. Verrall bears
not the remotest resemblance to the meaning which
collation of this script with the other scripts under review
has led me to place upon it. Had the ivhole script been
-
communicated to Mrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett, it is con-
ceivable that both might, consciously or subconsciously,
have traced the connexion between not once or twice
in our rough island-story " and the thought of death
proving no bar to the development of talents and capa-
cities possessed and displayed in this life. But the whole
script was not shown them ; and we must therefore look
elscM^here for an explanation of the coincidences between
Script D on the one hand and Mrs. Salter's and Mrs.
Willett's scripts on the other.
\
Leading Ideas.
It remains for me to try to state what are the leading
ideas traceable in the group of scripts before us ;
and
how they are distributed between the three automatists.
I take first Death with Honour. It is illustrated
by Achilles' Choice (peculiar to Mrs. Salter's script), and
by Claverhouse's speech to Morton, referred to by all
three automatists by means of " One crowded hour of
368 J. G. Piddington [part
glorious life." If, by " Achilles' Choice " allusion is
intended as well to the death of Socrates, his would be
another example of Death with Honour.
Another leading idea is that of Duty done in the face
of pain or despair, of mortal danger or of certain death.
This is illustrated by Sarpedon's, and possibly by Granville's,
'!ofj.ev ;
by the "Dare and still to dare" passages in
Myers's Passing of Youth and Fragments of Inner Life,
and by Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra. These illustrations
are confined to Mrs. Salter's script.
A third leading idea is that of Death in the moment of
victory or achievement. Illustrations of this are Claver-
house's speech to Morton, common to all three automatists ;
the Death of Lincoln, found only in Mrs. Willett's script ;
the Death of Moore at Corunna, and the Death of Lycidas,
peculiar to Mrs. Salter ; the Death of Wolfe, associated
by Mrs. Verrall only with " The paths of glory lead but
to the grave " ; and the Death of Achilles, implicit in
the reference to Achilles' Choice. I rather suspect that
Death in the moment of Victory is what is really implied
by " The paths of glory lead but to the grave." This
is not, of course, the meaning of the words in Gray's
Elegy ; but scripts on their own admission, if such an
expression may pass, not infrequently use quotations
in a sense other than their original sense.
The last of these leading ideas that I have to mention
may be thus expressed :
" Death does not end or interrupt
men's activities ; but on the contrary offers new and
greater opportunities for the exercise of enhanced powers
of work." Of this thought there is a considerable variety
of expressions :
(1) Browning's Epilogue to Asolamlo (Mrs. Willett only)
(2)
" The end is after all only a beginning—and as long
as there is life there is neither beginning nor end—only
continuous development " (Mrs. Verrall only) ;
(3) Ode 071 the Death of the Duke of Wellington (Mrs.
Verrall and Mrs. Salter) ;
(4)
" The capacity of soul which takes visible form in
the Man of Action is not lost at death. ... No Shades,,
but Reality incorporeal " (Mrs. Willett only) ;
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 369
(5) Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra (Mrs. Salter only) ;
(6) The " dare and still to dare " passages in Myers's
writings (Mrs. Salter only) ;
(7) Possibly " Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth " (Mrs. Salter only) ;
and I may remind the reader in this connexion of the
hope of which Socrates spoke during his trial of being
able to continue his pursuit of philosophy after death.
Concluding Remarks.
% No one outside a lunatic asylum would deny the existence-
of at any rate most of the coincidences between the
scripts under review, or would attribute them to chance.
Though it would not be quite so absurd to attribute
them to fraudulent conspiracy between the automatists,
I shall assume that there is no need to discuss that
hypothesis, until at least some one has been bold enough
to advance it. A less unreasonable hypothesis would be
that the coincidences are the result of unfair selection by
the commentator, who, ranging over a mass of scripts,
has arbitrarily picked out one here and another there,
his choice having been guided by a desire—conscious or
subconscious—to make a pretty story out of the batch.
I would most readily allow that any commentator possessed
of much patience and of a modicum of ingenuity, especially
if unhampered by scruples, could concoct any number of
pretty stories out of the scripts. I would myself under-
take, for a sufficiently attractive reward in hard cash,
to discover in the scripts the story of the Tichborne
Case or of the Third Crusade or of Ahce in Wonderland,
or evidence of the Baconian authorship of Shakespeare's
Plays, provided that I was free to pick and choose such
scripts, and particularly such fragments of scripts, as
suited my purpose, in an arbitrary way : that is to say,
regardless of whether there was evidence of some bond
between the scripts and fragments so selected other than
that created by my own fanciful theory.
But the cross-correspondences published in Proceedings
are not the product of arbitrary selection. I have
370 J. G. Piddington [part
endeavoured to set forth on pp. 443-451, 457-459 of Proc.
Vol. XXXIII. some of the rules which we observe in this
matter ; and these rules not only follow the instructions
as to the grouping of scripts explicitly or implicitly laid
down iia the scripts themselves, but are also, I venture to
think, in accordance with common-sense and logic.
The scripts dealt with in this paper are thirteen in
number, and for the purpose of easy reference are marked,
according to their chronological order, A. B, C, etc.,
down to M. The reasons for grouping together these
thirteen scripts may be thus stated ;
i|
F is joined to G, K and L because all have the quota-
tion " One crowded hour of glorious life."
F is joined to E because both allude to Achilles.
E is joined to C and M because all three have " He
gave his bridle reins a shake."
M has " the cavalier's song—to horse and away," a
quotation from the third of Browning's Cavalier
Tunes, " Boot and Saddle," found also in B and
I, which are accordingly joined to M.
F has ' the paths of glory lead but to the grave,"
found also in D and J, which are therefore joined
to F.
D has " Not once or twice in our rough island-story,"
previously quoted in A, which is therefore joined
to D.
J has " dust to dust " found also in H, which is
accordingly joined to J.
Everyone of the thirteen scripts from A to M is
accounted for in this list.
But let us test the matter in another way. The thirteen
scripts include
(a) the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th occurrence in all the
scripts of all the automatists - of " One crowded
hour of glorious life " (see F, G, K, and L.) ;
II mean by this not merely in all Mrs. VerralJ's, Mrs. Salter's and
Mrs. Willett's scripts, but in all the scrijjts of the whole group of S.P.R.
automatic writers.
iOO] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 371
(6) the 1st and 2nd occurrence in all the scripts of all
the automatists of Not once or twice in our
rough island-story " (see A and D) ;
(c) the 1st, 2nd. 3rd and 4th occurrence in all the
scripts of all the automatists of " The paths of
glory lead but to the grave " (see D, F, J and K) ;
{d) the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th allusion
(" Boot and Saddle," " He gave his bridle reins a
shake," and One crowded hour " being sq
accounted) to Claverhouse (see B. C. E. G. I. K,
L and M).
This hst leaves every one of the thirteen scripts
accounted for except H, and the reasons for including H
are given on pp. 358-359 above.
In the face of these facts can it be plausibly argued
either that the thirteen scripts have been selected arbi-
trarily ; or that the interval of time—August 3, 1909, to
Nov. 13, 1910—that separates the first from the last of the
scripts constituting the cross-correspondence proper is so
long as to diminish to any serious degree the force of the
coincidences ?
There remain two other hjiDotheses ;
one, that the
coincidences were mainly, if not entirely, due to some
supernormal cause ; the other, that they were the result
of a normal cause : namely, a certain amount of know-
ledge of each other's scripts normally acquired by the
automatists. An advocate of this last hypothesis would
have to start from the following facts :
(1) the knowledge of Script A acquired by ilrs. Salter
in 1907, and by Mrs. Willett in 1909 ;
(2) the knowledge of the second part of Script D
acquired by Mrs. Willett in Oct. 1909, and by
]\Irs. Salter ui Nov. 1909 ;
(3) some acquaintance with the subject of Script H
acquired by ]\Irs. Salter on Aug. 24, 1910 ;
(4) the knowledge of Scripts E and F acquired by Mrs.
Verrall on June 5, 1910 ; and
(5) the knowledge of Script G acquired by Mrs. Salter
on June 4, 1910.
372 J. G. Piddington [part
He would then have to show how the possession of
this information enabled the automatists to develop
certain similar or identical trains of thought ; aid, tO'
make his argument plausible, he would have to trace the
process step by step. I do not envy our imaginary
advocate his task, and I fear he is likely to remain
imaginary. But should he present himself, I should be
very curious to learn his explanation of the appearance
in the scripts of all three automatists of " One crowded
liour of glorious life," and especially, perhaps, his explana-
tion of Script K. Meanwhile, until detailed explanation
on normal lines is forthcoming, I shall prefer to believe
that the coincidences were either due to some remarkable
form of telepathic interchange between the automatists,
or else were the work of some directing intelligence,
operating on them ab extra. And of these two theories I
prefer the second.
Ma^J 25, 1926.
Postscript.
Except for some merely verbal changes and for the
addition on pp. 369-370 above of a passage dealing with the
question of manufacturing coincidences by arbitrary
selection of scripts, the foregoing paper is printed as
originally written in May 1926. In the following July
I came across a passage in A. G. Bradley's Wolfe which
has a bearing on Sarpedon's 'lo/uei/ if taken in connexion
with " The paths of glory lead but to the grave." As
mentioned on p. 352 above, Mrs. Verrall assumed " The
paths of glory lead but to the grave " to have been the
last words spoken by Wolfe. Though I knew that there
was a story to the effect that shortly before his death
Wolfe had said he would rather have written Gray's
Elegy than take Quebec, I did not trouble to ascertain
what authority, if any, there might be for these words
from the Elegy having been the last spoken by Wolfe,
because I thought (and I still think) that the essential
point is the association in Mrs. VerralVs mind of these
words with the death of Wolfe.
100] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 373
It appears to be certain that Wolfe did quote " The
paths of glory " and its context shortly before the battle
on the i
Plains of Abraham ; but the precise momeiat is
uncertain. It is, however, certain that these were not
his last words.
^
I suggested on p. 368 above that " The paths of glory
lead but to the grave " stands for Death in the moment
of Victory ; while I took Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus
—
the 'lofxev speech—to be an illustration of Duty done
in the face of pain or despair, of mortal danger or of
certain death ;
- and though I did not directly and explicitly
connect it with the The paths of glory," I think I
made it plain that Sarpedon's 'lonev and " The paths of
glory " belong to the same range of ideas. But that
there was any historical ground for associating Sarpedon's
speech to Glaucus with ^'
The paths of glory " was quite
unknown to me till in July 1926 I read for the first time
the last paragraph of A. G. Bradley's Wolfe, which runs thus :
In the pocket of the coat in wliich he fell was found
a sheet of paper containing these lines from Pope's version
1 The following extract from a letter which Mrs, Salter wrote me on
June 24, 1926, after i-eading my jDaper in MS., shows that at one time
Mrs. Verrall knew that The paths of glory were, not Wolfe's last words :
" I am rather puzzled at my mother's note to Script D that "
The
paths of glory,' etc., are said to have been 'Wolfe's last words. No
doubt that is what she thought when she wrote the note, but I have
a perfectly distinct and vivid recollection of hearing my mother, many
years ago, when I was a child, tell to me and to some other children
what I believe to be the true story about 'Wolfe and Gray's Elegy.
The story was that when he was on his way across the river for the
^issault on Quebec, 'Wolfe read (or spoke) that particular verse to the
officers standing round him, and said :
'
I would rather have written
those lines. Gentlemen, than take Quebec' And that is why the last
line, The paths of glory lead but to the grave,' was inscribed on his
tombstone. (If not on the tombstone, then on some memorial to
'Wolfe ; I am not clear on this point) . . .
This . . . seems to me worth mentioning, because it shows that there
was a clear association between Wolfe and the line from Gray's Elegy not
only in my mother's mind (which you mention), but also in my mind."
- " Duty done in the face of pain or despair, of mortal danger or of
-certain death can be applied with cui'ious exactness to the behaviour
of Wolfe during the last weeks of his life. When I -wrote the words,
however, I was not thinking of W^olfe.
374 J. G. Piddington [part
of Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus in the tweKth book of
the Iliad. Whether the variations from the origmal are
due to the accident of his having transcribed the Hnes
from memory, or from his having altered them to suit
his own mood, must be uncertain ; but never surely has-
a memorable passage been illustrated in a fashion so
striking and so glorious.
But since, alas ! ignoble age must come.
Disease, and death's inexorable doom,
That life which others pay, let us bestow.
And give to fame what we to nature owe,
Brave let us fall, or honoured if we live.
Or let us glory gain, or glory give.
Such, men shall own. deserve a sovereign state,
Envied by those who dare not imitate.^
It seems, then, probable that '/o/xei' in Script I includes
an allusion to Wolfe's death, and that it should be con-
nected with the four quotations of " The paths of glory
lead but to the grave " in Scripts D, F, J, and K.
To illustrate the general meaning of (o/xer I cited from
Jebb's Romanes Lecture the story of Lord Granville's
quoting Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus, when the pre-
liminary articles of the Treaty of Paris were brought to
him for consideration during his mortal illness. It was
this Treaty of Paris which settled the affairs of Europe
at the close of the Seven Years' War ; and of this
War Wolfe's capture of Quebec was one of the out-
standing events. It is strange that there should be this
two-fold association of the Seven Years' War with Sar-
pedon's speech.^ That the intelligence responsible for the
^ I have examined five or six different Lives of Wolfe, and none
of them gives this story except Bradley. The writer of the article
" Wolfe in the Diet, of National Biograph'j makes a very brief reference
to it. Mrs. Salter tells me that she had never heard the story, and
has never read A. G. Bradley's Wolfe.
2 Robert Wood, the original authority for the story about Granville,
ends his account thus .
" After a serious pause of some minutes, he desired to hear the
Treaty read, to which he listened with great attention, and recovered
spirits enough to declare the approbation of a dying statesman (I use

but it seems to me highly probable that it knew the
association with Wolfe, and possible that it knew the
association with Granville.^
his own. words) '
on the most glorious war. and most honourable peace,
this nation ever saw.'
This suggests that Sarpedon's speech was associated in Granville's-
mind, not only with his own condition, but with the Seven Years' War.
^ Although when she first read my paper in MS. Mrs. Salter did
not remember the Granville story, it is practically certain that she had
once read it. Sir Lawrence Jones, when my paper was read at a.
Private Meeting of the S.P.R., pointed out that the story is told in
Matthew Arnold's On Translating HoniPr ; and a few days later Mrs.
Salter wrote to tell me that, as she had read Arnold's book in her
college days, she must once have known the story. She informed me
later that the Granville anecdote is given in the second edition of Walter
Leafs Iliad published in 1900, which she thinks she has made use of. She
has, however, no conscious recollection of having read it in this Ijook.
\ATiile it is thus practically certain that Mrs. Salter had at one time
known of the association of Sarpedon's 'ioixiv with Granville, she has
no recollection of having loiown of its association with Wolfe ; and
it is to the association with Wolfe that the scrijjts point. Not that
it matters one way or the other ; for even if it were certain that
Mrs. Salter had once upon a time Imown of the association with Wolfe,
this would not make it any easier to explain the coincidences between
the scripts in a normal way.

I. An Outline of Abiiortnal Psychologij. By William M'Dougall,
F.R.S. London: Methuen & Co. Ltd. Pp. xvi + 572.
Price 15s. net.
This book will be welcomed by students of both normal and
abnormal psychology. It is a complement to the author's
well-known Oufliae of Psi/chology, and the two A^olumes are to
be regarded as parts of one work. The inclusion of abnormal
psychology in a work on general psji-chology is of great advan-
tage to the student, for when he comes to the study of morbid
mental processes he is already acquainted with the author's
outlook on all questions of normal psychology. The importance
of this is particularly great in a science like psychology, in
which, even u]Jon fundamental principles, there is still so much
difference of opinion.
This book is not a text-book of psychiatry or of psycho-
therapeutics. Its standpoint is that of the student of human
nature and human behaviour. The author is not concerned
with the classification of diseases or with the psychology of
definite clinical types of mental disorder. He deals rather with
types of abnormal mental j^rocess, such as dissociation, halluci-
nation, delusion, and seeks to understand them in terms of the
general principles laid down in the earlier volume. He dis-
cusses such topics as hypnosis and suggestion, conflict and
repression, autoniatisms and somnambulisms, not from the point
of view of medical practice but from that of psychological
theory.
Dr. M"Dougall gives an outline of the various schools of
abnormal psychology existing at the present time, and declares
himself more in accord with the views of the psycho-analytical
school than with those of any other well-marked group. The
pure mechanists and behaviourists are anathema to him ;
ICO] Revieivs 311
Janet's intellectualistic and sensationist descriptions and inter-
pretations of abnormal mental phenomena are the product of a
system of psychology against which Dr. M'Dougall has long
protested ;
only when psycho-jDathologists describe disorderly
mental process in terms of a hormic or purposive psychology
does he consider their work to be truly fruitful. Therefore he
believes that Professor Freud has done more for the advance-
ment' of psychology than a,ny student since Aristotle." Yet he
by no means accepts all Freud's teaching, and a great part of
the book consists of a running commentary on his views,
especially those to which Dr. M'Dougall is most strongly
opposed. He thinks both Freud and Adler are addicted to the
vice of over-generalization and exaggeration in the exposition of
their theories, and that Jung has given psycho-analytic theory
a turn in the right direction. But Dr. M'Dougall is not a
Jungian and he is not a Freudian. He afhliates himself to a
group, represented in America by Dr. Morton Prince and in
England by the late Dr. Rivers, who have seen both the truths
and the errors of Freud's teaching, and have sought to incor-
porate the truths in the general body of psychological science.
There are several sections of the book which are of special
interest to students of psj^chical research. There are three
chapters dealing with hypnosis and the theories of hypnosis and
suggestion ; three chapters in which are discussed such topics
as dissociation, repression, and automatisms ; and five chapters
devoted to multiple personality and the theory of personality
and of its dismtegration.
Dr. M'Dougall's views on the nature of hypnosis and his
theory of suggestion are well kno\An from his former "writings.
He gives here an admirable account of the hypnotic state and
of its most characteristic phenomena. On the theoretical side
he reproduces part of his paper on The State of the Brain
during Hypnosis " which was published in Brain in 1908. He
is of opinion that any theory of the hypnotic state must
consist of t^\o parts : it must describe the condition of the
brain during hypnosis, and it must explain the nature of
rapport. This is, perhaps, to ask too much. In the present
state of our knowledge we can do little more than guess about
the state of the brain during hypnosis, just as we cannot do
much more than guess about the state of the brain during
2b
378 T. W. Mitchell [part
ordinary waking life. We should be content for the present if
we can give an intelligible account of the state of the mind
during hypnosis. To explain the nature of rapjwrt is the
essential problem for any theory of the hypnotic state. Dr.
M'Dougall has arrived at what is practically the same con-
clusion as that put forward by Freud : ra-pport depends upon
the coming into play of an " instinct of submission." These
two authorities differ, however, in so far as Dr. M'Dougall
regards submission as a primary instinct, an irreducible element
of mental life, ^\hile Freud derives submission, in the form of
masochism, from the sexual instinct.
There is an interesting chapter on dissociation in which Dr.
M'Dougall maintains that this process should not be confused
with repression. He points out that since repression has come
to be widely accepted as the chief cause of forgetting, many
writers treat of repression and dissociation as though the two
terms were synonymous. He, on the other hand, thinks there
are good grounds for distinguishing the process of repression
from that of dissociation, as also the state of continued repres-
sion from a continuing state of dissociation. He does not deny
that repression may prepare the way for dissociation, and that
active repression may maintain a dissociation, but he does not
think the evidence warrants the belief that dissociation is
always j^receded by repression. In locahsed dissociation the
onset seems to be, as a rule, sudden, and in many cases it sets
in at the moment of some emotional shock. Dr. M'Dougall's
discussion of this topic is timely, for many students of abnormal
psychology have felt that psycho-analysts have shirked the
problem of the wide differences between the massive dis-
sociations of hysteria and the so-called '
dissociation '
produced
by repression in the other psycho-neuroses and in normal
people.
In dealing with multiple personality Dr. M'Dougall discusses
briefly the alternating type, and at greater length the co-
conscious type and trance personalities. He cites as examples
of alternating personality the case of Mary Reynolds and the
Hanna case ; and he is inclined to include in this class the
cases which Janet calls dominating somnambulisms,"' e.g. his
Leonie, Felida X. and Marcelline. Of co-existing or co-con-
scious personalities he selects the B.C.A. and Beauchamp cases
100] Reviews 379
of Dr. Morton Prince, the case of Maria, recorded by Professor
C. E. Cory, and the Doris Fischer case. In illustration of the
main features of trance personalities he describes shortly
Flournoy's case of Helene Smith.
Dr. M'Dougall enters a protest against the attitude of most
men of science towards the problems raised by trance per-
sonalities. He says that when such men as Henry Sidgwick,
William James, Henri Bergson and Hans Driesch "'
have studied
the evidence over many years and have pronounced themselves
convinced that it is of a nature that demands further careful
study, it is surely a little presumptuous for young scientists
who have never deigned to pay any attention to it to dismiss
it with indifference or contempt."
In his closing chapters on the theory of personality and of
its disintegration Dr. M'Dougall adheres to the monadic view
of personahty which he put before our Society in his presi-
dential address in 1920. Only in this way does he find it
possible to reconcile the two opposing views of personahty
which a study of these cases seems to compel us to accept.
Only by regarding human personality as an integrated system
of monads, arranged in a converging hierarchy with one
supreme monad at the top, is it possible to adopt the view of
the twofold nature of personality which the evidence seems to
force upon us. For Dr. M'Dougall, as for Frederic Myers, each
man is "at once profomidly unitary and almost infinitely
composite." T. W. Mitchell.
II. Proceedings of the Boston Society for Psychic Research.
Vol. I. 1926. "The Psychic in the House." By
Walter Franklin Prince. Pp. vi + 284. Boston, 1926.
This volume is the first official issue of the new Boston Society
for Psychic Research, a society that has been founded, since the
reorganisation of the American Society for Psychical Research,
to try to preserve a scientific attitude towards the problems of
psychical research.
The present contribution to serious discussion constitutes, in
our opinion, one of the most interesting studies that has
hitherto appeared in a neglected field. For it is a study rare
in psychical Hterature : a story of haunting recorded apparently
380 E. J. Dingwall [part
with scrupulous accuracy by an expert observer, and enriched
by a series of supplementary descriptions based on contem-
porary visions experienced by, and experiments with his foster
daughter, Theodosia B. Prince, for whom he claims supernormal
powers, a claim which it is difficult to resist. In three houses
out of seven in wliich T.^ has lived phenomena have occurred of
which certain of the auditory class were heard by P., who had
never heard such sounds in twenty-six previous residences.
Moreover, these auditory and other phenomena in one of the
houses were, seemingly at least, connected with past events,
which were revealed by T. in a series or group of crystal
visions, veridical portions of which were confirmed later by
relatives of the former inhabitants of the house. This in rough
outline is the story of the Psychic in the House. The Psychic
is T., and the House is each of the three houses in which she
lived since psychogenetic occurrences began. The first question
that naturally arises is as to the real character of the occur-
rences. Were these raps and other auditory phenomena due
to some purely normal cause, or Avere they mere figments of
the imagination : hallucinatory experiences due to some un-
explained set of contributory factors ? Or were the crystal
visions (proved in part to have been veridical) mere guesswork
on the part of T. or due to information normally acquired and
then reproduced in the form of pretended visions in the
crystal ? Or to stretch the normal hypothesis still further :
are Ave to suppose that the whole record is a carefully pre-
pared hoax by P., with his wife and daughter as collaborators,
and designed for the purpose of self-advertisement or cynical
amusement 1 Taking the record as it stands, with personal
knowledge of all the chief parties in the case, this last sup-
position appears to me too grotesque for discussion. With
regard to the other hypotheses, we will consider the crystal
visions first.
Scrying is too common a faculty to excite surprise, nor need
it disturb us that T. should be a successful crystal-gazer.
P. has shoAvn that the possibility of T. having become
acquainted normally with the facts revealed in the visions is
^ In the following review the letter T. will denote Theodosia B. Prince
(the Doris Fischer of the former case of multiple personality) and P. will

100] Reviews 381
so remote that it can be dismissed as a reasonable hypothesis.
Accepting P. as a bona fide witness this would appear to be
the case, and as any serious discussion of the book pre-
supposes the theory of P."s integrity the hypothesis need not be
considered. Therefore in the following discussion I shall assume
[a] that T.'s " crystal visions " are what is usually meant
by that term, and (6) that in addition they reveal knowledge
of events supernormaUy acquired.
The question of the auditory and other phenomena appears
to be of a rather different nature. Taking the raps alone we
cannot assume, I think, as P. seems inchned to do, that aU
these sounds were supernormaUy produced. Not only did raps
occur in the houses, but they also occurred in P.'s New York
office and also in the office of a Dr. G. It is difficult to
assume that all these sounds were normal, a supposition that
would not be so hard were P. not the narrator of the incidents.
But possibly it can be assumed that some were normally
produced, and of these, some of those in P.'s office might be
conveniently selected. These appear only to have occurred
when P. was left alone. Thus at 1.35 p.m. on November 30,
1919, Miss T. and Mrs. S. had left w^hen a sharp rap was
heard. The same thing occurred on December 2, at 9.10 a.m.
P. asks, " If normal, why have I never heard one when another
person is about ? And why must I be alone if they are
supernormal ?
" The answer to this question does not seem to
be difficult. P. hears them (assuming their normal character)
just because he is alone. When others are present such sounds,
if they occur at all, are supposed to be connected with those
present. When the observer is alone, sounds cannot be thus
explained and often are therefore inexplicable. For the purpose
of example it may be instructive to consider the following
illustration of my meaning. While writmg this review raps are
occurring in my room. The last sounded as if the curtain rod
had been struck by a hght metal object. Other raps followed in
different parts of the room, and if I direct my attention to the
detection of somids a number are instantly remarked which
before were unnoticed. The wicker chair emits rustUng and
creeping sounds ;
taps occm- on the panes of the window ; and
from the legs of a smaU table at the other side of the room
come sharp cracking sounds. I get up and try to trace the
382 E. J. Dingwall [part
origin of certain of these raps, but a goodly proportion elude
me, and I can discover no cause for the sharp metallic rap
which I localised as upon the curtain rod. Now because I fail
to determine the cause of these sounds I do not therefore
consider them supernormal. It is true that the thought comes
into my mind that they may be so, but on analysing my
reasons I find that the chief is that the medium Willy Schneider
is in the next room and that such disturbances on a greatly
increased scale have already been reported upstairs. It is only
when there are some apparent grounds for the belief that
normal sounds are considered as possibly supernormal. Thus
in an alleged haunted house, numberless happenings which are
of almost everyday occurrence in ordinary houses become
vested with a mysterious import and take their place along
with other " occult phenomena which demand explanation.
P. is concerned with raps : the sounds may be produced by
spirits for his edification : spirits with their alleged extended
powers of locomotion can easily follow him, so what is more
natural than that they should rap in his office ? He hears
nothing (just as I hear nothing) when others are present : when
he is alone and more easily disturbed by chance sounds, the raps
are noticed and immediately they assume importance, not
because of their intrinsic character, but because of the associa-
tions which they arouse.^
These considerations, however, do not invahdate the other
sounds heard by more than one person and sometimes re-
sembling bangs as if by a stuffed club and the trampings of a
person on the stairs. These sounds are common to haunts at
^ Since writintc this paragraph raps seem to have begun in my room
at the S.P.R.
The fact of my remarking them is doubtless due to my consideration
of those heard by P. in relation to the arguments outlined above.
Thus this morning a sharp rap occurred which I localisgd as upon the
glass shade of a lamp standing in an isolated position near the window.
A visitor who happened to be present also heard this rap, but thought
that it occurred away from the window whilst agreeing that it was
certainly something apparently striking glass. On audibly requesting a
repetition of the sound nothing was heard for some thirty seconds, when
a startlingly loud rap came clearly from a large mahogany piece of
furniture at another side of the room.
I have no explanation for these soxmds, but have little doubt as to
their normal nature.
100] Reviews 383
all times and in all places, but \v\mt appears to me more
inexplicable than the sounds themselves is P.'s attitude regard-
ing them. We are told on page 68 that night after night
the most, or at least a large percentage, of the raps seemed to
come from the desk. I tested my judgment in every way
I could think of and became certain that I was right." And
again on page 266 : "I am not able to think of a precaution
which I did not take or a theory however wild which I did
not test."'
Now if there is one controversy that can easily be set at
rest, it is that concerning the objective or subjective nature of
the phenomena of hauntings. Are the sounds and impressions
in some way mentally received and then externalised ; or are
they objective realities in the sense that air waves are set in
motion from a distant point and aurally received as is the case
with other normal sounds ? We cannot discover in P.'s work
any interest regarding this fundamental problem. Yet he
admits that he is a slightly deaf person "
(p. 52) and that
certain of the raps were " below the threshold of my imperfect
hearing "'
(p. 142). At the same time he hopes " that it is
not necessary to explain to readers that a shghtly deaf person
is as able to give as trustworthy testimony regarding sounds
which he does hear as persons with normal hearing are regard-
ing the fainter sounds which they only can hear "
(p. 52).^
Now since he asserts that not only were the majority of the
raps seemingly centered about a desk, but also that the
shakings of a bed were so common that they settled down
into a formula ''
(p. 91), it would appear that here was an
ideal opportunity to make use of self-recording electrical appar-
atus. It would have been easy to amplify the raps in the desk
and to devise experiments with a view to determining the
actual or apparent movements of the bed. It is true that
now and then P. used an instrument to magnify the sounds
for the benefit of his own hearing, but no automatic record was
ever taken of any of the physical phenomena. This amazing
neglect is all the more remarkable when it is remembered that
P. is fully cognisant of the controversy mentioned above. But
^ This is true, but the inability to hear what may be the commences
ment of a series of normal sounds which culminate in a loud one may
be a serious hindrance in discovering the origin of the sound in question.
384 E. J. Dingioall [PAET
taking the record as it stands, it is difificult to devise any
effective reply to the critic who assumes that all the physical
phenomena were hallucinatory.
^
From what P. has written, however, it seems clear, and at
any rate we shall assume it to be so, that certain supernormal
phenomena occurred A^hich were closely linked up with the
house, the previous inhabitants, and the psychic T. What
that connexion is, is a problem as old as haunting itself. The
raps and peculiar sounds as of walking on the stairs later
identified as bemg connected with a former inhabitant now
deceased : the connected series of visions referring to a past
time : the odd behaviour of a dog M'hich apjDeared to act
towards apparitions seen by a percipient as if it saw them
also : the additional supplementary evidence of other persons
who under similar circumstances experienced identical sensations
of an unpleasant and terrifying nature : all these occurrences
demand some theory, but can that theory be supplied ? P., if
we read him rightly, inclmes to a spiritistic interpretation,
although we cannot pretend to believe that the support he
brings to it will bear the Aveight of that hyj)othesis. For
instance, on the night of January 17, 1924, the apparition of
T.'s grandmother appears to her (according to her report).
She had just put out the light after reading the paper when
her little dog lying near the radiator " leaped into the air."
T. looked at the place where the dog was apparently looking
and saw the phantom standing at the foot of the bed. P. in
his discussion of the case is at pains to explain the action of
the dog in its relation to the apparition. He can offer no
reasonable hypothesis either for the' dog's conduct or for the
fact that T. saw a grandmother whom she had only seen for
a period of about three months when alive. Now P. has yet
to show that the dog savj the ajojMTiHon at all. Suppose the
radiator was very hot and the dog had snviggled close to it
and suddenly got burnt (it was a January night). In addition
1 The work of such a critic is made more easy by the fact that there
is an almost total lack of independent witnesses outside the family
regarding the raps inside the house. Mr. Mansfield was at the house
in January 1925, and heard various sounds which he could not explain;
but ills account is scarcely convincing, and apparently he made no
attempt to investigate the sounds at the place from which it seemed,
they were proceeding.
100] Reviews 385
the light went out at that moment and the " moon probably
shone "
(p. 164) into the room. The dog jumped up and
howled. Is this action so pecuhar ? Is it necessary to suppose
that the dog saw the apparition 1 We cannot see the necessity,
neither can Me understand what is so very remarkable in the
appearance of the grandmother instead of anyone else. We
cannot begin to understand why a selective factor operated
until (for example) we can discover what associations were at
that moment latent or alive in the percipient's consciousness.
T. had been reading a paper. Can it not plausibly be sug-
gested that some stimulus was derived therefrom residting in
an apparition ? "If the grandmother's spirit does actually
survive the death of her body . . . /' P. writes, she might,
for aught we can say, have the curiosity to take one peek at
her granddaughter and be content with that to all eternity
(p. 165). Very possibly, but why does the spirit of a grand-
mother terrify a dog ; and whj^ does she content herself with
one peek ""
and not many peeks " 1 It has yet to be
shown u23on P."s hypothesis that spirits in order to observe
those on earth have in so doing to show themselves to those
who can see them, and I can hardly suppose that P. would
assent to such a proposition, although his expressions such as
the " single journeys " taken by " intelUgent entities " might
lend weight to that assumption.
With regard to the group of crystal visions it would seem
clear that part at least of the information was derived super-
normally, and P. suggests there is worth considering evidence
for spirit causation in the main mass of the visions "
(p. 202).
This might have been plausibly urged had it not been a fact
that all, or at least the vast majority, of the statements had
been known to the two Misses Tubby who subsequently verified
them. And unfortunately, immediately after the Princes had
moved into the house formerly occupied by the Tubby family
and phenomena began, P. told Miss G. 0. Tubby of the first
experience.^ Now this must have awakened in the sisters
Tubby a mass of buried memories, and knowing the results
obtained through T.'s mediumship in other directions may have
aroused just that suitable condition in which subhminal material
can be tapped. One of the IVIisses Tubby is herself an auto-

matist, and the other a lady with much experience of seances
and the mental and psychical temperament Avhich we are beginning
to associate with persons who obtain successful results with
trance mediums Avhere non-experimental telepathic processes are
concerned.
The attraction that the spiritistic interpretation has for P. is
well illustrated by another incident. On November 23, 1919,
T. described an apparition before her which was recognised as
a figure occurring in the visions whom P. calls Pelmore. T.
described the figure, and in the course of her description
declared that it was touching P. Avith its finger. P. writes :
" I had my hands clasped in front of me. Before I could
glance at my hands or notice consciously how they were
placed, I noted, at this instant, a chilly feeling on the index
finger of my left hand, and before I was able to speak, a
muscle just before the joint which joins the finger to the hand
began to twitch. ... I had no thought of the finger until
my attention was thus directed to it." P. then asks T.,
Where is he touching ?
" T.'s answer is, " On the first
finger of your left hand "
(p. 77). This sudden sense of chill
in one j^articular part of the body, and that one Avhich was
later alleged to he the part touched by the apparition, is
certainly curious and at first sight might appear to lend
support to the view that certain at least of the phenomena of
haunting are objective in character.^
The view commonly held in England that all the phenomena
are subjective appears to be made more complicated by the
fact that it is never urged that all poltergeist phenomena are
subjective, and it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line
between the two classes of occurrences. When the distinction
is discussed seriously at all, the only way out of the dilemma
appears to be to maintain that all poltergeist phenomena are
fraudulent or all haunting phenomena imaginary, a position
I do not believe to be tenable.
Whatever may be the ultimate solution of these questions,
the fact remains that the method adopted by Dr. Prince,

supplemented wherever possible by the use of mechanically
registering instruments, is likely to be the only one which can
further our knowledge of the phenomena of haunting. That
there are contributory factors both in the house and in the
percipient appears to be a reasonable assumption. Whether
there are yet other factors remains to be seen. It is to be
hoped that the author's observations will continue and that
efforts may be made so to control the auditory phenomena
that permanent records may be made under irreproachable
conditions of control. Even if we have no doubt concerning
the integrity of the compiler of the records, it must be remem-
bered that personal judgments, although of value, are by no
means final in scientific matters, and thus the automatic
registration of the phenomena of haunting, and confirmation by
independent, experienced and reliable observers are indispensable
in investigations of this nature.

objections in the " Dreimannerbuch " would mean the partial i
betrayal of his present associates whose standards of evidence !
(if we can judge them from the contents of this volume) are
somewhat different from his own.
The authors of this book appear to be of the opinion that
the majority of workers in psychical research are reliable in the
statements they make concerning the conditions under which
they work and the appearance of the phenomena which are
presented to them. But unfortunately this faith in authority
is not justified by the facts. Let us take a single example.
In his discussion of the evidence against the medium Eva C,
Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing rightly insists on the fundamental
importance of the hand-control. He quotes various authorities,
a.nd on page 213 he adds the testimony of that eminent
investigator, the late Dr. Gustave Geley. He writes :
" Through-
out the investigations of Dr. Geley which lasted for several
years the hands [of the medium] were always controlled," and
adds the direct statement of Dr. Geley from his Ectoplasmie et
Clairvoyance (Paris, 1924, p. 198) :
" Je repete que ses mains
restaient tozijours en rue et tenues en dehors des rideaux."
[Italics Geley's.] Now the authors of the " Dreimannerbuch
have insisted on the unreliability of even expert observers in
the field of psychical research. They doubt the accuracy of
their statements, for they know that the assurances of rigid
control are often baseless. The spirit of fundamental scepticism
which pervades their work is created largely by an omnipresent
doubt concerning the accuracy of any record which may be
presented for their criticism.
In a reply to their objections it might have been thought
that care would have been exercised in selecting examples
which support the contentions of the seven writers that the
accounts of observers can be considered reliable. Fortunately
we have an instance here of a direct statement by an acknow-
ledged expert and by one whose experiments are often men-
tioned in the " Siebenmannerbuch." Moreover, the crucial part
of that statement is italicised by their author in the authori-
tative work from which they are taken. Can that statement
be tested ? It can, and by irrefutable photographic evidence
obtamed during the sittings themselves, and pubhshed by Dr.
Geley in the same volume. What do we find 1 We find that,
100] Reviews 389
the photographs show that in the four which show both hands,
in one only is one hand held. What becomes of Dr. Geley's
statement, quoted by Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing, although pre-
viously exposed in the Proceedings S.P.R., 1924, xxxiv, p. 332, in
a review of Dr. von Schrenk-Notzing's own work ? Can it be
thought so unreasonable that serious inquirers refuse to credit
the reports of psychical researchers when in these fundamental
particulars misstatements are published and reported by the
principal workers in this field 1 What becomes of the oft-
repeated stories of Kluski ? Had he one hand free as the
photographs show was the case with Eva C. during her series
of sittings at the Institut Metapsychique Internationale ? The
hasis of the scepticism which the authors of this volume so
much deplore is founded on the works of psychical researchers
themselves, and I claim no exception for myself. Distrusting
my owTi observations, I distrust those of others, and I have
already seen enough to provide ample grounds for that distrust.
Observations in this field, in order to be of value, must be
checked and counter-checked by independent witnesses of irre-
proachable antecedents, and if possible registered by mechanical
recording instruments. Moreover, the mental attitude of the
investigator is probably even more important than his powers
of accurate observation. The authors of the " Dreimanner-
buch have recognised this fact, and Herr Lambert, in his
admirable survey of the Palladino case in the present volume,
indicates that he has partially grasped this cardinal principle in
connexion with this medium, although it is to be hoped that
his distrust of authorities will increase as he pursues his
studies. For, together with his collaborators, he is too apt to
accept stories at their face value without an appraisal of the
sources from which those stories spring. In this respect Pro-
fessor Oesterreich"s defence of the validity of Miss Goligher's
phenomena is especially interestmg. His attack on Dr. Rosen-
busch needs no reply, for he has failed to grasp the essential
points of the criticism of that author. For Professor Oester-
reich apparently believes all that Crawford said he observed
and all the stories that visitors related after leaving the seance
room. Dr. Fournier D'Albe, in his criticism of Dr. Crawford,
wrote that it seemed to him that Dr. CraAvford had " estab-
lished a habit of thought which became impervious even to
390 E. J. Dingicall [part
fairly obvious evidence of artificiality." ^ The importance of
that observation, not only in connexion with Dr. Crawford but
in connexion with other investigators, cannot be overestimated.
The study of occultism has so odd an effect on the human
mind that even after a few years, when the conviction of the
reality of supernormal phenomena has become fixed, the most
transparent deceptions are gravely cited as marvels of medium
-
ship. Moreover, it need not imply that the critical faculty is
lost in other directions or that technical ability is in any way
weakened. The belief in the integrity of the subject causes
the results to be accepted without question, and quite irrelevant
reasons are often advanced for this trust iii the reliability of
the medium. The psychic is either religiovis, or in a high
social position, or is a serious inquirer himself, and therefore (so
the argument runs) the phenomena must be genuine, thus
rendering all adequate precautions both damaging and offensive.
The investigators are thus led deeper and deeper into the work,
and in proportion as their beUef is confirmed, the less do they
see, and the more likely they are to put a favourable con-
struction uj^on the little accidents of the seance room. If a
thread is seen it is an " ectoplastic filament " ; if toes or feet,
and even the nails are felt, it is not a foot but a structure
"
(E. E. F. D'Albe, lb., 50). If the medium continually kicks
the investigators under the table (Frau Silbert), the kicks are
caused by psychic levers, the suckers of which, although strong
enough to grip the skirts of the ladies with a powerful grasp,
wither away under the devastating effect of the human eye
when it glances under the table. Similarly with the same
medium so feebly supported by Professor Daniel Walter in the
present volume, the investigator must not suppose that the
warm object supplied with toes and clothed in a stocking
material which hands the investigator objects below the table,
is the medium's foot ; it is a " psychic structure " possessing
these strange qualities. Evidence is adduced, not because the
phenomena can in any Avay be proved, but because of past
experiences which must have been gemiine " (cf. Guzik, p. 236),
or because the investigators have no inkling of how normal
methods could produce the results. If their mmds did not in
some strange way become influenced by their occult experiences,
1 The Goligher Circle (London, 1922), p. 49.
100] Rerieivs 391
such methods of reasomng would be impossible. Their passion
for the supernormal, derived either from their hope in it as a
means of assisting faith in the reahsation of survival after
death or from the pleasure that the eerie atmosphere of the
seance room brings to them, has made them accept phenomena
on evidence which would be dismissed contemptuously in any
other field.
Dr. Tischner continues the defence m a chapter dealing with
the reports pubUshed in the older hterature ; but his work,
like other contributions to this volume, is somewhat weakened
by his almost naive faith in the truth of what observers state
in their reports, and it is curious to note that the authors of
the " Dreimannerbuch exhibit the same peculiarity, although
in their case it is usually the reports against the authenticity
of psychic phenomena to which credit is given.
In the ordinary physical sciences the reports of scientific
observers can usually be believed when deahng with broad
jorinciples of investigation, and, if more deUcate experiments are
concerned, their results can usually be checked by other com-
jjetent workers in the same field. But in psychical research,
where the material for investigation is so rare, and where the
opportimity for verification by other observers is often im-
possible, it is of paramount importance that some reasonable
guarantees should be provided that the conditions are actually
what the observers state that they are.
Thus we see that in the present volume the defence of Miss
C4oligher, Jan Guzik, Nielsen and Frau Silbert is no defence at
all ; it is simply a collection of vague statements of which
scarcely one can be properly verified. On the other hand, the
repUes to the criticisms of Palladino, Tomczyk, Eva C. and
Schneider are good, although more might have been made of
the importance of the Schneider mediumship in relation to the
history of investigation. The volume has fulfilled one purpose
completely. It has shown the unanswerable character of the
main contentions of the authors of the '"
Dreimannerbuch."
That contention is that up to the present no adequate evidence
has been adduced which would lead a critical mind to accept
the existence of physical phenomena from a mere acquaintance
\dth the literature only. Such phenomena (if they reaUy occur)
are at present so rare that it ^^•ould seem that scientific men
392 E. J. Dingwall [PAJRT 100]
can scarcely hope to have any extensive practical acquaintance
with them. It therefore behoves every worker in this field to
conduct his observations in such a way that posterity may
have some grounds for accejjting them as reliable and accurate.
Judging from the standard of certain of the authors of the
" Siebenmannerbuch " that does not seem at present to be a
likely possibility.
The book is well printed and arranged, although it is difficult
to understand ^^'hy an index has been omitted.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PL0TINU8, AND ITS INTEREST
TO THE STUDENT OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
By Mr. G. W. Lambert.
{This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society
on June 2, 1926.)
References to the philosophy of Plotinus are not in-
frequent in the Uterature of psychical research, and have
aroused a certain amount of interest in his work on the
part of students who would gladly learn more about it.
Unfortunately the literature on the subject is scanty, and
in some respects defective, and the English reader who
does not know Greek will find the task of informing himself a
difficult one. This paper is intended to assist such enquirers
by giving them a summary of Plotinus' psychological
theories, in so far as they deal with the subject matter of
psychical research ; and as the paper is intended for the
student of that subject, and not for the classical scholar,
I have endeavoured to relegate matters of purely academic
interest to footnotes. In dealing with Plotinus it is not
possible to dispense altogether with the apparatus of
scholarship, because his Greek is difficult, and the text is
faulty. In a brief essay of this kind it is manifestly
impossible to stop and discuss every debatable interpre-
tation of Plotinus' thought, and I hope the references
I have given will enable those who are in a position to
do so to test the accuracy of what is necessaril}'- a very
condensed summary. I have appended a brief bibho-
graphica^ note (see p. 412), and if the reader consults the
works there mentioned he will find more complete biblio-
graphies should he wish to extend his study of the subject.
, G. W. Lambert [part
It is unfortunate that the best critical work in English
on The Enneads^ is by a writer who has a distinct bias
against psychical research, and this paper is to some
extent an attempt to correct that bias. For instance,
Dr. Inge refers to telepathy as a "superstition" of the
third and twentieth centuries, ^ and suggests that Plotinus
would have no sympathy with the efforts made by
students of psychical research to throw light on the
problem of survival.s I deal with the latter point below
(see p. 402), and only mention it here to emphasise
'
the
fact that the enquirer who needs guidance is not well
provided for by current Uterature on the subject. For
that very reason I have tried to avoid ground which is
abeady adequately covered by pubhshed works. The
reader will find all we know about the life of Plotinus in
Porphyry's memoir,* and I have only referred to that
work for the purpose of illustrating points of psychological
interest.
Plotinus and Psychical Research.
If any evidence were needed of the greatness of Plotinus
as a thinker, it could be found in the fact that he has
been acclaimed by persons of the most divergent opinions.
He has been hailed as a teacher by pagan and by
Christian, by Catholic and by Quaker, by the man of
action and by the dreamer, by the initiate and by the
agnostic, and latest of all, by the friend as well as by
the detractor of psychical research. From time to time
attempts have been made on one side or the other to
prevent his exploitation by the opposing party, but in
spite of all Plotinus maintains his unassailable ascendancy,
an "eagle soaring above the tomb of Plato." It is clear,
therefore, that he can only be acclaimed as a patron of
psychical research in so far as that study connotes the
fearless pursuit of truth.

101] The Psychology of Plotinus 395
As an earnest seeker after truth Frederic Myers was a
worthy disciple of Plotinus, and introduced into modern
psychical research not only his elevation of spirit, but
much of his thought as well. The extent of Myers' debt
to Plotinus is not to be measured simply by counting the
number of qvxotations from and allusions to The Enneads
in Myers' works. His influence is traceable throughout
Myers' prose and poetry, and did not desert him even in
the dry task of inventing technical terms ^ for the new
science to which he devoted the best part of his life.
Moreover, it was Myers' deep interest in Neoplatonism
which led some of his friends to choose a quotation from
the Fifth Ennead as a test in some "cross-correspondence"
experiments conducted some years ago (see below, p. 409).
It is also remarkable that certain psychologists on the
Continent are beginning to put forward theories in explan-
ation of psychical phenomena which bear a strong resem-
blance to those of Plotinus. Probably these thinkers are
influenced by Fechner and Wilham James, and not by a
study of The Enneads themselves, but the fact lends
interest to the subject, and should encourage a careful
examination of the older theories.
Natural Science.
In the third century, as in the ancient world generally,
there was a tendency to interpret physical phenomena in
psychological terms. The direction of thought is now
reversed, and we are accustomed to interpret psychological
phenomena in the terms of physical science. While,
therefore, as the reader would expect, the physical theories
of Plotinus are of a primitive character in themselves,
they are of value as an aid to the understanding of his
psychological theories, and for that reason I will give a
brief summary of them here.
Plotinus held that the physical universe consisted of
four elements, earth, water, air, and fire ; earth and water
" down here " in the lowest region of space ; above them
1 E.g. the word " metetherial " : see the glossary to Human Person-
ality, vol. i. p. xix.
396 G. W. Lambert [part
air, extending to a limit somewhere this side of the moon ;
and beyond that, " fire," by which he meant a continuous
substance, filhng the whole heaven, which in its incandes-
cent state glows with a white light. This conception is
the nearest approach the ancients made to the theory of
the luminiferous ether.
Now this universe of the four elements would be utterly
dark and inert, a mere " corpse " of an universe, so to
speak, if it were not animated through and through by
" soul." The Great Soul which permeates the whole
universe is the cause of all movement, including those
movements which we regard as mechanical. Its presence
makes the universe a living animal, the various parts of
which are in sympathetic relation with one another.^
There never was a time, he tells us, when this universe
was not ensouled,^ but in imagination we can picture to
ourselves the flooding of soul into it as if it were an
event in time. One passage,^ of which this is the theme,
has acquired a special interest for students of psychical
research, and is dealt with below (see page 409).
In another place he describes the universe as pervaded
by soul in much the same way as a net let down into
the sea is swept through and stretched out by the sur-
rounding water.* But he is careful to make it clear that
soul is not a form of matter, as some thinkers wrongly
supposed. It is rather something which transcends matter.
Besides the Great Soul, there are in the universe many
individual souls, which can embody themselves in various
kinds of matter. There are divine souls which embody
themselves in the ether, and make their bodies glow with
a pure white light. These are seen by us as stars. This
doctrine that the stars are living beings is one which
falls strangely on modern ears, but it has commended
itself to several notable thinkers, including Leibniz and
Fechner. Dr. Inge, so far from classifying it with tele-
pathy as a superstition of the third century, says, " The
doctrine itself does not seem to me ridiculous or improb-
able." ^ This is not the place to discuss the subject

further, and I would " come down to earth " at once,
were it not necessary to ask the reader first to hear what
Plotinus has to tell us about the souls which inhabit the
intervening region.
The souls next in rank below the Gods are the
" daimones." Plotinus does not say very much about
them, probably because he was well aware of the amount
of superstition and credulity associated with the doctrine.
What little he did say is calculated to remove current
errors and to reduce the doctrine to something which
would fit organically into his general system. He accepted
the current view that the daimones were living beings
whose natural habitat was the air belt between the moon
and the Earth, and apparently believed that they could
invest themselves in bodies of gas and luminous ether,
^
and utter sounds. ^ Nor was it unreasonable to suppose
that they could be summoned by magical processes.^ He
considered man, in respect of the divine part of his
nature, to be superior to the daimones, and, if we are to
beheve Porphyry, he shocked his superstitious friends by
saying that it was for the daimones to come to him, and
not for him to go to them.* He rejected the current
view that diseases were due to daemonic agency, and
attributes them to " exhaustion or excesses or deficiencies
or mortification and other changes originating either outside
or inside the body."^
The manner in which Plotinus deals with the doctrine
that each person has a tutelary daimon leaves the reader
in some doubt whether he took it in the same sense as
most of his contemporaries. It is clear that he attempted
to rationalise the belief, but it may have been necessary
for him to conceal his attitude to some extent ;
otherwise it
is difficult to account for the very laboured and obscure
language of his short treatise on " The Daimon which is
allotted to us." ^ Some of the functions of the tutelary
daimon are now attributed to that equally elusive entity,
the "censor" of the Freudian school, and it will be inter-
esting to see whether in the future science will restore to

the daimon any of the other powers of which he has been
deprived.
So far, then, as The Enneads show, Plotinus was by no
means a credulous beUever in the crude spirituaUsm of his
day. Nor, apparently, was he averse from experiments in
this field. Porphyry tells us he readily consented to
attend an experiment for the evocation of his own daimon
by an Egyptian priest, the result of which so terrified one
of the attendants that the affair was brought to a sudden
and premature conclusion.
^
Next in rank below the Gods and daimones came the
souls of men and animals, and in the following section
I give an outline of Plotinus' views on human psychology.
.Human Psychology.
Plotinus deals at some length with the problem of the
relationship of the soul and body, and disposes of various
inadequate hypotheses.^ If he had enlarged even more
than he does on this subject, it would not have been
surprising, considering that Porphyry argued the question
with him for three whole days.^ The conclusion he comes
to is that it is truer to say that the body is in the soul,
rather than that the soul is in the body.* The soul of
the individual is in continuity with all other souls and
with tlie Great Soul. This is proved by the fact of tele-
pathy.^ In this connection it is relevant to quote a
first-hand story told us by Porphyry.® Porphyry was
contemplating suicide in his own house, when Plotinus
" perceived " it in some supernormal fashion, and suddenly
confronted him, and dissuaded him from doing violence
to himself. The event made such an impression on
Porphyry that he never repeated the attempt.
The human soul, according to Plotinus, has three
elements, which are sometimes spoken of as if they are
parts, and sometimes as if they are themselves separate

souls. They correspond with the three levels of the
physical universe, an assumption which has the merit of
affording a consistent background of metaphor for the
purpose of describing psychological states and processes.
They are :
(1) the divine (superconscious) part,
(2) the reasoning (conscious) part,
(3) the unreasoning (subconscious) part.
The subconscious soul embraces the principles of nutrition,
growth and sex, and their connected instincts. It is this
part of the soul which is acted upon by hypnotic influences,
and by incantations and prayers. Magicians, with their
dramatic ritual and singing, are well aware of this, and
behave accordingly, working upon the unreasoning part of
a man's soul. If the heavenly bodies play any part in
the transaction, they know nothing about it.^ If incan-
tations and prayers can work effects at a distance, it is
through the medium of the Great Soul.^ All souls are
in continuous rapport with one another, but the j)ulses
between them are for the most part unperceived, and the
impressions do not necessarily rise above the threshold of
consciousness.*
Plotinus also deals at some length with the question of
memory. It must suffice to record here that he held
memory to be a piurely psychical activity, which is
obstructed by the body,^ and when freed from that
obstruction is greatly extended in range and power. His
views about the retention of memory after the death of
the body are dealt with below (see p. 403).
The similarity of certain of these views to those which
are now being put forward by modern students to explain
the phenomena of hypnotism and telepathy is remarkable.
For instance. Dr. Tischner, in his recent book entitled
Telepathy mid Clairvoyance, spealdng of the supernormal
acquisition of information by mediimis, says :
" It gives us the impression that the subconscious mind
-
—to make use of a spatial image—is not so clearly

sejxirated from its surroundings, but represents a mental
field which is connected witli the '
non-individual ' or
superindividual mind. If we descend from our surface
consciousness, we gradually reach subconscious regions
which cease to belong to a single individual. . . . These
very deep layers of the subconscious mind would then
share in a non-individual or superindividual mind, and so
have a knowledge of things which are quite unattainable
to the individual mind. The difficulty of raising this
knowledge to the surface consciousness would account for
the scarcity of the phenomena." ^ Again, " We can say
that these phenomena might readily be deduced, nay,
j)redicted, from the superindividual mind and the absolute
subject. For if the superindividual mind projects more
or less deeply into every individual, it is not only com-
prehensible but to be expected that mental connection
should exist between two individuals. . .
." ^ This is very
like the Plotinian theory, though I do not suppose that
Dr. Tischner is indebted to Neoplatonism. It must, how-
ever, be observed that Plotinus, who is always clear and
consistent in his mental imagery, would never have allowed
himself to suggest that if you go dow7i to deep levels of
the subconscious mind, you will come to a swpenndividual
mind, which projects more or less deeply into each indi-
vidual.
I have necessarily had to leave out much that is of
interest from the point of view of normal psychology, and
only observe in passing that Plotinus has a theory of
emotion which closely resembles that of William James
in the importance it assigns to the organic sensations
accompanying the emotion.^ He does not deal with the
problem of dreams, a rather surprising omission. As the
subconscious for Plotinus was not only the seat of desire,
but also the channel of telepathic impulses, he would have
had no difficulty in explaining dream material in a manner
consonant with that of modern research.
I cannot in this paper describe at length what Plotinus
has to tell us about the superconscious, or divine, part of
the soul. It must suffice to observe that this part of the
1 Op. cit. p. 219. 2 Op p 221. a jy. 4. 28.
101] The PsychoI(u/!/ of PJotinns 401
soul is never actually " embodied," and even during our
life here maintains its calm existence in the world of
immaterial existences " yonder." It has its own powers
of vision, but different from those of bodily eyes, for the
things it sees are not of this world.
^
Theory of Survival.
Plotinus treats the problem mainly from the theoretical
standpoint, and writes at length to refute the arguments
in favour of a material soul which is dispersed at death.
There is no need to recapitulate his arguments here, many
of which are couched in terms very difficult to translate
because they echo the clamour of long forgotten con-
troversies. I will give only one example. In Plotinus'
day many, especially in the medical profession, held that
the soul was a kind of wind (" pneuma ") or gas (to use a
more modern term), i.e. a material substance, which circu-
lated through the arteries. The " pneuma " in a living
body was said to be "in a certain state," which gave rise
to the phenomena of life.^ Plotinus makes short work of
this theory. In doing so, he claims as common ground
with his opponents that there are, of course, many in-
animate gases, ^ and asks what difference there is between
these and gases which are souls—a very difficult question
for the upholders of the " pneuma " theory to answer.
I have referred to this passage in order to put the reader
on his guard against attributing to the word " pneuma "
in The Enneads any other than a material signification.
It must not be given its more familiar New Testament
meaning of " spirit " as opposed to matter.
Plotinus' theory of survival is so comprehensive that
each reader who comes to The Enneads with any theory
of survival at all is likely to find his own ideas on the
subject reflected in this or that passage, and he must
resist the temptation to fasten on these, to the exclusion

it altogether." {Ph. PL, vol. i. p. 220.) Why ?
402 G. W. Lamhert, [PAET
of others which would modify his own partial view. For
instance, Dr. Inge says :
"It is plain from this passage and from all that
Plotinus says about the eternal world, that his conception
of eternity is widely different from the hope of continued
existence in time to which many persons, though by no
means so many as is often supposed, cling with passionate
desire. Ghost stories have no attraction for the Platonist.
He does not believe them and would be very sorry to have
to believe them. The kind of immortality which '
psychical
research ' endeavours to establish would be for him a
negation of the only immortality which he desires and
believes in. The difference between the two hopes is
fundamental." ^
That the author is here voicing his own views rather
than those of Plotinus will, I think, appear to the reader
from the following summary. Plotinus' theory of sur-
vival is in strict conformity with his theory of the
structure of human personality, as described above. At
the moment of death the soul-body system which consti-
tutes the living person is temporarily dislocated. The
lowest soul element, which is in immediate contact with
the body, is parted from the higher portion, embracing
the conscious and spiritual selves. That the lowest part
of the soul does not leave the body at once is proved
by the fact that hair and nails grow on a body after
death, and by the fact that when animals are cut to
pieces, the scattered parts make movements for some time
after. But in a short time the three psychic elements
reassemble, and are hurried to their doom. Their fate is
determined by the level at which the man has lived
during his earth life, and the souls of the dead find their
"level" by a process as regular as that of gravitation.^
The higher the soul rises, the more tenuous its body
becomes, until, in the best event, it leaves the sphere of
matter altogether for the " Beyond." So long as the
soul remains in the material universe, it is linked with a
body, whether of flesh, or of some more rarefied matter,
gaseous or etheric. The sage's task is to rid his soul of
^Ph.PL, vol. ii. p. 96. = iv. 4. 29. .
= iv. 3. 24.
101] The Psychology of Plotinns 403
all matter, in order that after death, if not before, it may
rise to that which is both its source and its goal.^
When the soul leaves its body o£ flesh and blood, its
power of memory increases in proportion to its freedom
from matter, 2 for, as I have pointed out above, memory
is a psychical activity which is impeded by the body.
At the same time, another law comes into operation,
namely, that a man only exercises his power of memory
in regard to things which interest him. Indeed, he tends
to become that which he calls to mind.^ The departed
soul finds itself in a new environment, which occupies
most of its attention, and as the soul rises, its absorption
in its environment becomes more and more complete, as
the obstacles to action diminish. Consequently, although
the power of memory increases as the soul rises, the calls
upon it grow fewer until the soul leaves the celestial
sphere for the Beyond.* In that sense the soul grows
more forgetful as it progresses,^ and eventually reaches a
state in which the circumstances demanding the use of
memory are altogether transcended. Similarly, on the
downward journey, the soul does not begin to exercise
memory until it leaves the Beyond for the celestial region.
Souls which call to mind the memories of earth life tend
to return here ^
—a doctrine, it may be noted in passing,
which is implied in certain statements purporting to have
come from F. W. H. Myers since his death (see, e.g., those
cited by Sir Ohver Lodge on pp. 301 and 302 of The
Survival of Man).
At the same time it is necessary to correct a false
impression that might arise from the imagery of the soul
rising and descending. It would be more in accordance
with Plotinus' ideas to imagine the soul as a kind of
psychical continuum reaching from " above the heaven
"
down to earth, ^ which cannot lose anything which it has
acquired in experience, but is only active in that par-
ticular sector upon which the focus of personality is centred
at any given time. The focus moves up or down accord-
ing to the direction given to it by the character of the

individual, and the psychological characteristics of person-
ality after death depend iipon the level at which the
personality in question is active. Many of the departed
remain at relatively low levels, where their desires,
memories and activities are those of earth life.^ Yet even
this language is inadequate, because the soul, being an
entity which transcends matter, can be wholly present in
any " part " of itself.^ The " part " of a soul which is
in immediate contact with the matter which it organises
into a body (whether of flesh and blood or of some more
tenuous matter), forms with that body a kind of com-
pound entity which Plotinus calls by several names.^ In
the case of those departed souls which have not escaped
from the physical universe altogether this psycho-physical
compound is, objectively regarded, the " eidolon " or
living ghost. Plotinus does not cite any cases of ghostly
apparitions coming within his own experience, but adduces
the traditional instance of the Shade of Herakles, which
was to be distinguished from the Herakles in heaven.*
That he believed in the possibility of communications from
the dead is clear from the following passage with which he
concludes the Seventh Book of the Fourth Ennead :
" Thus far we have offered considerations appropriate to
those asking for deductive proof ; those whose need is
conviction depending on observation are best met from
the abundant records relevant to the subject : . . .
There are (he proceeds) not a few souls, once among men,
who have continued to serve them after quitting the body,
and by revelations, practically helpful, make clear as well
that other souls, too, have not ceased to be." °
These are not the words of a man who rejects the
evidence of what we should call psychical research, and
they seem to have escaped the notice of Dr. Inge when
he wrote the passage quoted above.
Thus in Plotinus' system there is room not only for the
immortality of timeless existence in a wholly transcen-
dental world to which Dr. Inge looks forward, but also

101] The Psychology of Plotinus 405
for survival in conditions not very far removed from those
of earth life, of which many students of psychical research
are satisfied that they have obtained experimental proof
by communications from " souls once among men."
The student who adopts Plotinus' far-reaching theory of
the nature of man's psychical constitution, with its
immense range and organic structure, will find that it
throws new light on many current problems. He will,
however, find himself more than ever impressed with the
difficulty of estabhshing the identity of " communicators."
The question whether a given " communicator " is identical
with some particular deceased individual raises the whole
question of the structure of the two personalities one is
attempting to identify. Both Plotinus and Frederic Myers
f were profoundly right in making a theory of human
personality the groundwork of their theories of survival,
and many of the difficulties experienced in co-ordinating
the data of research are no doubt due to imperfect and
one-sided theories of personality. Plotinus' theory at any
rate gives us a scale by which to classify the various kinds
of identity tests which are applied to trance personalities.
Looking at the matter from the Plotinian standpoint, the
tests fall into four categories.
(1) In the lowest class come those tests which measure
and compare psychophysical reactions not under conscious
control, such as pulse rates and psychogalvanic reflexes.
If individual reflexes are highly characteristic, it would be
interesting to have them recorded, in order that they
might be compared with those of any controls who, after
the death of the person under observation, claimed identity
with him. It may be that reactions normal in one body
are not easily reproducible in another, but jucl'^ing from
the curious physiological manifestations displayed by some
controls, the results might be distinctly interesting.
(2) Next in order would come characteristic mannerisms
of speech and so forth, which impress some sitters very
strongly. But Plotinus would never have accepted these
as proof of the survival of more than the body-
subconscious soul " compound," ^ in which habits of all
1 i. 1. 10.
406 G. W. Lambert [part
kinds are registered. They would not necessarily prove
the continued activity of the " higher soul."
(3) In the third class come tests based on comparisons
of memories. I have akeady pointed out that, according
to Plotinus, the more intellectual type of mind loses
detailed earth memories after death, and he would not
have been at all surprised at the serious failures of memory
displayed by certain of the controls claiming identity with
important members of this Society who have died and
since purported to communicate. This possibility, coupled
with our ignorance of the range of clairvoyance and tele-
pathy, makes memory tests a very inconclusive kind of
evidence, whether they are apparently successful or the
reverse.
(4) In the highest class we must place those tests which
rely on showing, on the part of controls or communicators,
continued intellectual powers of a high order, which are
also " characteristic," such as those originating correlated
scripts of a complicated and ingenious type, like the " Ear
of Dionysius " case.^
Looked at from the Plotinian standpoint, each of these
tests taps the problem, as it were, at a different psycho-
logical level. None of the types of test is open to a
quite unambiguous interpretation, but if a control, pur-
porting to be a deceased individual, successfully passed
tests in each of the four categories mentioned above, the
cumulative evidence of survival would be very strong.
Unfortunately there is a tendency on the part of experi-
menters to specialise on one type of test ; this circum-
stance, in its turn, tends to limit the psychical " educa-
tion " of mediums, and the result is a mass of data more
difficult to coordinate than would have been the case if
they had been collected over a wider psychological range.
Contemplation and Ecstasy.
No essay on the psychology of Plotinus would be
complete without some account, however brief, of his
theory of contemplation. His teaching on this subject
1 iv. 3. 27. - Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxix, p. 1*97 ff.
101] The Psychology of Plotinus 407
alone has earned for him an imperishable name as one
of the great mystics of all ages, and he has influenced the
thought of men so far removed from one another in
temperament and in time as St. Augustine and Lord
Tennyson.
Many pages could be written on the meaning of the
word " contemplation " in Plotinus. He uses it in a
sense to which we are not accustomed, different from that
which it has acquired as the result of centuries of subse-
quent religious development. Contemplation, far from
being the antithesis of action, is the fundamental activity
of all life.^ The Soul of the World contemplates the
things that are " yonder," or, as we might say, in the
spiritual world, and this act of contemplation results in
the creation of a faint copy, which we see as Nature.
In a sense the visible universe is a sort of by-product of
contemplation by the World Soul, but inasmuch as the
world of sense is in a less pure substance than the world
" yonder," it is a shadow rather than a rephca. I must
not trace this theory to its source in Platonism, nor stop
to translate certain splendid passages in which Plotinus
describes the attitude of silent sympathy which man must
adopt if he would understand the secret and silent pro-
cesses of nature.^ It must, however, be observed that the
theory is bound up, in the case of Plotinus, with certain
psychical experiences of his own. He was convinced that
on more than one occasion he had penetrated in moments
of ecstasy into that world " yonder," which lies behind the
veil of this world.^ It is also bound up, if I am not
mistaken, with a curiously primitive and erroneous theory
of normal vision. I need hardly say that the problem
of vision was one which always puzzled the ancients, and
about which they had ideas very far wide of the truth.
A sceptic might therefore be inclined to discard at once
all that Plotinus has to say about contemplation, on the
ground that, on the psychological side, the theory is rooted
in the self-delusion of ecstasy, and, on the physical side,
in a false optical theory. But here again Plotinus seems
to me to throw out a valuable suggestion, which shines
1 Vide iii. 8. •passim. - iii. 8. 4. ^ g_ i .
y p 23.
408 G. W. Lambert [PAET
out all the more brightly because of the dark background
of scientific ignorance from which it proceeds. There does
seem to be some form of psychical activity which results
in a contemplated image becoming actually reproduced.
I refer to the obscure phenomenon of stigmatisation. In
the case of stigmatics we see at work some curious psycho-
physical process by which a visually received image
becomes reproduced, in a sense, in the body of the
stigmatic. In what circumstances an image can penetrate
so deeply into the subconscious as to affect the plastic
functions in this way we cannot at present understand.
May not a similar process assist in the acquisition of
protective colouring by animals, especially in those remark-
able cases where the animal adapts its colour to the back-
ground against which it is seen ?
It has also been suggested, I think, that the formation
of teleplastic structures is an extreme example of the same
process. The generation of these seems to involve a
profound disturbance of the plastic functions of the psyche,
and these, according to Plotinus, are closely associated
with the sexual nature in the subconsciousness. May not
this circumstance afford an explanation of the conjunction
frequently observed between the phenomena of physical
mediumship and sexual disturbance ? ^ This conjunction of
symptoms, if we may so term them, is a source of anxiety
to many people ; it has also been noticed, of course, in
the annals of mystical religious experience. The truth
seems to be that we have not yet gained selective control
over the mechanisms at work, and the phenomena we wish
to study are liable to be confused by disturbances we must
hope one day to eliminate. Rather than attribute the
pathological symptoms to the Devil or to malicious spirits,
I would attribute them to an inevitable clumsiness of
manipulation in what is at present an obscure field of
experiment.
For the purpose of the foregoing summary of the psycho-
logical views of Plotinus it has been necessary to draw
on chapters in The Enneads which are for the most part
dry and technical. I have had no opportunity of quoting
iCf., e.g., E. Morselli, Psicologia e " Spiritismo" (Torino, 1908), II. 14.
101] The Psychology of Plotinus 409
from any of those soaring passages which have earned for
Plotinus an immortal name in literature. There is,
however, one such passage ^ which has become famous in
the annals of this Society, and for that reason some
reference to it here will not be out of place.
Many readers will remember that Mr. J. G. Piddington,
in his paper entitled " A Series of Concordant Automa-
tisms," elucidates a remarkable series of cross -corre-
spondences originating from a test question put by Mrs.
Verrall to " Myersp " in the form of three Greek words
from the Fifth Ennead which were known to have
definite associations in the mind of Frederic Myers. ^ This
is laiown as " the ai'ro? ovpavo'; aKu/uwu incident." The
passage from which these words are taken comes near the
beginning of the Fifth Ennead. It is translated by Myers
on p. 291 of Vol. II. of Human Personality, and is closely
coupled by him with another passage from the end of
the Third Book of the same Ennead. His translation is
as follows :
" So let the soul that is not imworthy of that vision
contemplate the Great Soul ; freed from deceit and every
witchery, and collected into calm. Calm be the body for
her in that hour, and the tumult of the flesh ;
ay, all
that is about her calm ; calm be the earth, the sea, the
air, and let heaven itself be still. Then let her feel how
into that silent heaven the Great Soul floweth in. . . .
And so may man's soul be sure of Vision, when suddenly
she is filled with light ; for this light is from Him and
is He ; and then surely shall one know his presence when,
like a god of old time. He entereth into the house of
one that calleth Him, and maketh it full of light."
The first passage, down to " the Great Soul floweth in,"
contains the three Greek words auro? ovpai'6^ aKv/mm',
which literally mean " the very heaven waveless." For
the purpose of the experiment it was sufficient to show
that the script intelligence understood the passage in the
same sense in which Myers understood it during his life-
time, and this seems to have been the case. But it must
iv. 1. 2. 2P/'oc. S.P.R., vol. xxii. p. 107.
2 D
410 G. W. Lambert [part
be observed that Myers, misled by the editors of the text,
failed to grasp the real significance of the passage, the
meaning of which has only recently been elucidated.
Professor Dodds has pointed out that Plotinus is not here
conveying an injunction to meditate on the World Soul
" only when atmospheric conditions are favourable." ^ On
the contrary, he is asking the reader to still his own soul,
in order that it may be able to picture to itself the
Universe of the four elements in a state of motionless
quiet before the World Soul entered into it. " There
never was a time," he has told us elsewhere, " when this
Universe was not ensouled," ^ so that it is a vision of the
imagination, and not of an historical event that he is
asking us to contemplate. Before the entry of Soul we
must picture the four elements earth, sea (water), air, and
" heaven " as motionless and dark. That moment is like
the moment of darkness before the dawn, before the day-
light flooding over the horizon wakes all things from the
silence of sleep. Thus in this passage there is a vision
of dawn, and behind it a still grander visioia of the
dawning of life on the Universe. With this explanation,
I will give a rendering of this passage, going beyond the
point where Myers left it so as to give the full context.
" Another soul that would behold the Great Soul must
herself be great and not unworthy of that vision, freed
from deceit and every witchery, and composed in silence.
Silent be the surrounding body and the turmoil of the
flesh, and all the environment beside ; silent the earth,
silent the sea and air, and silent the unmoving ^ heaven
^Classical Quarterly, April 1922, p. 96. 2 iv. 3. 9.
^ I have provisionally accepted Professor Dodds' conjecture afxa. ixhwv
to replace the afxeifup of the MSS. The word 6.kvixwi', whicli Myers
read, is a conjecture of Kirchoft' which is certainly wrong, and may have
been responsible for the continued failure to understand this passage.
An adjective meaning " not revolving " is appropriate, as there is
emphasis on the point that it is the entry of Soul which sets the
heaven, previously stationary (karQiTa), in motion. But it seems to me
that editors may have been too hasty in condemning ijj.eivwv as corrupt.
In iv. .3. 1 7, where Plotinus is describing the entry of individual souls
into the (physical) heaven, he says d yap ovpafbs ev ti2 ai7drjT(2 tottlo
ap.elvwv, as if the superior nobility or fineness of heaven was a generally
101] The Psychology of Plotinus 411
itself. Then, behold, into that motionles.s heaven from
every side Soul comes flowing and flooding in, and enters
in and enlightens it ; as the sun's rays light up a dark
cloud and kindle it to a golden glory, so Soul, entering
into the body of heaven, gave it life and immortality, and
awakened it from rest. And heaven, set in motion ever-
lasting by the power of Soul wisely guiding it, became
a happy living creature, glorified by ^the Soul that has
taken up her abode there ; for before the advent of Soul
it was a mere corpse of earth and water, or rather a dark
chaos, a '
nothing,' '
an abomination of the gods,' as a
poet has said."
The second passage quoted by Myers, beginning " And
so may man's soul be sure of vision," is taken from a
different context, nearly three books further on.^ It
contains a train of thought very characteristic of Plotinus,
but so unfamiliar to-day outside the region of poetry that
a word of explanation may not be out of place. The
reader will remember that a Plotinian god, if he endows
himself with a body, creates one of a fiery texture which
is self-luminous. Indeed, a strong eflulgence accompanying
an apparition was a sure indication of a heavenly visitor,
as distinct from one of lower rank."^ The vision of some
god flooding with light " the house of one that calleth
him '
' illustrates the sudden illumination of the purified
soul which has cast aside all impediments, and has at
last, in a moment of ecstatic union, beheld the beatific
vision of The One, the Ineffable Source of all things
which is the Goal of all her endeavour.
These meditations, and others not less sublime, have
won for Plotinus a few earnest disciples in almost every
century, and, if we may adapt his own phrase, have
" kindled a golden glory " on many a later page of litera-
ture. They have earned for him a reputation as one of
accepted fact, which rendered it antecedently probable that heaven wag
the first region in the Universe to receive souls. In each of these
passages may not Plotinus be deriving his imagery from some earlier
source, not known to us, which would lend to the epithet ajxdvwv an
appropriateness easily recognised by his hearers ?
412 G. W. Lambert [part
the great mystics, and many people are thus left with the
impression that he was a vague and dreamy thinker. But
if the surface difficulties are surmounted, it will be found
that his thought is fundamentally simple, restrained, and
thoroughly systematic, after the best Greek model.
Passages which sound to the modern ear like highly
imaginative poetry were written by him in the firm belief
that they were at the same time the most profound
science. So long as men of his faith remain, they will be
prepared to wrestle with his difficult Greek, in order that
they may become initiates in his school of wisdom ; and
each of them, when the day of his illumination has come,
must have exclaimed in words that Plotinus himself once
used of his own master, " This is the man I was looking
for." 1

Mr. Stephen MacKemia (Lee Warner). It is not yet finished,
and its early completion is much to be desired. So far the

the volumes already j^rinted.
There is no translation in English parallel with tlie Greek

is in course of preparation by M. E. Brchier (Collection Bude,

A valuable collection of extracts from the Enneads, entitled
Select Passages illustrative of Neo'platonism , has been made by
Professor E. R. Dodds, with a translation •
of tliem in a sejjarate

CONCERNING ME. TEILDING'S REVIEW OF MR.
HUDSON HOAGLAND'S "REPORT ON SITTINGS
WITH MARGERY."
(a) A LETTER FROM MR. EVERARD FEILDING.
To the Editor of the Proceedings of the S.P.R.
5n Montagu Mansions,
Baker Street, W. 1.
1th November, 1926.
Dear Madam,
In Vol. xxxvi of the Proceedings, ]). 159 ff., I contributed
a Review of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's " Report on Sittings
with Margery." In it, for reasons partly drawn from the
Report itseU' and partly from Mr. Bird's Review of it in the
American S.P.R.'s Journal for December last, I criticized
the procedure of the Harvard Committee which had conducted
the Sittings on the ground that, after pledging themselves and
everybody concerned to silence, they had nevertheless issued a
premature report, and notably I criticised the conduct of Mr. Grant
Code, which, on such evidence as was before me, seemed so
strange as to cast a doubt on his good faith and thereby
prejudice the value of Mr. Hoagland's Report. I have re-
ceived certain communications from Mr. Hoagland and Mr.
Code which, inasmuch as they dispute the accuracy of many
of the facts on which I had relied and supply an explanation
of the conduct to which I had taken exception, ought, in my
opinion, to receive the same publicity as my original criticism.
This correspondence, which is too long for complete reproduc-
tion and has required certain modifications immaterial to the
question here at issue, which the writers have left to my
discretion, I now forward, and trust you will find room for it.
101] " Report on Sittings with Margery
"
415
It will be remembered that, though Mr. Hoagland had said
nothing of it in his Report, it appeared from other sources
that Mr. Code alleged that, after an interview with " Margery
"
in which he had told her that the committee had discovered
a normal explanation of the phenomena, he had adjourned
with her to the seance room and held a daylight seance for
the purpose of discussing the situation with " Walter " and
had arranged with him to assist him at the forthcoming
official seance by releasing " Margery's " hand. The holding
of this seance with " Walter " was denied by both " Margery
"
and Dr. Crandon. Mr. Code now sends me the actual notes
he made of it, with an introduction explaining the events
which led up to it. In face of this, I, ])ersonalIy, without
expressing any view on the major issue of whether there are
still grounds for a belief in the " Margery " mediumship,
find it impossible any longer to doubt the good faith of Mi-.
Code, though, while crediting him with the best intentions, I still
question the wisdom of a course which led to such a dubious
position.
I have to thank both Messrs. Hoagland and Code for the
good temper with which they have received my strictures.
At the end of my Reviert' I questioned whether, in the light
of later reported instances of " Margerj'^s " mediumship, viz.
the continuance of the phenomena while the medium is
seated in a glass cabinet with her hands bound outside it,
and her ability to produce the direct voice of " Walter "
notwithstanding the application of Dr. Richardson's voice
machine, the Hoagland Report could be " accepted as de-
finitive." As regards this Mr. Code in a later letter sent me
what he considers wholly adequate explanations of both these
developments, which he claims to have imitated successfully
under similar conditions. As, however, the experiments in
question were not described in detail either in my review or
elsewhere in our Proceedings, I need not trouble you with this
letter.
I am.
Yours faithfully,
EVERARD FeILDING.
416 Mr. Feilding's Review of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part
(b) A LETTER EROM MR. HOAGLAND TO MR. FEILDING.
18 Traill St.,
Cambbidge, Mass., September, 3rd 1926.
Dear Sir,
In your review, appearing in the June Proceedings of
your Society, of my report on the Margery Case in the Nov.
1925 Atlantic Monthly, you have, unfortunately, been led far
astray by radical misstatements of fact made by the Bird-
Crandon group. I shall list a few of these.
In the first place, you have been led to believe that the
pamphlet " Margery-Harvard-Veritas," contains the complete
notes of the Harvard sittings. In a review of the case
printed in the July number of the American Journal of Psy-
chology, Dr. Walter Franklin Prince points out that the notes
in the pamjihlet contain numerous changes, additions, sub-
tractions, omissions and deliberate misdirections. In all,
some 1,440 words have been omitted from our notes, including
important observations fatal to the Crandon cause. Changes
of important sentences have been made which completely
alter their meaning. Dr. Prince found that pen lines had been
drawn through some deleted parts of Dr. Crandon's copies
of the notes, presumably for the printer's benefit.
You consider it an advantage to have read what you term
an "exceedingly able and fair-minded production," by Mr.
Bird. In this connection I should like to state that there is
documentary evidence in the archives of the Boston Society
for Psychic Research, which proves that Mr. Bird twisted and
distorted facts in his possession, including some jjlainly recorded
in the official notes of the sittings. The American Society
for Psychical Research refused to publish an article by Dr.
Prince showing these divergences from fact.
The entire group from Harvard was imanimous in its verdict
of trickery, the only possible disagreement being whether to
any degree the trickery was unconscious. See statement
signed by nine members of the group in the New York Times
and Bostoyi Herald of October 23, 1925. This statement also
contained an item to the effect that my Atlantic Monthly
report was representative of their judgment regarding the
phenomena. Mr. Code did not sign the statement because he
]0i] "Report on Siltings ivith Mmyjerij'^ 417
was several hundred miles aAvay and unavailable at the time.
He has since declared that he would gladly have signed it
had he been given the opportunity.
There was no pledge to silence on the part of the Harvard
group. Ultimate publicity was planned and understood by
all regardless of the, nature of the results. To quote from the
forementioned review by Dr. Prince in the American Journal
of Psyclwlogy,
" Dr. Crandon protested that this [Hoagland's
report in Atlantic Monthly] was a violation of agreement. On
eight grounds appearing in the documents I think this con-
tention imjustified. There is space but to allude to the
principal of these, viz., that Dr. Crandon formally assented
in May to Mr. Hoagland's plan to use the results, if suitable,
for a Ph.D. thesis ; that no intention finally to suppress them
was ever broached ; that Dr. Crandon allowed, against protest,
data about the sittings to be printed in four issues of the
Banner of Life ; that solely for defence of himself and col-
leagues against premature gossip. Professor Shapley on June
29th stipulated that names should not be given out without
specific authorization and that attempts should be made to
avoid publicity ; that this agreement was not signed by Dr.
Crandon and was binding only on those who did sign it ;
that' nine members of the group did authorize giving out a
report after the sittings ended ; that Dr. Crandon wrote a
letter on July 6th, saying that he agreed (to Code) not to
pubhsh the Harvard sittings except with the consent of the
majority of the signers, yet without obtaining such consent he
furnished the notes from which a garbled account appeared
in several issues of the Boston Herald, before the report by
Hoagland came out in Atlantic Monthly."
I should like to add that Professor Shapley who attended
four out of the eight sittings was in favour of giving our
results to the dail^ press. He heartily approved of the Atlantic
Monthly as a source of publication, which incidentally had been
suggested to me by another of the scientists in the group.
Professor Shapley proof-read my report and asked me to add
a footnote stating that he regarded the trance as a hoax.
It should be borne in mind that the Margery case had first
'
reached the public through the pages of a popular magazine,
the Scientific American, and that there had previously been
418 3Ir. Feil<ii)ig\s Revieic of Mr. Hudson HoaglaiuVs [part
widespread newspa^oer i^ublicity regarding it. Our report was
not offered to the American Society of Psychical Research for
reasons which should be apparent. It seemed ahnost certain
that such an offer would have been hopeless. Certain members
of the board of the Boston Society of Psychic Research had
already reported adversely, and this" Society preferred not to
print our rej^ort because it might appear that these persons
were motivated by animus toward the case. Moreover, news-
paper controversy would have inevitably followed a report in
pamphlet form, and we should have been forced to make a
superficial digest of the investigation for the daily press which
would have been inadequate for our purposes. The Atlantic
Monthly seemed to be the only organ available to the large
public already interested in the affair.
Mr. Code has stated to me in writing that he promised
nothing to Dr. Crandon on behalf of the group. Of course,
Mr. Bird was informed of things in confidence. Because of
Mr. Code's sincere friendship for Dr. Crandon and his fear of
the consequences of the possible shock of exposure he urged
us to refrain from publicity, which we did for several months.
During this time Dr. Crandon pressed on with the mediumship
and wrote abusive letters about our group. Since many
knew of our investigation and since our silence was being used
against us, a report was made calculated to stress the possi-
bilities of abnormal psychology as a determinant in the case
and so allow the Crandons to retire as gracefully as possible.
Their retort was more misrepresentations and new tricks.
Mr. Bird's witness of Code's duplication occurred one after-
noon quite informally when the former dropped in for tea.
In the presence of Professor Boring, Professor Shapley and
many others, a dark seance was given at another time and
all of the effects duplicated under precisely the same control
as had been used at the Margery seances. *
Notes dictated on
this occasion read in every respect like those made with
Margery. Her whole repertory was performed and photo-
graphs were taken of " teleplasm " under Lime Street^ con-
ditions, one of our group, Mr. Damon, acting as Dr. Crandon.
There is no secret regarding Mr. Code's conduct. His
1 Dr. Crandon's house, at which the sittings took place, is in Lime Street.
litij "Report on. Sittings ivith Manjani'' 41".)
voluminous correspondence with various members of the group
is open to inspection at the Boston Society for Psychic Re-
search, along with other documents, including certain letters
changed and deleted as published in " Margery-Harvard-
Veritas." These letters will show that Mr. Code acted in
accordance with the best of motives to aid persons whom
he then considered worthy of his consideration. Among the
documents is a report of an interview taking place between
Margery and ]VIr. Code on the afternoon of the last sittmg.
It clearly shows " Walter's " abject surrender. Cojjies of
these notes have been sent with this manuscript to the Society
for Psychical Research. Notes of this conversation were made
by Mr. Code within 24 hours of the interview. No mention
was made of this conversation in my Atlantic article because
Mr. Code wished this regarded as confidential at the time to
spare the Crandons. It was also, in a sense, irrelevant to the
objective problem. Reasons for Mrs. Crandon's willingness to
co-operate with Mr. Code and artifices that she was prepared
to employ had he failed her at the last minute are also on
record.
The glass cabinet and voice machine tricks are compara-
tively simple. Competent observers have reported several
ways by which each of these tricks may be done. A report

national reputation, employed by the A.S.P.R. to investigate
the Crandons has reported adversely. The Crandons are
masters of the psychology of deception. Is it necessary to

the notes made at the time are available at the Boston

American Society for Psychical Research has shown no interest
whatsoever in more complete data offered them by our group.

(c) A LETTER FROM MR. GRANT H. CODE TO MR. FEILDING.
University of Delaware,
Newark, Delaware,
^rd September, 1926.
My Dear Sir,
Ml'. Hudson Hoagland has recently sent me a copy of
the Proceedings for June, which I had not previously seen,
and has asked my permission to send you the notes on my
private sitting with Margery of June 30th, 1925, for which
he has asked me to write an introduction. This I have done.
I symjDathize with you in your difficulties when you try
to arrive at a fair estimate of the recent Harvard investiga-
tion on a basis of Mr. Bird's tendencious and inaccurate
review and the equally inaccurate " Veritas " pamphlet of
Dr. Crandon and others. I am neither surjDrised nor offended
to discover the opinion you have formed of myself, and yet
I can scarcely let that opinion pass unchallenged.
You ask three questions concerning my behaviour. (1) Is
Code telling the truth about the private interview ? I can
only assure you that I am and ask you to consider carefully
the notes which I am furnishing you through Mi'. Hoagland.
(2) Was his imitation of the phenomena really as successful
as claimed, and was it performed in the same conditions of
control ?
On the evening of June 29th, immediately after the sitting,
I endeavoured to convince Mr. Damon and Mr. Hoagland that
a large part of the phenomena which we had witnessed at
the Harvard sittings could be performed by freeing the feet
in the maimer described. I wore a luminous mark on my
forehead, luminous wristlets, and luminous anklets. JNIr.
Damon held one of my hands, Mr. Hoagland the other. That
gives you the conditions of control. I constantly urged Mr.
lul] "Report on Sittings with Margery" 421
Damon and IVIr. Hoagland to watch my feet. At first I wore
tennis shoes over socks. I found that I could not work
easily with socks over my toes. I then removed the socks
and wore the tennis shoes over my bare feet. The shoes were
loose enough to shj^ out of. Mrs. Crandon had worn satin
slippers over bare feet. The apparatus was the same that
had been used during the sitting. That gives you the con-
ditions. Mr. Damon and Mr. Hoagland could not detect
visually my evasion of the luminous ankle control. I ran
through the principal phenomena of the seance rapidly. As a
result of using the foot, I produced without intending to do
so various effects incidental to the phenomena, such as the
movement of the handle on the weight lifting machine in a
particular direction for a particular distance, effects that
corresponded to the effects produced by Walter.
My elaborate seance for the Harvard group, to which Mr.
Hoagland and Dr. Boring make reference, was produced under
precisely Margery's conditions of control. I can furnish you
dictaphone notes and photographs if you are interested. As
far as the spirit extras are concerned, the photographic effects
are crude. The extras were intentionally burlesque. But the
effects could be improved by practice in spirit photography.
This seance differed from one of Margery's in that I produced
at one seance and under one set of conditions phenomena
which I had seen Margery produce at a number of seances
under varying conditions.
The seance I gave for Mr. and Mrs. Bird was hastily im-
provised one afternoon. I beheve I reproduced the bellbox
phenomena, the telekinesis, and the silhouetting in good
Lime Street style. My teleplasms would not stand tactual
inspection. I am no svngeon and have no supply of anatomi-
cal specimens. The white lacy teleplasm I had never seen
Margery produce and had imitated from a photograph. Mrs.
Bird criticized it severely and indicated how mine differed
from Margery's. I have since produced that effect better.
Later in the seance, I was making no attempt to deceive Bird,
but was simply trying to see how near I could come to
various effects he described which I had never seen. My
levitations in red light were bad. My methods of loading
apparatus into the cabinet to evade detection by physical
422 Mr. FeUdinc/s Review of Mr. Hudson HoaglancVs [part
examination I believe opened Bird's eyes. My chief reason
for thinking so is that a fairly elaborate series of experiments
at Lime Street in which he was interested were dropjjed soon
after I had told him how I thought the effects could be pro-
duced and had demonstrated as best I could with the materials
at hand.
(3) Your third question : assuming the freedom of a leg
in the first six sittings prior to that of June 29th, could all
the phenomena then manifested have been produced by it 1
No. The freeing of the right hand from Dr. Crandon's con-
trol and the use of the fake hand were necessary for some
effects. See the accounts of silhouetting in the notes. The
" star-fish " was the fake hand. It could not have been the
foot.
I pass over your compliments on my lack of common sense.
My associates on the faculty of Harvard College (who have
known me longer than Bird or the Cranclons) or General
Summerall and other officers of the First Division, American
Expeditionary Forces, to the staff of which I was attached
during the recent war, might enlighten you on that score.
By the way, I am not so excessively young as Mr. Bird might
lead you to svxppose.
Since I have never been given an opportunity to state my
opinions about the mediumship publicly, you naturally form a
very inadequate notion of them from the satirical statements
of persons hostile to myself. My opinions are defined at some
length in correspondence on file at the Boston Society for
Psychic Research, where any responsible person may inform
himself.
I have never contended that the entire mediumship was to
be explained by innocent subconscious fraud. Dr. Crandon
has frequently stated in my presence that he considers it
justifiable to help out when normal means fail. I have,
however, stressed the possibilities of subconscious automatism,
amnesia, and posthypnotic suggestion, as well as the mystifica-
tion produced when several tricksters sit in the same circle
and all contribute to the effects. Although I am convinced
of the disingenuousness of both the Crandons and Bird, I have
to note that they all appear to preserve some faith in the
genuinfiness of the mediumshij^. To a person who has been
101] "Report on Sittings ivith Margery'' 423
associated with them for some time, this apjjearance of behef
is very impressive and Avants explanation. My notes on the
private sitting will clarify your further speculations on that
score.
If there are any questions which you or any member of
the Enghsh Society for Psychical Research would like to ask
me, I shall do my best to answer them. I shall be glad to
furnish copies of any documents in my possession for your
inspection, with the understanding that I do not feel at liberty
to contribute to a public discussion of the Crandons as private
jDersons.
Yours resj^ectf Lilly,
Grant H. Code.
P.S.—I observe that you accuse me of falsifying the records of
June 30th, on the basis of dictated statements that you find it
difficult to reconcile. Throughout the seance my hand lay palm
up on Mrs. Crandon's right knee or leg (the position shifted).
My fingers clasped her right hand, wrist, or forearm. She
varied the position of the wristlet by forcing her arm down
through it or dra\^'ing it back to position against my fingers.
I actually had perfect tactual control throughout the sitting
and so reported. I did not report the movement of the
wristlet nor the manipulation of the arm and hand till after
the sitting. In dealing with IVIi's. Crandon I acted on the
assumption that her trance was genuine and that Walter was
responsible with me for the trickery. Before reporting to my
colleagues, I described the seance to Mrs. Crandon as if she
had been miconscious of the events of it as she pretended to
be. She agreed with me that it was necessary to report
everjrthing to my colleagues.
{(I) MR. CODE'S PRIVATE SITTING WITH ''MARGERY."
Intkodxjctory Note.
The following notes on a private sitting with Margery,"
the Boston medium (Mrs. Le Roi G. Crandon), are part of a
mass of information which I have been unwilling to publish.
In giving this document publicity I am, therefore, obliged to
424 Mr. Feilding's Review of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part
explain, in the first place, why I was unwilling to publish
any part of my information in this case, and, in the second
place, why I now publish a document which I was formerly
unwilling to publish.
I was first introduced to the Margery mediumship on October
25th, 1924, not as an investigator, but as a friend of a friend
of the Crandons. From that time until I left Boston in the
autumn of 1925 to begin work at the University of Delaware,
Dr. Crandon received me as a friend, treated me with his
well-known hospitality and gave me frequent opportunities to
observe the phenomena of the Margery mediumship. When
Mr. Hoagland began the series of private sittings which eventu-
ally led to the formal investigation in the psychological labora-
tory of Harvard University, it was " Walter," the control, who
marked my absence and insisted on inviting me to be present
at the next sitting. Thus, it was directly due to my friend-
ship with the Crandons that I became a member of Mr.
Hoagland's committee.
My friendship for the Crandons affected my position as an
investigator in several ways. It gave me an especial interest
in the human problem involved in the mediumship, quite apart
from the physical phenomena of it. It made me consider the
effects of my discoveries as an investigator upon the Crandons
as persons to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship.
When I was finally convinced by personal observation, supported
by the testimony of others, that the physical phenomena of
the mediumship were produced by trickery, I could not
bring myself to believe that a description of these tricks was
an adequate explanation of the entire mediumship. In fact,
it seemed to me that an account of these tricks published
without a study of the subjective phenomena and of the
human relations behind them would give, not a true, but a
false idea both of the mediumship and of the persons involved
in it. Yet, as a member of an investigation committee, I had
been limited to a study of the jihysical phenomena. Upon
these phenomena only could I make a public report. The
evidence which I could give that bore on the subjective pheno-
mena and on the human side of the mediumship I felt that
I had obtained in confidence and could not publish. Therefore
r gave my complete view of the case to the Crandons and to
101] ' " Report on Sittings with Margery " 425
my fellow investigators and opposed as far as I was able
publicity of any kind.
It so happened that my observations of the trickery in-
volved in the physical phenomena were important to Mr.
Hoagland's case against the mediumship. The Crandons and
their pubKcist, Mr. Bird, decided that the easiest way to dispose
of the results of the Harvard investigation was to destroy my
credit as a witness. Indeed, Mr. Bird was so frank as to
write me that he could not make good his case without making
his review of Mr. Hoagland's article in the Atlantic Monthly
something in the nature of a personal attack on me ! In a
series of letters, Mr. Bird warned me of the attack that would
be made on me, outlined the attack, and advised me that the
less I had to say the better I Mrs. Crandon wrote me that if
I thought the phenomena were all tricks she wished I would
not write anything about them. I disregarded these warnings
in a public letter to the New York Tribune in which I sup-
ported the Harvard group.
In the daily papers, in an article by Mr. Bird published in
the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research,
in a pamphlet published by Dr. Crandon and some of his
friends in public addresses, and in private letters and conversa-
tion, Mr. Bird's threats have been made good in every particular.
The most fantastic falsehoods have been circulated against me.
The notes on the private sitting contain my promise to Mrs.
Crandon and to " Walter " not to inform Dr. Crandon of that
sitting. With Mrs. Crandon's knowledge, I informed the other
investigators (excepting Mr. Bird, who was not a member of
our committee) in confidence. On our side, that confidence
was preserved. Neither the official notes, ]\'Ir. Hoagland's
article, nor any statement by any member of our committee
contains any reference to it prior to ]\Ir. Bird's own account,
in connection with which, on the authority of Mrs. Crandon, he
attacked my entire good faith in the investigation. In spite of
my silence concerning this sitting, the Crandons have referred
to it repeatedly.
In the Boston Herald and the New York Times, of October
23rd, 1925, appeared a letter signed by Dr. Crandon and
containing the following statement :
" An alleged private sitting
of Mr. Code with Margery never occurred."
2e
426 Mr. Feilding's Reviexv of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part
In an interview published in the same places on October
24th, 1925, Mrs. Crandon is quoted as saying :
" Mr. Code, I
understand, says he had a private sitting at which I confessed.
This is not true."
Both of these references are prior to the publication of Mr.
Hoagland's article, which the Crandons evidently feared would
contain an account of the private sitting in violation of my
word given to Mrs. Crandon.
On page 720 of Volume XIX. of the Journal of the American
Society, Mr. Bird discusses the private sitting and alleges that
Dr. Crandon first heard of it through the public prints. The
first public reference to the sitting that I have been able to
discover is contained in Dr. Crandon's own letter.
In a footnote on page 25 of the Crandon pamphlet, ironically
entitled "Veritas," the fact of the private sitting is denied
on the authority of two anon3Tnous affidavits.
Assuming, in view of Dr. Crandon's public letter of October
23rd, that by some means he had received inaccurate informa-
tion concerning the private sitting, on October 24th, I sent
JVIrs. Crandon a copy of my notes on the sitting and asked
her to give them to Dr. Crandon. In response to subsequent
inquiry, I had a letter from Dr. Crandon dated November 10th,
1925, and an undated letter from Mi-s. Crandon postmarked
November 20th, 1925, stating that they had not received my
letter and notes. On November 18th, 1925, I sent each a
copy of the notes by registered post. Mrs. Crandon wrote
that she couldn't remember the sitting and that Dr. Crandon
did not believe my account of it. She added that her letter
was " purely intellectual, not personal," and that she would
be glad to do anything that she could for me. I took that
to mean that telling the truth was not a thing she could do
for me.
'What Dr. Crandon's state of belief concerning this sitting
may be, I can only surmise. It is quite possible that he is
honest in supposing me to be a har. Certainly, Mrs. Crandon's
denial of the facts leaves me free, if it does not actually
oblige me, to affirm them.
Grant Hyde Code.
101] " Report on Sittings witli Margery "
427
Record of a Private Sitting at 10 Li.me Street,
June 30th, 1925.
Convinced that the physical phenomena were in a fair way
to explanation, I directed my attention to the human problem.
The Harvard sittings had pretty well eliminated Dr. Crandon
as an accomplice, except that his hand control was suspect
and that, once the ease with which the luminous bands could
be removed was shown, there was no certainty that he had
not been able to remove his left Avrist band or his ankle band
and thus assist in the manipulation. Fortunately, Hoagland's
asking Walter to have Dr. Ci'andon permanently removed from
a position of control, and Walter's appointment of me to take
Dr. Crandon"s place, had put me in a position to observe the
bearing of Dr. Crandon's control on the phenomena. At the
same time, I was fairly sure that all the phenomena at the
Harvard sittings could be explained by operation by the Psychic.
Considering the effect of a blank sitting, I inferred that it
would confirm the opinion of the observers that the phenomena
\\'ere produced by physical manipulation on the Psychic's part,
that this opinion would be revealed to the Ci'andons, and that
the sittings on which the Crandons had been led to Ijase so
much hope would be brought to an abrupt end. All my
observations of Dr. Crandon had pointed to his belief in the
phenomena and a profound religious faith ^\•hich he based on
them. I therefore feared that a sudden exjjosure on the part
of a group of observers in which he had placed so much trust
would give him a shock that might be dangerous. I accordingly
decided that a blank sitting must be prevented at all costs.
Early in the afternoon of June 30th, T called on Mrs.
Crandon and found her alone. As far as her part in the
jjhenomena was concerned there were two hypotheses : that
she was acting voluntarily and consciously with complete kno\\'-
ledge and memory of what she was doing, or that her behaviour
was largely automatic and the amount of lier volition, con-
sciousness, and memory was indeterminate. I was prepared
to test both hypotheses and to bring about a successful seance
in either case.
Accordingly, I began by describhig the foot episode of the
night before and exjalaining my observations of the manipula-
428 Mr. Feilding's Review of Mr. Hudson Hoagland's [part
tion of the aiilile bands and apparatus as well as my subse-
quent duplications in some detail. I told her that I had i
not come to her to get any sort of statement, and did not I
^vant her to tell me anything, but simply wanted to protect ,
her and Dr. Crandon from the possible serious effects of an i]
exposure. Her reaction toward the description of the
operation of the feet was incredulity and bewilderment.
I further impressed her with the possible serious consequences
of a blank and told her that I would be willing to " manifest
"
myself in order to prevent a blank. Her reaction was some-
thing like this :
" You frighten me, Code. I see how serious
the situation is, I'll do anything you say. But I don't know
what to do. I'll do something for you I've never done for
anyone else. I'll give you my word of honour that I never
have done any of these things." My impression was that she
v/as really frightened at the possible consequence of a blank,
sincere in saying that she kncAv nothing about trickery, sincere
in her bewilderment at the evidence I gave her that the
material manifestations were really produced by her right foot.
I then*] suggested automatic action of which she would be
unconscious. Her reaction was that she dislUted the idea of
automatism, because it seemed to her to mean that there was
something the matter^ with her. As I continued my explanation
of the possibilities of automatism imder hypnotic influence, her
reaction was fear as she saw the possibilities. I explained that
the means of producing trance, the means of beginning the
sittings in general, were in line with hypnotic methods ;
power-
ful suggestions that certain effects were to be produced, placing
the subject in a situation that inhibited voluntary movement,
the use of monotonous sound to dull the attention, repeated
low music and the conversation of Dr. Crandon, continued
suggestion. Her reaction was increasing conviction and fear.
I was now fairly sure of my ground, and in order to prevent
any serious effect on her by too sudden realisization of the
complete situation, I distracted her attention Avith further
consideration of what Avas to be done about the seance
scheduled for that night. She was willing to do whatever I said.
I represented that it would be dangerous to do anything
without consulting Walter, because if the Psychic and I tried
to trick, Walter would come through, expose us, and produce
101] " Report on Sittings with Margery " 429
a worse effect than a blank. I accordingly asked whether we
coukl not call up Walter. She said that Walter's coming
through in the day time was almost unheard of, and that she
was sure he wouldn't. I enlarged upon Walter's character,
said I had observed that he never failed in an emergency,
and that I was sure he would be listening in on our conversa-
tion and would come through. Mi's. Crandon hnally consented
to sit.
We then went to the seance room, which 1 darkened as
much as possible, the bk.ck curtains in daylight producing not
darkness, but a dim light sufficiently clear for perfect observa-
tion. I took Dr. CIrandon's usual place on the stool at Mrs.
Crandon's right, and, holding both of the Psychic's hands,
began a low conversation, telling stories about the sitters, etc.
Presently trance came on, with the Psychic's head turned as
far away from me as possible. Convulsive movements freed
her left hand, which I permitted to escape. It then took a
position as if held by a sitter on the other side, the tips of
the fingers lightly clipping the edge of the cabinet. Then
Walter's voice came through the lips of the Psychic. It was
thrown against the wall of the cabinet and reflected so that
the exact position of the sound was very deceptive to the ear.
I reproduce the conversation as exactly as possible.
Walteb. Hello, Code.
Code. Hello, Walter. Good boy ! Great ! I knew
you would come through in an emergency.
Walteb. What's the matter. Code ?
Code. You see, Walter, we are all pretty much dis-
. turbed about the Psyche's right ankleband
being off at that last sitting.
Walter. Of course it was off.
Code. Good for you, Walter.
Walter. Sure it was off. I said it wasn't in order to
protect you from your boob friend. He was
ready to jumj) on you. I said it wasn't off
to protect you, and then I put it on again.
Those anlilets Avere too loose.
Code. Of course they were. But you see, Walter

anklet that the whole business is trickery,
and if there is a blank to-night they will be
sure. I'm afraid there will be, some sort of
a blow up that Avill have a bad effect on
everybody. I'm very fond of you and Roy
and the Psychic and I don't want anything to
happen that will hurt them.
-Whew !
Adhesive tape is going to be substituted for elastic
tape on the ankles to-night, so that any further
trickery with the feet is impossible.
I never tricked you, Code.
I know. But I thought it was best to tell you
about things in advance and let you see how
serious the situation is.
Whew ! (pause). What do you want me to do,
Code.
I'he very best thing in the world would be for
you to come through strong with a genuine
teleplasm and do everything you have been
doing right along. Any change in the pheno-
mena are going to be suspicious, almost as
suspicious as a blank.
I don't know what I can do till I get there.
The kid is sick and I can't work very well
at such times. I never can tell what I can
do till I get there.
That's very unfortunate, Walter. On account
of the probable effects of a blank.
Whew ! (Pause). What are A\e going to do.
Code ?
Well, Walter, I'm ready to assist in any way I
can. You know you arranged last night to
have me in Dr. Crandon's usual jjosition.
(Pause). What are we going to do, Code ?
I'll manifest, myself, if you say so, Walter.
J^ut I'm afraid that would be too dangerous.
No, don't you do anything. (Pause). What
are we going to do. Code ?
I don't know, Walter. Whatever you say.

the fingers clipping the cloth with which the

The Psychic began to come out of the trance, but before
she was fully out, the telephone I'ang and she jumped up,
staggering against the table. Code asked her how she felt,
and she complained of a pain in her neck, which had been
held stiffly, of a pain in her eye, and of feeling dizzy. Code
told her to sit down and rest a few minutes. She did so and
dhected Code to answer the telephone, saying that it would
probably be Roy. C'ode went across the hall into the bedroom
and picked up the phone, but heard the maid using the phone
downstahs saying that she thought Mrs. Crandon was out.
He returned to the Psychic, who then called up and found
that Dr. Crandon wanted her to drive him somewhere, so that
there was not much opportunity for discussing the trance with
the Psychic. Code, however, described the conversation and
automatic movements rapidly and assured her that everything
would be all right for the night.

REVIEW.
Collected Pwpers, by Sigmund Freud, M.D., LL.D. Authorised
Translation under the supervision of Joan Riviere. The
Hogarth Press and The Institute of Psycho-Analysis.
4 Vols. 1924-1925.
Perhaps no Avriter of the present day has so often had reason
to cry " Save me from mj friends " as Professor Freud.
During the past few years many books, purporting to expound
the doctrines of psycho-analysis, have been published in this
country and in America, and have been read by those who
have not had the opportunity or the desire to read Freud's
own works. One of the consequences of this has been that
there is wide misunderstanding of what Freud actually teaches ;
for many of the writers of these expository books were them-
selves imperfectly acquainted with the subject they set out to
exj)ound. Now, however, there is no excuse for any serious
student being ignorant of what Freud's doctrines really are,
for an admirable series of translations of his works is being
brought out in this country, under the general editorship of
Dr. Ernest Jones. Not the least important of these are the
four volumes of Collected Papers which form the subject of
this notice. Under the super\'ision of Mxs. Riviere the trans-
lators of the first, second and fourth volumes have maintained
a remarkably high level of excellence ; and this is also true
of the third volume which consists of five case-histories trans-
lated by Ml", and Rlrs. James Strachey.
Some people seem to imagine that the doctrme of psycho-
analysis sprang fully-formed from the brain of Professor Freud.
The truth is, however, that the develoiiment of psycho-analytic
theory and practice has been a very gradual process. In the
course of that development many changes have occurred, and
the student v/ho has not followed closely the various steps in
434 Review [part
the process may have some difficulty in reconcihng the present-
day teaching of psycho-analj'sts with some of the statements
in their earlier wiitings. As their clinical experience widened
fresh problems arose whose solution necessitated the introduc-
tion of new hypotheses and the abandonment of some of those
formerly employed.
From the beginning Freud has l)een his own acutest critic,
and the most important changes that have taken place, both
in theory and in practice, have been introduced by himself,
although several important suggestions have come from some
of his more distinguished followers. When in the course of
his investigations some new point of view occurred to him,
or some modification of his former teaching became necessary,
ho usually juade public his discovery or his changed attitude
through the medium of Journals specially devoted to psycho-
analysis. Those who were not professional students of the
subject were not likely to see these papers, and when the
views put forward in them were accepted by some more popu-
lar writer and were referred to without any explanation of
how the changed point of view liad come about, the reader
sometimes found it difficult to reconcile the new teaching with
the old.
In these volumes the sequence of the changes introduced
into Freudian Psychology in the course of its growth may be
followed with ease, and it may he anticipated that their publica-
tion will he followed by a more adequate understanding of
the doctrines of psycho-analysis by those who desire to know
wliat bearing these doctrines have on their own life and work
or wliat part tJiey may play in the movement of thought in
our time.
The first volume contains Freud's early papers, and carries
us from 1893 to 1905. The second volume includes all papers
published between 1906 and 1924, except those on the special
topics to which the third and fourth volumes are devoted.
The third volume is in some respects the most important, for
it consists of records of cases studied analj^ically by Freud
himself. The fourth volume contains the most difficult of
Freud's writings, his papers on what he calls Metapsychology,
and several essays dealing with some applications of psycho-
analysis to non-medical tojDics.
101] Review 435
Among the papers on Metapsychology is included the article
on the Unconscious which Professor Freud wrote specially for
our Proceedings in 1912 ; and among those on applied psycho-
analysis is one on dreams and telepathy which should be of
interest to our readers. Freud exj^laius the paucity of the
material on which this latter paper is based—two communica-
tions from correspondents in Germany—by the fact that he
has never experienced a telepathic dream himself, and during
twenty-seven years of work as an analyst (this paper was
published in 1922), he ha.s never been in a position to observe
a truly telepathic dream in any of his patients. In the
course of the paper Freud writes as if he were a believer in
the occurrence of telepathy, but at its close he takes care to
remove this impression ; he says he has no opinion on the
matter and knows nothing about it. But for his purpose he
assumes that telepathy does occur, and he shows how it is
related to the psycho-analytic theory of dreams.
He thinks that not everything going on in the mind diuring
sleep should be called dream, for, " a dream without condensa-
tion, distortion, dramatization, above all, without wish-fulfil-
ment, surely hardly deserves the name." But he refers to
" the incontestable fact that sleep creates favourable conditions
for telepathy," and he would regard a " pure telepathic dream,"
that is to say, a telepathic experience in a state of sleep,"
as having no more to do with dream than any experience in
waking life. A dream is a product of the dreamer's mental
Life, Avhereas a purely ""
telepathic dream " is a " perception of
something external." On the other hand it is possible for a
telepathic experience during sleep, such as a message or an
intimation of events taking place at a distance, to be worked
into the structure of a dream properly so called. When this
occurs the telepathic material is utilized in the dream-making,
in the same way as any other content of the mind may be,
and the psycho-analjrtical interpretation of the dream is m
no way affected thereby.

REPORT 1 OF A DEMONSTRATION OF EXPERIMENTS
ON HYPNOTISM BY MR. GUSTAF WALLENIUS
{PHIL. MAG., UPSALA), AT THE VIIIth INTER-
NATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CONGRESS AT
GRONINGEN (SEPT. ]926).
By F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless.
A EESEAUCH was Carried out by the late Professor S.
Alrutz of the University of Upsala, by means of which
he claimed to have proved the operation of a specific
influence from the nervous system of the hypnotiser—
a
" nervous effluence "—in the production of the hypnotic
phenomena induced by passes."
Mrs. Alrutz wished a demonstration of her late husband's
experiments to be made before a small group of psycho-
logists, and she said that Professor Alrutz 's results had
been confirmed (and to some extent amplified) b}^ his
assistant Mr. Gustaf Wallenius. Arrangements were,
therefore, made for Mr. Wallenias to bring to Groningen
one of the subjects of Professor Alrutz's own experiments
in order that the results obtained might be demonstrated.
Before describing the demonstration given by Mr.
Wallenius, it may be as well to give a brief account of
the results claimed by Professor Alrutz, and of the
manner in which they conflict with currently accepted
theories of hypnosis.
^ This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on Decem-
ber 21st, 1926.
^ An account of this research was published in Swedish as Till nerv-
systemets dynamik, etc. Summaries of the work were also published in
English in The Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Eesearch, Vol.
XXXII., 1921, and in the Scandinavian Scientific Review, Vol. III., 1924.

438 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [PART
The theory of hypnosis which would be most generally
accepted at the present day is one which owes something
to Braid and something to Liebault. It is regarded as
a condition closely resembling, and in many respects
identical with, normal sleep —a sleep, however, which has
been artificially produced by another person, and which
is characterised by a rapport with that other person.
The efficacy of difi^erent methods of indvicing the hypnotic
state is supposed to be largely determined by the expecta-
tion of the subject that they will produce the state—an
exjjectation induced by indications (verbal or otherwise)
from the experimenter. In other words, the production
of the state is supposed to be largely the result of sugges-
tion. Similarly the phenomena developed during hypnosis
(other than those characteristic of all sleep and the rapport
itself), i.e., automatisms, local anaesthesias and disturbances
of sensibiUty, etc., are supposed to be products of sug-
gestion. This is the part of the modern theory of hypnosis
which we owe to Liebault.
It is also recognised, however, that certain kinds of
stimuli (constant or constantly recurring sounds, rhythmical
passes made before the subject's body, the strained visual
fixation of bright objects, etc.) may tend to produce the
hypnotic state independently of the expectation of the
subject. In this belief, the modern theory follows Braid.
It still, however, cliflers sharply from the original theory
of Mesmer in believing that, in order to produce their
effect, stimuli of this order must be perceived by the
subject. Mesmer, on the other hand, believed that
downward passes produced their hypnotic efl^ect by the
direct action of an influence from the nervous system
of the hypnotiser on the hypnotised subject, and that
this efiiect would occur even if the hypnotised subject
had no knowledge of what the hypnotiser was doing, and
that passes in the opposite direction removed the hypnotic
condition in the same way.
It was the truth of this hypothesis of the direct action
from the nervous system of the operator in the production
of hypnotic phenomena that Professor Alrutz claimed to
have proved. His method of experimentation was as
102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 439
follows. The subject of the experiment was put into a
Light hypnotic trance in which (as is usual) sensory
hyperaesthesia appeared. This hyperaesthesia was shown
(as well as in other ways) by the subject feeling as
painful the contact of an adjustable needle algesimeter
adjusted to give a pressure of 2 gms. which was felt
only as a light contact in the normal condition of the
skin.
The head of the subject was covered with a black
velvet cloth in order that he might not see what the
operator was doing, and the arms were covered with
sheets of glass in order to eliminate the possibility of
feeling the direction of passes made over them. The
effect of making upward or downward passes over either
of the arms was then investigated. Professor Alrutz
reported that he found that making downward passes
over either arm caused that arm to become anaesthetic
and analgesic while the arm on the opposite side of the
body showed an increased hyperaesthesia. Making upward
passes over one arm, on the other hand, caused that
arm to show increased hyperaesthesia while the opposite
arm showed diminished sensitivity. The intervention of
glass or plates of metal between the subject's arm and
the hand making the passes did not prevent the effect of
the " effluence," but thick cardboard and flannel were
impervious to it. If, therefore, a wad of flannel or
cardboard were interposed between two metal plates and
the whole were placed over the arm before the passes
were made, it was found that the sensibility remained
unchanged over that part of the arm covered by the
impervious material, while the rest of the arm showed
the changes resulting from the particular Idnd of passes
made. Professor Alrutz also said that the expected results
foUowed from this method even when the passes and the
examination of sensibflity were made by someone who was
in ignorance of the position of the impermeable pad.
This he calls the non-informed method.
Amongst other phenomena described are irradiation, or
the spreading of the hyperaesthesia on one side of the
body and the anaesthesia on the other, over the whole
440 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Tliouless [part
of the sides of the body so that " the middle sagittal
line of the body becomes strictly the borderline " {8.P.B.
Proc, Vol. XXXII. p. 159). The changes in sensibility then
affected the special sense organs on the two sides ; the nostril
and eye on the hyperaesthetic side became hyperaesthetic while
those on the other side became anaesthetic. Alrutz also stated
that the nervous effluence could be transmitted along a
rod of glass, and that this transmission was shown by
the effect of the ojjerator pointing with a glass rod at
the base of one of the fingers, Avhich was found to cause
that finger to be extended.
The time that it was possible to devote to Mr. Wallenius's
demonstration at Groningen was very strictly limited.
We, therefore, concentrated on a repetition of the experi-
ment by the non-informed method in which passes are
made over one arm covered by two sheets of zinc with
a pad of thick card-board between them, and it is claimed
that while the sensibility of the rest of the forearm is
changed by the passes there remains under the pad a
patch of unchanged sensibility.
We chose this experiment because it was one in which
it was easy to gauge the success obtained, and to apply
to it various methods of control. If, moreover, it suc-
ceeded under satisfactorily controlled conditions it would
be a crucial proof of the necessity for some such hypo-
thesis as Professor Alrutz put forward. Mr. Wallenius
has made a protest (printed below), against our procedure.
He apparently wished to give a demonstration of his
whole research. That would have been interesting, but
quite unconvincing to those who required pi'oof that there
was any agent at work other than the normal processes
of suggestion and perceptual hyperaesthesia in hypnosis.
Time did not permit of both an extended uncontrolled
demonstration and of a single properly controlled experi-
ment, and of the two alternatives there could be no
doubt as to which we should choose.
Our reason for not choosing the extended demonstration
was not only that such a demonsti-ation is always incon-
clusive as evidence when the reality of a phenomenon is
in question. There were also special reasons connected
iifi] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 441
with the unsatisfactory technique of Mr. Wallenius.
Professor Alrutz himself states that he carried out his
experiments in absohite silence. This is obviously a
necessary precaution to avoid the possibility that the
subject may discover, if not by the actual words of the
ojjerator, at least by his tone, whether the results which
were being produced w^ere in the direction expected.
This i^recaution Mr. Wallenius did not observe, and his
frequent remarks to the subject and ejaculations, would
have rendered any experiments made by any other than
the non-informed method of no value at all as evidence.
Before the demonstration, Mr. Wallenius himself in-
spected all arrangements and apjaaratus and cut also in
our presence and in that of the subject, the piece of
cardboard, its size being about 10 cm. long and as wide
as the zinc box itself, so that it might be sufficiently big
to give a distinct projection on the underlying arm.
First Demonstration.
September lOfh, 11.15 a.m., in a room of the j^sycbological
laboratory in the University building of Groningen.
Present, besides Mr. Wallenius (G. W.) and the subject
(S) a young Swedish man : Prof. P. Janet, Prof. W.
MacDougall, Dr. F. H. G. van Loon, Prof. F. Roels,
Prof. C. Spearman and Dr. R. H. Thouless.
It was arranged that Dr. van Loon should act as
interpreter and write a detailed record of the experiments,
whilst Dr. Thouless would stay outside the room and put
the piece of cardboard into the zinc box. This box was
made of two zinc plates, and after the cardboard was
put in, it was closed all round the margin by means of
sticking-plaster.
During the last part of the experiment, Dr. Thouless
stayed outside the demonstration room. This was arranged
so that not only could the position of the piece of cardboard
not be perceived by sight or feeling, but also that no
influence could be exerted through telepatlw from a person
in the same room.
During these experiments the sensibility of the arm
to pain was examined with an aesthesiometer, the pressure
442 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part
of which could be varied. The two grams pressure which
was used gave a slight sensation of pain to a normal
person.
The subject is sitting in a chair with support for his
head, his arms resting in open cardboard boxes covered
with glass plates. The face is covered with a thick
black cloth.
At first a few demonstrations are made which are not
connected in any way with the experiment which was
asked for (reading of optotypes, solving a few simple
multiplying problems : 7 x 8—answer 56, 5 x 6—answer 30).
Then the sensibility of the subject for pain (by aesthe-
siometer), light touch (with a pad of cotton wool) and
cold (with a metal rod) are examined by G. W. These
appear to be normal, right and left the same. The
subject says that he feels at ease. He is then brought
into a hypnotic state by G. W. who stares into his eyes
from a short distance away (about 15 cms.).
When asked after a few moments to open his eyes, he
cannot do so. G. W. then gives him the verbal sugges-
tion not to sleep too deeply.
An examination of sensibility (by G. W.) : needle
pricks (with same aesthesiometer) are now felt as pain,
right and left arms the same, apparently stronger than
before. Light touch and cold are well perceived, both
right and left.
The subject now makes a few spontaneous movements
with his head and arms. When asked by G. W. whether
he feels at ease he complains of feeling hot under the
cloth. This is taken off for a few moments, then laid
over his head again.
At 11.30, G. W. starts making passes. These are made
in a quiet tempo with both hands and arms downwards
and making stroking movements above both arms of the
stibject (but withoiit contact). He is standing in front
of the subject and the passes are performed so that his
finger tips remain at about 1 or 2 cm. distance from the
glass cover. After the downward stroke G. W. brings
back his arms in a somewhat quicker upward and outward
movement.
102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 443
After five passes, examination of sensibility of arms by
G. W. : light touch on both arms felt as itching, pain on
both arms strongly felt more than before the passes.
[Result irregular
—
i.e., not in accordance with Professor
Alrutz's theory.]
After another five passes the same result.
Now G. W. stands more to one side of the subject and
performs the passes with his right hand only over the
subject's right arm and in an upward direction.
After five passes pricks felt more strongly right than left.
After seven more upward passes : pricks with needle
(aesthesiometer) no longer felt as pam on left arm, no
reflex movements. On right arm and hand pricks jjro-
duce a painful sensation shown at once by reflex move-
» ments, (lifting up of hand). [Result regular.]
It seems to the observers that G. W. whilst examining
^ the sensibility, makes more movements and talks more
than is necessary. Also the reflex movements of the
subject seem to be a little " exaggerated " ; he is obvi-
ously less quiet than at the beginning.
Six more upward passes : pricks on right arm now
perceived again less intensely as " itching." (" Es kitzelt
rechts," G. W. explams.)
Four passes more : only itching on right arm when
pricked with needle. Light touch with pad of cotton
wool : itches on left arm, no reaction on right arm.
Seven more passes : examination of sensibility gives
no result, the subject not showing any sign of pain.
G. W. waits a few moments, then starts again upon a
series of five passes, upward over the right arm. After
two series there appears again to be a difference in sensi-
bility between right and left arm, however rather indis-
tinct.
After five more upward passes, pricks are felt much more
strongly on right arm than on left.
At 11.45 G. W. suddenly takes off the cloth and now
shows us that the whole left side of the subject's body is
analgesic {to the pai^i stimtdiis used) and insensible to
light touch as well. After readjusting the cloth, G. W.
again makes several upward passes over the right arm.
444 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part
Then, on a sign from G. W., Dr. van Loon brings in
the zinc plates, between which Dr. Thouless in another
room has already fixed a piece of cardboard in the
manner already described. This zinc box is now fixed
over the left (insensible) arm so that it is quite free
from the underlying arm (the glass plates already having
been removed).
G. W. again makes upward passes over this left arm.
After the first series of five passes G. W. examines the
sensibility and the subject shows signs of pain when
pricked near the elbow.
After a second series of passes, i>ain is now also shown
on the back of the hand just above the knucldes.
After a third series, the areas of sensibility are increas-
ing, from the middle of the fingers to half-way along
the back of the hand and from the elbow to about 10 cm.
beneath it.
After the fourth series, pain felt from second phalanx
to a little above the wrist, and in a zone of about 12 cm.
under the elbow.
According to this result the cardboard must be on
a spot from a little above the wrist to about 12 cm.
below the elboAv. This place and its limits are marked
upon the zinc box, which is taken into the other room
and opened in the presence of all who assisted at the
demonstration, with the exception of G. W. and his
subject.
The piece of cardboard is not found on the marked
part but above it, overlapping it by about 1 cm. (See Fig. 1.)
During the oj)ening of the box, G. W. was alone with
the subject. The result of the experiments was not told
to him.
Second Demonstration.
Conditions similar, but Dr. Thouless and Mr. F. C.
Bartlett were also present whilst Prof. Roels prepares the
zinc box and Dr. van Loon examines the sensibility.
The riglit hand and arm are now made insensible by
means of ujiward passes over the left arm. After a few
strokes this is already attained. [Result regular.]
PLATE I.
102] Report of Demonstration .of Experiments on Hypnotism 445
The zinc box is now brought in again and put on the
cardboard box over the right forearm.
After a few upward passes the sensibihty is examined :
pricks are now felt with sensation of pain (shown by
hfting up the hand) on the middle of the forearm. By
a few more series of passes the whole forearm gradually
becomes sensitive again with the exception of a zone on
the back of the hand of about 10-12 cm. breadth above
and below the wrist.
When now the zinc box is opened in the other room,
the cardboard again is not found on the marked area but
totally below it in the lowest end of the box (over the
fingers). See Fig. 2.
The result of both experiments is thus totally negative.
Third Demonstration.
The next day {l\th September), G. W. continues his
demonstration at 11 o'clock a.m. in the same room in
the presence of Mr. F. C. Bartlett, Prof. K. H. Bouman,
Dr. F. H. G. van Loon, Dr. C. S. Myers and Prof. H.
Zwaardemaker, whilst Dr. R. H. Thouless is again in the
adjoining room jjreparing the zinc box and placing the
piece of cardboard.
G. W. is asked to rejaeat once more the same experi-
ments as on the previous day.
At 11 a.m. the subject has been brought into a hypnotic
state by G. W. ; he now wears a pair of blind spectacles
instead of the black cloth.
After two series each of five or six i\pward passes on the
right arm, this one apj)ears to be hypo-sensitive, the left
one hyper-algesic. After a few more passes, the right
arm is anaesthetic. [Result irregular.]
Now G. W. gives a few more passes, with the result
that now the sensibility returns in both arms and after
still more series of passes over the right arm, no difference
in sensibility appears to exist between the two arms.
Now G. W. again places himself immediately in front
of the subject and performs several downward passes
with both arms. He then again makes the upward strokes
446 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part
over the right arm, but after three series (of about six passes)
no distinct result is yet attained.
Then suddenly after a few more passes the right arm
is said to be insensible.
At 11.15 the zinc box is placed above the right arm
and G. W. again performs his- upward passes with the
result that after a few minutes an insensible area is
localised on the back of the hand from the knuckles to
above the wrist.
The position of the anaesthetic patch having been
marked exactly on the upper zinc plate, the box is opened
in the adjoining room. Again the piece of cardboard is
found to be in quite another place, above the marked
spot, with a free space of about 5 cm. between them.
(See Fig. 3.)
At 11.45 one more experiment in the same circumstances
is demonstrated in the presence of Mr. F. C. Bartlett,
Dr. C. S. Myers and Dr. F. H. G. van Loon, Dr. R. H.
Thouless again preparing the zinc box.
After the latter has been put on the insensible right
arm and the upward passes by G. W. have been per-
formed, Dr. van Loon again examines the sensibility.
Fairly soon a distinct analgesic zone (on the back of
the hand again) appears and a less distinct one three
fingers heloiu the elbow. G. W. now examines the sensi-
bility himself. He too finds a second analgesic zone (of
about 10 cm. width) a little below the elbow and under
his examination the outlines of this area become more
precise.
Both zones are marked precisely on the zinc box and
this is again opened. It is found that the box is absol-
utely empty. (See Fig. 4.)
The results of both experiments, of the second day were
therefore also totally negative. The last experiment,
where two insensible zones had been projected on to the
arm, whilst the zinc box did not contain any cardboard
at all, is specially instructive, for it shows the clear
influence either of the subject's expectation, or that of
the experimenter.
PLATE II.
102] Beport of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 447
Last Demonstration.
After these totally negative results, G. W. asked to
perform another demonstration—an experiment in which
by pointing with a glass rod at one of the subject's
fingers (the subject being blindfolded and in the hypnotic
state) he makes the latter stretch the finger pomted at,
thus showing the transmission of the effluence through a
glass rod.
First Experiment. G. W. points at second finger of
right hand. The subject after a few minutes stretches
four times his left thumb, then his right thumb, then the
right second finger and immediately afterwards his left
thumb again.
Second Experiment. G. W. points successively at the
fifth, fourth and middle fingers of the left hand without
any reaction of the subject.
Then while the left middle finger is being j)ointed at
the subject says he feels tickling at his left wrist.
Third Experiment. The glass rod is pointed at several
spots on the left forearm, again without result.
G. W. now again makes upAvard passes on the left arm,
with the result that the right arm becomes hyper-sensitive.
[Result again irregular.]
He then brings the subject into a deeper state of
hypnosis, and again performs the same upward passes
on the left arm, but now the right arm has become
insensitive, the left one hyper-sensitive. [Result now
regular.]
Fourth Experiment. G. W. j)oints at the second left
finger.
After some time several stretching movements of the
right and left thumb are seen and once also of the
second left finger.
When asked by G. W. the subject says he is sleeping
very deeply and badly understands what G. W. intends
to say and communicate to him.
Fifth Experiment. G. W. points at the left fourth
finger. The subject makes several bending and stretching
movements with the left forearm and hand and stretches
several fingers.
448 F. H. G. Van Loon and B. H. Thouless [part
Sixth Experiment. G. W. again points at the left
foiirth finger. Successively the thumb (once), the second
finger (three times), and the middle finger (twice) are
stretched.
G. W. who during the last experiments had already
nearecl the skin very closely, now seemed unconsciously to
touch the subject's skin betAveen the knuckles of the third
and fourth finger. The subject after a moment, points
with his other hand at this spot and rubs it. G. W.
now says that the subject appears to be able to point
at the exact spot but not to stretch the finger. He does
not know why. When asked, G. W. states that he thinks
the pointing experiments have succeeded.
It is not necessary to emphasize the completely negative
character of these results. A study of the records of the
demonstrations shows that even the primary effect of the
23asses (anaesthesia on the same side and hyperaesthesia
on the opposite side for downward passes and vice versa)
showed irregular results about as often as results pre-
dicted by Professor Alrutz's theory. Figs. 1, 2 and 3
sho^v the total lack of any relation between the position
of the cardboard and the anaesthetic patch when the
non-informed method was used.
Mr. Wallenius in his statement (printed below) attributes
these discrepancies to a displacement of the projection
of the cardboard pad as a result of the interval between
the metal plates and tlie subject's arm. There are a
few comments which must be made on this explanation.
First, the displacements are in both directions although
ill all of these experiments, the passes were made in the
same direction. Secondly, the distance between the
metal plates and arm was at least as small as that
shown in the published photographs of Professor Alrutz's
experiments. Thirdly, there is no' more relationship be-
tween the positions of the anaesthetic patch and the pad
than would be the result of pure chance. We believe
that Mr. Wallenius wrote without exact knowledge of
the recorded positions of the anaesthetic patch and the
pad (since, for obvious reasons, the results were not
102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments 011 Hypnotism 449
communicated to him during the course of the experi-
ment). If, with this knowledge, he were still prepared to
explain the discrepancy in this way, this would simply
mean that he was prepared to explain any spatial dis-
crepancy whatever as a satisfactory positive result. This
would rob any assertion of positive results of all evidential
value. We j)refer to think better of Mr. Wallenius's
critical judgment.
The results of the experiments were clearly negative.
The subject had seen the cardboard patch being cut and
was able in hjrpnosis to produce subconsciously an anaes-
thetic patch of that size on his arm, but since there was
no clue to the position of the pad, the position of the
patch had no relationship to it. We have no doubt
whatever of the good faith of both Mr. Wallenius and the
subject, but we are satisfied that all that we saw was
explicable on the ordinary theory of suggestion.
We are aware of the fact that the results of this
demonstration are inadequate to prove conclusively that
Mr. Wallenius has not ever produced phenomena inexpli-
cable on the ordinary theory of the reproduction of
hypnosis. Still less are they adequate to show that the
late Professor Alrutz did not prove the existence of a
" nervous effluence."
We are impressed, however, by the fact that the
results expected were obtained {i.e. anaesthetic patches
the size of the cardboard appeared), but in a manner
which showed that their appearance was due solely to the
expectation of the subject. Moreover, a study of the
accounts of his work published by Professor Alrutz in
English does not satisfy us that sufficient precautions
against this possibihty were taken by him, although he
devised many ingenious arrangements of his experimental
method in order to eliminate it.
It is with reluctance that we venture to criticise the
work of one who is no longer able to reply, but it is
necessary to draw attention to a few points in Professor
Alrutz's own communications which seem to us to make
his conclusions unconvincing. Experiments by the non-
informed method are alone able to prove the existence
450 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part
of this phenomenon, and it is with these only that our
first two points are concerned.
First, when Professor Alrutz describes his experiments
by the non-informed method, he does not state that the
person who placed the pads was kept out of the room while
the examination of sensibility was being made. If he
was not, this appears to be a serious defect in method,
since a person in light hypnosis may easily be guided by
otherwise imperceptible indications from persons present
(if not by true telepathy).
Secondly, the statistical evidence produced by Professor
Alrutz is inadequate for a precise determination of the
probability that successful results by the non-informed
method were due to chance alone. In his article in the
Scandinavian Scientific Review he gives the following figures
for the combination experiment (28 experiments, of which
only 10 were by the non-informed method) : 17 completely
correct, 8 incomplete insensibility or insensibility after
continued excitation, 0 negative (no effect), 2 irregular in
certain respects, 7 rejected experiments. The 7 experiments
rejected (for some defect in the experiment or because of
the intervention of some irrelevant factor) were ones in
which the expected result did not appear. They must,
therefore, be counted as failures in a statistical analysis.
We have left, therefore, 17 successes against 11 not successes.
We do not know how many of these 17 successes were by
the non-informed method. Now the probability that this
number of successes was due to chance depends partly
on how accurately the anaesthetic patch had to coincide
with the pad in order to be counted as a success. There
are not a very large number of positions in which a
j)ad as large as the one Mr. Wallenius required us to use
could be put on the forearm, and unless we have actual
measurements of the position of the j)ad and of the
anaesthetic patch in all experiments by the non-informed
method we cannot be sure how positive these results are.
Such measurements may have been j)ublished in Professor
Alrutz's book, but they are not to be found in either of
his English articles.
Lastly, there is one respect in which Professor Alrutz's
102] Beport of Demonstration of Expe7'iments on Hyjmotism 451
own results strongly point to a suggestion effect. This is
in the phenomenon of " irradiation." It is a recognised
principle for distinguishing between physiologically and
psychically produced anaesthesias that the former follow
in outline the anatomical distribution of the sensory nerves,
while the latter show no dependence on nerve distribution,
but follow the outlines of the external features of the
body. A hysterical or hypnotic anaesthesia, for example,
may include the whole of the hand or of the foot, although
the anaesthetic part is supplied by more than one sensory
trunk nerve and the same sensory trunk nerves supply also
adjacent skin areas which are not anaesthetic.
Professor Alrutz's " irradiation " supplies a typical
example of such independence of structural nervous
groupings. The spreading of anaesthesia from one arm
and the consequent spreading of hyperaesthesia from the
other arm must take place through the central nervous
system. The anaesthesia should, therefore, spread to
those parts of the body supplied with sensory nerves
from the same side of the brain as the anaesthetic arm.
This should be the whole of that side of the body up to
the neck, the opposite side of the head, the opposite
nostril, and the opposite half of both retinae. Alrutz
reports, on the other hand, that the anaesthesia spreads
to the whole of the same side of the body, including the
nostril on that side of the body, and both sides of the
retina on that side of the body, while the retina on the
opposite side shoivs hyperaesthesia all round. While this
distribution of the anaesthesia is anatomically incredible
on Alrutz's theory that it is physiologically caused, it is
exactly the kind of distribution we should expect if the
irradiation were a suggestion effect.
The burden of proof rests with a theory challenging
one which rests on such a firm basis of scientific investi-
gation as does the current theory of hypnosis. It is
our opinion that the theory of " nervous efiluence
"
remains unproved, and that it is probable that the
results attributed in good faith to its action are, in
reaUty, due to the combined action of auto-suggestion
and hetero -suggestion.
452 F. H. G. Van Loon and R. H. Thouless [part
To those who disagree with this opinion, we would
point out that the question is still open to investigation.
If a committee of those dissatisfied with the results of
our necessarily imperfect and incomplete investigation will
go to Upsala, they will no doubt find that Mrs. Alrutz
will show the same courteous willingness to give them
faciUties for a fuller investigation as she extended to us.
If they obtain positive evidence that Mr. Wallenius can
produce phenomena, under strictly and adequately con-
trolled conditions, explicable only on a theory of " nervous
effluence," we are willing to be converted.

For the opinions expressed at the end of the above
report, the signatories are alone responsible. The follow-
ing short summary was, however, read and agreed to by
all of those who were present at any of the demonstrations.
Summary.
At the 8th International Psychological Congress at
Groningen (6-1 1th Sept., 1926), Mr. Wallenius gave a
demonstration of experiments, which were a repetition of
those performed by the late Professor Alrutz. These
experiments were claimed to show that hypnotism is the
effect of a " nervous effluence," and that it is not, as
ordinarily supposed, a psychological function.
At the first sitting (Sept. 10th) were present, as well as
Mr. Wallenius and the subject of the experiment (a
Swedish metal-worker) : Prof. Janet, Prof. MacDougall,
Prof. Roels, Dr. van Loon, Prof. Spearman, Dr. Thouless,
and (for the last part of the demonstration) Mr. Bartlett.
The experiment which was claimed by Prof. Alrutz to be
a crucial proof of his theory was performed under strictly
controlled conditions. The next day, the same experiment
was performed twice more in the presence of Mr. Bartlett,
Prof. K. H. Bouman, Dr. van Loon, Dr. Myers, Dr.
Thouless and Prof. Zwaardemaker.
The methods and [the results obtained will be fully
reported in a longer communication which we hope to
102] Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism 453
publish in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical
Research (London). We can, however, say definitely that
no phenomena occurred in this demonstration which could
require the theory of nervous effluence.
All those before whom the experiments were demon-
strated agreed that the results obtained pointed to the
ordinarily accepted theory of suggestion in hypnosis as an
adequate explanation of all the phenomena observed.
The following statement has been received from Mr.
Wallenius :
Statement Received from Mr. Wallenius.
To the Committee constituted at the Psychologists' Congress
at Groningen for judgment of the results of Dr. Alrutz's
investigations on a hind of nervous effluence or radiation
from the human hody.^
On account of the experiments made in my demonstra-
tion of Alrutz's phenomena of nervous ra.diation, I
consider I ought to make the following notes. My task
was to demonstrate the method and eventually the very
phenomena. According to Prof. Thouless the Committee
wanted to test the permeability of the effect of the
passes through different substances by that kind of
experiments, which afterwards were executed, in which
two zinc plates with a piece of cardboard between them
were placed over the insensitive forearm, and ascending-
passes were made. Disinclined for this kind of experi-
ments I mentioned a better arrangement for this examina-
tion : to apply a plate of cardboard with a cutting out
for one of the fingers of the hand and a zinc plate over
the cardboard. The Committee, however, decided on
the former arrangement, and I agreed to its performance.
The arrangement proved to be unsatisfactory, as there be-
came a displacement between the place of the piece of card-
board and the corresponding insensitive zone of the skin.
Evidently, it depended on that source of faults, which
here had influenced the unequal distance between the
zinc plate and the surface of the skin. The supposition
^ Scandinavian Scientific Review, Vol. III., 1924.
2g
454 Report of Demonstration of Experiments on Hypnotism [PART
for an exact result is that the plates are placed quite
close to the skin. This, however, was not to be done by
the provisional arrangements being at my disposal.
The next day I asked Prof. Thouless to make some
other experiments. The Committee, however, wanted at
first to repeat the same experiment as before ;
yet I got
the jDromise afterwards to show other things myself.
Then I showed the effect of aiming with a glass rod on
the skin. Yet I never got the opportunity for anything
more. The experiment with the fingers of the hand, I
mentioned, is not so dependent on the interspace between
the skin and the plates appHed above, as certainly a
disjolacement can take place here in the direction of the
length, but with difficulty across the hand between the
separated fingers.
With regard to the provisional arrangements it was
therefore an unfortunate choice of experiments that was
made, and it seems to me very peculiar that the Com-
mittee did not pay any attention to other experiments,
either to the physiological—as this—or to the more
psychological.
In a general demonstration and also privately to
Prof. Kiesow and Dr. Gatti I showed other trials, among
them the finger test, and I think that at least Prof. K.
got an impression of the regularity of the phenomena and
their inexplicability only by suggestion.
I may request that this explanation of mine may be
considered, when the Committee is to deliver its report.

" ONE CROWDED HOUR OF GLORIOUS LIFE."
By a. F. Hall.
1. CAN cross-correspondences provide evidence for sur-
vival ?
2. Do cross-correspondences provide evidence for survival ?
3. Does '
One crowded hour of glorious life ' provide
evidence for survival ?
These are the questions which Mr. Piddington's article
raises ^
; and the present situation in psychical research
makes it in our opinion important that they should be
seriously faced. The time has arrived when survival is
accepted (on the evidence provided by jisychic phenomena)
by so many men and women of high scientific standing,
that it is possible for those who take their beliefs on
authority to take this belief on good authority. This is
very satisfactory. However, it none the less behoves us
to scrutinize very closely such evidence as comes before
us ; and I venture to suggest that if in the future psychic
phenomena continue more and more to convince, then so
much the more, and for that very reason, should our
criticism become stringent.
Let us consider our first question :
'
CAN cross-corre-
spondences provide evidence for survival ?
'
An imaginary
case will help us. I think the following might be taken
as a strong case.
On the 5th November, 1927, an English automatist
should write :
Message from your deceased uncle A. B.
176 A 39 X 6
Communicate XY, such and such an address, Peking.
^Proc. S.P.R.—Vo\. XXXVI., pp. 345-375.
456 A. F. Hall [PART
On the 5th November, 1927, a Chmese automatist X.Y.
should write :
Message from A. B. deceased :
176 A 39 X 6 (in Arabic numerals and Roman letters)
Await communication.
Let XY be ignorant of any language except Chinese.
For the sake of simplicity I have taken only two scripts ;
the case would be strengthened of course were they
multiplied. The whole argument would be strengthened
were such cases numerous.
This hypothetical case, if not ideal, I think may justifi-
ably be considered strong. If some would care to call it
grotesque, I would point out that it is not in the least
grotesque (it is very simple), and that it apjjears grotesque
only because, unfortunately, it has never happened. It is
most desirable that this point should be grasped.
There may be more, but there are three obvious possible
explanations of this case.
(ft) Fraud.
{h) An exciting species of telepathy.
(c) Work by an independent and external intelligence
who may or may not be A.B., and who may or may not
be a surviving human intelligence.
We may at once eliminate (ft), for the question of fraud
does not here interest us, and in our hypothetical case no
precautions have been taken to safeguard against it.
Wlien we come to consider the balance of probability as
between (h) and (c), the verdict will be found to vary
according to the disposition and mental content of the
judge ; and we shall be reminded yet once again that
the '
reason '
to which we refer our problems is nothing
more in reality than common sense, and that common
sense in spite of its reassuring name is no longer '
common '
once we pass beyond the very commonest of commonplace
affairs. Quot Jiorimies, tot sententiae.
Before attacking our second and third questions we must
pause to analyse our hypothetical case in order to discover the
conditions which are ideally required to make a cross-corre-
spondence case '
strong ' as evidence of survival. It is
102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 457
unnecessary to emphasize the point that even our strong
case provides, not proof of survival, but persuasive evi-
dence at the most.
1. The tAvo scripts are synchronous. This is required
because a lapse of time between the one and the other
would allow for leakage of information whether trans-
mitted normally or telepathically. Although we do not
understand the working of telepathy, this is a desirable
condition.
2. The two automatists are absolutely unknown one to
another. This condition needs no comment.
3. They are of widely different race and nationality.
It is important that their habits of thought, life and
language should be as different as possible, smce, as most
will agree, the weakest spot in the armour of cross-
correspondence is the danger of common sources of thought
and word association.
4. The message is purely conventional, and is numerical.
We can discard at once the possibility of coincidence on
mathematical grounds, and that of common association of
ideas from the nature of the message.
5. The Chinese autoniatist uses Arabic numerals and
Roman letters. This fortifies the probability that the work
is supernormal and of '
European '
origin ; it also makes
the identity of the messages as close as is possible.
If it is added here that we do not understand the
modus operandi of automatic writings, we may close the
first section of this paper in the hope that nowhere has
controversial matter been introduced.
As regards question No. 2 : Do cross-correspondences
provide evidence for survival ? I have, owing to un-
familiarity with automatic scripts, no remark to make
beyond suggesting that the more cross-correspondences
fulfil the above conditions the greater will be the value of
their evidence for survival ; and conversely—the less,
the less.
We pass now to our third question : Does '
One crowded
hour of glorious life ' provide evidence for survival ?
Without any discussion it may be seen at a glance that
each of the five conditions is harshly violated.
458 A. F. Hall [PART
1. The cross-correspondences occur not on one day but
during a i)eriod of several years.
2. The automatists are not unknown to each other
;
two of them are actually mother and daughter ; the third
is either a friend or an acquaintance—so far as one can
judge from the meagre information given.
3. They are all, presumably, of the same race and
nationality, and for two of them at any rate we must
assume similar habits of thought, life and language.
4. The '
message ' is verbal not numerical. It is not
conventional. It is not identical.
5. There is no evidence in any of the scripts of anything
intrinsically sujoernormal.
Such being the case, either the evidence here given faUs
very far short of what is required : or the conditions imposed
are too stringent. But since the hypothetical case from
which the conditions are deduced provided nothing more
than persuasive evidence, and fell short of anything that
could be called proof, it does not seem wise to mitigate
them.
It is unfortunately necessary to add that in this case
the three automatists were, it appears, in the habit of
sometimes transmitting to each other a knowledge of
portions of their own scripts. One would like to know to
what extent automatism in general, and their own scripts
in particular, were discussed. This information is surely
vital to the discussion.
There must be many hardened sceptics who laid down
this article with a sigh and thought no more about it.
These may be balanced against those who saw in it con-
clusive evidence of survival. The present writer belongs
to an intermediate class. To such a one, wherein lies the
value of this case ? Well, firstly (and by way of digres-
sion) it may be said that cross-correspondence of any sort
may prove the key to the elucidation of the mystery at
present surrounding the problem of automatic writing
itself ; and to use this digression in the immediate business
in hand, it may serve to remind us that the automatism
from which we try to extract messages from the departed
is itself an unexplained process.
102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 459
To resume our context : it has already been pointed out
that our hypothetical case sounded grotesque for no other
reason than that such things do not happen. It is not
grotesque in any other way. How can we explain why
such a thing does not happen ? Such a thing does not
happen either because departed intelligences are as a fact
not trying to communicate with us ; or because they, in
trying to communicate, are, owing to various difficulties,
unable to transmit so clear evidence of their attempts.
There is a third possibility ;
they may not know that
they are communicating. It is not inconceivable that at
this moment, writing on such a topic, I may be trans-
mitting messages, of what nature I know not, to those
I have left behind in a previous mode of existence. Am
I then to be blamed by the sceptics of that world for
my muddled messages ? Or are their recipients to be
blamed for their credulity ? Clearly not.
It is only after making this assumption that there are
difficulties in transmission, that this cross-correspondence
can be accepted as ofiering any evidence at all of survival.
Until methods improve sufficiently to produce results
similar to those in our '
strong ' case, we must put up
with limitations ; but we may not use these limitations to
assist us in argument. It is not fair to argue that very
muddled reception proves difficulties of transmission, and
that difficulties of transmission prove a conscious super-
normal attempt at transmission. It is more modest to
suppose that muddled reception is the result of (perhaps
muddled) transmission of something from some muddled
source, e.g. subconscious ideas.
At this stage it seems worth while to make the sugges-
tion that cross-correspondence cases similar to the
'
Crowded hour ' fall so far short of the standard de-
manded by the conditions deduced from our hypothetical
case, that they should not be considered seriously as
offering evidence for survival. We may make any allow-
ance we like for difficulties of transmission ; but to make
an allowance in our own favour is the very worst method
of establishing a thesis. It is true that cumulatively even
a small number of these cases would prove absolutely their
460 A. F. Hall [PART
validity as against tlie explanation of sheer coincidence
;
but, however many times they v>"ere multiplied their
evidence for survival as against their evidence for common
associations or telepathy would not be one iota increased.
This means that, unassisted by other phenomena, they are
quite valueless as an argument. Were there no other
types of psychic phenomena, would anyone have been
led to a theory of survival by this type ? But cross-
correspondence cannot borrow light, it can only volunteer
its ovnx little beam—in our opinion a very little one.
We "nill now turn to the three scripts themselves and
consider to what extent it is necessary to postulate super-
normal causes (such as telepathy) in their elucidation.
We have tried to show that, although external supernormal
agency may be the explanation, we have no right to
suggest it except in the absence of other explanations.
Our right to postulate telepathy, if necessary, is based on
the fact that telepathy is an admitted j)henomenon—on
rare occasions at any rate, if not in every-day life.
Survival is in a different category.
As regards the scripts M.V. and H.V. it is almost im-
possible to exaggerate the chances of common sources of
association ; and although some attempt has been made
to indicate what some of these common sources may be,
it must be obvious that such an attempt is hopelessly
inadequate ; for when we remind ourselves that these
sources may be recent or remote, may be conscious or
subconscious, and must be so numerous as to be almost
unlimited in number, we shaU realise that M.V. and H.V.,
if they set themselves to enumerate them, could them-
selves suppty but a very smaU fraction of them. If it
be argued that only such of them as are relevant here
need be known, the reply must be made that our feeble
understanding of mental processes in general and of auto-
matism in particular does not allow us to know which
are relevant here. Judging from p. 372, as well as from
his manipulation of associations (pp. 352-369), we find that
Mr. Piddington thinks the sleuthing of mental processes an
easy matter ; but surely this is an operation often beyond
our powers even in the case of our ovm normal conscious
102] One Crowded Hour of Gloriou-s Life 461
cerebrations : how much harder must it not be in the
case of automatic A\Titing by people unknown to us 1 In
other words it does not seem to be true that a critic's
argument, based on the likelihood of common sources of
association, would be invalidated if he could not '
trace
the process step by step '
(p. 372). Indeed we would
suggest that even if no evidence at aU were available of
thoughts common to M.V. and H.V., the fact of their
relationship alone would make highly precarious any
theory as startling as that of survival based on a few
cross-correspondences in their automatic scripts. But as
a matter of fact the verbal cross-correspondences here are
of a nature which we would suggest would not be very
surprising if they were noted in the scripts of two complete
strangers, so long as those two complete strangers both
belonged to the literary (or even merely literate) portion
of the English speaking race, and were both exposed to
a common literary stimulus such as '
Not once or twice,
etc' Such being the case we may now include the W.
script -nith the other two in our discussion. It is most
unfortunate that the reader is quite unable to form any
opinion as to the closeness or other^-ise of W.'s connexion
with M.V. and H.V. We will, therefore, assume that she
is almost a complete stranger to them. Should she, in
fact, be an acquaintance, a friend or a close companion,
anything which appears remarkable in the cross-corre-
spondences A\ill (if they originate in telepathy or common
associations) be the less remarkable in the same order and
degree.
To illustrate the absolute association between the three
key quotations may we allow ourselves to imagine a
conversation somewhat as follows ?
Optimist : Xot once or twice in our rough island-story,
the path of duty was the way to glory.
Pessimist : The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
Optimist : True ; but one crowded hour of glorious life
is worth an age without a name.
It is of no importance, since his meaning is clear, that
the pessimist has distorted the meaning of Gray's line ;
and this distortion and its use in this other context has
462 A. F. Hall [PART
been noted by Mr. Piddington in the scripts. Should the
optimist wisla to illustrate his moral from literary sources,
it appears to me that Socrates, Achilles, Sir John Moore
and Wolfe almost shout their claims to selection. Mr.
Piddington has neglected, I believe, to note that the
author of '
The Burial ' was named Wolfe.
" Not once or twice in our rough island-story
The path of duty was the way to glory."
Tennyson.
One shudders at the very thought that they might have
been omitted, but these lines very rightly are included in
the series since they may have influenced the subsequent
scripts of all three automatists. Indeed, as Mr. Piddington
points out, there seems internal evidence in K of this
influence. They have been mentioned earlier in this
article as a literary stimulus which might very naturally
elicit '
The paths of glory ' and '
One crowded hour.'
With this suspicion in my mind I handed to a friend a
note which to the best of my memory ran as follows :
" Not once or twice in our rough island story
The path of duty was the way to glory."
Will you jot down any lines from poets or any incidents
literary or historical which are suggested by any word, phrase
or idea in above ? Associations may be free or casual, and
need not be reasoned. It is absolutely essential there should be
no collaboration.
This note I asked him also to show to his wife. He
is a man steeped in the classics ; his wife has strong
interests in modern literature. I judged the pair suitable
for experimental purposes in this connexion. I feared at
first I should obtain no result as my friend was reluctant
to waste time, and I refused stubbornly either to explain
the object of this strange request or to give examples of
the sort of material I required. As a result probably of
this reluctance I was unfortunate in extracting no more
than seventeen quotations altogether, while there is no
return at all to my demand for incidents literary and
102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 463
historical. This to me was highly disappointing as I had
hoped for more conclusive results, and could not believe
that the deaths of Socrates, Achilles, Moore and Wolfe
(particularly of the last two from our island-story) could
escape some mention. On the other hand the paucity of
quotations very much enhances the value of what positive
results accrued.
I give the two scripts for the sake of interest and in
particular to show how unexpected some of the associations
may be ;
e.g. Script A. No. 8, when the thistle lifts a
purple crown." I do not offer " to trace the process step
by step " from stimulus to reaction in this case.

(I can give thousands in this vein.)
It will be seen at once how disappointing are the results,
but we have to remember that these two scripts are but
casual jottings of what lay uppermost, that A was the
result of perhaps six hours' mental fermentation, and B of
about as many minutes ; whereas in the article xmcler
review we are apparently considering 220 scripts from
M.V. of which each in length may average perhaps five of our
quotations, and occurring during a period of 46 months ;
and from H.V. 300 scripts during a similar period. In the
case of W.'s script (W. 225), we have no evidence of the
quantity of script jDroduction since the automatist received
her stimulus in the year previous. This is a suitable
occasion for registering our regret that only one W. script
is cited, so that we are unable to form any opinion as to
antecedent tendencies. For instance it would be inter-
esting to know whether W. had any bias towards any
particular word in our stimulus, e.g. '
path,' '
duty,' '
glory.'
As illustration I suggest that our Script B has a natural
bias in favour of the word (and its connotations) '
path.'
Had B had a like bias instead towards the word '
glory,'
we might have obtained " One crowded hour of glorious
life." (I apologise for introducing suggestion into my
argument.) As comment on the single cross-correspondence
in scripts A and B I should like to ask whether Mr.
Piddington (' for a sufficient reward in hard cash '
perhaps)
would undertake to discover in the current stock of
English '
tags '
any line more powerfully suggested by our
two lines from Tennyson than '
The paths of glory lead
but to the grave.'
For the benefit of any readers who may have found
interest in scripts A and B, I will quote from a letter
received from A in reply to one from me enquiring whether
102] One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life 465
my stipulation as regards collaboration had been under-
stood. He writes :
I will strive to give an exact reialy, I handed [my wife]
your piece of paper with the remark, '
Hall has just given me
this, and requires an immediate answer : you will see that no
collaboration is allowed.' [She] thereupon began at once to
flow. I did not look at either her quotations or the paper till
evening, when I wrote do\^'n the few scraps which had collected
in the back of my mind in the meantime.
But perhaps there was little need of experimental
methods to establish an association which from the first
was almost inevitable. If association of ideas plays any
part in automatic wTitings, we must expect '
The paths of
glory '
(so far as we must expect anything) in all three
scripts ; for this is the association to '
The path of duty
'
most likely to strike literate English folk, if you asked
them in their normal condition ;
although w^e are in no
position to infer the associations likely to strike auto-
matists in their abnormal condition.
'
The crowded hour '
however, is not an inevitable asso-
ciation. It has nevertheless a close logical connexion as
appears from the conversation bet\veen the optimist and
pessimist. As it calls up before the present writer a
mental picture of a copy of '
Lyra Heroica '
wdth the four
lines, '
Sound, sound the clarion, etc' in gilt letters on its
red cover, he is prejudiced and in no position to assess the
average chances of its appearing in three scripts during
some fifteen months as reaction to the Tennyson stimulus.
It has to be remembered, however, that if this is the
result of normal association, the common stimulus should
perhaps be considered to be not the Tennyson lines alone,
but those two lines plus their inevitable progeny, '
The
paths of glory.' This stiffening of the stimulus must very
much increase the chances of the reaction, '
One crowded
hour of glorious life,' both logically as a thought associa-
tion and verbally as a '
glory '
association ;
e.g. script F :
'
The paths of glory lead but to the grave—glory—one
crowded hour of glorious life . . .
.' This is the sort of
method we should normally adopt if we attempted to
466 A . F. Hall [PART
indicate the process of association step by step. If this
is a justifiable contention we shall not be surprised to find
that both H.V. (script F) and W. (script K) give these two
quotations in conjunction, while in K the mental presence
of '
The path of duty ' also is, as Mr. Piddington shows,
actually suggested by the wording '
The way to highest
glory leads but to the grave.' As regards M.V., '
The
crowded hour ' (G) follows immediately '
The paths of
glory '
(D) in the scripts as given, although there is a gap
of 40 unpublished scripts between these two, and an interval
of over six months.
Lyra Heroica is a book of verse for boys of which its
compiler, W. E. Henley, writes in his preface that it is
'
to set forth, as only art can, the beauty and the joy of
living, the beauty and the blessedness of death, the glory
of battle and adventure, the nobility of devotion—to a
cause, an ideal, a passion even—the dignity of resistance,
the sacred quality of i:)atriotism.' As text for such a
collection he chooses, and gives on the title page, these
words :
Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife,
To all the sensual world proclaim
One crowded hour of glorious life
Is worth an age without a name.
The same text has been chosen by Mr. Piddington for
his extracts from three automatic scripts, because he argues
that '
due to some one's intelligent design it is meant to
indicate a connexion between the three different contexts
in which it was inserted.' Tlie text is in both instances
apt ; its aptness in the second instance, however, will
support a normal as readily as a supcrnomial explanation ;
for associations are apt to (jo aj)t
—
tho only ones we
notice at any rate ; and the normal explanation rests on
the argument tliat some associations are so af)t as to
be inevitable.
But a far more serious objection to the supernormal
explanation is involved. If some one's intelligent design
can deliberately fjroduco in] - three scripts a quotation
specially chosen for the purpose of indicating something,

difficulties of transmission arise from the limitations

468 A. F. Hall [PART
Note on Lyra Heroica.
In appending a note on Lyra Heroica I wish to make
quite clear the bearing which this reference lias on the
argument. (1) It is a comment on the analytic methods
used by Mr. Piddington : but it is something much more
than that. (2) It may turn out that the book may at
one time or another have been seen by one or more of
the automatists : but even this interesting point is im-
material to the argument. (3) The argument is that there
is a probability that the cross-correspondences are the
result of normal association. We can only test this by
seeing what the normal associations actually are. Scripts
A and B offered us some assistance here. But we are
further assisted by the fortunate fact that there exists
just what we want, a collection of hackneyed English
poems dealing with the theme :
'
One crowded hour of
glorious life is worth an age without a name.' Here we
have an objective standard for comparison. Do the poems
show correspondences similar to those of the scripts ?
This is important ; for the correspondences between the
poems must be precisely what Ave suggest the script corre-
spondences are : that is, normal.
It will have been noticed that our attention has been
confined almost entirely to the verbal cross-correspondences,
and but little reference made to the section (pp. 352-369),
dealing with supposed thought connexions. This is because
that section appears to the present writer to be an
elaboration of what may be termed the normal or '
associa-
tion '
theory—an elaboration far beyond his own powers,
but, nevertheless, confirmatory of the theory he has
supported in explanation of this case. As postscript to
his general argument he proj)oses here to devote a few
words, in this connexion, to the contents of Lyra Heroica.
This collection of verses has been mentioned before. The
few lines quoted from its preface, if not its title alone,
are sufficient to describe its nature. The '
Crowded hour
'
quotation is its text.
" Fight ever fight on ... . Captain my captain. But
the end was not yet " (K).
102] One Croivded Hour of Glorious Life 400
There can have been but few readers to whom these words
did not at once recall Tennyson's '
Revenge.' When we
turn up in Lyra Heroica the Tennyson poems, we find the
'
Revenge '
and the '
Heavy Brigade '
—no others. The
latter gives us " The trumpet, the gallop, the charge and
the might of the fight."
Down with the bridle-hand drew
The foe from the saddle and threw . . .
Up the hill, up the hill, up the hill out of the field
And over the brow and away.
Glory to each and to all, etc.
There is no intention of thoroughly investigating this
book. We confine ourselves to the authors mentioned by
Mr. Piddington, for there must be some limit. But before
passing from Tennyson to Gray and Scott, we may dispose
of '
Lycidas,' '
The Burial of Sir John Moore,' and
'
Alexander's Feast,' all of which are given, and to which
no further reference need be made.
Of Gray we are given only '
The Bard.'
No more I weep. They do not sleep.
Heard ye the din of battle bray
Lance to lance and horse to horse ?
To triumph and to die are mine. (€V\a-os~ Aoyos- of the
Bard.)
But the whole poem shordd be read with care.
Scott : Ten poems.
'
In Memoriam : Nelson, Pitt, Fox,' will supply the
necessary suggestion of the Wellington Ode and a plethora
of phrases and thoughts appropriate to our theme.
In '
Lochinvar,' without abnormal ingenuity, one may
detect the meaning of '

saddle to horse and away ere break of dawn.'

read before an adequate assessment can be made of the
value of the various references to glens, hills, spears, bugles,
banners, trumpets, farewells, saddles, reins, spurs, etc., etc.
Scott's last contribution (' Bonny Dundee ') begins "with
the line,
To the Lords of Convention 'twas Claver'se who spoke,
and proceeds to its close with
He waved his proud hand, and the trumpets were blown,
The kettle-drum clashed, and the horsemen rode on . . .
Come saddle the horses, and call up the men . . .
Whitman : Four poems. The death of Lincoln is not
given, but even if one is unimpressed by the '
Revenge '-
like story of the '
Little Captain ' irr '
A Sea-fight,' one
need only pass on to the next poem which begins
Beat ! beat ! drums—blow ! bugles ! blow !
and note perhaps the lines
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his fields
or gathering his grain,
So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you
bugles blow.
His last poem '
Two Veterans '
is also largely concerned
with drums and bugles, and brings us back to our starting
point. The Wellington Ode, with
I see a sad procession
And I hear the sound of coming full-keyed bugles ;
All the channels of the city streets they're flooding
As with voices and with tears.
But perhaps there is no need for further quotation,
since Lyra Heroica is a little book well known and easy
of access. As regards comment, Qtiot homines, tot sen-
tentiae.
102] A Reply fo Mr. Hall 471
A REPLY TO MR. HALL.
By J. G. PlDDINGTON.
jVIr. Hall says that my paper called " One Crowded Hour
of Glorious Life " raises three questions :
(1) Can cross-correspondences provide evidence for
survival ?
(2) Do cross-correspondences provide evidence for
survival ?
(3) Does " One crowded hour of glorious life " provide
evidence for survival ?
When he writes " these are the questions which Mr.
Piddington's article raises," I understand him to mean
that / raised these questions, or at any rate the third
question ; and as most readers of Mr. Hall's article will,
I feel sure, so understand him, I had better begin by
saying that I neither raised, nor intended to raise, any one
of these three questions.
The conclusion to which consideration of the " One
Crowded Hour " group of scripts led me I expressed thus :
Until detailed explanation on normal lines is forth-
coming, I shall prefer to believe that the coincidences
were either due to some remarkable form of telepathic
interchange between the automatists, or else were the
work of some directing mtelhgence, operating on them
ab extra. And of these two theories I prefer the second.
I used, of course, the neutral phrase " some directing
intelligence, operating . . . ab extra " dehberately, in order
to leave the identity of this intelKgence an open question.
If, then, Mr. Hall means that / put forward the " One
Crowded Hour " case as evidence for survival, I need
472 J. G. Piddingfon [PART
only repeat that I did not ; and if he means that others
are hkely to find in it evidence for survival, I can only
say that tliat is not niy concern.^
I welcome Mr. Hall's experiment of giving the game
literary stimulus to two friends and getting them to
write down independently their associations therewith,
because, with the conditions somewhat altered, a series
of experiments of this kind might afford guidance to us
when we try to estimate what sort of coincidences between
the scripts of various automatists may reasonably be
attributed to common associations of ideas, and what not.
That the particular experiment proved " highly dis-
appointing " from Mr. Hall's point of view will not, I
hope, deter him from making further experiments ; for
if it can be shown that coincidences as complex and
elaborate as those which characterize cross-correspondences
can be produced by people with no pretensions to super-
normal faculty, then the sooner that is established the
better. Only I would suggest that the conditions of
such experiments should be made to correspond more
nearly to ,
those under which the automatists work, as
otherwise the results will not be instructive. On Mr.
Hall's plan of providing a common starting-point, coin-
cidences are bound to occur. I am not finding fault
with Mr. Hall for having adopted this plan, because
his object was to see what kind of coincidences would
be elicited by a particular theme. But I want to point
out that coincidences between scripts of the type under
discussion are not the result of the automatists' having
been given a common starting-point. They may occur
becaiise the automatists have independently chosen a
common theme. In the " One Crowded Hour " case,
for instance, Mrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett may have both
started from a common point : namely, " not once or
twice in our rough island-story," which both knew had
appeared in a script of Mrs. Verrall's. But if they did
both start from this same theme—and that is pure
1 If Mr. Hall, or any one else, cares to learn my view of the bearing
of cross-correspondences on the evidence for survival, he will find it
expressed in the Journal for December 1910 (Vol. XIV., pp. 400-402).
102] A Reply to Mr. Hall 473
hypothesis—they did not do so because it was, so to
speak, imposed upon them,—at any rate in any normal
manner. If each selected it, why did they select that
particular theme for development out of many scores of
other themes equally open to them ? Moreover, why
did both develop the theme, which they had thus inde-
pendently and by some happy chance mutually fixed
upon, in the same way, though it was one that lent
itself to variation in many directions ? For both Mrs.
Salter's and Mrs. Willett's treatment of the (assumed)
common theme runs on much the same lines, both laying
stress on two ideas, death in battle and death in the
moment of victory or achievement, which are not in-
evitably, nor, I think, obviously, suggested by it. In its
original context
" Not once or twice in our rough island-story
The path of duty was the way to glory
"
has nothing to do with death in battle or death in the
moment of victory. The lines form part of a eulogy
of the Duke of Wellington, who came through many
battles unscathed, lived to a ripe old age, and died in
his bed—or, to be precise, in his armchair.
If, too, "not once or twice," etc., was the common
starting-point selected independently by Mrs. Willett and
Mrs. Salter, it is strange that Mrs. Willett gets only a
confused allusion to it, and Mrs. Salter none at all.
Besides the coincidence of Mrs. Salter's and Mrs. Willett's
independent choice of the same theme, there is the
further coincidence of Mrs. Verrall's having developed
this same theme on the same lines as the other two ;
for she connected with it " the paths of glory lead but
to the grave," which I suggested—and Mr. Hall, I under-
stand, does not dissent from the suggestion—represents,
through its association with Wolfe, death in battle and
death in the moment of victory. The triple coincidence
is further enhanced by the well-timed appearance, for
the first and only occasion in Mrs. Verrall's scripts, of
" One crowded hoiu' of glorious life," just sixteen days
after its first appearance in Mrs. Salter's script.
Mr. Hall calls attention to the likelihood of common
474 J. O. Piddington [PART
associations specially affecting the scripts of Mrs. Verrall
and Mrs. Salter by reason of their close relationship. I
should certainly have expected the scripts of a mother
and daughter, particularly when, as in the case in point,
they had received the same kmd of education, to exhibit
more numerous and more marked instances of common
associations than the scripts of two friends, or two
acquaintances, or two strangers.^ That Mrs. Verrall and
Mrs. Salter possessed more associations in common than
either had in common with any of the other automatists
of our group is certain ; but I have no hesitation in
saying after many years' close study of their scripts
that this common fund of associations has been drawn
upon in their scripts to a surprisingly small extent.
Not merely are the tone, the style, the literary character
and emotional colouring of their respective scripts notably
i;nlike, but also their processes of thought and associations
of ideas. If both independently make the same literary
or artistic or historical allusions, such coincidences between
them are not more frequent than they are between cither's
scripts on the one side and the scripts of the other
automatists on the other side.
Mr. Hall comjslains of being " quite unable to form
any opinion as to the closeness or otherwise " of Mrs.
Willett's connexion with Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Salter.
He must either have forgotten, or else be unaware, that
information on this point has already been given in
Proceedings : information that a student may reasonably
be expected to look up for himself, and not to have
repeated every time that the concordant phenomena of
" these automatists come up for discussion.
Yet at the same time Mr. Hall would not, I gather,
attach much importance to such information when pro-
vided, on the ground that, however detailed, only a
very small fraction of all the possible common sources
of association derived from the intercourse of relations,
friends, or acquaintances, could, even with the best will
in the world, be set down in black and white. And there
I entirely agree with him.
1 kScc in this connexion, Pioc, Vol. XXTX., p. 11.
102] A Reply to Mr. Hall 475
As regards " Lyra Heroica," Mrs. Salter tells me that
she is not acquainted with it, and she believes that her
mother did not possess a copy of it. I have not troubled
to find out whether or not Mrs. Willett knows the book,
for the point seems to me immaterial, when we are
considering the phenomena of automatists so widely read
in English literature as Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Salter, and
Mrs. Willett. There are other anthologies, e.g. The Ojford
Book of English Verse and The Golden Treasury, with
which all three automatists were familiar and from which
they could have got some of their quotations. I find
it easier, however, to suppose that it was not this or
that Anthology, but their general reading that supplied
them with the necessary material. None of the three would
have found any difficulty in illustrating with apposite
literary allusions derived from their general reading any
of the themes that run through the " One crowded
hour " group of scripts, or plenty of other themes. But
the wider their acquaintance with English literature, the
narrower the chance of their hitting on the same illu-
strations.
Although, legitimately for his particular purpose, Mr.
Hall reviews the " One Crowded Hour " case as an
isolated phenomenon, if a proper estimate is to be found
of its worth or worthlessness as evidence for some form
of supernormal activity, it must be considered as one of
a series—a long series—of similar cases. If, when Mr.
Hall speaks of his " imfamiliarity with automatic scripts,"
he means that he is not familiar with the numerous
papers dealing with cross-correspondences that have
appeared in Proceedings, it might interest, and perhaps
perplex him to read some of them ; for among
them he will find instances where the coincidences cannot
have started, as hypothetically those involved in the
" One Crowded Hour " case may have started, from a
common stimulus normally experienced by the contributing
automatists. But if this is asking too much, he would
perhaps undertake a lesser labour and do me the honour
of reading the following pages, in which I give an account
of a cross-correspondence (not presented as evidence for
476 J. G. PidcUngton—A Reply to Mr. Hall [PART
survival) in which the two automatists concerned are
not a mother and daughter, but just slight acquaintances,
and which is not complicated by either automatist having
seen something in the other's script in the least likely
to have given rise to the coincidences involved.
102] The Master Builder 477
THE MASTER BUILDER.
By J. G. PlDDINGTON.
The cross-correspondence with which this paper deals
lies ensconced in a single script of Mrs. King's and three
scripts of Mrs. Salter's.^ It may be described as belonging
to the " literary " type of cross-correspondence, as it
brings out a curious—and, so far as I know, an original
—parallel between a passage in Milton and certain passages
in a play of Ibsen's.
Below will be found copies of a group of ten scripts,
or extracts from scripts, marked A to J. The cross-
correspondence is contained in the four scripts marked
C, D, E and F. On either side of these four, and separated
from them by two thick lines, are six scripts, A, B, G,
H, I and J, which have been included for various reasons
to be explained later.

. . . The cornerstone of the building is set ... I see a
kind of trophy with a stick and a wreath twisting round
it. It stands for some kmc! of triumph, held aloft above

In confining the cross-correspondence to the four central
scripts, I have been actuated by a desire to forestall
the objections of those who demand that no long interval
of time should separate scripts of different automatists
which are supposed to show supernormal concordances
with each other. The first of the four central scripts,
script C, though written some four years earfier than the
other three, is an obvious prelude to the second and
fourth. The remainder, scrijits D, E, and F, were all
written within a period of twenty-eight days ; and it is
in these three scripts that the heart of the matter lies.
At the same time, although I do attach importance
to the nearness in date of D, E, and F, my own view is
that it is only artificially that the cross-correspondence
can thus be limited to the four central scripts ; and that,
in spite of the interval of over ten years between scripts
A and J, it really spreads over all ten scripts. The coinci-
dences seem to me of too distinctive a character to be
discounted on the ground that in so protracted a period
of time they might occur by chance.
The two automatists concerned, Mrs. Salter and Mrs.
King, are only slightly acquainted, having met but two
or three times, and then only for a few minutes. It will,
perhaps, be a relief to the reader to learn besides that
until December 1926—that is, nearly two years after
the date of script J—Mrs. King knew nothing whatsoever
about any script of Mrs. Salter's quoted or referred
to in the present paper ; and that until January or
February 1927 Mrs. Salter knew nothing whatever about
any script of Mrs. King's that I am going to quote.
Moreover, no script of either automatist mentioned in this
paper has hitherto appeared in the Proceedings or Journal,
or elsewhere.
Before dealing with the four central scripts, I would
480 ./. G. Piddmgton [PART
ask the reader to note the relation of A and B to C, D,
and F, which may be thus tabulated :
Tlie uttermost ends The topmost pinnacle The comerst
The uttermost ends Finistcrre
Finisterrc Tiie topmost phuiacle The master builder
The master builder
The master builder The cornersi
.Script A contains the first occurrence in all Mrs. Salter's
scripts of the uttermost ends," of "the topmost pinnacle,"
and of " the cornerstone " ; while B has the first mention
of " Finisterre " and its equivalent "Finis terrae " (the
end of the earth). As all these phrases re-appear in
the three scripts that furnish Mrs. Salter's contribution
to the cross-correspondence, it will be as well to discuss
them at this point.
The uttermost enrls. In B .
" the uttermost ends of the
earth shall not encompass it " is immediately preceded
by " Finisterre " and " Finis terrae," and immediately
followed by a quotation from Tennyson's Ulysses, which,
together with its context, runs thus :
for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down :
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew."
" Finis terrae " must reflect the idea of Ulysses voyaging
to and beyond the limits of the world ; and taken in
connexion with " the uttermost ends of the earth shall
not encompass it may point to the lines in Tennyson's
poem in which Ulysses speaks of his unsatisfied craving
for ever fresh adventure, and of his desire
" To follow knowledge like a sinking star.
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought."
In Script C " Finisterre " is followed by " Over the
edge," a phrase that re-appears in the following form
and context in H.V. 551 :
" Over the edge of the world— to the end."
102] The Master Builder 481
Here " to the end " is a reference back to H.V. 432 :
''
To endure to the end—the uttermost—to the
world's end."
These associated phrases
—" Finisterre," " Finis terrae,"
''the uttermost ends," "Over the edge," "Over the
edge of the world," "To the world's end," "To endure
to the end," " The uttermost "—all belong to the
Ulysses topic, and represent the life-long pursuit of the
unattainable. Although the Ulysses topic is beyond doubt
woven into the group of Mrs. Salter's scripts under dis-
cussion, it does not enter into the cross-corresi^ondence,
and so, for the present, the reader may dismiss it from
his mind, after first taking note that I regard " Over
the edge " as common to, and linking together, the topic
of Ulysses with that of the Master Builder. ^
The topmost pinnacle. This phrase appears first in A,
and then again—for the only time—in C, where it is
immediately followed by "the kingdoms of the earth."
The juxtaposition clearly indicates that the reference is
to two of Christ's temptations : the devil's offer of " all
the kingdoms of the world," and the deviFs suggestion
that Christ should j)rove His divinity by casting Himself
down from a pinnacle of the Temple.
The cornerstone. In the form " the cornerstone of the
builders " this first appears in A in immediate connexion

be attached in the scripts to the stone which the builders
rejected I do not know ; but it can hardly be disputed
that it has obvious associations with Christ and with
the Temple at Jerusalem.
I pass on now to Scripts C, D, and F, in which is to
be found Mrs. Salter's side of the cross-correspondence.
All three scriiDts alike have the words " the master
builder." Even if the automatist herself had not
happened to refer them, as in fact she did, to Ibsen's
play Master Builder Solness (known in England as The
Master Builder), the context in C and F—viz. " Something
about a church—a high pointed spire . . . Over the edge
. . . down down down '"
and " the church tower "—would
have sufficed to fix the reference.
In order to make intelligible the references in the
scripts to Ibsen's Master Builder, I append a summary
of some of the events antecedent to the action and of
parts of the plot, ignoring, however, as irrelevant to the
immediate purpose, large tracts of the play.
Summary of Parts of Ibsen's " Master Builder."
Ten years before the play opens, Master Builder Solness
had been engaged on building a high tower on an old church
at LySanger. When the tower was finished, there were
" grand doings in the town," and crowds came to watch
Sohiess, in accordance with ancient custom, climb up the
scaffolding to the very top of the tower, and hang a wreath
on the weather-vane. Among the crowd was a party of
school-girls, di'essed in their best and carrying flags, which
they waved as Solness stood at the top. One of these school-
girls, Hilda Wangel by name, then between twelve and thirteen
years of age, was especially enthusiastic, and yeUed out
" Hurrah for Master Builder Solness !
" The ceremony over,
Solness, after first attending a dinner in his honour at the
local club, went to supper at the house of the district doctor,
Hilda Wangel's father. On entering the house, he found
Hilda alone in the room, and feeling, as he puts it in the
play, " so buoyant and free that day," told the girl she was
looking lovely, promised to come back in ten years' time to
102] The Master Builder 483
make her his princess and carry her off to a fairy kingdom ;
and wound up the tete-a-tefe by putting his arms round her
and kissing her agam and again.
In spite of his profession, it was no ordinary thuig for
Sohiess to chmb to the top of a high tower as he did at
Lysanger, for it made him giddy to stand even on a second-
storey balcony. Once and once only, and that was at
Lysanger, had he been able to nerve himself " to do the
impossible " and chmb to a great height ; and it was this
soHtary exploit that had excited the enthusiasm of Hilda,
though she had no suspicion of what it had cost him.
When the play begms, exactly ten years to a day have
passed since the ceremony at Lysanger. Solness meanwhile
has forgotten all about HUda. She, however, has not forgotten
him ;
and, as he has not come back at the end of ten years
to make her his princess, she leaves her home at Lysanger,
and comes to Solness's house to claim the fulfilment of his
promises. She finds him on the point of completing the
building of a new home for himself. A featiu:e of Solness's
new house is a very high tower. There is to be the usual
ceremony on completion of the building ; and HUda, after
taunting Sohiess for not daring to climb as high as he builds,
eventually goads him into j^romising to perform the ceremony
himself : which meant climbing to the top and hanging the
wreath " on the very pimiacle of the tower." The result is
fatal to Solness, who, after reaching " the topmost planks
"
of the scaffolding and hanging the wreath round the vane,
turns dizzy, falls, and is kUled on the spot.
It is to the Master Builder's ascent of the Church
Tower at Lysanger, and to his fall from the tower of
his own new house, that reference is made in Scripts C
and F by means of the following phrases :
Something about a church—a high pointed spire . . .
Over the edge . . . down down down—the master builder
. . . the chmch tower ;
and to these phrases should, I think, be added " the
topmost pinnacle " in C ;
for, though primarily the words
refer to the pinnacle of the Temple at Jerusalem, they
may well include a reference to " the very pinnacle of
484 J. G. Piddington [PART
the tower " on which Sohiess, having climbed to " the
topmost planks " of the scaffolding, hangs the wreath.
In connexion with the use of the phrase " the topmost
pinnacle " reference to Christ's Temptation, it should
be noted that neither in St. Matthew's nor in St. Luke's
Gospel (our only authorities for the story) is the to-pmost
pinnacle spoken of : both Evangelists saying simply
that the devil set Christ "on a pinnacle of the temple."
Is there, then, any point in the script's variation ? I
have already suggested that " the topmost pinnacle
"
may allude to " the topmost j^lanks " and " the very *
pinnacle of the tower " in Ibsen's play ; but the phrase
in the script involves another literary allusion, and one
which—when all the evidence has been presented, though
not till then—will appear not conjectural, but certain.
Milton, who follows the order of St. Luke's narrative,
brings Paradise Regained to a conclusion with the tempta-
tion on a pinnacle of the Temple. His account of it
begins thus :
So saying, he [Satan] caught him up, and, without wing
Of hippogrif, bore through the air sitblime,
Over the wilderness and o'er the plain ;
Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,
The holy city, lifted high her towers,
And higher yet the glorious temple rear'd
'
Her pile, far off appearing like a mount
Of alabaster, topt with golden spires :
There on the highest 'pinnacle, he set
The Son of God.
Though the meaning of " the topmost pinnacle " and
of " the highest pinnacle " is exactly the same, the verbal
coincidence is not exact ; and it might be urged that,
though " the bottomless abyss " in C is suggestive of
Milton's phraseology, the coincidence is too slight to
warrant the script's " the topmost pinnacle " being attri-
buted to a reminiscence of this passage in Paradise
Regained. I should not quarrel with that objection ;
but I will ask the reader to suspend judgement on the
point till later, and meanwhile to turn to Scripts D and E,
102] The Mnsfer Builder 485
D contains tiae first and only mention by name of
Oedipus in all Mrs. Salter's scripts, while E contains the
first mention of Oedipus in all Mrs. King's scripts.
Sixteen days separate the two " Oedipus " scripts, which
were written on Dec. 5 and Dec. 21, 1918, respectively.^
I have no explanation to offer of the phrases in D
that follow " the master builder," viz. :
the doorway of the mind—open or shut—before the
threshold—the watcher at the gate.
In Oedipus Tyrannus 391 the Sphinx is called '/ /'u\|/w^09
lamv (literally, the song-recitiiag dog) ; and Jebb renders
these words by " the Watcher who wove dark song,"
explaining in a footnote that the Sphinx is called Kvm'
as being " the watchful agent of Hera's wrath." But,
so far as I know, no version of the story represents
the Sphinx as keeping watch before the gate, or gates,
of Thebes ; and my instinct is to see no allusion to
the Sphinx in " the watcher at the gate." Nor do I
believe that " the doorway of the mind—open or shut
"
has anything to do with " the younger generation
"
knocking at Solness's shut door, or to Hilda's urging
him to open it.
1 In November, 1918, there had been published in the Proceedings
a paper of mine called Fresh Light on the '
One-Horse Dawn '
Exixri-
ment, in which a good deal is said about the death of Oedipus at
Colonus. Mrs. Salter, in her capacity of Editor of Proceedings, had
read this paper in MS. or proof at least as early as February or March,
1918. If Mrs. King read it on its publication in November, 1918,
then possibly the emergence of the references to Oedipus in D and E
may have been facilitated by both automatists' having read the paper.
It contains two passing and absolutely imimportant allusions to the
guessing of the riddle of the Sphinx by Oedipus : one being the motto
prefixed to the paper, Kairoi to 7' aLviy/x ovx'l tovttl'ji/to's fiv |
dvSpos Otei-rray
(which Mrs. King would not have understood, as she does not
know Greek) ; the other being a quotation from Mr. Bayfield's Memoir
of A. W. Verrall in which he speaks of Dr. Verrall's " more than
Oedipodean acuteness as a solver of riddles." Beyond these two
incidental allusions, there was nothing in the paper to draw attention
to this incident in Oedipus' early life, its interest, on the contrary,
centring roimd his death in old age.
2l
486 J. G. Pidclington [PART
In Mrs. King's script of Dec. 21, 1918—Script E i—
occurs the phrase
" Verify reference to OEdipus in Ovid,"
followed by an instruction to send this part of the script
to Mr. Gerald Balfour (" Send Gerald "). Unlike the
rest of the script, which was written automatically, the
words " Verify reference to CEdipus in Ovid " were
written down by Mrs. King in her normal handwriting.
They came to her in a different way from that in
which the rest came : she " heard " them spoken.
Hence the difference in the method of recording them.
Mrs. King appended contemjjoraneously to the script
a note to the effect that she reproduced in her copy of
it one or two of the illegible scribbles, " as the whole
reference is unknown to me." She told me in February
1927 that by " the whole reference " she meant the
" reference to Oedipus in Ovid " ; and she added spon-
taneously that she had thought the injunction to " verify
reference to CEdipus in Ovid " queer and probably rubbish.
To tell the truth—though I was struck by the definiteness
of the injunction, which is not at all in the usual style
of Mrs. King's script—I shared her opinion, because I
assumed that there would be a dozen or more references
to Oedipus in Ovid's voluminous works, and that
accordingly it was absurd to talk of verifying " reference
to Oedipus in Ovid." I supposed it to be the kind of
thing that an automatist knowing little or nothing of
Greek and Roman literature might subliminally concoct
in an attempt to produce a " classical " allusion.
My surmises were mistaken. So far as I have been
able to ascertain after careful enquiry, in all Ovid's
works—which in Merkel's edition, for instance, occupy
just over 900 pages of close print—there are only three
1 The whole script is reproduced on p. 484 above with the exception
of twelve words, the omissions being indicated by dots. Six of these
words ai-6 a reassuring statement about the health of Mrs. King's son,
then in Gei-many ; three are words of farewell ; and the remaining
three are "feel writing better." There is no connexion—and evidently
none was intended—between these twelve words and the remainder of
the script.
102] TTie Master Builder 487
allusions of any kind to Oedipus, and of these tliree only
one is a reference to Oedipus as an individual. In
Met. XV. 429 (regarded, by the way, as spurious by
some editors), Thebes is called Oedipodean, " Oedipodoniae
Thebae "—a decorative epithet comparable to Constan-
tinian York, or Godiva's Coventry, or King Alfred's
city of Winchester. In I. Tristia 1. 114 Ovid calls
certain of his poetical works " Oedipuses," because they
brought misfortune and ruin upon the author of their
being as Oedipus broiight destruction upon his own
father. Neither of these instances can be properly
called a " reference to Oedipus." The only personal
reference to Oedipus that I can trace in Ovid is the
following one in Met. VII. 759-761 :
Carmina Laiades non intellecta priorum
Solverat ingeniis, et praecipitata iacebat
Immemor ambagum vates obscura suarum.
(" The son of Laius had solved the riddle which had
been inscrutable to the understanding of all before ;
faUen headlong she lay, the dark prophet, forgetful of
her own riddle."—F. J. Miller's translation.)
Not another word is said in the context about Laiades
—i.e. Oedipus, the son of Laius ; the reference to his
guessing the riddle of the Sphinx and to the Sphinx's
self-destruction serving merely to mark the approximate
date of a particular incident (the pursuit of another
monster that was terrorizing Thebes) in a very long
and dull story about a dull person called Cephalus.
It is as if an English writer were to indicate the date
of an event by sayuig that it took place some time after
King Alfred had burnt the cakes.
Although, like Lord BoHngbroke, " I approve the
devotion of a studious man at Christ Church, who was
overheard in his oratory entering into a detail with
God, and acknowledging the divine goodness in furnishing
the world with makers of dictionaries," I know the
fallibility of compilers too well to place complete faith
in any index or concordance. Hence I shall not be so
incautious as to assert positively that this is the one
488 J. G. PifJdivgion [PART
and only personal reference to Oeclipiis in Ovid ; but
it is the only one given in the very elaborate index
api^ended to the Delphin edition of all Ovid's works ; and
I have found no other in other indexes or concordances,
or in the dictionaries, either under the headings Oedi-
pixs," " Labdaeus," and " Laius," or other likely headings.
What I am prepared to assert is that if there are other
references, they must be exceedingly rare.
If, then, the " reference to Oedipus in Ovid " of Script E
is the one in Met. VII. 759-761, it corresponds with "a
king's son—known of old—Oedipus—the riddle " in
Script D of sixteen days earlier. The coincidence between
the two scripts, moreover, is of a rather subtle kind ;
for Mrs. Salter's script, before giving the name " Oedipus,"
first alludes to him as "a king's son—known of old " :
a form of allusion that corresponds neatly with Ovid's
way of designating Oedipus as " Laiades," i.e. the son
of Laius (king of Thebes).
While, however, Mrs. Salter's script refers only to the
guessing of the Sphinx's riddle by Oedipus, Mrs. King's
script goes a step further, for the " reference to Oedipus
in Ovid " involves a reference also to the Sphinx's head-
long fall.
As already mentioned, I was not inclined to take the
injunction in Script E to " verify reference to OEdipus
in Ovid " seriously. It had such an apocryphal smack
about it that when, as often happened, I came across
it in looking through Mrs. King's scripts, it was apt to
make me smile. What eventually led me to pay serious
attention to it was this : In December, 1926, I was
considering the three alKisions in Mrs. Salter's scripts
to the master builder " and their contexts. After
reading Ibsen's play it was obvious to me that there
was a sort of parallel between the devil setting Christ
on a pinnacle of the Temple and Hilda half goading,
half coaxing Solness to climb to the top of the tower ;
but I was puzzled by the want of a parallel with the
Master Builder's fall from the tower, and also by the
repetition of the unbiblical phrase " the topmost pinnacle."
It occurred to me to look up Milton's account of the
102] The Master Builder 489
Temptation in Paradise Regained. This at once gave
a satisfactory explanation of " the topmost pinnacle,"
since, as we have seen, Milton makes Satan place Christ
on "the highest pimiacle."' Then, as I read on, I foimd
that IVIilton furnishes a parallel to the Master Builder's
fall, for, departing from the Biblical story, he makes
Satan, when Christ has refused to cast himself down, fall
himself :
There, on the highest pinnacle, he set
The Son of God ; and added thus in scorn :
There stand, if thou wilt stand ; to stand upright
Will ask thee skill : I to thy Father's house
Have brought thee, and highest placed : highest is best :
Now show thy progeny ; if not to stand.
Cast thyself down ;
safely, if Son of God :
For it is written,—He will give command
Concernmg thee to his angels : in their hands
They shall iiplift thee, lest at any time
Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.
To whom thus Jesus : Also it is written,
Tempt not the Lord thy God. He said, and stood :
But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.
Fortunately, I read on a little further still, and so
found the explanation of the reference in Mrs. Salter's
Script D to Oedipus and the Sphinx's riddle, which there
follows " the master builder." Immediately after the
line
But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell,
Milton compares Satan's fall to the many falls which
Heracles inflicted on the giant Antaeus before he finally
overcame him ; and he then goes on to compare Satan's
to another legendary fall :
So, after many a foil, the tempter proud,
Renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride.
Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall :
And as that Theban monster, that proposed
Her riddle, and him who solved it not devour'd ;
490 J. G. Piddington [PART
That once found out and solved, for grief and spite
Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep :
So struck with dread and anguish, fell the fiend.
Although the reference in Script D is merely to the
guessing of the riddle and not to its effect upon the
Sphinx, I felt certain that behind Scripts C and D (both
" master builder " scripts) lay this passage in Paradise
Regained.
Some time later it occurred to me that Mrs. King's
" verify reference to Qildipus in Ovid " might be con-
nected with Mrs. Salter's " Oedipus—the riddle." After
noticing how near in date these two " Oedipus " references
are, and having ascertained that neither automatist had
ever mentioned Oedipus by name previously, I thought
I would look up a passage in the Purgatorio where, as
I vaguely remembered, Dante, misled by a corruption in
the text of Ovid, speaks of the Naiades (instead of
Laiades, i.e. Oedipus) as expounders of riddles. Dante
says nothing about the Sphinx casting herseK from her
rock ;
but, as I found on looking it up, the original
passage in Ovid to which Dante is referring (it is the one
quoted on p. 487 above), contributes the precise point
—
namely, the fall of the Sphinx—wliich was wanted to
clinch the allusion to the lines in Paradise Regained. So
far, so good ;
yet it did not seem likely a priori that
there would be any justification for fixing on this par-
ticular passage in Ovid as the one meant by Mrs. King's
script. StUl I thought I ought to see what the references
to Oedipus in Ovid were, and accordingly looked them
up ; and so found to my considerable surprise that there
appears to be but one personal reference to Oedipus, and
that one of a character to produce what seems to me to
be a remarkably well-designed cross-correspondence be-
tween Mrs. King's single script and Mrs. Salter's three
scripts.
1 " And perchance my [Beatrice's] prophecy, obscure as Themis and
Sphinx, dotli less persuade thee, because after their fashion it darkens
thy mind ; but soon the facts shall be the Naiades that will solve this
hard riddle" [Purgatorio XXXIII. 46-50).
102] The Master Builder 491
So far as I am aware, Mrs. Salter's scripts contain no
other at any rate certaia references to Ibsen's Master
Builder than those already mentioned, unless
Standing alone the highest pinnacle
in Script H be so accounted. These words may perhaps
be applied to the Master Builder standing alone on the
top of his tower ; but more probably they refer to Christ,
as conceived by Milton, standing alone on the highest
pinnacle of the Temple. " Standing alone " sviits well
Milton's " There stand, if thou wilt stand ; to stand
upright will ask thee skiU ... if not to stand. Cast
thyself down . . . He said, and stood ; and furthermore
here for the first time, in place of the previous " the
topmost pinnacle," appear the actual words used by
jVIilton, " the highest pinnacle."
The only other automatist besides Mrs. Salter whose
script contains references to Ibsen's Master Builder is
Mrs. King ; and her references, so far as I know, are
all subsequent to Mrs. Salter's (unless script H be taken
to refer to Ibsen's play). Not that this in the least de-
prives them of their mterest, for Mrs. King knew nothing
whatsoever about Mrs. Salter's references to The Master
Builder. Though Mrs. King's references do not fall within
the artificially prescribed time-limits of the cross-corre-
spondence, they are of too great interest, when compared
with Mrs. Salter's, to be passed over in silence. To
the best of my loiowledge, there are altogether four of
them, and three out of the four are effected by means
of the same quotation from Ibsen's play. I propose
to deal with the first three only, which will be found
in Scripts G, I, and J. Common to G and I are the
words, " The harps in the air." " Harps in the air " is a
quotation from The Master Builder ; and if some one had
wanted to pick ovit a single phrase from Ibsen's play
which would bring together the two events ui the life of
492 J. G. Piddiiujion [PART
iSolness to wliicli Mrs. Salter's scripts had been re-
ferring—I mean tliereby his ascent of the Church Tower at
Lysanger, and liis fatal ascent of the tower of his own
house—no better selection than " harps in the air " could
have been made.
When Hilda Wangel visits Solness she reminds him of
all the details of the ceremony at Lysanger when she
as a school-girl had watched him climb to the top of the
Church Tower and hang a wreath on the vane. Here
is part of the dialogue between her and Solness :
Hilda.
Oh, it was so gloriously thrilling ! I could not have believed
there was such a builder in the whole world that could build
such a tremendously high tower. And then, that you yourself
should stand at the very top of it, as large as life ! And
that you should not be the least bit dizzy ! It was that
above everything that made one—made one dizzy to think of.
Solness.
How could you be so certain that I was not ?
Hdlda.
[Scouting the idea.] No indeed ! Oh no ! I knew that
instinctively. For if you had been, you could never have
stood up there and sung.
Solness.
[Looks at her in astonishment.] Sung ? Did / sing ?
Hilda.
Yes, I should think you did.
Solness.
[Shakes his head.] I have never sung a note in my life.
Hilda.
Yes indeed, you sang then. It sounded like harps in the
air.
102] The Master Builder 493
Once again, and once only, are " harps in tlie air
"
mentioned. Solness has fallen from the tower of his
house, and is lying dead at the foot of it :
A Voice.
{^Below, in the garden.] Mr. Solness is dead !
Other Voices.
[Nearer.] The head is all crushed.—He fell right into the
quarry.
Hilda.
[Turns to Ragnah, and says quietly.] I can't see him up
there now.
Eagnar.
This is terrible. So, after all, he could not do it.
Hilda.
[As if in quiet spell-bound triumph.] But he mounted right
to the top. And I heard harps in the air. [Waves her shawl
in the air, ami shrieks with wild intensity.] My—my Master
Builder !
With these words the play ends.
' Harps in the air " appears first in Script G, and it
is there immediately preceded by
'
' The epithalamium
—
greeting." Observe accordingly the context of the first
occurrence of " the master-builder " in Mrs. Salter's
Script C :
Over the edge—the bottomless abyss—depths unijlumbed
—down down down—the master-builder—the topmost
pinnacle—the kingdoms of the earth—The flaming torch
—Hymen hymenace.
As the context shows, " the flaming torch " is the
nuptial torch, " Hymen hymenaee " being the cry with
which Hymen, the god of marriage and weddings, was
invoked. The reference is pretty certainly either to
Catullus LXI., the Epithalamium of Junia and Manlius,
494 J. G. Piddingtoyi [PART
or to CatuUuvS LXII., generally known as the Epithala-
fnium Catulli. In both poems the mvocation to Hymen
—
" 0 Hymenaee Hymen, Hymen 0 Hymenaee, lo Hymen
Hymenaee io," " Hymen o Hymenaee," and so on in
slightly variant forms—recurs again and again. This
curious coincidence between Mrs. Salter's Script C and
Mrs. King's Script G is the sort of coincidence that
apparently some people are light-heartedly prepared to
attribute with confidence to chance.
In Script I " the harps in the air " is preceded by
" Held above the floods," which a few weeks later re-
appears, for the only time, in Mrs. King's script J in
the form " held aloft above the flood." If we assume
these two very similar phrases to be a connecting link
between Scripts I and J, we get the following text from
a union of the two :
Held above the floods . . . The song is sung far
above— The harps in the air ...
The cornerstone of the building is set ... I see a
kind of trophj'^ with a stick and a wreath twisting round
it. It stands for some kind of triumph, held aloft above
the flood.
With the trophy and the wreath on the stick we may
compare the wreath that Solness hangs on the top of
the two towers. " The song is sung far above " is the
song that both at Lysanger and ten years later Hilda
imagines that she hears Solness singing on the top of
the tower. Besides the cjuotation from Ibsen's play
already given on p. 492 above, compare the following
sentences all spoken by Hilda :
" That was the song that I heard through the air !
"
" Now I see you again as I did when there was song
in the air."
" Then do you hear no song in the air, either ? . . .
/ hear a song—a mighty song !
"
" The cornerstone of the building is set " in J suggests
the ceremonial laying of the foundation-stone of a
building, and so can hardly apply to the completion of
102] The Master Builder 495
the Church Tower or of the house-tower m Ibsen's play ;
but it may be mtended to suggest '^a ceremony connected
with building, and so either or both of the two ceremonies
performed by Solness. In any case, it should be compared
with " the cornerstone of the builders " m A, and with
" the master builder the cornerstone—the church tower
"
in F.
It is unlikely that a reason for such a conjunction
of topics as the Master Builder and " Hymen Hymenace "
in C, or of the Master Builder and " Epithalamium " in G,
will be discoverable by comparing Ibsen's play with
Catullus', or any one else's, Epithalamium. |^But this
is not so with the conjunction of the Master Builder
with the Temptation scene in Paradise Regained, for
obviously a fall from a great height is common to both.
But the parallelism, I believe, goes deeper than that :
for, in the first place, as I will show in detail presently,
Ibsen's Master Builder Solness, like Milton's Satan, is
a defier of God ;
and, ui the second place, Solness, like
Milton's Mammon, is a builder of High Towers, and in
Mrs. Salter's scripts Milton's Mammon is identified with
Lucifer whom Milton identifies with Satan. The evidence
for these two identifications will be found in Appendix C
(pp. 502-505 below).
In calling Master Builder Solness a builder of High
Towers I am not thinking only of the " tremendously
high " Church Tower at Lysanger and of the High Tower
of his own house, but of certain passages in the play
where his tower-building is stressed. Thus Hilda says
to Solness : "I thought, if you could build the highest
church-towers in the world, you could sui'ely manage
to raise a kingdom of one sort or another as well "
;
and when Solness mentions that he has built a tremendous
lot of late years, and Hilda asks, " Many church-towers
among the rest ? Immensely high ones ?
" his answer,
" No. I buUd no more church-towers now," implies
that he had built them in the past. Then, later on,
when he explains that he now builds only " homes for
human beings," and Hilda asks " But homes with high
496 J. G. Piddington [PART
towers and pinnacles npon them ? ", he answers " If
possible." Finally, Solness announces his intention of
giving up the building of homes for human beings in
order that he may build a Royal Castle " to pleasure the
princess he loved," an ideal castle in the air with a
high tower.
Of Mammon, architect and builder of Pandaemonium
—
whom Mrs. Salter's scripts identify with Lucifer—Milton
says :
his hand was known
In heaven by many a tower d structure high,
Where sceptred angels held their residence,
And sat as princes ...
Nor was his name unheard or unadored
In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land
Men called him Mulciber ; and how he feU
From heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements . . .
. thus they relate
Erring ; for he with this rebeUious rout
Fell long before ; nor aught avail'd him now
To have built in heaven high towers ; nor did he 'scape
By all his engines ; but was headlong sent
Witli his industrious crew to build in hell.
I will now give the evidence for the statement made
above that Ibsen's Master Builder Solness resembles
Milton's Satan in that he is a defier of God. In the
third Act Solness tells Hilda that he is afraid of retribution,
and then proceeds to explain why. He came, he saj'S,
from a pious home, and as a young man it seemed to
him that the noblest task he could set himself to was
that of building churches to the glory of God. So
he began his career as a church-builder, and worked with
such devotion that he felt that God ought to be pleased
with him. Yet he knew instinctively that He was not ;
for it was God who had brought about the burning of
his old home, and the death of his two children, hi order
102] The Master Builder 497
to turn him into a perfect master of liis craft with
the skill to erect still more glorious churches in God's
honour. This view of God's dealings with him had
flashed upon him when he was building the church at
Lysanger. He then had realised for the first time how
God meant him to go through life without love or happi-
ness, a mere Master Builder building churches for God.
In bitter revolt he plucked up courage to "do the
impossible," climbed to the top of the Church Tower,
and there, as he was hanging the wreath over the vane,
he thus, as he tells Hilda, set God at defiance :
Hear me now, thou Mighty One ! From this day
forward I will be a free builder—I too in my sphere
—
just as thou in thine. I will never build more churches
for thee—only homes for human beings.
At this point in his account of his inner life Hilda
breaks in with
That was the song that I heard through the air !
Nevertheless, building homes for human beings, Solness
goes on to confess, brought him no more contentment
than building churches ; and so, as he tells Hilda, from
now on he is going to build only Castles in the air ;
and, when he is at the top of the tower of his new
house, he is going to notify God of his new resolve :
I will say to him ; Hear me, Mighty Lord—thou
may'st judge me as seems best to thee. But hereafter
I wiU build nothing but the loveliest thing in the world
. . . build it together with a princess, whom I love . . .
And then I Avill say to him : Now I shaU go down and
throw my arms round her and kiss her . . . Then I
will wave my hat^—and come down to the earth—and
do as I said to him.
Here Hilda exclaims :
Now I see you again as I did when there was song
in the air.
To the Master Builder's strife with God there is one
more allusion near the end of the play. When Solness
498 J. G. Piddington [PART
is standing at the top of the house-tower, the following
dialogue is exchanged between Ragnar (a draughtsman
employed by iSolness) and Hilda :
Ragnak.
I feel as if I were looking at something utterly impossible.
Hilda.
Yes, it is tfi,e impossible that he is doing now. [With the
indefinable expression in her eyes.] Can you see any one else
up there with him ?
Ragnae.
There is no one else.
Hilda.
Yes, there is one he is striving with.
Ragnab.
You are mistaken.
Hilda.
Then, do you hear no song in the air, either ?
Ragnar.
It must 1)0 the wind in the tree-tops.
Hilda.
/ hear a song—a mighty song.
The song in the air that sounded like harps is, it
should be observed, each time associated with Solness's
defiance of God.
It would be superfluous to illustrate at length the
Miltonic Satan's defiance of God ; but one passage may
be cited, as it is perhaps reflected in Script C in the
words " the bottomless abyss—depths unplumbed—down
down down " :
Him the Almighty Power
Hurl'd headlong flaming from the ethereal sky
With hideous ruin and combustion, down
102] The Master Builder 499
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire,
Who dm-st defy the Omnipotent iii arms.
{Par. Lost, I. 44-49.)
With " bottomless perdition " here, and wdth " the
bottomless abyss—depths unplumbed '"'
in C, compare
I am that spirit unfortmiate,^
Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt.
Kept not my happy station, but was driven
With them from bliss to the bottomless deep.
{Par. Reg. II. 358-361.)
It may, I think, be fairly claimed that " the harps
in the aii' " of ]Mrs. King's scripts involves reference to
Solness's ascent of the Church Tower, his ascent of and
fall from the tower of his own house, and his strife
with God. And these are the very points in Ibsen's
play to which Mrs. Salter's scripts allude. But Mrs.
Salter's scripts imply a parallel, not implied in any
script of ]\Irs. King's so far discussed, between the Master
Builder's and Satan's spirit of revolt. An attempt to
supply the deficiency, how'ever, is perhaps traceable in
a script of Mrs. King's of which hitherto no mention
has been made. This particular script, it so happens,
contains the third and last reference to Oedipus in all
her scripts,^ and runs thus :
King 509 {Aug. 12, 1920).

is no sense in it ; for Oedipus was presumptuous neither
towards man nor God. It looks, hoTvever, as if an

and " trusted to liave equal'd the Most High."

APPENDIX A.
The Automatists' Knowledge or Ignorance op the
Literary References.
Both automatists are acquainted with the English trans-
lation by Edmund Gosse and William Archer of Ibsen's
Master Builder Solness. Mrs. King saw the play per-
formed in 1893 ; Mrs. Salter about 1912 or 1913.
Mrs. King has read no Ovid.
Mrs. Salter has no recollection of ever having read the
passage in Ovid, 3Iet. VII. 759-761 (" Carmina Laiades,"
etc.). She writes on March 17, 1927 : 'I read a certain
amount of Ovid, of course, in my school-room and college
days, and cannot be certain that my eye has never fallen
on that particular passage. But, as I say, I have no
recollection of it."
In December, 1926, withovit giving any hint of my
reasons for doing so, I read to Mrs. King Purgatorio
XXXIII., 46-50 (see p. 490 above), where Dante alludes
to Ovid, Met. VII., 759-761, and asked her if she knew
the passage. I did this because I thought it just con-
ceivable that, if she had read the Dante passage in an
annotated edition of the Purgatorio, she might from the
notes ad loc. have learnt about the Ovid passage. She
assured me that, to the best of her knowledge and belief,
she had never read the lines in the Purgatorio ; and she
hadn't the sliglitest idea of what Dante meant by " the
facts shall be the Naiades that will solve this hard
riddle."
In March, 1927, Mrs. Salter, at my request, looked
up the passage in the Purgatorio. After doing so, she
wrote to say that she had no recollection of ever having
read it before, and added :
'" My knowledge of Dante is
102] The Master Builder 501
very slight, as I decided many years ago that, however
great a poet he might be, he was not my man !
"
In December, 1926, without explaining why, I read to
Mrs. King the following lines in Paradise Regained apart
from their context :
And as that Theban monster, that proposed
Her riddle, and him who solved it not devour'd ;
That once found out and solved, for grief and spite
Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,
and asked her if she recognised them, if she understood
the reference generally, and if in particular she knew
who was meant by " that Theban monster." Her answer
to all three questions was " No." When I told her the
source of the lines, she said that, though she has read
bits of Paradise Regained, she believes she has never read
it through.
Mrs. Salter has read Paradise Regained more than once.
Both automatists inform me that they had never heard
of a parallel being drawn between Milton's Satan and
Ibsen's Master Builder Solness.
When, in December, 1926, I told Mrs. King about the
cross-correspondence between her Script E and Mrs. Salter's
Scripts C, D, and F, she said that she felt sure that there
were references to the Master Builder in her own scripts
too. This was news to me, so I asked her what they
were. She couldn't remember ; and I then asked her
what quotations from the play she remembered best. She
mentioned the repeated references to " the younger
generation," and Mrs. Solness's nine dolls ; but failed to
recall anything else. Some time later, having read
the play, I asked her if she remembered " the harps
in the air " coming in her script ;
and, if so, what
she thought it meant. She said she remembered the
words perfectly, and associated them with some musical
phrase, or with a song ; but she could not identify the
musical phrase or the song. After an interval, during
which other subjects were talked of, I said to her :
" Do you remember me telling you about a cross-corre-
spondence between you and Mrs. Salter on the subject
2k
502 J. G. Piddington [PART
of the Master Builder ?
" The words were hardly out
of my mouth, before she broke in with :
" Oh ! of course,
that's where '
harps in the air '
comes from "—or words
to that effect.
APPENDIX B.
Tennyson's "Ulysses" and Ibsen's "Master
Builder."
It is clear that Mrs. Salter's Script C, when read in
connexion with Script B, means to link " Finisterre,"
and so the "Ulysses" topic, on to the Master Bttilder.
I suggested above (p. 481) that the Ulysses topic represents
the life-long pursuit of the unattainable. That is a fair
description of the theme of Tennyson's Ulysses, and it
is at least a defensible description of the theme of Ibsen's
Master Builder. William Archer, in his Introduction to
the English translation of the play, records that Ibsen
wrote in the album of the lady who was " the principal
model for Hilda " the following words :
" Hohes, schmerzliches Gliick—
•
um das Unerreichbare zu ringen !
"
These words he renders " High, painful happiness—to
struggle for the unattainable !
" ; and he adds that " we may,
if we like, see " in them " a foreshadowing of the Solness
frame of mind."
APPENDIX C.
Satan, Lucifer, and Mammon.
(See p. 495 above.)
In Paradise Lost I., 678-751, Milton describes the building
of Pandaemonium by Mammon and his crew. Mammon,
the architect and builder of this palace of Satan, had, he
explains, before his fall been
known
In heaven by many a tower'd structure high
Nor was his name unheard or unadored
102] Tlie Master Builder 503
In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land
Men called him Mulciber ; and how he fell
From heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements : from morn
To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, . .
A summer's day ; and with the setting sun
Dropp'd from the zenith like a falling star
On Lemnos, the ^gean isle ; thus they relate.
Erring ; for he [i.e. Mammon] with this rebellious rout
Fell long before ; nor aught avail'd him now
To have built in heaven high towers ; nor did he 'scape
By all his engines ; but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in hell.
Three extracts will suffice to show that Milton's
Mammon-Mulciber is identified in Mrs. Salter's scripts
with Lucifer. Thus :
H.V. 332 {Oct. 17, 1913).
. . . fallen angels—write that too—from morn to
dewy eve—a summer's day . . .
H.V. 458 {Dec. 19, 1915).
. . . the gates of Hell— Lucifer son of the morning
—From morn to dewy eve . . .
H.V. 463 {Feb. 24, 1916).
. . . Lucifer—son of the mornmg—from morn to
dewy eve—the island of Lemnos—it is the passage
in Milton that is wanted—that is important ...
Now Lucifer is identified with Satan, not only popu-
larly, but thrice by Milton in Paradise Lost, as follows :
<1) At length into the limits of the north
They came ; and Satan to his royal seat.
High on a hiU far blazing, as a mount
Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers
From diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold ;
The palace of great Lucifer, (so call
That structure in the dialect of men
Interpreted) which not long after, he.
504 J. G. Piddmgton [PART
Affecting all equality with God,
The mountain of the Congregation caU'd.
{P.L. v., 755-767.)
Milton is here referring to Isaiah xiv. 12, 13 :
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of
the morning ! . . . For thou hast said in thine heart,
I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above
the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation, in the sides of the north.
(2) Know then, that, after Lucifer from heaven
(So call him, brighter once amidst the host
Of angels, than that star the stars among)
Fell with his flaming legions through the deep
Lito his place, . . .
(P VII., 131-135.)
(3) Pandaemonium, city and proud seat
Of Lucifer ; so by allusion call'd
Of that bright star to Satan paragon'd.
{P.L. X., 424-426.)
These are, I believe, the only passages in Paradise Lost
where Satan is called Lucifer, and to all three allusion
seems to be made in Mrs. Salter's scripts. Thus, with
(1) compare " Lucifer, son of the morning " in H.V.
458 and 463 above.
With (2) compare H.V. 573 of Sept. 2, 1922 :
The brighter star than all One star To climb the
heavens [cf. Isaiah xiv. 13 :
" For thou hast said in
thine heart, I will ascend into heaven."] The Zenith
[i.e. " Dropp'd from the zenith like a falling star On
Lemnos."]
With (3) compare first H.V. 449 of Nov. 10, 1915 :
bright star— Each bright particular star,
and then H.V. 617 of July 4, 1925 :
Fallen from his high estate fallen from heaven Dropt
from the zenith like a falling star The crystal battlements
The star of eve Each bright particular star.
102] The Master Builder 505
There is nothing whimsical or outre in identifying
Mammon with Satan : it is, indeed, the sort of parallel
that might well suggest itseK to some one familiar with
Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Spenser's Faery
Queen. Some of the points in Milton's description of
Mammon in Book I. of Par. Lost are admittedly borrowed
from Spenser's description of Mammon in Book II., Canto
VII., of the Faery Queen. In Par. Regained (II. 406-486)
Milton, departing from the Biblical accounts, represents
Satan as tempting Christ with an offer of riches ; and
several of the commentators point out that the speech in
which the offer is made is more or less reminiscent of
the one put by Spenser into the mouth of Mammon when
he places all his riches at Sir Guyon's disposal on condi-
tion that the knight serve and follow him. In Par.
Regained (IV. 536) Satan refers to Christ's rejection of his
proffer of riches immediately before he carries Him up to
the highest pinnacle of the Temple.
The identification, then, of Mulciber-Mammon with
Lucifer in the scripts has some sort of literary warrant.
At the same time I see no reason to suppose that any
attempt has been made in the ' scripts to connect Spenser's
Mammon with Milton's Mammon, or Mammon's temptation
of Sir Guyon with Satan's temptation of Christ as
imagined by Milton. All that the scripts do is to associ-
ate together Lucifer and Mulciber-Mammon ; and the
reason for the association is to be found in the fall which
both suffered.

REVIEW.
The History of Spirihialism . By Aiithue Conan Doyle.
2 vols. Pp. 684. Constable. 42s. net.
" Spiritualism " is a very comprehensive term : in this book,
for instance, it is necessary for the leader to bear in mind
that the anthor uses it in two entirely different senses. All
who believe in human survival of bodily death and the possi-
bility of communication between the dead and the living are
Spiritualists, but within this larger group there exists an inner
circle who base their belief in survival and communication on
a historical series of incidents, alleged to be supernormal, or
as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle calls them " preternatural " ; and
for the purposes of this review 1 j^ropose temporarily to borrow
with a slight change of sense the French distinction between
" Spiritualist " and " Spiritist," and to apply the latter term to
the inner group. It must be emphasised that the distinction
between Spiritualist and Spiritist applies solely to the basis of
belief, and does not imply any less degree of conviction in
either party.
The incidents which are the basis of the Spiritist's faith
begin with the Hydesville occurrences in 1848, so that the
" cult " (as Sir Arthur terms it) is just eighty years old. It
is therefore by now well launched on its career, and in view
of its remarkable growth it was high time that a connected
account of the movement should be written by one occupying
so jDrominent a place in it as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
The " cult " flourishes partly within the older religious bodies
and partly through sej)arate " churches "'
founded to jiromote
it. It has already developed an authoritative canon of miracles
and martyrs, and the Spiritualist who is rash enough to doubt
any one item of the canon seems to be regarded with less-
favour than the complete unbeliever.
102] Revieiv 507
To write a history of Spiritism from within requires a high
degree of courage. The miracles of Spiritism, whatever parallels
the Spiritist may draw between them and those of older
rehgions, have this pecuharity that they owe nothing to any
superior moral quaUties on the part of the persons by or
through whom they were manifested. It is not surprising
therefore that earlier Spiritists have shrunk from the task of
attempting a consecutive history, almost every chapter of
which must contain a regretful reference to some serious
shortcoming on the part of the particular medium Avhose powers
are being discussed.
Earlier histories there have been, notably Podmore's books ;
but Podmore was not within the cult, and the mention of him
in Sir Arthur's Preface is so grossly unfair that a passing
reference to it must be made. " IVIi-. Frank Podmore," says
the Preface, " brought together a large number of facts, and
by ignoring those which did not suit his purpose, endeavoured
to suggest the worthlessness of most of the rest, especially the
physical phenomena which in his view were mainly the result
of fraud." This statement can be so easily disproved by
taking almost any chapter of Podmore's Modern Spiritualism at
random, that we can only suppose that Sir Arthur's activities
have not allowed him time to read that book with the attention
it deserves.
The truth is that Podmore gives infinitely more facts as to
almost any medium that can be mentioned than Sir Arthur,
facts favourable to the medium's supernormal powers as Avell as
unfavourable. Even from the purely spiritistic point of view
Podmore's detailed and documented accounts, say of D. D.
Home or Stainton Moses, are in every way superior to the few
sketchy pages Sir Arthur Conan Doyle allots to them, so that
any Spiritist who wished to explain to an enquner Avith no
previous knowledge of the subject why these men made the
impression they did would do -well to lend him Modern
Spiritualism rather than the History of Spiritualism. As to
Home, Podmore quotes incident after incident which he admits
he cannot explain by simple trickery.
Podmore of coiu-se was very sceptical as to the super-
normality of physical phenomena, and it is quite legitimate for
Sir Arthur to contest his conclusions. "What is not legitimate
^08 Bevieiv [PART
is for Sir Arthur to charge Podmore^s book as a whole with a
tendencious selection or supjaression of relevant facts, an
accusation which can much more justly be brought against
Sir Arthur himself.
Podmore died some time ago, and since his death there have
been several interesting developments in Psychical Research,
both on the physical and mental side. A book that should
treat these later developments on the lines on which Podmore
treated the earher phenomena is badly needed.
It would matter little whether such a book were written
from Podmore's point of view or the opposite, provided it
conformed to Podmore's standards of fullness and documenta-
tion. Alike where Sir Arthur covers the same ground as
Podmore, and where he deals with new matter, he faUs very
far short of these standards, and he would have been well
advised for his own sake not rashly to have provoked the
comparison.
As an example let us take the accounts in the two books of
the Davenport brothers' performances at Liverpool in 1865.
At Liverpool in February two members of the audience
tied their (i.e. the Davenports') hands so brutally that
.
blood flowed, and Mr. Ferguson cut the rope and released
them. (Sir Ai-thur Conan Doyle, History of 82nritualism,
vol. i. p. 229.)
On the Committee appointed on the first night were two
gentlemen who possessed the secret of a special knot,
called the Tom Fool's knot. This knot they apphed to
the wrists of the Davenport Brothers. Each jarotested that
the knot was unfairly tight and injured the circulation.
A doctor summoned to the platform gave it as his opinion
that no injury to the circulation was to be apprehended,
and that, in view of the smallness of the mediums' hands,
the loiot was not unnecessarily tight. The Davenports
refused to proceed with the performance under such con-
ditions, and Ferguson was ordered to cut the knots.
(Footnote) Liverpool Daily Post, 14th, 15th, 16th Feb. 1865.
In the Post of the 23rd Feb. a picture of the baffling knot
is given. (Podmore, Modern Spiritualism, vol. ii. p. 60.)
102] Revieiv 509
After the lapse of sixty years there may be doubt as to
exactly what happened in this instance : what is not doubtful
is that Podmore's narrative carries conviction in a way Sir
Arthur's does not.
If Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wishes to discredit Podmore with
intelligent readers, if he is aiming at anything higher than
propaganda among the ignorant and uncritical, he must quote
chapter and verse from contemporary records of eye-witnesses
to support his version : to show, e.g. that what Podmore says
as to the medical examination is unfounded.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's treatment of this incident is highly
instructive. No sane person presumably would nowadays base
his faith in a future existence on the exact natiu-e of knots
tied in the year 1865 round the wrists of two men who at the
time made no claim to assistance from the spirit world in their
jierformances (vol. i. p. 234). But notwithstanding their own
ambiguous attitude to the cult the Davenports have by now
been completely canonized. It is no longer necessary to defend
them : it is sufficient to talk of " brutal opposition and even
persecution " without going too closely into the facts. But
there are other mediums, who seem not yet to have attained
that fortunate state, for whose apparent lapses excuses have to
be offered : e.g. the wandering hmb foimd moving the furniture
was " ectoplasmic " (vol. i. p. 306, and Index) : alternatively
evil spirits made the medium cheat for a joke (vol. i. p. 75 ;
ii. p. 208) : in the further alternative persons of otherwise good
credit and character conspired to " frame up " an exjjosure
{vide sub EgUnton and the Crewe Circle). With these, and
doubtless other, Unes of defence to fall back on there is not
much in Sir Arthur's claim that in the course of a long career as
an investigator he camiot recall one smgle instance where it was
clearly shown that he had been mistaken upon any serious point,
or had given a certificate of honesty to a performance which was
alterwards clearly proved to be dishonest !
" " Clearly shown "
and "clearly proved" to whom? To Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
This claim follows very shortly after the author's account of
a sitting in Australia with Bailey, the apport medium, who
produced a small bird's nest with a white egg in it, stated by
the Hindoo " control," to be the nest and egg of the Indian
Jungle Sparrow.
510 Review [PART
The medium, or rather the Hindoo control acting through
the medium, placed the egg on his palm and broke it,
some fine white albumen squirting out. There was no
trace of yolk. " We are not allowed to interfere with
life," said he. "If it had been fertilised we could not
have taken it."' . . . Surely it is a fair argument that
while it is conceivable that such birds might be imported
and ]5urchased here, it is really an insult to one's reason
to suppose that nests with fresh eggs (italics ours) in them
could also be on the market.
It is really an insult to the reader's reason to suppose that
he is incapable of seeing that by breaking the egg in this way
the medium (or the control, if that is preferred) made it
impossible either to identify the egg as being that of any
particular species, or to form any opinion as to its freshness.
Moreover the reason given for breaking it is absurd : eggs can
easily be tested for fertility without breaking them, and this is
in fact done on an average several thousand times a day in
this country alone.
We are sure that, if no question of Spiritism were involved,
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be the first to reahse the worth-
lessness of this incident as evidence of anything except the
duplicity of the medium, whom Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself
caught Ij^ing on another occasion.
The \\'hole attitude of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to what are
called " the physical phenomena of spiritualism " presents a
curious psychological puzzle. He regards them as of a com-
paratively low order, speaks of the lowly and occasionally
sordid atmosphere " surrounding them, and very candidly notes
the moral shortcomings of several of the mediums producing
them. He recognises that the type of phenomena to the study
of which the S.P.R. has devoted much attention, the trance
utterances of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Leonard, the cross-corre-
spondences, etc., are (assuming their supernormahty) of far
greater value and imj^ortance. But while these may be freely
criticised without arousing his indignation, any criticism of the
physical johenomena is rigidly taboo. What is the cause of
this anomalous attitude ?
Mainly, we think, a historical one. It was not on cross-
102] Review 511
correspondences or an3rthing of a like nature that the " cult
"
was founded, but on raps, levitations, materialisations, and so
on. Criticise these and you undermine, not the basis for the
belief in survival, but the basis on which rests the actual
'structure of Spiritism as an organised cult.
In the second place we have to reckon with the repugnance,
which the Spiritist shares with those Psychical Researchers most
opposed to survival, to admit the full reahty of anything not
perceptible to the five senses. This it is Avhich lies at the root
of the French division of psychical phenomena into " objec-
tive " and " subjective." Thoughts and ideas are merely
" subjective " : ectoplasm is the real thing : you can see^
touch, smell it (if the resemblance to the entrails of a not
very recently slaughtered animal does not offend your senses) ;
" it mtist be supernormal," says the metapsychisfc : "it tmisi
come from the Spirit world," adds the Spiritist.
If Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had called his book " The
Mythology of Spiritism," there would be little cause for com-
plaint. The adherents of every cult must be allowed a fairly
wide choice of myths, and if the Spiritists experience a par-
ticular devotion to the Davenport brothers or Mr. Bailey's eggs,
that is primarily their concern. But such illustrations as those
facing vol. i. p. 244 and vol. ii. p. 108, are altogether out of
place in any work claiming the title " History." In the latter
illustration Prof. Richet, Count de Gramont, Dr. Geley and the
medium Kluski are shown seated at a table, at one end of
which stands a majestic spnit-form, pointing triumphantly to
two paraffin moulds, while Prof. Richet gazes with rapture at
him. Considering that Prof. Richet has never accepted the
spiritistic hypothesis in any shape, to describe this picture as
" an ideahsed non-evidential impression " hardly seems to do
justice to its supreme absurdity.
In conclusion it may be well to contradict a few incorrect
statements of Sn Arthur Conan Doyle about our Society and
some of our prominent members, before they become finally
incorporated in the spu-itist mythology.

'•
Spirituahsts and particularly mediums, look upon the
investigators " {i.e. of the S.P.R.) " and their methods with

mediums are fraudulent : others not. Some mediums dislike-

their best friend.

page.) We do not know what Sir Arthur means by " preter-
natural," or who the " circle of men " are to Avhom he refers.
A study of the S.P.R. Proceedings for the last, say, ten or
twenty or thirty years does not suggest that the Society is or
ever was dominated by persons hostile to evidence of the
supernormal in general, or evidence for survival in particular.

" The report " {i.e. on Eva C.) . . .
" is a contradictory
document, for whereas the casual reader would gather from it
that no results—or none worth recording—were obtained . . .
Dr. Geley pubhshed an incisive paper in the " Proceedings " of
the Institut Metapsychique in which he exposed the fallacies of
the investigation and the worthlessness of the rejaort " (vol. ii.
p. 87). Our Proceedings are not meant for " casual readers,"
although apparently they found one in Dr. Geley ; it is a poor
service to his memory to recall attention to his " incisive
paper," which was not one of his happiest efforts. The Com-
mittee's Report, which was scrupulously fair, was warmly
praised by Monsieur Sage, whom Sir Arthur elsewhere quotes
with approval.
(4)
" The whole history of this case " (i.e. Mr. Price's ex-
posure of Hope) " and the refusal of the Society to face the
facts when they were pointed out to them, leave a shadow on
the record of all concerned." (Same page.) The " all con-
cerned " include several prominent spirituahsts, such as Sir
OHver Lodge, to whom Sir Arthur dedicates his book, and who
•expressly endorsed the Society's action. As to " the facts
"
pointed out to the Society, there were none. Certain infer-
ences were drawn by Mr. Hope's supporters from the facts
printed by the S.P.R. and the S.P.R. gave the same pubhcity
to these inferences (for what they were worth) as was given to
Mr. Price's exposure. Sir Arthur further omits to mention
(1) that the S.P.R. also offered like pubhcity to any well-
authenticated evidence in favour of Hope's supernormal powers,
and printed the only case submitted which had the shghtest
evidential value, and (2) that the S.P.R. offered Hope a fresh
102] Review 513
investigation by a Committee to be appointed half by tlie
S.P.R. and half by Hope himseK, and that Hope backed out
at the very last moment.
(5) Concerning the investigation of " Margery " by the
Scientific American Committee, " Dr. Prince was very deaf,
while Dr. M'Dougall was in a position where his whole academic
career would obviously be endangered by the acceptance of an
unpopular explanation " (vol. i. p. 341). Dr. Walter Prince
does, we believe, suffer from deafness, but this does not
prevent his being a finst-class investigator. The insinuation
against Dr. M'Dougall is as absurd as it is disgraceful, having
regard to the boldness with which he has always championed
Psychical Research, regardless of the indifference or hostility of
orthodox science.
(6) On pp. 59 and 60 of vol. ii. a long extract is given from
Mr. E. T. Bennett's Twenty Years of Psychical Research (1904)
in which he comments on the smallness of the results obtained
in the investigation of physical phenomena. Sir Arthur adds,
" These sweeping charges against the Society are made by a
friendly critic." The passage quoted from Mr. Bennett con-
tains no charges whatever against the Society, and the context
makes it plain that the sole point of Mx. Bennett's remarks
was that the investigation of physical phenomena is not as
easy as it looks.
It is only fair to add that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is not
unreservedly hostile to our Society. He speaks of its " strangely
mingled record of usefulness and obstruction," and expresses
the hope that " the period of sterility and barren negative
criticism may be drawing to an end." We must be thankful
for small mercies, of course, but the fact that the Society has
collected, analysed and pubhshed in large quantities the only
kind of evidence for survival which appeals to whose who are
not prepared to stake their faith in a future life on sparrows'
eggs crushed in the medium's hand, and that the best of this
evidence has been obtained during the alleged " period of
sterility," surely calls for a rather more generous tribute from
a leader of " Spiritualism." And if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
were more of a Spiritualist and less of a Spiritist such a
tribute would no doubt be forthcoming.

STATEMENT BY MRS. CRANDON (MARGERY)
Editorial Note.—In Vol. XXXVI. of Proceedings there
appeared a letter from Mr. Everard Feilding, enclosing
(amongst other things) a letter by Mr. G. H. Code,
referring to a private sitting which he (Mi*. Code) claimed
to have had with the medium Margery (Mrs. Mina S.
Crandon), on the 30th June, 1925, and also Mr. Code's
" Record " of the " sitting." At the end of the " Record
"
a note was printed as follows :
No further correspondence on this subject will be pub-
Ushed. —Ed.
It has never been suggested in our Proceedings or
Journal that Mrs. Crandon accepted Mr. Code's account
of what occurred on the 30th June, 1925, but to prevent
any possibility of misconception as to Mrs. Crandon's
attitude, the Council of the S.P.R., while declining to
re-open the discussion as to the genuineness of Mrs.
Crandon's mediumship, agreed to give her the opportunity
of denying, with the same pubhcity as had been given to
Mr. Code's letter and " Record," that she had given Mr.
Code a private sitting. She was accordingly informed of
the Council's decision, and in reply Dr. Crandon forwarded
the appended statement.
Boston, Mass.,

This is to certify that June 30, 1925, about noon, Mr.
Grant H. Code came to caU on me at my house at 10
Lime Street. At that time he was an Assistant in English
at Harvard College and was a member of a group of
young Harvard Instructors who were having sittings at
Harvard CoUege with me.

516 Statement by Mrs. Crandon {Margery) [part
He was admitted to the house by Mrs. Lizzie Waters and
made his way up one flight, where I met him in what
we call the Book room. Mrs. Waters is what is called
an accommodator, and occasionally comes to help in my
domestic work.
He came to discuss the episodes of the sitting which
had taken place the previous night, and incidentally to
talk over his personal affairs, as a man might discuss
them with his mother or sister. He stayed about twenty
minutes and did not leave the Book room, brightly
lighted with sunshine, until he left it to go out of the
house.
There was no " sitting." There was no trance. We
did not go to the Seance room.
Then personally appeared the above named Mina S.

103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 517
CASE OF THE WILL OF JAMES L. CHAFFIN.
Index No. G. 293.
We are indebted for the following case to one of our
Canadian members who, having had his attention
drawn to it by a newspaper report, instructed a lawyer
resident in the State (North Carohna), where the
events occurred, to investigate the facts on his behalf.
The facts had already been put in evidence in a con-
tested law-suit, so that they have on two occasions
undergone the scrutiny of persons professionally trained to
sift and weigh evidence. The lawyer instructed by our
Canadian member, j\Ir. J. M'N. Johnson, Attorney-at-Law,
of Aberdeen, North Carohna, has forwarded to the Society
a very full report including (1) the original newspaper
article, (2) official records of the proceedings in the
Superior Court of Davie County, N.C., and (3) a sworn
statement by ]\Ir. Johnson as to interviews he had with
some of the principal persons in the case, together
with sworn statements by two of these jDersons themselves.
What foUows is partly an abstract of these documents,
and partly quotations from them. The full case can be
stiidied by those who desire to do so at the Society's
Rooms.
James L. Chaffin, the TcvStator, was a farmer in Davie'
County, N.C. He was married and had fom: sons, in
order of age John A. Chaffin, James Pinkney Chaffin,
Marshall A. Chaffin, and Abner Columbus Chaffin.
On the 16th November, 1905, the Testator made a
will, duly attested by two witnesses, whereby he gave his
farm to his tliird son, Marshall, whom he appointed sole
executor. The widow and the other three sons were
left unprovided for.
Some years later he appears to have been dissatisfied
518 Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin [part
with this disposition of his property, and on tlie 16th
January, 1919, he made a new will as follows :
After reading the 27th chapter of Genesis, I, James
L. Chaffin, do make my last wiU and testament, and here
it is. I want, after giving my body a decent bm-ial,
my little property to be equally divided between my
four children, if they are living at my death, both personal
and real estate divided equal if not living, give share to
their children. And if she is living, you all must take
care of your mammy. Now this is my last will and
testament. Witness my hand and seal.
James L. Chaffin,
This January 16, 1919.
This second will, though unattested, would according to
the law of North Carolina, be valid as being written
throughout by the Testator's own hand, on sufficient
evidence being adduced that it was in fact in his hand-
writing.
The Testator, having written out this will, placed it
between two pages of an old family Bible, formerly
belonging to his father, the Rev. Nathan S. Chaffin,
folding the pages over so as to make a sort of pocket.
The pages so folded were those containing the 27th
Chapter of Genesis, which tells how the younger brother
Jacob supplanted the elder brother Esau, and won his
birthright and his father's blessing. The sole beneficiary
under the first will was, it will be remembered, a younger
brother.
The Testator never before his death, so far as can be
"ascertained, mentioned the existence of this second will to
anyone, but in the inside pocket of an overcoat belonging
to him he stitched up a roll of paper, on which he had
written the words " Read the 27th chapter of Genesis in
my daddie's old Bible."
On the 7th September, 1921, the Testator died as the
result of a fall. His third son, Marshall, obtained Probate
of the first will on the 24th September of that year.
The mother and the other thi'ee brothers did not contest
this will as they knew of no valid reason for doing so.
103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 519
From tliis point it \A'ill be convenient to follow the
words of the sworn statements obtained by Mr. Johnson
on liis visit to the locality on the 21st April, 1927.
Extract from statement of James Pinkney Chaffin, Testator's
second son.
In all my life I never heard my father mention having made
a later wiU than the one dated in 1905. I think it was in June
of 1925 that I began to have very vivid dreams that my
father appeared to me at my bedside but made no verbal
communication. Some time later, I think it was the latter
part of June, 1925, he appeared at my bedside again,
dressed as I had often seen him dressed in life, wearing a
black overcoat which I knew to be his own coat. This
time my father's spirit spoke to me, he took hold of his
overcoat this way and pulled it back and said,
"'
You
will find my will m my overcoat pocket," and then
disappeared. The next morning I arose fuUy convmced
that my father's spirit had visited me for the purpose
of explaming some mistake. I went to mother's and
sought for the overcoat but found that it was gone.
Mother stated that she had given the overcoat to my
brother John who lives in Yadkin County about twenty
miles northwest of my home. I think it was on the 6th
of July, which was on Monday following the events stated
in the last paragraph I went to my brother's home in
Yadkin County and found the coat. On examination of
the inside pocket I found that the Immg had been se^d
together. I immediately cut the stitches and found a
httle roU of paper tied with a string which was in my
father's handwiting and contamed only the following-
words :
'
Read the 27th chapter of Genesis m my daddie's
old Bible.'
At this pomt I was so convinced that the mystery
was to be cleared up I was unwilling to go to mother's
home to examme the old Bible without the presence of
a witness and I induced a neighbour, Mr. Thos. Black-
welder to accompany me, also my daughter and Mr.
Blackwelder's daughter were present. Arriving at mother's
home we had a considerable search before we found the
520 Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin [part
old Bible. At last we did find it in the top bureau drawer
in an upstairs room. The book was so dilapidated that
when we took it out it fell into three pieces. Mr. Black-
welder picked up the portion containing the Book of
Genesis and turned the leaves until he came to the 27th
chapter of Genesis and there we found two leaves folded
together, the left hand page folded to the right and the
right hand page folded to the left forming a pocket and
in this pocket Mr. Blackwelder found the wiU which has
been probated. [i.e. was probated in December, 1925.]
During the month of December, 1925, my father again
appeared to me about a week before the trial of the case of
Chaffin vs. Chaffin and said '
Where is my old will,' and
showed considerable temper. I believe from this that I
would win the lawsuit as I did. I told my lawyer about
this visitation the next morning.
Many of my friends do not believe it is possible for
the living to hold communication with the dead but I
am convinced that my father actually appeared to me on
these several occasions and I shall believe it to the day
of my death.
Statement of the said Thos. A. Blackwelder:
My name is Thomas A. Blackwelder. I am 38 years
old and the son of H. H. Blackwelder. My home is on
a farm in CaUihan township about one mile from the
place where Jas. L. Chaffin died in 1921. I think it was
on July 6, 1925, that Mr. J. P. Chaffin, the son of Jas. L.
Chaffin and a neighboiu- of mine came to my house and
asked me to go with him to his mother's home and at
the same time stated that his father had appeared to
him in a dream and instructed him how he could find his
will. Mr. Chaffin told me at the same time that his
father had been dead about four years and had appeared
to him in a dream and made known to him that he
should look in the breastpocket of his old overcoat and
there he would find something of importance. Mr.
Chaffin further stated that he had gone to this overcoat
and had foimd a strip of paper in his father's handwriting
and he wanted me to go with him to his mother's and
103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 521
examme the old Bible. I went with him and we made a
search for the Bible and after some time we found it in a
bureau drawer in the second story of the house. We took
out the Bible which was quite old and was in three
different pieces. I took one of the three pieces of the
book and Mr. Chaffin took the other two pieces but it
happened that the piece I had contained the Book of
Genesis. I tm-ned the leaves untU I came to the 27th
chapter and there found two leaves folded inward and there
was a paper writing folded in these two leaves which
purported to be the last will of Jas. L. Chaffin.
It appears from Mr. Johnson's own statement that,
in addition to Mr. J. P. Chaflfin and Mr. Blackwelder,
Mrs. J. P. Chaffin, their fifteen year old daughter, and
Testator's widow were present when the Bible was found.
Soon after its discovery, the second will was tendered
for Probate. The son, Marshall, who had proved the
first will, had died within a year of his father's death :
he left a son, R. M. Chaffin, who was made a defendant
in the suit to prove the second wiU^ and who, being a
minor, appeared by his mother as guardian ad litem and
next friend.
The cause came on for hearing in December, 1925. A
jury was sworn (this usually takes some time in the
United States) and the court then adjourned for lunch.
When the hearing was continued one of the lawyers
armounced that diiring the interval an amicable adjust-
ment of the issues had been arrived at, and that the new
will would be admitted to probate without opposition.
The following is taken from an official copy of the minute
of the Judge presiding :
Judgement by Consent.
In Re Will of J. L. Chaffin Deed.
North Carolina, Davie County. In Superior Coiu't,
December Term, 1925.
Judgement, Decree :
This cause coming on to be heard, and being heard and
the following issues having been submitted to the Jury
'
Is the paper writing dated January 16th, 1919, and
522 Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin [part
every part thereof the last Will and Testament of the
deceased—Jas. L. Chaffin ?
'
Answer—' Yes.' -
And the Jury having answered said issue Yes, It is
now on motion of E. H. Morris, A. H. Price and J. C.
Busby, attorneys for the Plaintiffs Ordered, Decreed, and
Adjudged that the said last Will and Testament of James
L. Chaffin deceased be recorded in the office of the Clerk
of the Superior Court of Davie County in the Book of
Wills and that the Will dated November 16th, 1905, and
probated on September the 24th, 1921, Will Book No. 2,
Page 579, purporting to be the Last Will and Testament
of the deed. James L. Chaffin is hereby cancelled, rescinded,
annulled and made void.
When the trial commenced, Marshall's widow and son
had been prepared to contest the second will. However,
during the luncheon interval they were shown the second
will. Ten witnesses were prepared to give evidence that
the second will was in the Testator's handwriting, and
the widow and son themselves seem to have admitted
this as soon as they saw it. At any rate they at once
withdrew their opposition. The public, which had
crowded the court in the hopes of watching a bitter family
feud fought out, retired disappointed.
So much for the facts stated in the documents. In
considering whether they can be accounted for without
recurrence to the supernormal, we must riile out any
explanation which presupposes either that the second
will was a "fake," or that any of the parties interested
under the second will had normal knowledge of its exist-
ence prior to Mr. J. P. Chaffin's and Mr. Blackwelder's
search for the old Bible in July, 1925.
As to the hypothesis of a " fake," it is indeed curious
that the Testator should have been so anxious to remedy
the injustice done by the first will as to make a second
will on entirely different lines, and at the same time have
been so remiss in taking precautions during his lifetime
for the carrying into effect of his second will. Possibly he
103] Case of the Will of James L. Chaffin 523
intended to reveal its existence on his death-bed, and the
circumstances of his death as the result of an accident
frustrated his intention. But the fact that ten witnesses
were prepared to swear that the second will was in the
Testator's handwriting, and that Marshall's widow and
son, after seeing the document, admitted its genuineness,
seems decisively to negative any hypothesis of a ''
fake
"
will. Moreover, Mr. Johnson, who interviewed and ques-
tioned IVIr. J. P. Chaffin, his wife, mother and daughter
in April, 1927, was, to use his own words, " much im-
pressed with the evident sincerity of these people, who
had the appearance of honest, honourable country people,
in well-to-do circumstances."
Mr. Johnson in his statement suggests, only to dismiss,
another possible explanation. " I endeavoured with all
my skill and ability by cross-examination and otherwise
to induce some admission that possibly there was a
subconscious knowledge of the Will in the Old Bible, or
of the paper in the coat pocket, that was brought to the
fore by the dream : but I utterly failed to shake their
faith. The answer was a quiet :
'
Nay : such an explana-
tion is impossible. We never heard of the existence of
the will till the visitation from my father's spirit.'
"
Clearly, they none of them had any conscious recollec-
tion, at the date of the Testator's death, of any mention
of a second will, or they would not have allowed the
first will to be proved without opposition. Nor was it a
matter which, if once mentioned, they were likely to
forget, during the short period which intervened between
the making of the second will (January, 1919) and the
Testator's death (September, 1921). The hypothesis
therefore of the '
exterioralisation '
in the form of a
vision, of knowledge normally acquired by Mr. J. P.
Chaffin, but only remembered subconsciously, is open to
grave objection.
It is hard to suggest a satisfactory explanation of the
facts on normal lines. If a supernormal explanation be
accepted, it is to be noted that the present case is of
a comparatively infrequent type, in which more than one
of the percipient's senses is affected by the phantasm.
524 Case of the \Vill of James L. Ghaffin [part
Mr. J. P. Chaffin both " saw " his father and " heard " him
speak. The auditory impression was not strictly accurate :
what was in the overcoat pocket was not the second will,
but a clue to its whereabouts ; but the practical result was
the same. Mr. Johnson was unable to obtain a clear
statement from Mr. J. P. Chaffin as to whether he was
awake or asleep a.t the time of the apparition. He
first said he was awake but on a " rather rigid examina-
tion " admitted that he might have been in a " doze."
" I beheve he does not know himseK."
A somewhat similar case, also from America, is printed
in Myers's Human Personality, Vol. II., pp. 37-40, in
which a woman, who fell into a swoon on hearing of her
father's sudden death, stated on coming out of the swoon
that her father had appeared to her, and told her there
was a considerable sum of money sewn in a pocket
inside the shirt he was wearing at the time of his death.
The clothes had been tlurown away : they were recovered
and bills amounting to $35 were found in the pocket as
described. The daughter appears to have had no normal
knowledge of the facts revealed by the apparition. In
that case, however, the apparition followed very shortly
after the death and may have been due to an impression,
telepatliically conveyed from the father immediately before
his death, being delayed in emergence. In the present
case nearly four years intervened between the death and
the apparition, so that the hypothesis of delayed telepathy
is hardly applicable.
A
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 525
AN EXPERIMENT IN PSEUDO-SCRIPTS.
By W. H. Salter. 1
The purpose of this paper is to give an account of an
experiment conducted with a view to ascertaining how
far a series of " pseudo-scripts " would produce results
in any way comparable to the cross-correspondences
which have been found in the scripts of the automatic
writers often referred to as the S.P.R. group," and with
the further object of elucidating, if possible, the problem
of the causes underlying and the agencies producing
such cross-correspondences. What is meant by pseudo-
scripts will be explained more fully later, but it may
be convenient at this stage to say that fourteen members
of the Society, who kindly consented to co-operate in
the experiment, were given a certain number of phrases
to choose from, and were asked to write down any words
or sentences that suggested themselves and to post the
results to me before a definite date.
Suggestions have from time to time been made {e.g. by
Dr. Broad in Chap. XII. of The Mind and Its Place in
Nature) that experiments of this kind ought to be con-
ducted, and one experiment has in fact been made and
reported on in the Journal (Vol. XV.). In that case the
experimenters were not given any starting point or points
for their pseudo-scripts but were asked to take passages
of literature at random and work on those. It seemed
desirable to repeat the experiment with the variation
of giving the pseudo-automatists a Hmited choice of
starting points in view of the fact that " the S.P.R.
This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on
July 8, 1927.
526 W. E. Salter [part
group " had a certain amount of knowledge of each other's
scripts.
I have spoken of " ehicidating the problem " of the
real scripts, but I am aware that suggestions have been
made that there is no problem requiring elucidation, except
in so far as a fictitious problem has been created by the
commentators. The illusion of coherent design in the real
scripts has, it is hinted, been produced by the arbitrary
selection and grouping of detached fragments, eked out by
an unfair straining of literary allusions.
Opinions will no doubt differ as to the precise meaning
of scripts admittedly full of allusive symbolism, but a
careful reading of all the published scripts and the com-
mentaries thereon leaves me with the conviction that the
number of instances in which topics and allusions in these
scripts have been wrongly identified is so small as to be
negligible.
The charge of unfair selection can only be judged by
those who have complete knowledge of all the scripts
of " the S.P.R. group." This knowledge is confined
to the commentators themselves, who have from time
to time explained in some detail the principles on which
they work : as they are persons of extreme accuracy, it
seems gratuitously rash to suspect them of unfairness
in those cases where they have not given their reasons
for grouping scripts in a particular way.
On the assumption then that we are confronted with
a genviine problem, five possible explanations suggest
themselves, of which three may be grouped as normal,
namely (1) chance, (2) collusion. (3) common association
of ideas, and two as supernormal, namely, (4) telepathy
from some living person, and (5) the influence of some
discarnate intelligence. i
Of these explanations the first, i.e. chance, pure and
simple, may be immediately rejected. Whatever goes to
the production of the scri2)ts of " the S.P.R. group," they
are something more than a fortuitous concourse of words
from a dictionary or quotations from a concordance.
They obviously owe something to selective human intelli-
gence, if only to the conscious or subconscious minds of
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 527
the automatists. Chance no doubt plays a part, as in
all human affairs, but it must be auxihary or subsidiary
to some more effective agency.
In the case of these particular automatists, collusion
may also be left out of account. Although I mentioned
it among the possible " normal " explanations, it seems
to me, having regard to all that is laaown of the members
of the group, to be highly abnormal and even fantastic.
Putting then chance and collusion aside, we are left
with two possible explanations, other than the influence
of discarnate intelligence, namely, common association of
ideas, and telepathy. It was to test the operation of these
two agencies that the experiment was designed.
It need hardly be said that no experiment of this
kind, whatever the results obtained, could constitute a
conclusive proof as to the cause or causes underlying the
cross-correspondences of " the S.P.R. group." Supposing
that the pseudo-scripts shoidd show (as they in all
probability would) correspondences inter se, questions
would arise which different people might reasonably
answer in different ways. For instance : Are the corre-
spondences in the pseudo-scripts more or less remarkable
than those in the real scripts ? How is it j)ossible in
either real or pseudo-scripts to differentiate between the
results of telepathy and of common association of ideas ?
Most difficult question of all, what guarantee is there
that if, as is sometimes claimed, the real automatists
were influenced by discarnate intelligences, the pseudo-
automatists were not amenable to the same influence ?
But even though the result of the experiment could
not be final or conclusive, it might help to elucidate
the modus operandi of the real scripts.
The fourteen pseudo-automatists were selected by Miss
Newton and myseff, and the only persons besides ourselves
who knew of the composition of the team were my
wife, and a temporary clerk in the S.P.R. office, to whom
some of the necessary papers were given to be typed.
In Part II. of the experiment, in which twelve out of
the original fourteen took part, I divided the pseudo-
automatists by lot into two groups of seven and five
528 W. li. Baiter [part
respectively, and informed each member of the grovip of
seven who the other six members of that group were.
In selecting our team Miss Newton and I deuberately
exchxded all members of "the S.P.R. group," and all
persons who have been actively engaged in elucidating
the scripts of " the S.P.R. grouj)." The fourteen are
denoted by the letters A to N inclusive, and of these
we knew that C and D j)ractised automatic writing, and
had achieved success as telepathic " agents," and that
M had also given evidence of possessing telepathic powers.
B and M are ladies ; A and F clergymen. B and J
are distinguished classical scholars. D and I have strong
literary tastes, while E, G and L have all specialised in
some branch of science. C combines literary and scientific
attainments. Almost all the fourteen have taken an
active part in the Society's work.
As a team they are much more homogeneous than
" the S.P.R. group." Apart from the relationship between
Mrs. Verrall and my wife (Miss VerraU), " the S.P.R. group
"
had, except through their scripts, little to link them
together. Several members were personally quite unknown
to other members. The educational standards of different
members varied considerably. Two were born and brought
up in America : two had resided long in the East.
Some were not members of the Society.
Among the pseudo-automatists on the ' other hand there
is a much more level standard of education. All are
members of the Society. All, I beheve, are British by
birth and normally resident in this country. We might
therefore reasonably expect common association of
ideas to work more powerfully among the pseudo-
automatists than among " the S.P.R. group," and on the
assumption that such association is the main, if not the
sole, cause of correspondences between the real scripts,
to find, other conditions being equal, more numerous
and striking cases of correspondence among the pseudo-
scripts.
The joossible influence of telepathy has, of course, also
to be considered. Unconscious telepathic " leakage " of
the land postulated by Prof. Pigou (see Proc, XXIII.
,
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 529
pp. 286-303) cannot be experimentally proved or dis-
proved ; it rests entirely on surmise, without any evi-
dential foundation. But, in order to test telepathy as
far as practicable, attempts were made, as will be ex-
plained more fully later, to influence the pseudo-scripts
by dehberate, conscious telepatlty.
In each of the two parts of the experiment each pseudo-
automatist was requested to produce between 200 and
300 words of pseudo-scrij)t. I have not counted how
much each sent in, but taking 250 as a rough average,
we have altogether 14x250 = 3500 words for Part I., and
12x250 = 3000 words for Part II., 6500 words altogether.
From start to finish the experiment lasted twenty-four
days, from the 3rd to the 27th March, 1927. This is of
course very much less than the time required for the
production of many of the real cross-correspondences, but
then many of the real scripts are short, there are often
long intervals of time between them, and the largest
number of real automatists concerned in any case is, I
think, six, and in most much less.
A production of 6500 words of pseudo-script in twenty-
four days would seem to be fairly comparable to the
total output of real script by " the S.P.R. group " over
a much longer period. It would at any rate be enough
in quantity to form a pretty good basis for comparison.
As, however, the pseudo-automatists might be considered
to be handicapped by shortness of time, I decided to
give them a countervaihng advantage over " the S.P.R.
group," by giving them a limited choice of starting-
points. In Part I. I set them twelve short phrases, one
or more of which they were at hberty to choose as texts,
and for Part II. I added a passage of thirty-six words,
consisting of several short phrases.
" The S.P.R. group " were not bound by any such
limitations. The world was all before them, where to
choose their several starting points. They might start
from one of the real scripts known to them through
publication in Proceedings or otherwise, but the mass
of script material known to them offered a very wide
choice, and they were in no way confined even within
530 W. H. Salter
'
'
[paet
these very wide limits. Assuming, therefore, that common
association of ideas is the main cause of correspondences
between real scrijDts, such correspondences should, ceteris
paribus, occur with much greater frequency in the pseudo-
scripts. Taken together, the greater homogeneity of
the pseudo-automatists, and the hmitation of their points
de repere seem to me greatly to outweigh any advantage
accruing to the real scripts by reason of the short time-
limit imposed on the pseudo-automatists.
I devised the main lines of the experiment in January
1927, and on February 9 I handed Miss Newton the
twelve phrases I had chosen, and a draft of the instruc-
tions to accompany them. She and I at the same
time drew up a list of members of our Society who were
to be invited to co-operate. On February 14 or 15,
Miss Newton handed the phrases and instructions to a
temporary clerk to be copied. For reasons appearing
later the fact that the phrases were finally selected, and
that my original draft of them had passed out of my
possession in the first half of February, is of importance.
The instructions and the twelve phrases sent to each
of the fourteen pseudo-automatists were as follows :
INSTFvUCTIONS.

13th March, 1927) discuss it with anyone else or mention the

2. Select any single phrase or group of phrases from the
paper attached, and write at the head of your reply which
phrase or phrases you have selected.
3. Write down any words, phrases or sentences that suggest

coherent train of thought connecting what you write down with
the phrase or phrases selected.
4. Write down between 200 and 300 words, either at one
time or on separate occasions as you prefer, in either case
dating what you write.
5. You may use English, French, Latin or Greek, alone or
in combination. If you quote, please give the source of your
quotation, if possible.

The phrases and instructions were all sent out on
March 3, the only persons, besides the pseudo-automatists,
^who knew what the phrases were, being Miss Newton,
the typist who copied them, my wife and myself.
A few days earlier (on February 27) I asked Mr.
Piddington, who did not know either the phrases or
the names of the pseudo-automatists, to select a phrase
or topic and send it to Miss Newton. On March 1
he sent Miss Newton a sealed envelope with instructions
that it was not to be opened without his authority.
"The sources of the quotations, and the translations of phrases 9 and 12,
shown in square brackets, were not commtmicated to the pseudo-automatists.

532 W. H. Salter [part
The envelope contained the following passage from Anatole
France's short story Putois :
Extract from Anatole France's Putois {Crainquebille, Putois,
Piquet, et 2^1'usieurs autres recits projitables, Calmann-Levy, Paris)
chosen by J. G. P. for pseudo-C.C. experiment.
Quant a notre mere [i.e. the mother of M. Lucien
Bergeret and MUe. Zoe Bergeret], eUe se reprochait im pen

Putois etait ne d'un mensonge de notre mere, comme
Caliban du mensonge du poete. Sans doute les fautes
n'etaient pas egales et ma mere etait plus umocente que
Shakespeare. Pourtant elle etait eifrayee et confuse de
voir son mensonge bien mince grandir demesurement, et sa
legere imposture remporter un si prodigieux succes, qui ne
s'arretait pas, qui s'etendait sur toute une ville et mena9ait
de s'etendre sur le monde.
I knew nothing of the contents of the envelope until
March 30, several days after both parts of the experiment
were concluded.
Mr. Piddington informs me that he did not let a day pass
while the experiment was in progress without deliberately
thinking of this passage from Putois.
The object was to ascertain whether the contents of
the sealed envelope would influence or show any connection
with the pseudo-scripts. It will be remembered that in
the " Sevens Case " {Proc. XXIV.), the contents of a
sealed envelope deposited by Mr. Piddington bore a
striking relation to the scripts of six automatists of
" the S.P.R. group " written shortly after. It has been
suggested that Mr. Piddington inspired the comjilicated
references to the number " Seven " in the scripts of
these automatists, and I thought it would be interesting
to see whether his alleged inspiratory influence extended
to my team.
But I did not see why Mr. Piddington should be the
onty begetter of cross-correspondences, and I determined
to try my own luck at the game. I accordingly fixed
on two literary topics on which I would keep my mind
103] A7i Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 533
more or less continuously during the experiment, and
I chose some of the twelve phrases with a view to their
serving as rather distant clues to these topics. The
intention was that the clue-phrases should not be near
enough to make it hkely that any of the pseudo-auto-
matists would jump to either topic by pure unaided
reason, but that they might serve as a spark to fire a
telepathic train.
Phrases 1, 2, 10 and 11 (the quotations from Shake-
speare, Milton, Wordsworth and Coleridge) were chosen
more or less at random as being well-known lines from
famous poets. They had not any particular associations
in my mind : the others had.
Phrases 3 to 9 inclusive were intended to refer obscurely
to the subject of two books I happened to have been
reading last winter, namely Statius' Thebais and
Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes.
The subject of these two poems is the same, the Argive
expedition against Thebes occasioned by the quarrel
between the two sons of Oedipus. The Theban legend
is a long and complicated one : for the purpose of my
experiment I confined myself to the latter part of the
story, i.e. to the events succeeding the fall of Oedipus
from the kingship, and to one particular episode in that
part, namely, the fate of three of the Seven Argive
Champions. I shall not inflict on the Society a full
explanation of all the Uterary allusions I embodied in
these seven phrases as clues to the topic I had in my
mind. They were deliberately far-fetched and involved
in order that not even the accomplished classical scholars
in my team could reasonably be expected to get the
right answer by guesswork, however brilhant, unaided by
telepathy. All, as I have said, related to a particular
episode in the latter part of the tale of Thebes, except
(and the exception is of importance) that in phrase 3,
the first of this group of phrases, I introduced an allusion
to the Sphinx and repeated the allusion by putting
phrase 5 in the form of a riddle. The Sphinx and her
riddle belong to the earlier part of the legend and have
only a very remote connection with the main topic of
534 W. H. Salter [part
the puzzle. She is, therefore, you may say, dragged in
by the taiL
" The World is weary of the past " is the penultimate
line of the final chorus in Shelley's Hellas, from which
I will quote two stanzas :
O, write no more the tale of Troy ^
If Earth Death's scroU must be,
Nor mix with Laian rage the joy '
Which dawns upon the free, '
Although a subtler Sphinx renew
Riddles of Death Thebes never knew.
0 cease ! must hate and death return ?
Cease ! must men kill and die ?
Cease, dram not to the dregs the urn
Of bitter prophecy.
The world is weary of the past :
Oh ! might it die or rest at last.
Phrase 12 contains another literary puzzle of a simpler
kind. The line is part of the greeting addressed by the
nymph Calypso to Hermes : the meaning of the line
is irrelevant to the experiment, and so is the context.
But the same line (with change of gender) occurs in
two other places in Homer {Iliad, XVIII., 386 and 425),
and the context of the passages is significant. The
words are addressed to Thetis, first by the wife of
Hephaestus (
= Vulcan =Mulciber) and then by Hephaestus
himself. Between the two greetings Hephaestus narrates
his fall from Olympus. The Iliad tells this story in two
different ways : according to Book I. he was lame because
he fell ;
according to Book XVIII. he fell because he
was lame. In Book XVIII. he falls into the sea : in
Book I. on the isle of Lemnos, and that is the story I
was getting at. Phrase 12 is a clue to it at two removes.
I chose this topic, the fall of Hephaestus on Lemnos,
for two reasons. One reason was similar to that which
guided my choice of the Theban legend. In November
1926 I had read a paper (quite unconnected with Psychical
Research) to a small Society meeting in my part of the
country, and in that paper I had occasion to refer to
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 535
Homer's story of tlie fall of Hephaestus, and to quote
Milton's description of it in Book I. of Paradise Lost.
The topic was thus fresh in my mind.
The second reason was that some years ago, during
the War, when my wife and I were doing table-tilting
experiments together, there had been references to Lemnos :
I have since ascertained that there was one in our first
table-tilting in November 1916. These references had
puzzled us both at the time, and we then supposed that
they were connected with the War, and particularly
with the death of a friend in the Eastern Mediterranean.
But on my mentioning the matter some time later to
Mr. Piddington, he replied briefly that they referred to
" Mulciber."
I felt sure that none of the pseudo-automatists knew
either that there had been table-tilting allusions to Lemnos,
or what those allusions meant. I did not myself then
know what were the script associations of the Mulciber-
Lemnos story, and it seemed to me it would be instructive
to see not only whether any of the pseudo-automatists
got on to that topic, but whether, if they did, they
developed it on the same lines, whatever those might
be, as the real scripts.
The introduction of these two literary puzzles was
intended, among other things, to serve as a means for
distinguishing between the operation of telepathy and
of common association of ideas. If the only points of
contact discoverable between the pseudo-scripts were
connected with the topics of these puzzles, that would
suggest telepathy, and the case for telepathy would be
particularly strong if any of the pseudo-automatists,
other than those who had specialised classical knowledge,
arrived at or approximated to a solution of either puzzle.
If on the other hand any points of contact occurred in
connection with other phrases and other topics, that
would suggest common association of ideas rather than
telepathy.
If no one of the fourteen caught on to either of my
two topics, or to the topic (then unknown to me) lying
hidden in Mr. Piddington's envelope, it seemed to me
536 W. H. Salter [part
that deliberate and conscious telepathy having been given
three chances with fourteen persons and having failed
every time, unconscious or subconscious telepathic " leak-
age " would be, I do not say disproved, as an explanation
of cross-correspondences, whether in real scripts or pseudo-
scripts, but at least considerably blown upon. A long
step would have been taken towards relieving Mi\ Pidding-
ton of the odious suspicion of having instigated the
" Sevens " cross-correspondence.
None of the pseudo-automatists in Part I. in fact got
on to any of the thxee topics which Mr. Piddington and
I indejDendently were trying to transmit : none of them
made an unmistakable, even if distant, approach thereto.
M and J come the nearest.
M in a pseudo-script covering an immense variety of
topics mentions one of Anatole France's stories {L'lle des
Pingouins) ; this is a long story not included in the
volume of short stories containing Putois.
J, working on the Odyssey line I had given as one of
the twelve phrases, begins " Elpenor—but I don't see
the connection." Elpenor is a very minor character
in the Odyssey about whom all we are told is that he
broke his neck falling off a roof where he had gone
to sleep, and that his shade is the first to greet Odysseus
in the Land of the Dead. J, therefore, gets the idea
of a fall, which is part of the Hephaestus-Lemnos topic.
That appears to be the best either Mr. Piddington or
I could do in the way of conscious telepathic trans-
mission, and it is not much to boast of.
There are, on the other hand, a few points of resem-
blance between the different pseudo-scripts which, having
regard to the failure of Mr. Piddington's and my efforts
at telepathy, and to the fact that the pseudo-automatists
were given a limited choice of starting points, seem prima
facie to be the result of the common association of
ideas. Viewed in this hght most of these correspondences
seem to me obvious and almost inevitable : the surprising
thing would have been their non-occurrence : some seem
to be not quite so obvious, and one or two are perhaps
rather beyond what might have been expected.
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 537
I will mention all the correspondences I have noted,
placing them in an ascending scale, beginning with the
most obvious ones : complete specimen pseudo-scripts
will be printed in the Appendix, so that a general idea
can be formed as to how far they resemble the real
scripts of " the S.P.R. group."
In connection with the phrase " The world is weary
of the past," two pseudo-automatists suggest that it
may become even more weary of the future, a thought
which has probably occurred to all of us during the
aftermath of the " War to end War." Another pair
refer in slightly varying language to the scriptural precept
about the dead burying their dead : this, like the first
seems to me so obvious a development of the idea of the
phrase as hardly to be worth mentioning.
For the remaining correspondences I will quote sufficient
of the context in each case to indicate the train of
thought. The passages in square brackets represent the
pseudo-automatists' own annotations.

" They also serve ivho only stand and

B's Script : Gth March.
I have chosen this because it has been a favourite of
mine for years and comforted me when I could not do as
much as I wanted to. . . . There is also the association
with the absurd joke in Punch years ago of the line being
the motto for Robert, the head-waiter.

have most of us, I suppose, when dining at a restaurant
called to mind and perhaps quoted Milton's line.
III. Phrase :
" When is a crab not a crab
"
D's Script : 4th March, 1927.
Muttlebury was in the Cambridge boat that year—now
they call him the unofficial coach. The stars in their

Answer to above question is when it is a nebula, an
oarsman's error, a constellation, an apple.
This seems to me a little more hopeful, but only a
little. There was obviously a " catch " in the phrase
chosen, and it is not surprising that two pseudo-auto-
matists writing in the month of March, when the news-
papers are full of allusions to the University Boat Race,
and one of the two a resident at Cambridge, should,
so to speak, catch a crab simultaneously.
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 539
IV. Phrase chosen :
" The moon and stars. The mid-day
sun."
C's Script : 5th March, 1927.
" I know the country where the white moons burn and
heavy star on star dips on the pale and distant desert
hills " [a fragment : Flecker] the river of the sun that fills

M's Script : 10th March, 1927.
He stoppeth one of three. A painted ship upon a
painted ocean. The sun stood still—the albatross—the sun
a copper ball—dying eyes—thirst.
This is the first case of two pseudo-scripts combining
in a literary allusion which was not an almost inevitable
development of the plirase chosen : the lines from the
Ancient Mariner :
AH in a hot and copper sky
The bloody sun at noon
Right up above the mast did stand
No bigger than the moon.
were not in my mind when I chose the phrase "The
moon and stars : the mid-day sun ", or when I included
the lines, also from the Ancient Mariner :
He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small.
But probably it was the influence of these last two
lines which made both C and M refer to the same
passage from another part of that poem. This seems to
me an excellent instance of the sort of result which
common association of ideas may be expected to produce.
V. Phrases chosen : by E, " The world is weary of the
past "
; by M, " When is a crab not a crab."
E's ScrijJt : Uth March, 1927.

Crabbed age and youth. Apollo.
Here E and M get to the same point though they
choose different starting-places. E arrives there by a
link of meaning, M by a link of sound ; but I strongly
suspect that both were thinking of both the phrases,
although they chose to prefix only one, and that a
different one in either case.
VI. Phrases chosen: by J, " aiSoto? re cj^t'Aos -e," etc.,
by K, " The world is iveary of the pasty
J's Script : 12th March, 1927.
Elpenor [Homer, but I don't see the connection] my
friend S. killed in the War—an infrequent visitor—poena
damni—" Styx nine times interfused " [Vergil]. "Oh, for
a touch of a vanished hand." [Tennyson, misquoted ?].
" The murmuring courts where the shapes of sleep con-
vene " [Rossetti].
(Then follows the passage quoted under I.)
ICs Script : 6th March, 1927.
What is past is jjast.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
You camiot make omelettes without breaking eggs.
Let the dead bury their dead [Bible].
The good old times.
Oh for the touch of a vanished hand [Tennyson].
The sins of the fathers upon the chUdren [Bible].
This seems to me the correspondence much furthest
removed from the obvious. The line, " Oh for the touch,"
etc., fits in quite appropriate^ in K's series of proverbs
and gnomic sayings about the past. But it is odd that
J should get to the same point starting from the Odyssey
line which, as explained, has nothing to do with Elpenor.
Taking J's pseudo-script backwards, it is easy to trace
103] An Experiment in Psendo-Scripts 541
the connection of Tennyson's words with J's thought
of liis friend killed in the War, and from that to trace
the connection to Odj'-sseus' dead comrade, Elpenor.
But why drag in Elpenor ? This so puzzled me that I
wrote to J asking him what made him think of Eljoenor.
He replied, "I do not know what unconscious hnk
connected ai8o't(')<i ts (plXo? re k.t.X. with Elpenor. What
first came into my head was simply the name Elpenor :
after a moment's reflexion I recalled the circumstances
of his death and Odysseus' meeting with him in Hades,
but failed to see any connection with aiSoIu's Te <p'i\o<;
re K.T.X. The general tendency of the script was no
doubt influenced by the knowledge that the experiment
had a bearing on evidence for siu-vival." In point of
fact I had deliberately excluded from my choice of phrases
any that had in n]y own mind any association with the
idea of survival, any references, e.g. to Lethe or Pro-
serjiine.
This is the one and only case where it seems to me
a correspondence has been produced outside what might
have been anticipated from the common association of
ideas.
t Nearly all my pseudo-automatists had kindly agreed
to take part in a second round, and even before Part I.
was launched, I had formed a scheme for modifying the
conditions in two respects.
One modification was to divide the team into two
halves, so that Group I. should consist of persons knowing
each other's identities, but not the identities of the
members of Group II., while Group II. should remain as
much in the dark as before. The purpose was to ascer-
tain whether this knowledge would affect any corre-
spondences wliich might occur : whether they would
be greater or less within Group I. than within Group II.
For unavoidable reasons E and J were unable to
continue for the second part of the experiment, so that
the team was reduced to twelve. My intention was to
select six by lot for Group I., but accidentally, owing to
two pajjer slips sticking together when the lots were
542 W. H. Salter [part
drawn, Group I. actually contained seven members, and
Group II. five.
The second modification was to set as a text a piece
of real unpublished script produced by a member of
" the S.P.R. group," with a view to seeing whether any
of the pseudo-automatists would follow the same develop-
ment of ideas and phrases as was shown in the real
scripts. I accordingly wrote to Mr. Piddington on
March 9, explaining my intention, and leaving the selection
entirely to him. He rej)lied on March 10, enclosing the
following script :
Something about a church—a high-pointed spire against
the sky—Over the edge—the bottomless abyss—depths un-
phimbed—down down down—the topmost pinnacle—the
kingdoms of the earth—a king's son—known of old
—
Oedipus.
Part II. of the experiment began on March 15 and
ended on March 25. Mr. Piddington's selected script
was sent to each of the twelve pseudo-automatists with
instructions to treat it as additional to the twelve phrases
sent them for Part I. A, B, C, D, H, K and L, the
members of Group I. were informed of each other's
identities.
Two of the twelve (H and N) continued their associa-
tion with phrases set in Part I, without, however, scoring
any fiu'ther success. The remaining ten took Mr.
Piddington's selected script as their text.
Readers of Mr. Piddington's paper in Part 102 of
Proceedings will already have recognised the selected
script, which is in fact an amalgamation of two scripts
of my wife's. For the benefit of those who have not
read that paper, it may be stated that it elucidates a
cross-correspondence between certain automatic scripts
of Mrs. King and of my wife (the latter including the
" selected script "), and that this cross-correspondence
combines references to four falls from a height, namely
(1) the fall of Mulciber-Hephaestus on Lemnos [Milton,
Paradise Lost, Book I.] ; (2) the fall of the Sphinx after
Oedipus had guessed her riddle [Ovid, Met. VIL] ; (3) the
103] An Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 543
fall of Satan from the pinnacle of the Temple [Milton,
Paradise Regained, Book IV.. 11. 540-576] ; and (4) the fall
of master-builder Solness at the end of Ibsen's play of
that name.
Mr. Piddington's selection of this piece of script for
Part II. of the experiment was prompted, as he informs
me, by his having been for some time before working on
this cross-correspondence.
None of the pseudo-automatists knew anything about this
cross-correspondence until after Part II. of the experiment
had been completed. I first heard vaguely of a cross-
correspondence involving Oedipus and the Master Builder
after I had chosen the phrases for Part I., but knew nothing
definite about it until after the end of Part II.
None of the ten pseudo-automatists combines as much
as two of these four topics. None of them specifically
refers to any single one of them. There are, as was
to be expected, several allusions to the story of the
Temptation as told in the Bible, and. one of the ten (C),
quotes part of the relevant passage from Paradise Regained
(Book IV.). His quotation is as follows (11. 549-552) :
There on the highest pinnacle he set
The Son of God, and added thus in scorn :
"There stand, if thou wilt stand: to stand upright
Will ask thee skiU."
At that point he stops. He also mentions the Sphinx, the
only one of the ten who does so. His reference is as
follows
:
Oedipus and the Eiddling Sphinx. " What goes on four
feet, on two feet, on three, but the more feet it goes on
the weaker it be." "A Sphinx without a secret " Oscar
Wilde (short story) The Oedipus Complex.
After further allusions to Oscar Wilde's works and his
tomb, C passes on to the Egyj)tian Spliinx, a wholly
different creature.
As Mr. Piddington's selected script contained the words
" topmost pinnacle " and " Oedipus," there is nothing remark-
able in a man of C's wide reading touching on the Temp-
tation on the Temple as narrated hj Milton, or on the
544 IF. //. Salter [part
Sphinx. What is, I think, interesting and instructive, is
that C should come so very near combining two of the
four topics in Mr. Piddington's paper, and should have
missed them both. C has an unusual knowledge of Eng-
lish poetry, and particularly of Milton, as his pseudo-
scripts show. He quotes from the same passage in Paradise
Regained as Mr. Piddmgton up to a point, and then diverges
to the Temptation on the Mountain. Had he gone on with
his quotation another ten lines he would have hit on one of
the four falls of the cross-correspondence, " But Satan, smitten
with amazement, fell." Had he gone on for a further
eleven lines he would have come on the " Theban monster
"
and her fall. He knows his Milton well : after quoting
Milton's account of the Temptation on the Temple he
alludes to the Theban Sphinx : he does not combine the
two as Milton does, and as the scripts in Mr. Piddington's
paper do. That he should have come so near the real
thing, and yet wholly have missed it, suggests that caution
should be used before imputing to " the S.P.R. groxip,"
whose average literary knowledge is far below that of C,
unhmited powers, tlirough common association of ideas, of
combining in an intricate design passages from literature a
great deal more recondite than Paradise Regained.
So much as to connections between the pseudo-scripts
in Part II. and Mr. Piddington's selected script. Corre-
spondences between the pseudo-scripts themselves there in-
evitably are. Three of the ten take the spire to be that
of Salisbury Cathedral : as this is the highest spire in
England there is nothing noteworthy in that. Two, com-
bining the j)lii"<ises " church " and " depths unplumbed,"
arrive at the idea of submerged churches : but as there are
well-known stories of churches submerged in the sea at
various points round our coasts, this again comes to very
little. Then there are obvious and inevitable references to
the Temptation, i.e. to the Scriptural, as distinct from the
Miltonic narrative. Apart from these, I have failed to
trace any correspondences. Group I., the "informed"
group, fares no better than Group II., the " non-informed."
To sum up both parts of the experiment, the con-
siderable mass of pseudo-scrij)ts received shows no point
103] A71 Experiment in Pseudo-Scripts 545
of contact with any one of the three test topics chosen
independently by Mr. Piddington and myself in Part I.,
or with the script selected by him for Part II., unless
J's reference to Elpenor be a very distant approach to
the fall of Hephaestus or the other falls referred to in
Mr. Piddington's paper. Of the correspondences between
the different pseudo-scripts, if we take into account the
strictly hmited choice of starting-points allowed to the
writers, nothing seems clearly to pass the Hmits of the
obvious, except, again, J's contribution, his allusion to
Tennyson's " touch of a vanished hand," which he arrives
at via Elpenor. One may in fact say that if some un-
accountable impulse had not resurrected the dead Elpenor
in J's mind, the experiment would have been notably
barren of results in any way resembling the cross-corre-
spondences of the real scripts of " the S.P.R. group,"
although, for reasons already stated, the conditions of
the experiment were far more favourable to the production
of correspondences by common association of ideas than
the conditions under which " the S.P.R. group " function.
That at any rate is my opinion. Possibly some one
may be found to maintain that the experimental cross-
correspondences are quite up to the level of the real ones.
There is no accounting for tastes, but if such a person
comes forward I would point out (1) that none of the
pseudo-automatists, singly or jointly, produce any allusion
outside the range of their normal Uterary knowledge, in
the way that the members of " the S.P.R. group " fre-
quently do ; and (2) that such correspondences as were
produced were of the simplest possible kind ; there is a
momentary contact, after which the streams of association
diverge without the tendency characteristic of the real
scripts to come back again and again to a common point
of meeting. Nor are the pseudo-scripts, with a few ex-
ceptions, in the least hke the real article in general
appearance. They are, to take a single point of difference,
obviously much more influenced by the writer's own per-
sonal doings and experiences : when confronted with a
church spire, the clerical members of the team think of
churches with which they have had personal associations.
546 W. H. Salter [PAKT
such of the lay members as served in the War think of
their training on Sahsbury Plain or the shattered churches
of the War zone. Any one who would, after studying
both series, maintain that the same mental processes went
to the making of the pseudo-scripts and the scripts of
" the S.P.R. group " would, I think, prove himself de-
ficient in literary sense.
Curiously enough, the correspondences of this experiment
appear to be no better than those of the previous ex-
periment in jDseudo-scripts, although the conditions in that
case were less favourable, as the pseudo-automatists had
no common starting-point or points.
The inferiority as regards correspondences of the pseudo-
scripts in this experiment to the real scripts would not, of
coiirse, prove that the latter could not be the result of
common association of ideas and / or telepathy. There is
the human equation to be considered, and " the S.P.R.
group " may be—there is no reason to suppose they are
—
more readily influenced by these agencies than the pseudo-
automatists. What the experiment seems strongly to in-
dicate is that the hypotheses of telepathy and common
association of ideas must not be rashly invoked as obvious,
complete, satisfactory explanations of the phenomena of
the real scripts. They may be the true explanation, or
they may not : the onus probandi rests just as heavily on
those who propound them as on those who look for an
explanation elsewhere.
To complete the record of this experiment it is necessary
to refer briefly to one other correspondence, in which the
pseudo-automatists took no part, I mean the correspon-
dence between the two literary puzzles I had embodied in
the phrases handed to Miss Newton on February 9, and the
script selected by Mr. Piddington and sent me on March 10.
It is a very small and simple correspondence, but the
experiment produced such a poor crop within its designed
limits, that one cannot afford to neglect the unexpected
discovery outside its limits of so humble a specimen.
The reader will best be able to appreciate this corre-
spondence if he compares Mr. Piddington's paper in Part
102 of Proceedings with what I have already said as to
103] An Experime^it in Pseudo-Scripts 547
my two literary puzzles, but a brief recapitulation may be
useful. The first of these two puzzles introduced, rather
irrelevantly, two definite allusions to the Theban Sphinx ;
the second was a hidden allusion to the fall of Hephaestus
(Mulciber) on Lemnos. I have already explained the
reasons which led me to choose these two topics. There
was no conscious association between them in my
mind.
Mr. Piddington, at my request, but without any prompt-
ing on my part as to what he should choose, a month
later selects a piece of real script forming part of a cross-
correspondence between Mrs. King and my wife which
combines these two topics in a way I had never antici-
pated. His reason for the selection was that the selected
script lay ready to hand : he chose it, as he put it,
" largely to save myself trouble."
We acted quite independently of each other, and each
had quite natural and normal reasons for selecting what
we did. For some obscure reason we succeeded in pro-
ducing a correspondence which, if a molehill compared with
the achievements of " the S.P.R. group," is a mountain
compared with anything the fourteen pseudo-automatists
were able to produce, notwithstanding the advantage they
derived from having a limited choice of starting points.

The world is weary of the past—especially as regards
Ijroadcasting programmes. There will probably be room
for that weariness, also, in the future. The world ever
seeks something new, and the world is getting greater
opportunities of obtaining things new—sensational and other-
wise—than ever before. The world also seeks for new-
religions, but they are not like the old. " The old is
better " [St. Luke 5. 39]. To some extent they must be
influenced though by new knowledge. England need not
be weary of her past, for it is glorious. Indeed I do not
thmk that the saying is true of the World at large. We
tend to idealise the past. We have, it is true, cause to
do so, but human nature tends naturally to look back on
this period or on that as being ideal—whether it be from
the religious, historical, or any other point of view, and to
minimise present success. In reality things don't change
much in many respects. Human Nature doesn't change,
and if the World is weary of the past to-day, it will be
weary of the past in ten thousand years a,lso.

MORE THOUGHTS ON TRANCE PHENOMENA.^
By Rev. W. S. Irving.
It is scarcely possible, I think, to take a lengthy series
of sittings with trance mediums without coming to certain
conclusions of one's own on points of detail. These may
not be of much value, but may possibly interest other
researchers in the same field of enquiry ; and so I am
venturing again to put forward a few of my own thoughts
on trance phenomena in the hope of learning whether
they coincide with the thoughts of other investigators.
Also ; I have received, from time to time, statements
from my communicator, generally in " Personal Control,"
as to the difficulties that she says she encounters in
communicating. Some of these have seemed to me to
be original, and some of no little interest, so I am dealing
with a few of these below.
First I want to suggest ^ two more reasons why it
would seem to be risky to interrupt a control, by asking
questions, much as one often wants to do so ; or by
asking the control to " wait " while one takes the material
down. The communication received may not then, I
think, be what the communicator wishes to give.
It has been told me that there is danger of waking
the medium's subconscious mind to take an active interest
in what is being given, especially if the subject of the
communication be one in which the medium would nor-
mally be interested. The subconscious mind, according to
this theory, would seem to be liable at times—especially
if stimulated in any way—to wake to active interest, and
take a hand, as it were, in what is going on : cutting
off the communicating intelligence, and continuing the
conversation, though to the sitter there is no visible
^See also Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XXI., pp. 82-87.
556 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part
break, or sign—apart from the contents of the material—
•
that such a change has taken place. Indeed I think that
I have had instances of something of this sort, quite
recently, in my own sittings when I have not interrupted
the control in any way. It may be that it often happens.
For instance, in the " Personal Control," through Mrs.
Leonard, on April 20, 1926, almost directly after " D.G.I.
"
had brought up the subject of my cats, the tone of the
control changed, and became Feda-ish. The suggestion
was put forward that arrangements should be made that
when anything happened to me, the cats should not be
left behind ! Feda's great interest in cats will be familiar
to aU who have sat with Mrs. Leonard. This possibility
of the communicator being thus " cut off " suddenly was
first brought to my notice by the " D.G.I. Control
"
at a sitting on September 20, 1923. I had better quote
exactly what was then said as to this :
D.G.I. WUl you be seeing Belle next time you come ?
I ought not to have asked. (It doesn't matter. Why
did you ask ? ^) I can only say " Because Belle's in my
mind,"—Isn't it absurd ! Belle's fresh in my mind, do
you see ? (What makes the difficulty ?) The fact of the
other brain. I have to be so careful not to let the
brain question. Sometimes I state a thing as a matter
of fact, as if I didn't understand the importance, and
then afterwards I explain that I did understand. Sup-
posing, just then, when I said that about Belle, that I'd
tried to explain I'd seen Belle lately, the medium's brain
would have jumped at me saying " Have you ?
" " How ?
"
" When ? " and would immediately have raised a wall of
questioning ; but if I just squeeze a little natural state-
ment through that doesn't raise any curiosity, I can
foUow it up after. I think that's why questions are so
diffictdt to answer—because the medium's brain starts
asking questions, not her normal brain, but her automatic,
subconscious, part of her brain.
I had had a sitting with Mrs. Brittain, whose control
is " Belle," three days previously.
1 Remarks by the sitter are in round brackets throughout.
103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 557
Should this " cutting in " be a common occurrence it
may well explain some of the remarkable statements that
at times are made through mediums with regard to the
nature and character of life after death. Few subjects
would, I suppose, be more likely to awaken the interest
of the medium's brain, and it may be that true informa-
tion as to these things is well nigh impossible to get
through—unless, perhaps, it be in the form of book-
tests, when the medium, presumably, does not know what
is being given.
The second suggestion that I want to make, as to why
it is risky to interrupt a control, is that it would seem
to be possible that sentences may be missed by the
control during the brief time that elapses while a question
is being asked, or wliile the control is waiting the con-
venience of the sitter, and for the communicator to be
ignorant of this. At a sitting with Mrs. Leonard on
November 22, 1923, I found out, by chance, that this
had happened, and, if once, probably it happens not
infrequently. A book-test had been given by Feda
from my drawing-room, which was followed by some
definite descriptions of things in the room. After that,
Feda continued, " Why do you think ? Why does one
suddenly think of time in this room ? Time seems to
worry you a bit in this room." She feels you suddenly
starting up, and saying, ''What's the time ?
" As I do
not use my drawing-room, I saw at once that something
was wrong, and I asked " Which room are you talking
about ?
" Feda replied :
She says, go back a bit, and I'll go over this a little.
First of all we were in the room where the books were
that you go in straight from the door, and they were
opposite. She says, " I am not in that room now."
You didn't teU him, Dora ! She's glad you asked that.
You must teU Feda ! Sometimes she says something, and
when I ivait I forget somethmg. . . . Now she's in another
room—one you think of the time in.
Since writing the above, a third danger in asking
questions, or suggesting, has been mentioned by my
558 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part
communicator. It was at a sitting on November 18,
1926, and arose in this way. " D.G.I." had spoken of
having met " someone who's passed over . . . someone we
both knew." Certain particulars were given, but no
name. This it seemed to be impossible to give. Wishing
to see what the result would be I said, " Shall I suggest ?
"
I now quote from the Script :
D.G.I. No ! Better not ! Will ! There are times when
you suggest, and I can answer " No," but one doesn't
want to waken anything of the brain. When a question,
or a suggestion, comes from your side, it's likely to bring
a response from your side. You might affect the brain
of the medium, because her brain belongs to the physical
world you belong to. Its only with a certain amount of
difficulty I operate on it. I'm perfectly certain that
if you came with a very strong, and persistent, desire
to suggest—shall we say " Horace had passed over
"
that you might get that, because you would play on, and
aiiect, that part of the medium which responds to your
side of things. . . . The more perfect the psychic develop-
ment, the longer it would take you : for the well- developed
medium is trained to accept from our side only, but
that doesn't mean that they can never possibly get
something from yours. . . . The object of a good " Control
"
—a good " Spirit Control," I mean—is to get the medium
to respond to her, and to us—that is to the control,
and to us. It's just as well to know where we stand.
It's possible for a medium to get things from you, but
not desirable, and that's why we like to give things
ourselves instead of your suggesting them—then we're
on sure ground. Will ! The more sure we are—the more
we understand—the more quickly we shall get on. I
think that you and I have shown people we can get
things outside of telepathy, that couldn't by any stretch
of imagination be attributed to telepathy between you and
the medium. Of course there always is between me and
Feda
103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 559
(2)
Next I want to put forward the suggestion that the
subject of communications is limited to some considerable
extent by certain factors, little known as yet by us, but
one of which is the material to be found at the time
within the medium's brain. This, also, was told me by
the " D.G.I. Control," on April 28, 1925, and I think her
words are worth quoting at some length. I must just
say first, however, that I had recently come up to town,
and had brought sandwiches with me instead of having
lunch on the train as I usually do. I now quote from
the Script
:
D.G.I. Will ! Do you remember a very good test that
I gave once that was spoilt, or partly spoilt, by someone
saying something here ? . . . Will ! (Yes . . .) Were you
thinking about taking food with you a little while ago ?
(Yes). I seemed to get it from you. (Yes. I brought
sandwiches with me instead of having lunch on the train.)
I seemed to get that from your mind. I'll teU you why
I'm mentioning that. It reminds me of something you
and I used to do together—taking food with us hke
that ... I used to get it ready, wrap it up nicely, and
make it ready ... (I wonder if you could remember
something in connection with that ?) I'm thinking of
one special time that I'm reminded of (What happened
to it ?) Now I want to laugh ! Spoilt, sp>oilt. Will,
but in rather a funny way. It's the way it was spoilt
was so funny. On it. On it.
The communicator then tried to describe, at some length,
what had happened to the sandwiches—which had been
I
almost impossible to eat through having been put in a
newly varnished bag—but that in passing ! It is of her
statements immediately after this that I want to speak,
she continued :
When I talked about yovir sandwiches, I only did so
to lead up to this. I try to go from one thing to another,
it's the only way in which I can approach things. We
caU it over here " The Law of Associations," and that is
560 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part
how we work in every thing that we do. When we're
working with a medium—especially a normal one—we try
to find something in their normal consciousness that fits
with, what we want to talk about, and we work from that,
very often. ... If I'd got an important test, I should
look for something that Imked up with it in the medium's
mind. If I wanted to tell you the house had been on
fixe, I should try to find something in the medium's mind,
like " fire." " Striking a match," " Lighting a candle,"
would do. That is what you would caU colouring Then
I could work from that. When you find afterwards, the
medium's been doing a certain thing, you account for the
test in that way—which is quite correct. We often
wait to give a thing through till we find something that
corresponds to it in the medium's normal consciousness.
Will ! In everything we do, in everything we tell you,
we're working in some way in a link—through a link.
Don't you notice I use you in that way ? I watch you
doing some httle thing. Like I watched you with the
sandwiches, because it was making a httle link, in the
present conditions, with what I wanted to speak of—what
we had done. I used you as a foundation. Will ! That's
why names are so difficult—one can't get a foundation for
them.
In the above, I take it that the key-word found in
the mediuni's brain, and used as a foundation, was the
word spoilt ; and that my having been recently concerned
with food in a train was a stimulating factor that, also,
helped the communicator to speak on the subject of past
associations with food. Studying back sittings, with
these thoughts in mind, I find that, so far as I can
gather, this sort of tiling may be continually happening
—
although it is not often easy to learn both ends of the
link. The link in my mind can generally be traced by
me, but the link with the medium's brain must generally
be taken for granted. Occasionally, however, one may
get both. For instance, at my sitting with. Mi^s. Leonard,
on September 23, 1926, I showed her just before the
sitting, in the presence of my note-taker, a cutting
103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 561
from Light that I thought would interest her. The
word, therefore, was in her brain. One of the first httle
tests that my communicator gave—a trifling, preliminary
little test—concerned, apparently, some remarks that I
had made to Dr. Woolley about Light the day before.
The Script runs :
Feda. Mr. Bill ! Try and remember, after, if you were
reminded, or talking about, anything to do with lights
yesterday ? For Dora keep saying " Light," " light,"
pointing to herseh, and then to you, and saying " Light."
One more example, in which only one end of the link
can be traced. At a sitting on April 30, 1925, " D.G.I."
began to tallc about a girl named " Ada," and tried to
give her surname. She did not get it, but got something
like part of the sound, after several attempts. A few
days before the sitting I had met another " Ada." This
meeting had not, so far as I can remember, recalled the
former " Ada " to my mind. They were neither of them
of any interest to me. But the necessary, or helpful,
link with the past would seem to have been, on one
side, established. The other, if other there were, is not
known.
It is, perhaps, possible that the curious way in which
past events are sometimes identified by unexpected names
may be due to something of this sort. My communicator
was once trying to remind me of a time in our past
lives, when we frequently had to post what we then
thought to be important letters. She led me to identi-
fication of the place by giving the surname—an unusual
one—of the vicar of a neighbouring parish to the one in
which we were working. True we lived in that parish,
but we had practically nothing to do with that vicar.
The result was successful. I, at once, recalled the events
of which she was trying to remind me, but the method
she had used puzzled me greatly at the time. It would
have seemed to be so much more sensible to have given
the name of my own vicar, or of the city in which we
then had lived.
562 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part

The personal likings, and dislikings, of the mediums
themselves—the things too that they are most interested
in—would seem to be factors in assisting communication
about certa'in subjects. For instance—my wife came of a
family devoted to music. She was accustomed as a
child to play in a small orchestra composed mainly of
members of her own family. Later, she became a quite
brilliant musician, played the violin and piano unusually
well, and sang songs to her own accompaniment. She
was always devoted to music ;
yet, at many sittings with
Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Brittain, music was hardly
mentioned except in a few casual remarks about her
songs, etc. On going to Mr. Vango, however, for three
sittings, the subject of music was brought up as being
important to her. On July 28, 1922, " Sunflower " (Mr.
Vango's Control) said :
She was particularly fond of music. . . She was a musician,
she played. I don't mean to say she was a professional
musician, but she did something with it. She did some-
thing with her music. I don't see her taking money
—
not sure : she brought music to the front—not only played
in her drawing-room at home. She sang sometimes . . .
And on November 17, 1922, " Sunflower " said :
She has a beautiful voice. She sat down, and played
her accompaniments. She's sitting at the piano now,
and playing, and turning round to you, and smiling.
She has a meaning in that. I can't get any particular
air, but she's trying to convey to me something special.
She wouldn't always sing religious airs, would she ?
She sang the airs of the day as at an ordinary concert.
After one of these sittings, the subject of music was
brought up by Mr. Vango, and he told me that he was
very fond of music, and that he, and I think he said his
sons, formed a little family orchestra, and often played
together. I had another illustration of the same sort of
thing—nnitual interests of medium and communicator,
103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 563
apparently furthering easy communication on a particular
subject, at sittings with Mr. Vout Peters. In this case
the subject was a very different one. My wife, as the
wife of a parish clergyman had, of necessity, much
parochial work to do, and many diiSculties to en-
counter. The position of a clergyman's wife—especially
when the clergyman is an assistant curate—is seldom
easy. She has no official position, yet much is expected
of her, and great tact is often required if troubles are
to be avoided. Little was said of past vicars, or parishes,
or parish worries, however, at my sittings, until I went to
Mr. Vout Peters. Mr. Peters, though not, I think, a
member of the Church of England, is interested in religion
generally ;
reHgious matters are much in his mind. This
would seem to have facihtated veridical taUi on such
subjects, and many little tilings from the past have been
recalled through this medium, vicars described and
criticised, housing difficulties recalled, former hopes and
ambitions spoken of, and in a markedly more realistic
way than the way in which this one subject has been
dealt with through others.
(4)
When giving book-tests, my communicator has stated
at times, through Feda, that certain places are good to
get tests from. For instance, with regard to the house
of "Mr. Y" at Hampstead {Proc. Vol. XXXVL, Part
99, pages 239-250), Feda said, on September 21, 1925 :
It was a good place to get tests from . . . This house
has quite a good condition for her, though, at any time,
and she thought perhaps you had wondered why she didn't
go back there more often instead of choosing other places
which she hears you groaning and grumbling at inwardly.
On January 26, 1926,^ Feda said, of a room in this
house :
Its got a kind feeling, like a nice—you know—like a
room that's lUie a nice fat kind aunt. (Aunt ?) Yes.
igee also S.P.R. Jour., Vol. XXIV., p. 4.
2 o
564 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part
" Well," Dora says, " It's got a lived in feeling, a homely
feeling." . . . She says it has given her a good condition
before when she's tried. Mr. Bill ! She says it isn't the
rooms themselves, you know, its the people who've had
the rooms, that make it easy, or difficult for her.
With this thought in mind, I have studied my book-
tests to see if certain places do seem to be better than
others with regard to obtaining successful tests, and I
find that there is ample evidence of the correctness of
the statement. From some houses the book-tests are
nearly always successful, from others nearly always
failures, or so confused as to be useless for evidence.
With regard to the reason for this, I have no suggestion
to make. I am hoping that someone else may be able
to find a clue. My best series of book-tests have been
taken from the house just mentioned. The people are
not Spiritualists, and were but mildly interested in the
subject of Psychical Research when I tried to tell them
something about it. I knew little of the house—had only
once been to it when the first series of tests was given,
and Mr. and Mrs. Y. do not know Mrs. Leonard. They
were, however, very fond of my wife in life. My next
best series of book-tests—with perhaps one exception from
my own house—have been from a house into which I
have never entered. The verification was kindly done
for me by an " S.P.R." official. I have only met the
lady who b'ves in this house once or twice ;
but, in this
case I understand that she has herself had a few " Leonard "
sittings. My communicator claims to have met her hus-
band, who has passed from this life, and to have gone
with him to get the tests. Other book-tests of mine,
from a house which at the time I knew fairly well, and
whose occupant was a regular sitter with Mrs. Leonard,
were mainly failures. The average at my own vicarage
is pretty good, but not so good as at the two houses
mentioned above, I think.
There is one more statement of my communicator that
I should like to quote, this being with regard to a diffi-
culty that she says she finds in giving " Impression "
103] • More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 565
tests ;
though, if correct, it must, I think, apply equally
to book-tests. At a sitting with Mrs. Leonard on
January 26, 1926, she said, tlirough Feda :
" You know I sometimes think there are more important
thiags than I tell you, that are happening in the places
where I go, but I have to tell you not only what I've
picked up at the time, but what I can re-remember, re-
remember." There ain't such a word, Dora !
" Yes ! I
call it that because it explams what I mean. What I
remember when I come here again." She says, " I have
to remember the information in my own condition, my
own condition. Then, I have to re-remember it in this
condition again," she says, " and that's where the difficulty
is," she says. " Not at the picking it ujd—not in the
knowing it in my own condition—but in bringing it through
again into your condition, and all our difficulties consist
in that one operation."
To test the truth of this is not easy, but I have found
two rather good instances, in my book-tests, of what look
like mistakes of tliis kind, mistakes due to failure of
memory. In the one case tests were given from two
different pages of a book which was said to be the fifth
book from the left on a certain shelf : they were fairly
definite tests, but appropriate sentences were found not
in that book, but in a book which was the fifth book
from the right.—One of these, however, was on the back
of the page. In the other case a very definite test was
given from the sixth book from the left in a certain
sheK, and it was said also, " Is there anything looking-
like a bird near to these books ? I wonder why she
keep showing me a picture of a Httle bird.—It's something
I think you'll notice v/hile you're picking out these books.
The idea of a bird awful strongly."
There was nothing appropriate on the test page from
the sixth book from the left, on the shelf indicated
—
but there was on the sixth book from the left in the shelf
above, from which shelf a book-test had been given a feiv
moments before ;
and, in addition to this, on the back of
the cover of the eleventh book from the left, on this
566 Rev. W. S. Irving [part
higher shelf, was a Httle bird in gilt, just over half an
inch in size from tip of beak to end of tail. Assuming
that these were the tests intended, the mistakes would
seem to be due to lapse of memory on the part of the
communicator.
(5)
One of the most interesting problems that confronts
us in connection with book-tests is the answer to the
question " When are they taken ?
" The communicators
generally claim that they are prepared beforehand—some-
times a considerable time before the sitting at which
they are given ; but the communicators are, by the
circumstances of the case, unable to prove their point ; and
one has often had an luicomfortable feeling, while taking
down a book-test, that the medium may really be reading
off the tests by direct clairvoyance as she gives them.
In three of my comparatively recent sittings, however,
there has been evidence that seems to corroborate the
statements of the communicators, and also to show know-
ledge of the surroundings of the books referred to at two
different periods.
On April 22, 1926, at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard, Dr.
Woolley recording, an Institution was described which it
was said I should shortly visit. This I identified as the
Gloucester Infirmary. My wife was in her life interested
in hospitals, and collected locally for the " Gloucester
Royal Infirmary League."
Feda then began a book-test which she said was from
my home in a room I am often in. "There are some
books but I don't feel many . . . the one complete
row . . . little bit higher than back of your chair." She
could not say whether it was a shelf, or the top of
something the books have been put on ... " something
you can open and shixt near them—pull something in and
out . . . not all the same size, and they don't quite
match each other."
The description reminded me of books on the chest of
drawers in my bedroom ; and the identification was sup-
ported by Feda's later remarks about " renewing wood,"
103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 567
and my " looking at the floor " neiu' there. I now quote
the full script :
Feda. Mr. Bill, you've altered them somehow. They
don't feel to her m the same order they were in
before. And, Mr. Bill, do you know if somebody's took
some, and put them this way. [Feda illustrates hori-
zontally.] Instead of straight up has someone put them
lying on each other, because, she says, at the end she had
some difficulty in being sure how she should count. (It's
not the place, Feda.) And, she says, she felt that
either someone had put them that way, or that they had
slipped, but there's something that makes them very much
out of their regular order—not standing up quite straight.
It didn't matter very much, Mr. BiU, because she's been
able to count, and she was careful not to take the first
two. You'U see why dhectly you look at them again. . .
Now the book she want you to take first is the fourth
book from the left. Open it the very beginning, and
you'll see there a description of, or aUusion to, a place
which taUies, taUies, taUies, with what she said about the
Institution at the beginmng of the sitting. Renewmg
wood, renewing wood. You've said something about
renewhig wood, renewing wood, just here. (Yes. I
have.) Wait a minute ! What have you been looking
at the floor for 1 Dora couldn't see what you were
doing, but do you remember looking at the floor, or
something very low down at the floor ? (Yes.) 'Cos
that's what she felt you were doing. . . .
On my return from London, on Saturday, April 24,
1926—two days before my visit to the Royal Infirmary
—
I, at once, asked my house-keeper to go with me to my
bedroom to witness the position of certain books on the
chest of drawers in that room. This she did. I found
the books, just as I had left them, all standing upright.
On asking Mrs. Jones if she had moved any of the books
durmg my absence, she said " No "
—but on Tuesday,
April 20, the day after I left home, she had cleaned out
the room, and soon after she began to do so the books
at the left-hand end had slipped down on top of each oth^r.
568 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part
She said that as I had told her on no account to move
any books during my absence, she had left them as they
were all the morning, while she had lunch, and till she
had finished the room in the afternoon, when she had
jiushed them ixp again into their original upright position.
Mrs. Jones is very vague about time, but, so far as I
can gather, the books were down from about 9.30 a.m.
till between 3.0 omcI 4 _p.m. on the same day.
On that day I had had another sitting with Mrs. Leonard
in the afternoon.
In the centre of the chest of drawers is a work-basket
of my wife's. To the left of this are the four books
which slipped down. To the right of the work-basket are
seven books. The fourth of these seven books, counting
from the left, was Dear Enemy, by Jean Webster (Hodder
& Stoughton). This was another of my wife's books,
and, I think, rather a favourite of hers. I read it about
seven years ago, and also most of the other books here.
In the early pages of this book a description of an Insti-
tution is given corresponding at various points with the
general appearance of the Gloucester Infirmary, to which
allusion had apparently been made earlier in the sitting.
The last point about " renewing wood " is quite clear.
Shortly before leaving home, I found that wood-worms
had got into a clothes-basket, which stands in a dressing-
room, five feet to the left of the chest of drawers. I
examined the floor and thought I found traces of them
burrowing into the jd^^^^^^^s beneath the clothes-basket.
I spoke to my house-keeper about this, and she took the
matter in hand while I was in town. I have, before,
had similar trouble in the boards in the passage, and a
vague reference was, I think, made to it through Mi-s.
W. Elliott in November, 1925. At my request, a neigh-
bouring vicar—Rev. W. T. Shaddock, Rector of Preston
—
came to my house on May 3, and questioned my house-
keeper about the books that slipped. His certificate,
showing the correctness of the details I have given about
this, is in the hands of the Editor of Proceedings.
My second case of a book-test containing evidence as
to when it was taken occiirred at a sitting with Mrs.
103] ilfore Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 569
Leonard on September 20, 1926. The tests from the
book I need not give as, although appropriate sentences
were found in the places indicated, they were not especi-
ally striking. For the sake of brevity, I am also cutting
out all material that is not essential to the understanding
of the case.
Feda. Mr. Bill has got a book not on a sheK at all ?
Oh dear ! Where has he got it ! . . . She keep on
saymg " New book, new book." Then " not read properly
yet." She says ..." I don't know whether you've read
any of it . . . but it's a book that's in your possession,
and you may know something, or have read something
of it. I don't think you've read much, and you may
have read nothmg, but I want to show you I Imow
something about it." . . . (Where is the book ? ) Not in
any shelves at home. She feels it's chfferent—by itself.
Has it been taken away from others, and been put by
itself ? . . . It's been carried recently, she says, like lifting m
the hand ... I don't thmk she knows where it is this
minute, but you're gomg to get hold of it, and read it
soon. " In a sense," she says, " I've got to say its yours
now, though I don't thinli you've read it," she says.
Not near other books, and / don't think she knows the
spot it's in at the minute. (That's hvely !) . . . He [the
sitter] says it's very hvely ! You're going to hold this
book in your hand, she is putting it in your hand, as if
it will be put in your hands at once. (Can you answer a
question ? Is it the Library book at home I haven't
read, or is it the Library book I've taken out to-day ?) . . .
It's the first one—not the second—it is the first . . .
This book is given as a " new book " that had " been
taken away from others," and " been put by itself." I
had bought no new books of late, but on—I think
—
Wednesday, September 1, that is four or five days before
leaving home for my summer hohday, wlhch I was still
enjoying—I had changed my Library books at " Boots
"
in Gloucester, and brought home two books. They were
both " A " Class—that is newly published books. One of
these I had read before leaving home—the other I had
570 Rev. W. 8. Irving [part
not. This latter book seemed to be indicated. It was
Tlie Secret of the Ashes by Alfred Ornstien (Hutchinson &
Co., Ltd.). I may have opened the book and read a page
or so—not more. I am not sure of tliis. When I read
the book after my return from London nothing seemed
familiar except the name " Malcolm " on page one. This
book I lent to a friend—I think the day after I got it.
Thursday, September 2. He returned it on Sunday
night, September 5, while I was preparing for my early
departure next morning. The book was probably put
on a table in my dining-room then.
On my return home on September 25th, I looked for
the book, and could not find it. On asldng my house-
keeper if she had seen it, she said that on Tviesday,
September 7—the day after my departure—the friend
mentioned above had called to make some repairs to my
wireless set that he had promised to make, and had gone
off with two books. She did not know what they were.
I went across to his house, therefore, and- asked if he
had borrowed a Library book of mine, and he replied
that while looking at my wireless set he had seen this
book near it which he had returned before, and had taken
it for his wife to finish. He had only taken one book,
and he gave it back to me then.
If I interpret the evidence rightly, the communicator
took the test wliile the book was in my house before I
left home—that is at least fourteen days before the
sitting. She went back to refresh her memory by
verifying it before the sitting, as she would seem to have
also done with the former test, and found that the book
was gone.
My last case, of the same kind, was given at a sitting
with Mrs. Leonard, three days later, on Sej)tember 23,
1926. The tests were from books on the chest of drawers in
my bedroom again. After describing the place Feda said :
She doesn't suppose that you would have such a
thing on the shelf, couldn't have, and yet it was while
she was standing by it that she felt it, Mr. Bill, very
strongly—A bowl, bowl, bowl. . . . She didn't see it, Mr.
Bill, but she got the idea " bowl " strongly. She thinks
103] More Thoughts on Trance Phenomena 571
that you'll see what she means directly you look at it
—
bowl, bowl.
Feda then gave the tests.
At the time of the sitting I could think of nothing
like a bowl that would be likely to be near the chest
of drawers. On questioning my house-keeper, however,
she said that after I had left home she found that I
had left a large brealtfast-cup full of water on the dressing
table which is just over a foot to the right of the chest
of drawers. It was, probably, where she found it from
late on Sunday evening, September 5, or early on
Monday morning, September 6, till about 11.30 a.m. of
the latter day. The weak point, in this test, as fixing
the time when this book-test was taken, is, of course,
that the presence of the breakfast-cup must, presumably,
have been known to my subconscious mind—which may
have influenced the sitting. On the other hand, it falls
in line with the other two tests, and may well be from
the same source.
• (6)
The question of the influence, on sittings, exercised by
the note-taker should be worth studying. Frequent
change of note-takers is detrimental to any series of
sittings—but that is obvious. What is less easy to learn
is the kind of note-taker with whom the best results
may be obtained. For a suggestion as to this I am
indebted to Mrs. Leonard. I had written to her in
September, 1924, with regard to my next sitting, and said
that I was bringing my usual note-ttiker Mrs. Leonard,
in reply, said, " Am so glad you will be able to bring . . .
on Nov. 19. She brings a good condition. People who
have the gift of accuracy are always helpful in a
sitting. I would rather have a sceptical accurately-
minded sitter than a careless-minded one who was credu-
lous. The first would be the easier. That's why most
of the S.P.R. people are such good sitters, I suppose."
I have obtained Mrs. Leonard's permission to quote the
above. With this in mind, I have examined my past
572 Rev. W. 8. Irving—Trance Phenomena [part
" Leonard " sittings. A large number of these have been
recorded by Mrs. Dingwall who has most kindly given
much time to helping me in this way ;
but, at one time
and another, nine people have taken notes for me at
these sittings. I find that Mrs. Leonard's suggestion
seems to be justified by a study of the Scripts—so far
as they go. The sittings recorded by Mrs. Dingwall,
Dr. Woolley (who has recently helped me in this way at
two sittings) and Mrs. Savy (one) show a higher percent-
age of accuracy in tests—so far as I can gather—than
do most of the others. Mrs. Savy is foreign corre-
spondent and tyjiist to a member of a City firm, and is
certainly gifted with accuracy ; she is not a spiritualist.
With regard to sittings with other mediums, it does not
seem possible to come to any definite decision, as to the
influence exercised on them by the note-taker, as the
quality of the sittings is more variable. According to
Feda, it is not wise to act as note-taker, if one wishes
to have good sittings oneself. This belief of hers is not
easy to test, but it is, I think, worth noting. At a
sitting of mine on January 25, 1927, Feda remarked :
I don't get such good sittings for people who are note-
takers. I do for a time, and then something wears out
—
like boots. . . . It's something in her brain—in Gladys' brain.
Something, you know, that I can't quite separate ; and
when I get back to a note-taker, I get something in her
brain that keeps jumping over—back to the sitting that
he used to take notes for . . . She wouldn't beheve it
made any difference for a long time ;
but, Mr. Bill, using
anyone's brain for a long time is like a bicycle—you've
got to steer him. It's just as if it's fastened to something
to do with the sitting, and it gets pulled over the wrong
way.

REVIEW.
The Case of Patience Worth : A Critical Study of Certain Unusual
Phenomena. By Walter Franklin Prince. Boston Society
for Psychic Research. Boston, 1927. Tp. 509.
To students of Psychical Research the case of " Patience Worth "
will not be entirely unfamiliar. The first accounts of it, by
Mr. C. S. Yost, a St. Louis journalist, appeared in Mr. Henry
Holt's Unpojmlar Review so far back as 1915, and in 1916
appeared his Patience Worth : a Psychic Mystery, while a number
of her tales and selections from her poems have also been
published by the Patience Worth Publishing Co. and in the
Patience Worth Magazine, which existed for a time. But Dr.
Walter Prince has j^roduced the first comprehensive study by an
expert hand of what is certainly one of the most remarkable and
interesting cases of automatic writing hitherto recorded.
The story runs as follows. In the summer of 1913 Mrs. Pearl
Lenore Curran was induced by her friend Mrs. Hutchings to join
her in experimenting with a ouija board, and almost at once
communications came from " Patience Worth," who professed to
have been an English girl, born in Dorset and killed by Indians
in America in 1694 (or 1649), and who wrote in an archaic and
very distinctive and pungent English style, utterly different from
the colloquial American of the Middle West, which was, it seems,
the only language normally known to Mrs. Curran. For Mrs.
Curran had left school at the age of fourteen, and never studied
or manifested any interest or aptitude for literature. " Patience,"
on the other hand, could write in a variety of styles, poetic,
aphoristic, rustic, narrative, ancient and modern, without giving
herself away in any glaring way, and while always giving the
impression of a very vivid personality. She imj^rovises poems on
any suggested subject on request, and dictates her tales as fast
as they can be recorded. Her original mode of communication
through a ouija board has long been discarded, and her messages
574 Review [part
are now spoken by Mrs. Ciirran, who simultaneously sees pictorial
imagery representing their contents. It is, however, admitted that
this method sometimes leads to interference by Mrs. Curran's
consciousness with the automatisms.
There is nothing then in their mode of production that renders
the " Patience Worth " messages remarkable. Their claims rest
entirely on their contents, which seem very definitely to transcend
the powers of Mrs. Curran's mind. That this is really the case
Dr. Prince seems, pretty completely, to establish, by printing an
autobiography and a paper by Mrs. Curran, and by the testimonies
of a number of witnesses who knew her before she became an
automatist. He also cross-examined her as to her general and
historical knowledge, and found depths of ignorance compatible
enough with her education, but not with the extensive and peculiar
knowledge displayed in " Patience's " historical romances. For ex-
ample, she supposed that Henry VIII. had had his head cut off (as no
doubt he deserved), thought that Daniel Webster " made the dic-
tionary," knew nothing about Andrew Jackson, and did not think
she had ever read a chapter of the Bible through (p. 18). Her own
life, moreover, had been confined to the Middle West. She had never
seen the sea, and had never been east or north of Chicago nor
west or south of Fort Worth, Texas, when " Patience Worth
"
arrived.
In sj)ite of these limitations she has somehow contrived to
produce a literary output estimated at 3,000,000 words, which,
though varying with the subject, was all written in unexceptionable
English English, and carried through consistently. It is certainly
impressive to be told (pp. 359-60) that one of her tales, Telka,
extending to 60-70,000 words, exhibits a vocabulary "as to 90 per
cent, of Anglo-Saxon origin," and contains " no word of later entry
into the language than 1600," except " amuck " (which is first
recorded in the second half of the seventeenth century), and no
word wrongly formed among those which are not on record.
When we are told further that the Authorized Version has only
77 per cent, of Anglo-Saxon, and that it is necessary to go back
to Layamou (1205) to equal Patience Worth's percentage, we
realize that we are face to face with what may fairly be called a
philological miracle.
The literary value of Patience Worth's writings is not so
susceptible of exact calculation, and opinions are more likely
to differ ;
still, not only Dr. Prince but other good judges
103] Review 575
have not hesitated to use the word " genius " in describing-
it. I am not sure that I should like to go so far ; but what
writer need be ashamed of bits of proverbial philosophy Hke
" beat the hound and lose the hare," " it taketh a wise man
to be a good fool," " a basting but toughens an old goose,"
" nimble words are not nimble wits," " wisdom patches the seat
of learning," and " give me not wisdom enough to understand the
universe but folly enough to tolerate it " ?
Such being the problem presented by the case of " Patience
Worth," what shall be said of its solution 1 There are obviously
three hypotheses to be considered, in the way of each of which
the case puts specific obstacles. (1) The spirit-possession theory is
undoubtedly the one most immediately suggested ;
but even those
most free from prejudice against it may well feel that this case
goes considerably further than any that has so far been recorded,
and seems too good to be true. Never before has a " spirit
"
found such complete and unobstructed expression through a
" medium "
; never before has a " spirit " given such convincing
proofs of the reality of progress in the spirit-world, as those
which have turned " Patience Worth " from an illiterate servant
girl of the seventeenth century into the literary character of the
twentieth. If she is indeed a spirit she must be congratulated
on her success in surmounting difficulties which have baffled many
more pretentious communicators.
(2) The next alternative is to credit " Patience Worth " to the
subconsciousness of Mrs. Curran, and to regard her as a secondary
personality, in spite of the present lack of direct evidence in
support of this attribution. This hypothesis would not seem quite
so fantastic if psychologists had been more careful to record and
emphasize the intellectual performances of which the subconscious
appears to be capable. It may be objected that "Patience
Worth " goes definitely beyond anything on record ;
still, the
composition of Kubla Khan and Jehyll and Hyde, and the dis-
covery of " Verner's Law," were no mean achievements. And on
the principle of omne ignotum pro magnifico it may be possible so
to extend the powers of the unconscious as to cover the case of
"Patience Worth."
(3) Once started on the path of hypothetical extensions of per-
sonality some philosophers are loth to stop till they have reached
the Absolute. We must, therefore, be prepared for suggestions
that the
" Patience Worth " literature is an authentic revelation
576 Review [PAET 103]
of the Absolute, or perhaps has somehow trickled through from
some " cosmic reservoir " which has pooled the literary efforts of
the ages. In its second form this theory manifestly overlooks
the problem of selection ; in its first, it involves the further
difficulty that " Patience Worth " is a revelation of a very much more
humorous Absolute than its philosophers have ever led us to
expect. If the reply to this be that all finite personality must
in any case be a selection from the Absolute, we must retort
that it proves too much, and that if " Patience Worth " be a
selection from the Absolute, so is every one else, and that there-
fore, so far as this argument goes, she is as good a " spirit " as
any!
What, then, shall we do ? I suppose that at present it is still
safer to credit " Patience Worth " to the unconscious and to
class her, officially, as Mrs. Curran's " secondary self." But it is
impossible to be comfortable about this theory, and it should
certainly not be held fanatically. And, personally, I am quite
willing to subscribe to Dr. Prince's conclusion that " either our
concept of what we call the subconscious must he radically altered,
so as to include potencies of which we hitherto have had no know-
ledge, or else some cause operating through but not originating in the
subconsciousness of Mrs. Curran must be acknowledged." The general
impression of the case on my mind is to deepen the conviction
that orthodox psychology and orthodox j)hilosophy are both very
far from having plumbed the depths of the soul, and, that it is
unreasonable to require an open-minded man to endorse their
prejudices. F. C. S. Schiller.
