  		Experience Description 8493:   

  I was riding my Harley motorcycle home from work about 9:00 pm. The drive belt broke, so  I had to stop.  I was very angry  and was going to call my girlfriend to bring me a new belt and some tools so I could fix it. I never got to make the call. 

  I was immediately confronted by 6 Hispanic males who watched my Harley  coast to a stop. They came out to the street aggressively as they approached  me. One male had a baseball bat. I was in the wrong place and was about to fight for my life. They shouted at me, 'You are gonna die gringo' and I had to fight. I had no weapons except  my fists. They encircled me in the street and started  punching me and hitting me with the baseball bat. I was trying to pay the most attention to the guy with the baseball bat. All of a sudden,  I felt a stabbing pain in my abdomen. One of the attackers had a knife. When I was stabbed, I also was hit in the head with the baseball bat and was out like a light. 

  The next thing I knew, I was standing on a beach in the republic of Panama.  I used to go snorkeling there when I was in the Army. It looked very different but I knew where I was. It was very strange and VERY real. I didn't understand why I was there and knew I was getting the sh#@ kicked out of me whereever my body was back in Arizona. 

   The trees in the background looked VERY old, like the old trees that are over 1000 years old. There was a little girl standing in front of me with a grin on her face as she was looking at me. She had on blue clam-digger shorts and a white sleeveless, v-cut T-shirt. She  was barefoot. As she stood smiling at me, I noticed that  she had the greenest eyes I have ever seen, like fire-green. It was  mid-day. The ocean,  sun,  birds, and the wind were so totally real that it was  very confusing. Why  was I there? 

   I finally said to the little 12 or 13 year-old girl, 'HEY, I'm getting the sh#@ kicked out of me. I got to go!' and I started to walk away. Where I was going to go, I had no idea. But I had to go some place where I was in trouble. As I started to walk towards the jungle just off the beach, the little girl said to me, 'BRIAN, please stay here with me because if you go back you are going to see and feel things you don't wanna see or feel.' I stopped, turned around, and said, 'Who are you?' She answered, 'I am your  guardian angel. Please stay here. Come sit down we have much to talk about.' There was a drift-log off to my left and we sat down. 
  
  I asked, 'Where am I?' 

 She said, 'Heaven. Well, your version of it. I knew you loved this place so we came here.'

  'Am I dead,' I asked. 

 She said, 'Yes you are, but you can't stay here. You got to go back.' 

   When she said that, I could hear people talking in the jungle and I knew who they were. One was a friend I knew in highschool who had died in a car wreck. Another was my older brother, who I never met. I could not see them very well but could hear them talking with others in the jungle. 

  I asked, 'Why can't I stay? It's beautiful here.' 

  She said, 'It's not your time. You have much to do.' 

I asked, What?' 

  She laughed and said, 'Now, if I tell you, it won't be as much fun now. Will it? You get to stay here for awhile but you got to go back and when its time to go I will let you know.'

   All of a sudden it was night. She was standing back in front of me and said, 'Time for you to go back.' 

  BAM, I was back in my body in the emergency room at county hospital. The pain was unbearable! My whole family was there. Everyone was crying and avoided looking at me. The emergency room nurse said, 'Welcome back Mr....You were  stabbed 27 times, mostly in my abdomen.' My neck was slit. They had no idea how I was still alive and didn't bleed to death. BUT I was alive and I didn't die. Well yes, I did die, but got to come back. They told me my body was thrown into a dumpster  for 9 hours. The next morning, a lady who was walking her dog saw the blood trail to the dumpster and found me.  

 This is the first time I have told my story. I just didn't want to tell it because I think people will not believe me.

Experience Description 2663:   

  					  I was drunk and in a black out. I drove my car to the drug house to get some crack. I remember getting out of the car and asking a Hispanic man for rock/crack. The next thing that happened I was punched from behind in the nose. I hit the dirt. I always carried a buck knife and he took it from me. That's all I can remember about the assault.

The next thing that happened, all of a sudden I was on a beach sitting on a drift log with a little girl that was about fifteen to sixteen years old. She was wearing dark blue shorts and a white sleeveless shirt. She was tan, green eyes, brown curly hair, and a killer smile. I was looking at her; she was looking at me smiling. This was as real as anything you can think of. I could smell the salt air; feel the sun on my skin, wind in my hair. For some reason I knew I was getting the s*&$ kicked out of me so, I got up from the drift log, I was sitting on. I started to walk away from the girl that was sitting next to me thinking that I had to try to find myself because I was getting the s*&$ kicked out of me. As I walked away, the girl yelled out to me, 'Brian! If you leave now you're going to see and feel things you really don't want to see and feel!' I stopped walking but did not turn around. Then she said in a nice voice, 'You need to stay here with me and when it's time to go I will let you know.' I turned around, walked back to the drift log, and sat down next to the girl again. She just looked at me, smiled, and held my hand. The next thing that happened it was night time, the girl was standing, I was standing, looking at each other and she said, 'Brian it's time for you to go.'

The next thing that happened I was in the emergency room lying on a bed with my entire family standing around me. I asked, 'Where am I?' My sister said that I was in the hospital, I had been stabbed twenty-seven times and my neck slashed three times and that they don't know how or why I'm still alive! Some lady walking her dog at 6:00 am found me lying behind a dumpster in a pool of blood! That means I was stabbed twenty-seven times about 9:00 pm and was not found until 6:00 am the next day! That's 9 hours! When the emergency medical technicians found me they said I had hardly had a pulse but that I snapped to, told them my name and my mom's phone number, and then passed out. The doctor told me that I had no blood in my body and that he doesn't know how I survived all that time and that I should be dead! They don't know how something like this didn't kill me. I feel totally blessed that I'm here. I have no fear to die now because I know where I'm going. Also, I'm left with a feeling that everyone that has ever been is there and that everyone that will ever be gets to go too. I love you all, Brian.
