I joined the Navy in April of 1969 I
went to radio attended radio a school in
Bainbridge Maryland then I reported to
the USS John F Kennedy which was CBA 67
at the time which was already on
deployment to the Mediterranean I caught
up with it there worked in the
communications section for a few years
and then I moved to the navigational
section of the Kennedy where I was
working with the quartermaster&#39;s I had
administrative work for the navigator
after that I was transferred to
Commander Fighter Wing one at naval air
station oceana virginia beach virginia
79 I applied for a job at the National
Security Agency as a security guard and
was hired in 1980 did that job for three
years and then I moved to the electrical
division under the General Services
Administration at Fort Meade Maryland
in 1986 I became they did away with all
the GSA services so I became an actual
NSA employee in 1986 and worked in the
facilities section at NSA until my
termination
13th 1997
the incident occurred on the USS John F
Kennedy I&#39;m not sure the exact date it
was in the summer of 1971
more than likely was June or end of June
or first part of July at the time of the
incident I was working in the
communications section of the Kennedy my
job was a broadcast operator which meant
that I retrieved messages from a series
of teletypes that received fleet
broadcasts to the fleet from the
communication stations or in the
Atlantic we were in the southern
Atlantic we had been performing a
operational readiness exercise in and
around Cuba and in the Caribbean Sea in
preparation well there were games that
they you know all the military do these
exercises from time to time to keep
proficiency up we had just completed
completed this exercise and we were
getting ready to head back to Norfolk
and we the evening that the incident
occurred they had just finished a long
flight outs in excess of 18 hours so
most of the crew had just gone below
decks
after a rather long flight ops and they
were pretty tired so they went below I
was on duty in the communications room
and the teletypes were of course they
were equipped crypto the all the
communications came through
cryptographic equipment which was very
susceptible to interference from time to
time so I kept a close watch one of the
incoming messages and I noticed any
abnormalities I would call facilities
control and have them adjust the
receivers to keep the signals clear this
particular night I took a message off
the teletype and filed it because it was
not to us and I turned around to check
the teletypes again and saw something I
had never seen before
all eight teletypes were just typing
complete garbage totally incoherent I
had never I had seen one or two you know
mistakes and the message but never named
this extensive so I immediately called
the facilities control on the intercom
to inform them that my broadcast route
and they informed me that they were busy
because all communications had just gone
out a few seconds later we heard we had
a intercom and a pneumatic tube system
that went between the communications
room to the signal bridge which was
located on the very top of the island
structure the carrier and we heard a
voice come on very excited say yelling
that God was here it was the end of the
world and we looked at each other and
thought well that&#39;s strange what&#39;s going
on there another few seconds went by and
another voice came one more controlled
this person said that there&#39;s a there&#39;s
something over the ship what he said
there&#39;s something over this ship well I
looked at a friend of mine shipmate and
he looked at me and we decided to go
have a look which was really breaking
the rules we weren&#39;t supposed to leave
the common area and don&#39;t watch but
nothing was working anyway so we figured
being young and so we exited the
communication center and went to the
catwalk on the port side of the ship on
the flight deck edge of the flight deck
and we observed a large glowing sphere
over the island structure of the ship
over the ship it was hard to decide what
size this thing was because there was no
perspective it was late in the evening
the Sun had gone down it was Twilight
but it looked huge I would I would say
anywhere from three or four hundred feet
o to a quarter of a mile depending on
how high it was if it was high and it
was huge you know it glowed in a
pulsating matter between a yellowish and
oranges color I couldn&#39;t see any details
other than a glowing spherical object
unfortunately I only got to observe this
object for less than thirty seconds
because by time we got out there
and started looking at it General
Quarters went off on the ship battle
stations we had to go back to our watch
station which was our battle stations we
stayed at General Quarters or battle
stations for about two hours it was only
several minutes after we can&#39;t we got
back to the communications center that
the messages started coming in again
incoming started coming in outgoing was
still out so it wasn&#39;t that long we were
out of communications maybe 20 minutes
at the most we stuck or sigh stayed on
watch until my watch ended which was at
midnight after that I&#39;ve talked to a few
friends to free ship some shipmates that
I had on the ship one in particular
worked in the radar Department and he
was on watch during the incident and he
told me that all the radar screens were
gloving and nothing they could detect
anything when radar and we stayed up
most of the night talking about it a few
friends of mine and we heard stories
about the compass is not working on the
bridge and that the radar navigational
system had gone off line what I was
observing was the underside of possibly
a disc which would cause it to look
spherical from my vantage point I&#39;ve
thought about a lot and that&#39;s that&#39;s a
conclusion I&#39;ve come to I heard from
some people that the first voice on the
intercom be heard yelling saying was the
end of the world was actually a bosun&#39;s
mate look out there was on watch one of
the signal bridge we heard through
stories that this person who had to be
sedated was very upset and we heard that
the second voice that we heard was
actually a signalman there was only on
the signal bridge the the one that said
it was just something over the ship the
more control voice a few days later the
commanding officer and the executive
officer came on the closed-circuit
television system that we had on board
it was any way they could adjust a crew
of 5,000 he looked at the camera and
I&#39;ll never forget this he looked at the
camera he said I would like to remind
the crew that certain events that take
place on board a naval major major naval
combat and bustle are considered
classified and should not be discussed
with anyone
without I need to know unquote that&#39;s
all he said so that the commanding
officer and the executive officer were
pretty upset during the the incident as
they had no control over anything and
they were very vulnerable which I&#39;m sure
was upsetting for any military people
you&#39;re not in control the propulsion
system still worked we could maintain
the speed and course we could steer but
from all the stories that I heard
anything that was electronic in nature
ceased to operate or was malfunctioning
this includes any computer systems it
did at the time have nuclear weapons on
board this was a known fact to us but we
were in the Mediterranean we were not
supposed to talk about it they weren&#39;t
on a deployer carrier anywhere in the
world without nuclear capabilities the
altitude of the object appeared to be
pretty low I did get a message from a
former serviceman u.s. Navy serviceman
that said he was on a destroyer in the
vicinity and that they had tracked an
object on radar and sometime that summer
I also got a message from a man that had
been a sailor on the ship had worked
with the computers and he remembered
somebody getting him up to come and work
on the reboot the computer system and he
had said what happened and they said oh
UFO is over the ship and he laughed it
off thought it was a joke and he just
chalked it up to a computer crash and
rebooted the system and and it didn&#39;t
and not it wasn&#39;t so he read my story
that he remembered that he said well
they weren&#39;t joking but all this time he
thought it was just a joke it was only
actually over the ship for maybe five
minutes or less
however the ramifications of the
disruptions lasted for at least an hour
that&#39;s why we stayed at battle stations
for two hours I guess they were waiting
to see if it came back or and they were
still trying to re start systems and get
things back and fully operational and
took them probably at least an hour and
then there were no aircraft in the air
they were all on board when the incident
started they kept to f4 phantoms which
were called a ready cap combat air
patrol from what I heard they would not
operate they were trying to start those
those Jets and they from what I heard
the rumors and the stories that they
wouldn&#39;t start that they were they were
out of commission no noise from the
object it was quiet on the flight deck
at the time because I said there was no
flying the aircraft running so it was
rather quiet we discern no sound
whatsoever no humming nothing just a
complete silence some men arrived on the
ship when we returned to Norfolk to
interview some people in suits lord
knows where they came from what agency
they were from but I had heard I because
I wasn&#39;t a legitimate observer I wasn&#39;t
even supposed to be out there I guess
nobody really even knew I saw it but I&#39;m
sure I the rumor I heard that all the
bridge crew people that were on the
bridge were interviewed by these
gentlemen in suits and some people in
some operational areas radar and we had
an organization on the ship called I oh
I see and it was
integrated operations intelligence
communication is something that I think
I remember the exact remember I remember
the exact meaning and I&#39;m sure I had
heard that they were out taking pictures
of this thing I&#39;m convinced that there&#39;s
something to it I&#39;m convinced that the
government somebody in the government
knows a lot more than we know I have my
own theories of why it&#39;s being hidden
I think there&#39;s I think it&#39;s the reason
that the information is being kept from
the public is there are many reasons not
just one particular reason they probably
feel that the general public couldn&#39;t
handle the knowledge of
extraterrestrials visiting I think that
they have information that would
seriously undermine the economy of the
country I think there&#39;s devices that
they have that they could produce energy
at very low cost and with no pollution
but the corporator corporate greed would
prohibit that and that&#39;s the that would
be the part that would bother me most
about the cover-up I think of all the
pollution there is and all that could
have been saved that would bother me
more anything and also I think any time
the military discovers something like
this they want to keep it quiet because
they don&#39;t know who knows about it and
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a paranoia paranoia in
that military I&#39;ve seen it it&#39;s
definitely time to make this disclosure
on this it&#39;s been kept secret too long I
think we have a right to know what what
we have to face be it asteroid heading
for Earth or an extraterrestrial visitor
I think as human beings we have the
right to know our future may bring
it&#39;s a god-given right
this thing was moving 1015 miles in 30
seconds 20 miles then 30 miles then 40
miles than 100 miles and in virtually
three and a half minutes this thing move
in almost 500 miles at and then moving
from one altitude to another that would
cause any normal pilot to black outlets
it was very strange
