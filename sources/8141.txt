We had been hunting deer for five days camping out in the woods. I was pretty tired as it was physically hard. I felt light headed and decided I should get up and go to the men's room to throw some water on my face. As I walked towards the rest room, I started to get dizzy. I must have passed out and the next thing I knew I was out of my body and looking down at everyone standing around me. It took a minute to realize what was going on. Then suddenly I felt a great feeling of peace and I felt I became a part of the whole universe, totally free of worries and care. I wanted to stay there. But something seemed to be pulling me back. It's taken many years to even talk about this.
