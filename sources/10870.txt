  		              		Experience Description   

    I committed suicide Sept 2018. I was dead for a matter of minutes. However, I was brought back. I remember it clearly. I feel mine was different. I felt I was floating in a darkness. I wasn't scared. I had all these feelings like peace, that I was loved I was ok, I was safe. It was warm.  It was all my feelings. I couldn't put together thoughts anymore. But others describe seeing tunnel or light. 
  
Why was mine so different? I also have had paranormal experiences my whole life my mother (now deceased) told me I had a gift. I blocked a lot out from fear. I was tested and never diagnosed with schizophrenia or a disorder causing hallucinations. I also have vivid dreams at times and sleep paralysis. I have all my life. I also believe I have past lives two I can remember.
