  		              		Experience Description   

  My experience happened when I was age 18, during the third surgery for an  intestinal obstruction. 

Suddenly, my body was floating on the ceiling and looking down on my body. I saw two doctors and two nurses operating on me while putting my organs in a large basin.

  I saw my parents crying outside the operating room, but the situation was not scary at all.

  Suddenly, I was flying through a very dark tunnel at a very high speed.  But at the end of the last tunnel, I could see it was very light outside.  I could hear the  sound of hammering through the tunnel.

  I couldn't get out of the tunnel until waking up in the hospital room. I was was sutured without completing the surgery because the pulse was about to break.

  After that, I am healthy without re-surgery.

  The feelings I felt during my death experience were just peaceful, and the memory is still so clear.
