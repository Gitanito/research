She then saw Jesus sitting against an immense tree; He had a beautiful face 'like no other you see on earth', she (Alice) said.  During this experience, Jesus touched her hand and Alice thought, 'I will die because He is taking me with Him'.  Instead, the surgery went well, and Alice told me about this experience a year and a half after her surgery.
