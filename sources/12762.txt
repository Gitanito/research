Prior to the event, I was vomiting blood and was diagnosed with a brain abscess. While in Jose Reyes Hospital, after vomiting blood and suffering from a mild stroke, I left my body. 

I went inside a cave and I saw my ancestors, several of them, they were all seated on the floor. The cave was black, and my ancestors wore full-length white clothing.  They did not speak and stared at me. Then, when my mother shouted 'champorado' in the intensive care unit, I left the cave and my ancestors slowly receded from my view.
