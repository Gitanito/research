  		              		Experience Description   

    In 2007, when I was  9 years old, my older sister accidentally hit me between the eyes. At that moment, I fainted. 

I felt an incredibly warm sensation.  I was  in a comfortable sitting position, in a place I can not describe in words. Although short, I watched something like a movie of all the experiences I had gone  through in my life. I saw the people and faces of people I knew. I happily watched the moving images while receiving an indescribable feeling of warmth and love. For 30 to 40 minutes I looked back in my life.  Then,  as if the lights turned off, I came out of the space I was in.  

When I opened my eyes, my sister and my mother had worried looks on their faces as they were trying to shake me to wake me up. When I regained consciousness, I felt extreme happiness as if I had gone on a journey to a place no one knew about.

 Although it happened 14 years ago, the memories of the experience are still really vivid.
