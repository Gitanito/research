The Poles of the \Vorld are two points exactly
opposite to each othe; in the heavens, one in the
north, the other in the south, the earth being in
the midst, so that it seems to turn about, as if it
were borne up by 'them : wherefor~ by some it is

a line supposed to be drawn from one pole through
the center of the earth to the other,. and the earth
turning thereon, tho' holy writ tells 1..11, " The
Lord hangeth the earth upon noth~:1;;, it being

Ascension is the. rising of any sta:-, or of any part
of the ecliptic above the horizon. Descension is
its going down.
Right ascension of a ;tar, is that part of the equi-
nox that riseth or setteth with a star in a right
.sphere, but in an oblique sphere, it is that part of
the ·equinoctial in degrees, containing between the
first point of Aries, and that place of the equinoc-
tial which passeth by the meridian with the centre
of the star.
Oblique ascension is a part of the equinoctial in
degrees, contained betwixt the beginning of Aries,
and that of the equinox which riseth with any star,
or part of the ecliptic, in an oblique sphere.
Ascentional dilfirence, is the difference benvixt the

The Sp/:ere is a round body representing the
frame ofthe whole world, as the circles of the hea-

their spheres,that is,the circles in which they move.
Ascension is the. rising of any star, or of any part
of the ecliptic above the horizon. Descension is
its going down.
Rgbt armuion y' a star, is that part of the equi-
nox that riseth or setteth with a star in a
right

oblique sphere, itis that part of
the equinoctial in degrees, containin between the
Hrst point of Aries, and that place ofgthe equinoc-

of the star.
Oblique aycemian is a
part ofthe equinoctial in
degrees, contained betwixt the beginning of Aries,
and that of the equinox which riseth with any star,
or
part of the ecliptic, in an oblique sphere.
Arcenfianal dffrencf, is the difference betwixt the
right and oblique ascension, or the number of de-

genious, faithful, hearty, a sure friend and a
gen-
erous, enemy. If the native be a woman, it like-
wise betokens the same ; she shall be industrious,
of an excellent temper ; she shall be envied by her
enemies, but shall overcome them ; she: shall be
married about seventeen, and have many children.
The Sun being in Capricom, shews the native
shall meet with many' afflictions and aclversities,
which he shall sustain with many resolutions : Yet
it always shews him angry and fretful, and one that
keeps bad company. It also makes him merry and
cheerful ; yet he may fall in love to that degree,
that he may be ready to die for his mistress ; but
if the nativity be by night, he shall be inconstant;
it also shews in age he shall be covetuus. He
shall thrive in Navigation, especially in the trade
towards the east, for from thence his fortune shall
arise. If the native be a woman, she will he mo-
dest and bashful, of a fearful disposition, and very
much addicted to travel.
The Sun being in Aquarius, maketh the native
of a
friendly disposition, fearful of waters, and in
danger of receiving prejudice thereby ; he s'1:1llbe
subject to sickness and quartidian agues until about
the fifteenth year of his age, after which he shall
be more fortunate, for by travelling throvigh di-
vers countries, he shall gather riches whiqh with

with sundry losses and affiictions, especially by

for a long time without the enjoyment of her. But
she being dead, his affairs will be more fortunate.
If the native be a woman, she shall be comely of
body, and of a faithful, and constant mind; she
shall be enriched with other men's goods, but her
children shall be a great affiiction to her, and she
shall receive much dam2ge by them. She shall
not attain to any great fortune until the two and

The Sun being in Pisces denotes a man to be
quick, of a valuable and ready tongue, bold and
conceited, but fortunate in finding out hidden trea-
sure ; for this is peculiar to those v.rho are born
when the sun is in Pisces, that they shall find some-
thing unlaoked for, and shall be also enriched with
other men's goods; it also shews them to be mer-
ry and jocose, of a good disposition, and loving
the company of good men; they seldom live very
long, but if they reach to thirty-five years, they
may live to a good old age. They shall neve.r be
very rich except in their ow-n opinions ; t4ey are
always full of uneasy thoughts, and are in,danger

if you would know what planet rules at 7 in the

which shew that Venus rules that hour ; and so of
any other hour in thP day. ·
But I shall now come to speak of the significa-
'icns of the planetary hours of each planet, and
wh:lt it portends to those that are born in them.
The hour of Saturn is strong, and is good to do
all things tl1at requires strength; such as fighting
or bearing burthens, or the like ; but for those
things it is very evil. He that is horn in the
hour of Saturn, is slow, dull and melancholy, of
a dogged temper and disposition, black and swar-

The hour of Jupiter is in all things good, and
den0tes peace, love and concord : he that is born
m the hour of Jupiter, is of a 1 uddy and sandy
ccmplexion, fair hair, well proportioned body, and
0f a lonly countenance, his face rather broad than
long, well spoken and cnurteous, of a very affable
c arriag~,. sober, just and rdigious. The hour of

day, I look for 9, which answers to 7 0'clock at
night, for the natural day consists of 24 hours,
beginning after midnight, so that from l2at noon,
you begin to reckon 13, 14-, 15, &c. you find that
the l9th hour from midnight, answers to 7 o'cloclc
at
night, over against which you will find Q,
which shews that to be the hour of the sun. And
if you would know what planet rules at 7 in the
morning that day, you will End against <2 7,
which shew that Venus rules that hour ; _and so of
any other hour in the day.
But I shall now
come to speak of the significa-
sions of the planetary hours of each planet, and
what it portends to those that are horn in them.
The hour of Saturn is strong, and is good to do
all things that requires strength ; such as
Fighting
or
bearing buzthens, or the like ; but for those
things it is very evil. He that is born in the
hour of Saturn, is slow, dull :md melancholy, of
a
dogfgcd temper and disposition, black and swar-
thy o
complexion, being quarrelsome, wrathful,
and very malicious.
The hour of Jupiter is in all things good, and
denotes peace, love and concord : he that is horn
an the hour of Jupiter, is of a ruddy and sandy
complexion, fair hair, well proportioned body, and
of a
lovely countenance, his face rather broad than
long, well spoken ztndcourteous, ofa very zxffable
rinriageh sober, just and religious. The hour of
.`»iars is evil, and denotes the person born in it to be
of a choleric constitution. md of a robust strong
body,"soon angry, and hard to he reconciled 3 his

face red, and his eyes sparkling and fiery, much
addicted to fighting, and ready to qu•rrel with
every man he meets, which oftea brings him to
an untimely end. The hour of the Sun signifies
gn)'lt strength, and is very unfortunate for kings
and princes. He that is born in that hour hath
sharp eyes, brown hair, and a round face, denotes
one that is a great projector, aims at high things
but is often disappointed, and seldom brings his
designs to pass.
The hour of Venus is very propitious and for·
tunate, but is better by night than day, especially
mid-day, for then the sun covers it. He that is
born in this hour hath fair hair, soft eyes, and a
little forehead and round beard ; very complaisant
in his carriage, mighty amorous, and a great ad-
mirer of women; much addicted to singing and
gambling, and spends his money in courting the
female sex.
The hour of Mercury is very good, but chiefly
from the beginning to the middle: He that is born
in this hour, his ~tuation inclining to tallness, a
shar_:> long face, long eyes and nose : His forehead
narrow, long beard and thin hair, long arms aiM
fingers; ofa good disposition, and an obliging tem-
per, much given to reading, and very desirous of
knowledge, delighting to be among books; very
eloquent ·in speech, and yet addicted to ,
lying; and
if he be poor, is commonly light fingered.
The hour of the Moon is both good and evil,
according to the day : For from the 4th to the '
17th it is good to those who are born under it ;

eloquent in speech, and yet addicted to
lying; and
if he be poor, is commonly light Fingered.
The hour of the Moon is both good and evil,
according to the day: For from thc 4-tli_to the
17th it is good to those who are born under it;
n
hut from the 1ith to the 20th, it is counted unfvr·
tunatc to be born under it ; and from the 20th to
the ~ith very unhappy. He that is born in the
hom· of the Moon, especially upon her own day,
shall be pale faced, of a thin meagre visage, with
hollm.v eyes, and of middle stature, he appears
Ycry courteous and bbliging, but is very crafty
•1nd. deceitful, setting about many things, but so
inwnstant anJ variable i:1 his humor, that he is

l1e- is also very malicious, ;~nd will never forget ..

Thns have I given the reader the judgment of

but from the 17th to tl1e20th, it is counted unfotff

hour of the Moon, especially upon her own day,
shall be pale faced, ofa thin meagre visuge, with
hollow eyes, and of middle stature, he appears
very courteous and hbliging, but is very crafty
and deceitfixl, setting about many things, but so

r JTHIS month beware of letting

15th, 19th, 20th, and 25th days, because of these
days it is very dangerous: but to drink good
white wine fasting, will both cleanse the body, and
procure an appetite, but if thou hast a desire to
be let blood, and necessity urge it, see that the sign
be good for that purpose, or else it is better letting
it alone.
February.J I caution thee this month to beware
Q[ cutting any pottage made of ducks or mallows,
for they are right perilous, and if thou hast occa-
sion to let blood, whether it be on the wrist o"r
arms, let it not be upon the 4th, 8th, 16th, or
18th day unless the s1gn be very good and the

and of a dull apprehension, also a very small head
signifies the same ; but the head of a man being
neither great nor small, is the prognostic of a wise
man ; for all extremes are irregular, and a devia- ,
tion from nature ; and experience has made it
manifest, that a great head and small members, do
always produce much indiscretion and folly, both
in man and woman ; but we must also consider
the several parts of the head: And first,
Ofthe Hair.] The hair is only the excresence
of a moist brain ; yet the ancients observe several
things from it ; as, if the hair be thin, it she\rs a
man to be of a weak constitution; but if curled
and thick, it shews the. person to be of a hot com-
plexion: If the h::tir be stiff, and stand upright,
~ither upon the head, or any other part of the bo-
dy, it shews a person extremely subject to fear, and
very apt to be frighted. If the hair be thick and
lank, is she\vs a person to be meek and humble,
and his constitution inclined to cold.
Of the forehead.] A large forehead shews a libe-
ral man; but the forehead narrow, denotes a fool-
ish person: A long forehead shews one apt to learn,
and a hi.:;h forehead, swelling and round, is a sign
of a crafty man, and a coward; a forehead full of
wrinkles, shews a man to be envious and crafty.
Of the Eyes.J The eyes being moist and clear,
shews mirth, good manners, and an honest life, but
if the eyes be declining and looking downward, or
red and very great, they betoken fleshly lust; small

turned towards the nose, shew a man given to

ginning from the rising of the fore-finger, near the
line of life, and reaches the table-line, and general-
ly makes a triangle thus f:l. The table-l·ine, com-

The· line of death is that which plainly appears

for when the line of life is ending, death comes,
and it can go no farther. There are also lines in

is called the mount of Venu~ ; under each of the

cecd to
givejudgment of these several lines. A51
in the first place take notice, that in Palmas(

the left hand is chiefly to be regarded, because
therein the lines are most visible, and have the
strictest communication with the heart and brains.
Now having premised these, i1t the next place ob.
serve the line of life, and if it be fair, extended to
its full length, and not broken with an btermix-
t-ure of cross lines, it shews long life and health ;
and it is the same if a double liae of life appears,
as there sometimes does. When the stars appear
in this line, it is a significator of great losses, and
calamities; if on it there be the figure of two O's
or a Y, it threatens the person with blindness. If
it wraps itselfabout the table-line, then does it pro-
mise wealth and honor to be attained by prudence
and industry; if the line be cut or rugged at ·the
upper end, it denotes much sickness. If this line
be cut by any line coming from the mount of
Venus, it declares the person to be unfortunate in
love, and business also, and threatens him with
sudden death. A cross between the line of life and
the table-line, shews the person to be very libera!
and charitable, and of a noble spirit. Let us now
see the signification of the table-line.
The table line, when broad, and of a lovely co.
lor, shews a healthful constitution, and a quiet
and contented mind, and courageous spirit ; but
if it have crosses towards the little finger, it threat-
ens the party with much affiiction by sickness. If
the line be double, or divided in three parts in any
of the extremities, it shews the party to be of age-
nerous temper, and of a good fortune to support it;

creet, serviceable, a good Reighbor, and a lover of

caused by nzany beams striking upon a hollow

dew, but if by the coldness of the air it be con-

sons, and in windy weather, dews are not so fre-

break forth, causing a shaking, or sometimes a
cleaving of the earth, and thereby the destruction
of many people, and ruin of whole towns and ci-
ties, as the fate of Sicily has but lately shewn us,
by sinking of mountains, and raising of vallief.
But though what I have said may be the natural
cause of earthquakes, yet doubtless, the final cause
is Goo's anger against provoking sinful people;
which ought to make our fear5 to -tremble, lest God
for our sins shouldcause tke earth underm to do so.

T HUNDER and lightning is occasioned by
the exhalation hot and dry, and being carried

to the body of a cloud: now these two contrarieties
being thus shut or inclosed into one place together,
they fall at variance, whereby the ·water and fire
agree not, till they have broken through, so that
fire and water fly out of the clouds, the breaking
whereof, makes that noise which we call thunder.
and the fire is lightning ; which is first seen, tho'
the thunder crack be first given, because our

By an eclipse, in general, is understood a defect .
of light happening in some of the celestial
bodies, and is ca1Jsed by the interposition of an
oblique body, and our sight. Now the opinion of
astronomers are, that all the planets of themselves
are dark bodies, haying no light but what they re-
ceive from the sun, but the sun and fixed stars are
luminous; whence it will follow, that any planet
interposing betw:ixt the sun and our sight, so also
our primary planet coming betwixt the sun and its
secondary, deprives the secor..dary of its light, and
cons.equently renders such secondary planet unillu-
mimited to its primary.

semi-diameter be less than the latitude, she can.
not suffer an eclipse that's full ; and though

perfect shadow reaches the superfices of the earth,
by which such places that are situated within the
compass of this perfect shadow (the diameter
which is about 300 miles) do lose the whole light
of the sun, which has caus'd such darkness, that

ter information. But here it will not be amiss to
take notice, that ,\·hat will do very well for one
sort of land, will not do at all for another; and
the·::-cfore in manuring of land, regard must be had
to the nature of it: A'.D for example ; for a clayey
ground, lime and sand is excellent to manure it
with, but for a barren sandy ground, good marie
is much more proper. If it he asked, !Vhat this
marie is? I answer, it is a rich cliff clay, an enemy
to a11 weeds that spring up of themselves, and
giYes a generative virtue to all seeds that are sown
in tbe ground. . It is of a glewy _substance, ia
quality cold and dry, and was earth before it was
marie, it is nothing but a rich cby of divers co-
kr~, acwrding to the strength of the sun and cli-
mate \\here i.t is produced. This is so good a ma-
nure, that well laid on, it will enrich the barrenest
ground for t(;n years, and some for thirty. To
find it, take an ~wger whimble, made to hold ma-
ny hits, one> lnnger than another, till you haYe tri-
ed, by drawing the earth into one place, then pro-
ceca in the most proper places till you have come
to the marie, and the propcrest places are in the
lowest parts of high countries, near the brooks
and lakes, and in the high parts of low countries,
up(ln the knolls or little hills, and in the
clefts of steep banks, or branches in hills opening
themselves ; in some placec; it lies de{.p, in

Many mix the marie with the sand; but because
this is not so easy to come at, I will speak of
others more general, that will enrich any poor
land or city for grain, with less trouble and cost
than before.
'Voolen rags are very profitable for manuring
and enriching of ]and, a sackful and half being
sufficient for dressing an acre of arable ground.
The way of using them is to chop them very
small, and spread thelll an equal thickness· over
the land before the fallowing time, and then com-
ing to fallow, let the plough take them carefully
into the ground, and cover them.
Shavings or waste horns, or hoofs of beasts
are very good to manure hnd withal ; scatter the
.shavings in the same manner and plough them in
after heat. These will keep the grot:.nd in like
quality as the rags, for five years together, with-
out any renewing. The hoofs of cattle are ap--
proved of for this, and rnay be had of trott(r and
tripe-men, &c. and must be used as the rags and
shavings. Soap-ashes, when the lye has ,been
drained from them, is of excellent use in this case,
and has besides th~ property of killing weeds and
insects that breed in the ground, and eat up the
corn. The hair of beasts enriches land, being
s.trC\\'ed and ploughed in, and there let lie to r'ot.
