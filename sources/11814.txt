  		              		Experience Description   

    I began the morning throwing up in the toilet. My mother was at work, but my father was at home. He thought I had a stomach virus that was just going to take time to pass. I started to throw up blood at one point and began to feel faint, almost as if I were going to pass out. When my father saw blood, he called the ambulance.  I'm not sure how long it took them to get there because I was feeling like I was going in and out consciousness. When the ambulance arrived the emergency medical technician kept touching me and talking to me, telling me to stay awake. Once I arrived at the hospital and was put on a stretcher, everything went black and all sounds were completely gone. 

  Then I felt like I was passing through an all-white and bright, endless area where I couldn't see my body or talk. It felt like I was a ball of energy just passing through something. Then a bright person, object or ball of energy appeared in front of me. It didn't say anything. But its presence made me comfortable and safe. In my mind, I  started repeating the thought, 'Everything will be all right, relax.' I don't know how long I was in that state and it may have just been a dream. But after that day, I wanted to be a better person because I was a lazy and  mean child. I also became more spiritual, always thinking that there is a reason  for a lot of things that happen in life.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian   Wasn't religious at all.  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I'm not sure if there is a god and jesus anymore, but there is something about life. I'm just not sure what it is. Ever since that experience, my mind has always wondered what else there is in the whole universe and what life is all about. I never thought about that before my experience.  
  
  What is your religion now?         Do not know. I'm not sure what I believe in anymore. There  may be something else -  not so much one god or anything, but something.  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I grew up going to church with my family on Sundays, and learned that there is a god and jesus.  But after the experience, I questioned the notion of one god and a jesus.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   The thought that 'everything is alright and relax' kept repeating in my mind. I'm not sure whose voice it was.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain     No one said anything but the assumption was made based on where I was.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         Unknown.     Uncertain,     I'm not sure if there is a typical life after death or if we remember anything but I left thinking that we are energy that passes around.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   My dad called me a liar when I told him because he was in a coma before and he said he didn't see anything. It was a strange experience.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It is the one experience along with another one that was strange. I don't know how long after I had the surgery and first experience. It may have been a week or so. I was having stomach issues and constant visits to the hospital because I was constipated. The doctors said it was normal, so my parents didn't think too much about it. Then one night during the week, I fell asleep and  dreamed of two spirits or two forces of energy.  They felt like my deceased grandparents, who were lifting me out of my body and taking me away.  Then I immediately woke up before they could take me too far. I told my mom. She got scared and took me to a different hospital that same night. The hospital found that my intestines had been tangled up from my appendix surgery. My experience from the appendix surgery and the dream I had a week after, are two things I will never forget.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told my mom first when I woke up and she smiled and said okay. I also told my dad, but he said I was a liar looking for attention and that if I told other people, they would think I was crazy. So, I never shared my experience again.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     For a while, I kept trying to figure out what I saw and why I saw it. I knew after I woke up and the weeks after, what I experienced. I really hoped to go back so I could talk to the light.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.  Real is a hard thing to define. It could have been a dream, but it is one that has not gone away. During my hard times in life, I go back to that moment.  
  
  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I explained previously that a week or so after the surgery that I was having complications. The doctors brushed it off as nothing but stomach aches and gas. Until one night when I dreamed, I was taken out of my body by two Beings, which I thought and told my mother were my deceased grandparents.
