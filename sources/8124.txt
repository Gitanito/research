  		              		Experience Description   

    There is no beginning for this experience. I remember what I did many days before the accident.  I clearly remember what happened before my NDE.  But it didn't happen all at once so the experience is divided into two stages, two places, many people, and many arguments. 
  
    I arrived to that place dragged by 2 little boys about five-years old. They held my hand while they  laughed and sang together with four other boys who were holding musical instruments.  The music as  fine, sweet, and loud as it  spread all over in this space that had no walls, angles, or rooms. I stopped because I had arrived to a dark, pitch-black, place that was  far away from the  little white point. The point became larger and  whiter.  I arrived quickly but was in  no hurry. The darkness disappeared and a great light was all around me. The boys appeared again and  led me a little further. I saw a black point very, very far from me. I floated without feeling the weight of my body. I looked around and was happy. I didn’t wonder where I was or where I was going, or who  those boys were.  I just floated with great happiness. 
  
  I saw a bench that was suspended in the white light.  Three old men were seated on the bench.  When the boys appeared, they started to elbow each other, while smiling and laughing. They were three, toothless nice guys, especially the middle one who was almost bald.  

  I was led to a guy who seemed human, at least from the waist up. He was dressed in a white tunic.  His  bust and shoulders were very, very white as the light all around us.   As I think about it, I could not distinguish the tunic. Yet, I thought he wore one like mine. I distinguished his face because he had long curly, grizzled hair. I assumed his  form because in front of his chest was a very high pile of extremely big sheets of paper  he started to look through calmly.  I'd say there were  at least 20,000 sheets there.  He asked me for my name  and surname in that order. My name was not in his lists, but in another guy's list. While he was looking up my name and not finding it, he became impatient and then as he continued to look, he because frantic. He kept flipping through the pile of sheets at an extremely high rate.  Then he closed the book.  Before starting again to search for my name, he looked at me and asked my name.  I answered by pronouncing my surname, followed by my name just as I did when I was enrolled in the military school where I was trained on earth. 
  
  I didn’t feel the sensation of time running, but he flipped through the sheets with much more eagerness until he realised that my name was not there. He wasn’t disappointed at all and with authority ordered me to turn around. The music disappeared and there was complete silence.  The boys disappeared too. These instants lasted just a few moments. Then, I felt a strong push on my back as he said, 'It is not your time. You cannot stay here. It’s not your turn, turn back!' 

Later I remember waking up in a hospital bed with my back lightly arched and with my sister near the bed.
  
    Another part of my experience, I don’t know which is first chronologically because it is very different in places and arguments.  I recall speaking to my sisters, or more precisely, I looked at me speaking to them and to my mother while sitting at a round table in my mother's kitchen. The table was almost set and my mother was sitting to my left, my sister Susy sat to my right, while my sister Mariolina was standing in front of me while she was doing the dishes. She told me that in a few days I would be hospitalized for a check-up and advised me to put all my things right since my hospital stay could be very long.  I watched myself talking to them and was adamant that that situation was real.  When I asked my sister's about this conversation, they told me it had never happened.

What is your religion now?         Do not know     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     During life on earth, I never thought about death, if an afterlife exists, or when my time will be to go. Now, after my experience I still don’t think about it but I am sure I am not  afraid of death anymore.
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I am more attentive and sensible to human condition, but I am not so sure about a clear-cut distinction between 'good' and 'bad'.  
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   It was the guy who flipped through the pile of sheets.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain     Just awareness that all is connected and that everything is life in different forms.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     During the first part I lived as it was normal life on earth. I wasn’t informed but I felt that it was not death.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life.     I am more calm and  more thoughtful. I try to think what other people would do in certain situations.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am much more sympathetic and consider what I thought to be minor things to be more important now.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember the experience more accurately than other life events  which happened after the experience.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The extremely high pile of sheets were full of names, but whose names? I get shivers just thinking about it.   Ultimately, I think it had to be a system and  a sort of rule that I know nothing of.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared  with my family who have cried.  My sister, who is also physician, told me she had listened to similar stories recounted by some of her patients.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I saw myself move around in midair  and talk to others.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real.     Both parts were probably not real as far as life on earth is concerned. The second part was much less  real than the other part.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I am living with a serene doubt but, at the same time, it’s not important because I still live.
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No suggestions, I think your site is well structured. Keep it up!
