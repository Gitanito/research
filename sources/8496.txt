 Almost Here

Cougar, May 2021

    For the last while, I have been experiencing Being not only as my true nature, but as the nature of everything. This means Being is also the true nature of the normally convoluted ego-self. The pure presence of Being is the underlying ground both of Essence and for structures of the ego-self. Surprise, surprise!  

  Being in psychology is also known as Presence, Soul in ancient Greece, Self in these times, Stillpoint in Christianity, Buddha Nature or Boundlessness in Tibet, Atman in Hinduism, Divine Essence in Sufism, Nothing or Infinite in Kabala, Tao in Taoism, and so on.  It can be seen in two basic aspects of either dark shimmering waters or brilliant, Luminous Light.  

  What I have been vaguely expressing for decades now, and only to my closest friends, is that people do not see who I am. People do not really see me! It has been frustrating on so many levels because this is most often confused with normal and abnormal Narcissism. Deep down, it is only natural most people want to be recognized for who they are, so they still misunderstand me! My intentions and actions are usually misread within the "normal" perceptions of others.  I finally understand how to speak more directly to that in different words, more relatable words, I think... You can let me know.   

  These thoughts are inspired by A. H. Almaas and other researchers. When we were really young, we were in touch with our true nature. It was mostly unspoken and not thought about.  When we gathered friends who were developing fun personalities, playful & dreadful, our true nature became boring in contrast. We did not want to be left out so we learned to be like them, to pretend, to join them in their world, the world of lies, the world of the shell, the conventional world.  We ended up hiding & abandoning our most precious nature, our Essence. We accommodated our parents, our teachers and our peers. We became what we were not, by developing a false Self that gradually became real to us. In short, we betrayed ourselves willingly and eventually no longer saw it as betrayal. We swept it under the rug.  

  A very few people (Almaas) do not forget their Essential Nature. They keep it secret and feel very alone with it. After some time mourning the loss of friends by their own dreadful choice, they find they are not really lonely, but they are alone. I was included among those "very few people."  I never lost "IT."  Then the magic of the staying-true-to-self appears stronger than before and can be developed to various degrees depending on how deep the wounding is of losing the support of others.  

  Now with the context clear, I can make my point. When people do not recognize their own boundlessness of Being, then naturally, they will not see very far into me. It used to hurt when I did not quite understand why they didn't recognize me, but now I know. They no longer know themselves! How can they recognize me?  This new understanding is just as painful as before, with a twist. This proves not to be egotistical at all, this is Loving Compassion I speak of.  We few suffer a little more when most others suffer a lot. My stirring book Seven Above Seven Below, symbolically shows this as mud covering faces, along with many other precious hidden jewels.  

  I was fortunate to find & stand under the refuge umbrella of Maslow's 15 characteristics of self-actualization. That kept me relatively secure for years in the pouring rain of alienation & isolation. Then, a double whammy: Because this tragedy of losing Being is so common, I was never fortunate enough to find a life-mate who could grok me and realize our wildly dynamic potential together. I only see a wasteland behind me, where a private Garden of Eden could have been planted by a glowing couple. I now see in front of me, a wasteland on the face of the whole Earth of many emotionally & physically impoverished people and several true villains who really went the tragically painful course away from precious Being. It doesn't have to continue that way! It is our choice.  

  Pure Being is the most precious thing in reality because it is the preciousness of everything in reality.  It is like when a mother recognizes that special look in a baby's eyes when she/he really sees you for the first time. That look goes to ones very core, as if seeing right through you. It is a gift, a precious gift.  

  Reading this, teach your children well, and remind them of their Innate Potential for future generations sake.  Let us continue to sow the Earth with good seed. We would all reap the rewards of incredible bounty.  

  My unconscious told me in a dream that this Cougar still has some kitty litter to clean up in my backyard, but I feel am getting there. As it slowly comes to my attention, I am getting there. Getting There?  Getting Almost Here!  

  Each time I stare into the abyss, the closer (not further) I see into Being.
  Who am I?
  Each time, I see a little more into Being.
  Who am I?
  And, a little more.
  I Am... We Are.  

  As Hawkwind once sang:  It's a "Never ending journey on the edge of time, the edge of time, the edge of time."  

  Blessings, Cougar  </span>

Three Segment     Dragon Tail   Vivid Dream

Those three tales (email stories) were increasing in length as I noticed more needed to be said.

  The titles of this one basic story also transmuted in description from  "Incredible?  or a puff of air?"  "Fool on the Hill"  and  "Storming the Capitol, 6 January 2021, full Prophecy of 1974"    I received various responses, most of them very encouraging  but a couple of them, how should I say were, "less than encouraging."  It appears I unintentionally used some "triggering" words that in turn triggered my Vivid Dream.

    For some clarity, I shall first briefly list 5 categories of dreams as I have discovered them:

  1- Unconscious dreams, for those not registered upon awakening.
  2- Regular and sometimes non-sensical dreams.
  3- Vivid dreams which hold clear & sometimes important messages.
  4- Lucid, in which the dreamer becomes aware of dreaming inside the dream and
  5- Dream Vision, the most rare & most amazing.

    Now, back to the short story, ah, er, Vivid Dream.  

  I entered the double-doors of a home-spun church, much like our local UU church.  There were chairs in the sanctuary instead of pews, much like our local UU.  I noticed for the most part there were men seated left and women seated right.  I thought to myself, "That placement is a little old-timey."  

  I was in the back holding a narrow black case much like a 4 foot long instrument case.  As I lowered the case to the floor, popped the snaps and opened it,  The ceiling fell away to expose the open air, green trees and rolling hills.  

  I pulled a four foot Dragon out and onto the floor, which was now grass below our feet.  Both of these actions (ceiling opening & Dragon out) caused some alarm  as you might imagine, and most parishioners fled the immediate area.  

  The nourishment of the natural world caused the Dragon to grow and split into three dragons.
  The two foot head & neck section had two feet.
  The two foot heart section had a head & two feet.
  The five foot tail section had a head & two feet.

    Of course all these feet made the dragon troublesomely mobile.
  It could now go off in any direction and be difficult to put back into the case.
  I tried collecting it back as some brave souls stayed there to watch but not aid in any way.

    The head section mostly stayed in place near the black case, for now.  Carrying the heart back in my arms, I saw the tail section slide off into the thickets.  "It may be too late to gather that one back," I said to myself as I woke up.

    No need to translate this obviously Vivid Dream.
  The Dragon is unleased upon the World!
  What fun our Subconscious can be at times!
  Maybe I can round off the spines if I ever send it out again?
  I tried to be careful in walking the middle road.

  The  first Dream Vision

  The first Dream Vision (of   seven) after the disaster of 9/11/2001 &nbsp;came to me at 4:30 in the morning of   Friday the 31st of May 2002:&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People wandered into the   tavern talking of a woman about town.&nbsp; Some were laughing and some were scolding   her perceived reputation. &nbsp;Others already inside the tavern joined in the   conversation.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people liked her   because she was more up front about her sexuality and wasn't trying to hide   her&nbsp;relationship with them. Some were angry with her and called her a whore, or   worse.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later,&nbsp; I ended up   running into her in an alley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to describe her? &nbsp; &nbsp;To me, she wasn't   attractive nor was she ugly, but she had this naturally hypnotic appeal to her   that would make your head swim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was like a wandering waif with flowers in   her long hair and perhaps she was not exuding profound intelligence very easily   perceived, but she had a great sexual power and charisma that made her very   appealing and attractive.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just so you understand   the huge temptation here,&nbsp; I have been celibate most of my life,   sometimes by choice and sometimes not by choice, but by Grand Design. My seed   has remained unfulfilled potential.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in an alley   alone, together. &nbsp; She just came sauntering up to me. &nbsp;I just heard about her   insatiable sexual hunger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a man!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am single!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my   chance!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soooo.....

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is wrong with me?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I was turned on by her very presence but all I could feel for her was sadness   and concern for her life and her misplaced desire for the love that she needed   so desperately, that, really, we all have misplaced and hunger for, since losing   that sweet and powerful Love we knew in Heaven before we 'fell' to Earth and   into blind ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that we are all   here to learn about love the hard way, to learn even quite difficult   lessons&nbsp;about love and I felt for her like a brother to a sister.&nbsp; I felt her   vulnerability to what humankind could do to her and I wanted to protect her from   harm.

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked into my eyes   and saw the truth of it. I passed the test. &nbsp;What test? &nbsp;She was brought to me   by Great Spirit, not to try to seduce me but as a guide. She was Nature herself!   &nbsp;She was Gaia! &nbsp;The fertile egg that includes the infinite&nbsp;Mandelbrot design has   indeed great and deep intelligence beyond our ken. She is the seduction of Life   that some people love and some people despise.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She led me down secret   passageways of town and into a semi-dark building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had wanted to protect   her and she ended up showing me the way to an obscure Temple.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We entered the huge domed   hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking toward better light, In the reception area, before the main   chamber, I saw a few people milling about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A movie producer came up   to me and started conversation. We&nbsp;talked about making a movie out of my nde   stories and bits of my life.&nbsp; We were excitedly in agreement to the venture and   papers were signed on the table before us.

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gaia (Inanna) then led me   through the main chamber and looking cautiously around her, opened a secret   panel on one wall in the shadow&nbsp;of two pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stepped upstairs to a   hidden second floor that few knew about and fewer could enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kamila was in   there waiting for me, along with some Children of Light.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet waif took   leave of me here, as her job was finished.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I was in new   territory here, so my mind became more acute in awareness. There were many   symbols here and strange writings, much like Arabic and ancient Sanskrit, very   beautiful and flowing. On the walls were overlay-ed woodcut forms of arabesque   as dazzling as&nbsp;the jewels in the night sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My attention went to the   Children of Light for a moment.&nbsp; At first I wondered if they were James Twyman's   psychic children.&nbsp; I made sure to understand this as I have been pulling his   groups tiny &quot;believe and it is so&quot; wings off recently in my writings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I   came to know them,&nbsp; I realized they were not children at all.&nbsp; They   only&nbsp;manifested that way for this lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These children were the &quot;innocent   outwards&quot; of the most Ancient Elders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may also be called Angels or   Spiritual Travelers between the&nbsp;many worlds of man and God.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kamila was there to help   me with her love and her ancestral connection to this ancient language.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The   &quot;children&quot; explained that the most important discovery was an&nbsp; &quot;L&quot;&nbsp; type   symbol.&nbsp; They explained further that there were four different ways to hold this   symbol and by doing so, they each appear to be a different symbol than the   others, like the number 7. &nbsp;The symbol was also a type of&nbsp; &quot;eLL&quot;&nbsp; sound or&nbsp; &quot;iLLya&quot;&nbsp;   or&nbsp; &quot;La.&quot;&nbsp; Fragments of the ancient lyrical sounds for God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One symbol would   unlock a door, depending how it was held.&nbsp; I held up the symbol and pressed it   to the wall and it opened.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked out of the   hidden window the symbol had opened up and could see a priest in the courtyard   below.&nbsp; He didn't know of our secret room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was in the direction of the   West.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was holding ritual with one of the symbols.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Angels told me   that there were 4 major religions outside&nbsp; (in the world)&nbsp; and that each one had   one symbol of the Four and thus the whole Truth was not in any One.&nbsp; And yet,   each of the Four were one and the same symbol turned in different directions.&nbsp;   They&nbsp; (the people)&nbsp; are unaware of the secret journey &quot;inside&quot; this matrix.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Angels told me that   the second door could only be opened &nbsp;by understanding how to apply the lesson   of the first door that I had opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the symbol to the   opposite wall, placed my hands on the wall and chanted the ancient sounds of   God. &nbsp; Nothing happened. &nbsp;It was then revealed to me by my Intuitive Wisdom that   the real magic for this secret door did not lie in using one symbol in four   different directions,&nbsp; but by using four of the same symbols in One special   combination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several combinations but only one with their spiritual   eye open would know the right one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will suggest two of them here.&nbsp; One is   the magic symbol for the world (the square) and the other is infinity:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L7L7.   &nbsp; &nbsp;I then heard the Ancient Elders say, &quot;Lo! &nbsp;He has recalled the mythical key!   &nbsp;He is the one who will unite the Four Great Traditions of Religions into One!&quot;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed the four symbols   on the wall with my hands and chanted the ancient sounds of God, &quot;La ilah ila   Allah&quot; (no Gods just God). &nbsp;The wall opened up into a great semi-dark cavern.&nbsp; I   say semi-dark because by the standards of the world it was subterranean and a   scary type of darkness.&nbsp; But, one moved by the Light of the Spirit could easily   see his way through what appears to be darkness, the darkness of the Earth   world. &nbsp;At the time, I did not know what the Travelers meant by the Four Great   Religions! &nbsp;Was it Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Buddhism? &nbsp;I discovered only   recently that they meant the Ancient Gods tradition, the Gaia tradition, the   Wisdom tradition and the Prophetic tradition.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Children of Light   said they have been endlessly working on traveling here through this hidden   world of God within the world of Man;&nbsp; That very few have traveled completely   through this way, if at all, and that it was now my task to travel it after the   fashion of the story of Khadir and Moses, which Bruce Lee borrows in his movie,   &quot;Circle of Iron.&quot; &nbsp;Thusly, I had found my way into knowing how God works   invisibly in the world.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was given a sheaf type pouch&nbsp;with six arrow-sized swords inside it&nbsp;to hold   in my left hand. Then I was given a staff for my right hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   (The six arrow-sized swords represent the keys to the six {more than our   commonly known four} &nbsp;directions, which are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North, South, East, West, the   Above and the Below. &nbsp;{The four cardinal directions and the two&nbsp;spiritual   directions}... and the pouch is the seventh direction which I discovered by   inspiration as I danced the Sacred Spiral Dance one full moon, years ago.

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(The seventh direction is   the one that binds the other six together {as a pouch would}:&nbsp; This is the   direction of the Heart or&nbsp; Love,&nbsp; which does bind all together as One. This   direction is represented by reaching out to all the directions while turning in   a circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got validation of this inspiration months later when I read that   one tribe describes this 7th direction as the binding leather tie which holds   six sticks or arrows together.&nbsp; Many tribes hadn't&nbsp;known this 7th direction,   being lost and forgotten down through time.)

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Staff of Wisdom could   be pulled apart at the hilt to expose a hidden long sword of great strength and   power unknown to casual passersby. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Sword of Truth. &nbsp; &nbsp;I will share my   wisdom and the truth of it will be left behind to be explored when I leave this   world and perhaps even because of by the WAY &nbsp;I will leave this world, if it   happens the way it was prophesied to me during my nde in Heaven.

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Sword of Truth inside   the Staff of Wisdom is a good analogy, for the truth is not easily received. &nbsp;I   have never heard of a Rose of Truth or a Shovel of Truth. &nbsp; &nbsp;:) &nbsp; &nbsp;Though, &nbsp;I   have heard of a shovel used in the case against B.S. &nbsp; &nbsp;:)

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Sword of Truth slices   and dices, cutting away at the ego and other illusions of life that people cling   to so dearly. &nbsp;They curse the Sword as it swings in their direction. &nbsp;The Sword   can even kill if one holds on too dearly to false pride and false humility or   when man completely misunderstands the truth, &nbsp;which is often! &nbsp;As the sword   dances in the air, the sword sings dreadfully to some and the sword sings   ecstatically to others.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Children of Light led   me into the darkness, with their Light becoming mine, and showed me&nbsp;through   their&nbsp;eyes as far as they have gone in this maze of Life.&nbsp; I could see that they   had compassionately sprinkled the correct path for me with drops of water from   their Angelic tears for my bare feet to feel and know which turns to make in the   massive maze. Otherwise, I could be lost forever in the maze. The wet tears   guiding my path, to me is for my growth and is like standing on the shoulders of   others, human and Divine, who have passed this way in hardship and struggle   towards spiritual freedom. It has all been hard-won and there is no other way to   it.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Angels cautioned me   that nearing the half way point I would be on my own to find the correct   pathways in my downhill trek out of the mountain Temple maze and out onto the   parallel shore of Man.&nbsp; It was a little unnerving for me to hear this but they   showed me that I would get guidance at certain critical places along the way.&nbsp; I   would make my decisions based on new knowledge given me through future Angelic   Dream Visions&nbsp; and by&nbsp; &quot;reading the signs.&quot;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these future   events were revealed to me at this time.&nbsp; Only three I can remember:

  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be one place   where I will be submerged for an hour to weather the dangers presented to man at   that time.

  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will recognize being   near the end of the journey as I travel through a major drop off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There I   should seal up that cavern chamber as it is connected to man's entry to this   place going in the wrong direction and needs to be sealed off for their   protection.

  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are   Arabian/Moroccan types here who will recognize me for the&nbsp;Light in me and if   they don't kill me for misunderstanding my words and deeds,&nbsp; the ones that are   wise enough may guide me to a ship to set sail on yet another journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The   Children showed me that the main purpose of the maze (an amazing once in a   lifetime journey in itself) was to lead me to that further journey across a vast   sea. &nbsp;Is this the sea of mankind? &nbsp;Shaza, a Middle East news correspondent &nbsp;and   dream interpreter mentioned this sea of mankind may be the 4 million-some   pilgrims at Kaaba in Mecca who annually circumambulate it 7 times. &nbsp;Looking   back, the sea of mankind could have been the bridge Shaza and I made between   east and west after 9/11 by publishing my NDE stories in the Middle East.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unite the Four Great   Traditions of Religion into One? &nbsp;Who! Me? &nbsp;That is a tall order to fill, or so   I thought. &nbsp;Now in July of 2010 I see the prophecy as being fulfilled! &nbsp;The   final puzzle-piece is in place! &nbsp;The prophecy is not about creating a new   religion that will eventually degenerate in dark times like the others. &nbsp;The   prophecy is in discovering and sharing this vision to be used as a personal tool   to those who would be inspired by knowing this is indeed one of the most   important universal workable notions for the benefit of Self and All.

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One church recently   asked, &quot;What do all the world's great religions have in common for their main   purpose?&quot; &nbsp;I can see &quot;community&quot; and &quot;love&quot; among those answers but what I have   stumbled into because of my 3 NDE's and 7 Dream Visions is very specific and has   everything to do with &quot;L&quot; &nbsp;and &quot;7&quot; and human potential. &nbsp;You may be amazed at   just how simple and profound it is once it is revealed..... &nbsp;but THAT is the   subject for another time. &nbsp;Some of you will be at the meetings where the veil   comes off. &nbsp;Many of you have been working on this by yourselves but just didn't   know how universal it is and may just say, &nbsp;Big deal!&quot; &nbsp;The interesting thing is   even Atheists and Agnostics know in their hearts and by their own experiences   that this is the work to do, even without religion. &nbsp;To them, religion gets in   the way. &nbsp;This little accidental discovery of mine cuts through it all and   embraces it all when one is ready to hear it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light, love and Sound, &nbsp; Cougar3

    TO SLAY OR TAME THE DRAGON

  Dream, early   morning,&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday 3 April 2010

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To slay or tame the dragon, that is the question! &nbsp;We have been taught from   decades ago to slay the dragon automatically without question.&nbsp; It is powerful.   It is deadly.&nbsp; It is a monster. It blasts whole villages with its fiery breath   and incinerates men, women and children. It has no mercy.&nbsp; The brave&nbsp;knight goes   forth to slay the dragon and becomes a hero to the village. There was no   reasonably sane way to even think of taming it.&nbsp; In recent years there has been   a magical shift.&nbsp; It showed up in my dream this morning:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dreamt I was in a huge ship. It was even larger than Noah's Ark   rumored&nbsp;able to&nbsp;hold two of each animal that roamed the Earth.&nbsp; This is my vain   attempt to describe huge open spaces inside. My mom was scrubbing the deck and   talking about keeping a tight ship. Her character reminded me of Morgan Freeman   playing God in   Bruce   Almighty. &nbsp; I realized this ship represented my conscious mind&nbsp;which   interacts&nbsp;with this world, as we will see more of later in the dream. I went top   side only to discover I was not on the water (of emotions)&nbsp;but in space. Well,   not in deep space but in blue sky. (Interesting I said that: Blue Sky&nbsp;may   be&nbsp;conscious mind, Deep Space&nbsp;may be&nbsp;Universal Mind.)&nbsp; All of a sudden a huge   dragon appeared out from the sky, paused 50 feet above and in front of me, then   landed on board. At first sight, I was shaken and braced myself for a fight.   Then I realized it was an intelligent being. My reaction shifted quickly and I   attempted to befriend the dragon. We shared telepathic words&nbsp;and&nbsp;mental   motion&nbsp;picture stories. I was shown by this dragon that this exercise (meeting)   of ours was not unlike the Buddhist idea of taming the horse. The&nbsp;theory   states&nbsp;that the mind is like a wild horse that can be tamed through proper   meditation. The result is a mind that is calm, clear and eventually virtuous.   But the dragon is not mentioned in common circles or in Dharma Talks because   people in general are not&nbsp;in a place&nbsp;yet to have need of this knowledge.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the horse relates to the mind, the dragon relates to the Siddhis, the   great powers that come in the ten levels (bhumi) of Bodhisattva development.&nbsp;   The great powers can lead to great temptation and darkness, or at the very least   they distract one from&nbsp;developing compassion, so the dragon is rightfully seen   in common lore to be slain, to keep the ungodly power at bay. But true Buddha   Nature is to embrace everything equally. The Victorious Ones saw that instead of   slaying the dragon, it was much wiser to tame the dragon. To champion it through   the treacherous caverns of the Universal Mind's powers (and&nbsp;not to&nbsp;succumb to   the new dazzling temptations of selfish greed&nbsp;and worldly power) is to succeed   in reaching the ultimate Siddhi:&nbsp;Absolute Enlightenment. Then, everything is   known in perfect balance. Until then, it is quite a challenge for all of us to   live in our suffering lives.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then flew around inside my huge &quot;Mind Boat&quot; and saw all the work that was   left to do to complete it.&nbsp; Even though it was flying perfectly in the deep blue   skies, it still had several unfinished gaping holes in it, especially toward   the&nbsp;bow, which is the leading&nbsp;edge through ones adventures.&nbsp; How do I greet the   daily succession of events that come into my life?&nbsp; With compassion?&nbsp; With fear,   anger or indifference?&nbsp; Knowing each different approach may effect the   outcome?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were still many planks of wood to apply to the shaping of my   &quot;Mind Boat&quot;.&nbsp; The Buddhists Anne&nbsp;and Roz&nbsp;there to assist, along with my mother   but strangely no Buddhist Karen. All are examples of putting attention on   purifying the mind (swabbing the deck, etc).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up to realize I was just 7 hours away from teachings from Lama Padma.   What I didn't know was I was about to take my Bodhisattva Vow during this day as   well. (I was supposed to be in Seattle except for last minute snow and had   forgotten this Vow was to occur because I wasn't going to be around for it.)&nbsp; We   covered enough text and instruction over the past year to continue along this   Bodhisattva path, along with taking the Bodhisattva Vow, to now be known at this   level as the Buddha's Heirs.&nbsp;After the day was&nbsp;finished did I realize this had   everything to do with having the right materials, the nails and planks of the   great ship, to eventually complete it.&nbsp; This will not happen overnight, nor just   at night in my dreams...&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be long hard work, but fun at times. The   rewards are outstanding... the end of suffering as we know it.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same Saturday in the evening&nbsp;I chanced upon a premiere showing of   Eragon    from 2006.&nbsp; A boy discovers what looks like an oval shaped blue stone about   a foot long which turns out to be a dragon's egg. After it hatches it takes to   the boy as&nbsp;if he is the dragonette's&nbsp;mother. She matures into a full dragon   which trusts and trains   him    to ride her during flight. Their bond becomes so close that he can see   through her eyes, which are more penetrating (a siddhi) and they can speak to   each other telepathically (yet another siddhi). This exhilarated me&nbsp;even more at   the timing&nbsp;with my dragon dream. Darkness tries to kill both of them, and almost   does, which also relates to my discourse on avoiding temptation of power and   conquest of the world.&nbsp;To instead develop compassion and the desire to ease   others suffering.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another perfectly timed event is right now at the theaters,   another movie called, &quot;How   To Train Your Dragon&quot; .&nbsp; How funny is that?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next   night I dreamt that I was in India and that East Indians were sewing wish   fulfilling jewels on my body. Four strands ran down my chest, one strand down my   spine and a different colored semi-precious jewel on the tips of each toe. The   sewing to my skin did not hurt. My only concern was, I will never be able to   wear shoes again!&nbsp; Without warning, I&nbsp;must immediately adjust to connecting   nakedly with&nbsp;Mother Nature!&nbsp; That is not so bad.&nbsp; Nature is OK,&nbsp; it's&nbsp;people    that is the hard&nbsp; part.&nbsp; I just cannot return to old habits&nbsp;of distancing myself   from others.&nbsp; Compassion in action is tougher than just mouthing the words.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third night I dreamt of going out into the wilderness and losing my   tent, my&nbsp;food and all items of safety one by one due to misfortunes of   circumstance. I eventually stumbled into a cave dwelling community of long   hairs. I was given the opportunity of observing a special Siddha going about his   daily routine. This is&nbsp;really poor phrasing&nbsp;since a Siddha is anything but   &quot;routine!&quot;&nbsp; He was free to act as crazy as he wanted or needed to be. His   actions would always benefit and bless the others and in return they would take   care of his nutritional and other needs. He did not have to be concerned with   daily tasks and was freed up completely to develop the Minds Awareness of Self   and all of Life.&nbsp; His return to them was miraculously healing and obvious to   all.&nbsp; I guess one could say I&nbsp;was blessed with&nbsp;an interesting initiation onto   the Bodhisattva path!&nbsp; 3 nights and a full day of Dharma Teachings!

  The Hidden   Cave

  I just finished writing of my   recent adventure and here it is&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost didn't&nbsp;make   it&nbsp;to Mount Shasta this year for two reasons.... the first was &quot;the three week   crud&quot; was on me for the third time this year!&nbsp; A constantly dripping nose does   not make for a good 11 hour drive to the mountain. After a days delay I could   not resist going anyway... When I was 8 hours&nbsp;away I discovered my main drive   belt was falling apart, strip by strip. Unshaken, I made it in to&nbsp;Weed the next   morning and found not only a new belt but a mechanic willing to put it on right   away.&nbsp; I could have been stranded for a couple of days easily in some of this   600 mile terrain.&nbsp; I was very grateful for my unusual fortune. I then had a   dream of flying onto the heads of the Gods (20 foot marble statuary). Helios   (He-Lion) woke and was very angry and vengeful yet I felt a tremendous amount of   power and freedom&nbsp;about being able to do that during my escape flight from the   awakening Gods.&nbsp; How dare I stand on the heads of Gods!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday, 16 Sept 2008&nbsp; I   went in hiking at the 7000 foot level of the mountain from Panther Meadows. I   have been here many times in the last 10 years and decided to follow my nose off   the beaten path to find something different. I discovered two false caves near   each other but with barely enough room to sit in.&nbsp; These were huge boulders that   had come off&nbsp;Rock Buttress&nbsp;and crashed onto other boulders and sealed off at   three of the four ends, leaving an opening.&nbsp; I did some Tibetan practice in the   best one and&nbsp;realized I could push some dirt&nbsp;around to make&nbsp;a&nbsp;straighter   sitting&nbsp;room and maybe at a later date I could build some stone into the windy   side portal, making it more cave-like and secure.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the camp Host had   come back into Panther Wednesday and got his permission to&nbsp;work this cave on a   future visit only because when we had met last year&nbsp; he got to know we were   similar in our desire to keep the mountain sacred. This camp Host has been   coming to the mountain for 20 years and knew it pretty well. Inspired by my   discovery, I was encouraged to ask him if he knew of any real caves on the   mountain.&nbsp; If he hadn't explored one himself, he works with two local tribes   when they do ritual on Shasta and they must know from the centuries old   mythology of&nbsp;magical entry&nbsp;into&nbsp;the mountain..... after all, when I was fast   asleep here in 1987 I fell into the heart of Mount Shasta and woke up clamoring   thru dream rock and dream dirt to get back out to fresh air.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His answer was he knew of   the couple of false caves but not of any real cave, neither did the  Wintu  nor Katuk    Elders..... but perfect timing......&nbsp; recently someone came thru the camp with a   photo of what appeared to be a cave in the far distance of a meadow obscured by   trees!&nbsp; It had been recent enough that he hadn't explored for it yet, but will   go soon.&nbsp;I realized&nbsp;that&nbsp;a Buddhist Adept may have&nbsp;found it 5 years ago since he   had camped down there where no one is officially permitted to camp. It is a   protected delicate wilderness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 Sept   2008 I headed off for Waika  Meadows, an hour and a   half hike in.&nbsp; Just as the trail enters the meadow, I veered right and went down   stream where there was a faint trail off the beaten path.&nbsp; I was surprised at   the activity of the 35 foot waterfall that is not on any map for the public to   know about.&nbsp; (It was known by word of mouth.)&nbsp; Most people travel to the popular   upper waterfall beyond Waika  &quot;Spring Tub&quot;.&nbsp; I   continued down to the point where I had gotten five years ago when I ran out of   time looking for&nbsp;that Buddhist wise man out here.&nbsp; I could&nbsp;just     see some of the Lower Waika  Meadow from there. This   was where he was said to have been. As I&nbsp;carefully traveled down closer, I could   hear a male and a female talking to each other and laughing but I couldn't make   out any words. I stopped to listen and the voices stopped. Strange, there was no   one there when I entered the Lower Meadow. Something opened up deep inside me. I   continued to travel down further&nbsp;only to&nbsp;discover yet another meadow (but more   temptingly tree shaded) no one had mentioned and realized it as a perfect spot   to camp next year.&nbsp; No footprints, no people, no sun-beating heat.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came back up to the   Lower Meadow and looked thru my binoculars  from the   best position, only to excitedly see a cave perhaps 30 feet from the top of the   East end of Red Butte, obscured by a tree top smack-dab in front of the middle   of the mouth.&nbsp; Any other position on the open meadow obscures&nbsp;the   cave&nbsp;completely. Now I&nbsp;had&nbsp;done what I set out to do; verify the existence of   the cave. I was to head back to Upper Waika  to   finish my day in bliss in that holy place and report back to the Forest Service   but something held me back from leaving Lower Waika .   I realized in the waiting of another whole year to return, the true existence of   this cave would gnaw at my mind.&nbsp; I&nbsp;reflected on my recent reading&nbsp;of how after   repeated attempts, Ian Baker and Ken Storm had finally &quot;discovered&quot; the 108 foot   Hidden Falls (the portal to legendary Shangri-La) in the five mile   (hither-to-impossible to explore) gap of the Tsangpo    River in 1998.&nbsp; This place was found in the Hidden Lands of   Pemako , east of Lhasa in Tibet.&nbsp; It was a place protected by local   spirits, fierce nature&nbsp;and by Padmasambhava  himself   from all but the most deserved.&nbsp; According to   Padmasambhava's  revelations, Pemako  is the   most dangerous as well as the greatest of all the (beyul )   hidden lands, &quot;a celestial realm on earth.&quot; In song it is known as &quot;a pure realm   for the Buddhas  of past, present and future, a place   where fortunate beings can find enlightenment. Those without pure perception   will have no chance here.&quot;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian Baker, a 20 year+   Tibetan scholar and mountaineer from Kathmandu&nbsp;spent some time&nbsp;at the point of   imminent discovery in his book&nbsp;writing about sacred caves to Tibetan Practice.&nbsp;   This is what I had&nbsp;last read&nbsp;in his book, in his last chapter just before I   reached Shasta.&nbsp; I knew&nbsp;at this very moment now&nbsp;that this is what I have been   setting myself up to do over the years of exploring out here on Shasta. This was   my calling on the mountain.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set my pack down,   leaving my water and all behind&nbsp;and traveled up the right side into the forested   buttress. Again I heard the sing-song voices of a man and woman not far from me,   up in the air above the enclosed dale.&nbsp; This time I was ready to know this was   the Spirit of the Mountain calling me, initiating me, welcoming me into   unexplored sacred space in perfect synchronicity of physical location.&nbsp;I thanked   the mountain and&nbsp;intuitively joined with it more deeply.&nbsp; Then, in&nbsp;the only   sandy area between the forest and the solid rock I discovered not only deer   tracks but for&nbsp;my first time on the mountain, some bear tracks.&nbsp;I had heard   yesterday that bear is here on the east side.&nbsp;Great: a cave and a bear.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes sense.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an hour total, &nbsp;I   found myself at the last dangerous level before the summit. Loose rocks under my   feet had slipped out, crashing 100 feet and more below me. Before my eyes&nbsp;lay a   most vertical climb.&nbsp; I crossed over to the left to find myself just under the   cave opening, but it wasn't there. I went over further but could see now the   meadow was out of site.&nbsp; If I had climbed to the top, I wouldn't be able to see   the cave.&nbsp; How did I miss it?&nbsp; I went back to the middle. Those three rocks in   3D and shade could look like a cave thru binocs !&nbsp; Is   this all it is?

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frustrated, I scrambled   down the steep grade and straight back into the far side of the meadow. There it   is!&nbsp; How did I miss it?&nbsp; I am running out of enough daylight for my return trip   to Panther.&nbsp; I don't care!&nbsp; I will take a full frontal ascent and veer off where   I must.&nbsp; I dug my cougar claws in and pressed forward. (I was wearing my Roz   cougar shirt.)&nbsp; I kept my eyes trained on the tree directly at the top above the   cave.&nbsp; That tree did not disappear from sight for long.&nbsp; About half way up I had   to veer left around an overhang and then fight my way back to center just under   where the cave should be.&nbsp; My hiking shoes of 20 years burst   open&nbsp;at&nbsp;both&nbsp;Achilles heals.&nbsp; At once the cave appeared!&nbsp; Unbelievable!&nbsp; I   paused and joined my palms in triple gesture.&nbsp; As I approached the entrance I   paused and joined them again.&nbsp; For a brief moment I could see two figures   inside!&nbsp; Were these the two I had heard?&nbsp; But they were now not seen as real,   more like statues or carvings?&nbsp; I forgot totally about the bear!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder why I missed   the cave on my first attempt. It was only 15 feet from the top and not the 30   feet it seemed to be from the distance.&nbsp;I had been just under the ledge sighting   it. I entered the cave. The figures were gone!&nbsp; A trick of my imagination.....&nbsp;   or.......

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I positioned myself in   the center of the cave facing out.&nbsp; My perfect meditation spot!&nbsp; I noticed very   little moss on the cave walls but no bat guano.&nbsp; It wasn't a dark deep cave.&nbsp;   There was a little growing fern in there.&nbsp; I was going to take mental   measurements of the depth but was distracted from that task when I found I was   struck with horror at a new discovery.&nbsp; I am no Geologist but at the base of the   cave was a splintering crack&nbsp;at both sides where it looks like&nbsp;it&nbsp;shifted and   was caught again but moved enough to cause some rock to crumble and fall out   over the ledge it was sitting on. There were more cracks along the sides and   they were all at 40* angles. This cave was not sitting flat nor safe.&nbsp; My horror   increased when I could see the rock in front of me at the mouth of the cave was   shattered into slabs like huge teeth that were all facing in....&nbsp; another-words,   if the cave shifted again at that 40* angle, one couldn't run out ahead of it   without volleying out over the ledge and the forward rocks would break free and   slide back toward ME, not down and forward out of the mouth, guaranteeing one   instant death!&nbsp; I immediately dubbed this &quot;The Cougar's Quickening Cave.&quot;&nbsp; I   understand that much of Buddhist contemplation is on the transitory nature of   all life and also on death.&nbsp; I see that this cave would definitely enhance those   musings!&nbsp; I wondered with enough time in here, would that imminence of death   dwindle and the practice actually become boring?&nbsp; I doubt it after I realized   the top was only 15 feet away and there were trees on top with roots slowly   making their way into the cave, opening up fresh water channels, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also   wondered how long&nbsp; has this cave really been&nbsp;in existence&nbsp;since it isn't known  very  widely by anyone?&nbsp; There is no beaten path up   here and it is next to impossible to approach from the left or the right.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good thing daylight was  waning  which gave me only 10 minutes in the cave to   contemplate life.....&nbsp; MY life.....&nbsp; My excuse to leave it was thus not fear but   time.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good thing I know well the last half hour back down the mountain   in the dark.&nbsp; I am though, a little conflicted about the future time spent here.   This IS dangerous...... I could develop the safe, false cave that is closer to   Panther and much easier to get to.......&nbsp; but as Hawkwind    sings, &quot;It is the nature of man to be dangerous.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Synchronicity: The day after I left Mount Shasta, I continued reading in the   last chapter of Ian Bakers book,     The Heart of the World&nbsp;     where he said some of their team heard&nbsp;enchanting singing   down in the gorge while&nbsp;trying to sleep&nbsp;that last night. One elder native later   said, &quot;We often hear such singing and we hear voices, but never see anyone and,   although we can hear the words we can't understand the meanings.&quot;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Choeden    told me that they often hear duets sung between a male and a female. Sometimes   they hear voices calling their names, but there is never anyone to be seen.&quot;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The singing comes as a   blessing of Dorje  Pagmo ,&quot;  Choeden  asserted. &quot;Your friends are lucky.&quot;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddhist  Tantras  assert that Dakinis    dwell equally in the outer phenomenal world as well as in the subtle energy   channels of the adepts body. When duly acknowledged they sever the cords of   thinking that constrain perception and open doors to realms of scintillating   interdependence, beyond the boundaries of self-limiting desires.&nbsp; The dream   songs of the Dakinis -- half heard, half imagined,   totally unverifiable--&nbsp;open us up to the innermost landscapes of the heart when   we abandon efforts to edit experience and flow fearlessly into the mysterious   heart of things.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love &amp; Light,&nbsp; Cougar

&nbsp;

  HOW DO WE KNOW GOD EXISTS  		  			Most people at one time or another want to know somehow and in some   			way, if God/Allah really exists.&nbsp; It does not matter if we are   			atheist, agnostic, Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist or Gnostic.&nbsp; The   			time will come.
  &nbsp;  		  			Some days, even for the strongly religious   			among us, our faith in God only goes so far.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people cry out   			for proof of God's existence at one stressful time or another.&nbsp; The   			death of a loved one can bring out the questions.&nbsp; Any traumatic   			event can make one stop and question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time, there is   			no answer that comes to comfort us and we live on in more suffering   			and in some cases, sometimes in more hate towards God and other   			people for 'not caring.'
  &nbsp;  		  			God seems so far away from most of us.&nbsp;   			Even the name 'God' or 'Allah'&nbsp; seems to imply a male power,&nbsp; so   			some of us react by calling for the Goddess power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our   			awareness, still trapped in the reality of duality.&nbsp; God is   			above duality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is above the Mother/Father God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is   			Eternal and ineffable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why it is said that the One True   			God is above all naming.&nbsp; We cannot describe or name what is above   			our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest I can come to describing the   			Source of all Life is to call It the 'Uncreated, Creating'&nbsp; but that   			still falls short of helping our knowing what is most accurately   			meant by calling It as such.&nbsp; This is one thing we cannot describe   			with one word.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have no true word for God,&nbsp; so I will simply   			call this ineffable power &quot;God&quot;&nbsp; here.
  &nbsp;  		  			Since God does not walk this Earth with us&nbsp;   			(except partially, when we recognize God being in each one of us)   			and since we cannot&nbsp; describe God in a word or even in a paragraph,   			we feel even more distant from Him.&nbsp; It makes it so much more   			frustrating to us.&nbsp; Fortunately, some people are finding out   			that reading of near death experiences are helping&nbsp;them come closer   			to the reality of &quot;God.&quot;&nbsp; Even if the adventures into Heaven are   			still virtually indescribable, there is a commonality within the   			experiences that is too&nbsp;universal to ignore and touches the heart.&nbsp;   			Now,&nbsp;a public craving has grown out of these readings.
  &nbsp;  		  			It has been brought to my attention that it   			would help so much if&nbsp; people could experience God/Allah without   			having a near death experience...&nbsp;&nbsp; My answer is,&nbsp; &quot;They can!&quot;&nbsp;   			This is the trick that recently dawned on me that fools us from   			thinking that we ever can experience God while living in the flesh:
  &nbsp;  		  			&quot;The unnamable and unutterable essence of   			God cannot be easily described or named or understood by our limited   			minds and this easily misleads us to think that we then cannot   			experience the namelessness and unutterable,&nbsp;the essence of God.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			Stories from before our childhood tell us we may not be able to see   			God without burning to a crisp!&nbsp; This sort of thing shows our vast   			gulf of feeling/being separate from God.&nbsp; But it is not quite   			true!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can experience the existence of God!
  &nbsp;  		  			We may not be able to describe or even   			imagine what God is,&nbsp; but we can most certainly&nbsp; Experience God and   			begin to know God!&nbsp; This is a more important point than I first   			thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am talking about something with the capability of   			being a life-changing event!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not be alarmed, I am not talking   			about knocking on your door, Bible in hand, hawking Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am   			talking about something far more powerful than that!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am   			speaking from Soul to Soul.  		  			&nbsp;  		  			There are three parts of God/Allah that can   			be experienced while in the body and in full consciousness to   			personally know The Divine does exist and that we are not alone as&nbsp;   			humans.&nbsp;&nbsp; These three parts are the Love, the Light and   			the Sound of God/Allah.&nbsp; 
  			
  			I am not talking about using the imagination or the heart to&nbsp;feel   			the Love, which does occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not talking about meditating on   			hearing the Sound, which can be heard.&nbsp; I am not talking about   			seeing the Light from a distance or within and being inspired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			These in themselves are valid experiences but they mostly dim with   			time.&nbsp; I am speaking of experiencing all of these fully, being   			surrounded and engulfed in its intoxication!&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt   			what-so-ever!&nbsp;&nbsp; An experience that will never diminish from   			memory!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Life-changing event that can be repeated again and   			again when it is your time to experience them.
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;All other gifts and talents that we   			have talked about stem from these three and are of lesser importance   			than these three.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who really cares if one can heal or affect   			electricity and read peoples minds?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or travel through walls or   			through time to see the past and potential future?&nbsp; These are not   			the highest of what we should strive for in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest   			gifts are receiving the Love, Light and Sound, even if&nbsp;&nbsp;but for   			one&nbsp;brief moment...&nbsp;&nbsp; In that tiny moment it can change our whole   			outlook on life and reaffirm our faith in a Higher Power.&nbsp; Not only   			that, it brings us healing, it brings us closer to   			self-actualization, closer to psychological health and closer to   			Enlightenment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can even&nbsp;charge us with a new purpose to our   			lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else needs to be said about the importance of   			it?  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   		  			&nbsp;The reality of It's existence&nbsp;   			(Boundless Love, Divine Light and the Sacred Sound)&nbsp; is Historical   			and Biblical and in most NDE stories.&nbsp; Shamans use the drum to   			slow the heart to a&nbsp;entranced heart beat.&nbsp; With this, the wise ones   			visit the first levels of Heaven.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, the   			return drumming of Heaven is one way the Sound of God comes to us   			and is connected to the heartbeat of our life.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad was injured in WWII and near   			death he heard an orchestra of violins.&nbsp; This is another way the   			Sound of God comes to us.  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   		  			Let us take some Biblical and scientific   			references of the Sacred Sound into consideration for those that   			need to be reminded that these things&nbsp;are possible and are recorded:
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acts 2 says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And suddenly a sound   			came from Heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled the   			house where they were sitting.&quot;
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew 24 says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And He will send   			out His angels with a loud trumpet call&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (another version says,&nbsp;   			&quot;send out His angels with a great sound&quot;).
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revelation 1 says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His voice was   			like the sound of many waters.&quot;
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rev.&nbsp;14 says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And I heard&nbsp;a voice   			from Heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud   			thunder.&quot;
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rev. 22 says,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then He showed me the   			river of the water of Life, bright as crystal, flowing from the   			throne of God.&quot;
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people know of Paul's journey to   			Damascus in which at midday a light from Heaven, brighter than the   			sun flashed about him and he heard a voice speak to him.&nbsp; (The voice   			inside the sound)  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eckankar is much more specific and goes   			on to describe that the&nbsp;Sound that emanates from God is heard as a   			different kind of Sound depending what level we have reached into   			the Heavens.
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It starts out at the top (beginning of   			Creation) as a roar of atoms breathing life into the material worlds   			and is an active process of creation.  		  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A PBS&nbsp; channel&nbsp; recently   				broadcasted&nbsp; 'The Elegant Universe.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They tried to explain   				the 11 dimensional String theory.&nbsp; Below atoms and quarks even,   				are the basic units that present the material universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; These   				seem to be strings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are open-end strings and some are   				hoops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They vibrate at different frequencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes   				Sound and harmonies of Sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This relates to an earlier   				suggestion that the smallest part of the universe is not   				composed of particles, but of waves.  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking in&nbsp; the book 'The Key to   				Secret Worlds'&nbsp; this morning, I smiled when I found Paul   				Twitchell speak of the Bani as,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This wave is actually the   				supreme Sugmad in action, vibrating throughout the   				universes....&nbsp; The sound is actually the humming of the atoms as   				they flow out from God's great center into the worlds below, via   				the great wave which touches all things.&nbsp; It is often similar to   				the sound of bees humming in the sunlight, searching for the   				nectar in flowers.&quot;  			  				&nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sound is the breath of God   				and to hear it is our beginning of the journey back into our   				true home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being somewhat of a poetic mystic,   				myself,&nbsp; I&nbsp; have&nbsp;written in my first book from personal   				experience that,&nbsp; &quot;The Sound is God,&nbsp; chanting into time and   				space.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Or, &quot;chanting out time and space.&quot;)  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists have recently discovered   				that Black Holes make a great sound and the&nbsp;voice of one deep,   				deep bass in the Persius galaxy cluster measures at 57 octaves   				below our middle C....&nbsp;&nbsp; far beyond the hearing range of   				humans...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The distance between the sound waves   				determines the pitch.&nbsp; But the voice of the black hole could   				never be heard by the human ear because there are 10 million   				years between each of the sound waves, clearly not within human   				experience...&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for comparison, the average   				human ear needs to sense at least 16 waves (cycles) per second   				in order to hear it as sound.&nbsp; After around 20,000 cycles per   				second it goes beyond our range to hear it in the other   				direction.&nbsp; We only sample a section of reality.&nbsp; Ponder on the   				idea that this goes for light and love as well...&nbsp; It is all   				waves of vibration!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans&nbsp;are focused within only one   				bandwidth of it all!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we cannot be trapped here forever!
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a NDEr and an out of body   				traveler, it is not hard for me to imagine the feeling of flying   				toward a black hole faster than the speed of light.&nbsp; Once that   				speed is achieved, the waves emanating from it are relatively   				passing my astral ear drums much faster than one every 10   				million years....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast enough to hear the awesome sound of   				one of God's mighty creations.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Black Hole be a portal to   				the Void of God?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the tunnel of Light!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each galaxy   				has a black hole at its center for each 'local' resident to   				enter one day,&nbsp; by the intense gravitational field pulling   				us&nbsp;into it, or rather, our instinctive attraction to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The   				beauty of the mystery of it all!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The many Big Bangs (Not   				just the one scientists&nbsp;subscribe to at this time) may represent   				God breathing out into the Multiverse and the many Black Holes   				are God breathing duality back in to its bosom of Eternal life.  			  				&nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, now, exhausting you with all   				this Sound stuff,&nbsp; which has been more rarely known to many of   				you, I shall not bore you with a lot of Light and Love   				references, which&nbsp;have been more commonly addressed by others.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you two&nbsp;different brief   				references to Light:
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalms 104:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, thou art   				clothed with honor and majesty, who coverest thyself with light   				as with a garment.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The visionary musical group, the   				Moody Blues,&nbsp;sang:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A beam of light will fill your head and   				you'll remember what's been said by all the good men this world   				has ever known.&quot;  			  				&nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who would like more than   				just references from the dim past;&nbsp; For those who would like to   				be reassured by personal experiences happening within their   				lifetime, I offer up myself as one living example that you   				may&nbsp;know this Love, Light and Sound as well.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have experienced these out of the   				body, in the body and in full consciousness and know the reality   				of it.&nbsp; It is virtually impossible to describe the power and   				significance of having this transformative   				experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;share this gift with you. &nbsp;I emphasize that   				I&nbsp;am telling you this not to brag but to indicate to you that   				you, too, can have this experience!!!  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Boundless Love, I have tasted   				in some out-of-body and in-the-body experiences but felt deeply   				in two of my NDEs.&nbsp; Total surrounding, enveloping Love.&nbsp; Love   				more ancient than the unconditional love from grandparents.&nbsp;   				Love more refreshing and invigorating than the present moment of   				youth.&nbsp; Love more Eternal than anything this universe can   				offer.&nbsp; The Eternal Love all around me that also generated   				Eternal Love from within my very being as well.&nbsp; Everything was   				known from the space of Eternal Love...&nbsp; This is about all I can   				say on this and it falls so short of the actual experiences.&nbsp;   				Before having these experiences,&nbsp; I thought that the occasional   				experiences of pure bliss I have had through the practice of   				contemplation were as much as we could ask for.&nbsp; Funny!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How   				relative it all is!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to be no end to it all!  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Divine Light,&nbsp; I have seen in   				some out-of-body and in-the-body experiences and experienced   				fully in one NDE.&nbsp; I have seen the garments of Light of what   				many people call the Angels, visiting me at night on many   				occasions. &nbsp; On more than one occasion during a sitting   				contemplative state I had the Light come from above and wash   				through my body and scatter out across the floor dancing away   				into the darkness of the light of this world.&nbsp; These experiences   				are not only seen but felt.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are too many to talk about   				but I do want to mention two that happened during the months I   				was writing my&nbsp; 'Angels in the Light'&nbsp; book:
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day as I lay down to nap,&nbsp; a   				light came through the top of my head and felt like a real tube   				of light being placed in my brain.&nbsp; This was not any imagination   				technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It caught me by surprise.&nbsp; I was filled with love   				as intense as the fullness of one of my NDEs.&nbsp; It also caused my   				vision to extend out into the Universe.&nbsp; I embraced the universe   				because of this Love given me.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another&nbsp;afternoon I lay down to   				rest, another light tube entered through the top of my head.&nbsp;   				This time, instead of love, I was filled with the knowledge of   				the universe and anything I wanted to know about man.&nbsp; (A beam   				of light will fill your head...)&nbsp; I have been in this state of   				mind several times before, but not with a conscious memory of a   				'real' light tube like this.&nbsp; I was amazed to realize that   				Divine Light not only brings&nbsp;Wisdom but brings&nbsp;Love as well and   				can do so together or separately!
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One time around 1987 in the middle   				of a sacred drum dance that I took part in, I saw the tunnel of   				light come to me in full consciousness!&nbsp; It was a full rainbow   				of light and compelling love. I knew if I left my body to travel   				into it, I would not be able to return down through it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had   				sensed that the humans here have all but given up on&nbsp;genuine   				love from what I had experienced with this group over the past   				three&nbsp;years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found I was ready to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was quietly   				preparing to go.&nbsp; I&nbsp; thought I was doing this unnoticed.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other dancers and healers around me   				did not see this tunnel but strongly sensed something was&nbsp;not&nbsp;  				going to happen, if they could help it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five of them   				came over to me, now outside the circle and held me down with   				their ten hands grounding me to the earth until I gave up the   				struggle to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; They never did any thing like this to me in   				any other dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this tunnel that called to me,&nbsp;   				the energy of the dance changed back into people trying to close   				the gap on the emotional distance that had been created over a   				thoughtless period of time.
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I speculate that the tunnel of   				light might be the same as the tube of light,&nbsp;the same   				power&nbsp;shifting to different diameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is big enough to   				enter and leave the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other one will not permit   				that.  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sacred Sound can be experienced   				in many different types as written&nbsp;earlier and as I can   				personally attest to.&nbsp; In the body, I have heard it as&nbsp;a   				heavy wind&nbsp;or a light bell and as a hum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some say they hear a   				flute.&nbsp; At times of consciously leaving the body,&nbsp; I have   				heard it as rushing water, as rapid drumming, as an undulating   				buzzing sound&nbsp;or humming like&nbsp;a transformer or even the Huuu.&nbsp;   				In dreams I have heard it as an orchestra&nbsp;and as the Huuu.&nbsp;   				Concentration on the sound can make the dream more&nbsp;vivid until   				you wake up inside the dream.&nbsp; 
  				
  				One of the most remarkable types of experience for me has been   				when I am almost out of body, I have heard rolling thunder that   				leads me on to the Source once I get out of body.&nbsp; I compare   				this thunder to a thousand b-12 bombers flying overhead and the   				roar of water in a heat and steam system in one apartment I had   				lived in, with pipes running across the baseboards of all the   				walls.&nbsp; This helped encourage more of these experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside this great internal rolling   				thunder that sounds like it is all around me outside as well,&nbsp; I   				have heard the great voice of God speaking to me as I journeyed   				forth to&nbsp;see the face of God.&nbsp; This is probably why these stand   				out as the most remarkable and most sacred to me.&nbsp; The more   				pure (higher) form of this thunder was the Great Huuu I heard in   				my second NDE and in a dream vision or two. &nbsp; The voices of&nbsp;   				'God'&nbsp; and the angels&nbsp;were much clearer here as well.&nbsp; This is   				where life review and sacred prophecy is revealed.  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, in the dense woods behind   				my house, I found two pieces of abandoned railroad wood that was   				perfectly cut to size as if it were made for a cross!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I   				had to do was notch them a little and nail them together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   				put the smaller of the two across my shoulders to carry it   				home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got about thirty feet away from the other one I   				heard this awful buzzing sound!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew it well...&nbsp;&nbsp; I must   				have disturbed a nest of yellow jackets!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked up my   				pace.&nbsp; The noise got louder and louder until I knew they must be   				almost on top of me and I let the piece of wood drop and ran at   				top speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glancing back, I saw nothing!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have   				been stung by now as I had been on several other occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   				could still hear them all around me so I kept running, checking   				my clothes as I went.&nbsp; They love to climb you while you run and   				get inside your clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust me, I know this!&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound faded away, which was   				scary too, because that meant they were all on you and not   				flying any more!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked very closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I even pawed at   				the space between my neck and beard (Their favorite spot).   				Nothing was on me and nothing happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no bees and   				no yellow jackets but that&nbsp;intense humming haunts me to this   				very day!  			  				&nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I have introduced you to the   				Love, Light and Sound of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall tell of a fourth power   				from God that is even less known than the Sound.&nbsp; I didn't   				believe it myself until I had experienced it myself&nbsp;less than a   				hand full of years ago.&nbsp; I was falling asleep during a   				sitting contemplation.&nbsp; It was the first time I fell asleep in a   				group of other contemplators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found myself in this   				wonderful land.&nbsp; I ended up sitting under a tree of   				Enlightenment and found myself drinking in a sweet nectar that   				was dripping off the leaves into my open mouth.&nbsp; This nectar was   				more wondrous than any sweet taste I ever experienced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went   				down my throat slowly, so savoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drank it in until I was   				full and yet never was too full.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very intoxicating and   				it seemed that I could taste it forever!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came out of sleep   				back into contemplation and could still taste it for some time   				after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was so amazing!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never experienced   				anything&nbsp; like it before or after!&nbsp; I had felt as though God had   				satisfied all of my&nbsp;spiritual&nbsp; hunger.  			  				&nbsp;  			  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we experience God   				without&nbsp;risking our physical life?&nbsp; How&nbsp;do&nbsp;we experience this   				Love, Light and Sound from the very Throne of God?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This&nbsp;is   				not an easy task.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with this writing, I hope I have   				encouraged you to seek this out with more determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All   				I can do is give suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The real work is up to   				you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some keys&nbsp;have already been given.&nbsp; Do the best you can to   				find truth in yourself and in others and call upon this Love and   				Light and Sound from the Above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not easy to face truth   				within ourselves.&nbsp; We must not be merely curious.&nbsp; We must be   				fearless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must desire this with all our heart and soul!&nbsp;&nbsp;   				We will not be given anything important until we are willing and   				ready to see truth.
  &nbsp;  		  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God/Allah will give you what you need   			at the proper time.&nbsp; For some, it may only take a week, for others,   			it may take years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not matter...&nbsp; we must not waver from   			our goal, our hearts desire.&nbsp; Remember what the twin enemies   			are that keep you from discovering Truth and&nbsp;keep you from allowing   			Divine power to come in to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind and the protective ego   			are meant to be tools only, and good ones at that!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind and   			the protective ego try to remain as your task masters, driving   			you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in your power to change this.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Divine   			Light and Love can really come at any time, regardless of any   			effort.&nbsp; It is in Gods timing.
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sacred Sound can come to you   			regardless of any efforts on your part.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may come to you while   			you are in the midst of a dark night of the soul...&nbsp; It may come to   			you while you are having the time of your life...&nbsp; One thing I know   			for sure (Here it comes!!!)&nbsp; is that if you constantly improve   			the quality of how you pray to God,   			it will come sooner than later.&nbsp; Strive for 'Thy will, not   			mine' in all that you do...&nbsp;&nbsp;Start with that close-up parking space   			you so desire.&nbsp; Give it all up to God and strive to do what is   			within your truest heart.&nbsp; The more you can line up your desires   			with Gods desires, the closer you will become aligned with God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			The more you can give it up to God,&nbsp; the more you will see what   			those desires/designs are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This merging of desire between man and   			God will allow for the most high Love, Light and Sound to then enter   			you!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is that simple, and most difficult!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There you go!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be a moth to the flame...&nbsp; but do not   			burn up into a crisp!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transform into a phoenix, or a   			butterfly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Join us, the inheritors of Eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)  		  			&nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I am wrapping up this article,   			I have been led to a statement in an out-of-print book called,&nbsp;   			&quot;Dialogues With the Master&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Paul Twitchell. &nbsp; I had been a   			little concerned if my article would cause people to go chasing   			after the BIG events of God&nbsp; when perhaps we have been told   			we&nbsp;should not call upon these great powers like this but must wait   			patiently for them to come, if at all.&nbsp; People are thinking that we   			should be happy with the little events and that they mean just as   			much.&nbsp;&nbsp; From one level, this is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone will see the   			earth shake and see mountains move.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For after all, it really must   			only come when IT must.
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage is even bolder than what I   			have attempted here myself so I will leave you with this as another   			measuring rod: &quot;In the simplest terms I tell you that divine power   			is that which flows out of (the) universal body to sustain all the   			worlds.&nbsp; Call it Light and Sound.
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Man is sustained by (both the Light   			and Sound).&nbsp; Man must seek this and contain IT,&nbsp; master IT,&nbsp; subdue   			IT and make IT&nbsp; his servant along with the rest of his united,   			individual self.  		  			
  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know the secret, and tell man of it...&nbsp; (for man too&nbsp;IS the   			Light, if he would only look inwardly for it)  		  			
  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Once (the Light and Sound) is bestowed upon the individual his   			responsibility to the divine cause becomes absolute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cannot   			escape his destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do so will only create chaos in his   			universe.&quot;  		  			&nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final thought is:
  &nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that with great power comes   			great responsibility.  		  			
  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are but Immortal babes here in this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tests are   			astounding!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond myth!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond record!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not fear   			failure!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tests are always there waiting for us to eventually   			pass through when we can finally flow like pure gold from the   			crucible.&nbsp;   		  			&nbsp;  		  			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and   			Light.....&nbsp; and Sound,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cougar 3  		SUPERMAN REVEALED

Smallville&nbsp;  			began it's 5th season Thursday night, 29 Sept.&nbsp; 2005. This is a   			show about Superman in his teen years. Clark was confronted about   			knowing his secret, undeniably witnessing his strength and other   			powers.&nbsp; There are others who are coming and going on the show who   			developed special, mostly singular&nbsp;powers from the meteor shower of   			15 years ago.&nbsp; They knew this,&nbsp;being the campus investigative   			reporters they were, so he is compelled to finally tell the truth   			during this confrontation.&nbsp; Clark distinguishes himself by stating   			that his powers did NOT&nbsp; come from the meteor shower.&nbsp; He was   			born&nbsp; that way.&nbsp; He was not from Earth, not even from this   			galaxy.&nbsp; (He came to Earth in that meteor shower.) The friend   			exclaimed, &quot;You are an Alien?&nbsp; But you are more Human than most   			humans. You save lives without drawing attention to yourself!&nbsp; If   			only more people were like you, the world would be a better place.&quot;    	&nbsp;    	This fits very well with what   	Quentin Tarantino says in the climax of his&nbsp; movie, Kill Bill vol. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I   	was talked into watching it less than two weeks ago&nbsp;and do not necessarily   	recommend it!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Carradine enlightens Uma Thurman&nbsp; with the Superman   	mythology.&nbsp; For most Super hero's, it is an alter ego.&nbsp; Peter Parker wakes   	up in the morning as Peter Parker.&nbsp; He has to put on a costume to become   	Spiderman.&nbsp; This is an alter ego.&nbsp; Same with Batman.
  &nbsp;    	Superman wakes up in the   	morning as Superman.&nbsp; The clothes he wears with the&nbsp; 'S'&nbsp; on it,&nbsp; is made   	from the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby.&nbsp; (Immortal cloth. It does not   	tear nor wear.)&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; a costume!&nbsp; It is part of his true   	identity. He does not wear a mask when being his true self.
  &nbsp;    	The following is going to   	sound Uber-racist,&nbsp; or at the least as Separatism, so remember, Tarantino   	said this, not me.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The glasses and the business suit is the   	costume Superman wears to blend in.&nbsp; And what are the characteristics of   	Clark Kent?&nbsp; He is weak.&nbsp; He is unsure of himself.&nbsp; He is a coward.&nbsp; This is   	Superman's critique of the whole human race.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their costume is to be   	more than they normally are.&nbsp; His costume is to pretend mortality to get   	along with others, to not stand out.&nbsp;    	&nbsp;    	I like the blend of these   	mythologies best:&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people develop a special gift or two as they grow   	from the genetic/spiritual&nbsp;potential.&nbsp; It is not so much as an alter ego as   	it is displaying a power/gift/talent &nbsp;or two from, within and mixed up with   	their ego/weakness/ frailty.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much beauty and sadness in the   	results/fruit here.&nbsp; Their contributions to society can be seen for   	thousands of years!
  &nbsp;    	A very few are born Supermen   	and Superwomen.&nbsp; The biggest&nbsp; difference is not in taking on a super power   	or two from day to day,&nbsp; but&nbsp; Being Super naturally.   	&nbsp;Being a complete human being.&nbsp; Every other&nbsp;Super Hero has&nbsp; a special Super   	Power.&nbsp; Superman has them all wrapped up in One body!&nbsp; I could suggest   	Enlightenment here:&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;    	Knowing first hand of one's   	own Immortality&nbsp; &nbsp;(Invincible.&nbsp;Superman cannot be killed or die).&nbsp;   	    	Out of body flying&nbsp; (Faster   	than a speeding bullet.&nbsp; Leap tall building in a single bound&nbsp;, x-ray vision   	and super hearing, &nbsp;all fit this category).    	Having the most correct   	response to Life.    	Psychologically&nbsp;&nbsp;healthy.&nbsp;   	Self awareness, self acceptance.&nbsp; Self Actualized.    	Forgiving of others.&nbsp;   	Forgiving Society.&nbsp; Forgiving mankind.    	May die a complete unknown.    	&nbsp;    	We are&nbsp;all to&nbsp;reach this   	state of Being&nbsp; one day, as we all are, in Eternity.    	i hope the mythologies   	inspire us to become more than we see we are today.    	They spring from&nbsp;hidden   	Truths.&nbsp; Or rather, we have hidden away from them.    	
  	Addendum:    	
  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kal-El &amp; Inanna.    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jor-El is Superman's True Father.   	He is transcendent-beyond human form. When Clark was shot through the lung   	and died on the third episode of this season,&nbsp;Jor-El brought him back   	to life, and&nbsp;with his super powers back. This is like an NDEr gaining super   	wisdom, insight and sometimes psychic gifts.
  &nbsp;    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amazing part was Jor-El told   	him now someone close to him, someone he loves,&nbsp;would have to die since he   	was brought back to life.&nbsp; Life needs to balance a life for a life!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was   	so frustrated because it sounded like the Inanna myth that matched&nbsp;my third   	NDE. This one is from before the 18th Century BC.&nbsp; We are told Inanna could   	only come back if someone close to her took her place in Hell. I never   	understood it...........until now by comparing the two stories together: An   	adult NDEr often loses&nbsp;someone close to them because of the major changes   	they go through after an NDE!!!&nbsp; I am pulling the truths out of the myths.   	It is not that they really die....its that they die to you.   	All the old values and old friends are gone out of necessity.
  &nbsp;    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark (Kal-El) had to tell his   	earth parents at the end,&nbsp; &quot;I am not human anymore. That is the only way I   	could come back.&quot;&nbsp; In the first episode he was glad he had lost his powers   	because now he could get closer to Lana Lang and not keep any secrets from   	her. Now he is afraid to tell anyone that by coming back different than   	others he will lose someone he loves!!!&nbsp; Wow!!!

  	Enter the Love &amp; Light,&nbsp;   	Cougar      </body>

    
  
           Slippery Slope from Wisdom to Atheism to Nihilism       &nbsp;

A great   Atheist friend of mine died this March (2019) at age 79.
  I had enjoyed a full life (68 trips around the Sun) of Wisdom based first on   Faith, then on multiple Visionary experiences.
  And for goodness sake! I had multiple Near Death Experiences too!!!
  But now it was as if his essence jumped into mine, questioning everything I had   experienced &amp; believed in up to this point!
  
  For the first time, I was experiencing a full blast of Atheism,
  crumbling any and all of my ontological understandings.
  This led me straight into the horror of Nihilism.
  This went on relentlessly for three months.
  All my values were wiped out.
  Everything becomes meaningless.
  And then we die..... forever!
  
  We won&#39;t even know we had once existed!
  It was all a Noble Lie to keep Order from falling into Chaos.
  God exists? God is Dead?
  Mute point, if I cease to Be!
  And yet the Universe lives on.... How does this make sense?
  
  Then Nietzsche&#39;s words (paraphrased) came to mind:
  One must wipe the slate clean.
  Only then can we plant new seeds,
  Place in new values, one&#39;s own values,
  Not societies values, not religion&#39;s values.
  A new foundation of one&#39;s own reality.
  
  Out of desperation, I slowly developed my new values.
  What can I live for? What can I buy into?
  
  Fact- Acute awareness of Impermanence.
  Death comes to our bodies.
  Does death come to our Consciousness?
  
  Fact- Beauty undeniably exists within Nature.
  Music &amp; Art/creativity flowers through generations.
  
  Fact- Humor allows us to survive more comfortably.
  Staying upbeat is valuable for mental and physical health.
  
  The new Noble Lie- Lie to myself to gain strength to carry on
  with morality and not harming others.
  
  Inspire others to well-being while alive.
  Focus on the joys in Life, not the suffering.
  Hope for profound revelations.
  
  Undeniable Experience- I died outside in nature at age 11. I floated up into the   sky like a dandelion seed-puff. Immense Love surrounded me from Everywhere! This   caused me to respond in kind back out to greet it. We were One in that ineffable   Love.
  
  Defining Experience- If we truly die when our bodies die, where did this voice   come from telling me with a tone of urgency to &quot;Go!&quot; when I was stopping my   motorcycle for a train at age 27. The dozing driver behind me would have smashed   me into the train. Instead, we both somehow flew across the tracks as the train   crossed onto the road.
  
  Continually revisit these points to encourage growth of these new values.
  It is not difficult to find one thing every day to express gratitude towards.
  Work on limiting complaints to one a day (if not less).
  
  Fact- (to fight depression) At least I am in a semi-free country and not being   tortured, maimed and slowly killed by miscreants. I also live in an area that   has not been devastated by ongoing natural disasters!
  
  And then came the one that truly pulled me out of that mudslide......
  
  Probability- There is an Unconscious Mind that controls Heart Rhythm and Basic   Unconscious Functions. Perhaps we are all interconnected Unconsciously? .....and   if that is true, Then!..... There is a Collective Unconsciousness which leads to   Existence After Bodily Death!!!
  
  We stay connected to Everything!!!
  The Universal Mindstream of the Universe!
  That Ineffable Love I felt at 11 and 24!
  
  Universal Love, Luminous Light, Sacred Sound,
  Cougar
