you
I was in the United States Air Force
from 19 January 18 1964 until October 18
1968 I got out of the Air Force four
months early to go back to the to go
back to school basically when I left I
my rank was sergeant they had a top
secret crypto security clearance I had
worked with Tactical Air Command in
Langley Air Force Base Virginia in the
44 44th reconnaissance technical
the group was involved in photographic
reconnaissance they they were working
with the the YouTube planes the the spy
satellite photography before anyone knew
we had at that point in time no one knew
that we were doing spy photography spy
satellite photography of course no one
knew we had the u2 program operating or
what the capabilities of that program
were we also did gun camera and
reconnaissance film from c-130s all
sorts of aircraft that were going into
combat situations we processed the film
for that it was 1965 I believe it was
about June or July of 1965 sometime in
that timeframe my boss came to me I was
working in a color lab at that time I
was a technician photographic technician
with a you know background in
electronics I&#39;d been trained on
electronic photographic repair at in
Colorado at Lowery Air Force Base
actually the school is a year long the
organization that I was in was a
brand-new installation it was put in
place to facilitate the the escalation
of the Vietnam War so we were in a new
facility I had come there in January of
1965 to start that facility up we
install all the equipment there were
everything from printing presses we were
doing map making as well we were also
one of the things we were involved in
was doing a automatic terrain sensing we
would we had simulators that did terrain
we put a huge map in the Silla
in the in the simulator a terrain map
and you flew a camera over that and did
a recording of the terrain and they
installed that film in a plane in the
plane could then fly in under radar it
was called a Tran and no one knew we had
that
capability at the time as well so we
were installing all that equipment any
rate I was in a color lab one day when
my my boss sergeant Staff Sergeant
Taylor came over to me and said that
they were having a problem with some
equipment on the base and it was the
first lunar orbiter program where they
had a mission to pretty much locate the
first landing sites for the for the 1969
lunar mission for the astronauts so at
any rate he said they&#39;re having some
problem with equipment over there it was
a similar equipment that we had it was
computerized content printing equipment
and he wanted to know if I would go over
and take a look at it and he said to me
it&#39;s a it&#39;s an NSA facility and at the
time I didn&#39;t know what NSA was I was
pretty naive and I thought he said NASA
so in my mind all for a long time I
thought it was a NASA facility that I
gone to but I remembered him saying NSA
and converting it in my own mind to NASA
and for viewers the NSA is it&#39;s the
National Security Agency and I didn&#39;t
know much about the National Security
Agency until probably 10 or 15 years ago
now the interesting thing when it when
this when when this when when boss came
to me at that point in time I only had a
top-secret security clearance I didn&#39;t
get my crypto security clearance for a
few more weeks it takes it takes years
to get a high-level security clearance
like that and they start that when
you&#39;re in school and only the the outer
graduates from these schools are the
people who get the high level security
clearances they also get to choose their
their duty assignment which is really
quite nice it just was a fluke I just
happened to be well-prepared for what I
was doing when I went to school and how
did you get to be in a position where
you actually were to deal with the
material we were about to discuss I I
was asked to go over to this facility on
Langley Air Force Base where the NSA was
bringing in the information from the
lunar orbiter
and so I packed up some tools I went
over I went into the facility as I
approached the facility it was very
lightly guarded I mean the base was
under high security and angry I was
surprised that the there wasn&#39;t a higher
level of security outside the facility
as I look back on it later I went into
the facility I gave them my low-level
security badge they gave me a higher
level security badge a couple of
officers took me into this hangar it was
a very large hangar as I walked in there
were there were people from other
countries a lot of foreign people from
other countries in civilian clothes with
interpreters with him with security
badges hanging around their neck and the
first thing I thought to myself if this
is NASA what are all these foreigners
doing here what are all these people
from other countries speaking on the
language didn&#39;t make any sense to me and
I was really quite impressed with that
it just didn&#39;t grok you know I was you
know what are what are all of these
people doing here and they were very
quiet very reserved and there was a very
peculiar pile hanging over them they
were very they had a very concerned
demeanor okay so they took me into this
laboratory I took a look at the
equipment there was an airman second
class in there I was an airman second
class as well
he turned the equipment on and put it
through its paces it didn&#39;t do what it
was supposed to do I saw what was going
on with it I said I need to do some
troubleshooting on it it had little
printed circuit boards in it with
discrete components at that time it was
before we had integrated circuits and I
said to him you know we&#39;ll have to take
this thing out of the lab if we&#39;re going
to work on it we can&#39;t work in it on it
in here in the darkroom environment so
he called someone to get some people to
come in and move it it was about the
size of a small apartment refrigerator
you know wasn&#39;t something you could
easily move so everyone left the
facility left the darkroom except this
airman second class and myself and we&#39;re
in waiting for someone to come to remove
this piece of equipment
so while I&#39;m in there I said to him and
I&#39;m really fascinated with this process
how did they get the images from the
lunar orbiter to the laboratory here and
he went through the whole process
describing how the various radio
telescopes around the world were linked
and they telemetered the data into
Langley field and at the time I didn&#39;t
know what the real purpose of this
darkroom in this operation and this
facility was I thought this was where
they were bringing the data in and then
releasing the images to the public I had
no idea that there were other issues
involved in this facility so he he
starts telling me all of this
information and I knew that what we were
doing was was was classifying anyway and
that he could only share a certain level
of what he was doing with me because the
depart compartmentalized nature of of
our jobs at any rate I you know he told
me how everything worked he showed me
the equipment where the digital
information came in where it was
converted to photographic images they
were doing 35 millimeter strips of film
at that time which were then assembled
into 18 and a half by 11 inch mosaics
they were called there was a digital
signature and a grayscale on every 35
millimeter strip and those those strips
were from successive passes around the
moon and they would take and build up a
photograph they would scan one section
of moon then another and another and
then they would get a larger image so
this mosaic then would be put in that
contact printer and that was then a
print that was issued to whomever the
press the scientist whatever wherever
that was intended to go so he was
showing me how all this worked and we
walked over to one side of the lab and
he said by the way we&#39;ve discovered a
base on the backside of the Moon I said
I said who&#39;s what he knows he said yes
there&#39;s we&#39;ve discovered a base on the
backside of the Moon and at that point I
be cut became frightened and I was a
little terrified thinking to myself that
if anybody walks in the room now I know
where we&#39;re
jeopardy we&#39;re in trouble because he
should be giving me this information I
was fascinated by it but I also knew
that he was overstepping a boundary that
he shouldn&#39;t be stepping over and that
he pulled out one of these mosaics and
showed showed this base which had
geometric shapes there were towers there
were spherical buildings there are very
tall towers and things that looked
somewhat like radar dishes but they were
large structures so I I didn&#39;t say any
more to him because I was concerned
again that somebody was going to come in
at any moment would catch us having this
conversation and we would be in real
trouble I realized that he was telling
me this information because he didn&#39;t
have anybody else to talk to now
probably in that laboratory he was
probably one of the few enlisted people
and he was a worker bee and he had a
high-level security clearance obviously
but he couldn&#39;t share that information
with anybody else and in those days we
didn&#39;t when you had your security
clearance you took it seriously it isn&#39;t
like today where people don&#39;t take these
things seriously we had a different set
of morals and ethics and values that&#39;s
the way we were raised and we we stayed
bound by those agreements so it was rare
that someone would would do something
like this but this fellow and I were the
same rank I think he he was very
distressed he he had the same power and
demeanor as the scientists outside the
room they were just as concerned as he
was and he needed he needed to discuss
it with somebody so that was the end of
it right there I didn&#39;t take it any
further than that I you know I I just
filed it away but the interesting thing
every day that I went home I would think
to myself I can&#39;t wait to hear about
this on the news yep and you know so I&#39;d
turn on the TV and I&#39;d look at the news
to see if they&#39;re going to announce
we&#39;ve discovered a base on the side of
the Moon being really naive and of
course here it is 30-some years later
and we still haven&#39;t heard of
it but I it at the time I had been given
about thirty of these photographs noting
that they weren&#39;t photographs with
artifacts in them but they were
photographs from that contact printer I
had some of them autographed by dr.
collie who was the head of the project
at that time and when I left San
Francisco a few years ago I actually
sold them all in a yard sale because I
was tired of carrying them around and I
may have a couple of them filed away
someplace but it was probably one of the
best mistakes I&#39;ve ever made what was
really interesting is I&#39;m not sure what
the resolution on those photographs were
but I know that we could discern from
the satellite photography we were doing
at our installation you could read the
license number off a car at that point
in time so I know we had that level of
technology available whether or not it
was on that lunar orbiter I don&#39;t know
this also always brings to question in
my mind why we&#39;re getting such low
resolution on photographs that we
received from Mars and any of these
other missions the resolution of these
photographs is very low when we&#39;ve had
since the early sixties the capability
of much higher resolution so I&#39;m not
sure what that&#39;s all about that always
that question always comes up in my mind
if I compare it to what I&#39;m seeing now
because I do have photographs they have
artifacts in them that are similar to
what I saw they&#39;re massive some of the
structures are you know half a mile in
in size so they&#39;re huge structures I
mean and they&#39;re all different sized
structures in different photographs you
would have to have an above top-secret
security clearance which generally would
be crypto Cryptologic were above in my
case you know I ultimately did have a
Cryptologic security clearance and when
I did have that clearance I had access
to all of the imagery from the u2&#39;s from
the satellite photography I had access
to everything we were doing now the
thing that was interesting about my job
as an electronics technician I got to go
into every area of the facility I got to
go into the war
it sagg Strategic Air Command and and
did maintenance on equipment there so I
would see a lot of data that people
generally wouldn&#39;t see with my rank
normally you would go into your job
you&#39;d do your one little task if you&#39;re
a photographic interpreter that&#39;s all
you did you didn&#39;t discuss what you did
with anyone else if you worked on u2
imagery you worked on u2 imagery if you
worked on satellite imagery you worked
on satellite imagery but you didn&#39;t
discuss your job with anyone else and
you only did your task if you were a
photographic processor you only process
the images you were not allowed to
discuss what you saw in those images
with anyone else we were briefed
extensively about what this
compartmentalization part mentalization
look like you know you didn&#39;t have
conversations about what you were doing
so for me I got to go into all these
different areas and see what each of
these people were doing and some of them
did share what they were doing they
would have photographs of of the missile
emplacements above there above their
desk that they discovered or they&#39;d have
photographs of the missiles on the decks
of the earth the Russian aircraft
carriers or I&#39;d see various fresh spoil
from a satellite photography around a
missile emplacement in the Sinai
Peninsula as an example we had in in one
room in our organization we had a map of
the Sinai Peninsula at that time that
was made up from satellite photography
it was a mosaic and it was 60 feet high
and 60 feet wide it was massive with
great detail so I mean it just it was
fascinating and I saw vehicles and I saw
vehicles on the satellite photography
that that you could read the license
plate on they actually showed me that so
I know that that was something that that
was real in anyway getting back to the
compartmentalization I had access to
lots of different areas only because I
was a technician moving from area to
area the only other person that would
had that kind of access would have been
an officer with a high-level security
clearance that had a need-to-know
bottom line if you didn&#39;t have a
need-to-know there wasn&#39;t any reason to
discuss what you knew with anyone else
and even if someone asked if they didn&#39;t
have a need to know and they didn&#39;t have
a security clearance you couldn&#39;t
discuss it with them everyone everyone
wears a security badge with a specific
color and you know that that color is M
represents a specific level of security
clearance and as you move from area to
area within an organization you get into
higher and higher levels of secure area
you&#39;ll go through a gate you go into a
vault you exchange your your badge for
another badge of higher level security
you&#39;re briefed on your job as to what
your level of conversation can be with
another person you know I was told don&#39;t
ask don&#39;t discuss just go ahead and fix
the equipment we&#39;d sit down with a
security officer and he would review
what your activities were what you were
doing what you were allowed to do they
didn&#39;t ask you what you&#39;d see and they
know knew what I was seeing because they
knew knew what I had access to I was
told to be very cautious when I was off
base I was told not to drink I was told
not to get intoxicated I was told not to
do drugs I was told to be very cautious
of people striking up a friendship with
me because there were people who are
gathering this sort of information they
were there were there was a lot of
espionage around the base military as
panade or foreign espionage you got that
one
at any rate I was you know I was told
don&#39;t let anyone take my photograph be
very cautious about where I traveled
when I travel I knew that I couldn&#39;t go
anyplace for at least five years without
telling the State Department where I
were I was after I left military
any time I traveled I had to notify and
get permission to travel any place I
traveled at that point in time the
United States they had to know where I
was all the time we were told that when
we traveled over a foreign area as an
example if we went to Vietnam there was
always someone there with us with a gun
ready to annihilate us basically if we
would fall in the hands of the
they didn&#39;t want the enemy to get us we
would be killed instead so we knew we
were operating into these sort of
conditions that your life was in
jeopardy all the time should you fall
into the wrong hands so we were aware of
that I was told when I left that I would
be investigated on a regular basis to
make sure that I wasn&#39;t involved in any
peculiar activities that didn&#39;t suit the
government&#39;s needs my security clearance
expired in I believe it was either
October or January of 1998 and it was
about 1998 that I I actually after my
security clearance expired I discussed
what I had seen with my sister because
she was interested in the phenomena I
read Colonel Courcelles book the day
after Roswell in the book he said a lot
of fantastic things and he also said
near the end of the book that there was
a base on the back side of the Moon and
when he said that I said aha so I began
to believe that everything he was saying
was true and he was saying a lot of
really profound things about the crash
in Roswell and alien technology and
whatever and how it had been
mainstreamed through the office of
foreign technology by himself so I knew
that he was probably telling the truth
it just says said to me this this guy&#39;s
telling the truth because I&#39;ve had this
experience and I know it&#39;s real yeah it
was that commercial he said come forward
and I said okay it&#39;s time to to start
stepping out with this information
because I was a little irritated you
know that the government had been lying
about all this for years and covering it
up and I felt it was time to get beyond
it it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot more weight to
this than then I realized you know a lot
more cover-up than I realized a lot more
deception than I realized was going on
well some of the shapes as I said where
some of the buildings were very tall
thin structures I don&#39;t know how tall
they were but they must be very tall
did you see profile shots of them I saw
killer shots with regular shots with
shadows there there were there were
spherical and domed buildings spherical
and old buildings that were very large
they must be you know half a mile in
scale because they were in relationship
to the scale of the photograph they
stood out very clearly they were large
objects it&#39;s interesting because I tried
to relate them in my own mind to two
structures here on earth and they don&#39;t
compare to anything that you see here in
scale and structure they&#39;re similar to a
degree I mean I try to relate them to
metal structures and I couldn&#39;t see a
metal definition they&#39;re more like a
stone structure but a fabricated stone
but some of the buildings seem to have
very reflective surfaces on them so a
couple of structures that I saw reminded
me of cooling towers at power generating
plants they had that sort of a shape
some of the we&#39;re just very very
straight and tall with a flat top some
of them were round some of them look
like a Quonset hut you know with a domed
kind of like a greenhouse and all of
these buildings were clustered together
generally they&#39;re the particularly shot
that I saw there were several clustered
together over a landscape a fairly large
landscape there was a one building they
had a dish like shape to it
but it was very large looked like a
radar dish but it was a building it
could have been a radar dish
you know and there was another building
near it with a truncated top that with
an angular top that was truncated I
didn&#39;t want to look at it any longer
than that because I felt that my life
was in jeopardy
did you understand I say I would love to
have looked at it longer I would have
loved to read copies I would love to you
know said more about it and discussed it
more but I knew I couldn&#39;t and I knew
that young fellow who is sharing us was
really really overstepping his bounds at
that point I felt that he he just needed
somebody to talk to he couldn&#39;t he
hadn&#39;t discussed it couldn&#39;t discuss it
and he wasn&#39;t he wasn&#39;t doing it for any
ulterior motive other than the fact that
I think he was he had the weight of this
thing on him and it was distressing to
him whitish disc totally silent
apparently flying extremely fast and it
had a bluish light on top on the apex it
was that bluish color that you get in
art welding and that was coming on
rhythmically so as it went across the
sky you could say it&#39;s coming on there
gotta come on there gotta come on there
