 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Psyche (W. H. Harrison)</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Psyche.
 1882â€”1882  Monthly
 London, England.  Editor: William Henry Harrison.
 Succeeds: Spiritualist Newspaper
 21/1, March 1882 (no. 493)-21/3, May 1882 (no. 495). 
 Volume numbering continues that of The Spiritualist Newspaper which it succeeds.  Harrison started this short-lived venture after the collapse of The Spiritualist.  The name change reflected the fact that (as the editor explained) many scholars were reluctant to associate their interests and studies with a journal so closely tied to "spiritualism." See "Die neue 'Psyche' in London und die Himalaya-Bruder," Psychische Studien 9/4 (April 1882): 182-183.  LOC; National Library of Scotland.
