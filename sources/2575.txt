Foreword
The Need of the Times
WITH
all the material inventions and miracu
lous mechanical progress of the present day,
there is an appalling lack of knowledge or convic
tion concerning spiritual truths. These talks have
been called forth because of that need, in the hope
of answering the cry of some burdened heart.
The papers are short so that they may be easily
read and assimilated. Let the words sink deep into
consciousness. Memorize lines that appeal to you.
Read night and morning if you can, certainly at
night before you go to bed. If you can fall asleep
with some of these thoughts uppermost, you will
so impress the subconscious that inspiration will
come to you from that great reservoir and you will
see a change for the better in all the conditions
affecting you most closely.
We have spoken the word with power and know
that it will not return to us void. Take the word
into your own life and lift your experiences from
barrenness to beauty. So be it!

"Awake, Arise, and Sing!"
IN
these troubled times the world needs joy, the
joy of knowledge that life and love are eternal,
that the only thing that counts is character. With
this conviction and the realization that God's will
must be done in the beyond and on earth, we can
face our own future and the future of the world
with confidence. Without this conviction we are
lost in the mists of ignorance and despair.
These papers are intended to throw light on
man's problems and destiny. There can be nothing
new to those who have truly grasped the Christ
teachings, but for those who have wandered afar
off or those who are crushed by overwhelming loss
and its resulting hopelessness there is a definite
message. Too many consider themselves too busy
to study the truths of the Spirit, little knowing
how these truths simplify life and lift burdens
from human shoulders. In short, for most people
today a rekindling of faith must come.
We sleep in ignorance and doubt. We dread the
morning light which calls us to another day of
dreariness and despair. Our eyes have lost the vi
sion without which we perish. Things must come to
a crisis when the world has gone so far away from
the plan for humanity. After the crisis, health
may be restored.

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
These talks round out the harmony of a new
day. First we must awake, open our eyes to truth ;
then we must arise, to the full stature of man;
then spontaneously the heart will sing as the false
shadows vanish into the nothingness from which
they came. In the dawn of creation the stars sang
together. With the melody in the awakened heart
will blend the voices of that majestic chorus, the
chorus of Alleluias to the risen Lord.

The Message of Creation
THIS
seems a subject entirely too great to be
condensed into a page or two. But the greatest
ideas in life are always the simplest, just as the
truly great people are always the least compli
cated. They are usually men or women with one
consuming gift or purpose to which all their en
ergies are directed. Is not Unity the essence of
simplicity ? It is of this Unity, the underlying mes
sage of Creation, of which we wish to speak.
Veiled by the mists of Sense and Matter, the
Truth lies hidden, but it has never been hidden to
the great Seers. In all material and concrete mani
festations their inner vision has beheld the radi
ant, Divine center. Science is gradually catching
up with the mystics. Even stone has been proved
to be thrilling, pulsating Life, the molecules in
motion. So St. Francis could call the birds and
beasts his little brothers because in each living
thing —and all things are filled with vibratory life
—he could recognize the spark which truly makes
"Nature's social union." Is this not the secret of
the lion's lying down with the lamb and the little
child who leads them? If there were no ignorance
of this vital truth, with the consequent fear and
hate which come from ignorance, there would be
no discord or danger in the world today. We should

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
re-enter the garden of Eden. The promised Golden
Age would return. God's will would actually be
done on earth as it is in Heaven, for earth and
Heaven would become one in consciousness.
If we would stop for a moment to analyze very
simply this vital truth of God in all His creation,
we should catch glimpses of the joy such a realiza
tion implies. We should cease our worry about
many things; we should literally cast our burden
on the Lord, as we have been told to do ; we should
be like the lilies of the field, drinking in the free
wine of dew, air, and sunlight; we should be cen
ters of radiant peace, stilling the tumult of our
environment. Can you visualize a day without
worry, hurry, sorrow, pain, regret? The burden
of Atlas would drop from our bent and aching
shoulders. The Master Self would take control,
bringing us only our best good.
But, no, the world hugs its misery and plunges
headlong into suffering. Eventually we find our
way back, but meanwhile so many unnecessary
tears, so many crushed and despairing hearts!
The secret of Creation is the Divine Essence
within all forms, the true and indestructible Self
of the form created, the God-Pattern. Brood over
this as God brooded over the waters. Results will
follow in the healing of your soul and in the radi
ant transformation of your life.

"Open, Sesame!"
YOU
remember the story of the magic words
that opened the treasure cave. You recall the
ecstasy of your childish thrills when the hidden
wealth stood revealed. How often in this strange
world with its bitter-sweet draughts of pleasure
and of pain do we long for a magic word to solve
our problems, open closed doors, reveal long-
sought riches of joy, hope, beauty, abundance,
love.
These treasures are waiting for those who have
the courage to try the experiment. Do you think
you could live for a whole day during which no
sad or negative thought crossed your mind ? Could
you actually build for your soul "a wider room
With windows to open and let in the sun
And the breeze of the world blowing through?"
Could you make a practice of thanking God each
morning for a beautiful day, and then seeing only
beauty in that day?
Work with the power of constructive imagina
tion. We are told we are made in the image and
likeness of God. We don't now understand just
what that means. But no one who thinks at all can
picture the vast Creative Power as other than
beauty, abundance, strength, perfection. Try giv
ing this unseen Force a chance. Build your perfect

world, live in it, see
it,
admit only beauty in your
thought realm.
As Glad said in dingy Apple Blossom Court,
iJUt may be lies, but it's cheerful lies as 'elps yer."
Even her mite of faith was blessed a thousand
fold. You remember her story in "The Dawn of
a
Tomorrow?"
The great storehouse of abundance
is
waiting
f^fii for the magic of Faith. "Believe and ye shall re
ceive." Transform your daily round by the rose
radiance of your fondest dreams. Picture the love
liness your soul craves. We belong to a universe of
beauty did we but know it. We are in a realm of
beauty could we but see it.
At first this may take an effort of will, especi
ally for those who have most of their lives looked
on the dark side. We shall have to return to
those childhood days when imagination played un
checked and we actually were what we pretended
to be.
"Faith's a fact. It isn't a mere word. It's
a
live
wire straight from omnipotence," some one has
said.
Faith
is
in truth
a
magnet which draws from
the great etheric storehouse the treasure waiting
there for the use of all humanity. Constructive
imagination, the realization that we are children
of the King—these are the "Open Sesame."
Can you try the experiment? Look for trouble
and you certainly will find it. Why not look for

joy, beauty, the gifts that belong to you as a part

Perhaps one of our greatest regrets when we
reach the other shore will be the realization that
we played the part of the pauper when we really
are the prince. The world needs joy, beauty, sun
shine. How tragic to have missed, not only for our
selves but for those whose lives we touch, the glory
from which we came and to which we return !

The Call of the Unseen
ON
the surface this is a strange combination of
words, somewhat unintelligible; but it has
deep meaning. To those immersed in the affairs
of a material world, deep in their own personal
worries and responsibilities, the unseen is the least
of their considerations. It is therefore difficult for
them to hear its call. We are all, however, intent
on a bell to summon us to the telephone if we are
expecting a message. In moments of lonely relaxa
tion we often long for the sound of a beloved voice
and sometimes hear it calling us. Unfortunately
most of our waking hours are given over to con
crete sounds and images. Only the poets, philos
ophers, artists and musicians keep their inner eyes
and ears open. We might include in their dis
tinguished company a few rare scientists.
What is this Unseen? It is hard to describe to
those imprisoned in the walls of a self-centered,
three dimensional world. You must envision it
with the eye of faith. All that is loveliest and best,
the most perfect beauty you have ever known, the
truest friends you have ever had, the fondest hopes
you have ever cherished, the greatest ideals your
mind can grasp—all these are a small part of the
Unseen.
In what way does the call come ? What is its pur
pose? When you are attuned to those vibrations
which are in harmony with the great symphony

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
of the universe, the call comes in multitudinous
ways : nature, people, books, life experiences. The
important point is that you be able to register it
and answer in an immediate electrical response.
The purpose is not only to lift you in your own
development and help you master your own per
sonal problems ; but far more important than this
the whole tempo of the world is quickened. You
remember the metaphors of the salt and the
candle. "Ye are the salt of the earth. . . Ye are
the light of the world. A town built on a mountain-
top cannot be hidden." Even one small light may
start a conflagration.
A simple illustration to make the title clear is
the touching story of the child, Samuel, who
waited for the Unseen to call. "Speak, Lord; for
Thy servant heareth." We are few of us so highly
developed that we can approach the purity of this
sensitive young instrument. Yet in our own way
we can answer to the call of Beauty, Perfection,
the Ideal ; and as time passes, our receiving appa
ratus will become more and more sensitive until
higher and higher planes can reach us.
What dignity and grace enfold a life so dedica
ted! What a blessing to the world is such an in
strument, however humble! Automatically clouds
lift; ugliness vanishes; and the tragic star of
Earth becomes brighter as its note in the chord
of Creation blends more harmoniously into the
universal chorus. Watch for the call in your own
heart.

The Unseen Universe
IT
is difficult for those encased in physical bodies
in a material world to picture the truth of a
universe visible to those in the encircling sphere
but invisible to those whose eyes are holden. The
scriptures tell us of the "cloud of witnesses." They
also mention various superphysical gifts : the gift
of healing, the gift of prophecy, the ability to see
visions and dream dreams,—in short, the power
to contact that finer, more spiritual world encir
cling and interpenetrating this earth we know so
well.
The telescope and the microscope have helped
to make plain objects beyond and below the normal
range of vision. The radio has helped to emphasize
the truth of waves in the ether. But no instrument
has yet been devised to convey vibrations from one
world to another. The only instrument we now
know is the brain of man, and a nervous system
especially attuned to register thought waves sent
by others in the body and out of it.
There is a definite message in the unseen, a
message of hope, the certainty of continuity, the
reality of the force called prayer, the waves of
love and longing which interpenetrate the worlds.
So many are today being sent suddenly from the
physical body that it is becoming a vital necessity

to restore to humanity the faith that rests on
knowledge. Too many insist on feeling the wounds
in the hands and side. Too few are ready to accept
with conviction that which having not seen they
believe.
Our instruments are "jangled, out of tune, and
harsh." A jazz-crazed world knows not the moun
tain silence, the morning stars, the musical mes
sage of the winds. We are out of tune with the
rhythm of Nature, which might play upon the
harp of our own being and make us sensitive in
struments to the call of the unseen. A whole uni

open their ears that they may hear and their
hearts that they may understand.

The Cloud of Witnesses
E pass over this phrase as inconsequential
» » when in reality it is one of the most vital in
human experience. Guardian angels, be they ever
so humble, are common. Look back over your own
life to moments of protection, unexpected chivalry,
ready help. If we could see these invisible min
isters we should be lifted up above the common
round of every day and never doubt again the
eternal verities, which remain the same whether
we know them consciously or not.
Once upon a time a soul was lonely in heaven;
so to give her work she was sent to guard a youth
in a great city. Now it happened that this person
had fine possibilities but one weakness. This weak
ness was the flaw in an otherwise perfect armor.
"What can I do? How can I help?" With this
unselfish cry in her heart the lonely angel forgot
her loneliness and stayed patiently by.
Time and again she intervened to stave off dis
aster. Then when the danger was over, she re
turned, unknown and unthanked, to ask for an
other assignment.
Service is the law of Spirit.
"Thousands at His bidding speed,
And post o'er land and ocean without rest."
You feel you are alone, friendless. You never made

a greater mistake. If you could only put your ma
terial world where it belongs, realizing you are
making but a temporary sojourn away from your
true home, and then raise your consciousness to
the spiritual level where you belong, you would
know the truth of the "cloud of witnesses."
Gates unlock before them. Walls become trans
parent. Loving arms enfold you in warm embrace.
If you would only open your eyes to see, your ears
to hear, your heart to understand !
"He shall give His angels charge over thee,
to keep thee in all thy ways."
There is a condition, however. Man must first
recognize that he is a spiritual being and raise his
thought to that level. The SOS that is not sent
cannot be answered. First must come the desire,
the prayer, the faith, then gratitude which knows
help is unfailing, however dark the night.

The Invisible Made Visible
E have grown so accustomed to the tele-
» » scope, the microscope, the X ray that we
forget the miracle of their invention. Before man
had them to use he knew nothing of far-off plan
ets, nebulae, and spectra; he knew nothing of
germs, toxins, and anti-toxins; he knew nothing
of hidden growths within the body, misplace
ments, and other causes of disease and pain. Now
science has unfolded a great panorama where once
was a blank wall.
Even so, we are still going through life with
blinkers on. Some are near-sighted, some far-
sighted, some color-blind ; but worse than that, the
eyes and ears of the soul are closed. So much
beauty on every hand, so many melodies, so much
vivid color and perfume, so much loveliness —and
we cannot see, hear, touch, or smell it. All these
finer senses are there, waiting to be developed.
We read sometimes of one who has been blind
from birth and who suddenly by just the right
operation at the right time opens his eyes and
sees. To such the world seems strange and new, in
part perhaps painful in some of the ugliness which
before had been blissfully hidden to the eyes of
the imagination. This very real invisible world,
however, of which we are speaking has for the

pure soul only delightful surprises, ecstatic
glimpses of perfect loveliness.
How can the invisible be made visible? First,
you must believe it is there, surrounding your
world, interpenetrating it. Then you must make
time every day to commune with it in prayer, and
meditation upon eternal truths. The importance
of this communion cannot be overestimated. Your
life here, however busy, is short and fleeting.
There is nothing you can take with you except
yourself. Is it not well worth the effort to prepare
for the change which all must make? Such a
happy change, too, for those who love truth and
beauty, and await with joy reunion with their
nearest and dearest.
This reunion is possible here and now. There are
no barriers to love in this world or the next or be
tween the worlds. To the eye of faith, to the lov
ing heart, the so-called invisible, which is all
around us waiting for recognition, can become the
visible, only in fleeting glimpses perhaps, but still
glimpses so real that we know the truth and cast
aside our doubts forevermore.
A world waits for recognition as truly as did
the western continent wait for its Columbus, its
Balboa, its Magellan. Love calls, and to that call
Love answers.

Radio Reception
IF
you turn the knob on a radio, touching dif
ferent stations for a minute or so, you realize
the wide variety of waves permeating space. Jokes,
prayers, jazz, concert music —all varieties of hu
man thought and emotion make their way into the
atmosphere. What a revelation of etheric trans
mission !
Our receiving sets must be properly attuned if
we are to make the most of this mystery called life.
Strange and variable the moods of humanity! If
we are badly out of tune ourselves we may vi
brate a veritable poison, which, infringing on the
sensitive consciousness of another, may add its
cumulative power to a mood already desperate and
drive that poor unfortunate completely over the
precipice. Or lifted to a plane of lofty thought, we
may still the troubled waters around us and radi
ate life and power, giving new hope to the depress
ed and peace where most needed.
Grave, indeed, is the responsibility of human
radio transmitters, both for sending and receiv
ing. Just as one discordant element can break up
a family or any social unit, the right attitude can
quench the flames of smoldering resentment and
save the situation before real disaster breaks. Vi
brations lifted high enough can open our inner eyes

and ears to a world of beauty and enchantment.
With such vision we are never quite the same
again, however deeply we may sink back into the
material world. Moments of recollection flash when
least expected. We know because we have seen
and heard.
In a world intended to be beautiful why vibrate
to the ugly? Even if we have to raise ourselves
by our boot-straps, we should make the effort. Just
as we turn off an offending radio program and
try for something more to our taste, so we can
exclude from our stream of consciousness the ig
noble and the discordant. For us it need not exist.
In the real essence of things it does not exist any
way. Like all illusion, the ugly passes and only
beauty remains, for beauty is eternal in the
heavens.
Slow ofttimes and painful is the adjustment of
our human radio. But how vital for our progress
and well-being! Will you be a cesspool or a foun
tain, a pawnshop or a shrine, a curse or a blessing?
The choice is yours.

The Ladder of Dreams
HOW
little we realize when we lie down to rest
at night that we are partly released from the
physical world to wander for a brief time in a
plane a little nearer to Reality for those whose
hearts are pure and whose souls are at least partly
awakened. I refer to the Dream World wherein
visions come and memories may be carried back to
waking consciousness.
This Dream World has many aspects. It may be
a realm of beauty or of foreboding. It may harbor
promises of life or conceal the poisons of death.
To those who pass its portals must come guides to
take the wayfarers safely above the morasses and
hidden dangers.
A sensitive soul in whom the spiritual nature
is awakening often catches glimpses of future
events. The impressions carried back into the
waking consciousness should be strictly followed.
Such forewarnings are priceless to those blest with
such prevision. These glimpses of truth should be
remembered and obeyed.
At all times and in all places men have been
warned in dream and vision. Joseph interpreted
the years of plenty and of famine and acted ac
cordingly. If our minds and hearts were centered
on things above we could avoid many pitfalls. But

The Chemistry of Thought
IN
the forefront of scientific discovery and
achievement stand the chemists, whose marvel
ous findings too often, alas, are used for destruc
tion rather than for construction. All great forces
are two-edged swords, depending on their use. Un
happily there may be perversion of Good or God,
and so we have evil or the devil. But we must
never forget the all-Good. In its ultimate analysis
all is good—God. We return to the Father, each
in his own way, following his own Karma or Fate,
for which he alone is responsible.
"Through faith we understand that the worlds
were framed by the word of gods, or messengers
of God, so that things which are seen were not
made of things which do appear." In this marvel
ous realm of thought whence all begins and from
which all things emanate we find the ether of sub
stance. In vibratory attunement are the minds of
men. We are told in the scriptures to think only
those thoughts which are true, honest, just, pure,
lovely, and of good report. There is a definite and
vital reason for this advice, for we attract to our
selves conditions corresponding to our thoughts.
Why build a prison-house, a dungeon, in which to
walk "benighted under the mid-day sun" when the

the sunlight, the fragrance of flowers, and all the
perfection of beauty in a universe which should
be a garden of Eden and can be again? Man has
only to return to his true Self and by the power of
that Selfhood transform his personal desert into
a veritable garden in which his God may walk
in the cool of the day.
Do you not realize how all is regulated by
thought? Thoughts of sickness never made any
one well or happy; thoughts of poverty never
brought any one into a land of plenty. On the con
trary, our very fear creates the adverse condition
we would avoid, and we are plunged into countless
miseries of our own making.
Will you not believe that Divine Love intends
you to be happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise? All
parents wish only the best for their children and
bend all their energies to that end. Would our
Father-Mother God be any less concerned about
us than our earthly parents? He has implanted in
us a spark of His own God-fire. He has given us
free will whereby to raise ourselves from the mire
to the stars. Thought is the key. Through our
spiritual radio we can attune ourselves to any sta
tion we wish to contact. The thought first, then
the form!

of the no where into the here, and again
into the no where! Yet strangely enough, "no
where" easily becomes "now here." The omni
present Eternal! Our life on earth is a part of a
much greater whole the beginning and the end of
which we cannot see. But the present is very much
our job.
What is the "stuff that dreams are made on?"
The tapestry of life is woven on the loom of
thought. Thought is the stuff-substance of which
life and dreams are made. Eventually if the
thought is held long enough it takes material form.
How important, then, to guard our thoughts and
turn them into channels of beauty. In the hands
of the weaver the tapestry grows day by day. It
may be perfect. It may be spoiled by imperfections.
The essential is the loveliness of the pattern, how
ever crossed by mistakes. Some of the weaving
must be ripped out and done again. The pattern
must be firmly held in mind and patiently followed.

rainbow-colored in the moonlight. Tragic is a soul
from whom dreams are gone.
"Our little life is rounded with a sleep." On a
hard path the years are long. Tears dim the way
and blind is the going. Few escape crosses and dis
appointments. If we only knew
it,
however, we
have the choice of fabrics and designs. The weav
ing, too,
is
our responsibility. It may be careless
or perfect, ugly or beautiful, according to our
dreams, our thought patterns. This so-called sleep
from which we come and to which we go may be
the most intense activity. It behooves us to direct
well our lives that we may enter the beyond with
a
consciousness rich in noble thoughts and deeds,
ready for wider usefulness of untrammeled activ
ity as God directs.
"Where there
is
no vision, the people perish."
Where there are no dreams the heart dies. We
come, "trailing clouds of glory." Why go beaten
and broken? Hold fast to the dreams of which
beauty is made. They are the warp and the woof
for the tapestry of life,
a
tapestry long in the
making, coexistent with each human soul.

The Song of Songs
TO
him who is in tune with the Divine harmony
the song of Creation is revealed. It sings in his
innermost being. It attunes him to higher worlds
in which the planets move in majestic rhythm as
the morning stars sing together and the redeemed
chant their hymns around the throne of God.
Nothing has the power to link the worlds as has
music. It raises the rate of vibration in worried,
material human thoughts. It attracts angelic lis
teners from higher planes. They can always visit
us though our way to them is barred by our own
ignorance and indifference. "On the wings of
song" —how true the metaphor!
The song of songs is the melody within, the har
mony in immortal souls, which encased in "this
muddy vesture of decay" we cannot hear. The
stars in their courses sing to the "young-eyed
cherubins." The music deep within the heart re
echoes this heavenly harmony; but we, troubled
about many things, are deaf to both melodies.
Still the song is there, fulfilling its own nature.
Joyous, vibrant, ever rhythmic, life should move
on in harmony with the chord of Creation.
But does it? Before the ear can hear it must
have lost its sensitiveness to the outer world. Only

ment can we center on the rhythm within, which
beats in time to the cosmic rhythm. Then we can
listen to the "song of life," meditate upon it, and
"learn from it the lesson of harmony."
How vital the law of rhythm: intake and out
flow of the breath, the beating of the heart, the
procession of the seasons, day and night, waking
and sleeping, life and death. With no volition on
our part Nature proceeds on her rhythmic march.
Why not listen to that magic music as the Great
Mother lulls her children to sleep, bringing them
the outer stillness which releases the inner har
mony and makes possible renewed activity.
Can we not, however, find this perfect rhythm
in waking consciousness? Can we not still the
outer self and release the soul power within ? Then
truly shall we "mount up with wings as eagles;
we shall run, and not be weary ; we shall walk and
not faint."
The song of songs, waiting to be discovered by
each for himself in his own heart !

The Continuity of Life
IN
spite of all the evidence in the scriptures, in
spite of all the poets and philosophers, in spite
of every cry of the human heart, there are still
those who say there is no life beyond. To them
three score years and ten are all that is—all the
sorrows, suffering, disappointment, despair gone
through in vain ! How can people deny the truth of
a life undying—a continuity which gives the an
swer to all the puzzles, a reason for all the ap
parent injustice? If this one earth-life were all
there is, frankly the game would not be worth the
candle.
To love and never meet again the ones we love,
never to have the chance to make good, to undo
mistakes, to heal old wounds, to show regret, to
put our arms around our dear ones and ask for
giveness! How can any one from whose sight a
beloved face has gone harbor such a blasphemy as
the belief that this world is all there is, in a crazy
scheme of things which has no meaning.
On the contrary, the scheme is not crazy. It has
a profound meaning. The long ascent of man is
more than the journey from the cradle to the
grave. Eons have gone into his making and eons
more will pass before he is perfected, whether here

mansions" in the Father's house. Graduation from
the school of so-called life is a long and painful
process, with many set-backs.
How could one in a mere seventy years complete
all the lessons, correct all the errors, and feel, "It
is finished." Far from life's having finished, it has
only just begun as a new day of the soul dawns.
Spring follows winter, dawn the dark. The mystery
of the rebirth of Nature in the spring, the majesty
of the sunrise as its glow spreads behind the moun
tains—are these not perfect analogies? Greatest
of all, however, is the cry of love, a cry of power
ful that it pierces even the veil and opens glimpses
into something far better than we have ever
known.
The true mystics have the answer. It is a risen
Lord they seek. In the simple things of every day,
in our thoughts and prayers, with our roses and
candles, we are sending into the unseen wireless
waves of love and longing, waves that register and
return with healing in their wake.
No death—only transition! The dropping of an
outworn garment to function in robes of beauty!
The butterfly leaves the dark cocoon; each soul
has its chance. The low-vaulted past" is left with
the past, where it belongs, as deathless man builds
new chambers, wider rooms, until at last he is
free. "I will make him who is victorious a pillar
in the temple of my God and he shall never lose
his place there."

The Way of Life
"T AM the way, the truth, and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father, but by me." These
are difficult words for those who do not understand
the mystery of Being. We are far more complex
than we realize. The outer man apparently so over
shadows the inner in the minds of most people that
they do not even think of the only permanent
entity,—the invisible, spiritual creation of the
God-Head. The words of Christ show the way to
the only life worthy of the name, the only lasting
and real of all our experiences. We so identify our
selves with this world that the material seems the
sum total of existence.
What is this way of which Our Lord speaks?
The way of the Spirit, the Christ in man. This
alone leads to the fountain of all Spirit, the orig
inal Source, the Father. We are one with Him, He
in us and we in Him. This realization of abundant
life comes only through a change in consciousness,
the second birth so-called, a quickening of the in
ner Higher Self. We must become vibration con
scious. The moment we realize that our "mind is a
center of Divine operation, opening up ever bigger
and better conditions," that moment we enter the
way of the Christ consciousness.

come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money ;
come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and
milk without money and without price." Again, as
did the woman of Samaria, we hear the immortal
invitation : "Whosoever drinketh of the water that
I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water
that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
springing up into everlasting life." Figuratively
we crawl along the ground with our faces to the
dust when we could mount up with wings as of
eagles.
Is it not time to find this Christ center and iden
tify ourselves with the only sane purpose of living?
So many opportunities lost ! So much ignorance and
suffering! "Know thyself" was the ancient teach
ing ; use the Christ center and thereby develop the
fruits of the Spirit. This is the way of true life;
all other roads lead to bitter disappointment and
tragic futility. Begin now to focus your whole
being in the Christ consciousness. Thereby you
will find peace, security, serenity. Your eyes will
see, your ears hear, your heart rejoice. "Where I

The Wisdom of the Ages
ALONG
the corridors of Time have walked a
few silent initiates who through sacrifice and
devotion attained the heights. Ever ready to pass
on the light of Truth to those whose hearts were
prepared, they gave their priceless knowledge and
went their way onward and upward. Sometimes
the love of bewildered humanity brought them
again to this material world, a sacrifice great in
deed for those who have attained.
The penalty of knowledge is misunderstanding.
Those in advance of their time have ever been re
viled and persecuted even unto death. The failure
of their mission was not theirs. "He did not many
mighty works there because of their unbelief."
Ever sacred in the archives of the universe has
reposed the ancient Wisdom, waiting to be tapped
by those who know the way. It is no light obliga
tion to receive this knowledge, for the giver is
responsible for the series of effects set in motion
by those to whom the truth is entrusted. Untouch
ed by the upheavals of humanity, unchanged by
the procession of the centuries, the ancient Wis
dom remains waiting for the few who have earned
the right to know and to pass it on for the even

The Reality of Spirit
TO
men whose eyes are blinded by the material
world the reality of spirit seems fantastic.
"How can that be real which I can not see,
touch, taste, smell or feel?" queries the skeptic.
How indeed to him? But what about others
whose inner senses are beginning to function?
How explain the fleeting fragrance, the symbolic
dream, the flash of intuition, the world of inven
tion, the inspiration of the artist, the voice of con
science, the power of love? We all recognize the
evidence of these intangible contacts with higher
or inner realms of being. But why are most human
beings so dead to the world of reality?
For that is what Spirit is, the one and only
Reality. All material things change. Look at our
physical bodies: the weakness of the infant, the
strength of maturity, the helplessness of age—a
complete cycle—but not such a cycle for the spirit.
It returns to its homeland, rich in experience,
awakened and purified by suffering and sorrow,
strengthened by its sojourn in a place to which by
its very nature it does not belong but which can
and usually does serve as a school. The far coun
try of the prodigal son with its husks, its swine,
its dregs of disappointment sends us back to our

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
true and only home, the bosom of our Father, the
realm of undying Spirit.
It is difficult indeed to detach ourselves from the
impacts pressing upon the five senses, the currents
of average human thought, though the very fact
that thought is vibratory, the miraculous power
of the radio, should prove beyond the shadow of a
doubt the reality of the invisible realm which is
our rightful home, the home from which we came
and to which we return, bringing our sheaves or
our tares with us.
The time will come when even the man in the
street through the development of certain centers
in the brain will know the unseen as the seen, the
unreal as the real. But spiritual values cannot be
recognized until man knows himself as the spirit
ual being he in truth is. So long as he wants only
the material he will see only the material. So long
as he chooses to shut himself up in a world of five
senses, just so long will he stay there. It takes the
shock of suffering, of loss, of bitter pain and dis
illusionment to free us from the fetters of earth-
bound existence. Our will is free. We build our own
confines.
But in the long range, which is vital to our
true well-being, the material or the spiritual, the
ephemeral or the eternal, illusion or reality? On
our choice depends the issue of many lives.

Mind Over Matter
BOTH
mind and matter are necessary to expres
sion in the physical world. They are the rider
and the horse, the rider needing his horse to make
the journey, the horse needing the control of the
rider to reach his appointed destination. Notice,
however, the importance of the guiding hand of
the rider.
In this journey through the limitations of earth
the mind is more important than we realize, for
while some limitations are more or less fixed by
the scheme of things we may overcome many more
than we now believe possible. No one need live in
a narrow room, shut out from sunlight and air,
if he wills a more stately abode.
We have many authentic cases where mind has
overcome physical illness. The will to live, the
abiding love for dear ones who need us, the utter
refusal to let go may bring one back when the
gates of this world seem almost to have closed
upon the earthly journey.
It is of a still greater importance of mind that
we wish to speak. The Divine spark within man
that makes him man, the overshadowing Power
that guides him every step of the way in spite of
his mistakes and unnecessary detours into swamps
and morasses, this dynamo of energy which makes

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
no mistakes and can, if properly used, work mir
acles—this is the great Mind over matter in which
man must find his center. Then to him a whole
new world is possible —a world of light, beauty,
harmony, accomplishment for the race of which
he is a part.
All the great workers of the world have con
sciously or unconsciously tuned in on this great
magnetic field of spiritual energy and power, this
storehouse of knowledge —past, present and to
come. The poet catches the poem which is to en
kindle those hearts ready to receive it; the musi
cian hears the melodies which are to lift thou
sands out of their lower selves into a realm of
beauty ; the artist catches a vision and crystallizes
the fleeting dream of loveliness in color and form
on his canvas; the lover, the mother, the father
suddenly knows in a flash of intuition that the
glory of love is sacrifice, the utter forgetfulness of
self in the well-being of the one beloved. Thus the
Divine Mind over and within us broods upon the
surface of the waters of materiality, and when the
time is ripe, a new hour strikes for a rebirth, the
true birthday of the soul when it is born again of
water and the Spirit to become "God-centered."
Then through the vehicle of a human body the
great light of Infinite Mind flows unimpeded, and
the race rises be it ever so little on its long, spiral
course of spiritual unfoldment. Mind over matter !
What glorious possibilities await us!

The Pressure of the Multitude
EMERSON
praises the man who in the midst of
the crowd can keep the independence of soli
tude. What weaklings we are—reeds trembling in
the lightest breeze ! Unlike the "lordly cedar, green
with boughs," when we go down we leave no "lone
some place against the sky." On the contrary we
are not even missed—one of the multitude where
countless thousands stand to take our insignificant
place.
Instead of having our own thoughts we re-echo
the meaningless ideas of others. Like sponges we
absorb the radio, the cinema, the propaganda of
the printed page, and give no heed to the voice of
Truth crying in the wilderness of our wasted lives.
Only so many hours in the day, so many days in
the week, so many weeks in the year, so many
years to make or mar this fabric which we call
our own! What have we to show for the hectic
rush, the feverish days and nights? Nothing! A
precious gift lost!
Meantime Truth is ours for the asking: "Seek
and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened un
to you." But we must leave the crowd if we would
hear the still, small voice. We must shut the door
on the noisy distractions of the outer court if we
would find the peace of the upper room.

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
"Many loved Truth, and lavished life's best oil
Amid the dust of books to find her,
Content at last, for guerdon of their toil,
With the cast mantle she hath left behind
her."
Other men's thoughts, hopes, dreams, visions—
good in their way if noble and lofty—but why de
pend on others, even so select a company, when
there is a direct short-cut if one will only believe
that within his own heart lies the answer to every
problem.
"Know thyself" was the ancient teaching. Seek
within, not without. In the throng, but not of it,
untouched by the confused vibrations of the
crowd, tune in to the melodies of the inner radio,
tap the Christ-force which is ours for the asking.
So make your way amid the multitude, and un
known to yourself you will be a benediction. When
you have passed, to some at least it will seem
"like the ceasing of exquisite music."
The dominance of the world! What a tragedy!
"No room in the inn" when the things that matter
most are crowded out and the empty days go by,
the gift of life wasted, the puzzle of the agony
unsolved !

The Twilight of the Soul
DAWN
and dusk are two mystic hours in the
twenty-four. It is as if heaven and earth
drew together in communion when the sun rises
above the eastern mountains and sinks from view
on the western horizon. In these moments it is
easier to attune to the unseen and grasp the hands
held out to us in wordless love.
The twilight of the soul is not the twilight of
the gods. On the contrary, it is perhaps the most
vital period in a human life, that period when the
shadows deepen, the rush of work is over, and one
more day or incarnation approaches its close. At
this time memory makes a circle of events. Child
hood days return ; youth and manhood pass before
the inner vision. Happenings fall into proper re
lationship. We see the meaning of much that
puzzles us. We know we are nearing a safe har
bor, sure repose, and peace at the last. "In the
sunlit path of the setting sun" we walk secure, as
the shadows of twilight cover the purple hills.
This review of the panorama of the past pre
pares us for the future. We see our mistakes, rec
ognize the causes of our failures and build in a
soul strength which will make us immune to that
particular weakness again.
Peaceful is the twilight. The busy world is si

The Creative Power of Being
WE
have heard of the creative power of
thought. We know that thoughts external
ize in concrete form. We begin to realize "There's
nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it
so." Few, however, know that the very act of exist
ing carries with it creative power.
The reason for this is very simple. We are parts
of a whole, little worlds in a universe. We are
made of the One Substance, a creative substance,
without which there would be no expression in
form whatever. This creative substance, or so-
called subconscious mind, eventually determines
the conditions, good or bad, in which we find our
selves. The astonishing thing, however, is that we
make our own circumstances by the very act of
being.
Instead, then, of the conception of puppets
pulled by the strings of fate, substitute the noble
realization that each human being is the master
of his destiny, the captain of his soul. We create
our own conditions. The tragedy in many a life is
its ignorance of its own power. By inverted think
ing of evil, failure, limitation, it creates these ex
periences, utterly unaware of its own divine re
sponsibilities. External environment becomes more
and more difficult and reacts on the thinker, caus

ing him to send out still darker thoughts of failure
and despair.
Rather than reasoning from the visible to the
invisible, we must reverse the process and begin
with the invisible or the only Reality. This Reality
is perfect beauty, order, perfection, bliss. We must
cling to that truth as a drowning man clings to
the rope which is to haul him to safety. Begin
with the perfect pattern in the invisible, hold it,
know it as the only truth, and by your faith bring
it into manifestation. In this way you use the cre
ative power of being as it exists in the Creative
Intelligence.
By knowing ourselves a part of this great Power
and letting it work in, through, and for us, we
reach a fulfillment of our individual lives in a way
that would be utterly impossible if we had only
ourselves to depend on. In other words, we must
let God work for us, the God in us, who is standing
at the door, awaiting our recognition. The most
powerful of friends, the source of infinite supply,
the essence of joy and ecstasy is ever with us to
take the direction of our misdirected lives into His
keeping. It remains for us to make the contact, to
tap this great reservoir of creative force so that
our own experience may move in harmony with
its resplendent beauty.

The Power Behind the Throne
IN
the strange chances of life some seem to have
everything in their favor, others are constantly
battling adverse odds. On the surface there is ap
parently no justice, but in reality a fundamental
law is at work. The Power behind the throne, the
Spirit, sees that for our growth certain experi
ences are absolutely necessary. If we have had an
easy time in past lives, we must expand our con
sciousness to include another kind of experience,
where grinding toil for daily bread builds in a
backbone instead of a wishbone. If we have been
strong and well, we must know physical handicaps
to build in patience and sympathy. Rapid changes
may come when progress is hastened and much
can be assimilated in a short time.
The point is, it makes little difference funda
mentally what happens to us but it makes all the
difference in the world how we take what hap
pens. The past makes our present; our attitude
towards the present is the free will which deter
mines our future. The Power behind the throne
stands ready to help us lift ourselves in conscious
ness to the point where we can transcend our diffi
culties and develop through trials to a higher
stature of manhood and womanhood. "Whom the

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
Lord loveth He chasteneth," or to use the words of
Robert Browning,
"Then, welcome each rebuff
That turns earth's smoothness rough,
Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go !
Be our joys three-parts pain !
Strive, and hold cheap the strain ;
Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge
the throe!"
In another way the Spirit is active, namely
when an individual through consecrated effort and
utter forgetfulness of the personal self accom
plishes great and lasting good for the world. It
behooves such a one to know that it is the Power
behind the throne, or Spirit, that is at work. Then
true humility comes, the humility of the worker
who knows the great underlying truths of life.
In short, we are spiritual beings on a long earth
pilgrimage, many of us still in the prison-house of
the material world. It is for us to decide by the
gift of free will whether we choose to remain be
hind bars or step out into the sunlight. The key to
open the heavy doors is in our hands if we but
knew it. With the recognition of our spiritual heri
tage comes freedom to enter the throne-room
where a great Power stands ready to use us for
vital work as princes in the household of the King.

The Secret of Success
MUCH
misunderstanding prevails as to the
meaning of the word, success. To most peo
ple it means money—the more money, the greater
the success. But to the man who knows, success
may be failure in the eyes of the world. King
Arthur in Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" was
apparently a failure. In the true sense, however,
he accomplished his mission. That his ideals were
too high for the people of his day had no effect on
the truth of those ideals. The failure was the
court's, not Arthur's. He must perforce return
whence he had come until the age was ready to
understand his mission. In a far deeper sense, the
same is true of all "the glorious company of the
Apostles, the goodly fellowship of the Prophets,
the noble army of Martyrs." The greatest example
of all is our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
First, then, we must have a true understanding
of the word, success. It is in its deepest sense
spiritual consciousness. If through the experiences
of life, our joys and sorrows, we can rise in the
scale we have succeeded. Nor does this imply sel
fish aspiration to achieve spirituality. The greatest
are those who serve, just for the joy of service.
The short cut, of course, is love; for with love, or

sympathetic understanding of all living things, we
instinctively serve with little or no thought of the
personal self.
It is vital in true success to establish contact
with the higher planes. The connection must be
kept, the channel being clear and unobstructed.
This is not easy in the pressure of modern life.
Destructive forces beat upon us, seeking entrance.
The radio receiving set of consciousness must be
kept in order, the dial tuned in to the higher vibra
tions. In this way a channel forms into which no
obstruction can enter. The work is not easy. Day
after day the will of the aspirant must be ready,
for it is through will we rise—the will to learn, to
do, and to be silent.
It is only after the change called death that
many learn the meaning of success and realize
what miserable failures their lives were, though
position, wealth, power, and great gifts in the eyes
of the world were theirs. Again, some patient,
simple soul in the so-called lower walks of life may
awake to the realization that on the higher planes
he has been a true success. It is the old story of
the rich man and the beggar, as told in the gospels.
If only a few grasp these essential truths, the
light grows stronger. The miracle of the spread of
the Christ teachings through a mere handful of
unlettered men is proof of this. The great plan for

White Magic
THE
term which connotes evil, Black Magic, is
more or less commonly known, but less is said
about its opposite, the magic that works for spirit
ual good. That there is what seems to be magic no
one doubts. These forces seem mysterious only be
cause we are not familiar with the laws that make
such action possible.
The miracles of our Lord were all based on laws
the operation of which man is not yet developed
enough to understand. The material world so sur
rounds us that we fail to realize that this apparent
physical density is interpenetrated by thousands
of vibrations unrecognized by man. The fact, how
ever, remains.
We have approached the threshold of these mys
teries in the discovery of wireless, thought trans
mission, radium, psychic phenomena, dreams. Yet
how little is known about the ether and the super-
conscious powers occasionally manifested in hu
man beings.
The root of many mysteries is the secret of
vibration and those unseen affinities and repul
sions which play upon the more or less sensitive
organism of the human mind. Intuitions, presenti
ments, foreknowledge, a whole realm of more or
less unexplored psychology is linked with these

vibratory waves which play unseen upon us, regis
tering if we are attuned to their rate or glancing
off unnoticed if the sensitive receiving set of our
consciousness responds to another key.
It is no accident that all the scriptures of the
world stress the need of lofty thought. "Whatso
ever things are true, whatsoever things are hon
est, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things
are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatso
ever things are of good report; if there be any
virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these
things." Through this white magic of thought we
make ourselves receiving sets for beauty, as a re
sult of which we transform not only our own lives
but radiate in increasing power an uplifting vibra
tion to the world we contact.
Not enough is made of this power of man's
mind. Too often is this great force used for sel
fishness and evil, attracting unseen aids in its own
destruction, as witness the witches in "Macbeth."
Angels are on call, too—bands of ministering
spirits, a multitude of witnesses. Far more power
ful are these vibrations for good, the true white
magic, which, given a chance, will transform a
world of ugliness into beauty. With love in the
heart, the problem is solved, for love thinketh no
evil. Raise the whole tenor of your thought, and
give white magic a chance to show its transform
ing power.

The Veil of Stars
HOW
strange to consider a veil of stars; yet
that is exactly the message of the heavens.
We think we see brilliant points of light in a field
of blue. In reality we see a glittering veil hiding
the mystery of creation.
In a single star is the secret of the universe.
First a cloudy mass, whirling rapidly until con
densed into vapor-like radiance; then the vapor
congealing into more solid form ; then the birth of
a constellation!
Man, too, a universe in himself! Spirit confined
in matter to return again to spirit —the tabernacle
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
It is well to look at the stars, to watch for re
curring friends and call them by name: glorious
Venus, star of evening; Orion in stately march
across the southern sky; the majestic Dipper in
the north; Sirius —a noble company. On a clear
night in pure country air a countless host of dia
monds fill the heavens.
"Forget-me-nots of the angels" —more than
that, the garment of God Himself! Our feeble vi
sion could not endure the brilliant glory of Divine
Majesty; we must see as through a veil until such
time as we ourselves, clothed in the white robes

The Heavenly Vision
"T was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision."
So spoke the great apostle Paul of his ex
perience on the road to Damascus.
For each human being there is a journey to
Damascus and a heavenly vision. Often, however,
the eyes and the ears are closed as the mind broods
over earthly cares and trivial worries. We follow
the road with gaze bent down on the dusty high
way. The forces of air, sunlight, and stars fall on
us unheeded as we plod with weary feet, our minds
a chaos of material cares.
How can we obey the heavenly vision if we do
not see or hear it? First must come the realization
that we have great powers within us, waiting to
unfold. Then must follow the steady will to let
nothing interfere with the development of our
higher life.
For most of us there is no glorious mission like
that of the apostle Paul, but for all there is work
to do. Even the consciousness of a spiritual reality
spreads like leaven in the lump of the world's ma
terialism. Today, especially, is such a realization
needed in a universe torn by strife and hatred.
Bent double "with toil and trouble," we catch
wicked whispers of doubt and despair. The wires
of communication are "jangled, out of tune, and

harsh." Our first duty, then, is to set the house of
the physical self in order, that it may be a worthy
dwelling for the High Intelligence ready to use it
once we open the door.
We need not look for worldly success and dis
tinction. Paul's great work was a path of hardship
and danger. To the true disciple nothing matters
but obedience to the vision. The Knights of the
Grail followed through morass and fen, darkness
and danger, stopping at nothing until they found
the object of their search. "Lead and I follow!"
was their battle-cry.
The only tragedy is failure to see, hear, and
obey. The only disaster is the closing of the higher
channels whereby we move in the darkness of ig
norance and despair. The only unforgivable sin is
the sin against the Holy Spirit : failure to see in the
first place, or having seen to lose the gleam
through disobedience.
All must come in the appointed time and place.
Blessed are they who help to prepare the way,
clearing the shadows of darkness and doubt by
the light which they have never allowed to grow
dim, the light that shone upon their path as they
walked their own lonely road to Damascus.

Impulse versus Intuition
THESE
two forces in human life are very power
ful. Intuition, the short cut to Truth, works
only for good. Impulse may be good or evil. To
act on impulse is often dangerous. To follow intui
tion is always safe.
How are we to distinguish between them? In
tuition obeys the voice within. It takes the direct
line to the source of knowledge. Impulse may come
from the lower self; intuition, never. We act on
impulses, good and bad. Emotion is the motive
force. Obviously we should hold our impulses under
tight control and cultivate our intuition.
How can this be done? How can the bridge be
tween the higher and the lower man be crossed?
First, we must recognize the existence of the
higher man and make a determined, persistent,
daily effort to contact the spiritual side of being.
We can try to see God in all His works. We can
lose ourselves in the beauty of sky and sea, wood
land and meadow, rocks and hills, flowers and
birds. Nature is a great releasing force for Spirit,
breaking down the barriers that keep us "cabin'd,
cribb'd, confin'd." By touching the Universal, we
touch the fringes of Truth's garment. Another way
is prayer and meditation. By realizing that we are
a part of the Divine, with a place in the Great Plan,

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
we lift our consciousness higher and draw closer
to the realm of Truth. The vibrations of the phys
ical are quickened and gradually attuned to catch
messages from planes beyond, where vision is
clearer and truer.
All great work is the result of intuition. Many a
plan has been made in the still watches of the
night, to be carried into waking consciousness. The
inventor, brooding over his problem, sees in a flash
the answer. The advice "to sleep on it" is based on
profound truth. Morning brings a solution. We
know intuitively what to do.
Akin to intuition is inspiration. The painter, the
musician, the writer catch the vision and transmit
it through their own peculiar gift. Here, again, we
have an analogy to radio. We have only to be keyed
to the proper rate of vibration to catch the mes
sage of truth or beauty, waiting to be registered by
the soul qualified to transmit it to others who are
themselves ready to receive.
Here, too, a little leaven lightens the whole mass.
Darkness flees before the light. The world today,
as never before, needs souls who recognize so
powerfully the spiritual nature of man that
through their attunement with higher realms the
higher may overcome the lower, and darkness be
driven out by light.

The Importance of Faith
are told that "faith is the substance of
» » things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen." Have you ever analyzed those words? Sub
stance,—material form, concrete evidence for the
five senses —Hope, the purely spiritual force
which carries the human race through sickness
and suffering, loss and grief, disappointment to
the point of despair —Hope, the great treasure of
perplexed humanity, the promise of better days,
the dawn behind the dark, the stars hidden by
clouds, the spring which follows the winter storms.
Faith makes possible a proof to human eyes that
what was unseen is now seen, what was apparently
lost is now found, what existed only in the higher
realms of creative energy has now taken material
form. Faith spurs on the great leaders in all fields
of human endeavor. The discoverer, the inventor,
the priest, the teacher, the parent, the lover —
each one glimpses a vision of something as yet un
seen by the common man and through the dynamic
power of faith brings his dream into actuality.
So it was with Columbus in the world of discovery ;
so it was with Edison, Ford and Wright in the
world of invention; so it is with all who love and
see only the best in those they love ; so it has been
with all the great teachers from Mark Hopkins to

herent beauty and goodness of the human heart,
faith in the promises of God !
Why stumble along a dreary pathway? Lift your
eyes to the hills from whence cometh your help,
the hills of faith, of dream, that evidence of a
Creator who made them and when He had made
them found them good.
Today as never before the world needs faith, for
faith is indeed "a live wire that stretches into the
invisible." Have faith in the Eternal, have faith
in yourself since you are a part of the Eternal,
have faith in your brothers who are a part of you
—and according to your faith it will be done unto
you.
"And He did not many mighty works there be
cause of their unbelief ." Both ends of the battery
are necessary. There must be a receiving as well
as a sending station. Attune yourself by faith and
behold a miracle ! Him that hath ears let him hear.
The Spirit still speaks to the understanding heart.

The Problem of Evil
DID
you ever read the novel, "The Sorrows of
Satan?" It is difficult to understand this great
fallen angel. We associate him with horns and a
tail. We shudder at the mention of his name. We
think of him as glorying in the sins and misery of
the human race. We do not know the real truth
about evil at all, such a mass of superstition and
legend has overshadowed the subject.
Why not consider this personification of wicked
ness from an entirely different point of view?
May he not represent wrong choice, the free will
which takes the path down instead of up? Does
he really exist at all, or is he symbolic of the in
verted good ? We have pairs of opposites through
out nature: darkness, light; cold, heat; winter,
summer; death, life. On the emotional plane we
run the gamut of love, hate; courage, fear; joy,
despair; success, failure; good, evil. Yet each of
these pairs is in a sense one unit, two faces of the
same coin.
What is the reason for this strange contradic
tion, leading to so much confusion and suffering?
It would seem as if one of the objects of growth
were the attainment of balance, the overcoming
of evil by good, the absorption of the lower into
the higher. In that sense can evil possibly be a

separate entity? Is it shadow or reality? The an
swer is plain. Just as the shadows flee before the
sun, so Satan or sin vanishes into the abyss when
Michael, the leader of the heavenly hosts, takes
the field against him.
Do you see the analogy? There are great sor
rows connected with all evil : suffering always fol
lows sin. One of the most difficult things to under
stand is the fact that we must suffer for the sins
of others. We have race karma, national karma,
family karma, personal karma. No man can live
to himself alone. The problem of evil is part of the
fabric of our lives, its threads interwoven with
the whole web of existence. Yet, in a sense, evil
doesn't exist any more than do the shadows. At
night they seem horribly real, but in the light of
day where are they ? Vanished into oblivion !
Are not these the sorrows of Satan, if we wish
to personify this figure of will gone wrong? Evil
choices bring their inevitable train of human suf
fering; but the one who knows realizes that such
suffering is only a smelting-furnace in which the
gold emerges from the dross. The dross is thrown
away, forgotten; the gold remains. Evil is, then,
in reality an agent of Good, or God, testing, re
fining, purifying all that is best and noblest. In
the metaphysical sense there is no evil—it is only
a passing shadow on the path leading to perfec
tion.

The Call to Arms
ITH the echo of battle heard round the world,
' » we are constantly aware of marching men,
onrushing tanks, the loud drone of airplanes mass
ed for attack. It is not, however, of such a call to
arms that We wish to speak. The conflict each of
us must wage is silent, a war within one's inner
self. Michael and Lucifer are still in opposition in
the heart of man. Which is to gain the victory?
The gift of free will makes the outcome our own
peculiar responsibility. We can join the heavenly
hosts or the Satanic forces. But we cannot escape
the conflict. We take it with us wherever we go.
The gifts of the Spirit against the lusts of the
flesh and the pride of life! Old is the battle —as
old as the history of the human race. No one can
escape it. In one form or another comes the call
to arms.
The victory can never be settled by one battle.
Again and again the opposing forces meet. Each
conquest, of course, strengthens the winning side.
But the lower must be completely submerged in
the higher before the day is won. This is a long
and painful process of ups and downs. A life may
seem to end in apparent defeat. It may neverthe
less be victorious defeat from which the tempo
rarily vanquished will rise again to victory.

Deliver Us from Evil"

the cry: "Nevertheless not what I will, but what
Thou wilt." In the Litany, too, we pray God to hear

famine —from danger on land and sea—and from

Commandment.
The psalmist shows the way in his paean of
faith as he sings: "Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me."
There is evil in this world and in the next. No
one can deny that fact. We carry our sins with us
wherever we are until we heartily repent and turn
our faces homeward. Two great dangers are ig
norance and fear. Weakness of will might be
added, but this is an effect rather than a cause.
With true knowledge we know our only deliverance
is the following of God's will. Such a course auto
matically eliminates fear, for "if God be with us,

Immortal souls have nothing to fear, once the

The Right to Win
BEHIND
victory must be a logical reason—
greater skill, more careful planning, deeper in
sight than the opposing force. More important
than all this, however, is a long chain of cause and
effect leading into a far distant past. We are so
accustomed to consider the present only and forget
the foundations on which the present rests. There
can be no illogical phenomena. For everything
there is a reason.
Take the small discords of daily life. Some people
seem to bring us only unhappiness. Others are
like a spring in a weary land. If we could go back
into the distant past, beyond our present three
score years and ten, we should find the reasons for
many of the perplexing problems of the present.
The point is, we must work largely in the dark,
for to few is given the knowledge which would
solve the puzzle.
What should be our attitude in this maze of
bewilderment in which we so often find ourselves ?
In any circumstance we must keep unbroken the
link with our spiritual or higher Self. This means
patience, long-suffering, courage, prayer for light
and leading. Such a rhythm of lofty vibration will

In short, we must earn the right to victory. The
only victory worth the name is spiritual. To the
blind world it may seem defeat, as in the case of
all those who are persecuted for righteousness'
sake. Victory, however, is sure as registered on the
higher planes. The Caesars, Napoleons, the Croe
suses and Cleopatras are wind-blown particles on
the sands of Time. Most of us have not even their
claim, such as it is, to fame. All, however, must
weave the chequered fabric we call life. In our own
hands is the answer to our problems. Only through
identification with our higher selves and constant
attunement to the best we know can we earn the
right to ultimate victory.

The True Meaning of Power
THE
world today is torn in a struggle for so-
called power. Nation is pitted against nation,
class against class, race against race. In the mael
strom of human conflict, Satanic forces are let
loose. Again, Good and Evil are at each other's
throats. There can be only one outcome. However
long the struggle and uncertain the victory, Truth
must ultimately triumph. It may not be your con
cept of Truth or mine. So often the wish is father
to the thought. But God's will must be done in
earth as in heaven. His Truth is omnipotent.
What then is Power? It is not earthly position,
wealth, worldly influence, a seat among the ma
terial mighty. These things are left behind on the
return to the homeland. Power in its true sense
belongs only to the realm of Spirit : the power of
self-control, the power to forgive as you would be
forgiven, the power to live in the Eternal in a
world centered on the ephemeral, the power to
know yourself as unconquerable spirit which
"shall cease to be never."
The early apostles were sent forth with empty
hands, but how steadfast and confident were their
hearts. Prison, shipwreck, torture availed nothing.
The flame of the Spirit is unquenchable. They met
death with a smile, knowing that their Redeemer

join Him in the mansions prepared for them.
Where is the army of martyrs today? How
many voluntarily choose the way of the cross?
How many of their own free will take the road of
poverty, chastity and obedience to the Higher
Self? Is it any wonder that turmoil rages in a
world where evil is let loose ?
This is no time for faint hearts. There is no
place today for doubt or despair. Above the hope
less confusion of a world gone mad, the stars still
follow in their courses, the sun still shines, the
laws of Nature remain unchanged.
What Power is in our hands did we but know it !
The Power that made it possible for a few humble
men to carry a great light, passing the flame un-
quenched to others ready to carry on in their turn
as instruments in a cause which could not fail be
cause the Power of the Universe was its source and
inspiration.
What has become of the faith that enabled the
early martyrs to face torture and hideous death?
What has become of the courage that makes all
pioneering possible? Where is our vision?
Strong and hardy souls develop in adversity.
The testing times for a nation or an individual are
the great opportunities. If we fail, we fail only to
rise again. Sooner or later we must come to our
senses. For some, the road is long and uphill all the
way. Swift and steep is the descent to Avernus.

The Way of the Transgressor
IT
has often been a question how a so-called God
of Love can permit suffering, or even, as some
so wrongly think, inflict punishment. We punish
ourselves. Only by suffering can we open our eyes
to the truth, recognize our sins, cease from our
mistakes and learn to do well. Suffering is the
kindest of all teachers. It roots out causes of evil.
Though the operation be heroic, the patient al
ways recovers in the light of knowledge. Some
cannot learn from the experience of the race. Some
are ignorant and know not what they do. To both
must come wisdom and healing.
It is a far deeper problem when this wrong
doing involves others, sometimes whole peoples.
Then the race karma is swift and terrible. Woe to
those from whom the offenses come. Even the
ones innocently involved must suffer in some de
gree, but heavy is the penalty for those whose
power and responsibility are great.
Prayer is a mighty force when properly used.
We must learn to pray more and more that God's
will may be done on earth as it is in heaven. Selfish
prayers have no place in the scheme of things. The
forces of good work unceasingly for the develop
ment of the whole. No one unit can stay the on

with the good of the whole, they must of course
be swept aside and like all selfish endeavors be lost.
Such transgressors are many today. Hence the
present strife and world chaos! A new race is
a-borning and birth means travail. From the ruins
of past mistakes will spring the flower of a new
civilization in which spiritual development must
precede or in any case keep pace with material in
vention; else humanity as we know it today is
doomed. The days of lost Atlantis must not re
turn. The knowledge then was great; but the
transgressors met their doom because wickedness
prevailed and hearts were evil.
"Be our guide in the time of temptation and
deliver us from evil." So the Christ prayed for a
stiff-necked generation. That prayer should re
echo round the world today while there is yet time
to restore to sanity peoples who seem to have for
gotten spiritual values and the pain that comes to
all who break the higher laws.

The Meaning of Pain
IT
is a natural impulse of every normal person
to wish to avoid pain. No one likes to suffer,
though suffering in one form or another comes to
every human being. It may be physical ; it may be
mental or emotional ; but come it must.
Many philosophers have sought the meaning of
pain. Many brave souls have borne it uncomplain
ingly. For all the questions there have been few
answers, since many of these problems go deep in
to past causes about which we at present know
little.
Pain is usually the sign of something wrong—
a maladjustment in some delicate part of the
mechanism that is man's make-up. Some pain can
be reached and forgotten; but the deeper the
cause, the more intricate the problem. Not all diffi
culties can be solved; some must bear. to the end
a burden known only to themselves.
What is the purpose of this apparently cruel
suffering? Until we have the vision of the long
panorama of the past, we cannot answer this in
telligently; but we do know that pain bravely
borne refines, sweetens, ennobles character. It
purifies the gold from the dross, developing the
spiritual nature to such an extent that when re

worn-out physical to enter an advanced state that
would have been impossible without the refining
process of years of suffering nobly endured.
This refining process is akin to the tuning of a
musical instrument whereby sweeter and truer
notes are made possible. Pain has its own divinity
through the suffering of the Blessed One. In pain
new life is born ; in pain the old life is relinquished.
In the coming and the going so much pain! Again
in the years between, periods of pain !
As the Master Hand plays upon the chords of
the human soul, some strings seem stretched to
breaking, but through the melody runs a sweeter,
clearer note because the tested instrument has
met the strain and given forth the deep, rich tones
of a vehicle delicately attuned and vibrantly re
sponsive. The deepest sweetness in human char
acter comes from pain bravely and intelligently
borne. Only through this refinement can the harp
of man's being respond in sensitive accord to the
vibrations that touch him from the higher worlds.

"In Mercy Given"
IT
is difficult indeed sometimes to understand
why we are called upon to bear such heavy
burdens. Blameless lives suffer severe punishment.
We question the law of Justice, failing to see into
the far distant past through the present to the
future. In the Eternal the omnipresent Now pre
vails. Our knowledge, however, is limited to a brief
three score years and ten. Even that we do not
know or understand. Who can fathom the heart of
another when he cannot analyze even himself?
Conflicting impulses leading to bad mistakes from
which suffering must inevitably come !
"All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given."
For what purpose ? To purge and refine that we
may draw nearer to God. But we must grasp the
distinction as to the cause of our suffering before
we can understand the love and the mercy that

fault is ours. Back, beyond "the sleep and the for

life experience there is a long range of lives, the
mistakes and sins of which we could not face
were we to meet them all at one time. The debts

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
when we honestly repent; but the effects are still
to be transmuted. The disease must be cured, the
cause of the trouble removed.
Heroic operations are often necessary, not only
on the individual but on the body politic and
social. Lives are thrown with apparent careless
ness into the discard, but who are we with our
limited knowledge to know what debts are being
paid, what effects met and cancelled, never to be
met again.
"In mercy given!" Is it not a great mercy that
we are permitted to wipe out sin? Hearts cleansed
by purifying fire until only pure gold remains ! The
sacrifice of Christ on the cross was indeed a sacri
fice for sin whereby men might learn to know God
and the way to Him. At the same time, suffering
points the way for us, too. There is no greater
teacher. Before the Great Physician can heal, He
must eradicate the cause of the trouble. A heroic
operation may be necessary.
The eye of faith looks through the clouds and
sees the star of hope. No matter how far we stray,
the love of our Father follows us. Our sufferings,
which we have brought upon ourselves in this or in
past lives, are truly "in mercy given," for it is
suffering that brings us back to the Father's
house. On the return home our chief business is to
find the right way. All that comes to us, therefore,
must be met in the spirit that animates a wan
derer who has lost the road and longs for light that
he may find his path again.

The Wine Press
HAVE
you ever thought that the juice of the
grape would be lost were it not for the wine
press? Wine has been so misused that we forget
its purpose. Christ changed the water into wine at
the wedding-feast. Christ blessed the wine at the
last supper. We drink this consecrated wine when
we kneel at the communion rail. It would be worth
the effort to collect references to wine through
sacred and profane literature. In most cases, like
all the gifts of Nature, it has a poetry of its own.
It is only man's misuse of Nature's forces that has
turned heaven into hell.
The wine press ! Each grape bruised to nothing
ness while its juice mingles with similar drops to
form the united whole.
In a way the process is similar to human experi
ence. Our crushed and broken hearts add their
drops to the suffering of the world and form in
the great crucible of life a distilled essence that
lifts us nearer to the great Master of the Cross.
Individual will resigned to the will of God ! Per
sonal pride lost in the contemplation of the Geth-
semane of human life! Selfish ambition over
whelmed by the utter futility of sterile planning !

heart can the feet of the disciple ever reach the

The Trend of the Times
WHEN
values are upside down, nations crum
bling, individual lives crushed, minds lost in
perplexity and confusion, it is well to attempt an
approach to sanity in an analysis of the purpose of
living. To many, life is a series of accidents: the
accident of birth, changes of fortune, haphazard
meetings, "ships that pass in the night," friends
made and lost, strange enmities and aversions, all
the crazy happenings in a wild scheme of things.
The whole confusing panorama of individual and
national life seems a hopeless mess. Is this too
black a picture?
How explain the inequalities of Fate? Dark,
dirty tenements not fit for dogs over against pa
latial estates, left in the care of servants ! Aged
parents neglected by the children for whom they
toiled and sacrificed! Injustice on the throne! The
purpose and aim of life ignored!
Where find Truth upon the earth ? Those in high
position false to their charge ! The money-changers
ever in the temple, the Judases in the seats of
power! Once more,
"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed."
Does the whole world have to be smashed to bits
to bring men and women to their senses? It would
seem so if the stiff-necked refuse to learn in any

Babylon, Greece, Rome—one by one mighty em
pires fell and new races arose.
There is no escaping the sword of retribution.
Effects of past causes must be met. Man can al
ways, however, set good causes in motion and pre
pare for himself a better harvest for the future.
The trend of the times is forcing us to recognize
the truth that we are spiritual beings, far from
our homeland. In three score years and ten, more
or less, we pass a day in the school of experience.
We reap what we sow. The seeds of wheat and
tares may have been planted in the far-distant
past, beyond our present knowledge or control.
Reap this harvest we must; but future harvests
are entirely in our own keeping for good or ill.
Suffering brings us to our senses, or else sub
merges us completely. When men and women are
forced to their knees in recognition of the Great
Power in which they live and move and have their
being, then and only then will the trend of the
times be understood and sanity return to a world
of chaos.

The Potter and the Clay
E have heard it said that everything depends
» » on the point of view. Some can make a moun
tain of misery out of a molehill of trouble. Others
can make the obstacle a stepping-stone. But few
today realize the part each plays in the creation
of his own destiny. The potter and his clay, the
artist and his colors, the musician and his har
monies—each is a creator of use and beauty. So,
too, is the humdrum man in the street if he but
knew it.
Once upon a time when the world was young,
this strange being called man gained the gift of
free will—free will within limits, for he could not
escape the effects of past causes he himself had
set in motion. Some used this free will to rebel
against Divine Law. Such automatically con
demned themselves to the darkness of suffering,
because their disobedience and ignorance led them
into sin. Others found peace and contentment in
following the commandments of God, using their
free will in glad obedience to the Higher Law.
Strangely enough, the Father-Mother heart
yearns after the lost sheep of the fold. The story
of the prodigal son repeats itself. Always at some
point along the path the right help appears to

lost in morasses of their own making.
We, too, are potters, working in the clay of hu
man destiny, our own and that of others. We can
make ourselves tall and straight, or we can bend
double under a load of imaginary burdens. We can
help mold the lives of others into the stature of
men, or we can help ruin them almost beyond
repair.
The Great Artist of our destiny, however, never
gives up. His plan of perfection acts as a magnet
for wills that need guidance and feet that have
slipped. Patience and persistence are His. One
spoiled life does not mean complete wreckage. The
clay of character remains to be remolded by a
purified and chastened will. The blemishes disap
pear in the reworking. Lines of suffering give
strength and beauty as the inner glow of Spirit
transforms blemishes into perfection and ruin into
restoration.
Work with the Great Artist, not against Him.
Beautiful is His plan and wonderful His hope for
the countless myriads who slowly work their way
from the mire to the stars.

fills the home. Sad faces smile again and weary
eyes light with the assurance of renewed hope. So
might it be with all of us if we knew wherein re

more important those soul treasures which are the
heritage of humanity, treasures lost when the
gate of Eden closed behind us.
How can this immeasurable wealth be regained ?
What magic word will reopen the store-house?
"Except ye become as little children" ye can in no
wise enter in. What are the characteristics of a
child? Faith in its parents, trust and confidence
in their power and goodness, unquestioning belief
in their word, sunny friendliness and good will.
Have we that faith in our Heavenly Father? Do
we even read His promises, let alone believe them
and build on them? Do we stop to think of His
power and protection? How far away we go on
wrong roads, leading nowhere, when all the time
we have only to take His hand as trusting chil
dren and He will lead us through the green pas
tures and beside the still waters.
This is the only road to recovery, the recovery

The Records of the Past
IT
seems odd to dwell upon the past when we
should set our eyes upon the future if we are
to grow in knowledge and achievement. Yet that
is what most people like to do. They brood over
the years behind and forget the promise of the
years ahead.
We pain ourselves unnecessarily in grieving over
past blunders, even past sins. Each leaves its
mark; karma exacts the toll. But even so, the law
of justice is the law of Love. We rise on our dead
selves to higher things.
Suppose you make a grievous mistake. We all
do. You suffer; you may even cause suffering to
others. In spite of that you gain in knowledge, and
knowledge makes you strong.
The race moves in spirals, as do individuals. A
great wrong brings great suffering; great suffer
ing refines the gold in human character. That gold
is our only treasure in heaven, the one precious
asset we take with us on the long journey of the
soul.
The records of the past are important because
they are the foundation stones of the future. A
mighty chain of cause and effect accompanies man
on his progress or retrogression. But he must learn
at whatever cost. Better the price of pain than

sluggish security! Pain drives us on to seek for
causes, explanations, understanding of our own
and other people's motives. We are here to grow
at whatever sacrifice.
The past is important, then, in its bearing upon
the present and the future. However, we live in
the eternal, in which past, present, and future
blend into one great whole—a march of Time
wherein all has its place as the Spirit strives
toward greater understanding, a closer approach
to the perfection which is its destiny.
Do you think the martyrs dwell upon their
martyrdom? Do you think the saints brood over
their sins? All rejoice in the song of Creation as
the race moves onward and upward to the goal
which is ever just beyond its grasp.
Dwell not upon the past. Thank God for love,
for life, for the promises that never fail. Believe
and rejoice. Let your joy be full. Do not think you
have completed your life. Every day brings new
adventures, new opportunities. Look for them;
wait for them; expect them. In the bosom of Time
they are yours for the asking. Why not ask? Claim
the gifts of the Present and the Future. The re
cords of the Past are closed with the seal of God's
unchanging Love.

Anniversaries
SO
many years to yesterday ! Yet yesterday is as
vivid as today. The highlights of life grow
brighter with the years. Each recurring anniver
sary intensifies the brilliance, dimmed only by
tears for the days that are gone.
The walls of Time are hung with pictures. Mem
ory is a television apparatus which annihilates dis
tance and brings vividly to the eyes of love the
scenes of long ago. It is a blessed provision that
most of us have no power to scan the future. To
the eye of faith those events rest with God. It is
best to leave them there.
"I would sing," cried the poet. "But of what
shall I sing?"
"Green earth after winter, hope after despair,
life and love after death," came the answer.
We look back over our lives and see nothing but
change: loved voices stilled; plans gone awry;
dreams turned to dust. Yet along this tragic path
way are beacon lights, guiding us in the sure
knowledge that the maze has a meaning, that Di
vine plans never go wrong in spite of the ignorance
and obstinacy of man.
Some lives may be wasted, but in that very
waste is a meaning for the soul to grasp as it

mists of Time. Even in the fog shine the beacon
lights of the years. The maze takes pattern and
meaning. Threads break when they no longer
serve the design.
Hold fast to the beacon lights of memory —
homely, familiar scenes of days long gone. Believe
that the road leads ever upward though it may
turn in devious ways through shadowed valleys.
High courage, strong faith, the power and serenity
of the hills carry us through many a detour. Suf
fering serves only to keep beloved faces of the past
haloed in memory. The milestones may be grave
stones of the physical ; but the spiritual, undimmed
and undying, beckons us ever onward over the
brow of the hill to a new horizon.
So, as the years pass, the anniversary dates of
those we love take added significance. We are alone,
perhaps, awaiting the call ourselves, our work for
this incarnation apparently done. Or we may still
be thoughtless children, surrounded by loving care.
In our ignorance we think the world was made
for us. How little we know the years ahead with
their heartbreak and disillusion.
In the Beyond, we are told, there are no time
divisions such as ours. We realize this more and
more as the days pass. Some events of long ago
seem like yesterday, so vivid is our memory. A
whole span of difficult, uneventful years is in
retrospect like a watch in the night. Time becomes
purely subjective.

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
The birthdays into this world and the next are
merely milestones on the long journey of the soul.
Some miles are dark, dreary, and desperate;
others, filled with beauty and promise. We journey
on through desert and prairie, over hill and dale,
along dark canyons and steep precipices, beside
still waters in green pastures. We cannot stop until
we reach the end appointed.
The subjective element is all important in these
experiences. What is a desert to some may blossom
as a garden to others. Even a desert, in retrospect,
becomes a garden if love was there. Values rear
range themselves. Rough stones are priceless
pearls of memory on the rosary of a cross.
Do you think for a moment that you are alone
on these anniversaries? Your loving thought bridg
es the gap of time and space. Unseen hands touch
you in blessing. Voices, long since hushed, call in
love across the years. Angel forms beckon you on
ward as they bid you be of good courage through
the night.
Cherish these days. Remember your so-called
dead. Your rose is a candle ; your love, a prayer. Be
gentle, also, to the so-called living while they walk
at your side. No one knows what a single year will
bring. We meet only to part ; but where love rules,
we part, thank God, only to meet again.

The Gifts of the Magi
IN
the story of the birth of the infant Saviour
appear the fascinating figures of the wise men
from the East who brought their gifts to Christ,
the King. Three wise men are commonly reported,
though there is a charming story about a fourth
who was diverted from his journey to help others
in distress along the way. It is of this "other wise
man" we wish to speak.
He started out with a priceless jewel, so the
story goes, but when he came to the end of his
journey he had nothing left, as he had given all
to those who besought his help on the way. Would
it astonish you to know that his gift was greater
than the combined treasure of all the others? He
arrived empty-handed to find an empty manger.
On the unseen planes, however, the Christ knew
and recognized the priceless tribute which was his.
What was this tribute? The souls of those whom
the traveller had restored to happiness and whole
some living.
We seem at times to have wasted our strength
and missed our quest. Not so, if even one life has
been made brighter for our passing or one glimpse
into a larger world been given to another in de
spair. The by-products of a life may be more im

Letting Go the Past
HILE we are in many ways the result of
" » past thought and action, it is a wise Provi
dence that causes us to forget much of what has
gone before in the long climb upward. We do not
come new-made into this present earth life. It has
been a long journey with many slips and falls. It
would crush us to know all these sins and short
comings in long past experiences. Only when we
are far on the road is it given us to remember,
and then only in occasional flashes.
Even in these three score years and ten of our
present life experience it is most necessary to let
go the past. We have spoken of the futility of re
gret. In our daily repetition of the Lord's Prayer
we ask to be forgiven as we forgive others who
sin against us. This forgiveness should be spon
taneous on our part, and the matter dropped once
and for all. We go through life with such a load on
our shoulders. We have done those things we
ought not to have done and have left undone those
things we ought to have done. True enough, but
the only purpose in acknowledging this fact is to
put it behind us, resolving in the future to leave
affairs to Spirit, put our burden on Christ, and go
free.

achievements and successes, not realizing that the
best things we can ever do are the work of the
Power behind us, acting through us. Of ourselves
we can accomplish nothing really great.
Our chief objective, then, should be to clear all
channels of accretions and obstructions. The past
is past—let it go, thanking God for its blessings
and forgetting all else. It is the present that con
cerns us. Mind, heart, the whole being must be
serene, calm, poised, centered on the Eternal. This
is impossible if we hug to ourselves the burden of
Atlas.
We are not only to let go of the past but we are
to be unworried about the future. Who are we to
match our puny wills with God's will?
"Our wills are ours to make them thine."
Only so can soul-growth and its consequent peace
transform our lives.
The early apostles went forth with nothing ex
cept their readiness to be channels for the word
of God. If they met persecution and death, it was
as nothing to them, so firm and unshaken was
their faith. There was no time for Peter to grieve
because he had denied his Lord, no time for Paul
to brood over the days when he as Saul had perse
cuted his brothers.
Some day all wrongs will be righted ; our loved
ones will understand and forgive; trifles which
have loomed large through the years will appear
the nothings they really were and be lost in the
oblivion where they belong.

selves. Trouble brings us to our knees. Perhaps
this is the reason affliction comes, to keep us from
wandering too far from the homeward path. For
those whose lives are carefree, flooded with sun
shine, there is no longing for the Power to which
we turn in hours of darkness and despair. It was
only after the prodigal had tired of the husks that
the swine did eat that he arose and returned to his
Father.
With the coming of war the race writhes in
agony. It matters not the country. All are human
beings. All suffer, —the men who die, the women
and children who stay at home. Often no homes
are left as refugees trudge the shell-torn roads,
their weary feet bound for God knows where.
The roadside crosses have their worshippers
again. The shrines are once more alight with vo
tive candles. The Ave Marias are sung with break
ing hearts. By many a lonely bed a mother or a
wife kneels in prayer or watches through a sleep
less night.
"It must needs be that offenses come." We must
be forced to our knees. It seems to take suffering
to bring us to our senses. Strange, this, for man
was made to rejoice. The world was made and

The Breath of Beauty
YOU
may wonder what this phrase means. Let
us explain. Breath is the essence of life. With
out breath there can be no life. The infant fills its
lungs with its first cry; the dying leave the physi
cal body with their last sigh. All through our so
journ in the material world there is a constant
inhalation and exhalation. So true is this of all
organisms that we have veritable atmospheres
around cities as around individuals and their
homes.
This constant inhalation and exhalation has its
own rhythm or vibration. Like magnets we are
drawn to that environment to which we instinc
tively respond, whether we are consciously aware
of the drawing power or not. There are certain
places which please us for a time and then leave
us with the inexplicable urge to move on. The same
is true of people. They may hold us for a while.
Then we become dissatisfied and seek another en
vironment.
In this restless rhythm of life two things stand
out: the need of man for beauty and his instinc
tive search for happiness. In undeveloped natures
we are reminded of the buzzing of a moth around
a flame, a flame which sooner or later will be the

end of the moth. However misguided the blind,
immature soul, it nonetheless seeks for that which
seems beautiful, though in effect deadly.
Pitiful attempts at adornment, however artifi
cial, are once more the expression of the instinc
tive longing for beauty. There may be absolute
lack of taste; colors may be crude and unbecom
ing; but the cry of every human being as in the
first wail of the newborn babe is for breath—the
breath of beauty.
If we were more developed, if we understood the
real, inner truths of being, we could so easily sat
isfy this instinctive urge to regain that which we
have known and lost. Do you think the Garden of
Eden is a fanciful myth? Do you believe the house
of many mansions is an empty promise? If you do,
however much money you may have in your purse,
you are starving in the midst of plenty.
The whole breath-taking Universe is centered
on Beauty, Perfection, Bliss. If we are breathing
the miasmic air of the swamps, it is our own fault.
We choose to dwell in them when the spicy wine
of the pines and the sea is ours for the asking. To
be sure, we are not always free to come and go.
At the same time the mind is free. With our
thoughts we can build a world of beauty, live in
it,
breathe
it,
and in time
it
is
ours.
With every conscious indrawing of breath can
you not call for the breath of beauty? Can you not

"Halt!"
THIS
word of four letters is one of the great
weapons of Nature. By weapon, in this in
stance, we mean a truly beneficent power. When
we are headed down hill in self-destruction, our
physical organism calls a halt. We are laid low in
sickness with plenty of time to think. If we are
wise, we try to reason out the cause of our trouble.
If that is beyond our power, our thoughts at least
take a more serious turn as we face a future,
handicapped by illness.
Sometimes the command to halt comes in the
form of retribution other than sickness. Our past
catches up with us. It may be the law of the land
which puts us behind bars, literally or figuratively.
This time of testing through mental suffering
again gives us forced opportunity to think in an
effort to reason out the cause of present difficulties.
Sometimes we are halted by lack of time or
money or the right environment. The cherished
plans which mean so much are blocked for reasons
beyond our control. If we only knew the true story
of our place in the Great Plan, we should realize
that this particular road is not ours. We have no
place thereon.
It may be that Death cries, "Halt." A young life,
full of promise, is cut off before its time. So it

seems to us in our fog and ignorance. War and its
accompanying plagues still torture a world gone
wrong. We think this is the only plane for ex
pression and development. We forget the many
mansions in our Father's house. When earthly life
becomes too impossible the "halt" of Death is a
blessed release, beckoning to higher paths of lofty
adventure.
Here we must stay, however, until our work is
done. The halt of illness, limitation, disappoint
ment, sorrow and suffering must be faced in the
heroic conviction that God orders all things well.
Whether we stand and wait, or right-about face,
we must as good soldiers obey orders. Obedi
ence to the Higher Law is the purpose of all ex
perience. How much wiser to obey instinctively,
gladly. When we cannot see the reason for these
tragic "Halts" we must realize the working of a
Power greater than ourselves, knowing that His
will, not ours, must be done in our apparently
broken lives.

The Foolishness of Fear
"T ET not your heart be troubled." We need this
admonition today when the world seems to
be tumbling about our heads. What do to ? Where
to go? The puzzle becomes more and more intri
cate ; the truth, more and more elusive.
"Ye believe in God, believe also in me." But how
many today really believe in God? A large propor
tion of mankind have turned atheistic and are
teaching this godless doctrine to the young. May
that not be one of the signs of approaching dissolu
tion? Without the fundamental conviction of an
overruling Providence we are automatically
doomed to the rocks of self-destruction.
"I go to prepare a place for you. But if I go, I
will come again, and receive you unto myself ; that
where I am, there ye may be also."
The cause of all our fear is the identification of
ourselves with the physical body. If we could once
dissociate our real selves from the temporary gar
ment we now wear, we should understand the
foolishness of fear. Nothing can harm the Spirit.
Nothing can quench the Eternal flame of which
we are a spark. Fear and suffering belong only to
those who have severed themselves from the High
er Forces. In due time, through purification, even
these tragic souls will arrive.

knowing that Spirit is invincible, indestructible,

"Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
be afraid." Radiant in the positive assurance
that all is well with our souls, we face the future
in joyful confidence. We may be in full physical
strength ; we may be approaching the end of this
particular journey. But if God is with us, who can
be against us? Even Death has no terrors. "I will

The Fullness of Time
THIS
striking phrase illustrates a great law of
Nature,—no rush, no hurry, no forced growth.
The life in mineral, plant, animal and man must
take its accustomed course. Growth can never be
hurried. Yet growth is irresistible. We are impelled
onward and upward whether we consciously will
or not.
Granted that some conditions are more favorable
than others, that is a part of the fullness of time.
When we have earned the right, the tide turns.
We go with it instead of against it. But first there
must be the testing of an adverse current.
"Sweet are the uses of adversity;
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head."
In the fullness of time winter gives way to
spring. In the fullness of time buds blossom, birds
return. In the fullness of time dawn breaks, how
ever dark the night. Yes, in the fullness of time
our experience here merges into the release of
death. Why fear this step in our upward course?
The Divinity that shapes our ends, in spite of our
ignorant blundering, works out the plan for each
soul until our eyes are opened. Then we are able
consciously to cooperate and thus accelerate our
own development and the progress of the whole.

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
The chief difficulty, the stumbling-block, is ig
norance of our place in the scheme of things. The
frightful waste, the suffering we bring upon our
selves, is appalling. But the law which gave us free
will must take its course until in the fullness of
time we are brought to our senses. There are no
short cuts : the fertile soil, the seed, the stalk, the
sun and the rain precede the full corn in the ear.
Growth is slow, but once started, sure.
Peace and security come when we rest upon the
law instead of fighting against it. All Nature in
dicates Law, which is only another name for Di
vine Intelligence. The orderly progress of the sea
sons, day and night, the courses of the stars, the
great principles of physics, chemistry, biology,
medicine, which unfold as man's knowledge and
experimentation open the way—all these are proof
of a great Power behind the scenes. The fool in his
heart may say there is no God. In his blindness he
misses entirely the meaning of Creation. Suffering,
in the fullness of time, brings him back to the
Father's house.
Why not work with the law instead of against
it? "Know thyself" was the ancient precept. Study
the work of God in His creation, and in the full
ness of time you, too, will gain a vision of the light
which never shone on land or sea.

The Sword of Damocles
PARALYZING
fear is one of man's worst foes.
It may be likened to the sword suspended by a
hair, about to fall at any moment. The astonishing
thing is that like the dagger in "Macbeth" we
create the sword by our own imaginings of dire
events to come.
The power of thought like all great forces is
twofold in its nature. It may be used to kill or
cure. No constructive effort of man has ever found
fruition except through creative thought. Most
evil befalls him by the wrong use of this great gift
of imagination. The bridges we cross unneces
sarily, the hopes that die in the malaria of fear,
the achievements that might have been, the lives
that might have made good —paralyzed in un
reasoning inertia and equally unintelligent dis
couragement —what unnecessary tragedies !
It is well to hold fast to your dreams in silence.
Plant the seed, give it the moisture and the sun
shine of hope, and let Nature do her work. She
works silently but surely. Discussion brings in
negative thought. Before you realize you are being
swayed by the opinions of others. The greater
your idea, the more opposition you are likely to
find from those who do not understand.
False fears, false imaginings work havoc. Not

only do they prevent all achievement but they ac
tually create adverse circumstances. The common
sense which otherwise would be man's wall of pro
tection is thrown to the winds in the panic of fear
and despair.
The sword of Damocles hangs on the hair of
your own wrong thought. Move out from under
the cobwebs that have made such a creation pos
sible. Your mind is a force to be used as you see
fit. The lunatic sees horrible pictures, says Shake
speare, but the lover and the poet create a world
of beauty and give
"to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name."
The ancient alchemist dreamed of transmuting
base metals into gold. Was it altogether a dream?
The magic of thought creates what we will. The
sword of Damocles may become the star of hope,
achievement. Remember, however dark the night,
"Behind the cloud
Shines thy star."

Delayed —by Doubts!
FTEN we go to the station to meet a friend
v and find the train listed as late, delayed an
hour, two hours, sometimes even six hours. Wash
outs, snowslides, sections held up while the sec
tion ahead takes the right of way. Time lost,
nerves frayed, dear ones anxious —all the dismay
that comes from delayed or broken appointments.
It is exhilarating to be on time. At this corner
of the crossroads an important experience awaits
me. But if I am late I miss the contact.
Late—what does this mean in a metaphysical
sense? It means failure to grasp opportunities,
failure to grow, a vision of the truth but how
often a slipping back—until the years pass in
frustration and the heart dies, unsatisfied.
Doubt—the synonym of negation, the question
ing Thomas who must feel the wounds in the
hands and side before he will recognize the Blessed
One. Faith, on the contrary, takes the short cut.
Not having seen, it believes. Like a child it trusts
the promises of its Father. With hand outstretched
it grasps the guidance offered and goes on its way
triumphant to meet opportunities at the appointed
time.
We are told that when the pupil is ready, the
teacher is ready, also. "Behold I stand at the door

and knock: if any man hear my voice and open
the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
him, and he with me." The teacher ready, waiting ;
the pupil so distracted by the voices of the world
he cannot hear that inner voice at the door of his
being—and the teacher cannot enter.
Delay on the road of knowledge —more suffering
to be undergone, more precious time wasted, more
loss to be incurred until old and gray we return
from a fruitless quest to find the Grail at our own
door!
Meanwhile we have missed the chance of light-
hearted, joyous living. We might have made so
many people happy. We might have been so happy
ourselves. Must we always learn by suffering?
Doubt closes the door. Horrible, if our doubts have
closed doors for others ! We know people who hab
itually throw cold water on every plan suggested.
It is bad enough to delay ourselves on the road
upward; to be a stumbling-block in the path of
another is far worse.
Eventually, in God's good time, we like to think
that all will arrive, all the tears be wiped away,
all the doubts forever banished. But meantime
what joys are missed, what peace is lost. Would
it not be sensible each day to build constructively
in faith, banishing all doubt to the limbo where it
belongs? Then according to our faith will it be
done unto us.

The Significance of Trees
"Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree."
THESE
lines of a" soldier-poet have become a
household word, familiar the country over.
Like many accustomed sights and sounds, repeti
tion has dulled the inner significance. "Familiarity
breeds contempt." It is only the far-distant on the
other side of the hill that attracts wandering fan
cies. We follow the wild geese in a phantom flight
and miss the bluebird at our very door.
Trees, like cathedrals, raise graceful spires to
the sky. Their roots are sunk deep in our common
earth, hidden in the mysterious foundation of a
material world. In the Spring, when the sap begins
to flow, the buds of another year open in leaf and
blossom for a new resurrection. As the days pass,
the birds return and build their nests. Life un
folds in beauty.
The cycle follows its accustomed round. Through
leafy days of summer and glorious pageantry of
fall, the year marches on to bare boughs and
wintry blasts. Now the stars no longer hide behind
the topmost branches. The whole expanse of
heaven stands revealed, as frosty nights give the
atmosphere their own peculiar radiance.
The life of the tree has a definite significance for

analogy is plain. But never forget, when winter
comes, the clear vision of the stars. When our
lives like the winter trees are stripped to the es
sentials of stark simplicity we have a clearer
vision of the heavens.
Why not lose ourselves occasionally among the
trees? If we could tune only for a moment into the
rhythmic life of Nature we might penetrate the
veil between the unseen and the seen, and catch
glimpses of an enchanted world, a world which
paradoxically enough is the only world of reality.

The Test of Mastery
WHAT
is a master? How is mastery attained?
In the world of affairs we have a master in
business, the great executive who handles large
deals and directs concerns of many ramifications.
In art, we have the master in music, color, tech
nique, beauty. In college, we have the master's
degree next in line following the A.B. of gradua
tion. In earlier stages of learning, we say a child
has mastered the alphabet or the multiplication
table or the spelling demons. In all these instances,
small or great, mastery means perfection in work
—certainly the attainment of a fixed standard of
varying degrees of complexity.
We have masters, also, in the great school of
wisdom or life experience. This degree, like the
others, is attained only by strenuous effort, often
through considerable suffering. Each step of the
way the disciple overcomes some handicap of the
lower nature until he has transmuted weakness
into strength, ignorance into knowledge. This is
often a very slow process, as slow as the supplant
ing of a bad habit by a good one. It is often at
tended by failure and complete discouragement,
but the stumbler falls only to rise again, pressing
on with renewed determination.
The chief object of life is indeed the growth

towards eventual mastery. "Be ye therefore per
fect, even as your Father which is in heaven is per
fect." There are no ifs or but's in this admonition.
The command is clear-cut and unmistakable.
Neither are any half-way measures accepted. Per
fection, without any limitations whatsoever, is the
goal.
How can this be attained? What is the test by
which the pupil qualifies? Both questions have
the same answer —"the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ." In other words, when the
Spirit in us has taken complete control of our
lives, so that we do not even consider the lower
self with its material weaknesses and limitations,
then we are approaching the stature of the Christ,
or the Divine nature in us. This is Mastery. When
this complete unfoldment occurs, we have an at-
tunement with the Source of all life, which re
places all error with perfection, so that we become
true graduates from this particular plane of ex
pression. We need never return unless drawn by
the great renunciation, as was the Christ, who
left his spiritual home to take up the burdens
of the flesh that He might help us, His weaker
brethren.
Whether we consciously will it or not, this is
the goal set for the race. Some will take longer
than others to achieve the great result. All, how
ever, must eventually arrive, though perhaps after
many set-backs. We do not like to think of lost
souls—rather let us say retarded souls. The shep

herd went to infinite trouble to find the sheep that
was lost. Each human being, however, in the final
analysis, must pass his own examination on the
road to Mastery.
Life seems hopelessly full of difficulties, per
plexities, and sorrows. Each situation, neverthe
less, must be mastered before we set ourselves free.
If we study the law of cause and effect, we master
what the Easterners call karma, or the fate we can
not avoid. Only the development of the Christ con
sciousness can lead us step by step on the road to
the final goal. This is the purpose of all our ex

The Ties That Bind
AN
instinctive urge in every living thing is the
love of liberty. We dislike the suggestion of
limitation in any form. We are in an age of self-
expression, subjective expansion. The difficulty is
that the self expressing is the lower, personal
side with its emphasis on the small ego, who wants
what it wants when it wants it. The whole tend
ency toward this self-centered freedom of ac

Here, again, we have a most unpopular word.
Few . would voluntarily choose discipline unless
that discipline led the way to greater freedom. It
is of this only true freedom we wish to speak, the
freedom that comes from obedience to the Higher
Law. This is the straight and narrow path, devia
tion from which spells disaster. These are the true
ties that bind, the ties of spiritual obedience to the
highest we know.
After all, this discipline is very simple: Love
God and keep His commandments ; love your neigh
bor as yourself. Analyze the ramifications of these
simple statements, however, and you find all the
complex puzzles of so-called modern civilization.
We are bound to God by the very nature of our

the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and
thy right hand shall hold me." How suicidal to
rebel against the ties that eventually will draw
us back to the homeland from which we came ! The
love for our neighbor is another matter. Herein lie
all the complexities of human relationship. The
ties that bind! How futile to try to cut them until
the debt is paid. There is no escape except through
obedience to the law. And what is the law ?
"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath."
"Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst
thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the
adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge
deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
prison.
"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means
come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
farthing."
Fortunately not all our human relationships are
those of anger and heartbreak. Lovely moments s
come to gentle souls when they walk hand in
hand in the harmony of perfect companionship.
These rare ties which we count as our greatest
blessings must sometimes be temporarily put aside
when old debts remain to be paid before we can
progress on the long journey of the soul.
Death is merely an incident of life. If our path
happens to be hard and lonely, or blocked by the
bitterness of subtle and inexplicable antagonisms
we have only to remember the law: "Agree with

Liberation
MORNING
breaks over the eastern hills, and my
heart cries, "Rise with the dawn!" Gone are
the shadows of night, the doubts and fears, the
agony of mind and heart. A new world awaits me,
rich in beauty and expectation. Can this be death ?
My body is free and strong, light and vibrant. I
have no fear, no pain, only the supreme joy of
liberation. I go to meet my own.

The Gate of Hope
IT
is not far away on a distant road around the
hillside. It is near at hand. At night you enter
the magic portal and wander through the en
chanted lands of spirit. Roses are there, and vi
olets, fragrant flowers of remembrance and of
promise. Here are your loved ones, lost awhile.
Here wait the friends you never knew. Here are
the songs you have yet to sing. Here is all the
loveliness you have still to meet.
Open the gate of hope when evening comes.
Doubt not nor question but go your way in peace
into the promised land, the land of spirit, radiant
with joy and beauty.
Over the mountains steal the shadows of the
night. The sea grows black under the foaming
waves. The stars appear over the broad heavens.
Man turns to sleep in palace or in hovel. Only for
those who know does the gate open. Many find not
the way nor care therefor. But the lovers, the
poets, the seers, the searchers after beauty long to
lift the latch, wending their way homeward to the
realms of Spirit.

The Courage That Never Fails
JUST
the thought of heroism uplifts the race!
The thousands who walk the humble paths of
duty, in peace and in war, the unsung heroes
whose names go into oblivion—these on the one
hand and the "noble army of martyrs" on the
other —what a host of heroes the human race has
produced! Faithful unto death, be that death in
significant or spectacular, here is a company that
thrills even the most hardheaded agnostic.
Whence the power to bear prison, torture, vio
lent death? Whence the power to meet the cheer
less days, chained to a bed of suffering? Whence
the power to climb to the top floor of a burning
house to save a child left in its crib? Whence the
power to go over the top in a hopeless cause ?
If we needed proof of the essential divinity of
man we should find it here. The courage to live
and to die with "confidence steadfast unto the
end," with heart undaunted ! Man's destiny is truly
glorious when he can keep the consciousness that
he is a divine spirit, clothed for the time being in a
material form. The garment is relatively unim
portant; the Spirit is the guiding force which
nothing can kill. If God be with us, who can be
against us? Sooner or later we lay down these
bodies. Three score years and ten, more or less,

"The noble army of martyrs!" Can you not see
them amid the white-robed throng before the

For most of us there is no call to martyrdom.
"The daily round, the common task"—these are
ours. But they can be glorified with "the light that
never shone on land or sea." They can make music,
the music of inner harmony between us and our
task, the courage that failed not along the way.
Once the goal is clear, there is no question. "In

The Gates of Deliverance
AS
a child, perhaps you were accustomed to
swing upon a gate. It might have led into a
pasture or it might have been the front gate, to
pass through which meant home and mother.
Life has many gates: the greatest being of
course those of birth and death. Take the gate of
recovery to health after illness. How bright the
world seems! How kind your loved ones are! How
wonderful it is to return to your place in the ac
tivities of life. Or perhaps the gate of love swings
open. For the moment you do not realize that it
may be also the gate of pain. You enter joyfully
to taste the bitter-sweet of the most complex of
life's experiences.
Or you may open the gate of the garden. We
have two gardens in sacred history : the garden of
Eden and the garden of Gethsemane. In both the
swinging of the gate was caused by sin. The gate
of Eden closed on outcasts who wilfully disobeyed
the higher law. The gate of Gethsemane had to
open due to the blind ignorance and greed of those
who refused to recognize Truth when they had
the opportunity.
These gates are ever in a sense opening and
closing, as similar experiences come to individual
human beings.

There are also other gates, the gates to the

when the disciple is ready the teacher comes. One
portal after another swings open when the time is
ripe. After that new scenes appear, paths leading
to green pastures and quiet waters, the beauty of
which it is beyond the power of man to conceive.
Be a wise keeper of the gates that they may in
truth be gates of deliverance!

Silence, a Mystic Power
WE
know the strange silence that comes before
a storm when all Nature holds its breath. We
know the silence of a summer night. We know the
silence of the frozen snowfields. We know the
strange silence of death, when the lips we love are
closed in this world to open in thanksgiving in
the next. We know in part the silence in which
Nature works—the fertile soil, the seed, the ten
der green shoots, the tall corn, and at last the food
ready for man's use. The whole mechanism of man
works in silence, each part fulfilling its function.
Spirit, the animating Power in all creation, is a
silent force. For this reason if we would express
the full majesty within us, we too must cultivate
the silence. Inner communion with the Source of
Being works only in silence, shut out from the
maelstrom of material noise.
We talk entirely too much about nothing. Vital
energy is wasted. Idle words do active harm—
especially unkind, adversely critical words, or neg
ative words of doubt, unbelief.
The greatest thoughts, culminating in deeds,
are conceived in silence. The inventor alone in his
workshop or his room, the poet and the musician
catching heavenly harmonies, the executive plan
ning moves that will affect many people, the healer

As the seed grows, so does an idea planted in

There are no depressions in God's economy. De

Never for one moment doubt the truth of God's

Do, Dare, and Be Silent
HEN we look through the realm of Nature,
»» we find all the vital operations of life,
growth, and development following their quiet
course in complete silence. The seed in the earth
sounds no trumpets to announce its steady rise in
the darkness; the bird in the egg is silent as he
grows, waiting for a much later date before he
bursts into song; the little child under his mother's
heart develops silently. Soon enough will his pro
testing cry announce his arrival in a cold world.
The stars move silently in their courses ; they may
make heavenly music for "the young-eyed cher-
ubins" but we cannot hear it. Great plans take
form in the silence of the individual soul. The
things that are most holy to us, if we are wise, we
keep to ourselves in silence.
What is the reason for this law of Nature? It is
a pity we do not study her operations more care
fully and pattern our own conduct on hers. With
all her vast prodigality, Nature follows a pattern
of strict economy or balance. The law of cause and
effect demands that these two forces be in perfect
equilibrium. Nature follows that law implicitly and
as it were holds her breath lest one side of the
scales should dip ever so little from the perfect

adjustment. Do you see the analogy? We have a
certain amount of force to expend in order to get
a certain result. Every ounce of energy should be
put in the given direction if we expect a corre
sponding return. This demands silent concentra
tion, or if concentration implies too much difficult
personal effort, at least we must give silent rever
ence to the power of the Absolute working through
us. We should stand at attention, prayerful on
lookers, while the law that we have set in motion
works.
All meditation, from its very nature, requires
silence. We cannot tune in to the great radio cen
ter if the air is filled with static. 'We are told to
pray to our Father in secret, not to shout our peti
tions from the housetops that we may be seen of
men.
What a noisy, impossible world it is! Constant
confusion! Now the screeching of automobile horns
is not enough ; the eternal din of the radio is not
enough ; but in certain parts of the world we must
have the inferno of bombing airplanes, explosives,
giant guns. As if this could result in conquest !
The only conquest is the realization of the di
vinity of one's own soul. Slowly but surely the
light will spread when truth begins to glow in even
a few human hearts. This is the only real victory
for individuals or for nations. It is a silent achieve
ment, however.

The Gleam in the Gloom
E have all seen light-houses on or near rock-

ism of their keepers. But no story can equal that
of Christ and His disciples —no story can surpass
the marvelous courage of the early Christians.
Thrown to the lions, chained to torture, spat up
on, stoned, crucified, they carried the torch, the
light of which never has been and never can be
extinguished. It is the light that never shone on
land or sea, the light of another world, the world
of spirit, which "neither death nor life,—nor prin
cipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come" can ever quench.
How futile for man to match his weak wits
against God's plan! Into the darkness of human
mistakes, human agony, into the gloom of black
despair comes the gleam. Those whose eyes are
opened follow it without question or hesitation.
Onward they go like knights of old, armed with
the strength of ten because their hearts are pure.
Or if action is denied them for a time by force
of circumstances, they also serve as they stand
and wait. Their steadfast confidence that all is
well, their faith that God's will must and will be
done on earth as in heaven, their intuitive wisdom
in leaving the solution to a Heavenly Father, their

In the gloom a gleam ! The captain of the ship,
alert in the darkness, catches the signal and saves
passengers and crew from the rocks in an angry
sea. In the gloom a gleam! The poet, thrilled by
the vision, seeks to arouse the soul of beauty in
man. The artist catches the glow and transmits it
on imperishable canvas for those who have eyes
to see. In the gloom a gleam ! The prophet, know
ing the pattern of the past, intuitively knows the
plan for the future and gives courage to those
who catch his inspiration.
In the darkest night of all history, in the deep

star of the Spirit in man, which many waters can
not quench nor tears dim nor gloom vanquish —
the star which some day all will follow to find the

death.

The Poetry of the Commonplace
SO
many scientific inventions and discoveries
have filled the last four decades that most
marvels of yesterday become the common things
of today. The electric light, the automobile, the
moving picture, the airplane, the automatic re
frigerator, air conditioning, the radio —all these
apparent impossibilities are now established facts.
What has become of the poetry of living? Jaded
sensibilities find no allurement in the miracles of
sunrise, sunset, stars, the march of the seasons;
no poetry in the strange attractions and repul
sions we feel toward other human beings; no po
etry in dull performance of duty, daily sacrifice,
heavy burdens; no poetry in heroic surrender to
loss, disappointment, death !
How much we need the opening of our eyes that
we may see, our ears that we may hear, our hearts
that we may understand! The miracle of thought
alone is worthy of our deepest study and rever
ence. The mysterious energies and substances, the
infinitesimal vibrations of which we know little or
nothing, the whole realm of spiritual knowledge
is a vast library of poetry still to be interpreted,
let alone read.

The Futility of Regret
IFE is made up of mistakes. If it were not, we
should not be the imperfect beings we are, put
on the earth to grow by experience. The sorrow
we cause is often a bitter regret on the other side
of the veil. But that very sorrow purifies human
hearts, makes them more tender and compassion
ate, helps them understand the intricate labyrinth
of human emotion, and shows beyond the shadow
of a doubt the unity of the human race. Even in a
material world sorrow evokes far more sympathy
than does joy. It is much easier to weep with those
who weep than to rejoice at another's good for
tune. There can be no jealousy in sorrow. It evokes
an immediate outpouring of fellow-feeling.
In certain respects, then, regrets are futile. You
might have loved more tenderly those now gone
from human sight. You might have been more
forgiving. You might have put yourself in an
other's place and tried to see from his point of
view. All this you might have done and didn't. You
cannot pass that particular way again.
But there are other ways, other lives, other
chances. The very pang of your regretful sorrow
strikes a chord in the heart you feel beyond your
power to touch. But it is not beyond your reach.
Love surmounts every barrier of time and space.

It travels on the wings of thought. It reaches the
uttermost bounds of the universe in notes of pur
est music. Love is indeed a symphony —unselfish,
pure, regretful love.
All that might have been and was not, you have
here and now, for their love reaches groping hands
to you as they beyond the veil see their mistakes,
too. One day all shall be righted. Sorrow makes
love more piercingly sweet.
Thank God that human hearts are as they are—
feeble, yes, but strong too, strong because of the
very human weakness. Without mistakes there
could be no minor chords to give a haunting
refrain, a refrain which lingers on until loved ones
meet again in perfect understanding to greet a

Thine Is the Victory
"fTIHANKS be to God, which giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ." How few
understand the broad implication of these words!
What victory? How given? In this day of bonds,
slogans, V insignia, and war propaganda, who stops
to think of the one thing that makes true conquest
possible? How far removed these twentieth cen
tury concepts from the days of the early Chris
tians !
Few would consider it victory to be torn to death
in the arena, to be burned at the stake, to be
tortured in ways such as only devilish ingenuity
could devise. How many think of any death as vic
tory ? Yet wherever a man or woman remains true
to his belief, wherever faith rises supreme above
flesh, there indeed is true victory, the results of
which affect the whole world.
Nature does not proclaim her miracles with loud
flourish of trumpet and drum. She works silently,
secretly, but oh, so surely. When the time is ripe,
the result appears. It is only man "who struts and
frets his hour upon the stage," to the delight of a
fickle audience. There is nothing permanent or sure
in any purely human plans. If God is the silent
partner, a very different tale unfolds.

force is irresistible. "Not by might, nor by power,
but by my Spirit," saith the Lord of hosts, the God
of battles. But what battles ? The struggle between
good and evil, the lower and the higher. This
struggle can never cease until all return to the
fold, —tested, tried, triumphant.
The battle is not spectacular. There are no vic
tory medals, no bands and bugles, no flags waving
in the breeze. The hero may go dishonored to a
forgotten grave, but he helped to push the curtain
of darkness back, be it ever so little, that the
light of a better day might shine upon a lost star
which must eventually return to its place in the
heavens. Quiet, silent victories over the lower self!
Unheralded and unknown, they are the leaven that
lightens the lump, feeble rays of the dawn that will
eventually illumine the world.
If you would have peace, you must identify your
self with this Christ force. As the humblest work
er in the ranks, you listen only to obey. The world
well lost, you push forward to the goal for which
you were created, that of co-worker through the
Christ force with God Himself.

The Only Safe Refuge
AR emphasizes the urgent need of safety, es-
» » pecially for the civilian population. In such
crises we have our air-raid shelters and other de
vices. In peace time we have our cyclone cellars,
safe deposit boxes, savings-banks, life insurance
companies, pension systems, social security plans
—all devised to meet the instinctive urge to "play
safe." Few seem to realize that human plans are
no protection whatever. The only real refuge is the
inner realization of the Great Plan for men. With
this intuitive knowledge and the contact which it
brings, man is always surrounded with a wall of
invisible power.
Sacred story is full of such instances. We have
Noah in the ark; Daniel in the lions' den; Shad-
rach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego in the fiery fur
nace; Paul in ship-wreck and in prison. Careful
examination of the Bible brings to light many
more such narratives. "A thousand shall fall at
thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but
it shall not come nigh thee." —"There shall no evil
befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
thy dwelling. For He shall give His angels charge
over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways." And what
is the reason for this protection? "Because thou

hast made the Lord who is my refuge, even the
Most High, thy habitation."
In so-called modern times we have not only the
invisible cloak of the old fairy stories but extraor
dinary cases of almost supernatural rescue in war,
and in accidents on land, sea, or in the air. Some
times such deliverance comes in unexpected warn
ing before the event so that the person concerned
changes his plans accordingly.
If we accept the law of justice on the inner
planes—and no thinking person can reject it—we
must see that protection is a part of that law. In
grave difficulties, which apparently we cannot es
cape, unexpected help arrives. Sometimes in heavy
affliction devoted love wraps us in its cloak and
protects us from the storm. Or we rest secure in
the knowledge: "Whom the Lord loveth He chas-
teneth, and scourgeth every son whom He re-
ceiveth."
Whatever our lot may be, we never know at
what moment it may change. Fortunes are swept
away over night; Death draws the curtain be
tween us and our nearest and dearest; and we
stand apparently alone. Or the world misunder
stands our motives and condemns us unheard. In
all these chances and changes of fortune, our only
refuge is the conviction that there is a Great Plan
for all humanity and consequent security for our
selves.

house upon a rock. In the storms that house fell
not, for the builder had heard and obeyed the

of the Ages, the development of the Christ con
sciousness in every human soul.

much emphasis is put on money that it has
become the dominating thought in most peo
ple's lives. It is natural that this should be so, for
there must be a certain amount of money to pro
vide the common necessities of every day. Where
the supply is small, more and more importance
attaches itself to the wherewithal of comfortable
daily living.
The trouble is, we approach the problem from
the wrong angle. It is necessary for people to be
active if they are to keep well and even half way
happy. For this reason most people must work for
a living. They are not punished but privileged to
join in constructive effort not only for themselves
but for others.
Wealth, however, in its true sense is far re
moved from money. Wealth belongs to character
—resourcefulness, wisdom, vision, imagination,
faith, prayer—these regulate wealth in the deep
sense of the word. It is these qualities we take
with us, while our pocket-books are happily left
behind.
Try using your soul powers constructively. The
field is limitless. In the pioneer days brave men
and women pushed on through hardship and dan
ger to new frontiers. The opportunities today are

just as great, even greater. We need pioneers in
the spirit, those whose faith and intuition are so
strong that they will catch glimpses of realms yet
unexplored and take hold of promises made long
since by the greatest of Teachers.
It would be well worthwhile to note the very
definite promises in the New Testament. It would
be still better to have the faith of a little child and
put these promises conclusively to the test, believ
ing, and giving thanks in advance.
How little gratitude we show for what we have !
The common blessings of every day—sunshine,
air, water, health, the love of those nearest and
dearest, home be it ever so humble, —these are
treasures valued only after they are gone. Instead
of appreciation for the blessings we already have,
there is the constant demand for more, more,
more! Only infinite patience would endure such
short-sighted childishness. After all, we have a
long road to travel on the path upward. Stumbling
feet are to be expected when there is no vision.
This inner wealth, however, on the true road
cannot be lost. It belongs to the fruits of the
Spirit: the realization that we are children of the
King, whose unlimited spiritual stores are ours
for the asking. Seeking a kingdom, —our inherit
ance as a child of the King—what a wealth of
promise, what a fascinating voyage of discovery!

Divine Promises
IF
we should collect the promises in the Bible and
make them a part of our own consciousness,
we should find ourselves rich indeed. Try it for
yourself. It stands to reason, does it not, that the
Power that made heaven and earth, with the full
ness therein, would have untold abundance in His
keeping.
We are warned to seek first the kingdom of God
and His righteousness. Then all these things shall
be added unto us. It is a question of harmony with
the highest we know. The paradox, however, fol
lows that once we have risen to the loftiest we can
attain, the question of material abundance becomes
unimportant. If we think of it at all, we regard it
only as a means to an end.
"What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the
whole world and lose his own soul?" In the lofty
vibration of the Divine we find the emphasis en
tirely on soul needs. As soon as we put spiritual
values first, the necessary material help follows.
If, however, we stress the material we lose even
that which we have when it comes time to cross
the portal. The early apostles were sent forth
empty-handed. How rich, though, were their minds
and hearts! How developed their souls! To them
it mattered not at all what became of the personal

carrying out of their Divine mission.
Do you not see how we put the ephemeral before
the eternal ? Complete faith and the will to rise to
the highest we know will bring a richness of life
such as we never imagined even in our wildest
dreams. Gain through loss, victory through defeat
—we must rearrange all our values. We gain the
higher by loss of the lower; we win the spiritual
by defeat of the material. When we put the
emphasis where it belongs—in the hand of God,
who leadeth us—we experience that true abun
dance and joy of Spirit which is ours for eternity if
we will but listen to His promises and put our lives
entirely in His hands.

Peace, Be Still!
THE
Master quieted the waters by the simple
word. So can we quiet the storms of doubt and
fear. We live in a world of thought. We create our
peace or its opposite. Vibration calls to vibration ;
like attracts like.
Your world is sad. Change the rate of your
thoughts. You then vibrate joy, and joy takes
form in the plastic substance of creation.
Your world is tempestuous. Emotions play un
checked upon and in the hearts of men. Greed,
hate, fear, envy and all uncharitableness ! But the
voice of Love falls upon the waves. Peace follows
the storm. The billows cease their foaming and the
troubled heart mirrors the peace of those higher
realms of Being, where beauty and order reign
under the rule of Law.
Like attracts like. Try to understand how simple
the process is. Thought waves play upon etheric
substance, molding it as the potter molds his clay.
Beauty follows the longing for beauty ; the desire
for knowledge opens the door of Truth. It is as
simple as the rule that one and one make two.
Work with the Law, not against it.
Peace, be still! Find the Master in the depths
of your own being and hearken to His voice.

The Voice in the Garden
WE
follow our own sweet will and think in our
foolishness that we can escape the conse
quences of our follies. As if we could escape from
ourselves and the voice of the God within us!
Though we take the wings of the morning and
fly to the uttermost parts of the sea, the voice is
ever with us.
Why try to run away from this most precious
of birthrights? The God within, the real Self of
our little selves, is our greatest treasure, the rock
of our salvation, our only help in the tragedies of
our transitory lives.
The voice calls to us in the cool of the day, the
voice of Love seeking its own. The stubborn, the
stiff-necked, the wilfully sinful pretend not to
hear; but sooner or later by strange and devious
paths they must return to the Father's house and
hearken to His call.
Meanwhile the gates of Eden close behind them,
their inheritance lost for a time, as they wander
in bitterness, drinking the cup of desolation to
the dregs. But the Self is ever with them, waiting
patiently for the moment when it can make itself
heard, never losing the love for this part of its own
Being, the all-embracing Love which includes all
that It has made.

Make Room for Joy
"npHIS is the day which the Lord hath made ; we
will rejoice and be glad in it." The world
needs joy as never before. So much heartbreak be
clouds the spiritual sun and ruins physical well-
being. Too much grief may end in death and launch
a soul prematurely into realms too dark for peace
and development. Each day could bring its own
peculiar joys if we would open the door. The sun
light, the sky, the trees—even snow, rain, hail—
all the works of Nature "praise Him and magnify
Him forever."
We may start bravely off in the morning at
peace with ourselves and the world, and then col
lide with another's cross-current of anger or de
spair. If we are weak, hurt or taken off our guard,
we catch this disturbed vibration and our own sen
sitive organism responds to the lower key. Instead,
we should be poised enough to hold our ground in
loving silence and thereby help a disturbed soul to
regain its own equilibrium.
Too late come the regrets of what we might
have done and failed to do. Hurt pride, a form of
selfishness, festers like a grievous wound, spread
ing infection. We need the poise of a rope-walker,
secure in our own inner serenity. So much can be
accomplished by the silent power of thought. Wire

less waves of love and longing repair many a
broken bond in this world and the" next. But few
understand this miracle of reconciliation and need
the word of forgiveness spoken here and now.
The joy of the Spirit is a spring of perpetual
refreshment. The knowledge that all is well, that
nothing can separate us from the love of God,
raises the whole tempo of being, not only for the
serene soul whose experience has brought sure
conviction but also for a sorely troubled world, en
gulfed in the red torment of war and destruction.
With joy in the heart there is no place for hate,
harsh and ugly. Here, again, a little leaven light-
eneth the whole lump.
Make room for joy: the joy of little children,
the joy of birds in song, the joy of growing leaves
and buds, the joy of selfless constructive service.
Even though we suffer the torments of Job, it is
still possible to vibrate a serenity bordering on
ecstasy —the spiritual ecstasy of saints and mar
tyrs, or the selfless devotion of pure and noble love.

The Great Peace
ARMISTICE
DAY celebrates the truce of 1918,
to be followed in only twenty-one years by
another war. "Peace, peace, there is no peace!"
This frenzied cry fills the high heavens and tears
apart the veils between the planes. Suffering has
its repercussions throughout the universe, so
closely are all bound together in the One Life. Not
one sparrow falls to the ground "without your
Father." —"Fear ye not therefore: ye are of more
value than many sparrows."
What a strange contradiction! Men so valuable
that they serve only as cannon fodder. Life so
worthless that it is mown down like the grass be
fore the reaper. Is there no explanation? Can there
be peace upon the earth?
Assuredly yes! All storms pass. However black
the clouds and dangerous the lightning, the tem
pest consumes itself. The sky in reality has never
lost its deep sapphire blue; the stars continue to
move undisturbed in their course. Behind all the
storm, peace reigns unmoved, untouched.
So it is in the divine essence of man. The lower
self makes violent conditions in man's outer life.
His angers, jealousies, hatreds stir up dark storm-
clouds; yet within, the real man is unchanged.

sets in motion, the owner of the body is the same.
The Spirit shall never cease to be. And the es
sence of Spirit is peace.
There is in a most vital sense a Great Peace.
Like the deep blue sky it is steadfast, unaffected
by the passing rages set in motion by pigmy man.
The Great Peace is the center of soul growth
wherein the body is sometimes a help and more
often a handicap. But both are in a way insepar
ably connected ; one needs the other.
"To man, propose this test—
Thy body at its best,
How far can that project thy soul on its lone way?
* * * *
"Let us not always say
'Spite of this flesh today
'I strove, made head, gained ground upon the
whole !'
As the bird wings and sings,
Let us cry 'All good things
'Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than
flesh helps soul !'
"
Both so needed, but in the final analysis the Great
Peace can be attained only by the complete con
trol of the lower, physical man. The rider of the
horse needs the horse for his journey, but woe be
tide him if the horse gets out of control.
The object of all experience is the attainment

THIS
invitation is for those who labor and are
heavy laden that they may find rest for their
souls. Strange it is that it takes sorrow and suf
fering to bring us to our knees in the call for help
which we so sorely need. "Cast thy burden upon
the Lord, and he shall sustain thee." Can you
stretch your imagination far enough to know the
metaphysical truth that the Christ within can bear
all burdens and let the one who trusts Him go
free?
We often wrap our troubles as a pleasant cloak
around us. We rejoice in being miserable. We like
to pour forth the story of our lives into any ear
ready to listen. All this is preposterous for crea
tures supposed to be radiant images of the Divine.
There is great truth in mental science, which
dwells only on perfection and ignores the passing
ache and pain. In essence we are perfect. "Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect." Let the Spirit carry you
through all your experiences. Trust a greater
Power for light and leading. No one walks alone.

Peace through Prayer
THE
chief trouble with this so-called progres
sive age is that it has left prayer out of the
scheme of things. The wires that should connect
man and his Maker have been cut by material
thinking, which causes a sharp cleavage between
earth and higher realms. At the other end of the
line, however, the connection has never been dis
turbed. The receiving and sending apparatus is
perfect.
You remember the Ancient Mariner, who killed
the albatross, the bird of good omen? The climax
of his suffering came when he found himself un
able to pray. Alone, on a wide sea of agony, he
suffered the torments of the damned until at last
a whisper of blessing crossed his lips, blessing of
the water snakes which before had seemed "slimy
things" crawling "with legs
Upon a slimy sea."
Now their colors radiant in the moonlight, they
shared with him in his utter loneliness the gift of
life, and suddenly they were transformed into
beauty so that unaware he blessed them. This
prayer, for all blessings are prayers, restored the
connection which he himself had broken by sin,

and straightway a group of angelic spirits came to
guide him to the home harbor.
In this deeply mystic poem Coleridge presents
a great truth, peace through prayer. The moment
man can pray, he opens the gates of heaven from
which comes immediate help. Immediate? Yes, in
the sense that a cause is set going. Sooner or later
the effect of that cause appears. In the meantime
the soul begins to find peace. If it has wandered
far, the process may or may not be slow. For the
average person the longer the journey into the far
country, the longer the return to the Father's
house. At the same time, with peace in the heart
distance becomes unimportant. A goal is in sight,
where before was aimless, miserable wandering
among the swine.
If your radio gives notes jangled, out of tune
and harsh, you call at once for an expert to put
your machine in order. How much more important
is the radio receiving set of your own soul ! In this
repair work, however, you must be your own
mechanic.
The world needs peace today. The twentieth
century was hailed with hope. It promised so
much. What do we see? A chaotic mass of hate,
suffering, despair. One lighthouse on a rocky coast
may save many a soul in the black night. Set your
light of peace aglow by steady prayer, sweet com
munion with those inner worlds of peace, whereby
the stormy waves in your own heart are stilled.

Seek and Ye Shall Find:
E all know the discomfort of hunting for
» » something we have lost. The realization that
there is nothing lost or mislaid, that everything
is in its right place, often works like a charm to
lead us to the spot in which with the perversity of
inanimate objects lies the missing treasure.
In a far deeper sense there is a seeking and a
finding. A desire long hidden in the heart eventu
ally materializes in concrete manifestation. Hence
the warning in all religions to think only the best
and most beautiful lest we attract evil and dis
aster. That which we most desire gravitates in our
direction as does also that which we most fear.
Look for trouble and we certainly find it.
There is another seeking and finding—the

Spirit with its light that "never shone on land or
sea." This is the only seeking worth the while, for
which the saints and mystics have counted the
world well lost. The inner voice of Truth still
speaks to the inner ear. The radiant light of an
other world still shines for the inner eye. The pa
tient hand of the Teacher still knocks at the inner
heart.

ashes to the touch. Power, wealth, position, beauty,

charm vanish at the turn of the road. These all are
gone, and what remains? Utter futility! "Storied
urn and animated bust" are cold comfort on the
road to the beyond. Short is the memory of man.
Monuments crumble in the sands of time as the
winds of oblivion sweep the broken bits into noth
ingness. All the seeking vain! Why? Because
nothing selfish can endure. If we would truly live,
we must forge our link with the eternal and iden
tify ourselves with the only truly permanent, the
world of Spirit.
"Seek and ye shall find." "Know thyself." It is
the inner man who takes the long journey from
which there is no escape. The inner man, the Spir
itual Self, must be sought and found if we are to
have peace on the pathway. We have the full as
surance, the knowledge of the true scale of values,
but we sell it for a song and go stripped ever after.
Weigh well what you would seek, for that will you
assuredly find. The sick man looks for health, the
miser for gold, the dictator for power, the butter
fly for beauty, the scholar for knowledge. Why not
ask yourself where you are going ?

Say It With Prayers
THERE
is a close relationship between prayers
and flowers. Each is an expression of divine
intent. Each is a form of worship to the highest
we know. Flowers on the altar mingle their per
fume with the incense of devotion, and their col
ors with the candles of adoration. A flower is a
prayer, reaching heavenward in beauty.
We little realize the power of prayer in daily
life. If we did, we would pray more, not for con
crete return but for the lifting of our vibrations
to a higher key. The philosopher's stone, whereby
base metal turned to gold, was no idle dream but a
profound metaphysical fact, symbolic of the power
of man to transform the base metal of material
thinking into the pure gold of spiritual reality.
Through prayer comes a stillness like oil on a
troubled sea. When all is calm, our being is more
easily attuned to higher ranges of thought and
feeling. In this higher vibration we can reach our
nearest and dearest on the direct line of purest
love, unselfish in its spiritual quality, asking noth
ing in return. These prayers of the spirit bring im
mediate response. If our eyes were opened, we
could see for ourselves. As it is, a live wire goes
into the invisible, carrying our message of love.
Meanwhile our receiving set becomes more nearly

In the silence commune with the Great Spirit.
Hopes, regrets, aspirations and failures dissolve
in the ocean which carries our bark on its bosom
to the haven where we would be. To each call
comes an immediate response in the purifying of

all rise heavenward in worship of the Highest.
Attune yourself to the invisible, and rise to the

The Agony in the Garden
IN
lesser degrees of anguish this experience
comes to most human beings. Sometimes it is
the result of loss, death, the suffering that is
worse than death. The black night of the soul de
scends on all who attempt to walk the upward
path. How shall the darkness be faced?
If we turn to the familiar scene of Gethsemane,
we find the answer in solitary communion with the
Great Spirit of whom we are a spark. There is no
help from any other source. No one can do for us
what we must do for ourselves. The agony must be
faced, mastered, and the outcome left in the hands
of Higher Powers, even if it means death upon the
cross.
There are many kinds of crosses, many forms of
death. The slow anguish of a broken heart, the at
tempt to carry on against hopeless odds, misunder
standings, mental cruelty that takes all joy from
the days and makes them a torment —each in its
own way is a small Gethsemane.
Is there no ray of light in the fog? No source
of spiritual strength ? Turn to the garden for your
answer. You find a night of prayer—alone— and
at the end complete resignation to the will of God.
There is no other way. Keep unsevered your con
nection with the higher realms. Never lose touch

In the ultimate analysis nothing can harm a soul

The Summons to Prayer
ONE
of the most touching practices in the
Mohammedan belief is the call to prayer,
when great multitudes prostrate themselves before
Allah, the Supreme One. It matters not what we
call the Divine Creative Intelligence but it makes
all the difference in the world whether we recog
nize it or not. The present day with its ever recur
ring crises of war and preparation for war de
mands a recognition of the vital need of this sum
mons to prayer.
Indeed, the cause of all the trouble in the world
today is the complete lack of spirituality in the
make-up of most of the people in it. Only a few
lights illumine the darkness, where awakened
souls are steadfast in their cry for guidance and
inspiration. Free will allows us to go only so far;
then the effects of the bad causes we have set in
motion begin to operate and we are brought to a
halt. In the suffering that ensues we turn to the
Power we have been neglecting and send out a
call for help. By that time the radio system which
should link us with higher realms of activity has
become rusted by lack of use. Time is perforce
lost until we are in a position to make the connec
tion which we ourselves have broken by our own
wilful stupidity.

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
You see then how necessary it is to keep our
contact with the Supreme. Daily meditation, or
prayer, is vital in the life of man. It is really more
important than food or drink, for what is the use
of a well-nourished physical body in which a with
ered soul rattles like the shrunken kernel of a bad
nut. The shell is valueless, fit only for the refuse-
heap.
It is a mad world, my masters. Values com
pletely reversed ! The cart put before the horse in
a crazy patchwork which would make the high
gods laugh were it not so utterly tragic ! The trag
edy is not so much for those who know and fail
to practice. They deserve all the punishment in
store for them. But the real tragedy is for those
who have never been taught what life is all about.
Like Topsy, they "just grow" —a physical shell.
For this neglect it were better that the so-called
teachers of the young, including their parents,
should tie a mill-stone about their necks and be
cast into the bottom of the sea.
Is it too late? No, suffering usually brings us to
our senses. The pity is that the young should have
to suffer for the folly of their elders. Think this
over, you parents and teachers. Are you the blind,
leading the blind toward a bottomless pit? Or do
you hear the call to prayer and bow in reverence
before the Power in Whom we all must live and
move and have our being?
Great is Allah! May His peace abide with us!

"Thy Kingdom Come to Us"
WHAT
is the kingdom? When and how will it
come? We pray for its appearance on earth
as it is in heaven. We accept it in faith as the per
fection of all our hopes and dreams. We forget that
the kingdom is within us, not without. It must
come first in the hearts of men before it can find
material expression. It is spiritual in its essence
and is marked by the fruits of the spirit: "love,
joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance."
A far cry from the kingdom when we look at the
earth today! The opposite of each of these spiritual
qualities is on the rampage. The lights on our
tragic star are dimmed by deep fogs of ignorance
and sin. But even one light gives hope of the lifting
of the miasma and a blowing clear by the winds of
restored faith.
Through the dark night of the soul strength
comes ; great is the reward of those who pass the
test. No one can go forward, however, unless his
will is one-pointed and his heart pure. Many fires
refine the gold. Not an ounce of dross can remain.
When the kingdom comes in one heart, other
lives catch the light of Spirit. The glow spreads as
the sunlight which thaws the ice in frozen
streams before the buds of spring appear. The in

fluence of one life for good is beyond measure.
Only so can the kingdom come—"Not by might,
nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of
hosts."
The kingdom within ! A universal realm, not ex
clusive property fenced and guarded. Selfishness
cannot enter, or greed, or general uncharitable-
ness. Vibrations of harmony are the essential, har
mony with the Divine Will, whereby men rise to
the stature of their full possibilities.
Would it not seem the part of wisdom to learn
more about this kingdom ? Material treasures stay
in a material world. Man moves on alone, with only
himself for company, drawn to those on his own
level. If he is far from home, he must arise in due
time and go to the Father. Meanwhile wasted lives,
lost opportunities, pitiful ignorance, unnecessary
suffering! If the selfish ambition which impels
many people could only be turned to the Father's
business, what miracles would follow! Great laws
lie beyond our knowledge —beauty, peace, fulfill
ment exceeding the power of the human mind to
conceive. Meanwhile we walk in darkest night
through which no stars can shine. Hearts break
under the load ; the light of the Spirit flickers and
seems to die.
All the time the kingdom within us waits for the
magic word which will make it ours, the word
which signifies our glad obedience to the will of our
Heavenly Father. "Not my will but Thine be done."
So be it!

Our Daily Bread
IVE us this day our daily bread." How often
>J we say this prayer with no realization of its
power.
"What man is there of you, whom if his son ask
bread, will he give him a stone ?—If ye then, being
evil, know how to give good gifts unto your chil
dren, how much more shall your Father which is
in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?"
The apostles went on their respective missions
with no money in their possession, no food, no
material means of support. The old prophets were
fed by the ravens. The marching hosts received
manna in the wilderness. But never forget that
great was their faith. Material food is necessary,
yes, for a material body. But greater far is the
spiritual food which is ours for the asking. There
fore we are told to seek first the kingdom of
heaven and all these things will be added unto us.
On the contrary, we put the material before the
spiritual. We say to ourselves, "I must plan for the
future. I must save for my old age. I must see that
we have enough to carry us through." So like the
young man who had many possessions we center
on the material and in time build such a prison-
house around our souls that we walk in darkness.

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
The bread of heaven, the water of the Spirit
whereby we neither hunger nor thirst any more!
By the simple act of faith the spiritual reservoirs
open to our needs when we put Spirit first. We are
so accustomed to the importance of worldly goods
that we forget entirely the transitory nature of
all things material. The savings of a life-time can
be swept away over night. A turn of Fortune's
wheel and all is gone. But Spirit ever remains. It
passes even the gates of death.
Our daily bread! In such unexpected ways it
comes. We think we have the whole burden to
carry. If we would only cast our care on the great
spiritual forces around us, we should fare much
better. Personal plans fail through lack of wisdom
or circumstances over which we have no control.
God's plans can never fail. If we through our own
ignorance and lack of faith make a mess of things,
the Providence that rules our ends works on none
theless and gives us help in spite of ourselves.
This help may be material or spiritual. Sometimes
it comes in the form of release from the physical
entirely. Unhappy the soul, however, who has so
concentrated on the material that he has lost sight
of the spiritual. He cannot have light until he
seeks it with all his heart—that daily bread with
out which the earth is a wilderness and the dark
night of death dark indeed.

Thanksgiving
GIVE thanks unto the Lord; for he is good:
V-f for his mercy endureth forever." So sings
the Psalmist. The prayer-book has a magnificent
thanksgiving in which all the forces of Nature, the
angelic hosts, and all living things join in a paean
of praise. This sense of gratitude is a purifying
force as refreshing as a long draught of water
from an ice-cold spring. The whole make-up of man
is refreshed in a glow of well-being. The frozen
gates of the heart are unlocked. The gladness that
pours forth longs to spend itself on others, to
share the joy that overflows.
This is one of the secrets of the Christmastide.
Every evil force seems suspended in that sacred
and hallowed time. Even the most wretched, unless
their armor is too thickened by selfish misery,
thrill to the general sense of kindly well-being.
Since thoughts are things, kind vibrations fill the
atmosphere. The happiness of children leavens the
lump, and for a brief season the dark star shines.
Why must this experience of grateful good
will be limited to one part of the year only? How
can we carry into our own daily lives the Christ
mas peace? It takes steady practice of an almost
literal acceptance of our Lord's teachings : the re
turn of good for evil; the forgiveness of wrongs,

real or fancied ; daily communion wherein our spir
itual natures are refreshed, strengthened, and pu
rified ; the acceptance of God's will for us ; constant
dependence on the promises of light and leading.
A few rare souls have attained this daily radi
ance which most of us feel in greater or less degree
at the festival periods only. By so much we lose
the joy of living which would otherwise be ours —
that carefree joy of children at play, the delight
ful abandon of most young creatures who have no
burdens.
If we are miserable, we have only ourselves to
thank. Somewhere along the line we have set a
cause in motion which can bring only suffering.
Such debts must be paid. But they can be met
graciously, if not thankfully. Only by paying the
obligation can we win our freedom. The sooner,
the better for all concerned!
No two people look at so-called calamity in ex
actly the same way. To some it is a challenge that
bids them
"Not sit nor stand but go!"
To others it is a crushing blow that paralyzes and
utterly confuses. A few even relish misery and roll
it as a sweet morsel under their tongue. Such
people are plague-spots in the body social.
Grasp the small moments of joy. Watch for
them. Thrill to them. The clouds at sunset, Orion

no birds sing"—so many works declare the glory
of God. "They worship and magnify Him forever."
Of all His creation, only man with the gift of
free-will brings ruin and destruction, hate and
murder to what was once an earthly paradise. So
the night of darkness sets in, the black night of
the soul, the sojourn among the swine, and then
at last the return from the far country.
Most of us return a little way at Thanksgiving
and Christmas. The powerful vibrations at work
reach even the dullest minds and hearts. For some
who think they are lonely, these recurring festi
vals bring only sadness. But loneliness is selfish
self-centeredness.
"No one ever walks alone
If in his heart be love ;

How little we know and understand!
We come from a world of which we remember
nothing. If we are fortunate, love awaits us; ten
der hands care for our helplessness. Gradually we
begin to know and love in return those to whose
protection our infancy and youth have been en
trusted.
The wheel of time slowly revolves. Our eyes and
thoughts are centered on the future. Bright hopes
beckon. The happy days are always just ahead, al
ways just beyond our reach. Heavier years weigh
us down; duties and responsibilities burden us.
Still our dreams center on the future with better
days just over the horizon.
Gradually we realize the greater part of our
lives is behind us. In thought we return to those
happy years now gone —years that at the time we
did not appreciate, did not know as the blessings
they really were. The mind lives more and more
in the past as it completes the cycle of one more
life experience.
Then comes the moment of farewell. The dear
arms that welcomed us are once more waiting, but

going is even greater than the miracle of our com

wise. We know we shall meet our own. It is truly
a "joyful quest."
How much happiness, though, we have missed
along the way. First, the future beckoned us ; then,
the past. Meanwhile the blessings of the present
went unrecognized until it was too late.
Our only consolation is the sure knowledge that
each experience had its purpose, its meaning in
our development. Some day, somewhere, somehow
we shall understand ; while the loving peace of the
Christ consciousness transmutes every sorrow in
to joy, every loss into gain. The road is long, and
uphill all the way; but at the top Love waits for
us, the mists are gone, and in the Eternal Now
we find the goal so long beyond our reach.
Hail and Farewell! The Alpha and the Omega,
"the beginning and the ending sent from above."
Even in us is that Christ-force, seeking ever for

The Blessing of a Contrite Heart
""DEFORE the ear can hear, it must have lost
its sensitiveness to the outer world." Be
fore the path can be entered, the "feet must be
washed in the blood of the heart." The appeal of
the outer world is no longer heard when the heart
is broken. Tears dim "the garish day." Pride no
longer rules the will. The values of life take their
proper place and assume their right . proportion.
Man's whole outlook changes. His feet, "washed in
the blood of the heart," are ready to take the first
step upon the path.
Only by the ascent of this path does the aspirant
reach the kingdom. Blessed therefore are the poor,
the contrite and humble in spirit: for "theirs is the
kingdom of heaven." Pride has no place now when
earthly ambitions lie broken and the futility of
selfish planning for material ends becomes ap
parent. We can understand why this beatitude
comes first. It gives the key to the series. With
out the suffering that comes from personal loss,
without the closing of the outer senses to worldly
pride, the inner vision cannot open. The true direc
tion of man's pilgrimage cannot be found. Lost in
quagmires of his own making, his feet, stained
with the blood of the heart, must find the true
path to the homeland.

Consider well the true scale of values. Lucifer fell

The Blessing of the Meek
"T)LESSED are the meek: for they shall inherit
the earth." Who are the meek? Those who
are willing to submit their will to God's will. It is
a paradox that we gain our life by losing it. The
same holds true in this matter of making our wills
God's will. All things are His in heaven and on
earth. With Him there is no lack, no restriction,
no care and worry. "The earth and the fulness
thereof" are His, the sea and all that is therein.
By union with Him we become automatically heirs
of His kingdom.
Strangely enough, however, when we have
reached that stage of union we no longer care for
earthly power. Inheriting the earth holds little at
traction when once we have grasped the meaning
of life here and its relation to life beyond. Three
score years and ten are not eternity. Why not
build for eternity ?
The trouble is so few understand the real con
tinuity of soul experience. Here today and gone
tomorrow! What is the use? To the average man
who has forgotten, or never really knew, the mean
ing of soul development, life may indeed be
"a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."

THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT
Or he may be so puffed up by temporary worldly
success that he thinks himself a little lord of cre
ation. What folly! How few down the ages are re
membered either for good or ill!
Why does our Lord, then, bless the meek? "Ex
cept ye become as little children, ye shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven." "Seek ye first the
kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added unto you." In other
words, material blessings are an effect, in which
the truly spiritual man is not primarily interested.
His interest is to further the coming of his Fa
ther's kingdom. The change of focus, however, en
ables him to gain a long-range view wherein past
and present, present and future assume their right
proportion. He knows the "why's" and the
"wherefore's." The earth is truly his because to
him it means little or nothing. He stands upon it
as upon a springboard to test his strength and
agility for conquests yet to come —tests of will and
lofty purpose.
By the perversity of fate, or what you will, when
we no longer want what we have once so fervently
desired, we find it in our grasp. When the earth
is truly ours, it no longer interests us except as we
can use it as a testing ground toward heaven.

To Those Who Mourn
IT
is difficult for those in deep sorrow to realize
the true meaning of the experience known as
death. To us left behind there seems to be only
the anguish of separation, often doubt, and even
despair. If we only knew the rapture of the souls
who have been released as God's children from the
shadows of the physical world! It is like coming
out of a smoky tunnel into glorious sunlight under
a blue sky. We must, of course, stay our appointed
time and do our appointed work, but it is an insult
to a loving Father to doubt for one moment that
our dear ones are not far better off in His care
than they were in ours. His care is on all the
planes, but in the physical world we are prone to
forget His nearness and feel that we must do
everything ourselves. He has told us to cast our
burden on Him. He has assured us that we are
ever in His keeping. He has promised to take us to
the place prepared for us, one of the many man
sions. But when our loved ones precede us on the
path that all must travel, we doubt His wise Prov
idence. We set our puny wills against His divine
will and dare to question and rebel.
Must His promises be proved as if they were
mathematical formulae? Must we see the unseen
before we can believe? Must we feel the wounds

those "that have not seen, and yet have believed."
Grief is selfish. It draws our dear ones earth

God's keeping, knowing that He doeth all things
well.
"Strong Son of God, immortal Love,
Whom we, that have not seen thy face,
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
Believing where we cannot prove;
"Thou wilt not leave us in the dust :
Thou madest man, he knows not why ;

The Blessing of Sorrow
FOR
those in grief there is a special blessing —
"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall
be comforted." Of what nature is that comfort?
Only those who have known can tell. Even for
them words are difficult. The language of the heart
is a silent tongue.
We look back over the years and find so many
changes, changes which seem to us for the worse.
Familiar landmarks gone—beloved faces vanished !
There seems no adequate recompense for our
agony of personal loss. Yet we have a sacred prom
ise, the blessing of comfort. How does this comfort
come? What form does it take?
Closed in by our five senses, —"cabin'd, cribb'd,
confined" —we cannot know the truth of the un
seen except by intuitions and impressions, —in
tangibles which mean far more than anything we
can see, hear, touch, taste, or smell. Peace comes
in sleep, sometimes happy dreams. A deep, inner
consciousness of immortality cannot be denied.
The loss of all we held dear opens the gates to a
world far more permanent and real than the tor
tured star on which most men and women spend a
worried existence. Without sorrow we are self-sat
isfied. We have no interest in eternal verities. The

■world of the senses claims us completely and shuts
us in a prisonhouse of vain imaginings.
Sorrow stirs the spirit to activity. It shakes off
self-satisfied contentment. It tries the wings of
escape to a light that does not singe and an air
that does not stupify. "Blessed are they that
mourn." Only through sorrow comes comfort. The
eternal riddle must be solved by every human soul.
That soul will never rouse from sleep unless shaken
by loss and grief.
Rain falls to refresh the earth. Without it there
could be no flowers or fruits, no carpet of grass, no
bower of leaves in hot noontides. Sorrow likewise
recreates the heart, softening the hardness, mel
lowing, refining, purifying. Comfort comes in
countless ways: growth of soul, sensitiveness to
human needs, and most priceless gift, the knowl
edge that there is no loss, no separation in the
world of spirit.

The Blessing of the Truth-Seekers
""OLESSED are they which do hunger and thirst
after righteousness : for they shall be filled."
The desire must come first, then the fulfillment.
It is the wish that is always father to the thought.
Then if the will is strong enough, results inevi
tably follow. There is a great body of secret teach
ing unknown to the multitude. It is reserved for
the inner school, for the disciples who through
sacrifice and devotion have earned the right to the
knowledge for which they thirst. "Ask for the
truth, and it shall be given to you; seek God and
you shall find Him; knock at the gates of God's
spirit-world and it shall be opened to you."
The teaching comes in strange ways. We are
guided to the right book ; we hear the right lecture
or sermon; we meet the right friend; we go
through the right experiences. It is these experi
ences which are so very necessary. It seems at
times as if we had endured about all we could for
one incarnation. Then another crushing experience
comes our way and we long for death. Disillusion
ment is complete. This is the testing-time. There
can be no retreat. We have knocked at the door
of knowledge. We must enter the portals of the
way. It is perforce the way of the cross.

Yet remember the blessing: the hunger will be
satisfied ; the thirst will be quenched. Who are we
that we should question the terms? The great
laws of the house of learning must be obeyed. If
we lack the necessary requirements we must per
force wait until our preparation is complete. It is
no light thing to ask for knowledge. Strong hearts,
stout courage must meet the test. This is no path
for weaklings. It is for that very reason a glorious
road, trodden by a noble company. When trials be
come too crushing, hands are stretched out to help.
When darkness is too intense, a ray of light pene
trates the blackness. Rich is the reward beyond all
comprehension, but count well the cost. Every debt
must be paid to the uttermost farthing. Every in
terest must be subordinated to this one goal. Long
is the road and uphill all the way, but at the end
peace and priceless illumination.

The Blessing of the Merciful
""DLESSED are the merciful: for they shall ob-
tain mercy." By the law of cause and effect
this beatitude explains itself. We reap what we
sow. Our actions return to us like boomerangs for
good or ill. The Lord's Prayer bids us to ask for
giveness of our sins in the same measure that we
forgive those who trespass against us. Only as we
forgive others can we hope to be forgiven our
selves.
"We do pray for mercy ;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy."
There is good reason for the precept, "Let not
the sun go down upon your anger." All debts must
be repaid to the last infinitesimal measure of jus
tice. Accumulated resentment only adds to the bur
den which must be discharged to the last jot and
tittle before the soul can climb the path upward. If
this debt is not paid in one life it remains to be dis
charged in another. The law is automatic in its
workings. This apparent severity is in its essence
the most loving kindness. The patient cannot re
cover until he has been purged of all impurities.
The sooner this is done, the speedier is the restora
tion to health. Why carry over a load of bitter

ness? Only by mercy to others can we obtain
mercy for ourselves.
We, too, have many debts. We, too, must meet
judgment. Who is so perfect that he has not
wronged another soul? It may have been only in
thought, but thought is so powerful that it can
cause definite injury to a soul in a negative, re
ceptive condition, tuned to receive that particular
vibration. Our angry thoughts stir up anger in
others, just as thoughts of love and mercy clear
troubled atmospheres with healing power in their
wings. We may have a load of accumulated debt
of which in this life we have no knowledge. We
can work out only so much at a time. Nothing,
however, wipes the slate clean so quickly as a gen
erous attitude of non-judgment, patience, long suf
fering, and mercy.
The unseen seems so far away, so non-existent.
If we but realized the vital reality of invisible
forces, we should control the lower emotions of
anger, hate, desire for revenge, and rise above
their forked lightnings to a higher plane of peace
and security.
Only as we forgive, can we hope to receive for
giveness. In other words, our souls must be purged
of earth-binding poison before we can leave the
prison-house of our own making to rise to realms
of light and healing. We should pay our debts

The Blessing of Purity
""DLESSED are the pure in heart : for they shall
experience the nearness of God in their
lives." The Sermon on the Mount is the essence of
all Christ's teaching. We need only these few lines
to show us the way, the truth, and the life. There
is nothing complicated, abstract, or unintelligible.
The directions are clear and unmistakable.
Why is purity of intention all important? The
complex mechanism of man is easily clogged by
the obstructions of the senses. The machine re
fuses to go but can readily slide down the nearest
precipice. Purity implies perfect running order —
oil in the mechanism, oneness of purpose. When
the aim is clear, it is easier to reach the goal,
granted sufficient will power.
"My strength is as the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure."
By purity is not meant colorless innocence. Purity
implies cleansing, a washing away of all that
hinders, a one-pointed determination to live in the
Higher Self.
Lifted above the fogs and morasses, the vision
clears. The soul sees with the eye of Spirit. With
unerring intuition it finds the short cut to Truth.
In a poetic as well as a literal sense, the complex
being that is man, freed from all burden of the

lower nature, links his aims with the Eternal.
Spirit beckons him onward and upward. The fet

Why does this beatitude mean so much? It is
the key to all spiritual achievement. Other bless
ings follow as effects from this supreme conquest.
With the cleansing as by fire only pure gold re
mains. Such purity comes only from struggle, suf
fering, and hardship. Like children we cling to
the toys of human life which must be pulled from

""D LESSED are the peacemakers: for they shall
be called the children of God." Today, especi
ally, we feel this need. Today we have a magnifi
cent opportunity to demonstrate our kinship with
the Father. Perhaps at no other time in world
history has such a pressing need arisen, for now
as never before the whole world is bound together
by inventions and discoveries. The radio and the
airplane have helped to annihilate distance in time
and space. News flashes come with the speed of
thought. What injures one branch of the human
family harms all, so close is the connection.
As never before, we are our brother's keeper.
What hurts him rebounds like a boomerang on us.
We can no longer pass by on the other side. This
does not mean we are not to mind our own busi
ness; but it does mean we are to stand ready to
help.
How can we help in the great effort for peace?
Hate runs wild among all races and peoples. Com
mercial competition, class strife, racial antago
nism, nation against nation in the lust for power!
How can our Lord find peace upon the earth? All
power is His to carry out the Divine Plan. We, as
creatures of free will, must know "our wills are
ours" to make them His. That is the test.

Love must replace hate. The relative importance
of ephemeral versus eternal values must be crys
tal-clear. What does it profit individuals or na
tions if they gain the whole world and lose their
own soul? We forget that vengeance is the Lord's
—not ours. We are admonished to forgive until
seventy times seven.
The role of the peacemaker is not easy. He may
be misunderstood and abused by the very ones he
seeks to help. No rosy path is promised to those on
the upward way. But inner peace is theirs, free
dom from worry since a Great Power bears their
burdens; close contact with spiritual forces gives
flashes of intuition ; a higher wisdom guides them
as they help unfold the plan for men.
No relation is more precious than that of a child
to its father. Our Father is primarily the Prince of
Peace. Blessed, therefore, are those who through
prayer and guidance make their wills His in pour
ing oil on troubled waters. They radiate waves of
His love and compassion for all His children. In
time, above the maelstrom of angry seas will come

those who work to prepare the way. They are the

Why try to combat stupidity, selfishness, and
greed? Why try to spread ideas ahead of the time?
Where would progress be if no one had had the
courage to pioneer, to dream dreams, and see
visions ? The world would have remained in a state
of barbarism even greater than that of today if
the prophets and the martyrs had not had the
courage of their convictions. The scorned idea of
yesterday becomes the accepted standard of to
morrow. Gradually light spreads even though the
light-bringer may have been nailed to a cross.
"The noble army of martyrs" —a glorious host !
Blessed indeed is he whose soul so burns in devo
tion to truth that he is willing to sacrifice even life
itself for what he believes. Resistless is the power
of such selfless devotion. In the loss of the small,
personal self the Higher Self is found. Such a one
loses his life only to save it. He has been an active
agent in the God-drama of humanity. Somewhere,
some time other heroic hearts will kindle in the
flame he helped to carry, and so will dawn a new
day of Truth as God's plan for men unfolds. A
privilege, indeed, to have a part in so glorious a
mission!

Treasures in Heaven
IT
is not easy to impress the minds of people in
the material world, where so much centers on
material possessions, with the sure conviction that
we are born to lay up treasures in Heaven, as the
Lord Christ taught so many centuries ago. What
are the essential treasures to which the human
race and every soul in it is heir? Treasures of
long-suffering and compassion, faith in the spirit
ual wealth of the unseen, belief in God's love for
His creation, gratitude for beauty and eyes to see
it—in short, all the joyful confidence that comes
from the knowledge that a host of ministering
helpers surround us when through our own sinful
ignorance we dash our feet against the stones.
It is imperative that we learn these truths in
the earth life, for without them we fail to grow
to the measure of which we otherwise should have
been capable. Then beyond the veil come regrets
for what might have been, and a determination to
right old wrongs.
We want you to think of the invisible helpers as
busy still with the affairs of earth. How can great
souls rest when so much is wrong in the world
and people so blind? Bands of workers are more
than occupied trying to soften the effects of the
crimes against humanity perpetrated here. In
