SECOND BOOK of VISIONS.
T
HE Continuation ofJoseph Prescott’s Visions,.
and the Explanation of them, given by the .
Spirit to Joanna Soutbcott; to shew you all that the
• night is far spent, and the day is at hand, that all
the Prophet -Joel’s words shall be fulfilled.
*
* For I now warn the whole world, by thee,
and by him, that my Bible is near to the end, and
all shall be as the Prophet Joel tells you :—the end
will come by visions seen by young men, and pro-
E
hecies given.by my handmaids. Now. they are
oth before you;* and all I said in my Gospel is
notf like the green leaves in the spring ; then know
that your redemption is, like your summer, nigh at
hand : and like your husbandmen are my disciples,
preparing for the summer fruit, to bring forth the
increase, and to try the ground of every heart.
u For every heart I know:
In him that’s little in his own eyes
The seed will surely grow;
But he that’s great will find deceit
From his own heart appear; ^
And as ’tis drawing to the night,
That night will foil him here.

I've shewn you plain, from every sign,
That^all my Bible's clear ;
I've shewn the branches and the vilie.
And told you I am here :
The shadow first on you did burst,
To prove my prophet true;
'But now the substance is the last,
That every soul shall know."
A pril4th, T80S.
Tbe following was given to Joanna, in answer
to people's saying that Joseph Prescott’s visions,
and her explanations of them, were “ w itty inven­
tions and’ Joanna was answered by the Spirit
from the 8th chapter of Proverbs.
* Now I’U'appear to answer here,
My mind I yillunfbld:
As dead to knowledge man appears,
The truth from all is told;
And dead in sin do all begin
To moulder into dust;
/ Their understanding aU is gone,
In every age t’waa cast. «
Then Satan here cannot appear,
> To prove rodn was not dead;
And so the liar 111 condemn,
Men’s senses all are fled.
So I’ll begin from Solomon,
Who wisdom had of ms ;
The charmer’s voice to all is come,
Yet there’s but few do see,
His wisdom must in all appear
Unto the sous of men;
And from the Proverbs I shall clear,
And will mankind condemn.
Wisdom in ms, they all .shall see,
It doth ivith prudence dwell;
And “ wit's invention” all is here,
To shake the powers ofhelf.
Digitized by Google
For there’s no man on earth can come
To prove no wit is here:
The wise and learned I'll condemn,
If they do now appear,
To say from man this wit did come;
And all together weigh,
Then wit's invention, it must be known,
Is in that youth and thee.
So here's the she, let all men see,
Hath wit's invention found ;
And 'tis not your divinity
Can all her wit confound.
Wiser than man the woman's come,
If you give her this praise,
That her invention this hath done;
Then now discern her ways:
She thought a thing, and made it plain,
Like Sheba's queen came here,
And then she found a Solomon, '
To make her wisdom clear.
For so you see that youth must be,
If he invent the whole,
And in one likeness all agree;
You must confess np fool
Could thus invent, as all is sent;
So wisdom must be here.
Before the earth's foundation laid
My wisdom bright appear'd;
But you complain, ye sons of men,
That wisdom speaks too low,
To be from God, as you have said;
Then now your wisdom shew. t .
My Bible's high, you all do cry,
As none do understand;
And so you give it all the He,
As it is plac'd by man:
For every way 'lit plac'd by you,.
Ye simple sons of men ;
In judgment you do not agree,
Then how can you contend
That you are right, when to your sight
You one the other blame,
And like the sand your wisdpra stands,
That you can never join ?
But here are two, before your view,
That new havejoin'd the whole;
And will you say in them’t did lie,
And make yourselves such fools,
A j

That you can't be as wise as theyr
To make your Bibles join,
As these have done from prophecies,
And made the whole to bind ?
Together stand: behold the sand,
How it ran every hour,
Until the whole they both command,
And bound beyond your power,
That none can break, for great's the weight,.
As great the end they'll see,
For to confound in every sound,
And own it came from me,
Whose wisdom high did ever lie
Out of the reach of m an;
And when the woman I did create,
This was my every plan,
For to bring in my ways to m a n ,
My wisdom and ray power;
But if to man 1 so should come,
He would the whole devour.
As man alone a god becomesr
Above the human race; .
If I had so exalted m a n ,
His Lord he'd soon disgrace :
Above my Son man soon would come,
If he had wisdom all:
Because you see a Solomon
From grace did quickly fall.
So wisdom here, in man t appear,
I say 'twill never do,
Till Satan is destroyed here ;
And bring all to your view.
The woman, see, was made by me,
And man did me condemn;
So now I’ll tell the mystery:
All shall come back again ;
And first on man it back must come,
For man to answer here,
Why he condemn'd the woman's hand,
And never did appear
To tell her plain, her thoughts are vain,
To think a worm like she
Should ever know what I. would do,
And prove the mind of me
A different way than I did say,
If they would this prevent;
But as they did not so agree,
I say my mind is bent

For to condemn the sons of men—
Like Adam I’ll appear: '
The woman, I have given to you, ’ ^
Hath offer'd good fruit here; . \
Which you refuse, and will not chuse,
Then I'll refuse you all. ’
The woman, see, is given by me,
And now behold your call; -
Or else, I say like him, that day,
You're out of Eden cast:
If men with Satan now agree,
Then both alike shall burst. *
For I'll speak plain, ye sons of men, *
Your Maker now is come %
To call you to a strict account;
Look back at what you've done;
The woman's hand against you stands,,
If you her Lord deny. ' * ,*
The shepherds I will never clear— */
The letters all must see, ‘ •
That hi my name to them were sent,
If silent they appear'd, -
To tell them 'twas thy full intent r
To publish for the Lord, ' ‘
That in my name the writings came, ^
Their silence gave consent; ' ,
And they shall know my every name-^
And now my iriind is bent ' ,
For to condemn the sons of men, . *
If they do now agree * •
To say thy writings came from hell— . *
Then where's their love for me ?
Against the king had this been done,
Your fury would appear, .
And seek to know if it was so— ‘
No poverty would clear, .
1 say, a thing against the king,
If she had forg'd his name ; t ,, '
For all to justice men would bring, . ’
And put them all to shame. , .
But for your God no love you've shewM,
If you judg'd this from hell;' ’
And so you let it fly abroad }' t . ,,
By silence he compell’d *
My shepherds their not to appear;
Then he their hearts must gain,
Never to see the mystery,

To stop her hand, or to condemn—
-
Vain men, I tell you her^
Her guilt I'll cast on every man9
If wrong she doth appear;
Because to all, both great and small.
She wamiug sent to all; ,
And there's no man that stay'd her hand,
Or tald her wrongs the call;
Or came to know if itwasso,
To hare the truth be tried,
What prophecies she'd written true;
But all was thrownaside,
As though m j name she might blaspheme;

For those who do appear,
The tryth tp kndw, and prince it so;
They'll find the dove appear
To bring thepi peace, that shall increase-­
No man can foil them bare;
Because my eye so dose shall fly;
Whatman doth not discern.
They soon will see a mystery, »
To beep my friends from barm.
The dove ispeace, your $ears may cease;
If floods m man do s
I'll so appear, my dove clear.
To tnun^ph over hell.
And overmen, if they contend—
Thrfharmless dove they'll see
How much she'condescends to men,
That they her judge should be.
But they wooldnot; now see their lot;
To speak is all in vain;
For if they now do cast a blot,
I will her cause maintain
Against all men who do contend;
And so the doves I'll clear;
And all my’doves shall see my love;
For I am hbvering here."

FIFTH V ISIO N .
On Friday, ^4pril\5th, 1803, Joseph Prescott
saw this vision as he was going to bed.
He saw a band which held a box with the lid
open, wherein was a quantity of5
pieces -of gold, as
large as halfcrowns, with reading on some of them,
which he could not distinguish; andn voice ut­
tered these words—*
* Thi* is.a cabinet o f graces,
which I, the Lord, have 4o bestow on my people:
and*let the sinner take care that he sinneth not
against me, lest I lock it up from him. ,It is the
representation o f the Bible, and its contents.”
The following was given to Joanna in answer
to the vision shewn to Joseph Prescott, of the
box of gold and grapes, &c. See.
“ The box which is opened before you, shews-
what is in store tor my friends, that are longing
for my coming, and ase workers with mb to bring
in my kingdom. There is your reward, -spiritual
and temporal: there are the grapes hanging in
clusters, .without any interruption; and so is the
vision; so that nothing, appears to Uast your hap­
piness : neither will there be any interruption to
your happiuess when my kingdom comes down
below; all will be handed down to you, as that
vision appeareth. But as the two disputed about v
the box; so will men dispute about the coming
of my kingdom: some will say one way, and
some will say another w ay; and so men will place
it to their own judgment which way it will come.
'* But bow to reason Til begin.
The box and till do now appear;
For so the parting it is there,
Wherein at first thou putt’st the seal;
And every mystery HI reveal.
For in the box is seal’d my word :
Man shall be happy with his Ix>rd,
And my delight shall be with roan;
For so at first 1 laid my plan ;
Digitized by Google
And now that plan I will complete,
And all shall find there's no deceit.
For as the box to you appears, >
It is thy sealed writings there, '
That mendid open to their view;
And all did judge their God was true:
That he hjs word would now*fulfil,
And I shall bruise the serpent's heel,
Or by my heel shall bruise his head;
For so the promises are laid.
And so thti box does now appear:
Thou, know'll the citcle it ift there,
Wherein the four stars are foond-r-
If ye have wisdom, judge the sound;
For in the middle stands the seal,
. That unto man I shall reveal. <
It Is the seal, and 'tis my word, ■
For to avenge my dying blood '
Upon the serpent, as 'tis plao'd;
When I redeem the fallen raoe; ,
. And now this race I will redeem, .
As I have said, without a seam. ,
For as the box does now appear,
So full of splendbr you see there,
Just so the box is now seal'd up;
And so the end to men will drop, .
That now in faith do strong appear;
They'll find the key for all is there.
, But as thoo say'st 'tis up and down,
Just so the end will now be found.
For I have open’d it to man,
To shew you how the box doth stpnd:
You see the top it now is red,
And so the seals thereon are laid ;
But when t#e inside doth appear,
You all will find that vision’s near ;
Because my word shall ever stand.
When men thy writings all command,
They'll own the box doth so appear;
And perfect like this vision here,
I told thee I had gold in store,
To build Jerusalem’s ruins here:
I said my kingdom should come down
With every splendor man to crown;
I said my vines should clusters bring.

And bring them all to see my death;
And let them see their living faith,
Which way they judge nay blood will fall:
The day of vengeance, known to all,
Was in my heart for to appear :
The law and gospel you see clear.* *
So now appear, ye righteous men,
If you like mb have laid your plan,
The sinners yon must wish to free—
Think on my words at Calvary,:
• * * Fatheri they fount not whatihejf da •
. I crav’d their pardon; *o most you:
If that my spirit you have-gotf , t
The sins of men you'd wish to blot.
And cast all on the Tempter's bead; *'
And to like mb would be your pleady *
Which- every will will find is near. ’ *
But man knows not what he doth .do-y
The visions, open'd to their view, • •
Do with my Bible all agree; , ** #
And every word I’ve spoke to thee
Doth in these visions all appear ;
And yet 1 see that man doth err* ., !*

So let the other vision come,
And then Til answer thee again." , ‘'
SIXTH VISIOX.
On St. George’s Day,. A pril 23d, 1803, Joseph
Prescott saw the fotlowing vision, at four o’clock
in the afternoon; of a crown composed of dia­
monds, of a rich and curious form; the bottom
part of which was four square, on which were
four short pillars, four large arches, and several
small ones adjoining, in a serpentine form. At
the top of them was aball formed with diamonds,
brancnes of diamonds spreading from the ball, top
and bottom, different ways, in the form of six
cornucopias, encircled in a circle o f glory.
Being at a loss how to describe the vision, and
pausing over it, lie heard these words : “ Joseph,
tell myservant to stile it a crown : fo r it is a repre­
sentation o f the complete fulness of the Godhead
bodily”

S E V E N T H V IS IO N .
Sunday, M ay 8th, 1803, Joseph Prescott saw the
following vision. At the further end of the room
where he sat, he beheld seven angels as large as
middling sized men, dressed in white robes. They
stood very close together. At the right of them
was placed a small angel, with a piece of green
plant in his band. At the left o f them stood a
garden-pot full of mould or earth. The last an­
gel of the seven, on the left hand side, beckoned
to the small angel, to come to him. The small
angel went and took the garden-pot, and placed
it on the table' before Mr. Carpenter, on which
his books, visions, Ac. lay, and planted the green
plant he held in his hand in the pot, and then went
to the place lie was before in. It immediately be­
gan to grow, and although only a small branch
in the hand of the angel, sobn grew tip until it
nearly reached the cieling, in a spiral form ; on the
top of which shot forth a red flower of a large size,
or a great cluster of small ones, from one and the
same stalk. This vision continued upwards o f
two hours.
An explanation, given by the Spirit to Joanna,
in answer to the vision of Josehp, of the Crown
representing “ Thefulness of the Godhead bodily
and also of the vision of the seven Angels, and
the little Angel, green plant, Ufa. Sfc.
“ Weigh deep the vision now and see
What judgment can be form’d by thee.
But in thy heart thou answerest, none;
Just like the rest, to all ’tis kpown.
And so alike you all do sec ;
Then give the wisdom unto me,
This wondrous vision to explain.
You say the tomb therein is found,
As on the tomb the crown doth stand ;
And so HI give it out to man :
i'll place the bottom to my tomb,
And so Hi shew you all my doom*

And on the altar offer’d was;
And on the altar, all shall see,

For.in that form he oftencreeps,
I tell you plain, amongst my flock;
Therefore I told theemen know not
What they are doing, to condemn;
For Satan in disguise is come
To lead'my wandering fleck astray,
And so they perish in the way,
If that no Abrahams oould be found,
With faith like his, their sons to bind
Upon the altar of my word,

And so like Abraham is your trust,
And so like him your sons Til free;
And then the. horns, you all shall see,
Shall gain the Victory in the end.
Mark the two rams by thee were penn'd,
A type of Satan and of h * :

A mystery deep to roan Til clear,
What they could never understand.

How in and out it doth appear,
And so my Bible's placed here;
For in and out it must go on, .
Before the straight paths they can come ;
And then you'll see, a perfect line
From every crooked path/you’ll find.
For so my Bible now I'll clear:
’Tis perfect like the vision here,
And in and out it all went through ;
.As1none can prove my prophet’s true,
To bring it all in a straight line;
For like that vision, all will find,
My Bible’s in and out to. man,
I tell thee, crooked like tby chain,
That in one link cannot appear "
Te prove it straight—the truth I'll clear.
“ In crooked paths I came to men,;
My footsteps they did not discern,
Nov could they see my footsteps clear:
They judg’d Isaiah he must err,

The wondrous Counsellor to be ?

Did not appear in a straight line;

A man of sorrows to appear,

And so my death appear’d to all,
I tell you, crooked from the tomb;
The bye-paths were unknown to man:
Yet in that path did f a it h appear,
And all my disciples follow’d there,
To join the path close to the tomb,
Affirm the crooked paths were known,
That in stick path 1 must appear;
And they went on, like me before,
To let them know that no straight line
Could prove my Bible all divine.
“ It is in bye-paths you must see
The wondrous working all of me ;
And so in bye-paths they did come,
In crooked paths, unknown to man;
They made my death for to appear
A straight path, as you see it there:
Because the stem goes through the whole,
And so they plac’d the Gospel’s pole;
And so the Gospel doth appear

To every true believer here:
For they in crooked paths go on,
Until the ending near is come;
But they can point out no straight line
How that my kingdom you may fiod.
The outw a rd court doth all appear
In crooked paths, os heretofore;
Then sure the in w a rd court must corner
To make the Law and Gospel join,
How in one chain they do agree ;
And, from this vision, all shall see
How it is like the sons of men;

That I will answer all their prayers,
And they do wait to bear within;
The inner court they must be seen ;
And so the inner court they be.

The inner court is now without;
Because the Spirit they do doubt,
What to another may be given;

Because 1 bid them judge no man ;

As different as your members are;
Then sure the outward court is there;
That is, I mean the outward man:
They place my gospel by their plan;
And by their plan they all appear,
And so the outward court is here,
I tell you, in a crooked line.
From such professors can you find
A path thrift straight, wherein to go ?
And from within thou answerest, no:
Their paths are crooked all to thee;
And so Isay, they are to mb.
Then1they are but the outward man,
That from their judgment form their plan, „
Which in my gospel I forbid ;
For different gifts to man is said
That in the end there most appear,
To make my church one body here.
The gift of wisdom it must come,
And different spirits to discern,
And divers gifts f said would be,
And prophecies I said you'd see
Amongst the different gifts appear;
Then sure the inner court is here,
Which hangs together in this chain.
The inner gourt I'll now explain:
lik e my disciples it must appear,
And judge of mb as they judge there,
Such miracles could never come
From none but God's anointed Son ;
Because the power must come from heaven,
That unto mb that time was given.
And as I said I was his Son,
They saw the wonders I had done,
And so within they did appear,
To judge from faith the truth was clear;
From miracles that they did see,
They judg'd the truth aid come from MB ;
And so the standard did appear;
It was bv faith they walked there;
And so by faith they all went through,
And brought the Gospel to your view.

.And charity in them did come,
That as a God Fd not deceive
Those that by faith so right believ’d ;
A thing was never donh before;
Without a God it could not appear:
And though they saw a crooked line,
They judged my wisdom laid behind,
That all my words I would fulfil.
Faith was their anchor; wisdom still
Was fixed in them at the time;
They judged the miracles divine
Could never come from any hand,.
Without a God for to command
The wind and weather to obey;
They pondered all before them lay,
And then they judgfd the whole divine;
And now their offtpring bright shall shine
For ’tis by faith yon walk the same—

You've seen the truth how fast it came;
You've seen how all did hasten ou;
Then to my Bible you did come,
Like my disciples then of old;
You've seen the fruth, how all was told;
You see my Bible, how it doth stand,
And so, like them, you all command,
That there's on power but a God
Could in such wondrous manner lead,,
To have die mysteries so come round.
The wise and learned to confound :
Because the truth confound* them all,
If they reject the heavenly call,
They can't reject the truth is here,
Unless from Satan they appear
For to affirm it all a lie -
in Satan’s words they must deny,
And so in Satan's words appear
For to deny a prophet here.
“ So this is now the outward man ;
For to the truth they never came ;
Then how can they be plac'd within ?
And now to reason I'll begin :
The inward m in did so appear,
To look within, and see it clear ;
And then my Bible they did see,
These^promises were made by mb,
To bring it all in a straight fine,
And prove my Bible all divine,
15 .
That every *ord therein is true r
My Bible's open to their view,
And I am bringing round the chain,
As I have said, for to redeem
My sons and daughters from the fall,
That now in me you may live all.
Because the fulness now is come—
The G o dh ead bodily with m a n ,
It must in union now agree :
The inner court, if men do see
That Joel's prophecies are here;
The vision to the youth appear'd, *
The woman gave the prophecy,
And mark the manner how they lie,
That both together near did come,
And to each Other were unknown,
Until I brought the mystery round,
That both together should be found,
To prove my prophet Joel true.
And now my Spirit, all shall know,
I’ll pour upon the’
sons of men,
And Satan hath not long to reign;
Though he in power will now appear,
Because he knows his end is near—
And the Philistines he will shake ;
Like Sampson’s strength will Satan's break
1 tell you now, on every man,
That in their strength and wisdom stand.
So in their strength let men appear;
They'll find a Sampson's strength is near :
Because that Satan's strength will come,
And pull their fatal ruin on.
“ But here I see thy heart within ;
To ponder deep thou dost begin,
Because to Sampson it cannot be :
A type of hell, is judg'd by thee,
I cannot make the mystery clear;
For Sampson's foes destroyed were;
Then ’tis the devil's foes must fall,
And bring the ruin on them all.
And so I say the end will burst;
For Satan’s friends like foes are plac'd ;
Because they all despised thee, •
And said that Satan fills thee up;
Therefore they say that they do hate
The writings, for the devil's sake:
Because to him they all do place,
And so the devil they disgrace.

told you, that three spirits attend y ou ; which he

to the other youth, tells you all, that as ye say, ap­
paritions, or appearances of things, shew you some
death is near, either of yourselves, or of some

from the discernment of the spirit in the one, and
• from the visions shewn to the other, who prove thy
calling to be of God, and my kingdom to be nigh
at hand. For, as the angels warned the shepherds
of my birth; so have they now warned you in the
visions given to the youth. Yet, they err injudg­
ment, and stumble in visions; then to whom shall I
teach knowledge? Or whom shall 1 make to learn
instructions? For line hath been upon line, and
precept hath been upon precept; here a little, and
there a little; yet all havp gone backwards, and
made themselves crooked paths; and they shall fall
therein. For if 1 have condescended so much, to
visit this lower world, by prophecies, and by visions,
and have worked on my servants, whom I have
chosen, to be obedient to the heavenly calling, to
make it known and manifest unto all men—now,
if all these things are slighted; and vie refuse to
walk in the light, while ye have the light, dark
ness shall come uponyou, and pain as upon a woman
in labour. For judgment shall follow the line,
and righteousness shall be laid to the plummet: for
the line is straight before you all; and all men,
who have eyes to see, or ears to hear, or hearts to
understand, they must know and understand, that
it was by my order thou earnest hither; and it wa4

And Satan perish in the sound.
“ But as the hearts of men I know,
Thousands will say they wish it so,
But will not let their names appear;
To such I now do answer here,
Their names must come before the throne.

To warn you all that I am near:
From dreams and visions you see clear,
And from the spirit of prophecy—
The Law and Gospel do not lie:
But all together now they're come ;
From the eight hundred you discern
How the first date must now appear,
To make my Law and Gospel clear;
Because the seven you go through,
And then the first, before your view.
It is a day of rest for m an.
Then now I'll tell vou all my plan:
No respite man did give to me;
Remember, in Gethsemane,
With swords and staves they met me there,
And then my trial soon brought uear;
For then they nail'd mb to the tree—
No other week allowed for me,
That 1 a respite then could gain.
And now I'll tell you all the end:
As I that week did not go through,
I say, like man I now will do,
And cut the century short the same.
The &\gords and staves are found by man,
To meQt the tempter in the way ;

The every vision what it means :
The sword is drawn, 1 tell you plain ;
And thev that draw it'gainst my word,
They all shall perish in the flood,
I say, of sorrow and of sin*
For now to reason 1*11begin:
1 suffer’d for the fall of man.
As he his Maker did condemn;
But if the tempter now you free,
You all must perish now with b e ;
That is, your lives must end with grief*
1 ask you, who can give relief,
If you the murderer now will free ?
The woman’s guilt must fall on he;
That is the Devil I do mean;
And then the earth I shall redeem.
But you can point no other way,
That in my Bible I did say,
That e’er the earth 1 should redeem,
But by the promise made to them,
I now do ten you, in the fall:
For there the promise stands for all;
And there the enmity is plac’d.
I tell you all, ye fallen race.
Conscience condemns you every one^
Against the woman you are come;

And let such visions to appear,
I say, toy Bible for to clear.
“ But well your answers I do know—
These visions I did never shew;
That is the language of their heart:
Then now these words I will impart—
You must my Bible all deny,
If you dp say, unknown to mb,
That all these things would so appear;
And now, vain mortals, answer here,
Why I ne’er stopt the woman’s band ?
Not four men could I command.
To join together and appear,
For to prevent her coming here,
To make these visions out so plain,
When all had been despis’d by men ?
And so, by men, they’d still appear
To be despis’d, as heretofore,
Had not the woman hither come,
To shew the visions what they mean ;
And so both hands are strengthened here.
Unknown to me can nought appear;
Because your thoughts I do espy,
And tell you, my discerning eye
To every place doth go before;
And well I know what will appear;
And so all this is known to mb,
* Before my throne, you all may see
That every thing is placed there;
And as these visions do appear,
So all is broughr before the throne,
And every name to mb is known;
And every hand and heart the same.
And now, I say, from every name,
The books most all be brought to mb ;
And now my jewels, all shall see,
How from the books I’ll make them up,
And how the Tempter there shall drop.
M For I the judge shall now appear,
And man’s petition I will hear, .
When all is brought before my throne,
Like the hand-writing, it shall be known.
That Pilate wrote upon the cross;
Then sure your names cannot be lost.
When I the King of kings appear,
My soldiers must my kingdom share, .
That draw the sword and win the field;
For there the foe he now must yield,

When I the King do but appear,
And men’s petition I do hear,
And all is laid before my throne, .
And their petitions must be known
In their hand-writing to appear,
Or by their wish be.eaterd there;
And then I will sum up the whole*
And be the Pilate for you all.
To give consent, I say, like him;
And so the Tempter falls, like m b ,
1 tell you, by the power of men ;
By their desire I’velaid my plan;
Then sure the Tempter can’t complain,
If 1resign’d my life to men;
Then now to them he shall resign—
And so I’ve told you all my mind.
The swords are drawn, the staves appear;
’Tis time for Satan to take care;
And you may judge how near the end,
As from my death ’twas my intent
To shew you all how this most burst;
And mark, Gethsemane was first,
Before I came Jo Calvary;
And so my foe shall fall like mb ;
Because no respite I did gain;
For in one week the whole did end.
The seventh they’d not let me see—
They shorten’d then that week for m b ;
And so I’ll shorten now the whole ;
And you may judge how near's the fall,
If you can judge from what is past.
I said the swords and staves were first, .
And now I say they do appear;
Against the Tempter they are here;
Then surely all will hasten on;
Two out of seven, then ’twas known,
Were nearly shorten’d then for mb ;
And so the end of all you’U see;
For these two centuries, that are here,
With the two days I will compare.
“ So if you’ve wisdom to discern, .
You all may judge how I do warn,
And how the tumult must come on,
To make a final end for man;
Because for man I will appear;
And all shall find me Pilate here;
As he did give it up to man,
I tell you, now I’ll do the same.
So here this vision I shall end;
For deep are all the lines thou’st penn’e.”

F r i d a y , June 3d. 1803, about eight o’clock,
Joseph Prescott being engaged pounding allum,
with other workmen, who were preparing size for
paper, he saw the following vision ; the whole of
which was then in motion. He saw a Celestial
Being in human form, with rays of glory issuing
from his body, attended by a number of angels,
the faces only visible. They were clustering to­
gether, and advancing towards the Celestial Being.
Twoangels were placed close to the Celestial Being,
one on the right hand and the other on the left;
each of which had one hand to a book, which they
bald open right before the Celestial Being. Under­
neath those, lay another angel, in a reclined pos­
ture, with a long roll in his hand, opened, with
some reading apparently on it. They were sur­
rounded by a great number of angels. Under­
neath this scene, at a distance, was a very confused
appearance of the earth, on which he saw a num­
ber of tomb-stones; and out of the earth a great
number of persons were arising. Some were walk­
ing, who apparently had risen. They looked
like ghosts, as he had heard them described. There
were two descriptions of persons thus rising, and
they moved different ways—some,in a kind of light
mantle, were going towards a hill, which was light
and shining; made so from the rays of light, which
issued from the Celestial Being, passing under or
behind the clouds. Several of these persons in the
mantles had ascended the hill, and mixed with a
number who were gathered together in a body,
upon the hill so illumined, which was on the right
hand of the Celestial Being. The other descrip­
tion of persons looked like moving bodies formett
of clay, ascending from amongst the tombs. Some
had arisen and were.walking, others in the act of
rising: they gathered together on the left hand

of the Celestial Being. The place where they
were assembled was dark and gloomy. By their
side was a large body of fire, ascending from, or
bursting out of the earth; by which was a very
ugly figure, which Joseph supposed to be .the
Devil. Behind him was a pile or arrows, and in
his hand a bow with an arrow applied to it ; which
he seemed to stretch against the string with great
force,as if to shoot, pointing at the people in white.
At a very great distance was a number of rough
hills, with gloomy black clouds, from which is­
sued flashes of lightning in different places. Some
of the hills were on fire, apparently kindled by the
lightning; some on fire, iikother parts, where he
saw no lightning. Another infernal figure was
standing on a cloud, at a considerable distance
from the one which had the bow in his hand.
He was holding up a paper, with great earnestness,
to one of the angels on the left hand side of the
Celestial Being : which angel had his eye fixed on
him with great composure. On the other side stood
a wretched being in human form, in appearance
miserable, ragged, and dirty. He also was hold­
ing a paper in his hand, with much apparent
trouble in his countenance, to another angel on
the right hand side of the Celestial Being $ who
looked at him, as the other did, with composure.
The Celestial Being, whom Joseph supposed to be
the Lord, had his' hands and eyes uplifted, as if
going to declare something. Near to the infernal
figure on the cloud, was a person in human form,
with an angelic countenance, clothed in a garment
apparently of steel, having a chain with long links
in his hand, one end of which was fastened round
the body of the iufernal person. A voice then
uttered,
36
“ Behold yonder, in a heavenly croud,
“ With glory and splendor our God is ador'd.’*
, If desired to be drawn, it shall appear again.

F r i d a y , June 10th, 1803. About half past
four this afternoon, Joseph being engaged in part­
ing paper, after sizing, nad the following vision.
There were presented to his view fields and trees,
&c. in different parts. About the centre was a tent
or marquee, with fringe, or some kind of ornament
about it. The entrance of the tent was facing him;
on each side of which was an angel holding back the
curtain with one hand, and iu the other each had
a sword, composed of diamonds, with the point
touching the ground. Behind them, without the
tent, were two other angels with trumpets, which
they blew in loud and shrill sounds. Behind one of
those which had the trumpets, on the right hand
side, stood a person with a spear in his hand, which
beheld straight up. Within tne tent, which wasvery
dark, was a very brilliant crown, raised some dis­
tance from the ground. On all parts that surround­
ed the tent, the sun shone with uncommon splendor..
A voice said, “ If desired to be drawn, it shall ap- -
pear a g a in a n d further added, *• I the Lord will
be a light in a dark place.”
“ Now yon shall see the Son of God, ^
“ With millions of bis sons, blood bought.
July 5th, 1803.
A communication concerning the visions, given
to Joanna, in answer to her mends, who wished
her not to spend so much time in shewing the
visions, during her stay in Devonshire^ to such
numbers of people. She was answered by the Spi­
rit, in the following manner.
“ I ordered the visions to be drawn for thee,
to be made public, and shewn to all who wished
to see them; tor 1 now tell thee and all mankind,
the visions are the shadow of whatis hasteningon.
And now call to thy remembrance;, 1 said, when
37

the ten years were ended, that after I had shewn my
visitation to thee, in the world, greater mysteries
must appear to their view; and remember, I told
thee in 1792, I would shew thee in dreams, and
in visions, how it should come on. The first ten
years were passed in dreams: but now, when those
ten years were gone, that my visitation had ap>
peared to the world; from wars, from dearth, from
scarcity, and discord in the hearts of the people,
I began to shew thee, from visions appearing to
the youth, whom I visited in an early age, and
permitted Satan to work on the minds of men to
despise his visions, that all men might know he was
visited by God, and not set up by man : but when
my appointed time was come, that they had gone
through thy writings, the visions were madeknown.
But now I will make it plain to thee, and all man­
kind, there was no appearance in the world, that
I the Lord had visited thee, till the wars broke out
in 1793, and that it went on every year, to make
it appear to the world, more and more, till the ten
years were up. So, if men look deep, they will
see the truth of thy writings has appeared visibly
to the world, for ten years before the youth was
made known, whom I had visited, but had con­
cealed from thy knowledge; and at my appointed
time, revealed it to thee, and them ; and ordered
it to be made public, that thy visitation appeared
to the world in the beginning of 1793: and the
visions were made known, and published in the
beginning of 1805. Now weigh deeply the whole
together: then in seeing ye may see, aud in hear­
ing ye may understand, that .it is I the Lord who
have brought all these strange things to pass: and
remember the dream I shewed thee in 1793, that I
arose from a bed, as one awoke out of sleep; and
now he hath sent thee a vision of a bed with white
furniture, and the curtains drawn back; and then
knowest I told thee—

That did begin, and would go on,
Till every curtain was drawn back,
To know, and prove if I did speak;
And now' the ottflains do appear ;
And mark, this came in the tenth year,
Or else, I say, when it was up ;
The curtains, they are now drawn back*
And as this Vision dolh appear,
You all shall find your God is near:
The light in darkness it doth' shine—
I see the dark benighted minds:
For though the tmth is now so clear,
And perfect like this vision here,
That I shall pitch my tent with men,
And bring,my kingdom down to them,
And make my angels to appear,
To shew my kingdom it is near,
For all to come in robes of white—
I brought that vision to his sight,
To shew the end how it will fall,
When I appear to conquer all ;
That is to conquer hell, and sin,
As you may see it by the chain:
The man in armour first appear'd,
And Satan’s chain is fasten d there:
And so his power I shall chain down,
So perfect as the vision came;
For as the sight appear’d to he,
So perfect now the end shall be.
And mark that vision was seen first,
Where Satan's ruin so is plac'd ;
As bythe chain he can't get free,
And so he chained down shall be.
The graves are open'd of the just;
And so the end it now will burst;
Because the just will now appear,
To see my promises are clear, ^
That Satan must his doom receive.
Ere men with me in peace shall live,
And own my sentence to be ju st;
Aud for my kingdom they will thirst,
And they my kingdom shall obtain, ^
In heaven and earth with MB shall reign >
For in the end they’ll all unite,
And I will make them sons of light,
As in the vision doth appear;
The angel of the Lord b there.

My glorious kingdom will come in ;
The robes of white with blue are seen ;

Gross darkness in the sons of men;
And so gross darkness doth appear;
But all shall know my crown is near

And uow the wise may it command;
For back the curtain they will draw,

How it is fix'd in this dark place,
So perfect like the human race:

There's not a thing hath happen'd here,
But in my bible all is penn'd;

None but the eyeqffaith would see

To make a final end for mpp •

All those who for my Kingdom thirst.
And see my justice to appear,

Down to his den, as he is plac'd,
Because my side by him was pierc'd;
And 'twas by him I was betray'd—
I said, that Satan Judas led s

The dart is in the woman’hand,

As though oppress’d with grief and fear.
As Satan’s dart is fix’d behind;
The twisted serpent then you’ll find,.
How much like it her clothing’s plac’d ;
You cannot say ’tis like the r a t :
Indifferent robes she doth appear;
Because her clothing is drawn there
Much like a serpent for to be,
As in and out the stripes you see;

The dart in Satan’s hand is found,
How he in rage would keep her back
From every blessing 1 did create,
I tell you all, when at the first:

As the creation did appear,
When Eve from him receiv’d the spear:

To prove that death was pass’d on ua» :
As to perfection he was aead,

So man no knowledge hath of mb ;
Bring forth the age that right did see;
And then I’ll give it up to men,
If knowledge you can prove in them,
In any age that b o w is past.

That man no knowledge did obtain,
But when thespirit came from mb :
And now mv Spirit, all shall see,

And shew my crown how it must break
From the dark mysteries of the foil.
It is the woman (judge your call)
Must claim the promise there was made,
Who cast the guilt on Satan's head:
And now upon his head it shall foil:
For those three figures, I tell you all.
To saints and angels you may place. '
But now awake, ye fallen race :
The firit to Eve I shall compare—
Her combat with the Devil there:
As he the dart hath in his hand;

Is like a twisted serppnt round;
And so by him her fall was found:
But then with grief she did appear,
And unto Heaven did lift her prayers,
And great her sorrow it did burst;
But on the Serpent it was cast,
Whose subtle arts had her betray'd:
But mark, the promise there was made,
I tell you, of her seed to come.
As she the Serpent did condemn, '

With other guardians still behind,
To comfort her distressed mind.
Now, from the second, all shall see,
Jt was the h o th k r then of mb,
Who did so closely after come,
To have him chained by her Son,
The second Abel to appear,
To ’venge the blood so murder’d there,
'I say, by Satan’s artful hand$
And now the chain you may command,
To see it stamp’d beneath his foot:
You know I said I’d bind the root
Of every evil, that did spring—
I said I’d conquer hell and sin ;
And so to conquer I’li appear:
The second woman you see there,
With all her clothing drawn in red,
And so I’ll conquer by my blood.
Now mark the angel that’s behind ;
Then the new covenant you’ll find, .
That I am making now with man;
You see these three are join’d as one ?
Then sure my angel must appear,
I say, to join the women here ;
Ana now I tell you, from the last,
It is the woman that is first,
To place them all another w ay;
And from the angel, now I say,
Of the new covenant who appears,
To shew the fall how it was there,
That I have told you first was Eve;
And mark the promise I did give,
Which I did never yet fulfil.
The first is last, I tell you still:
Thou seest the angel ne is first;
What I call Eve, she is the last,
And so the last she doth appear.
And now the mysteries I’ll make clear: .
Because the last, you all shall see,
Is chang’d from Eve and come to thee.
For all her sorrows thou’st gone through :
Think of the past, the truth thou’lt know.
How Satan’s darts have wounded thee,
And, in thy prayers, thy griePs to mb.

Joanna dreamt she was in a place where there
were two furnaces. When dhe opened the cover o f
the second furnace there appeared a man seated in
the water therein; at which she was alarmed;
and the man said he was to sit there for a time, to
recover his health. At last the furnace was drawn
away by horses. Joanna was ordered to pen this
dream ; and she was answered, that simple as it
might appear, the meaning of it alluded to the
whole race of mankind.— •*The furnace is the fur*
nace of affliction, that ye are now put iq, until

The ANSWER of the SPIRIT to the foregoing.
“ Now I shall answer these passages of Scrip­
ture. The Lord will avenge them that cry unto
him. Now believers are crying unto M£ by their
petitions, and names, signed for Satan’s destruc­
tion. They are crying to be avenged of the inju­
ries that SaUn hath done them, by causing their
fall, and by bringing sin, sorrow, and misery into
the world, upon the whole race of mankind. Thns
they are daily coming unto m b , by their daily
signing for Satan’s destruction, and for the coming
of my kingdom. Bi}t nevertheless, is there Rim
on the earth ? Is there faith to believe that I shall
avenge you of your adversary the devil ? Is there
faith to believe I shall redeem you from the fall of
Adam, according to my promise made in Holy
Writ? Is there faith to believe I shall reconcile
the whole world unto God ? Is there faith to be­
lieve that the Bible is written by inspiration from
God, and that my words stand as firmas the pillars
of heaven, which cannot be shaken by man r Nei­
ther can my word be changed by the judgment of
man. Is there faith to believe there shall be a
new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth

do believe it all. I ariswer, those who thits hi
lieve, 1 shall avenge them of their adversary the
devil. Therefore the words stand 4o closely join­
ed together, that I will avenge them that ihut
believe:- fur this is the faith required to be be-*
lieved when 1 come in the spirit to redeem you
from the fall; or what redemption do you suppose
I told you would drawnear£ Or what kingdom
of God do you suppose I meant was at hand, that
should come as a snare upon all who dwelt upon
the earth ? Here is a mystery beyond the learned/
why it should come as a snare upon the earth.-
The true meaniug of a snare is a trap,- to ensnard
the minds of mankind, to draw them into a snare,
which proves to their hurt, when they are ensna­
red by any arts to fall therein; or the minds of
men may be a snare tinto themselves to draw them
into dangers: for a snare is a delusion, or being
deceived. Here thou art at a loss how this can
be made good, that a snare, explained in this
manner, can come upon the whole earth, i f one
part believeunto righteoutnees for their redemption;
To this I answer—Tliey who thus believe in their
redemption, are already judged to be drawn into
a snare for theirhurt. And they that do not believe
in their redemption, nor judge it is nigh at hand,
will be drawn into a snare by the arts-of the de­
vil, through unbelief. Therefore watch ye, that
ye may be counted worthy to escape all these
things that shall come upon the earth. Watch the
times; watch the seasons; watch the spirit whe­
ther it be true, or not; watch the scriptures;
weigh the whole together; draw the link, lengthen
the chain; see if one liuk will join with another;
compare the whole together; see if it adds link to
link, chain to chain, Tike the dawning morning,
higher and higher, brighter and brighter, to the per­
fect day: or like aflower in the bud, openingmfertf
and more until the full blown flower appears. In

this manner ye must weigh the works of God, like
the husbandman’s seed, first thrown into the earth
and buried down without any apearance of the
seed, till you see the blade appear; then cometh
the stalk, next the ear, then the blossom, then
the grain is fit for harvest. Just so you must mark
the rising of all things which come from God. So
it was with Moses in Egypt—with Joseph in the
Land of Pharaoh. Just so are my ways through*
put my Bible. Then so ye must watch, if ye will
escape all those things that shall come upon the
earth. And now I will tell thee why they will
copie upon the earth. Because of the hardness of
men’s hearts, through unbelief: for these are the
days of vengeance on men and devils. The spi*
gits that persecuted me, and my disciples, and my
prophets, will now persecute m e in the spirit, and
firing vengeance.on their own heads. But those
who watch the moving of the spirit, the truth of
the words, and believe that I died for theix re*
demption, will escape all these evils, and they will
not bring it on themselves: for they will be the
peqple that I shall redeem. For a new heaven, and
a new earth, mean that old things shall be done a*
way, and all things shall become new. For newit
will appear, to all men, when the church .militant
joins thechurch triumphant, when sorrow anri sin
are done away, and joy and gladness are in every
heart: it will be a new heaven to the saints, when
they have free liberty to come down and aoovene
with, saints below: it will be a new earth to man,
when sin. and sorrow, pain and misery, are all
done away; when joy and gladness are in every
heart, lovp and peace in every breast. Now ye
are,surrounded with enemies, spiritual and tem­
poral ; but.then ye will be surrounded with saints
and. angels, and. brotherly love in every heart
one towards another. This will be a new earth
to, man; and heaven will be new to. saints

angels, when ye have a free intercourse one with
another, without the infernal host that is now ho­
vering in the way. But when they are chained
down, it will be a new heaven to saints above, and
a new earth to saints below; and so they will praise
the name of the Lord from one new moon to anor
ther, from, one sabbath to another; and they shall
be my people, and 1 will be their God; for now
the whirlwind is gone out with fury, and it shall
fall with pain on the head of the wicked. The
root of wickedness is the Devil; and they that
are led by him will be pained with him But
when it comes to the end they will consider it
perfectly, that it is neither Jews nor Gentiles can
boast of wisdom or knowledge; for, if the natu­
ral branches fell through unbelief, let not them
which are grafted in boast, seeing they err in
■judgment and stumble in visions, as they (the
Jews) did. Ye turn the Scriptures, and wrest
them to your own condemnation, as they did : ye
wrest the Gospel of your Lord and Saviour, as
they wrested the words of the prophets; ye are as
full of unbelief of your redemption, as they were
of their salvation through my blood. But was
this to continue, how then shall the “ fulness of
the Gentiles come ?” The fulness of the Geutiies
is the redemption of man: for then ye come to '
the fulness of my merit—to the fulness of what I
died to purchase for you —the fulness of what I
created you for—the fulness of all happiness, when
your Deliverer shall come out of Sion, and turn
away ungodliness from Jacob. Your Deliverer is
the Lord of Hosts—the Mighty One of Israel is his
Name, who shall now perform the intent of his
heart in the redemption of mankind—according to
the intent of my heart, when I made man at
firstH-according to the intent of my mind, when
I said my delight shouldi be with the sons of men.
But where is the age that my *delight could

and put the martyrs to death? Trace back all
ages, and see when iny delight could be with men.
Could I delight to see their sufferings r Or could
my delight l>e with them that put them to death

shall tread down the wicked, as ashes under their

And now, I say, IT! prove the whole:
Like these two harvests all shall fall,
That do in mockery now appear.
1 ask how man canjudge me here,
If I have never spoke by thee;
I ask them how these things can be,
That all the truths have so come round ?
If from thyself theyjudge the sound;
Then from thyself must all appear.
The power to send these harvests here,
Or I must be as much to blame,
> To make themcome and mock my name,
If I had never spoke the word,
And so fulfill’d it as I said.
And now the whole I shall fulfil;
Judge ofthis calling as you will,
* You all shall find it came ftom heaven;
The Spirit from the Lord is given,
To tell you all that he is near,
■ And as a Bridegroom will appear;
But like a Bridegroom cannot be
Without a woman, all shall see;
And all as Brides I'll make the same.
When all like her believe my name.”

J oanna’s Answer to the False Reports con*
cerning the Sealing o f the People.
As some say I have one guinea for a seal, and
others say that I have five guineas for it, and the
ssm e report they have spread about my friends,
that they have taken money also; and several have
declared, that they wished to have signed for the
destruction of Satait, and for the coming of Christ's

glorious and peaceable kingdom to be established ;
out could not afford so much money ; I now an­
swer to all. I never took one penny for sealing
the people in my life; neither haveany of my friends.
Such au idea never entered my thoughts, h art,
or mind, or the thoughts, heart, or mind of any
who are joined with me. All I desire of any is to
shew their love and desire for Christ’s kingdom to
appear, and Satan’s power to be destroyed, by
putting their hands to what they say in their hearts
they wish for: but those who do not wish it, are
not to sign it ;fo r the Lord judgeth from the
heart ; and the hand and the heart must go to­
gether. Were I not assured it was the command
of the Lord, that all those who wished for Christ’s
kingdom to come, and the Powers of Darkness
to be destroyed, should join their hands with
their hearts, by signing their names, Iwould not
suffer it myself, for the world—to seal the people
in the name of the Lord\ as knowing it to be a sin
of the deepest die, if he had not commanded it.
But all wno sign for Christ’s kingdom to be es­
tablished, and Satan’s to be destroyed, shall be
sealed to the day of redemption, to inherit the
t r e e o f l i f e ; and this seal is given “ without
money,and without price." All that is desired is
men’s love to God, and a desire for his kingdom ;
and there most be a willing mind, and desire in
the heart, that God may be all in all, and the
powers of darkness utterly destroyed. Here I
have publicly made known to mankind what ma­
licious, false reports are made, to say that 1 re­
ceived money for my trouble ; which I positively
deny; and I can say the same of nfy friends. Now
1 shall give the answer of the Spirit, that is given
to me, in answer to men’s being stumbled that
this command should have been given to a woman;
and then judge for yourselves. 1 believe the Bi­
ble as it is revealed to m b by the Spirit ; but I
64

Cannot rely on the judgment of ahy man; as
the best of men differ so much in opinions mid
judgment. On whom then shall I rely? The
judgment of men contradicts one another;
therefore, I rely on the revelation given unto
me from the Spirit of the Lord : which you will
see in the following words, given to me in answer
to the controversies of men.
“ Let reason take possession of every heart:
then in seeing they must see, and in hearing
they must understand, that a plan fixed for
mao's redemption, in so clear a manner, would
no more have entered, tbv head and heart, than
it did in all the ages that nave passed before you,
from true prophets or false prophets, from my
disciples, or the vagabond Jews, or from all the
impostors that have arisen since, or from any
true prophet, or from any learned divine, who
have ever pointed out any way or manner that
man’s redemption should take place, till it was
plainly shewn to thee in what manner it m utt
take place, from the promise made in the fall
between the woman and the serpent; and from
every promise through the Bible, where it speaks
of man-s redemption, it is spoken to the woman.
In Isaiah, chap. liv. it is written, the Lord of
Hosts is her husband, and all her children shall
be taught of the Lord. In the Revelations,
chap. xix. v. 7. is mentioned the Lamb’s W ife;
where the Marriage of the Lamb is set forth as
uniting all nations together. In my Gospel she
is called bleated that never bore; and the king-
dom of heaven is compared to a woman having
a little leaven, till she leavens the whole. In
the Revelations, chap. xii. she is said to have -
the moon under her feet, treading down the
a

light that shineth ito darkness, and being clothed
■with the sun, which shineth bright to fine perfect
day. Naur, all these scriptures were never ap*
plied to a woman, Uor ever understood till now,
that they are established by a cloud of witnesses
of the true prophecies that have followed them.
Then now answer m e , O vain men, bow this
came to pass in the latter days, which never
bntered the heart or mind of any one before, and
applied by one who would not believe them, had
not the Spirit supported her faith and belief; by
telling-her1future events, which none but God
knew, and'none but God could fulfil? Me bath
given her knowledge above the learned: for no
man living could foretel the events that have
taken place, but she only. If you point out in
one thing that'she has stumbled/ it is f ■the h o td
that have ordained it, to convince mankind'shd
was faithful to pen what was revealed i unto
her, and leave the event unto time, 'to prove
the truth,1 If deceived she was as jealous f&t
herself as any man was for her: but had sbd
never been toiled the sincerity o f her heart
could never'be proved, that she wished not to
prophesy by any but the Lord alone. Now let
her enemies point out wherein she hath acted
with art or deceit, or wherein she hath lied
unto God or man. Hath she professed a belief
contrary to my Gospel, bearing a voice as you
hear "the rustling of the wind ? But hath she
not affirmed unto you all, she' knowetb not
from whence it comes, nor whither it goeth;
but judges of the Spirit by the truth that
followed), and the fruit which it bears? It
must be good ; as all tends to the glory o f
God, and tire good of mankind, to the pulling
down Of all the strong holds of sin; “ for
6§

every good and perfect gift cometh down from
the Father of lights.” Now, answer me, ye
men of the world, who despise her propheqies
and mock the coming of the Lord, from
whence came all your lies? Came they not
from your father, the devil, wbq was a liar
from the beginning? Is there a word in your
mouths, or a thought in you hearts, unknown
to ju£ ? By whose spirit is your malice kin-,
died? Will* you answer, by the Spirit of God ?
Then .speak, the truth every one by his neighf
boor: but the truth is not in her euequcs.
Therefore, out ,of your own mouths will I
condemn you, and will be a swift witness
against you, that your lies prove your malice
is kindled from hell, who is casting out floods
against the woman, — floods of malice, floods
of oaths, and floods of lies: making lies their
refuge; and under falsehood they are hiding
themselves; hut their refuge of lies shall be
done away, and their falsehood shall not
hide them in the day of my wrath, when I
come to' shew ray just displeasure against
mankind, for refusing to shew their love to
m e , by signing for the coming of their Lord,
to shew their wish for Satan’s kingdom to be
- destroyed, and for m i n e to be established
amongst them. But those who judge the seal­
ing is from the heart, and the heart only, let
them live to God, and God only, and flee from
every appearance of evil, and follow all the
commandments in my Gospel, and keep my
commandments,— ye shall not bear false wit­
ness agafnst your neighbour. But where is the
man upon earth who can say, all this have I
observed to do? I answer, not a man upon
earth can appeal to God and his own con-

the whole. Is it not written, judge no man
but by his fruit? For I said, by their fruits
ye shall know them. Let them that judge
thee, tell wliat fruits in thy writings they
cobdemu. But I know the thoughts of thy
heart Thou sayest they condemn thee for
saying thou art <f T h e B r i d e " mentioned in
the Revelations; then they must condemn he
for styling myself as coming as a Bridegroom,
if I do not come to make the churcn the
bride. To act like David, I must begin with
one and end with many: therefore I said unto
thee in years past,
N o more in thee they all will see
Than in thy friends abound;
And all that are thy helpers here
Will in the end do crown'd,
In glory bright, in robes of white,
For baidbs IT1 make you all:
One star can never give tne light,
If all the rest should fail.
So as to pride, throw*all aside;
'Tis time for all to shine;
Nor can you say if she's “ T he Br id e ,”
She’s higher than mankind.
'Tis but a mark *tis growing dark;
She's not above the rest:
Observe the glittering of the stars,
And see how all is plac’d*
What stars in glory will appear,
In splendor bright to shine,
Before that midnight doth come near;
And so the end ypi|’Ufind,
That stars of light will sparkle bright,
Ere midbight doth come on;
And they will give a heavenly light;
For so my b r i d e s will come.
Then b r i b e s to all alike I call,
(For every star is mine)
Topoint the Brid r<

That you his words afry find.

And be in every heart;
For your redemption now draws near:
Satan must foel his dart.
As you do pray, I now do say,
I shall deliver all,
And bring my kingdom down this w ay;
The sealed so will fall.
For your redemption you are seal’d.
It right you now believe
(A mystery never was reveal’d)
That from the fall of Eve
The promise there doth strong appear,
If you discern the first;
T h e Revelations shew you clear
The promise at the last.
The spirit and the brids say, come,
And do you all invite;
I do not mean to cast out one—
The love of none I’ll slight,
Who wish my kingdom for to come, .
And Satan for to fall;
And every name that’s enter’d here,
'. I now ao tell you all,
In heaven they’ll be inroll’d by mb,
Where hand and heart dojoin, ,
To wish from Satan to be free;
So now I’ve told<ny mind.
And now in print let this appear,
Beginning from the first,
And shew the lies that now are told,
Which from thy foes do burst;
For, like a man, I now am come
To take thy every part;
I know how Satan leads men on,
To bring on them the dart,
To have my vengeance fall on man,
Thinking himself to free; ’
But for the sake of fifty men
I’ll bring the guilt on him.
Though 1 have more, it will appear,
Whose hands and hearts dojoin
And Satan shall not triumph here,
His number's more than mine.
When I appear to chain him here,
And shew his final doom,
The woman’s hand must then appear—
He perish’d in her room. .

And now the end you see ; '
’Tis for the woman, in the but,
He chained down mast he.
She pluck'd the fruit, and gave to man.
And he did eat the san e:
Tb*t way, yea say, the evil came,
And man knows not my name.
So now at last the good is burst,
And so she pluck'd it here,
And offer’d it for man to taste, '
That he with her might share,
I say, the knowledge of the Lord,
And me they aMshall know.
“ So let these words to flyabroad#
And see what man will do.
If they go on as man began,
I tell you, at the first;
It is of Adam I do mean;
Then the good fruit shall burst
Upon you au (for so’s the call)
Then take it from her hand,
And shew you wish for Satan’s fall, -
My kingdom to command.
No other way, to you I say,
I ever shall redeem;
It is the changing of the tide,
' That always brings the stream.
For when the tide keeps back the waves,
They cannot hasty flow; .
But soon they overflow the banks
When I the tide let go.
So ’tis the same, the woman’s hand, -
You say, kept back the tide,
That man in all true happiness
He did not long abide ;
But now you see a mystery,
How I the tide let go,
To overflow your every hank
And living waters flow.
They now will run like Jordan’s streams,
And all your lepers cure;
N o other way, to you I say,
Will heal your lepers here.
All other waters are in vam-^-

The woman’s hand shall^ver stand,
For to bring back the fall*

Will seek his overthrow;
When I begin to smite the tide,
And all the waves let go.
Upon the Serpent it shall foil,
To drown aim in the deep;
But 1 will be a wall to a ll.
That now this law do keep—
The law of reason and love;
The reasonings here are just;
For I shall soon know every name
That is upon the list;
But now this catling is the last ;
For I shall call no more;
But let these words be put in print,
That all may now see clear.
The woman brought mb to the cross,
As ’twas suppos’d by man ;
The Serpent so must lick the dust,
And all come from her hand.”
