         Experience  description:   &nbsp;&nbsp;     </b>

I just met my soulmate, finally, at age 64. He is 66. We recognized each 
  other as soulmates the first day we met but proceeded cautiously. I was 
  married twice and am now divorced. He has been married to the same person for 40 years. I now realize why my marriages didn't work. I can now see the walls I had up around my heart and soul. I never let anyone in completely before. Now, all the walls are gone. The first time we made love I thought, in amazement, &quot;There are no barriers between us!&quot; He rolled over and said, in amazement, &quot;There are no barriers between us, no walls!&quot; We felt the   universe suddenly open up to us as if someone pulled a string and the curtain went up. It is a spiritual awakening for both of us.
  
  We have a total of seven major conjunctions -- moons conjunct in Libra, 
  Uranus/Uranus in Taurus, Neptune/Neptune in Virgo, Pluto/Pluto in my first 
  house on my Sun and Venus, and my Mars conjunct his Sun.
