I do not remember the event. My injuries were severe with traumatic brain injury,  broken ribs,  back, and pelvis injuries. She was wearing a helmet and I was not.  

  				    What I remember was that I was looking at a glowing figure. At first, I thought it was me. I remembering thinking, 'How is my wife?  If she passes, there is no need for me to stay.' I heard, 'Honey, she is going to be alright let them take care of you'. Since I was reassured that she was going to be ok, I was happy.  I believe the voice  was my wife's mother  who spoke to me. 

  				    It was the first thing I share with my wife when I became conscious four weeks laters. Her mother spoke to me and I knew she was going to be ok.  It has been fifteen years and  I can still clearly see the glowing being. I sometimes question how true this was this experience. Even with all the questions, I still think it did happen.
