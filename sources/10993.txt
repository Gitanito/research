  		              		Experience Description   

      I always get really bad chest infections from the flu. In the early hours of the night, during winter 2015, I woke up on my back paralyzed.  l was choking on mucus, felt a lot of pain in my chest, and I couldn't breathe or move to help myself. I felt my heart stop and I was scared. 

  I sat up, and then stood up, but I was outside of my body which was lying on the bed. I flew towards a light  in the corner of my bedroom. Then, l was at a beach we visited from my childhood that was near where my older half-sister once lived. It was nighttime and l was floating across the water towards a crowd of people on a hill. My deceased Dad was with me. I felt  the love coming from the crowd of people, which was something I'd never felt before. 
  
  I was so happy to see my Dad because  I missed him so much.  I threw my arms around  to hug him.  I sensed that he was upset so   I looked up into his  face. He said telepathically, 'Your daughter needs you!' It was then that I realized I was dead. I panicked and said, 'Dad I love you but I love my daughter more.' A huge smile spread across his face.   

  Then I was back in my body; paralyzed and suffocating.  I managed to move my right arm and wake my partner by hitting him. He saw me choking and threw me forward. He pounded on  my back hard until I started breathing again.   

  I never sleep on my back now because this experience scared me because  I don't want to die and leave my daughter alone.  Before, I never believed in life after death.  But now, I 100% believe in the afterlife. Since this experience I see some dead people.  I see my Dad all the time; he sits on the end of my bed and rubs my ankle daily. He  lets me know he is here looking after me and my daughter. 
    
    Recently, my eldest step sister died and l saw her spirit. I have occasionally predicted things about others. It's usually their dead relative whispering in my ear.  But I don't like it so I asked my Dad to stop them from contacting me.  Strangely, I also see dead snakes; I do not understand this or why I see them but I have always had a phobia about snakes.  I have since been diagnosed schizophrenic. But my psychologist believes my NDE is real, as his mother-in-law also had one while having an operation. They think the snakes and the shadow people are hallucinations. Who knows one day hopefully science will find out the truth?
