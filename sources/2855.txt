T he Foundation Fellowship
the
of

May,
of
1928,
the
in
tadena, California,
founder
tion
of the
29th
Al-
the
Founda-
Fellowship under­
went the strangest of all
esoteric experiences. He went through
a sequence, while his body was prone
in sleep, that convinced him there could
be no such thing as Death—at least to
the personal consciousness.
Without inviting the experience in any
way, without having the faintest inkling
that it was to happen, he somehow de­
tached his Conscious Self from his
1
4 -
physical organism and penetrated into
a higher-life octave. 4
When this extraordinary visitation was
over, his consciousness seemed to re­
turn to its former occupancy and he re­
sumed the tenor of his life as before.
But this thing had happened to him—
Some subtle but astounding change had
taken place within him during that Dis-
carnate Excursion.
He found that he was possessed of
abilities— mental and spiritual—which
he had been unaware of, before the
night in question brought its mystical
Awakening.
He found that he had somehow un­
leashed strange telepathic powers within
himself, enabling him to tap into a sub­
liminal lore that truly has been the well-
spring for the spiritual revelations of
the sages of all history.
V /’OU can read the minutest detail of
JL A.
Mr. Pelley’s Discarnate Excursion
in the article that was later published in
The American Magazine for March,
1929, under the title “ My Seven
Minutes in Eternity." The editor of
this great national magazine, knowing
Mr. Pelley intimately at the time, be­
came convinced that Mr. Pelley’s ex-
perience had been all which he re­
counted.
Mr. Pelley was not a Spiritualist, had no
knowledge of Rosicrucianism or Mysti­
cism generally, and was as dumb­
founded to have the sequence happen
to him as his friends were stupefied to
read of the adventure when later it was
published in a national periodical.
It was one of those things that was to
change the author's life.
As Mr. Pelley said afterward: “ 1 have
proved to my own satisfaction at least,
that there can be no such thing as death
to the personal consciousness, because
I have known what it is to think and act
apart from my physical body and brain.
To all intents and purposes, 1 might
have gone along thinking and acting as
a discarnate entity in the condition in
which I found myself and not returned
to my body at ail. Undoubtedly my
friends would have come upon my
physical self, declared it lifeless, and
buried it—after the proper funeral, I
hope. It would not have affected my
conscious performance in the octave in
which 1found myself.'*
At any rate, the supernatural nature of
the experience was not to be denied.
And neither were the uncanny gifts of
Clairaudience which he immediately
began to exercise, to his friends’ con-
8ternation.
They were much the same gifts as the
great mystic, Swedenborg, manifested
to his intimates in 1745. Like Sweden­
borg, too, Mr. Pelley felt a strange re­
sponsibility for acquainting blundering,
puzzled, terrified humankind whose
spiritual senses had not been opened,
with what his subliminal discoveries
and researches were unquestionably
demonstrating.
Blundering, puzzled, and terrified hu­
mankind needed this information in the
present fraught period in the world 3
affairs.
It needed to know intimately some of
these stupendous processes accounting
for so-called Life and Death, and pre­
cisely why each mortal life contained
the experiences which it did.
COURSE, having told such an un-
canny story in the pages of a reput­
able magazine like The American and
writing as an author of established
prestige and reputation—the public re­
action was terrific.
Mr. Pelley began to receive a mail from
the two million readers of The Amer­
ican not unlike the deluge of postal
matter reaching Charles A. Lindbergh
4
on his return from his epochal flight to
Paris. People wanted to know more
about the experience, more about the
clairaudient gifts which were confound­
ing Mr. Pelley’s intimates in proven
demonstrations.
As he continued to turn out one paper
after another on the profoundest as­
pects of Mysticism—material which he
could by no means have acquiied from
other ibooks because it wasn't to be
found in other books—and news of the
nature of tthese pajpoftrs began to get
about, he decided to share such instruc­
tion with friends and corespondents.
He started publishing a small monthly
magazine in New York City in 1930,
called “The New Liberator/'
Almost overnight, this unique periodi­
cal—filled entirely with his further
elucidations of his own psychical re­
searches and experiences—gained to
national circulation.
But that wasn’t enough.
Teachers of metaphysics wanted to
make his writings the basis for a new
departure in Mysticism and spiritual
awakening. And rather than have any
commercialized cult spring up as a re­
sult of what he had done so unwittingly.
Mr. Pelley himself undertook to cor­
rectly interpret his findings through a

But that wasn't enough.
Teachers of metaphysics wanted to

awakening. And rather than have any
commercialized cult spring up as a re­
sult of what he had done so unwittingly.
Mr. Pelley himself undertook to cor­
rectly interpret his findings through a
5
series of study classes, which presently
composed what he called The League
for Liberation.
CDR a time these study classes spread
* like a prairie fire. At one time in
1931 there were 476 of them meeting
on Sunday afternoons from Boston to
San Diego. Once each week, Mr.
Pelley personally prepared Clairaudient
Script and discourse to be read to them.
After the Reader had expounded and
discussed them, students bought copies
of them to take home and ponder.
It has been estimated that something
like 20,000 people had their lives and
philosophies totally remade—even as
Mr. Pelley’s life and philosophy had
been remade—as a result of studying
the Scripts of the League for Liberation.
What was the result?
C
]JThose people today, with this miasma
of distress and terror spreading over
the land, are the persons who are view­
ing what is happening calmly and dis­
passionately, knowing with a quiet
positiveness exactly what is afoot and
what is ultimately to come of it.
They have, in short, a spiritual anchor­
age in these times of economic and po­
litical storm that is giving them poise,
serenity, and an uncanny prosperity as
6
the affairs of lesser enlightened people
seem to go from bad to worse.
York, Mr, Peiley declared that he meant
to issue only 52 of the Scripts. He as­
sumed that after one solid year of meet­
ings had been held, the teaching would
be sufficiently distributed so that inter­
ested persons would not require more.
As a matter of fact, he published and
distributed .67 of the Scripts. He went
fifteen weeks over into the second year
with the Sacred Revelations.
By May of 1932, it became apparent
that he should handpick a hundred
capable people, temperamentally in­
clined toward the Great Doctrine that
was slowly but irrefutably taking form,
bring them together, and for a limited
time instruct them personally—so that
they might go forth and properly in­
terpret the Intelligence to the nation.
So his next step was to go down into
North Carolina and open a nine-week
summer school at Asheville.
He called this assemblage Galahad Col­
lege.
As matters turned out, Galahad College
was one of the most successful projects
of its kind ever attempted. But the
%
7
difficulty which developed was, that
hundreds— yes, thousands— of people
who would have desired to attend and
receive the Subliminal Instruction that
was therein available, were haplessly
unable to do so for economic reasons.
C
fl Even had they possessed the financial
means to make the trip and underwrite
the sojourn, the natures of their pri­
vate affairs would not permit it in the
item of Time.
To shorten this narrative, what Mr.
Pelley did was to form a Fellowship,
made up of persons residing all over
the United States, who received the
material originally disseminated at
Galahad, by maill
And since September of 1932, such in­
struction has been going forward.
The school, as a school, was closed. But
a correspondence-school publishing
house was permanently established in
Asheville, and barring one or two
temporary interruptions, has been func­
tioning ever since.
*
IT W AS none other than Mr. Pelley*s
A mystical gifts, put to practical exer­
cise, that caused him for a time to
minimize the activity of the Fellowship
in favor of a nation-wide expose of the
8
\
ulterior forces striving viciously to de­
stroy our form of government.
For challenging these powers of over­
seas sabotage, a concentrated attempt
was made in 1934 to suppress him and
the institution that was unmistakably
growing from the publishing of the
Seven-Minutes article. The enemies of
constitutional America “moved heaven
and earth” to bring up commercial
technicalities that should railroad him
to the penitentiary and thus stop his
teaching through a silencing of his pen.
•J The battle was bitter, but it all came
to naught!
The Foundation Fellowship has gone
straight ahead, supplying lectures and
scripts to thousands of people over the
six-year period that has intervened since
its inception as Galahad College, and
while the economic side of Mr. Pelley’s
interpretations has expanded, his eso­
teric writings and promotions are still
the fundamental activity of his strange
career.
Now, in the closing half of the year
1938, another remarkable thing is oc-
✓
curring.
An entirely new flood of Esoteric Ex­
positions has started to “come over”
and is being recorded, augmenting— or
going further beyond—-the original
Sixty-Seven Scripts of the Liberation
League.
How long they will continue, remains
to be seen. But Mr. Pclley again feels
the obligation to get them out in pub­
lished form and into the hands of under­
standing and spiritually-hungry people.
<| And while he is about it, and with a
fully-equipped printing-house at his
command, Mr. Pelley now proposes not
only to print these new scripts in en­
during format and see that they are dis­
tributed, but to go back over the list of
the Sixty-Seven Liberation Scripts, and
the Forty-Eight Blue Lectures of the
Galahad College course, and bring these
both out consistently as treasures of
printed beauty. He believes that the
quality of material in them commands
the best printed vehicle that modern art
can devise.
So an entirely new treat is in store for
the thousands of people who had their
lives and philosophies remade by ab­
sorbing these messages up to the
present.
The Foundation Fellowship is picking
up the educational work of the League
for Liberation, and carrying it forward
to still more effective heights.
A new galvanism is being put behind
the Fellowship.
10
Whereas it formerly served a handful
of special students, now the intelligence
shall be broadcast in this new form to
serve the spiritual-distraught masses of
the whole American nation!
J70R the benefit of those into whose
* hands this announcement may fall
and who want something in the way of
spiritual doctrine that they can “ sink
their teeth in,” something that shall
serve them practicably and profitably
during these times of vast economic and
racial stress— it should be stated that the
Intelligence to be acquired from par­
ticipating in the study courses of the
Fellowship, falls into two parts: Spir­
itual and Sociological.
The spiritual part of the work consists
of a sweeping revelation of the facts
concerning mortal birth, life, and death,
why each one of us is here at this par­
ticular time going through the experi­
ences that we are, and what the experi­
ences and unfoldments of each soul are,
when making its final excursion into
Consciousness’ higher octaves.
None of it negates the fundamental
principles of the Christian religion. It
merely renovates them, gives them a
higher and finer interpretation, and
so it is beginning to be believed re-
1
1
stores to modern society the more ac­
curate tenets of the Message which the
Christ preached in Galilee and for
which He was crucified.
Most Christians, no matter how ortho­
dox, are vaguely aware that the Chris­
tian religion was badly subverted and
prostituted in the generations imme­
diately following the Ascension. The
suspicion is strong among Biblical stu­
dents that the Christ Message has
reached us today only in fragmentary
form.
The Scripts of the Liberation bring
material before the student that is un­
canny in its implication that the full
Christ Message has not been entirely
lost to the generations, but may still be
learned of, in its original astounding
beauty and significance.
The second part of the Fellowship lore
has to do with the secret and rarely-
known History of the Earth, and what
the Great Plan is, which divine Provi­
dence seems to be working out among
nations and races in the present Dis­
pensation.
Mr. Pelley gave forty-eight lectures in
Galahad Summer School, in which he
traced this inside and unsuspected His­
tory of the World and what the se­
quences of society have been, from the
12
projection of the planet as an arena for
mortal performance, up through the
antediluvian and A tlantean world to
the Christian dispensation of the
present. He presented an entirely new
theory of organized social life, and peo­
ple who have become fully versed in it
are no longer puzzled or distraught by
the phases of economic unfoldment
that are taking place before their eyes
in the present.
This Secret History of the World went
particularly into the causes for, and
significances of, the Great Pyramid and
their tie-ups with the present. It pre­
sented the evolution of mankind from
the strictly cosmic standpoint.
Nothing like it has ever before been at­
tempted in Sociology or Mysticism.
These lectures, when printed and dis­
tributed, created a sensation as out­
standing as the publishing of

among a more circumscribed audience.
TF YOU want to have YOUR life and
thinking established upon a more ra­
tional, enduring, and spiritually-satis­
fying basis, and gain for your own soul-
enhancement all the profits that have
been steadily and consistently accruing
the past decade to other Fellow-

1

more
ship students, why not send a paper dol­
lar in to the Fellowship for the first Four
of the Scripts— two of the Liberation
Scripts, two of the Galahad Scripts?
When you have thoroughly digested
them, send in another dollar for four
and keep up the sending so long
as either Liberation or Galahad Scripts
are issued.
That’s all the expense or obligation in­
volved in obtaining this fund of colos­
sal lore for your own special use!
You don’t have to sign up for any long
and tedious course that takes time and
money that you can’t afford—times
being what they are.
You simply order yourself Four Scripts
at a time and absorb them privately
and amply as you have time and
means.
Along with your First Four Scripts
comes a beautiful deluxe reprint of Mr.
Pelley’s epochal article “ My Seven
Minutes in Eternity”— sent to you
gratis with the author’s compliments
so that you can acquaint yourself with
precisely the experience that brought
this great course of Cosmic Study into
existence.
D E R H A P S you are not spiritually
**■ ready to receive this Intelligence.
1

If so, you will feel no inner urge to
send for this material. Certainly this
announcement of new Liberation
Scripts to be forthcoming is no attempt
to high-pressure you into buying any
Course, or signing up for any curricu­
lum of whose benefits you cannot ad­
judge until after its completion.
You simply acquire the material as you
are interested, or as it makes you grow
spiritually. If you plead that you have
other things more pressing, both as to
time and finances, at the present mo­
ment, then again it is proof that you
may not have evolved far enough to
make these revelations ,of permanent
value to you.
There IS something hauntingly imper­
ative about them, however, for the
right people— or rather, the people for
whom they are intended, in these pecu­
liar years of cosmic disturbance.
It is sufficient for the discharge of spir­
itual responsibility on the part of those
circulating them, that this particular
leaflet has brought the existence of
them to your attention.
As for older students who already
know the worth of the matter in the
Fellowship Course, the announcement
that a whole new series of Pink Scripts
will presently start delivery will be
*

greeted with the acclaim of attested
experience
Simply send $1 for the First Four of
the reprinted series m their newly
edited and augmented form, to
TH E FOUNDATION FELLOW SHIP
t
Box 2630 Asheville, N. C.
It is well worthwhile to call to your atten­
tion that definite help and satisfaction should
be apparent to you with the reading of each
Script, as you, will discover. This is not a
case of being lead on through endless read­
ing before finding significant usable eluci­
dation. ^
