I have known some very bad people in my life. Mafia people. If I told you what I know, you would wet your pants. At one time, I was offered a job as an enforcer by some very high-ups in the Mafia. I turned them down. I've always been a tough person and have had the ability to be mean when it's been needed.

Five days a week, I would go to the gym to lift weights, but this one day, I felt a pain in my chest. I called for help and went downstairs to wait for the fire department to come pick me up and take me to the hospital. I woke up just as I was being cut open. There was blood everywhere and people were screaming at each other. I felt blood spraying my face and tasted the blood on my lips. I heard the saw cut through the ribs in my chest. I felt it all. I was strapped down and not able to move. I felt it all, and I heard everything that was said in the operating room. I knew I was going to die due to the amount of blood there was and how damaged my body seemed to be. My nurse was in a screaming match with her co-workers as well as the nuns, who were holding hands and praying for me. I also saw my wife, who was crying, along with two of our sons. My sons were both were mad about something. I didn't know what they were so mad at, but I could do nothing about it, I was strapped down. I felt my soul leave my body and then I started walking around in the hospital. I saw some hospital staff and listened to them talk about me. They could not see me. They were saying that they didn't think I was going to make it off the operating table alive.

Then I found myself walking on a very smooth path that was about twenty feet wide, following the sound of music and angels singing. It was beautiful! I went through very large gates that were made of iron and gold, with small golden figures attached to them. I saw a wall that was made of cut stone. It was very smooth to the touch. I heard a man speaking to me, saying ‘Tommy, come here!’ and it was my grandfather Tom leaning against the wall. He said, ‘Tommy, don't go down there!’ He pointed to the right and I saw a long, wide walkway that sloped in a downward direction. On that walkway, there were hundreds of poor people being dragged along by small men who were attacking them, biting them and beating them as they went. The smell was the worst thing that I have ever smelled. The smell of burning flesh. When I was a child I had smelled that same smell coming from a car crash site that was on fire, but this was far worse than that. As I walked away, I looked back and saw another long walkway from which I could still hear beautiful singing, more beautiful than anything I had ever heard before. However, I walked back out through the gates, turned to the right and proceeded down a long road that was made of cut stone, but very soft to walk on. Next, I found myself back on the operating table covered in blood.

  Experience Description 6658  					</p>  					I woke up after I went down at the gym to the sound of screaming of the hospital staff and watched a saw cutting my ribs apart. I felt it all and heard it too. I felt myself drifting away as if I was riding on air. I felt and overheard everything that was said for hours in the operating room. I found myself walking down a roadway of smooth cut stones. I came to a gate that was made of gold. It was open, so I walked in to see my Grandfather Tom leaning on a wall. He called me over and smelled of gasoline. He was wearing a work shirt from his gas station. He told me, ‘Tommy don't go down there!’ I looked and saw the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. There were many people being bitten and beaten by demons with large teeth. The screams were so bad that I can still hear them today. I turned back to my right and walked back through the gates and walked on down this long road made of smooth stones. I listened to beautiful music but kept walking away. I awoke to see my wife crying and the nuns praying and crying also. This was like a horror movie playing out and I was the star of the show. I can't shake this and can't really relate to anyone about this. No one understands this or can explain it. I could talk about this for hours. It upsets me that people kind of think I'm crazy. Well, I'm not crazy. Heaven and Hell are real places, and you don't want to go to hell. I will talk to anyone about this, but no one wants to hear it.

  Experience Description 6626  					</p>  					I was raised in church and I know I have failed God a lot of my life, but I always did want to serve God. I have known some very bad people in my life. Mafia people. If I told you what I know, you would wet your pants. At one time, I was offered a job as an enforcer by some very high-ups in the Mafia. I turned them down. I've always been a tough person and have had the ability to be mean when it's been needed.

Five days a week, I would go to the gym to lift weights, but this one day, I felt a pain in my chest. I called for help and went downstairs to wait for the fire department to come pick me up and take me to the hospital. I woke up just as I was being cut open. There was blood everywhere and people were screaming at each other. I felt blood spraying my face and tasted the blood on my lips. I heard the saw cut through the ribs in my chest. I felt it all. I was strapped down and not able to move. I felt it all, and I heard everything that was said in the operating room. I knew I was going to die due to the amount of blood there was and how damaged my body seemed to be. My nurse was in a screaming match with her co-workers as well as the nuns, who were holding hands and praying for me. I also saw my wife, who was crying, along with two of our sons. My sons were both were mad about something. I didn't know what they were so mad at, but I could do nothing about it, I was strapped down. I felt my soul leave my body and then I started walking around in the hospital. I saw some hospital staff and listened to them talk about me. They could not see me. They were saying that they didn't think I was going to make it off the operating table alive.

Then I found myself walking on a very smooth path that was about twenty feet wide, following the sound of music and angels singing. It was beautiful! I went through very large gates that were made of iron and gold, with small golden figures attached to them. I saw a wall that was made of cut stone. It was very smooth to the touch. I heard a man speaking to me, saying ‘Tommy, come here!’ and it was my grandfather Tom leaning against the wall. He said, ‘Tommy, don't go down there!’ He pointed to the right and I saw a long, wide walkway that sloped in a downward direction. On that walkway, there were hundreds of poor people being dragged along by small men who were attacking them, biting them and beating them as they went. The smell was the worst thing that I have ever smelled. The smell of burning flesh. When I was a child I had smelled that same smell coming from a car crash site that was on fire, but this was far worse than that. As I walked away, I looked back and saw another long walkway from which I could still hear beautiful singing, more beautiful than anything I had ever heard before. However, I walked back out through the gates, turned to the right and proceeded down a long road that was made of cut stone, but very soft to walk on. Next, I found myself back on the operating table covered in blood.
