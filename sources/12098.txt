  		              		Experience Description   

    My mom passed away three and a half years prior to when I had this experience. 

  I was in a dark area where my mom, myself, and a few other people I didn't know were basked in a blue-white glow. I want to say we were standing around a stone table. My mom was holding my hand and I kept wanting to leave. But she  kept telling me that I had to stay for a little while longer because I needed  time to get better. My mother was so beautiful and looked to be about my age, although she was 53 when she passed away. She  told me that I had a beautiful baby daughter and that I had to go back because my daughter  needed me. My mother  eventually let me go back and I woke up. 

  When I woke up, it took me a little while to stay awake. Then I  tried to talk, but couldn't because I was intubated. I asked for a pen and paper. I asked what day it was and what time. My dad said it was the next evening. He asked why I asked.  I wrote because it seemed like a lot of time had passed. I felt a great sense of gratitude that I was alive.
