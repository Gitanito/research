you
I work principally as a
most of my clients are in the defense
industry occasionally work directly for
the military but most the time I work
for civilian corporations that are
defense contractors they build weapon
systems and things for the military work
for all the major defense contractors
that work for General Dynamics Lockheed
Northrop McDonnell Douglas Boeing
Rockwell International Honeywell allied
signal Corporation and and it was a very
enjoyable very lucrative business and
just before I went into college in 67
when I was at Westover Air Force Base
had this Gilbert Science company 80
power reflector telescope and everything
and one night before I was going to go
to bed took the dog out you know to go
to the bathroom and stuff and it was in
March of February of 67 and I saw this
light moving across the sky and then it
just kind of stopped and there wasn&#39;t
any noise so I took the dog back in the
house and brought on my telescope and I
watched this thing through the telescope
for about ten minutes and then it in
fact it was hovering directly over the
facility where they kept the nuclear
weapons the storage facility near the
alert hangars at Westover Air Force Base
and it started to move off and it it
moved off slowly and kind of wandered
around the sky and then all of a sudden
just was gone like had been fired out of
a gun it was just out of sight in just a
second or two it all started to come
together when I was working at inter
vision and John Eppolito talked about
this interview that he&#39;d done with a
person who had for some reason had wound
up walking up to or near a hangar at a
section of a military and Air Force Base
and it&#39;s seen a flying saucer in the
hangar and then he was arrested and
hauled off and blindfolded in debriefs
and all the sort
thing this fellow mark Stambaugh
apparently according to roger turner had
developed a experiment that created kind
of levitation in some circles has been
called electrogravitic levitation or
anti-gravity and what he did was he
apparently acquired a high-voltage power
source a DC direct current power source
and he took a couple of quarter-inch
thick copper plates about a foot in
diameter with the lead coming out of the
middle of each one at the top and the
bottom and he basically embedded them in
a type of plastic resin like you know
polycarbonate or Plexiglas or some other
kind of clear resin where you could see
the plates and you could see the
material apparently did everything he
could to get all the little air bubbles
and stuff out there so there wouldn&#39;t be
any pathways for the electricity to
break down the material and arc through
there and the experiment was to see how
much voltage you could put on this
capacitor this is a plate capacitor in
this arrangement how much voltage can
you put on this thing before the the
insulating material begins to just break
down well according to Roger he got up
to about a million volts and the thing
would begin to float but it floated in
accordance with principles that have
been described in a patent that was
filed back in the late 50s early 60s by
a gentleman called Thomas Townsend Brown
he and another individual by the name of
a dr. B field he had been a student of
this dr. B field and it became this
effect became known as the B field Brown
effect well he apparently duplicated the
experiments done by be folded Brown but
the one aspect that they found about the
this this arrangement was that the
levitation would always occur or a
movement would occur in the direction of
the positively charged plate so he had
two plates ones negative once positive
because it&#39;s direct current system
and if you have the positive plate on
top it would move in that direction if
you had it on a pendulum it would always
swing in the direction of whatever
direction the positive plate was facing
B field Brown had even done some
experiments in the 50s where he had put
a couple of these type of capacitors on
a like a little pivoting point these
things would spin as you charge them I
got a call from a kid that I had known
at Art Center fella by the name of Brad
Sorensen and he apparently had seen the
magazine recognized my name and
contacted the art director who gave my
phone number he called me up and it
turned out that he had gone to work for
a design firm in the Glendale Pasadena
area of California ultimately wound up
acquiring most of the clientele for this
particular agency in the process had
developed a sort of a business practice
where he would create products
conceptual designs and products for
different clients and the way he
structured his business he would set it
up so that if he came up with some new
and novel design something that was
patentable the client would pay to have
the patent secured and then he would
agree if the patent was in his name he
would glie agreed to license it
exclusively to them and no one else and
then they would pay him royalties so he
got the his clients to pay for all his
patents and then he had all these
royalties coming in and he was a
millionaire before 30 and this is so
this is Brad Sorenson coming back to me
you know eight years after school and
we&#39;re talking and he&#39;s telling me all
these interesting stories and so I there
was an air show that was coming up out
at Norton Air Force Base which used to
be an active Air Force Base right on the
eastern fringe of San Bernardino in
Southern Californians about 50 to 70
miles outside of Los Angeles due east of
Los Angeles right along or just north of
Interstate 10
and I suggested that we get together and
go to this airshow and I&#39;d heard that
they were going to have a flyby or a
flying demonstration by the sr-71
blackbird and he seemed to know a lot
about that so I said well let&#39;s let&#39;s do
that well it turned out the last minute
the the magazine popular science came
back again and and said that they had
some really really crazy deadlines for
another illustration they wanted to know
if I could do over the weekend have it
finished by the following Monday or
Tuesday so I had to beg off on this air
show but Brad had already made
arrangements to go by himself and he was
going to meet me there but he was going
to bring one of his clients with him and
it turned out that this client was a
tall thin white haired man with glasses
with an Italian sounding last name and
was already a millionaire in his own
right he was in civilian life again
after having been either a secretary of
defense or an Undersecretary of Defense
but Brad wanted me to meet this
gentleman and if I&#39;d known this at the
time I probably would have told the
magazine to wait because I had no idea
at that point what I was going to be
missing out on and believe me I&#39;ve
kicked myself ever since because the
following week after Brad got back home
and called me up and told me about the
Air Show he told me about what he had
seen there and apparently right about
the time that the Air Force flying
demonstration team the the Thunderbirds
were planning to begin the show this
gentleman the Brad was with said follow
me and they go walking down to the other
end of the airfield away from where the
crowds were to this huge hangar that&#39;s
at Norton Air Force Base I don&#39;t
remember the building number but it&#39;s
it&#39;s got to be one of the largest
hangars in the Air Force inventory
effect on the base it was called the big
hangar
it looks like four giant Quonset hut
styled hangars that are all connected in
the middle with shafts and work areas
out around the edges and there&#39;s sort of
a divider in the middle but they can
they can work on several of these see
fives in these hangars all at the same
time they can just drive them right in
underneath the roof with their tail
sticking out you know the doors and work
on them inside away from the weather and
the heat so this gentleman took Brad
down there and there was a coordinate of
military police around the hangar and he
walked up to one and he said you know
what do you want why you here and he
says I&#39;m here to talk to the guy who&#39;s
running the show and so the guard goes
in and out comes the same guard with a
gentleman a three-piece suit who
immediately recognizes this this fellow
that brad is with us this fellow who I
speculate was probably frank carlucci
they go inside and immediately after
getting inside the door this this fellow
apparently passes Brad off as his aide
to this this fellow who&#39;s managing this
exhibit that&#39;s going on inside this
hangar and this exhibit is for some of
the local politicians who are secured
for cleared for high security
information and some of the the local
military officials not just so happens
that at that very same time I had a
really good relationship with the Air
Force art program and the Public Affairs
Office for the Air Force in Los Angeles
the fellow who headed up that office at
the time was a colonel by the name of
Thomas Hornets
hor nu ng I believe he&#39;s retired now in
Florida somewhere but there&#39;s a short
short fellow I think he was probably
about five five he met he sort of met
the minimum standards to get into the
military because of his height but very
nice fellow and I believe that he was
probably the individual who did a lot of
interfacing with the services to make
show happened along with the assistance
of at that time Khurram congressman
George e Brown jr. who at the time was
the chairman of the Congressional
Committee on space science and advanced
technology so you see all these things
coming together and then when you hear
what Brad described in the hang you
start to understand why was so
significant well as soon as they walk in
Brad is told by this fellow that he&#39;s
with there&#39;s a lot of things in here
that I didn&#39;t expect they were going to
have on display stuff you probably
shouldn&#39;t be seeing so they&#39;ll talk to
anybody don&#39;t ask any questions just
keep your mouth shut smile and nod but
don&#39;t say anything just enjoy the show
we&#39;re going to get out of here since we
can so in the process the host or the
person running the show was very
engaging to or with the the gentleman
the Brad was with us so they bring them
in and they&#39;re showing them everything
and in the process of this this exhibit
they had a number of I guess you&#39;d call
them high-tech advanced technology
hovercraft that employed different types
of little trap doors that would open and
thrust would come out and blow them
around you could fly you know several
feet off the ground with these things
there was the losing prototype from the
b-2 stealth bomber competition they also
had what was called the the lockheed
pulsar nicknamed the aurora and it was
described as being a large sort of a
flattened out football shape all black
all covered with tiles very much like
the Space Shuttle had three landing your
head to two large main gear underneath
the aircraft two tires on each side and
a long spindling spindle II sort of
nose-gear under the nose very very long
it didn&#39;t appear to have a cockpit of
any kind it instead had a kind of
synthetic vision system looked like a
couple of those little mirrored balls
that you see on the lawns back east in
New England on either side and these
were infrared seeker heads and he was
north of what later became known as the
area 51 weapons range it&#39;s north of Las
Vegas in Nevada said that he came out of
the clouds middlee afternoon and below
him and to his left was this this black
diamond-shaped aircraft flat footed up
football shaped flattened football shape
but this one had a cockpit on a little
canopy had a vertical stabilizer above
vertical stabilizer below and I had a
couple of little like NACA ducks for the
inlets for the air for the jet engines
and then a couple little openings in the
back kind of like the ones on the
stealth fighter you know where they
spread the exhaust stream out so that it
disperses the heat allows the heat
signature of the plane to be dropped off
dramatically so they&#39;re not susceptible
to heat-seeking missiles and things of
that kind but he this pilot in
recounting the story to how McCormack
says that he called his ground
controller and said why didn&#39;t you tell
me there&#39;s other traffic in my area why
didn&#39;t you tell me that there&#39;s somebody
else here and they said well because
there is nobody else there and he said
well the hell there isn&#39;t
I can see him right here and the plane
looks like this it&#39;s black and diamond
shaped and has two tails and with that
this thing banked away from him hit the
afterburners and took off disappeared in
the clouds the next thing that happened
was you got a call from the ground
control unit which just happened to be
the tower at Nellis Air Force Base and
it said divert to Nellis land stay in
the aircraft don&#39;t depart the aircraft
someone will meet you there so he
immediately diverted to Nellis landed
the plane waited until some MPs came out
they took him out of the plane
handcuffed him put him in the plane and
then they spent several days talking to
him about the aircraft that he did not
see
and so this all kind of came full circle
for me but the the thing that Brad said
when he described this Aurora type
aircraft in this hangar along with these
other unusual vehicles was that it
employed a very unusual kind of
technology that it had two propulsion
systems not just one that there were
engines inside the fuselage of the
aircraft that had trap doors that would
open up so that it could fly using these
internal engines and then when it would
get up to say two and a half or three
times the speed of sound where the air
coming over the top of this aircraft is
compressed and superheated and really
really hot forming the shockwave coming
off this aircraft that they had a way of
closing all of these exhaust shoots and
these inlets for these these I guess
there were four engines inside the
aircraft and there was an external type
of pulse detonation engine that would
operate and there was a kind of shallow
Ridge that ran laterally across the the
belly and the backbone of the aircraft
at the widest part there were no wings
and no tails on this aircraft the Brad
had seen in the hangar but along this
Ridge were all these little tiny orifice
these little look like fuel injectors
pointing outward into the air stream
directly behind this Ridge I mean if it
flew this way that they would point
towards the back and the idea was that
as the supersonic shock wave would form
over the front of the aircraft and it
would separate from the surface the
aircraft right where that little Ridge
was they would spray fuel into the
superheated highly compressed air and it
would explode it would spontaneously
explode and as did so it would expand
between the tapered after body of the
vehicle and the shockwave that came off
those ridges so it was like an exhaust
cone turned inside out and it would
pinch the backend of the vehicle and
shoot it forward at speeds of something
like ten or fifteen thousand miles and
I&#39;m just in krump faster than a rifle
bullet basically and that was part of
the reason the whole thing was covered
with these ceramic tiles is to
detect it from melting when it&#39;s flying
through the air the other thing that he
said about that aircraft was that it had
the circular launch tubes in the belly
of the vehicle each of which carried a
single cone-shaped nuclear powered or
conventionally conventionally loaded
warhead in a reentry vehicle that could
be guided into precision and
individually guided to targets and the
way the system operated was was just
absolutely beautiful and elegant and
simple and they had a tie on the outside
with explosive bolts holding it in place
and it was flush with the the tiles on
the belly of the vehicle and up inside
this tube was this this cone-shaped
reentry vehicle pointing nose down
possibly having a kind of a sub o or a
three-piece spacer in there that would
hold it centered in the tube and then
directly above that and behind it was
another circular tile and then behind
that was a big coiled spring and what
they would do is they would fire off the
explosive bolts spring would push this
reentry vehicle out of the tube the SIBO
would fly away and pieces the thing
would stabilize in the Airstream you
ever want to see this take a piece of
paper and curl it up into a little cone
put a little like a fishing weight in
the nose and toss it out the window of
your car when you&#39;re doing 60 miles an
hour to stabilize is just perfect and
then it you know it&#39;ll fly away from the
car but that&#39;s how they would launch
these things and then the spring would
slam this tile down into place and
instantly you&#39;d have perfect aerodynamic
efficiency again in just a fraction of a
second so you could spit these things
out the tiles you know probably explode
when the explosive bolts go off the sub
Oh was probably fiberglass something you
know will be harmless coming back
through the through the atmosphere
because they fly at extremely high
altitudes but these things had the
ability to be just about anywhere in the
world in 30 minutes after launch with
the capability of 121 nuclear you know
probably 10 15 Megaton weapons a
tactical type nuclear reentry vehicle
and then there was the question about
how many of them were made so this this
aircraft has been seen on a number of
occasions particularly coming in and out
of BL Air Force Base which is up near
that gets Modesto or actually I think
it&#39;s northeast of Sacramento and it used
to be the big base for the sr-71
blackbird which eventually was sort of
decommissioned one day when I was
talking with the people at Lockheed
particularly a gentleman by the name of
Tom Keaton who was working in their
Calabasas division at that time that&#39;s
where all the meetings were in caliper
their facility in Calabasas California
he said that they were developing this
artwork as a new version of an existing
aircraft and he went on to describe this
existing aircraft as being one that had
two propulsion systems
he didn&#39;t describe what it looked like
but what he said was that they had had a
recent problem with the operation of
this this first generation aircraft he
didn&#39;t call it you know the f19 or the
aurora or anything just said it had two
propulsion systems but he said that the
pilot was going to land a facility north
of Nellis Air Force Base in the desert
that the weather apparently was bad he
was going to divert to Edwards and then
he had a problem transitioning from one
kind of propulsion system to the other
didn&#39;t specify what they were but of
course this all comes later when you
hear what Brad had to say about what he
saw in the hangar Norton Air Force Base
so but he said this Thompson Thomas
Keaton said that the aircraft had to fly
out over the Pacific and because it was
flying so fast he had to make a big
sweeping arc while he sorted out this
problem transitioning from one
propulsion system to the other and by
the time he was ready to turn around
with the corrections made
back he was over Hawaii and it was only
15 minutes later
well it&#39;s 3,000 miles from the coast of
California Hawaii
15 minutes that means he was doing
12,000 miles an hour or at least to make
that distance in that amount of time so
obviously you know I mean then there
were all of these stories about what
people thought were double sonic booms
or earthquakes or something that when
you tracked all the seismic activity
over Los Angeles there was this perfect
pathway going over Los Angeles that
crossed or basically made a
connect-the-dots kind of illustration
between the Pacific Ocean Los Angeles
Edwards Air Force Base a facility that
Lockheed had near Bakersfield which I
can&#39;t remember recall the name of now
and then of course the area 51
facilities north of Nellis Air Force
Base so it was like they had three
options of where they could land Edwards
this other interim facility of the
Lockheed had and then area 51 so getting
back to Brad&#39;s story at Norton Air Force
Base one of the other things that he
said was that after they showed them all
of this aircraft and all these little
hovercraft and the flying wing and all
this thing he said they had a big black
curtain that divided the hangar into two
two different areas and that behind
these curtains was another big area and
inside this area they had you know all
the lights turned off and they go in
they turn lights on here are three
flying saucers floating off the floor no
cables suspended from the ceiling
holding them up no landing gear
underneath just floating hovering above
the floor and they had little exhibits
at a TV a little videotape running
showing the smallest of the three
vehicles sitting out in the desert
presumably over a dry lakebed someplace
like area 51 and it it showed this
vehicle making three little quick
hopping motions like that and then
accelerating straight up and out of
sight - you couldn&#39;t see it completely
disappearing from view in just a couple
of seconds let me just boom no sound no
sonic boom nothing
they had a cutaway illustration pretty
much like the one I&#39;ll show you in a
little bit that showed what the internal
components of this vehicle were and they
had some of the panels taken off so you
could actually look in and see oxygen
tanks and a little robotic arm that
could extend out from the side of the
vehicle for collecting samples and
things so obviously this is a vehicle
that not only is capable flying around
through the atmosphere but it&#39;s also
capable of going out to space and
collecting samples and it&#39;s using a type
of propulsion system that doesn&#39;t make
any noise as far as he could see had no
moving parts and didn&#39;t have any exhaust
gases or fuel to be expended was just
there hovering so he listened intently
and collected as much information as he
could and when he came back he told me
how he&#39;d seen these three flying saucers
in this hangar ignore an Air Force Base
and on November 12 1988 was a Saturday
and he said that the smallest was
somewhat bell-shaped they were they&#39;re
all identical in shape and proportion
except that there were three different
sizes the smallest at its at its widest
part flat on the bottom somewhat
bell-shaped had a dome or like a half of
a sphere on top a little little ledge
around that and then sloping sides like
a skirt and then the flat bottom the
sides were sloping at about a I&#39;d say
about a thirty five degree angle from
pure vertical and the panel&#39;s that were
around that skirt were what had been
removed so that he could see you know
these big oxygen tanks inside and he was
very specific in describing the oxygen
tanks as being about 16 to 18 inches
diameter about 6 feet long and they were
all radially oriented like the spokes of
the wheel but this dome that was visible
on the top was actually the upper half
of a big sphere shaped crew compartment
that was in the middle of the vehicle
and around the widest around the middle
of this vehicle
this this ledge that was perceived when
you could suggest see the outside of
this vehicle was actually a large
plastic casting that had this big set of
copper coils in it I said it was about
eighteen inches wide at the top about
eight to nine inches thick
had I don&#39;t know maybe 15 to 20 stacked
layers of copper coils inside of it and
then the bottom of the vehicle was about
maybe oh 11 or 12 inches thick
in both cases the coil and this this
large disc at the bottom were like a big
plastic casting sort of a greenish
greenish blue clear plastic or even
maybe might have been glass and embedded
in the plastic where the coils in the
section that was above the ring that was
above around like the spherical shaped
crew compartment but then down below
were these copper plates and they were
divided up into 40 well later I
determined using my conceptual artist
skills determined there were exactly 48
sections like thin slices of pizza pie
and each section within this casting one
big piece casting 24 feet in diameter
probably weighed 4 or 5 tons easy
judging by the thickness and the
diameter must have been monstrous and
weight full of half-inch thick copper
plates each each of the 48 sections had
eight copper plates the plates were half
an inch thick and then the spacing in
between them was like you know 125
percent the thickness of the plates it
was about three quarters of an inch so
if the half-inch thick plates
three-quarters of inch of this
dielectric material in between this this
insulating material so here we are back
to the plate capacitors again and the
prospect of someone finding a way to use
the B field Brown effect this levitation
effect where you charge a capacitor it
lifts towards the positive plates now
when you got eight plates stacked up in
there they alternate goes negative
positive negative positive
four times so you ultimately wind up
with the positive plates always being
above a set of negative plates you know
as you go up the interesting thing about
it was the outer edge of this disc that
supported the the capacitor it was
milled off at the same 35 degree angle
as the rest of the vehicle as was the
edge of this ring that supported the
coils on the inside of the crew
compartment was a big column that ran
down through the middle and there were
four ejection seats mounted back-to-back
on the upper half of this column and
then right in the middle of the column
was a large like a flywheel of some kind
well the synthetic vision system this on
the AR what they called the alien
reproduction vehicle it was also
nicknamed the flux liner this is this
anti-gravity propulsion system this
flying saucer one of three that we&#39;re in
this hangar at Norton Air Force Base
this synthetic vision system uses the
same kind of technology is the gun
slaving system that they have in the
Apache helicopter except in this case
you have two cameras and it picks any
pair of the cameras in that pattern of
six that are around the circumference
including the one on the top
whichever pair most closely matches the
orientation of pilots head so if he
wants to look behind him he can pick
pick a view in that direction the
cameras flew in pairs and he has a
little screen in front of his helmet and
it gives him an alternating view he has
like a little a little set of glasses
that he wears and in fact you can you
can actually buy a 3d viewing system for
your video camera now that does the same
thing what it does it uses a beam
splitter which sends part of light one
way and then part of it at a right angle
and offsets it by about six inches and
then it has electronic shutter in there
that uses these these like a liquid
crystal type material that darkens and
becomes transparent at intervals of
about sixtieth of a second or a
thirtieth of a second and so the camera
says they&#39;re looking around or giving
him a right-left right-left view and the
goggles the things that he&#39;s wearing he
has too little projection screens
inside his helmet and they both / jet
well two cameras but one projection
screen and the glasses have that special
blocking device that allows one eye to
see and then the other eye to see and at
the same time the cameras are projecting
right view left you right if you left
view but they&#39;re doing it in like 30
frames a second and so when he looks
around he has a perfect 3d view of the
outside but no windows so why do they
have no windows well it&#39;s probably
because the voltages that we&#39;re talking
about used in this system similar to the
experiments that were done by mark stamp
or probably something between say a half
a million and a million volts of
electricity Brad said a couple things
about this system now I should also
describe he said there were three
vehicles the first one the smallest one
the most partially taken apart the one
that was shown in the video that was
running in this hangar November 12 1988
at Norton Air Force Base was about 24
feet in diameter at its widest part
right at the base of that flange the
next biggest one was 60 feet in diameter
at the base and based on the
calculations that I did it&#39;s it&#39;s a
shame that we don&#39;t have the the
material that I sent to Leslie Kane
because I had one of Brad&#39;s original
quick little drawings that he did for me
to show me what it was you saw and then
based on all the dimensions and
everything that he gave me I went home
and plotted it all out figured out all
the sizes the angles and everything and
when I was done I came up with this this
particular illustration right here this
shows this shows the cutaway you can see
the the four ejection seats actually
there there are two facing us but there
are also two that are sort of facing
away from us on the other side of that
central column you can see the the
oxygen tanks down here in the corner
that that actually go all the way around
the inside of the skirt there&#39;s also
another set of oxygen tanks that are
inside the the crew compartment sphere
and then let&#39;s see here right in this
area here
is the the large flywheel type mechanism
that&#39;s right at the center of this this
device and then around the circumference
here you can see this ring okay I&#39;m
sorry about that
you can see the ring that&#39;s basically
the coils now I started looking at the
design of this thing and it occurred to
me that what I was looking at there was
a huge Tesla coil which is kind of like
an open-air transformer you take a large
diameter coil with a few heavy large
diameter windings of copper coil coil
it&#39;s like a big like a doughnut shaped
coil or a toroidal coil is what it&#39;s
called a toroid like a doughnut and you
say have maybe a hundred windings in
this coil and then in the middle of that
coil you have a column with several
hundred windings maybe a much finer wire
but what happens is when you throw
electricity on this large diameter coil
it creates a field in the field is
itself shaped like a big invisible
doughnut and the the field lines in this
in this toroidal or doughnut shaped
field that&#39;s around the the electrified
coils the field lines are all in planes
that are radially oriented just like the
capacitors and so what happens is you
have a transformer you put a certain
amount of electricity on the few
windings in the large diameter coil and
what they do is they induce through
inductance is the electrical term they
induce a much higher voltage of
electricity on these many many windings
that are on that central column it&#39;s
like a transformer you get step up or
step down which means you can go from
say a low voltage with a very high
amperage or amount of electricity
flowing through the wires and you can
change that to a very high voltage with
low amperage or a low amount of of
actual voltage but the potential the
punch behind it the voltage is much much
higher and that&#39;s what the system does
it takes electricity according to Brad
to large 24 volt marine style batteries
these deep deep deep charge type marine
batteries of use on you know these big
boats and the military and stuff you you
basically use that to somehow put an
alternating current through these
windings you step up that electricity
through the secondary coil that&#39;s on the
column in the middle you get this
extremely high voltage can selectively
put the voltage on any of these 48
capacitor sections well why would you
want to do that I mean if you&#39;re using
just a normal Tesla coil you usually
only have maybe one or two capacitors in
the whole system but you&#39;re talking
about a different type of capacitor here
talking about capacitors and made up of
plates plates that are shaped like long
thin triangles and they&#39;re already lis
oriented just like the spokes the wheel
just like the oxygen tanks just like the
field lines from that large diameter
coil so you begin to realize as you look
at the system if you&#39;re an electrician
or you just somebody knows a little bit
about Tesla coils and the way that
they&#39;re set up you begin to realize that
the orientation of the components is
really the key to making the system work
why so many different capacitor sections
well okay if you just have one big disk
like Mark Stambaugh did with his
experiment at University of Tucson which
by the way was confiscated by men
claiming to be from the government that
were claiming privilege under the
National Security Act they took all the
stuff interviewed all of the people who
saw the experiments told everybody to
keep their mouth shut not talk about it
but I heard about it from his roommate
who knew what had happened but in that
case you just get levitation but you
don&#39;t get any control you have this
thing floating around and it&#39;s just sort
of floating on you know whatever this
field is that it&#39;s producing but you
don&#39;t have any control so what happens
you break that that disk up into 48
individual sections and then you can
decide how much electricity you want to
put on this side or over there
that side and so you control the amount
of electricity the amount of thrust and
vectoring that you get you can make the
thing roll around like a coin about to
come to stop after you flick it on to a
desk you can make it go straight up you
can make it bank and turn yon pitch
whatever you want to by virtue of the
fact that you can control where the
electricity goes in most 48 different
sections and if you ever take a circle
and you divide it up into 48 equal
sections you&#39;ll find that those are
really thin little slices I mean they&#39;re
like maybe 1/10 or 1/12 of the kind of
typical wedge you get when somebody
slices you a piece of pie a pizza you
know or something but anyway so you have
this capacitor or these 48 individual
capacitors and you have one big Tesla
coil so you&#39;ve got to have some kind of
a rotating spark gap just like the
distributor in your car that sends the
electricity out to each of those
sections and then you have to have some
way of controlling how much electricity
goes to each one so but the system
explains itself in a way because you&#39;ve
got four sets four pairs of plates you
know four sets of one positive one
negative x 48 section so what do you do
you have your spark gap set up so that
if you want to have only a little bit of
electricity on this one particular
capacitor module you only charge to the
plates in the stack you want a little
bit more on the one next that you charge
for you want a lot you charge six and if
you want the maximum thrust from that
one particular module you charge all
eight so that&#39;s how they can control it
subtly they can get it to do whatever
they want
now Brad when you describe the control
system said that on the one side there
was this big high voltage what they call
a potentiometer it&#39;s like it like a
rheostat like a big controller it allows
you to put progressively more
electricity through the system as you as
you push the lever now on the other side
of the control system there was a sort
of a metallic bar that came up like a
like a kind of like a storks neck and at
the top of it or right at the very tip
of it was a
sort of metallic looking ball well
attached to that ball was a kind of a
bowl that seemed to just hang off the
bottom of that ball it just almost like
it was magnetically attached to it and
he said that the system when you really
when you watched it as you were standing
next to it he said the whole thing would
just sit there and it would kind of rock
and list almost like a large ship at
anchor in the ocean at a harbor you know
floating on the water
literally on a sea of energy is I think
it was was a son
dr. Moray did experiments with different
kinds of energy something that may have
been scalar energy up in Utah back in
the the 20s and the 30s I believe it was
but he taught he wrote a book called the
sea of energy and he describes this type
of energy and Brad said that when this
thing was moving around that the system
wasn&#39;t energized to its full strength
and so components inside of the ship
were still subject to some influenced by
gravity he says as it would start to
list in one direction that Bowl because
of the influence of gravity would swing
in the same directions it started to
tilt it would it would slide over and it
would power up the system on that side
and would bring it back to a rided
position all by itself completely
unmanned it would sit there and it would
correct itself just while I was sitting
there well not too long ago about two
years ago I came across an article in I
think it was NASA&#39;s publication called
tech briefs and in this in this system
in this in this article in this one of
these issues I found a system that had
been designed and patented by a couple
of scientists working at Caltech in
Pasadena under contract with I believe
it was a Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
NASA and they had developed a whole
computerized network of sensors and
systems and computers it was all linked
fiber optically well why would that make
any difference why would you want to
have a system that&#39;s all linked fiber
optically and the reason is is that if
you find a way to control gravity and
made
reduce the mass of a vehicle but the
very thing that makes it float if you
find a way to reduce the mass that
vehicle propel it ungodly speeds like in
the video where Brad said it hop three
times and then took off like a shot if
you&#39;re able to do that then what are the
other side benefits of that if you&#39;ve
somehow found a way of tapping into this
the scalar field is zero-point energy if
what the scientists believe is true that
the zero-point energy is actually what
keeps the electrons around the atomic
structure of everything in our universe
so it keeps them energized to keep those
little electrons spinning in their
different clouds around the nucleus of
every atom in our world keeps them going
keeps them from crashing into the
nucleus like a satellite orbiting the
Earth that gets pulled into the
atmosphere by gravitational drag well if
you have a way of interfering with that
interaction that absorption of
zero-point energy by those electrons and
they begin to slow down and every atom
in the universe is just like a little
gyroscope it&#39;s got all these electrons
spinning around the nucleus something
have kind of a gyroscopic effect which
is the effect we called inertia and mass
you have one nucleus with a proton of
Neutron and one electron helium or
excuse me hydrogen
you know spinning around like that no
not very much mass not too much inertia
but you take uranium-235 with 235
electrons all spinning around in their
different clouds there&#39;s a lot of mass
there are a lot of inertia because it&#39;s
like a bigger gyroscope in a way which
that&#39;s the the analogy that I&#39;ve kind of
picked up here
but if you have a way of interfering
with that absorption of zero-point
energy so those electrons become
de-energized they begin to slow down the
effect of that inertia that gyroscopic
effect begins to drop off and the mass
drops off to even though the atomic
structure is intact even though it&#39;s
still there it&#39;s still uranium it&#39;s not
as heavy one of the things that Einstein
said was you could never accelerate
hitha at anything up to and past the
speed of light because if you did so you
would have to have all the energy in the
universe because as you accelerate
through space
mass increases in one of the old films
showing this concept shows a train going
faster and faster towards the speed of
light
but the train keeps gigging bigger and
bigger and longer until the engine just
can&#39;t pull it so it can ever pass the
speed of light but what if what if you
have a system device that absorbs that
zero-point energy and prevents it from
interacting with the atomic structure of
your vehicle and at the same time is
providing additional power to the
capacitor section these this whole
electrical system that&#39;s going on in the
vehicle that&#39;s running what happens is
that as you go faster as you accelerate
all that added energy which would keep
those electrons spinning faster and
faster increasing the mass like Einstein
described that same energy would be
converted into thrust but it&#39;s not
allowed it&#39;s not it&#39;s not being
channeled in a way that allows it to
interact with the atomic structure of
the vehicle and make it get heavier and
more massive have more inertia so the
fast you go literally the faster you
were able to go because you&#39;re tapping
all that energy which would otherwise
increase your mass just like Einstein
said so in effect fast you go the easier
it gets to it the easier it becomes to
go up to and exceed the speed of light
now Brad said that in this exhibit at
Norton Air Force Base that one
three-star general said that these
vehicles were capable of doing light
speed or better oh by the way and the
largest of three vehicles was about 120
to 130 feet in diameter I mean that&#39;s
that&#39;s massive when you think about it&#39;s
just huge there&#39;s a scientist in Utah by
the name of Maury be king he&#39;s written a
book called tapping the zero-point
energy and what he maintains is that
this energy is embedded in space-time
all around us it&#39;s in everything we see
I think it was
was it James James Clerk Maxwell
speculated that there&#39;s enough of this
this flux this electrical charge in in
the nothingness of space that if you
could capture all the energy that was
embedded in just a cubic yard of space
that you&#39;d have enough energy to boil
the oceans of the entire world that&#39;s
how much energy is sitting there waiting
to be tapped now one of the things that
more a be King said was that the best
way to tap that energy is by driving it
out of equilibrium it&#39;s just like a
bunch of cigarette smoke in a box but if
you somehow send a shockwave through it
you can get a force you can get ripples
through it and then if you have a way of
collecting that energy at the other end
you have a way of tapping into it using
it now one of the ways that they believe
you can actually demonstrate the
existence of this force is something
called the Casimir effect this is
something that was discovered years ago
I was probably just before the turn of
the century before in 1899 to 1900 and
it was described as an experiment where
scientists took a couple of heavy steel
plates suspended them on tracks with the
faces parallel and his thinking was that
if there&#39;s this this omnidirectional
omnipresent force is all around us it&#39;s
acting on us from all sides we can&#39;t
feel anything because it&#39;s in
equilibrium but if you create an
environment where it becomes channeled
in a way you put two big pieces of Steel
together like this where their faces
become closer and closer that energy
can&#39;t get into that little gap in
between but it&#39;s pushing on the outer
surfaces from all direction so what
happens you get those places those two
plates close enough together and they
slam together very very hard and they
release all kinds of heat in the process
now there are a number scientists that
said well if you could have some kind of
a foliated charge collector that had all
these plates stacked up you know just a
few millimeters apart and get them all
to slam together at the same time you
could somehow tap that energy but
apparently this system here this this
alien reproduction vehicle this flux
liner has a way of doing that somehow
electronically
brad had described the fact that the
central column has a kind of vacuum
chamber in it and the vacuum chamber is
one of the things that you hear all
these scientists who describe these
over-unity or free energy devices they
build they all have some kind of vacuum
tubes vacuum technology even the
Philadelphia Experiment where they
supposedly made a whole ballot
battleship disappear use tons and tons
of vacuum tubes the real big ones they
used to have back in the 40s well brad
maintained that inside this this big
vacuum chamber in the central column
that&#39;s inside of everything else inside
of the flywheel inside of the secondary
coils of this Tesla coil inside of the
end of the crew compartment there is
this vacuum chamber with mercury vapour
in it a mercury vapour metallic mercury
when it becomes a vapor is what they
call a noble gas it will conduct
electricity but it produces all kinds of
ionic effects it these these little
molecules of mercury become charged in
unusual ways and if you fire a
tremendous amount of electricity through
mercury vapor that&#39;s in a partial vacuum
there&#39;s something special something
unusual that happens in that process and
I believe it&#39;s the process that more I
can describe when he said driving the
energy in the vacuum out of equilibrium
putting some kind of a shockwave through
it you know sending a big electrical
charge through there you know like like
one of those plasma spheres you see you
touch them with little lightning bolts
come over and touch the side where you
touch it with your fingers and stuff the
same kind of thing but in a very
controlled very directional kind of way
now the other thing that I believe
happens here is that as this system
begins to tap into the zero-point energy
and is drawing it away from the local
environment the whole craft becomes
lighter and way it becomes partially
mass canceled if you will which is one
of the reasons why just a little bit of
energy on the capacitors can shoot it
all over the place now I talked about
this article in tech briefs where they
were developing a whole system that was
all linked by fiber optics it allows you
to evaluate and control computers and
different systems well one of the things
that I believe that happens is when you
take a system like this and you fire it
up and everything in the system starts
to become mass canceled the next thing
that happens that the electrons that are
flowing through the system also become
mass canceled and what does that mean it
means it has that system and all the
electrons flowing through that big Tesla
coil become mass canceled it also
becomes the perfect superconductor which
means the efficiency of system goes
right through the ceiling see you get
dramatic efficiency just like the whole
thing was dunked into liquid nitrogen or
made out of pure silver or pure gold you
know which is certain temperatures are
perfect conductors you have all these
these these fields being induced and one
of the things that happens is it because
these fields around that main coil are
all they have the field lines that are
radially ordered just like the
capacitors in the bottom of the craft I
believe that what happens is you wind up
on a very microscopic sail scale you
wind up with the same thing that you
have in that little toy I described
earlier the Newton&#39;s Cradle where the
little ball bearings go back and forth
except in this case you&#39;ve got all this
electrical potential all these electrons
that are sitting in the capacitor
sections and those electrons are all
lining up on the field lines they&#39;re
just like a bunch of soldiers standing
there getting ready to march off to war
they&#39;re all single file lines and every
time you hit those capacitors and the
electrons with a pulse of electricity
from the Tesla coil you create
longitudinal waves the same scalar waves
we talked about way back in the
beginning and I believe that what you do
there is you&#39;re creating an effect like
in a like a barrier in a way that that
prevents this the zero point flux from
interacting with the atomic structure of
the vehicle and so it becomes lighter
and it be accelerated incredible speed
in 1992
you know I described this thing to
people that I met and I went to an air
show at Edwards Air Force Base it was
right after the Persian Gulf War I met
some friends of mine one of my clients
Rockwell had some exhibits there and
they they had a friend a mutual friend
who followed by the name of Kent sellin
se llen
who worked for the ail corporation and
as it turned out
Kent sellin and I had a mutual friend it
turned out that he and I both knew a
fella by the name bill Scott or William
Scott who was a local editor for a trade
publication called Aviation Week and
space technology now bill Scott used to
be a test pilot at Edwards Air Force
Base back in the early 1970s and Kent
Selin had been a crew chief working on
the plane that bill Scott flew now here
we were talking about the Persian Gulf
War and in the wake of that particular
war I met a young lady that worked at
the restaurant where I ate every day and
she was complaining because her husband
who was a marine and gone over to the
Persian Gulf and he was over there for
six months a year or something but he&#39;d
ride home and eat a lease Terry&#39;s about
how there were UFOs flying all over the
Persian Gulf at night over the Gulf
they&#39;d see these things if it around the
sky so I was talking to catch selling
about this fellow and describing these
things that he had seen when he was a
Marine on one of these ships in the
Persian Gulf and he nodded his head and
smiled a big red grin and he winked in
cases yeah I know what you&#39;re talking
about and I said well how do you know
what how what how do you know what I
what I&#39;m talking about
he says well because I&#39;ve seen one I
sitting at that point I keyed in on
something that John Eppolito of inter
fusion had told me about something in a
hangar something that someone had seen
in a hangar and then I I remembered
something that a young lady who claims
to be a UFO abductees she said she&#39;d met
a young lady who was in the Air Force
worked at Edwards Air Force Base her
husband was a security guy that worked
at North base which is a facility where
they keep all his classified aircraft
and during the Christmas break one year
she said that they were all bored and
lonely he was the only guy out there so
he invited her out to North base in the
middle of night he took her around he
showed her all these classified aircraft
and these hangars and one of them was a
flying saucer and what it looked like it
was flat on the bottom had sloped sides
has a dome on the top with the little
plastic bubbles with the synthetic
vision
system the whole bit so I said to Kent
when I&#39;m meeting him at this hair show
at Edwards in 92 I said well was it flat
on the bottom and had sloping sides and
a dull on the top and little bubbles in
a little camera things he&#39;s oh you&#39;ve
seen one I said why let me borrow your
PIN so I took out a little piece of
paper drew a sketch I said you look like
that he said yeah that&#39;s it that&#39;s what
it looks like I said well so when did
you see this he says I saw it in 1973 I
said well what where when how do you
know when you see he says why I was a
crew chief he said I worked on Bill
Scott&#39;s playing when use a test pilot
and he says one night my ship supervisor
said to me go out to North base they&#39;ve
got a power unit out there a ground
power unit for an aircraft that&#39;s
leaking or failed or something so we
need to take a tow vehicle out there go
out pick it up bring it back drop it off
at the repair depot he says then you can
go for the night because we finished all
our other work well instead of going
around the big perimeter road that goes
up to the main entrance of North base
what this young man did what Kent salad
did in 1973 one of the same years I was
in the Air Force he drove straight
across the dry lakebed at Edwards to the
north base facility assuming that the
security was so tight out there that
they would see him coming you know with
their thermal imaging systems or
whatever they had back then and that
they would the security people would
pick him up and say okay it&#39;s it&#39;s over
there get it and leave well instead what
happened is he comes up off the dry
lakebed rolls right up on the tarmac and
is going down these rows of hangars are
all Quonset style hangars back then and
he stops in front of the first one with
the doors cracked expecting to find this
defective ground power unit and what
does he see he sees this flying saucer
sitting in the hangar hovering off the
ground which brings me back to John
Eppolito story about a guy who saw a UFO
and a hangar and you know some time
prior to 1982 when I met him so or 1980
I guess I met him in 1980 actually but
but so it starts coming full circle so I
said well what happened he says well
this thing you know is flat on the
bottom sloping sides had little cameras
in these little plastic domes all over
was a door on the side he says I wasn&#39;t
there for 15 seconds and I heard
footsteps running up to me before I
could even turn around look he says
there was a machine gun barrel at my
throat another one over here and he says
the gruff voice says close your eyes and
get on the ground we&#39;re going to blow
your head off so they put a hood over
his head blindfolded him hauled him off
and they spent 18 hours debriefing him
and while they did they told him things
about this vehicle that my buddy Brad
didn&#39;t even know just from what he could
see you know standing in that exhibit
with his eyes closed you know its eyes
open not saying anything well Kent&#39;s
Ellen tells me that the upper and the
lower sections of the crew compartment
they&#39;re made out of a what&#39;s called a
pol true dat sphere it means you take
you know composite material like Kevlar
fiberglass or carbon thread and you you
embed it with resin and then you wrap it
around us a ball shaped mandrel it was
still wet and all these fibers bind
together into a huge highly incredibly
strong sphere probably stronger than
steel and capable you know holding up to
you know machine gun fire everything
won&#39;t go through it because it&#39;s just
like a big piece of armor plating but at
the same time they set it up so the top
and the bottom halves can be split and
they mold a little flange all the way
around on each of those and that flange
is what holds the primary windings of
the Tesla coil together now you said
that one of the things that they
designed into the system was that if the
at you know the pilots of this thing
we&#39;re at high altitude and they had to
eject there&#39;s all this ini as to air
around the craft it could fry these
pilots when they went to eject so they
couldn&#39;t just pop out of there you said
that they had a series of explosive
bolts around the upper and the lower
halves of the sphere and when it came
time to eject the whole top of the
sphere would come off and it would pull
the outer sheath of that central column
along with the ejection seats right out
of the vehicle and it would offer a
protective shield around them as they
were going up because the flywheel is
right underneath their feet this is big
nine foot diameter flywheel in the
smallest version of the craft so it&#39;d
come off of course the charge would
start to dissipate dissipate you know as
this thing flew away and I even
speculated that that in some sense this
this
bowl-shaped upper section the crew
compartment that they&#39;re sitting inside
of could even act as a rudimentary
re-entry shield that they were coming
back down through the atmosphere when
Brad had said that that all the
components in the system were all
off-the-shelf components things that you
could find you know right in the
inventory they have their own oxygen
supply and he says they eject once they
get below 15,000 feet and the individual
seats come down off this central column
on a set of rails just like little
railroad cars they come off one by one
and parachutes come out and away they go
I looked at all this information that I
got from Brad I saw you know realize
there&#39;s a mechanical arm that can extend
out from these little trap doors that
open up on the side of the vehicle it&#39;s
obvious that these things are capable of
space travel and then I remembered
something that the heave and denies
telling me now but 10 15 years ago when
I was first talking to Tom Bearden one
of the first things that he ever told me
when I was talking about scaler effects
and you know what it was and what it
does and how&#39;s it work are the Soviets
weaponizing this technology all these
things that he was speculating about one
of the things that he said just off the
top of his head probably didn&#39;t even
realize the significance of it at the
time and he since has denied saying it
one of the things that he said was heavy
and for wondered why the NASA budget has
been cut back so severely well it&#39;s
because because they&#39;ve got all this
other technology that is so much better
so much faster
I mean Lightspeed or better come on so
much better than rocket-propelled
spaceships that take months sometimes
years to get to the outer reaches of the
solar system why would you put millions
and millions of dollars in knowing what
a public works program for scientists
why invest all that money when you have
this system classified system that&#39;s
used exclusively like probably by the
National Security Agency the CIA or Air
Force intelligence or something but
it&#39;ll go anywhere in the solar system in
in hours compared to months or years why
spend all that money on NASA when you&#39;ve
got something they&#39;ll go there right now
right now so when people speculate that
there may be a
and base on the backside of the moon or
there might be bases on Mars I can tell
you that I am almost positive that
that&#39;s true fact I am positive that it&#39;s
true he says well he says I work at the
b-2 bomber facility now to plant 42 in
Palmdale and Lancaster and so I&#39;ve had a
turn that through the Air Force Public
Affairs Office I got a tour that whole
facility I know right where that is I&#39;ve
been there he says well then you also
probably know that caddy quarter across
from the big production facility for the
b-2 bomber down at the southwest corner
of the field is the Lockheed skunkworks
that huge complex down there I said yeah
I know exactly where that is he says
well a year ago the summer of this would
have been the summer of 1992 he said
after they passed this legislation that
said you can&#39;t smoke indoors anymore in
any government sponsored building this
kind of thing he says I was outside
about 10:30 at night because I work a
late shift and he said smoking a
cigarette and he said I noticed that the
sheriff&#39;s deputies were blocking off all
of the streets surrounding plant 42 and
when they do that and I have since
confirmed that they do do that because I
got a ticket coming on that same
facility doing some work for for
Rockwell a year and a half later but the
the sheriff&#39;s deputies confirm that yes
in fact when anytime there&#39;s a
classified aircraft that&#39;s coming into
land or is departing from plan for t2
they block off civilian traffic and all
the surrounding streets so they don&#39;t
see any of the classified stuff so he
says I notice all the streets being
blocked off because I can see the red
and blue lights around the perimeter of
the base and he said that he said then I
noticed that all the these big mercury
vapour lamps that are around the edge of
the roof for the Lockheed skunkworks all
are distinguished
he said the big bypass doors in front of
this huge hangar it must be like a
between a quarter of a million and half
a million square feet it&#39;s a mammoth
hangar probably 12 story tall ceilings
just huge building the doors are open
and sitting out in front of this hangar
or is this circular formation of these
vehicles but there are really weird
vehicles they&#39;re like these little like
a little tractor with a turret on it and
the turret has a big mechanical arm with
a basket on the end of it
kind of thing that these electrical
linemen used to work on these high high
tension power lines and stuff but the
baskets are all up in the air and strung
from each one of them in this big circle
is this big black curtain that comes
down there&#39;s a rope that ties them all
together and they&#39;re in a circle and he
said that that particular night was a
very smoggy summer evening in 1992 and
he said in Palmdale I get so smoggy up
there that the city lights make the sky
glow it&#39;s sort of a dull orange and he
said I looked up above the circle of
vehicle and up above them and about five
hundred feet was his big black
lens-shaped flying saucer just sitting
there above the vehicles and out of the
midst of this group of vehicles a man
comes out with a big blue green handheld
flash light shines it up the vehicle
flashes at three times you said there
are three blue green lights underneath
the vehicle and they flash at him three
times and then this thing lowers down
into this cluster vehicles the arms all
extend out over the center cover it all
up and then they all trundle into the
hangar the doors closed lights come on
the sheriff&#39;s leave well he said he
smoked a lot of cigarettes for the next
week after that waiting to see something
else and a week later his his patience
was rewarded and he said that the whole
process reversed itself he says the
lights go out the doors opened this
clustered vehicles come out the arms all
stand up like this and he said after a
while he said this thing silently raises
up to about 500 feet of other vehicles
the guy comes out with the flash light
flashes two times it flashes its lights
at him three times and then he said this
thing took off covered the entire length
of the runway which is right next to the
b2 facility went past him and
disappeared into the dark in under two
seconds and he did it this vehicle did
it without any noise without a
supersonic shockwave no sonic boom
nothing just sure like he&#39;d been fired
for mechanics is it changed my life he
said to change my whole perspective cuz
he says then I says I know I got
antigravity he says they got massless
propulsion he says they&#39;ve got
technology that the mighty
even gotten recovered from some kind of
a spacecraft that came from God knows
where some other star system but he says
the fact is they&#39;ve got it we go to the
Patent Office and we started looking for
patents and we find patents by Nikola
Tesla they all go all the way back to
the 1890s that looked just like this
technology these big these energy
transmitters these these these Tesla
coil type things that he was designing
with with which which also had coils
just like the one in the the alien
reproduction vehicle where the outer
bank of the coils are sloping at an
angle almost like a section cut out of a
cone or frustum is what they call it
then we find a diagram and this is one
of the things that I sent to Leslie Kane
that I wish we had here now but there
was a patent and the patent was filed by
a James King jr. and this patent looks
just like the system except that instead
of having a dome for a crew compartment
it has a cylinder in the center of that
thing the same shape the flat bottom the
sloping sides has the coils around the
circumference has the the capacitor
plates that are all radially oriented
filed in initially in 1960 the patent
was secured in 1967 the same year that
this photo was taken near Provo Utah and
the clincher is the guy who filed the
patent worked with Townsend Brown
Townsend Brown had worked at a
laboratory in near Princeton New Jersey
with a scientist by the name of Agnew
Bahnson in the bonds and laboratories
they did all these experiments that they
presented this what they were calling
electrogravitic propulsion to the Navy
and the Navy basically pooh-poohed it at
least according to the the stories they
didn&#39;t seem interested and yet on film
there is a film available now you can
get it from Lantis rising magazine a
couple other places there is some some
video that was converted from the 16
millimeter film that was shot by Agnew
bahnson&#39;s daughter originally was called
daddy&#39;s laboratory and it shows all
these experiments that that Bahnson and
Thomas Townsend Brown did along with
their assistant Jane
King who filed a patent that show little
discs you know levitating is shooting
off Sparks and stuff and so it all kind
of comes full circle you see that not
only it got the technology they&#39;ve got
the technology and deployment not only
does it fly but it looks just like the
patents that were filed back in the 60s
the same year that photos were taken
near area 51 between area 51 and Provo
Utah by a military pilot and and it
shows all all the same features shows
all the same shapes and so the bottom
line for me is that that regardless of
whether you you understand all the fine
points of the technology its technology
exists they&#39;re people that have seen it
I&#39;ve seen these things myself and so
it&#39;s to me it&#39;s just really a matter of
time before they bring this technology
out of the black and begin to let us use
it for other things like pollution free
production of energy big one big
environmental say with you could
probably take a couple little things and
look like those flying saucers and put
them around a crankshaft and use them to
drive an engine pollution free no use of
fuel probably have to shield it against
all the ionization but you could
probably find a way to do it I&#39;m sure
you could find a way to make electro
electro gravity driven motor electric
motor the only other thing I could say
is that when I was talking about the
fiber optic control system that&#39;s also
one of the things that goes back to the
original Roswell account that there were
all these little fibers with light going
through them and they couldn&#39;t explain
what this stuff was well right Robin
right okay well why would you need a
fiber optic system in a spaceship well
okay if suddenly everything in the
vehicle suddenly becomes mass canceled
and even the electrons become mass
canceled it means that all of the all of
the telemetry that&#39;s going through your
system is going to go out a haywire it&#39;s
going to be like suddenly the system
goes through a phase change and
everything&#39;s superconducting so you have
to have some way of maintaining the same
level of control for your spark gaps
the control of the amount of electricity
goes out to the diff capacitors so that
when you change the control stick you
still get the same amount of movement
and deflection in the system even when
you go into a state of maths
cancellation or Parcel mash cancellation
because the electrons are also mass
canceled and so they come
superconducting circuits well why use
why use fiber optics because photons
have no mass supposedly so they&#39;re
unaffected so it means that any
information any telemetry that you send
back and forth to your computer doesn&#39;t
matter if the computer functions is the
superconducting level because it just
makes it faster more efficient smarter
but you want to be able to control the
aircraft so it doesn&#39;t crash what&#39;s the
best way to do with fiber optics he
specifically said this was a waste of
taxpayers money to have covert
operations that have developed advanced
technologies in this energy or
propulsion area and then NASA is also
getting tax dollars to do the same thing
all over again the parallel development
he felt it was a waste of taxpayers
money I&#39;ve seen other senators say the
same thing in fact that particular
senator requested information from the
president about such covert operations
