STATISTICAL SOURCES
The authoritative source book for statistics in organized religion in the United
States is the Federal compilation “ Religious Bodies, 1926, Vol. I and II" pub­
lished by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. This compilation was
made in 1926 and published several years later. It was a well-organized census
under the direction of Leon E. Truesdell, chief statistician for population, and
Timothy F. Murphy, expert special agent, taking full advantage of the assistance of
denominational officers and— in the case of some loosely organized groups—
of specially designated investigators.
Another in the series of religious censuses was due in 1936. Appropriations for
this purpose however were denied by the House committee but money from other
sources was provided. The census however was delayed until 1938 and then was
greatly affected by lack of cooperation from certain religious bodies and by insuf­
ficient clerical provision. It is uncertain when the material that has been col­
lected will be released. It is not certain that the material that will be released
will be as comprehensive and accurate as the compilation of 1926.
Meanwhile the “Christian Herald” published a compilation of membership sta­
tistics in its 60th anniversary number, in October, 1938, collected by Rev. H. C.
Weber (in succession to Rev. C. L. Kieffer, deceased, former statistical authority
of the “ Herald” ). This compilation omitted the large number of minor religious
bodies, summarizing them under one category.
In the January 14, 1939, issue of “ Information Service,” a weekly publication
of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, a detailed compila­
tion of religious bodies in the United States was published, believed to be the most
authoritative yet presented. This compilation made by the editor of the YEAR­
BOOK is the basis of the statistical tables which follow. The editor has had re­
markable cooperation from the great majority of the officials of the many bodies
represented, who are charged with statistical responsibility. The cost of this com­
pilation has been borne by the Federal Council and is offered as a service to or­
ganized religion of all faiths.
Below, the yearbooks or other statistical source-books of many of the larger
bodies are listed. The list is imperfect. It should be enlarged and the assistance of
clerks and statisticians of other bodies is earnestly asked in making the list more
complete.

TABLE VIII REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS BODIES ARRANGED IN
FAMILY GROUPS OR CONNECTIONS
(These groupings are made with some diffidence and are of course exposed, as they should
be, to criticism. They attempt however to make the confusion which the 200 listed religious
bodies in the United States present less puzzling. The larger bodies are listed first in alpha­
betical order, followed by the smaller bodies also alphabetically arranged. The details are
included in this presentation to provide the basis for future classifications which may be
suggested as more illuminating)

Note: In this Directory the religious bodies are arranged alphabetically and by their
official names. If the official name is not known, consult the Check-List on pages 195-202,
which contains the official name (in caps), the kev classification (as, e.g.. Baptist) and
the colloquial designation (as, e.g., "Quakers,** for ‘‘Friends*’).
In the 1937 Yearbook the Directory grouped the bodies by family or relationship. In the
tables of statistics in this edition, as well as in the Directory, the alphabetical arrangement is
adopted. Families or Croups are however carefully presented in the tables on pages 12-16,
both major and minor bodies in their primary, though not always in their secondary, rela­

It is believed that this Directory is more complete than any heretofore offered.

NORTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION
The early historic local independency of Baptist churches in America tended to impede
the formation of any general organization until in 1814 a Ceneral Missionary Convention
was formed to permit Baptists to express themselves in terms of missionary activities. In
1845 the state conventions in the South withdrew to organize the Southern Baptist Con­
vention. In 1907 the Northern Baptist Convention was organized, a delegated body, under
whose direction the many agencies of the Baptists in the North and West now operate.
Churches: 7,603. Inclusive Membership: 1,471,788. Membership 13 years of age
and over: 1,408,501.

THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES
The biennium, 1937 and 1938,
brought a far reaching self conscious­
ness to the larger Protestant bodies
in the United States. The tensions
abroad, some of them quite disastrous
to some forms of organized religion,
deeply concerned Protestant leader­
ship in America, and brought first a
deep interest in the appraisal of re­
ligion in the world, and second, a
fundamental interest in resources both
spiritual and material.
This self consciousness evidenced
itself in two directions particularly,
— one, a direct approach of Protes­
tantism through its major unifying
body, the Federal Council of the
Churches of Christ in America, to its
constituency through a Preaching
Mission. The Rev. E. Stanley Jones,
a famous missionary leader from India,
headed up a mission in the autumn
of 1936 which reached twenty-four
strategic centers. On this mission out­
standing preachers and some very well
known laymen, both men and women,
attracted over two million persons and
contacted especially over 35,000 min­
isters of all persuasions.
The success in 1936 suggested a
continuation of the Mission through
1937. The following list of centers
visited in 1937 was as follows:
Salt Lake City, Utah . . . Sept. 2 6 -2 9
Portland, M a in e .................. Oct. 2 1 -2 4
Albany, Schenectady,
Troy, N. Y .........................Oct. 2 4-27

Wichita, Kans...................... Nov. 18-21
Quincy, III.-Hannibal,
Mo.-Keokuk, la.............. Nov. 2 1 -2 4
Jacksonville, Fla................... Dec. 2 - 5
The teams with their diverse make­
up illustrated in an unusually fine
way the cooperative side of American
Protestantism and greatly re-enforced
the tendency toward unitive effort.
As a sequel to the success of the
Preaching Mission, the Federal Coun­
cil, Department of Evangelism, de­
veloped a plan for reaching the Am eri­
can campus. A national committee
was organized early in 1937, on which
a number of youth and educational
groups were represented, with Mary
E. Woolley, formerly of M t. Holyoke
College, as honorary chairman, and
President John A. Mackay, of Prince­
ton Seminary, as chairman. The total
of 48 speakers including E. Stanley
Jones of India, T . Z. Koo of China,
Sam Higginbottom, of India, and the
Rt. Hon. Margaret Grace Bondfield
of England, participated in this plan.
The following missions were held
during 1938:

Not only did the student bodies
in the universities respond to the
Mission speakers and message, but
faculty bodies were receptive and co­
operative. The missions were suc­
cessful enough to warrant their con­
tinuance during the early months of
1939.
Church Union
The second manifestation of the
growing self consciousness of Prot­
estantism was the extraordinary in­
terest which developed in church
union. In 1937, two ecumenical con­
ferences were held under the auspices
of two groups, one the Universal
Christian Council for Life and W ork,
the other, the W orld Conference on
Faith and Order. Both were held in
England, one at Oxford, the other at
Edinburgh. Both were delegated meet­
ings with representation from all ma­
jor Protestant groups and from the
Eastern Orthodox Church.
Inasmuch as these conferences met
under the shadow of political crises
on the Continent of Europe in which
organized religion was concerned, the
discussions were largely centered on
the place, limitations and the nature
of the Church. Each conference ap­
pointed a committee to consider the
possibility of a W orld Council.
This committee was established
and during the summer of 1938, met
in Holland, formulated a tentative
constitution and submitted it for the
consideration of all the Churches in­
volved. This tentative constitution is
provided as an important document
for reference purposes on pages 168-
171.
During the year 1938, the material
which had been submitted for study
preparatory to the Oxford and Edin­
burgh conferences, as well as the
findings and other matter which re­
sulted from the discussions, received
wide circulation and study. Local con­
ferences were held throughout the
country, the delegates who partici­
pated in the conferences in England
were given a wide hearing and many
phases of the relationship of Church
and state and of the Church and
world order were critically studied.
One result was the formulation of
a proposal by Pres. A . W . Palmer of
the Theological Seminary of the Con­
gregational Church in Chicago, for a
world conference on economics, to be
sponsored by the Churches. This pro­
posal has met with difficulties be­
cause of the development of European
crises.
Meanwhile, moves towards union
among the Protestant bodies were ac­
celerated. The Methodist Churches
approached their projected union with
their final success in the voting of
the quadrennial conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South,
in April, at Birmingham, Ala. This
large Methodist body had once before
acted favorably on the proposed union
in its general conference, but had not
been able to obtain the required ma­
jority of endorsing votes in its annual
conferences. However, in 1937, the
annual conferences passed the union
proposals by a vote of 7,650 to 1,247,
148 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
and this vote was confirmed in the
general conference by a vote of 434
to 26. The other two bodies, the
Methodist Episcopal Church and the
Methodist Protestant Church, had al­
ready fully approved the plan of
union. A small group of retired
bishops and laymen in the Southern
Church, opposed the union at the
general conference, and were report­
ed at the end of the year to be threat­
ening legal action.
The act of union was scheduled to
take place on April 26, 1939. The
name of the resulting body of seven
and three-quarter million members,
will be the Methodist Church. It will
report about 45,000 congregations
and 21,000 clergy. The merged body
will be divided into six “ jurisdic­
tions the Western (358,995 mem­
bers), the South Central (1 ,3 9 5 ,-
8 4 0 ), the Southeastern (2 ,0 9 0 ,2 0 4 ),
the Northeastern (1 ,6 1 5 ,2 8 4 ), the
North Central (1,753,514) and the
Central (2 8 4 ,7 0 5 ).
In 1937, the Triennial Convention
of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
addressed a communication to the
Presbyterian Church, U. S. A ., sug­
gesting the union of these two bodies.
The General Assembly of the Presby­
terian Church unanimously endorsed
the proposal in June, 1938, and ap­
pointed its committee on cooperation
and union to begin negotiations with
a committee appointed by the Con­
vention. These committees, meeting
in 1938, together explored the re­
semblances and the differences in
their two communions. They reached
an agreement on a protocol for unit­
ing local groups not adequately pro­
vided for by sacramental or pastoral
arrangements. The protocol is repro­
duced in the documentation section,
pages 177-179, because of its practical
and simple approach to a difficult
ecclesiastical problem. It will be re­
ferred to the Presbyterian General
Assembly in 1939, and to the Epis­
copal Convention in 1940 for action.
In 1937, another attempt to
bring closer connection between the
Southern Presbyterian Church and the
Presbyterian Church, U. S. A ., met
with defeat in the Southern Assem­
bly. A committee, however, was set
up to continue investigation of the
possibility of union. This committee,
made up of members from all synods
of the Southern Church, was found,
on organization, to be much less con­
servative than had been expected. It
resumed conversations with the com­
mittee on cooperation and union of
the larger branch, and unexpected
progress has been reported during
the year.
The union of the Evangelical Synod
and the Reformed Church in the
United States which was effected in
1934 on the basis of good will, and
without commitments of any kind,
has been progressing quietly from
stage to stage. Some of the boards of
the two former bodies have already
been merged. Others are nearing con­
solidation. The new synods have been
steadily organized. One difficulty, the
indebtedness of the two bodies and
some of their boards, has been trouble­
some, but it is believed that this
problem will be shortly solved and
final and full merger effected.
The Lutheran bodies have been
studying the differences which have
separated them into three main groups
P R O TES TA N T CHURCHES 149
which have been suspicious of fel­
lowship and cooperation. It was, how­
ever, reported recently that a formula
had been agreed upon which would
remove some doctrinal strife and per­
mit pulpit exchange and intercom­
munion. The formula (a certain view
of the Scriptures) was felt by out­
siders, however, to be a barrier to
closer relations with bodies outside
the Lutheran field.
The Federal Council met in De­
cember, 1938, and considered an
application from the Syrian A n ti­
ochian Orthodox Church for member­
ship. Its primate, the Very Rev. A n ­
tony Bashir, appeared before the
Council. His Church was unanimously
elected to membership in what had
been up to this time a purely Pro­
testant organization. This election
marked a distinct transition for the
Council. During the year the Polish
National Catholic Church became a
member of the Federation of Churches
of Chicago.
A new commission was set up by
the Federal Council, April 2, 1937,
for the study of Christian Unity. The
Rev. H. Paul Douglass was made the
secretary, with Bishop Ivan Lee Holt,
former president of the Council as its
chairman. The Commission succeeded
beyond expectation during its first
year in establishing itself as a recog­
nized center of leadership in thought
and study about Christian unity. The
Presbyterian General Assembly refer­
red two important overtures to it for
exploration and conference. Regional
conferences were held. Dr. Douglass
was elected editor of CHR ISTEN DOM ,
an established religious quarterly,
which came under the direction of
the American Sections of the Life and
W ork and Faith and Order Move­
ments (see page 22) during the
year. This scholarly review of ecu­
menical Christianity becomes the or­
gan of the unity movement.
The Holiness Movement
Some interest was aroused during
the biennium by the apparent growth
of marginal bodies with special in­
terest in emotional religious observ­
ances and in premillenial or “pente-
costal” beliefs. A fairly large number
of organized groups were discovered
especially among the Negroes in the
South, some of which were claiming
membership of five to ten thousand
followers, and others like Father Di­
vine’s movement, claiming millions.
In the statistical section forty of
these bodies are listed, most of them
of some years standing. In addition
to this, however, it is believed the
1936 religious census will discover as
many more, most of them it is true,
rather small, but many of them with
some possible survival value. A very
interesting treatment of many of
these small sects was published in
1937, “ The Small Sects in America”
(Cokesbury), by Elmer T . Clark.
The numbers, however, compared
with the bulk of membership of or­
ganized religion, are not very great,
amounting to less than two per cent
of the total.
The Northern Baptists
The Northern Baptist Convention
met at Milwaukee, W is., May 26,
1938. Three thousand delegates were
in attendance. The keynote address
of the Convention was delivered by
the retiring president, the Rev. Earl
150 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
V. Pierce, of Minneapolis. His suc­
cessor was a layman, A . J. Hudson, of
Cleveland, an attorney and an active
Baptist leader.
Complaint was voiced in the de­
nominational press that the Conven­
tion did not express itself on world
problems. “ Any stranger present
would hardly have been aware of a
smouldering international volcano, of
a tottering social order, of humanity’s
moral chaos, and its worship of
strange gods, its resort to gambling
and alcohol to escape the realities of
life and of the doom that threatens
civilization” (Missions, June, 1938).
On the other hand, the attitude of
the Convention toward the proposed
W orld Council of Churches was cor­
dial and the question of affiliation
of the Northern Baptist Convention
with it, was referred to the commit­
tee on relations with other religious
bodies for report at the next Conven­
tion.
Some curtailing of unified promo­
tional work was decided upon due to
decrease in receipts, but there were
also indications that a convention­
wide emphasis on local church work
was beginning to meet with very ap­
preciable success.
The Southern Baptists
The Southern Baptist Convention
met at Richmond, Va., May 12, 1938,
with five thousand messengers in at­
tendance. The retiring president was
the Rev. John R. Sampey, of the
Southern Baptist Seminary, Louisville,
Ky. Another seminary head, the Rev.
L. R. Scarborough, president of the
Southwestern Baptist Seminary, Fort
W orth, Tex., was elected in his place.
Very strong criticism of the Edin­
burgh Conference on Faith and Order
was voiced by the Rev. J. H. Rush-
brooke of England, the executive sec­
retary of the Baptist W orld Alliance.
He insisted that this Conference had
done harm through its pressure for
what he called, “ a mechanical union.”
Over-emphasized ecclesiasticism, in
his judgment, would smother the
simplicities of the Gospel and do harm
in widening the cleavages in Chris­
tendom.
The retiring president, Dr. Sampey,
who had attended the conferences
in England, and the Rev. George W .
Truett, discussed the ecumenical
movement and interdenominational
relations. A proposal was made for a
study of the fellowship of churches
in connection with the proposed
W orld Council of Churches, but was
rejected by an overwhelming vote.
The convention was content to offer
cooperation “ in every worthy en­
deavor for the moral and social up­
lift of humanity,” but turned from
the “ manmade union” or “ monopolies
fraught with many perils and too car­
nal to be safe.”
The Convention was greatly con­
cerned over its extensive property
losses in the sections of China occu­
pied by the Japanese.
The Disciples of Christ
About two thousand delegates at­
tended the international convention
of the Disciples of Christ, at Denver,
Colo., October 16, 1938. The Con­
vention was called to order by the
Rev. Frederick H. Kershner, president
of Butler University. The convention
elected as his successor, the Rev.
Roger T . Nooe, pastor of the Vine
Street Church, Nashville, Tenn.
P R O TES TA N T CHURCHES 151
The retiring president in his open­
ing address, discussed “The Church,
One, Holy, and Apostolic.” W hen the
proposal to adhere to the W orld
Council of Churches was introduced,
Dr. Kershner’s address with further
discussions by Henry Smith Leiper,
the Rev. Graham Frank, secretary of
the convention, and the Rev. Edgar
D eW itt Jones, president of the Fed­
eral Council of the Churches of Christ,
obtained an unanimous agreement.
This agreement was followed by the
immediate raising of the financial
support for the W orld Council asked
from the Disciples.
The convention procedures were
characterized by great unity in spite
of the fact that very diverse views
were presented from the platform.
The Congregational and Christian
Churches
The biennial council of this body
met on June 15, 1938, at Beloit,
Wis. Roger W . Babson retired from
the moderatorship and was succeeded
by the Rev. Oscar E. Maurer, pastor
of the Center Church, New Haven,
Conn.
The Rev. Douglas Horton, of Chi­
cago, became the successor to the
Rev. Charles E. Burton, retiring sec­
retary of the Council of the Church.
The Council for Social Action, estab­
lished at the last assembly, was pro­
vided with a new director, Prof.
Dwight Bradley, Andover-Newton
Theological Seminary. He will be as­
sociated with the Rev. Hubert Her­
ring who will set up his office in
Washington, D. C., for the study of
the relations of church and state.
The Protestant Episcopal Church
This body will not have its con­
vention meeting until 1940. Its 1937
convention took important action in
declaring a purpose to achieve organic
union with the Presbyterian Church
in the U. S. A . On October 28, its
commission, consisting of Bishop Ed­
ward L. Parsons, Dr. Howard Chand­
ler Robbins, and Dr. Francis J. Blood-
good met with the representatives of
the General Assembly to begin nego­
tiations.
During the year the Rt. Rev. Henry
St. George Tucker, Bishop of V ir­
ginia, was made president of the
National Council, and presiding bishop
of the Church. The staff of the Na­
tional Council was adjusted during
the year. The Rev. Charles Wildred
Sheerin was made second vice pres­
ident in charge of promotional work
and he announced the establishment
of a department of parochial aid in
charge of W illiam L. Richards,— a
bureau of secular and religious press
relations in charge of the Rev. John
W . Irwin and a division of radio and
visual education in charge of the
Rev. G. Warfield Hobbs.
The United Lutheran Church
This body met at Baltimore, Md.,
October 5, 1938. The Rev. Frederick
H. Knubel was re-elected president.
He has served in this office since the
merging of the several bodies which
formed the United Church twenty
years ago. An effort was made to
establish the episcopal office in the
United Lutheran Church (familiar
enough in the Swedish Lutheran
body) but it was defeated.
The right of women to sit at con­
ventions of the Church and its synods
152 YEARBOOK OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
and the right to serve on boards and
committees was upheld on scriptural
and constitutional grounds by a com­
mission. The proposal to cooperate in
the establishment of a W orld Coun­
cil of Churches received tentative ap­
proval pending the adoption of a final
form of constitution.
Great interest was shown as al­
ways, in the proposals to bring the
separated groups of Lutherans into
cooperation and unity. The United
Lutheran Church has always taken
the initiative in this work, but ex­
pressed itself as desirous of having
approaches made by other groups.
The American Lutheran Conference
This body held its biennial con­
vention at Racine, W is., on Decem­
ber 9, 1938. It was called to order
by the retiring president, the Rev.
C. W . Cullixson. As his successor, the
Rev. E. E. Ryden, of Rock Island,
III., editor of the LU TH ER A N C O M ­
P A N IO N , was elected.
This body is composed of five sy­
nodical bodies which are predomin­
antly Scandinavian and hold a doc­
trinal position midway between the
United Church and the Synodical
Conference whose largest group is
the very conservative Missouri Sy­
nod.
The American Conference ap­
pointed a commission to study a clos­
er unity with the more liberal United
Church and with the Synodical Con­
ference.
The Presbyterian Church, U. S. A.
This, the largest body of Presby­
terians in the world, met in Philadel­
phia, May 26, 1938. The General
Assembly observed its 150th anni­
versary. About 10,000 visitors were
present. The retiring moderator, the
Rev. William Hiram Foulkes, preached
the opening sermon. The Rev. Charles
W . Welch, pastor of the Fourth Ave­
nue Presbyterian Church, Louisville,
Ky., was elected moderator. There
were a number of candidates for this
office, but a rousing appeal for the
election of a Southerner to promote
union with the Southern Presbyterian
Church, brought an overwhelming
vote for Dr. Welch.
Many notable public meetings
were arranged. One of them, a mas­
sive reproduction of the session of
the First Assembly, another an ob­
servance of the Wesley anniversary,
drew enormous audiences. The Board
of Foreign Missions observed its
100th anniversary during the year. A
fund of half a million dollars was con­
tributed by the churches for the res­
toration of some of its depression-af­
fected work. Robert E. Speer, for
many years its senior secretary, re­
tired from active service. The greatly
respected stated clerk of the Assem­
bly, the Rev. Lewis Seymour Mudge,
also retired from active service, be­
coming emeritus stated clerk. As suc­
cessor in this powerful office in the
Presbyterian Church, the Rev. W il­
liam Barrow Pugh of Chester, Pa.,
was unanimously elected.
The Assembly unanimously ap­
proved the proposal submitted by the
Convention of the Protestant Episco­
pal Church in 1937, proposing nego­
tiations looking toward an organic
union.
The Methodists
Of the three Methodist bodies
which have been gradually working
toward union, only the Methodist
R O M AN C A TH O L IC CH URCH 153
Episcopal Church, South, had a quad­
rennial conference during 1938. This
was an important meeting, however,
because from it was expected the
last decision which would make the
proposed Methodist Church possible.
The conference met at Birmingham,
Ala., April 28, 1938, and ratified the
merger by a decisive vote. The judicial
council of the Church took a number
of technical legal objections to the
merger under consideration, but pre­
sented a unanimous opinion concern­
ing the legality of the proposed plan.
This cleared the way for action and
the last required decision was regis­
tered.
It was necessary for the conference
before its dissolution to elect seven
bishops preparatory to setting up the
new Methodist Church. The follow­
ing were chosen:
Ivan Lee Holt, of St. Louis
William Walter Peele, of the W est­
ern North Carolina Conference
Clare Purcell, of Gadsden, Ala.
Charles C. Selecman, of Southern
Methodist University, Dallas, Tex.
John Lloyd Decell, of Jackson, Miss.
W illiam C. Martin, of Dallas, Texas
W illiam T . Watkins, of the School of
Theology of Emory University, A t­
lanta, Ga.
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FIELD
Catholic Events
Perhaps the most significant Cath­
olic event of the year in the United
States was the proclamation by the
American Hierarchy of a “ Catholic
crusade” for “ true Christian democ­
racy,” calling forth the full resources
of the Church in this country to the
preservation of free American insti­
tutions and the building of a better
social order. The call to this crusade
followed the inauguration by the
Catholic University of America of its
golden jubilee, at the convocation of
which a message was read from Pope
Pius XI calling upon the Bishops of
this country to “ evolve a constructive
program of social action, fitted in its
details to the local needs, which will
command the admiration and accept­
ance of all right-thinking men.”
The beatification of Mother Fran­
ces Xavier Cabrini at the Vatican on
November 14, marked the first time
that an American citizen has been
raised to the altars of the Church.
His Eminence George Cardinal M un­
delein, Archbishop of Chicago, who
officiated at Mother Cabrini’s funeral
in Chicago, also officiated at the be­
atification ceremonies. The death of
His Eminence Patrick Cardinal Hayes,
Archbishop of New York, evoked ex­
pressions of regret throughout the
world, indicating that the Cardinal
was widely esteemed as a great reli­
gious leader.
In New Orleans, La., the Eighth
National Eucharistic Congress was a
significant demonstration of faith,
with more than 100,000 persons tak­
ing part in the great procession in
honor of the Blessed Sacrament. Re­
vision of the Douay-Rheims version
of the New Testament was completed
during the year and placed in the
hands of the Editorial Board of the
Catholic Biblical Association of
America. Other outstanding events of
the year were the Fourth National
Ï5 4 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
Catechetical Congress of the Confra­
ternity of Christian Doctrine, with
17,000 delegates attending; the N a­
tional Conference of Catholic Chari­
ties, at which the work of the Church
in the fields of charity and social and
economic welfare was discussed; and
the 18th annual convention of the
National Council of Catholic Women
in Biloxi, Miss., with 300 delegates
attending.
The National Catholic Welfare
Conference
The annual meeting of the Am er­
ican Bishops was held at the Catho­
lic University of America in Novem­
ber. Reports of expanding activity in
the various fields embraced by the
departments and bureaus of the Na­
tional Catholic Welfare Conference
and their affiliated organizations were
considered. The Bishops addressed
themselves in a spirit of paternal so­
licitude to both Catholics and non-
Catholics, urging all to study care­
fully the great social encyclicals of
Pope Pius XI and Pope Leo X III and
to work for the application of their
principles in the life of today. They
urged “ the universal application of
the Perfect Law of Liberty prescribed
by our Divine Savior: that we know
and love Cod above all things and
our neighbor as ourselves,” as the
fundamental remedy for the disordered
conditions that stand as a menace to
domestic peace and concord among
nations.
The Bishops gave attention to the
plight of the increasing numbers of
Catholic refugees from Germany,
Austria and other countries. A n ti-
Semitism, pan-Cermanism and other
forms of ultra-nationalism were con­
demned as directly opposed to the
true Brotherhood of Man and de­
structive of the “ very basis of Cath­
olic ideology.” An Episcopal Commit­
tee on Youth was empowered to set
up a National Catholic Youth Coun­
cil to aid in the expansion and coor­
dination of Catholic activities for
youth throughout the nation. Steps
were taken to develop the campaign
against salacious literature on a na­
tional scale, a special committee be­
ing appointed to consider the matter.
The Catholic Press was asked to pub­
lish complete lists of the Legion of
Decency. Plans were considered to
render more widespread and effec­
tive the work of religious instruction
by holding provincial catechetical con­
gresses throughout the year, and the
Bishops lent their efforts to further
the work of the Bureau of Informa­
tion, a new informational service
founded during the year, national in
scope and designed to disseminate
correctional and informative inform­
ation concerning Catholic doctrine,
teaching, and practices.
The Confraternity of Christian
Doctrine, which functions under the
Executive Department of the Na­
tional Catholic Welfare Conference,
reported that 89 archdioceses and
dioceses now have an official director
of the Confraternity. The Bureau of
Immigration of the Conference re­
ported on its work during the year as
follows: “ Immigrants and emigrants
assisted at the ports, 14,826; inter­
views in behalf of migrants and other
aliens, 103,753; communications,
56,289; assistance to clergy, Relig­
ious, candidates, etc., 2,321 ; assisted
with naturalization, 1048.”
R O M A N C A TH O L IC C H U R C H 155
Education
The Department of Education of
the Conference furnished statistical
material to the President’s Advisory
Committee on Education concerning
the growth of Catholic schools, teach­
er training, estimates of expenditures
for education, and library facilities.
Of $21,750,000 allocated from fed­
eral funds to finance the student aid
program of the National Youth A d­
ministration for 1938-39, it was re­
ported that a total of 5,978 stu­
dents in 168 Catholic colleges and
universities received aid amounting
to $807,125. Some loss in enroll­
ment in elementary schools was at­
tributed to the nation-wide decrease
in the birth rate noted for the past
few years. Increases were reported in
the enrollment at Catholic colleges,
universities and high schools. Enroll­
ments in seminaries, teachers col­
leges and normal schools, it was re­
ported, remained about the same as
last year.
The Press
The Press Department of the Con­
ference reported that the Catholic
newspaper press circulation in the
United States has increased from 1,-
602,369 in 1925 to 2,631,807 in
1938, a gain of more than 60 per
cent in 13 years. These figures indi­
cate that one Catholic paper is being
circulated for every 1.98 Catholic
families in the country. Three new
diocesan newspapers and four maga­
zines were founded during the year,
and none discontinued publication. It
was reported that the National Cath­
olic Welfare Conference News Serv­
ice is now serving publications in 23
countries, besides Alaska and Hawaii.
Social Action
The Social Action Department of
the Conference reported the establish­
ment of Social Action Committees of
priests in every diocese, the holding of
local sessions of the Catholic Confer­
ence on Industrial Problems and the
calling of Diocesan Social Action Con­
ferences. This program was an out­
growth of the National Catholic So­
cial Action Conference held in M il­
waukee in May, considered the great­
est meeting on Catholic Social teach­
ing that has ever been held in the
United States. Four regional meet­
ings of the Catholic Conference on
Industrial Problems were held, and
schools of Social Action for the Clergy
and an Institute on Industry were or­
ganized.
The Rural Life Bureau of the De­
partment reported that there are now
66 directors of Diocesan Rural Life
Bureaus. The Family Life Section re­
ported continuing efforts to counter­
act a rising tide of family destruc­
tion, and Catholic Action programs
for seminaries, colleges, universities
and Newman Clubs.
Lay Organizations
The Department of Lay Organiza­
tions of the Conference, composed of
the National Council of Catholic Men
and the National Council of Catholic
Women, reported expanding activities.
There are now 1,216 organizations af­
filiated with the National Council of
Catholic Men. The Catholic Hour, a
radio program sponsored by the Coun­
cil, “soared to new heights both in
coverage and listener interests” . The
number of cooperating stations dur­
ing the month of May was 75 in 40
States, the District of Columbia, and
156 YEARBOO K OF A M E R IC A N CHUROHES
Hawaii, and included two globe-circ­
ling short-wave stations. Since the in­
ception of the Hour a total of 8 2 8 ,-
500 pamphlets containing 3,761,200
of these radio addresses have been
distributed. The National Council of
Catholic Women reported that dioces­
an councils have been organized in
60 dioceses. There are 2,750 local
organizations affiliated with the
N. C. C. W ., an increase of 150 over
1937. There are 42 dioceses in which
the Council has not yet been organ­
ized. There are 17 national Catholic
organizations affiliated with the Coun­
cil. Fifty-five students were enrolled
during the year in the National Cath­
olic School of Social Service. The Na­
tional Committee on Youth of the
Council sponsored a series of broad­
casts over a national network. The
Council also participated in interna­
tional affairs of interest to women
through membership in the Interna­
tional Union of Catholic W omen’s
Leagues.
Legislation
The Legal Department of the Con­
ference reported on two important
projects which will come before the
present Congress: the report of the
President’s Advisory Committee on
Education suggesting vastly increased
federal appropriations for education
through grants in aid to the States,
and the report of the Interdepart­
mental Committee to Coordinate
Health and Welfare Activities. “These
Proposals,” the report of the De­
partment states, “ affect Catholic
interests in the fields of education
and charity.” Legislatures of Kan­
sas, New Hampshire and Rhode Island
enacted laws providing for the trans­
portation of private and parochial
school children. In New York a con­
stitutional amendment providing for
such transportation and for public
health service in Catholic schools was
adopted by the electorate.
Statistics
Contributions to the Society for the
Propagation of the Faith increased
over the previous year, and the Cath­
olic Church Extension Society report­
ed the building or repairing of 75
mission chapels and parish buildings.
The Catholic population of the coun­
try was placed at 21,451,460. The
creation of the new Diocese of Lan­
sing, Mich., brought the number of
Sees in continental United States up
to 112, of which 19 are Archdioceses
and 93 Dioceses. A total of 2,542,500
students were enrolled in 10,310
Catholic schools in the United States
in September, 1938. There were 3 9 ,-
825 teachers in the Catholic school
system. The number of elementary
school pupils was put at 2,075,000
in 7,929 separate elementary insti­
tutions. The 1,984 Catholic high
schools were estimated to have a to­
tal enrollment of some 30,000. Tw en­
ty-three universities, 56 colleges and
105 colleges for women under Cath­
olic control were attended by 140,-
000 students. Some 10,500 students
were enrolled in 41 diocesan teachers
colleges and normal schools, while
there were 8,000 students in 93
major seminaries, and 9,000 in pre­
paratory seminaries.
The Hierarchy
In addition to Cardinal Hayes,
three other members of the Ameri­
can Hierarchy died in 1938. Bishop
Thomas J. O ’Reilly of Scranton died
T H E JEW ISH C O M M U N ITY 157
on March 25; Bishop Joseph J. Rice
of Burlington, V t., on March 31 ; and
Bishop Thomas F. Lillis of Kansas
City, Mo., died on December 29.
Bishops Francis J. Tief of Con­
cordia and Timothy Corbett of
Crookston, Minn., resigned their Sees
because of ill health.
Archbishops John J. Cantwell of
Los Angeles, John A. Floersh of Louis­
ville and Thomas J. Walsh of New­
ark received the Pallium of 1938.
Bishop Stephen J. Donahue, Auxiliary
to Cardinal Hayes, was named Adm in­
istrator of the Archdiocese of New
York following the Cardinal’s death.
Bishop Eugene J. McCuinness, who
had been consecrated toward the close
of 1937, was installed as Bishop of
Raleigh, and Bishop Thomas H. M c­
Laughlin, Auxiliary Bishop of N ew ­
ark, was installed as the first Bishop
of Paterson. Bishops Francis R. Cot­
ton of Owensboro, Ky., William F.
Murphy of Saginaw, Bartholomew J.
Eustace of Camden, Matthew F.
Brady of Burlington, Frank A. Thill
of Concordia, Kans., John H. Peschges
of Crookston, Minn., Stephen J. W o z -
nicki, Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit, and
William A . Griffin, Auxiliary Bishop
of Newark, were consecrated during
1938.
During the year Pope Pius X I de­
livered more than 12 discourses against
the persecution of Jews, racism and
exaggerated nationalism, declaring
these things to be “a real maledic­
tion.” The Pontiff also rebuked those
who sought to injure Catholic Action,
declaring that Catholic Action is
Catholic life and that it has no politi­
cal aims or content. W hen world war
seemed imminent in September, the
Pontiff addressed a message to the
world, asking all to join him in prayers
for peace and offering his life to that
end. The Bishops of the United States
and prominent Catholic priests and
laymen also frequently denounced
persecution of Jews and Christians and
warned against subversive propagan­
da. The serious illness of Pope Pius
X I, who was stricken again in No­
vember but recovered with amazing
rapidity, evoked profound repercus­
sions throughout the world.
Eucharistic Congresses
The International Eucharistic Con­
gress at Budapest, Hungary, was a
magnificent demonstration of relig­
ious fervor, drawing many thousands
of pilgrims from all over the world.
Other great demonstrations of faith
in the form of Eucharistic congresses
took place in Canada, France, India,
Australia, New Zealand and else­
where.
THE JEWISH FIELD
Jewish Communal Life
Unity in community organization,
the inroads of secularization, the role
of religion in the formulation of an
adequate program of social justice,
the importance of the reestablish­
ment of the synagogue to its former
preeminent position in the general
affairs of the community, and the in-
dispensability of Judaism as a reli­
gion in preserving the Jewish group—
these were the more important sub­
jects stressed in the activities of the
Jewish religious bodies during the
158 YEARBOOK OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
year 1937 and 1938. This reempha­
sis on the religious, as opposed to
secular forces, became the predomin­
ant theme in the discussions at the
conventions of the religious organiz­
ations of Judaism during 1939. In
fact, 1938 may be characterized in
the religious field by its oft-repeated
plea for the “primacy of the syna­
gogue.”
To a great extent, the religious
thought of the Jewish community is
expressed in the pronouncements of
the congregational and rabbinical or­
ganizations of the three so-called
“ wings” of Judaism in America—
the Orthodox, the Conservative, and
the Reform. A t their meetings dur­
ing 1937, these organizations dis­
cussed the situations confronting
Jews in various countries, questions
of congregational policy, ritual and
Jewish law, and the attitude of re­
ligion reform programs. Among the
most notable of the actions taken or
resolutions adopted were: (1 ) the
endorsement of the Rabbinical Assem­
bly of the Jewish Theological Semin­
ary of America (Conservative) of
“ the general spirit of the New Deal”
and legislation for complete neutrality
of the United States in the event of
war; (2 ) the declaration of the
W om en’s League of the United Syn­
agogue of America (Conservative)
that the great need of the Jewish
community of America was a well de­
fined program of Jewish education
and that the problem was peculiarly
that of Jewish women; (3 ) the state­
ment at the convention of the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations
(Reform) that improvements in the
service of the synagogue, especially in
the matter of homiletics, were urgent­
ly needed; (4 ) the adoption by the
Central Conference of American Rab­
bis (Reform) of a program for mar­
riage reform, including uniform mar­
riage laws in all states, and the sug­
gestion at the meeting of the Con­
ference that an appeal be made to
Catholics and Protestants to join with
Jews in a cooperative alliance of re­
ligious forces in the struggle to save
democracy.
The United Synagogue of America
held its silver jubilee convention in
Chicago on May 6 -10, 1938. The
convention was addressed by Louis
J. Moss, its president, who advo­
cated making religion a daily part of
the life of the ordinary person;
Dean Charles W . Gilkey of Rockefel­
ler Memorial Chapel, University of
Chicago, who declared that the “ will
of Cod” was the “ only final loyalty”
that can save our life from futility
and failure; and Rabbi Solomon
Goldman, who deplored the secular­
ization of American Jewry and de­
clared the synagogue was of prime
importance in furnishing leaders for
Jewish secular institutions. Resolu­
tions were adopted calling upon the
great religions of the world to unite
in combatting the growth of secular­
ism and the anti-religious attitude
and in' maintaining “ the spiritual and
divine basis of human life” ; reaffirm­
ing its determination “ to stand for
and spread the great traditional
methods” of Judaism; and calling
upon all “ men of good will” to op­
pose the persecution of the Jews.
The Union of Orthodox Jewish
Congregations held its fortieth an­
nual convention in New York City
T H E JEW ISH C O M M U N ITY 159
on May 14, 1938. During it, Mr.
William Weiss, announced that the
Union had formulated a million-dol­
lar program for Jewish education in
America, coordinating religious edu­
cation under the auspices ot the Na­
tional Orthodox Board of Education.
The fund is to be raised in one-dollar
gifts, and will provide for the sup­
port of the Yeshiva College of New
York, the Chicago Theological Sem­
inary, and other schools of higher
Jewish learning, as well as for relig­
ious schools and Talmud Torahs at­
tended by children. He announced
also that a special $25,000 project
would provide a subsidy of $500 to
each of 50 rural communities through­
out the country to help defray the cost
of maintaining Hebrew school teach­
ers in districts in which Jewish groups
are too small to maintain such teach­
ers unaided.
The Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, at a meeting of its
Executive Board in Atlantic City on
June 19, 1938, approved the organi­
zation of a national committee on
public information on Jews and Juda­
ism to bring about widespread dis­
tribution among non-Jews of popu­
lar studies in Judaism.
The Central Conference of Am er­
ican Rabbis held its 49th annual
meeting in Atlantic City on June 21,
1938. Among the chief topics dis­
cussed were the growing movement
for unity and ways for making the
synagogue a vital factor in Jewish
secular life. In his presidential address,
Rabbi Max C. Currick, of Erie, Pa.
urged the uniting of Reform, Ortho­
dox and Conservative Jews in a
strengthened Synagogue Council, and
recommended that local synagogue
councils be organized in every com­
munity to stimulate and direct Jew­
ish religious life. In several addresses
on the place and work of the syna­
gogue, Rabbi Samuel W ohl of Cin­
cinnati advocated establishment of
“ preaching missions“ — teams of two
or three rabbis to visit communities
and preach Jewish religious values;
Rev. David Lefkowitz of Dallas urged
a union of the various groups in the
synagogue against their common en­
emy, secularism and materialism. The
Conference also adopted resolutions
relating to social justice, family wel­
fare, and refugees.
The Rabbinical Assembly of Am er­
ica, at its 38th annual convention in
Tannersville, N. Y . on June 27, 1938,
advocated the inclusion of representa­
tives of organized religious life in the
newly organized General Jewish
Council (consisting of the American
Jewish Committee, American Jew­
ish Congress, B’nai B’rith, and Jew­
ish Labor Com m ittee). Suggestions
were also made for expanding the
educational work of the synagogue
and the educational functions of the
Jewish Theological Seminary of
America. The Seminary was requested
to extend its rabbinical course to a
five year term, providing for an extra
year for apprenticeship with an ac­
tual congregation.
Jewish Education
In the field of Jewish education
the most important event in 1937
was the celebration of the semi-cen­
tennial of the Jewish Theological
Seminary ot America, which began in
December, 1936 and was concluded
with the fiftieth annual convocation
160 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
on June 6, 1937. The celebration
took the form of educational pro­
grams which were participated in by
distinguished publicists and scholars,
including Cov. Herbert H. Lehman of
New York, Presidents Nicholas M ur­
ray Butler of Columbia University and
Henry Sloane Coffin of the Union
Theological Seminary, and James
Bryant Conant of Harvard University.
The celebration also included a Con­
ference on Jewish Affairs and Insti­
tutes of Bible Study and Post Biblical
Literature.
The Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theo­
logical Seminary, the largest Ortho­
dox Jewish theological school in the
world, also celebrated its 50th anni­
versary in 1937.
Notable events in the field of
Jewish education during 1938 includ­
ed the enlargement of extension ac­
tivities of the Jewish Theological
Seminary aimed at spreading among
the public a better knowledge of the
results of recent scholarly research;
the extension of Jewish educational
facilities to Jewish students in col­
lege campuses through the opening
of a unit of the B’nai B’rith Hillel
Foundations at the University of In­
diana; the establishment of a Jew ­
ish Culture Foundation at New York
University; and the publication of a
number of notable books in the fields
of Jewish scholarship and of modern
Jewish problems.
A t the Annual Meeting of the
Jewish Education Association on May
8, Harry J. Liebovitz, president, an­
nounced an increase in registration
during the preceding year by about
one thousand pupils. It was also an­
nounced that $2,000,000 were spent
annually by New York parents for
the Jewish education of their chil­
dren, and that the Association was
doing everything possible to improve
the standards of teaching in the
schools.
In September, the American Jew ­
ish Committee issued the first num­
ber of a bi-monthly publication, the
CO N TEM PO R A R Y JEW ISH RECORD,
intended to be a repository for docu­
ments, reviews, and chronicles on con­
temporary affairs of interest to Jews.
Welfare Organizations
During the two-year period under
review the larger social welfare agenc­
ies of the Jewish community were
extremely active.
On January 11, 1937, the Na­
tional Council of Jewish Women
marked its 44th anniversary. The
Council announced the undertaking
of an enlarged naturalization and
Americanization program aimed par­
ticularly at integrating recent arrivals
(German refugees with American
life).
The results of an unusually inter­
esting project in statistical research,
pursued under the auspices of the
B’nai B’rith, were made public in the
spring of 1937. Under the direction
of Rabbi Lee J. Levinger, the first
complete survey of the number and
scholastic activities of Jewish stu­
dents in the colleges and universities
of the United States had been under­
taken. A total of 1,319 institutions,
9 0 % of the total, were covered by
the inquiry. It disclosed that of an
aggregate registration in 1935-36, of
1.1 50,000 students, 105,000 or
9.1 % were Jews.
The work of the Jewish Welfare
T H E JEW IS H C O M M U N IT Y 161
Board in war and peace, in promoting
forces making for unity and harmony
among American Jews was described,
on April 25, 1937, at the twentieth
anniversary meeting of the organiza­
tion, in New York City. The confer­
ences were attended by delegates
from 317 Y . M . H. A .’s, Y . W . H. A .’s
and Jewish community centers, as well
as members of directing boards, local
chairmen, and committee members
who participated in its activities dur­
ing the W ar. Judge Irving Lehman, in
his presidential report, revealed that
the Jewish community centers own
233 buildings having an estimated
value of $35,000,000 as compared
with 138 buildings in 1928, and 70
in 1921. Membership in constituent
societies is estimated at 370,000, as
compared with 275,000 in 1928, and
100,000 in 1921. Some $4,600,000
is spent annually on operating the
centers. A t the annual meeting of its
National Council on May 1, 1938, the
Board adopted resolutions calling for
additional funds from local fund-rais­
ing agencies, advocating group insur­
ance and pension funds for employees
of Y ’s and Centers, establishing voca­
tional guidance and employment bu­
reaus for their members and extend­
ing health education programs in con­
nection with physical education. Dr.
Cyrus Adler, Chairman of the Arm y
and Navy Committee, reported that
$40,478 was spent by the Board dur­
ing the year for religious work in the
Arm y, Navy, and C. C. C. camps.
The Council of Jewish Federations
and Welfare Funds, in a statement
published in February, 1938, reported
that during 1936, the Jews of Am eri­
ca, through 125 Federations and
Welfare Funds, had contributed $ 1 5 ,-
169,803 for relief and reconstruction
activities. Almost three-quarters of it
went for local philanthropies, and a
little less than 1 5 % for activities out­
side the communities.
The National Council of Jewish
Women held its 15th biennial con­
vention in Pittsburgh, Pa. on Janu­
ary 23-28, 1938. The principal reso­
lution adopted by the convention
called for revision of the United
States’ neutrality policy through leg­
islation imposing embargoes on bellig­
erent nations that evade the present
neutrality act by fighting “ undeclar­
ed” wars. The convention adopted also
a resolution pledging the Council’s
200 sections throughout the country
tc raise $250,000 over a three-year
period to finance the work of German
Jewish Children’s Aid committees.
Vocational problems and public re­
lief policies were outstanding among
the many questions discussed at the
39th annual meeting of the National
Conference of Jewish Welfare, held
in Washington, May 27-31, 1938,
under the presidency of Harry Green-
stein, executive director of the As­
sociated Jewish Charities of Balti­
more. In 1938 studies in the field of
vocational adjustment and vocational
guidance for Jewish youth were pub­
lished by the newly organized B’nai
B’rith Vocational Service, the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations
(Commission of Jewish Education)
and the Conference on Jewish Rela­
tions. A significant step in the direc­
tion of coordination of efforts in this
field was the Conference on Voca­
tional Adjustment Problems and Pro­
grams, which was held on May 13-14,
162 YEARBOOK OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
1938, in New York under the joint
auspices of the Council of Jewish
Federations and Welfare Funds and
the Conference on Jewish Relations.
Palestine Problems
Developments in and affecting
Palestine during 1937 and 1938 were
the subject of a great deal of serious
concern and attention on the part of
the Jewish community in the United
States. Especially at a time when the
intensity of anti-Jewish persecutions
in Germany, Austria, and Eastern
Europe reached a new height and the
number of possible havens for refugees
remained pitifully meagre, American
Jews, as indeed Jews throughout the
world, followed closely the trends of
British policy vis-a-vis the Holy Land
and were quick to protest any reported
drastic modification of policy adverse­
ly affecting Jewish immigration. The
American Jewish community also fol­
lowed with considerable misgivings
the continued Arab terrorism in Pales­
tine.
The chief subject of debate and
discussion with regard to the Holy
Land was the British Government pro­
posal for the tri-partition of the
country. On July 8, 1937, the British
Royal Commission published the long-
awaited report of its investigations in
Palestine in which it recommended
the partition of the Holy Land into a
Jewish state, an Arab region to be
joined to Transjordania, and a section
to remain under British Mandate. This
proposal was received with mixed feel­
ing by American Jews, as by Jews
everywhere. The issue was widely de­
bated. The consensus of opinion ap­
peared to be opposed to the partition
plan. A poll conducted in the Spring
of 1938 by the American Bureau of
the London JEW ISH CH R O NICLE re­
vealed that out of 172 religious and
lay spokesman throughout the United
States, 86 per cent favored the reten­
tion of the Mandate and opposed
partition.
In January, 1938, the British Gov­
ernment appointed a technical com­
mission to work out, in Palestine, the
details of partition. The report of this
commission, headed by Sir John
Woodhead, was awaited with anxiety
by Jews everywhere. In October,
when the commission was formulating
its report, there were insistent rumors
that Britain was planning the aban­
donment of the Balfour Declaration.
A wave of protest by Jews and Chris­
tians swept the western world. In the
United States Jews of all opinions re­
garding the future of Palestine united
in deploring such a step, which they
regarded as especially tragic in the
face of the crisis in Europe. A dele­
gation representative of a complete
cross-section of the Jewish commun­
ity waited upon the Secretary of State
and upon the British Ambassador in
Washington. A large section of the
American press voiced the hope that
Britain would not surrender the Man­
date for Palestine. Currently, Am eri­
can Jews, together with Jews through­
out the world, are anxiously follow­
ing the round-table conferences be­
ing held in London by the British with
representatives of the Jews, the Arabs
of Palestine, and the neighboring
Arab countries.
In addition to the American reac­
tion to the partition proposal and to
the disturbances in Palestine, de­
scribed above, Zionist organizations
T H E JEW ISH C O M M U N ITY 163
carried on their regular communal ac­
tivities. Such organizations as the
Zionist Organization of America, the
Hadassah, women's Zionist group,
and the Federation of Palestine Jews
of America, were increasingly active
during the period under review. In
October, 1937, Hadassah marked the
25th anniversary of its founding at its
23rd annual convention in Atlantic
City. This convention, attended by
2500 delegates, representing more
than 300 chapters in 46 states, was
said to be the largest gathering of
Zionists ever held in the United
States.
Aid for Overseas Communities
The growing concern of American
Jews over the hardships of Jewish
communities overseas was reflected
during 1937 and 1938 not only in
increased activity on the part of the
overseas agencies but also by an in­
crease in contributions to these agen­
cies. The chief agency in this country
for the relief and rehabilitation of
Jews overseas is the American Jewish
Joint Distribution Committee. Fund­
raising activities for Palestine projects
are centered in the United Palestine
Appeal.
In February, 1937, the J. D. C.
decided upon a quota of $4,650,000
for the 1937 campaign, and the U. P.
A. a quota of $4,500,000 for the
same period. A t the close of its cam­
paign for the year the J. D. C. an­
nounced that $3,350,000 had been
pledged and the largest part of that
sum collected. Of this sum, $2,876,-
675 was allocated tor overseas relief.
In January, 1938, the U. P. A. an­
nounced that a total of $2,325,212
had been administered in 1937. In
February, 1938, the J. D. C. and the
U. P. A . concluded a fund-raising
agreement applicable in all cities
where Jewish community drives are
conducted by welfare funds that hold
membership in the Council of Jewish
Federations and Welfare Funds. The
pact provided that moneys raised by
such local welfare funds for overseas
and Palestine activities should be al­
located to the two organizations in
the proportion of 60 per cent for the
J. D. C. and 40 per cent for the
U. P. A.
The 1938 fund-raising efforts of
both the Joint Distribution Commit­
tee and the United Palestine Appeal
were launched late in January, 1938.
The J. D. C. set its national quota at
$5,100,000. Both campaigns bene­
fited by the growing realization on
the part of Jews in this country of the
greater needs abroad. The reaction to
the events in Poland, Roumania, Aus­
tria, Germany, and Palestine raised
the general standard of giving both
in number and size of contribution to
these funds. The annexation of Aus­
tria by Germany, resulting in the loss
of civil, legal and economic rights for
Austrian Jews, evoked grave concern
in the Spring of 1938 among Jews in
the United States. Prompt emergency
aid was rendered by the J. D. C. It
was revealed in May that the J. D. C.
was making available about $1,000 a
day for emergency assistance to Jews
in Vienna.
General Jewish Council
The question of closer cooperation
between, or greater coordination of
the work of, the several organizations
engaged largely or entirely in combat­
ing anti-Jewish agitation and safe-
164 YEARBOOK OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
guarding the civil and religious rights
of Jews, was the focus of attention
within the Jewish community during
1938. Following much public dis­
cussion, the four organizations most
active in this field, the American
Jewish Committee, the American
Jewish Congress, B’nai B'rith, and the
Jewish Labor Committee, organized
a General Jewish Council.
Anti-Jewish Agitation
Following the presidential election
campaign of 1936 there was a re­
cession in anti-Jewish agitation. The
year 1938, however, has again w it­
nessed a perceptible rise in such agi­
tation, marked by the resumption by
native Jew-baitors and Jew-baiting
groups of their former activities, and
the active propaganda of the German
American Bund and the wide-spread
opposition to it. These organizations
were considerably emboldened by the
new waves of anti-Jewish persecu­
tions abroad and encouraged by the
adverse economic conditions at home.
T o a great extent the agitation con­
tinued to have a political motive,
much of its content being attacks
upon the policies of the present ad­
ministration on the pretense that it
is in some way controlled by “ the
Jews.“
American Jews were concerned
during 1938 over utterances of Father
Charles E. Coughlin of Detroit, Michi­
gan, in radio addresses as well as in
his weekly publication SO CIAL JU S ­
TIC E , in which Jews were charged
with responsibility for the Russian
communist revolution and other un­
popular movements. That Father
Coughlin did not speak for the Catho­
lic Church was made clear by author­
itative declarations by Church digni­
taries. Also, Father Coughlin’s prin­
cipal charges against Jews were re­
futed by various persons and agencies;
a documented pamphlet refuting his
accusations was published by the Gen­
eral Jewish Council.
Movements for Better Understanding
As in past years, the forces of ill-
will met with more than their match
in the much more influential and re­
putable agencies working for the
maintenance of inter-group harmony
and understanding in the United
States. During the past two years the
most active agency of inter-group
good will was again the National Con­
ference of Christians and Jews. Its
efforts were amply supplemented by
pronouncements and activities of
hosts of other organizations as well
as by innumerable individual Am eri­
cans. The Conference was active in
promoting seminars and institutes for
the discussion of better group rela­
tions between Protestants, Catholics,
and Jews. The Conference also or­
ganized “ round tables” of represen­
tatives of the three faiths in a num­
ber of cities, and good will “ pilgrim­
ages” of teams each consisting of a
Protestant minister, a Catholic priest,
and a rabbi, which made tours
throughout the country. During 1938,
the double celebration of Brother­
hood Day and the tenth anniversary
of the National Conference on Feb­
ruary 22, was one of the most sig­

the medium of local meetings, the
press and the radio, penetrated into
the remotest sections of the country.

A t the semi-annual meeting, on
May 30, 1938, the executive com­
mittee authorized Dr. Arthur H.
Compton, who had been elected to
succeed the late Newton D. Baker
as Protestant co-chairman of the
Conference, to proceed with a four-
year nation-wide survey, beginning
with the academic year 1938-1939,
on the influence of a college educa­
tion on the religious and racial atti­
tudes of American students.
The years 1937 and 1938, especi­
ally the latter, were marked by an
extraordinary number of good will
declarations by Christian organizations
and leaders, in addition to protests by
Christian leaders and organizations
against persecutions in certain Euro­
pean countries. Undoubtedly the most
significant trend to be discerned in
these statements was the realization
that anti-Semitism is but a forerunner
of anti-Christianity and that it be­
hooves the churches of America firmly
to oppose anti-Semitism and other
forms of religious prejudice for the
preservation of all religion.

Assembly or the Central Com­
mittee, unless one ha'f of the
total membership is present.
Art. 6. A P P O IN TM E N T OF C O M ­
MISSIONS. The W orld Council
shall discharge part of its func­
tions by the appointment of
Commissions. These shall be
established under the authority
of the Assembly, whether they
be actually nominated by the
Assembly or by the Central Com­
mittee acting under its instruc­
tions. The Commissions shall,
between meetings of the A s-
sèmbly, report annually to the
Central Committee which shall
exercise general supervision over
them. The Commissions may add
to their membership clerical and
lay persons approved for the
purpose by the Central Commit­
tee. In particular the Assembly
shall make provision by means
of appropriate Commissions for
D O C U M E N TA TIO N 171
carrying the activities of Faith
and Order and of Life and W ork.
There shall be a Faith and O r­

the world which accept our Lord Jesus
Christ as Cod and Saviour” ; <c) the
work of the Commission on Faith and
Order shall be carried on under the

terest to all the Churches and per­
taining to Faith and Order, the Coun­
cil shall always proceed in accordance
with the basis on which this Confer­
ence on Faith and Order was called
and is being conducted: (e) the World
Council shall consist of official rep­
resentatives of the Churches partici­
pating; (f) any Council formed be­
fore the first meeting of the General
Assembly shall be called Provisional,
and the Assembly, representing all the
Churches, shall have complete free­

174 YEARBOOK OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
no ultimate authority but Cod; his
loyalty to the State is part of his
loyalty to Cod, and must never usurp
the place of that primary and only
absolute loyalty.
The Church has duties laid upon
it by Cod, which at all costs it must
perform, among which the chief is to
proclaim the W ord of Cod and to
make disciples, and to order its own
life in the power of the Spirit dwel­
ling in it. Because this is its duty it
must do it, whether or not the State
consents; and the State on its side
should recognize the duty and assure
full liberty for its performance. The
Church can claim such liberty for it­
self only as it is also concerned for
the rights and liberties of others.
In the economic sphere the first
duty of the Church is to insist that
economic activities, like very other
department of human life, stand un­
der the judgment of Christ. The ex­
istence of economic classes presents
a barrier to human fellowship which
cannot be tolerated by the Christian
conscience. Indefensible inequalities
of opportunity in regard to educa­
tion, leisure, and health continue to
prevail. The ordering of economic life
has tended to enhance acquisitiveness
and to set up a false standard of eco­
nomic and social success. The only
forms of employment open to many
men and women, or the fact that none
is open, prevent them from finding
a sense of Christian vocation in their
daily life.
W e are witnessing new movements
which have arisen in reaction to these
evils but which combine with their
struggle for social justice the repudi­
ation of all religious faith. Aware of
the reality of sin, the Church knows
that no change in the outward order­
ing of life can of itself eradicate social
evil. The Church therefore cannot sur­
render to the Utopian expectations of
these movements and their Godless­
ness it must unequivocally reject; but
in doing so it must recognize that
Christians in their blindness to the
challenging evils of the economic or­
der have been partly responsible for
the anti-religious character of these
movements.
Christians have a double duty—
both to bear witness to their faith
within the existing economic order
and also to test all economic institu­
tions in the light of their understand­
ing of God’s will. The forces of evil
against which Christians have to con­
tend are found not only in the hearts
of men as individuals, but have en­
tered into and affected the structure
of society, and there also must be
combatted. The responsibility of the
Church is to insist on the true rela­
tionship of spiritual and economic
goods. Man cannot live without bread,
and man cannot live by bread alone.
Our human wealth consists in fel­
lowship with God and in Him with
our brethren. To this fellowship the
whole economic order must be made
subservient.
The questions which have mainly
engaged the attention of the Confer­
ence are questions that can be effec­
tively dealt with, in practice, only by
the laity. Those who are responsible
for the daily conduct of industry, ad­
ministration, and public life must
discover for themselves what is the
right decision in an endless variety of
concrete situations. If they are to
D O C U M E N TA TIO N 175
receive the help they need in making
responsible Christian decisions new
types of ministry will have to be de­
veloped by the Church.
The fulfilment of the tasks to which
the Church is called today lies largely
in the hands of youth. Many loud
voices are calling on young people to
give themselves to political and social
ideals, and it is often hard for them
to hear the voice of Jesus Christ who
calls them to be servants of the eter­
nal Kingdom. Yet many of the younger
generation, often in spite of ridicule
and sometimes of persecution, are
turning to Him, and individually as
well as in Christian youth movements
devote themselves to the renewal of
the life of the Churches and to mak­
ing known the Good News of Christ
by word and action. W e rejoice in
their brave witness.
In the education of youth the
Church has a twofold task. First, it
must be eager to secure for every
citizen the fullest possible opportun­
ity for the development of the gifts
that God has bestowed upon him. In
particular, the Church must condemn
inequality of educational opportunity
as a main obstacle to fullness of fel­
lowship in the life of the community.
W hile the Church is thus con­
cerned with all education it has, also,
a special responsibility to realize its
own understanding of the meaning
and end of education in the relation
of life to God. In education, as else­
where, if God is not recognized, He
is ignored. The Church must claim
the liberty to give a Christian educa­
tion to its own children. It is in the
field of education that the conflict
between Christian faith and non-
Christian conceptions of the ends of
life, between the Church and an all-
embracing community life which
claims to be the source and goal of
every human activity, is in many parts
of the world most acute. In this con­
flict all is at stake, and the Church
must gird itself for the struggle.
As we look to the future it is our
hope and prayer that the Spirit of God
may cause new life to break forth
spontaneously in a multitude of dif­
ferent centres, and that there may
come into being a large number of
“ cells” of Christian men and women
associated in small groups for the
discovery of fresh ways in which they
may serve God and their fellow-men.
W e have deeply felt the absence
from our fellowship of the Churches
that have not been represented at
the Conference. Our hearts are filled
with anguish as we remember the
suffering of the Church in Russia. Our
sympathy and gratitude go cut to our
Christian brethren in Germany; we
are moved to a more living trust by
their steadfast witness to Christ and
we pray that we may be given grace
to bear the same clear witness to the
Lord.
W e have much to encourage us
since the Conference at Stockholm
twelve years ago. The sense of the
unity of the Church in all the world
grows stronger every year. W e trust
that this cause will be yet more fully
served by the W orld Council of
Churches, proposals for which have
been considered by the Conference
and commended to the Churches.
W e have tried during these days
at Oxford to look without illusion at
the chaos and disintegration of the
176 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
world, the injustices of the social or­
der and the menace and horror of war.
The world is anxious and bewildered
and full of pain and fear. W e are
troubled yet we do not despair. Our
hope is anchored in the living God.
In Christ, and in the union of man
with Cod and of man with man, which
He creates, life even in the face of
all these evils has a meaning. In His
AFFIRMATION FROM THE
(August,
This Conference, under the aus­
pices of the W orld Conference of
Faith and Order, met at Edinburgh,
Scotland, in the summer of 1937.
Delegates from one hundred and
twenty-two Christian communions in
forty-three countries were present.
The four hundred and fourteen dele­
gates united on the following A FFIR ­
M A TIO N OF U N IT Y , nemine con-
tradicente:
“ W e are one in faith in our Lord
Jesus Christ, the incarnate W ord of
God. W e are one in allegiance to Him
as Head of the Church, and as King
of Kings and Lord of Lords. W e are
one in acknowledging that this al­
legiance takes precedence of any
other allegiance that may make claims
upon us.
This unity does not consist in the
agreement of our minds or the con­
sent of our wills. It is founded in
Jesus Christ Himself, W ho lived, died
and rose again to bring us to the
Father, and W ho through the Holy
Spirit dwells in His Church. W e are
one because we are all the objects of
the love and grace of God, and called
by Him to witness in all the world
Name we set our hands, as the serv­
ants of God and in Him of one an­
other, to the task of proclaiming God's
message of redemption, of living as
His children, and of combating in­
justice, cruelty, and hate. The Church
can be of good cheer; it hears its
Lord saying, “ I have overcome the
world."

to His glorious gospel.
Our unity is of heart and spirit.
W e are divided in the outward forms
of our life in Christ, because we un­
derstand differently His will for His
Church. W e believe however that a
deeper understanding will lead us to­
wards a united apprehension of the
truth as it is in Jesus.
W e humbly acknowledge that our
divisions are contrary to the will of
Christ, and we pray God in His mercy
to shorten the days of our separation
and to guide us by His Spirit into
fulness of unity.
W e are thankful that during re­
cent years we have been drawn to­
gether; prejudices have been over­
come, misunderstandings removed,
and real, if limited, progress has been
made* towards our goal of a common
mind.
In this Conference we may grate­
fully claim that the Spirit of God has
made us willing to learn from one
another, and has given us a fuller
vision of the truth and enriched our
spiritual experience.
W e have lifted up our hearts to­
gether in prayer; we have sung the
D O C U M E N TA TIO N 177
same hymns; together we have read
the same Holy Scriptures. W e recog­
nize in one another, across the bar­
riers of our separation, a common
Christian outlook and a common stan­
dard of values. W e are therefore as­
sured of a unity deeper than our
divisions.
W e are convinced that our unity
of spirit and aim must be embodied
in a way that will make it manifest
to the world, though we do not yet
clearly see what outward form it
should take.
W e believe that every sincere at­
tempt to co-operate in the concerns
of the Kingdom of Cod draws the
severed communions together in in­
creased mutual understanding and
good will. W e call upon our fellow-
Christians of all communions to prac­
tice such co-operation; to consider
patiently occasions of disunion that
they may be overcome; to be ready
to learn from those who differ from
them; to seek to remove those ob­
stacles to the furtherance of the
gospel in the non-Christian world
which arise from our divisions; and
constantly to pray for that unity
which we believe to be our Lord’s
will for His Church.
W e desire also to declare to all
men everywhere our assurance that
Christ is the one hope of unity for
the world in face of the distractions
and dissensions of this present time.
W e know that our witness is weak­
ened by our divisions. Yet we are
one in Christ and in the fellowship
of His Spirit. W e pray that every­
where, in a world divided and per­
plexed, men may turn to Jesus Christ
our Lord, W ho makes us one in spite
of our divisions; that He may bind
in one those who by many worldly
claims are set at variance; and that
the world may at last find peace and
unity in Him ; to W hom be glory
forever.”
PROPOSED CONCORDAT BETWEEN THE PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH, U. S. A., AND THE PROTESTANT
EPISCOPAL CHURCH
Original Action
The General Convention of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, meeting
in Cincinnati, O., October, 1937,
adopted the following declaration:
‘‘The two Churches, one in
the faith of the Lord Jesus, the
Incarnate W ord of God, recog­
nizing the Holy Scriptures as the
supreme rule of faith, accepting
the two Sacraments ordained by
Christ, and believing that the
visible unity of Christ’s Church
is the will of God, hereby
solemnly declare their purpose
to achieve organic union.”
The Presbyterian General Assembly,
meeting at Philadelphia, Pa., on June
1, 1938, received and adopted the
same declaration.
The Concordat
The following agreement has been
proposed by the representatives of
the two religious bodies concerned,
to be submitted for discussion and
action at the Presbyterian General
Assembly in 1939 and the Protestant
Episcopal Convention in 1940:
178 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
“ The immediate purpose of this
agreement is to provide means where­
by each Church may wherever it
seems locally desirable assume pas­
toral charge of the members of the
other Church and offer them the
privilege of the holy communion, thus
establishing one congregation.
The primary difficulty lies in the
differing views of the ministry. But
there is large agreement. Both
Churches believe the ministry is part
of God's will for His Church. Both
believe that in ordination the Church
is acting for God, and that it is He
who ordains. Both believe that the
succession of the ministry is a con­
tinuing visible sign of the continuous
life of the Church, and that the lay­
ing on of hands is the Apostolic
method of continuing that succession.
Both believe in episcopal ordination,
the one by a bishop, the other by a
presbytery acting in an episcopal
capacity.
Finally, both Churches believe that
all practice in regard to the ministry
should look forward to one which
may have universal acceptance; and
both recognize that a truly reunited
Church would be something greater
than either and inclusive of both.
The position of the two Churches
has not, however, been the same as
regards the recognition of each oth­
er's ministries. The ordination of
ministers* in the Protestant Episcopal
Church has been accepted by the
Presbyterian. On the other hand, min­
isters of the latter Church entering
the ministry of the former have been
required to accept reordination. In
view of the expressed purpose of or­
ganic unity, each Church recognizes
the spiritual efficacy of the other's
ministry of the W ord and Sacraments.
And to assure the full acceptance
of the following plan and noting the
distinction between canonical or legal
validity and spiritual efficacy, when­
ever and wherever under the proper
ecclesiastical authorities a minister
may be commissioned to serve the
members of the other Church and to
minister to them the Sacraments, the
essential act of this commissioning
shall be as follows:
In the case of a minister of the
Presbyterian Church, the bishop of
the diocese concerned, when satis­
fied as to the qualifications of the
candidate, shall lay his hands on his
head and say: “ Take thou authority
to execute the office of a presbyter
in this Church now committed to thee
by the imposition of our hands. In
the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Ghost. Am en."
In the case of a minister of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, the mod­
erator of the presbytery concerned
shall proceed in the same manner
and use the same sentence.
In the ensuing service of institu­
tion or installation, both Churches
shall be represented.
All baptized members of either
Church who have been confirmed or
have made profession of their faith
shall be eligible to receive the holy
communion wherever this arrange­
ment has been entered into.
W hen the minister of one Church
has been commissioned in the other,
he shall continue to be amenable to
discipline in his own Church: but
he shall be expected to report reg­
ularly to the bishop or presbytery, as
D O C U M E N TA TIO N 179
the case may be, concerning the
other’s communicants committed to
his charge; and in case of failure to
exercise proper pastoral care or other
delinquency, the authority of either
Church may present the matter to
the body having jurisdiction and may
in its discretion terminate this rela­
tionship. And, furthermore, this com­
missioning to serve in other than his
own Church carries with it permis­
sion to do so only in the diocese
or presbytery first concerned; and
specific permission for the exercise
of such commissioning must be given
by the proper authority upon removal
into another diocese or presbytery as
the case may be.
Whenever an arrangement of this
kind shall be entered into between a
diocese and presbytery, any ministers
so commissioned shall have seats, but
not votes, in the presbytery or con­
vention of the other Church; and
also, it shall be the privilege of the
bishop or some minister appointed by
him to sit with the presbytery, and
the moderator or some minister ap­
pointed by him, to sit in the conven­
tion of the diocese under the same
conditions.
All these arrangements are re­
garded as ad interim and the two
parties to this concordat hereby agree
that conferences and negotiations
shall continue until organic unity is
achieved, reports being made regularly
to the governing bodies of the two
Churches.**
A MESSAGE TO ALL PEOPLE
(The following Message was issued by the delegates to the Missionary Conference, held at
Madras, India, in December, 1938).
The International Missionary Coun­
cil, meeting at Tambaram in India,
sends greetings to the peoples of all
lands.
W e are 470 delegates gathered
from 70 nations and from many races
of the earth to consider how we may
better make known to the world the
love of the eternal Cod as He has
revealed Himself in Jesus Christ.
The reports that have been brought
to us from every quarter of the globe
have made us realize that the ancient
pestilences which destroy mankind
are abroad with a virulence unparal­
leled. In every country the fact of
war or the fear of it, casts its para­
lyzing shadow over human hope.
Race hatred, the ugly parent of per­
secution, has been set up as a na­
tional idol in many a market place
and increasingly becomes a household
god. Everywhere the greed of money
continues to separate those who have
from those who have not, filling the
latter with angry plans of revolution
and the former with the nervousness
of power.
Again and again a sense of penit­
ence has come over us as we have
realized that these consuming evils
are all of them man-made. They bear
upon them the marks of human manu­
facture as clearly as the motor car or
the aeroplane. Neither flood nor
earthquake nor dark mysterious force
outside of our control produces wars
or economic tensions. W e know that
we live involved within a chaos
which we ourselves have made.
180 YEAR BO O K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
Again and again we have been
forced to note that the evils that we
face are not the work of bad men
only but of good as well. The gravest
of our disasters have been brought
upon us not by men desiring to make
trouble for mankind but by those
who thought they did their best in
the circumstances surrounding them.
W e do not know the man wise enoagh
to have saved the world from its pres­
ent sufferings— and we do not know
the man wise enough to deliver us
now.
But it is just at this point that we
are forced back upon our faith and
rescued from pessimism to a glorious
hope. W e know that there is One
who, unlike ourselves, is not defeated
and who cannot know defeat. In the
wonder of Christ’s revelation we see
Cod not as a remote and careless
deity sufficient unto Himself, but as
a Father with a love for mankind, His
children, as indescribable as it is
fathomless. W e who have looked at
Christ, His Messenger, His Son, torn
with suffering on a cross on which
only His love for man placed Him,
have a tragic but transfiguring in­
sight into the richness and reality of
Cod’s passion for His own. It is this
insight which has taken the Chris­
tians to glad martyrdoms through the
centuries and sent them to the ends
of the earth to spread the great Good
News. And in humility we record our
gratitude that even in this present
time evidences multiply that men and
women still go forth as faithful and
untiring ambassadors of Christ.
It is clear that only God can save
the peoples, and that the Cod and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ not
only can but will. It must become
clearer to us all, however, that the
instruments He demands are not men
and women of ideals as such, but
those who constantly in prayer and
worship verify those same ideals be­
fore His august will— verify and im­
prove and never cease to re-verify
them. It is not the merely moral per­
son whom Cod requires in the present
crisis, or in any other, but the person
who keeps his morality alive and
growing through the constant refresh­
ing of His creative touch. W e can,
none of us, become faultless agents
of His grace, but the only hope be­
fore the world lies in those who at
least attempt to know Him and to
follow in His way.
National gods of any kind, gods
of race or class, these are not large
enough to save us. The recognition
of Cod in Christ by no means robs
a man of his nation or his family or
his culture. W hen Christ is taken
seriously by a nation or an ancient
culture, He destroys no whit of good
within it, but lifts it rather to its own
highest destiny. He does destroy ex­
clusiveness, but in its place He causes
a new quality to grow— good will—
a good will which is wider than na­
tional or cultural loyalties and cor­
responds to the largeness of Cod’s
love.
In our midst we have seen anew
that devotion to the things of Christ
which will work a miracle among
men and women. W e have prayed, and
as we prayed, the barrier of nationality
and class have melted. Knit by the
Holy Spirit the one to the other and
all to Cod, we have known the mean­
ing of fellowship. W e feel this to be
D O C U M E N TA TIO N 181
a promise of what may be in all the
earth.
W e call upon our fellow Christians
throughout the world to join us in
a new dedication. Surely God is sum­
moning us in these times to let go
our self-sufficiency, to frequent His
altars, to learn of Him, and to make
His ways known in all the relation­
ships of life. To make Him known in
the state involves labor for the estab­
lishment of justice among all the
people. In the world of commerce it
involves the ending of unregulated
competition for private gain and the
beginning of emulation for the public
good. God grant to His Church to
take the story of His love to all man­
kind, till that love surround the earth,
binding the nations, the races and the
classes into a community of sympathy
for one another, undergirded by a
deathless faith in Christ.

APPEAL OF POPE PIUS XII FOR PEACE
(On March 3, 1939, the newly-elected Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, issued the
following address, a noble appeal for peace).
As most profound emotion fills our
spirit and we feel ourselves as though
overwhelmed before the tremendous
responsibility to which Divine Provi­
dence in its inscrutable designs has
called us, we feel it necessary to
make known our thoughts immedi­
ately to all. Thus these paternal words.
First of all, with particular affec­
tion, we give our paternal embrace
to the very beloved Cardinals of the
Sacred College whose piety, virtue
and eminent gifts of mind we know
by long association; then we salute
with special benevolence our vener­
able brothers of the episcopate; at
the same time we bless the priests
and nuns, those who work to spread
the Kingdom of Christ through mis­
sions or who collaborate with the
apostolic hierarchy under the guid­
ance of Bishops in the field of Cath­
olic Action and, finally, all our sons
throughout the world, especially those
who suffer poverty and pain.
May very special graces of heaven
descend copiously on each and every
one of these.
But in this solemn moment our
thoughts run also to all those who
are outside the church, to those who
will be pleased to know that the
Pope raises for them to the highest
and greatest God prayers and wishes
for every good.
To this paternal message we wish
to add hope and appeal for peace.
W e mean that peace which our
predecessor of pious memory recom­
mended to men with so much insist­
ence and invoked with such ardent
prayers and for which he offered his
life to God; that peace, sublime gift
of Heaven, which is desired by all
honest souls and which is the fruit
of charity and justice. W e invite
everybody to peace of conscience,
tranquil in the friendship of God; to
peace of families, united and har­
monized by holy love of Christ; and,
finally, to peace among nations
through mutual, brotherly assistance,
182 YEARBOO K OF A M ER IC A N CHURCHES
friendly collaboration and cordial un­
derstandings for the superior interests
of the great human family under the
watchfulness and protection of Divine
Providence.
In these troublesome and difficult
hours, while so many difficulties seem
to impede attainment of that peace
which is the most profound inspira­
tion of hearts, we raise to the Lord
a special prayer for all those who are
entrusted with the high honor and
the grave burden of guiding peoples
on the road to prosperity and progress.
Here then, O beloved Cardinals,
here, venerable brothers, here, be­
loved sons, is the first wish which
rises from the paternal beat which
God has inspired in our heart. Before
us we have the spectacle of immense
evils which scourge the world and
for which blessed God sends us as
succor, unarmed but believing. You
sons, you brothers, would not desire
— we are fully confident of it— to
render our hope vain. After the grace
of God it is on your good-will that
our soul depends so much.
May the Lord Christ, of whose
fullness we all have received, deign
to make fruitful this hope of ours
and extend it as messenger of holy
consolation to the entire earth and
may the benediction which we im­
part in His name give virtue to it.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
Chartered by Congress, June 15, 1916
Scouting offers a program of activity with achievement and recogni­
tion on three age levels. Beginning with Cubbing for boys nine to
twelve, it carries through the period of early adolescence and Troop
Scouting and continues with Senior Scouting for young men in their
late teens and early twenties.
There is no break in the boy's interest as he passes on from Cub­
bing into Troop Scouting and from Troop Scouting into Senior
Scouting—Sea Scouts, Explorers, and Rovers.
The Churches lead all institutions in organizing and adminis­
tering Scout Troops. The Church has more to give in life-time values
than any other type of parent institution. Scout leaders are required to
maintain conditions such that the Church is supported in its efforts
to help the boy to lead a truly religious life.
Consult your local telephone directory for the Boy Scout office
in your city, or write to the Boy Scouts of America, Two Park Ave­
nue, New York City.
Ror more than 220 years the
Presbyterian Ministers' Fund has insured the lives of
ministers, their wives and theological students at the low­
est net cost. It is Interdenominational.
If you are eligible to purchase Life Insurance from
the Fund, you cannot afford to purchase it elsewhere.

Progressive
Presbyterian Journal
T
he Presbyterian T ribune is
not an official publication of
the Presbyterian Church.
Though sympathetic toward the
boards and agencies of the church,
it reserves the right to disagree
with any of their policies and to
suggest changes whenever it be­
lieves they are needed. Seeking the
unity of the Church of Christ, it
recognizes that in the present stage
of religious development, Presby­
terians should work loyally to
strengthen their own denomination.
it*
¡b e a t
T
he T ribune aspires to be the
organ of those members of
the Presbyterian Church
who are convinced that religion is
vital and dynamic, that it does not
function in a vacuum, and, to ful­
fill its purpose, must be expressed
not only in the character of indi­
viduals but also in every institu­
tion and phase of human action.
Thus it interprets the Gospel of
Christ as personally and socially
redemptive. Recognizing that civil­
ization is threatened with disinte­
gration, it is convinced that only
the ethics and spirit of Jesus are
adequate to save the world. In
short, T he T ribune seeks the ap­
plication of Christian spirit and
ethic to problems of the day.

In Preparing A
PRINTING BUDGET
WHICH QUESTION do yon ask?
As specialists in the field of Religious Printing we never have
counseled ostentation or unnecessary extravagance on the part of
our clients. Church and Welfare printing should be planned with
due regard for the sources from which funds come. But cheap
printing is more expensive than good printing, for cheap printing
fails in its purpose to teach, to appeal or to interest.
Good printing, as we have learned to do it for the Church is
surprisingly close in price to the cheapest you can get.
