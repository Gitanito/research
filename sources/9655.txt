  					 The first few times I died and went through the void/curtain/wall that divides mortals with heaven- I saw a light and an old friend. All I was told, was that it was not my time. It was as if I was in a room w/no lights, sounds or feelings and all of a sudden, a white light and a shadow appeared that told me that it was not my time. This happened several times, maybe 5 times.


The last time it happened I felt awake on the operating room table- I could hear the nurse and the doctor, the heart machine. I heard a female voice say we're losing him. Then I felt as if my soul<?> had been grabbed and pulled upwards to the ceiling. I was floating, I tried to look back- but that is not allowed. The sounds of the OR slowly faded- as if someone was turning down the volume control, slowly. I felt scared, but had a strange feeling of comfort or being told to be calm. I went through a dark tunnel where the light slowly became brighter. Then a shadow appeared- an old friend told me that it was not my time and then things went black/gone/etc. <p><br>I somehow figured out that the shadow was a friend who died 5 years earlier. I am glad to see that he made it to heaven, he deserved it.<br><br><span style="color:#0080FF">Background Information:</span><br/><br><span style="color: #009999">Gender:</span>   Male<br/><br><span style="color: #009999">Date NDE Occurred:</span>   after 05 sept 1991<br/><br><span style="color:#0080FF">NDE Elements:</span><br/><br><span style="color: #009999">At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?     </span>Uncertain   AccidentSurgery-relatedAllergic reaction  I was unconscious for most of it so I am unsure of the exact cause.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?      I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   I was told repeatedly that it was not my time. Who decided, I don't know- For what reason, I don't know that either.

God, Spiritual and Religion: 

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?      Yes     it gave me a "god-complex".. Not only am I a prophet, I also believe that I am immortal.

The experience included:      Presence of unearthly beings

After the NDE: 

Was the experience difficult to express in words?     Uncertain   I have no problem talking about it- but I have to be careful of who I tell because I don't want to go to a loony bin.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?      Uncertain     Well, I believe that I have a more direct line to "god". I have asked questions that only  she/he/it/they could have answered.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?       I do not know, yet.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?    Yes      Various reactions from; you should devote your life to god to you should feel lucky. Don't know how they were influenced. I don't tell many people-

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    No   Just my memory

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?      Can't think of anything.
