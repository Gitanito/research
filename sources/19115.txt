dr greer good afternoon
good afternoon good to see you good to
see you so dr greer it appears that you
have some really amazing breaking news
to share with people
um can you tell us what this is
i can and i have to be circumspect but
uh i&#39;ll be as direct as i am allowed to
be
um the biggest development uh i think in
uh getting the
cover-up of the ufo issue
changed has been happening in the last
month or so
and um
you know i&#39;m working with some folks and
have been in washington as you know for
a number of years
there&#39;s been a sea change there&#39;s been a
realization
that
these
beyond black
unacknowledged special access projects
are in fact being run outside of
supervision and and constitutional
oversight
and that&#39;s happening at a very high
level in the us government i&#39;m here in
washington today of course i leave to
come out to
scottsdale tomorrow and then our
conference starts on friday april 8th
and there&#39;s been a change to the
schedule because of this development
so that on a saturday at 2 p.m during
the initial part of my presentation
as 2 pm pacific those of you who want to
join
the conference of course is already uh
sold out oversold whatever
um but you can join my webinar the link
is below in the right up here
um when you see the posting for this um
and the reason this is going to be very
important
first a little bit of background
many people i think a few years back two
or three four years ago
were shocked when the memo leaked about
admiral
wilson
tom wilson who uh i had briefed in in
back in the
late 90s
and
i had said for a number of years after
he retired and left that command
that even though he was the head of
intelligence for the joint chiefs of
staff he had been denied access and in
fact had been threatened
directly when he made inquiries into the
et and ufo-related
unacknowledged special access projects
and an overview of those a very good one
is as you can see on amazon prime or
tubia it&#39;s a big documentary called
unacknowledged
and it&#39;s had over 700 million people see
it and if you haven&#39;t seen it you should
see it it sort of backgrounds what i&#39;m
about to tell you
i think at the time
when that memo leaked uh from
dr davis uh
people
were shocked
even though i had already warned people
that the folks that we had met with to
provide information on the subject such
as the director of the cia
head of the defense intelligence agency
uh members of congress
people in the white house
etc
had in fact made directed inquiries and
had been blocked at every turn
now most people think this cannot be the
case
but it is
now it&#39;s taken
a few years for since the last wave of
disclosure attempts
since the unacknowledged movie came out
uh four or five years ago
and we just released today another one
it&#39;s not it was not done by me but i
cooperated with it it&#39;s called above top
secret and i recommend people see it as
soon as they can it gives more
background on this
but
this particular
breakthrough and government
investigation
uh while i cannot refer to what agency
or group is is doing this
uh is the most serious one since 1945.
and so
in in light of that we&#39;ve made some
appeals for
whistleblowers to come forward as you
know in the 2001 press conference
we had a couple dozen there but we had
over a hundred we&#39;d already interviewed
many of them are in various uh
sites our youtube channel that you&#39;re on
now if you look through it you&#39;ll see
several dozen of them
one of the most significant and recent
whistleblowers that contacted us a
couple of weeks ago
and this man in the early 2000s not very
long ago had
been assigned to a retrieval team
um out of the nellis range the nellis
air force base so-called
area 51 but way north on the range at a
remote base uh the drawings of which we
have and we will be showing on saturday
at that 2 p.m presentation
and he had been selected to be on this
team basically to gather up debris or
retrieve objects that had bound
and there were two types that he was
involved with the first were the
man-made ufos the things that
unfortunately 99 of ufologists and
everyone in the u.s congress and white
house thinker alien
quote unquote they&#39;re not um
and he saw that immediately this is
broad daylight one the first one was a
downed or disabled one that had had some
problem totally electromagnetic
uh roughly triangular and we have the
schematics and drawings of that
um from the whistleblower himself that
have then been made into very accurate
drawings by uh
michael stratt and his team and we&#39;ll be
showing those on saturday
the other thing uh that happened is that
he was deployed to a couple other
incidents like that
and then of course
the the major one
was when a um extraterrestrial vehicle
interstellar craft
about 65 feet in diameter will show
people the drawing of that as well
was somehow forced down way far
north in the uh nevada test range way
north of uh
the actual uh nellis air force base in
in
nevada
and that craft it was disabled and above
it was in
alien reproduction vehicles as they&#39;ve
been called or a man-made ufo hovering
holding it in check
now there are a whole series of things
that ensued
and uh
it ended
quite spectacularly i&#39;ll go into that on
saturday
but there were three et&#39;s that came out
of the craft
and two of them came where this
particular whistleblower touched him and
a whole series of events transpired
uh
then when he realized that we humans
were the problem that we were targeting
these objects and that these uh people
these et people were completely
non-hostile
um very brilliant communicated through
thought forms and impressions and like
packets of information as we speak about
he wanted to withdraw from the operation
because he was horrified of what we were
doing
he was threatened with death luckily he
had a family member senior enough in the
organization to shelter him and get him
out and extracted him with 10 marines
etc
but he
was harassed he was shot at deliberately
missed obviously just as a way of saying
keep your mouth shut
now
two years later
he&#39;s back in his home state in the upper
midwest
and
he is uh broad daylight 1 42 in the
afternoon
a man-made
alien reproduction vehicle roughly
triangular in shape
comes over his car stalls
and then outside the car
are these three
quote
aliens
now these are the ones that everyone
think of as aliens not the actual et&#39;s
and people go what are you talking about
the vast
predominant
you know experience people have had
have been stage craft by
deeply
black
covert operations targeting humans
both who have had actual contact or
people in government
for their psychological compliance with
their the false narrative there being an
alien threat
and that happened to this man
to the point that we have very clear
drawings
now of these plfs and also
because he actually knocked one down and
kicked it the outer covering looks like
skin came off and see the internal
wires and tubes and what have you so all
of this we&#39;re going to go through on
saturday uh and with the drawings and
very
specifically now the reason that&#39;s so
important is that
this is not an uncommon occurrence
and
of course in
hollywood
and movies and tv shows and ufo
conferences
these are all presented as
menacing
aliens from outer space
and of course i found out in 92 93 94
that in fact we had highly classified
projects that were manufacturing
the fake
aliens
and that that phenomenon was has was
launched not just united states but all
over the world
to cover up the presence it created a
sort of distraction
misdirect
of the actual et&#39;s
now this is really important for the
people in the ce5 contact community to
understand
because there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s an
endless number of people dealing with
these conspiracy concepts
of you know the good aliens and the bad
aliens the bad aliens working with the
secret government and this narrative and
that narrative and there have been
people in bases seeing these little guys
running around in military bases but of
course the people observing that those
military people
didn&#39;t know that those were not
indigenous let&#39;s say from another planet
but were
basically very advanced robotics that
look lifelike
uh but i mean really advanced and
nanomolecular i mean very sophisticated
we&#39;re not talking you know you know
a robot at gm putting a bolt on a car
very very
convincingly looking like a living
extraterrestrial
now this has been really hard uh for for
me to say these things to the public
because it&#39;s not popular people have
their belief systems based on their fear
and
then from that hatred
but it&#39;s very important that this is now
coming out in some very good
excruciating detail and of course this
account
uh and we have this whistleblower
military whistleblowers credentials
information etc
uh that&#39;s being provided to the proper
us government authorities
down to the level of specifics
operational details etc
why
because that&#39;s the only way these folks
are going to get into the system is
getting them that kind of actionable
intelligence as we call it
and that
is really important and i&#39;m going to
make an appeal right here right now um
here in washington
for there to be a small army of these
type of courageous whistleblowers to
come forward men and women who&#39;ve been
on these projects and by the way
on that retrieval team
uh there was a delta group involved but
and there were also just the people who
were there just technically to get stuff
and pick up debris
um but
there were women as well as men in that
operation
and this was not that long ago so we
know that there are men and women
still in those projects and who have
been in them recently
we have extended
protection to this man
which we were able to do
and um
we are also working on some other
strategies but those i can&#39;t speak about
right now
uh
i will say
that there&#39;s now a conduit
a mechanism for these sort of people to
cooperate officially
with people in the united states
government that has never existed now
the reason i say that
is that in prior attempts
let&#39;s say
project blue book in the 60s that was a
uh
sort of a storefront set up as a pr
exercise it was never intended to get to
the truth and then inform the congress
the president or the american people it
was basically again a misdirect
the 22 million dollars sent over to
bigelow aerospace that senator harry
reid
and that general herbert gave us the
detailed information on that was set up
as a way of absorbing that money and
interest
that was authorized by people in
congress
and from the pentagon
and that then was all trash it resulted
in nothing except
as the general said a 40 000 foot
snapshot
uh because he was an army pilot
originally
and there have been others um and over
the last few years of course it&#39;s all
been in the news and your time 60
minutes
about various investigatory efforts now
now what&#39;s what changed in the last
couple of months
it&#39;s huge it&#39;s big
the people who&#39;ve been trying to get to
the bottom of this
on the various agencies
and places
have now realized that there&#39;s no
getting into it through the front door
what do i mean if you try to get to this
through the chain of command it doesn&#39;t
matter if you&#39;re the president doesn&#39;t
matter if you&#39;re the ci director doesn&#39;t
matter if you&#39;re a senator doesn&#39;t
matter if you&#39;re a three or four star
general
unless you have been read into these
projects
and you&#39;ve been read into them because
you&#39;re willing to go along with a
criminal
an unconstitutional unlawful murderous
kidnapping
cell
you&#39;re not going to be told anything
nothing
so by definition and of course we came
to this assessment by 1993 and 94
that if you know about it you are for
for someone who&#39;s been turned and is
part of this corruption
and everyone else
doesn&#39;t matter what your rank is doesn&#39;t
matter what your position is i mean this
is the case when i have met with
ministers of defense in canada united
kingdom australia it doesn&#39;t matter what
your rank is and your position in the
traditional government
you&#39;re not going to be shown anything or
told anything you go out to the lockheed
skunk works you&#39;ll be shown a bunch of
antique planes a bunch of old stuff that
run on fossil fuels
i know this for a fact which is what
they told me now
what does that mean it means that now
they sort of have come to a traumatic
and it is traumatic
i you know i
sometimes break up talking about the
trauma of 1993 94 finding out that in
fact this was all true
was not some wild conspiracy theory
although it&#39;s pillory is that of course
you know i tell people you ever heard of
the mafia there are criminal
conspiracies that&#39;s why they&#39;re all the
conspiracy laws
but the way you defame something&#39;s
called a
conspiracy theory these are facts
everything i&#39;m sharing with you are
absolute in court provable facts
now
what that means is
since the sort of
curtain has been pulled away
this this sort of titanium ceiling they
couldn&#39;t get through
what we&#39;re doing now is putting together
the most dispositive proof evidence
and actionable details
for everyone who is a let&#39;s call the
white hats in the government who are
really trying to solve this problem and
fix this problem
um
we need the help of the public
and i am making an appeal now and i will
go into more detail this weekend at the
conference
of why we need it
and how it needs to be conveyed
so our website siriusdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s disclosure all one word dot
com
there is a contact bar and under that
are witness for witnesses
if you
are
a direct first hand
or
someone second hand but have
documentation of say your father or
somebody who&#39;ve been involved
excuse me in these unacknowledged
special access projects please contact
us
you know we keep things very
confidential and this person wants to be
known publicly
and of course anyone at that level you
know they sign
non-disclosure agreements sometimes out
70 years they say they&#39;ll give up their
pensions that they and one recently that
we dealt with that literally signed
something that they could be terminated
killed if they spoke of it
now that&#39;s not happening to any of these
guys we we have a system in place
protect them
and i i won&#39;t go into that any further
except that i extend what we have had
under our protection and what&#39;s kept our
team going
it to anyone who reaches out and anyone
who helps to get this uh fascist covert
group um
under control before we end up in a real
debacle on this planet
now
that is something that everyone can
network because it&#39;s six degrees of
separation as the old saying goes
there are people
that every person knows somebody who
knows somebody who may know somebody
who in fact
dealt with this issue
that may have been peripherally it may
have been for a short amount of time or
it may have been for a very prolonged
amount of time
who are now ready to come out of the
cold
and come out of those shadows
and
now more than ever
we have
a mechanism to do that because that did
not exist
in the 90s with the clinton
administration because the president got
intimidated and and stood down with that
inquiry
um it did not happen after him
with bush and chain and of course
cheney&#39;s been a key member
of this committee running this and he
pretty much just sort of ran the
intelligence shop for the bush white
house
and of course obama was
given some information on this but did
not want to pursue it for
a number of reasons usually it has to do
with
the fact that they can&#39;t get any
straight answers and they&#39;re intimidated
and ordered what to do
in fact we have a clip of obama
admitting as much even though he was the
president united states and the chief
executive who&#39;s supposed to have access
to everything as commander-in-chief but
in reality they do not that&#39;s what jimmy
carter also has told us
president carter in the past so the only
way around this sort of blockade
is through the back door people coming
out through the back door
into our system and then into the arms
of the people trying to fix this problem
it takes courage it takes diligence
it&#39;s an enormous undertaking and it
needs to be global by the way this is
not just pertaining to the united states
you know these operations are worldwide
i&#39;ll remind you
in our documentary that came out in july
4th of last year
that we discovered that jacques boulet
had a
top secret cia document
that specifically
describes cia abduction programs in
brazil and argentina
where they would abduct
civilians and make it look like there
was alien abductions for it and i quote
psychological warfare purpose
and that&#39;s word for word within a 1953
document describing the psychological
warfare value
of how they could use the ufo subject
to enrich the war machine and eventually
do what werner von braun
who invented the rocket for adolf hitler
warned about on his deathbed to hoax an
alien threat
so
all of these operations are extremely
well organized well funded
remember that the federal budget
united states 5 trillion or plus or
minus
most of those are entitlements
the rest is the pentagon
and there&#39;s a little bit that&#39;s
discretionary not that much
the discretionary budget
that the united states government in its
totality has is dwarfed by an orders of
magnitude by the resources of this group
the technologies that the u.s government
has as admiral wilson said to us the
best thing i know about is a b-2 stealth
bomber and i have learned that there are
aircraft under the control of this
clandestine group
that can do circles
around
my b2 stealth bombers
and this is head of intelligence for the
joint chiefs of staff this is to me
personally when i had edgar mitchell at
the meeting with me at the pentagon so i
think people need to understand that
there is a
great opportunity that&#39;s opened a door
has opened
and we all need to walk through it
together
and the more that do it the stronger
that move will be
so that&#39;s my appeal now on saturday
the 9th of april
i&#39;ll be going through this and go
through all the
the uh images of the actual et&#39;s the
actual e.t crap the man-made crap and
the man-made aliens that are on the
cover of almost every ufo book and
and movie and documentary and film in
hollywood all right
um and and this is you know
the penetration of this disinformation
this sort of a hoaxed alien presence has
been thorough
in all walks of life
uh and unfortunately it you know i said
this when i was in new york meeting with
a bunch of
people who
supposed to the new york 100 sort of the
really elite in new york city at a salon
in a woman&#39;s home and the wife of the
secretary general was there and some
other people
and this woman said i&#39;ve read 26 books
about alien abductions and i said yes
ma&#39;am
you have just absorbed into your
consciousness 26 times more rubbish than
someone who&#39;s only read one book
because those not that necessarily
everyone writing those books are part of
some conspiracy they&#39;re not they&#39;re just
parroting
what the you know observable
experiences are without knowing who&#39;s
causing the experience and most people
have never asked the question pat and
this is what&#39;s really concerning
is it
hours
man-made or is it something
extraterrestrial most people don&#39;t even
know to ask that question well every
single case that happens
you have to ask that question
because the technologies are
extraordinary that they have
to as the word has been used in a
document we have stage craft
these these false
interactions and abductions and
mutilations with aliens
now you know to what purpose it&#39;s
obvious it&#39;s psychological warfare it&#39;s
conditioning the public um the media
through movies
uh what have you to assess that one or
more of these extraterrestrial
civilizations are
hostile and a threat
and that&#39;s simply not true
but it sells well because people like
cowboys and indians fight and they love
conflict and and humans generally tend
to be very addicted to conflict hate
this is why we have endless racism
endless ethnic war endless battles
um and this is you know the original sin
of humanity
is not being able to see the oneness of
all of us in all life and then every
time there&#39;s a difference you know then
we take up arms the difference is you
know if you had a club and hit someone
in the head not great now we have
thurman nuclear weapons and the secret
government have weapons a thousand times
more deadly than a thermonuclear weapon
that they have
uh weaponized uh by studying
extraterrestrial technologies so this is
an existential threat to the earth
what we&#39;re talking about and we have to
avert it and we can there&#39;s time it
ain&#39;t over until the fat lady sings
and so we can do it but we&#39;re going to
need everyone to help us um this is a
daunting undertaking i can tell you the
people
that i meet meet with routinely and have
over the years they&#39;re traumatized by
this who are in senior government
positions
because
it&#39;s a type i you know i sort of think
of it as disclosure ptsd for most people
at home listening this is all very
entertaining but if you&#39;re in charge
like
general hughes who is head of the
defense intelligence agency which is
like the intelligence entity
for the military like the cia is
civilian
and you&#39;ve you&#39;re being shoved aside and
don&#39;t know
any of this and you&#39;re flying blind
through a fog about ready to hit a
mountain
it&#39;s it&#39;s terrifying
and so
we have to create the road map
and this is the other thing we need
people who have actionable
information and intelligence on project
code names
locations
uh corporations
you know basis
of
facilities on a base
the underground layouts of these spaces
on and on and on
so that&#39;s what we really need and i&#39;m
hoping
that
we can you know get enough information
quickly
over the next few months
so that there can be a substantial
breakthrough and so the worst of the
plans of this
secret government uh operation dealing
with ufos can be averted
so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing
i wanted to let everyone know that that
that&#39;s what we&#39;ll be going into some
depth on on saturday just wanted to do a
quick update for people so we&#39;ll have a
schedule change
but
i&#39;m hoping that we&#39;ll have
you know
a lot of folks come forward by releasing
this one this whistleblower&#39;s
information
is so rich and they&#39;re so special
because it covers not only the man-made
ones in detail i mean we&#39;re talking
right there retrieving it every detail
but also the e.t craft the e.t beans and
the man-made aliens
and so that
case
where it&#39;s a series of events that
happened
from someone who was on a specific
retrieval team and not you know like
clifford stone god bless him he passed
away last year he was on one in the 60s
but this is in the 2000s this is fairly
recent
so
it&#39;s a huge breakthrough and i hope
people will join us on saturday
and network with everyone you know about
this message message to bring more
people forward
to
tell the truth and have the courage uh
to do this for our country and for
humanity in the world
now is this something that you
afterwards are going to have for people
um who may not be able to attend or
may not be there is this going to be
somewhere where people can see this
afterwards or hear about it
yeah so the whole webinar
i mean you can click on if you can&#39;t see
it live it will be uh available
immediately
after it&#39;s live so you can see it at
your leisure because we realize that if
you&#39;re in australia it may be two in the
morning or whatever it is
um
or something crazy
or
in in in europe you know at 10 o&#39;clock
at night
in pacific time you&#39;re already you know
eight hours difference in paris so it&#39;s
it&#39;s we hours of the morning so we&#39;re
going to anyone who signs up for that
will be have access for i think a month
or so to be able to see it the entire
weekend friday night saturday and then
sunday out under the stars and that&#39;s
the last the last thing i want to
mention
people should get the ce5 contact app
and then join and practice it and join
us
out when we&#39;re out under the stars on
sunday night but we&#39;re also going to do
it inside on friday and saturday night
the 8th and 9th but on the 10th of april
we&#39;re all going to have have a few
hundred people out in the desert on
native american land that they let us
use
and we&#39;re gonna do the whole ce5 process
for at least four hours
out under the stars
and i think that
that is very powerful because it creates
protection in higher consciousness
it shifts the world&#39;s
way of thinking
away from war towards universal peace
and higher consciousness and ultimately
that is the most powerful force and if
you combine right action and courageous
action with higher consciousness and
spirit
you know what the shambhala kingdom i
think they used to call it you know a
shambhala warrior
not violent at all but in consciousness
and spirit i think that&#39;s what we all
need to aspire to and i think that&#39;s
what we&#39;re all going to be doing
together out in the desert and i hope
folks can can join us
i think it&#39;s going to be amazing really
yeah it&#39;s going to be awesome
well thank you guys uh thanks pat and
uh i hope everyone can can join us
virtually
uh friday saturday and sunday and um you
know if you can&#39;t make it through the
weekend uh you can just join us also
just on sunday night so the link will
guide you how to do that uh and
hopefully we want to have another one of
these events we hope in this year maybe
two more
uh hopefully where we can hold more
people than this particular site um
so again thank you all and keep looking
up thank you dr greer thank you for this
wonderful information very explosive
thank you you&#39;re welcome
