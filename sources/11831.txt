  		              		Experience Description   

    During surgery on June 26, 2012, I lived an 'experience' that I have to share. 
  
  I was in front of 15 to 20 people who were  standing on a path of white marble. I knew the material  was marble, but it yet it wasn't marbled. It was sparkling white, like snow; a pure whiteness. By the roadside there were low, straight walls that were made of the same material. The angles between the very straight path and the small walls were extremely straight.
  
  I knew that this path was part of an immense garden that I couldn't see anymore. This image of a 'dream' was the last moment where an infinite number of things had happened.  I forgot these happenings as if a door or a book had closed and I was seeing the cover of the book knowing that I had just been reading it.
  
  On the road, people were standing. I believe that other people  were behind the road and that I came from there. The people behind the road could be numerous.
  
  I knew that those people were extremely beautiful, in excellent health because they were radiating beauty and health,  and they were well dressed. I  was amazed that being well dressed could be important and  it wasn't something superficial.  Above all, I knew that between them there was a very good atmosphere where all is in  perfect harmony. They had a shared love and they had been infinitely kind towards each other and towards myself. By the word 'kind,' I mean in the sense of loving even though they didn't know each other and also didn't know me. But they were 'real friends' in the highest sense of the word and persons at the height  of growth of their humanity and with a perfect sense of team spirit between them.
  
  I knew all this about them, but  I didn't see their faces, or clothes. They looked like white lights or more descriptive, like  'living torchlights.' These people  were resplendent with beauty, health and mutual harmony - without doing anything. Everything was peaceful and static. 
  
  While I was looking at them, I heard, '“Mrs. M., you can wake up, everything went well.' At that moment, I had an impression of a horrible noise, like being transported on a stretcher making a very aggressive noise. At that moment, I have the memory of these people giving me  a  very fluid arm movement, which meant 'good bye and until soon.'
  
  I also know that I had an extremely short vision about life on earth, what seemed like a hell for me. I saw fires and mass graves, as if seeing a movie in 360 degrees in a few seconds. I was thinking, 'But why is this guy calling me and saying everything went well? That's not possible, it couldn't be better than what I just have been seeing! Why does he want me to return into this hell, this noise, how awful!!!' Then, I had the impression of 'being back down' in my body and thinking, 'Oh yes, it's true that I'm coming out of anesthesia and that this is his world which is in theory reality. I needed to come back to this reality, even though the world I just saw was a thousand times better, that's the hard reality that I have to reintegrate.' For me this was an impression of a really, really dreadful downfall. At the same time, I said to myself, 'Fortunately that he called me back. If he wouldn't have, I might be dead.  There was no chance that I would have come back on my own as I was very far from thinking about this world down here. I felt too good.' A kind of gratitude for the person that called me back, as without him I would have been staying.  I then thought about my duties toward my family, 'Oh dear, I almost forgot them, my little family and my life from here!!!' An impression of getting lost in an eternal present. I, who am so responsible and in control. Over there, the world that I saw was so tempting that I couldn't leave it. I didn't think at anything else except  the people I saw and how loving their were.
  
  Afterwards, when waking up, I had an impression of uneasiness and ill-being, in contrast to the total well-being when I was in  contact with those superior beings. I felt an impression of abruptness, maybe the doctor woke me too fast and I didn't get the time to forget. Maybe you can have similar dreams but you always forget them. I felt much worse than after the other anesthesia. My left thigh was painful. I was  cold and  shivering. The anesthetist then told me that there had been no incident and that this can depend on the product they used.
  
  I also have to say that I was astonished about myself for appreciating this world without nature, and adoring this white marble. Normally, I don't like marble at all and I hate not seeing nature.  A perfect world for me should include nature. I said to myself, 'Nature is not so important in life as there is such a good atmosphere there, with only humans.'
  
  Here I'm continuing with an analysis from questions that strongly arose in the following hours and days after this experience:
  
  A clear impression that the world I reached is 'superior' and that one or more parallel worlds exist. I had a catholic education and a Buddhist sensibility, and then I'm truly searching for the purpose of life. A clear impression that there was a real 'downfall', a descent,  characterized by a horrible but familiar noise that is our world. I have qQuestions about the downfall of 'Adam and Eve' despite my not believing in this. Today I think that there is some truth behind, that I re-experienced their downfall.  But I still have questions: 'What did they do to fall so deeply?' Asa superior world exists, why are we coming to earth where life is so hard? Why are humans choosing a lower world while they were much better off? What have we done to deserve this? Our world would be like a hard entity and on a lower plane than  a more perfect world. A total trust in a Being that must know why this has to function this way and not another way; why our imperfect world exists. That's how it is and it's for the best, needless to ask questions.
  
  A clear conviction that those beings have not been angels like they are described in books. They could be Saints (my brother who is very Christian told me 'you saw the Communion of the Saints', what seems quite plausible to me). A clear impression that the world I saw is in-between us and what we call paradise.

  A strange challenge of my love for nature after having seen this infinitely human world without nature. As if I got a knowledge that ecology and pollution is a detail. Of course, in comparison to this perfect world, what does it matter?

  Nevertheless, I'm staying with the same human values and the respect of nature. (According to the expression of Jesus “Give to Cesar what belongs to Cesar”, as a reply to somebody who didn't want to pay his taxes on the pretext that the Lord is more important than the material, meaning respecting the values of the terrestrial world while you are there). They are worlds that cannot be compared, very different systems.

  The certitude that the beauty of the world and the love that we know are but samples, in small touches, of those infinite ones that I sensed. Total comprehension and adhesion to the myth of Plato's cave.

  The question about “Why was I shown these things, why did I get this information, this revelations about the 'downfall', the Love and the Real Beauty? Why did I deserve this, or for what purpose did I get to know this? The  need to transmit, at least to my sisters and brothers having had the same education as I, to whom I'm happy to pass on 'the Good News', an expression dear to Christians. A better world exists, our sufferings are not in vain.

  The conviction that religions are giving us partial information, each in their own language, in order to say those unspeakable things. They are all true and they are all complementary. (I was thinking this already before). They all tell us  in pictures what you cannot describe with words (example the parables of the Christ). But only the experience counts.

  In the following weeks, I came across a quotation about an appearance of the Virgin: “If you knew how much God loves you, you would be crying with joy”.  This sentence was in a text and I sensed this sentence very strongly when I came across. I understood it with a great depth, a great emotion (crying with joy) much more than before my experience. Thinking at these beings is giving me great emotions. But how telling you? They are but words...

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I do think that I acquired knowledge, but my belief is identical.  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   I'm looking even more into universality of religions and I'm making the link between transcendence of belief and personal development.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     The beings resembled a lot to what the catholic religion describes as 'The Communion of the Saints'. But I had been very astonished of not seeing any nature, I who did love nature so much.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain     I already had a certain depth  and the belief, but I got revelations about certain questions. My indecision and the loss of my own will surprises and troubles me.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   Several beings of light were standing on a white road in the middle of the cosmos.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain     The only link I perceived was the link of love that I perceived between these mystical beings, and between them and myself.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I learned so many things, that are difficult to explain.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I had the firm conviction that this perfect world in which I was, with those infinitely loving beings, existed in conjunction with our world, and that those two dimensions are indissociable. I got the answer for my question 'but why did God create this world which is so imperfect?'. The answer was that it has to be accepted, our world is like a lower world and essential for a superior organization. That certain elements of love and beauty  that we see on earth are but the reflection, samples, of this superior world.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     I had the firm conviction that this perfect world in which I was, with those infinitely loving beings, existed in conjunction with our world, and that those two dimensions are indissociable. I got the answer to my question 'but why did God create this world which is so imperfect?'. The answer was that it has to be accepted, our world is like a lower world and essential for a superior organization. That certain elements of love and beauty  that we see on earth are but the reflection, samples, of this superior world.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     A revelation about the downfall of Adam and Eve (the two worlds, superior and inferior, are concomitant) we have to accept this.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Uncertain     The superior world was so beautiful that it erases all questioning about human and earthly difficulties.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     That superior beings which are deeply loving humans are existing, that they are watching over us and are sending us constantly and plenty of quantities of infinite love. After coming back to earth, I suffered for several months from the contrast of feeling this love I received over there and of what we know on earth. I sensed the need  to be more in a relationship of truth and love with my loved ones, and I'm better able to perceive loving persons and situations where there is love. Finally, I feel more than before the fact that each human being is loving and deserves love.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life     It's now harder for me to make decisions. I want to pass all my time with the people that I love. I'm trusting more in 'providence', I have a firm conviction that if it is hard for me to make choices, my own will is not very important, that 'coincidence' is working in favor of what has to come, and that everything is for the best. I appreciate the encounter with strangers more, I have the impression to have a better access to their 'heart', I'm functioning less through my head. I'm less involved with earthly life, I believe that this whole world is very imperfect and that you shouldn't invest too much into the formal aspect of things.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes A need for depth and truth in relationships. I questioned my married life.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Because there was what I saw and what I sensed, what I 'knew', and they were very different things. Because the love I received from these people was palpable, immense, indescribable.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I have the impression that I will never forget it.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     For sure a bigger opening of the heart. Also more intuition.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          A beautiful encounter, I'm grateful that I was allowed to meet them.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    In the first days with my daughter, as I knew that she would be receptive. Then with my brothers and sisters, with friends of whom I knew that they are receptive. I'm careful and I have the impression to know whom I can share with. I also told almost unknown persons about, when I knew that they were receptive, and a person that didn't have the belief, to help them. I think that this helped, she told me so.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Since a very young age I was fascinated. My brother had been telling me about Raymond Moody.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     As a reality which is superior to ours, and is permanent.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Same  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Sometimes a better connection with my fellow man, thanks to a better opening up of the heart.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I wish everybody to meet them
