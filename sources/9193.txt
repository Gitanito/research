He was a white man and he had a suit on. He said his name was Mich'l and for me to come with him. I looked and there was a tunnel where he was, I looked at myself on the floor where I slept by my sister. I saw her sleeping in the bed. I looked back at him and took his hand. For some reason I trusted him. I had a feeling that he was a good person. We walked through the wall into a tunnel. There was a bright light and he stopped and told me to go through it. I remember stepping through and it became a bright sunny day. A beautiful place and children playing with lions and everyone was so happy. They all looked at me and told me to go meet them. There were two glowing figures. I could not see their faces but one was sitting on a throne and one was standing next to the other. A thunderous voice spoke and the other man said it is not time my son, go back and take care of people.

My mother woke me up by shaking me. She took me to the hospital. The next day I told her God has spoken to me and I went to heaven. I told the doctor and he said I hallucinated and it was not real. I stopped breathing and thought I died.

After that, I always know God put me here to take care of the sick. I am graduating paramedic school and planning on going to medical school next year.
