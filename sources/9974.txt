My son was run over by a Lincoln Continental when he was 6 years old. He is also a Hemophilia.  I picked him up out of the highway there was no sign of life.  I gave him cpr for a long time  He is my only child and I live for him  after a very long time of no response  I laid him down and proceeded to loose it.  I screamed to God to please don't take my baby.  At that moment I saw life come back into my sons body.   A few months later my son said " Mom , I was above you watching you give me mouth to mouth."  He also explained what was going on while I thought  he was dead.  He didn't bleed either.  He was born Hemophilia A.  I thank God every day for giving him back. He is  22 now.
