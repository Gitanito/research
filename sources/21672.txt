U7l!y Message to the
I
T is :ihv:iy! a little mad to trifle, in
\\'Ords, \vith the emotion of Love.
It is madder yet, '"ithout the ex-
cuse of the novelist, for me to tenr
:\\\':IY the protective CO\'ering of pri-
vacy and expose to you rny O\vn lnrge
sh:1re of the thrills thnt, since the be-
ginning of time, hnve mndc the 'vorld
go around.
But is it not br:tve?
I have Jived and loved; nnd, li\'ing,
lo\'ing, have learned I
J\!ost sincerely I believe I have had
rcvenlcd to n1e the glory and beauty of
Naturalness; have, in living life :1c-
cording to Nature'~ dictun1, found thnt
Fountain of Youth ror \\'Inch ;o 1nany
n Ponce de Leon hns sought in vain.
'\'ould it not s1nack of fear not to
pass that on?
Because Life has tauJ,?ht nic to hnve
no fear of convention, and has taught
me also the value of frankne>s and
n1oral courage, I can give you this
story of my life. I \Vant to tell of all
us blissful, pnlpitnting 1110111cnts.
I want to confe~ and \vhy not?-to
events and consequences \\•hich con-
''entional fools have tried to condemn
or hide.

A WARNING TO ALT. YOUNG GlRLS
Youth o
l\1y life echoes Lhis last lOS\YOr: Vir·
tuc is n ~talc of mind; no n1ore, no
less; :ind I feel that by offering thlt
free and frank story I can best prove
this; prove, too, tbnt impulses, \vhich
alone count, arc the true secret of life
and love and eternal youth.
The pulse of Nnture can 1nakc of
Life a dance of youth to the ,·cry brink
of a joyous eternity.
For you I \\•ill rec:ill my life \Vhich
certainly hns been hectic, but \Vhich
has been brimful and interc;ting. I
'viii \Yithhold nothing, baring my
loves, my disdain of kill-joy con,·cn·
tion, and Lhe startlingly h.ippy, uncx·
pcctcd results.
A tingle of delight passes through
my body now at the first memories-«
luxurious :ichc for n recurrence of
many of the exotic thrills I have

known, and to which, in some cases,
ooly tragedy put an end, while in
others satiety served Its purpose.
And ever you must keep in ntind, ns
I do, that this revelation is with the
fixed intent of teaching the youth of
today, as well as all the unseeing, un·
kno\\'ing multitudes for "'hon1 I have
ever felt pity for their blindness, what
joy may be found in true, untrammeled
love.
t nuy be theirs for the re:iching out
of a hand; a forgetting of some con·
ventions that arc so useless and reprcs·
si,•e. The adjur:ition corncs from one
lvho knows; from a \\·oman past the
haU century mark, but \vho, because
of Knowledge, is a! young and eager
in body, mind :ind soul a! she wn! the
d:iy her awakening adolescent eyes first
looked on 11 potcnti:il mate and found
him good.

Truly, I did not mind tho telling my husband pru1.
or it at nil. Whnt I did not wnnt to do wna to
gh'\l up 1
ny dentist. Ho was my first romance, ll!ld
I \vant:OO him.
An Adulteress
There 6Wl!led nothing to do but go through wfth the
matter, though, nnd I thought I might as well do It
In tho most approved dnunntlc mo.nncr. I was quite
In tho mood for it, too, for after my ~ence with tho
Dowie adhl!rellt, I was workod up to moat anything.
So, when I arrived home, I did not beat about the
bush. Quite M l\fnry f.fugdaleno hcraolf might hnve
done, I llu'tl\v myiiclC ot my husb:uid'a feet nnd con-
demned myr.clf.
"Do with me whnt you will!" I monned. "I bnvc
lifnnedI I run 1111 ndulwrossl Forgive mo! Ob, for-
aivol"
Evcn above my l!Ohs, I could hear bis Iiitlo chuckle.
For n few mlnuoos be did not RJ>Cllk. Th(lll:
"Get up oil' tho floor," ho111\ld. "Tbat'aa new whlto

dinner?"
Ile Doesn't Core
And that, as they MY todny, wn.• lhnt. No other
'"ord. He simply did not crut'. Only once more
did he refer wthemntt.cr that dny-as he \vns flni,hlng
dinner.
"Ho\V much do you owo thL' dcntlit fellow?" he
muoed.
I told hlm.
He wu:s silent, conshforlng, before he !l]>Oke.
..H.m-ml" he mid, lnslnuntlngly. ''Here'" a bit or

He did, too, I diacovt'l'Cd. And, though It wn., only
!ornn nrnlcnblc convcn;aUon, ending with nn lnvitnlion
to our hou.e !or my dentist, It WI\& enough lo ~poll
thinp for me. In lhe vemru:ular or lh<l dny. !rimd
dentist got cold feet.
Alrui !or Rolll!lncel I had !ollowod the 11pmtl&-but
Jost my lover.
I C.'Ulnot Poritct
Ah, well! As I look b:ick on It, ho wun't 1uch n
good lover alter all It WM my llJllJgiDlltlon l'lllJde
him one, moro tlmn nny great romanticism on hll own
pnrt. So ofoon that hM been the cnso In my ll!c. So
oft.en havo I wondered it the 00.t nnd grea~t o! my
thrills have not come through the exercise or my own
vhid lmngfnatlon mther lhnn In the realization that
has been vouchsafed me.
But I could notl50 eos{)y forget. That rom:inco hnd
meant so much to mo. Its denouement waa M> r.ordld.
It hurt.
I called on my pride, tried lo tell myPclf that if
n1y lover hnd c-.irod one whit 1111 much !or mo WI he hnd
I.old me when I lay In hill IU"lllS, lhnt nolbing-nothin11,
not even an outraged husbnnd (ond mine wns certainly
far from be1ng that) could keep us op:ut.
Eatlnii l\1y n enrt
There wasn't any doubt nbout It, however. l\Jy
dentist lover htul hnd enough. Be wns n!mid or my
husb:uid, il I v..ns not. ·NeverMall I forget hi$ pecvi."11·
ness and his berating me for telling or our rclnlioll.'l.
It wns the fmnl touch to m:llro what hnd f«'f!led ro
glorious, entirely sordid.
As is always the c:ise, though-a trite, ~old f:l)..
ing-lt was the wom.'UI who po.Id. I po.Id. Not with
the dramntics ll!ld hy-.;tmn that might lanve bec·n

~!\" LlFI·, IN 1\ LO\'E CL;J,T
BEFORErne there had been
but one ot11er Queen1
tbo11gh Dr. Latson 11ad never
been niggardly in the distri-
bution of his affections or sex
attractions. That latter had
aJl been very '\Veil and in
k eeping with his polygamous
Brahmanist belief.
I wns informed, where n~thclic dancing was taught
for the benutiCul development of the body. The
do.nces were lho ~1boli= or love.
There wns a doublil meaning to tha~ latter Wmi. To
t.11oro women who had engl!tly ncccpted initiution into
I.he ~.ec:ret love cult, the symbolism of love mC11I1t only
nn expreiSion or seic and desire. To those others whose
poor fuddled brains were in the clouds, the symbolism
cxpre:>Sed n love for all humanity.
Jrnlf Sexless llllm.'lnS
Dr. Latson wns clever in teacliing Urnt philosophy,
nnd n1ro his philosophy of humblene>.-.;. Bil wns
~inccre, too, I U1ink, in ro fnr as he wont. 'iVisc man
thnt he wr~", he knew only loo well thero do exist poor,
hnlf<.e."<l~~ humans to who1n tho desire:i or the flesh
hnvc no nppc11). but must get their snli~fnction from
1n!llltal exalt.'ltion.
Of course I ww; interested in l.he:e cln..~e:, inlere.>U!d
In hl!longing to them. But I must co.nJ'ess I held
townrd the otJicr membeni--women, of course--
a 1<0rt of patronizing allilude which l did not try
lo dh;guife.
Did l 11ot bave the right? Wns I not :!lrt-ad)• ll1e
choren one or lbc ?ilnsuir and IA!nchcr they all 'lldored
as ti supermnn?
Inexperienced Tltou~h ?.fnrrlcd
T had gone to him willingly; eagerly. Jn 1001'.ing
back on it, I wonder he did not laugh aL my naiv"11es.'I,
for all or the fu.ct lhnt I had been married nnd wa.~ a
motJ1t'r. I 'va_~ like ru1 untried girl nL my fm;t renli?.'l-

11. had been lovch•; lo\•cly to hear him pmL"C me-lo
mill'•-· ov!:l' my bt'!lutr, Cllclrilln ovl.'I' my shapclinc,;,i.
Ii hr«:! been keen d~light to hear him, in that drow~.
dr<::11ny voice or hi.~ spenkof my eyfl!I, my lip.;, my hair.
Dut thut lw.d been nt rum's lCJ1glli.
l Disrobe Defore Him
Never will I forg11t the fimt duy ho askoo me lo
disrobe. What a quick :;tab or unrea.'iOning mnid"11-
lin~ there c:unt: over me! \Yhy lll1ould I foci liko
U1nt? Why rear unyU1inc be 11!11.'ed me to do? Did
I nol love him'/ J knl'w l did, thouRh 1111 y~l no word
or love hnd eome from hi~ lip;•.
lluwn., ,J) 001lflitlcrnt.c. Tlis rrqurst to me wa& under
the cloak or hi& calling. Jt WWI nece:s."11')'. ho >:&id,
lhnl hc, n_q my phyrdcinn, mnlm n mool Ihorough
ph}'l'ical cimnrinnlion or me.
Tle opened a door k11ding from his biit front office,
Md hJs glnnco WM undcn;tanding, it compclling,
ns ho told me t.o !Ill into thnl other room. Jn
the n1iddlu or the floor or lhc great chamber l stood
for n row minute.;, wid~ycd, lil<l! a girl who hn& lx>.:n
mhcrl.'d into her bridal chamber to awnil ht'l' bride..
groom. I ms he!!itnnl; uncert.:lin. I did not under-
slmtd myself. But I did not know nil tha~ w·.i.• in
r;Loro for me.
I Am Sexually Starv~d
I dicl not stand long lherc, thinking. Slowly I
begnn w disrobe. I stood, 11 oomL'what shrinking
September l\fom, when U1e door opened. The doctor
Cl"O.iOOd tho threshold, and the door !l\\lllng to be-
hind him.
There wn.q nothing for which I wnsoorry wh{!Jl, later,
1 left him, with hi5 35511J"a11ce that. bis choicC«t vibra·
tions would follow me till we should meet again. I
knew lhaL wl1at he hnd lold me after that thorough
examination was right.. l had known it bl:!ore he told
me, but hnd not put it into word$. I Wt1$ ~Y
stnrved1 he mid, and even those experi1:11oo; I bad
hnd wero worse Ulan none.. 'Thero would ha no more

Society Lenders
And so, when I enga-ly joined in the dancing I was
ar-sured would make my body oven more desir-Jblc
Uuu1 it was, T rejoiced. I felt pity of a sort for lhOiie
who were not fnvored by the man of nlJ their henrts
ns l wns.
At first I looked on U1ooe "studt?nts" wilb ~urprise.
What n wonder my Dr. LC\b;on must be to have dr:1wn
to him people such ns I row there. Society l1::1der:; (I
recognized l'T1llDY from h.'1\-ing seen their pie~ in tho

Itwns the connection o! thcso two, Raoul Lovrony, n

nbout the downfull or the "abbey" Md Crowley and
lient him with his "iCl!llet bride" l!CUlt'Ylng into Ula
Crent Sahnm Desert until the horror of tho affair had
dil'd down.
The Children
I 1;1111t to I.ell first, though, o! whnt I considered the
WOl'llt horror o! lhe whole abbey nffnir. The children.
Thero w11ru t; number or them nmong the "1111pcnnen
and 5Uperwom~n" who were lenming conlt>m11t for

to Lwd1·0 or liO. They, too, were nil avidly nbiorbing
thll bill(u about "true wlils'' nnd bcing "mn.it<.n of

DEAR ?>lrss DOCKERILL:
I hnvc been going with a boy :Umoot n ye:ir. He i.i
nineteen yc:irs old o.nd I nm only t<ixl.ccn. He has a
brother, sevcntetn, whom I have gom: out with J!CVLT:il
times, but be does not wan~ me lo j,'O oul with his
brother. He is not jealow;, bul d«,; not Jik(• ml'.! to J.'O
out with other boya.
Tho older brother d006ll't like to go out in liOCicty,
but I do. The younger llkl.'S society nnd b(.'<°Dl., to b.l
rnoro lively nnd to care more about pleaauro thnn the
older.
I\ly best gir1 rri~nd's awt-cti11:.1rt chum.1 with Us~·
younger boy nnd she \\<ants me to go with LhC! youni:l.'r.
Please aC\ise me which one to go with, 1111 lhl'y nro
both nice boys, and both &'Cm to want to go with m~. ~
SALLY.

Dear &ll>', if I were you I would continue to go
with the older boy. There ~ to be little rroson
why you cannot be friendly with both, but lince the
older brother objt:ets to your i;eelng the younger, you
lihould hearken lo hli wishes out oC deference to your
long acquaint.'\IlctJ with him.
Fro_m your letter I gnther the impl't'S!-ion that the
older boy is much more !'<!ttled nnd tt-n.q'b]c than the
younger, who seems to be out only for plro.'IUre. The
older boy probably has n det:p fcc·ling for you.
It would be rather unfair to shift your nlt<"ntioll5
!rvm h" nin' tl'tn-yror-old boy to his brother just lJ<..
cause the brothC!r i;; mol'l' gny. U you loved tl:c
brother, it would be a different m.'ltter.

A p.·non lov~ ordoe; nol love; there is no such Uting

nice to eom:-<p0nd with a boy. A boy mn)' como to l!l'O
n girl 1l!I o(t.cn n.q bl! likes if sho does not makl! known

Thnl 1~ up to her. I don't sec how It is possible !or n
boy to love l1vo girl:;. If he can "love'' moro lhnn on1t,
It L~ not love nt nil. Just n liking that ho thinks is

or fourk'<~ mny Juve (,-id friends. \\'hy not? An
exchange o! girts ls alwnys n im-cet and thoughtful
thing.
But, dll:lf girl.;, nt your llgl!S I think you should

Tho old rule about marrying "for bl'ltl!I" or for wona:"
