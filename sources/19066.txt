it&#39;s tough to be here good so in 2012
there was said to be you know shift in
the way we think and for me that was the
case like consciousness the word
consciousness was in my head just
constantly and that led me down the path
to finding work so I&#39;m just wondering if
you&#39;ve noticed any increase in this kind
of interest in UFOs or if you think it&#39;s
just the grand scheme of the universe
well I don&#39;t know about 2012 per se but
it has in the last couple years gone up
exponentially every all the interest in
this I mean to the point that you even
have Lockheed Martin putting out
information that by 2020 something
they&#39;re going to have a fusion generator
that will run everything that was in the
past month so what what you things are
moving along and it has been a big move
up what I concerned about it it&#39;s sort
of like that you know the Hopi prophecy
where there&#39;s one timeline that
terminates and there&#39;s one that
continues on and we have to choose what
timeline we want to be on it&#39;s called
the prophecy rock or whatever it&#39;s this
etching that the hope is have have you
seen it it&#39;s really cool or disturbing
depending how you look at it but but and
I&#39;m reminded also you know Colin Andrews
is a very very good friend of mine the
crop circle guy of a crop circle that
appeared some years ago that had it was
where it&#39;s it was how all the planets
would be in the year 2036
but earth was not in its orbit earth was
missing it was sort of like a warning
now this is 2014 now that crop circle
appeared in like I don&#39;t know late 90s
or early 2000s but and I don&#39;t mean to
be apocalyptic and what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m
just saying that as the wonderful
Chinese expression goes unless we change
directions who are likely to end up
where we&#39;re going where are we going
where are we headed here so I think
that&#39;s one of the really you know
important things to realize and it can&#39;t
happen very very quickly this kind of
it&#39;s like in physics and they talk about
this with quantum systems is that you
get to a certain
critical mass of coherence like in super
fluidity and helium and like when 1% of
those molecules or atoms of helium are
aligned and become coherent instantly
all of them do and it because it becomes
what&#39;s called super fluidity and so you
have this phase transition is called in
physics and so that can happen also with
people and as Rupert Sheldrake pointed
out you know in in the whole concept of
morphogenetic fields it&#39;s sort of like
the hundredth monkey effect where
certain population learn something and
then when it reaches that critical mass
suddenly monkeys on other islands and in
other areas that had no linear contact
start automatically know how to do it
also so there&#39;s this nonlocality of
learning in large social systems and
they proven this with monkeys and
primates and also with humans so all I
can say is that if all of us do what we
should be doing we&#39;ll hopefully reach
that phase transition and move over to
this other way of functioning that makes
sense
you know but it does seem to be
increasing and so river showed great did
some really great he&#39;s a biologist at
Oxford I believe who did some wonderful
work on this in terms of morphogenetic
fields and what&#39;s more popularly called
the hundredth monkey effect and it&#39;s a
real phenomenon and and so we have to we
have to view it in a very pots while
people by people going out doing
meditation together making contact
putting even the thought or the intent
doesn&#39;t matter what you see just
intending to do the correct thing
recruits people you never know and meet
it has an effect beyond what we can
measure and and see and so you know it&#39;s
more important to do to be in the moment
and being the intent and the process
with a pure heart then to be worrying
about the outcome not that you don&#39;t
worry about the outcome you want to see
a good future but if you stay in that
process it&#39;ll create the good future
does that make sense yeah yeah
yes sir yeah you talk to your two
representative in g8 country see you bud
yeah yeah so he&#39;s asking about a one of
the g8 countries who very supportive of
the ce-5 initiative and it since it&#39;s
been a couple of years I&#39;ll talk about
it very directly the country is France
and so there was a president a couple
years of name ago named Nicolas Sarkozy
and Sarkozy the people who his
intelligence and Air Force people who
briefed him on all this stuff we&#39;re very
very interested in what we were doing
and one of the very old families in
France that actually organized the
beheading of Marie Antoinette true had
this old estate in Brittany and invited
us there so what we did a couple years
ago under the ruse of a training just a
weekend training is that nobody who came
knew this except a couple of people I of
course my wife knew she knows everything
we had this and of course I knew that it
was going to we used this 2,200 acre
estate and there were there was an
admiral there who&#39;s very high up and
also hid this Admiral has PhD and
physics and is also like myself an MD
very very very wonderful man and a
couple other people and a host family
who of course it was a very old French
Foreign Legion diplomats a family of
very very old French and so we did this
this is sort of a training but so also
so that the
the government of the friendly people in
the French government could learn the
protocols and see and so they were there
and then I heard back afterwards that
they had the whole area not cordoned off
but there was a security observational
security perimeter around it and they
tracked craft coming over the at two
hundred thousand kilometers an hour
during the c-5 and it was just a group
of novices most of them had never been
out and we had some amazing experience
including if you&#39;ve seen the photo we
were setting up one evening and I
everyone on decided this part of the
circle where I was sitting and we saw
this I was just setting up to do this
Sanskrit Vedic puja and there was this
like this like a rainbow light that came
in just an instant and so I had someone
take a photograph and there is this sort
of royal purple move colored fuzzy disc
hovering right above the field it&#39;s in
this photograph stunningly gorgeous not
quite in this dimension but not out of
it either on lavinda but everyone
looking that direction so this thing
flash in and and then we were sitting
there one night and this object came
over and then we had all the cars were
like 30 cars in this field because we
had like 60 people at this thing and
they all started turning their lights on
and off so this thing went over the
vehicle and it was like this is like
something out of a Close Encounters of
the Third Kind movie and of course you
know the Admirals going holy you
know and you know and we&#39;re in deep
meditation and all of a sudden we hear
this it right next to where the beyond
where the cars were this it was almost
like a metallic thing brushing up again
there was a craft that was quasi
materialized in the corner of the field
and later I went out and there were
these little beans over fell five of
them and you could hear now the problem
is everyone got up and it scared the
hell out of so you heard this scampering
off and so they scampered off and then
Dee materialized in thin air
sort of like that one that was in the
crop circle couple years ago where they
saw the feet and the police saw this
tall luminous white being that was fully
materialized and the police got out and
chased it and the footprint that just
disappeared into the field in thin air
you know that case where I was right
there when that happen yeah it&#39;s near
Silbury Hill anyway these expeditions
are awesome you won&#39;t come on me you
should come but but the point is is that
so they were very very interested now
from there in terms of bureaucracy
they&#39;re like in any government there are
people who are part of this magic or
Majesty group majestic has different
acronyms now it&#39;s called sig senior
inter agency group intelligence group
they some were friendly some are not
friendly and when you&#39;re talking about a
government moving off the dime on this
openly it&#39;s very difficult but it&#39;s a
again it&#39;s an iterative learning process
and so way I view it is that you know
see one do one teach one
you you you demonstrate it and then
hopefully and I know that they&#39;re
learning and probably they&#39;re practicing
it now the ethical construct and the
philosophical underpinning of it is that
it has to be done within the context of
universal peace it cannot be done within
the context of one national entity
evolving itself over another etc but I
know that you know this is not going to
be able to be done through the UN
because we tried that you know back when
Boutros boutros-ghali was un
secretary-general and i you know i&#39;m
they were very interested in his wife
came to one of the salons I held in New
York and then the Secretary General
after him Kofi Annan when we did
disclosure project originally they had
committed to hold the Disclosure Project
event at the Secretariat of the United
Nations but some folks came in with an
all-access pass and essentially
threatened to pull funding out of the UN
on behalf of a certain number of
countries and it would have destroyed
the UN and I was told I was called
directly
by an ambassador who is attached to the
UN secretary-general saying we wish you
well we support what you&#39;re doing but we
cannot do it at the UN and that&#39;s why it
was held here at the National Press Club
I have not told that story much so you
know I mean you look over the last 10 15
years have been a lot of initiatives
from the starts and stops from various
governments and so yeah there&#39;s a lot of
interest but if sort of like you know
that old saying everyone wants to be
first to be second you know there&#39;s a
hesitancy stick your neck out too far on
something very controversial as I
mentioned earlier but also on something
that has not just a social opprobrium
but where there&#39;s some very powerful
people who are not afraid of using their
power in retribution against an entity
that would do it this is why I tell
people the Beth you know to me the
clearest path forward for contact
disclosure and bringing these
technologies out or the people masses of
people doing it large corporations the
very rich governments you don&#39;t want to
be prejudicial against them which is why
I&#39;m like last year I was happy to go to
Australia and meet with all these folks
but you don&#39;t expect you don&#39;t you have
limited expectations you hope they do
the right thing but what I learned
starting back in the Clinton years is
that everyone wants to know about this
stuff very few people want to do
anything about it so knowing about it
and doing something about it are two
totally separate things and all we can
do I think all of each of us can do is
to provide the information the knowledge
the vision and let that gather amongst
the populace and also with world leaders
and other people and see where it goes
and I have a very not detached but a
very realistic so philosophically
and you know many people have said well
you know when it&#39;s disclosure gonna
happen I said what we did it already
and people think I&#39;m joking I said no
when we started this I&#39;m only about a
quarter or third that people thought
this was real now it&#39;s 50 some percent
last year the Marist Poll said that the
43 percent of you know of Americans
think that we&#39;re currently being visited
by Michelle or extraterrestrial beings
this huge number so I said in terms of
the public it&#39;s kind of there in terms
of official dumb and what I call the
hidebound inborn elite the sort of
inbred elite of the world there&#39;s you
know that&#39;s a harder thing to get
through and no smart part because of
both power politics but also more easily
as as this one Air Force witness told me
he says the real way this has been kept
secret it&#39;s just sheer ridicule the
subject you know you really don&#39;t have
to do or say anything it hides itself
because people don&#39;t want to be laughed
at people don&#39;t want to be put down by
their peers people don&#39;t want to be lose
esteem amongst their colleagues and
what-have-you so talk about courage the
biggest courage it takes for someone
who&#39;s interested in this is to speak the
truth in a way that it&#39;s appropriate you
can&#39;t bring everything out to someone
who doesn&#39;t know anything about it but
that&#39;s why we put disclosure project the
book and the videos together so that
anyone who&#39;s even at the level of the
most basic linear understanding will say
why or there&#39;s smoke there&#39;s fire
because here&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of
information from people who with
sterling credentials you know and there
is this sort of strange hypocrisy with
the mainstream media and that is if you
had three people who would go on record
with the New York Times or Washington
Post about a senior person at the White
House having sex with someone it&#39;d be
all over I have a hundred and ten people
on videotape and testimony with
corroborating documents with their
dd-214
which is their discharge papers from the
military with signed statements
witnessed oaths that they would testify
under oath before Congress with the
penalties of perjury federal penalties
of perjury and it gets ignored by all
the mainstream media you talk about a
double standard
so this is of course what we&#39;re up
against because the the big mainstream
media again not so much now some of them
are tied into quote the Cabal if you
want to call it that that keeps a secret
but most of them it&#39;s like this I have a
family member who will remain nameless
who used to be the city editor of the
Boston Globe and when she found out I
was getting involved with this stuff she
says I don&#39;t care if you put a dead
extraterrestrial body on my desk we&#39;re
not gonna run this story
we&#39;re a blue-chip paper that belongs in
the National Enquirer and it would never
appear in the boss I mean it&#39;s just like
that there&#39;s a family member so and and
this was not I assure you she&#39;s not
someone on the payroll of the CIA like
Donald Menzel was or
professor Condon so I think that we have
to understand that it is a real
educational process and putting together
the disclosure project information with
top-secret documents and military
witnesses and generals and ministers of
Defense and people who have credentials
and respectability as it were as pilots
or people who are a Strategic Air
Command that&#39;s very important and that
body of information is sitting there for
anyone to take virtually for free I mean
we have 60 some of these people&#39;s
testimony up on the site on YouTube now
for free you know so that is important
that all of us just share that with
folks when you get to governments in
these g8 you know it&#39;s very interesting
before I went over there I regret that
this wasn&#39;t actually in the film serious
they got the director took it out and I
don&#39;t know why but I have this beautiful
letter it&#39;s in French
from this Admiral and the team who wrote
about their commitment
to make a long-term commitment for this
journey with these visitors from other
star systems and amazing and it&#39;s
actually but from the Ministry of
Defense of France on their letterhead
signed it is the most important
government document history the UFO
subject there it sits in my vault but so
you know what I say to folks is that
over the last night was just years ago
that that process continues but it&#39;s
usually very quiet
you
