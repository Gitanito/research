  		              		Experience Description   

  I met a doctor for performing a Hijama (wet cupping) on me.  



 I was very scared as he put the suction cups on me and cut me two times. 

  Suddenly, I saw myself in a completely dark room with no knowledge of time or my location.  I felt myself floating with no ground or any other solid surface under my feet.  I started to ask questions, like 'where am I?' and 'what day is it?'  I couldn’t remember anything, even my own name.  I didn’t know who I was and nobody was answering my questions.  Then I saw a very tiny light that was far away from me.  Gradually fear took me completely and then I remembered my mother and started calling her.  I was very scared because she didn't answer me.  As I remembered who I was, the dark room was filled with colors.  It was like I was in a whirlwind or a vortex of colors.  

  Then slowly, I heard some strange voices that turned into screams and cries calling my name.  Then, I heard my mother calling my name.

  With difficulty, I opened my eyes.  I wasn't in the chair anymore, but was lying on the ground.  My mother was keeping my feet high over my head while the doctor was looking at me with fear.  He was shocked.  

  I felt a very bad pain in my chest and hands.  I was like there was a ton of weight on my body that was stopping me from standing up.  After a few minutes, the pain was gone and I could stand up.
