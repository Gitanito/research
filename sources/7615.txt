  		              		Experience Description   

    I remember when going under for open heart surgery. I saw  the doctors working on me and then losing me.  My soul went  into a white tunnel as I was guided by angels. There were  SO many beautiful and BRIGHT colors that we don’t have on Earth. I remember being welcomed and having an overwhelming sense of comfort and Happiness. Everything was perfect. We didn't need to breathe, eat or  sleep. There was  no pain.   All I needed to do was to be in the moment with a higher being. I met Jesus and he spoke to me. I asked him if I could stay because I felt so happy and loved being in that perfect place. He told me that it wasn’t my time yet; that I had a purpose. I begged and asked to stay. I  told him that the world was evil and cruel. Again,  he told me 'not yet'. I made it back to myself and woke up intubated.
