.158 .A.nnirersary Meeting• [Ja.n.19,
ANNIVERSARY MEETING.
The Annual General Meeting of the Society was held on
.January 19, 1883, at the Rooms of the Society.
The following Report of the Oouncil was read :-
The history of our Society, so far, is a short but a prosperous
.one. Originating at the Oonferences which were held a year ago
it commenced an organised existence last February. In July, a general
meeting, for the reading of papers and for discussion, was held, the
proceedings of which, with some supplementary matter, were published
as Part I. of the Society's Proceedings. In December last a second·~­
General Meeting was convened. The substance of the papers and reports
then read, together with an account of some more recent experiments,
will shortly be issued, as Part II. of the Proceedings.
The practical work of the Society has been carried on chiefly b:y
means of the Oommittees. Four of these-the Thought-transfel ence
Oommittee, the Haunted House Oommittee, the Mesmeric Oommittee,
and the Literary Oonunittee-have held many meetings, and have col-
lected a large body of evidence. The Reichenbach Oommittee has
recently commenced active operations, with valuable results.
The Oouncil are anxious to enlist the assistance of as many
Members as possible throughout the country in the active work of the
Society; and with this object are issuing a circular, containing hints
and directions as to the best means by which such assistance may be
rendered in the various branches of the research.
The Oouncil have been greatly encouraged by the rapid growth
of the Society during the first year of its existence, looking not
merely at the number who have joined as Members and Associates, but
at the distinction of some among them. The amount of correspondence -
also increases every month, and testifies to a very widespread interest
in Psychical Research. The work already done by the Society, and the
position it has attained, justify the Oouncil in believing that an
important place, long vacant in organised research, has been, and will
continue to be, effectively filled by it.
The numbers of the Society at the close of the year 1882 were:-
Members, 107 j Associates, 38; Honorary Members, 5; total, 150.
The Oouncil are greatly indebted to Dr. W. H. Stone for his
liberality in the arrangements which they have made with him for the
ease of the Society'S Rooms, at 14, Dean's Yard, Westminster. They
feel that this local establishment, together with the further facilities

.for experiment which Dr. Stone is both able and willing to afford, will
tend greatly to promote the objects of the Society.
The President of the Society (Mr. Henry Sidgwick) has generously
presented it with a collection of about 150 volumes of psychical
literature, which will form a valuable nucleus for a library. It need
hardly be said that the Council will gratefully aecept any further
contributions of this kind.
A few alterations in the Rules and Constitution of the Society
have commended themselves to the Council since last February. They
now ask the Meeting to confirm these alterations according to the
provisions of Rule 24.
A Statement of Receipts aild Expenditure made up to the 31st
-of December, 1882, is herewith presented.
The thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors•.
