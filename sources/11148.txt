I was in a car accident, where my ribs were broken just before I died. As I slipped from my body, I was standing all of a sudden in an area filled with red and green flowers. Off a little way was a building and a man standing there. He told me to go to the window. I was amazed and confused about where I was; and wondering how I got there from just being in a car wreck a minute ago. I went to the window and they told me it's not my time and to go back. I went back to where I was standing when I first got there. The next thing I knew I was in the car accident again, back in pain once again.
