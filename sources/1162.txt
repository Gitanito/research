MEETING OF THE COUNCIL.
THE 69th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover
Square, W., on Monday, December 5th, 1904, at 3 p.m.; the
President, Professor Barrett, in the chair. There were also
present : Mr. W. W. Baggally, the Hon. E. Feilding, Sir Law
rence Jones, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. F.
Podmore, Mr. A. F. Shand, Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Mr. H. Arthur
Smith, Lieut-Colonel Le M. Taylor, Mrs. A. W. Verrall, and
Miss Alice Johnson, Secretary.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as
correct.
Five new Members and nineteen new Associates were
elected. The election of two new Members and thirty-one
new Associates of the American Branch was recorded. The
names and addresses are given above.
The monthly account for October was presented and taken
as read.
After discussing other business, the Council adjourned.
PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
THE tenth of the series of Private Meetings for Members and
Associates only was held in the large hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Monday, December 5th, at 4 p.m. ;
the President, Professor Barrett, in the chair.
THE PRESIDENT informed the meeting that the Council had
invited Professor Charles Richet to be President of the Society
for the year 1905, and that Professor Richet had accepted
the invitation. The President also announced the receipt of
two further contributions to the Endowment Fund, viz., £2 2s.
from Miss A. E. Bell, and £1 19s. from a Member of the
Society who wished to remain anonymous.
LiEUT.-CoLONEL LE M. TAYLOR then read a paper, illus
trated by diagrams, on " Various Spiritualistic Phenomena
witnessed by the Author." He divided the phenomena into
three classes: (1) psychical phenomena, involving no inter
ference with physical laws aa accepted by science; (2)
physical phenomena, such as the spontaneous movement of
JAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 5
material inanimate objects, " spirit-lights," or "materialisations";
(3) cases in which a purposive human-like intelligence is
manifested in connection with abnormal physical phenomena.
He then gave instances of each class. In the first case
quoted, at a sitting held at the house of a lady whom he
knew well, the medium being her servant, two chairs on
which the medium and a lady by her were seated moved
away from the table with the sitters on them, and continued
to move when the sitters got up and returned to the table,
till they rested at points from 4 to 8 feet from the table.
The chairs then moved back towards the table without any
apparent contact. A chair in the middle of the room, with no
one near it, also moved and fell down.
In the second case, at a sitting held with " Mrs. Marriott,"
Colonel Taylor saw a " spirit-light," like the flame of a candle,
on the table near him, and put out his hand to catch it.
When his fingers had nearly closed round it, it slipped out
between them, floated away, and disappeared.
In the third case, during supper after a sitting with " Mrs.
Marriott," who sat by Colonel Taylor at supper, knocks were
heard in various parts of the room and on his chair. He
then pushed his chair away from the table, so as to leave a
clear space round it, after which he both heard and felt raps
on various parts of it. By means of these raps the replies
" yes " or " no " to both mental and spoken questions of
his were obtained, and thus some intelligence was manifested.
In the fourth case, at a sitting held at his own house
with two friends of his own, whom he called Mrs. and Miss
Hope, a table with books on it was placed behind the medium,
Miss Hope, and another table with a zither on it behind the
first. Eaps then occurred on both these tables and on the
wood of the zither, but not in any case on its strings.
Some of the raps were heard on the places where the sitters
asked that they should sound, and some answered questions.
The two last cases were of the psychical class. The first
of these occurred at a sitting held with the medium " Walters."
The medium became entranced, and one of his " controls "
gave a fairly good description of Colonel Taylor's wife.
Another "control" then stated that Colonel Taylor had two
pictures of her, on glass, in a box, and described the picture
6 . Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., iao5.
and the dress and attitude of the sitter in detail. None of
the persons present, besides Colonel Taylor himself, had ever
known his wife, who had died sixteen years previously. He
could not at the time think of any picture on glass iii his
possession, but a week later remembered that he had taken a
photograph of his wife on glass, and with some difficulty
succeeded in finding it, as well as the original negative ; and
he then found that it corresponded closely with the description
given by the medium.
In the last case, at a sitting held in Colonel Taylor's house
at Cheltenham a " control," purporting to be his wife, made
a remark about her sister in Canada which seemed a very
appropriate reference to an incident that had taken place the
night before, of which none of the sitters knew anything at
the time.
Full details of all these cases are given in Colonel Taylor's
paper, which it is hoped will be published later.
THE PRESIDENT then gave a brief account of several cases
whi'li had come under his own notice some time ago and
had been recorded by himself at the time. In the first case,
he had had a large number of sittings in 1875 with some
friends of his own, Mr. and Mrs. C., and their young
daughter, who appeared to be the medium. The sittings were
held generally in the morning and in full daylight, so that it
was possible for him to watch closely the feet and hands of
the sitters. The phenomena consisted chiefly of raps, which
were heard sometimes on the table and sometimes on the
chairs of the sitters, and once on a table near the medium
but not in contact with her. The raps manifested intelligence,
words being spelt out through them, but it was interesting
to observe that the intelligence never seemed superior to that
of the medium. Thus, one day a word was misspelt by the
raps, just as the child herself would have misspelt it, as he
afterwards ascertained. The phenomena occurred equally well
when no one was present except the child and himself. The
lifting of a heavy dining-room table also occurred under
these circumstances, the tips of the fingers only resting on
the table.
In a second case, which he had observed in 1877, the
medium was a Miss I. In this case, at a sitting held in
JAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates 7
the evening with one gaslight burning in the room, and there
fore plenty of light, raps were also obtained on the table,
both with and without contact of the hands of the sitters
with the table, and these raps also showed intelligence. At
the same sitting movements of the table, without any contact
whatever, were obtained. The sitters lifted their hands off
the table and sat back in their chairs with their arms folded,
their feet being in full view. The table then raised two of
its legs completely off the ground some 8 or 10 inches, and
thus suspended itself for a few moments. It then did the
same with the other two legs. While remaining free from
contact with the sitters, the table then moved backwards and
forwards, advanced towards Professor Barrett and rose up close
to him. Similar phenomena occurred at a sitting in his
own house when Miss I. and he alone were present and
with abundant light in the room. The medium was not paid
and gave the sittings at considerable inconvenience to herself.
The third case occurred with the well-known professional
medium, Mr. Eglinton, at the house of Mr. Hensleigh Wedg
wood in 1878. To this, of course, he (the speaker) attached
less importance on account of the grave suspicion which after
wards fell upon Eglinton in connection with his slate-writing
performances. Nevertheless, in justice to Eglinton, it ought to
be said that at this particular seance in Mr. Wedgwood's house
«very precaution which experience had up till then taught was
resorted to, both by the speaker and by Mr. Myers, who was
also present, to prevent the possibility of trickery. Not only
were Eglinton's arms tied securely behind him and to a book
case behind, but the curtains which were drawn across his
body when he was seated in a chair were left open in the
centre, so that the middle of his body could be seen. Books
were then placed in a pile on his lap and a small hand
bell on the top. Sufficient light was left in the room to
read the second hand of a watch. The sitters then saw the
leaves of the middle book opened and other movements occur
without any visible motion on the part of the medium, and
the fastenings were intact when examined afterwards. A
description of the whole sitting, taken from notes made at the
time, is given in the Proceedings S. P. R., Vol. IV., p. 36. The
speaker begged to draw the attention of the members to the
8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905.
full account of these three cases which he gave in his paper pub
lished in that volume of the Proceedings.
He also described another case of remarkable physical
phenomena which occurred in a hotel in Edinburgh, witnessed
by General and Mrs. Boldero, the medium being a lady
friend of Mrs. Boldero's, and the conditions and occurrences
having been carefully noted at the time. Finally he referred
to the case of D. D. Home, through whose mediumship amazing
physical phenomena were obtained under circumstances which,
in his opinion, rendered fraud inconceivable. He especially
recommended for study the case recorded in the Jmmial
S. P. It., Vol. IV., p. 124 ct. seq., given in an appendix to a
paper on Home which he (the speaker) had written in con
junction with Mr. Myers.
Various hypotheses had been suggested to account for these
extraordinary phenomena. Long ago he had been inclined to
think that some hallucination on the part of the sitters, or
some hypnotised state on their part, would account for what
was observed,—the medium suggesting what was supposed to
take place and the sitters then thinking they saw it and sub
sequently describing it as having actually occurred. In fact,
numerous experiments made by himself on suggestible subjects
supported this conclusion, which he had ventured publicly to
advocate nearly thirty years ago. But in the cases above cited
and in others, this theory had been kept in view and found
in his opinion to be hopelessly inadequate, and he now un
hesitatingly abandoned it, though as a possible vera causa it
ought to be remembered and guarded against. Another theory
was mat-observation on the part of the sitters. This un
doubtedly was a source of frequent error, as shown in Mr.
Davey's remarkable experiments recorded on p. 405 et seq. of
the Proceedings, Vol. IV. Again, as Mrs. Sidgwick showed
in the paper which she contributed to the same volume of
the Proceedings, erroneous interpretation,—which arises from con
fusing what is observed with what is inferred—the failure
to distinguish between facts and inferences from facts,—is very
common at stances. To this all of us are specially liable when
the sitting is carried on in darkness or in a dim light.
Notwithstanding the weight which properly attaches to these
and other explanations that have been given of spiritualistic
JAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 9
phenomena, the speaker had been led to abandon them as in
adequate to account for all that took place, and he had been
driven to the conclusion that intelligent, self-determined, and
apparently self-conscious agencies existed in the unseen—in a
word, unseen personalities—which could, in some manner utterly
unknown to us, operate on material objects, and also on the sub
conscious self of the so-called medium. Beyond this he was
not at present prepared to go, though the evidence of identity
was growing in value.
In the course of the discussion that followed, DR. J. H.
GOWEE described some experiences of his own in a private
circle of his friends at Denver, Colorado, where he had held a
number of sittings for physical phenomena in 1902 and 1903.
They had often obtained raps, both with and without contact,
and intelligible messages spelt out thereby, and they also
obtained on several occasions movements of a heavy table
without contact with any of the sitters and in a good light.
On one occasion, an extension table on a central pedestal,
which divided when the table was extended, moved by itself,
leaving a space of about 8 inches between its two parts, and
on being requested to close again, began to do so without
any one touching it, but stopped when it was about half
closed. The sitters then placed their fingers upon the edge
of it, and it then closed completely. On the same occasion,
the sitters requested that various liquids on the table should
be shaken by the force ; for instance, the water in a water
jug, and the whiskey in a bottle. Each of these shook
successively in response to the request, and without being
touched in any way by the sitters. When standing at a
distance from the table, the sitters also requested that a
pencil on it should be moved backwards and forwards. This
was done, and on one occasion the pencil rolled off the table.
Mi:. W. W. BAGGALLY described some experiences in slate
writing with the medium Eglinton in full day light on a
summer's afternoon.
During the sitting Eglinton called the attention of Mr.
Baggally to some spirit photographs which lay on the table,
when the position of the photographs necessitated the turning
away of the sitter's head from the side where the medium sat.
This did not, however, prevent Mr. Baggally from watching
1 0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905
Eglintou, as by bending his head at the time of pretending
to examine the photographs he was able to have a slanting
look at the medium's movements. Mr. Baggally saw Eglinton
deliberately read a private question addressed to the spirits,
which Mr. Baggally had written on a slate. This was at the
commencement of the sitting. A suspicious circumstance, also,
was that Eglinton several times said " the spirits are pulling
the slate." When making use of this expression, the medium's
hand which held the slate disappeared under the table.
Mr. Baggally concluded that the writing had been done
by means of a small slate pencil, which either was attached
to a prepared thimble or held under the nail of one of the
medium's tingers. The writing would be on the under sur
face of the slate, at the end nearest to the medium's body ;
and when he said " the spirits are pulling " and his hand
disappeared, it was in order to enable him to reverse the
slate, so that the writing would then appear on the upper
surface, at the end farthest away from the medium. Mr.
Baggally obtained a good deal of writing, but always in this
position. The sound of writing which was subsequently heard
could have been produced by scratching the surface of the
slate with a finger nail.
Mr. Baggally said that he had also witnessed a heavy dining-
room chair move towards him, without contact, in the presence
of Eglinton—in broad daylight—but thought it possible that
the chair legs had iron bars in them, and that the movement
was caused by a powerful electro-magnet beneath the floor of
the room, worked by a confederate, since the performance took
place at Eglinton's own house, and he would have had every
opportunity of preparing a space below the floor in which a
confederate could place a magnet. Eglinton himself, previous
to this experiment, moved the chair from the side of the room
and placed it in the middle on a spot which might have been
previously known to a confederate. Mr. Baggally, however,
admitted that some things that he had witnessed in Eglinton's
presence appeared inexplicable.
Silt OLIVER LODGE, in reference to Mr. Baggally's suggestion
that Eglinton might have moved the chair by means of an
electro-magnet, said that this would certainly be possible if
iron bars had been concealed in the legs, and if the magnet
JAN., 1905. Private Meeting for Members aiul Associates. 11
could have been brought up close under the floor ; but mani
festly far simpler appliances could be devised for the purpose
of producing apparently abnormal movements. No such expla
nation could be applied to the cases described by the President,
since in them the mediums had no opportunity of preparing
apparatus beforehand ; and the fact that a Physicist had
observed them made them specially important. Supposing
that occurrences of this kind ever became well-established
and accepted by science, they need not involve any revolu
tion in scientific theories of matter, though they would lead
to an extension of our knowledge of human faculty. Even
now we are entirely ignorant as to how by exerting our
wills we are able to move material objects,—even our own
bodies, and through them objects in contact with them.
To be able to move objects without contact is not a priori
more improbable, since it is difficult to form any clear concep
tion of what is meant by " contact " between mind and
matter. The difficulty of believing the asserted occurrences
arises from the fact that there is such comparatively scanty
evidence for their occurrence ; though it must be admitted
that the evidence is continually growing both in amount and
impressiveness.
With regard to the medium Eglinton, he had once had
a series of sittings for slate writing with him, arranged for
by the late Edmund Gurney, once in the company of Balfour
Stewart, once with Mr. C. C. Massey, and many times with
Mr. Gurney. At the first sitting, though he took his own
slate, he for the most part simply attempted to observe
what happened—not to impose any test conditions—and one
word of writing was obtained. At the remainder of the
sittings, he attached the slate by a piece of string to one
of his fingers before entering the house, and kept it attached
till he left ; under these circumstances a single letter of the
alphabet was all the writing he ever obtained.
OPENING OF AN ENVELOPE CONTAINING A POST
HUMOUS NOTE LEFT BY MR. MYERS.
ON December 13th, 1904, Sir Oliver Lodge invited the
Members of the Council and a few other Members of the
12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905.
Society to the Society's Booms at 20 Hanover Square ta
witness the opening of a sealed envelope which had been
sent to him by Mr. Myers in January 1891 (nearly four
teen years ago), in the hope that after his death its contents
might be given by communication through some medium.
It had been decided to open it because various statements
made in Mrs. Verrall's automatic script during the last three
years had led her to infer that it contained a certain phrase.
The apparent references to this posthumous note had begun
vaguely, and gradually developed, with some repetition, into
what seemed to be a clear and definite statement of what
was contained in Sir Oliver Lodge's envelope. The references
to the envelope purported to come from Mr. Myers, and were
mixed up with writing, some of which appeared to be veridical,
relating to other topics, especially with a statement—written
before the publication of Human Personality—that a certain pas
sage would be found in that book when published. This having
been verified, it was hoped that the account given by the script
of the contents of the envelope might turn out equally correct.
The meeting was summoned by a circular, of which the
annexed is a copy :
MARIEMONT, EDGBASTON, December, 1904.
It is probably known to you that some years ago F. W. H.
Myers deposited with me an envelope containing some sort of writ
ing or message, to be posthumously deciphered if possible.
It is also known to you that Mrs. Verrall developed the faculty
of automatic writing soon after Myers' death. It now appears that
she believes hernelf to have received messages or indications as to
the contents of this envelope. This impression of hers may, of
course, be mistaken, but the advantage of it is that it is definite,
and she is able to put into writing what she thinks the contents of
the envelope will be found to be.
That being so, I have taken advice, and find a general consensus
of opinion that it is time now to open the envelope and verify or
disprove the agreement ; or, if there is partial agreement, to
ascertain its amount.
The envelope has been for some time deposited in a bank, but I
propose to have it handed back to me some time this week, and to
bring it up to London on Tuesday, December 13th, and then, at
4 p.m., in the rooms of the Society for Psychical Research, 20'
JAN., 1905. Posthumous Note left by Mr. Myers. 13
Hanover Square, after making a statement regarding it and reading
Mrs. Yen-all's statement of what she believes to be in it, to open
it in the presence of a sufficient number of witnesses. I do not
propose to do it at a Council meeting, because I think it desirable
that one or two outsiders should be present, inasmuch as I wish
the event to be known and "counted," whether it turn out suc
cessful or the reverse. The only way to avoid chance coincidence
is to determine beforehand whether any given event shall " count "
or not ; and, subject to anything that may happen between now
and then, I propose that this shall count and that the envelope
shall then be opened.
I invite you, therefore, if you think fit, to come to the rooms of
the Society on Tuesday, December 13th, at 4 p.m.
It must be understood that the proceedings are confidential, and
that the question of subsequent publication must be reserved for
the Council of the Society. OLIVER LODGK.
Mrs. Verrall first reported to the meeting the conclusions
she had been led to form concerning the envelope from her
own script, and read the apparently relevant passages. On
the envelope being opened, however, it was found that there
was no resemblance between its actual contents and what was
alleged by the script to be contained in it.
It has, then, to be reported that this one experiment has
completely failed, and it cannot be denied that the failure is
disappointing. Considering, however, how very few experi
ments of this kind have ever, so far as we know, been tried
at all, and how great, on any hypothesis, must be the
obstacles to success, it would be unreasonable either to
relax our efforts on account of this single failure or because
of it unduly to discount the other matter contained in Mrs.
Verrall's script which there is any reason to regard as evi
dential. It is hoped that a detailed report of the script will
be published before long.
Meanwhile, the Council have reason to believe that there
may be several other persons in possession of sealed envelopes
left by Mr. Myers before his death for their contents to be
deciphered, if possible, afterwards. If this is the case, they
would be very glad if any such persons would communicate
the fact to them, or preferably send the envelopes to the
Secretary to be deposited at the Rooms of the Society.

CASE.
L. 114o. Auditory.
THE following case of an apparently telepathic impression
comes from an Associate of the Society, Mr. Clissold, and
was sent to us, enclosed in a letter dated September 20th,
1904, by Colonel Taylor, to whom Mr. Clissold and his
daughter have been known for some years.
Mr. Clissold writes :
RAVENSWORTH, CHELTENHAM,
September 14tt, 1904.
On Saturday, September 10th, I was in my daughter's garden
pruning some trees. I had just completed my work about 7 p.m.
when I distinctly heard my daughter's voice calling me, '•
when are you coming down 1 " using a familiar name by which no
one but she addresses me. I looked all round me and could see no
one, so I called to her several times, but receiving no answer
supposed that she. had called me and then gone home.
However, when I got to the bottom of the garden, a distance
of about 40 yards from where I was pruning, I found her at work
among her flowers, and on asking her why she had called me,
she said " I never called you at all, but I was thinking of you
very much a short time ago and thought I must call you, but I
did not." It is perfectly certain that I heard her voice distinctly,
and it is equally certain that my daughter did not call me. I
write this simple account as it may be possible that other people
may have met with occurrences of a similar nature. Is it within
the bounds of probability that thought can, under certain conditions,
be transferred into audible sound 1 E. M. CLISSOLD.
Mr. Clissold's daughter writes :
ROCK HOUSE, FOAVNHOPE, HEREFORD.
ON Saturday, September 10th, I was tying up chrysanthemums
near our house and father was pruning trees about 40 yards from
where I was working, but out of sight. I kept on thinking I would
call him to come down, as he had not been well in the morning,
and I was afraid he would be over tired, but I knew he hated to
be worried. For about half an hour I thought of nothing else but
whether I should call him or not, and suddenly I saw him just
JAN., 1905. Ca8C. 15
above me, and he said, " Why did you call me ? " I said " I did
not call you, but for some time I have been thinking of doing
so." If I had called him, I should not have made use of the
familiar name he said I used, as I knew the gardener was working
close by. My husband went up since, and stood listening at the
exact spot where my father stood. I called as loud as I could to
him from the spot where 1 was working when my father heard
me call him, and he could only hear me faintly; he was expecting
it and listening for the call. My father was pruning at the time
and not expecting to be called, and he is also a little deaf. I
enclose a section of the ground showing our positions and the
intervening features of the ground. ALICE PURDON.
The section referred to shows a number of terraces, rising
one above another, terminated by walls covered with ivy,
between Mr. Clissold and his daughter. Mr. Clissold was at
the far end of the highest terrace, and his daughter on the
lowest, at a level of 38 feet below where he was standing,
and at a distance of 124 feet measured horizontally from a
point 08 feet vertically below him. Supposing, therefore, that
she had unconsciously uttered her thought aloud, it seems quite
impossible that he should have heard it.
ME. F. 0. MATTHEWS.
IT has been brought to our notice that an American medium,
calling himself the " Eev." F. 0. Matthews, who is now
visiting London, has made various inaccurate statements as to
his having some connection with our Society. We think it
desirable therefore to let our members know that these state
ments are entirely unauthorised, and without any foundation.
In handbills printed to advertise some meetings held by
Mr. Matthews at Coventry and Leamington, the following
sentence occurs :
" The Eev. F. 0. Matthews has been associated with Lord
Kelvin, Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr. Alfred Eussell Wallace, the late
Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, Professor Huxley, and other
eminent men in psychic research."
The absurdity of part of this assertion is manifest, and
Sir Oliver Lodge asks us to state that he has never had
16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1905.
any sitting with Mr. Matthews or been associated with him
in any way.
In some other cases, persons with whom Mr. Matthews
professes to have sat tell us that they have no recollection of
the circumstance.

GENEEAL MEETING.
THE 124th General Meeting of the Society was held in the
large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday,
February 6th, 1905, at 8.30 p.m. The chair was at first
occupied by Professor Barrett, who introduced to the meeting
38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1906.
the newly elected President, Professor Charles Eichet, Professor
of Physiology in the Paris Faculty of Medicine, referring briefly
to the eminent services which he had rendered to the cause of
psychical research and his courageous support of the Society
in its early days.
THE PRESIDENT then took the chair and delivered (in French)
an Address, of which the following is a summary :
Though a foreigner, I am not a stranger to the Society, but
was interested in its work from the beginning, having already
recognised that classical physical science did not afford an
adequate view of the mystery underlying the phenomenal world.
The change in sentiment towards these studies during the last
30 years is remarkable. In 1875 not one of the so-called
' occult ' phenomena,—somnambulism, animal magnetism, hypno
tism, etc.,—was officially accepted. Notwithstanding Sir W.
Crookes's studies, spiritism was universally scouted as unworthy
even of refutation. The spiritists themselves were more devoted
to the spinning of theories than to the establishment of facts,
and their vague accounts of the phenomena justly provoked
scepticism. Scientific ' psychical research ' is necessarily scepti
cal. We do not shrink, when we have reached certitude, from
proclaiming it. But science does not consist of the establish
ment of a single fact, nor even of several. The isolated facts
must be co-ordinated, proved and elucidated by repetitions.
The change in public sentiment is largely due to the labours
of the S.P.E. and the association with it of eminent men.
There is now an immense mass of material, and it is time that
a text-book dealing synthetically with the facts of ' occult
science' should be provided. 'Occult science,' however, is an
unsatisfactory term. All sciences at their outset are occult,
and only cease to be so when they become further advanced.
Nor is ' psychical science ' a happy term. The ^^xi is not
involved in many of its manifestations. ' Spiritistic science '
is worse, inasmuch as the spirit hypothesis, notwithstanding its
somewhat naif simplicity, is not, on the whole, acceptable. I
propose, with all the hesitancy that becomes one when venturing
on a neologism, a new term—' metapsychical science,' on the
analogy of the word " metaphysics."
My suggested text-book of this science would deal with
phenomena (a) purely psychical, (&) purely material, (a) includes
MAR., 1905. General Meeting. 39
phenomena involving no vibration or movement of matter, such
as premonitions, telepathy, etc. (6) includes phenomena import
ing some force acting on matter, such as raps, apportx, material
isations, etc. Sometimes (a) and (6) intermingle, as e.g. &
premonition given by raps without contact
To produce the material phenomena the action of some un
known physical force must be supposed. This supposition in
volves no a priori absurdity, for the known forces of nature are
as nothing compared with the unknown. One of the simplest of
material phenomena is that of raps produced without contact.
After eliminating all possible explanations through fraud, mal-
observation, etc., there remain a large number of cases where
raps, inexplicable by chance or by contractions, have been heard
in a table which no one is touching. It may not be surpris
ing that classical science has been rigorous in demanding proof
of such phenomena. But it is less to its credit that it should
be content to judge and to deny without serious experiment.
Patience is required, and a few negative experiments do not
settle the question. But the history of metapsychics is full of
cases where competent scientific observers, after years of patient
investigation, with many checks, doubts, reactions, have ended
in conviction. This path is not one of flowers, but is strewn
with stones, and those who adventure on it often have cause
for regret that they did not remain content with the prudent
but more cowardly course of slumbering either in the simple
and blind credulity of the spiritists, in the solemn and negative
disdain of the scientists, or in the self-satisfied and apathetic
indifference of the great majority of men.
Assuming the existence of the ' material ' phenomena, con
temporary science is not thereby imperilled. But a difference
appears between these forces and those already recognised by
science. They are intelligent, and hence arises a formidable
problem. Are they human or extra-human ? I see no a priori
scientific reason against the latter hypothesis, but there seems
no necessity as yet for accepting it. The discussion is, however,
premature ; facts must precede theories, and we must proceed
experimentally to ascertain the conditions of a phenomenon
before considering its cause.
When we come to the psychical phenomena, the method of
study must be quite different, the object being the analysis of
40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1906.
psychological facts. A man's knowledge is derived from sensa
tions and inferences from them. I may be aware of the death
of A. B. because I have witnessed it or because I have been told
of it, or because, knowing him to be ill, I infer it. Such
knowledge would be adequately explained by the laws of
ordinary perception and reasoning. But if, having recently
left A. B. in perfect health, I am able suddenly to affirm him
to be dead at the moment when an unforeseen blow has struck
him, we enter the region of metapsychics. Immaterial meta-
psychical phenomena may thus be denned as those having an
origin other than in our normal perceptive and reasoning facul
ties. A few cases may be explained as due to chance, but by
far the most fertile source of error in experiments in this type
of metapsychical phenomena is not chance, but unconscious
memory. Formerly a sharp 'line was drawn between the things
one remembered and the things one did not. But the study
of hypnotism has now shown that memory is an inexorable
faculty of our intelligence, and that none of our perceptions
are ever truly effaced from it. The recollection of them
slumbers, but remains indelible. The consciousness may forget ;
but the intelligence cannot.
This unconscious, or in Myers's phrase, ' subliminal,' memory
is ever wakeful and attentive, mingling with our sentiments and
our conduct, acting, reasoning; constituting our veritable 'ego';
but with this advantage over our conscious ' ego ' of being
incapable of ever losing track of even the smallest particle of
what, in our lives, men and circumstances may have brought
to us. If we could but contemplate the immense mass of
recollections of which our sub-conscious memory is the vigilant
guardian we should find treasures of which we are in complete
ignorance. Thus often cases of so-called ' lucidity ' are really
but products of our sub-conscious memory, however honestly
we may believe in and maintain our complete ignorance of the
facts concerned.
Among these alleged phenomena we find : Lucidity or clair
voyance ; either telepathic (i.e. the supernormal knowledge by
one mind of a fact contained in the consciousness of another)
or clairvoyance pure (i.e. the supernormal knowledge of a
fact unknown to any other person). Each of these may
occur experimentally or spontaneously. Experimental lucidity
MAR., 1905. General Meeting.
is unhappily rarer than spontaneous or occasional lucidity.
(Experiments with contact, such as ' thought-reading,' so-called,
or ' willing,' must of course be disregarded.) But though neither
can be reproduced at will, there is strong evidence at least for
the latter. On the other hand, experiments in lucidity, especially
in cases where chance can be accurately calculated, e.g. random
selections from a pack of cards, are of far greater value.
Apparitions at the time of death, which are to be classed
among cases of spontaneous lucidity, seem as well established
as the fall of a meteorite, but unfortunately are as little capable
of experimental repetition. Such apparitions are to be regarded
as purely hallucinatory. The event penetrates the consciousness
of the percipient, and then reveals itself in the symbolic form
of an apparition, or of an auditory hallucination. It appears
to me certain that particular individuals, so-called mediums,
are more capable than others of supernormal perception, but
I find it difficult to believe that between them and the rest of
humanity a hard line is drawn and that we are not all more
or less susceptible to the same influences.
The personations or ' controls ' of mediums may be regarded as
a special class of lucidity. Mrs. Piper and Professor Flournoy's
Mile. Smith exhibit types of this class. The normal personality
of the medium disappears, and another, completely different,
enters upon the scene. Our first tendency is to believe in
the reality of these personalities. But they are precisely
similar to the cases of secondary personality occasionally
produced under hypnotism, when there is no question what
ever but that they are merely variations of the subject's own
intelligence. May not these ' controls ' which play so large
a part in spiritism really be phenomena of just the same
class? For if to an ordinary hypnotic secondary personality you
were to add a certain admixture of lucidity you would
get a complete imitation of the Piper phenomena. There
seems to be no way in which the affirmation by one of
these personalities that he is so-and-so can possibly carry
complete conviction.
Premonitions, philosophically considered, seem the most per
plexing of all the alleged phenomena. We should not, how
ever, be deterred by mere strangeness. The question is not
whether a particular fact would upset our conception of the
42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1905.
universe, for that conception is but a sadly childish affair.
The real question is to ascertain whether, as I am tempted
by my own experience to believe, there are in fact authentic
cases of this kind.
I conclude that though much has been done, there remains
much more to do. There are indeed but few of the alleged
metapsychical phenomena on which all doubt has been triumph
antly dissipated,—perhaps but two or three elementary ones
which we can claim as definitely established, as, for example,
raps without contact, or veridical hallucinations. Even these,
though to us they may seem to have been well enough proved,
have not yet been accepted by official and classical science,
and we have still great efforts to make in order to gain for
them recognition. Hence our reserve in the matter of theory.
Not but what many theories have been propounded, but all
seem sadly insufficient. We have seen that it seems probable
that certain unknown forces act both upon matter and upon the
human intelligence. Two hypotheses are suggested : that these
forces are either inherent in the human body or extra-human.
The former hypothesis presupposes that our nervous organism
has the power of exteriorising itself by ' telekinesis ' or action
at a distance, and of perceiving external things by ' telepathy '
or supersensuous faculty. If the forces are extra-human, this
means that there are intelligent forces capable of interference in
our world, of moving material objects and of acting on our
thoughts. This hypothesis implies that the intelligences belong
either to beings different from men, or to men who have once
lived. That is, they are either genii, Sal/moves, angels ; or sur
viving human souls. It would be easy to show that this latter
and very simple theory, which is that of the spiritists, is open
to serious objections ; while theologians, for reasons of other
than an experimental character, are the only people who defend
the former. As to the theory which attributes all to incarnate
human forces, it seems to me difficult to admit.
There are then three equally improbable and irrational
theories; which gives me the right of proposing another. It
is neither long nor hard to understand, for a new theory,
capable of explaining the phenomena, I cannot formulate,
having no idea, nor foreseeing in the least, what it should be.
My theory is simply this,—that the future will certainly
, 1905. General Meeting. 43
enlighten us. I think indeed that in a not distant time,
when new facts shall have been ascertained, we shall be able to
formulate some other hypothesis than those of spirits and of
human effluvia. This unknown theory X has every chance of
being true, as was Kepler's theory before Kepler, the theory
of chemistry before Lavoisier, and of electricity before Ampere,
Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz. In these cases the truth had
been neither foreseen nor guessed, and so will it prove to be
with the true metapsychical theory. We have at present but
isolated phenomena, the link between which we fail to perceive.
The discovery may be very simple, but it has not yet been
made ; for though many of the phenomena are real, every
theory that has been built upon them is absurd. Our motto
must then be Labvremus: let us work.
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1904.
A CONSIDERABLE impetus has been given this year to the
Endowment Fund for Psychical Research by the generous offer
of Mr. Morris Hudson in February to contribute £50 to it
if by the end of the year other members should have given
enough to make up with his contribution the sum of £1000.
Although rather less than half this sum has actually been sub
scribed, Mr. Hudson has very kindly allowed his conditional
gift to stand, with the result that the Fund, including
accumulated interest, amounts at the end of January, 1905, to
about £6800. The Treasurer's report (see p. 51), shows how
the money is invested. Thus it still falls short of the minimum
of £8,000 which the Council decided to be necessary before
the Research Scholarship could be founded, but it is hoped
that this sum may be completed before long.
With regard to the current accounts for the year, printed
below, there is little to note. A satisfactory feature is the
continued increase in the income derived from the ordinary
annual subscriptions, which amounts this year to about £100
more than last year (£1051 as against £953). This is, of
course, owing chiefly to the increase in membership,—partly
to the decrease in bad debts among subscriptions, and to
subscriptions being paid more regularly. It is also satis
44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1905.
factory that it has been possible out of the ordinary income
of the Society to invest £250 in the purchase of Midland
Railway Pref. Stock.
The increase in membership during the year has been
well maintained. During the year 33 new Members were
elected and one Associate became a Member ; on the other
hand the loss in number of Members from various causes
was 18 (besides one Honorary and one Corresponding
Member) leaving a net increase of 14 Members. Also 97
new Associates were elected and 5 Members became Asso
ciates ; the loss in numbers of Associates from various causes
was 69 (besides 7 Honorary Associates), leaving a net in
crease of 26 Associates. The total net increase of member
ship during the year is thus 40, and the numbers are
distributed as follows :—Total number of Members and Asso
ciates, 861 ; consisting of 223 Ordinary Members, 32 Honor
ary and Corresponding Members, 594 Associates, 12 Honorary
Associates.
During the year the American Branch has also increased
from 536 to 569 Members and Associates.
At the end of July, Mr. J. G. Piddington was unfortu
nately obliged by ill-health to go abroad, and is expected
to be absent from England for about a year. Meanwhile
the work of the Hon. Secretary is being carried on by his
colleague, the Hon. E. Feilding.
The Library has now been completely re-arranged, the
books being classified under different subjects, so as to make
reference to them easier. A good many books, new and old,
have been and are being added, and a new catalogue has
been prepared, which will shortly be printed. The rules
have been revised, so that Members are now allowed to take
out three volumes at a time and to keep each for one
month.
The Combined Index described in the last annual report
of the Council has now been published. It covers all the
publications of the Society from its foundation in 1882 to
the year 1900 inclusive, namely, the Proceedings, Vols. I. to
XV., the Journal, Vols. I. to IX., the two volumes of
Phantasms of the Living ; also the Proceedings of the American
Society for Psychical Research, Parts I.-IV. (forming VoL L),
MAB., 1905. Report of the Council. 45
which were issued during the years 1885-1889, after which
the American Society was formed into the American Branch
of our own Society. It also contains a complete list of
the Contents of the Proceedings, and not only combines
into one all the separate Indexes, already published with
each volume of the above works, but also contains a far
more complete list of names—both of persons and places
—than were included in the separate Indexes, as well
as a large number of additional items treating of topics and
cases under classified headings, with numerous cross-references.
The Index has been prepared by Miss C. Burke, and
revised throughout by the Editor.
Two General Meetings and four Private Meetings of the
Society (for Members and Associates only), were held during
the year. The dates and the papers read were as follows :
* January 29th. " Presidential Address" by Professor W. F.
Barrett, F.E.S.
* March 21st. "A Case of Multiple Personality" by Albert
Wilson, M.D.
May 9th. " Experiments in Motor Automatism " by Mrs.
A. W. VerraU.
June 24th. "The Light thrown on Psychological Processes
by the Action of Drugs " by Mr. Ernest Dunbar.
October 21st. "Some Cases Eecently Received " by the
Hon. Everard Feilding.
December 5th. " Various Spiritualistic Phenomena witnessed
by the Author" by Lieut.-Colonel Le M. Taylor.
Of these papers, the first two have since been published
in the Proceedings and it is hoped that the others will appear
later in the Proceedings or Journal.
Various series of experiments have been carried out during
the year :
(1) With Mr. B. F. Eichardson, of Nottingham, who claimed
that he had successfully cultivated the power of thought-
transference in some of his friends. In the sittings held by
a Committee of the S.P.R., a report of which was printed in
the Journal for May, he failed entirely to substantiate this
claim.
* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.
46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1905
(2) Arrangements were made in conjunction with the
London Spiritualist Alliance for a series of sittings with Mr.
Bailey, a professional medium whose performances in Australia,
especially in the production of apports, had been reported in
Light, and about whom information had been received from
one of our Australian members, Mr. A. W. Dobbie. Mr.
Bailey having arranged to visit several European countries
this year for the purpose of giving sittings, had consented to
the arrangements proposed by the S.P.K. and L.S.A. for
sittings in London. He went first to Italy, however, and
after a few sittings in Milan and Eome returned suddenly to
Australia. Reports were published in Light of the Italian
sittings, as to the results of which there seem to have been
differences of opinion. Mr. Dobbie sent us reports of his
own sittings with Mr. Bailey in Australia, which he con
sidered unsatisfactory on the whole. He also sent us some
specimens of the apports produced at these sittings, namely,
some small coins, said to be Egyptian, with the request that
we should submit them to experts at the British Museum.
We did so, and were informed that they were genuine, but
extremely common and valueless. We have, however, since
received from a gentleman who had sittings, which in his
opinion were of extreme interest, with Mr. Bailey at Sydney,
a number of larger objects alleged to have been produced
as apports at these sittings, and which are to be further
examined.
(3) A large number of sittings have also been held with
various members of the Society, no professional medium being
present. The results in some cases were decidedly promising,
but not sufficiently conclusive to admit of publication at pre
sent. It is much to be desired that members of the
Society should themselves form small circles if they can meet
with any private persons who appear to have mediumistic or
automatic powers, and that they should report to the Secre
tary or Hon. Secretary if they obtain results which are capable
of being investigated. There are no doubt many " sensitives "
with whom interesting and instructive experiments might be
tried, if they were willing to submit themselves to a regular
series of such, and members of the Society are earnestly asked
to bear this in mind and to co-operate with the Council in
MAK., 1905. Report of the Council. 47
trying to obtain the help of such persons in the work of the
Society.
Among other experiments carried out not at the Rooms of
the Society, some of the most interesting reported to us were
those of Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Bradgate in simultaneous auto
matic writing. These experiments were started at the sugges
tion of Mr. Baggally, and an account of them was included in
the paper read by Mr. Feilding at the meeting on October
21st, a brief report of which was printed in the Journal for
November, 1904.
Some cases of the cure of warts by suggestion have been
reported to us by Mr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, and Mr. Young
is continuing his experiments in this direction. It will be
remembered that a case of curing at a distance was recently
printed in the Journal (for July, 1904).
Mr. Feilding has carried out a number of experiments in
hypnotism, some of which he described at the meeting of the
Society on October 21st. He would be very glad to hear of
any persons likely to prove suggestible subjects who would be
willing to submit themselves to experiment.
The time of the officers of the Society has been largely
taken up with interviews, correspondence, answers to enquiries
and investigation of cases. In the last department especially,
constant and invaluable help has as usual been given by Colonel
Taylor, Mr. Baggally, and the Rev. A. T. Fryer, and occasional
contributions have been received from other members of the
Society, to all of whom our best thanks are due. During part
of the year also useful help in the correspondence was given
by Mr. Hume-Rothery. Mr. Fryer has also collected a large
amount of information about the present religious revival in
Wales, the psychological aspect of which is of considerable
interest for students of psychical research, and it is hoped
that a report of it from this point of view will be made.
A local group for psychical research has been formed during
the year by Mr. Walter Howell at Birmingham, and a local
Society at Manchester under the presidency of Mr. A. W.
Orr. The formation of a Society at Montreal, of which one
of our members, Mr. E. Percy Gomery, is President, was also
reported to us in October. This Society holds general meetings
every fortnight for the reading of papers, discussion or experi
48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAB., 1905.
mentation, in the rooms of the Natural History Society at
Montreal, and already contains about 50 members. It seems
to have made a vigorous start, and we hope to hear more
of its doings later.
Though the actual progress made each year seems, when
taken alone, to be but small, there is no doubt a steady growth
in the interest taken in the subject all the world over. This
is shown not only by the constant increase in our member
ship, but even more by the frequent references to the Society
and its work in the literature of the day, which seem to indi
cate that the importance of psychical research is coming to
be more and more widely recognised by the most enlightened
and intellectual classes both of readers and writers. A note
worthy symptom of this is to be seen in the fact that among
the books recommended on the subject of Metaphysics in the
Fellowship Course of Trinity College, Dublin, for 1905, is
Mr. Myers's Human Personality (Vol. I. Chaps. I.-IV.), Mr.
Myers being the only English philosopher whose works appear
in the list.
In the early days of the Society one of the greatest obstacles
to progress was the difficulty of getting an impartial hearing
from men of science and repute for the evidence from time
to time brought forward. Perhaps our greatest danger to-day
lies rather in the opposite direction,—in a too great readiness to
accept evidence that is still far from being complete. Telepathy,
for instance, till recently scouted, is now commonly spoken
of as if it were almost on the same scientific footing as the
theory of evolution,—not because there is any general familiarity
with the evidence on which it rests, but because it is popularly
supposed to have reached a stage of scientific acceptance,
placing it beyond the necessity of further demonstration. The
general result of this attitude is unfortunately to discourage
the accumulation of the fresh evidence which is so urgently
needed,—not only for telepathy but in every branch of our
work.
It is astonishing, for example, how rarely opportunities are
presented to us of investigating certain of the phenomena of
spiritism most frequently reported and widely accepted by
spiritists, such as the production of " raps," either with or
without contact.
MAR., 1905. Report of the Council. 49
It is only recently through the kindness of a member of
the Society that the present officials have for the first time
had an opportunity of observing this particular phenomenon at
a couple of sittings at which raps without any apparent con
tact occurred. If, however, raps are so common as they are
alleged to be, it is greatly to be regretted that more frequent
occasions should not arise for their careful investigation.
We venture, therefore, earnestly to ask members in whose
experience these phenomena occur to offer us an opportunity
of witnessing them. And though any investigation which may
be allowed should, of course, be conducted in a systematic
manner, we hope that no assurance is required that it would
not on that account be otherwise than completely sympathetic.
Another obstacle to advance is the idea that certain types
of phenomena are now so far established that it is superfluous
either to make or to scrutinize records of them with the minute
care that was exercised by the early workers and founders
of the Society,—that, in effect, a lower standard of work is
now permissible.
The Council desire to inculcate on members of the Society
a view precisely the opposite of this. Our constant endeavour
should be, not to ignore, but if possible to improve on the
methods of our predecessors ; to examine " in the same spirit
of exact and unimpassioned enquiry" whatever apparently well-
authenticated evidence is brought before us, and to discriminate
as far as possible between the good and the bad, or the good
and the less good ; rather than resignedly to lump it all together
with the indolent conclusion that everything is more or less
certain or uncertain.
If the phenomena alleged to occur have a real objective
existence, and if they have the bearing which they appear to
have on the most vital problems, no labour can be too great
and no trouble should be spared to establish and to elucidate
them.

NOTE.
The Hon. Secretary will be very glad to hear of any
Members and Associates who have time at their disposal and
are willing to take part in the special investigation of cases,
particularly cases where personal interviews with witnesses
and observation of manifestations of alleged spiritistic origin
in different parts of the country may be desirable. It frequently
happens, e.g., that reports are received of so-called "Poltergeist"
phenomena, and if a few more voluntary helpers were added to
the very small number who now hold themselves in readiness
to be called upon, it might more often be possible to carry
out investigations of incidents as they are actually occurring;
whereas, under the present circumstances, it is frequently
necessary to defer any practical investigation until too late.
Members who are disposed to give help in this way are
asked to communicate with the Hon. E. Feilding, 13 Hertford
Street, Mayfair, London, W., and, if possible, arrange an
interview either with him or Miss Johnson at the Society's
Rooms.

CASES.
G. 277. Collective Auditory.
THE following account was sent to us through a member of
the Council from a gentleman, belonging to the Society, who
is a master in a well-known public school. The names of
all the persons concerned have been given to us, with the
request not to print them. Mr. C.'s account, enclosed in a
letter dated January 13th, 1905, is as follows:
In the autumn of 1902 I was recovering from a long illness, in
consequence of which I wore a spinal jacket by day, and had turned
my downstairs study into my bedroom. It was also my custom
to go to bed about 8 p.m. I have a boarding-house at a public
school with the care of about 30 boys ; the majority of these live
in a part of the house shut off from our private rooms, but five or
six boys sleep in two rooms on the first floor near the bedroom used
at the time by my wife. On Sunday, December 7th, 1902, about 7.30
or 8 p.m., I was sitting alone in my room and thought I heard a
knock on the door. I said " Come in," but no one appeared, and
I concluded the noise was due to the wind, as there was a breeze
that evening. I still think it may have been the effect of wind.
A second time I heard a knock and there was no one, but still I
was not much surprised. Shortly afterwards I took off my jacket
and went to bed. At that time when I had taken off the jacket
I was not allowed to raise my shoulders until I had it on again.
My wife was in the room. Suddenly we heard a tremendous bang
upon the door, as if some one had struck it full with the fist. I
said to my wife, " Go and see what it is." She replied, " I dare
not." If I had been able to rise, I think I should have gone at
once, but I wish to note that I felt seriously alarmed, in a way
that I could hardly explain. My wife's remark shows that she
felt the same, and this feeling of unreasonable fright is what remains
with us both as the strongest impression. We listened intently,
and are quite sure that no one could have left the neighbourhood
of the door without being heard, and in four or five seconds my wife
went to the door and found no one. I heard nothing more.
Next morning my wife at breakfast told me that in the night
she woke up and felt sure she heard some one walking up the stairs.
She went out of her room and while on the. landing close to the
door of a room in which three boys were sleeping, she heard dis
tinctly one or two deep sighs. Beyond this she heard nothing and
APRIL, 1905. Cases. 55
returned to her room. We thought a great deal about the
occurrence and told several friends.
About Christmas we received a letter from India to say that Mr.
W , father of one of the boys who slept in the room mentioned
above, had died on December 6th after a short illness. It is worth
mentioning that I had only once seen Mr. W , on the sole
occasion when he came to my house and had an interview with me
in the room where the knock was heard.
It seems to me probable that there is some connection between
the death and the noise. I should further say that I have never
had any experience of the kind or other hallucination, but that my
wife on several occasions has heard unaccountable noises at the
time of death of some of her relatives.
The boy W left my house in April, 1903, and I did not see
his mother, Mrs. W , until September, 1904, when she came to
call upon me with a view to sending her son back.
I then told her what had happened. She was not surprised, and
told me of a strange occurrence that took place in India the same
night. Mr. W was attacked by typhoid fever. The doctor
told Mrs. W that the only chance for him was to conceal from
him the danger of his state, and he died after a very short illness
without any farewell about 12 midnight, December 6. The follow
ing evening (I think somewhat late), Mrs. W was in the room
alone with the body, and said, " 0 , you never said good-bye,
dear." Instantly she heard behind her a voice which said quite
loudly, " Good-bye, dear." She left the room, crossed the verandah,
and went into another room on the far side of the verandah where
the children were sleeping. There she asked the nurse, " Did you
hear anything just now?" The nurse said "Yes, Miss J rose
straight up in her bed asleep and said quite loud, ' Good-bye, dear,'
and then fell back again." Mrs. W tells me that the girl
could not possibly have heard what she (Mrs. W.) said in the other
room, as the rooms were too far apart.
This account is signed in full by Mr. C. and Mrs. C. signs
the following note :
I consider this a correct account of what took place on the
Sunday, December 7th, 1902.
In the letter accompanying the account, Mr. C. writes :
I should add that Mrs. W told me that Mr. W had a
strong belief in the possibility of communication with another world,
56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.
and was entirely devoted to his children. He was an Indian Civil
Servant and a man of great ability.
In reply to our questions Mr. C. writes :
January 25th, 1905.
I made no note about the date, but the occurrence made such
an extraordinary impression on me that I could not possibly forget
it, and the fact of its happening on Sunday night (when there were
no servants on any floor but the basement), prevents any possi
bility of confusion in the day of the week. We mentioned the
matter at once to Mr. T. who is one of my assistant-masters
living in the house, and I send you his testimony.
I enclose the two letters which I received about the death. I
received Mr. W. A.'s first, and it came by the mail from India
arriving the end of Christmas week—that would be from December
26th-28th, probably December 27th, Saturday being the usual day
for the mail to arrive. You will notice that unfortunately it is not
dated, but there is a reference to the 18th December as a future
date. The other letter is from another brother of Mrs. W and
arrived later. You see it is written on December 29th. . . .
The three letters enclosed in the above were as follows :
(1) From Mr. T.
January 25/A, 1905.
I distinctly recollect hearing Mr. C mention the mysterious
knocks on his door. I believe on the day after the occurrence,
certainly before December 14th, 1902.
(2) From Mr. W. A.
DEAR MR. C
Mr. W died most unexpectedly on the 6th
instant. . . . Mrs. W leaves for England on the 18th December
and should arrive about 6th January, 1903.
(3) From Mr. J. A.
December 29iA, 1902.
DEAR SIR,
I regret to have to tell you that [Mr. W.] died
on the 6th inst at Bombay. Mrs. W has started for London
and is expected to arrive about the 6th January. . . .
We have verified that December 7th, 1902, was a Sunday,
as stated. The time at Bombay is 4 hours and 51 minutes
APRIL, 1905. Cases. 57
later than at Greenwich, so that Mr. C.'s experience seems to
have occurred about 13 hours after the death of Mr. W.
With regard to the other incident described in Mr. C.'s account,
Mrs. W. writes to us :
February 4th, 1905.
. . . The incident is explained to me by my child being so
devoted and so sympathetic—it was perfectly natural that she
should feel what I was feeling. . . . There were two bedrooms
side by side—not opening into each other—both opened on to a
balcony which ran along the house. My little girl, about 3£ years
old, and her nurse were in one room asleep. It was about 2 a.m.
I was kneeling by my husband's coffin in the other room. I was
greatly distressed that he had not said 'good-bye' to me. We were
most devoted and his death was a terribly sudden shock. It may
seem strange that in the midst of such desperate trouble such a
small thing as his not actually having said the word 'good-bye' should
have affected me, but it did; and I said, "You never even said
good-bye." At the moment I heard a voice which seemed to come
direct from the coffin say, "Good-bye, Mummy, good-bye." I went
into the next room and asked the nurse if she had heard anything
and she said "No." I said, "Did no one speak?" and she said,
"Now, do rest; Miss J is asleep. She just now rose straight
to her feet and said, 'Good-bye, Mummy, good-bye,' but she is
asleep now." He often called me " Mummy " as the child did.
L. 1145. Auditory.
The following account was sent to us by a lady who
has had another apparently telepathic experience, printed in
an earlier number of the Journal. We are asked not to print
her name, which was given to us in confidence, and we
therefore use an assumed name. The percipient writes :
January 3rd, 1905.
We had spent the winter 1896-7 in Egypt for C.'s [her husband's]
health, and we went to Hyeres about a fortnight before Easter.
There I left him, being obliged to come to London, and I intended
to stay over Easter in town, if he continued as well as when I had
left him. He wrote cheerfully, describing his daily walks, and telling
me that he felt very well. I was therefore not feeling anxious
about him.
About 1 a.m. on Easter Monday I awoke thinking I heard
him call me. I sprang up in great anxiety, feeling sure that he
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.
was ill. After a time I persuaded myself that I had only been
dreaming, and fell asleep again, only to wake a second time in
the early morning with the impression again that he was calling
me. This time I got up, dressed and packed my things, and
when my maid came in with a telegram she found me almost
ready to start. The telegram was "Come at once." Hemorrhage
had come on about midnight, and all that night C. had been
thinking of me and wondering how quickly I could get to him.
I was able to catch the first train from London and arrived at
Hyeres several hours before the doctor, who had been telegraphed
for at the same time.
MARY CARMICHAEL.
Confirmation of this can be given by the maid.
Mr. Carmichael died about a year after this incident. Mrs.
Carmichael writes later :
March \\th [1905].
Your letter of January llth reached me some time after at
Tunis, and I waited until my return home, when I hoped to
see the maid and to send you her confirmation of my story. I
found her very ill, and she said she had no recollection of any
thing that happened that morning, all arrangements being so
hurried. I then feared I could send you no further evidence, but,
quite by chance, one of my sisters spoke of it, and reminded me
that she had been at the station to see me off and remembered
the incident perfectly. She has since sent me the enclosed, which
please make use of, if of sufficient interest and weight.
The note enclosed, signed with the full name of the writer,
was as follows :
March 8th [1905].
On Easter Monday, 1897, my sister wired for me to come to
Charing Cross and see her off by the early train, as she was
going to Hyeres. She had been wired for and I was much surprised
that she had been able to get off so quickly, until she told me
she had been awakened in the night in the way she described.
The impression that my brother-in-law was very ill and wanting
her was so clear that she had got up and prepared for the
journey before receiving the telegram.
APRIL, 1905. Cases. 59
L. 1146. Apparition.
The next case was sent to us by Professor A. Alexander,
who writes regarding it as follows :
CAIXA 906, Eio DE JANEIRO, February Uh, 1905.
. . . You will see that it is one of deferred visual and auditory
hallucination announcing the death of the apparent agent. The
deposition of the percipient and of her husband and daughter is
contained in that part of my narrative which begins with the
words, "Now before his death Cavalcante—" and ends with
" —normal cause be found to account for the noise." The Kiekens,
so far as I could make out, have never troubled themselves about
spiritualistic matters, but they gave their evidence frankly and
without reserve. The thing happened and they told me how 'it
happened. The girl looked upon the hallucination merely as a
proof that her mother was superstitious. Superstition alone does
not explain away the coincidence. Telepathic agency is all the
more probable for the reason that between Frau Rieken and her
intended son-in-law there existed much sympathy and affection.
On my first visit to Copacabana I examined the room where the
apparition was seen. . . .
The account written by Professor Alexander is as follows :
In the first half of November, 1904, popular disorders in Rio de
Janeiro, which were ostensibly a protest against the government
project of obligatory vaccination, culminated in the revolt of the
Military School. Marching from their quarters on the evening of
the 14th of that month, under the command of General Travassos,
the students met and scattered the police force sent to intercept
them. The firing took place about 1 1 o'clock p.m. at the spot where
the Rua da Passagem opens on to the Botafogo shore. The neigh
bouring gas-lamps had been extinguished and the night was very
dark, so that it is impossible to know the exact details of all that
oecurred. It is certain, however, that one of the first victims of this
encounter was the alferes-alumno,1 Joao Sylvestre Cavalcante, who
was, it seems, wounded in the back as he retired from a parley with
the general in command of the police and then killed outright by
a second shot through the head. This occurrence was partly witnessed
'A military student who in the course of his studies has attained to the
rank of ensign.

by his comrade, Ensign Potyguara, who led a company in the van
guard. The written deposition of the latter is here given : l
"S. CHRISTOVAM, January 24/A, 1905.
"I declare that on the night between the 14th and 15th of
November, about 11 o'clock in the evening, the Military School,
under the command of General Travassos, having halted in the Rua
da Passagem, the alferes-alum.no Jo£o Sylvestre Cavalcante was sent
by the said general to parley with General Piragibe, who was in
command of the police brigade. Immediately after the parley, as
the said alferes-alumno was returning, he was shot in the back by a
bullet that came from the police brigade. On passing by me he
told me he was wounded, and riding (by my advice) to the rear of
the School, he fell immediately afterwards, and was dragged for a
short distance by the horse which he was riding.
" N.B.—When the alferes-alumno Joao Sylvestre Cavalcante was
crossing the Rua da Passagem, he was wounded by a Mauser bullet
in the right parietal [bone], and this shot killed him.
"ENSIGN TERTULIANO POTYGUARA."
This account of the death is said to be current among the military
students who are now detained in the different barracks awaiting
their trial by court-martial.2 One of these, Mario Clementino de
Carvalho, declares that they left their quarters shortly after 10 o'clock
and exchanged shots with the police about 11—certainly not later
than 11.15. He struck a match, and looked at Cavalcante after he
had fallen. The poor lad lay in a muddy gutter, his horse dead on
the pavement beside him. The evidence of this witness and others
determines within narrow limits the time of the death. It must
have taken place between a quarter to eleven and a quarter past,
and most probably just about the hour itself.
Now before his death Cavalcante had become engaged to a certain
Fraulein Maria Luiza Rieken, the daughter of Herr Rieken, a thriving
military tailor established in this city, and of Frau Louise Rieken.
This family lives at No. 20A Rua Barata Ribeiro, Copacabana, ami,
as the fianct of the daughter, Cavalcante, who lived close by, was of

witness, as well as his translation of it.—EDITOR.

course a constant visitor at the house, and was accustomed to take
his early coffee there before proceeding to the School. On the morn
ing of the 14th he had returned at 9 o'clock to breakfast, which he
shared with ' Minri,' as the young lady was familiarly called. He
was in good spirits, and although there was some peculiarity in his
manner of taking leave, it is not likely that he had any presenti
ment of his approaching fate. Shortly before, indeed, he had made
the hypothesis of his own death a subject for jest. He left Copaca-
bana never to return there alive.
No reports whatever respecting the adhesion of the School to the
insurrectionary movement reached the family that day. About 11 p.m.
by their house clock (which was, however, too slow) a sound of firing
was heard from over the hill. But when, in spite of the advanced
hour, Cavalcante did not return, Frau Kieken felt very anxious, and
for some time after she had retired to bed this state of uneasiness
kept her awake. The room occupied by her and her husband is in
the upper part of the house, but as it is a small one and filled with
large-sized furniture, the door is left wide open for the sake of
ventilation.1 She had already heard the clock strike two; it was
therefore between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning when she suddenly
saw Cavalcante standing at the entrance looking in upon her. He
leant against the side of the door, his right hand raised and holding
to the jamb and his left arm behind his back. He did not wear the
regulation uniform in which he had been killed, but presented him
self in the khaki undress he usually wore at home—on his head a
felt hat with the brim turned down and a rose-coloured neckerchief
round his neck. He seemed to be covered with mud and his face
was overcast with sadness. " Gitarda Mirnl," he said. ("Take care
of Mimi.") Frau Kieken's first surprise was succeeded by a sense
of the impropriety of his being in that part of the house at such
an hour, and she was about to awake her husband. But on looking
again the doorway was a blank—Cavalcante had vanished—it was
but a vision.
Next morning, before any news had reached them, she told Herr
Eieken and her daughter of her strange nocturnal experience. Neither
of them was willing to believe that the vision had any significance.
On walking down to the electric-car station at 8 o'clock Herr Rieken
was informed of the occurrence of the revolt and of Cavalcante's
death by some young men who were there reading the papers. At
'Professor Alexander gives a plan of the room, which is not reproduce

62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APBIL, 1906.
first he gave absolutely no credit to the report, and was convinced
of its truth only after it had been confirmed by two naval officers of
his acquaintance. He proceeded at once to the Military School,
whither the body had been transported. In preparing it for burial
he cut away the uniform, which, although not the same as that seen
in the vision, was indeed stained with the mud of the street. The
shirt underneath was soaked with blood, and a bullet had passed
through the head from one side to the other. Herr Kieken was also
told that the lad had been dragged by his horse after he had
fallen.
About a month later the same percipient had another visual
hallucination, to which, however, there seems to have been no
coincidence in objective events. She saw the young man seated in
his usual careless attitude on one of the chairs in her sitting-
room.
Cavalcante had nearly completed his course of military studies.
He was noted for his application and intelligence, and recommended
himself to all who knew him by a most insinuating address. He
was nearly 27 years old at the date of his death.
The loss of their intended son-in-law has not been the only mis
fortune which the Riekens have had to bear in recent times. One
of their children, a boy nine years of age, had been previously killed
by a passing car. Some three hours before this accident a crash as
of breaking crockery or bottles had been heard in their store-room.
On going thither they found everything in perfect order, nor could
any normal cause be found to account for the noise.
From this account, which has been carefully drawn up and
corrected in accordance with the statements of the various witnesses,
it appears that the lapse of time between Cavalcante's death at
Botafogo and its nunciation at Copacabana was roughly three hours
—probably a little more. For some days there had been disorders
in town, and both by day and night there had been firing in the
streets. Of this nobody was ignorant. But the news of the revolt
of the Military School spread very late and evidently did not reach
the Riekens in the retired spot where they lived. It is an impor
tant point in the evidence that Frau Rieken told her husband and
daughter of her hallucination before any of them had the slightest
inkling of the events of the night. The family formally certify to
the correctness of that part of the above narrative that contains
their own oral deposition :

The original of the above note, written in German, was
sent to us by Professor Alexander.
A SUGGESTION FOR INVESTIGATORS.
THE Rev. A. T. Fryer, of 2 Newport Road, Cardiff, sends
us the following note :
From a comparison of many cases of mental interaction or
thought-transference, conscious and unconscious, I find that the
amount of information conveyed from agents to percipients is ex
ceedingly small, so small indeed as to resemble the brevities known
as code-words in telegraphy, where, as every one knows, a single
word, or even a letter, represents a phrase, and may stand for a
long sentence, the code being, of course, previously arranged. No
exact pre-arrangement of the telegraphic sort can be supposed in
the cases with which we have to deal, but yet we are forced to
admit the existence of an analogous operation, and to conclude that,
where there is a large amount of information common to two
persons, an indication of very limited extent serves to illuminate
a more or less extended portion of the matter of common know
ledge. If a single word coming from A to B serves, apparently,
to make B see not only a word but a whole scene with innumerable
incidentals which were not in A's mind, it would appear that B's
mind acts as the translator of the press telegram does when a brief
message in code has to be worked up into a lengthy paragraph.
Thus a relative once wrote to ask me what had happened to me,
because I had appeared to her and, looking very ill, complained of
a certain injury. Nothing had happened to me, but I was thinking
a good deal of the injury described which had happened to a
friend. My appearance was followed by a vision of the figure of
death. I, too, had thought it possible that the said injury might
result in my friend's decease. Clearly two words, injured limb,
and a third, death, were the whole contents of my sub-conscious
telepathic message; the rest,—and there was a very large amount
64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APBIL, 1906.
of scenic accompaniment not emanating from me at all,—was made
up by the recipient mind.
Now a great many other cases show the same features of brevity
in the agent-mind, enlargement in the recipient, and these are
sufficient in number to make it desirable that the utmost pains
should be taken to discover the exact form, quantity, and quality
of the originating impulse, and to find how much or how little
of it was utilised or realised by the recipient. And as minds
act according to innate or acquired habits, it is important to get
all the possible instances we can from each person who has had
more than one experience of telepathic communication. Persons
who visualise their impressions rarely if ever auditise them, and
vice versA. On the other hand, we should try to discover how
much information is conveyed by the agent-minds, since it is
possible that some are more communicative than others or able to
send more details. But the immediate necessity is to fix the exact
contents of the message as received. A. T. FRYER.
NOTE ON A CASE OF AUTOMATIC INTELLIGENCE.
EEKERRING to the communication from Mrs. Garrett Smith
quoted in the Journal for December, 1904 (p. 309), the sketch
given does not profess to be an exact representation of the
curve corresponding to the equation written by the planchette,
but only represents her recollection of its general character.
Mr. J. W. Sharpe, of Bournemouth, has been good enough
to draw out an accurate graph of the curve, and we have pleasure
in reproducing his drawing here on a reduced scale.
APRIL, 1905. Note on a Case of Automatic Intelligence 65
It will be remembered that the equation r = a —^— was given
u
by planchette, as representing mathematically the shape of its
own outline or boundary ; the intelligence controlling its move
ments being represented as that of a Cambridge Wrangler.
With regard to his drawing Mr. Sharpe observes that the
curve does not consist of two seta of spirals, as depicted on
p. 310 of the December Journal, but of two sets of loops, all
passing through the cusp and touching one another there, and
all contained within the outer heart-shaped boundary. The
loops meet only at the cusp and there is an infinite number
of them. They decrease in area without limit, ultimately
sinking into the point of the cusp.
The equation very well represents the ordinary form of a
planchette. But if it had accidentally been reversed into
Q
r = u ;;, the curve would have been entirely different and
sm 6
entirely unlike any planchette outline.
Mr. Sharpe thinks it very unlikely that either of the auto-
matists had ever seen an accurate graph of the equation given
in their writing. It is of course much more difficult to give
the equation to a curve (which was the feat performed by the
writing in this case) than, when the equation is given, to draw
roughly the curve represented by it.
THE JOURNALIST AT LAEGE IN PSYCHICAL
RESEARCH.
WITHIN the last two or three years " ghost stories " have
come to form a staple topic among sensational newspaper
paragraphs, and it has sometimes been suggested to us that
the cases there reported ought to be taken up by the Society
and carefully investigated. This has occasionally been done
with more or less success, and a few of the cases investigated
have been printed in the Journal, but the enquiries generally
come to nothing, and indeed if we consider the treatment
constantly accorded to verifiable topics in the daily papers, we
shall hardly be surprised at their treatment of topics that are
often from the nature of the case unverifiable. Yet these reports
are as a rule received by the public with so little caution
66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.
that it may be worth while now and then to trace the de
velopment of the legends. We give below two cases in which
we happen to have had an opportunity of doing this.
The first exemplifies the most simple method—that of pure
invention. It is the story of the Talking Baby of Bethesda,
who just before its death in December, 1903, at the age of
three months prophesied that the next year would be a
terrible year. Mr. Fryer's enquiries into the grounds for this
story were reported in the Journal for February, 1904, p. 194.
The story—possibly in a modified form as far as the prophecy
is concerned—cropped up again in connection with the Welsh
revival, and Mr. Fryer sends us the following description of
its origin from the Western Mail of January 21st, 1905, the
name of the writer " Awstin " being known to him, and having
been given to us in confidence.
" Awstin " writes :—When listening, as I have occasionally had to
listen lately, to sane and serious men—ministers of the Gospel and
others—quoting the tale of the North Wales baby prophet in support
of their belief that the revival had, among other matters, been fore
told, I have been obliged to give, in private conversation, expression
to somewhat strong condemnation of the folly of introducing such
twaddle, and have given my reasons for applying such an epithet
to the story. I am glad, therefore, that in quoting the extraordinary
canard at the request of a correspondent the Western Mail a couple
of days ago did not attempt to emphasise the " prophecy " by adding
a moral. Happening to know the father of the supposed baby, I am
in a position to tell something of the birth and death of the infant
prodigy and the origin of the joke—for such it certainly originated
in. Were it not foolishly connected with the revival by people who
ought to know better 1 would not trouble to interfere now, but it
is really a pity that superstitious persons should be allowed to lead
others astray by means of such sorry stuff. A keen journalist, who
is often on the look-out for "sensations," met a brother journalist
in North Wales the night prior to the publication of the remarkable
prophecy, and asked if there was "anything going on." "Haven't
you heard of the baby prophet?" asked the other. "No," was the
reply. " Where—what is it ? " The other, in a merry mood, told
the story. The first man promptly telegraphed the tale all over the
country. Then next morning the two journalists met again, and the
"father" of the story—if I may so call him—was astonished at the
APRIL, 1905. The Journalist at large in Psychical Research. 67
use made of what he regarded as his good joke. " Wasn't it true 1 "
asked the man who had telegraphed it. "No," was the reply. "Oh,
well," replied the other, "you ought not to have told me, then."
The inventor of the tale expressed regret that the joke had been
carried so far, and the journalist who had made the "scoop" wired
a contradiction of the story all over the country. " But the news
papers," he declared to me, "did not want the contradiction, and
they never used it." The baby prophet had been decently buried
in the first paragraph sent out, and there the matter was supposed
to have ended. The resurrection has been brought about by other
people. The story and its sequel were related to me by the journalist
who had been hoaxed.
In the second case, the story, which appeared in the Daily
Mail last Christmas Eve and was copied far and wide—even
by the foreign press—was a more plausible one, and founded
on the more effective method of improvement. It began :
From Brighton comes a story of a haunted house where a ghost
has been seen. Brighton's ghost has selected an ordinary two-storied
house in a very ordinary street as its residence. [The writer then
describes the figure of a woman with an awful look on her face
seen by a lady in the house one evening, and goes on] :
A gentleman well known in Brighton lived in the house with
his wife and children for fifteen months. Sturdy and muscular,
with a partiality for mountain-climbing as a pastime, this gentleman,
who was seen by a Daily Mail representative yesterday, is certainly
not the kind of man to suffer from "nerves."
He said that he had not seen the ghost, but a very curious thing
happened in the corner of the drawing-room where the figure is
said to have appeared, [viz., that he and his wife heard three notes
sounded, three times in succession, on a guitar that was hanging
on the wall untouched. The account goes on to say that a barrister
with a revolver, a terrier and two friends watched in the house
one night and the three men saw a transparent figure of a woman
wearing a brown dress. The figure walked up to the wall and then
vanished.] It is said that some years ago a young woman, driven
mad by the cruelty of a man, hanged herself in the bedroom of the house.
On the strength of these newspaper accounts, the case was
quoted in the Annals of Psychical Science for last January. The
accounts were obviously intended to suggest that the incidents
referred to had occurred recently ; but they reminded us forcibly
•68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1905.
of a case that had been published in the Proceedings in the year
1889 (Vol. VI. pp. 255-269, and 309-313). On enquiring
from the writer of the last part of this account (pp. 'SOS-
SIS), an Associate of the Society who had lived in the house
from August 1888 to September 1889, and whom we took
to be the gentleman referred to by the Daily Mail, the
following reply was received :
THE LABORATORY, ROMAN CRESCENT,
SOUTHWICK, BRIGHTON, February 25th, 1905.
... I saw the account in the Daily Mail some few weeks
*back, and am bound to say that what little respect remained to me
for newspaper accuracy and newspaper morals vanished. Christmas,
1903, a reporter for the Brighton approached me, saying he was
writing a "seasonable" column. He had a few cases of local
haunted houses, [this one] amongst them, and he asked me to verify
my experiences. I did so, and when his little article appeared it
was substantially accurate as far as I was concerned. I don't think
my name was given. A year later the thing was dished up again
•for the Daily Mail, and so worded as to make it appear of recent
•occurrence. My experiences were given with an introduction some
what to this effect : " This gentleman, who was seen by our
representative yesterday, said," etc., etc. Readers of the Daily
Mail could scarcely imagine that they were reading of events
15 years old; nor would they think that the gentleman who was
seen yesterday was only "seen" across the width of a crowded
concert room when not a word passed. I found out afterwards
that the writer of the Daily Mail article is the reporter for the
Brighton , and he had dished up his 12 months old Brighton
article for the London daily ; and then I recalled that he had
•"seen" me yesterday at a school entertainment, where I had gone
to see my little daughter's calisthenics and he had presumably
gone to report. We were on opposite sides of the room and
nodded ! You are quite right, the newspapers do " sometimes bring
out an old story as if it were an entirely new one." . . .
G. ALBERT SMITH.
It may be added that the newspaper account of the suicide
(" a young woman, driven mad by the cruelty of a man,") hardly
tallies with the evidence given at the inquest. The person who
committed suicide was a Mrs. M. F., aged 42 years, a lodging-
house keeper then occupying the house. " The cruelty of a
man " is a touch added by the journalist.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND
ASSOCIATES.
THE eleventh of the series of Private Meetings for Members
and Associates only was held in the large hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Monday, March 27th, 1905, at
4.15 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the chair.
MB. SYDNEY OLIVIER, C.M.G., read a paper on " Some
Normal Extensions and Intensifications of Conscious Percep
tion." Mr. Olivier apologised in advance for what might
appear the triviality of much of what he should say and its
superfluity as a contribution to the Society's proceedings.
His observations would have a plausible show of relevance
only to certain of the more cautious generalisations that have
commended themselves to the Sadducee wing of the Society,
and even so would have little claim to novelty. Nevertheless,
whilst the Society has collected a great mass of record, and
sifted much evidence in regard to abnormal phenomena, the
President's address at the last General Meeting clearly acknow
ledged how moderate after all is the result towards enabling
us to coordinate those phenomena with the normal impressions
experienced through the faculties we consciously employ every
day. And looking only towards those phenomena for which
most are content to account without any spiritistic hypothesis,
it must be admitted that telepathic impressions, veridical
hallucinations and apparitions of various types, remain for
us still like detached island craters on a volcanic rift or
like outcrops of a metallic lode which we believe our
selves to have already in practical exploitation elsewhere,
and which we are convinced must be really continuous.
The paper aimed at calling into consideration some normal
evocations of subliminal consciousness of which we have
frequent experience. Such extensions and intensifications are
familiar to us all, as material for observation and reflexion :
MAT, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 73
the abnormal experience cannot be counted on, but if, and in
so far as, the normal points in its direction, it may be profit
able to study it more persistently.
Such experiences are commonly and may be deliberately
induced by what we call the Fine Arts, by sympathetic
personal relations, by Love, and by Religion. To begin with
the Art that addresses itself to the sense of sight, a sense
most obviously relevant to much of the Society's special
interests. When we look at a Dutch realist painting, or a
topical picture such as Mr. Frith's " Derby Day," we see
what is there on the canvas and what was, or is to be pre
sumed to have been, before the eyes of the painter. When
we look at a landscape by Monet we see what is not painted
on the canvas, but was there to be painted. When we see
an old woman painted by Rembrandt or a street-girl scrawled
by Forain, we see equally what is not painted or drawn and
what, further, was not there at all to be seen in the common
sense of the word. We seem to have passed into something
very like the sphere of hallucinations.
There are different modes of seeing. First, in the ordinary
sense, a conscious perception produced by the impact of
ether-vibrations upon the retinal nerves, the content of which
can be partially checked by photography. At the other end
of the scale there is that purely imaginary seeing in which,
by effort of will and memory, one calls up a pictorial
image " in one's head." Between these range such impres
sions as those experienced by a clairvoyant medium or in
crystal-gazing, which are much more real in effect, and
those still more real-seeming experiences of completely external
ised hallucinations of waking vision, indistinguishable in their
etfect from sight in the common sense of the word. The
subject of these has no hesitation in using the verb to see :
indeed it is often only through afterthought and reflection,
if at all, that he comes to say " I must have imagined it."
An artist is one who sees, in the first, everyday sense,
more than the average and is more powerfully impressed by
his seeing. But he is more. He is a medium : an inter
preter in a specialised degree between the sub-conscious and
the sensible. The vivid particular stimulus of his special
sensibility not only produces in him abstraction and quasi
74 Journal of Society for Psychical Researdi. MAT, 1906.
hypnotisation in regard to other interests, but throws him,
in greater or less degree and with varying certitude, into a
true exaltation or ecstasy, involving an extension of conscious
ness beyond the common tide-marks, so that his sight becomes
insight and his technique creation. And the impression made
by a masterly work of art, if we are attuned to receive
it, is not detailed, nor the result of analytical observation :
it is massive and seems to arise quite irrationally out of
sub-conscious perturbations. The particular state of feeling
in the artist that impels him to, and accompanies art-
production, is reproduced in us (in varying intensity) with
out conscious, rational, analytical identification of the details
that reproduce it. The details, in fact, were not the
important thing to the artist : the differentiating and deter
mining thing was his feeling. A great part, if not the
whole, of the art of painting consists in such selection of
details as will allow the sub-conscious conveyance of the
feeling embodied in the picture. The picture will then, and
then only, be truly seen ; and much of the seeing will be
of the nature of a hallucination.
The efficacy of music in deepening consciousness and
clarifying certain perceptions is even more conspicuous than
that of visible art. Richard Wagner's essay on Beethoven,
elaborating and applying Schopenhauer's theory of music, and
to be read with his theory of hallucinations, is a pre
eminently suggestive exposition of the metapsychics of music.
The particular achievement of music to which the speaker
desired to call especial attention is its faculty of establishing
sympathetic relations between individual minds. Every art
does this in so far as it succeeds in freeing the consciousness
from its habitual engrossments. But music has the reputa
tion of being pre-eminently the food of love and the handmaid
of religion because of its exceptional efficacy in hypnotising
the every-day consciousness and giving scope for activity to the
sub-conscious personality, which, as it thereupon receives new
impressions into consciousness, gives them forms which are de
termined by the influences immediately acting upon it, so that
sub-conscious attunements and reciprocal reaction of personali
ties become a conscious sympathy and a felt attraction.
The signification attached to the idea of "sub-conscious
MAT, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 75
personality" or "subliminal self" in connexion with the
argument of this paper formed the subject of a digression
too long to summarise, leading on to the consideration of
phenomena of sympathetic personal rapport. A perfectly
normal effect of the association of certain persons is to re
inforce the mental faculties, or particular faculties, of each of
them, as the power of an optical glass is reinforced by the
addition of a lens. This is a normal experience in that it
occurs more or less unmistakeably to most people : but it is
not for most people a very common experience, which is the
reason why one notices it and is sure of it as a fact when
it does occur. The relation of the two minds may make itself
felt by apparent experiences of thought-transference, or rapid
and instantaneous intelligence on the faintest hints or sug
gestions, or merely by the stimulation and extension of self-
contained faculty in each.
Falling in love is one of the most common and significant
instances in which a certain mode of hypnotism introduces
not only a kind of hallucinations, but also telepathic
sensibility, great enhancement of direct mental rapport, ex
tension and intensification of consciousness and marked
accession of energy and faculty, sometimes to an extra
ordinary degree and with most substantial results. This is
true of love in general : but the characteristics are most
familiarly exhibited in the specialised form of love between
the sexes. The specialised sex-attraction, however, is only
one of the many hypnotic agencies affecting the developments
of consciousness which come into range in this relation. Even
the beauty which the lover, in all relations of love, imputes
to the person loved, is in a degree hallucinatory, just as are
the intelligence, the wit, and the other exalted qualities that
we discover in our particular friends. But the hallucination
has a " veridical " basis, and the lover is always more in
the right than are outsiders to whom the sub-conscious touch
is not vouchsafed. It cannot be disputed that love, whether
quickened thus by sex or race-relation, or standing full-
grown in the liberty of its own nature, can see the form and
aspect of the personality it embraces with a truth of sight as
far beyond that of others as is the truth of sight of one of
the great painters of personalities. All love is hyperaesthetic,
76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1906.
particularly, perhaps, that of mother for child: the imaginations
of lovers with regard to their reciprocal sensibility are certainly
not wholly baseless.
Next to love, religion is the most important of the common
modes of extension of conscious perception. Professor W. James'
Hibbert Lectures on " Varieties of Religious Experience" may
be referred to as indicating the place of this topic in rela
tion to the idea of this paper. Without desiring to advance
anything as to the ultimate source and significance of religious
experience, it is important to emphasise that the dogmas and
rituals of all popular religions are Art-forms of varying genius
and crudity : essentially hypnotic symbols, whose function is
to give scope for the incarnation of elements of the sub-con
scious self. We need a very careful graduated survey of the
methods by which this extension of consciousness is induced,
and the influx manifested of what, under these conditions,
at one end of the scale is identified as Divine Spirit, and at
the other exhibits characteristics indistinguishable from those
imputed as peculiar to the Author of Evil. The series of
the manifestations stretches unbroken from the Dervish to
the Salvationist, from the African Witch-Doctor to West
minster Cathedral.
It is in the crudities of aesthetic, amatory, and religious
impressions that we catch the normal person in the act of
experiencing extensions of consciousness, suddenly surprised
out of himself and formulating his new experience. There
will be vagaries in his formulation ; he will hear, see, feel,
and be convinced according to his idiosyncrasy. But his formu
lation, the thing he believes himself to see, hear, feel, or know,
will have some real relation to the influence that produced it.
The arrest of the superficial consciousness by Art, natural
beauty, or other of the great sympathetic influences gives
liberty of expression to the direct, subsensory impression,
which can then itself be brought up into the world of sense
and expressed in aesthetic or rational formulas. A com
petent treatment of aesthetics from this point of view would
do much towards enabling us to see the connexion between
those abnormal visions which have a true psychical basis and
our normal sense of sight.
At the conclusion of the paper, a discussion followed.
MAT, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 77
THE MEDIUMSHIP OF MR. C. BAILEY.
IN the Eeporb of the Council for the year 1904, printed in
the Journal for March, 1905, reference was made (p. 46) to a
professional medium, Mr. Bailey, whose performances in
Australia, especially in the production of apports, have become
widely known in the spiritualistic world. Dr. C. W. MacCarthy,
a medical man residing in Sydney, held a number of sittings
with Mr. Bailey there, and afterwards published an account
of them in a pamphlet entitled, " Rigid Tests of the Occult "
(reprinted from the Harbinger of Light, Melbourne). He
sent this pamphlet to us, together with original letters from
a number of the sitters confirming the statements made in his
report ; also a selection of the apports,—chiefly coins and clay
tablets,—produced at the sittings, with the request that we
should submit them to experts in England for an opinion as to
whether they were what the medium stated them to be, viz.,
genuine ancient coins, Egyptian, Hindoo, etc., and Babylonian
or Assyrian tablets.
We may first describe briefly the conditions under which
these apports are stated in Dr. MacCarthy's pamphlet to have
been produced. Two series of sittings were held,—in March,
1903, and in June and July 1903.
Of the first series, six sittings were held at the Queen's
Hall, Pitt Street, Sydney, and two at Dr. MacCarthy's own
house, the sitters being in all cases selected by Dr. MacCarthy
and his Committee. It was agreed upon beforehand that Mr.
Bailey should be carefully searched before each sitting by two
or three of the sitters and then enveloped in a bag, leaving
his head and hands free, the bag to be tied closely around
the wrists and neck and then sealed, and the seals to be
examined after each sitting. This bag was provided by Dr.
MacCarthy. It was also arranged that care should be taken
to prevent Mr. Bailey's having free access to the stance room ;
that the door of the room should be locked prior to and during
each sitting, and that the key should be kept by some one
selected by Dr. MacCarthy for the purpose. The stance room
also was as a rule carefully searched beforehand, and in some
cases the sitters were searched as well as the medium, as a
precaution against possible collusion.
78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.
In the reports of the separate sittings few or no specific details
are given as to the 'searching of the medium (except in the case
of the second sitting held at Dr. MacCarthy's house), and in
only two cases, besides this last-mentioned sitting, are the
names of searchers mentioned ; but the account seems to imply
that different searchers were selected each time.
A general description of the method of searching is given
later on in the pamphlet, pp. 37-39 ; no specific statement is
made here as to which of the medium's clothes were removed,
and it may be noted that the accounts of the searching given
in different places in the pamphlet vary considerably. There
seems no doubt, however, that as a general rule (see pp. 37
and 100), only the outer garments were taken off and searched,
and that the sitters contented themselves with feeling and
pressing the under-garinents and the body of the medium
through them ; nor, as a rule, were the boots and socks taken
off (p. 38). The under-garments are incidentally described
later on (p. 103) as " web under-pants and a flannel bandage
worn for medical reasons." Dr. MacCarthy states explicitly (p.
103) that he, " with other sane people," considered the complete
removal of the clothes entirely unnecessary and only consented
to it on one or two occasions " in order to give no loophole
to outsiders." He observes also that in general this point
was "not considered of importance by the searchers." The
search of the body, if carried on according to the ideal described
(p. 101), seems to have been fairly complete.
All the sittings of the first series were held in the evening,
beginning at 8 p.m., and the amount of light was arranged
as directed by the " controls," the light being almost invariably
extinguished before the apports were produced and not turned
up until the " control " announced that he had " got something."
The summary that follows relates almost exclusively to the
apports,
At the first sitting no apports were produced. At the second
one, held on March 6th, 1903, the following appeared: a live
bird sitting on a nest ; three clay tablets, said to have been
transported on the spot from the site of Babylon, some stones
said to be Burmese rubies, and an Egyptian scarabaeus.
At the third sitting, on March 9th, three objects were
heard to fall, with a good deal of noise, on the floor ; then
MAT, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. 0. Bailey. 79
seven coins were handed to Dr. MacCarthy, and described by
the " control " as " valuable ancient coins brought from
Egypt,"—some ancient Eoman and some ancient Egyptian, of
the Greek period.
At the fourth sitting, on March llth, a small live bird
appeared, also a clay tablet, which broke on falling to the
ground.
At the fifth sitting, on March 13th, the "control" handed
to Dr. MacCarthy a sea-crab. Soon after, when the light
was turned on, a shovel-nosed shark, about a foot and a half
long, was seen in the hand of the medium, and on the table
a quantity of wet sea-weed. On the light being again
extinguished, some ancient coins were produced.
The next sitting was held at Dr. MacCarthy's house on
March 16th, when some coins, said to be Ptolemaic, were
produced, also a clay object, 5 or 6 inches long, said to be
a " Babylonian cylinder," and a newspaper in strange characters
said to be Arabic.
On March 17th, the sitting was held at Queen's Hall,
as before ; the Hindoo control now performed what he described
as "some Hindoo magic." On a piece of paper about the size
of a face he drew rough outlines of eye-sockets, nose and
mouth. He then put it on a piece of black cloth on the
table, and arranged a cardboard lamp-shade over it. On the
light being turned out, this paper face or skull was seen to
be luminous, and became brighter and brighter. The control
took up the lamp-shade with the black cloth and paper
skull and passed it round the circle for the sitters to see.
They all saw plainly " a luminous object resembling a human
skull," and one lady on seeing it fainted. The control
remarked that if this had not happened he would have
caused the paper skull to leave the lamp-shade and float about
the room. Next a sound as of a falling stone on the table
was heard, and this was said to be a piece of gold ore.
Then something soft fell on the table, described by the
control as an Indian cake, which had just been taken out
of an oven in India. When felt it was found to be " still
hot"
The last sitting of this series was held on March 19th
at Dr. MacCarthy's house. It had been agreed between him
80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1905.
and one of the controls (" Dr. Whitcombe " J) that if possible
some simple jewels or old coins should be produced at this
sitting. Accordingly, some time after the the sitting began,
the light having been turned up, the Hindoo control raised a
little fan which had been left for his use on the small table
before him (as, the report here states, had been the custom
at the other sittings) and underneath it a number of precious
stones, mostly uncut, were seen. These were distributed to
the sitters. The light was then extinguished, and soon after
the rattle of coins was heard. The light being next turned
on, a number of ancient coins, said to be Egyptian, were
produced.
Following the report of these sittings, the pamphlet gives
a summarised list of the apports,—especially the clay tablets
and cylinder, with descriptions of the figures and inscriptions
on the latter by the control " Dr. Robinson " (who was said
to have been professor of Syro-Chaldaic literature in the
Theological Seminary in New York2), and translations by the
same control of the inscriptions. Illustrations of many of the
apports are also given.
At the second series of sittings, Mr. Bailey was placed in
a sort of cage, instead of in the bag previously used. This
cage was a square wooden frame, 6£ feet high, 4 feet long,
and 4 feet broad ; the top and sides were covered with mos
quito netting and the cage was placed over the medium
(after he had been searched) and then screwed down to the
floor.
The first four sittings of this series were again held in
the Queen's Hall, Sydney, apparently under the same general
conditions as before. At the first, on June 1st, 1903, two
live birds and a bird's nest were produced ; one bird and
the nest mysteriously disappeared, the other bird remaining.
Also an Indian cap, with gold and silver wire embroidery,
and eight Ptolemy coins were produced.
1 Dr. MacCarthy in a letter to us says that the Medical Directory (British)
for 1875 gives " Whitcomb, Hy. Moroney, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia,
M.R.C.S., Eng. 1857."
2 In a letter to us, Dr. MacCarthy says that he has verified most of the
statements about Dr. Edward Robinson from the Imperial Dictionary of
Universal Biography, London, 1868, Vol. VI., p. 829.
MAT, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 81
At the second sitting on June 4th, the apports were : a
live bird, ten ancient coins, a newspaper from Scinde, in
Arabic characters, Hindu language, and a leopard skin rug,
3 feet 1£ inches long and over 2£ feet wide at the shoulder,
said to have been brought from a bazaar in Delhi. The
third sitting %vas for materialisations.
At the fourth sitting on June llth, the covering of the cage
was made more secure, and the medium, after being searched,
was placed in a bag inside the cage. The apports then pro
duced were : a live bird, a nest with one egg, sixteen coins,
a shrub about 5 ins. high. The bird and coins were left,
the other objects disappeared.
At the next sitting held at Dr. MacCarthy's house on June
15th, the cage alone was used. The apports were: a pair of
satin slipper shapes, silver embroidered in Indian fashion, four
coins, a shrub 4 or 5 ins. high, which afterwards dis
appeared, and a number of cut jewels.
The next sitting was again held at Dr. MacCarthy's house
on June 20th, under similar conditions to the last. The
apports were : a bird which disappeared, a bird's nest, ten
coins.
The next sitting, on June 25th, also held at Dr. MacCarthy's
house, seems to have been the only one at which, during the
search, all the medium's clothes were taken off. He was then
re-dressed in other clothes, not his own, also searched, and
then taken into the seance room and, " as usual, placed in
the cage with a chair, small table, and fan " (it is not stated
in the reports of the previous sittings that these objects were
placed in the cage with the medium, but the phrase used
here, p. 109, suggests that this was the custom throughout).
A small flower-pot was also put in the cage. The apports
were : three moon-stones, eight coins, a small plant in the
flower-pot.
At the next sitting at Dr. MacCarthy's house, on July 3rd,
a pair of the largest size boxing-gloves were—without previous
warning—placed on Mr. Bailey's hands, after he had been
searched and put into the cage. It was supposed that these
gloves would prevent the medium from manipulating or
abstracting hidden articles from his clothing. Two strings
were tied on each wrist, one round the glove and the other
82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1905.
higher up, connected with the glove string, and both
knots on each wrist sealed. The cage was then screwed
down to the floor. After some preliminary talk the light
was put out ; and almost immediately a hard thing was
heard to fall inside the cage, and a few seconds later a
second hard thing fell. On the light being turned up the
medium was seen with the gloves on and two clay tablets—
one broken—were seen on the floor by him. It was then
decided to take off the gloves, after examining them to see
that the seals were unbroken. Mr. Bailey was instead put
into the bag inside the cage, which was again screwed down
to the floor. The following apports were then produced: two
live birds, a bird's nest, 14 coins, an Egyptian scarabaeus,
and a plant about 5 ins. high.
The next sitting described took place before this one, viz.
on July 1st, also at Dr. MacCarthy's house, the medium being
then only put into the cage after being searched. The apports
were : two clay tablets, a Bedouin Arab woman's head-dress,
a witch-doctor's belt, and a " magic " plant about 6 ins. high,
which afterwards disappeared.
The remainder of the part of the report relating to apports
deals with cases that occurred " spontaneously " in full day
light or gaslight, not at sittings, and when the medium had
neither been searched previously nor was under any control
at the time. For reasons not explained, the investigators
appear to have considered these cases no less remarkable nor
evidential than the cases of apports produced at sittings. These
apports consisted of:
(1) Several clay tablets, as a rule larger than those pro
duced at the sittings, the latter being from 2£ to 3£ ins.
long, and If to 2£ ins. broad, and the former from 3J to 4J
ins. long, and 2£ to 3f ins. broad; (2) a number of coins
and precious stones ; (3) two turtles, one small enough to
be placed in a cap, the second a " good-sized " ona
We quote from Dr. MacCarthy's pamphlet a few typical
instances of these apports ; some of which may be held to
suggest that Mr. Bailey is not unacquainted with certain well-
known conjuring tricks.
(P. 5) I may here mention that on the same day [March 6th,
1903], about 11.30 a.m., another tablet of a somewhat similar nature,
MAT, 1905. The Mediumahip of Mr. C. Bailey. 83
but having on it two figures in has relief, fell in broad daylight
into my study in presence of the Sensitive and myself, the Sensitive
having been suddenly controlled by the Hindu in the course of
conversation with me. The tablet in falling, struck and indented
the edge of a piece of mahogany furniture. This remarkable
phenomenon was no doubt made possible by the perfect sympathetic
link and other favourable psychic conditions at the time between
the Sensitive and myself.
(P. 121) EXTRACT FROM MR. R.'s DIARY.
"June 2, 1903. Called at Mr. X[Dr. MacCarthy]'s house.
Found Mr. Bailey present. After some conversation between Mr. X.,
Mr. Bailey and myself, I noticed that Mr. Bailey was going under
control Dr. Whitcombe took possession, and subsequently the Hindu
Abdul, both controls talking to us in a general way.
After about half an hour the medium became normal. Saying
he felt cold he sat before the fire and wanned his hands. He
remarked his feet were cold, and pulled off one boot and felt his
foot. Replacing the boot he sat down again, and leaning forward
towards the fire he placed his hands over the blaze. Instantly,
while both his hands were still over the blaze, something was heard
to strike the back support of the wooden chair upon which he sat,
and I distinctly saw fall upon the floor at his right a clay tablet.
I picked it up and found it to be quite damp. There was some
figure on the flat side. On the right back support of the chair we
found a fresh dint where evidently the tablet had struck.
I consider this to be a fine test of Mr. Bailey's mediumship. There
was no possibility of his throwing the tablet, as his hands were over
the fire. The room door was closed and only we three within. I
was standing next to the medium, and in such a position that I
could have at once seeu any manipulation. Mr. X. was standing
beside me. I was between him and Mr. Bailey, and the tablet
struck the chair on the side away from both of us, so that neither
Mr. X. nor myself could possibly have thrown it in such a position
had we chosen."
DECLARATION.—I declare the above details are truly given.
(Signed) X.
(P. 126) My bedroom, Thursday, June 11, 1903, 12 noon.
A medical friend, Dr. F., and myself sat with Mr. Bailey, he
sitting in front of the window, we sitting close to him.
84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1905.
Hindu Abdul controlled. I said : " Will you bring my friend,
Dr. R, something ? " He replied : " Me try." Looking upward he
slowly raised his left hand, the palm being in view, the fingers
separated. Still keeping his gaze fixed upwards, he grasped at some
thing in mid-air, and opening his hand when in the act of lowering
it, before it was lowered, and without bringing the other hand near it,
we saw in it a Ptolemy coin. N.B.—Palming was precluded, the
palms being in evidence, the fingers separated. Sleeving was im
possible because of the still raised position of the hand when opened,
and the non-inclining of fingers towards the sleeve. Other sleight-of-
hand means were impossible, because of invariably slow movement
and non-contact with other hand, the body or clothes.
DECLARATION.—The above particulars are correctly given.
F.
(P. 127) Miss S., who was present with the Sensitive and myself,
records this sitting as follows :—
" Having been promised by the Hindu, Abdul, two stones for a
ring, I came by appointment to the house of Mr. X. on Monday,
June 29, 1903, arriving about 4.20 p.m. Mr. Bailey arrived at
the same moment. We both came in together, and went straight
together to the room for the sitting, where we expected Mr. X. to
join us. He had gone out and had not yet returned. Mr. Bailey
sat on a chair close to the window, and about two yards from the
fireplace. We chatted until Mr. X. arrived, about half-past four.
The three of us then sat close together. Suddenly Mr. Bailey was
controlled by Abdul, who addressed in some foreign language an
invisible person whom he called Selim. He said Selim had gone
for the promised stones. In half a minute or so he said : ' They
here now ; me not catch them in hand ; you might think me had
them there. Where you think they are?' We could not guess.
He went over to the mantelpiece and, while we stood by, he lightly
laid hold of the top of a stethoscope resting on it, lifted it slowly
up and there were the two stones underneath. He then sat again
on the chair (a large arm chair), we opposite to him, and while
chatting to us with his hands on his knees, there fell at his right
side, apparently from a height, judging by the force of the fall,
six coins. We picked them up. They were thick coins, covered
with various Oriental inscriptions. ..."
The articles sent by Dr. MacCarthy for our examination
were described as follows :
MAT, 1906. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 85
(A) Apports:
(a) Coins: (1) packet containing one ancient Persian, one
ancient Grecian, one modern Cairo, and twelve old Indian coins;
(2) packet containing twenty-one Ptolemy coins ; (3) packet
containing eleven Roman coins, of the early Christian period,
and one scarab.
(I) Clay tablets, seventeen in number. Of these, seven, in
cluding the " Babylonian cylinder," were produced at the first
series of sittings. The marks on them are described as inscrip
tions, of which the control Dr. Eobinson professed to give
translations, which are printed in the pamphlet ; one was said
to be a copy-book tablet ; another a tablet of weights and
measures ; and a third has on it the figure of a " lion-headed,
eagle-footed man." A long translation is given of the alleged
cuneiform writing on the Babylonian cylinder.
The tablet that fell in Dr. MacCarthy's study on March
6th, 1903, (see above) is also included ; it has on it two figures,
alleged to represent " Bel Merodach casting out Tiamut, the evil
spirit."
Of the remaining tablets, four were produced at the sittings
of the second series, two on July 3rd and two on July 1st
(see above) ; the other five were produced " spontaneously," not
at sittings. One of these came while Mr. Bailey was warming
his hands over the fire in Dr. MacCarthy's house on June
2nd, as described above. It has on it a figure of the upper
half of a man's body. Another one fell in the Queen's Hall,
Sydney, in full gas-light, and was broken in the fall. The
remaining three have figures on, described respectively as
Sennacherib sitting on his throne, a winged Assyrian bull, and
the Assyrian Hercules strangling a lion.
(B) Other objects :
(a) A series of excellent photographs of the above and of
the other apports described in the pamphlet ; also a photograph
of Mr. Bailey, and one of a corner of the stance room
showing the cage- covered with mosquito netting and the
window and fire-place similarly covered.
(6) A small piece of the mosquito netting used for covering
the cage.
(c) The bag used to secure the medium in the second series
86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 190*
of sittings. This is made of stout black sateen, in the shape
of a night-shirt, closed at the bottom and with long wide sleeves.
The body part is made of a single piece, folded once, and the
sides sewn together to form a bag. Each sleeve is also made
of a single piece, with one seam on the under side, and is let
in to the body part close to the top, the shoulder seam being
continued into a gusset at the neck. A piece of tape is run
into a hem at the neck, to be drawn up and tied round the neck
when the medium was in. Similarly there is a wide hem at
the end of each sleeve, arranged for a tape to be run in, in
such a way that when this tape is pulled up tight and tied
round the wrist, the remainder of the hem projects beyond it
as a sort of frill, a little over an inch wide.
The security of this bag as a means of control depends
exclusively on the tightness of the tapes round the wrists and
neck. Supposing that the medium could draw one hand
backwards out of the wristband (and it must be remembered
that he had both hands free to work with), he could with
draw the arm through the sleeve into the main part of the
bag, could then take up any object he had hidden there on
his person or in his clothes, and could push this out through
the hole at the end of the sleeve into his other hand, and
then get the first hand into position again. We have verified
this by experiment with the bag, and a friend of ours
found another method by which, if the string round the neck
is at all slack—as it is almost certain to be—objects can be
produced out of this bag by a person tied up in it
It is also very doubtful whether the boxing gloves used
on July 3rd (see p. 81 above) would have prevented manipula
tion of concealed objects by the medium. Their large size
must have tended to prevent the strings being tied very
tight round them, and it seems by no means impossible
that the medium should have withdrawn one hand, leaving
the glove dangling on his wrist by the second string, and
then got his hand back into the glove again. The strings
and seals would in that case remain intact.
With regard to the apports, Sir Oliver Lodge obtained from
experts at the British Museum the following statements:
MAV, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 87
DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTIAN AND ASSYRIAN ANTIQUITIES,
BRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON, W.C., 8th March, 1905.
MY DEAR SIR,
In the absence of Dr. Wallis Budge I beg to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter enclosing photographs of a collection of
coins and of some supposed antiquities. The coins are genuine, but
are not of any value or rarity. I have shown the photographs of
them to Mr. Rapson of the Dept. of Coins and Medals, and
enclose the report he has written. All the supposed Babylonian
and Assyrian antiquities are forgeries. They fall into three classes :
I. Seven of the tablets have figures upon them. These have
been suggested to the forger by well known sculptures found at
Kuyunjik (Nineveh) and Khorsabad. They have probably been
copied from the illustrations in Layard's " Nineveh and Babylon "
and "Nineveh and its Remains." What are intended for cuneiform
signs at the sides of the figures are not genuine.
II. The six tablets without figures upon them are intended
for Babylonian or Assyrian inscribed tablets, but are very clumsy
imitations.
III. The cylinder is not genuine, though it has been made by
a cleverer forger than the other objects.
There is a scarab among the Ptolemaic coins, and this may be
genuine, but it is not possible to tell from the photograph. This
is the only one of the objects that it would be worth while to
send here for examination.
With regard to the photographs ;—shall I return them to you
or would you like Dr. Budge to see them ? He will probably be
back from Egypt next week.
I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully,
LEONARD W. KING.
DEPARTMENT OF COINS AND MEDALS,
BRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON, W.C., 8th March, 1905.
There is nothing rare or valuable among the coins.
The copper coins of the Ptolemies may be obtained from the
dealers for a few pence each.
Of the oriental coins, the following modern states are re
presented :—Haidarabad, Indore, Baroda, Nawanaga, East India
Company. There is one Sassanian coin, and one modern Egyptian.
There is nothing of any value or rarity. The same remark applies
88 Journal of Society far Psychical Research. MAT. 1905.
to the Roman coins—which seem to be chiefly of Constantine the
Great. E. I. RAPSON.
Dr. Budge himself wrote later to Sir Oliver Lodge as
follows :
DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTIAN AND ASSYRIAN ANTIQUITIES,
BRITISH MUSE™, LONDON, W.C., 14</t March, 1905.
DEAK SIR,
Mr. King has shewn me the letters which you sent here
during my absence, and also the photographs which you submitted.
I have read his remarks to you, and I am fully in agreement with
him. The photographs are from poor copies of well-known objects
and drawings, and the things from which they were made are
"forgeries," similar to large numbers which I have seen in Baghdad,.
Kazmain, and parts of Persia. They resemble the work made by
Jewish dealers in those places and in Southern Russia. . . .
I am, yours very truly,
E. A. WALLI.S BUDGK
On April 18th, the Secretary took the clay tablets and coins
to the British Museum to show to Dr. Budge. He reiterated
the opinion he had formed from the photographs, which he
said were amply sufficient to enable an expert to judge of
the nature of the objects. He also showed the Secretary
a number of spurious tablets in the Museum, which were
very similar to those produced by Mr. Bailey, but as a rule
more skilfully and elaborately worked.
The current number of the Annals of Psychical Science contains
a careful account by M. C<5sar Vesme of the sittings held
with Mr. Bailey in Italy last summer, and we propose to-
give in the next number of the Journal a report by Mr.
A. W. Dobbie of some other sittings in Australia.
CORRECTION.
A correspondent has kindly pointed out to us an error in-
calculation in the April Journal (p. 57). It was there stated
that Mr. C.'s experience at about 8 p.m. on December 7th
occurred about 13 hours after Mr. W.'s death at midnight on
December 6th at Bombay. Noon at Greenwich is 4.51 p.m.
at Bombay, so that the difference of time between the two
events should have been stated as about 25 hours.

GENEKAL MEETING.
THE 125th General Meeting of the Society was held in the
large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Thursday,
May llth, 1905, at 4.15 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the
chair.
THE PRESIDENT, PROFESSOR CHARLES RICHKT, read a paper
entitled " Quelques Observations de Clairvoyance." He re
marked that well authenticated cases in which some degree
of acquaintance with foreign languages was shown auto
matically by persons who had not acquired that knowledge
by normal means rarely, if ever, occurred.
After eliminating from his consideration certain cases in
volved in the mist of legend, he referred to the example
given by M. Flournoy. His medium, Hcjlene Smith, tran
scribed, with many mistakes, some words of Sanscrit without
being able to make intelligible sentences out of them. But
M. Flournoy had well explained that she had probably
" absorbed what she knew of Sanscrit " by glancing at a
grammar which was kept in a room which she had occasionally
visited.
The matter of which the speaker was about to treat was
the writing of phrases, sentences, even of pages of Greek
by a person who did not know Greek. The person who had
written these Greek phrases in a state of somnambulism or
of half-consciousness was a lady 34 years of age, who was

not a professional medium. He would call her Mme. X.
He first saw Mme. X. in Paris in November, 1899, their
common friend, Mr. Frederic Myers, having arranged the
meeting. On that occasion Mme. X. almost lost conscious
ness, and in a state of trance, her eyes closed, wrote with
difficulty in pencil a sentence in Greek. It was really two
sentences run into one, and it contained certain mistakes.
Mme. X. wrote slowly and painfully, and with a sort of
convulsive trembling. On awakening she seemed to have no
recollection of what she had written. The sense of the
first sentence written was, " Human wisdom is of small
account, and, indeed, is nothing." The sense of the second
was, " I am already about to leave you." He did not know
whether the first sentence was to be found in the classical
authors ; the second, which he at first believed to be in the
New Testament, occurred in Pluto, at the end of the Apology
of Socrates. Some days afterwards, being again in a trance,
Mme. X. wrote some more Greek words, signifying " Greet
ing ' I am the all-powerful (?) I speak through Antoine
Kenouard. Give thanks to God." Antoine lienouard was the
name of M. liichet's great grandfather, Antoine Augustin
llenouard, publisher and book-collector in Paris (1770-1853),
who had published several editions of Greek authors. Some
other communications, also signed by him, were given at
about the same time—in November and December, 1899.
Another sentence was written in Greek by Mme. X. in the
month of June, about 7.30 p.m. They were in a small
room together, and the sun was setting. The sentence trans
lated was, " When the sun is declining or rising, the shadows
grow longer." This sentence, he afterwards found, appeared
textually in the Greek-French and French-Greek dictionary of
Byzantios and Coromelas, published at Athens in 1856 (first
edition, 1846). For a long time no other Greek phrase was
given, but in 1904 another sentence, which was found later to
appear in the same dictionary, was forthcoming. Subsequently
Mme. X. sent him a communication written in Greek, in four
parts of unequal length, and in characters of unequal size.
It was discovered, almost by accident, that the first part
was a translation of a passage in Pavl et Virginie. It was
impossible to find a Greek translation of Paul et Virginie, so
JUNE, i'JOf>. General Meetiny. 93
lie addressed himself to Dr. Vlavianos, of Athens, telling him
what he wanted and why he wanted it. Dr. Vlavianos replied
that three of these Greek passages were to be found textu-
ally in the dictionary of Byzantios and Corotn^las, and sent
him the dictionary, of the existence of which he was up till
then entirely ignorant. In the MS. of Mme. X. there were
errors which did not appear in the original. Latterly in his
presence Mme. X. had written quite a long sentence similar to
the others, and derived from the same source—the dictionary
of Byzantios.
Professor Kichet expressed himself as being absolutely
convinced of the good faith of Mine. X. Her MSS. were
in modern Greek, of which, as of ancient Greek, she was
entirely ignorant. Moreover, she had, as far as she knew,
never seen the dictionary of Byzantios until after all the
phrases written by her and contained in the dictionary had
been written. In addition to this, the mistakes made by her
in writing Greek were such as no one acquainted in the
least with that language, even a beginner, would make. She
wrote Greek like a person who did not understand it. Her
writing was in a trembling hand, just as would be that of a
person who did not write Greek fluently, but had copied it
without being able to read it, as if from a representation
which she had before her. For this and other reasons which
he detailed, and which had perhaps no less force than his con
fidence in Mme. X., he considered the hypothesis of fraud—
learned, complicated, prolonged, astute, implying the possession
and the study of Byzantios's book—as being absurd. The
hypothesis of unconscious memory, as well as that of spirits,
he also examined and expressed himself unable to accept.
There was, however, uo reason to ignore the facts, merely
because any explanations that could be offered were absurd
or insufficient. It was better to say simply that we were
in the presence of the unexplained.
SIR OLIVER LODGE in commenting on the remarkable case
of Mme. X., said that it was important to observe that the
errors in the Greek quotations given by her were in all
cases such errors as a person might make in transcribing
symbols that for him were meaningless. Everything, of course,
must depend in such a case upon the good faith of the
94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1905.
medium, on which, however, Professor Eichet had every
reason to depend. He further drew an analogy between this
apparent power of Mme. X.'s and the power possessed by
infant prodigies of carrying out artistic and intellectual per
formances which they certainly had not learnt in the ordinary
way. In particular he referred to the case of the Spanish
child Pepito, who, at two years of age, played on the piano
a tune which he had heard his mother play. When perform
ances of this kind were rationally explained, he thought we
might understand such a case as Mme. X.'s.
MRS. VERKALL said that the President's paper seemed to
throw some light on her own experiments in the same direc
tion. As to the quotations given by Mme. X. being subsequently
found in a book to which she was not aware of having had
access, she (Mrs. Verrall) had come across the same curious
and seemingly suspicious characteristic in her own experience.
She referred to a case mentioned in a paper she had read
before the Society last year,1 when a Greek quotation was
obtained by means of table-tilting, a reference being given
to Heliodorus, where they afterwards found the substance,
but not the exact words, of the automatic message. The
difference between this case and that of Mme. X. was
presumably due to the fact that the mediums in the former
case were well acquainted with the language, while Mme. X.
knew no Greek, so that her writing seemed to be derived
from some visual representation of the Greek words, whereas
in the other case the representation was intellectual.
MR. PODMORE observed that he could not quite agree with
Professor Richet that the theory of unconscious memory was
inadequate to explain Mme. X.'s case. Professor Richet had
already mentioned the somewhat similar case of Helene Smith,
and there were a few other examples on record ; e.g. the
case given by Mesnet 2 of the soldier who, after being
severely wounded in the Franco-Prussian war, relapsed
into an automatic state, in which he once wrote with his
eyes bandaged a consecutive letter on half-a-dozen different
sheets of paper, the sheets being removed successively after
he had written a few lines on each, when he always con

tinued on the next at a point corresponding to where he
had left off on the preceding page. On reaching the final
blank sheet, he went back to the top of the page and
inserted stops and corrections, etc., in the places where they
would have fallen had he written throughout on the last
sheet, thus showing that his memory had retained the
complete picture of what he had written, and was able to
reproduce it.
PROFESSOR BARRETT said that it would be interesting to
learn the conditions under which Mme. X.'s writings had
been produced, and whether there was any reason for suspect-
-ing unconscious guidance by any of the sitters during the
experiments. He recalled one case of a person, ignorant of
either Latin or Greek, who wrote various phrases in both
these languages when her shoulder was touched by an
experimenter well acquainted with them. He thought, how
ever, that the evidence accumulated up to the present tended
to prove that something in the nature of clairvoyance actually
did exist ; it was the only satisfactory solution he had so
far been able to find for some of the phenomena associated
with the Divining Rod.
THE PRESIDENT, in replying to the various comments made,
said in answer to Professor Barrett's question that there
had not in any case been contact between Mme. X. and
any sitter while these writings were produced.
OBITUARY.
C. C. MASSEY.
THE Society has recently lost through the death of Mr. C. C.
Massey one of its earliest and most valued friends. Though
in recent years he had taken no active part in the Society,
in its early days he was one of its most zealous and generous
supporters. Mr. Massey in fact formed one of that small
group of friends, of whom, alas, I am nearly the only one
remaining, to whom the foundation and early guidance of
our Society are due. It was in his rooms we used to meet
for consultation and Committee work, and to his generous
hospitality and ungrudging expenditure of time we were con
stantly indebted.
96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUKE, I90o.
A profound student both of philosophy and psychology,
and one of the most original and suggestive thinkers I have
ever known, it is deeply to be regretted he has left behind
him no work to make his name more widely known and
admired. Scattered papers from his pen are to be found in
the many volumes of Liijht, an occasional paper in our Pro
ceedings and in Mind, a printed essay here and there ; these
give no adequate idea of the width of his reading nor of the
originality of his thought. His name will, however, ever be
held in grateful memory by English students for his admirable
translation and annotation of Baron Carl du Prel's great work
on The Philosophy of Mysticism, published in two volumes by
G. Eedway in 1889. To this work Mr. Massey added a
most suggestive chapter by way of a Translator's Preface,
from which I should like to quote if space permitted ; but I
take this opportunity of begging those of our members who
have not read l>u Prel's work, at any rate to read the
preface which Mr. Massey has added ; a copy of the book is
contained in our Library.
But beyond and above his intellectual gifts and his passion
ate love of truth were the sweetness and beauty of his
character. One of the most unselfish and lovable of men,
ever modest and retiring, yet with a rare and resolute moral
courage, he was outspoken in espousing unpopular causes when
his judgment convinced him they were right ; he was indeed a
"Just and faithful knight of God."
His death is to me and many others who had the privilege
of his intimate friendship the great personal loss of an
ati'ectionate, large-hearted, and true friend.
Charles Carleton Massey was born December 23rd, 1838,
at Hackwood Park, Hasingstoke, the residence of his grand-uncle,
Lord Bolton. His father, to whom he was devotedly attached,
was a well-known member of Parliament, Under Secretary for
the Home Office and Chairman of Committees during Lord 1'al-
merston's administration, and afterwards Minister of Finance for
India ; and on his return from India became member for Tiver-
ton. C. C. Massey was educated at Westminster School, studied
law, and was called to the bar. He rapidly gained a consider
able practice tor so young a man, but his supreme interest
JUNE, 1U05. Obituary : C. G. Massey. 97
was the study of philosophy and psychology, especially of
those transcendental phenomena which now engage the at
tention of our Society. So great was his devotion to these
subjects that he threw up his practice and gave his time
wholly to long and laborious study of the literature of this
subject in all countries, especially the vast storehouse of
India. He only returned to the bar on the occasion of the
famous trial of Slade ; this medium he considered had been
most unfairly treated by Professor Ray Lankester, and hence
in the spirit of true chivalry he took up the defence without
fee and at great personal inconvenience and self-sacrifice.
Subsequently, after Professor Zb'llner had published the results
of his prolonged and careful investigation of Slade and em
bodied them in his well-known work on Transcendental
Physics, Mr. Massey translated the volume into English,
adding a lengthy and instructive preface of his own. He also
gave to English readers a translation of E. von Hartmann's
Spiritism.
During the last twenty- five years Mr. Massey, who never
married, had lived in chambers in Victoria Street, Westminster,
but much of his time was spent at the Athenteum Club, of which
he had long been a member. His death, on the 29th March
last, was due to heart-disease, from which he had been suffering
the last few years. His medical attendant, Dr. Simmons, of
Ashley Gardens, writes to me as follows :
Mr. Massey was practically under sentence of death the last two
years, and his heart was only kept going by avoidance of all exertion.
He was most wonderfully brave throughout, made no fuss, and always
considered other people more than himself. I kept him alive for
a month by hypodermics of strychnine twice daily. He had very
little actual suffering and lived his own life to the end, got up
and dressed almost every day, and retained all his faculties to
the last. We had many long talks together, and my daily inter
course with him for weeks before his death has been one of the
most valued experiences of my life. I often felt I was doing
him poor service in keeping him alive, when I felt convinced I
was only putting off the day of his birth into a life which he
was so peculiarly fitted to appreciate and enjoy. He often wondered
how, the body being gone, with all its multitudinous attachments
and interests dependent upon its physical nature, what would take
98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOKE, 1905.
the place of the physical world and give the mind material to
work upon. This seemed curious to me, as he lived here on
earth so much in an intellectual and spiritual atmosphere that
the body must have been to him a fetter ; existence and com
munion with friends, as he doubtless now knows, is likely to be
far more perfect without it.
A month or two before his death 1 wrote to Mr. Massey
asking him if he had put his scattered writings in a form suit
able for publication, and whether he would allow some of his
correspondence with myself and other friends to be published.
His reply was characteristic, deprecating his own share in any
originality of view, and giving me his matured thoughts on
human life here and hereafter ; an extremely touching and
beautiful letter, which some day I hope will be printed.
In a brief notice such as the present it is impossible to quote,
as one is tempted to do, from the many admirable contributions
Mr. Massey published in Light. I would, however, draw special
attention to his paper entitled " The Application to Spiritualism
of Scientific Research," published in Light for February 5, 1887.
In this paper Mr. Massey points out how few scientific in
vestigators of spiritualistic phenomena consider that their own
co-operation in the production of these phenomena may be a
necessary part of their manifestation. Obviously the first duty
of every scientific enquirer should be to see what are the proper
conditions necessary for the elicitation of psychical phenomena,
which are as dependent on their mental environment as physical
phenomena are on their material environment. The force of a
suspicious environment in preventing, or of a frigid environment
in inhibiting, psychical results, is not more improbable than the
effect of a damp or dusty environment in preventing the excita
tion of a Holtz electric machine. The circumstance that we
now happen to know the reason for the latter and do not
know the reason for the former, is no excuse for the wholly
unscientific neglect, and even ridicule, of the part played by
the investigator as well as by the medium. These elusive and
perplexing phenomena can never be studied by those who
imagine they are only called upon to play the role of an
amateur detective. On the other hand, the habit of calm and
dispassionate investigation, the cautious and critical spirit of
scientific enquiry, must not be relaxed ; and those who combine
JUNE, 1905. Obituary : C. C. Massey. 99
the dry and clear light of science with the kindly and sym
pathetic spirit need never fear that their investigations will
be either barren or useless.
In his later years Mr. Massey directed much thought to human
personality and its relation to the great Cosmos. Assured as
he was of the survival of personality after death, he nevertheless
became convinced that the phenomena of spiritualism neither
afforded, nor could ever afford, evidence of what we desire and
mean by immortality. In this I wholly agreed. " No external
science," he writes to me, " can demonstrate immortality nor
even raise a sure inference of it : the interest of many in
psychical research no doubt rests on its possible results in
affording such a demonstration ; this I hold to be an illusion,
and feel almost bound to enter a speculative protest against it."
What our investigations do teach us, and it is a transcendent
gain to our knowledge, is that life and intelligence can and
do exist in the unseen, and that here and there a strong prima
facie case exists for connecting such intelligence with discarnate
human personalities. But there is no experimental evidence
to show that the complete integrity of the personality is pre
served after death ; the evidence, in fact, is all the other way ;
still less is it possible for such evidence to establish the im
mortality of the soul, that is to say, its persistent survival and
expanding consciousness throughout the infinite future. Hence
Mr. Massey was led, as many others by far different paths
have been led, to the profound conviction that only through
what he was in the habit of terming the " process of the Cross,"
only through self-surrender, can self-realisation be truly attained.

CASE.
L. 1147. Dream.
The following case was obtained for us by an Associate
of the Society, Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of Gonville and Caius
College, Cambridge, and most of the confirmatory evidence was
collected by his efforts. The percipient, Mrs. Mann, writes
as follows :
KING'S FIELD, CAMBRIDGE, February llth, 1904.
On the night of Friday, January 22nd, 1904, I had a vivid
dream.
100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOKE, 1905.
I saw my old friend, Dr. X., who left Cambridge about 10
years ago, and I had not seen him since, sitting by my side. He
took hold of my hand saying, "Why have you not been to see
me 1 " I said, " Oh ! I've been so busy that I've not been able
to get away. You are so altered since I saw you last." " Yes," he
said, "but* that is so long ago." He then disappeared. The dream
so impressed me that I told it to my husband at breakfast the
next morning, Saturday 23rd, and also to a friend who knew the
doctor on the 25th.
On Saturday morning, the 30th, my husband at breakfast said
he had received a memorial notice of Dr. X.'s death, which took
place on the 23rd instant, the day after my dream.
S. MANN.
A. H. MANN.
Mrs. Siclgwiek writes :
NKWNHAM COLLKGK,
CAMBRIDGE, Fein-vary 19//i, 1904.
I called on Mrs. Mann this afternoon and she kindly talked very
fully about her experience. It was distinctly a dream, but a very
vivid and realistic one. It was brought to an end by her awaking.
In the dream she and Dr. X. seemed to be sitting on a sofa—
it might have been the one in her drawing room—and they talked
just as they used to do, his voice and manner unchanged. He had
been her medical attendant . . .; but he gave up his practice and
retired some 10 years ago, leaving Cambridge, and she had not
seen him since, though her husband had. ... In the dream his hair
and whiskers, which had been dark iron grey when Mrs. Manu
last saw him, were white. There had been no mention of Dr.
X. in conversation, nor had Mrs. Mann been thinking of him, and
she knows of nothing which would have been likely to suggest the
dream. She is quite sure that the dream occurred on the night of
Friday, January 22nd, and I think her recollection of this is indepen
dent of her knowledge of the date of the death, though she has nothing
very definite to remember it by. She told it on Saturday morning to
Dr. Mann and in the course of the day to Miss C . It was Miss
0 who on February llth wrote out the account of it, which Dr.
and Mrs. Mann signed. On Monday, January 25th, Mrs. Mann
told the dream to Miss T , and she has promised to ask her
to write an independent account. She showed me the memorial
notice of Dr. X.'s death on January 23rd. This reached Dr.
Mann on January 30th, as is shown by the post mark. Mrs.
JDNB, 1905. Case, 101
Mann does not remember having had any other vivid and realistic
dream that impressed her as this one did, nor any that made an
impression which she felt it worth while to mention next day. She
has, however, had presentiments; one of them was of her father's
illness and death a few days before he died suddenly. She once
saw what seemed to be an apparition—late one evening last summer
[of a relative who had lately died].
I will send these notes to Mrs. Mann and ask her to sign them
if they are correct. ELKANOR MILDRED SIDGWICK.
The above account was sent to Mrs. Mann and returned
by her to Mrs. Sidgwick with the statement that she thought
everything in it correct.
Mr. Stratton writes :
December 4th, 1904.
The friend [Miss T ] to whom Mrs. Mann mentioned her
dream, was unfortunately, through absence from England, not
approached for her account of the case until a considerable interval
had elapsed. As she was then unwilling to make any statement on
the matter, I may perhaps be allowed to mention that I had a short
conversation with her several weeks after the event; and that she
then spoke of Mrs. Mann's dream as curious, and showed that
she was at that time ignorant of the doctor's death. Unfortunately
the conversation was interrupted before I had an opportunity of
asking for her corroborative evidence.
I have also seen a pencil note that Dr. Mann made in his diary
under the date Saturday, " January 23rd : X. [full surname
given] Dream."
I heard of this note at the first, but could not manage to see it
till some six months later the old monthly diary, in which it was
written, was looked out for me to see. F. J. M. STKATTON.
Dr. X.'s son wrote to Mrs. Sidgwick as follows :
January loth, 1905.
. . . My father died on January 23rd, 1904, at about 4.30 a.m.
Though he had been an invalid for some years, his death was not
expected till a seizure 5 days before his death. During most of those
5 days he was unconscious, and was quite so for the last 36
hours or so before he passed away. His hair was by no means
white, though tinged with white—his whiskers were very consider
ably white, though not quite. . . .

AUTOMATIC EEVIVALS OF MEMORY.
WE give below two cases of the automatic revival of recollections
which had, it may be supposed, remained continuously in the
subliminal consciousness of the persons concerned. In the first
case the recollection was revived through a dream. This
seems to be the most usual method, and we have from time
to time printed instances of it, see, e.g. Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,
pp. 381-390. In the second case, the lost memory was, as it
appears, recovered through automatic writing, which would
naturally happen far less frequently, since it is, of course, far
less common to write automatically than to dream.
The first case was obtained through Mr. F. J. M. Stratton, of
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from Mr. L. G. Reed,
of King's College, Cambridge.
Mr. Reed writes :
January 25ih, 1905.
In the summer of 1901 I went into camp with the Durham
L. I. Volunteers. Whilst there I took some photographs which I
developed at home when I came back. The negatives were roll
films, and were neglected for some few days owing to stress of work.
When a fellow Volunteer asked me for a photograph I could not
find the films in my photograph cupboard, nor did a thorough
search in all possible drawers and cupboards bring them to light.
This was aggravating, for my friends would ask for prints very
frequently.
At last they slowly began to give up asking, but about a month
after I lost the negatives, another request reminded me of their
mishap, but as they were given up for lost, I thought no more
about it.
That night I had a vivid dream ; in fact, I am not subject to
dreaming, and I never remember having dreamt so "well" as to
remember much about it next day. But I did remember this one
in detail.
I dreamt that I knew where the negatives were, that I went and
found them there, and that I was not at all surprised at the occur
rence. Next morning I woke with the dream in my mind. I went
immediately to my father's wardrobe, took down an old coat, which
at times I wore indoors, and drew out the missing negatives. I
felt certain they were there, but could not think how they came to
be there. I felt I was merely repeating what I had done in my
JUNE, 1905. Automatic Revivals of Memory. 103
dream. As I never remember carrying negatives in my coat pockets
at any time, or even putting them in any pocket, the circumstance
that in the dream I " knew " that they were there is interesting.
No one in the house remembered placing them there, and consequently
I had no previous suggestions from them concerning the coat.
L. G. REED.
Mrs. Sidgwick adds :
NEWNHAM COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, February 27th, 1905.
I have seen Mr. Reed, who was introduced to me by Mr.
Stratton. He is an undergraduate at King's. It seemed clear on
questioning him that latent memory is the most probable explana
tion of his dream of the whereabouts of the lost films and I
think he has rewritten the account since I first saw it so as to
make this evident. ELEANOP. M. SIDGWICK.
The second case comes from Mrs. A. G. Dew-Smith, who
described it first in a letter to Mrs. Verrall as follows :
March 3rd, 1905.
. . . You remember I told you that I had lost two latch-keys of
the outside door here, and was much bothered. After I got back
I instituted a drawer to drawer search which went on for several
days without success. I felt my subconscious ego knew quite well
where they were, as I remembered that I had put them away
in some safe place—only keeping one out. . . . The other night
I had a sort of impulse to write and asked where my keys were,
and my pen wrote " Dodsworth "—the name of the manager of the
flats. I thought it most unlikely that he could throw any light
on their whereabouts ; but as I met him in the lift the next day
I said, "Do you remember those three keys you gave me of the out
side door?" "I only gave you one," he said, "you asked me
to keep the other two, and I have got them." I had completely
forgotten this, and thought "Dodsworth" so outside the mark that
I should not even have asked him but for meeting him just after.
Mrs. Verrall informs us that Mrs. Dew-Smith had told her of
the loss of the keys while on a visit to her from February
21st-23rd, 1905.
In reply to further questions Mrs. Dew-Smith writes :
March 14th, 1905.
Mr. Dodsworth had in the first instance given me the keys, but
I had so completely forgotten that he had (on my suggestion) kept
two back, that I remembered (or thought I did) putting them away
104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1905.
myself. During my search, which went on for a month or two,
Mr. Dodsworth's having anything to do with their loss did not once
occur to me, and except to ask him to provide two more, I should
not have thought of applying to him. So I do not think it could
have been either " a shrewder guess at what might have occurred
than I was able supraliminally to make," nor "merely a piece of
general advice—when in difficulty apply to Mr. Dodsworth," but
far more likely a case of revived memory. ALICE DEW-SMITH.
NOTES.
HKADEES of the Journal may remember that in the February
and March numbers of this year, we noted the fact that the
first volume of Mr. Myers's Human Personality had been
included in the list of books recommended for 1905 in the
section Metaphysics in the Fellowship Course of Trinity
College, Dublin. We now learn from one of our members,
Professor Eric Drew, of Madras University, that the University
of Madras had already adopted Human Personality as a text
book to be read for the M.A. two years' course in Psycho
logy. Professor Drew writes : " Myers's work was considered
so important that even before publication, which was later
than expected, the book had been set as a subject for 1905.
Its publication just allowed time for its reading. [The] 1905
course was fixed in 1903, before the book was out." He
sends us the three hours' examination paper set on the book
in the Madras M.A. Degree Examination of January, 1905.
In course of time—perhaps sooner than some of us are
now prepared to expect—we may find the book recognised
similarly by Mr. Myers's own University of Cambridge (to
which, by the way, Madras is affiliated), though the recog
nition may probably be delayed by the general historical

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
THE twelfth of the series of Private Meetings for Members and
Associates only was held in the large hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Thursday, June 29th, 1905, at 8.30
p.m. ; Professor W. F. Barrett in the chair.
The REV. A. T. FRYER read a paper on " Psychological
Aspects of the Welsh Revival of 1904."
JULY, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 107
The paper opened with a reference to two difficulties attached
to S.P.R. work, viz. inaccurate observation by witnesses, and the
unwillingness of persons who have had abnormal experiences
to relate them, or to permit examination of the evidence, this
being especially the case with events of a spiritual order.
As order and law obtain in all other departments of creation,
it was felt by the writer to be improbable that they should
be wanting in psychical or spiritual action. An account was
then given of the rise of the Eevival in 1904, first at New
Quay, Cardiganshire, and subsequently in more developed form
at Loughor, Glamorgan, with some notice of the aid given by
the press towards spreading interest in the movement. Then
followed a brief biography of Evan Eoberts, the most promi
nent of the Revivalists, whose methods have been followed
by others. Evan Roberts was classed with the mystics of
the Spanish and English school, his visions being somewhat
like those of Juliana of Norwich. The place occupied by
prayer in creating the atmosphere of the Revival and affect
ing numerous minds was described and the observations of
one who had attended various services read. The guiding
voice to which Roberts gives implicit obedience was shown
to be similar to the accounts of Socrates and his Daemon
quoted in Human Personality by Mr. Myers ; and this part
closed with the relation of instances of successful prediction.
The eloquence in prayer observed on the part of many
unlettered persons was shown to be in agreement with
the Welsh character. In the conversion of people the
fear of hell seems not to operate with many as a motive.
Instances were quoted of changes of countenance after con
version. Brief notice was paid to a narrative from a Welsh
collier who had, previous to his conversion, read widely in
psychological literature. Cases of apparent telepathy were
reported, in one of which the impression was visualised, with
several instances of auditised impressions. An interesting
account was given of a convert who claimed to have
experienced a conversation with the Holy Spirit, with
various visions similar in character to visions that occurred
to persons elsewhere. Lunacy has not been increased by
the religious excitement, the percentage of cases at the
Glamorgan County Asylum due to that cause being no
108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.
higher in 1904, last quarter, than in previous years. The
lights, objective and subjective, that have been seen by
various persons, mostly North Walians, formed an important
part of the inquiry. Cases of all descriptions were quoted,
and the conclusion reached was that the sub-conscious memory
of physical lights around the coast of Tremadoc Bay formed
the material used by the imagination, excited by religious
services and influences, in the formation of subjective appear
ances. A lengthy account was read of a well-attested " light "
incident in the Ehonddafach. Reference was made to Mr.
Beriah G. Evans' recent articles in the Occult Revieic. The
paper closed with an appeal to members to give attention to
spiritual phenomena.
MR. SYDNEY OLIVIER observed, in regard to Mr. Fryer's
reference to the racial differences between North and South
Wales, that in South Wales the psychical phenomena reported
seemed to be mainly auditory and in North Wales mainly
visual, and asked if Mr. Fryer thought this generalisation
justified.
MR. FRYER replied that he did not think the facts reported
were sufficiently numerous to generalise from.
MR. E. T. STURDY enquired whether any reports had been
made of luminous emanations from the bodies or heads of
certain persons in connection with the phenomena of the
Revival.
MR. FRYER answered that he had not met with any such
reports.
THE HON. EVERARD FEILDING asked whether he was right
in understanding that Mr. Fryer, in discussing the difference
between objective and subjective lights, meant to suggest that
if persons were born in a certain district where objective
lights caused by some unusual physical condition occurred
and then migrated to another district, their recollection of
these lights might induce in them subjective hallucinations
of lights ; and did Mr. Fryer think that this explanation
might apply to the case he had quoted of a doctor and his
wife who saw a light above the roof of a chapel where Mrs.
Jones was preaching ?
MR. FRYER replied in the affirmative to both these
questions.
JULY, 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 109
MR. FEILDING said he had recently been told by a friend
that in a particular district of the Highlands lights, apparently
of the same kind as those reported in Wales, were not infre
quently seen by peasants, who regarded them as in some way
forewarnings of death. His informant had seen them twice
himself, and on one occasion a light corresponding closely
with those mentioned in connection with Mrs. Jones of
Egryn had preceded his mother when driving in a carriage.
In one case a peasant stated that he had seen a light enter
his house and settle on a table. The lights generally occurred
on damp autumn evenings, a fact which suggested that there
was some physical cause for them. He thought it very
desirable that a geologist or other scientific expert should
examine the part of the coast where the Welsh lights had
been seen, in order if possible to ascertain what, if any, was
their physical basis. That there must be a physical basis
for at least some of them seems clear from the fact to which
Mr. Fryer had referred that Pennant, in his Tour in Wales
over two hundred years ago, speaks of lights of unexplained
origin being common along this part of the coast.
PROFESSOR BARRETT concurred in thinking that the phenomena
of the lights deserved more attention than they had received
from scientific men. He pointed out the antiquity of refer
ences to such phenomena, which were to be found e.g. in the
works of St. Augustine. The tradition of the nimbus might
also have taken its rise from appearances of a somewhat
similar nature. The Welsh Revival showed many features
in common with other revivals in the past, e.g. those initiated
by the early Quakers and by the Wesleys ; in all these cases
there was possibly a telepathic element at work in the exten
sion of impressions from one person or group of persons to
others.
THE MEDIUMSHIP OF MR C. BAILEY.
(Continued from the May Journal, p. 88.)
IN the Journal for May last, an account was given of sittings
held by Dr. MacCarthy with Mr. Bailey at Sydney. We
now give some further reports of other sittings by one of
our Australian members, Mr. A. W. Dobbie, of Gawler Place,
110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOLT, 1906.
Adelaide, South Australia, with extracts from some of Mr.
Debbie's letters on the subject.
Mr. Dobbie writes :
ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, December I9ih, 1903.
. . . Mr. Bailey is a man of very ordinary capacity and plain educa
tion who earns his living by keeping a small laundry in conjunction
with his wife in No. 8 Murphy Street, South Yarra (a suburb of Mel
bourne), Victoria. A very wealthy gentleman, a Mr. Stanford, who
has an office at the corner of Bourke and Russell Streets, Melbourne,
has taken him in hand during the past twelve or eighteen months, and
has had spiritualistic stances with Mr. Bailey twice a week under
supposed test conditions. Mr. Stanford, as a favour, allows friends
and visitors in whom he has confidence to attend. He very kindly
first showed me a great number (about 100) different apports or
articles which professedly had been dematerialised and brought
through space, . . . and gave me a free invitation to attend the
stances any time I happened to be in Melbourne at the time. I
attended two or three; but the searching was not done at the
stances I attended. Mr. Stanford said that he had done so
about seventy times, and considered it was unnecessary to do so
any more. A number of ladies and gentlemen in Adelaide paid
down 10/- each and got Mr. Bailey to come to Adelaide and
give us a few stances. They were held in a private house of a
gentleman who was prepared to swallow everything that came
along, so we who desired test conditions were not able to get
them. The sittings were held ; but did not give general satisfaction.
The control professed to take a fancy to me, and made some
complimentary remarks, and referred to my "magnetism being an
acquisition to any circle," etc. On the strength of those remarks
I ventured to ask the control to allow me to test him. I
remarked that it was possible for the Hindustani writing which
he produced in the dark to be open to the objection of the
possibility of the writing having been done previous to the sitting,
and then asked him to write something at my dictation in Hindu
stani. He replied by saying that at the next seance he would
write at my dictation in any language I liked. I thought this
was a large order, and had my doubts. At the next stance he
said : " I promised to write something at your dictation, but at
the next stance I will write something at your dictation in three
languages—Sanscrit, Persian, and Hindustani." I felt disappointed
and suspicious, but had to submit. Before the date arranged for
JULY. 1905. The Mediumakip of Mr. C. Bailey. Ill
the next seance he returned to Melbourne, so that was another
disappointment.
A few weeks afterwards I visited Melbourne and called at his
house to claim a private sitting which he voluntarily offered me
when he was in Adelaide but went away without doing so. I
found him in bed not well, so had to postpone it again. At a
subsequent visit I obtained the long-promised sitting, and will now
give you the results. When he became controlled he said, "I
promised to write you something in Hindustani, but I will do so
in Nepauli, which is a better test." I ventured to remind him
that he originally volunteered to write for me in any language,
and then in three languages—Persian, Sanscrit, and Hindustani,
but now he had come down to one. However, I wrote a
sentence and handed it to him, and he immediately started
scribbling on the paper (this was in broad daylight in a splendidly
lighted room, at three o'clock), and handed it to me. I then
told him that I originally wanted him to write in Hindustani,
and that my friend who was going to translate the sentence for
me might not know Nepauli; so I asked him to write me a
sentence in Hindustani. He hesitated, and then said, "Well, let
it be short." I at once wrote a short sentence and handed it
to him. He then professed to write it in Hindustani Urdu, and
gave it to me. On my return to Adelaide I took it to my
friend Mr. Garthwaite, a retired Indian Civil Service officer, who
for twenty-five years had been chief school inspector in India,
and was conversant with about twenty-five dialects of India, but
not Nepauli. He assured me that the writing was not Hindustani
Urdu. I then sent the writing to the British Resident in
Nepaul, India, and asked him to translate the sentences for me.
He returned them, telling me that in both cases they were
"meaningless scribble," and were neither Nepauli or Hindustani
Urdu. So much for the test experiment up to that point. I
sent Mr. Stanford the British Resident's letter, and also told him
that Mr. Garthwaite said the same thing. Mr. Stanford was much
surprised, and wrote saying that he could not understand it, but
that possibly there was some explanation for it. About three
months afterwards he sent me a professed translation by an educated
Hindoo, who was in Melbourne. However, that only made matters
worse, because the translation made my sentence to be an altogether
different thing to what I wrote ; so the experiment was a complete
failure from beginning to end. . . .
112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULT, 1905.
Januai-y 20th, 1904.
. . . Since last writing ... I have succeeded in engaging the same
medium (Mr. Bailey) to come to Adelaide to give us five sittings
under the same stringent conditions [as at Sydney], except that
he would not strip naked, because doing so in Sydney gave him
a severe cold and laid him up for a week or more.
He arrived in Adelaide the week before last, a day behind his
contract time, and in a very jaded condition on account of the
worry of selling up his furniture, etc. The result was that the
sittings were not nearly so successful as those in Sydney and
Melbourne. I send you two photographs illustrating the cage in
which we placed the medium after he had been carefully searched
by a doctor and another equally intelligent gentleman in my
presence and also that of other members of the committee appointed
to conduct the proceedings. After searching, we placed him in
the bag and carefully sealed the strings, and placed him in the
cage as you see him in the photograph. The sitters, including
the committee and searchers, were also searched. Under those conditions
a live bird (but we only saw the small head), some ancient coins,
a small peepul tree (grown in a pot with earth from my garden
previously put in the cage) supposed to be grown from a seed
transmitted from India during the sitting, all appeared inside the
cage. Also a bird's nest with one egg. . . .
The report of these sittings was written by a member of
the committee, Mr. J. W. Gellert. At the first sitting, held
on the day Mr. Bailey arrived at Adelaide, the medium, after
being searched by two medical men, was put into a bag as
at Sydney, and then inside a cage covered with mosquito
netting. No apports were produced.
Mr. Gellert's report of the second and third sittings is as
follows :
Second Stance, 13th January, 1904,
AT SELBORNE CHAMBERS, PERU STREET.
The meeting was held in another suite of chambers in same
building. There were about 40 persons present.
Drs. Cleland and Rogers did the searching of the gentlemen.
The examinations by former gentleman were said by some whom
he searched to be most perfunctory. He took their word for what
they had about their persons.
JULY, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. 0. Bailey. 113
A message had come through the medium during the day, while
he was being photographed in the cage by Mr. Dobbie, from one of
his controls expressing objections to Dr. Ramsay Smith as a searcher
of the medium. It appears that after first stance Dr. Smith
had expressed to some others his opinion of the need for stricter
bodily search, and this may have reached ears of medium. Also,
in his search of medium at first stance, he had opened front of
pants and under-pants and made some examination of lower trunk.
He was also more critical in his search work than was his colleague
(though in opinion of writer he was not a whit more particular
than it was his duty to be). The control said also that the
medium's skin was not to be subjected to scrutiny—that is, his
covered parts. He was accordingly searched by Dr. Rogers. He
was divested of coat and vest, and the examination was made by
passing the hands over the clothing covering body and limbs and
taking off his boots, which were examined by Dr. Frank Magarey.
The boots were restored, but coat, vest, and waterproof overcoat
were left in search room, as was his hat. The searchers then
conducted him to the locked stance room and put him in the bag,
tied and sealed him at wrists and neck, and placed him in the
cabinet, which was secured as at the first stance.
The sitters who had then been detained in the search rooms
were introduced to stance room, whose door was locked by catch-
lock, against which writer sat.
After a few minutes' discoursing by a control the lights were put
out at control Abdul's desire. The company joined hands at his
wish, and now and again sang—also at his wish. The singing not
being hearty enough, another control [came] who said he was used to
conducting singing and "led" the hymn. At its conclusion Abdul
again took control, and said something would be brought. Selim
had gone for it, he said, and would soon be back. The power was
not very great, but they would do something. By and by a
noise as of something falling was heard in the cabinet, and control
announced that ancient money from the mounds had been brought,
which he later informed us was of the reign of Ptolemy, and more
than 2000 years in age (I cannot recollect the exact date; he said
from to such and such a date, not knowing exactly himself).
He said ten coins had come, but that only three would be left, as
the mound, by continued drawings on his part on various occa
sions, was being depleted of these treasures. He had taken away
hundreds.
114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.
Later he brought a bird from India, and on a light being struck
showed something held in the hollow formed by his joined palms
which was said to be a bird, though no one to whom I spoke could
see its shape. Only the tip of its head was allowed to peep out,
and I could not distinguish even that. It might have been any
thing or nothing. A cage should have been provided, he said, and
it would have been put in. He asked that one should be procured
for following stances. The bird and seven coins were seen no more.
Of the remaining coins, one was found partly under the outer edge
of cabinet frame, which was of sufficient distance from floor to allow
of a coin being passed under.
For next stance he asked for a cage and pot filled with earth.
It was also desired by control (one of the " doctor men ") that
as soon as he came to himself he should be given his vest, coat,
and overcoat, as he was likely to catch cold and liable to shivers.
This was done, but no search was made of his clothes or person to
ascertain what had become of vanished coins and bird ('!).
The conditions were not of sufficient stringency or conducted
methodically enough or with required attention to detail to be of
any evidential value to the body of scientific opinion.
3rd Stance, 14 Jan., 1904.
Mr. C. L. Whitham acted as searcher with Dr. F. Magarey. His
coat and vest were doffed and placed in a strong room in seance-
room ; they carefully examined him ; took off boots and socks
and felt carefully clothing and person for anything which might be
concealed. After conducting him to seance-room he was tied and
sealed in a bag made of mosquito netting—his wife having com
plained that the unbleached calico bag formerly used was too hot
The mosquito bag being deemed a sufficient precaution for our
purposes it was used. The controls expressed satisfaction with it.
A decanter of water and tumbler, an empty canary cage, a pot
filled with earth from Mr. Bobbie's garden, and a black cloth from
Mr. Dobbie's camera outfit, and some sheets of ruled foolscap
writing paper with a pencil were placed on table in cabinet-cage.
Upon the medium's entrance the cage was locked down as formerly.
. . . Lights were extinguished after the preliminary talk of Dr.
Whitcombe (control) and Abdul (control) came.
A cotton-wool (or some similar substance) nest with a small
egg was brought, but no bird. The control stated it was nest from
which fledgeling brought on previous evening was obtained.
JOLT, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 115
He also planted a seed of some Indian sacred tree whose name
he did not seem certain of, but on repeated enquiry and suggestion
affirmed to be of pepul family. The light was up dimly and I could
see the edge of pot with top of plant just appearing over line of
pot's edge, at one stage ; later it had grown more, and still later—
not more than one hour altogether, I think—it was at least 2 inches
in height, with several leaves of i an inch in length.
A luminous amorphous mass about size of hand appeared (some
what the same as on previous sitting) to write a message from Alex.
Sutherland which was simply a "greeting." Mr. Dobbie has it.
A small silver coin was brought; the control, Abdul, attempted
to pronounce its name, but having some difficulty, accepted the
suggestion that it was a denarius of the time of Adrian or
Hadrian (?).
The next control was Nana Sahib, who inquired for Mr. Stanford
(of Melbourne). It was alleged by him that a memsahib friend of
Mr. Stanford's asked to see him. This control manifested much
antipathy to the "feringhi" audience, and named them "dogs."
After glaring round the medium fell into a sort of catalepsy on the
floor—his head resting against the mosquito netting side and partly
on frame of cabinet at such an angle as if any weight were there,
the netting must have torn at the tacking, and this did happen.
(This was after production of apports). Mr. Dobbie went forward
with the idea of supporting his head to prevent a breakage of the
netting, but was warned back by Dr. Ramsay Smith. After a short
wait the medium recovered himself (this all took place under a
slightly subdued light and everything was plainly visible) and Abdul
was again in control. After telling sitters not to be frightened, he
said Nana was not a good spirit and came because Mr. Stanford
wanted him. Dr. Whitcombe afterwards explained that the Hindoo
controls expelled him and (presumably—my assumption) this caused
the "fit."
A gum-fastened envelope addressed to Abdul containing a message
from some person was placed on mantelpiece outside cage, and he
(Whitcombe) was asked that it should be made to pass into cabinet
or that some object from houses or offices of some of sitters should
be brought ; but he said it was difficult, requiring space, and nothing
came of the request except that it might take place on following
night. . . .
Dr. Ramsay Smith expressed his opinion to me and others that
the whole affair of the fit was a sham. Had the seizure been a
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOLT, 1905.
genuine one, nothing would have kept his head (which was kept
bent) from straightening and going through netting of cabinet.
It was not epileptic nor hysterical nor apoplectic ; not patho
logical in short. Dr. F. Magarey supported that statement, that
it was none of these kinds of seizures, but thought it possible that
it might be of another order—in brief, that it was not a fit,
properly so-called, but some trance catalepsy which would be quite
possible admitting genuineness of phenomena produced.
Mr. Dobbie wrote later as follows :
February 3rd, 1904.
. . . The tree that was produced inside the mosquito-net cage
referred to in my last letter is still growing in my glass-house. Per
same post I send you a coin which came into my possession under
the following circumstances : Mr. C. Bailey came to my office the
morning after the last of the sittings with one of my fellow-committee-
men (Mr. Frost) to receive his payment for the sittings. During
the interview he suddenly became controlled by Abdul, one of his
controls, and in a bright, delighted kind of manner pointed to two
very interesting photographs I had taken during my visit to India
in 1893, saying: "That my country; you been there?" etc., then
a minute or two afterwards said, "You got the money." I said, "I
gave the medium the money a few minutes ago." "No, no; I no
mean that money, I mean your money." Mr. Frost, like myself not
understanding what had happened, said to the control : " Mr. Dobbie
gave the medium the money, eight sovereigns, just now." Abdul
replied : "I no mean that, Selim [another control] he fetch coin
from Egypt for Mr. Dobbie just now ; you look on floor, it fall
down." We then searched the floor, and finally found a large copper
coin behind my chair on the farther side from the medium. He
then informed us that it was a coin of the third Ptolemy. ... I
may mention that the bird's nest and egg, and also the live bird
and most of the coins were taken back to where they came from
during the sittings. All we have left are three coins and the
growing tree. He said the bird could not live here, and the Hindoos
do not take life even when in the egg, so they were taken back
again at once. . . .
ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, February 25th, 1904.
Referring to the sittings with Mr. C. Bailey ... I have now to
report a fresh development. At one of the sittings he requested me
JOLT, 1905. The Mediumship of Mr. C. Bailey. 117
to provide a flower-pot filled with earth for the following evening.
In the morning I told him that the subscribers would prefer the
time being used for the production of apports from distant places
rather than spending time on anything that, like tree-growing,
was known to be a common juggler's trick in India and elsewhere.
He replied that it was for the "control" to decide that, he himself
had "nothing to do with what took place." I therefore provided
the pot with earth, and placed it in the cage with him in the
evening. The result was that he (the control) provided or produced
what he said was a species of peepul tree of India, and instructed
me to keep it in perfect darkness for two days. Before the forty-
eight hours were up the medium was on the sea on his way to
Italy. Ever since that time I have carefully nursed the plant in
my glass-house, and also under a propagating glass. It made a
very slight growth, and several persons (not experts) made the
remark that it "looks like a young olive tree." I, not thinking
the medium would be so mad as to attempt such a transparent
fraud, did not suspect it being simply a cutting; but as it has
lately been gradually curling its leaves, I was afraid that my glass
house was not a suitable place for it, so yesterday morning took it
to my friend Mr. Holtze, the Director of the Adelaide Botanic
Gardens, to request him to place it in his tropical plant-house. I
told him that it was supposed to be a species of Indian peepul
tree. He at once said, "I can positively assure you, Mr. Bobbie,
that it is not a peepul tree. I believe it is simply a cutting of an
olive tree, and I do not believe it has any root." I at once said,
"Then let us take it up at once and examine it." He then took
it up carefully, and sure enough it was only a cutting devoid of
root. I may inform you that there are hundreds of olive trees
about Adelaide growing in the City Public Parks, so Mr. Bailey
would not have the slightest difficulty in getting any amount of
cuttings. To all appearance he must have taken a cutting from one
of the trees in the City Parks or Squares and hid it in his hair.
I cannot remember his hair being searched, perhaps it was, but
the fact remains that the supposed peepul tree is simply an olive
cutting. . . .
Mr. Dobbie enclosed with this letter a copy of a printed
note describing this incident, circulated to the sitters who
took part in these stances by the Committee, dated February
29th, 1904, and signed by Messrs. F. R. C. Frost, E. S.
118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.
Eogers, M.D., J. W. Gellert, and A. W. Dobbie. In a letter
dated April 13th, 1904, he observes:
We paid Mr. Bailey for postages so that he might write to ns
every month during his trip [to Europe], but he has not written a
line to any of us. It is simply another proof of the utter un
reliability of Bailey as a man judged from the ordinary standard.
Besides the coins referred to in these letters, which Mr.
Dobbie sent us to be examined by experts, and which (as
stated in the Journal for March, p. 46) were pronounced by
the British Museum authorities to be genuine, but quite
common and valueless, we received from him two photographs,
one ordinary and one stereoscopic one, showing Mr. Bailey
enveloped in the bag and sitting inside the cage covered
with mosquito netting. If these photographs represent, as
apparently they do, the exact arrangement in force at the
sittings, they support the hypothesis suggested in the May
Journal that objects concealed on Mr. Bailey's person or in
his clothes were in the dark passed out through the neck of
the bag ; for this is drawn up in such a way as to show part
of his coat-collar and in one case part of the white linen
collar beneath, so that he would only have had to shift it a
little higher up on his neck to allow plenty of play and
space. The report also shows that, as in the Italian sittings
described by M. de Vesme in the Annals of Psychical Science
for April, Mr. Bailey objected to being adequately searched.
CASES.
THE two following cases are instances of what Mr. Myers, in
developing a suggestion of Mr. Gurney's, called " veridical after
images," that is, visions that suggest "the survival of a mere
image ... of past events or emotions with no active counter
part in the present " ;—" a kind of local imprint left by past
events, and perceptible at times to persons endowed with
some special form of sensitiveness." Cases of this kind are
generally associated with deceased persons, and in regard to
these Mr. Myers writes :
" We are, indeed, always uncertain as to the degree of
the deceased person's active participation in post-mortem
JULY, 1905. Cases. 119
phantasms,—as to the relation of such manifestations to the
central current of his continuing individuality. But it is
in dealing with these persistent pictures of a bygone earth-
scene that this perplexity reaches its climax. They may, as
I have already said, be the mere dreams of the dead ;—affording
no true indication of the point which the deceased person's
knowledge or emotion has really reached." (Human Personality,
Vol. II., p. 384; see also pp. 4 and 360.)
Of the two cases printed below, the first conforms to the
usual type in appearing to represent a dead person ; the second
is interesting in representing a recent event, the actor in
. which was still presumably living.
G. 278. Apparition.
This case was sent to us by a member of the Society,
Mrs. C. C. Baker, the account having been written by a
friend of hers, Miss Bedford, and enclosed in a letter from
Mrs. Baker, dated April 25th, 1905. Miss Bedford writes:
On the 18th of November, 1904, I was bicycling from a village
a mile or two from my home, by a lane which follows the
windings of a river. A steep bank, lightly wooded, divides the
road from the river, and at intervals along the top where the bushes
are sparse there are bits of rail painted white. It was broad
daylight; it could not have been later than 3.30, but there was
a light silvery fog. As I came round a corner, I saw a little distance
ahead of me a man sitting on the rail in a very dejected attitude ;
he seemed to have no hat on and to be looking down at the water.
I was not near enough to distinguish his features, my sight not
being very good. I had a misgiving he might be a starving tramp,
as it was so cold nobody would sit on a rail for pleasure, and fearing he
might stop me, I looked round to see whether some men who were
mending the road some way back were still in sight. They were
not, and when I turned my head again the man had vanished. I
had come quite close to the place, and the bushes being leafless I
could see all down the bank to the water, and he was nowhere
to be seen. Had he been in the lane I must have overtaken him;
had he crossed I must have seen him, as the bank going up to the
field the other side is too steep for him to have climbed while my
head was turned. I then remembered having been told of a ghost
who had been seen at a spot in another lane about half a mile off,
on the other side of the main high road, but still following the
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1905.
same river, and I said to myself, " I really should have thought
this was the ghost B. L. talks of, only it is the wrong place." I
was not the least frightened, though I had been dreadfully afraid
to pass the other place in the dusk when I had just been told of
it, and had crossed myself and prayed for his release that I might
not see it. I only knew that it was a man who had drowned himself
about forty years before. Just beyond where I saw him, round
the next bend, stands a little farm and a slope goes down to
the water.
Some ten days later I sat next Miss L. at a luncheon party,
and said to her, " I think I must have seen the ghost you talked of
the other day ; only it was in I Lane, not W Lane." She
exclaimed, " Where ? Tell me exactly where." " Sitting on the
white rail where the lane bends round." " Why ! " she cried,
" that is the place where he did it." " But you told me W
Lane," I said. "Yes, because that is the only place I ever heard
of his being seen. He was attached to a nursery governess of ours
who jilted him; he used to wait for her and walk with her there,
and not long after his suicide my mother saw him there ; but he
lived at T Farm, in I Lane, and he threw himself into the
river near his home." I was a good deal impressed with this.
Early in January I was visiting the same old couple from whom
I had been returning when I saw the man, and they chanced to
mention thay had lived in the same cottage over fifty years, so I
asked, did they remember a young farmer who put an end to
himself in that lane some forty years ago. "Oh yes," they said,
" that would be Sammy D ; he throwed hisself into the water
alongside the farm where he lived just where the cattle goes
down to watering." Then the old woman took up the word ;
" Crossed in love Sammy was : he was courtin' one o' the maids
up to S (Miss L.'s old home) and she wouldn't have him; so
he come in one day and throwed his hat down on to the kitchen
table and went out and drowned hisself."
The one detail I had observed was that the man had no hat on.
I then told them what I had seen, but they had never seen him
nor knew any who had ; neither have I since, though I have passed
both places often.
(Signed) JESSIE BEDFORD.
The " Miss L." of the above narrative writes :
The gate in W Lane where my mother (I believe several times)
JOLT, 1905. Cases. 121
saw him was the spot where he was finally refused by A. W.
and from which he went direct and drowned himself.
ALBINIA LOCKE.
In reply to questions, Miss Bedford writes to us :
RED HOUSE, SOUTHBOURNE, HANTS, May 5 [1905].
Mrs. Baker sent your letter on to me here . . . and I sent it to
Miss Locke. She says that my account of what passed between
us on both occasions on the subject of D 's ghost tallies exactly
with her recollection. . . . Mrs. Locke has been dead some years.
. . . My head was only turned for a matter of seconds, as I did
not dismount, and was riding quickly. When I saw he was gone
I rode very slowly past the place so as to look and see if he
was anywhere below. I went along that lane in the same direction
some ten days later in order to ascertain that there was no tree,
stump or bush that might at a certain distance take the semblance
of a man, and made quite sure there was nothing.
JESSIE BEDFORD.
Miss Locke says she does not know any further details.
In answer to a question whether Miss Locke's corroboration
referred to the written account sent to us, Miss Bedford wrote
on May 10th, 1905: "Miss Locke saw the account sent to
you through Mrs. Baker before it went and said it was
accurate."
L. 1148. Collective Apparition.
This case was sent to us by Miss Vaughan, who writes as
follows :
EDMUNDBYERS RECTORY, SHOTLEY BRIDGE,
Co. DURHAM, May 15th [1905].
. . . Last evening, after service, a lady who is staying with us
and I walked part way home with a friend who lives at Ruffside
Hall, about two miles from Edmundbyers. It was very misty.
On our way back along the moorland road two cyclists passed
us. Further on, at a point where there is a steep bank up to
the right and a sloping bank and wall on the left, I saw what
I thought was another cyclist coming towards us. At the same
instant my friend said, " Here's another cyclist, keep to this side."
We saw indistinctly what seemed to be a man bending slightly
forward on his machine, and the movement of the wheels was
122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOLT, 1906.
apparent to both of us. Suddenly he vanished, and my companion
said, " Whatever is the man doing ? He must be riding in the
ditch I " I laughed and said, " I think he has tumbled off." To
our astonishment there was no man or machine to be found, and
it was impossibk for him to have got off the road. Much per
plexed, we walked on about a hundred yards, and meeting a
young man from the village, we asked whether a cyclist had
passed him. He said, no, and there was no road along which the
cyclist could have turned from the high road. On reaching home,
we asked my father for an explanation of what we had seen,
and he could not give one. Later in the evening we were told
by one of the maids that on the previous Saturday evening, at about
the same time, nine o'clock, a man was found unconscious on the
road by the village blacksmith, having fallen from his cycle when
drunk. The spot where the accident occurred is the point where
we saw the appearance. . . .
MILDRED VAUGHAN.
lu reply to questions, Miss Vaughan wrote later :
May 2Glk [1905].
. . . My friend was present when I wrote the account of the
apparition and says that she cannot give any more information as to
what we saw. I am sorry that we made one mistake in our
statement. We were wrongly informed as to the hour when the
blacksmith found the man. On enquiry he told us that the time
was 7.30. . . .
MILDRED VAUGHAN.
The following statement from the lady who shared Miss
Vaughan's experience was enclosed in the above letter :
In answer to your letter of the 18th inst. to Miss Vaughan:
I endorse everything in her account of what we saw, and do not
think I can give any more information on the point. . . .

TWO POLTERGEIST CASES.
I.
TOWARDS the end of August, 1904, somewhat sensational reports
appeared in several of the daily papers about a " haunted
house " at Upholland, near Wigan, in Lancashire, where
" Poltergeist " phenomena were said to be occurring in abund
ance. The house was tenanted by a widow named Mrs.
Winstanley with six children, the eldest son being a French
polisher by trade and the younger ones miners. The dis
turbances occurred in a bedroom occupied by three of the
sons, and seemed to be connected with a walled-up window
in the room which was close to their bed. From this
window and the adjoining parts of the wall of the room
pieces of paper were torn off and stones and mortar were
pulled out of the wall and scattered about the room. The
wall was repaired, but the same things happened again.
Early in September of the same year, Lieut.-Colonel Le
M. Taylor visited Upholland to investigate the case and his
report of it would have appeared sooner, but that it was hoped
to get further evidence from one of the principal witnesses.
He also made plans and drawings of different parts of the
house, and obtained photographs of it and of the " haunted "
window, which are not reproduced here, but may be seen in
our Rooms by members of the Society. Colonel Taylor writes :
December 20th, 1904.
I arrived at the village of Upholland at about 11 a.m. on
Friday, September 9th, 1904, and at once called on the Rev. G. F.
Wills, who told me that the affair at the Wiustanleys' had created
much stir in the neighbourhood. The Wiustanley family consists
of Mrs. W. and her six children, namely William, age about 27,
Thomas 24, Peter 17, Henry 14, and two little girls under 12
years of age.
Mr. Wills said that they were of good repute ; that Peter was
not so steady as his brothers ... , the others he thought very
trustworthy.
Mr. Wills kindly took me into the village and introduced me to
Mr. Baxter as a good witness. He dictated to me the statement
•OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 125
herewith, over his signature. We then went and found Mr.
•Chadwick, who is the local agent for the owner of the " haunted "
house; he agreed to come with me to the house in the evening. I
then saw Mrs. Winstanley herself, who received me very kindly
and offered no objection whatever to my making an investigation
in any way I liked. Peter was at home and he and his mother
showed me the room and told me their story about what had taken
place in it.
At 8 p.m. I returned and found Mr. Chadwick already in the
haunted room sitting on the bed. In a few minutes we were joined
by William and a Mr. John Corless, and one or two others. The
street lamp made the room very far from dark. We sat on the
bed in front of the newly plastered wall for about an hour, but as
nothing occurred all my companions, except Mr. Corless, went down
stairs and he and I went into the back room and sat at the door l
till 11 o'clock. During this time some other people came and went,
partly to see me, I suppose, but they came at once into the back
room and no one attempted to approach the " haunted " wall.
Nothing occult was observed and I returned to Wigan.
On Saturday I went over to Upholland at 11 a.m. and met
John Corless and John Winstanley (who is no relation of the
other people of that name) at Mr. Baxter's shop ; they dictated
their statements to me. At 8 p.m. I again went to Mrs.
Winstanley's and sat at the door of the back room till 11. I
had several visitors but no manifestations.
On Sunday I again returned and watched from 7.30 till 11;
again visitors, William, Peter, John Corless, Chadwick and others,
but no one attempted to approach the forbidden wall ; again no
occult manifestation. I was, as I anticipated, too late to get any
personal experience in the matter. On Monday I returned to
Cheltenham, after being promised three other statements and an
Assurance that Sergt. Radclitfe of the police would send me his
•when he returned from his holiday in about ten days.
From what I gathered in conversation during my visits to
Upholland the history of the affair seems to be that during the
last few days of July, knocks on the wall and bricked-up window
were heard, but that it was not till the night of Sunday, August
1st, that they became so insistent as to cause alarm. On this night
1 Colonel Taylor's plan of the house shows that the back room opens out
of the front ("haunted") room, so that a full view of the latter can be
obtained from the doorway of the former.
A 2
126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905:
not only were knocks heard but the wall-paper was torn and pieces
of mortar, etc., thrown about the room.
On Monday Mrs. Winstanley secured Mr. Baxter's assistance and
called in the police. For something over a fortnight the disturb
ances continued and every endeavour was made to trace the cause
of the phenomena without avail, many people taking part in the
investigation, aided in every way by the family. The agent, Mr.
Chadwick, was among the most energetic of the investigators, but
was so unfortunate that he did not witness anything which in his
opinion excluded human agency. He told me that he was in the
room when two pieces of mortar fell at his feet ; he is not able
to attribute this to the action of any one in the house, but
supposes the mortar to have been thrown in through the window
of the back room. This explanation is inadequate, for although the
ground rises behind the house and thus makes such a thing more
possible, the shape and size of the window in my opinion precludes
it. He had the floor of the room taken up, a hole made in the
chimney ; he examined the wall of Mrs. Feet's house next door, but
could find no marks which might indicate operations from that
side ; he placed pencil marks round the dilapidations to see when
pieces of mortar were newly carried away, and finally had the
window newly walled up, the window-sill removed and the whole
plastered over, making the wall good again. This was done on
August 19th, since which time the boys have ceased to sleep
in the room and the bed has been placed in its new position in
the room [i.e. further away from the window]. Since this date the
disturbances seem to have had a tendency gradually to diminish ;
no more knocks have been heard, or very few, and whereas at first
the phenomena recurred every night, now intervals of quiet were
interpolated, which have become more and more frequent. At the
date of my visit the last disturbance was noticed on the day before
I arrived; still a considerable quantity of mortar and stone has
been removed from the wall since the 19th September, also a new
place has been attacked.
At first members of the Winstanley [family] were naturally
suspected ; now the consensus of public opinion has completely
acquitted them.
I could detect no adequate motive on the part of any one;
indeed, the Winstanleys are much exercised about a demand on
[the] part of their landlord that they should make good the
damage.
OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 127
Popular superstition attributes the disturbance to the spirit of
a highwayman who was buried in the churchyard near the house
about a hundred years ago.
Frequent attempts have been made to detect intelligence, with
no result; but if the story of the piece of plaster having been
balanced on the knob of the bedstead is true, intelligence was
certainly present.
I judge that the witnesses in this case were not familiar with, at
least, the details of seance room manifestations ; still on two
occasions things were observed which correlate with these, and
similar to phenomena reported to have been observed during other
Poltergeist manifestations, namely :
Once when I was sitting just inside the door of the second room,
with the pieces of wood which had formerly constituted the sill of
the haunted window behind me against the wall, my two com
panions at the time—the schoolmaster and another—declared that
they saw a light flitting about in the neighbourhood of the boards ;
they saw it two or three times, as they said, quite plainly ; we
had not been speaking of "spirit lights" or anything of the sort,
our whole attention being directed towards the " haunted window "
in the next room which we were watching.
At another time one of the witnesses told me that he considered
that the stones he saw come out from the wall travelled more
slowly than they could have done if jerked or thrown out and he
perceived what looked like a faint light behind them. My
informant seemed to lay no stress on this, as if he had no theory
of their being removed by a "spirit hand" or anything of that sort.
I attach the statements of the various witnesses from whom I
was able to get written evidence. My long delay in making this
report is due to the fact that two other men * promised me state
ments, but though I have made several attempts to get them, I am
unable; it must therefore be presumed that they are not attainable.
Mrs. Winstanley herself has given no statement, but corroborates,
as far as she is concerned, what others informed me of.
She told me that on one occasion when she knew that no one
was in the house she was standing at the street door with one of
her sons when they heard a noise in the room above ; it was just
getting dark in the evening. They went up to the room at once
1 One of these was a Mr. Bibby, who is cited as one of the principal
witnesses in an illustrated article on "The Haunted House at Upholland,"
which appeared in The Wide World Maga-ine for February, 1905.
128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT.,
and found one or more of the stones on the floor; she believed
they were in their places when she left the house.
Again, one of the brothers, who has not made a statement in
writing, said to me, "Last Sunday week in the evening I was
standing outside with Mrs. Peet ; we heard what sounded like
the stones being thrown on the floor. My brother had just left
the house and was a little way down the street. When I heard the
sound I called him back and asked him if the stones were in the
wall when he left; he said yes. We all went up and found two of
the large stones and a third smaller one on the floor."
The last manifestations seem to have shifted their locality, for a
hole (about the size of an orange when I saw it) had been made
in the plaster of the wall opposite the haunted window and the
paper round it much torn only a day or two before my arrival.
I should have mentioned that William Winstanley, the eldest
brother, is lame, and a French polisher by trade, the other brothers
are miners. G. L. LE M. TAYLOR.
The statements dictated by the various witnesses to
Colonel Taylor, and afterwards corrected and signed by them,
were as follows :
From Mr Richard Baxter, member of the District Council :
September 9//i, 1904.
On Monday, August 1st, Mrs. Winstanley came to my shop and
told me that something very mysterious had been taking place in
her house which had frightened her and her family. She had
called in the policeman, who went into the room where the mys
terious things were happening, but nothing took place in his presence.
She asked me if I would go over to her house to-night and help
them. I said I would do so, but asked what was the matter.
She told me that they had heard knocks on the wall that they
could not account for, and that the plaster had been torn off the
wall and cast about in such a way that no human agency would
account for.
I went over to Mrs. Winstanley's at about 11 p.m. that evening,
and on going to the room where the disturbances were taking place
found the three boys, Henry, Peter, and Thomas, in bed together
(their ages about 14, 17, and 24 respectively). I went over to the bed
to examine the wall where the knocks had been heard and where the
plaster had been torn away. Another man, Mr. John Glover, stood
OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 129
at the foot of the bed the while. It was not so dark but that I
could plainly see the young men in bed, though there was no lamp
in the room. I heard a knocking which seemed to come from the
wall where the ancient window had been walled up. The man who
was standing at the foot of the bed became afraid and left the
room ; but just at this time the policeman, who had been called in
the night before, entered.
I could not understand the knockiugs, and of course suspected
that the young men in bed must have something to do with it, so
I said to the policeman, " This is very strange ; would it not be
better if we were to slip into the next room and watch at the
doorway?" We went and stood in the back room, looking in
through the door. I said, " You have your lamp ready."
In a few minutes we heard the knocking again, and the lamp
was at once flashed on the bed, by which we saw that the boys had
not seemingly moved. After a little a stone fell from the wall to
the floor ; again the lamp was flashed on the place, but we detected
no movement on [the] part of the boys. Now the sergeant of police
came up to us and went and stood near the bed, but the same sort
of thing went on, knocks being heard and pieces of the wall, mostly
plaster, came tumbling out, some df it not merely falling to the
ground, but seemed to be ejected from the wall into the room.
After investigating in this way for a considerable time without
being able to find out how the thing happened, we left for the night.
The next night I went again to the house. This time the young
men had not gone to bed, and I found Mr. John Winstanley wait
ing my arrival (this Mr. Winstanley is no relation to the people of
the same name living in the house).
Three of us went upstairs to investigate. I went first, and was
followed by John and Peter, who was carrying a lamp. As I came
to the door of the room I heard some knocks and something fall.
.When we got inside the room Peter put out his lamp, and seated
himself in a chair in the back room close to the door. I stood
leaning against the door-post, and John stood close behind me.
Soon a piece of mortar flew from somewhere and fell at Peter's
feet. We lit the lamp to see where it could have come from, but
could only conjecture that it must have come from the walled-up
window, as only there was there a "raw" place in the wall. At
this Peter got frightened and returned downstairs. John and I
remained, and a piece or two of mortar again fell on the floor. We
lighted up and found them.
130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.
On Monday I attended the Local Board. One of the members,
Mr. , was much interested in what I told them I had seen at
Mrs. Winstanley's, and came with me the following night to
investigate.
This time the boys were in bed as I had found them on Monday.
We had not been long in the room before bits of mortar and stone
came away from the wall. I was very keen to discover the boys
playing tricks, but could detect nothing.
A hat-box was standing on a wooden board in the window. Sud
denly the hat-box flew out into the room over the bed. But before
this took place there was some loud knocking. I watched the boys,
and am sure they did not do it. They were evidently much afraid.
I picked up the stones which had come out of the wall and replaced
them. They had come from that part close under the board, and
were of considerable size, from 2x3x2 [ins.] to 10 x 6 x 2| [ins.],
or about that. I fixed the stones back in their places as securely as
I could, but they were again taken out, and fell on the floor with
much noise. The hat-box also was replaced and a stone put on top
of it. These soon came away and fell on the floor. On a subse
quent occasion, when the boys were in bed and I was standing at
the door of the back room, these stones were again detached from
the wall. I had the boys under observation, and they did not
move at the time.
Mr. Grimshaw of Tontine said he would like to see what was
going on, so he went with me on Friday night, and with us were
two others. Of the four one of us stood in the room about three
feet from the bed, and the rest at the door. We remained about
an hour. The boys were in bed, but I was watching them closely.
Knocks were heard on the wall in the usual way, and a sort of
sound as if sand or shot were being poured on the floor, after which
a stone would come out and fall. Mr. Grimshaw thought that the
knocks were intended as signals in the telegraphic code, and meant
his initials. I changed places with him, and when subsequent knocks
were heard he said they indicated mine. We also heard knocks on
the floor.
Much more of this sort of thing took place than I have related.
For example, on one occasion I placed the hat-box on a stone on
the wooden board. The stone was 5x8x2 [ins.], and in the box
another stone. They were all thrown into the room.
Again, I marked a piece of plaster and placed it in the corner of
the window. This was thrown out into the room.

I have known stones and mortar fly from the wall more than 30
or 40 times and have never seen any indication of trickery, nor
.have I heard [of] any one who has seen anything of this character.

From Mr. John Corless :
September \0th [1904].
I heard of these disturbances about 4 weeks ago, and went to
•examine them with Mr. Baxter. We went up to the room at 10.30
p.m. with a Mr. Richard Clayton ; the Winstanleys were downstairs.
We sat in the door of the back room and watched. After being
there for about 10 minutes a piece of plaster fell at my foot (we
had no light). After a little we heard the sound of tearing paper
and other sounds, indicating the removal of plaster from the wall,
and a piece came out and lit in the middle of the room. We
•watched about 45 minutes, and I saw a dim light which moved
about thus twice. We now went into the room and sat against the
wooden partition facing the walled-up window. We remained there
for about half-an hour, when " it throwed," and a piece of plaster
about 2x1 xli [ins.] hit my foot, and I put it to my cheek and
brow to see if it was warm or cold. After this the boys came up
and went to bed about 12.10, and we went into the back room
and looked through the door. After about 15 minutes 3 knocks came,
and then I heard a stone come out of the window. Then there
were twice three knocks, then three given slowly, then eight given
very quickly. Then another stone came out. After this the hat-box
-came out (band-box), and also stones from under the wooden shelf.
After this I went away.
The next time I went to see the thing was three weeks come
Tuesday. It was the day after they had filled up the recess of the
window and plastered it over. About 8.10 p.m. I went into the
room and examined the new work and the wall near it. I then
went down to Mrs. Winstanley in the kitchen. We were the only
two people in the house. We heard something fall in the room
above, and she said, "Take the lamp and go and see what it is."
I did so, and found that a piece of plaster had been torn from the
wall on the front wall of the house close to the right of the new
plaster work. It was 4x9 inches, and was on the floor about three
feet from the wall. I knew where it came from by seeing the new
defaced place in the wall, a defacement which was not there when
I examined the wall at 8.10.
132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.
I went down again, and at a quarter to nine the two boys, Peter
and Thomas, came in. Again we heard something fall, and again we
(Thomas and I) went up to look. A new piece of plaster had been
thrown across the room. We found it near the door, it was a
corner piece, and I was able to fit it into the place it had come
from. Thomas and I went and examined the upper rooms.
Again I went to the house just a week ago, and while below we
heard a stone come out. I went up to examine by myself. I found
the stone on the floor and some plaster. I examined the stone and
the wall for tool-marks, as I could not think that the thing could
be done without some instrument, but I found no marks.
Again last Sunday night I was up there. I was standing with
Mrs. Winstanley in the street in front of the house when she said
she heard a noise. I went up and found one of the stones on the
floor. Since then, one night at about 8.45, Peter and I were standing
at the house door, when we heard the usual noise. We went up
into the room and found a piece of mortar balanced on one of the
brass knobs of the bedstead. It was about 5x3 [ins.], and also
a piece 12x6 [ins.] lying on the bed. \\ e went back to the door,
and in a little Peter went into the house ; but I followed him at
once. He was getting himself a drink of water in the kitchen. He
said, "Did you hear that?" On which we went upstairs again and
found a triangle of mortar 5 inches each way on the floor near the
door. I am sure it was not .there when I left the room ten minutes
before, and no one was in the house.
On Wednesday I saw a light like a spark, about 9.45. Again on
Thursday last Mrs. W., Peter and I were in front of the house, and
no one was inside. We heard the window of the " Ghost " room
shake. Peter said, "There must be something up.' I went to the
room holding a lighted match, and found two pieces of mortar on
the stairs, and a piece on the knob of the bed 15x7 [ins.]. One
of the pieces found on the stairs fitted a part of the new hole which
had, within the last few days, been made in the wall opposite the
walled-up window.

From Mr. John Winstanley :
September lOih [1904].
On the third night of the disturbances I went with Mr. E. Baxter
to the house about 10 p.m. No sooner had we got into the back
OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 133
room and Peter, who followed me, had sat down by the door than
a piece of mortar dropped at his feet. He seemed frightened and
went downstairs and got a lamp. He returned with it and sat
down again. I put the lamp out, and at once "it threw again," and
Peter went away, being frightened. We remained for half-an-hour,
and I heard the paper on the wall tearing. Then Thomas and
Peter and Henry all came up and got into bed. Peter nearest the
wall, then Henry, and outside Thomas. Three knocks came on
the plaster and three on the board, then a sound as of falling sand
or gravel on the floor. Then the large stone under the board
came out and fell. (During the evening 6 or 8 stones came
out which measured from 4x4 to 10x10, and about 2 or 2i
inches thick). I got the lamp from the back room and we
examined the wall.
I am sure the Winstanleys had nothing to do with it, and had
no means of getting hold of these stones from the outside.
We replaced the stones, put out the light, and went back to the
door of the back room. The knocks recommenced and out came the
stones again. Again we got a light and examined.
I have seen it by myself when no one was in the room. I have
heard a bit of mortar fall, found it to be an angle piece, and fitted
it back into its place in the wall.
Last Sunday I was with Mrs. Winstanley in the kitchen, and we
heard the noise. Mrs. W. went out of the house to see if she
could find one of her boys. I was left sitting in the rocking chair
when "it threw" a second time. By ear I judged that a piece of
mortar had been thrown across the room, and I heard the tearing
of the paper as it was detached from the wall. I went to the back
door and called Mrs. Peet, who lives next door, who had wanted to
see something of it. She came in, and "it again threw."
Mrs. W. now returned with Peter, and we went upstairs and
found several pieces of mortar on the floor, and much paper torn
off the walls, and mortar gone from a new place.
After this some other men came in and said they would stay,
but would not remain upstairs when the light was taken away. As
they went out a piece of plaster was thrown down the stairs on to-
the fourth step.

The following is a copy of the Police report of the case :
POLICE STATION, UPHOLLAND, 1th October, 1901.
From P. S. 1270 Katcliffe at Upholland.
To Mr. Superintendent O'Hara at Wigan.
EC ALLEGED UPHOLLAND GHOST.
About 12 night on 8th August last, I was passing the house of
Mrs. Winstanley, a widow, in Church Street, Upholland, which was
afterwards described [as] the Ghost House. There was then a
crowd of people in the street in front of the house ; on enquiry of
the cause I ascertained that a strange knocking had been heard in
one of the front bedrooms of the house, and could be heard in the
street ; I stayed in front of the house for some time when I heard
3 distinct knocks, which appeared to be in the wall.
About 11.30 p.m. 10th August, I was in front of the house again
when Mrs. Winstanley came to me and asked if I would try and
find out what was causing the knocking on the bedroom wall, and
making the stones and paper fly from the walls. There was a bed
in the room which was about i a yard from the wall ; when I
entered the room 3 of the sons got into bed ; one of them named
Peter needed some persuasion as he was on the wall side and
seemed to be very much upset and frightened, and I had to
promise him that I would stay in the room before he would get
in the bed.
Thinking that Peter was responsible for the damage to the
wall, I closed 2 doors that lead into the room, and turned the
lamp out, and after being very quiet for about 15 minutes there
were 3 loud knocks in the wall, and immediately after there was a
crash on the room floor; I put on a light and found that 7
stones, which would be from 1 Ib. to 4 Ibs., lying on the bedroom
floor which appeared to have slurred out of the wall. I put the
stones back in the wall again and turned the room in darkness,
and after being very quiet the knock came again as before, and the
same stones fell on the floor again. During the time of this
process, I was stood with the bed between me and the wall where
the damage was being done, and with the room being very dark, I
reached a stick across the 3 lads' bodies while they were laid in
bed and kept it there till the stone fell out again ; it was impos
sible for them to knock on the wall, or remove the stones without,
me feeling them move.
OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 135
I put the stones back in the wall again and tried it a third
time ; this time I was stood about 1 yard from the wall, and after
the usual knocking the stones fell on the room floor again ; this
time I stood with a box of matches in my hand to make a light
quick, and before the sound went away I had a light on the 3
lads in bed and found they all had their hands under the bed
clothes in bed.
The stones in the wall had come out of the wall previous to me
going inside, as I found them all loose when I went in the room.
Almost every night between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. from the 10th
to the 19th August, I frequently heard the knocking and stones
falling on the room floor when I was in the street.
On the 23d August the stones were set in mortar and cement.
About 9.30 p.m. on the 27th August, Mrs. Winstanley again
asked me to go and see the bedroom. I went in and saw that a
stone about 7 Ibs. weight was lying on the room floor, and it appeared
to have been forced through the mortar.
The mortar was hanging loose about 1 inch all round the hole
•\vhere the stone had come out. There were no marks of any
description about the hole in the wall, which I think there would
.have been if it had been tampered with inside the room.

In a letter addressed to Colonel Taylor on September 5th,
1904, before his visit to Upholland, William Winstanley, the
eldest son, refers to the suspicion which he believed to be
entertained by the Vicar, Mr. Wills, that the phenomena were
due to trickery on the part of some member of the house
hold, but he says, " I am positive that he is mistaken." He
also says, " I shall be very pleased indeed if you can do
anything at all to elucidate the mystery."
The following account was written by William Winstanley,
apparently during September, 1904:
The first night I heard the noises was on Sunday, August
7th, 1904, shortly after midnight. The first thiug that occurred
was 3 distinct knocks at intervals of a minute or two. (A) I went
to the wall, knocked back and asked, " Who is there 1 what is
wanted? etc.," but got no answer. Then I asked, "If you have
any intelligence, knock as many knocks as I do." I gave 7 raps,
but got no answer. So I walked away. AVhen about a yard from
136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.
the wall, a number of stones were thrown from the wall ou to the
floor. On the same night, as soon as I left raj- own bed in the
next bedroom, the first thing that caught my eye on entering
the room, where the noise proceeded from, was an old English
History (which had formerly been in the recess) lying on the floor
behind the door at the other side of the room. On another
occasion, (B) while talking to the police officers, with my head
through the bedroom window, I was hit with a lump of plaster on
the right shoulder, which was on the opposite side of the room to
where the plaster was thrown from. The same night I (c) was
also hit in the back with a lump, but they never hurt. On
another occasion I saw stones lying between my brothers' heads
as they lay in bed, and their heads covered with plaster. I have
also seen pieces of plaster balanced on the bedstead post. Very
few nights pass without 2 or 3 pieces of stone or plaster being
thrown into my bedroom. I have also seen pieces that have been
thrown nearly to the bottom of the stairs. One night, (D) after
every one was in bed except myself, I went to examine the wall.
After leaving it, and before I got out of the room, a piece of
plaster flew past me, and it seemed to have a kind of lightning
flash following behind it. (E) Before the wall was built up, I took
special care to remove every particle of loose plaster, stone, etc.,
from the part that had not been disturbed, but before ten minutes
had passed another layer, consisting of three or four stones, that
were at first fast, had been removed. I have seen the stones,
plaster and books thrown to the floor many times.
This is a short sketch of my experience at 8 Church Street,
Upholland. W. WIXSTANLEY.
The following were questions addressed by Colonel Taylor
to W. Winstanley, and the latter's answers, referring to points
marked with the corresponding letters in the narrative just given :
(A) Your brothers were in bed near the wall on this occasion 1
Yes ; they were all in bed.
(B) Who was in the room with you, and where were they standing ?
My brothers were all in bed, and no one else was in the room,
(c) Again, who was in the neighbourhood t
Two of my brothers were in bed, and the third one was with
me talking to the policeman. The two in bed were not in a
position to hit me on the right shoulder, as they were exactly to

(D) Who was in the room besides yourself? If your brothers
were in bed, what have you to urge in support of the theory that
no one of them threw it, except that they said they did not and
you don't think they did?
No one was in the room except myself. My brothers were in
the next bedroom, and it was impossible for any of them to throw,
as it seemed to come exactly from the wall behind me.
(E) Who was present, and how far from the disturbed part of
the wall ? Was it light enough for you to see the stones moved ?
My brothers were in bed, about half a yard from the wall. It
happened at 2.40 a.m.
Later, W. Winstanley wrote to Colonel Taylor as follows :
8 CHURCH STREET, UPHOLLAND, September nth, 1904.
DKAR SIR,
Since you left, Mr. Corless and others have seen both
lights in the room and pieces thrown nearly every night. Last
night 2 pieces of stone were thrown before ten o'clock in the
presence of two gentlemen from Platt Bridge, near Wigan. Another
piece was thrown about 11.30, after every one was in bed. Sorry
you did not hear anything.
Yours respectfully,
W. WlXSTANLEY.
Our readers will not fail to observe that the incidents
here described follow closely the usual type of " Poltergeist "
phenomena in three important respects : («) The particular
features which would afford the strongest evidence of super
normal agency were not observed, but merely inferred : the
fragments were never seen coming out of the wall, but
merely found lying on the floor, or at most seen flying
through the air, the starting point of the flight not having
been noticed, (b) The phenomena most strongly attested seem
to be but barely beyond what human agency, under the con
ditions as described, could have produced. (c) They ceased
entirely in the presence of an experienced investigator, and
only recommenced after his departure.
II.
In the following case, the phenomena appear to be of an
•even more dubious nature. This case also was widely reported
138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.
in the papers, and information was sent to us about it by the
Rev. A. C. Custance, of Binbrook Rectory, Market Rasen,
Lincolnshire, who kindly gave much assistance in the enquiry.
He wrote to us as follows on January 28th, 1905:
. . . The farm house is occupied by a foreman and his wife
and two or three children ; some young men and a servant girl
also live in the house.
Leading out of the " big kitchen " are two back kitchens, and
it is in these that the various things have occurred, e.g. :
(1) Some sausages hung on a string were twice found lying on
the ground [and] on being tied even more securely were found
on the floor and separate from the string.
(2) A number of empty bottles stacked behind the door suddenly
fell and smashed.
(3) A dozen plates off the shelf were found in a milk pan
which was full of milk.
(4) A great can of cream with a stick in it was found topsy
turvy and the stick laid on the top.
(5) A large piece of bacon was suddenly seen to fall from where
it was, and shortly after
(6) Two large biscuit tins also fell.
(7) One day, when they were all at dinner in the "big kitchen,"
the floor was deluged with dirty water; on going into one of
the back kitchens, a bucket of dirty water standing near the door
had been noiselessly upset.
(8) On another occasion the foreman went into this very kitchen
to wash his hands and noticed some pig-meat, of which he is
very fond. He came to the other end to wipe his hands, and,
on turning to go out, saw the bucket was upset and the pig-meat
on the ground.
(9) This act was repeated in the presence of another man.
(10) A dead rabbit hanging on a nail in the second back place
was found thrown behind a beer barrel twice.
(11) On the window-sill of kitchen were about a dozen geranium
plants in pots. One morning they were found lying in a row on
the dresser. The wife showed me how they were, but said there
was more earth fallen from the one which she had laid down than
from all [the others together] when she found them laid.
(12) The last thing is the most tragic. On Saturday morning
at 9 a.m., some of the children's clothes were hanging on the
guard before a not very good or big fire. Three times some of
OCT., 1905. Tiuo Poltergeist Cases.
them caught fire and the servant girl called to her mistress and
they were put out, but not before they were badly burned.
(13) About 10 a.m. the foreman started for the village, but
found that he had forgotten something he wanted. He ran back
to the house and found the girl near the door, sweeping the
floor. To his astonishment she herself was on fire behind, but
did not know it. He put out the flames as well as he could, but-
not before she was badly burned behind. She is now in the
hospital at Louth.
I saw the girl almost daily ; she declared that she did not
know she was on fire or how she got on fire.
I have no reason to think that the people are otherwise than
truthful, and I certainly cannot account for these phenomena unless
it is possible that the girl herself or some one else in the house
is an " unconscious medium."
The people are very anxious that the matter should be sifted,
and I advised them to wait till the girl returns from the hospital,
to see if anything happens in her absence. One feature is that,
with the exception of the biscuit tins and the bottles, the various-
things were done without any noise. . . .
A. C. CUSTANCE.
From a second letter of January 31st, 1905, we make the
following extracts :
I am sorry to say that the people at the farm have called in-
the aid of spiritualists who have already had a seance there, and,
I believe, with some kind of result. ... I hear that nothing has
happened since the girl left. I wrote to the matron about the
latter and had a long letter from the doctor in charge of the
case ; he seemed to think that there was nothing uncommon about
the girl. ... As far as I know, all the phenomena occurred in-
about a month's time. ... I am not sure that the people would
like any investigation other than that made by the spiritualists.
The servant will not be out of hospital for two or three months.
Mr. of Grimsby is the spiritualist who has been interesting
himself in the matter.
Colonel Taylor, who undertook to enquire into the case,
reported as follows. His report includes a plan of the premises-
(not reproduced here) showing the large front kitchen with the
scullery and small back kitchen, both opening out of it on
140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., I905i
the same side, and the dairy beyond the back kitchen and
opening into it.
March 8th, 1905.
On Monday, February 27th, 1905, I went to Great Grimsby,
and on the day following drove over to White's Farm to enquire
into the matter of the Binbrook Poltergeist.
Taking as a basis the 13 incidents mentioned by the Rev. A. C.
distance in his letter dated January 28th, I questioned Mrs. White
about the affair. I have no doubt that she is quite honest in her
statements, but she did not impress me as a very good witness.
Taking the various happenings mentioned by Mr. distance in
the order he gives them (which is, however, not quite the order
in whicli they followed one another, as I understood from Mrs. White)
I made the following notes :
(1) Mrs. White showed me where these sausages were hung
across a string which stretched from side to side of the dairy. I
made out that it was the [servant girl M.] who found them on
the ground each time, and it was always quite possible for her to
have thrown them down herself and then either at once or after
a time pretend to have found them on the floor.
(2) I make no other remark about this than that the place
where the bottles were was occupied by some shelves which, when
I saw them, had various things on them in such a way that I should
not think a smash improbable at any time.
(3 and 4) In these cases M. was again the finder and reporter
of the phenomenon, and it was as in No. 1 quite possible for the
girl, who was constantly about the kitchen, the two back rooms
and the dairy, to have done the mischief and then discovered it.
(5 and 6) It is not clear to me that the bacon was seen to fall,
though Mrs. White's mother was sitting in the kitchen at the
time and the girl was about. Mrs. White's mother is no longer
at the farm, and Mrs. White herself was at the time in bed, not
having yet completely recovered after giving birth to her 4th or
5th child. As to the biscuit tins, they fell when Mrs. White's
mother was upstairs and the girl alone below and supposed to be
engaged in the scullery.
(7) No one can say when this bucket was upset, and it is quite
possible that the kitchen " floor was [observed to be] deluged
with dirty water " some appreciable time after the last person who
left the scullery was at table.
OCT., 1905. Two Poltergeist Cases. 141
(8 and 9) I did not clearly make out where the girl was when
this took place, but I believe she was about her work in this
part of the house. Mr. White had his back turned to the place
when the bucket was first upset, and Gribson, the man Mr. White
called in to look, also had his back turned when the bucket was
upset for the second time. (See letter from Mr. Custance appended.)
(10) About this I heard nothing.
(11) It was in the window of the front kitchen that these geraniums
were ; no one knows when or by what means they were turned down.
(12) Mrs. White assured me that there was very little fire in the range.
(13) Mrs. White said she was in the kitchen with the girl, who
was sweeping the floor, a few minutes before her husband discovered
her to be on fire. She was 6 feet from the fire at the time Mrs.
White saw lu-r last, and had only gone two yards further off when
the alarm was given. I was given to understand that the girl's dress
caught fire at the waist behind and not below; but it became clear
to me, after having seen the doctor now in charge of the girl's case in
hospital, that her petticoats caught fire in the usual way from below.
Mrs. White told me that the first thing which compelled attention
was the milk pan being overturned on the last Friday in December,
1904, and that the other things have happened at irregular intervals up
to the time of the girl's departure, since which time they have ceased.
There was some mystery about the death of some fowls during
January—(a) Fowls which were about the farm-yard during the day were
sometimes found dead with their throats torn. I should account for
this by supposing a stoat, a weasel, or rat to have been the agent.
(b) Fowls found dead or maimed in the fowl-house in the morning.
Mr. the spiritualist, who has interested himself in this case,
told me that when this sort of damage was done, the padlock in
the fowl-house door was always first removed. Three times was
this done, fresh padlocks having been provided : the third time the
padlock was found near the fowl-house door and the other two
subsequently in the farm-yard pond close by.
I see more human-like procedure in this than ghostly. I suppose
a Poltergeist could get into the fowl-house without the trouble of
breaking the lock, and I heard from Mr. Custance something
about a discharged farm hand as a possible agent in the matter.
About Mr. White's boys I found out nothing ; I did not see them
nor were they mentioned by any one I spoke to on the subject of
the disturbances; neither did I see Mr. White, who was out shooting
at the time I called.
142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1905.
After quitting the farm I called on Mr. distance, who confirmed
by word of mouth all that he had stated in his letters, but I got
nothing new from him except that there had been trouble about
the fowls and one of the men on the farm had been lately discharged.
On my return to Grimsby I saw Mr. who had taken a
" sensitive " to the farm and was quite convinced of the abnormal
character of the disturbances on account of what his "medium" told
him, in addition to what he heard from the farm people.
On Wednesday morning I went to Louth and saw Dr. G , who
is attending M. He told me that he had found hysterical symptoms
in his patient, and that from the nature of the injury she had sustained
he agreed with me that the tire must have originated at the bottom
of the dress and petticoats.
From the Doctor's house I went to the hospital and saw the
girl herself; she was now nearly recovered. I do not think she
always told me the truth in answer to my questions, but [she]
agreed that the fire began at the bottom of her dress and, as she
said, "a spark from the fire, I suppose," originated it.
To sum up. All the phenomena were noiseless, except in two
instances; hence no one knew when they took place, and of the
two exceptions one might easily have been an accident, and the other
occurred just when M. had the best of opportunities of causing it.
In nearly all the cases the girl seems to have been the first to
discover them. This suggests a previous knowledge on her part.
The doctor reports the girl hysterical.
I do not think we have any right to attribute these disturbances
to other than human agency, but if there remains anything which
cannot be thus accounted for, the evidence for it is so weak that
I don't believe that the case will be of any value to the Society
for Psychical Research as an instance of abnormal manifestation.
LE M. TAYLOR.
The following is an extract from the letter from Mr.
Custance to Colonel Taylor, referred to in the latter's report :
March 4<A, 1905.
I went up to White's Farm this afternoon. 1 saw both husband
and wife. I was right as regards the bucket, but wrong as regards
the biscuit tins.
The latter only fell once, when Mrs. White was upstairs and
the girl M. in the back scullery. (Query, Did she move them?)
The bucket in that scullery turned over first when White was in
there. His wife put it right with the pig's meat in it, and refilled
it with water, while White had gone to fetch a man named Gibson :
while, however, the latter was in the scullery, and had turned to
come out, it went over again !

REPORT OF A CO-COGNITIVE DREAM.
BY Sin JAMES CRICHTOX-BROWNE, F.R.S.
MY friend, Dr. F. H. Clarke of Dumfries, who is no sooth
sayer, but a cautious and accomplished physician, told me
some time ago of a curious dream that had been brought
146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.
under his notice, and which he could not by rational analysis
resolve into normal constituents. It was not a precognitive,
but what might be called a co-cognitive dream, in whicli
was represented a series of events occurring simultaneously,
or almost simultaneously, at a considerable geographical dis
tance. Knowing that what had created in Dr. Clarke a sense
of mystery must be worthy of further consideration, I put him
in communication with Sir William Crookes, and a correspond
ence ensued, Dr. Clarke's part of which is here submitted to
the members of the Psychical Eesearch Society.
CHARLOTTE STREET, DUMFRIES, N.B.
22nd January, 1904.
DEAR SIR WILLIAM CROOKES,
I have received your note of 20th inst. about a dream or
experience of a mother regarding a fatal accident to her son,—some
seventy or eighty miles away,—both undoubtedly occurring within
a few minutes of each other.
The people concerned are all so respectable, and so far removed
from any suspicion of creating a sensation either about themselves
or others that I don't think the facts can be questioned. Even the
small discrepancies, such as the dream bridge being the railway-
bridge visible from the parents' house, and not the one at Paisley
Station where the accident occurred, the mother still insists upon. . . .
I propose getting a statement from the mother and from all
others who can confirm her story at first hand, signed by each. I
shall also ask the Hospital Authorities at Paisley to let me have
a full note of the time of admission to the hospital and nature of
the injuries of the patient. (He died the morning after admission,
but was conscious when found on the railway.) So soon as com
plete, I shall forward you the statements, and I shall be most
careful to be as accurate as possible in every detail, and have inde
pendent confirmation where possible.
The dreamer is the least likely woman to have had such a strange
experience—a solid, matter-of-fact, practical, hard-working woman
of the smaller farmer class, who " had had dreams like other people,
but never paid the smallest attention to them, and never once
thought or believed all her life that they might come true."
Yours very truly,
FRKD. HUGH CLARKE.
Nov., 1905. Report of a Co-cognitive Dream 147
3rd February, 1904.
Before replying to your letter of the 23rd ult. I waited till I
could get a personal interview with the " dream " woman. The
following is a clear statement got from her the other day. She is
absolutely trustworthy.
Mrs. Kerr, Gateside, Holywood, Dumfriesshire, one night in June
ten years ago, retired to bed at 10 o'clock. She fell asleep shortly
after, and dreamt that she saw one of her sons—a fireman on a
passenger train,—hanging on to the tender of an engine. As the
engine passed through a bridge her son's head struck the masonry
and he fell, the wheels seeming to " pass up along his body." She
saw that his right arm was seriously injured and his right leg
completely severed below the knee, the boot being on the foot.
He raised his hand to the right side of his head, which she saw
was seriously injured.
She woke with a scream,—the hour being ten minutes to 11
o'clock. She woke her husband and told him, who tried to assure
her it was only a dream. (This the husband has confirmed to me.)
Unable to rest, she got up, lighted the fire, and went to a neigh
bour's house, Mrs. Dickson, now dead,—to whom she told the
story. She also woke Mrs. Mundell, Holywood Kirkhouses, (still
alive), and asked her to send her son, young Mundell, with a
message to her own son who lived at a distance, begging him to
come to her, as an accident had happened to his brother. Before
the arrival of the two young men, a telegram arrived at Holywood
Station at 2 a.m. summoning Mr. and Mrs. Kerr to Paisley Infir
mary, as their son had met with a serious accident at Paisley
Station the night before.
Before starting for Paisley in the morning Mrs. Kerr told M'Ardle,
the Station-Master at Holywood, (and still there), about her dream,
asserting that her son's injuries were of such a nature that he must
either be dead, or that he could not possibly recover.
On their arrival at Paisley the son was still alive, though uncon
scious, and he died shortly after. His injuries were exactly as she
had seen in her dream. At the coffining the same night she noticed
the absence of the right leg, and on asking for it, it was produced
with the boot still on the foot.
The only discrepancy between the dream and the reality was that
the bridge where the accident occurred, (which she visited and saw
hair and blood on the stonework), was outside Paisley Station, while
148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.
she insists that the bridge of her dream was one in view of her
Dumfriesshire home.
Mrs. Kerr related to me two somewhat similar experiences. On
December 27th, 1903, when walking along the road about 8 p.m.,
near her home, a light as if from a lantern shone in front of her
feet. There was neither light nor person near. Her pallor was so
marked when [s]he got home that her relatives asked what had
happened. She replied that she did not know, but that something
had happened to one of the family. Next morning she received a
letter stating that an aunt had died at that time the night before.
When 21 years of age, Mrs. Kerr had promised to sit up with a
sick neighbour all night. When about to proceed to the house, the
form of the sick woman appeared distinctly before her. Mrs. Kerr
said to her friends that there was no need to go now, as the woman
was dead. It was found that the woman died at the very time the
apparition appeared.
Mrs. Kerr says she knows quite well when those experiences
signify more than mere dreams.

Enclosed you will find
(1) The official account of the accident to Kerr, supplied by
the Secy, of the Glasgow and South Western Railway Co.
(2) The record in the Case-book of the Paisley Infirmary, where
Kerr was taken to.
(3) The statement of M. M'Ardle, Station-master at Holywood.
(4) A statement made to me and signed by Mrs. Mundell and
her daughter about the events occurring on the morning
of 15th July, 1894.
Mr. Kerr, the husband, has confirmed to me the statement of his
wife that she woke him, and told him the dream before the arrival
of the wire. He is at present living some 5 or 6 miles from Dumfries
with a son, so I did not get his signed statement to-day as I had
hoped, but could procure it. The daughter also told me she knew
all the details of the dream before her mother and brother left for
Paisley.
The only discrepancy in the various statements is that the
Mundells are almost certain that Mrs. Kerr had received the
message before she woke them. About all the details as already
given of the dream they have no doubt, and told me the story
exactly as Mrs. Kerr gave it to me.
Nov., 1905. Report of a Go-cognitive Dream. 149
The Mundells say that Mrs. Kerr was very friendly with Mrs.
Dickson, since deceased, and may have visited her house before
receiving the message. She was certainly told all details of the
dream the same morning.
Though very sceptical as to the whole affair at first, I have not
the slightest doubt now about the bona fides of the story, and any
little discrepancies are without doubt due to defects of memory
after nearly ten years.
Should you wish further confirmation I shall endeavour to pro
cure it.

THE EOYAL ALEXANDRA INFIRMARY,
BARBOUR PARK, PAISLEY, 23rd May, 1904.
DEAR SIR,
I am in [receipt of] your letter of the 20th asking
particulars of patient called Edward Kerr. On looking up the old
admission register, I find that on the 14th July, 1894, a fireman
called Edward Kerr was admitted to hospital as the result of a
150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1905.
railway accident. He is entered as suffering from fracture of the
skull and compound fracture of the leg, and died on the 16th,
moribund ; that is to say, he died within 48 hours of admission.
I regret that I am unable to give any further particulars, as this
happened so long ago, and a new hospital has been built since
then, with a consequent removal. I am sure the patient would b<-
quite unconscious the whole time.
Yours faithfully,
J. L. BKOWXKIDGE, Med. Supt.

HOLYWOOD STATION, DUMFRIES, 2Wi Mut/, 1904.
A wire was received on loth July, 1894, from Paisley, between
I and 2 o'clock a.m., asking the parents of Edward Kerr to go
with the morning train to Paisley as their son had been injured
the night before, and taken to the infirmary there.
I travelled to Kilmarnock Station with Mrs. Kerr and her son,
James, the same morning, and can recall that Mrs. Kerr looked
forward with the gravest concern to her son's condition. I do not
remember Mrs. Kerr saying anything to me about her dream of
the previous night. M. M'CARDLE, Station Master.
(4.)
HOLYWOOD KIRKHOUSES, NEAR DUMFRIES, 25th May, 1904.
Mrs. Mundell and her daughter, Agnes Mundell, distinctly
remember the night of the accident to Edward Kerr 10 years ago.
Mrs. Kerr woke them up after midnight, and asked Mrs. Mundell
to send her son to Hardlaw Bank Farm, some distance off, to ask
James Kerr, her son, to come to Kirkhouses, as his brother had
met with a serious accident on the railway.
Agnes Mundell remembers distinctly Mrs. Kerr telling her about
a dream she had that night after going to bed, when she thought
she saw her son hanging to the tender, [and] his head strike a
bridge she recognised as one near Holywood Kirkhouses. The
wheels seemed to pass over him, and she saw that his right leg
was bleeding, and completely severed below the knee. He had
also received other injuries.
Both are of opinion that Mrs. Kerr had already received a
message from Holywood Station to the effect that the son had met
with an accident before she woke them.
For some time after the event it was a subject of common talk
in the village that Mrs. Kerr should have told them of a dream_
Kov., I9or>. Report of a Co-cognitive Dream. 151
which was found to be accurate in every detail, with the exception
of the particular bridge at which it happened. The incident of
her asking for the missing leg of her son at Paisley, and it being
produced and put into the coffin, was told to them by Mrs. Kerr
•when she arrived at Holywood with the corpse.

Dr. Clarke wrote Inter :
October 8th, 190*.
. . . The husband says he was very tired and waked out of a
sound sleep by his wife, but told her she had been dreaming, and
that he wished to go to sleep again. I could not get more out of
him than that he remembered she said their son had met with a
serious accident on the railway.
The son James who was sent for, I tried to get into communica
tion with, but he was in the Navy, and on Foreign Service last
year,—where, they were not quite certain.
I may add that I asked no leading questions, and tried to gh e
only such particulars as the various people interviewed seemed quite
clear about.
Unconscious self-deception is peculiarly apt to arise in cases such
as those narrated, and my whole anxiety was to get particulars
about which they were perfectly certain.
Dr. Clarke's letter of February 3rd, 1904, was then sent
to him with the request that he would obtain from Mr. and
Mrs. Kerr signed attestations of the accuracy of his report,
since they had not themselves %vritten a first-hand account
of the case. He replied on October llth, 1905, enclosing
the statements asked for, as follows :
This afternoon I called upon the Kerrs, and enclose signed state
ments by both as to the accuracy of the report sent in February, 1904.
A daughter who was present (aged about 25) vouched for the
"experience" of 27th December, 1903, having occurred as stated.
Her mother's pallor on coming into the house made her ask what,
was wrong, and the rest was as written.
It is all very perplexing; the only thing I am quite certain of is
that these people are speaking the truth, or at least what they
believe to be the truth. FRED. HUGH CLARKK.

CASTLEYARDS, TORTHORWALD, DUMFRIESSHIRE,
October 11th, 1905.
The statement made by me, and as given in the letter to Sir
William Crookes, of 3rd February, 1904, is true in every particular
so far as I am aware.
"On Soul and Conscience." ELLEN KERR.
CASTLEYARDS, TORTHORWALD, DUMFRIESSHIRE,
October lltk, 1905.
I, the undersigned, James Kerr, certify " On Soul and Conscience "
that on the night my son met with his fatal accident, my wife woke
me and told me particulars of the accident, and this before any
telegram arrived apprising us of it. JAMES KERR.
When this dream was first mentioned to me by Dr.
Clarke, I was under the impression that it was of recent
occurrence. The fact that ten years elapsed before the evi
dence bearing on it was put in writing materially reduces
the value of that evidence ; for memory, honest memory, has
a trick not merely of rounding off corners and of creating
gaps, but of filling up hiatuses and of making things fit in
generally, and under the histrionic tendency in human nature
the marvellous is apt to become more and more marvellous
after each rehearsal. It is possible, therefore, that Mrs. Kerr's
recollection of her dream, and Mrs. and Miss Mundell's recol
lection of the account she gave of it while it was still
simmering in her brain, are more circumstantial and conform
able to fact than was the dream itself. The testimony of
Mrs. Dickson, to whom Mrs. Kerr first told her dream, and
who is unfortunately dead, would have been of great value
in the exegetical examination of this strange passage. The
difficulty of attaining strict accuracy in such matters after an
interval of time is illustrated in the documents submitted.
Mrs. Kerr is under the belief that she narrated her dream
to Mrs. and Miss Mundell before receiving the telegram
announcing the accident to her son, but Mrs. and Miss
Mundell believe that she was in possession of the telegram
before she did so. Mrs. Kerr affirms that she told Mr.
M'Cardle, the station-master at Holywood, about her dream,
but Mr. M'Cardle has no remembrance of that. Had she
done so, a fact of so startling a nature could scarcely have
Nov., 1905. Report of a Co-cognitive Dream. 153
escaped his recollection in connection with the observation,
which he does recall, that she looked forward with the
greatest concern to her son's condition, as without dreain-
warning she naturally would do when summoned by telegram
with her husband to Paisley on a Sunday morning on account
of " a serious accident " to her son. Dr. Clarke's narrative
taken down from Mrs. Kerr's lips states that the accident and
dream occurred in June ; the fact being that they occurred in
July. The letter of the Medical Superintendent of the Royal
Alexandra Infirmary, Paisley, sets forth that Edward Kerr, a
fireman, was admitted on the 14th July, 1894, suffering from
fractured skull and compound fracture of the leg, the result of
a railway accident, and died on July 16th, within 48 hours
of his admission, the facts being that he died on July 15th,
within twelve hours of his admission.
It was natural that Mrs. Kerr, an affectionate mother,
should from time to time feel anxious about her son, follow
ing the somewhat dangerous occupation of a fireman on a
locomotive engine ; it was in the ordinary course of things
that her anxiety should from time to time take shape in
visions of the night, and the occurrence of such a vision on
the particular night on which an accident actually happened
to him would have been a coincidence and nothing more had
not the nature of the vision been unique, and had not its
details corresponded exactly with the details of the accident
which was taking place contemporaneously with it.
Mrs. Kerr's dream was no common one ; it was not even
one of those rarer lurid dreams that startle, interrupt sleep,
and set the heart beating for a little, but are recognised as
mere dreams and discarded. It was a dream vivid to the
verge of eye-sight, and leaving behind it a sense of the super
natural. Mrs. Kerr awoke with a scream, aroused her husband,
told him her dream, was uncomposed by his assurances, got
up and lighted the fire. That much is clearly established.
Whether it was before or after receiving the telegram
announcing the serious accident to her son, and summoning
her and her husband to Paisley, that Mrs. Kerr visited her
neighbours, Mrs. Dickson and Mrs. Mundell, communicated to
them her dream, and sent for her younger son living at a
distance, must remain in doubt. If she did all this before
154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., isos.
receiving the telegram, then she must have been profoundly
impressed by the ominous nature of her dream ; if she did it
ufter receiving the telegram, her conduct was what might
have been expected, and magnification of the dream may have
taken place in the light of the terrible news brought to her.
That Mrs. Kerr is correct in maintaining that she communi
cated her dream-born apprehensions to her neighbours before
any telegraphic confirmation of them had reached her is made
probable by the statement of Mrs. and Miss Mundell that
Mrs. Kerr called them up "after midnight," whereas Mr.
M'Cardle, the station-master, states that the telegram from
Paisley arrived at Holywood between 1 and 2 o'clock a.m.
But it is in the minutiae of Mrs. Kerr's dream, and in their
exact correspondence with the details of the catastrophe that
befell her son, that its remarkable character is manifested.
Mrs. Kerr dreamt that her son fell from the tender of the
engine.
He actually did so.
She dreamt that his head struck the masonry of a bridge.
That is what actually took place, and she afterwards saw
his hair and blood adhering to the stonework.
She dreamt that the wheels seemed " to pass up along his
body."
The official report says he " rebounded against the train."
She dreamt that his head was seriously injured on the
right side.
The official report shows that the skull was fractured on
the right side.
She dreamt that his right arm was seriously injured, and
his right leg completely severed below the knee.
The official and medical reports set forth that the right arm
was seriously injured, and that there was a compound fracture
of the right leg necessitating amputation at the knee.
She dreamt that the boot remained upon the foot of the
severed foot.
When the amputated leg was produced to be placed in the
coffin it was seen that the boot was still on the foot.
Mrs. Kerr's dream ended by her clock at 10.50 p.m.
The accident, according to the official report, took place
"about 10.35." Allowing for possible inaccuracy in the clock
Nov., 1905. Report of a Co-cognitive Dream. 155
or in the noting and reporting of the time, the dream and the
accident must have been nearly if not absolutely simultaneous.
Now no theory of coincidence can cover the correspondence
between the details of the dream and the facts in this case.
The chances are, I suppose, a million to one against such a
" concatenation accordingly " happening by chance. The facts
are undoubted ; the dream is well attested. Even the little
discrepancies between the dream and the facts—Mrs. Kerr's
impression that the accident took place at a bridge in view of
her own house, instead of at a bridge at Paisley, and that
the leg was severed during the accident instead of subsequently
by amputation—are in favour of the fidelity of her narrative
and opposed to any supposition of concoction.
The dreamer is, as Dr. Clarke says, " a solid, matter-of-fact,
practical, hard-working woman." She belongs to a class—the
smaller farm class of Scotland—sternly veracious, unimaginative
in the larger sense, but not free from superstition. She had
never paid the smallest attention to dreams, or believed they
might come true, but she had once seen a death-warning light
and once a wraith. It might therefore be held, on the one
hand, that she was a woman constitutionally susceptible to
subtle and occult influences ; on the other, that she was prone
to hallucination and self-deception. If the dream rested solely
on Mrs. Kerr's recollection of it, it might be set down to
unconscious exaggeration, confusion of thought, embellishment,
but it is fully and directly corroborated in all particulars by
the husband and daughter and by Mrs. and Miss Mundell,
and is vaguely supported by many neighbours who remember
that immediately after the fatal accident to Edward Kerr, his
mother's wonderful dream was the subject of general discussion
in the parish. It is much to be regretted that it was not
then caught and thoroughly sifted by some competent inquisitor.
I attempt here no explanation of the dream, but I think
it is deserving of being placed on record. It is very similar
in character to a dream experienced by Dr. Walter Bruce, of
Micanopy, U.S.A., and reported in Human Personality (Vol. I.
pp. 413-15), and is of the class referred to by Sir Thomas
Browne in his Letter to a Friend upon occasion of the Death
of this Friend. " Although at this distance," he says, " you
had no early account or particular of his death, yet your afifec
156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., i9os.
tion may not cease to wouder that you had not some secret
sense or intimation thereof by dreams, thoughtful whisperings,
mercurisms, airy nuncios or sympathetical insinuations, which
many seem to have had at the death of their dearest friends."
The scientific study of dreams has yet to be undertaken. If
a number of persons who waste their time in keeping diaries,
wearisome registers of humdrum existence and frivolous events,
would take to keeping noctuaries instead, and would faithfully
jot down their dreams each morning, and where practicable
connect these with their waking experiences before and after,
we should soon have some valuable material to work on. I
feel sure that dreams have sometimes a pathological significance
that is not sufficiently attended to.
CASE OF TRANCE WITH CONTINUOUS MEMORY.
THE. following report of a case of spontaneous trance was sent
to us by an Associate of the Society, the Rev. J. W. Hayes,
Vicar of West Thurrock, Grays, Essex. Mr. Hayes observes
that one sees in it " the same apparently malicious propensities
which usually accompany the appearance of the secondary or sub-
consciousness." An interesting feature in the case is that there
seems to have been an inhibition of will-power, coupled with
an underlying continuity of consciousness and memory, which
was only discovered by a careful subsequent cross-examination
of the patient ; whereas in these cases a complete break in
memory or loss of memory generally occurs, or is alleged to
occur. In this respect the case shows some analogies with
the instructive autobiographical account of some phenomena
of " pseudo-possession " given by Mr. C. Hill Tout in the
Proceedings, Vol. XL pp. 309-316. We also find in hypnotic
cases the same complete, though veiled, consciousness of all
the real surroundings of the subject or patient, together with
a frequent subsequent recollection of the events of the
secondary condition.
October 3rd, 1905.
On Sunday, October 1st, 1905, about 8.45 p.m., on a dark even
ing, I, Joseph W. Hayes, Vicar of West Thurrock with Pnrfleet,
Nov., 1905. Case of Trance with Continuous Memory. 157
Grays, Essex, was returning from Purfleet after divine service when
I saw several persons around the vicarage door, and soon found that
some one lay stretched on the sofa in the dining room in a sort of
faint. Those present were trying to restore the patient to her normal
condition by slapping her with a wet cloth, application of smelling
salts, and rubbing, but no particular result followed. She lay in the
trance from 8.30 p.m. to about 12 p.m. I had hot jars put to her
feet and a rubber hot-water bottle applied to her hands, also tried
to make her swallow hot coffee and spirits, but the teeth were firmly
clenched, the face pallid, the extremities cold, the lips pale, and the
eyelids tremulous but closed. The patient had been engaged in
singing hymns at an outdoor meeting, and collapsed after gazing at
the bright lamp for a few moments, falling helpless to the ground,
from whence she was carried to the sofa of the vicarage. She is a
young married woman of about 26 or 30 years of age, the wife of
a bright young man, but with no family. For a long time past she
has been engaged in outdoor evangelistic work, and is religious, sincere,
unpretending, and of excellent character. She is of the emotional
type, somewhat hysterical, with eyes somewhat larger than usual.
She was anxious about the salvation of her husband and much
interested in his spiritual welfare, stating that she is confident as
to her own spiritual condition. Her name is Mrs. J. Parkhurst, of
31 Darnley Road, Grays, Essex. She is of medium height, and
rather darkish hair.
I got some whisky and asked a Mr. B. Smith to rub one hand
while I rubbed the other, but after nearly 20 minutes we grew
tired, and yet the heat was very slow to return. It then struck
me that it must be a case of hypnotic trance, or similar trance, with
which I had been familiar years ago, and the fact of the respiration
being so even convinced me that I was right. From that on I treated
the matter in a light trifling mood, and said to those around, "There
is no danger, it is but a case of trance, and she will come to herself
later on." I knew from that on that she heard all we said, although
so motionless, and so I was cautious what I did say. Then after a
while, about 10 o'clock, I sent for her husband and also for Dr.
Steward, New Road, Grays, telling the messenger to say distinctly
that it was "a case of hysterical trance" (the way he would know
what to bring). Then I stooped down and, with a spoon and the
handle of a tooth brush, tried to open her jaws ; at this she was
convulsed with suppressed laughter, but never opened her eyes.
Then I said, "Open your eyes, you are only humbugging us. If
158 Journal of Society for Psychical Researdi.. Nov., 1905.
you do not waken I will get something cruel—a hot iron or a
battery." But she made no movement. I then said to those present,
"She hears all we say, but cannot waken herself. It is 26 years
ago since I saw a case like it. Patients in this state are full of
tricks and do most outlandish things; they sometimes use very bail
language, for which they are scarcely responsible, and cannot be
aroused except by a shock, such as a cry of fire, a loud voice,
application of a battery or a hot iron."
About 11 o'clock her husband came, and, stooping over her,
called her name, but she moved not. Then he pinched her
nostrils and held her breath, but with no better effect. During
a short portion of the time she sobbed and said, " He won't be
saved, he won't be saved." I said, "Who?" and she said, "Jack."
Shortly afterwards her husband and Mrs. Philbey and myself
took her home to Grays in a cab, still apparently unconscious,
carried her upstairs, and intended to place her in bed. While doing
so I fell and the patient fell upon me, whereupon she again burst
out laughing, with the teeth clenched and eyes closed. After a few
minutes she relapsed into the same state of coma, but after I had
left the house about an hour, or less, I heard she awakened quietly,
while her husband was in the room, but not near her. She felt better
and expressed regret at the trouble she had caused, but distinctly
remembered every incident from the hymn and address by Mr. Philbey
to the moment I fell in the bedroom.
On Monday, October [2nd], I went to see her at one o'clock
and enquire particulars. She met me at the door quite cheery,
and looking well. Having asked her to relate the incidents of
the previous night, she said, " After I sang I listened to Mr.
Philbey's address, and one or two of the things he said seemed
to come home to me and suit my husband's case. The lamp
then attracted me, and as I gazed at it I felt drawn to it, and
then, feeling queer, fell. Then they carried me into the vicarage and
I knew they were getting frightened because I did not revive. They
were getting more frightened until you came, and you seemed to
understand the case, and I felt that they became less alarmed. I
never lost consciousness any part of the time, but heard all they
said and knew what they were doing, but I seemed not to have the
power to use my will. I heard you say, 'There is no danger at
all, it is simply a case of hysterical or hypnotic trance. Was she
gazing at a light ? ' You then said, ' Get the hot-water bottle and
rub her hands well, we must get the blood back from the heart to
Nov., 1905. Case of Trance with Continuous Memory. 159
the extremities.' Then when I was a little warmer you pinched my
ears and said, 'Get me some hot coffee and get me a spoon and a
toothbrush.' The spoon holding the coffee was hot and burned my
lips, so I turned my head quickly aside. You then tried to pull
my eyes open, and slapped them with a wet cloth. When you tried
to open my mouth with the spoon I laughed, because I thought it
great fun that you could not open my jaws. It afforded me much
amusement, and I felt that I was purposely keeping my teeth closed,
but why I should do it I don't know. Then I heard you say,
'Wake up and don't be humbugging us.' I remember opening my
eyes for a moment and seeing three ladies around me, one with a
black hat, also Mr. Philbey and Mr. Smith. It amused me to see
you all trying to waken me. I heard you say, 'Get the book and
read out the directions to recover a fainting person,' and then I heard
some one reading it. I could not see with my eyes closed. I felt
I was doing it on purpose, and quite enjoyed the fuss you were all
making, but still I had not the will to stop it. Of course after I
really wakened, about a quarter to twelve, I was sorry to have
caused such a commotion, but I was not a bit sorry at the time.
I recollect coming home in the cab and also your fall upstairs. That
was so funny I had to laugh. I was very near wakening twice,
first when Mr. Smith pressed my hands too long on the hot-water
jar, and I felt them burning, and more so when I heard you say,
'The only thing to rouse her is a hot iron.' I thought to myself,
' This won't do, I must waken before the hot iron comes,' but as it did
not arrive I did not waken. I felt that although it was I who was
doing all this, and doing it purposely, yet I could not use my will
against it. Further than this I cannot explain, as I do not under
stand faints. I had this sort of faint once before, but not for so
long a time, nor was I gazing at any light on the former occasion.
It came on suddenly. In that case Dr. Ward held my nose tightly
and I awoke. Thank you very much for your kindness and the
others also."

brought to visit some pictures (sacred), became entranced at one of
them and fell to the ground. When brought to visit the same
pictures about a year afterwards he again fell into the trance.

CORRESPONDENCE.
[The Editor in not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]
To ttie Editor of the
JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESKARCH.
October 26<A, 1905.
Being greatly interested in certain phases of Psychical Research,
especially in relation to that class of phenomena ascribed by some
persons to the manifestation of spirit entities, and feeling that I
should like to take part in a more concentrated and determined
effort than has yet been made to test the truth or falsity of this
hypothesis, I would be glad to meet a few like-minded persons—
preferably living in, or having easy access to London—who would
join me in investigating this important subject, and who would meet
once a month to exchange experiences, discuss the bearing of such
experiences upon the spirit or other hypothesis, and devise means
of useful investigation, with a view to supplying our Society with
records or memoranda of sufficient importance for further consideration.
It appears to me essential that those willing to unite in this effort
should not be convinced spiritualists, but persons with an absolutely
open mind, who have no a priori objection to such hypothesis, if
facts should logically point thereto, and who, whilst utilising all
tests that so-called mediums will grant, will recognise that the con
ditions of the phenomena being unknown we must not insist too
rigidly upon irksome tests, and, whilst recognising that a certain
amount of self-delusion, and even fraud may be expected amongst
public " mediums," believe that there remains a certain amount of
truthful phenomena which may be investigated with advantage.
I would, therefore, very much like to hear from a few intelligent
persons, members of the S.P.R., to whom the above description will
apply, and I believe if my suggestion be adopted it will be useful
in forwarding the objects of the S.P.R.

PEIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
THE 13th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only
was held in the Large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London,
W., on Friday, October 27th, 1905, at 4 p.m.; Sir Oliver
Lodge in the chair.
THE HON. EVERARD FEILDING, after stating that he proposed
to change the subject of the paper which he had been announced
to read, spoke to the following effect :
I have no paper, and if the remarks which I am about to
make required a title, I would suggest that of " The Haunted
Solicitor, an Unfinished Comedy." The case of this gentleman
first came before me about Christmas last, when I received
a letter from an Honorary Associate of the Society, Dr. S.,
in which he stated that a " Poltergeist " had broken out in
his town, and that long and careful observations of the pheno
mena had forced him to the conclusion that they were of a
supernormal character, a conclusion in which he felt all the
more confidence in that he had been assisted in his researches
by a professional conjuror who had confessed himself unable
to account, by means of any trickery known to him, for a
large number of the occurrences. I accordingly, at the end
of my summer holiday, repaired to the town of N. to join Dr. S.
in his observations. There I learnt that in 1900 a certain
Dr. Q. had been found guilty of a fraud of so complicated
and at the same time motiveless a character that he was
remitted for observation to a lunatic asylum, and was sub
sequently declared irresponsible for his actions. I mention this
incident only because of its possible psychological bearing on
what followed.
In 1904 Dr. Q., now apparently cured, became a solicitor,
and set up in business with an office boy, the premises being
shared with a lodger, an engineer of a superior class. To
wards the end of the year, according to Dr. Q.'s story, he
found that small articles began to be thrown about in his
office without visible cause—sealing wax, pens, matches, cushions,
etc. These manifestations increased to such an extent that
he ultimately invited Dr. S., who was known to be interested
in psychic phenomena, to come and investigate the matter.
DEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 163
Dr. S. accordingly entered upon a long series of careful obser
vations, spending some 20 days and 40 nights at the office,
during which period he sometimes witnessed as many as 50
or more " phenomena " at a sitting. Many, if not most, of the
throws were within the competence of the mediums, i.c. Dr. Q.
himself, the boy, the engineer, and later a clerk, who took
the place of the original boy. But there was a considerable
balance which he considered entirely beyond the possibility of
fraudulent accomplishment. According to his observations,
objects were frequently thrown in orbits impossible to them,
i.e. from a corner of the room where no one was, towards
the mediums. Sometimes objects, which Dr. S. had placed
in an adjoining room immediately before, were thrown iu
the se'ance room ; and very frequently, when all the persons
present had left the room, Dr. S. coming last, objects were
thrown at him from behind, or could be seen, on his turning
suddenly round on the threshold, to be following him out.
He called in the assistance of Mr. M., a well-known conjuror.
Mr. M., who, having shown up Miss Fay and Prau Abend
some years before, naturally rather fancied himself as an
exposer of mediums, arrived in a completely sceptical state
of mind, but in the course of some seven stances became
convinced of the impossibility of their accomplishment by any
trickery known to him, and retired baffled declaring himself
convinced that some agency other than mere trickery was
concerned. The matter ultimately reached the newspapers, and
became the talk of the town. Persons visiting the offices had
been the victims of the " poltergeist." A piece of sealing wax
would fly at the nose of one, a candle would drop mysteriously
into the hat of another. Clients fell away. " Either," they
argued, " our solicitor is a knave or a fool, which is bad ;
or he has a devil, which is worse. And in either case he
is not a fit person to whom to entrust our business, and
we will not employ him." So they didn't, and Dr. Q.
languished, and his financial affairs reached a state of crisis.
Now, it will be recognised that this was therefore a polter
geist with very respectable credentials. It had, at the time
of my arrival, continued under close observation for some ten
months. It had been vouched for by a man of science, Dr. S.,
and by a professor of legerdemain. It had ruined its chief
164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC.,
medium. During the endless stances it had come hopelessly
to bore the rest. Motive, if it was fraudulent, seemed absent.
The engineer, who had till then generally attended its per
formances, had all to lose professionally by his connection with
it. If the phenomena were fraudulent, it was evident on
analysis that all four mediums, Dr. Q., the engineer, the boy,
and the new clerk, must individually each be implicated. Thus,
though the previous mental disturbance of Dr. Q. might over
come the difficulty caused by the apparent absence of motive
so far as he was concerned, there was no reasonable explana
tion for the conduct of the others. No money had passed,
except that Dr. S. had given Dr. Q. £3 towards the rent of
his rooms and paid a small fee to the boy for his attend
ances. A practical joke at Dr. S.'s expense would be worn
rather thin after 60 stances, lasting frequently from 9 p.m.
till 1 or 2 in the morning. And yet it went on.
Dr. S. stated that he noticed that the phenomena were
not constant. For some time they would be very active, and
then a period of comparative quiescence would supervene. It
appeared unhappily that my arrival took place at a " mini
mum period." Dr. Q. declared that he had lost so much
through the goings on of his poltergeist that he could only
consent for the future to exhibit it against a fee of 10s.
nightly, and 5s. for the clerk. Foolishly, I consented to pay
this amount, and the stances began. A number of small
objects were placed about the room for the poltergeist to play
with, and a map was made of their whereabouts. When the
mediums were closely watched nothing whatever occurred, and
exceedingly little when they were not. By way of experi
ment opportunities were frequently given them to do their
worst, yet the phenomena lagged distressingly. During the first
eight stances there were under twenty throws. All of them
were well within the competence of the mediums, i.e. Dr. Q.
and his new clerk, and even then almost always took place when
our backs were turned, and never when both mediums were
under close observation. A screw would fall in the corner, or
a small firework bomb would explode upon the floor just
when my attention was diverted. An ash tray would fall at
my feet just when I was playing a stroke at billiards. A
stone would fly against the wall when I was looking in
DEO., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 165
another direction, and when it was picked up would be found
to be warm. When, as was occasionally done, the medium's
hands were tied, even these modest phenomena ceased altogether.
The proceedings were inconceivably ridiculous. The stances
took place in a room, generally in Dr. S.'s house, brilliantly
lit with gas. Dr. Q. would occasionally count "1, 2, 3!" in
the expectation that something would jump. It never did.
Or we would be told to rush furiously from the room in the
expectation, based on earlier experiences, that something would
follow after us, swept up as it were in a kind of psychic vortex.
But the expectation was always disappointed. A pear would be
placed in a plate. " Now, see this jump ! " said Dr. Q. Every
one turned his back. "1, 2, 3!" Every one turned quickly
round again ; the pear remained peaceably seated in the plate.
At the end of eight stances I declined to continue, and
expressed a decided opinion, which was not favourable to the
evidence for the intervention of a competent poltergeist. Dr. Q.
was moved almost to tears. Dr. S. was exasperated. " I
admit," he said, " that all you have seen is merely suspicious.
But this is, as I have said, a ' minimum period.' The
phenomena we now get cannot be controlled, unless by a lucky
chance, and their present character and rarity is doubtless as
vexing to the mediums as to yourself, and it is not on things
of this kind that I and the conjuror have formed our opinion."
An argument of this kind was of course unanswerable.
After all, what was a poltergeist ? A geist which poltered.
This unquestionably poltered. Therefore, it might be a polter
geist. I accordingly agreed to remain one night longer to see
what would happen when the mediums were reinforced by the
engineer, who had hitherto declined to attend except once, and
who promised to be present. Much happened. But instead
of the objects in the room being thrown, other objects—a lump
of sugar, a key, coins, buttons, etc.—which had not been there
before, made their appearance, and two large fireworks went
off with a great smell and clatter. The poltergeist had at length
been goaded into activity, and brought off a fine effort, but,
unhappily, as usual just when no one was looking. Dr. Q.
was triumphant. " Are you convinced ? " he asked. " Quite,"
I answered. " I shall leave to-morrow, but I think you might
have made a better show."
166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DTK., 190&.
Next day I received a visit from Dr. Q., who appeared
distressed at the effect produced by his poltergeist, whose
genuineness he still vigorously proclaimed. His reputation as
a solicitor, he said, would suffer, even worse than it had done
already, by my contrary conclusion. I sympathised deeply
with his grief, but disclaimed responsibility for this conse
quence. If the poltergeist chose to conduct itself precisely in
such a way as to cover itself and its mediums with derision,
that was not my fault. I pointed out, however, that its late
performances at all events rendered control more possible.
While it had confined its attention to a number of small
objects inside a room in which the mediums were allowed to
walk about, and always threw them when I was not looking,
it could only be said that its ineptitude was paralleled by its
timidity. But now that it had taken to introducing external
objects, the situation had changed. It had itself suggested a
method of proving its own existence. Steps could at least be
taken to meet it on its new ground. If the mediums would
consent to be adequately searched before the stance, and the
poltergeist nevertheless continued its activities, it would at least
begin to merit a certain measure of respect. I added that I
was not prepared to go on paying for the pleasure of seeing
it try, but that if it succeeded under the conditions of search
which we should impose, I would pay him £10. "Done," said
Dr. Q. The poltergeist was at all events a sportsman.
And as my summer holiday was not yet finished, and N. was
a pleasant place, I decided to be no less. I cancelled my
tickets, and sat down to await events.
My narrative till now has been long, though the time to
which it relates was short. The reverse must now be the
case, and I hurry over the final scenes. The conditions of
the stances became severe. The mediums were stripped naked
and elaborately searched, given new clothes, and brought into
the seance room, which had previously been carefully examined.
On three occasions " apports " nevertheless made their appear
ance, i.e. (1) 6 small firework bombs about the size of the
end joint of a little finger and a stone of rather larger
dimensions ; (2) 5 stones, of which the largest was about an
inch in diameter, and the others not much smaller ; (3) 6 more
bombs.
DEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 167
Between these occasions there were long blanks. Night
succeeded night, and nothing happened. The objects in the
room were immovable. The mediums consented to any and
«very condition. Their frankness and cheerfulness were enough
to disarm an ironclad. The clerk was especially most winning.
He made half-confidences, admitted having thrown things when
in the office in order to dpater Dr. Q., and stated that the boy
and the engineer had done the same. He said that at first
he had believed the whole thing to be attributable to this
form of jest, but had gradually become convinced it contained
a further element, and he denied ever having " assisted " the
phenomena during the stances with Dr. S. or with me. The
boy, whom I twice saw, made a statement to precisely the
same effect. He, too, had often imitated the poltergeist in
order to take a rise out of Dr. Q., but never during the formal
seances. He supposed the thing was a joke somehow, though
he didn't know how the joke was done, or who had done it.
But it must be a joke for all that, for he didn't believe in
ghosts, and things couldn't move of themselves—a simple
philosophy, but apparently honest. Its soundness was strongly
disputed by Mr. M., the conjuror, who then appeared on the
.scene. He too disbelieved in ghosts, or had done. But he
knew something about trickery, and the things he had seen
were not within its range. Objects had been thrown at him
while alone in the brilliantly-lighted room, and from a direction
opposite to the door of the adjoining room in which were the
mediums. Objects which he had himself just marked and put
•011 a table were immediately afterwards thrown at him from
behind, when the mediums were within view and in front of
him. Objects which he had noticed in a particular place, and
the movement of which he felt would be evidential if it only
occurred, were, within a second, thrown accordingly, the mediums
being again within view and at a distance. Finally, there were
the long and careful observations of Dr. S., the notes of which,
made contemporaneously, I went through with his assistance,
and which, if accurate, seemed clearly beyond explanation by
normal means.
The effect of all this on my own mind was singular. I
-appeared to lose touch with actualities. Once admit the pos
sibility of such things—and the mere fact of investigating them
168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1905.
implied such an admission—where could one stop ? I wrote at
the time that I began gradually to feel that if a man seriously
told me that the statue of the Albert Memorial had called in
to tea, I should have to admit that the question to be solved
would not be the sanity of the narrator, but the evidence for
the fact ! Slowly, my sense of the probability of things began
to decay. When " phenomena " happened, it is true, my mind
suffered a violent reaction : I felt I had been " done " in some
unascertainable way. But when they didn't, as was generally
the case, I took to reflecting " what honest mediums ! " For
though our watchfulness as to " apports " was undiminished, we
left them a free hand as to ordinary " throws." Yet no
" throws " took place, while " apports " did.
The end was dramatic. Partly by luck, partly by obser
vation, and partly by a consequent statement wrung from the
clerk, we discovered the secret. The method employed was
the more ingenious in that our minds had fixed upon it early
in the proceedings, and its possibility was discussed and
eventually dismissed, after apparently adequate means had been
taken to guard against it. It was, alas, physiological rather
than psychical, and involved the use of a tubular instrument
about 7 inches in length and an inch in diameter, pointed at
both ends. The method is not unknown to native workmen at
De Beers, but its employment by a sober solicitor was certainly
surprising. The size and character of the so-called " apports "
had seemed to make its adoption impossible, but the use of the
instrument, a refinement upon native practice added by Dr. Q.,
had facilitated it. Our imaginations had indeed been fairly
active, but had failed to soar to that. Dr. Q., who, to do him
justice, had shown considerable heroism in the cause of his
poltergeist, admitted that he had been at last found out, and
supplied interesting details of his modus operandi.
I shall be asked, why then do I call the comedy " unfinished " ?
Well, the confession is still incomplete. Dr. Q. admits the
fraudulent character of the " apports," but denies that he had
any part in producing the earlier phenomena. In this he is
supported by the clerk, whose own statement had enabled us
to bring home the ultimate fraud, in which he certainly had
no part, and of which, had it not been for Dr. Q.'s recklessness,
he might have had no knowledge ; also, on a subsequent cross
DEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates.
examination, by the engineer and the boy. I have, of course,
no temptation to pay the slightest heed to statements proceed
ing from such tainted sources, for the clerk's belated statement
was only made under fear of immediate discovery. But I am
confronted with the observations of my predecessors, who are
disinclined to modify their views as to their accuracy, notwith
standing the subsequent catastrophe. It is a dilemma of which
either horn seems equally uncomfortable. If, then, this polter
geist desires to pass into history as a well attested hobgoblin,
it can at least produce as its credentials the evidence of a man
of science and of a professor of legerdemain. Though of course
he agrees that the phenomena during my stay, even when not
proved to be fraudulent, were uniformly suspicious, the former is
inclined to say, " This was at one time a perfectly respectable
ghost, or other supernormal form of agency, and you with
your money and your scepticism have debauched it." Well,—
perhaps. If poltergeists are, this was possibly one once. But
my own observations, at least, are certainly not encouraging to
a belief in it.1
After some discussion of this case and an adjournment for
tea, SIR WILLIAM CROOKES took the chair and SIR OLIVER
LODGE gave a brief sfccount of some sittings he had lately
had in the company of Dr. Maxwell at Bordeaux, the medium
being a person well known to Dr. Maxwell and with whom
some of the phenomena described in his recent book Les
PMnombnes Psychiqves had been obtained.
In these sittings, raps occurred, but chiefly of a non-
evidential character, viz. with contact ; sometimes they were
obtained by means of a pencil held point downwards on the
table by the medium, the point touching the table continu
ously, and small shocks coming down the pencil ; they were such
as might possibly be due to some unconscious muscular action
1 Dr. 8., to whom the above has been submitted, writes that he cannot recede
from his original opinion on the following grounds :
(1) That the original " evidential " throws had taken place at a time when he
fully believed Dr. Q. to be fraudulent.
(2) That the first exposure had regard to apports only, which had nothing
whatever to do with the "evidential" throws.
(3) That the exposure threw no light on the way in which the "evidential ':
throws could have been done by any method of fraud.
(4) That the confession of fraud is limited entirely to the apports.
170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DK., 1905.
on the part of the medium, but they showed subconscious
intelligence, and appeared perfectly honest. Only occasionally
had they got raps without contact, and on one occasion he had
seen in a good light a table move slightly without apparent
contact; instead of rapping, the table gave intelligent jerks or
little sudden movements, but how they were caused he was not
prepared to say. These also, however, he considered honest.
As to lights, those seen while he was there were of a dim
and faint description, little better than a dim glow, and were
seen moving about near the medium. Once or twice they saw
sparks rapidly moving like glow-worms and luminous patches
thrown on the wall behind the medium. The mo'vement of
these lights sometimes indicated intelligence.
On one occasion when they were sitting for lights, and not
getting them, in a small room which had a high window with
borrowed light, the control " Chappe " said by raps through the
pencil, " It is not quite dark." " Yes, it is." " No, it is not,
light is coming through the window." Then they observed
that some outer covering over the window had slipped a little,
and a faint gleam was the result. Chappe wished the medium
to go out and readjust it. The medium and Dr. Maxwell
accordingly went out, he himself remaining in the dark, and
on their returning he noticed that the medium was glowing
with light, all over—on skin of face and neck and clothes.
Dr. Maxwell could see nothing, having been out in the light.
After this he tried to discover the cause of the luminosity
of the medium after exposure to light. It was not of the
nature of that due to phosphorus, but was a case of stored
luminosity akin to that of sulphide of calcium. He tested the
medium's clothing, hair-brushes, etc., and found them all
luminous, and the fact that the oldest garments were the most
luminous, and were examined without forewarning the medium,
tended in the direction of genuineness, a possible explanation
being that the medium secreted a luminous perspiration, pro
bably containing calcium sulphide. At any rate the effect can
be imitated by the artificial use of calcic sulphide ; and the
perspiration is being analysed. He was not sure whether this
was a novel experience or not, but Professor Richet, when
consulted about it, said it was new to him. He tested the
phenomenon carefully, thoroughly cleaning the neck of the medium
Die., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 171
by chemical means, and examining the skin in the dark, after
which Dr. Maxwell wrapped him up, and made him exercise
himself under strict supervision until he perspired again,
then exposed him to sunshine, and finally brought him in
to be examined by the observer, who remained in the dark
for that purpose. The skin was then found to be lumin
ous under crucial conditions ; so that what had appeared as
a suspicious circumstance turned out to be a natural
physiological phenomenon, which may possibly be of occult
interest, since it may account for the chemical basis of some
of the lights produced at sittings. It may also explain the
alleged luminosity of certain mediaeval saints. He saw no clear
reason at present for regarding it as a mediumistic pheno
menon. The medium was taking at the time a tonic contain
ing a phosphate of lime, and he also ate six eggs a day, which
contain sulphur, so that after all it may be possibly a simple
physiological or rather a pathological phenomenon. But it
must be further investigated, and must be tried with other
persons. These experiments are going on.
It may be worth while to add that "Chappe" claimed responsi
bility for introducing the phenomenon to notice, by having sent
the medium out into the light; and, when catechised about
it, replied first that it would be interessant d analyser, and
later gave, also by means of raps, the following sentence
regarding it : Les phosphorescences se voient qu'avec un vttement
Uger et & travers celui-ci toutes les fois qu'un sujet sensible absorbe
des preparations phosphorus il elimine par la peau le phosphore.
Sir Oliver Lodge then proceeded to give a brief preliminary
notice, calling attention to Professor's Kichet's recent experi
ments in materialisations at the house of a leading private
family in Algiers, which would be shortly described by Prof.
Richet in the Annals of Psychical Science. The experi
ments, according to Professor Richet's account, were con
ducted in a room with a corner curtained off, behind which
two young persons were sitting, the medium (a young
lady of 18 or 19) with sometimes one servant, sometimes
another. Then a figure materialised, the curtains were thrown
back, and the phantom appeared. The light used was a
dull red light, but sufficient for enabling them to see
the whereabouts of the two people in the corner, and to see
172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., IMOS.
the figure more easily because it stood forward near the
curtain and sometimes came out into the room. A number
of cameras were directed upon it, and then a magnesium
flash was used, and it was photographed. It appeared to be
a man's figure, heavily draped, with only the face visible, a
kind of helmet on the head, and a chin-cloth draped to hide
chin and ears. It stood near the curtain and held the drapery
in such a way as to hide the face of the medium by screen
ing her from the magnesium light, though her dress was
visible as if she were still sitting on her chair as usual. The
face of the figure did not look so solid and substantial as
the face of the other person behind the screen. The weak
point was that the actual body of the medium was not
visible, but only her clothes. The outlines of her knees
appeared to be visible through the skirt, and the upper part
of her body seemed to be in the dress, but the sleeve of the
outstretched arm looked rather empty. The medium, however,
was thin, and it was possible to arrange a lady's thin arm
and sleeve so as to give the same appearance. It was diffi
cult to imagine that the medium was not where she appeared
to be, and the room had been searched and no drapery was
found ; also there was no trap-door to introduce confederates.
The same figure had also been seen by the same family and
other observers very many times for some years, with another
medium altogether.
The phantom moved out into the room, and spoke in a-
hollow voice. If an ordinary person breathes through lime
water, a precipitate of chalk is formed, and Professor Pdchet
was anxious to test the phantom's power in this direction. It
consented only after some persuasion. At the next sitting
the phantom could be heard blowing, but not effectively down
the tube into the lime or baryta water. After some failures,
it succeeded in doing this, and a white precipitate was then
produced.
SIR WILLIAM CROOKKS, in reference to Sir Oliver Lodge's
remarks as to the resemblance of the luminosity of the
medium's skin to that of sulphide of calcium, observed that
it would of course be very easy to apply sulphide of calcium
to the skin or clothes, but that it quickly decomposed in
the presence of moisture, producing sulphuretted hydrogen*
DEC., 1905. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 173
which would be easily recognised by its strong smell. He
asked if Sir Oliver Lodge had ever noticed this smell in the
course of the experiments.
SIK OLIVER LODGE replied that he had moistened the clothes
for this very purpose, and had sometimes detected a faint
smell of sulphuretted hydrogen.
CASE.
L. 1149. Eeciprocal.
The following account was received from Miss I. M. Pagan,
of 24 Newbattle Terrace, Edinburgh.
May 8th, 1905.
On the night of Wednesday, 17th of March, 1904 (as nearly as I
•can remember the date), I was sleeping in my own room at the top
of this house, my sister Elizabeth being in the room next mine. In
the middle of the night—at what hour I do not know—I was
awakened by a curious sensation of pressure from above, as of a
weight resting gently but firmly on me, and looking up saw my
sister Elizabeth suspended in some way above me in the air. She
was lying with her eyes shut, covered with a quilt as if in bed, and
looked very pale and ill. I felt no surprise but only concern for
her evident suffering, and a strong impulse to get up and minister
to her. (She is subject to occasional attacks of severe pain, and I
have nursed her through them very frequently.) However, as soon
as I tried to rise I found myself too heavy with sleep to do so.
My eyes would not open, and my shoulders seemed as if held down
by their own weight. Yet I had felt quite wide awake and fully
conscious of where I was, of the furniture in the room, etc. It seemed
as if I gave up the attempt to rise, partly because she made me
understand that she did not need my help, but only wanted to be
near me. So I put out my arm—half sitting up, and without effort
—and guided her to a place beside me on the bed, falling asleep
again as soon as she was comfortably settled. She seemed to flout
through the air much as a child's india-rubber balloon would do, and
was quite easily moved when I touched her. After a while I woke
again with a start and a feeling of distress at my own laziness, and
again made an effort to rise, thinking remorsefully that she had been
in pain and I ought to have got up and made a poultice, but had
done nothing for her. There was again a difficulty in rousing myself,
and then came the recollection that she was beside me, so that I
174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DM., 1906.
didn't need to rise. I sat up (once more with ease) and asked, "Are
you all right now"? I heard her answer, "Yes, I am all right,
thank you," and went to sleep again."
In the morning I was wakened by my youngest sister Hilda, who
came into the room saying, "Betty sent me to tell you that you
came to her in your astral body last night." " No I didn't ! " I
exclaimed, "she came to me. Was she in pain?" "Yes."
I went to my sister's room and found she had been suffering during
the night, had thought of calling me, but decided she wasn't ill
enough to need any treatment. After lying awake for about half-
an-hour she fell asleep, and was awakened by my voice asking " are
you all right now?" and looking up saw me near the door of her
room—rather a shadowy figure enveloped in bed-clothes, even the
head being partially covered. She answered, " Yes, I am all right,
thank you," and went to sleep again with the impression that I had
somehow ministered to her.
As a matter of fact I was lying much muffled up, as I had felt
cold and drawn the clothes well up over my ears. I am perfectly
certain I did not get out of bed all night, and I have never done
anything in the sleep-walking line. This is my only "psychic
experience " worth recording. I once previously had the same strong
impression of a friend having come to me in the night, but have no
corroborative evidence. . . . My attention was not directed to these
subjects at the time, and I dismissed the incident as a curiously
vivid dream ; but though I dream a good deal, these two experiences
stand out from other dreams as different. I feel that whatever the
state of consciousness may have been, I was awake and alive to my
physical surroundings in a way quite unusual in ordinary dreams.
A cousin (Mrs. Young) came to live with us on the 15th March,
and recalls that it was after she arrived that the incident took place.
I left home on the 22nd, so the " vision " came to me between these
two dates, I believe on the 17th. ISABELLE M. PAGAN.

. . . The sleep-walking theory would naturally suggest itself, but

note my sister's very momentary impression of my presence and how
it faded away, and also the fact that it never for an instant
occurred to her that it could be myself. Now the room she slept
in is very small, 18 ft. 6 x 10 ft., and the bed was quite near the
door—within 6 ft., and her hearing is exceptionally quick and her
sight good (except that she wears glasses for reading). If I had
really been there she would have heard me. On one or two
occasions when I have felt poorly I have gone to her room to boil
some water on her gas fire, and she always heard me the moment
I entered and asked, " What is it ? " I have never walked in my
sleep nor have I heard of any grown-up member of our huge
connection doing so. Various little children among dozens of cousins
and nieces have got out of bed occasionally and wandered into
their mother's room, or crossed the floor to the nurse's bed, etc., etc.
One of my own sisters did so twice or thrice when she was about
five. ... Of course there may have been cases of older sleep
walking in the family ; for my mother had 100 first cousins on one
side of the house alone, and we have relatives by the score whom
we scarcely know ; but on the whole we are a healthy and normal
set, and if there had been anything striking in that line I should
probably have heard of it. I see in my sister's account she says
she felt ill on going to bed. None of us had any idea of that. It
never even struck me she looked poorly.
Miss Elizabeth Pagan writes :
24 NEWBATTLE TERRACE, EDINBURGH, June 20^, 1905.
My sister, Isabelle Pagan, tells me you wish to have a statement
from me relating to the curious sort of dream she and I seemed to
experience in common some months ago. My recollection of the
incident is that while retiring for the night I felt far from well,
but I did not mention the fact to any one lest one of my sisters
should think of sitting up with me or at least staying awake on
the chance of being wanted. Isabelle's room is next to mine and
I knew I could summon her if necessary by knocking on the wall.
After two or three somewhat painful hours I fell asleep ; and
towards morning, though the room was still very dark, I woke, as
if from a dream, hearing myself say, "I am all right now, thanks,
Belle." At the same time I seemed to see a shadowy form which
I somehow knew to be Belle, though she was unrecognisably muffled
up in white drapery. The whole vision vanished literally in the
winking of an eye, for, as I winked myself awake to look again at
170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1905.
the puzzling apparition, it was gone. When my sister Hilda
entered my room before breakfast, the first thing I said to her was,
" How is Belle 1 Please ask her why she paid me a visit in her
astral body last night." Belle's answer to this message was, "Indeed
I didn't! Tell her slie came in her astral body to me\"
Then Hilda heard details of the two dreams ; and we all felt
convinced that Belle had, by some sort of telepathy, been conscious
that I was in pain and been able to make me aware of her
sympathy.
Neither of us has ever been known to sleep-walk and as we have
generally shared a room with a sister—often in fact roomed with
•one another—it is hardly possible we could have done so without
its being known. The doors were not locked, but we both believe
them to have remained shut all night. There was no one near
enough to have heard if we did move about.
Isabelle and I have very frequently dreamt like dreams; that is
to say, we have both dreamt of the same scene or the same people
on the same night ; but this is the only case of any sort of
communication being recollected by us both on waking. The re
port already sent you of this incident was written by my sister
Isabelle and signed by her as well as by Hilda and myself. . . .
ELIZABETH H. C. PAGAN, (M.A. Edin.).
Miss Hilda Pagan wrote as follows :
24 NEWBATTLE TKRRACE, EDINBURGH, July 20th, 1905.
One morning in March 1904 my sister Elizabeth told me when
I went to her room before breakfast, that she had been ill in the
night and had dreamt our sister Isabelle had been in the room,
standing near the door, and had asked, "Are you all right nowl" On
the invalid saying " Yes," Isabelle had disappeared, and indeed she
had hardly been really recognisable according to outward appearance;
Elizabeth had rather recognised her intuitively, and spoke to me
of the dream as probably an " astral experience," an explanation I
readily believed. I went to waken our sister in the next room and
said, " Betty says you visited her in your astral body last night."
"Oh no, I didn't, she visited me," Isabelle answered. "I was
wakened by her on my bed ; she was ill, and I tried to sit up and
make her comfortable, but I slept, and only woke once, when I
asked, 'Are you all right now?' and she answered 'Yes.'"

own room, and, on happening to look up, I saw Mr. Ward standing
at the bay window and looking in at me as though he desired to-
speak to me. He was in his usual dress and is not a man to be
easily mistaken for any one else. Thinking he had brought some
letters for me, I rose hastily and went towards the window calling
to him and waving my hand to him, partly in greeting and partly
as a sign for him to go to the hall door, but when I reached the
window I was surprised not to see him. I concluded, however,
that he must have gone to the door without my noticing and so I
hurried to the door to let him in. I was exceedingly surprised and
alarmed when I opened the hall-door to see nobody there, nor any
where about the house. Later when Mrs. Berwick came down I
told her—and also Mr. Berwick—of my experience, and like myself
they felt extremely anxious lest some harm had happened to Mr.
Ward, for whom we all felt a strong regard.
Next morning, however, soon after eleven o'clock Mr. Ward
arrived in his trap according to arrangement to take me to the
railway station to join the train for Manchester. He was in a.
very weak state and suffering from severe injuries to his ankle,
neck, and shoulders, and he remarked to us, " It is a wonder I have
been able to come to you in the body." It seemed that whilst
driving home on Tuesday the horse, which was a very nervous,
animal, upset the trap and caused him to be thrown out and hadly
bruised and shaken. The next afternoon, whilst lying on a couch
in his sitting-room, he was wondering what Mrs. Green would think
if she knew of the occurrence, when he suddenly heard her voice
outside the house. There being only an elderly woman in the
house he managed with great difficulty to get to the hall-door to
admit Mrs. Green, and was greatly amazed not to see her. The
time was between three o'clock and four, just about the time when
Mrs. Green saw his form at Whitchurch.
We certify that this account of the hallucinations seen and heard
by Mrs. Green and Captain Ward is correct.

In reply to your questions re Mrs. Green's experience in South
Wales, I may say that when she told me the circumstances I asked
FEB., 1906. Cases 195
her to repeat the account, and I took a shorthand note of it which
I transcribed and sent to her to get the signatures of the other
people affixed to it, so that I could send it then to you. For some
reason Mr. Green re-wrote the narrative (copied, I believe, from my
note) and his copy was sent [to] and signed by Mr. and Mrs.
Berwick and Captain Ward ; Mrs. Green handed it to me and I
posted it to you.
I have written to the other persons asking them to let me have
their individual statements, ... I know nothing of them personally.
Mrs. Green is a trance speaker and is engaged for Sunday
services all over the country ... I have known her for some
years and have the fullest confidence in her integrity . . . She has
had many very remarkable experiences during her life, but, as is
so frequently the case, no note was made of them at the time,
and so they are lost for all practical purposes. . . .
Mr. Orr obtained later the following statements from the
other witnesses in the case.

... I am quite willing to do what is reasonably possible to
confirm the statement made by Mrs. Green, but you have evidently
overlooked the fact that the original document is an attested one
and was signed while the incident was fresh in our memories; but
to sit down now and write an accurate account of what was said
and done last June is an impossible task for a very busy man. I
really do not remember the details sufficiently clearly to make a
statement which [could] be used for comparison with one made two
months ago, but you are quite at liberty to use our names in so
far as they relate to the statement already in your possession. I
am sorry I cannot do more.

From Captain Ward.
NORTHWOOD, BlRCHGROVE, CARDIFF,
2nd August, 1905.
I have pleasure in reply to your letter to give you here the
facts of the incident as it actually happened. On the 20th June last
I drove Mrs. Green in my pony trap to Mr. Berwick's house in
196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FUB., 1906.
Whitchurch, Cardiff, and on returning home to above address, met
with an accident, being thrown out of my trap backwards, hurting
my neck and ankle. On the following day the 21st inst. I was un
able to leave the house, and lay on the sofa in my dining room,
when between the hours of 3 and 4 p.m. I distinctly heard Mrs.
Green's voice outside the front door calling me. I managed to rise
from the couch and look out through the window to call her in, but
found no person there ; the time would exactly agree with that
when Mrs. Green saw my form at Whitchurch.
This I found out on speaking to Mrs. Green on Thursday the 22nd
inst. I had not seen her between the 20th and 22nd. The above
are the facts of the case.
FREDERICK WARD.
L. 1151. Collective Auditory.
Information of the next case was kindly sent to us by
Mr. E. R Pease, who wrote to Mr. Podmore of it as follows :
November 1st, 1905.
... A working woman was dying of cancer and was visited
daily by Mrs. Rix of Headland Cottage, Limpsfield. She died at
5.20 a.m. on Tuesday [really Monday] last, Oct. 30th. At the
same hour both Mr. and Mrs. Rix heard a knocking at their door
which awakened them. Mrs. Rix went down to see what was
there and found nothing. It is stated that the servant also
heard the knocking, but this may be inaccurate. It is stated that
the night was windy, but even on the windiest of nights, one does
not get up at 5.20 to go to the front door. At any rate I never
did. ...
We wrote to Mr. Rix (formerly Secretary to the Royal
Society) asking for a first-hand account of the incident from
him and his wife, and he replied as follows :
HKADLAND COTTAGE, LIMPSFIELD,
SURREY, November 10th, 1905.
I was lying awake in bed on the morning of October 30th when
I heard a distinct knocking which I took to be at the outside door
of the cottage. We knew that the woman in whom we were
interested (a Mrs. C., who lives about J mile from us) was in
a dying state, and I immediately assumed that one of her children
had come to fetch my wife. I therefore touched my wife to rouse
FEB., 1906. Cases. 197
her, and told her that I thought the C.'s had come to fetch her.
I do not remember whether anything was said to show that my
wife was awake or asleep at the time. She went down immediately,
but came back and said that nobody was there. The knocks were
not less than 5 and not more than 7 : I think there were five in
rapid succession, as of some one knocking sharply at the door. Our
bedroom is on the first floor, and the knocking sounded to be
downstairs,—was certainly not in our room. It did not occur to
us to attach any particular significance to the sound at the time.
The above is all that I can state at first-hand, but the following
at second-hand may be interesting. The servant, who sleeps in the
adjoining room, and who says that she also heard the knocking,
looked at her clock and found it to be 20 past 5 (her clock was
known to be a few minutes fast). At breakfast-time some neighbours
came down to tell us that Mrs. C. had died at £ past 5 that
morning. After breakfast my wife went to see the C.'s and they
told her that Mrs. C. had died at } past 5.
HERBERT Rix, B.A.
Mrs. Eix added :
I, the wife of Herbert Rix, also heard the knocking,—5 or 6
sharp raps, I should think. My impression is that it waked me,
but as my husband thinks I did not rouse till he touched me, it
is possible that I heard the knocking in my sleep, just before the
moment of waking.
I did not look at my watch at the time, but comparing it
before breakfast with our servant's clock, found that it (the watch)
was 8 minutes slower, and more accurate.
ALICE Eix.
SITTINGS WITH ME. CHAMBEES.
REPORTS appeared in Light in the early part of 1905 of a
" materialising " medium, Mr. Christopher Chambers, who had
been giving sittings in Huddersfield and other northern towns.
Later in the year his performances became notorious through
press reports in several of the Newcastle papers ; among these
reports was one of an exposure which took place on October 14th,
1905, as reported in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle of October
17th. According to a statement which we obtained from
Mr. Arthur T. Neale of Newcastle, who played the principal
part in this exposure, Mr. Neale, whose suspicions had been
198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.
aroused at a previous stance, went to the sitting with two
electric lamps, which could be turned up at any moment, and
when one of the forms came out he turned the light suddenly
on to it, and revealed Mr. Chambers dressed in a sheet, wearing
a false moustache and a paper turban in the character of an
Oriental. He drew back the curtain of the cabinet, and found
on the chair the trousers, socks, and boots of the medium.
Mr. Easthope, who had arranged for the sitting, returned the
money to the sitters, and wrote to the Newcastle Daily Chronicle
that Mr. Chambers had been " caught red-handed at my meeting
on Saturday, October 14, by one of the sitters, the medium being
found dressed up as a spirit form, much to the horror and disgust
of the sitters present."
After this, some of the spiritualists at Newcastle arranged for
a series of test sittings with Mr. Chambers, in the hope that
some evidence might be given of genuine phenomena. Their
report, however, was that the proceedings were quite incon
clusive, since, the medium having been adequately fastened inside
the cabinet, no forms emerged from it. Mr. W. H. Robinson,
who had arranged for these sittings, confirmed in a letter to us
the report of their unsatisfactory nature, adding " I found him
[Mr. Chambers] worthless as a medium and duly informed the
spiritual press, but no notice was taken."
At this period a photograph was circulated, representing
Mr. Chambers with an alleged " spirit form " in the background,
this form representing his supposed control, " Lottie." Not only
does an examination of the photograph show obviously suspicious
features, but the photographer, Mr. James Wallace of Newcastle,
afterwards sent a letter to the Newcastle, Daily Chronicle of
November 30th, 1905, through his solicitors, confessing that he
had prepared the plate by getting a young lady to pose as a
ghost, and had subsequently taken the photograph of Mr.
Chambers on the same plate. This has since been confirmed to
us in a letter from Mrs. Wallace, who states that the whole thing
had been intended by her husband merely as a joke at Mr.
Chambers' expense.
Mr. Chambers, professing himself anxious after this to re
establish his reputation, arranged through a gentleman in the
north of England, who was known to us and had previously
given us a favourable report of him, to give a few sittings to
FEB., 1906. Sittings with Mr. Chambers. 199
the Society for Psychical Research, on condition that nothing
should be paid to him, either for the sittings or for his expenses,
unless, in the judgment of the officials of the Society, conclusive
•evidence was afforded of supernormal agency : also that should
materialised forms appear, he would consent to his own per
son being reasonably examined by the sitters, in order to
verify that he and the apparition were separate existences ;
provided that neither the apparition nor the medium should
be suddenly clutched while the phenomena were going on.
On this agreement, which he signed before coming, Mr.
Chambers travelled to London, and four sittings were held in
the Eooms of the Society for Psychical Eesearch on December
12th, 13th, 15th, and 16th, being arranged for by Mr.
Feilding, Mr. Baggally, Colonel Taylor and Miss Johnson,
•who were generally present ; the other sitters being invited
•by them, and being mostly members of the Society, except
that Mr. Chambers brought a friend with him, though un
authorised to do so, on three occasions.
At the first sitting the medium went into a cabinet, and
purported to become entranced, when he spoke in a voice
slightly different from his ordinary one, but not suggesting
•any more alteration than could easily have been produced at
will. Two or three forms appeared, one a man with a short
black beard (Mr. Chambers himself wearing only a moustache),
who stepped out of the Cabinet and bowed several times,
holding out his left arm at full length. Mr. Baggally, who
sat next to the cabinet, could see that only the front
part of the form was draped, while on its back was visible
the back of the medium's waistcoat, he having apparently
taken off his coat. Later, a short form, supposed to be that
•of a child, was seen in the opening just within the curtains ;
this appeared merely as a vague white shape with no dis
tinct arms or head. The light in the room was provided by
a single electric lamp closely shrouded in red paper, so as to
give extremely little light. There was no feature in the
phenomena to suggest anything but deliberate personation of
" spirit forms " by the medium.
The second sitting on December 13th was practically a
repetition of the first, the " forms " being, if anything, rather
less distinct, owing to the medium insisting on still less light.
200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906,
Contrary to the stipulation in the agreement, no opportunity
was afforded for examining the medium during the appearance
of the " spirit forms."
At the third sitting, on December 15th, Mr. Chambers
was accompanied by Mr. John Lobb, a gentleman who is well
known for his interest in spiritualistic phenomena. On this
occasion, at the medium's own suggestion, he was tied in a
wicker arm-chair with some objects disposed on the floor near
him, and he stated that these or perhaps himself in his chair
might possibly be levitated over the heads of the sitters.
The tying was performed by Mr. Baggally and another gentle
man, both expert in such matters, and at Mr. Chambers's request-
the room was made completely dark. Nothing at all happened
except that during the sitting Mr. Chambers, on whose back
a small luminous patch had (without his knowledge) been
affixed, so that his whereabouts could be ascertained, was
observed gradually to work himself along into close proximity
to the objects disposed upon the floor. Possibly because when
he got there he found that on account of the security with
which he was tied he could do nothing with them, he-
worked himself partly back again.
The fourth sitting, on December 16th, was again one for
" materialisations." The electric lamp, shaded with red paper,
was again used, and gave a slightly better light than before.
The sitters were arranged in the usual horse-shoe in front of
the cabinet, Mr. Feilding and Mr. Baggally being seated
respectively at the ends of the horse-shoe nearest the cabinet.
After some conversation and a speech by the supposed control,
" Lottie," the medium went into the cabinet, and some time
later some vague white forms were seen, one appearing like a
white figure materialising from below, the drapery rising
gradually from the floor between the division in the curtains,
till the form appeared fully draped. It having been over and
over again pointed out to the medium that, while the com
mittee had no intention of violating their agreement not to
seize the " spirit form," the mere appearance of such a form
could not be regarded as evidential unless opportunity was
afforded of ascertaining that while the form was outside the
cabinet the medium himself was inside, Mr. Chambers, after
the return of the form into the cabinet, withdrew part of
FEB., 1906. Sittings with Mr. Chambers. 201
the curtain und revealed himself sitting in the chair and
moving about to prove that it was really himself, and
a white form to his right. He probably miscalculated the
quantity of light, for it was perfectly clear to those seated
near the cabinet that the form was merely a piece of white
drapery held in his right hand and waved about in a very
far from realistic manner. Later, an attempt was made to
simulate the gradual materialisation upwards of a spirit form
by slowly raising a piece of white muslin gauze between
the division of the curtains, which had now been drawn
together, the action being again perfectly obvious to those
seated near the cabinet.
Afterwards a completely draped form, the mouth of which
was also covered with drapery (Mr. Chambers wearing a
moustache), came out of the cabinet into the room. On being
asked by the sitters to shake hands, it offered its left hand
to each of them, and would not allow the right hand to be
seen or touched, Mr. Chambers having lost three of the
fingers of his right hand. On being asked whether it was
the deceased wife of one of the sitters, the form bowed
assent. As it advanced into the room Mr. Baggally and Mr.
Feilding saw the black trousers of the medium behind it,
the drapery only covering the front part. After this form
had retired a man with a black beard was seen, but no
further opportunity for reasonable examination was permitted.
At the end of the sitting Mr. Feilding and Mr. Baggally
informed the medium of what they had seen, and that they
had no doubt that drapery and a false beard were concealed
about him. He denied absolutely that this was so, or that
he had taken any part in producing the phenomena. They
then asked him to allow himself to be searched in the
adjoining room, but he declined. Mr. Lobb admitted the
reasonableness of their request, and did his utmost to per
suade the medium to accede to it, stating that if it was
from motives of modesty that Mr. Chambers objected, he
himself would consent to a similar operation in order to
put him entirely at his ease. Mr. Chambers, however, per
sisted in his refusal, and presently took his leave. While he
did not in terms confess to any fraud, he promised that he
would give no more sittings, but would in future seek his
202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.
living in a more honest kind of work. It is understood, how
ever, that he has since resumed his operations in the north of
England, where doubtless an enthusiastic band of earnest
believers will, as usual, in the face of all evidence, continue
to support his stances.

Mr. Lobb adds :
I endorse the account of the proceedings in so far as it relates
to the sittings at which I was present. JOHN LOBB.
We conceive the above experiments to be of interest, as
showing how readily a certain class of persons will without
enquiry, test, or control of any kind, accept as evidence of so
transcendent a phenomenon as materialisation the childish
performances of Mr. Chambers and certain other mediums now
before the public. It is impossible to understand how, without
a long experience of the almost inconceivable credulity of such
persons, Mr. Chambers ever can have supposed that he could
by these artless tricks re-establish his reputation as a medium
for genuine phenomena. While it is true that the proof of
fraud on many occasions does not necessarily preclude the
possibility of genuineness on others, it is equally true that the
evidence from a thousand stances conducted without any control
and in the spirit of complete trust and confidence, with eyes
shut and mouths open,—apparently recommended by Dr.
Theobald in a recent issue of Light, and since then vehemently
protested against by other and no less earnest and sincere
spiritualists,—cannot advance us one step towards the proof of
such genuineness.
Not only must such a system be valueless as a means of
attaining reliable evidence, but it must itself in the long run be
absolutely destructive of the very phenomena which it is
intended to foster. It is a common and wholly justifiable
answer by spiritualists when challenged to submit their
FEB., 1906. Sittings vjith Mr. Chambers. 203
phenomena for inspection that they cannot be produced to
order. Yet the mere existence of a class of professional physical
mediums implies that there are a certain number of persons
who claim that they can so produce them. And when they
find themselves assisted by the all too charitable spirit of
observers like Dr. Theobald, what wonder is it that, tempted
by the opportunities for trickery constantly presented to them,
they take refuge in the simple method of deceit, thus gradually
killing out any germ of genuine mediumistic faculty they may
originally have possessed ?
It is not the interest of our Society to expose fraud, but
rather to seek patiently for evidence of genuine supernormal
phenomena. If, however, the spiritualist Press in the cause
of the pursuit of truth should wish to reproduce the above
report, together with these comments, they are at liberty to
do so.
Since our report was written, a letter has appeared in
Light of February 3rd, 1906, from Mr. John Wilson, of
Newcastle, giving some further details of the exposure of Mr.
Chambers as described by Mr. Easthope, with the following
statement :
I have a copy of the Medium and Daybreak of September 10th,
1880, p. 578, in which a report appears that Mr. Chambers, who
was then giving a stance at Gateshead, told the sitters that it was
difficult to materialise whiskers and moustaches, so the " guide "
had made a false moustache, and it was left as a souvenir !
THE EXPLOSION OF A MYTH.
WE reprint the following correspondence from Light, not from
any desire to give a wider publicity to our admitted refutation
of some charges brought against a Member of our Council,
but by way of illustrating the kind of criticism which is not
infrequently brought against our manner of conducting in
vestigations and of treating mediums. Misrepresentation so
categorical, so circumstantial, and consequently so easily refuted,
as in this case is rare. Less rare, however, are those mis
representations made up of more or less vague insinuations,
204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906_
which are as incapable of disproof as of proof. We hope
that this correspondence may serve to prevent an uncritical
acceptance by our members of accusations that may come to-
their ears of tactless and unsympathetic behaviour on our
part in the conduct of investigations.
In Lic/ht of January 6th, 1906, appeared a letter headed
" A Caution to Sensitives," as follows :
SIR,—Will you allow me, through your columns, to give a warning
to all sensitives not to sit at the Psychical Research Society's rooms
at Hanover-square, at any rate while the present council hold
office?
I am a life member of the Psychical Research Society and much
regret having to write this, but it is absolutely necessary.
A friend of mine, who is a fine sensitive, was asked some time
ago to give a reading, which she good-naturedly did, charging
nothing for her time and trouble. There was a person present who-
was smoking a cigar. For a man to fill a room with smoke in the
presence of a lady to whom he is a perfect stranger, a good deal
of effrontery is required ; but when the object of the meeting is to-
test the phenomena of visualisation his conduct becomes a down
right outrage. It also implies, either that the offender is entirely
ignorant of the conditions required to obtain psychical phenomena,
or that he wishes to render the sitting abortive.
In this case there is no doubt that this person did know the
conditions which clairvoyants demand for the successful exercise of
their gift, and the only conclusion to come to is that his object
was to embarrass the lady, and spoil the exhibition of her powers.
Fortunately, there was a gentleman • present who (according to
my friend's description) must, I think, be a powerful personality
and mediumistic, for his sympathy and tact dissipated the annoy
ance felt by the sensitive, and saved the situation. She has, how
ever, declined to sit again in rooms where she may meet with the
same antagonistic elements.
About six or seven weeks after this, and after she had declined
to sit again, she received a postal order, which just covered her
travelling expenses to Hanover-square and back. If the president
or any vice-president of our Society wish to know the name of the
offending member, I shall be glad to give it to them.

FEB., 1906. The Explosion of a Myth. 205
The following reply to this letter appeared in Light of
January 27th, 1906:
20, HANOVER SQUARE, LONDON, W.
January 18th, 1906.
SIR,—In your issue of January 6th, under the heading of " A
•Caution to Sensitives," there appeared a letter from Rear-Admiral
W. Usborne Moore, in which he made the following statements :
(1) That some time ago a sensitive of his acquaintance gave a
sitting at the Rooms of the Society for Psychical Research, for
which she made no charge.
(2) That there was a man present who was smoking a cigar.
(3) That this man's object (so Admiral Moore was forced to con-
•clude) was to embarrass the sensitive and spoil the exhibition of
her powers.
(4) That, besides the man who smoked there was a gentleman
present who, so Admiral Moore thinks, "must be a powerful
personality and mediumistic, for his sympathy and tact dissipated
the annoyance felt by the sensitive, and saved the situation."
(5) That the sensitive declined to sit again at the S.P.R. Rooms
in consequence of the treatment she received there.
(6) That six or seven weeks after the sitting she received a
postal order which just covered her travelling expenses to Hanover
Square and back.
I should have sent you an earlier reply to the charges and
insinuations contained in this letter but that it has taken me some
time to discover to what incident Admiral Moore's letter referred.
I applied twice to him for the name of the supposed culprit, but he
refused to give it to me, explaining that he did not wish to disclose
it to "any one of lesser influence than a Vice-President of the
•Society." Sir William Crookes was good enough to act as inter
mediary, and I now quote from a letter addressed to him by
Admiral Moore on January 16th: "Unless there are two people of
the name of Podmore, who both belong to the Post Office, and are
members of the Psychical Research Society, the person who insulted
Airs. \i.e. the sensitive] by smoking before and after she entered
the room was Mr. Frank Podmore, member of Council." The in
cidental mention of the sensitive's name has enabled me to identify
the occasion, for the lady in question has given one sitting, and
•one only, at the S.P.R. Rooms. To the coarser senses of Miss
206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.
Johnson and myself, who alone were present1 with her at this
sitting, the presence in the body of Mr. Frank Podmore, with or
without a cigar, was not perceptible, and there is no other member
of our Society bearing the name of Podmore.
When the sitting was over it was agreed that the sensitive should
write and let us know when she would come again. She wrote the
next day and gave us a choice of five dates, concluding her letter
with the words, " With thanks for your courtesy to me." We
accepted two of the dates proposed, but the sensitive wrote later
to us that she was unfortunately prevented from coming by the
sudden death of a friend.
On December 12th we learnt for the first time the amount due
to Mrs. for travelling expenses. On December 13th, that
being exactly three weeks (not six or seven, as Admiral Moore
states) after the date of the sitting, a cheque (not a postal order,
as the Admiral states) for the amount was sent to her. I can
not see any object in Admiral Moore's reference to this payment,
unless, as I suppose, he wishes to insinuate that our treatment of
her was niggardly. It may therefore be well to explain that we
understood, not only from the member who introduced the sensitive
to us, but from the lady herself, that she did not accept payment
for her sittings.
It appears, then, that out of the six statements into which I
have split up Admiral Moore's letter, the first alone is true ; but all
the rest, namely, those on which his charges are based, are untrue.
There was an animus shown in Admiral Moore's letter which
puzzled me until I learnt that the imaginary culprit was that
" bogey man " of spiritualists, Mr. Frank Podmore.
Miss Johnson and I, who, as I have already said, were alone
present during the sitting, desire to state that there was no smoking
either while the sensitive was here or during the earlier part of the
day. Miss Johnson appends her signature to this letter by way of
endorsement.
Thus the affair ends, where it began, in smoke ; except in so far
as it has furnished an instructive example of the mythopoeic
tendency.
J. G. PlDDINGTON.
ALICE JOHNSON.
'Miss Johnson and I are still jealously, not to say acrimoniously, disputing
which of us has the better claim to be identified with the powerful and
mediumistic personality whose sympathy and tact saved the situation.
FKB., 1906. The Explosion of a Myth. 207
Admiral Moore was then good enough to send us the following
copy of a letter which he informed us he was addressing to Light :
SIR,—Mr. Piddington and Miss Alice Johnson have stated in your
columns, and at the Annual General Meeting of the Psychical
Research Society last Friday that only three people, including the
sensitive, were present at the seance in the S.P.R. room, and that
no smoking occurred during the day.
Fortunately there is no doubt about the occasion, as my friend
has only once been in the rooms of the S.P.R. Moreover, some
of her statements to me agree with the notes of the seance.
I have seen the lady twice daring the last few days, and find
that in all essentials she adheres to her story, more particularly
as to the smoking and the number of people in the room, which
she declares to have been eight.
The person described to me as smoking was reported to have
said, with reference to his " reading " :
" Of course you know I belong to the Post Office," and the
sensitive alleged that his name was " Frank Rodmore or Podmore."
There is only one person to whom this description could apply.
As a matter of fact I find that no allusion was made to the Post
Office during the seance : certainly Mr. Podmore was not in the room.
I am quite satisfied that the sensitive is suffering from a hallucina
tion. If the circumstances she related to me, and which she now
confirms in conversation and by letter, ever occurred at all, it was
not in the S.P.R. rooms.
At painful cost I have now learnt that mediums of great sensi
bility are liable to impressions of the most varied kind from
incarnate as well as discarnate spirits. Their organisms are like
the wax barrel of a phonograph, and they are specially prone to
become the subjects of hallucinations. They are never normal, and,
I expect, the more sensitive the medium the greater is the danger.
I beg to unreservedly withdraw my accusation against the conduct
of a seance at the S.P.R. rooms on the ground of smoking, and
to express my belief that the sensitive was treated with all consider
ation. I am sure that no attempt was made to obscure the
operation of her gift, and I wish to express my regret for any
annoyance which I may have, inadvertently, caused to the lady
and gentleman who were present.—I am, Sir, yours faithfully,

Southsea, Slst January, 1906. Rear Admiral.
To the Editor of Light.
208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1906.
We should like to express our appreciation of Admiral
Moore's honourable aud straightforward conduct in withdraw
ing unreservedly charges which he was led to make through
zeal on behalf of a lady whom he believed to have been
ill-treated. We hope, however, that in future any members
who may have complaints to make as to our treatment or
alleged treatment of mediums will bring them direct to the
responsible officials of the Society, who, if any indiscreet action
has been committed, will be, we think, no less ready than
Admiral Moore to acknowledge it.
NOTE ON A CASE OF AMNESIA.
THE case of loss of memory mentioned a short time ago in the
newspapers, when a lady had left her home and wandered
about for four months till she was taken up by the police
in a state of destitution, and kept till she could be restored
to her friends, recalls especially in one particular similar cases
recorded in our Proceedings. The real name of the lady was
Grace Bowyer. Her linen was marked " G. B," and, " after
much persuasion," she gave her name, in reply to the police,
as " G. Berill," and in reply to a further question " solemnly
remarked that ' G. stood for g ' " (Daily Chronicle, October,
llth, 1905). In the same way Ansel Bourne in his secondary
condition called himself by a fictitious name, which corre
sponded to his real initials, viz., A. J. Brown, expanded into
Albert John Brown under cross-examination during hypnosis
•(see Proceedings, Vol. VII., p. 233) ; and Dr. Wilson's patient,
" Mary Barnes," called herself " Mlariau Bearnet " (Proceedings,

In the case of Miss Bowyer, the invented name may, of
course, have been merely suggested by the sight, of the initials
on her linen, and not by a faint partial recollection of the
real name, which may have been as completely forgotten as
apparently the rest of her previous life was.

GENERAL MEETING.
THE 127th General Meeting of the Society was held in the
large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Friday,
January 26th, 1906, at 4 p.m., when a paper was read by
Professor W. F. Barrett on " Some Objects and Methods of
Work in Psychical Eesearch." The chair was taken by Mrs.
Sidgwick.
MRS. SIDGWICK, before calling on Professor Barrett to read
his paper, announced to the meeting that Mr. G. W.
Balfour had been elected President for the current year, and
referred briefly to the irreparable loss suffered by the Society
through the sudden death of Dr. Richard Hodgson towards
the end of the previous month, saying also that memorial
articles about him would be, it was hoped, included in the
next Part of Proceedings.
PROFESSOR W. F. BARUETT, F.R.S., after expressing the
pleasure which he thought would be universally felt by
members of the Society at Mr. Balfour's acceptance of the
Presidency, spoke to the following effect :
In the sudden death of Dr. Hodgson we have lost one of
our ablest and most courageous of fellow-workers, and the
loss to the American Branch of our Society is almost
irreparable. It is now many years ago since Dr. Hodgson
joined our ranks and decided to devote his life, as far as
possible, to the problems of psychical research. In 1884, as
one of the Committee appointed by the Council to investigate
phenomena connected with the Theosophical Society, he went
to India to study these alleged phenomena on the spot We
A 2
214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.
all know the conclusive and pitiless exposure of Madam
Blavatzky's claims to supernormal power which resulted.
After his appointment as Secretary to the American Society
for Psychical Research in 1887, much of his time was spent
in the investigation of Mrs. Piper, and whether or not hia
final conclusions in this case be accepted, we must all
acknowledge that he has placed the evidence on behalf of the
existence of discarnate intelligence, and the continuance of
human life beyond the present, and within the veil, on more
stringent experimental grounds than it possessed before.
But all of us have not the gifts of Dr. Hodgson nor the
opportunity to investigate so excellent a medium as Mrs.
Piper, and yet there are very many members of the Society
anxious to aid in its work if they only knew how. It is for
the purpose of trying to show a few ways in which the co
operation of our members is possible, and will be most helpful
to the Society, that I propose to speak this afternoon on
" Some Objects and Methods of Psychical Kesearch," open to
us all. After all, these objects are only those which led to the
foundation of the Society, and the methods are those which
have guided us from our earliest experiments. I may give you
an illustration of what can be done by some of our members
in the way of experiments in thought-transference.
One of our members, whose name I am permitted to mention,
Miss Miles, is possessed of remarkable powers as a dowser
or water-finder. In testing her faculty I was led to try some
experiments on how she detected underground water, and the
evidence pointed clearly to something analogous to clairvoyance
on her part. She found twice right out of three times a coin
I had hidden when she was not present, and the position of
which she could not have found by ordinary sense cognition.
Recently, at the suggestion of one of her friends, she agreed
to make a series of experiments in thought-transference at a
distance. [A full account of these is printed below, see
p. 223.]
I hope the experiments will be continued, reversing the
r61e of agent and percipient, and, further, with the following
precautions, which perhaps some present will note if they
intend to carry on similar experiments :
(1) The subject thought of should be something that has
MARCH, 1906. General Meeting. 215
strongly, though it may be casually, impressed itself on the
agent's mind during the day.
(2) When selected it should be noted and the note or an
exact copy of it should be at once posted to the Secretary
S. P. R., or some third person.
(3) The percipient should likewise write down his impression
at once and send the note or an exact copy of it to the same
third person. Post-cards or letter-cards may advantageously be
used for these notes, as the post-marks would then afford
attestation of the dates.
But the essence of the experiment is not to try to guess.
If you do you will fail. For in that case reason will come
in, and the impression will probably be what seems reasonable,
but may not be correct.
Wait quietly and see if anything floats into your mind.
How to excite the brain to some conscious act of speech or
writing must be a very difficult problem for the subliminal
self to carry out. No doubt some automatic motion would
more easily express the inchoate impression made. Planchette,
or automatic writing with a pencil loosely held, or a forked
twig (as I shall explain directly) are far more likely to lead
to success. Even emotional disturbances, such as grief, joy,
pain, pallor or blushing, would probably interpret the sub
conscious impression more easily if we could arrange a code.
Then further, note that whilst the impression is doubtless
transmitted instantly, the manifestation of the impression on
the part of the recipient may remain latent for a time or
develop gradually.
Professor Barrett then drew attention to the use of the forked
dowsing rod as an autoscope, or means whereby the subliminal
self can express itself, and showed the method of its use.
MRS. SIDGWICK said she thought it desirable for experiments
to be tried as widely as possible, and hoped that many mem
bers of the Society would follow the advice and suggestions
that had just been made by Professor Barrett. Even if the
experiments were not successful, they might often throw side
lights on the topics dealt with, and prove instructive in unex
pected ways. We had reason to think that thought-transference
was most likely to be effected through some subconscious process,
such as automatic writing, and members who wished to know
216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.
how best to set about these experiments would find abundant
instruction in the articles in the Proceedings dealing with them,
or might apply to the Secretaries of the Society for advice.
MK. J. G. PIDDINGTON said that no one could endorse Pro
fessor Barrett's appeal to members to undertake experiments
more heartily than himself. He would, however, like to warn
intending experimenters against experimenting too often or too
long a time at one stretch. Too frequent or too lengthy
experimentation was sure to produce boredom, and boredom
would lead to failure, or might even lead, as Professor
Barrett suggested had happened in one instance in the
Creery case, to graver results than mere failure. Cards and
numbers,—though convenient subjects for experiments in
thought - transference, because the chances of merely
accidental success could be easily calculated,—were open to the
objection that they soon became monotonous and created
that sense of boredom which he thought inimical to success.
Professor Barrett had suggested as suitable subjects for trans
ference, incidents or thoughts which might have casually struck
the agent during the day. He thought this suggestion a good
one, provided that care was taken not to fix on some matter
of obvious general interest (such as, for instance, the General
Election would have been during the preceding week) which,
in the event of the percipient's impression proving correct, could
be too easily attributed to mere guessing.
At the close of the meeting Professor Barrett exhibited to
the audience a number of dowsing rods of different kinds,
which had kindly been sent for the purpose by three well-
known dowsers, Messrs. H. W. Mullins, W. Stone, and J. F.
Young, and demonstrated the manner in which they were held
and the movements produced in them by the subconscious and
involuntary muscular action of the dowsers,—movements
which, as he explained, it is by no means easy exactly to
reproduce by voluntary conscious effort.
[Professor Barrett writes that he desires to add the following
note to the report of the meeting :]
May I add a word, parenthetically, here, to say that at the
moment I misunderstood Mr. Piddington's remark in reference to
some of the early experiments on thought-transference, and I am
afraid my curt interruption may have led some of the audience
MARCH, 1906. General Meeting. 217
to think Mr. Piddington was making an attack, either upon
me, or on the validity of the evidence I had adduced. This,
of course, was not his intention, and I am anxious to take
this opportunity of correcting such an erroneous impression,
if it exists.
BEPOET OF THE COUNCIL FOE THE YEAE 1905.
IT is satisfactory to note that the total increase in member
ship has been larger than usual this year. During the
year 22 new Members were elected, and two Associates
became Members; also 105 new Associates were elected and
nine Members became Associates. On the other hand, the
total loss in number from various causes was 28 Members
and 65 Associates, leaving a net increase of 45, whereas for
the two previous years the net increase had been 40 per
annum. The total membership of the Society has now reached
902, the numbers being distributed as follows: Members 249
(including 3 1 Honorary and Corresponding Members) ; Asso
ciates 653 (including 12 Honorary Associates). The American
Branch has also increased from 569 to 604 Members and
Associates.
Miss V. Larminie, who had been Assistant Secretary since
October, 1903, resigned her post on account of ill-health at
the end of June. A temporary appointment was made for the
next three months, after which Miss I. Newton, who had
worked in the office since November, 1903, as Junior
Assistant, was promoted to be Assistant Secretary, and Miss
C. Bourne was appointed Junior Assistant.
The Library Catalogue, which had long been in preparation,
has been completed, printed, and issued this year, and Members
who use the Library have found it of great help in referring
to and especially in selecting books.
Three General Meetings and three Private Meetings of the
Society (for Members and Associates only) were held during
the year. The dates and the papers were as follows :
*February 6th. " Presidential Address," by Professor Charles
Eichet.
March 27th. "Some Normal Extensions and Intensifications
of Conscious Perception," by Mr. Sydney Olivier.
*ThoBe marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.
218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1906.
*May llth. "De quelques Observations de Clairvoyance,"
by Professor Charles Richet.
June 29th. " Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival
of 1904," by the Rev. A. T. Fryer.
October 27th. "The Haunted Solicitor: an Unfinished
Comedy," by the Hon. Everard Feilding, and " A
Brief Statement concerning Recent Experiences in
France," by Sir Oliver Lodge.
*December llth. "On the Scientific Attitude to Marvels,"
by Sir Oliver Lodge.
Among the investigations and experiments carried on during
the year we may mention :
(1) Mr. Fryer's prolonged and systematic enquiry into
various phenomena of psychical or psychological interest
connected with the Welsh Revival of 1904-5. This was
conducted mainly by correspondence with many different
persons in the various districts of Wales into which the
Revival spread,—supplemented, whenever possible, by a personal
examination of the witnesses of or participants in the
phenomena. The results of the enquiry have been published
in Part LI. of the Proceedings.
(2) In the Easter vacation, Mr. Feilding visited a number
of mediums, private and professional, in the north of England.
The results obtained with one of them, who produced move
ments and levitations of a table, were sufficiently encouraging
in Mr. Feilding's judgment to warrant further enquiry, and
Mr. Baggally, who had a sitting with the same medium in
June, was also favourably impressed. The conditions were so
imperfect and observation was so difficult that the movements
produced could by no means be considered conclusive of
supernormal agency, but they were certainly suggestive of it ;
and it is hoped that further investigations may shortly be
made.
(3) During the summer vacation, Mr. Feilding attended over
twenty sittings in a Continental town in hopes of witnessing
certain remarkable manifestations on which a report had been
received from an Hon. Associate of the Society. The most
important part of this investigation formed the subject of his
* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.
MABOH, 1906. Report of the Council. 219
paper to the Society on October 27th, and a summary of it
was printed in the Journal for December.
(4) Early in the year a number of " apports " alleged to
have been supernormally produced at the sittings of the
Australian medium, Mr. C. Bailey, were sent over to us by
Dr. MacCarthy of Sydney, who had been in charge of the
sittings. They consisted of coins and clay tablets, which we
were requested to submit to experts in England for an
•opinion as to whether they were what the medium stated
them to be, viz. genuine ancient Egyptian, Hindoo, and other
•coins, and Babylonian or Assyrian tablets. The experts at
the British Museum reported that the coins were genuine,
but not of any value or rarity, and the tablets all forgeries,
of types well known to them. The report, together with a
full account of the circumstances under which the " apports "
were produced, was printed in the Journal for May ; a report
of other sittings with the same medium by one of our
Australian members, Mr. A. W. Dobbie, appeared in the
Journal for July.
(5) A series of seven sittings was held at the Rooms
with the medium Mr. A. V. Peters, of whom we had
received favourable reports from several members of the
Society. There were seven different sitters, all belonging to
the Society, each of whom came to one sitting, all arrange
ments being made by the Secretary, who took full notes of
what happened. The results were unfortunately inconclusive,
the correct statements made by the medium not being
sufficiently definite or sufficiently numerous to point clearly
to any agency beyond conscious or unconscious guessing or
chance coincidence. The Council desire, however, to express
to Mr. Peters their appreciation of the trouble he took in
coming and of his readiness to submit to any test or
suggestion that was made.
(6) A large number of sittings and experiments with
members of the Society and others were also held at the
Rooms in the course of the year, with results too inconclusive
to be worth reporting in detail. Some of these were hypnotic
experiments by Mr. Feilding, designed to test the power of
resistance to suggestion possessed by susceptible hypnotic
.subjects. He hopes to carry these experiments further. We
220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MABCH, 1906.
were also afforded by personal friends several opportunities of
assisting at some very instructive experiments in self-induced
trance, in which " controls " of a pseudo-spiritistic character
appeared. We use the word " pseudo-spiritistic," because,
though the manifestations presented a complete analogy to
the " controls " which are often assumed to be due to spirit
possession,—the personifications being of a highly realistic and
dramatic, or indeed melodramatic kind,—there was nothing in
the trance utterances that afforded any ground for supposing
that they originated elsewhere than in the subliminal con
sciousness of the mediums; nor indeed did the mediums
themselves regard them as having any other origin.
(7) In the middle of December, four sittings were held
with the " materialising " medium Mr. Chambers. At the
first two sittings " forms " appeared at the opening of, or just
outside, the cabinet, which, inasmuch as they declined to
permit any examination either of themselves or of the medium,
there was no reason to suppose were other than Mr.
Chambers himself, draped or holding up a piece of white
drapery. At the third sitting, the medium at his own
suggestion was tied into an armchair and objects were placed
near him, which he alleged would probably float in the air
untouched by any one. No movements of the objects took
place. At the fourth sitting, the medium again went inta
the cabinet and " forms " were seen. Some of these were
seen through an opening in the curtain, when withdrawn by
the medium, to be produced by Mr. Chambers sitting in his
chair and holding up a piece of drapery on one arm. In
the case of one form, purporting to be that of a woman,
which came out into the room, the trousers of the medium
were seen in the hinder part of the form. At the end of
the sitting Mr. Chambers was informed of what had been
observed, and, on his denying that he had taken any part
in producing the phenomena, was asked to allow himself to
be searched in order to prove that the drapery, false beard,
etc., which had been seen, were not concealed on his person.
He refused to allow any search whatever to be made. [A
fuller report of these sittings has appeared in the February
Journal.]
(8) It gives us special pleasure to be able to report, after
MARCH, 1906. Report of the Council. 221
a long dearth of successful experiments in telepathy, that
some members of the Society have turqed their attention to-
this important subject, with encouraging results. We have
recently received reports from two of our members, Miss
Miles and Miss Eamsden, of some successful experiments of
their own in thought-transference. The experimenters were
living at a distance of about twenty miles from one another,
and each of them recorded at the time, before hearing from
the other, the idea to be conveyed or the impression received.
The full account is printed in the present Journal. An
American member also has sent us an admirably recorded
series of experiments of the same kind, which—though incon
clusive at present—appear to us decidedly promising.
The general progress of interest in the subject of psychical
research which has marked the last few years seems to con
tinue unabated. This year a local Society has been started
at Oxford, from which much may be hoped. On March llth
a drawing-room meeting was held there with a view to
testing the feeling of residents. A Committee was afterwards
formed to collect information and stimulate interest, and this
Committee arranged for a public meeting in the Hall of
Hertford College on November 13th. Sir Oliver Lodge then
delivered an address to a large audience, the pressure for
entrance being so great that numbers failed to gain admission.
We mentioned in our report last year that Mr. Myers's
Human Personality (Vol. I., Chaps. 1-4) bad been included
among the books recommended on the subject of Metaphysics
in the Fellowship Course of Trinity College, Dublin, for
1905. This year we have been informed that the University
of Madras had already adopted Human Personality as a text
book to be read for the M.A. two years' course in Psychology,
and an examination paper set on the book in the M.A.
Degree Examination of January, 1905, was sent to us.
It is highly appropriate that the subject should be introduced
first into the most advanced University courses for older
students only, for it has certainly not yet reached a stage
in which much of it can be formulated in a manner suffi
ciently definite and dogmatic to be profitably taught to the
junior members of a University.
The knowledge attained so far is of a purely empirical
222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MABCH, 1906.
kind ; we can only observe and investigate the facts or
phenomena that we are fortunate enough to meet with ; we
cannot yet produce them to order, and consequently cannot
undertake to demonstrate them experimentally. We can only
keep on the look-out for them, and neglect no opportunity
of observing, recording, and as far as possible investigating,
any case that comes under our notice.
Members of the Society often express a desire to take
part in experiments or investigations, or enquire what they
can do to help on the work. A leaflet issued by the Council
three years ago, and still in constant use, indicates various
lines of enquiry, with brief suggestions for following each,
viz.: automatic phenomena, experimental telepathy, spontaneous
telepathy, communications from the dead, and the so-called
" physical phenomena " of spiritualism. More detailed sug
gestions,—especially in relation to the first two topics, which
are obviously those to which our efforts should be first
directed,—will be given in Professor Barrett's address to-day
[an abstract of which appears in the present Journal].
We would suggest to our members that those who have
•opportunities should form small groups among their own friends
for trying experiments together. They will probably find one
or two who exhibit the simpler automatic phenomena ; it will
be desirable to note how far these follow the ordinary types
.(as described in articles in our Proceedings, and especially in
Mr. Myers's Human Personality), or whether in any respect
they depart from them. Any indications of telepathy or
supernormal acquisition of knowledge should be noted, and
the conditions scrupulously recorded at the time of occurrence.
Though careful records should always be kept, these need not
be in great detail, except in the case of significant incidents.
It is desirable for the experimenters to begin by gaining
some practical experience of the simpler and more usual
types, and meanwhile to make themselves acquainted with
what has been already done by expert investigators. The
officials of the Society would be very glad to receive reports
from any group of workers or to advise them in the conduct
of their experiments. The work of such groups would offer
us the best chance of discovering individuals possessed of
unusual psychic faculties, through whose co-operation alone
MARCH, 1906. Report of the Council. 223
will it ever be possible to advance our knowledge of the
subject.
We cannot close this brief chronicle of the year's events
without referring to the grievous loss and sudden blow which
fell upon the Society by the death of Dr. Richard Hodgson
on December 20th; but the services which he rendered to
Psychical Research cannot be summed up in a few brief
paragraphs, and a fitting tribute to his life and work must
be reserved for the pages of the Proceedings.
EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.
WE have often urged on our members the desirability of
trying experiments in thought-transference with any of their
friends who may show indications of the telepathic faculty,
so that further evidence may be obtained in confirmation of
the large number of successful results published by the Society,
especially during the first ten years of its existence ; but
these appeals have not latterly met with much response.
We are therefore very glad to be able to print now a series
•of experiments between two of our members, Miss Hermione
Ramsden and Miss Clarisse Miles, which we hope may
encourage others to try for themselves. Miss Ramsden having
met with a certain amount of success with two other friends
of hers, asked Miss Miles to try a systematic series with her.
It was arranged that Miss Miles, living at 59 Egerton Gardens,
London, S.W., should play the part of agent, while Miss
Ramsden, at her home Bulstrode, Gerrard's Cross, Bucking
ham (about 20 miles from London), acted as percipient, the
times of the experiments being fixed by pre-arrangement.
Miss Miles noted at the time of each experiment, in a
book kept for the purpose, the idea or image which she wished
to convey, while Miss Ramsden wrote down each day the
impressions that had come into her mind, and sent the record
to Miss Miles before knowing what she had attempted on
her side. Miss Miles then pasted this record into her book
opposite her own notes, and in some cases added a further
note explanatory of her circumstances at the time, to which
it will be seen that Miss Ramsden's impressions often corre
sponded. Whenever it was possible, Miss Miles obtained
224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAKCH, 1906.
confirmatory evidence from other persons as to the circumstances
that had not been noted at the time, and the corroboration of
these persons was written in her book and is printed below.
All the original records of these experiments are at present
in our possession.
In the printed account, we give in the case of each experi
ment (a) the note made at the time by the agent, Miss
Miles ; (b) the note made at the time by the percipient, Miss
Eatnsden ; (c) the subsequent comments, if any, made by Miss
Miles ; (d) the corroborations, if any, of Miss Miles's friends ;
(e) the subsequent comments, if any, made by Miss Ramsden.
Any omissions in the printed copy of the records are
indicated in the usual manner by omission marks. . . . Almost
all the record is printed in full, so that the reader may be
able to judge of the proportions of failure and success. The
names of the persons concerned are given, except in the
case of Experiment IX.
EXPERIMENT I.
(a) October 18th, 1905. 7 p.m.
SPHINX.
I sat with my feet on the fender, I thought of Sphinx, I tried
to visualize it. Spoke the word out loud. I could only picture it
to myself quite small as seen from a distance.
(b) Wednesday, October 18th, 1905. 7 p.m.
Bulstrode, Gerrard's Cross, Bucks.
I could not visualize, but seemed to feel that you were sitting
with your feet on the fender in an arm-chair, in a loose black sort
of tea-gown. The following words occurred to me :
Peter Evan or 'Eaven (Heaven).
Hour-glass (this seemed the chief idea).
Worcester deal box.
Daisy Millar.
1 x arm socket or some word like it.
x suspension bridge.
x Sophia Ridley.
x soupirer (in French), which I felt inclined to spell souspirer.
There is some word with the letter S. I don't seem quite to
have caught it.
1 The crosses indicate those impressions which Miss Ramsden marked at the
time as being especially vivid.—EDITOR.
MARCH, 1906. Experiments in Thought-Transference. 225
(e) I had been trying experiments with two other friends ever
since September 7th. These were only partially successful. I never
got the actual message intended, except on one occasion, when the
subject was one of which we had both been thinking. My im
pressions were auditory.—H. R.
EXPERIMENT II.
(a) Friday, October 20th, 1905.
SPHINX.
I tried to visualize Sphinx again.
(b) Friday, October 20th, 1905. 7 p.m.
I received a letter from Miss Miles, saying, " Letter S quite
correct, the hour-glass shape extraordinarily correct, also S S at
the end or something like it. I shall try again to-morrow at seven.
It will come all right.—C. M."
After this I found it very difficult not to try and guess the word
instead of making my mind a blank.
Cossack.
Cross.
Compass (?)
Luzac (the publisher).
Luxor in Egypt.
Here I gave up in despair, then suddenly came the word :
Whistle ! This I believed to be correct.
EXPERIMENT III.
(a) Saturday, October 21st, 1905. 7 p.m.
LAMP.
I sat before the fire in my sitting-room and visualized a lamp.
One of those very old-fashioned lamps with a large globe, which
seemed to me to be a round ball of fire.
(b) Saturday, Oct. 21st, 1905.
Scissors, x orangery, shaloop ?, shawl, jalousie (blinds), fretwork or
sort of trellis in a garden, e'chantillon (pattern), sleepers, x gum
plant or pot?, vermisimilitude, Paternoster, tabloids, x orangery,
X orange flower, x orange pips, horsewhip, housewife (needlecase),
verdigris, purple hedgerow, beech, beatitudes, tea cosy, Burnham
Beeches, heather in flower, crown, small box, short deal 1, infanticide,
x maltese oranges growing in a pot, Chinese slippers, x Cape goose
berries, these look like oranges.
The most probable seems to be a small Maltese orange tree, such
.as I have seen in London houses.

EXPERIMENT IV.
(a) Sunday, October 22nd.
I never tried to visualize anything at all. About 6 o'clock to
7.30 I was writing letters to friends. One I was pondering over,
for it required an answer. It was from a Polish artist who had
come from Munich to finish Mrs. Jack Tennant's picture.
(b) Letter dated Wednesday, October 25th.
On Sunday night [Oct. 22nd] I felt that you were not thinking
of me, but were reading a letter in a sort of half German writing.
The letters had very long tails to them. Letter

(a) Tuesday, October 24th, 1905.
DOG—CHOW.
[Miss Bamsden had a large number of impressions, all incorrect]
EXPERIMENT VI.
(a) October 25th. CLOCK.
(b) Wednesday, Oct. 25th. 7 to 7.30 p.m.
Fig, locket; I visualized a locket on a chain, bath (oval shape),
piano, guitar, musical instrument, x locket with somebody's hair,
" Malthusiau," VW pattern visualized, x oval frame for a picture.
The frame has little lumps round it, might be a gilt picture
frame or a locket with diamonds or stones of some sort, but they
do not seem to shine. It might be a small miniature frame. It has
got nothing inside yet and you are wondering what you will put
in. There is glass, and it is slightly concave. It might be a
small hand looking-glass, but quite small.
(c) At 7 p.m. I visualized a clock, or rather tried to. It was
very difficult, as I had had a model and had been drawing him
from five o'clock to six forty-five. The model was Mr. Macnab.
I was going to begin painting him life-size, and before settling on
the pose I was making two or three quick sketches of him by
electric light. I also put the stretcher up against him without the

obviously foreign hand, corresponding with the description by Miss Bamsden.

canvas to see how much I would paint of him when the canvas
was stretched. He has a very thin face, which would look like a
distinct oval. The face I always leave blank and only fill in the
dress and hair with pencil. In the morning I arranged lockets,
jewelry, and silver things.

in life size for this picture. She made two or three quick sketches

determined in future that I would try and visualize, although I
had never done so before, and am unable to sec in a crystal.
Miss Miles is a very good visualizer and psychometrist. She has
often held letters for me and described scenes in connection with
the life of the writer.

EXPERIMENT VII.
(a) October 27th. SPECTACLES.
(b) Friday, Oct. 27th. 7 p.m.
" Spectacles."
This was the only idea that came to me after waiting a long
time. I thought of " sense perception," but that only confirms the
above. My mind was such a complete blank that I fell asleep and
dreamt a foolish dream (but not about you). At 7.25 I woke
with a start
(c) Having found that it was much easier to impress an idea upon
the recipient when it was something that I had seen and thought
of later in the day, I determined that in future I would make my
choice accordingly, and think of some object in connection with
Miss Ramsden without specially sitting down to do so at 7 p.m.
On October 27th I attended the meeting of the S.P.R, at 20 Hanover
Square. I sat between Miss Lily Antrobus and Mr. Douglas
Murray. The latter had a curious pair of spectacles which attracted
my attention, made of two different glasses. These I fixed on as
the subject.
(d) Dec. 20th, 1905. Runnymede Park, Egham.
Dear Miss Miles,—This is just to tell you that I sat next
you at the S.P.R. meeting on Oct. 27th, 1905, when Mr.
Everard Feilding and Sir Oliver Lodge read papers, and that I

the lower for reading.

(<) I did not visualize the spectacles, the word came to me as
a sudden idea.
EXPERIMENT VIII.
(a) October 31st, 1905. SUNSET OVER ORATORY.
(b) Tuesday, Oct. 31st, 1905. 7 p.m.
First it was the sun with rays and a face peering out of the rays.
Then something went round and round like a wheel. Then the
two seemed to belong together, and I thought of windmill. A
windmill on a hill where it was dark and windy and there were
dark clouds. Then it became the Crucifixion, and I saw the three
crosses on the left side of the hill, and the face on the cross looked
to the right, and it was dark. Wind and storm.
Surely this is right. It is the most vivid impression I have
ever had. I scarcely visualized at all, it was just the faintest indica
tion possible, but the suggestion was most vivid.
(c) I was painting Mr. Macnab, and there was a beautiful sunset
over the Oratory. Mr. Macnab, who was so seated that he could
watch it better than I could, walked to the window and drew my
attention to it. His face became illuminated with the rays of the sun.
It was a very windy, stormy evening, with weird orange lights in
the sky. The sun sets to the left of the Oratory. From my window
I see the central figure, and two sorts of uprights which look like
figures in the dim twilight. These three objects show out dark
against the sky to the left of the dome, on which there is a gold
cross. All this I visualized the whole evening for Miss Ramsden
to see. At first I could not account for the windmill. I discovered
a weathercock in the distance, on the top of a building.
[A photograph of the Brompton Oratory, taken by Miss Miles
from the window of her studio, is reproduced here.]
(d) There was a most lovely sunset all over the Oratory, and to
which I drew Miss Miles's attention.

7 King Edward Street, Islington, N.
(«) Hitherto we had settled that Miss Miles was to make me
think of a definite object, and I sat down as usual with my eyes
shut, expecting to get a single idea like "spectacles." I was very
much surprised to see this vision, and believed it was a picture of
MARCH, 1906. Experiments in Thought-Transference. 229
the Crucifixion which she was trying to make me see. I looked
for the women watching at the foot of the cross, and was surprised
that I could not see them. This is curious, because I distinctly
saw a figure on the cross, which was purely the result of my own
imagination. The rays of the sun and the cross itself appeared for
an instant to be luminous. I cannot exactly say how I saw the rest,
but it was the most vivid impression of the kind that I ever had
in my life.

sister-in-law. E V L Evelyn? or "Evelina," which is the name of

did not know the Christian name of her sister-in-law. Lady

on a visit of a few days to Miss Miles, and found her talking

letters in another room, where, later on, Miss Miles joined me. I
soon drew her attention to the time, and said: "It's nearly seven
o'clock ; I advise you to think of for the telepathic
message to my daughter, as your head must be full of your con
versation with her, and it will be impossible for you to concentrate
your mind on any other subject."

OBITUAEY.
DE. SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY.
IT is with great regret that we record the death of a dis
tinguished Vice-President of our Society, Dr. S. P. Langley,
Secretary and Director of the Smithsonian Institution and
Keeper of the U.S. National Museum. Dr. Langley was
known to the scientific world as an eminent astronomer and
physicist, who invented the bolometer, founded the system of
railway time service from observatories, and devoted much
time to the problems of aerodynamics. He became one of
our Corresponding Members in 1889, and on the completion
of the arrangements whereby the American Society for
Psychical Research was transformed into a Branch of our own
Society, he was elected a Vice-President. In this capacity,
together with Professor William James and Professor Bowditch,
he acted in America as a representative of the parent Society,
and consented at the same time to form, with Professor
James, an Advisory Committee, imder which the work of the
Secretary and Treasurer of the Branch was conducted. Though
probably unknown personally to the bulk of our members, Dr.
Langley left on those of us who met him at Cambridge
during the sittings with Eusapia Paladino in 1895 the
impression of a genial, attractive and single-minded character.

DISCUSSION OF MME. X.'S GEEEK SCRIPT.
BY THE REV. M. A. BAYFIELD.
THE purpose of this note is to draw attention to certain
characteristics of Mme. X.'s script which seem to me to make
very strongly for the genuineness of the phenomenon, whatever
be the explanation of it. The conclusions to which I have
been led are based on a protracted examination (with the aid
of a magnifying glass) of the original writings of all the pieces
published in the last issue of the Proceedings, i.e. of the whole
of the script, except Nos. i to vii, which appear not to have
reached this country. Their absence, however, can hardly
affect the argument.
(1) Ex hypothesi fraudis, Mme. X. must have learned the
Greek alphabet, i.e. the sound-values of the various symbols,
since it is altogether incredible that she could have learned
what she wrote as a mere sequence of pictures. On the other
hand, if she knew the sounds of the letters, it would be no
great feat to commit to memory, from time to time, so much
as she wished to write out in Prof. Richet's presence. She
would also, I think, give herself at least some little practice
in Greek writing. This latter assumption, however, may be
waived, if any one objects to it, and we will say that the
first time Mme. X. wrote Greek was on Nov. 7, 1899.
Now, the thing which, upon examination of the script,.
234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research APRIL, 1906.
absolutely saute aux yeux is that it seems to the very last to
be the writing of a beginner. This was of course noticed
by Mrs. Verrall, who remarks on the significance of the fact
(Proceedings, Part LI., p. 227). Not only can I confirm what
Mrs. Verrall writes, but I can go further. The magnifying
glass shows that almost every individual letter from beginning
to end of the script (and not excepting viii D) has the
appearance of having been written by one who is tracing Greek
characters for the first time. Perhaps the x for K, and some
of the x's are the only exceptions. There is continued un-
•certainty of touch, and there is no development of a personal
script. But any one who sets himself for the first time to
copy Greek type will unconsciously begin to develop a hand
writing of his own before he has written half a dozen lines.
Mrs. Verrall detected this in the 19 words written for Sir
Oliver Lodge by Mr. Briscoe (Proceedings, Part LI., p. 223).
Two ladies, ignorant of the Greek alphabet, have copied for me
the opening lines of the Phoenissae from Valcknaer's edn., 1802,
the type of which is very like that of Byzantios' Lexicon.
One copied 14 lines, the other 20. Of course I gave them
no hint of the phenomenon I expected their script to exhibit,
but each at once began to develop a characteristic script,
suggestive of her ordinary handwriting. What seemed to be
the essential characteristics of the letters were rapidly recognised,
and the copyists were satisfied if they reproduced these, while
neglecting what appeared to be mere ornamentations or trim
mings—the differentiae of the type. 7 is made without taking
the pen off; i has no curl at the bottom, or very little; v
is made like a sharp-bottomed v, with both lines straight or
•else curving outwards. The text gives two kinds of p, one
with a straight, and one with a curled tail ; both copyists
make the former like a p, the straight stroke projecting above
the loop. In the T of the text the upright stroke has a distinct
knob on its right side at the bottom (the lexicon tau has,
I believe, a tiny curl), and the cross-stroke curves downwards
•on the left. Both copyists make the upright quite plain,
and only one attempts to reproduce the curve of the cross-
stroke, w is boldly made throughout like a w, save that, on
the first appearance of the letter, one lady makes an honest
attempt to copy the type, curling both horns well in, as Mme. X.
APRIL, 1906. Discussion of Mme. X.'s Greek Script. 235
always does. Both write throughout with a firm hand, even when
making the letters badly. Similar inevitable characteristics of a
consciously written script will, I have no sort of doubt, be found in
every case in which the experiment is made.
Now let us compare Mme. X.'s script. There is, as has been
already said, no advance in the formation of a personal handwrit
ing. Her latest script is as lacking in individuality and distinction
as her earliest. Her touch is never firm, but always uncertain.
Even viii D is no exception ; the script is smaller and more
regular, but the letters, as seen under the magnifying glass, are as
plainly wanting in the characteristics of a consciously written
script as are the other pieces. Mme. X. reproduces three different
kinds of Greek type ; but in copying each she is apparently
as careful to reproduce the differentiae as the essentials. Her
latest production, Nos. 1 to 12, is not icritten, but drawn, as by
one copying conscientiously the features of an ornamental design.
Indeed, in these last pieces so much attention has been paid
to the accidental, and so little to the essential features of the
letters r and i, that we have a most remarkable result. Out
of 49 iotas some 17—more than one third—are almost upsilons,
while nearly all are curled up too much ; and out of 42
taus all but 3 are simply an English J reversed. The three
exceptions are made with a straight downstroke and a practically
plain cross-stroke, and it is worthy of remark that they all occur
in No. 1, the first piece of the set. It would seem that at
first the curl at the bottom of the downstroke had not been
observed ; but when once it has been noticed, it becomes liable
to exaggeration, as had been the case in Nos. ix to xv. In
Nos. viii A-D this exaggeration of the curl of the T is rare.
Thus we see that here again Mine. X. acts in a way diamet
rically opposite to that of the conscious copyist ; she ex
aggerates, and exaggerates increasingly, just that merely orna
mental feature of the letter which the conscious copyist would
tend to curtail, or more probably would not reproduce at all.
It may be objected that this careful imitation of the printed
type was intentional, Mme. X. hoping thereby to convey a
stronger impression of unfamiliarity with Greek. But the script
purported from the very beginning (Nov. 1899) to be controlled
by Antoine Eenouard, who might surely be supposed to have
a script of his own. Moreover, the last stupidity of which
A 2
236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APBIL, im
a fraudulent Mine. X. would be guilty is the suggestion that
she was copying from a printed book. While planning her
fraud, she searches high and low for a convenient book, and
as she does so, cannot help discovering that there is a variety
of Greek types. She finally settles on the Lexicon of Byzantios,
but has no means of knowing whether the book is common
or not, or that Prof. Eichet does not actually possess a copy.
She then takes pains to conform her writing as far as possible
to the two different kinds of type found in the lexicon.1 She
knows that she will be suspected of copying from a book,
and she takes this step in order to make detection more difficult!
0 sancta simplicitas !
(2) My next point is that, if fraudulent, Mme. X. could
not have made the following blunders, not to mention others.
She knew the Greek alphabet, and after repeated perusals,
had learnt the words by their sounds. The blunders I cite
are cn-oXtcr/ua^y (o-roXto-yuovc), SfuXovs (6fu\ovs), irrj\cnr\a(f>iKijt
(TnyXoTrXao-Ti/riJ?), cnropdSrjv—as I think was intended to be
written (cnropdStjv)—IdoTriSos (IdinriSos), Toii airoxpv(pai> (rov
cnroKpvtpov), Moucre^ow (Moutm'oi/), all in ix B ; TrapoScj) (TrapdSu>)
in x ; VIMV (V/MV), Troika-la (TTO^CTO)), and irurrevtov (iria-reuwv)
in 2. As is clearly shown by the accents on consonants and
the £ for i in Mouo-e^ov, and by irotfjuru), these are visual errors,
and yet they are made after Mme. X. had, as we must suppose,
read the words over many times.
(3) My third point is that Nos. viii A-D, all written by
Mme. X. in private, show many evidences of having been
written by one who does not see what she is writing, and
are in this respect of a piece with the rest of the script. Of
the conditions of the production of ix-xv Prof. Richet says:
" dans un e"tat de demi-conscience, elle prit un stylographe,
et, devant moi, debout sur le balcon, elle 6crivit," etc. . . .
" Mme. X. semblait regarder dans le vide et copier quelque
chose qu'elle voyait devant elle." All this writing is, in con
sequence, exceptionally unsteady. Nos. 1-12, Prof. Richet says,
were written " dans un etat de demi-transe . . . devant moi."
As to the " demi-conscience " and " demi-transe," we may surely
'Mrs. Verrall observes (Proceeding*, S.P.E., Part LI., p. 244) that the type
used in the Dedication of the Lexicon corresponds with that of Mme V-

APRIL, 1906. Discussion of Mme. X.'n Greek Script. 237
trust a professional man of M. Richet's exceptional experience.
He has further assured us that Mme. X. was not copying from
a concealed paper, and of course to attempt this was as un
necessary as it would have been unwise.
The defects one would expect to find in Greek writing done
by a person who does not see his work are, I suppose, these:—
(1) faulty alignment ; (2) faulty spacing of letters, words, and
commas ; (3) faulty joining of portions of letters made by
separate strokes of the pen ; (4) misplacement of accents and
breathings, and the occasional putting of a dot for an accent ;
(5) the coarsening or deforming of a letter by writing over it,
from a doubt whether it has been completed ; (6) uncompleted
letters; (7) inequality in the size of letters.1 All these defects
appear in viii A-D, as in the rest of the script. The following
list is far from complete (see facsimiles), but will, I think, be
found sufficient to bear out my contention.
Evidences of trancc-itrriting in viii A-D.
(1) Faulty alignment.—In A, 1. 5, -nara rrjf : 11. 11-14, passim,
especially fpuOporyTa a-ypixa, TT in irexivia, and xirpiva, re-.

this puzzle) : TT and x of iru\va, 1. 13: TT of atnrpa. To these
may be added several a'e (for a) in which the downstroke
comes below the line, so that the letter is like a badly made
9 ending with an outward curl. In B, 1. 7, T of TI/J: 1. 8,

1. 4, first X of Saarv<pv\\ov : 1. 6, both X's of TroXwouciXa : •%
of xyverat in 1. 11, and of xapiTos in 1. 13. (Mme. X. as
often as not makes x by three strokes ; first a y is made by
two strokes, and the letter is then completed.) The * for K
in B, 1. 6, is almost the plus sign +.
(4) Misplacement of accents and breathings, etc.—In A, 1. 4, E
for 'E in E^ervXi^av. In B, cufi ov for cup' ov. In D, 1. 2, vir
'o-^ftv for vir o^fiv : 1. 6, dot for accent on iroXt/7ro/«Xa. Of
the accentuation in general it may be remarked that Mme. X.
in a very large number of instances throughout the script
substitutes accents for breathings. These substitutions amount
in viii A-D to 30 per cent, of the whole. Now, if
fraudulent, Mme. X. must have learnt the significance of
breathings when she learned the alphabet, and it is very
unlikely that she made the errors in viii unintentionally,
having the book before her. On the other hand, she could
not have imagined that she would have gained anything by
making them intentionally, else why are the breathings and
accents in viii D so extraordinarily correct ? These errors
have all the appearance of being due to imperfect visualisation
in trance.
(5) Coarsening and deforming of letters.—In A, 1. 2, t of
Trpo^fipovf : 1. 6, S of Sa/j.a(rxa : 1. 15, first i of xi-rpiva, and
v of Te\evraiov. In B, 1. 1, v of ov : 1. 2, p of KaTwpOuxraro :
1. 3, x of TroXiTixijv. In C and D none.
(6) Leaving letter 'unfinished.—The only instance I can find
of this is in c, but it is important and interesting. As stated
above, Mme. X. as often as not makes % by first forming a y :
APRIL, ]906. Discussion of Mine. X.'s Greek Script. 239
she begins with the long stroke, and then inclines the short
one to it. In only one of her -y's can I find that this short
stroke curves to the right at the bottom after starting straight
(A, 1. 4). The apparent curve of the y of epya in No. 2 is
merely a thickening caused by a stoppage of the pen. Now, in
the second y of arvyyatprjcriy in c such a curve is distinctly
visible, made as if in preparation for meeting the final stroke
which is to be drawn on the other side of the long stroke, in
order to complete the \. It seems to me, therefore, that this
y is an unfinished x> and thus we have an explanation of the
misspelling which has caused so much perplexity. Compare
the unfinished word irepcurTuio[f] in No. x.
(7) Inequality in the size of letters.—This defect pervades A and
B, but is less frequent in D. There, however, it is more difficult
to detect, owing to the smallness of the writing as a whole.
It may be suggested that Mme. X. purposely wrote viii
with her eyes shut, in order to counterfeit trance-writing.
But if so, why did she write one piece so much better than
the rest ? Moreover, it is highly improbable that any one,
writing consciously and with closed eyes, could produce Greek
script as good as that of viii D.
I hazard no conjecture as to the origin of the remarkable
phenomenon presented by the script. If, however, I were
asked to account for the differences of style shown in the
four pieces of viii, I should suggest that they may well be
due to differences in the writer's psychical condition. The
four pieces have this in common, that none of them shows
that control of the pen which is possessed by a person writing
consciously ; and even D, which is the neatest in form,
gives abundant proof that it was written by a trembling
hand.

BY H. AKTHUR SMITH.
A PERUSAL in Part LI. of our Proceedings of our late President's
address on Xenoglossy, and of the comments based thereon
by Sir 0. Lodge, Mrs. Verrall, and the Hon. E. Feilding
and our Secretary, has so greatly interested me that I am
tempted to devote a spare hour to a record of the impressions
which the argument has made on my mind, impressions
240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.
mainly arising from the reply presented by M. Richet to the
last of the criticisms.
The force of M. Eichet's objection to these criticisms
obviously depends to a large extent upon the soundness of
his repeated insistence on the fact that a production of the
Greek writings in question by an effort of memory dependent
on visualisation is so extremely improbable that it may reason
ably be dismissed from consideration in any attempt to explain
the phenomena before us. Now I would ask in the first
place whether it is to be implicitly accepted that the feat of
memory alleged depends on visualisation alone. We are
informed that the medium wrote Greek ; we are not informed
whether she ever attempted to pronounce it. Let us assume
that her ignorance of Greek was such that she could not
have vocalised it intelligibly. It does not follow that the
power of visualisation could have received no assistance from
an auditory imagination of the sounds suggested. The letters
of the Greek alphabet have such a general resemblance to our
own that though a person ignorant of Greek may and will
pronounce them wrongly, nevertheless he may well associate
with them some sounds which may serve as an assistance to
memory quite as well as the true sounds. Let me illustrate.
I well remember when a child I once took up my father's
Greek Testament, which was opened at the second gospel.
I read the title aloud thus : " Kata Mapkon." It would
convey nothing in sense to a Greek or to myself, but as an
assistance to reproducing the words from memory, it would
serve as well as the true pronunciation. It may be replied
that this experience relates only to capital letters, and that
the cursive letters are less suggestive of our own. This is
to some extent true, but it is not prohibitive. Many of the
small letters are quite close enough to our own to suggest
sounds, though not always accurate sounds, e.g. a, ft, y, S, e,
i, K, v, o, a-, ?, T, v, •%, ft>. Another experience of my own
may illustrate my point as applicable to cursive letters. Soon
after I began to learn Greek, I came across the word veavtas
in an easy exercise. Not yet being quite versed in the alphabet
I pronounced it Feavias. It was unintelligible Greek, but
equally helpful to me as an aid to memory if I was asked
to reproduce the word.
APRIL, 1906. Discussion of Mme. X.'s Greek Script. 241
Perhaps an illustration from another language may be still
more to the point. Some time ago, during a tour in Wales,
I was much struck by the name of a little village in Anglesea.
The village is insignificant enough, but it is surely as well
described as the most ambitious place could desire. The name
runs :
" Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch."
I thought such an imposing verbal procession as this deserved
to be remembered, and in a short time I committed it to
memory so effectively that though some fifteen years have
passed I now reproduce it with perfect confidence that its
accuracy is quite on a par with the Greek quotations in
question. It is of course a descriptive name, but I had not
At the time the remotest, and have now but a very slight,
idea as to what it all means, so my memory has not been in
the least assisted by knowledge of its translation. But my
memory has been assisted—more than that, if I rightly
judge, has mainly been preserved—by an imaginary interpreta
tion of the letters into sounds. I say " imaginary " because
I should be sorry to do so much as attempt to pronounce
it as I once heard a Welsh lady cough it out. I may here
say that though my memory for facts is perhaps as good
as the average, my verbal memory is very imperfect ; so
much so that the feat of learning Virgil's poems by heart,
which Dr. Leaf tells us was accomplished by Mr. Myers,
is far more incomprehensible to me than the feat of playing
twelve games of chess simultaneously blindfold.
Now these examples seem to me to take all point from
the challenge which M. Eichet addresses to Mr. Feilding
and Miss Johnson. The script of the oriental languages is so
remote from ours that whether written or printed, whether
Arabic or Sanscrit, Hindustani or Chinese, they convey no
sort of conception of sound to the uninstructed occidental
mind. To commit their forms to memory would therefore be
a pure effort of visualisation, and may, for aught I know, be
as impossible as M. Richet supposes.
But further, and in conclusion (for my comments are running
to excessive length), does not M. Richet underrate the capacity
of memory, especially memory trained with the assistance of
memoria technics, under such systems as those of Stokes,
242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APBIL, 1906.
Loisette, and others, the astonishing results of which have
often been exhibited ? Take, for example, the case of Dr.
Richter, who conducts all the works of Wagner and Beethoven
and many others without a score, and never misses a point
of the orchestration. Or to descend to a humbler class of
artists, take the case of our operatic chorus singers, who
will sustain their parts in a great number of operas in
Italian, German and French, and many of whom, if I mistake
not, are quite incapable of understanding the words they
sing. Be this as it ,may, I well know a young lady who
will sit down and sing for an hour from memory in German,
Italian and Latin without being in the least able to construe
the words she sings. If such feats, if not quite ordinary, are
by no means very rare, is it not hasty to lay down the limits
of a visualising memory with, or even without, such helps
as my earlier remarks suggest ? Inasmuch as on the doctrine
of parsimony it is admitted that in our researches we are
bound to exhaust the possibilities of the normal before resorting
to hypotheses of the supernormal, I trust that these comments
will not be deemed wholly irrelevant to the discussion
referred to.
EXPOSURE OF MR. ELDRED.
THOSE of our readers who have followed the accounts of sittings
with Mr. Eldred which have appeared iu the spiritualist
papers for about a year past will probably not feel much sur
prise at hearing of the sensational exposure which took place
on March 5th, as described in Light for March 10th, when
the back of the chair that he was using in the cabinet was
found to contain a concealed space, in which when opened
were discovered many yards of black and white drapery,
a neat pink mask, a variety of highly effective beards and
wigs, and an electric lamp to make spirit lights.
Many suspicious features in the performance were noted in
almost all accounts of the sittings, notwithstanding the fact
that most of the accounts were given by persons convinced
of the genuineness of the phenomena, who apparently drew no
inferences from what they observed. Thus, in the course of
each sitting it generally happened that the supposed " spirit
form " and medium were visible at the same time. The

APML, 1906. Exrpoawre of Mr. Eldred. 243
following is a typical description of the appearance presented
by the medium under these circumstances, taken from a report
of a sitting at Clowne, near Chesterfield (where Mr. Eldred
was then living), on July 30th, 1905, as given in Light, Vol.
XXV. (1905), p. 416:
He had shrunk up like a mummy ; his head seemed to have
sunk in between his shoulders, and his legs seemed to have become
shorter. When he had sat down at the beginning of the sitting we
had seen his feet reach out under the curtains ; now they scarcely
touched the floor. He seemed all shrivelled up, but on his cheeks
there was a feverish red spot.
Another sitter describing the same phenomenon at what he
reports as " A satisfactory seance with Mr. Eldred," writes
(Light, January 27th, 1906, p. 40):
Words cannot express my astonishment at what I saw; all I can
say is that the medium was shrivelled to half his normal size ;
loose baggy skin hung in folds which the spirit handled freely. All
this took place in view of all the sitters, the materialised form being
in full view, walking and talking for about twenty minutes.
Another gentleman writes (Light, February 3rd, 1906, p.
51):
It was Mr. Eldred unquestionably, but shrunk and rigid ; his-
hands had nearly disappeared up the sleeves of his coat. The sight
was not pleasant, and 1 advise no one to insist upon seeing a medium
in this condition.
Those, indeed, who have seen the photograph (referred to
below) of the extremely repulsive-looking dummy concocted
from the materials left after the famous sitting of March 5th
last, will be able to form some judgment of the nerve that
must have been required to face the object itself in the semi-
darkness of an actual sitting. Again, a lady reports (Light,
February 10th, 1906):
The medium . . . looked indeed a pitiable object as he sat in
his chair. I knelt in front of him and thus perceived that his
body was all contracted as well as being about half its normal size.
There was also no perceptible movement in the shrunken form ; the
whiteness of the face showed in strong relief against the dark back
ground, and there was a set look on the fixed features that one
associates with death.
244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.
Similar descriptions from believers are to be found in Light
of the present year, pp. 79 and 80. The same phenomenon
is described by sceptics in curiously similar terms ; see, e.g.,
a careful and detailed account of a sitting given by Dr.
Abraham Wallace in Light of Jan. 27th, 1906, pp. 40-41;
and in another account of the same sitting, signed " Truth-
Seeker," p. 70, as follows:
I found the supposed body of the medium to be a dummy.
The head of the dummy was, I should say, an inflated bladder.
It had rather the appearance of a carnival mask, such a mask as
one often sees worn on November 5th. The body of the dummy
was dressed in Mr. Eldred's clothes, the cuffs empty in the most
approved style, according to the legend which represents Mr.
Eldred as shrunk up to almost nothing, while the materialised form
is manifesting.
Another suspicious point which came out in many of the
accounts was the mask-like appearance of many of the "spirit
forms"; thus in Light, Vol. XXV. (1905), p. 255, "Mr. Y.
says that . . . her eyes were most indistinct, more like gimlet
holes than eyes, void of expression." Also in Light, Vol. XXV.,
p. 451, " M. Garsault told us ... the face appeared familiar
to him, but it had no eyes, only holes in their place, and
this had hindered him from identifying the spirit."
The following is an account contained in a letter from
Mr. Feilding of a sitting at Clowne which he attended on
April 23rd, 1905:
April 26th, 1905.
Eldred is a man of about 30, pleasant, and frank spoken. He
holds sittings every Sunday, which are attended by working-class
audiences more or less. He charges no fee, and takes none. He
has rigged up a special little seance room, curtained off with a cabinet
containing a big arm chair, a linoleum floor and bare walls, except
for a small baize curtain nailed to the wall loose for a background.
He asked me to search himself, the chair (which he pointed out
was very thick and might contain apparatus) and the cabinet. I
did neither. An audience of about ten or twelve sat in two rows,
the back row raised as in a theatre, at the opposite end of the
room to the cabinet. An unshaded gas-light burned over our
heads, controlled from the cabinet by the spirits.
He promises good conditions, and gives them; so good in fact
that his fraud is perfectly obvious. That is the odd thing about the
APRIL, 1906. Exposure of Mr. Eldred. 245
whole affair. It is as though having told you that a spirit would
appear in full daylight from the next room, I presently were
to emerge thence dressed in a white sheet and a mask, and
say I was your grandfather. He was the most daring medium
I ever heard of. Some dozen or more spirits turned up ; some
times the light was very poor and the faces so shrouded in drapery
that nothing could be seen. Sometimes the light was excellent, when
he wore an extremely obvious mask, painted and stiff.
One of his promises was to show the medium while the spirit
was out. This he fulfilled. I was invited up by a spirit to
within 3 or 4 feet of the cabinet, the curtains of which were
drawn back, and the light was quite sufficiently good for me to
see a mannikin figure surmounted by a large white mask-like face,
no more resembling the medium than a turnip. I asked if I might
touch it, but was not allowed (for fear, as he told me afterwards,
of cross-magnetism).
A spirit with a female face came and bowed to me. I was told
to get up and examine it. I went within a foot of it and saw a
clear painted mask wearing eyeglasses without rims. I suggested
various real names of the departed, but the spirit shook her head.
Then I said enthusiastically, " Are you, are you Miss Elliman ? "
The spirit bowed frantically. " What ! Mary Elliman ? " I said.
Great bows. " Mary Elliman that I met that time at the hotel at
Cintra in Portugal!" Cordial assent. (I have never been to Portu
gal, nor heard of Mary Elliman.) Another spirit, a man with a
yellowish moustache, more shrouded, and I think with no mask,
but with eyeglasses as before, also beckoned me forth. " What," I
exclaimed, " Sidney Parry ! " (It was really quite like him, but
Sidney Parry isn't dead.) Great emotion and assent. A few other
words from me, ending with " But, my dear fellow, when did you
pass over?" The spirit, feeling that it had made a, faux pas, then
immediately ceased to be Sidney Parry, shook its head vigorously
and retired behind the curtain.
A man next to me was summoned by a spirit. Now, I saw that
spirit as well as he did. It had its face so shrouded that one could
see nothing. But he asked if it was his wife, and it agreed that it
was, and kissed him and whispered in his ear, and he returned to
his seat shaken with sobs.
Spirits dematerialized visibly, and very obviously, upwards and
downwards, by pulling up a black cloth or by sinking gradually on to
the floor, and eventually Sir Hector Macdonald, in excellent light,
and wearing a huge and very plastery mask, with an enormous
burlesque moustache, turned up. Also a child, which wouldn't come
far out from the cabinet up to us, as the others all did (except
Sir Hector), because,—as it was explained by a habitue^ —the sitters
might be tempted to pick it up on to their knees. I asked it to
turn round so that I might see if it was stooping, but it wouldn't.
I cannot conceive how any one can be taken in. Mr. Phillips'
246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.
account in the Two Worlds1 is quite accurate, and Mr. Phillips agrees
that it looks like fraud. I should rather think it did. The medium
is not secured in any way, and the only thing that puzzles me is
where he concealed the drapery, which is solid and very voluminous,
and the masks. I did not search him, because 1 felt that since he
asked me to do so, it would be of no use, and I thought that if
the affair bore the slightest resemblance to anything genuine I would
ask for a test seance later on. So clear was the fraud that I in
tended to go and talk it out with Eldred quite frankly and find
out the man's psychology; and I went again to Clowne in the
morning, but found he had gone for a holiday by an early train.
With regard to the statement made to Mr. Feilding that
no fees were charged for the sittings,—whether or not this
was the rule at that time,—we learn from an account of a
sitting at Clowne, dated May 24th, 1905, that "5s. each is
the charge to strangers, and a nice little income " (states the
writer) " must result to folk in their position, who I should
imagine not to have more than 40s. to 60s. a week. He
[Mr. Eldred] is manager to a grocery store." The fees charged
after Mr. Eldred had set up in business as a medium at
Nottingham were considerably higher.
Dr. Wallace observed (see Light of January 27th, 1906)
the close resemblance between one of the " spirit forms " and
the medium, whereas the only resemblance between the form
purporting to be Mr. Everitt and Mr. Everitt himself lay in
the size of the beard (a portrait of the late Mr. Everitt having
recently appeared in a memorial notice of him in Light).
One of the smaller forms was observed by Dr. Wallace to
be about the height of an adult on his knees, and to advance
a short distance from the cabinet in a somewhat undulatory
manner, as a person on his knees would do.
Still more definite evidence of fraud was found at a sitting
with Mr. Eldred by the Nottingham Spiritual Evidence Society,
a report of which appears in Light of Feb. 3rd, 1906,
pp. 52-3. The report is signed by Mr. J. Fraser Hewes,
President, and Messrs. W. J. Leeder, Eobert Birtle, Alfred E,
Stevens, Thomas L. Rees, and T. Squires. On this occasion
the medium was tied in the cabinet in the only manner in
which his manager, Mr. Ellis, would permit, permission being
refused to the sitters to fasten him in any way which they
1 In this account, stress is laid on the extraordinarily artificial and mask-
like appearance of many of the " spirit "-faces.
APRIL, 1906. Exposure of Mr. Eldred. 247
considered satisfactory. The fastenings were made into a knot
and nailed down to the floor, and the heads of the nails
sealed with sealing wax. A form came out from the cabinet
some little distance into the room. Afterwards, while singing
was going on, " a momentary reflection of yellowish light
was observed on the ceiling above the cabinet, and at least
five of the sitters smelt the peculiar odour of burning sealing
wax ; the intermittent bright light inside the cabinet was also
seen again close to the position of the seals." When these
were examined after the sitting Mr. Hewes found that both
the original seals were gone, and that one of the fastenings
had been re-waxed with three little pats of fresh wax, but
there was no seal. The other fastening had not been re-waxed,
but the seal was gone, and the top of the nail left bare. The
nails were loose in the floor and came out quite easily.
A later letter from Mr. Hewes, published in Light of
Feb. 17th, 1906, p. 80, states that the spirit light which
figured at so many of the sittings " has turned out to be
two watch glasses, back to back, with phosphorescent paint
daubed on the inside." One of these lights was broken in
the course of one sitting, and some pieces of it were kept
by two of the sitters and afterwards examined. Mr. Hewes
says that the light could still be seen in the dark on looking
at the fragment a month later. What appears to be the same
form of " spirit light " figures in accounts of some of the earlier
sittings, see Light, Vol. XXV. (1905), pp. 415 and 520; also
in a letter following that of Mr. Hewes's just referred to, by a
sitter believing in the phenomenon, who remarks that it " very
much resembled a large piece of opal, only full of light."
A further interesting detail is given by Mr. Hewes as to
the method of so-called " dematerialising " (see Light of Feb.
17th, 1906, p. 80), "Mrs. Richardson also states that when
one of the forms was dematerialising, she could see a dark
object being drawn upwards, thus covering the white drapery.
In the case of a diminutive form she saw the knees sticking
out in front." This latter sentence seems to confirm Dr.
Wallace's opinion as to the short form which he saw, while the
" dark object " was probably one of the pieces of fine black
cloth found on the occasion of the exposure on March 5th,
the report of which we now proceed to quote from Light of
248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1906.
March 10th, 1906, as given by Dr. Wallace and Mr. John
Lobb. Dr. Wallace writes :
... At a meeting held on the evening of Monday last, the 5tb
inst., at the house of Mr. Ronald Brailey, in Bayswater, the nefarious
trickery of Mr. Eldred and his manager, Mr. Ellis, was completely
exposed. The week previously some interesting phenomena were said
to have taken place which astonished most of the sitters, but among
these was a friend of Mr. Brailey's, whom I know to be a gentleman
possessing a well-balanced judgment and keen critical powers. . . .
This gentleman expressed to Mr. Brailey his suspicions, and after the
stance, learning that the cabinet and chair used by Mr. Eldred had
been sent from Nottingham, and were left for further meetings, he
suggested to Mr. Brailey that he ought to try his psychometric
powers on the chair. . . . The chair had been carefully packed away
with the cabinet, but at the instigation of his friend these were un
packed by Mr. Brailey, and, placing his hand upon the chair, he
said, pointing to the back of it : ' There is a secret compartment here ! '
This statement was proved to be true by subsequent examination,
and in the back a small keyhole was found deeply embedded and well
covered up by the plushette material. Mr. Brailey communicated his
discovery to Mr. Lobb, who had been one of the circle, and he,
knowing my interest in the case, telephoned to me. A key was
made which opened the lock, and a photograph was taken showing the
secret compartment, which measures fifteen inches by two inches.
We determined after this discovery to put a stop, at the next
meeting, to any further fraud. I was asked by Mr. Lobb (who
had to go out of town) to arrange a method of trapping the
culprits. Several of the sitters at the approaching sitting on Monday
were informed of the discovery. I asked one or two good Spiritualists
to be present, and I knew of a good clairvoyant who arranged to
assist. The stance having been opened in the usual manner, a
search of the medium was made and the chair was particularly
noted. It was found that the stuffing at the back of the chair
was more pronounced, and the sensitive referred to, Mr. Drew, on
psychometrising it, assured those present that it contained some
very suspicious articles which must have been placed there just
before the stance. The key was used and the upholstered panel
in the back of the chair fell forward, the space being completely
packed with articles necessary for faking 'spirit forms.'
It was then found that the secret recess contained a collapsible
dummy head, made of pink stockinet, with flesh-coloured mask
(with pieces of stockinet gummed over the eye holes) ; the loose
stockinet was doubtless used to represent the shrunken skin at
tlin neck ; six pieces of fine white China silk containing in all
thirteen yards ; two pieces of fine black cloth (doubtless used in
the so-called dematerialisations) ; three beards of various shades ;
two wigs, one white and one grey ; an extending metal coat-
hanger for suspending drapery to represent the second form, with
an iron hook on which to hang the form ; a small flash electric
APRIL, 1906. Exposure of Mr. Eldred. 249
lamp with four yards of wire with switch, which could be used
when the medium was away from the cabinet to produce so-called
spirit lights within ; a bottle of scent, pins, etc. . . .
On being challenged with the fraud, Mr. Eldred confessed his
guilt and handed over the key of the secret compartment. Instead
of charging the two individuals we tempered with mercy our sense
of horror, disgust, and indignation at such infamous proceedings. I
requested the return of the money taken, which I must say was
promptly done, and I confiscated the dummy articles, which are
now in the office of Light for inspection. . . .
Mr. Lobb's account was as follows :—
March 6th, 1906.
It is with much pain I have to inform your readers that Spiritualism
is to-day face to face with a disgraceful fraud in the person of Mr.
Charles Eldred, of Nottingham. We are indebted to the spirit
world, through Mr. Ronald Brailey, the clairvoyant, for the dis
covery of the method by which the cleverly-arranged, wicked fraud
has been perpetrated. On February 22nd, Mrs. Lobb and myself
were invited to a stance at Mr. Brailey's house for materialisation,
Mr. Eldred being the medium. A few days after the stance Mr.
Brailey was impressed to examine the chair which had been used
and left there by Mr. Eldred, and his clairvoyant powers enabled
him to discover a space in the high back, large enough to contain
a suit of clothes, that could be hidden away under the plush. A
locksmith was sent for, and the enclosure opened; a key was made,
and the chair carefully put back for the second se'ance, which was
to be held on Monday night last, March 5th. After a consultation
we resolved to photograph the chair and its open space, and await
results. I communicated with Dr. Abraham Wallace, of Harley
Street, W., and arranged for some strong men to be present in an
adjoining room with the doctor. Accordingly, on Monday evening
last, after the medium had been stripped and examined, we took
hold of the said plush chair, and demanded the key ; failing to
obtain it, we opened the space in the chair with the key we had
had made, and there, exposed to the view of all, were the
draperies, masks, false hair, etc., which had been employed by Mr.
Eldred in his impersonations of different spirits. Mr. Eldred at once
owned up. No language is too strong to express our pain and
disgust. . . . JOHN LOBB.
The stage properties, as stated above, are now at the office
of Light. The collapsible dummy head or mask, which may
have been used either as a mask or to represent the dummy
of Mr. Eldred, could be drawn completely over the head,
and is partially stiffened by a piece of coarse canvas gummed
on the inner surface of the face. By means of the metal
coat-hanger for suspending drapery, the second form could be
made to appear either in contact with the first or at a little

distance from it, and could also be raised in the air (the
levitation of the smaller second form being a fairly frequent
phenomenon). All these objects could be concealed in the
compartment in the back of the chair, being of such a nature
as to be easily folded into a very small space. They could
also be concealed without much difficulty inside a man's
clothes, and it is not improbable that this was the method
used during some at least of the earlier sittings, since it
appears that it is only comparatively recently that Mr.
Eldred has allowed himself to be searched after the sitting.
In an account given by Admiral Moore in Light of Feb.
3rd, 1906, it is stated that at a sitting held at Nottingham
on Jan. 16th, 1906, the "control" said that "for once" the
medium should be thoroughly searched after he came out of
trance, and Mr. Halstead (whose letter about the same sitting
appears in Light of Feb. 24th) has informed us that they
were told by the entranced medium on this occasion that they
should have a privilege that had never been granted before
and never would be again, viz. that of being allowed to search
the medium after the sitting.
The chair is an innocent-looking folding chair, with wooden
arms, the seat and middle part of the back being covered
with thick plushette. The middle part of the back projects
forward a little, as if thickly stuffed ; but if one sits in the
chair and leans back, even though devoid of any special
psychometric discernment, one is impressed at once with the
sensation of a hard instead of a yielding surface. This is
produced by a piece of wood inside the plushette, which
forms the front of the secret compartment, the back of it
being formed of another piece of plushette. Two photographs
of the chair and other accessories have been taken by Messrs.
Martin & Sallnow (416 Strand, London, W.C.). One of these,
which is reproduced in Light of March 17th, shows the secret
compartment, a " spirit form " composed of some of the drapery
and the mask, the " spirit light " with its electric switch, the
wigs, beards, etc. The other shows a dummy seated in the
chair, its head formed of the mask, and exhibiting the features
so frequently described by sitters.
We propose in our next number to give an account of the
recent exposure of Mr. Craddock.

On the proposal of the President, Mr. Piddington, who
had expressed his willingness to go to Boston for the purpose,
was given full powers to act on behalf of the Council in all

document as they may be advised to be required to enable
Mr. Piddington to deal with and arrange the affairs of the
Branch.
PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND
ASSOCIATES.
THE 14th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only
was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.,
on Friday, March 30th, 1906, at 4 p.m., the President, the
Right Hon. G. W. Balfour, in the Chair.
THE HON. EVERARD FEILDING read a paper on " Some
Observations and Experiences reported by Mr. W. G. Grotten-
dieck." The first part of the paper consisted of a preliminary
report of some experiments in motor automatism carried out
by Mr. Grottendieck with a friend of his, Mr. B. Mr. B.,
while remaining in his normal condition of consciousness,
executed a number of involuntary movements, sometimes spon
taneously and sometimes in response to the suggestions of Mr.
Grottendieck. These suggestions, however, were as a rule only
efficacious when addressed to a supposed " control," not when
addressed to Mr. B. himself. One of the " controls " sometimes
manifested an extraordinary degree of hypenesthesia of hearing;
being able to respond to suggestions made in a low whisper
by Mr. Grottendieck standing outside the closed door of the
room in which the medium, with his ears stopped with cotton
wool, was sitting, while the hitter, if addressed directly in
a loud voice, appeared unable to hear anything at all. The
" controls " were also able to produce in Mr. B. automatic
movements in opposition to his conscious will and desire, and
to use his muscles with considerably greater force than he
could voluntarily exert. In all these respects the phenomena
were analogous to those often met with in hypnotic experi
ments, the " control " playing the part of the suggestible
258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1906.
hypnotic personality, but manifesting itself simultaneously with
the normal personality. It tried but failed to exhibit any
indication of supernormal powers either psychical or physical.
After an interval for tea, Mr. Feilding read the account of
the case of " Poltergeist " phenomena witnessed by Mr.
Grottendieck, which is printed below, and a discussion
followed.
MR. F. PODMORE pointed out that it must have been
difficult or impossible for Mr.' Grottendieck to watch the boy
lying on the floor at the same time that he was seeing the
stones come through or from the ceiling. He remarked that
the abnormal slowness of motion of the stones was a pheno
menon frequently described in Poltergeist cases, and that this,
combined with Mr. Grottendieck's impression that the move
ments of the boy were extraordinarily slow, suggested that
he was at the time in a slightly abnormal condition, during
which he might have been liable to illusions.
SIR LAWRENCE JONES remarked that considering the length
of time that the phenomena appeared to have been going on,
it was curious that not more than about twenty stones were
finally picked up.
Mus. SIDGWICK said that, as Mr. Grottendieck himself had
suggested, it seemed possible that part of the phenomenon
was hallucinatory. If so, some of the stones he imagined
himself to have seen falling might have been hallucinatory
stones.
PROPOSED MEMORIAL TO MR. MYERS AT
CHELTENHAM COLLEGE.
WE think that all members of the Society will be interested
in hearing of the proposal to erect a memorial to Mr. Myers
at his old school, and we therefore gladly print a circular
describing the scheme which has been sent to us by Mr.
F. J. Cade, of Cheltenham College.
There is a general feeling that the time has come when some
monument to the memory of Frederic W. H. Myers should be
placed within the precincts of his old school as a tribute to his
brilliant genius and indefatigable energy, and as a token to those
who follow hereafter.
MAT, 1906. Proposed Memorial to Mr. Myers. 259
It is thought that not only Old Cheltonians, but men of letters in
both hemispheres, and the many colleagues of his research into the
mysteries of human personality, might wish to contribute to such a
memorial of the passing hence of a spirit that, monument or no
monument, will live in the minds of men.
His gifts were so manifold and various that it is not easy to
think of any adequate mode of commemorating them. A poet from
his childhood, an Inspector of Schools during the best years of his
life, and in his leisure hours one of the first organizers of higher
education for women, he nevertheless found time to be a brilliant
•writer of prose on literary and philosophic subjects, a strenuous
vindicator of the immortality of the soul, and the author of what
may yet prove to be the greatest book of the twentieth century.
It is thought that his latest and most passionate endeavour to pierce
the veil of the unseen world and enlighten the minds of his fellow-
men, lends itself best to symbolic treatment and is most suitable for
a prominent place in the Chapel of Cheltenham College, where it
is proposed to place the Memorial.
In six bays of the Chapel, below the windows and above the
stalls, the lunettes under the arches are to be filled in memory of
Old Cheltonians, with paintings illustrative of the principal instances
recorded in Scripture of the contact of the Spirit world with this
world by the Service of Angels. On the North side are scenes from
the Old Testament, on the South scenes from the New Testament;
over the South door, as the crowning point of the whole, expressing
the triumph of immortality, is to be painted the announcement by
the Angel of the Kesurrection of Jesus Christ. It is proposed that
this picture should be the Memorial of Frederic Myers, and the
whole bay is to symbolize that confident hope of immortality of
which, with infinite labour and patience, he sought to assure his
fellow-men.
Beside and over the entrance by the South door, is to be a tree,
carved in pear-wood, symbolizing the Tree of Life. A rose-tree
has been chosen in remembrance of the words in Myers' autobio
graphy, where he speaks of the garden in the old home at Keswick.1
"The thought of Paradise is interwoven for me with that garden's
glory ; with the fresh brightness of a great clump and tangle of
blush roses, which hung above my head like a fairy forest and
made magical with their fragrance the sunny inlets of the lawn."
.Singing birds, bees and other insects, in the branches will show the
1 Fragments of Prose and Poetry, published by Longmans, Green & Co.
260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAT, 1906.
joy of life, and its continuance after death is symbolized by the
caterpillars and butterflies carved in the border of foliage above the
stalls. A tablet beneath the tree will bear a memorial inscription ;
here we shall have, in wood and metal, the teaching of his own
favourite poet Virgil, in a passage which "those lesser lives" in
spired, and which Myers has so exquisitely translated :
"To God again the enfranchised soul must tend,
He U her home, her Author is her End ;
No death is hers ; when earthly eyes grow dim
Starlike ahe soars and Godlike melts in Him."
Designs have been made by Mr. H. A. Prothero, the Architect
of the Chapel, and himself a friend and school-fellow of Myers, and
the carving will be in the hands of a firm to whom has lately been
entrusted the repair of one of Grinling Gibbons' finest works, the
carving once in Winchester College Chapel.
The cost of the memorial is calculated to be about three
hundred pounds.

A POLTERGEIST CASE.
THE following is the account of some " Poltergeist " phenomena
witnessed by an Associate of the Society, Mr. W. G. Grotten-
dieck, of Dordrecht, Holland, and discussed at the meeting of
the Society on March 30th, 1906, as reported above. The
account was accompanied by a number of drawings, not repro
duced here. These show the construction of the house as
described in Mr. Grottendieck's letters. All the rooms were
on one floor, raised above the ground by wooden piles, which
passed vertically up through the floor and supported the sloping
MAT, 1906. A Poltergeist Case. 261
roof. The partitions between the rooms were wooden frame
works, consisting of vertical and horizontal beams, the spaces
between which were covered with " kadjang " leaves. The rooms
were unceiled and the partitions between them did not reach
up to the roof. Mr. Grottendieck's native servant slept in the
room next to him, there being a wooden door in the partition
between the two rooms. The point in the roof from which
the stones fell was approximately over this partition. Mr.
Grottendieck writes : 1
DORDRECHT, January 27th, 1906.
... It was in September, 1903, that the following abnormal fact
occurred to me. Every detail of it has been examined by me very
carefully. I had been on a long journey through the jungle of
Palembang and Djambi (Sumatra) with a gang of 50 Javanese
coolies for exploring purposes. Coming back from the long trip, I
found that my home had been occupied by somebody else and I
had to put up my bed in another house that was not yet ready,
and had just been erected from wooden poles and lalang or kadjang.
The roof was formed of great dry leaves of a kind called " kadjang "
in Palembang. These great leaves are arranged one overlapping
the other. In this way it is very easy to form a roof if it is only
for a temporary house. This house was situated pretty far away
from the bore-places belonging to the oil company, in whose service
I was working.
I put my bullsack and mosquito curtain on the wooden floor and
soon fell asleep. At about one o'clock at night I half awoke hearing
something fall near my head outside the mosquito curtain on the
floor. After a couple of minutes I completely awoke and turned
my head around to see what was falling down on the floor. They
were black stones from £ to f of an inch long. I got out of
the curtain and turned up the kerosene lamp, that was standing
on the floor at the foot of my bed. I saw then that the stones
were falling through the roof in a parabolic line. They fell on the
floor close to my head-pillow. I went out and awoke the boy (a
Malay-Palembang coolie) who was sleeping on the floor in the next
room. I told him to go outside and to examine the jungle up to
a certain distance. He did so whilst I lighted up the jungle a little
by means of a small " ever-ready " electric lantern. At the same
1 At ins request we have made a few verbal alterations in those parts of
the narrative where the English was slightly incorrect or not idiomatic.
262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1906-
time that my boy was outside the stones did not stop falling. My
boy came in again, and I told him to search the kitchen to see if
anybody could be there. He went to the kitchen and I went
inside the room again to watch the stones falling down. I knelt
down near [the head of my bed] and tried to catch the stones
while they were falling through the air towards me, but I could
never catch them ; it seemed to me thai they changed their direction in
the air as soon as I tried to i/et hold of them. I could not catch any
of them before they fell on the floor. Then I climbed up [the
partition wall between my room and the boy's] and examined [the
roof just above it from which] the stones were flying. They came
right through the "kadjang," but there were no holes in the kad-
jang. When I tried to catch them there at the very spot of
coming out, I also failed.
When I came down, my boy had returned from the kitchen and
told me there was nobody. But I still thought that somebody might
be playing a practical joke, so I took my Mauser rifle and fired
5 sharp cartridges into the jungle from [the window of the boy's
room]. But the stones, far from stopping, fell even more abundantly
after my shots than before.
After this shooting the boy became fully awake (it seemed to me
that he had been dozing all the time before), and he looked inside
the room. When he saw the stones fall down, he told me it was
" Satan " who did that, and he was so greatly scared that he ran
away in the pitch-dark night. After he had run away the stones
ceased to fall, and I never saw the boy back again. I did not
notice anything particular about the stones except that they were
wanner than they would have been under ordinary circumstances.
The next day, when awake again, I found the stones on the
floor and everything as I had left it in the night. I examined the
roof again, but nothing was to be found, not a single crack or hole
in the kadjang. I also found the 5 empty cartridges on the floor
near the window. Altogether there had been thrown about 18 or
22 stones. I kept some of them in my pocket for a long while,
but lost them during my later voyages.
The worst part of this strange fact was that my boy was gone,
so that I had to take care of my breakfast myself, and did not get
a cup of coffee nor toast !
At first I thought they might have been meteor-stones because
they were so warm, but then again I could not explain how they
could get through the roof without making holes !
MAY, 1906. A Poltergeist Case. 263
In answer to our questions, Mr. Grottendieck gave further
particulars in later letters as follows :
February 1st, 1906.
In the Dutch East Indies this phenomenon seems to happen
pretty often ; at least every now and then it is reported in the
newspaper, generally concerning a house in the city. But I never
gave myself the trouble to examine one of these cases, for the
simple reason that it is an impossibility to control at the same
moment all the people that are living around. . . .
Just because the house where I was sleeping was situated all
alone, far away from other houses, I thought that this case might
be of more interest than other similar cases. Let me repeat the
following particulars of it.
(1) All around the house was jungle, in front, behind, to the
left and to the right.
(2) There was no other soul in the house and kitchen than
myself and the boy.
(3) The boy certainly did not do it, because at the same time
that I bent over him, while he was sleeping on the floor, to awake
him, there fell a couple of stones. I not only saw them fall on
the floor in the room, but I also heard them fall, the door being
at that moment half open.
(4) While the boy was standing in front of me and I shot my
cartridges, at that same moment I heard them fall behind me.
(5) I climbed up the poles of the roof and I saw quite distinctly
that they came right through the " kadjang."
This kadjang is of such a kind that it cannot be penetrated
{not even with a needle) without making a hole. Each " kadjang "
is one single flat leaf of about 2 by 3 feet in size. It is a
speciality of the neighbourhood of Palembang. It is very tough
and offers a strong resistance to penetration.
(6) The stones (though not all of them) were hotter than could
be explained by their having been kept in the hand or pocket for
some time.
(7) All the stones without exception fell down within a certain
radius of not more than 3 feet; they all came through the same
kadjang-leaf (that is to say, all the ones I saw) and they all fell
down within the same radius on the floor.
(8) They fell rather slowly. Now, supposing that somebody
might by trickery have forced them through the roof, or supposing
they had not come through it at all,—even then there would
264 Journal of Society for Psychical Researdi. MAT, 1906.
remain something mysterious about it, because it seemed to me
that they were hovering through the air ; they described a parabolic
line and then came down with a bang on the floor.
(9) The sound they made in falling down on the floor was also
abnormal, because considering their slow motion the bang was
much too loud.
The same thing had happened to me about a week before; bat
on that occasion I was standing outside in the open air near a tree
in the jungle, and as it was impossible to control it that time (it
might have been a monkey that did it), I did not pay much
attention to it. . . .
February 13th, 1906.
The construction of the house is very different from that of
European houses. It is all open, as all houses in the East Indies
are. There was no ceiling in the house.
The walls forming the rooms did not extend as far up as
the roof, so that there was an open space between the walls and
the roof. This last circumstance was the reason why I examined
the phenomenon so closely and climbed up along the vertical poles
of the wall up to the roof, to assure myself that the stones were
not thrown over the wall through the open space.
The partition between the place where I was sleeping and
the place where the boy was sleeping was continuous all around
the four sides of the room, there being a closed door between us
two. This partition was a wooden framework, with kadjang nailed
on it, forming that way a solid wall, which did not however
extend up to the roof (as just described).
The only wooden floor was formed of 2 inch boards, nailed
together, there being no holes in the floor.
I am sure of the date, 1903, because in June, 1903, my
sister died, and after this strange phenomenon occurred to me, I
began to ponder whether there might possibly be any connection
between my sister's death and the falling stones. After the
phenomenon had taken place, I bought a book about spiritism, to
try to find an explanation. Before the phenomenon occurred to me
I had read nothing about spiritism, but I had often thought about
it. I am not at all convinced that there was any connection be
tween the falling stones and my sister's death. At the moment
that the phenomenon occurred to me, I did not think about
spiritism.
As I said before, one of my impressions was that the stones
MAY, 1906. A Poltergeist Case. 265
might have been meteor-stones, on account of their being hot. I
put them in my pocket and carried them about with me for a long
time, as there was a geological Professor coming to visit us and
to inspect our work. I intended to have the stones inspected by
him, but before he came the stones had been lost.
I hope that my plan is plain enough to give you an idea of
the way in which I watched the stones coming through the roof.
I was inside the room, climbed up along the framework to the top
of the wall, held on with one hand to the framework and tried to
catch the stones with the other hand, at the same time seeing the
boy lying down sleeping outside (in the other room) on the floor
behind the door, the space being lit up by means of a lamp in his
room. The construction of the house was such that it was im
possible to throw the stones through the open space from outside.
I wrote before that it seemed to me that the boy had been
dozing all the time after I awoke him. I got that impression
because his movements seemed to me abnormally slow ; his rising
up, his walking around, and everything seemed extraordinarily slow.
These movements gave me the same strange impression as the
slowly falling stones.
When I think over this last fact (for I remember very well the
strange impression the slowly moving boy made on me) I feel now
inclined to suggest the hypothesis that there might have been
something abnormal in my own condition at the time. For,
having read in the Proceedings about hallucinations, I dare not
state any more that the stones in reality moved slowly ; it might
have been on account of some condition of my own sensory organs
that it seemed to me that they did, though at that time I was not
in the least interested in the question of hallucinations or of
spiritism. I am afraid that the whole thing will ever remain a
puzzle to me.
The criticisms on the case made at the meeting of the
Society on March 30th having been communicated to Mr.
Grottendieck, he wrote again on April 3rd, reiterating in
further detail his reasons for thinking it impossible that the
boy could have thrown the stones without being detected by
him ; viz., that three stones came through the roof while he
was touching it with his left hand and looking over the top
of the partition at the boy ; again, while he was leaning
over the boy to awaken him and facing towards the open
266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1906.
door leading into his own room, he both saw and heard
two stones falling there : also, while he was shooting into
the jungle, the boy standing a little in front of him and
to his right, so that he could see if he moved, he heard
stones falling on the floor behind him. He was entirely
alone in the house, but for the boy. The coolies had brought
his instruments and tools there and then gone on to the bore-
place, about four kilometres from the house, to which the boy
also went when he ran away. On the first occasion referred
to when he witnessed some stones falling and thought they
might possibly have been thrown by a monkey, another
servant was with him—a Soendanese native—whereas on the
second occasion the boy was a Malay Palembang coolie.
EXPOSUEES OF MR. CRADDOCK.
THE following account of the most recent exposure of Mr.
Craddock, referred to in our last number, was given by Colonel
Mayhew and published in Light of March 24th, 1906.
Being anxious to witness the phenomenon of materialisation, my
wife and I were taken by some friends of ours to Mr. Craddock's
house at Pinner to take part in a seance. We went in perfect
confidence, and without a shadow of suspicion, but by the time the
seance was over, we were forced to the conclusion that the whole
thing was unadulterated fraud. The room in front of us was pitch
dark, and, behind the circle, it was slightly illumined by a red
photographic lantern. After an address by the medium in supposed
trance, voices of an unquestionably " ventriloquial " character com
menced. They could easily be recognised as the medium's voice
disguised. After somewhat lengthy intervals, forms, purporting to
be relations of sitters, came round the circle, illumining their faces
with luminous screens. Most of these bore a striking resemblance
to one another, and were "fakes" of a most obvious character—the
false beard, moustache, etc., being badly stuck on— and would have
done poor credit to a fourth-rate marionette show. One or two
forms, pretending to be relations I had never had, came to me,
and a little child called to my wife, calling her "mother"—we
have never lost a child ! My wife and I were forced to agree that
the performance was a fraud.
We went again the week after, and the same characters were
impersonated, i.e., Dr. Graem, Dr. Arnold, Sister Amy, La belle
Cerise, and Joey Grimaldi. Again the same miserable farce took
place, which could only find its parallel in the gullibility of some
of the sitters, one lady remarking to her husband, as a form came
MAY, 1906. Exposures of Mr. Craddock. 267
to them, " Why, it's your father ! " and he, the husband, answered,
" Why, so it is—no, it isn't, it's mother ! "
" Joey " informed me that one of the spirits present was my
mother, who, I am glad to say, is alive, and, for her, very well.
I therefore determined to expose what I was convinced was
fraudulent, and having obtained an invitation for my wife, self,
and my friend, the Hon. Dudley Carleton (late 9th Lancers), we
attended last Sunday afternoon at Pinner, paying thirty shillings.
The usual impersonations were made. " Joey " announced that
Mr. Carleton's mother was present—Lady Dorchester being alive
and well ! A small piece of mirror was handed round and we
were asked to believe it was a spirit-light. An old person, with a
stuck-on white beard, went to one or two, and then there came
to me a form with a turned-up white moustache, evidently stage
property. He came quite close and I immediately seized him by
the arms. He struggled violently, and, unable to get away, threw
himself backwards into the cabinet, pulling me with him. I called
for light from Mr. Carleton, who carried a small electric lantern,
and I found the person I had seized was Mr. Craddock/ Some
confusion followed and the medium was recognised by the light.
A Mr. Rodd who was present saw him remove the false moustache
and place it in his pocket. I then released him, and his wife
concealed him behind the curtain. He then pretended to go under
control of Dr. Graem, who expressed disapproval of the proceedings.
Rear-Admiral Moore, who was " in charge," now assumed command,
with the approval of all, and appointed a search committee to search
the medium and his wife. The door was locked and the key given
to Admiral Moore. The lamp was lighted and I found a small
electric torch, evidently used for "spirit" lights, in a drawer in the
cabinet, which, when examined by several before the seance, had
been empty. The medium, however, refused to be searched, and ordered
us out. Mrs. Craddock attacked Admiral Moore with the fire shovel
in her attempts to get the key from him. Admiral Moore again
demanded a search from Craddock, who placed himself in a fighting
attitude and threatened to "set about" any one who touched him.
Everything possible was done for some time to get the medium
to submit to a search, but although the Admiral begged him for
the sake of his wife and child and his reputation, he resolutely
refused. The Admiral then told him we could only conclude that
he was a fraud, to which he said : " Call me what you like, you shall
not search me now." The medium offered a test stance at a future
date.
Mr. Carleton, Mr. Rodd, and my wife give me full leave to state
that they concur in every way in my denunciation of Craddock as
a fraud and a trickster. He may have been, may be now, a medium,
but I say without doubt that on this occasion he was caught red-
handed impersonating spirits.
I would add that I am perfectly convinced of the main features
of the faith held by Spiritualists, and this experience in no way
268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1906.
weakens my convictions ; but it is high time this abominable de
scription of jugglery should be shown up, to prevent, if possible,
the perpetration of further deceptions which can only end in the
undermining of the truth and in the alienation of all who wish to
believe it.—Yours, etc.,
MARK MAYHEW (Lieut-Col.).
P.S.—I would add that after the refusal of search, Mrs. Craddock
returned our money to us and we left.

POLEMICS OF SPIRITUALISM.
IN the Annales des Sciences Psychiques for March, 1906, pp.
140-1 (English edition, April, 1906, pp. 213-14) is published
an alleged account by Sir William Crookes of a very remark
able case of " dematerialisation " witnessed by him with
the medium Miss Florence Cook,—when the materialised form
of " Katie King " stood with outstretched arms against the
wall of the stance room, and in the light of three gas
burners, turned on to their full extent, melted away before
the eyes of the sitters, like a wax doll melting before a
hot fire, till they were left staring at the vacant spot where
she had stood.
Various enquiries having reached us as to the authenticity
of this striking story, it may be well to state that it does
not occur in any work by Sir William Crookes. It occurs,
on the contrary, (as M. Sage has pointed out to us) in a
book entitled There is no Death, by Florence Marryat [Mrs.
Ross-Church] (pp. 142-3). In regard to the passage in the
Annales, Sir William Crookes writes to us :
" As far as I am concerned there is not a word of truth
in it. Nothing of the sort ever happened in my presence, in
my house1 or elsewhere."
It seems particularly unfortunate that in a journal where
the name of Sir William Crookes appears on the cover, and
in an article consisting of animadversions on the alleged in
accuracies and unscientific spirit of an opponent, the writer
should have been betrayed into this unlucky confusion between
testimony offered by Sir William Crookes and that offered by
Miss Florence Marryat.

on Monday, May 21st, 1906, at 8 p.m.—Sir William Crookes
in the chair.
THE REV. M. A. BAYFIELD read a paper on Mme. X.'s Greek
script, facsimiles of most of which had appeared in the Journal
for April. He reiterated the arguments he had there brought
forward in favour of the genuineness of the script, illustrating
his remarks by reference to the characteristics of individual
letters. He maintained that the script showed many indica
tions of having been written by one who did not see what
she was writing, in accordance with the description given by
Professor Richet of one occasion, when Mme. X. appeared to
be looking into vacancy and to be copying something that
she saw before her. He gave a careful and minute analysis
of the kinds of defects that appeared in the writing and
which, he alleged, one would expect to find if the writer
were not looking at his work. The chief of these were : faulty
alignment ; faulty spacing of letters and words ; faulty joining
of portions of letters ; misplacements of accents and breathings;

the coarsening or deforming of letters by writing over them
again ; incompleted letters ; inequality in the size of letters.1
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES said that after hearing Mr. Bayfield's
very clear exposition of the problems connected with this Greek
writing, it seemed to him probable that many of those pre
sent would agree with the views put forward. He was inclined
to think, however, that if, for instance, a piece of his own
ordinary writing had been submitted to the same searching
scrutiny, the alignment, spacing and formation of the letters
would have been pronounced so bad that the conclusion might
have been warranted that the writer knew nothing about the
English language. It was necessary, therefore, to consider
whether the features to which Mr. Bayfield had drawn atten
tion were really characteristic of automatic as distinguished
from ordinary writing.2
As an illustration of the mental processes involved in the
act of automatic writing, he might mention a case that had
occurred in his own presence, when a medium dictated with
great rapidity a number of letters, which when written down
appeared completely unintelligible, but were found, when read
backwards, to form coherent sentences. The medium was not
in trance ; but she said she saw the letters as in a vision before
her, and dictated them rapidly with apparently no idea of their
meaning. He thought it probable that Madame X. might
similarly have seen the Greek letters in a visionary manner,
and might have copied them from their visionary prototype.
MR. F. C. CONSTABLE said that in examining this case, one
was reminded of the old maxim that " it was better to hang
19 innocent men than to let one guilty one escape," and
he thought that from the point of view of establishing a new
scientific fact, it was better to reject 19 genuine cases than
to accept one fraudulent one. Our object in investigating this
script was not to hold a brief for it, but to examine the
1 See Journal for April, 1906, p. 237.
2 Mr. F. C. Constable points out that in a letter written to him by the
Editor many of the defects mentioned by Mr. Bayfield occur, which might
suggest that the writer did not see what she was writing ; e.g. the dots some
times occur over the i's and sometimes over letters subsequent to them, and
the alignment, spacing and joining of letters are often faulty : also the same
letters, e.y. , d and g, are made in several different ways, from which it might
be argued that the writer had not developed a " personal script."

facts, and the fact of the writing having been given could
not reasonably be separated from the fact that it was given
in Greek, with the apparent object of convincing Professor
Bichet that it was due to the agency of his great-grandfather.
It was difficult therefore to find any tertium quid ; on the face
of it, it was either a case of deliberate fraud, or Madame X.
was the instrument of Professor Eichet's great-grandfather for
the production of the script. We had then to consider what
signs it showed of ordinary human agency and intelligent
adaptation of means to ends. It appears to him that distinct
human intelligence was shown in the pieces VIII. A, B, C,
and D, in adapting the length of the passages and the size of the
script to the size of the paper. It would be seen that A covers
the whole of one side, and D half the other; that the paper
was then turned round and B and C were written to fill the
rest of the page. In the Dictionary, A can be seen to be a
shorter passage than D ; it seems therefore that D was deli
berately written in very small writing, and with a fine pen,
so that it might be got into the page and leave room for
something else. In making marginal notes, or in any case
where space is cramped and hand-writing has consequently to
be smaller than usual, it is invariably found that it is more
carefully done. This general principle fits in with the fact
pointed out by Mrs. Verrall that D is considerably more
correct than the other pieces. He thought human intelligence
was again indicated in changing the source of the script after
Madame X. had been informed that Professor Eichet had
discovered the phrases in the Byzantios Dictionary—and also
perhaps in parading the first source by signing " Byzantios—
A. A. B." With regard to the substitution of Galliot, for Hellas
in VIII. B, it could be seen in the script that an English
capital H had been written first, and then changed to the Greek
capital G, the upstroke of the G being made of the left upstroke
of the H, and the rest of the H being half obliterated by the a
written over it. If this word had been seen clairvoyantly, or
in a vision produced by a " control " who knew Greek, it seems
hardly possible to suppose that there would have been this
confusion between the English H and the Greek G, which on
the other hand is easily accounted for by attributing it to a
human intelligence with the knowledge of the Greek alphabet.
274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.
MRS. VERRALL then gave an account of an apparition
recently seen by herself in a church and identified from her
description as that of a gentleman who had died about twenty
years before, and whom she had never seen. This account
will shortly be printed in the Journal.
EXPOSURES OF MR. CRADDOCK.
[Continued from the May Journal, p. 268.]
Admiral Moore writes in Light of March 24th, 1906, in
confirmation of Colonel Mayhew's account :
March \$th, 1906.
I regret to have to inform you that Mr. Craddock was detected
last night, at a stance held in his own house at Pinner, in helping
out his manifestations.
While the face of a man was being exhibited by illuminated slate
to Colonel Mayhew, the form was seized by him, a light was turned
on, and Mr. Craddock was found on the floor in his arms. When
the medium had scrambled into his seat a voice (not his natural one,
but that which we usually recognise as the voice of the control
' Graem ') talked volubly of the iniquity of " breaking conditions."
Mrs. Craddock rushed in and there was much confusion, not, how
ever, sufficient to prevent one of the sitters observing that the
medium took something from his face and put it in his pocket.
The door was locked and the key given to me.
So far I hoped that this would prove nothing more than a case
of " transfiguration," but when Mr. Craddock had come out of trance,
which he did in about eight or ten minutes, he refused to be
searched, and violently demanded that the door should be unlocked.
In the meantime Mr. Carleton found an " Ever-ready " electric light
apparatus in the drawer of a table in the cabinet which, previous
to the stance, had been found to be empty.
I now carefully, and I hope not unkindly, explained to Mr. and
Mrs. Craddock that the problem of "transfiguration" was known to
us all, and the medium would probably be acquitted of conscious
fraud if he would allow his person and room to be searched. This
they vociferously refused, Mr. Craddock saying he would give a
test seance at the rooms of the Alliance. Three times it was put
before the pair that a search was the only way to clear the
character of the medium, but without success.
JU.VB, 1906. Exposures of Mr. Craddock. 275
I now consulted Colonel Mayhew, Mr. Carleton, and two other
gentlemen. We agreed that the repeated refusal of Mr. and Mrs.
Craddock to allow themselves and the room to be searched, together
with the discovery of the " Ever-ready," was sufficient evidence of
trickery; and to end a painful scene, of which four ladies were
unhappy witnesses, I allowed the door to be unlocked and Mr.
Craddock to go out.
I know Mr. Craddock to be a medium, for I have seen and heard
manifestations when he has been in trance (four or five phenomena
simultaneously) which are inexplicable by any theory of jugglery
known to man ; but last night he undoubtedly attempted to amplify
his natural powers by fraudulent means. . . .
W. USBORNE MOORE (Rear-Admiral).
In Light for March 31st, 1906, appeared a letter from
a Member of our Council, Mr. W. M'Dougall, stating that
about six years ago at a sitting with Mr. Craddock he had
seized a " materialised " form which claimed to be that of an
Indian, Abdullah by name, and had found it to be the medium.
He had published an account of the exposure at the time
in The Two Worlds for July 28th, 1899, but the editor,
who had witnessed the exposure, refused to insert the name
of the medium. This account was as follows :
A professional medium, who claims to have enjoyed a large and
lucrative practice upon the credulity of the good people of many
cities and large towns, recently arranged to give two "sittings,"
or "seances," at a private house near Manchester, for a fee of £5
a sitting, his usual charge. The " medium " proposed to " materialise "
various spirits, and to make them visible and audible to us his
clients . . . The " medium " arrived with his business manager or
agent, and later some half-dozen acquaintances also came, who were
said to be useful in the establishing of "sympathetic conditions."
[Here follows a description of a stance of the type with
which those who have sat with Mr. Craddock are familiar.]
Almost the same group of sitters assembled again [next night], and
the meeting proceeded with similar solemn fooleries as on the previous
evening, including a progressive lowering of the lights and increasing
fervour in the singing of hymns. Thus was the "medium" encouraged
to issue from his curtained retreat in the form of the materialised
spirit of an Indian, his face darkened by a mask, and his head
276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1906.
covered with a simple white turban. This awe-inspiring vision
began to make the tour of our semi-circle, showing to each in turn
the face dimly lit by the phosphorescent pasteboard. When my
turn came I rose and seized the head in my arms and dragged it,
together with the violently resisting body of the "medium," into
the gaslight of the next room. There was a scene of some confusion
while the " medium " and his agent received corporal chastisement.
The "medium" was sullen, and would not speak except under com
pulsion. The agent was made to take an oath to the effect that
he would never again aid in similar proceedings, and the meeting
dispersed. The mask of thin india-rubber sheeting was picked up
from the floor of the dark room, and a knotted handkerchief, which
had probably served as the turban, was in the " medium's" pocket.
In his bag, when unlocked, we found, beside other small "properties"
useful in " making up," an interesting pocket book in which are
the names of a number of people, including our own and those of
several well-known and titled persons, and appended to each were
slight notes of their family affairs and relations. Several of these
names we know to be those of persons who have attended " seances "
given by the "medium."
The above account is published here in the hope that readers of
the Two Worlds will be deterred by it from taking part in any
such "sittings" conducted in the dark by professional mediums who
work for pay. The whole proceedings were, to my mind, of a
degrading and reprehensible character. . . . Yet this "medium" has
succeeded in finding many respectable and sincere persons who were
prepared to pay him as much as £5 per sitting. The name of this
person is known to the editor of Two Worlds, who can vouch for the
essential accuracy of the above account, and who will forward any
letter of inquiry on this subject to me.
M.A., M.B., Cantab.
The india-rubber mask taken from the "materialised form"
by Mr. M'Dougall on this occasion is now in our possession.
It is adapted to cover the forehead only and is painted a ground
colour of dark pink, with two black crescent-shaped bands
to represent the eye-brows. In a sufficiently dim light the
crude colouring tones down into a very realistic representation
of a brownish skin, while the lower edge of the mask is
completely invisible, appearing to be continuous with the face
above which it is placed. The effect of a similar mask seen
in a good light is well shown in a flash-light photograph of

one of Mr. Craddock's materialised forms sent to us by Mr.
G. A. Smith, who writes concerning it :
THE LABORATORY, ROMAN CRESCENT, SOUTHWICK,
BRIGHTON, December 19rt, 1905.
. . . You will see many suspicious points in this picture. The
medium no doubt was astonished when he saw the prints next day,
for he made a hasty departure and could never be induced to con
tinue the experiments. I think it was a revelation to him what
could be done with modern photographic weapons in qualified
hands. You will notice especially the false beard, the obvious
false forehead fitting over the nose, the creased drapery, whilst one
corner of this latter showing in the photograph confirms the firm
conviction I entertained at the time that the effect was obtained by
the use of a strip of material—not a whole garment—by this means
saving bulk. Some of the other pictures betray other evidence of
trickery—for instance one shows clearly his watch chain and shirt
front through the drapery. I never had prints from these negatives.
[The gentleman who took the photographs] is an expert photo
grapher, and executes commissions for the illustrated press. I was
invited to attend as an independent photographic expert who would
be able to testify that there was no humbug in that quarter. [The
photographer] was a spiritualist, and expected to convince sceptics
by the experiment. He admitted the meaning of the results, how
ever, and hoped to get Craddock again for a more complete
exposure. But as I have said, he, Craddock, saw the prints and
evidently took fright. I don't suppose he will allow flash-light and
modern lenses to play upon his performance so readily again. We
took two flash-light shots, using three cameras each time—six pictures
in all.
Mr. Smith's original notes of this sitting have unfortunately
been mislaid, but he tells us that he thinks it took place
in the year 1899. We reproduce the photograph here. It
will be noted that the mask or false forehead is marked with
a broad white arrow, probably of luminous paint, while the
arrangement of the false beard would make the face appear
much shorter and broader than it really is, since the part of
the chin that is seen below it in the photograph would
probably be invisible in a very dim light, such as is used
at these sittings.

CORRESPONDENCE.
MR. GROTTEXDIECK'S POLTERGEIST.
I.
THE case of Poltergeist described by Mr. Grottendieck (Journal,
May 1906) appears to me good. Probably the percipient's only
companion, " the boy," was not a boy. Girls and boys are always
suspected ; but Mr. Grottendieck uses the word " boy," I presume,
in the colonial sense, meaning a male native servant.
Again, Mr. Grottendieck had not, at the time of the incident,
learned, from a perusal of the Society's Proceedings, that if one sees
objects moving slowly, with a " hovering " and wavering Sight, the
explanation is that one is in a condition "something abnormal."
With great candour Mr. Grottendieck (p. 265) is now ready to suppose
that the stones moved slowly " on account of some condition of his
own sensory organs."
I am unaware that there exists any proof of a condition of the
sensory organs which causes people, presumably " excited," to see
things moving, as, in fact, they are not moving, but rather in the
wavering, swerving, and hovering manner which Mr. Bosanquet com
municates to his slow bowling. As Mr. Podmore observed at the
discussion of March 30, in Poltergeist cases, "the abnormal slowness
of motion of the stones " (and other objects) " is a phenomenon
frequently described." Certainly it is, but that the appearance is
hallucinatory, or the result of an abnormal condition of the sensory
organs, is the merest conjecture, devoid of experimental proof. Mr.
Podmore "is disposed to explain the appearance of moving slowly
or flying as a sensory illusion, conditioned by the excited state of the
percipient " (Studies in Psychical Research, pp. 157, 158). Mr. Podmore's
disposition to explain that excitement—with remarkable uniformity
in all parts of the world—causes excited persons either to see
things moving slowly when they are moving normally,—or flying
when they are not flying—is a disposition which I do not share.
I have elsewhere remarked (The Making of Religion, 1900) that
it is odd if "in states of excitement the same peculiar form of
hallucination develops itself uniformly in America, France, Germany,
England, Eussia," and South Uist ! To these local centres of identical
hallucinations we may now, thanks to Mr. Grottendieck, add Sumatra.
Meanwhile must we accept Air. Podmore's disposition to explain,
with his hypothesis based on that disposition, as warrant for a law
JUNE, 1906. Correspondence. 279
of nature 1 The servant also moved slowly. But he did not move
above the level of the soil in mid air, like the stones, and his slowness
Mr. Grottendieck (before reading Mr. Podmore's law) attributed to
the fact that the "boy" (like the Fat Boy) was "dozing all the time."
This is a natural explanation. When he awoke (p. 262) and saw
the stones falling, he did not move slowly any longer ; he bolted.
Was it Mr. Grottendieck who awoke 1 for, after the native fled, the
stones ceased to fall.
" Mr. Podmore pointed out that it must have been difficult or
impossible for Mr. Grottendieck to watch the boy lying on the
floor at the same time that he was seeing the stones come through
or from the ceiling" (p. 258).
Mr. Grottendieck, however, does not say that while he "bent
over the boy," he saw stones "come through or from the ceiling."
He says that he saw, and heard, the stones " fall on the floor."
Experiment proves that, in the attitude indicated, this can be done.
" Through or from the ceiling " are unconscious additions to the
phenomena made by Mr. Podmore, as his remarks are reported.
When bending over a boy, or other object, you certainly cannot
see the ceiling, but you can see the fall of an object, at least
I can.
It is perfectly clear that, however the stones were set in motion,
they were not set in motion by the "boy." Without believing in
a poltergeist, I can more easily believe in that, than in the explanation
of excitement affecting with such uniformity the sensory organs of
percipients from Sumatra to South Uist. The South Uist case
was very picturesque, but the percipient who reported it, a clergy
man, is dead. ANDREW LANG.
II.
Having had the advantage of long conversations with my friend,
Mr. Grottendieck, I have a wish to take up the cudgels in defence
of his Poltergeist, the doings of which were recorded in the last
Journal,
I cannot indeed yet go the length of expressing a fixed opinion
that it was a Poltergeist,—that would be going further than Mr.
Grottendieck himself,—but I do express the opinion that the
particular explanations suggested by Mr. Podmore in the discussion
on March 30th are clearly inadmissible.
From my acquaintance with Mr. Grottendieck, I say most posi
tively that it is unthinkable to me that the events which have so
280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCX-E. 1906.
much perplexed him could possibly have had their origin in any
so simple a cause as his boy, whether w^th or without a catapult,
as was suggested at the meeting by another critic. In the first
place, if you throw, or still more, catapult a stone against a kadjang
roof, you make a noise. Now, I understand from Mr. Grotten-
dieck that no noise attended the appearance of the stones through
the roof, but only on their reaching the floor, when they made
more noise than they ought to have done. In the second place,
to pitch a series of say 20 stones, at precisely the same point of
a slanting roof so that they should rebound over a partition and
fall to the floor within a radius of 3 feet, sometimes from within
the house, and sometimes from outside, and for a good part of
the time under close observation, is a feat of which I hesitate to
believe even a Malay boy with a catapult capable. Thirdly, some
of the stones were hot,—not so hot, as I understand, as actually
to burn, but hot enough to cause Mr. Grottendieck to put them
down rather hastily. Fourthly, they appeared to fall slowly, and
to evade attempts to catch them, either at the moment of their
appearance through the roof when Mr. Grottendieck's hand was
actually touching it, or of their approaching the floor.
Now, from these premises, it seems clear that neither of Mr.
Podmore's hypotheses (a) that the boy did it; (b) that Mr.
Grottendieck was in an abnormal or hallucinatory condition, will
do by itself. They must be combined. Not only must the boy
have been possessed of a mastery over the flight of stones, in
itself almost amounting to a " phenomenon," but he must have had
the cunning to select the precise moment to play an exceedingly
silly trick on his master just when the latter had gone into such
an "abnormal condition" as to predispose him to be taken in by
it. This is too much. Mr. Podmore must really try again. Rightly
considered, his hypotheses are mutually destructive. If Mr. Grotten
dieck was in an abnormal condition, why lug in the boy 1 And
if he was not, how account for his observations 1 The mere record
of his behaviour in climbing up a post to the roof and firing off
five cartridges of itself disposes of any notion of abnormality of condi
tion, a notion only suggested to Mr. Grottendieck by a study of
the Proceedings. Would that these volumes were always perused
with the same reverence and attention ! It may be that my
own unhappy experiences with another Poltergeist, recently described,
have made me unusually tender towards this one, but I do submit
that Mr. Podmore has not adequately applied his ingenuity to the
JCXE, luoc. Correspondence. 281
problem before us, and that a more plausible line of criticism is
due from him. t EVERARD FEILDING.
III.
I have just re-read Mr. Grottendieck's account of his Poltergeist
experience. I have also read, with a growing sense of shame and
confusion, the report of my own remarks, together with Mr Lang's
and Mr. Feilding's comments ; for really, when set side by side in
print, the suggestion I made seems ludicrously inadequate to explain
the wonderful phenomena described by Mr. Grottendieck. In one
respect, indeed, the briefness of the report has led Mr. Lang to do
me an injustice. When I said that it must have been difficult for
Mr. Grottendieck to watch the boy at the same time that he was
watching the stones, I was referring not, as Mr. Lang assumes, to
the occasion when Mr. Grottendieck bent over the sleeping boy, but
to the occasion when he climbed the partition and tried to watch
the stones at the same time that he was seeing the boy asleep on
the floor (pp. 262 and 265). To perform that feat, Mr. Grottendieck
would have needed a reptilian eye in the top of his head. But
anyway Mr. Grottendieck says that the stones fell whilst the boy
was outside in the jungle, and fell also whilst the boy was standing
in front of him, and whilst he was bending over the boy still asleep.
And if Mr. Grottendieck is describing what really happened, the
boy can scarcely be supposed to have thrown them on all these
occasions.
Mr. Lang is inclined to believe that Mr. Grottendieck is describ
ing what really happened. Mr. Grottendieck will pardon me if I
presume to express my doubts. There are two main general grounds
on which the accuracy of any narrator must be held open to
doubt. (1) His memory may be at fault. I notice that the account
was not written down until some time after the event. The account
in the Journal is dated January 1906, and from a paragraph on
p. 264, " I am sure of the date," etc., it may be inferred that
there is no earlier account. Many of the details are, however,
repeated more than once in the various letters dealing with the
subject, so that we have what amounts to two or more accounts
written by the same person at different times. Now, in these
accounts there is at least one important discrepancy, bearing on the
very point in dispute between Mr. Lang and myself. From the
letter dated January 27th, 1906 (p. 261), it appears that the order
of events was as follows :
282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 19(W.
(1) Mr. Grottendieck is awakened by a noise of something falling,
looks round and sees black stones falling on the floor, gets up and
turns up his lamp, and sees that the stones are falling through the
roof.
(2) He goes into the next room, finds the boy asleep, wakes him
up and tells him to go out and examine the jungle. The boy goes
out. Meanwhile the stones continue to fall.
(3) The boy returns and is told to search the kitchen. He goes
into the kitchen. While lie is there, the following events take place :
(4) Mr. Grottendieck having returned to his own room kneels
down on the floor and tries in vain to catch the stones as they
fall. He then climbs up the partition wall between his room and
the boy's to examine the part of the roof from which the stones
are falling ; they appear to him to come through it, but without
leaving any perceptible holes ; he again tries in vain to catch them
as they fall.
(5) When he came down the boy " had returned from the kitchen.''
having presumably re-entered the room while Mr. Grottendieck was
still on the wall. He then fires his rifle into the jungle. The stones
continue to fall. The boy now becomes completely awake, having been
apparently halt' asleep before ; he sees the stones fall, is greatly
terrified, and runs away. The stones then cease to fall.
Though the details are not described in the same order in the
letter of February 1st, there is nothing necessarily implying that
they occurred in a different order. Turning, however, to the letter
of February 13th (p. 265), we find Mr. Grottendieck says that,
when he climbed up the wall to see the stones coming through the
roof, the boy was at the same time lying down asleep in his own
room on the other side of the wall. Now this is quite inconsistent
with (4) above, according to which the boy had been awakened
and had carried out several orders before Mr. Grotteudieck climbed
up the wall.
One of these two accounts then—we cannot tell which—must be
inaccurate in regard to the important detail of the boy's position
at the time. If one is inaccurate, both may be. Further, if it
is only by the accident of there being two accounts that this
inaccuracy has become manifest, we are entitled to infer that there
are probably other inaccuracies which happen not to have been
manifested.
To misplace events in recollection is of course a very common
error of memory—so much so that even Mr. Lang would probably
not be surprised to find it occurring at once in America, Frauce,
Germany, England, Russia, and South Uist. It is perhaps almost
as common as the unfortunate habit of the narrators of " very
picturesque " incidents to be dead, as in the case mentioned in Mr.
Lang's last sentence.
But it is just this form of inaccuracy of recollection which—as
all students of conjuring phenomena know—makes it often impos
sible to discover from the description of an uninitiated witness how
a trick has been performed.
JUNE, 1906. Correspondence. 283
Mr. Grottendieck is obviously a careful and level-headed witness,
and not given to sensational statements, and probably the long
interval of 2£ years has affected his memory less than would be
the case with the great majority of our Poltergeist observers. Yet
even with him we find this serious discrepancy in accounts with
an interval between them of only seventeen days ! I submit, then,
that it is impossible to place so much weight on the details of
the narrative as Mr. Lang and Mr. Feilding are disposed to do.
We can with reasonable confidence infer nothing more than that 1\
years ago Mr. Grottendieck did see things which he could not
explain, and which we cannot explain from his description.
•We have, then, no right to assume that Mr. Grottendieck now
remembers accurately what he really thought at the time he saw.
And this brings us to the second source of error. If he remem
bers accurately, we have no right to assume that he really saw
what he thought he saw. My answer to Mr. Lang is, that it is he
who is making the unwarrantable assumption, and not I. These
abnormal movements of objects are like the black stones which Mr.
Grottendieck kept in his pocket. They are never forthcoming when
the expert is there to examine them. But hallucinations are always
with us. The very process of perception is itself, as Taine has said,
a kind of hallucination. Many persons experience definite sensory
hallucinations when they see a conjuring trick—it is part of the
conjurer's art to induce them.1
Mr. Lang must, I think, have been writing in haste when he
says : " I am unaware that there exists any proof of a condition of
the sensory organs which causes people to see things moving, as in
fact they are not moving, but " with abnormal slowness ; and again,
that this hypothetical explanation of part of Mr. Grottendieck's
experience "is the merest conjecture, devoid of experimental proof."
Apart from the common experience in dreams, when hours or even
years may seem to be lived through in the course of a few minutes
or seconds, which can sometimes be demonstrated in the case of
dreams initiated by some objective noise ; the disturbance of the
sense of time is one of the most familiar features of all deviations
from normal consciousness, e.g. in trances, spontaneous or hypnotic,
or as the effect of various drugs. A graphic description of this—the
result of an experiment in the effect of Indian Hemp, tried by Mr.
Ernest Dunbar—has lately been given in our Proceedings, Part L.
p. 69, where Mr. Dunbar says that a train journey of 20 minutes
seemed extended into hours, and when he walked down the platform
after it "there seemed quite an interval of time between the placing
of my foot on the ground and the realisation of having done so."
Mr. Dunbar quotes from Dr. Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine
a description by Dr. Marshall of a similar experience of his with
the same drug : "... I was continually taking out my watch,
thinking that hours must have passed, whereas only a few minutes
had elapsed. ..." He analyses the psychological effect and states
'See Jastrow's Fact and Fable in Psychology, p. 117.

that the sense of time is also disturbed under ether, chloroform
and nitrous oxide.
There is then a tendency for mental disturbances to take certain
forms when they are caused by, or occur under, certain circumstances.
And if some of the doings of Poltergeists are to be explained as
the result of hallucination, is it really more odd that people all
over the world should be liable to the same mental affections than
that they should be liable to believe the same myths, and invent
the same fairy stories'! FRANK PODMORE.
DISSOLUTION OF THE AMERICAN BRANCH.
AFTER full and anxious consideration it has been decided to
dissolve the American Branch of the Society for Psychical
Research at the end of the current year.
It is hoped that a scheme, upon which Professor Hyslop
has been for some time past engaged, may result in the for
mation of an independent organization which will carry on
the work of psychical research in America.
The records of sporadic phenomena now accumulated at the
offices of the Branch will be carefully gone through, and a
selection from them will be published in the Journal.
The Piper records, and all documents appertaining thereto,
will remain in the charge of the Council of the Society; and
as promptly as the labour involved in the study of their
voluminous and complicated contents will allow, a full report
on the later developments of the Piper case up to the date
of Dr. Hodgson's death will be issued in the Proceedings.
After publication the Council of the Society will allow
qualified and serious students access to the records ; but only
on terms which will ensure that all private and intimate
matter contained in them shall be handled with proper dis
cretion and reserve, and that all confidences shall be respected.

MEETING OF THE COUNCIL.
THE 79th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Wednesday, July 4th, 1906, at 2.30
p.m.—the President, the Eight Hon. G. W. Balfour, in the
chair. There were also present : Mr. "W". W. Baggally, Pro
fessor W. F. Barrett, Mr. E. N. Bennett, Mr. G. Lowes
Dickinson, the Hon. Everard Feilding, Mr. J. G. Piddington,
Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. Frank Podmore, Mr. S. C. Scott,
Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Lieut-Colonel Le M. Taylor, Dr. C. L.
Tuckey, and Miss Alice Johnson, Secretary.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as
correct.
Two new Members and six new Associates were elected.
The election of four new Associates of the American Branch
was recorded. The names and addresses are given above.
The monthly account for May was presented.
Mr. Piddington reported that during his visit to Boston
it had been decided to dissolve the American Branch at the
end of the present year, and that a circular to this effect
had been issued to the members of the Branch, signed by
Professor James, Professor Hyslop, Mr. Dorr and himself.
This circular had been printed in the June Journal. He
stated that the Piper records with other material from the
Branch office were now in the hands of the Society and that
Colonel Taylor had kindly undertaken to make a preliminary
examination of the cases of sporadic phenomena collected in
America.
He proposed certain regulations for the transference of
members from the Branch to the Parent Society. The Council
agreed to these and directed that they should be printed in
the Journal.
The Council desired to put on record their deep sense of
obligation to Mr. G. B. Dorr for the invaluable assistance
which he had rendered since Dr. Hodgson's death in the
direction of the affairs of the American Branch, and passed
a hearty vote of thanks to him.
PE1VATE MEETING FOE MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.
The 16th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only
was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.,
JOLY, 1906. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 287
on Wednesday, July 4th, 1906, at 4 p.m., Mrs. H. Sidgwick
in the chair.
MR. J. G. PIDDINGTON read a short paper on " Richard
Hodgson," which it is proposed to publish in Part LIT. of the
Proceedings.
Mu. G. LOWES DICKINSON then read a paper on " A Case
illustrating some Phases of Hypnotic Personality," describing
certain experiments in hypnotisation conducted by Dr. G. The
subject hypnotised, Miss C., who is not a professional medium,
describes herself in her trance as leaving her body and going
" up " into other " planes " of existence, of which the one most
constantly visited is described as the " Blue." These terms,
" up," " planes," " blue," are, however, said to be metaphors,
the real experience being one where there is no time, space,
or colour, but everything is thoughts. In this world is to be
found, it is said, not only everything that has ever happened, or
will happen, but all thoughts, dreams, and imaginations. In
one of these planes Miss C. purported to meet a certain lady,
Blanche Poynings, who lived in the time of .Richard the
Second. This lady was described as a friend of the Earl and
Countess of Salisbury, and a great many details were given
about these and other personages of the time, and about the
manners and customs of that age. The personages referred
to, the details given in connection with them, and especially
the genealogical data, were found on examination to be correct,
though many of them were such as apparently it would not
have been easy to ascertain without considerable historical
research. Miss C. had not studied the period, and could not
recall reading any book bearing upon it other than a novel
called John Standish, which has been examined and found
not to contain the information she had given. Ultimately,
however, the source on which she had unconsciously drawn
was discovered through planchette. Miss C., writing with
planchette, received communications purporting to come from
Blanche Poynings, which finally, by a very circuitous route,
and after much evasion, gave the name of a book by E. Holt
entitled The Countess Maud, as being the book in which she,
Blanche, and the other people referred to, would be found.
Miss C. then remembered that there was such a book, and
that it had been read to her, but she could not remember that
288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jtriv, 1906.
it had anything to do with Blanche Poynings, or with the
other characters as to whom she had given information. On
examination, however, the book proved to contain the whole
of the personages and facts she had given.
The chief interest of this case appears to be that it illustrates
a revival by the subconscious self of memories completely lost
to the ordinary conscious self. The novel in question had
been read to Miss C. by her aunt in the spring of 1892,
when she was a child of about 1 1 years old ; but both ladies
had now so completely forgotten its contents that they could
not even recall the period with which it dealt. It is notice
able also that the facts were reproduced in a quite new
setting, as they purported to be given in conversation by the
dead Blanche Poynings, who is only a subordinate character
in the novel. Also, they are connected with an elaborate
cosmological scheme of planes, etc., in a world without space
or time, the origin of which, in Miss C.'s mind, it is not
easy to trace.
Mr. V. J. WOOLLEY said that as he had been present at
all the sittings with which Mr. Dickinson's paper was concerned,
and as the lady was well known to him, he would like in
the first place to assure the Society of his personal conviction
that her good faith was quite beyond dispute, and with
reference to this he wished further to emphasize the point
that the experimenters' knowledge of the existence of the
book was derived solely from her own automatic writing.
To show how completely the book had faded from her
conscious memory, it was of interest to note that, after the
name of the book had been given by the planchette, she did
recall that such a book had been read to her years before,
but had only a vague impression that it dealt with the 17th
century.
As regards the phenomena of her trance, her states of
consciousness might be grouped into two main divisions, one
which she calls the " blue plane," and others which are said
to be nearer to the physical world. In connection with this
conception of " planes," it is to be noted that Miss C. is
to some extent acquainted with Theosophical theories, as her
brothers are interested in them, and she has heard them
discussed.
JOLT, 1906. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 289
When in the " blue plane," she lies back quite passively,
always with the left arm in a certain position ; her face is
quite composed and quiet and she very seldom makes any
movement with her hands. In this plane she sees nothing
happening. When, however, she has rested in this way for
a certain time, suddenly her face lights up and she exclaims :
" Now I'm going to see things," meaning that it is her
intention to do so. She thereupon voluntarily descends
from the " blue plane " into some one of the many regions
which are supposed to lie between it and her waking con
sciousness, and describes what she meets. Her descriptions
are dramatically given, sometimes with gestures, and with a
full appreciation of the humour of many of the incidents she
describes. On some occasions when she has been asked if
she can see the room in which she is lying, she has said
that she can see it a long way off, as though through the
wrong end of a telescope, and she points with her hand in
the direction in which she sees this vision ; the direction
appears to be downwards and slightly in front. There is
no reason to suppose that the distant picture of the room
which she sees corresponds at all to the actual room or its
contents.
The speaker had never before found any connection between
her hypnotic experiences and her automatic writings, which
are generally exceedingly foolish, but there had been in the
past some details in common between the latter and her
crystal visions, which are quite fantastic and unreal, and
never at all veridical, as far as he had heard.
PROFESSOR BARRETT said that a good many cases more or
less similar to this were recorded in the old mesmeric journal,
The Zoist, and an interesting modern case had recently been
brought under his own notice, that of a young engine driver,
who had dreamt, or imagined he dreamt, that he had been
present at the Battle of Hastings, and gave very detailed and
coherent accounts of it, far more detailed than would be found
in ordinary historical text-books, but afterwards discovered to
be accurate.
MR. FEILDING remarked that he thought the case described
by Mr. Dickinson the most interesting that had been brought
before the Society for a long time. It showed many analogies
290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCLT, 1906.
with the case (reported by Professor Flournoy) of Helene
Smith, who in trance exhibited a number of striking drama
tisations of personality, with occasional instances of remarkable
revivals of memory. In addition to the dramatisations of the
subliminal consciousness, and the revival of memories lost
to the supraliminal self, he thought an important and interesting
point in Miss C.'s case was that much of the information
about Blanche Poynings had been found to come from the
Appendix. Dull as was the book itself from all accounts,
the Appendix was still more dull, and it was improbable either
that a child should have read it willingly herself or even
that her aunt should have inflicted it upon her. It would
seem therefore that a good deal of information must have been
left in her mind while she was simply turning over the leaves
in the process, which she now remembers, of colouring some
of the illustrations.
CASE.
G. 279. Apparition.
THE following case was described by Mrs. Verrall at the last
meeting of the Society. Her original account here printed
was written four days after the incident occurred. The names
of all the persons and places concerned were given to us in
confidence. Mrs. Verrall writes :
On Friday [date named] I arrived at A. on a visit to my friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Z., whom I had not visited since they came to
reside in A. On the following Sunday [date named] I went to
church with Mrs. Z. Just before the service began, i.e. about
10.55 a.m., as I was taking my seat I suddenly felt a curious
sensation that something was going to happen, and this sensation
was somehow connected with the chancel or east end of the church,
which I faced from my seat. The sensation passed, and the service
bejjan. Very shortly afterwards, I had a strong impression of the
presence of a figure standing close to the south-east angle of the
chancel. This impression persisted throughout the greater part of
the service, but the figure had disappeared before the conclusion
of the sermon. I use the phrase ' impression of a figure ' advisedly,
as I never for a moment took it for an actual person ; in fact, my
visual impression persisted when I shut my eyes. The details
were extremely distinct, and I observed and noted as much as I
JULT, 1906. Case. 291
could, with a view to subsequent identification, if possible. The
figure was stationary. It did not disappear, but on one occasion,
when I looked for it, so to speak, as I did from time to time, it
was not there, and no effort on my part could bring it back.
On my return from church I related my impression to Mr. and
Mrs. Z., and my husband. The note made by Mr. Z. from my
description is appended. That description reminded him of a portrait
of one of two brothers, Mr. C. D. and Mr. E. D., closely connected
with the parish, and buried in the churchyard. The D. family
was wholly unknown to me, but on the following day, Monday, I
was shown engravings of both brothers, and at once identified in
the younger brother, Mr. E. D., the original of the figure which
I had seen in the church. The impression of that figure was
so vivid that I had felt from the first confident that I should
recognise the person if I saw him or his likeness. The age which
the figure appeared to be was 40-45, and the age of Mr. E. D. at
the time of the engraving was 37. I subsequently saw two paintings,
representing Mr. E. D. at different periods, and these confirmed
the identification, though the ruddy colouring of the face of the
younger portrait was unlike the sallow skin of the figure seen by
me. The latest portrait, however, represented the effect, noted by
me, of a skin darker than the hair, and in all three pictures the
cut of hair and beard, as well as the general cast of the features
and the expression, were well represented. None of the portraits
represented more than the head and shoulders, so that nothing
could be learnt from them as to the habitual attitude of Mr. E. D.,
and in none of them was he shown as wearing the frock coat in
which the figure appeared to me.
The result of subsequent enquiries as to the appearance of Mr.
E. D. is stated in the commentary on my first description kindly
added to this account by Mr. Z.
I need only add that I have never experienced any similar
impression. MARGARET DE G. VERRALL.
Mr. Z. writes :
Mrs. Verrall came to us at A. for a short visit on Friday [date
given] in the present year. It was her first visit to this place. On
the following Sunday morning, immediately after we returned from
church, she gave to Mrs. Z., Dr. Verrall, and myself the description
given below of a phantom figure which she had seen while in
church. The following notes of her description were taken down
.by me immediately, and no suggestion as to the identity of the
292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.
phantom was made by any of us until the description was com
pleted.
Description of phantom figure seen by Mrs. Verrall.
"Soon after entering the church felt a strong impression that
something was going to happen. First appearance of visionary
figure was shortly after the service began. The figure was that of
a tall, aristocratic-looking man,—not a soldier or clergyman—seen
three-quarter face, from the left. It was standing near the vestry
door, looking down the church. Had a feeling that it was appro
priate that he should be where he was ; he seemed to be associated
with the locality, not with any person.
"The shoulders seemed not to be quite wide enough for the height.
Face longish, with nothing very distinctive about it : nose longisb,
skin of face darkish and sallow. Age 40 to 45. Face suggested
that of Mr. Q., but was better looking. Wore moustache, beard, and
whiskers. Moustache not large ; whiskers short ; beard not long,
nor very thick, but squarish, and following lines of face. Colour of
beard, brown. Hair brown, smooth on head, but standing loose
round face : might be thick, curly hair, cut rather short.
"Figure wore black frock-coat with long skirts, grey trousers, grey
tie, of silk material, hanging full and loose, plainly visible below
short beard. The general appearance was that of a well-groomed
man. A pince-nez of gold, with curved spring, hung by a cord on
right side of body.
"Right arm hung loose, ungloved. Left arm was bent at elbow
across breast, and held stiffly : the hand was gloved, and held in a
line with the arm. The impression of this hand and arm was the
strongest received.
"Had an impression of something red in connexion with him,—
something small. This was not visualised, nor located on the
person. The form of the thing was not recognised. Felt that it
might be an order which the man was not then wearing."
Here Mrs. Verrall's description ends.
Before giving this description, Mrs. Verrall asked whether C. D.,
a person (now deceased) known to her by name as intimately con
nected with the place, held his left arm in any peculiar fashion.
I replied that he did not : and she then went on to relate what she
had seen. After hearing her description of the figure, I suggested
that it might be E. D., a brother of C. D., and also deceased, and
whom I have never seen alive. I made the suggestion because the
description recalled, in several particulars, the head and face of an
JULY, 1906. Case. 293-
engraved portrait of E. D. which I had seen in this neighbourhood.
I may add that Mrs. Verrall had had no opportunity of seeing this
or any other portrait of E. D. I have none.
On the following day I took Mrs. Verrall to see the engraved
portraits of C. D. and E. D. She at once confidently recognised in
E. D. the face which she had seen. The portrait was brought into
my house, and Mrs. Z., Dr. Verrall, and myself all agreed that the
description of the figure seen might well have been a description of
the portrait. Dr. Verrall and myself, who know Mr. Q., saw that it
was natural that the face seen by Mrs. Verrall should remind her
of Mr. Q.
Within the next few days I found from inquiries made by Mrs.
Z. and myself from three persons interviewed at different times,
and who had often seen E. D. during his lifetime, that it was his
habit to carry his left arm bent at the elbow across the breast. I
also discovered that he was a tall, thick-set man, and that he
limped with the left leg, having (as it was believed) broken it
twice. I believe that it is common with people who limp with one
leg to carry the corresponding arm across the body in a position
similar to that seen in the phantom figure.
I was with Mrs. Verrall when she saw the two portraits in oil,
and agreed with her that they confirmed the evidence for identifica
tion.
E. D. was a civilian and Member of Parliament who died about
20 years ago, and he must accordingly have sometimes worn a dress
of the kind described.
I am not aware of any reason for connecting the day of his
appearance—for it seems hardly possible to resist the evidence for
identifying him with the figure seen—with any day in which he
would have been likely to have a special interest : it was not the
•date of his birth or death.
With regard to the impression of red in connection with the
figure, I may perhaps mention that red is conspicuous on the coat
of arms of the D. family. There is a coloured representation of the
arms in the church, but it is not visible from the seat in which
Mrs. Verrall sat, nor could she have seen it in passing to her seat.
Mrs. Z. and Dr. Verrall sign this statement in corroboration of
such parts of it as concern them.

Additional note by Mr. Z. on the apparition seen by Mrs. Verrall.
Since writing the previous note, I have had a talk with the
widow of C. D. (She is referred to below as L. D.)
L. D. of course knew E. D. well. She said he had his left leg
nearly two inches shorter than the other, and consequently limped ;
the injury was at the hip. He had nothing the matter with his
left arm, and she had never noticed him carrying it as seen by
Mrs. Verrall ; he habitually walked with his hands in his jacket
pockets. L. D. had never seen E. D. in a frock coat : he wore in
London a cut-away or morning coat : doubtless he had a frock for
state occasions,—going to Windsor and the like. He tied his tie in
a bow, except when deer-stalking and shooting generally, when he
tied it in a sailor's knot, in order that the ends might not blow
about. E. D. was slightly bald behind the forelock. (This fact is
only just apparent upon a careful examination of the later oil portrait
seen by us.)
Mrs. Verrall stated to us, but has not recorded the fact in her
written statement, that before she saw the epitaph on E. D.'s grave
{which was a day or two after she saw the apparition), she had the
impression that he was not a believer. This impression, as I gathered
from L. D., appears to be correct. Such an inference might well be
drawn from the epitaph.
P.S. (July, 1906).—Since the statement above was written, I have
obtained further independent confirmation of the fact that E. D.
carried his left arm in the position seen by Mrs. Verrall.
CORRESPONDENCE.
MR. GROTTENDIECK'S POLTERGEIST.
In regard to the discussion in the last number of the
Journal, Dr. J. W. Pickering writes :
Mr. Andrew Lang states on p. 278 of the June Journal: "I
am unaware that there exists any proof of a condition of the
sensory organs which causes people, presumably excited, to see
things moving as in fact they are not moving, but rather in the
wavering, swerving, and hovering manner which Mr. Bosanquet
communicates to his slow bowling." Mr. F. Podmore, on p. 283,
states that the disturbance of the sense of time is one of the most
familiar features of all deviations from normal consciousness and
cites trances, spontaneous and hypnotic, as well as the action of
various drugs. In each of these instances the psychical condition
JOLT, 1906. Correspondence. 295
of the percipient is abnormal, and in order to apply this criticism
to poltergeist phenomena it must be assumed that a similar abnormal
psychical condition occurs whenever such phenomena are observed.
It therefore becomes of interest to consider whether in normal
conditions of consciousness illusions of movement occur.
Sully,1 writing on the limits of sensibility, states : " The most
familiar example of such slight errors is that of movement. When
looking at objects our ocular muscles are apt to execute slight
movements which escape our notice. Hence we tend, under certain
circumstances, to carry over the retinal result of the movement, that
is to say, the impression produced by a shifting of the parts of the
retinal image to new nervous elements, to the object itself, and
so to transform a 'subjective' into an 'objective' movement."
Prof. S. P. Thompson,2 writing on optical illusions of motion,
states : " These illusions involve the co-operation of some preconception
or expectation. For example, the apparent movement of a train
when we are watching it and expecting it to move involves both
the element of sense impression and of imagination."
It is possible that the peculiar hovering movement described in
poltergeist phenomena may be explained by the movements of the
muscles of accommodation of the eye. Tlu close walching of the objects
in transit may tire these muscles with the consequence that their movements
are accentuated. The result would be the shifting of the retinal
image to new nervous elements, and if this occurred to a considerable
extent, the percipient would describe the motion of the objects as
hovering and wavering.
Whilst I am of opinion that these physiological factors should
not be lost sight of, I do not wish to urge them as the correct
explanation of the observations. It could, however, be a subject for
experimentation. JOHN W. PICKERING.
Mr. Grottendieck sends us the following details in answer
to some enquiries from Mr. E. Westlake as to the geological
character of the stones, etc., with some comments on Mr.
Podmore's criticisms of the case, printed in the last Journal.
He tells us also that the " boy " was about 16 or 17
years old.
The stones were black and polished and about ^ to £ inch in size.
The biggest one was certainly not more than 1 inch. They were
not smooth like pebbles. They were not like volcanic cinders ; not
1 Sully, Illusions, p. 50. 2 In Brain, Oct. 1880.
296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JI-LY, 1906.
crystalline. They were slaty, arranged in layers and looked very
much like anthracite, but the edges were not quite so sharp as pieces
of anthracite. They were not so heavy as meteoric iron, but more
light like anthracite is.
On the evening the phenomena occurred, I noticed that they all
fell down within a certain radius of about 3 feet. Next morning I
found them where I had left them myself the night before, and did
not find any other stones in the house.
The sound of falling on the floor was decidedly much too loud.
I do not remember with absolute certainty that I threw them
upwards, although I am inclined to think that I did. But I remember
that the sound with which they came down on the floor was also
slightly diS'erent from the ordinary noise. The sound was more
" hollow " (or explosive).
The hut was not specially my home, but I knew very well the
surrounding jungle. The house (or hut) was situated near a river
(Meranti-river). In this river there is an immense lot of " braun-
kohle," so-called " junges pliocan." You can just walk over the
braunkohle banks, just as in the Kapass-river, but there is decidedly
no anthracite. As far as I know there is no anthracite on the whole
island of Sumatra, but an immense lot of braunkohle. But the stones
were not braunkohle. They were much too black and polished for
that.
As to Mr. Podmore's criticisms, my comments will be put in the
form of questions and answers :
(1) Where was the boy when I was climbing up the partition '?
Answer. I do not know, because I was not clairvoyant and could
not look right through a kadjang partition.
(2) Where was the boy when I had reached the top of the partition ?
Answer. He was lying down on the floor, apparently asleep.
I saw him there directly when I looked over the partition and
during the time that I saw the stones coming through the roof.
(3) What conclusion do I now draw 1
Answer. That the boy must have returned from the kitchen
during the time that I was climbing up the partition, and that he
must have put himself down on the floor again to continue his sleep.
(4) Would this be probable ?
Answer. Certainly it would, because, when you awake a native-
boy at night, then he will put himself down on the floor again to
continue his sleep, just as soon as be does not see his master any
more.
JULY, 1906. Correspondence. 297
There is still another detail which I now remember and which
shows me also that I could not see him at the moment that I
climbed up. It is this : At the moment that I looked over the
partition and saw the servant, I kept myself up with my right hand
and searched the roof with my left hand. When you take now into
consideration that the stones appeared through the roof somewhere
above the door, then there follows as an absolute necessity that I
must have climbed up at the right-hand side of the door, which
means behind the open door. So of course I could not see him
coming back. (A rough plan of the rooms shows this.)
The servant was certainly not fully awake before I shot my five
cartridges, but I really do not know whether he was " in trance "
or not, because I do not know much about trance. The only thing
I have ever seen of it is with Mr. B., and he behaves " like a fool."
The boy never behaved in that way on that night, but he moved
abnormally slowly, just as the stones also did. But my own move
ment did not give me the impression of being slow.
So you see that, notwithstanding I have communicated everything
I remember, I can only come to this conclusion ; and I think the
fact that I could not of course remember a thing that I could not
have seen explains what seemed to be a discrepancy.
W. G. GROTTENDIECK.
THE AMERICAN BRANCH AND THE AMERICAN
INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
Shortly after the announcement of the impending dissolution
of the American Branch, a circular, of which the opening
paragraphs are given below, was addressed to its Members and
Associates :
AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
SECTION B.—PSYCHIC RESEARCH.
THE members of the American Branch of the Society for Psychical
Research understand the irreparable loss which it has suffered in the
death of Dr. Richard Hodgson, and it will not require here any
other statement to secure appreciation of the fact. It is most
important that his work should be taken up with the hope that
it may be continued. It will, therefore, be the object of this
circular to explain the plan which has been devised to carry out
298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1906.
that purpose. The plan was conceived before his death and it was
confidently expected that he would share in its execution. This
was fully understood and agreed to by Dr. Hodgson and the parties
organising the American Institute for Scientific Research. It was
not possible to make this public until the funds had been secured
to assure the plans of the Institute. The death of Dr. Hodgson
interrupted the execution of the plan.
Immediately following Dr. Hodgson's death a conference of some
of the officers and members of the Society for Psychical Research
resolved to postpone final action until the whole subject could be
gone over. It was at last decided as advisable by the Council of
the London Society to dissolve the American Branch in deference
to the plans of the American Institute and to encourage the
organization of an independent Society in the United States. This
does not preclude some form of harmonious co-operation which it
is hoped can be effected after the organization of the American
Society. To make the whole matter clear it will be necessary to
explain the nature and aims of the American Institute for Scientific
Research.
The American Institute for Scientific Research has been granted
a perpetual charter by the State of New York. Its primary aim
is to organize and subsidize investigations in Psychical Research and
Abnormal Psychology or Psychopathology. The Institute proper
will consist merely of a Board of Trustees; who shall act as
custodians and disbursers of the endowment funds. They will not
directly supervise investigations of any kind. They will only see
to it that individual men or bodies of men shall be qualified to
receive such aid as the Institute shall see fit to grant in behalf
of work under its protection. The American Society for Psychical
Research, which will be a section of the Institute, will be organized
as an independent body, with a separate Council, which will have
power to direct its affairs. The reason for the independent organi
zation of the Society in this manner is that it is most desirable to
have the work of psychic research and psychopathology conducted
wholly apart from each other, as the fields are more or less distinct.
The Institute is merely to protect both fields.
The Board of Trustees of the Institute has not been completed,
and will not be until an endowment is secured. Its present
members are Dr. James J. Putnam, Harvard University ; Dr. Minot
J. Savage, New York ; Dr. R. Heber Newton, Easthampton, N. Y. ;
Mr. C. Griswold Bourne, New York ; Mr. Charles N. Jones, New
York ; Mr. William S. Crandall, New York ; Mr. Miles Menander
Dawson, New York ; Mr. Charles L. Bogle, New York, and Dr.
James H. Hyslop, New York. The last five named persons are
the incorporators, and will resign from the Board as soon as it
has been properly completed.
JULY, 1906. American Institute far Scientific Research. 299
The Council of the American Society is also in process of formation.
Some time will be required to complete it. At present it comprises
the names of Professor W. Eomaine Newbold, of the University of
Pennsylvania; Professor H. Norman Gardiner, of Smith College,
Northampton, Mass. ; Professor W. R. Benedict, of the University
of Cincinnati ; Dr. Weston D. Bayley, of Philadelphia, and Dr.
James H. Hyslop, New York. Dr. James H. Hyslop has been
appointed Secretary and Treasurer.
All communications and inquiries regarding the Institute and the
American Society of Psychical Research should be addressed to Dr.
James H. Hyslop, 519 West 149th Street, New York.
JAMES H. HYSLOP. Secretary.
On receipt of this circular, Mr. Piddington wrote to Professor
Hyslop the following letter, which we print here in order
to forestall some possible misapprehensions :
18 COMMONWEALTH AVENUE,
BOSTON, June 2nd, 1906.
DEAR PROFESSOR HYSLOP,
I am much obliged to you for sending me a copy of
your circular. It contains, however, two sentences, in the second
paragraph, to which I must take exception, for they seem to me to
convey a wrong impression of the actual facts.
It is not in any sense correct to say that the Council decided to
dissolve the Branch " in deference to the plans of the American
Institute and to encourage the organization of an independent
Society in the United States." In the first place the Council
decided nothing— the decision was left to me ; and I thought it
advisable to dissolve the Branch for the two following reasons
only: (1) because no suitable successor to Dr. Hodgson was in sight,
(2) because it is desirable to lighten as far as possible the routine
work in England. "What is true is that the knowledge that the
dissolution of the Branch would not, in view of your scheme,
necessarily involve the abandonment of Psychical Research in
America, removed the one great objection to the policy of dissolution.
The word " encourage " in its immediate context is likewise mis
leading. With all my heart I wish your scheme every success, and
so, I am sure, do all my colleagues ; but I should have preferred to
describe our attitude toward your Institute as one of benevolent
neutrality, and the distinction between this benevolent neutrality
and the official endorsement of your scheme which the use of the
word "encourage" suggests, if it does not imply, should not be
overlooked.
If, as your Circular states, the Council dissolved the Branch in
deference to the plans of the American Institute, the members and
associates of the Branch would have a just cause of complaint, for
they might well ask why we should abandon an organization, which,
though perhaps not over-energetic, had at least managed to keep on
300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research JULT, 1906.
its legs for a good many years, simply in order to leave the field
dear for the development of a new organization still in embryo,
however vigorous its antenatal promise might be.
I propose, accordingly, with your permission, to insert your circular,
and in any case this letter or the substance of it, in the S.P.R.
Journal.—Yours sincerely, J. G. PIDDINGTON.
NOTICE TO MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN BRANCH.
MEMBERS and Associates of the American Branch who desire

CASES.
G. 280. Simultaneous.
IN the following case, four persons, all in different places,
experience independently in the course of about twelve hours
various impressions relating to a certain deceased person. Her
sister, Mrs. A., sees an apparition of her on the afternoon
of March 25th, 1906 ; Mrs. F., her mother, has a vivid
impression of her presence on the same evening ; a friend,
Mr. M., has a realistic dream of her during the night, March
25th-26th; and her aunt, Miss P., sees an apparition of her
early in the morning of March 26th.
It is obvious that no one of these impressions by itself
could be regarded as evidential of the agency of the deceased
person, but the fact of their all occurring together within so
short a period is certainly noteworthy. We have few, if any,
cases parallel to this in our records. Mr. Myers gives a few
cases of apparitions of dead persons seen collectively by two or
more percipients at once in Human Personality, Vol. II., pp. 62
and 375, and also one case, that of Baron von Driesen (op. cit.,
p. 40), where the apparition is seen on the same night by two
persons in different places, and a second, that of Mrs. Crans
(op. cit., p. 374), where one percipient has a vision corre
sponding to a dream of the other's.
One of the percipients in the present case, Mr. M., who is a
Member of the Society and well known to the Editor, brought
his account to her on April 23rd and discussed it fully in
conversation. Mrs. F. also called on her on May loth, and
kindly gave all possible information in answer to questions.
From both these interviews the Editor gathered that the inci
dents related were of a unique character in the experience of
the percipients, and more impressive than might perhaps be
supposed from their written statements. In connection with
the question whether the dream and apparitions might not have
been due to telepathy from one percipient to the other, rather
than to the agency of the deceased person, the vision of
Miss P. on March 19th is of interest, as there seems reason
for connecting it with the unexpressed desire of Mr. M. that
she should have such a vision.
The witnesses, whose names and addresses are in our
OCT., 1906. Cases. 303
possession, wish initials only to be printed. We give
first an account by Mr. M. written within a few days of the
occurrence : ., . . , nnc
1st, 1906.
I write the following and appended statement of my dream,
because of an apparent coincidence concerning it and what has
been mentioned to me by Mrs. F. since my telling it to her on
last Monday (March 26th).
Mrs. F. told me on 30th ult. that (a) her daughter, Mrs. A.,
had recently, while reclining on a sofa, seen her sister L., who
passed away in November last, and that (b) she herself (Mrs. F.) had
felt L. was with her on March 25th about 8.30 p.m. She also
mentioned that (c) her sister, Miss P., had seen L. in a kind of
vision when travelling. This would be on March 19th. Mrs. F.
told me of (a), (b), (c) for the first time on 30th ult, and said
that she had been impressed by the coincidences. I have asked
her to obtain statements from Mrs. A. and Miss P., and to write
a statement herself.
In reference to Miss P. seeing the vision, it is to be noted I
have not heard clear details of this, and that I have experienced
while in the train a remarkable vision of my friend L. Mrs. F.
and I were on March 19th seeing Miss P. off to Scotland, and a
little later I was hoping she would have a pleasant journey and
that L. would be able to give her the experience I got, or that she
might have it even as a corroboration of telepathy from (e.g.) me.
Statement about Dream.
About a week or 10 days ago [Mem. April 23/06.—I have every
reason to believe that the night of my dream referred to was that of
Sunday, March 25/06] I dreamt that I was in a sort of cellar with
other people, Mrs. F. being near me on my right. At my right
front was somewhat like the corner of a brick wall. There were
bricks in the structure of the cellar. This wall ran directly into
the background, but on the right there was space communicating
with where I was. I seemed to be at a spiritualist se'ance. A
form appeared in front of me—I was facing to the background-
but slightly to my right. As it became definite I said, "Why,
it's L. ! " She replied in a joyous lively way, " Of course it is."
She seemed absolutely natural, and the picture of health. The
complexion was of the pink of health. I made an exclamation
and my voice partly woke me up, and I knew that I was in bed.
Then I made some remark asking her to show herself to her mother.
304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906.
(I think I said, "Tell your mother.") Then I thought her mother
must see. (As I write now I believe L. said to this request, "No,
you," but I am not certain.) I think there was pink about her
dress. I noticed—or remember—the right shoulder specially : the
dress was loose.
The following report by the Editor of her interview with
Mr. M. was sent to him for revision and endorsement, and is
printed here as amended by him.
April 26th, 1906.
Mr. M. called on me on April 23rd and gave me verbally a some
what fuller account of the incidents described above. The young
lady of whom he dreamt, and whom he calls here "L.," had died
last November, at the age of about 18 ; she and all her family were
very intimate friends of his. Not long after her death, while
travelling and dozing with his eyes shut in the railway carriage, he
saw her face in a sort of mind's-eye vision. It appeared perfectly
distinct and life-like, and seemed to smile and look at him. The
eight startled him into complete wakefulness, and the vision im
pressed him a good deal, because it seemed to him quite unique
in his experience.1 He is normally not at all a good visualiser of
faces; but has had many vivid dreams at different times—sometimes
as vivid as reality.
He mentioned this incident to Mrs. F., L.'s mother, but he
believed that the rest of the family did not know of it. On March
19th last, he and Mrs. F. were at the station, seeing her sister,
Miss P., off for Scotland, and, remembering his own experience, he
hoped that a similar one might occur to her on the journey. This
wish was, of course, only expressed mentally ; he said nothing about
it either to Miss P. or to Mrs. F., and did not hear till some time
later from Mrs. F. that it had been fulfilled.
It was on the night of Sunday, March 25th, 1906, that his
dream took place. He himself has no doubt that this was the date,
though, from a desire to be scrupulously accurate in his statement,
he wrote on April 1st that it happened "about a week or ten days
ago." He went the next day, Monday, to call on Mrs. F., and told
her on that day of his dream. Mrs. F. states that on the following
morning (Tuesday), she heard from her sister of her experience on
1 Note by Mr. M.—After my at first becoming wakeful, I at once closed my
eyes, and saw the presentment several times, gradually at last more and more
faintly, and when I finally woke up I was quite dazed. It is as though it
had been from a very, very deep sleep.
OCT., 1906. Cases. 305
the Monday morning (March 26th) between 2 and 3 a.m. and on
the same evening (Tuesday) heard from her daughter that she had
seen L. on the Sunday afternoon. She also states that she herself
had felt L.'s presence on the Sunday evening. It thus appears that,
besides the less definite impression of Mrs. F., three persons had
had a vision or dream of L. within twelve hours of one another,
each having recorded or told it before knowing of the experience of
the others.
In Mr. M.'s dream he appeared to be in a sort of cellar or
underground room with a number of other persons, of whom Mrs. F.
was one, at a stance. (He is accustomed to attend stances, but is
not a spiritualist.) At his right front there was something like a
corner of two walls1 at right angles to each other, the direction of
one of them being straight away into the background, and the
other away towards the right. It was immediately in front of
him that the form of L, appeared. The form was extremely vivid
and life-like. He spoke to it, and the sound of his voice woke
him up sufficiently to realise that he was sitting up in bod. He
lay back, however, and at once succeeded in going to sleep again
and continuing the dream. He saw L. again and again she seemed
perfectly real and life-like. She smiled, and he heard her speak.
She moved her hands about as if to indicate something—he did
not know what; but after hearing of the experiences of his friends
he interpreted this movement to mean that she was trying to draw
his attention to her dress—a topic on which he is habitually in
observant—as a further mark of identity.
Mr. M. was at the time, before hearing of any coincidence with
this dream, strongly impressed with its exceptional character. It
seemed to carry with it, as to L., a clear sense of reality, involving
the absolute conviction that it was L. herself that he saw.
ALICE JOHNSON.
Mrs. F. writes :
April 20th, 1906.
I enclose [three] different statements which, I think, are very re
markable, as they all seemed to occur more or less about the same
date and all in different places. First of all, on the Monday after
he said it occurred, Mr. M. told me of his vision. Next morning I
heard from my sister, and same evening I received a letter from
my daughter describing her feelings when she thought she had seen
'Note by Mr. M.—I did not see these walls clearly—only inferred them.
The corner I did see.
306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906.
her sister. I myself felt her presence, but did not see anything, on
the Sunday evening as per my appended note.
The following were the statements enclosed :
(1) From Mrs. F.
On Sunday evening, March 25th, about 8.30, I was sitting alone.
I saw my daughter's photograph (who passed away in November).
I felt her presence but did not see anything.
I wrote the above on April 8th, 1906.
(2) From Miss P.
On Monday morning, 26th March, between one and two o'clock,
I saw L. in her grey dress trimmed scarlet. She smiled and was
gone. The first time was going home, March 19th. Some time in
the afternoon, before getting to Leeds, I was sitting with closed
eyes. She was in navy dress; she gave one of her laughs; I was
startled, opened my [eyes] and she was gone. You remember I was
alone, the day Mr. M. and you left me at St. Pancras ; I had the
carriage alone till I got to Hawick.
[Mrs. F. adds:]
This letter was received by me from my sister on April 5th in
response to a request by me that she would make a written state
ment of her dream.
(3) From Mrs. A.
April Wh, 1906.
I was lying on the sofa resting one Sunday afternoon, March
25th, when I seemed to see L. come into the room. She put her
head between the curtains with such a roguish smile on her face,
and then came striding in and sat down on a chair with her hands
on her knees in quite her old natural way. I was quite wide
awake, which made it seem all the more forcible, and really I felt
her presence so much that I sat up to speak to her. Immediately
afterwards I went to my bedroom and she was with me. Often
when I am alone she seems to be with me.
In reply to our enquiries, further statements were received
from Mrs. F., Miss P., and Mrs. A. as follows :
(1) From Mrs. F.
April 28th, 1906.
I am sorry to say I have not kept the letters [from my sister and
daughter] referred to. It was on Monday afternoon, March 26th,
Mr. M. told me of his dream. I remember so well he said, "last
OCT., 1906. Cases. 307
night I saw L. and she seemed so happy," etc. Yes, Mr. M. told
me of his vision he had while in a train. I never mentioned it
to any one. It was after I told him of my sister's vision while
in the train that he told me, when he said good-bye to her, that
he hoped she would have a similar one. No, my sister could not
have heard of his. . . .
(2) From Miss P., written on May 13th, 1906.
On March 19th I was travelling to Scotland. I was alone in the
carriage some time between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.
I closed my eyes for some time. While doing so L. appeared to
me. She wore her navy blue and looked just as she used to do.
She laughed, looked bright, and disappeared. A week later, on
March 26th, between one and two in the morning, I saw her again.
She was in grey with scarlet. She just looked at me in her old
way. I was awake but lying on my bed. I did not know [Mrs. A.]
and Mr. M. had also visions of her.
(3) From Mrs. A.
May 8th, 1906.
I will answer your questions just as you have asked them :
1. I was not asleep when I saw L. and my eyes were open.
2. The figure looked just like a real person—just the image of
L. in health, laughing and happy, with such a bright look in the
eyes.
3. When I sat up to sort of look, or rather speak, she simply
went.
4. She was, as far as I remember, in navy blue.
5. When I went to my room I only meant that I felt a continued
sense of her presence.
It is strange that Auntie, you, and I should have had the same
experience at the same time. It made a great impression on me
at the time. . .

THE following cases were obtained from Mrs. I), by Mr. J. G.

were given to us with the request to print only initials.

Verbatim copy by J. G. P. of note written by Mrs. D. on,
Saturday, January 27lit, 1900.
"Saturday, January 27th, 1900. This afternoon while I was
sitting near the fire talking to L., I was holding a small
photo, of Mrs. H. and describing her. 'Where is she now?' asked
L. ' In Rome/ I answered, ' settled for the winter.' And as I
spoke, suddenly I felt conscious of what she might be doing at the
time. 'Do you know,' I went on, 'I think she must be just
coming out of her room on to a high terrace such as we have
here, only that there is green over it.' L. did not say 'non
sense,' but just asked quietly: 'What is she wearing?' 'A black
skirt,' I answered, 'and a mauve blouse—she is looking out over
many roofs and spires—and now she has gone back into the room
and a maid is closing the shutters.' 'Can you see her room?'
asked L. 'I think it is small;' I said, 'there is a cottage-piano
and a writing-table near it. I think the large head of Hermes
stands on it and something silver.' And then I felt nothing more
and added, ' What nonsense I have been talking.' L. thinks
there may be some truth in the impression and wants me to write
and ask Mrs. H. what she remembers of this afternoon. It
was about six o'clock.
"I cannot say I saw anything; somehow I seemed to feel her sur
roundings were just so. I have never been to Rome, nor has she
told me anything of where she lives beyond the address."
Copy of extracts, selected by J. G. P. from a kttttr addressed by
Mrs. H. to Mrs. D. Postmark of envelope: "6 2 00 Roma"
February 5th, 1900.
" Two days ago, as I was dressing in the morning, I was
thinking of you. You had been so much in my thoughts for some
days that I had really worried, wondering if you were still ill,
or E. again. That morning as I awoke, thoughts of you came,
and I determined to write you as soon as I had had my coffee.
Imagine my surprise and delight, therefore, to receive your letter,
a letter so full of interest to me, that I have had no rest since
its arrival, in my great desire to answer it. I have really had no
moment to call my own. The two days since it came seem like
two weeks to me, for when one desires to do anything very much,
the time seems long, doesn't it ? [The writer then explains at
length why she had been prevented from writing for two days.] . . .
" You have certainly, however, filled much of my thoughts these
day[s],—and I have felt you in an extraordinary manner. You
OCT., 1906. Cases. 309
certainly have a power to visit your friends, and to see them, and
to make them feel you. Your letter is absolutely startling and
mysterious. And now I can answer it detail for detail, and item
for item. [The writer then avows her belief in telepathy and
clairvoyance.] . . . That you have peeped at me in my small
Eoman house is certainly a fact. As you state the facts, every
small detail is not altogether exact, but the facts as a whole are
true and exact and perfect, as you shall see. Your vision (if I
may call it so) is so true and marvellous that on Sunday last, the
4th, about 3 p.m. (that was yesterday) as I was looking from my
window in the salon with Mr. S., watching a great funeral of
one of Rome's best-loved Cardinals, I related your glimpse into
my house, and I could not help exclaiming : ' perhaps Madame
D. sees us now ... as we are standing here in our window.'
"Let me begin by answering bit by bit all you say. I have a
dear little vine-covered terrace, looking out into the Piazza di
Spagna, and looking also right up to the spires or rather towers
of S. Trinita dei Monti, with the great obelisk in front. The after
noon of Jan. 27th I returned to my home, after a walk and [after]
making a few purchases, at 5 p.m. I took off my fur jacquette,
and went at once into my dining-room to see about the dinner-table,
as three friends came [or, 'come'] at 7 p.m. to dine. I busied
myself about the table for some time, then stepped on to the
terrace (which is so pretty, but opens, unfortunately, from the
kitchen). I went into the terrace at that time to see about our
dessert for dinner, which I had put there to become cool. Then I
went back into the dining-room, and as the hanging-lamp had just
been lighted, I ordered the maid to drop the outside curtains. She
did so. I remember that I looked just then at the clock, and it
was 5.35 p.m. I had on a black skirt, a black silk blouse, and a
mauve tie, which twisted about my neck and hung in two ends to
my waist. It looked to you like a mauve blouse. Then I went
into our small salon and took something from the table. I remem
ber it distinctly. Our salon is very small; there is an upright
piano and a writing-table, on which are photos and books too, and a
lot of little silver things. Hermes (your photo to me) stands very
near, on another little table, quite near in fact. It is all quite
mysterious. I believe you have really peeped into my house." . . .
[The letter concludes with a detailed description of how the writer
spends her day ; the description being given in response to a request
from Mrs. D. In the course of it occur the following phrases] :
310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906.
"You fairly startled me when you tell me that our acquaintance
was made in just five days ! I had never counted it, and yet you
are perfectly right, it was just five days, and made up of bits of
time together and a few conversations. As I remember, you and
I really never had one moment actually by ourselves. . . . You
say truly that our intellectual friendship will have gone far ahead
of the personal. Then French-reading and my piano and zither I
bring in when a rainy day or spare moments offer. Tell me of
your day, do. . . ."
[At an interview on 1st May, 1905, Mrs. D. gave J. G. P. the follow
ing information, mostly in answer to his questions] :
At the time of the incident in question Mrs. H. was little
more than a hotel acquaintance. They had spent only 6 days
together at an hotel, and had since corresponded. Mrs. D. knew
Mrs. H. was a widow. When she had last seen her, Mrs. H. was
in 'slight mourning,' white and black, Mrs. D. thinks. She does
not remember to have seen her wearing mauve and black, or mauve
at all. From a subsequent letter addressed to Mrs. D. by Mrs. H.
it appears that the terrace was on a 3rd or 4th storey.
The head of Hermes was a gift to Mrs. H. from Mrs. D.
Mrs. D.'s note was made on the same evening as she received
the impression, and on Miss T.'s advice. The name of the friend—L.
—was Miss T. Miss T. is now dead.
Mrs. D. told J. G. P. that so far as she was aware, Mrs. H.
did not play the piano, and at any rate she (Mrs. D.) had no notion
she was musical. [See, however, the reference in Mrs. H.'s letter
to piano and zither.]
The above, written on 3rd May, 1905, is an expanded version of
notes made at interview on 1st May, 1905.

". . . You may imagine with what delight we received your
telegram [i.e. announcing birth of first baby]. . . . You must
know a very funny thing happened to me, and never again pooh-
pooh presentiments. I told C. and Miss and H. the very next
da}', so that they would not say it was my idea. On Thursday
last, after having gone to sleep, I awoke suddenly with a sensation
OCT., 1906. Cases. 311
of some one being in my room. I sat up in bed and I saw you
distinctly on a rocking-chair in a flannel loose blue dressing-gown.
You were sitting up on the chair: I mean not leaning back, but
stooping and rocking yourself as if in pain. It was so distinct that
I forgot I was not there, and being, I suppose, myself half-asleep,
said, ' Oh, J. has begun,' and was not frightened. Then you got
up and went to the sofa, lay down, and then again to the chair.
I then got so nervous, I got out of bed, went and washed my face
with cold water, and got to bed and went to sleep. But again I
awoke and da capo the same thing. That morning I told them that I
was sure you had had the baby, and was disappointed at not having
any news. I after[wards] forgot all about it, but when I heard
you had had labour pains on that identical night, I am sure every
thing happened just as I saw it, and that when I went to sleep,
so did you. Is it so ? Tell me exactly what you did : if you were
up, and if you sat on a rocking-chair and lay on the sofa, and if
you slept at intervals. Lately, too, I have been very very nervous,
and that may account for it, but see you I did as distinctly as
possible.
... I hope we shall soon have news about you, as I am very
anxious to hear particulars. . . ."
[On May 1, 1905, Mrs. D. told J. G. P. her sister knew of her
approaching confinement. The blue dressing-gown had been made a
few days before specially for the confinement, and her sister could
not have known about it. In all respects Mrs. C.'s hallucination
corresponded with the real facts.]
Mr. Piddington adds :
Mrs. D. is a quite first-class witness ; a sensible, clear-headed woman,
and most careful not to overstate things. She has "clear" dreams
like those described by Dr. van Eeden,1 of which she has for many
years kept a careful record, made in nearly every, if not in every,
instance the day after the dream. These records I have read, and
they give one the same favourable impression of her sincerity and
honesty and exactness as does her conversation. The dreams are
remarkable rather for their lifelike character, in which they are
quite distinct from her ordinary dreams, than for their veridicality,
but some are veridical, though not evidentially strong. In these
dreams she has long and perfectly rational conversations with dead
friends and relations, whom in her dream she knows to be dead.

Mrs. D. afterwards sent Mr. Piddington the following
statement :
May 26lh, 1905.
According to your expressed desire I write to tell you that the
details of my sister's dream or vision, contained in her letter of
the 14th December, 1884, corresponded exactly with the facts, my
daughter having been born on the 30th of November of the same
year, just as my sister saw it happening.
P. 278. Dream.
THE following case of a premonitory dream recorded 19 days
after its occurrence was obtained from Mr. E. J. Bowring,
of Westcroft, Lovelace Road, Ditton Hill, Surrey. Mr. Piddington
called on Mr. and Mrs. Bowring on February llth, 1906,
and wrote the accounts, which were to a great extent given
independently, from their dictation, the accounts being after
wards signed by them.
Mr. Bowring states :
February llth, 1906.
In the night of 23-24 January, 1906, I dreamt a vivid dream
that my wife's goldfinch lay stretched on the water with the wings
outspread. I was in the act of opening the door of the aviary in
the hope of saving it, and I had just got hold of it when I awoke.
I related the circumstance to my wife the same morning before
getting up.
This dream differed from others which I frequently have, inasmuch
as it was not connected with any other incident. It was a single
incident standing out by itself.
EDWD. J. BOWRING.
Mrs. Bowring states :
February lllh, 1906.
On the morning of January 24, my husband said to me on
waking " I have had a very vivid dream about your goldfinch.
I saw him lying dead in the pond with the wings out." On
going downstairs into the conservatory, as usual, I naturally looked
anxiously at the pond, and was agreeably surprised to find that all
was well.
Although relieved, I did not feel reassured ; and so the next
morning was not at all surprised, on going into the conservatory,
to see the bird lying dead. The bird was lying dead in the little
pond with his wings outstretched. Other birds of mine which have
OCT., 1906. Cases. 313
died have died with the wings closed ; though others have fallen
dead near the pond.
I have ten or eleven in my aviary, but only one goldfinch. The
goldfinch was a special favourite. There had been no conversation
nor incident which, so far as I can trace, could have suggested the
dream. To the best of my belief the bird was in good health.
He had made a complete recovery from his autumn moulting.
FLORINE BOWRING.
THE CUEE OF WARTS BY SUGGESTION.
FROM time to time we have printed in the Journal cases of
the apparent curing of warts by suggestion,1 and we would
remind our readers that this is a subject on which some of
them may have opportunities of experimenting, or of getting
experiments tried under proper supervision. We give here
two cases of recent occurrence. A member of the Society,
Mr. L. C. Powles, writes as follows :
February '2(Uh, [1905].
... A friend of mine (Mrs. Barry) tells me that she succeeded
in charming away the warts from the hand of the lady superintendent
of an asylum, the latter having for years been unavailingly operated
upon by the doctors there.
It seems a good case, as neither of them had any faith in the
cure, though Mrs. Barry had once seen a successful instance of it,
and merely followed the formula of that case—I think it was to
bury a needle secretly and the warts were to disappear in six
weeks. It seems they began to die away at once, and in eight
weeks were permanently cured. It occurred 1£ years ago.
Mrs. Barry has written out her statement, and says she has no
doubt the lady superintendent will give full corroboration.
The two letters written at the time of cure by the latter have
been kept, but are at present stored. L. C. POWLES.
In reply to our request for further evidence, Mr. Powles
kindly obtained for us statements from the two ladies con
cerned, which were enclosed in a letter from himself dated
March 27th, 1905. Mrs. Barry wrote:
In the summer of 1903 I was staying in a country house in
Berkshire. Amongst the guests was a Miss B., the lady super
1 See especially Journal, Vol. viii. pp. 7 and 226 ; Vol. ix. pp. 100 and 225 ;
and Vol. xi. p. 273.
314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906.
intendent of a home for high-class patients in connection with a
large private asylum. I noticed that her hands were covered with
warts, and one day she told me that they were a great worry to
her, and had been for two years. All the doctors at the asylum,
she said, had tried one after the other to cure them, and she had
tried many remedies, and been through a good deal of suffering,
but in vain ; the warts were immoveable.
I had previously been telling my hostess a curious case I had
lately heard of some warts being " charmed " away, and she was
so much impressed that she begged me to try myself, and see if
I could not "charm" her guest's warts. At first I only laughed
at the idea, and said it was most unlikely I possessed any such
power, and treated it all as a joke ; but the day on which Miss
B. was to end her visit, my hostess once more begged me at all
events to try.
Just to put an end to the matter, and more in fun than anything
else, I gave Miss B. a needle in a piece of paper, repeating
the formula that I had heard when I was told of the cure that
had aroused my hostess's interest. I said—" Take this needle, and
keep it safely ; do not break it, do not lose it ; do not mention it
to any one." She put it away in her purse, saying, " How long
do you give me before they go ? " " Six weeks," I said—just because
I had to mention some time; not that I had any idea that the
warts would disappear at all.
I had forgotten all about the matter, when two months after
wards Miss B. wrote to me, saying she did not know how to
thank me enough for having cured her. She had waited until
the complete disappearance of the warts before writing, so as to
be able to tell me that they were entirely gone. They had begun
to die away soon after she saw me.
I told a young doctor about this surprising letter, and he said
he thought I ought not to claim the cure until I knew what other
influences might have been at work, and furnished me with a list
of searching questions : Had there been any fresh water supply to
her house ? Had she been away for change of air, and become
strengthened 1 Had she used a different kind of soap? Had she
taken any medicines or tried any remedies after seeing me ; and
so on. She wrote back a very full reply in answer to all these
questions, and the answer to each one was absolutely satisfactory ;
no circumstances had arisen to point to any other possible source
of cure.
OCT., 1906. The Cure of Warts by Suggestion. 315
I much regret that I have had no further opportunity of testing
my influence, and cannot at all understand how my "charm" suc
ceeded in curing Miss B. ELLEN MONTAGUE BARRY.
Miss Barrett's statement was as follows :
March l\th, 1905.
I have heard from Mrs. Barry that you would like my account
of the wonderful way in which my warts have disappeared.
In the spring of 1901 I had one wart on the back of my left
hand which I tried to burn off with many different acids, all to
no purpose; instead of the one being cured they came thick over
the backs of both hands and were a source of great annoyance.
I tried all manner of things for about 12 months, all warranted
absolute cures, with no result except that they seemed to get bigger.
Then I gave. up in despair and left them absolutely alone.
In the summer of 1903 I met Mrs. Barry and she offered to
charm them away, saying she had never done such a thing before,
but had heard of it (or seen it done, I forget which). I think we
both took the whole thing as a joke. However, she performed
the charm, and within two months there was not a wart on either
hand, nor have I had one since. She did not touch them in any
way, but one of the conditions was not to tell any one what she
had said or done.
I cannot get you any statement from the medical officers of the
institution, as the one then in attendance on the staff has left and
gone abroad.
On account of Mrs. Barry's being abroad, she was unable
to procure for us Miss Barrett's letters, written to her at the
time of the cure ; and the lady in whose house the experiment
was made declined to give us any statement about it. No
further evidence therefore has been obtainable.
The second case came from an Honorary Associate of the
Society, Mr. J. F. Young of Llanelly, who wrote :
BRYNTESOG VILLA, NEW ROAD, LLANELLY,
Auffusi Hth, 1904.
I have an interesting case of the " charming away " of warts, of
which I will send you a full report if you think it will be of
sufficient interest to your Society.
In short it is this. At a certain establishment in this town where
several young ladies are employed, most of whom are troubled with
warts, I suggested that I should take the worst case and charm
316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1906
them away. This I did, getting her first to count them. I called
again in a fortnight, and to my surprise they had all vanished. . .
Further information was given in later letters from Mr.
Young, as follows:
August, 29/A, 1904.
Mrs. Mary Jane Roberts, of Pottery Street, Llanelly, has a daughter
about 14 years of age, employed by the "Domestic Bazaar Co.,
Llanelly." Her hands were covered with warts of various size*,
some in groups. She has suffered from them this last 12 months,
and various remedies have been tried without success.
Knowing the young lady, and after reading the case of "wart
charming" in the July number of Journal of the S.P.R., I re
quested her to let me charm them away, to which she willingly
consented, with the result already made known to you. She had
41 on both hands. There is no sign up to date of any reappearance.
J. F. YOUNG.
September llth [1904].
Re warts. I now reply to your several queries.
The suggestion was first made to me that I should charm them,
and carried out, on July 29th. I told her then that they would
disappear in 11 days. I called on August 13th, and found they
were entirely gone.
As to method of charming, I looked at warts intently, both hands
being spread out, willing all the time that they should go away,
and 11 days came to my mind.
Having practised mesmerism and hypnotism for 45 years, the
faculty of willing has been educated, and I thought its use in this
case would be the most effective. I did not see her from July 29th
until August 13th. Occupation of young lady : Cashier and assistant
in the "Domestic Bazaar Co., Stepney Street, Llanelly."
J. F. YOUNG.
A series of questions addressed to Miss Roberts elicited
the information that she had had 41 warts on her hands,
and had had them for about 1 5 months ; that she had seen a
doctor who put on " acid " ; that she did not remember exactly
when Mr. Young had begun to " charm " them nor when
they began to get better, nor when they had all disappeared ;
that there had been no recurrence of them ; that she had
never heard of " charming " for warts before. Mr. Young
wrote on September loth, 1904, that he had just seen her
again and the cure seemed complete so far.

L. 1153. Apparition.
THE following account was received by Mrs. Sidgwick from a
lady who has been intimately known to her all her life.
Fictitious initials are substituted for the real names, all of
which are in our possession. The account was enclosed in a
letter to Mrs. Sidgwick, dated March 7th, 1905. The per
cipient, Miss R., was in London at the time of her vision, the
person whose apparition was seen being in a remote country
district on an estate belonging to Miss R's brother.
March 7th, 1905.
On the night of Saturday, March 4th, or rather, early morning
of March 5th [1905] I awoke and sat up to reach for something on
the table beside my bed. The room was not dark, as the curtains
were drawn back, and the blinds were up, and there are some strong
lights in the street outside. As I sat up all seemed dark except
that I saw a face for a second, and the same face a little further to
the right and a little lower down, also for a second. I am not sure
whether I saw the two faces (which were exactly the same) at the
same moment or one just after the other, but I think the sight
of them overlapped. The faces were of Mrs. J. W., who lives at the
village at home. I only saw her head, all else being swallowed in
•darkness. I noticed her black cap, without any white, which she
318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.
always wears. Her face was not strongly illuminated, and wore
her usual expression. There was no appearance of life or action
about it.
I was sufficiently struck by this to say to myself that I would
write to you next morning about it, so that if there was any
coincidence about it you would have evidence beforehand. I also
turned over to the other side of my bed, took up the watch standing
there and noticed the time by it was 4.19 a.m. As this watch was
5 minutes fast by "Big Ben," the real time must have been just
4.14 a.m. Unluckily when I woke next moruing the whole thing
went clean out of my recollection, and I never thought of it again
till this morning (March 7th), when I received a letter from Mrs. N.
[wife of the clergyman at Miss R.'s country home], dated March
6th, who among other things wrote as follows :
"Poor old J. W. at the village died yesterday morning early.
He has been ill for a long time." (She then goes on to speak of a
nurse having been sent to him.)
When I got Mrs. N.'s letter this morning (7th), I could not
remember whether the face I had seen was on the night of Saturday
4th (morning of 5th) or on the night of Sunday 5th (morning of
Monday 6th). I am, however, now pretty confident it was the
former, for this reason.
On Friday evening 3rd, I had a committee here, and they said
my clocks were all wrong. I replied that I had never heard Big
Ben strike all the time I had been ill, so did not know the time
when I set the clocks going again. Next night I did hear Big Ben,
and noticed this because of the conversation the night before.
When I heard it I looked at the watch beside my bed and noticed
that it was 5 minutes fast.
J. W. had been ill some time before I left home (I left on
February 8th), but for some time before I left he had been much
better, and was I believe out of bed every day. I had heard nothing
of the W.'s since leaving home, and had no idea that he had been
ill again. The only moment that I am aware of when the W.'s
were in my mind was several days ago, when I was putting away
my 1904 bills and noticed Mrs. W.'s bill for sweets for the school
children among them.
Mrs. N.'s letter containing the sentence quoted above was
enclosed with this account. Miss R in replying to it sent
Mrs. N. on March 9th, 1905, the following questions, without
telling her till afterwards why she asked them.
Nov., 1906. Cases. 319
( 1 ) What was the exact hour and minute at which J. W. died ?
(2) Did either J. W. or Mrs. W. say anything during the few
hours, just before or just after his death, which showed that they
were thinking of me, or of themselves in relation to me?
(3) If so, what was said, and by whom ?
(4) At what time was it said?
(5) Does Mrs. W. recollect thinking of me during those hours, or
was I at all in her thoughts ?
(6) If yes, what were her thoughts in regard to me f
(7) At what time was she thinking of me ?
The following is Mrs. N.'s reply.
March 21s/, 1905.
... I have asked Mrs. D. W.,1 who is a great deal with
Mrs. W., to try to get the answers to your questions, as Dr.
N. and I both thought that would be better than our doing
it. Mrs. W. is rather easily confused and might have been
fussed and put out by us, whereas I think Maggie will be more
able to get clear answers from her.
J. died at 2.50 a.m. on Sunday, 5th March. I understand
that he never spoke after midnight, and that previously he was
wandering a good deal and often what he said could not be under
stood. Maggie was there all that night and as far as she could
tell he said nothing about you. Mrs. W. had often spoken of
your great kindness to them and she had said, Maggie thinks on
that Sunday morning, that if she was spared to see you she would
like to ask you to accept her corner cupboard. That is all that I
have so far found out. . . .
Mrs. N. wrote later:
March 24th, 1905.
I went to see Mrs. J. W. yesterday, but Mrs. H. was with
her so I could ask her no questions. In the evening Mrs. D. W.
came to see me and she told me that when quite alone with her
mother-in-law she asked her your questions. Apparently nothing
could be remembered that J. had said, but on the Sunday morning
after his death, after D. had left, Mrs. W. and Maggie and B. were
sitting together (between 4 and 5 a.m.) and Mrs. J. W. spoke a
good deal about you, spoke of the corner cupboard as I told you
before, spoke of your great kindness to them. ... At that time
also Mrs. W. had recalled a conversation she had had with J. in
1 Mr. J. W.'s daughter-in-law— called Maggie below.
320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV.,
the autumn about your kindness, and they also spoke of your last
visit and of your speaking to J. and saying that you hoped he
would be better when you returned. That is all Maggie could
find out. She thinks that perhaps B. might be able to recall
other things said, but what I have written seems to be the
substance of the conversation.
Mrs. Sidgwick, who saw Miss E. soon after receiving the
account and discussed the case fully with her, writes :
NEWNHAM COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.
On March 8th, 1905, I received from [Miss R] a letter dated
March 7th, 1905, enclosing an account, also dated March 7th, 1905,
of her experience of seeing the face of Mrs. J. W., and a sketch
of a face as seen.1 J. W. was an old man who had long beeH a
ploughman on the home farm at . He had had to retire on
account of failing health, and the small shop and post office of the
parish, with house attached (which, with the school and the black
smith's and two other houses forms the whole of what is called
"the village,") becoming vacant, Mr. R. let the W.'s have it rent
free, and Mrs. W. ran the little shop, where sweets and needles
and thread and postage stamps could be bought.
[Miss R.J told me that whereas the room was certainly not
dark when she saw the face, and whereas all seemed dark except
the face, it has occurred to her that her eyes may have been
shut; but she has no other evidence of this.
It will be noticed that though [Miss R.] unfortunately made no
written note of what she had seen before she heard of the death,
the evidence that the vision occurred between 4 and 5 a.m., and
that the conversation about [her] also occurred between 4 and 5
a.m. is quite independent.
Miss R. adds :
March 24tt, 1905.
In regard to the appearance of the face of Mrs. J. W. to me in
the night of March 4th, at 4.14 a.m., I wish to say that to the
best of my belief I have never seen an appearance of any similar
kind before.
It will be observed that this case differs from the ordinary
type of veridical hallucinations coinciding with deaths in that
1 Thia sketch of two faces was sent to us with the account, but is not
reproduced here, as it was only intended to indicate the relative positions of
the two faces when seen.—ED.
Nov., 1906. Cases. 321
the person whose apparition was seen was not the one who
was dying at the time. Four cases of this type were included
in the Census of Hallucinations (see pp. 259-263 of the
" Report on the Census of Hallucinations," in Proceedings,
Vol. X.). One of these was published in Phantasms of the
Living, Vol. I., p. 357. Here the percipient sees in the
night an apparition of a friend who tells her that his mother
is dead, and she hears next morning that the death had
taken place that night in the son's presence. In another
case (Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 260) the apparition of a man who
was actually at his mother's death-bed was seen in a church,
during the morning service. In a third case, that of Miss
Hawkins-Dempster (Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 261) the apparition
of a man was seen in her drawing room in the evening at
the time of his mother's death, of which he could not have
known by any normal means, as he was then in South
America.
These cases are of considerable theoretical interest from
several points of view. They tell strongly against the primi
tive materialistic view that in persons in some abnormal
conditions, such as trance or coma, there is a sort of
dissociation or looseness of connection between soul and body,
so that the soul " projects " itself in a visible form—the
" astral form " of Theosophists—as in that case, the apparition,
if recognisable at all, must obviously represent the dying
person. On the other hand, as pointed out in the discussion
of them in the " Report on the Census of Hallucinations,"
(op. cit., p. 260),
Such cases need present no difficulty on the telepathic theory.
Indeed it may be rather said that the absence of any cases of
the kind would render the theory improbable. They raise the
question, however, who the "agent"—the person, that is, from
whom the telepathic communication comes—is, in hallucinations
coinciding with a death. Usually it seems natural to assume that
it is the dying person, and in some cases—as we have seen in
Chapter xii.—this view is supported by evidence that the dying
person's thoughts were specially directed to the percipient. The
mere fact, however, that the apparition represents a particular
person does not prove that that person was the agent. It is
possible for an agent to transfer to a percipient an image of some
322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1906.
third person, and it is possible for a percipient to embody an
impression telepathically received in a form suggested by his own
mind and not by the agent's. As an instance where it seems
improbable that the person whose figure was seen was the agent,
see Mrs. M'Alpine's vision of her baby nephew at the time 'of
its death (printed at p. 281). It seems more likely in this case
that the agent was some one with the child, than the child itself,
aged six months. In one of the death coincidences quoted in
Chapter xii. (p. 223), there is some reason for thinking that the
agent was the sister who telegraphed the news rather than the
decedent ; because (1 the hallucination nearly coincided in time
with the despatch of the telegram, while it occurred some hours
after the death, and (2) it foretold the arrival of the telegram.
In regard to the case of Miss Hawkins-Dempster referred
to above, the " Eeport " observes that
the fact that the person whose figure was seen can hardly by any
normal means have known of his mother's death at the time of
the hallucination makes it difficult to suppose that he was the
agent, without a telepathic hypothesis so complicated as to be
extremely improbable. . . . The apparition followed the death by
some hours ; so that, if Mrs. H. [the mother] was the agent, the
telepathic impression must either have remained latent for some
time, or have been produced by the agent after death.
It will be observed that in the case of Miss K. the
apparition was seen rather more than an hour after the
death, and, as in the first two Census cases referred to above,
the person seen had been present at the death, and had also
been talking of Miss K. afterwards, so that it would be easy
to regard her as the " agent."
L. 1154. Collective Apparition.1
THE following is a striking case of an apparition at the time
of death seen by three different persons, but in different .places
and independently of one another. Collective cases of this
type are considerably rarer than those in which the percipients
1 This case was published in the English Mechanic and World of Science for
July 20th, 1906, and quoted thence in an article by M. Camille Flammarion
in the Annalx of Psychical Science for October, 1906. The more complete
account here printed was sent to us independently and included the originals
ai all the corroborative letters and documents. —ED.
NOV., 1906. Cases. 323
have been all together in the same place (for some instances
of the former, see Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., pp. 173
et seq.). Mr. Gurney in his discussion of collective hallucina
tions in that book, Chap, xviii., points out (op. dt., p. 172)
that in such cases one may suppose that each hallucination
is due to a telepathic impulse from the distant agent, rather
than derived by the percipients telepathically from each other,
as may be supposed when they are all in company together.
These cases also, like that of Miss E. given above, tend against
the " projection " theory (according to which the apparition
has some relation to space) and in favour of the telepathic
theory (according to which the mind of the percipient alone
is affected).
The first account comes from the Rev. Charles L. Tweedale,
F.R.A.S., who writes :
WESTON VICARAGE, NR. OTLEY,
YORKSHIRE, July 2«A, 1906.
On the night of January 10th, 1879, I had retired early to rest.
I awoke out of my first sleep to find the moon shining into my
room. As I awoke my eyes were directed towards the panels of a
cupboard, or wardrobe, built into the east wall of my room, and
situated in the north-east corner. I watched the moonlight on the
panels. As I gazed I suddenly saw a face form on the panels of
the cupboard or wardrobe. Indistinct at first, it gradually became
clearer until it was perfectly distinct as in life, when I saw the face
of my grandmother. What particularly struck me at the moment
and burnt itself into my recollection was the fact that the face wore
an old-fashioned frilled or goffered cap. I gazed at it for a few
seconds, during which it was as plain as the living face, when it
faded gradually into the moonlight and was gone. I was not
.alarmed, but, thinking that, I had been deceived by the moonlight
and that it was an illusion, I turned over and went off to sleep
again. In the morning when at breakfast I began telling the experi
ence of the night to my parents. I had got well into my story,
when, to my surprise, my father suddenly sprang up from his seat
at the table and leaving his food almost untouched hurriedly left
the room. As he walked towards the door I gazed after him in
amazement, saying to mother, "Whatever is the matter with father?"
•She raised her hand to enjoin silence. When the door had closed
I again repeated my question. She replied, " Well, Charles, it is
324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.
the strangest thing I ever heard of, but when I awoke this morning
your father informed me that he was awakened in the night and
saw his mother standing by his bedside, and that when he raised
himself to speak to her she glided away." This scene and conver
sation took place at about 8.30 a.m. on the morning of January
llth. Before noon we received a telegram announcing the death of
my father's mother during the night.
We found that the matter did not end here, for my father was
afterwards informed by his sister that she also had seen the appari
tion of her mother standing at the foot of her bed.
Thus, this remarkable apparition was manifested to three persons
independently. My apartment, in which I saw the vision, was at the
other side of the house to that occupied by my parents, and was
entirely separate and apart from their room, while my father's sister
was nearly 20 miles away at Heckmondwike.
My father noted the time as 2 a.m. but I did not take note of
the time, but have since been able to ascertain it closely in the
following way. The house at Crawshawbooth, in which we lived at
the time, faces due south and the window of the apartment faces
also due south. On the night of January 10-11, 1879, the moon
was on the meridian at 14 hours 19 minutes Greenwich Mean Time,
i.e. 2 hours 19 minutes, a.m., on January llth. When on the
meridian the moon illuminates the back and the east and west walls
of the apartment. I am certain that the east wall of the room was
illuminated (for there I saw the face in the moonlight) and also the-
back of the room, or north wall. The moon was therefore approxi
mately on the meridian and the time close on 2 a.m., thus confirming
my father's observation in a remarkable and unexpected manner.
The death of my grandmother took place at 12.15 a.m., and it is
certain from the above considerations that the apparition to myself
and my father occurred nearly two hours after death.
My father died in 1885, but my mother is living and well
remembers all the details. Her confirmatory letter [is given below].
In the case of the apparition to my aunt, this did not take place
until upwards of eighteen hours after the death, but this is best told
in the words of my uncle, whose confirmatory letter, together with
that of my mother, accompanies this account [and is also given
below].
In the apparition to me, what particularly struck me and burnt
itself into my memory was the goffered cap around the face. I made
no attempt to verify this at the time, but specially mentioned it to
Nov., 1906. Case*. 325
my parents. Some weeks ago, when I set to work to verify these
details, I wrote to my uncle sending him a sketch of what I saw.
His reply [to this point is included in the letter quoted below].
I may say that I have never previously communicated with my
uncle upon this subject and I had not seen my grandmother for
some years previous to her appearance to me.
It is absolutely certain that the apparition occurred to each of the
three independent witnesses after the death and that this case is-
therefore an unmistakeable instance of apparitions of the dead and
proof that the personality survives. I am prepared at any time to-
make this statement on oath.

In a letter dated May 14th, 1906, in which Mr. Tweedale-
gave us a preliminary account of this experience, he says that
he was at the time a boy of about 15 years of age, living at
home with his parents, " a healthy boy, given up to a lad's
usual pursuits, and thinking of nothing so little as the super
natural." In regard to the hour of his experience, as deduced
from his recollection of the position of the moon at the time,
he sends us a postcard from the Eoyal Astronomical Society,
Burlington House, London, W., dated June 23rd, 1906, con
firming his statement given above that on the night of January
lOth-llth, 1879, the moon was on the meridian at 14 hours
19 minutes, Greenwich mean time, that is, 2.19 a.m. on
January llth, Civil time.
In a letter dated October 26th, 1906, Mr. Tweedale sends
us a funeral card stating that " Sarah Ann (widow of the
late Benjamin Tweedale, of Uppermill, Saddleworth) . . ,
died on the llth January, 1879, aged 72 years, and was this
day interred at Saddleworth Church. 15th January, 1879."
He also says, in answer to our questions, that his father knew
of his grandmother's illness ;
But as far as I remember, he was not under the impression
that the illness was serious ; certainly none of us thought of a
fatal ending. I was at that age when one does not think seriously
about these things. I am afraid the matter did not trouble me at
all, for I had only seen Grandmother two or three times in my
whole life ... I had heard my parents say [she] was ill, that
was all. . . .
326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.
Now, as to the cap. I believe it was the fashion with old ladies
some thirty years ago to wear caps. I may have seen Grandmother
Tweedale in a cap, but have no recollection (definite) of this. I
liad not seen Grandmother for some years (2—3) at the time of
the apparition. . . .
The following are the letters from Mr. Tweedale's mother
And uncle which were enclosed with his own account :
VICTOR PLACK, CRAWSHAWBOOTH, NR. RAWTENSTALL,
LANCASHIRE, June 22nd, 1906.
I have carefully read my son's account of the strange appearance
to him and my late husband, Dr. Tweedale. I perfectly well
remember the matter, my son telling us of what he had seen and
my husband telling me of the apparition to him, also the telegram
informing us of the death during the night.
I distinctly remember my husband also being informed by his
.sister of the appearance to her.

SHEFFIELD, June 16th, 1906.
DEAR NEPHEW,
With reference to the matters connected with the death
-of Grandma Tweedale, I have great pleasure in giving you the
following particulars.
I can vouch for the truth of these details, as she died at my
house in Heckmondwike on Saturday morning, January llth, 1879,
At 12.15 a.m. She was dying all day on Friday, Januar}- 10th,
and passed away soon after midnight as above stated according to
the entry in my diary made at the time.
Between my wife and her mother a very close affection existed
and by a strange fate they both were confined to bed at the same
time, the daughter daily expecting the birth of her child and
the mother sick with what proved to be her last illness. The
situation was a very pathetic one, as my wife only saw her mother
•once when I carried her helpless in my arms to her mother's bed
side. When Grandma died, by the doctor's orders the news of her
death was carefully kept from my wife, as it was feared that the
•consequences might be serious in her critical condition. She was
therefore, at the time when the apparition passed her vision,
absolutely ignorant of the fact that her mother had already passed
.away.
NOV., 1906. Cases. 327
On Saturday night she was left alone for a short time and
during the time the nurse and doctor were out of the room, the
apparition appeared to her, when she saw her mother standing at
the foot of the bed. The figure beholding her distress spoke to
her and simply said "don't fret" and then immediately vanished.
This would be upwards of eighteen hours after Grandma had
passed away, my wife being then in total ignorance of her mother's
•death. Afterwards my wife said that she was not afraid, but on
the other hand she was greatly comforted. I and my daughter
•well remember her relating this experience to us in after life.
You ask me if the sketch you sent of the frilled cap seen by
you is correct. Yes, remarkably so, and reproduces exactly the cap
worn by your Grandmother Tweedale all the time she was ill in bed,
and in which she died, so that your description of what you saw
of her fully represents her appearance at the time she passed away.
The above is a plain statement of the whole matter, and I can
vouch for the truth of every particular, and shall be ready if
required to affirm the same on oath.
(Signed) JOSHUA HODGSON.
56 PARSONAGE CRESCENT, WALKLY, SHEFFIELD.
DEAR NEPHEW,
You will be surprised when I inform you that I also
saw the same apparition some 20 years after it appeared to you.
I made a note of it at the time. The incident was so startling
that the whole scene at this moment is vividly engraven on my
memory.
On the evening of Friday, July 29th, 1898, my wife was very
busy with her household affairs, when I sat up with her smoking
and reading until I fell asleep. I remained in this condition until
long after midnight. When I awoke and opened my eyes, I was
astonished to see two figures before me, my wife in her chair asleep,
and another figure in white above her. I instinctively raised my
eyes to the face of the top figure and behold ! it was the face of
her mother ; in an instant it had vanished leaving my wife still
asleep in her chair quite unaware of the vision I had just witnessed.
I thought it prudent not to mention the matter to her at the
moment for fear of upsetting her, and did not inform her of
this remarkable incident for several months after, but I must
•confess that during that time I had an uneasy foreboding that it
•was prognostic of future trouble. My wife died on March 18th,
328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1906.
1900, a little more than eighteen months after I had seen her
mother's form standing over her. A few days before she passed
away she told us that she could see her mother and her favourite
soji (who had passed away about seventeen months before) waiting
and beckoning for her. After this she could say no more and was
unconscious to the end.
Although I alone saw the vision in this instance, it certainly
helps to confirm the very remarkable previous appearance to the
three of you. . . .
I am writing a separate account of this, so as to keep it distinct
from the other. (Signed) JOSHUA HODGSON.
Mr. Tweedale also sent us an interesting account published
in the English Mechanic and World of Science for September
1st, 1905, of a premonitory dream of the discovery of the
comet Barnard-Hartwig (1886). He awoke one morning about
4 a.m. from a very vivid dream of a comet in the morning
sky, i.e. in the east, rising before the sun. He was so much
impressed that he at once dressed and went out to a small
platform upon which he used his 8£ in. reflector. He put
this into position and prepared to sweep for the comet, nothing
being visible to the naked eye. He set the instrument at
random, at an altitude of about 30°, and slowly swept it across
the sky, using a low-power eye-piece, and during the first
sweep the comet came into the field of view. He intended
to despatch a telegram announcing his discovery as soon as
the post-office opened, but by the first post received a paper
in which was published the information that the comet had
already been discovered by Barnard and the night afterwards
by Hartwig. The dream may therefore be explained as tele
pathic rather than premonitory in the strict sense of the word.
CORRESPONDENCE.
MR. GROTTENDIECK'S POLTERGEIST.
I.
RACKETTS, HYTHE, HANTS.,
July 3Qth, 1906.
... If it is not too late to offer further comments on the case
recorded in the Journal under the headiug "Mr. Grottendieck's
Poltergeist," I should like to call attention again to it as an
Nov., 1906. Correspondence. 329
admirable illustration of a principle which is very generally ignored
both by psychical researchers and by scientific psychologists. The
things we see are not images on the retina. They are only things
which we infer to " be there," in consequence, in most cases (but
not in all1), of sensations transmitted to consciousness from the
retina. These sensations may be sufficiently numerous and detailed
to justify the inference completely, or at any rate sufficiently, for
the purpose in hand. But more often even a cursory examination
reveals the fact that the actual data upon which onr visual
impressions are based are very scanty, and the impressions them
selves are filled in by imagination, which is the result of
experience.
For example, Mr. Grottendieck says (Journal, May, 1906, p. 263)
" I saw quite distinctly that they came right through the ' kadjang.' "
I remember a similar statement in an account of a spiritualistic
seance, a witness stating that he heard a bell come through the
wall from the next room, ringing all the time !
A moment's thought would have convinced Mr. Grottendieck
that no retinal image or succession of retinal images could have
recorded the passage of stones through the kadjang ; he can only
have (unconsciously) inferred that the stones passed through from
the fact that he was not aware of any retinal image representing
them coming up to the ceiling from the boy's hand (or wherever
they did come from). But I do not wish to imply that Mr.
Grottendieck made an erroneous inference from the evidence of
his senses. He doubtless did " see distinctly " what he describes—
the act of seeing was itself the unconscious inference. So also the
witness at the spiritualistic seance was doubtless quite correct in
«aying that he heard (i.e. had an auditory sense-perception of) the
bell coming through the wall. The sense perception included all
that, though the auditory sensation was not sufficient logically to
justify it—any more than some point de repere in a crystal justifies
a crystal vision.
What I have said about sense perceptions in general is capable
of most striking illustration in the case of perceptions of motion.
It is a mistake to which psychologists are liable to attempt to
always explain visual illusions of motion by unconscious ocular
movements. There is for example no reason to suppose that Mr.
'In dreams we "see things" in a way which in consciousness at the
time cannot always be distinguished from normal vision. But these sense
perceptions are not (presumably) due to retinal images at all.
330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., iooc.
Grottendieck's eyes quivered because the stones appeared to him
to hover in the air. It is only necessary to suppose a temporary
aberration in his estimate of time, such as frequently occurs in
fever, etc. Moreover, it is easy to produce experimentally illusions
of motion which cannot possibly be due to ocular movements.
Perhaps the most conclusive experiment is to watch a revolving
disc on which a spiral line has been traced, from the centre out
wards. If the speed is about right, the appearance will be that of
a number of expanding rings which begin at the centre of the
disc and move out to the circumference, where they vanish. If
now the rotation of the disc is suddenly arrested, for a few seconds
the impression will be produced of a series of contracting rings,
shrinking in from the circumference to the centre. It is obvious
that there cannot be any corresponding motion of the points of
the retina upon which the image of the spiral line, now at rest,
objectively falls.
The moral to the psychical researcher is not to doubt the
veracity of witnesses to supernormal phenomena of the class we
are considering, but to remember that the automatic mechanism
of sense perception provides us as a rule with ready-made objective
inferences—and not with pure evidence. In normal life the dis
tinction is immaterial, but when we come to the "supernormal,"
it is of the very essence of the question. For example, in Mr.
Grottendieck's case it, to my mind, leaves nothing further to be
said, and no further explanation to be desired.

[A MEMBER of the Society residing at Singapore sends us the
following tentative explanation of Mr. Grottendieck's Poltergeist,
which we print in the hope that some botanist familiar with the
flora of that region may give us an opinion on its plausibility. It
will be remembered that in the Journal for July, p. 295, Mr.
Grottendieck gave a description of the " stones " in question.
EDITOR.]
The Poltergeist phenomenon described by Mr. Grottendieck (Journal,
May, 1906), may, it seems to me, have a simple explanation which,
however, I diffidently suggest. The stones which fell in the night
were lost, I understand, and never satisfactorily examined by a
naturalist. Were they stones ? or were they the hard seeds of some
fruit ? In houses little occupied, it is very common for the small
Nov., 1906. Correspondence. 331
fruit-bats to come at night to eat fruit gathered from a tree near
the house. The bats bite off the fruit, fly noiselessly into the house,
and hanging from the roof nibble off the flesh of the fruit and drop
the seed on the floor. I have slept in a house in Malacca where
this rain of seeds of a Elaeocarpus tree went on the whole night. The
bats flew in noiselessly and kept dropping these seeds, which fell with a
loud noise on the floor, quite in the style of Mr. Grottendieck's stones.
The bats always fly to the same place to hang up, so the seeds all
fall from the same spot. They might be slightly warm from the
bat's holding them in its wings, but I certainly never noticed any
thing like this about seed carried by bats. The curve in the fall
can hardly be accounted for in this way, as the bats drop seeds
quite straight. Firing a rifle into the jungle would have little effect
on the bats, but might startle some which were eating their fruit
then in the house and make them drop it quickly. The cessation
of the fall might be due in this case to the fact that the bats had
finished the fruit of the tree, or had had enough. Many of th&
hard seeds of fruits might be mistaken for black stones if not carefully
examined by a naturalist. It is very unfortunate that the objects-
were not preserved.
The Poltergeist is not absolutely unknown to Malays. I have
heard a description of an occurrence of this nature from a Malay.
It was said to have happened in Singapore town some years ago.
A room in one of the streets was bombarded by stones, similar
to ordinary road metal, which flew through the windows in broad
daylight. No one could be seen to throw them, though this
was watched for. As it was considered to be due to the pranks of
a demon in the house, a pious Imam came to read the Koran to it
to exorcise it, but directly he began in the presence of a number
of other people, the book was kicked from his hands by an unseen
power, and its leaves went fluttering about the room. Undismayed,
he picked up the book again and went on reading, and shortly after
the disturbance ceased. This is the story as told to me by a Malay,
and though one cannot place much faith in a story of an incident
which had happened some years before when told by a native, it
serves to show that the phenomenon is known in the Malay Peninsula,
The house where this occurred has long been pulled down, and I
could get no more information about it.

THE CASE OF LYON v. HOME.
Mr. E. T. Bennett points out to me that in an article of mine
•dealing with the physical phenomena of spiritualism and published
in The Daily Express for June 25th, 1906, a reference is made to
the above case which is not technically accurate, and I am glad to
take this opportunity of correcting it. The statement I made was
that D. D. Home " was convicted of obtaining large suras of money
from a certain Mrs. Lyon by means of alleged communications from
her deceased husband, urging her to adopt Home as her son and
give him £700 a year." Mr. Bennett observes that the use of the
word " convicted " in this sentence is objectionable, since the action
brought against Home was in a Court of Equity ; he was not tried
for a criminal offence ; and the judgment of the Court was not a
verdict of "guilty" against a prisoner, but an order to refund certain
money, which as a matter of fact was done.
By the term " convicted," I intended merely to convey the fact
that a lawsuit in which Home was the defendant was decided
against him, as I was using the word in its ordinary everyday
sense, without thinking of its technical legal sense. This was no
doubt an oversight which might tend to mislead readers. The
question whether in any given case a person has or has not been
unduly influenced to benefit another must always admit of differences
of opinion, and must in Courts of Law be decided on a balance of
probabilities. Readers who are interested in this particular case
should refer to a careful summary of its legal aspects by Mr. H.
Arthur Smith, printed in the Journal, Vol. IV., pp. 117-119, from
which I quote the following sentences :
" The Court held the law to be that such transactions as those
in question cannot be upheld ' unless the Court is quite satisfied that
they are acts of pure volition uninfluenced.' The burden of proof
of sustaining what is primd facie utterly unreasonable is on those
who seek to benefit thereby. This proof of the voluntariness of
Mrs. Lyon's gifts was certainly not forthcoming."

DE. BRAMWELL'S " HYrNOTISM."
STUDENTS of hypnotism will welcome the second edition of
Dr. Bramwell's Hypnotism : its History, Practice and Theory, the
first edition of which has been out of print for some time.
Dr. Bramwell states in his Preface that since the book first
appeared (in 1903) little of importance has been added to
the literature of hypnotism and nothing which has caused
him to alter the views which he has already expressed ; the
second edition is therefore practically a reprint of the first.
The book is now published by Alexander Moring, Limited,

SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH THE STHENOMETEE.
BY F. J. M. STRATTON AND P. PHILLIPS.
IN a paper in Les Annales des Sciences Psychiques (1904, p.
243) which also appeared in the Revue de I'lfypnotisme (Feb.
1905), Dr. P. Joire describes an instrument called the
sthenometer ; it consists of a light straw pointer suspended
on a vertical needle-point and protected by a glass shade.
When a hand is brought near the instrument at right angles
336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1906.
to the pointer and with the finger-tips opposite to the end,
the pointer is attracted towards the hand by varying amounts.
Having observed a connection between the magnitude of this
motion for the two hands and the nervous condition of the
individual, Dr. Joire claims to have discovered a nervous force
emanating from the body and causing this motion.
In order to test these statements of Dr. Joire we have
carried out a number of experiments with a sthenometer kindly
lent us by Mr. F. W. H. Hutchinson, of Cambridge, and we
have come to the conclusion that the whole of the results
may be very well explained as due to heat radiated from the
hand. This idea was first strongly suggested by the marked
lag between the placing of the hand in position and the com
mencement of the motion of the pointer. It was further
supported by the following observations :
(1) If the hand was placed in direct contact with the glass,
so that the glass was heated much more rapidly and to a
higher temperature, the lag was very much smaller and the
motion of the pointer more rapid and through a larger angle.
In fact with the hand touching the glass and moved continually
so as to always keep the finger-tips in position opposite the end
of the pointer, the latter moved through over 90° in a minute.
(2) If a hot object, such as a heated poker, a spirit stove,
a lighted match, or an electric lamp, was brought up, a large
and rapid motion of the pointer towards the hot object was
produced.
These results led us to repeat the experiments by which
Dr. Joire claimed to have eliminated heat as a possible
explanation of the motion produced. The deflection caused
by a hand was observed first with and then without a thick
screen of non-conducting material interposed, the position of
the hand being the same in both cases. We used for our
screen three or four thicknesses of an eiderdown quilt. The
following were the results obtained :
DEFLECTION TOWAEDS THE HAND IN FIVE MINUTES.
With screen. Without screen.
-1° +6°
+ i° +8°
+ 1° +10|°
+ f° +17°
DBO., 1906. Some Experiments with the Sthenometer. 337
The deflections obtained in the presence of the screen were
on the whole such as might be expected if the heat from
the hand slowly filtered through ; no great importance can be
attached to them, as such slight deflections are often caused
by vibrations or air-draughts, to which the instrument is very
sensitive. At any rate the screen almost entirely cut off the
effect on the pointer, and this seems to show that the deflection
obtained by Dr. Joire under similar conditions was spurious
and to be explained by accidental causes.
To make the heat test more definite, experiments were tried
with a six-inch Leslie's cube filled with water heated to
40° C. The vertical sides of the cube were (1) polished,
(2) painted white, (3) painted a deep cream, (4) painted black.
When it was placed in somewhat the same position as
the hand, the following deflections were obtained, each in five
minutes :
(1) polished side, 3°.
(2) white side, 6|°.
(3) deep-cream side, 13£°.
(4) black side, 47°.
Thus the deflections increased largely with the amount of
heat radiated from the side of the cube ; 40° C. is slightly
above the temperature of the blood, and it is interesting that
the effect produced by the deep-cream side is of the same
order as that produced by the hand. This same side, when
the cube was filled with a mixture of ice and water, repelled the
pointer through 6°, and we may mention here that among
the many hands tested by us, only one showed any sign of
repulsion, and then only through |°.
Finally to establish the connection between the motion of
the pointer produced by the hand and the heat radiated from
it, the following deflections were observed :
(1) In the sthenometer when the hand was placed at a
fixed distance from it.
(2) Immediately afterwards in a galvanometer connected
with a thermopile when the hand was placed at a fixed
distance from the latter.
The following results were obtained with five different
hands :
338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DBC., 1906.
Deflexion in Sthenometer. Deflexion in Galvanometer.
10i° 2-4 cms.
12° 3 „
13° 3-9 „
14i° 4-7 „
16*° 5-5 „
This shows that the deflection in the sthenometer increases with
the amount of heat radiated from the hand and the correlation
between the two sets of figures is as close as could be
reasonably expected if heat is assumed to be the sole cause
•of the motion. We may suppose that the glass becomes
heated and so sets up air convection currents setting the
pointer in motion towards the heated spot.
To test this suggestion the pointer was suspended in a
bell-jar which could be exhausted of air. At atmospheric
pressure a hand brought near in the ordinary way gave a
deflection of 14°. When the pressure was reduced to I'l cms.
of mercury the same hand placed in the same position gave
a deflection of certainly not more than J°. This is conclusively
in favour of the above suggestion.
There may of course be a relation between the heat
radiated from the two hands and the nervous condition of
the individual, and Dr. Joire's criterion of the meaning of the
results given by the sthenometer may still be of value. But
•our own experiments with twenty-one different individuals
would not lead us to support his views. Quite a large pro
portion of apparently healthy undergraduates showed signs of
hysteria, neurasthenia or nervous depression, according to Dr.
Joire's criterion, and one individual, apparently in normal good
health all the time, in the course of twelve days ran through
the whole series of nervous troubles indicated in Dr. Joire's
second paper. It has seemed to us that the effect produced
by the two hands depended far more on the changes in the
temperature of the hands induced by exercise or other causes
than on variations in the general nervous state In any case
a thermopile would be a more reliable and sensitive instrument
for testing this point than a sthenometer. And it might be
well worth while for any one with facilities for studying
neurasthenic patients to test Dr. Joire's criterion with both
instruments.
DEO., 1906. Some Experiments with the Sthenometer, 339
fj It might also be of interest to perform carefully some
experiments on bodies of different material held for a time
in the hand and then placed by the sthenometer. Dr. Joire
in his latest paper 1 gives an account of some such experi
ments, but does not give sufficient details to substantiate
his claim that the results could not be due to heat. He
took no precautions to measure the amount of heat which
would be radiated from the bodies after being held in the
hand. This would depend on a good many circumstances, which
are insufficiently or not at all dealt with, such as the nature
of the surface, the material, the thickness, and the temperature,
etc., of the body used. Dr. Joire's results as described do
not seem in any way inconsistent with our hypothesis.
We have tried a few rough experiments on the same lines,
'without anything occurring which could not be well explained
by the radiation of heat stored up in a body while it was
held in the hand. But the point might be worthy of a more
•detailed and quantitative study than we have so far been able
to give to it.
In conclusion, reference may here perhaps be usefully given
to a paper by Sir William Crookes,2 in which he gives an
account of some careful researches into the rotation of a
delicately suspended cylinder of ivory. He reached the con
clusion that the motion was produced by molecular pressure
caused by radiation and not by air-currents. The stheuometer,
however, appears to belong rather to the class of instruments
discussed in a note by Dr. Abraham Wallace and Mr. St.
George Lane Fox in this Journal (Vol. VIII., p. 249, June,
1898). They showed the air currents, which produced the
motion of a delicately suspended body under a bell-jar, by
means of clouds of smoke. We can but support their claim
that no instrument can contribute to our knowledge of " psychic
force " which does not eliminate or duly account for the presence
of the various forces well known to the physicist, and we
submit that the sthenometer has failed to satisfy this test.

CASES.
P. 279. Dream.
This case was kindly obtained for us by Mr. Andrew Lang,
the witnesses being friends of his own, whose names were
given us in confidence. The first account was contained in
a letter to him, which he forwarded to us on April 21st,
1906, and is as follows:
J. had a very curious dream about [Mr. C.] about ten days
ago, shortly after his illness begau. I woke, hearing her call out
very loud in her sleep. She was sound asleep, but wailing, and
saying over and over : " Oh ! Thursday, at four o'clock. Thursday,
at four o'clock." I asked her in the morning if she had been
dreaming, and she said she had had a horrid dream about Mr. C.—
that he would die on Thursday at four o'clock. The first Thursday
came and went, but he died yesterday (Thursday) at four o'clock.
A strange and eerie coincidence.
In answer to our request for independent statements from,
Mr. and Mrs. L. we received the following :
From Mr. L.
April 30th, 1906.
The facts about which you inquire are as follows : A great
friend of ours was taken ill on Sunday [date stated] of this year.
The illness developed into pneumonia, and naturally gave us much
anxiety, but the complaint attacked only one lung, and there was.
always hope of recovery.
In the early morning of Tuesday [nine days later], just at grey
dawn, I was wakened by hearing my wife wailing and moaning,
and I started up, fearing that something was wrong. She was
apparently sound asleep, but was calling out, very clearly and
distinctly, " O-oh, on Thursday, at four o'clock. On Thursday, at
four o'clock." In the morning I said to her, "What was the matter
last night ? Were you dreaming a terrible dream 1 You were
moaning and calling out about 'Thursday, at four o'clock.'" She
then told me the dream, which I enclose with this letter, and she
said that she had dreamt that the doctor had told her that our
friend (Mr. C.) would die on Thursday at four o'clock
Thursday came, but Mr. C. was then easier, and in a few days
was almost out of danger. On the following Thursday, however^
he suddenly collapsed, and died at four o'clock.
Duo., 1906. Cases. 341
There can be no doubt as to the time, for my wife (to my
knowledge) left our own house a little (perhaps 20 minutes) before
that hour, and went with some of Mr. C.'s children direct to their
home, which is not more than five minutes' walk from the house in
which we live. In about a quarter of an hour after they entered
the house Mr. C. died.
I cannot very well ask any of the relatives to verify the hour
of death, nor do I care to ask the doctor to do so (he is a cousin
of Mrs. C.), but from my knowledge of the time at which my wife
left our house I can be certain within a very few minutes, and
my wife is absolutely sure of the hour.
From Mrs. L.
April 30th, 1906.
On Tuesday [date stated], an illness by which Mr. , a very
great friend of my husband and myself, had been atttacked was
pronounced to be pneumonia. During the days that followed I was
very much with his wife, and as the illness was from the first a
serious one, I was very anxious.
During the night of Monday [of the following week]—early in
the morning, I fancy—I dreamed that his doctor came to me and
said, looking very pale and grave, " will die at 4 on Thursday."
In my dream I sobbed "At four on Thursday ?" and half awoke
myself, moaning. In the morning my husband asked me, " What
were you moaning and wailing about ' Thursday at 4 o'clock ' t " and
I told him my dream.
When Thursday came I felt very uneasy, but on Thursday after
noon Mr. rallied, and the improvement was so steadily
maintained until Wednesday [of the following week] that his speedy
recovery was looked for.
On Wednesday morning he had a heart collapse, but again rallied,
and on Thursday morning seemed considerably stronger. I was
at his house most of the morning, and left about one o'clock. The
doctor was still hopeful, and I had forgotten about my dream.
About 20 minutes to four I returned, and found that Mr.
had had another collapse, and was dying.
A few minutes after four o'clock his eldest son came downstairs
and told me that his father had just then died.
We asked if the dream had been mentioned to any
one before Mr. C.'s death, and if so, whether there was
342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Due., 1906.
any possibility that he could have heard of it, and Mr. L.
replied :—
May 5th, 1906.
It is impossible that Mr. C. could ever have heard of my wife's
dream. It was not mentioned to anybody until I told Mr. Lang
after Mr. C.'s death.
L. 1155. Collective Hallucination.
THE following case of a collective hallucination of a light seen
in connection with the Welsh Revival services was sent to
Mr. A. T. Fryer by the Rev. D. Mardy Davies, pastor of the
•Calvinistic Methodist Chapel at Pontycymmer, Glamorgan, where
the light was seen. Mr. Davies writes to Mr. Fryer :
PONTYCYMMER, Dec. 1st, 1905.
A circle of fire was seen at Bethel last Friday evening, and was seen
by many. It appeared before the pulpit and above the big seat. It
was about 3 feet in diameter, and moved upwards as high as the gallery,
and then disappeared. I cannot say how many saw it. I can refer
you to two young men who are candidates for the Ministry. Both
saw it distinctly, and it has made a lasting impression on their minds.
[One was] Mr. J. C. Jones, c/o Mr. Griffith Jones, Builder. The
other one is T. M. Jones, who lives near to the former.
D. MARDY DAVIES.
On receiving this account, Mr. Fryer wrote to make enquiries
on the following points :
(1) Time and duration of the light?
(2) Number of persons by whom seen ?
(3) Whether connected with any particular part of the service or
point of a sermon ?
(4) Have the witnesses attended Mrs. Jones' (of Egryn) services
at any time?
(5) Whether this was the first occasion or not of such a vision
to the percipients ?
(6) Whether the percipients have ever had any experiences in the
way of dreams that have come true, or visions, or telepathic
influence ?
(7) The names of the occupants of the big seat over whose heads
the light appeared, and whether at the moment they were praying
•or reading ?
(8) Exact description of the light, apparent size, colour, etc.?
X>KC., 1906. Cases. 343
Mr. J. C. Jones replied as follows :
3 HILL VIEW, PONTYCYMMER, Dec. 25th, 1905.
Your letter of the 2nd inst. to hand. I had overlooked your
first letter, owing to my waiting for a correct description of points
you ask for in the enclosed. But up to now I have failed to get all
you ask for. But I shall try to give you as much information as
I can, as follows :
(i) About 2 seconds.
(ii) I have only found that it is only Mr. T. M. Jones and
myself up to now.
(iii) When singing a popular old Welsh song.
(iv) No.
(v) Yes.
(vi) I myself have seen three bars of light before at Bethel just
after I had finished my sermon in last August.
(vii) I cannot remember all their names. The light appeared
while they were praising God in reciting verses, hymns and singing.
(viii) The circle would be about 3 feet in diameter. It was of
sunny colour, a part yellow and a part red.
I may say that this is the only description I myself can give.
I asked Mr. T. M. J. for his, and he says he has had no letter
from you. He lives at Ogmore House, Hill View, Pontycymmer.
J. C. JONES.
Mr. T. M. Jones wrote later to Mr. Fryer as follows :
OGMORE HOUSE, HILLVIEW, PONTYCYMMER, Dec. 29th, 1905.
I am in receipt of yours of 27th inst. I am sorry that I cannot
help you in this matter, as what I saw is entirely beyond description.
T. M. JONES.
Mr. Fryer tried in vain to obtain further details of what
was seen, his later letters remaining unanswered.
EAPPING MAGPIES.
THE following account was sent to us by a Member of the
Society, Mrs. R. Home, who obtained it from her friend, Miss
Money, the narrator. It was written towards the end of
October, 1905, and the signatures which follow Miss Money's
are those of her mother, Mrs. Close, Miss Close, a niece of
Mrs. Close's, and their maid.
344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1906.
About the end of June this year, 1905, my mother took a cottage
on the edge of Dartmoor for five weeks ; it was of recent date,
having been built about a year.
The first night of our residence we were aroused from our
slumbers by our maid who slept downstairs on the ground floor;
she burst into our room in a panic of terror, declaring some one was
getting into her window, and she had seen something white in the
room. We were considerably alarmed, but on looking at the clock,
and being very sleepy, I took the hour for 8.30 a.m., and said,
"How silly you are! it is the milk woman!" and we all became
very bold, with the exception of the maid, and went downstairs and
searched the cottage and the garden. We found nothing and heard
nothing, and returned to our rooms to find that sleep had so
dimmed our eyes as to deceive us in the hour, for we discovered
that instead of 8.30 it was 4 a.m. We had no sooner settled down
than the noise began again, and we again went down to find nothing.
The milk woman and postman laughed at the maid and scorned
the idea of the cottage being " haunted " ; but the noise recurred the
same time every night, and we came to the conclusion that it must
be the maid herself hammering on her iron bed to make us come
down, or that it had something to do with the pipes connected
with the bath.
However, we did not like it at all, and one morning at that early
hour it continued for an hour and a-half and was so loud that we
could not sleep. At the end of four weeks we had not discovered
what it was, and one morning I leaned out of the window looking
at the sunrise, and the rabbits and birds beginning to wake up,
when I discovered that the maid was right, and the noise was on
her window and sounded as if some one had cut a stick from the
hedge and hit the window hard with it ; and this did really frighten
me, and on looking at the window after breakfast I saw that it was
covered with little specks of mud, as it might be from a stick.
Our disturbances were commonly known in the village, and on
bringing the condition of the window to the notice of our friends,
it was suggested that some one should come and sleep in a tent in
the garden and shoot at whatever it was.
Finally we agreed to leave the door of the room next to the
maid's room open, so that we could see outside on coming down
stairs, and at the first sound my mother went down very softly, and
she said she saw an enormous bird, she thought a heron, fly over
the gate ; when it came again, I went down and saw a pair of
DUO., 1906. Rapping Magpies. 345
magpies fly over the gate, after which we were able to persuade
the maid to get up and look. As soon as she moved all was quiet;
she moved the curtain and watched, and in ten minutes a pair of
magpies appeared; one flew at the window, whilst the other walked
up and down the lawn.
So the mystery was solved. We could never have believed it was
a bird who came so punctually, had we not seen it; and we were
afterwards told in the village that the people who had lived in the
cottage before were also much disturbed and frightened by the
same noise. The little dog who slept in the sitting room never
barked or moved.

CORRESPONDENCE.
ON EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.
Every one reading the accounts of experiments in thought-trans
ference published by the S.P.R. cannot fail to be struck by the fact
that although many and valuable results may have been obtained,
there has been practically no variation in the principle of the methods
-employed. It appears to me that much might be gained by trying
fresh methods, in order to find if possible some readier and more
reliable means of inducing telepathy than those generally used.
Possibly some of the recorded cases of telepathy in which the
condition of the agent is more or less known might help us, to
some extent, in devising them.
Phantasms near the time of death appear to occur, at any rate
.sometimes, while the agent is unconscious. In other (not death)
instances, e.g. in cases of stunning, the agent is again unconscious,
or if conscious at all, his primary consciousness is probably practically
in abeyance. In the case of S.H.B. his phantasm was seen while
he himself was asleep. In all these cases we may fairly assume the
primary consciousness to have been to all intents and purposes in
A state of suspension.
Can we in any way produce experimentally this state of temporary
•abeyance of the primary consciousness, or anything approaching to
it 'i Might we not take a hint from the methods of the Christian
Scientists as to this point ?
346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1906.
Their method of cure, in many cases at any rate, is, roughly,
first to determine what result they wish to produce in the patient
(e.g. the removal of a headache), and then to put the patient and
his complaint completely out of mind, and concentrate their atten
tion on some Divine attribute, such as the love of God, and
attempt to realise it, the cure being said to be eifected at the
moment when the realisation is sufficiently perfect.
The Christian Scientists believe that at that moment they become
a channel through which the power of God can act to effect the
cure. If however they really can produce results—a point on which
I have not sufficient knowledge to dogmatise—may it not be that
they have hit upon a method of inducing a condition similar in its
effect to the abeyance of the primary consciousness, and so helping
to produce telepathic results t
It seems possible that the mental concentration on a highly
abstract idea may, so to speak, use up the primary consciousness,
and prevent it from interfering by further suggestions with the
secondary consciousness, which is thus left free and undisturbed to
carry out the telepathic act.
It is clearly easy to apply this principle to experiments on
thought-transference, so far as the agent is concerned.
It is difficult to find any condition common to the percipients in
the spontaneous telepathic cases. Possibly the condition of the
agent may be the chief determining cause. It may however be
worth noting that in these cases the percipient is not expecting any
telepathic impression, and is not looking for it when it comes,—
which tends to show that trials made without the knowledge of
the percipient may be worth more attention ; and since in many
cases the impression may apparently remain latent for some con
siderable time, this also should be taken into account when possible.
Unfortunately I have no opportunity of carrying out researches
myself, but I do feel very strongly that it is not merely by repeating
the same experiments that the solution of telepathy will, if ever,
be reached ; but only by constantly varying their conditions until
the best method is found.
Other variations, and probably better ones, will doubtless suggest
themselves to many members of the S.P.R.
I do not write as a perfectly convinced believer in telepathy,
but in the hope that if it really does exist, some fortunate experi
menter, by trying any likely methods that may strike him, may
discover some means of producing its phenomena with reasonable
DEC., 1906. Correspondence. 347
certainty, and without the many failures at present attending such
attempts ; and also that from the nature of such a method, if found,
we may be able to approach more nearly to the explanation of
telepathy itself. HUGH WINGFIELD.
[We gladly endorse Dr. Wingfield's suggestion for trying
experiments in telepathy under a variety of conditions, but
would only point out to experimenters that, considering the
Comparative rarity of successes under any conditions in these
experiments, a very long series would be necessary to establish
even the presumption of certain conditions being more favour
able than others.—EDITOR.]
NOTES.
AN abridged edition of Mr. Myers's Human Personality, which
has been prepared by his son, Mr. L. H. Myers, is shortly
to be published by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. In the
abridgment, the text of the original chapters is very little
curtailed, though a selection only of the illustrative cases is
given. The Appendices, in which a great mass of detailed
evidence was originally included, have on the other hand
been considerably abridged. The argument may thus be
followed without interruption, while, for fuller evidence in
support of the author's theories, the serious student will be
able to consult the original edition by the help of the complete
series of references which are given in the abridgment.
The book will be in a single 8vo volume of about 450
pages.
The reports on the " materialisations " at the Villa Carmen,
Algiers, which have been published in The Annals of Psychical
Science from October, 1905, onwards, are probably familiar to
most of our readers. Another side of the case is presented
in a paper by M. Marsault (a lawyer practising at Algiers),
entitled " Mon Temoignage concernant Bien-Boa" in Les
Nouveaux Horizons de la Science et de la Pensde for November,
1906, a monthly journal, published at 19 rue Saint-Jean,
Douai, Nord, France, price 60c. Other articles on the subject
by an Honorary Associate of the Society, M. Sage, have appeared
in the same journal for March, May, and July, 1906.

Since the Editorial note on Mr. H. N. Ridley's letter in
the last number of the Journal was printed, we have learnt
that Mr. Ridley is the Director of the Botanical Gardens at
Singapore, and that, therefore, the hope we expressed that
" some botanist familiar with the flora of that region " might
give us an opinion on the plausibility of his suggestion was
—to say the least of it—inappropriate. We can only plead
our ignorance as an excuse, though the modest tone of Mr.
Ridley's communication should perhaps have roused the
suspicion that it came from an expert.
