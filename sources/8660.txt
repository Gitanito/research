         Experience  description:   &nbsp;&nbsp;     </b>

  First     experience:

My first   experience began when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I was attending a Catholic   Church (St James) in Madison Wi. After the service I remember going up to light   a candle for the Virgin Mary. After I light the candle I was praying and that   was when I heard her talking to me. I heard a very soft beautiful voice in my   head and I remember being memorized by it. It was telling me that I was going to   be called upon and that I needed to be patient I wish I could remember more but   I can't I remember when she was talking to me it felt like time had stopped and   that it was just her and me in the church. I even saw her statue wink at me '   needless to say even for an 6 year old I did not tell anyone because I knew that   statues are not suppose to talk to you let alone wink at you. I had repressed   this memory until my next experience.

  Second     experience:

When I was   27 years old I had another experience. I had just had my second child and I   remembering sitting in my rocking chair watching Ronald Regan selection for the   first teacher in space. When Christa McCulla was called to accept the position.   I felt a feeling of pure doom spread from my head into every cell of my body. It   felt like someone had placed their hand on my head and let this ooze of doom   invade my body. I could not move, I was frozen as this feeling went through me.   I couldn't believe this ' I knew that if she got on the space shuttle she was   going to die. I remember I kept saying 'this can't be happening' over and over   again. When I was released I didn't know what to do ' should I call NASA and   tell them ' if I did would they even believe me. Who am I but a simple housewife   with two small children.

I was so   afraid that if I called NASA that they would send the police out and I would be   in trouble so I didn't tell anyone. Little did I know that others were also   receiving these kinds of feelings and calling NASA. On the morning of the lift   off I did not catch the initial showing of the shuttle blasting off . When I did   find out what happened I remember sinking to the floor and I made a promise to   GOD that the next time he made contact with me I would listen. It was at this   point that I realized that we are not alone and that there is something else   going on but I just did not understand. It was then that I remembered about the   conversation with the Virgin Mary. I believe this experience was my awakening.&nbsp;

  Third     experience:

When I was   33 years old I had another experience that was even more dramatic. I remember   waking up one morning and as I started to get out of bed I saw a brilliant white   light in the corner of my room. At first I thought that this was just sunshine   although I remember thinking that I never saw sunlight like that before so I   glanced at my door and saw that it was almost shut. How could all that light get   in my room. Then I thought that this light must be the ghost of a girlfriend of   mine that had past away when she was 19. As I looked at the light I remember how   utterly beautiful it was. This light was really bright but it did not hurt my   eyes to look at. I was memorized by it.&nbsp; When I closed my eyes I could   still see it . It was then that I fell back on the bed and realized that I could   not move. It was like I was being held down.

Then I saw   images of a man and I heard a voice again talking to me in my head. This voice   was talking about this man and who he was and that we were going to met. This   voice told me about his temperament, what he looked like, his heritage, and what   he would say to me when we meet. This voice said that this man needed to be   shown the right path in life and he would give me the passion that I needed in   my life. I remember tossing my head from side to side 'NO I would never have   anything to do with someone like this NO WAY'.

When I was   released, I thought 'Is this really happening' ' things like this doesn't happen   . I was too afraid to tell anyone because I was afraid they would think I was   crazy. I pushed this event back and did not think about it until 6 month later   when I met this man. He was exactly like I saw him and he even said what the   voice told me he would say to me word for word. I was in complete amazement. I   remember making the promise to GOD to follow through and I did so. I tried very   hard over the course of 6 years to help this man. He had a lot of problems and   we were in out of a relationship and the last time we got together was when I   had the NDE like experience.

Fourth   experience&nbsp;

My NDE-like   experience happened when I was 40 years old. I was back together with this man   (Phillip). I remember that I was at a low point because no matter what I did   Phillip kept going back to his old ways even though he told me that he had found   GOD ' yeah right ' things kept happening to him that I am sure GOD created to   show him that he need to spend time with me, but instead Phillip kept hanging   out with his friends. I remember nights just crying myself to sleep asking GOD   to please take me home because I could no longer take this anymore.

One night   when I was at my deepest despair as I prayed to GOD to take me home I suddenly   fell asleep and the next thing I knew I am in a place surrounded in white light.   I looked around and realized that this light was like the light in my bedroom   years ago. It was at this point I realized that I knew this place ' I was 'HOME&quot;   I also realized that I no longer had a body - and the feeling of pure JOY was so   wonderful because I was able to feel joy without being bound in a body. I can't   explain it in words how this feeling felt ' when you are free of the body   feelings are felt in the fullest . It was at this point I realize that this   place was 'THE REALITY' . I kept saying to myself ' they must being showing me   this because I am going to die and they did not want me to be afraid.' Well I am   still here so I know that wasn't it J. '

I started   to look around and saw beings of different colors huddled in a group talking   amongst themselves. They were nether male or female. One of them I remember was   a soft olive green color and this being was holding a staff. I thought to myself   that these being don't have eyes, ears, mouths or hands and they are conversing   how can this be. I decided to see what color I was, so I stretched a part of me   out and saw that I was a very vibrant plasmic hot pink. I remember laughing   because this was a color I would not be comfortable wearing here on Earth.

The next   thing I knew I was being pulled into the light and gosh what an utterly   wonderful experience. This light went into me and bathed me in PURE PURE PURE   UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. I became part of it and it showed me that we needed to look   not with our eyes but with our hearts. We need to love selflessly and to do it   often. To be compassionate and understanding and to look beyond what we see ' to   see with our hearts. We are all connected ' we know each other. We (All things)   are all of this LOVING light. It was too beautiful and wonderful, I did not want   to leave. I felt myself being pulled toward the group of beings that I saw   earlier. I was being pulled into an area that was like an opening of some kind '   when I was above the opening I was scared that I was going to fall down through   it. I just floating there when I saw another being rushing up toward me.

I was   being pulled toward this being that was the color of royal purple. I heard a   name of this being ('Kevin') and I heard the olive green being say to me   telepathically 'This is the one you will be with next'. I thought to myself '   you want me to be with my ex-brother-in-law ' that was the only 'Kevin' that I   knew at that time. As this being drew closer it realized that this was a   different person. When we embraced it was so wonderful. It felt like 10 billion   fireworks of love energy exploding all around and in me. Pure ecstasy. It was   Love unbounded. That is the best way that I can describe it. Nothing that we can   experience on earth even comes close to this feeling. I did not want to let go   of this being. (When I get back 'home' I can't wait to embrace everyone). The   next thing I knew I was in long hall where one end went on forever. I saw a   throne and a being sitting on it. I could not look up to see it's face because I   knew not to. I was bouncing all over the place because I knew that I was in the   presence of GOD. I kept saying to myself 'OH MY GOD ITS GOD' over and over   again. As I started to calm down I heard the voice of GOD.

I can't   describe it other than that it was alive. I knew that God could end everything   on Earth with just one word it felt that powerful. This voice was powerful and   you knew it. I was so humbled I felt so small ,so insignificant yet so loved.   This voice came from up above me ' it was like God showed me a body on a throne   so that I would have something to grasp as all this was happening. He asked me   how I thought things were going with Phillip and I said he was doing good (yeah   right) . God then said 'Tell me how he is really doing' Like I could fool God so   I told him that things were not good at all. God then asked me what I would   think would happen if God took me away from him. At this point I am thinking   that God intends to have me come 'Home' and I said that if I was to die Phillip   would lose it completely. God then said 'Well I think I know my son better than   that' He went on to say that what was important was that Phillip needed to have   him in heart 100 percent and that he will have to take things over. He asked me   if that would be OK. I agreed.

God then   asked me 'what do you want' ' I couldn't believe it ' here I have been given the   greatest gift off all to know of heaven and to understand that we don't die and   God wants to know what I want. All I could think of was that I wanted to have my   kids here also.

Once I   told him this the next thing I know awoke with a sudden start in bed. I wanted   to run and yell to everyone that I had gone to heaven and WE DON'T DIE. Reality   sunk in that if I did this everyone would think I was crazy. I have to tell you   that I was on cloud 9 for months and I had the biggest smile on my face. I knew   . I eventually told my 3 kids, I have told parts of my story to a few people but   never the whole story for fear that other would think that I was crazy. Being in   the light has changed me in that I have become even more compassionate,   understanding and loving then I was before this happened. I have not become a   religious person but I have become very spiritual. I have begun discovering the   Buddhist philosophy. I think Buddha had a NDE-Like experience as well.&nbsp;

The   relationship with Phillip ended and I saw events enfold that showed me where I   needed to be next. I got laid off and I got an job opportunity to work in   Louisville KY. I knew that I had to come here. What I didn't know was that I had   a cousin here. I saw how God had arranged me to move down here and he made sure   that I had a relative here to help me. I told my cousin when I got down here   that I knew that I was going to meet someone here and that someone was Kevin.

  Fifth Experience:

I had   another NDE-Like experience two or three weeks before I meet Kevin. I knew I was   back in heaven but in a place surrounded in snowcapped mountains like in   Switzerland. I remember playing in the snow with a man in his mid to late   twenties. I was not able to see what he looked like but I knew his age range and   that he loved Switzerland. When I awoke I was again on cloud 9 for days. A few   weeks later I then received an email from a man named Kevin and he told me his   age which was 28 and as we conversed I learned that he loved Switzerland. Anyway   as our friendship developed I asked him this question 'If our souls were   different colors what color would mine be' he answered 'That's easy Hot Pink'. I   have not shared these experiences with him so he didn't have a clue yet he knew.   How amazing how this whole thing works. Kevin and I will always be friends. I   kept seeing a word in my head 'Maytra' and when I asked him what this word meant   he said that it was Sanskrit and that it meant 'Male Friend' COOL. I am assuming   that God wants me to be his friend and I will surely be this for him as long as   he needs me and that he does know.

Well   that's all - oh yeah since I saw the light of GOD in my bedroom I haven't aged   like most people ' I age more slowly ' more gracefully J. It is so cool to look   at people and to know that we are so much more than the sum of our parts and   that we know each other and we are here to love one another on our human   journey.
