INTRODUCTION.
IT baa been tbe g"eneral opinion of all aa~~ eYell
of tbe most barbarous, that man doee not die entirely,
but that his better part..Jubsists aftes the dissolution of .
the body ; and this original notion of the soult iJQ•
mortality, bas induced the · moiM learned, antl ~pat
aotient utioos to lndulge the belief of tile poasibility
ofthe visible interference of spirits, upon c:ertaiJI mr.
mentous and awf'lft occasions.
There is nothing more commooty talked of tbtn
apparitions of departed spirits, of dcemons and ghosts:
The·reality of these viaiMis passes for certain with a
great number of people, while by as great a number
they are laughed at, and 1reated aa reveries and id_,

this subject, some of which are expeusive and volu•

.and extract from the most: learned and judicious the
most remarkable narrratives, which prove the rc:ality
of these ~veral ~ppeanrn£es. We have therefore treat-
ed the \~bjl!Ct with all p!rectsinn possible, and . but •
rarely hazarded an.'opinion upon tqe matter ourselves~
After giving the necessary relation most in the author's
own words, and citiatf.M...- for the authority, the
examination of the matter, and the manner iu which
they are affected, and uporr what principles they may
be explained, the reader is left to judge for bimsetf1

holy writ. It were certainly to be wished, that a line
could be drawn ~etween idle d~uaions (the cre~tures
ofa disordered imagination) and real apparitiona; ror
most intelligent persons are well aware, that many
things of this kind, which are not real facta, are often
related to tqe cliscredit and certain confusion of the
,.eporter.
Now to reconcile· matters between the two extremes,,
may by aome be thought dificult, but in order to aet
s~cb bounda to our enquiries as right ttuon preecribea
U is our intention in the followins sheets to rel~e
nothing but what is upon the sttreat foundation of
credir.
Many persons have been, and still ate very much
alarmed at the bate mentioa of a spirit or apparition ;.
and in consequence woald not venture a step in tbe
dark, or across a church yard at midni~tht, for Mar of
meeti.JJg the awf'ul form·vfsome departed friend~ This
C..n be accounted for no ot!Jerwise than from the pre-
jlldice of edUcation : for our infant ideas of this llind
grow up to maturity with our stature, andfixso strong
and strange an impression up·•n our minds, as even in·
future life to drive reason frem her throne,
But the reader is not wish'd to presume frorn ·hen~,.
· or suppose that there is no certainty ot the actual ex•
sfance of spiiittand·apparitione; but· on the contrary
t]p~
o.,. ,.,,,Coogle

that wehave the best evidence that such have been sed1
in all ages, according to Hse testimony of the soberest
and wisest of mankind, and doubtless sent by provi-
denoe as ministe1ing spirits, to answer some fit decree of
his divine wisdom.
Mr, Addit_,n in one of his papers, (No. i 1o.) ,\here
the scene i~ laid in the country, at the boose Of Sir
Rogerde Coverley in Worcestershire, observes that they
•re more excusjable who believe in a_pparitions, than
those who reject all extraordinary revelations of this
lind, ~ontrary to tbe reports of all. historians, "
sacred
and profane, antient and modern, and to the ttaditions
of all nations, think the appearance of spirits fabulous
. \ .
and groundless. Could we not give ourselves up to
the general testimony .of mankind, w~ should to the
relations of partic-ular persons who are living, and
whom we know~ and cannot distrust in other matters
of fact.
For the·rehtrn of ~pirits after death, *be scripture
.lUi)poses it in more places than one; for instance
wheR the witch of Endor raised up ~amuel at .the de-
sire of Saul. · When Moses forbids enchanters, ob·
iervers oftime, and other sorts of diviners, he adds'
prohibition of necromanr.y, or consulting the dead•
Deut. xviii. 11~ ln Leviticus xx, 3/• and elsewhere
als~t
( v )
also, he mentions the frequency of persons that had
familiar spirits by necromancy; and other unlawful and
superstitious methods.
_ The book of Job, whose antiquity is supposed by
some coeval with Moses himself, is full to the pur-
pose; who had read particularly the thirty.third chap.
ter, where Eliphaz observes, that God oftentimes
ails miln to repentance by visions and dreams.
lfit were necessary, an innumerable collection of
quotations might be brought from the books of the
Bible·to serve the present purpose: but a- few will
-serve as well as many, When our Saviour walked upon
the sea, the apostles cried out for fear, saying, " it is a
·spirit. •• \Vh'en the rich man desired Abraham to send
·Lazarus unto his br~ttlren to testify, the fatal situation
ois imprudence had brought him into, and to w:un them
1estthey also ~hould come into that plaee of torment, he
eviden~lysupposed it possible for the dead to return, and
•coltvene with the liv;ng, Our·Saviour in the gospel ex-~
pressly refutes the error of the saddueees, and ·prove•
the mstence of the sotil after the death of the body~
T-"- doubtiq_g apostle St Thomas, did mrt hesitate at
the possibility of Christ's second appearance, he only
questioned the actual-reality of his resurrection in the
.eame body,; and this seems to have been the opinion
aJ10 of others of his disciples after his resurrection, for
they
.(

they at Brat supposed they bad seen a spirit; but Jesus
assured them of the contrary, saying, " Behold my
hands and feet ; handle me and feel, for a spirit hath
not flesh and bones as ye see me havt." In the same
manner be convinced his followers of the substaotiabil•
ity of his appearance, appealing to the then Jlrevailing
opinion among the Jews. Hence it is plain, th<lt the
belief ofspiritual communication prevailed in the ear•
liest times; and neither Christ, nor his- apostles, nor
•fter them the fathers of the church, took any pains to
destroy or confute the notion. On the contrary, they
have supposed, and in some degree authorised them,
by their silence, their discourses, and their actions.
Thele proofs of scrjpture are so plain, and we have
bad so many extraordinary instances to verify Jt, that
we. cannotjudiciously deny such facts as c.ome. to tit.
attested upon the probity of. our friends, who reJate
from their own experience such wonderful instanct.l
..as might awaken the most unthinldng wretch ; and who
dare deny, but that the all-gracious God, amongst
.other wise and tender mct~ods which .he makes use of
.to call sinnera to..&limself, may, and often. doe.s, make
use of this.

by lli. Doddridge of the late unfortunate Colonel
Gardener, than which none can be·rnore stnnge, sud·
den llRd wonderful, nor more worthy of being credited,
as the reverend divine who relates it, had not the teatt
view or advantage in the publishing it ; but through
tbe hopes of its being useful to awaken others as great
sinners, as ia the instance of manifest mercy, he him•
self records of the person whose life he writes.
The reality therefon: of the apparitions of angels
d~emons and departed souls, cannot be denied, without
destroying the authority of the scripturn, which relate
and suppose them.
. But a little time W!Ore, and we shall .be removed fnto

While here upon earth, as those who art gone before

some momentous uccasions we know it has happened;
which makes Blair in his poena·ofthe grave, ~y,

The fatal story to mankind have told;
Forewarning them of delth-Oh then comply,
And tell, in charity, what 'tis to die;
Sut you're witheld, no matter, death must call,
The curtain drop, and time will clear up all.
Upon the wh~le, from what has heen said ltefore
Jnd what is ber~after related upon this head we may
-conclude:
That angels. glorified tpirits, or departed souls, are
tometimes known to appear, and conaquently, that
these apparition~ are not only possible, but real and
actual, founded upon the aatbority of the Scripture,
both of the Old and N.ew Testament, upon the testi·
mony of authors . of credit, Greek, Latin, Cltristiall
and Heathen, ancient and modern. Pbiloaopbers, di·
vines, poets, and moralists, and the moat tober Jiving
tradition assert the facts, therefore, notwithttandingfrom
the want of experience in our.elves, so much is due
to tbe probity of others, while t.bey coincide with rea.
tOn and religion.
Hence we find that the soul ie immortal, and that
there it a future slate, with punishments for the wick·
ed, and rewards for the good, and that nothing clefi·
Jed shall entar into the k.loadom of God. T~t there
art 100d angels, Which incline Ul tO good; and evil

apints, which tempt us to irreligi.>n ~ad wicked practi.
ces: and these are the pri11cipal points upon whicb
t!Ie ensuing sheets are c~mpiled,
We may also confirm obrselves in this great truth
. ,
that spiritual beings, as well as departed souls, as angels
and dcemons, are invested by the supreme being, the
creator and pr~server of all things; with. an extensive
power of acting upon sublunary bodies, and causing
in them very great and Yery dreadful alterations.
The conclusion is confirmed by the following vuiety
of fact~, collected from t~e most respectable authority
and scrupulous veracity, founded upon that persuasion
of St. l'aul, that tlte air isfull of spirits, ealled by him
the ·princes of the power of the.air, and rulers of the
darkness of this world, the head of whom is ,stiled in
the Gospel the Prince of this World. We may farther
fearo, that the power·ot tb6'se ~pitits would be much
more e:s.fcosive than it is. if it' were'not limited by tbe
power of him who .has Said, thus fur shalt thou go, and
no farther; and the mercy of Jesus Christ who assures
ui in his gospel, that he has overcome Satan apd made
him fall from Heaven, and commands us perpetuaUy to
pray, that we ·may resist temptation, and be secure
rom the malice of the devil, who, in the apostle's
phrase, like a roaring alion, walketh about, seekioJ

But the singularity of their circumstances might

by abdication. They were both women of ezcellent

might be supposed to despise all ita Ifompl and vani·

In one of tb e serious consultations. they had together
on thi~ head; it was a1r~ed ~tween them, that on
which ever of thetn the lot should f.tll to be first cane•

bilit\• of doing so, and give the other an account io
w.hat m~nner she was dispoll~d of.···This pro111ise it

So odd a message might .well . surprise tbe person

Tie apparition ofa gentleman to tbe late R~v. anti
leatntd Dr. Scott, on account of an ortginal .dee4
belonging to bis g·rtzndson's estate.
T H! d®tor wt~s sitting alone by the fire, either
in his study or iD his pJrlour, in Broad-street, where
he lived, aad reading a book, his d~Jor being fast shut
ami locked: he wu well assured there was nobody in
the room but himself, wl.en accidently ·rais!ng his head
~ little. be,was exceeding surprised to see sitting in an
elbOW chair, at the Giber sitle of the ire pJace or chim•
aey, an ancieut grave gentleman iRa tilac.k velvet gown,
a long YTig, and lookiAg with a pleasini! countenam:e
towards the doctor as ifju5t going to speak.
The doctor, as we may reasonably suppose, was
1reatly surprised at the sight of him, and indeed the
aecing hi~ auitting i11 th~ chair w..u the moat likely
u'" edo,Gocigle to
to be- surpri~ing; because tbe-tt.>cltlr knowing the door
to be locked, and then seeing a man sitting in• the
~hair, he must immedia:ely and at fiut sight conclude
him to be a spirit,- "''apparition, or devil, call it as
you will. Had he seen him t:lilme in at the door, ..e
might at first have sopposed him to ~ really a gentle-
man come to speak with him, and might thin.t be had
emitted hsteoing the duvr, as he intended to have
4one
The doctor appearedi in gteat disorde~ at the sight,
as he adnowledged ·ao those whom· he toll! the story
to, and from WboiD (Sa)'S my authnr) } recei\'ed tht•
account with \'eJY little remove of hallds b4!twee.n.
The epectre it 14!ems.began, for tbe doctor had aot
courage at first, as he 9llid, to speak to · it ; I ·say the·
spectre or apparition spoke first, and desired the doc-
tor not to be frig~ed, not: to be surprised. for that be
would not do rum any hurt; but that be came to ·him
upon a matter of great importance to an iftiured fami·
ly, wbich wits in great dangh of being ruin~d; and
though he, (the doctor) was a stranger to the f.Unily,
yet knowing. him to be a man of integrity, be bad·
pi'cbed upon him to do an act of very great charity, as
well as justice ; and' that he ~ould depend upon him
ft>r a·punctual· performance.
The doctor was not at first composed enough to re•
eeive the introduction of the business with a. du~ at_
tention, bU( seemed•rather inclined to· get out of the
. lOOm
room ifhe could, and once' o-r twiee made someJ~ttemp.t
to !:. 1 nck for some of the family to eome up, at y..hicb
the apparition appeared a little displeased.
But it seems he need not ; for, as the doctClr said.
he 'bad. no powef to go out of the room if he had been
next to th.: dqor, or to knock for .help, if any had beeG
at hand.
·But here the apparition seeeillj the doctor atil,l. in
'
oonfusion, desited him to compo.se himttlf, for .lte
,vou1,d not·do him the least injury, -or ofler an~ thing
to·make him uneary ; but desired thlt he w~uJd Jri.
Ye
.bim leave to deliver lhe basinea he ca1M about, whi'h
when be had heard• perhaps he would 1e.e I••• c~s•
to be surprised or apprehemive than he did now, .
By this time, .and the e~al111 w;,y.· of d·i~co11ne above
·mentioned, the do~tor re4:ovefed bi.mtelf EO muc.h,
though not with any kind ·of· c;ompo>ure, ae to-
apeak.
In tl.te name ot God# says .the doctor, what art
thou?
l .desired you would not be frightened, says. the-_a.p·
.paJition to him again ; I am a stra.nger to }:ou, ~iul it l
tell .you my name,. you do not know it, but,_you may
do the business without enquiring.
The doctor continued discomposed and .unea.~y, and

said nothi~ {or sowe time• .

ted~ and received only for amwer the o!d ignor.~nt.
question-o
_,
1R the aa!lM of God, what ~rt thou ?
U pou :this the ap.ectre seemed displeased, u if the
donor had nut tteattHI him with re~pect : atld ex~
tulateda.litt!e with b).o, telling bim be ·could have
tenified him into a compliance, but he chose to come
ca!mly IUJd q.uieH)I to him; and used tome other di11·
courses, so civil and obliging, tbat ttr this rime be be·
Ran to- be a little more ft~mi!iar, and at len,th the doc•
tor asked.
What is it you wouM ~ave with me?
At this. the apparition, as ifgratified witb the quet.
tion, began his story thus :
I lived i~ the county of Somerset, where I left a
very good estate, which my ~randson enjoys at this
time.o But he is fUed for the possession. by my two
nephews, the sons of my younger brothel:- .
Here he gave his o.wo name, the name ofhis young-·
t:r brother, and. th" names of his two nephews; but l
a.n n.Jt allo.ved to publi.sh the names in this relatiou•.
,nor might it be proper for mJny reasons,
The doctor then interrupted,. and .
'llsked him bow
· l;ng the grandsot~ had ,been in poss~ssion of the estate;
\vhich he told him.was seven years, intimating that be
had been so ·long .de~d: ~·. .
Then he wcni.cn, apd told him that his nephew!
'wou'ii be wo ~ar~ for h.is ~r4nds"n in the suit, and
would d.eprive 'bi~ ~~f the mansion ho~se and estate;

coming to the head of the stair cue where they came

ef her wonderful love to her, and care ofher, .that ah

Now, why Mr. Veal should tbiak this relation a
reflection (as its plain he does, by hia endeavouring

Jooked to, until I was brought to becl, and 9-'e 1 again,
and then I shou-

And accoJdingly, said the apparition, I was one nigH
late sent away with one Mark Sharpe,. \tho, upon a
moor (naming a place the miller- knew} ~lew me with
a pick (such as men dig coals withal) and gave me
tbue five wounds, tmhfter threw my body into a coat·
pit hard by, and hid the pick under a bank ; and his _
shoes and stockings being bloody he -ende!lvoured to
wash them, but seeing the blood would not wash c.ut,
be hid them there. And the apparition further told
the m!ller that he must be t~e man to reveal it, or else
abe must still appear- an~- haunt-him. The miHer. re•
turned home very sad and heavy, bat spoke not one-
word of what he had seen, but eschewed as much as
be could to stay in the mill'within night without corn•
pany thinking thereby to escape the seeing again of.
that fri~htful apparition,
But t•otwithstanding, one ni~ht when it began to-
be dark, the apparition meJ him again, and sl'emed
very fierce and cruel, and threatened him, that if he
clid not reveal the murder, she would continually pur-
sue and haunt hi~, Yet for all this, he still concealed'
it until St. Thomas-eve, before Christmas, when, be--

Hndered from prosecuting that work in such sort as to
{)ring it to a proper conclusion, being prevented by
such intervening business as his p111blic cccupation re-
quired him to execute.
About six weeks after he had r~ceh·.ecl the GermaR
copy, being well in health, and in bed with- his wife,
between twelve and one ofthe clock, there appeared
to him standing at the side of the bed, an ancie~t maa
eloathed in a light eoloured habit, and of a most rev-
erend aspect, having a broad and white · bear~, which
hung as low as lolis girdle, who smiling at him said~
iu a gentle manner of rebuke, " Will you not take-

" provide you both time and place to do it ;" and

This extraordinary vision affrig!Jted. him so muah
that he fell into an extreme sweat; so that his wife
awaking, and finding him aJI oYer wet, she asked hi.lf
what he ailed ? He then related to her his vis~olil,

two messengers cam~ from the Ccuncil Board,. with a

DAVID Hu,nter, .n~t herd to the Bishop's house
at Portmore, there appeared to him one night, c:arry.
in6 a log ofwood into the dairy, an old woman, whicb
amazed him, for he knew her not; but hia fright made
him throw away his log ~f wood and run into the house.
The next night she ·appea1ed again to him~ and he
could not ch.ase but follow her all night; and so ah
most every night for three q~arrers ofa year. Whenever
ehe came, he IIIU&t- go with her through the woodsat a
good 1-ound rat~ ; and the poor fellow looked as if he
was bewitched and travelh:d of his leg,, Aod when
in bed with his wife, if .she appeared, he must rise and
go. And because his wife could not bold him fn his
bed, she would go too :and ~alk after him till day.
though she aaw nothing; bp~ b!~ little dog was so well
acquainted with the apparition, that he wvuld follow
her as\.ull as her master. If a tree stood in her. walk
he observed ber always to go through it. lo all th.is
while she spoke not.
But one day the said David going over a hedge, into
the highway, she camejust against him, and he· cried
C>ut, ~~ Lord bless me, would 1 waa dead; shall I ne-

,. ver be delive~d from this misery?" 'At which, and
the Lord ble'ss nie too, says stte, it was very happy you
spoke ·first, for.·till thew, t !lad no power to speak,
. . I
'tnttO'gti l h'ave ' fc:ltt~d'y3~so !ong. My name, says

shall ftnd ·t~enty eight shillings. Let him pay what I
owe in ~uch a place, and the rest to the charge unpaia
·at iny funeral ;-and•go- to- my son that lives here, which I
had by my Jattel" htisb.&n~. and tell him that he liv.es a
wicked and dissolute life, and is very· unnatural and
ungrateful.to hu brother that maintained him;. and. ;!
he does not mend his lif.e God Almighty will destroy
him.'·
David Hunter told her he never knew her, No, says
the, I died'seven years before you came into the coun•
tr)·; but for all that, . if he would do her mes511ge, she
would never hurt him. But he deferred doing as the
apparition bid him, arm she appeared the night afteF·
as he lay in bed, and struck him on the shoulder ve.
ry harcJ ; at which he cried out, and asked hel' if she
did not promise she would not hurt him ? She $aid,
tllat wu ifhe did h~1 it~essage, if not, she would kill
him. He told her, he eould not go now, by reaso11
the. waters..were out. She saiJ, she 'fa~, @9~~ be
should
'
.ahould stay til) they were abated; but charged him ·
afterwards· not.to fail her. So he did her errand, and ·
afterwards she appeared . and gave him thanks, For
Dow, Nid she,. I shall be.at rest, therefore pray you lift
me up. from the ground, and 'I will trouble. you ne
more. So Davad Hunter lifted her up from ·thi! ground,.-
and as he said, •he felt just like a bag of feather~ ih kia ·
arms. So she vanished, and he heard most delicate ·
music as she went off, over ·his head, and .he · n~ver ,
was troubled again•.

ONthe first Sabliath day, in the ~·ear IH9• Mr.·
lilly, the son 1..1f a farmer in the parish of K.:lso, in
Roxburgshire, a young man inte,~d~~~~o ~~ churctr
of
.( 59 )
or Scotljlnd, and who then bad made QO maall progress
in literature, remained at home to keep the ho•~e, in
.companv with a shephe.rd's laoy, all the rest of the fa·
mily, ucept a maid $ervant, being at · s~rmou. The
you'lg 'Student ani the boy being sitting by the fire,
·Whilst lhe gi.Jl was gnne to the well for some water,
a venerable old gentleman, c!ad in an antique garb, pre•
·•ented himself, and afte1 some htue ceremony, desir.d
the student to take up tile f.unily bible, which lay ''D
the table, ,and turn ov~r to a c.ortain cliaP.ter .1nd verse
Jn the s.econd .book of Kinge. The . student did. so,
and read, " there is death in the pot. ••
On this the old mao, with much appareat agitation,
.pointed to the great family pot boiling on the fire,
.declaring, that the maid had cast a great quantity of
.arsenic into it, withintent to poison the whole family,
to the end she might rob the bouse of the hundred gui·
.-neas which she knew her masttr hlld lately taken for
.sheep and srain, which be had told. .Just •• he was
·•o uying, the JDaid c:ame to the door, announcing her
..approach by the nolee of tbe naile in her shoe heeb.
The old. gentleman taid to the -student, remember my
w.trning and save the lives of the family ! and that
.instant rueappeared.
The maid entered witha·smiling C()Untenance, emptieq
•her pail and returned to the well .'tJr a fresh supply.
·Mean while young.Li'ly put some oatmeal into a wood-
.en dish, skimmed the ·put of the fat and mixed it for what
~ caUed.broae or...croildy,.and when the mi,id re1
turned

he, with 'the boy, appeared busily employed $n eatm1 .
the mixture. Come Peggy, said the student, here is
enoagb left for you ; are not you fond of croudy ?.She
amiled, took up the dish, an'd reaching a horn spoon, ·
withdrew to the back room. The shepherd's ·dog fol•
•
lowed her, unseen by tht:·boy, and the ·poor animal,
on the croudy being put down by the maid, fell a victim
to his voracious appetite ; for before the return of the
family from church, it was enormously swelled, and e.z:•
pired in great agony•
.The student enjoined the boy to rem~inquite passive
for the present, mean while;he attempte"d to shew hia
ingenuity in resolving the <:ause of the canine catastro-
phe into insanity, inorcler to ke-ep the girl in counte-
llance till a.fit opportunity of aisco~ering •the plot
ahoul..J present itself.
·Soon after his tather, mother, brothers, and ·sisters,
, with the other servants, returned from church, all very
·hungery~ and ·eager to sit down round the .rustic ·
board.
The table was instantly retJenished _with wooden
bowls and trenchers, while a heap of ·barley bannocks
gr.aced the top. -The k..il or broth, infused with leeltB
or winter cabbages, was poured.forth in plenty ; and
Peggy, with a prodigal hand, filled all the dishes with
the homely dainties ot Ti viotdale. The master b*'gan
grace, and all hats and bonnets were ip~taritly off?
" 0 .Lord," prayed the fa~mer, "we have been hearing
~~ thy word, from the mouth ofthy aged servant, Mr.
o,,<~,,dbyGoo~~msay .
4 ·Jlamsay; we have been al~rmed by the awful ra·min'e
-.c in Samaria, and of death being in the pot." Here
'the young student interrupted his father, by exclaim-
-ing Yes sir, there is death in tke pot now here, as well
as there was once·in lsra__el! Touch not ! taste not! SH
-:the dog dead by the poisoned·· pot !
What! cried Ihe farmer, have you been raising tlte
·tlevil by your conjuration·? Is this the effect of your
atutly sir? No, father, said the student; I pretend to
'llO such arts of magic or necromancy, .. but this ilay,
·as·the boy can tettify, I had a solemn WJrning from un'e
whom I take to be no demon, but a good angel. To
~-him we aH owe our lives. As to ·Peggy, accordi~g tQ
1 .his intimation, she has put poison into tbe pot for th·a
-purpose of destroyiug the whole family root _
!lnd
:branch ! Here the girl fell· into a fit, from whielt be·
4 ·ing with some tr0ubl~t recovered, she confesseJ ·the
whole of her deadly design, and was auff'.;r~td to with•
·draw from the family and her uative country. She
was soon after ~xccuted at Newcastle upon Ty~e, for
. ~the murder of her b~stard child, , a~ain making ample

SoME time ag10 a lady dreamt th:tt a frightful figure.
appeared at the window of her dining ·oom, which
was full of company. Upon her enquiring what it·
was, they told her it was Death. She begged they.
would keep him out; but h·: forced his way in, an~

...__ ..
\
that b-e might be kept from her; upon whieb be anewer~
ed her, She might put him from her for nioe days.
but then he should retll4,P.,.to.her and take no denial.
1mmediately after, sh.e was translated into ·heaven,
where she saw a great company alt singing, and very
happ}l. But as she knew ·not the tune, nor the words,
she was very melancholy. At ·ength she sat down in
a coraer by herself, when an angel came to her, and,
asked her why she looked so melancholy, as nothing
but happiness wu there? She· replied, because she
c:ould_not j..>rn. He then asked·.her, how she came
there? She answered, she · did not know. Upon
which be opened a door, and let her down'into a most
dreadful place which she four.d to be hell, w!Jere she
tieard such shrieks and cries o! the. damned, that abe
awaked,

directions given him where to drive. As be was en
rying his passengers, he thought he was called to as
cend an exceeding steep hill ; and when he reached-,
the summit, he found the declivity ofthe hill still more ·
troublesome. Howevet, with great difficulty he got.,
tlown, and as he proceeded he ardved at a pair ofgreat.
iron gates, wide opeo. When he had passed them, he.
found himselfin an uncommonly dark .md gloomy place·
·ion which were vast c::rcwds of people dressed in mourn-
i~:g, all of whom by their countenauces, seemed to be,
ii1 a very pensive frame~ot mind. Hereupon he stop~ _
ped and a~ked one of the persons-what place that was?·
He answered it was hell. Hell!· (saiJ the coacbmae)

The first misunderstanding betwJen the parties, was
owing to his eldest son'• desire ofgoing abroad, which

fM., and they were honourably paid ; but · after some
time,. the motber-in-law prevailing at home, one of•
hi.s bills ofexchange--was refused, and being protes:ed,
was sent back wittJOut a£ceptance ; upon which he·
drew oo more, nor did he write any more letters, or.
tHs father hear more about hiru for upwards. of· four ·
years, or thereabouts.
lJpon this long silence• the mother in· law lllftde her
advantage several ways: she first intimated to his father
tha~ he must needs be dead; ancl, couseqHently his-
estate sbould be &ett.led upon her ei.Jt:st svu,, (fur she.·
had several ~hiklren.) His,father- withstvod the nw.
lion ver}' firmly, but the wife hlrrassed him with hPr·
illlportunitier.; and she a-rgued upon two points against
mm, I mean the son,
· First, If he- WdS dead, then there- was no roo~ to
object, her son being heir at law,
Sec9nd1y, If·he was not dta<l, his behaviour to his·
father, in not writing for so loag a time, was inexc'usa.
ble, and· he ought to resent it, and settle the estate u
ithe were dead; that nothing could be more disebe-
dient, and his .father ought to depend upon it tllat he·
wu ac·.ual:y dead, and treat him as-if he was so; for
he that ·wQuld use a fdther so, should be taken for one ·
d-ead, as to-· his fili:al relation,. and !I.e treated accord·
iogly.
His father howeve-r stood out for a long time. and
~ld her, that h• couJd QOt-answerj5 ,!~,,Q!l ~t_cience ;·

whjGb ~igJ!l rendei his son ~nable to write; .that be-.·
IJiigbt be taken by the. Turks, and carried· into slavery ;
or he might be among the Persians or Arabians {which ·
it atems was the case) and so could not get any_letters .
conveyed; and that he, could not be 111tisfied to· disin-
. herit him, till he knew whether he had reason tor it, or ·
whether his son had offended him or not.
These answers, however just, were far from·stop-"
ping her illlpOrtunities, . which stu~ carried ·on so far,...
thilt she-was perpetually teazing; him 4nd the gentlem•n·.
was so wearied out with it, tha.t o11ce or twice he came
to a kind of consent to- do it; but his heart failing him
he as often relented.
However, her restless solicitations at lut produced ·
thi~ conditional agreemPnt; that if he did not hear from
hjs son within four. yean, he ~ould consent to a · re•
settling the estate.
She \\aS not well satisfied with this conditional·
agreement; but being al>le to obtain no other, was ·
obliged to accept of it as it was; though, as sbe often·
told him, she was far from being satisfied with it as to
time.
He grew angry at her telling him so, and answered'
that she ought to be very well satisfied with it, for
that it was time little enough, a~ his s"n's circ~mstan•
ces might happen to be.

Tbe fray partea that night with iU words, and ilf
mture enough: but he little thought sbe intended as
she said, and the next day ht bad forgot it all, and Wat ·
as good humoured as if nothing had happened.
But be found his wife chagrine'd and disturbed ve!Y
much, full of resentment, and threatening him witli
what she resolved ·to do.
J.Iowever> he little tho~ht she intended him the
mischiefshe had in her bead; and offered lo talk friendly'
ti> her, but she rejected it with soorn. and told him sru~
would be as good u her word; for she would not live
with a ·mall' that should bring the devil into the roorrt
whenever· he thou-~ht proper, in order to murder his·
w4fe.
H~ strove to pacify ber by f~i1 wards, but she tald
him sb., was in earnest with him ; and in a word she~
w~s in ·earnest, for she went away to a justice, and made·
aa affiJavit that her husband had a fdmiliar. spirit, an<!·-
that she went i"- danger of her life, so obtained'a war•.
rant to apprehend him.
In short she brought home a warrant, shewed it her-
l!usband, and told him, she had not given it into the:·
hands of an· "fficer, because he should have the liberty
to go voluntarily before the justice of the pt>ace; and :
if he thought' fit to let her know when ·he would he1
ready, she would be ·so too, and would get some of her
owh friends to· go along with her.·
He was surprilted ·at th~s, .for he little ·thought .she
had been in earnest with him, and et;~d~1''@S(;elJ~o Jla•·..
••t~ her .by all possible means; she ·did this to trightefl
him, and so inde~d she had; for though the thing hacJ
nothing in it o~ guilt, but he found it might expose
him very much, and being loth to have such a thing
brought upon the stage against him, he used all the
intreaties with her that he was able and begged her not
to do it.
' .
But the more he humbled himself, the more she
. uiumpbed over him, and carrying things to an unsuf~
ferible height of itttOlence, she told him at last, she
would make him do justice, as she called it, that sh.e
was sure she could have him punished, if he continued
obstinate, .and slle would not be exposed to witchcraft
and forcery, for she did not know to wha& length be
ll)ight carry it.
To bring the story to a conclusion; sbe got the
better of him to such a degree, that he offered to refer
the thing to indiff~rent persons, friends or. both sides ;
and they met !leveral tillles, but could bring it to no
conclusion. His friends said, there was nothing ·in it,
and they wouhl not have him comply with any thing
upon the pretence of it ; that he called for his son,
and somebody opened the <"asement and cried Hrre ;
that there was uot the least evidence of witchcraft
in that, and insisled that she could make nothing of
it.
Her frier\ds carried it high, instructed b)· her She
off'ered to swear, that he had threatened her before
with his son's ghost; that now he had visibly raised
a spectre, for that calting upon his ,~o~~ ~(~8g
\f~s dead
~ . ~
( 77 )
to be sure, the ghost .jmrnediate!y apptared; that he
could not have called on the ~evil thus to per~onate
his son, if he had not dea: t with the devil himself, and
bad a fami1iar spirit, and thit this was of dangerou
consequence ·to -her. ·
Upon the whole, the man wanted courage to stand it,
and was afraid of being exposed ; so that he was griev•
ously perplexed, 'and knew not what to do~ -
When sbtt found him humbled as much as she' ·
could desire, she told him, if he would do her justice,
as she called .it, (that is to say, settle his estate uport :
her son) she would put it up, on condition that be
would promise to frighten her no more with raising the
devil.
That part of the proposal exasperated him again,·
and be upbr••ided her with the slander of it, and told
her he defy'd her, and she might do her ._,orst. .
Thus it l:roke off all treaty, and she began to threa~
ten him aga'n; however at length she brought hinl
to comply, a_!ld he g1ve a writing under his hand to
her, st>me of her friends being by, promising tbat he
would comf>ly, if his son did not arrive or send a11
account of himself, within four months.
She was satisfied with this, and they were all made
frtends again, and accordingly he gave her the writing;
but when he delive1ed it to her, in the presen·ce <>fl,er
two arbitrators, he tookthe ~berty to say to her, with
a ~rave ·and solemn kind of speech;
~; Look you, ycu have worried me into this agree•

sjgnifies tbe writing? Why do yo~ promise what
)'Oil do not intend shaH be done? This will but kin-
dle a new flamt= to be~in with, when the time fixed
expires.
Why, says he, I am satisfied in my mind, that my
'Pn is alive.
Comt, come, says his wife, speaking to the g«'ntlemao
that had argued with her husband, let him sign the
agreement, and let me alone to make him puform th~
.:onclitions.
Well, says the husband, you shall have the writing.
and you shall be let alone, but_ I am satisfied you "will
uever ask me to perform it; a,nd yet l am nu wizard,.
a,rlds ht:, as you have wicke~ly ~uggested.
She replied, that she would p1 ove that he dealt with
Jhe devil, to~ that he raised an evil spirit br only calling
his son by his Dilme, and so began to tell the story of

A Yisian se.en b' Dr. Do~tne.
DocTOR Donne and his wife lived for some time
iii London with Sir Robert Drury. Sir Robert, hav-
ing occasion to go "to Paris took the Doctor along with
him, whose wife was left big with child at Sir Robert's
house. Two days after their·arrival.at Paris, Dr." Donne
was lef: alone in the room where Sir Robert and he,
and some other friends had.dined together. Sir Robert
returned in half an bout'. and as he had left, so !Je found"
the Doctor alone; but i-n so.~ch an ecstasy;.and so al-
tered in his looks, as amazed Sir Robert to behold.-
He enquired the cause ; and after some time the Doctor
told him he had seen a dreadful vision. I have seen
nys he, my dear wife pass twice by me, through this
room, with her hair hanging about her shoulders, 'and
a dead child in her arms. A messenger w~s immnli-
ately dispatched to England, to enquire after Mrs.
Donne, and it appeared, that she had been hrvught to
bed of a dead child, after a long and dangerous loabour,
about the very hour that Dr. Donne affirmed he saw
her pass by him in his chamber at P.nis.

MAY 2 ), J 768, and the two following days; being

it; The well-known chancter of the person, excludea

many that believe the bible pay, to tho~e who do not
believe it. l owe them no such strvice, l take

has been raised, and with Sllch insolence spread through·
out the nation, in direct opposition not only to the
bible, but to the suffrage ot the wisest and best of men
in all ages· and nations. They we:! knO\.,, (whether

we shou'd ~uffef.even this weapon to be w1ested out of

One of the capital objections to all tbP.se accounts•
which I have known urged over and over is this, "Did
you ever &ee an appariti_
on .yourself?" No: nor did I
ever see a murder. Yt!t I believe there i~ such a thing:
yea, and that in one place or another murder is con.
mitted tvery day. Therdore 1 caunot as a reasonable

haps never may. The testimony of unexceptionable

other. ..-
But to set this aside, it bas been confi,lently alledged.
that many of these have seen their error, and have been
clearly convinced, that the supposed preternatural ope•
ntion was the mere c:ontrivance- of artful men . The
famous instance of this, which bas been spread far and
wide• was the drwnming .in Mr. Mo , esson'a house at
Tedworth; who it was said ackoo\Vledged, "It was all
" a trick, and .that he had found out the whole contri•

then they could-hardly unclasp his fingers• I wou)ll

went away he waved his hand to me, and I heard de-
lightful music, as if many persons were singing t~

In about sbc weeks I grew better. I was then musing
,one night, whether I did well in desiring he might
.come ? And I wu prayini that God would do his

But he was not in ~is usual dress : he had on a whi~

well pleased. About one there stood by him a person

Warning •Ja Murder by a Dream;
A Young gentleman in the city of Dublin, in Ire•
land, dreamed otte night that his sister (who ,.,;as lately
married, and lived at so10e small distance) had been
murdered : and waking, it gave him same uneasiness;
but finding it was only a dream, he went to sleep again,
when he dreamed the same thing. Then he got up,
put on his night•gown, went to the apartment of an
old lady, und told. 6er his dream with great agitation
of mind. Sbe ·smiled at him, and said, she wondered
that a gentleman of his understanding .should be so
troubled about a dream, and bid him go to bed again.
Pie did so; fell asleep, and dreamed the third time that
his sister was murdered. He then got up and dressed
i1imself with all speed, hastened to his sister's house~
~here he found her cut and mangled in abarbarous
marmer, by her most cruel husband, a rank papist: .it
seems they had been disputing about religion. She
just lived to speak a few words to her brother, and
then expired of her wounds; aud the base villain was
I:Juick!v apprehended, hied, and hanged for_the same.

A Merchant or London; 6eiilg on :e Continent
upon business, chanced to meet an old school-ftllt>w,
who had turned Roman Catholic, and received priest's
orders. This meeting naturally recalled their former
affection and friendihip, and induced them, regardless
of the difference oftheir 8entiinents, to spend the even·
. ing in a manner·the most agreeable and convivial,_:
T~is was in French Flanders; and the wine being
good~ ~d them insensibly on to a midnight conversati.
on, in which religion becarm the principal topjc,- ·
That, as in but two often the case between persons o{
different persuasions, was carried beyond all b~tmds of
decency on t.oth sides; and the merchant, who had
read many polemical books, got the •e!ler of the argu-
ment in favour of the reformed religion of his c:ountry,
which the otber had abandoned, Tbe priest appeared

coverecl the emotions of his mind. At Jeng'th, however,
appearing to resume his ple~santry and good nature, he
invited the merchant to breakfast, witb him tbe next.-
~orning at a convent, over which he presided.
They then parted in the utmost friendship, and the
merchant soon after went to bed, where soon falling
asleep, be fell into a dream of the most frightful nature.
l:fe thought he ebtered a den where were ten thousands- ·
of hissi~g serpents, one ofwhich twisting its train round
his neck, darted its sting into his bossom. The dread
of this instantly awaked him, and caused him to start
from his couch in the greatest agitation. His mind.
the remainder of the night was in g~eat agony. He
againl'ltdeavoured to compose himself to sleep, but all
i'n vai~. the hcmor of the vision hung on his iruagioa-
tloo, till the sun arose, when be got ~p, and walked
out to a field to receive the cheering gaiea wafting the
odours.from the vines and the fragrant flowers.
Meeting a friend and countryman, who waa a military
captain, and headed a party of soldiers en~mped in the .
vicinity, who quickly discovered the tcthfusi~ h~
rt~ind was in, he opened the whole business, told bia
dream; and promised to meet him again after he had
breakfasted at the convent. Alt ough I pay but little

captain promised to. c:lQ•.
As nine o'clock the mer<:hant knocked·at the gate of'
the convent; and· was met by the priest, who welcomed
him to the place with every expression of friendship•
Then. conducting him up a stair-case, they came to a
door, whiCh the prie-st opened. After some ceremonies,.
they advanced along a gallery, at the end of which.
were ~o to~ding doors, which, on the priest's ringi.ng

This honest man had be!!!n for rnany years mucb
disturb-ed and tormented in his body, and had recourse
for relief to all the most eminent phystc:iana of the age,
even trom Dr. Daniel Turner, of Devonshire-square,
to the [::feat Dr. Ratcliff himself: but aU ·waa to no
purpose; each Doctor declared ·him a wonder an11 a
~ystery to _I he then known practice of their art, and
lefl him as much a wonder as they found him. Neither
could the professors of surgery guess at his ailment,
which seemed to all a complication of diseases: and
after having spent from first to last, all his substance
in sealch ofacure, he f~Uld all theirendeavours inef·
fectual.'
The ignorant and superstitions adjudged the disor•
der to witchcraft; but the more discerning considered
him as under the afflicting hand of Pro~idence, who
would deliver him in his own time.
The task therefore of curing him was re~erved tb a
-supernat<~ral power. It bappened one evening as he
was sitting alone in .his own bed-room, and no pers,on
in the house, he heard somebody come into the room,
the door of which was only uppn the latch, and turn•
iog, he saw a venerabl~_old mao with white hair and
beard, aQd of a more revennd aspect than any persoti
b-e could recollect to have. ever seen. The emotion
··- which this visitant's sudden appearance caused in Mt.
Jonts's mind P£CVented · him from asking him whom
he

lie was, ancl from whence, and the Illness o'f bla body
hindered him from observing tbe common rules of ci·
vility in accummodaLing him with a seat; but the :visi•
tor was fiOt of thill world anti thuefore soug!lt not the
civilities of it. " I am come, triend, to direct thee to
" ·use the means for thy recovery ; every morning, as
" thou risest drink halt a pint of thine own water, and
" after thou findest relief, reduce the quantity to half
•
& but add a pint of the decoction of ground-ivy, and
" then return thanks to thy God whq gives thee bles.
1ings."
· Mr. Jones receind the ad\'ice with the respect the
gravity of it required, and taking courage to speak, saw
the apparition, for such it certainly was, retire, the door
being shut ft seemed to open and shut again 1 and when
Mr. Jones's ~urse came in, he related to her what he
bad seen, which she entirely thFn attributed to the
state of his mind, for she observed that as the door
was locked, and she had the key in her pocket, nobody
could eriter without her knowledge. But the case,
boV~oev.er was a tact, that Mr. Jones ohservin~ tne direc..
tions he had n:ceived in this extraordinary mauut r,
. recovered so fai: as to be ab!e to go about his urdmary·
business, and to bur sermons at his usual pl.tce vf wor~

THERE having been a·long contest between Le--
JP~el M.tttt.e.~s, archdeacon mthe county of Down,ar.d
Cl~dius Gilbert, minister of Belfast about their right
to Dru mbeg, a small parish near Belfast; it proved
troublesome to the parishioners, who paid their dues to ·
Mr. Gilbert, the incumbent. The archdeacon claimed
it to be paid to him also, for which he procured a war-
rant; and in ·the execution.of it by hls sen·ants, at the
house of one Charles Loftin, they offered some violence
to his wife who refused entrance, and who died of the
i,Yury a few weeks after; but she being an infirm
woman, little notice wa~ taken of her.death, till some
time after, by her strange appearance to one Thomas
Donelson, .a spectator of the violence done to her,)
she aff.ighted him into a prosecution of Robert Eccle-
aon, the criminal. She appeared divers times, but
#Jtiefly upon one Lord's·day eve~log, when she fetched

were called in, to whom he gave notice that she was
llgain coming, and b.:ckor.ed to him to come out; upon
which, they went to shut the door, but he forbad it,
saying, that she looked with a terrible aspect upon him
when they offered it. His fdends laid hold on him
and embraced him, that he might not again go out;
notwithstanding which; (a plain evidence of some invi-
sible power) he was drawn out of their bands· in a
su.rprising manner, and carried abroad into th.e field
and yard as before, she ·charging him to prosecute Ec-
cles-Jn; which voice, as also Donelson's reply, the
people heard though they saw no shape. There are
many witnesses of all this yet alive, particularly Sarah
the vuife of Charles Loftin, son to the deceasecl woman ;
and one william Holiday and his wife, &c.

Newcastle, Dec. 29, 1 7)8• ·
LAsT Monday I took down the following particulars
from John and Ann ~ambert, of Winlington. The
truth of which they are ready to confirm on oath.
J.Ienry Cooke, of Winlington, (a Roman Catholic);
departed this life, in the year -
J 7S2. and John and Ann ·
Lambert took the house be died in. A few days after
their removal to the bouse, Ann was greatly surprized
with a noise in an inner room; the door shook very ·
rpuch, and the latch was lifted up several times.-
About a week after this, John and Ann heard a knock·
ing over the bed; (in which they lay) which seemed
to l>e between the roof and the plastering. Afln heanl
~he same noise three nights after. . Ab<1ut a fortnight
after tl~is (~nd one year and-a half after the death uf
lienry Cook) Ann Lambert, at one o'clotk iu the
L i day,
day, saw 'in an inner room an appearance resembling a
m~n dressed in his grave clothes, which frightened her
so that she sooned away, and was lifeless for s'ometime :
upon which they immediately left that house antJ re-
moved to another about 'JOO yards from it. A month
after their removing to this house Ann was suddenly
~urpdsed, as bhe lay in bed, by a stroke given to the .
I edside. About a week after this, as she lay awake in
bed with her hu5band, at midnight she saw at the fur-
ther end.of the room a $quare light, and in the middle
t,f irf the appearance cf a wan's he.td as white a;chatk.
Sile awoke her husband, who saw it likewis~. Four
days after; she heard, at one_o'clock in the morning, a_
noise like the report of a large gun behind her; upon
which she got up and stired the fire, but could see no-
thing; she then returned to her bed, but had scarcely
laid down, when to her surprize 6he saw stand-
ing by the bedside an appearance, dressed in a surplice
and white wig. She said, cc In the name of God the
Father, &c. why do you trouble me?" Pie ;answered.
"meet me at one o'cloci>, ahd I will tell you what I
want;'' and then vanished away. No J!lore noise was
heard that night, but the uext morning there were two
bcavy strokes given behind the bed, soon after her
hu6band got up and went to his work. He had not
been gone long, whtn she felt the heavy presst,tre-,

· which was accompanied with a loud noise like the re-
port of·a large cannon; after this all was hushed fer
some minutes, and then there was a shaking in the
room, like the wind shaking of.trees ; the ap~rition
then appeared •t the bed's foot, like a man in hia work·
ing dress, and passing on slowly disappeared. Some
days after this, as she lay in bed with her husband and
children, (for they all Ia}' ~ogether) about eleven
o'elock at night, there was a great noise like a cannon,
followed with a heavy pressdre ; then one of the chil•
dren (a lirl five years ol~) was taken out of the bed,
aQd carried to the middle of the room, and laid on the
floor. The mother cried out~ and her husband got up
- and brought the child into bed again. In the morning
the child complained of a soreness under her thigh ;
it being examined, nothing could be discovered but
the mark of a pinch in the llesh, which iocreased every
day more and more, and ~rew worse and worse till the
c:hild was obliged to take her \)ed, and remained five
weeks under the Doctor's bands. The nex~ night the
noise was ·as usual. The youngest child lying in the
mother'a bosom, w~s snatched from her, and carried out
of bed ; the mother immediately followed, and found
her child laid on the ground unhurt. The night fol·
lowing the noise was repeated, and the eldest child was
partly .dragged out of the bed; but upon·the child's
shrieking, ~he pt~rents awoke and pulled her in agair. :
the
the bed shook very mucl1 at these times. Being thus
terrib'y frightened, and much fatigued for want of -
na•
tunl reat, they resolved once more to change their
habitation, to see if this ~ould put an end to these
uncommon vtsus. ~ccordingly they removed their
little all into a house at the other end of the town.--
The third nig~t after their removal, they were much
Bisturbed by an uncomm"n scratching or scraping at
-their room door, and a great tight at the same time ap•
peared at the foot of the. bed. The -same week the
presstJre and noise were repeated; a few nights after
her husband felt the pressure, which he thought would
have pressed him through the bed.
About three weeks after, at night, there wu a great
rumblin& in the next room, when Ann asked, " In tile
name of God what art thou?" but there WllS no answer:
and the noise ceased, Soon after her husband wentto
wort ; about an hour after he was gone, she uw Henry ·
Cook stand at her lied's foot, dressed in the clothes
whtch he wore during his life time: she was so. over.
powered that she could not speak, so he v;~nished away.
All remained quiet for a week; no noise was heard,
nor anv thin>l. seen, but on sunday night the noise began
-again, and therE' seem...d to ·be a man grinding with a
hand-mill over thelf heads : then the sash window
shook very rr uch, so that they thought all the glass
had been bruken; b':'t upvn eXllmining it in the morn.

four corners, and brolte-,in the middle in the etwpe of
a diamond. Nothing remarkable happened from July
1 7r;_s. the 'time the window wo~s. broke, till December.
save a continual noise in the house, and a lar"e cat
killed in an uncommon manner. Dec z. As Ann
.was making her bed at night, she saw a small black
four-footed beast run along the bolster, and disappeared.
Two ~r three nights after he saw the apparition iQ the
likeness of a brown and white calf; it grew bigger
and bigger till it was the size of a middling horse,
then it leapt into the bed and struck her three timet,
but she received no hurt, Dec, 6. At midnight,
John being awake in bed, saw Henry Cooke, dressed
in his. working clothes, come into the room; who
walked to the fire-side, and stood there a considerable
time; but he was so overcome that he could not speak,
. and the apparition vanished away. Dec. :zo. At mid.,.
night Ann felt the hands of 11 man on her face as cold
as ice, which kept teazing her. till she awo.k,e her hus-
band, and then they were' removed. Dec, zz. About
.two o'clock in the morning, she. saw as it were a pew•
ter dish the colour of blood, 'with blood sprinkled
round the edges of it. This was the last time she saw
it, which was the morning I took down this account.

William Dyke (late ot Skilgate. in this county, now.
likewise deCA:ased) be pleased to take. the relation from.
a WQrthy and learned gentleman, Dr. Thon,as Dyke, a
nnr kinsman of the Caprain's, Shortly after the Ma-
jor's death, the Doctor· was desired to coRte to the-
bouse, to take care ·of a child that was sick ; and, in his-
Wa}' thither, he (ailed on tl1e Cap!ain, wtll was very..

not met with so encouraging art opportunity. After
their arrival at the house, and the civitity of.the peo•
pie shewn ·them in that entertainment, .they were· con·
ducted to their lodging, which they desired might be
together i!l the same bed. After they had lain awhile,
the Captain knocked, and bade- the servant brir>' bim
two of the li11gest aud .highest caudles, lighted, which
he could get: whereupon the Doctor enquired what he
llltant by this? The Captain answered, '' You 'know,

tke hours of twel I! and one, come to the little bouse
which his here ·m the ~arden, and there give a full ac•

•nould be sure to be present there at the set time, ancl
so receive a full satisfaction. And this (says the Cap•
tain) is the very night, and I am come on f urpose to
fulfil my promise," The Doctor advised him, not to
follow strange counsels, for which he cottld have no
warrant. the Captain replied, ''That he had solemnly
engaged, and that nothing should discourage him;''
-~nd added, ·" That if the Doctor would wake awhile
with him, he "ould thank him; if not, he might com•
,pose himself to rest: but, for his ow:t part, he was
nsolved to watch, that he might be sure to be present
at the hour appointed." To that purpose he set hb
watch bv him, and as Scl•'~ as he perceived that it was
. )
half an huur past eleven, he arose, and taking a candle
in each hand, went out by a back -door, of which- he
had before got the key, and walked into the garden•
bouse, where he continued two hours and a half. At
his return, he declared, he neither saw nor heard any

At.uut 11X weeks after, the Captain rode to Eaton,
to place hb son a scholu there, when the Ductor went
tbi,her with him. They lodged at ·the s1gn of the
Chrislopher, a.·d 111rried two or tbree nights ; not l)iog
together now, as beture at Dulverton, but in two ·se-
ver..! chambers. The mornin' before they went awa)••
the Captain staid in his chamber longer than usual
before he cal!ed the Doctor. At length he came into
the Doctor's cnamber, but with his hair and eyes star•
ing, and his whole body shaking and trembling.....
Whereat the Doctor wonde"

"What is the matter?'' The Captain replied, "I haYe

Captain said, 1• If ever 1·saw him in my life, I saw him

After which worck he presently disappeared.
The ·Captain was aot only thoroughly persuaded of
what he had tbua seen and heard, but was, from that
time, observed to be very muc!l aB"ected with it.-
Aod it was judgetl, by those who were well acquainttd

Accordingly, dinner being over, he goes dewn to
1erid. him up to dhmer. And when he came to the
counting house door; there sat his man with the book·
keeper also, writing as he left him, ·
It happened just that 'moment, some occasion extra•
ordinary obliged him to step back aillin, and go up
1
•tairs to the dini~g room, from whence he came; and
intending not to stay, he did not speak to the young
man, but left him in the counting house, and went im. I
mediately up stairs.
It was not possible that he, or any one else, e~cept
such as could walk invisibly, could go by, or pass him ··1
11nseen : good manners would have hinderea the young
'JJI.an frqm thrusting by his master upon the stairs, if I
he had been going up; but he is positive he did not,
and could not p11 s without being seen.
J
But when he came to the top of the stairs, there sat
the young man at dinner with the other se_
rvants; · the
room they dined in being a little parlour, which ~pen­
ed just against the stairs, so that he saw him all the way
()t ihe upper part of the stair-case, and could-not be de·

to look, and he was there -really at dinner,; so that what
be {the maste;~ saw below in ttie counting_
bouse, must
be the apparition; as it certainly was.
. But this waa not all : The young gentleman embark·
ed as aboye, and .arrived safe wilh all his effects i,n
Americ.., though he never lived to return, However,
I cannot. say ms 'llppariiion, in the manner as· rei-ted,
-,could hav:e the least relation to his being sick, and

..But. what followed was of another kind,
~i This young man -had au elder brother, who lind in ·
London ; he ,was a gentlemap, and a scholar, and was ·
at that time studying physic. He was also a stout man,
an4 in particular understood a sword, that is to s;y, how ·
to use a sword, .as well as. most gentlemen in Eng. -
land• .
He had an ' accidental- rencounter with a gentleman '
in the street, in that short street which gQes out.
of. Fleet·street into · Salisbury-court; and being so
complete a master of his weapon, he wounded his

to grind his teeth, while his face was distorttd, and he
was convuJised ·all over; and that so violently, that it
was as much as four persons could do to bold him.

and quiet countenance. Rut after a short time, the
violent convulsions, and· all otller symptoms returned•

signs for a pen and ink,·and· ~aving wrote, " Take me-
home to die," presently fainted away. He was re.
moved home, but could not compose himself to sleep-
for a fortnight~ which together with the terror that stilt
remained npon his mind, reduced his body to the most
deplorable state ofweakness that can be imagined.
Mr Hanby, (who took the account from his mouth,
on Feb1uary the :zo.)th) aaked him whether he remen;t..

her, for he himself would have nothing more to say

Would be for him to get any access to the dule, hning
acquaint.nce with rio person about him; and if he should
obtain admi$slcin to him, he ne\'er would be able to
persuade h'indh~t he was·sent in such a manner; that
he should at )east be thought to be mad, or to be set
·on and employed by his own, or the malice of otlter
'men to abU'se the duke, and he shbu·ld be sure to be
·un<lone.
The spectre replied, as J;e hd done before, lhat 1te
sltould never find rest till he had performed what he
require~. and therefore he had better to dispatch it; that
'the access to his son was known to be nrv easy, and
thit few men waited-long for him ; and tor the J•inJog
him credit, he would tell him two or three paruculars,
which he -charged him never to mention to any person
but the duke himself; and he should no aoonu hear
them than he ~hould believe· ~II the rest he should·say;
tand so repeating his threats he left him.
Jn the morning the poor man, more confirmed by the
last appearance, made his journey to London where the

l'reeman, one ofthe masters of requests, who laad mar-
ried a lady that was nearly allied to the duke, and was
, himself well received by him. To him this man wr.~~t,
r and though he did not acquaint him with all ~he parti•
culm, he said enough to let him know there was, some~
thing extraordinary in it ; and the knowledge he had of
thesobriety and discredon ofthe man, made the more im.
pressionon him: be desired that by his means be might be
broughtto theduke in such a place, and in sucha manner
u should be thought fit, affirming that he h·ad much to
ny to him, an~ of such a nature as would require much
privacr, and some time and patience in the hearing.
Sir Ralph promised that pe would speak first to the
duke of him, and then he should understand his plea.
aare; and accordingly the first opportunity, he did·
iRform him of the reputation ud honesty ot the man,
apd then what he desired, and what he knew of th•·
matter. f~
The duke, according to his usual openness and con··
d~censiow, told him, that he was the next day early to·
hunt with the king; that his horses should attend him
.at Lambeth Bridge, where he should land by five of
the clock in the morJJing; and if the man attended him
there at that hour, he would walk and speat with him
a1 long as should be necessary. ·
Sir Ralph carried the man with him the next morn.
inl, and presented him to the duke at his landing, who

received him courteously, and walked •side in confer-
ence near an hour; none bLtt his own aer-vants being
at that hour in the place, and they and Sir Ralph at such
. .
a dutance, that they could not bear a word, though the
duke sometimes ~poke loud, and with great emotion.
' ' -
which Sir Ralph the more easily observed and per•
c:eived, because he kept his eyes always fixed upon the
duke, having procur.ed the conference upon somewhat
he knew was very extraordinary.
The man told him in his return over the water, that
when he mentioned those particulars that_ was to g~i11
him credit, (the substance whereof he said he durst not
impart unto him) the duke's ~olour changed, and he
swore that he could com~ at that knowledg~ only by the
devil; for that those particulars were only known to .
himself and to one person more, who be was sure would
never apeak of it.
How strongly does this confirm the opinion, that
th~ soul, when derarted, has a knowledge of the
actions of the living, and willing to do any office for
their good, if permitted.
The duke pursued his purpose of hunting, but was
observed to ride all the morning with great pensive·
ness and in deep thought without any delight in the
exercise he was upon ; and before the morning wu
~pent, left the field, and alighted at his mother's lodp;-
ings in Whitehall, with whom be was shut up for the .

frequently re•ch~g the·ears of those who attended in
the next rooms. And when the duke left her, his
c:ountenance appeared full of trouble, with a mixture
ofanger; a countenance that was never before obaerv•
eJ in biro in any conversation with her, towaJds whom
·he had a profoiuid reverence; and the countess herseJf.
(for though she WliS married to· a printe gentlemai\o

of Buckingkam shortly after· her con had·first assumed
that title) was, at the duke's leaving her; found over-
whelmed in tears, and in the highest agony im;aginilllle.
Wh;atever there was of all this, it is ,a notorious
truth, that when the n~ws of the duke's murder
(wh.ich happened within a few months after) was brought
to his mvther, sh~ sec:.med riot in the least degree sur-
. prised, but receiveJ it as if s~e haJ loa:eseen it; noc
did afterwards express suo.:h a degree o(so.rrow as wa1

to repreaent the im.~ge of any penon to itself, ifthcre ~
wu not. some appeannce, aometbing placed in the
aoul's view, by a aecret but invisible hand, and in an

as if it was placed in open sight when the person waa
really awake. Deacon a11d Walker's DialDgicgl Disgui·
sitions on Spirits, -4to, 16I I.
The ~-cripture confirms this opinion by many ex•
.prettions directly to the purpose, and particularly tbia
of appearing, or· apparition .in dream• .Gen. xx. 3<
"God came to Abim~lech in a dream;" had it been
said, th.at Abimilech dreamed Uiat God came to him,·
there might have been some exception to the parallel ;
but God actuaily came to him ; aod although Abimi·
lech was asleep, and in a dream, it was not the less ail
apparition, for God came to.him, and spoke, and said
to him : aud in the -4th verse, Abimilech spoke to
the apparition. Whatever the shape was, that the text
does not mention but Abimilech knew whombe talked
with too, that'• evident, for the texr inentio11s it fully;

it is plain that there \Vas an apparition, but the man
was asleep ·and in a dream.
Again, in the cue of Laban punuing Jacob, Gen.
sui. '+ " God came to Laban the Syrian ia a dream
by night. and eaid unto him." Here again is an appa•
ritioo, and a speaking apparition too ; God came to·
him, and God apoke to him ; ·and ·Laban owns, not.
tbat he dreamed ofGod'e appearing, but that God really .
spoke.-to him, ver. z9. " The God of your father
apake to me yesternight, aayinc."
. Certainly in those dreams God spoke ·
to thein, and
they answered; and when they were awake, they knew
that it was God that spoke1 and gave heed to the vi•
lion or apparition of God to them.
There are many more instances of the like in the
aac:red history; as first, in Ihe rema-rkable case of King
Solomon, I .Kings iii. ~· " The Lord appeared t_()
Solomon in a dream by night, and God uid, ask what
I shall give thee."
This is called in the sc-ripture, a dream. ver. 1 ).
" And Solomon awokf', and behn!d it was a dre.Hh ;"
and yet it is all cot1'firmf'd ; and the petition that Solo-
mon made, though in-his ~Jeep, or dream, is accepted
and answered as his real act and detd, as if he had been

To bring it down a step lower ; as God has thus

behold tbe angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a-

'to his cabin ; when, as if it had beea somebody that
atood by him and spoke, it came into 'his" ~iod like a
voice, " Heave the·lead, heave the lead.••
Upon this, he turns again to his second mate: Maie,
aays the captain, when did you heave the lead t what
water had you ?-
Ab·•ut an hour agr, says the mate, sixty fathom.
Heaw again, says the captain.
There's no manner of occasion,· Sit, says the mate;
but if you please it shall lte done.
I don't know, says the captain, 'tis needless indeed,
i think, and so was going awa'y again; but was, as it
were, forced to turn back as before, and says to the
mate, I know not what ails me, but 1 cannot be easy;
come, call a hand aft and heave the lead. .
Accordingly a hand was called, and the lead bein'
c:ast or heaved, as they call it, they had ground at
eleven fathoms.
This surprised them all, bu.t·much more when at the
next c:tst, it came up seven fathoms,
Uport this the captain in a fright bade them put the
helm a.Jee, and about ship, all hands beiog ordered to
back the sails, as is usual in such cases,.

the sailors call it) and ·certainly lost their ship, if not
their lives.
Now, wbat could this be ? Not the devil, that we
may vouch for ~im; he would hardly be guilty ofdoing
so much gqod ; hardly an angel sent frou~ heaven
express, that we .dare not presume; but it wa• the
work of a waking providence, by some invi~ble agent
fD1ploy,ed for that occa,;on, who took sleep from the
captain's eyes; as once, in a .ca~.e of infin~tely more
importance, was done to king Ahasuerus. This we

. left him 'I good estate, besides his mother's jointure,

b~ might see the world, .as she said,· without feeling
·the calamities of the war, and without hazatding bia

· expensive; but that now was the time a man might
see the Y'orld at. the expence of the public, aud per•

Hia mother represented to him the danger of hie
}ife, and bade him consider how many gentlemen
went into the army, and of them, how few had lived
to come home again, much leaa to rise to any degree
of preferment.
He made light of that, and told his mother, that if
he happened to be knocked on the bead, there wa1
an end of him, and be was provided for.
Well, son, says the old lady, I am obliged to sub·
mit to it, you are your own master; I can but intteat
you not to go, you have estat~ enough to make you
easy ; therefore have no need to run the risk.
He slighted all her intreaties, and at length mort•
gaged part of his estate to purchase a company in
, the first regiment of guards, and entered into the
a·rmy.
The night before he signed the agreement for the
·c~mpany, being in bed and fast asleep, he saw in a
dream his father come to him in hi~ gown, and with a
.g·re<tt fur cap 011, such as he used to wear ; and calling

He wanted no occasion to show his -

eeveral warm actions· came or· with applause ; so that
be was far fron. being suspected of cowardice : but
ene day, and iA the third year of his service, the army
was drc~wn out in order of battle, the general having
received certain advic.e that the enemy would come
and attack them• - As he stood at the head of his
comj>any, he was suddenly seized with a. cold shiver-
ing fit, and if was so violent that some officers wh-o·
were n~ar him, every one at their post, perceived it.
As it was to no purpose for him to conce1l it, he
turnea to hi~ .lieutenant,. who stood next to him, and
from-whose mouth l received this particular account~­
l cannot imagine, says he, what is the occasion uf tbit·
shaking fit. .
It is yout eagerness·to fall on,. says the lieutenant, I
baye often been sa, and begin to be so now; 1 wish·
the French would come on, that we naiJht have some-
dting to do.
It cominued about a quarter of an hour:. and tbe ene·
my did come on as was expected ; but the fight ~pn
upon the left, at a good dis!ance from them, so tbatthe
whole left wing was engaged before they began.

No, says the_ colonel, it is not over, but it is a little
better.
It will be all over presently, says the lieutenant.
Ay, so it will, says the colonel, I am very easy, I
know what it was now ; and with that he called the
lieutenant to come to him for a moment.
When he came, says he, I know now what ailed me, ·
1 am 'very usy, I have seen my father; I shall be
killed the first volley; let my mother know I told you
this.
In a few minutes .after this, a bocly of the . enemy
ad'l7anced, and the very first vollley the regiment ·re·
ceived, was the fire of five platoons of grenadiers, by
which the co~ptain and several orber officers, bellides
private men, were killed, a11d •he wbo'e brigade was SJOD
after put into confusion; 'though being supported by
1ome regiments of the second line, they rallied again
aoon after; the captain's body was presently recovered;
but he was irrevocably dead, for he received a shot in
his face, which killed hirri immediately.
If all the notices from the invisible world could
have been of any use to him, or he had been to be
'\\orought upon by cautions and advices, which nothing
but a most obstinate temper would have so totally dis.
regarded, the man had been safe. But what can bs

years of Methuselah, Yet what are these years, Jea,
all that have succteded each other froA'I the time that
th~ heavens and the earth were erected, to the time
when the heavens. shall pass away, 'and tbe earth with
the works ofit shall be burned up, if we con.pare it to
the length of that duration, wh!cn never shall have an
end!
In order to illustrate this, a late author bas repeate()
/ that striking. thought of St Cyprian. Suppose there
were a ball vf sand, as large as the globe of earth :
suppose a gra!n of this sand were to be annihilated,
reduced to nothing in a thousand ytars; yet that whole·
space of du1 ati.Jn, whe1ein -,this ball would be aunihi·
lating, at the rate of one grain in a thousaod years,
wou!d bear infinitely less proportion to eternity.
Duration without end, than a single grain of sand
would bear to all the mass.
To infi ·< this important point the more deeply in
your mind, consider ano~her comparison. SupP.ose
the ocean to be so enlarged as to include all the space
between the earth and the starry heavens: Suppose'
a drop of this water to l,>e annihilated once in a thou-
sand years: yet that whole space of duration wherein
this ocean would be annihilatiag, at· the rate of orie
drop in a thousand years, would be infinitely less in pro-
portion to eternity, _than one drop of water to that .

What then is he, bow foolish, how mad, in how n'n·
utterable a degree of.distra.;tion, who teeming to bave
the understanding of ·• man, deliberately prefers tem·

impossible supposition, that wickedness is happiness:
a supposition utterly contrary to all reason, u well as
to matter of fact) prerers the happiness of a year, say a
thousand years, to the happiness of eternity ? In com·
parison of wbict.~ a thousand ages are infinitely lesa
than a year, a day, a moment ? especially when we take
tbis into th,e consideration, (which indeed shoultl ,never
be forgotten) that the refusing of a bappy eternity
implies the chusing ot a miserable eternity. For there
is not, cannot be any medium between everlasting joy
~nd everlasting pain. It is a vain thought, w~ich some .
have eotenained, that de1th will put an . end to the
soul as well as the body. It will put an end to hei •
ther the one nor the othet; it wia only alter the manner
pf their existence. But when the body returns to
the dust as it wu, the s-pirit will return to God that·
gave it. T,hercfore, at the moment of death, it must
be unspeakabl} happy or umpeakwbly miser.&ble. And ·
that misery will qever end.

owed ,1..61. St'erling, I met with a poor lad, a writer,
whom I told, I had paid Thomas Greor's account, but

a month before him. His-eldest d.IUgbter desi~ed me
to look over the papers and give her an account of the

" beginning of sorrows;." a. small dr.op only from that
cup of trembling, which is rmngled for their future
portion. No aooner hu the last pang dislodged their
reluctant souls, but tbey are hurried into the presence of
an injured angry God; not under the conducting care of
beneficent angels, but expo~ed to the .insult& of accursed.
spirit&, whe> lately tempted them, now upbraid them,
and will for ever torment them. Woo can imagine
tbeir confusion and distress, wherr they standi guilty
and inexcusable, .before their incensed Creator~ They
are received with frowns: " The God that made
them bas no mercy on them.'' The prince of pe~ce
rejects them with abhorrence. He consigns them
over to chains of dukness, and receptacles- of despair,.
apinst the severe doQm and more public infamy of the-
great day. Then all the vials of wrath will be emptied
upon tbue wretche:J creatures. The law they have.
violated, and the gospel they have slighted; the ,pJwer
. they have defiled, and the goodness they have abused ;_
will all getthemselves honour in their exemplafy de•
~!ruction. Then. (jod, the God to whom vengeance
b.elongeth, will draw the aJ~ow to th~ very head, and.
set them aa the m.ar~ of bis inex.Prl\ble. _disp!~asur.e. .

JN the begimiing of the year r66) a disease happ~n·

the same evening, one expression I then used out of
Virgil.
The rea$on why this grave gentleman was so con-
cerned at the character_, was. a reft~(:tion made up on a
son of his own, who being about the same age, and
but a few months before not unworthy of the like cha·
ncter I gave ofthe young 0 Mr. Elliott, was now by a
strange accident quite lost to his parent$• hopes, and all
expectations of·any further comfort by him. 0
The funeral rights being over, J 'Yas no sooner
come out of the church, but l foan~ myself most cour-
teously accosted by this old gentleman ; and with an
u11usual importunity, almost forced1.against RIY humour
to his house t~at night; nor could 1 have rescued my.
self from his kindness, had not Mr Elliott iuterposed,
and pleaded title to me for the whole day, ~hich {as he
said) he would resign to no man. IUreupon I got
loose for that time, but was conetnined to leave ApTo•
mise behind me to wait upon him athis own bouse the
Monday following. This then seemed to satisfy, but
before Monday came I had a new meesage to re-
~uest me that if it _were: possibl~ I would be there tha
Sunday. The second atterupt I resisted, by 0 ~nswu-
jng
.
iog that it was against my convenience, and the ·dllty
which mine own people expected from me. Yet was
not the gentleman at rest, for he sent me another letter
the Saturday by no means to fail the Monday, and so
to order rny business as to sp~nd with him two or three
days at least. I was indeed startled at ~o 'much eager_-
n·ess, and so many dunnings for a visit, without any
busines~; and began to suspect that there ' must needs
be some de$ign at the bottom ofall this excess of cour·
tesy. For I had no familiarity sc:trce common acquain-
tance with the gentleman, 01 his family; nor could 1
imagine whence should arise such a flush of friettdship
on the sudden,
On the Monday I '~ent and paid my promised de·
voir, and met with entertainment as free and plentiful,
as the invitation was free and importunate. There al·
so· I found a neighbouring miuister, who pretended to.
call in accidentaMy; · but · by t~ sequel J suppose
it otherwise. After dinner this brother of the coat
undertook to show me the gardens, where, as we we
walking, he gave me the first discovery of what was
mainly intended in all this treat and compliment.
First he began to inform me of the infelicity of the
family in general, and then gave instanc~ in the young·
est son. He related what a hopeful ~prightly fad he
lately wat, and bow melancholy and. sottish he was
now grown. .·Then did he with much pa~Sioh lament,
that
o,,, ,.,,,Coogle
.that hit ill humour should so lucrec1ibly subdue hi•
.reason ; ( saith he) " The poor boy believes himself
to be haunted with ghosts, and is confident that b.-
.:neets with an evil spirit in a certain field about half~
mi"Iefrom this place, as often as he goes that way !Q
•chool." In the mi!lst of O!Jr. discourse, the old &ell-
tlemaR and his lady (as 11,bserving their cue mo.tt ell;•
actly) came up to us. Upon their approach, and point•
ing me to the arbour, the parson r-=newed the relatio11
to, and they (the parents of the. youth) confirmed what
~e said, and added many minute circumstances, in a
long narrative.· of the whole: ~n fine, they aU three
. desired my tfi(IUghts and advice in the affair•
.I was not able to collect my thoughts ,enough on
the sudden, to frame a judgment upon what they hat\
s:~hl. , Ooly I answered, that the thing lAihich the
yquth reported to them, was strange1 yet not incredi•
ble, and tha,t 1 knew not then what to thiuk or say o·(
it; but if ihe. lad.would. b.e fre.e to me in talk, and
trus.t me with his counsels, I had hopes to give them
a better account of my opinion the next day.
' I had no sooner spoken so much, but I perceiv~
myself in the 1pringe their courtesy bad laid for me i
for the old la?y was not able to bide her impatience
but her son must be called immedjately. This 1 Wll
forced to comply with, and ~on&ent to; so that, drawiJlg

It was •h• maio drift of aU these three to persuade
me, that either the boy was lazy, and glad of any ex-
cuse to keep from the school, or that he was in love
with some weneh, a-nd uhaiRed to confess it ; or that he
bacta-fetch upon his father to get money and new clothes,
. that he might range to London after a brother he haJ
there ; an& therefore they be"ed of me, to d.iacover
the ro~ of th& matter ; and accordiagly to dissuade•
ad¥ise, 01' repreve him; but cbieliy by all means to
IHlclec:five him, aa to the fancy of ghosts ani spirit..
I [lloon entued a close conference witb the youtt.'
and at first wu very-cautious not to displease bim but
by smootIt words to ingratiate myself and get withim
him ; for I doubted he would be too distrustful cr too
reserved. But we had scuce past the first situation allcl
began to speak to the business, before I found, that
there needed no policy to skrew myselfinto his h~art;
forhe most openly and with all obliging candollr did
aver, that he loved his book, and· desired nothing
more than to be bred.a scholar ; that he had not the
least respect for any of womankind as his mother gave
out; and that the only request that he would make to
his parents was, that they would but believe his con•
. stant assertions, concerning the woman he was disturb~

He told me with all naked freedom and a flood or

neither to believe nor pity hi~ ; and thar if any man

This woman which appears to me, said he, lived a

a stature, suclt age; and such complexion. She ·ne>er

had a word in answer. Then I changed my way and

went to school the under horse ro~d, and th~::n she al-

park and the nursery, which wa~·worse.
At length I began to be afraid of it, and prayed con-
tinually, that God would either free me from it, or Jet
me know the meaning of it. Night ai1d day, s!eeping
and waking, the shape was ever running in my mind;
and I often did repeat these places in scripture (witb.
that he took a small Bible out of hia pocket). Job·.

theywere silenced, I cannot say satisfied.
The next m.ornin,,.before five o•c:loc:k, the lad was
in my -hamber, aftd very briak; I arose and went
with him. T he field he led me to I guessed to be
twenty acres, in an open country, and about three
furlongs from any house. We went into the field, and
had not gone altovll a thi.rd part, before the spectrum

be had described her to me in the orchard the day be·

I had taken up a firm resolution ~o speall: to it, yet I
·had not the power, nor Indeed durst I look ba.c;k, yet
I took <;a~;_e not to shew my fear to my pupil and guide,
and therefor~ telling him that I was satisfied in thf
truth of his complaint, we walked to the end of the
field, and returned, nor did the ghost meet us at that
time above once.· I perceived in the young man a kind
of bol~ness mixed with astonishment ; the first caused
by ·my prese!)ce, and the proof he had given of his own
relation, ~nd the other by the sight of hi,s prosecutor·
In short we went bQme ~ I somewhat puzzled, h~
much animated. At our return the gentlewoman
whose

(whose inquisitiveness had missed us) watched to speak
with me; I gave her a convenience, and told her
that my opinion was, that her son's complai~t waa not
to be slighted, nor . altogether discredited, yet that
my judgment in his case was not ~ettled. I gave her
caution ·moreQver, that the thing might not take wind,
Jest the whole country should ring, with what we yet
had no assurance of. ·
In this juncture of time I had business which W<'uid
ad•l.it ofno delay ; wherefore I went to Launceston
that evening, but promise~ to. see .them again next
week. Yet l was prevented by an occasion which
pleaded a sufficient excuse ; for my wife was that week

took the·other walk, and then the spectrnm appeared to
me much about the same place I saw it before when the

moved swifter than the time before, and about ten foot

THE words, as literally translated .- the Englia&

the spirit and the soul, and the body .be preserved
blamele11. .
What doea St, Paul here mean, by dividing.mao in·
to three par,ts, the spirit, and the soul, and the body ~
· This crea~es what bas been thought an unsurmount~
able difficulty, by-those who argue thus:
. ~~ . How is it possible to contradistinguish •the soul.
both from th~ spiritand from . the body ~, f~r it must
be either material or immaterial,. ll'l~tler or not matter:
there is no medium. But if it be matter, does it not
c:oiacide with th•body ? If it be :R~t matt~r, doea it
not cioim:ide with the spirit ?
But perhaps a way may b~ found of untying thia
knot, of unravelling this difficul~y, by simply declarin'
the (lt least probable) meaning ofthese three terms.
• ~ay
( 153 )
May not the spirit mean (so it bas been understood
by tbe christians in aU ages) the highes1 principle in
man, the immortal Spirit made in the image of God,
endue~ (as all. Spirits are, so far as we can conceive)
with self-motip11, understanding, wlli, and liberty?
ls not. the body, that portion of organized matter,
whicti every man receives in the womb, with which be
js born into the world, and which he carries· with him
to the grave ? At present it is connected with flesh
and blood. But these are not the body. They are
only the temporary clothing of the body, which it
wholly puts off in the grave.
The s_oul seems to be the ii_Timediate clothing of the
spirit, the vehicle \\ith which it is connected from its
first existence, and which is never separated from it,
either in life or in death. Probably it consists of ethe-
real or electric fire, the purest of all matter, It does not
· seem to be affected by tru; death of the body, but en-
velops the sepQrate, as it does- the embodied spirit:
neither will it undergo any essential change, when it is
clothed upon with the immortal body at the resurrec·
rection.
May not the apostle have an eye to this, in those
~emarkable ~ords (z Cor. v. +·) We tha.t are in this
tabernacle (this corruptible flesh and blood) do groan, -
being burdened: not (or that we would be unclothed
(divested of all all covering, which belongs only to
y · the

resurrection-body. coveting ~otb our toul and spirir.
This will swallow up. totally deatroy that which waa
mortal. namely. the flesh and blood, which alone wa~
liable to death.
If we understood the words of tJte apostle in this
aense. all the difficulty vanishes away. We allow there
can be no medium between mat~rial and im~aterial;
:But still there is room for a wide and essential diirer.
ence between the soul and the body: the latter implying
thatoriginal portion ofmatter, which is clothed with ftesh
and blood; the former, that nhicte ofethereal fire, -which
immediately covers the immortal spirit.

on a Sunday evening. The Major had spen't the
evening with some gay company, and had made an

unhappy appointment "'itb a married woman, whom
he was to meet exactly at twelve o'clock. The COlli·
pany bro"e up about eleven; and not judging it c~n~
venient to anticipate the time appointed, he went in-
to his chamber, to kill, as he said, the tedious hour
with some book, or other amutement ; but it very
providentially happened that he took up a religious
book, which either his mother, or bis aunt, had slipt
into his portmanteau, The book was entitled " Tl:e

ten lty Mr Watson ; and guessing by the title of H,
be should find some phrases of his own profession
epirltualized in such a manner, as might afford him
some diversion (as he said), he resolved to dip into it
for a few minutes,·but yet be took no particular notice
of any thing be read in it. But on a sudden, ·w.Pile
the book was open in his hand (as he related to me
several times), there 11L'as presented to his sight, in a
a very lively manner, not to his imagination only, but
to his bodily eyes, the Lori Jesua Christ upon the
cross, sursounded with a refulgent light and glory,
and that a voice, or something equivalent to a voice,
was impressed.upon him, in words to this effect, '' 011
sinner! did I sufl'er all this for thee ? and are these the
returns?.. But whether this was an audible voice, or
a strong impression upon his senses, he did not pre-
aume to affirm, but looked upon it as a vision ofail ex-
traordinary nature, as from God; and struck with so
amazing a phenomenon (said be), " there remained
hardly any life in me ; I sunk down into an arm chair
on which I sat, and continued (1 knew not how long)
quile insensible," whether in a sleep or not, he could
n()t say ; but after a while he opened his eyes, and saw
11othing more than usual; nor did he (as he declared
to me) during the remainder of the night, once recol-
lect that criminal and detestable assignation, which had
before engrossed all his thoughts. He then rose from

and walked to and fro in his chamber till tie was
ready to ,drop. down in unutterable astonishment ·and
agony of soul; now appearing to himself as the
vilest m..onster in the creation of God, who had all
his life~time been crucifying the Lord Christ by his
sins, and disobedience to his precepts. And now law
(as he assuredly believed, by so wonderful a vision)
all the horrors ofwhat he had done and acted; and yet,
at the same time, Wsaw (as he said) both the majesty
·and Koodness ol God in spa1ing such a rebel, and the
chief of sinners 1 that he ever had abhorred himself, as I
deserving nothing at·God's hand, but wrath and eternal I
damnation. And that, from this moment, he became .I
the greatest penitent before God aud man; abhorrina I
.himself as in dust and ashes; and so continued to 'the
day of his death ; a~ril>uted all to the free unmerited I
grace of Christ, to one of the vilest of sinners; and
never mentioned the name of God, or of _Christ, but
wit!'~ ' the greatest reverence; and yet the Lord so lift-
ed up the li«ht of his countenance upon him, at different
Hmes, and strengthened his faith in him, that he ne_ver
~fter doubted of his salvation, through the above merits
ofhis Redeemer. He had also a foresight of his dea:b
in a dream, as he related ·hin.self, " I thought (says
.be), I saw my Saviour walking hefore me over.a large
field (the very field of battle where he fell), and the
Lord

ver.after doubted of his aid and protection, nor of my
interest in his precious ltlood," . He died of his woun4s

Though this, and the following. relation are nQt of
the·most striking order ofappllrition stories, they, not•

1764; and hersw~tbea~t was ~be .son of M1 Haine, a
very reputable butcher and grazier, at Scar, about
t"'e.nty miles from Plymouth. The match was not ap-
-aWroved of by the y4l,ung womao'-8 friends; and dur.
ing her illness they would not suffer the young man
to come to eee her, though she greatly desired to see
/him. About the time ofher illness, he also was taken
-sick of a fever, and confined to his room ; so that it
was above· a month after her death, before she made
~r ~st appearance t.o him; 'which is 'as follows :

After I bad recovered from my illness, says he, I
went out one afternoon on my father's horse for a lit•
tie airin~; and, returning home jus~ at duslr, altout a
mile from ·my fat~e"r's house, I saw something,. as on
horseback, pasa ver ttvriftly by me ; which so .affrighted
my horst', that he flew home with me as fast as possi·
blet and I was also much afrrigh ted-. A short time
after this she appeared again to me, and tbeJI·:J
. I
knew her; and what is very remarkable when I
was on horseback, sh~ appeared to. me on bon~.:
back ; llll:l when I was on foot she appeared so too;
and her appearances to me were so frequent, that she
became quite familiar, and I bad no fear at all on ·see•
ing her; which she never failed to do"'if I was abroad!;
hut she never appeared t~ me in my father's house.
· It was above a month before I had any power given
me to speak' to her, although I thought to ·do ~t from
time to time, but could not speak; though she gave me
all the opportunity sie could• by walking often by my
side, or very near me. This was a gr,eat trouble to me-~
as well as to her ; and it bega n to bring a great weak•
ness upon me. .
l related the thing to my father and mother,· and
s:1me others; but they not believing my relation, ga\'e
little heed to what I saicJ, and thought it was only
p~renzy; till the follo·\~·ing circt;mstance happene(i
which was about a week, before God gave me power to
speak·to her•.
( a68 )
My,father and ·mother used to go to a place of wor•
ahip_ belel\ging to Mr Wesley, about a mile off; and
one evening about this time, I went ~ith them to light
~hein home, as I often did, with ·a large lanthern and
ca_ndle, and comiag home along the big'b f1)ad, abe &p•
pared to me as usual ; l s~ to my father, No\111, don't
yoa see her ? there, tbere she is!. tnd at the wry mo·
meat ·I spok-e, lhe lantbern was twisted violently out e>f
my baftd, and fluns to a considerable distance from me,
the 1ing of it -re~aimng in my hand, my father and ~o·
ther were now both somewhat affrighted at tbi•, and
began to believe what I had so often related to them of
the apparition, that there was-some truth in it, A do_!:·
tor who attended me in my illness, to whom r had also
related the story, urged me by all means to speak to
her, telling me what words to use; and said, it might
be of bad c'msequence to neglectEd it longer.
A few nights after this, as l was sitting in my fa•
ther's house, it was strongly impressed upon my mind
to go out that night, and with God's leave to speak to
her. Accordingly, al,lout ten o'clock, I wer~t out with
aU the courage imaginable, and she appeared to me as
usual; and I said to her, in the name of the Lord. Jesus,
why do·you thus trouble me ? and I was goin.: to lay
hold on her arm. She shunk back, and said, do not
touch me, I am as cold as clay ; she 6poke out and
blamed me for not speaking .to her sooner ; and said,
that
oio .edb,Google
that this was the very last night of her liberty to appear
to me; and had you 'not spoken to me now, said she,
1 should have had power to do you some mischief.
Then she related to me what she had to say about her
family, who had cruelly hindered her from seeing some
of her a'ear relations. After telling me but her whole
mind, she gave me plain directions concerning herself.
We conversed together near 'two hours, ,till twelve
o'clock ; and I promised, if possible, to fulfil all het
instructions.
Accordingly, I set out early next morning, rode-
near fifty miles, to different parts, fulfi!led all her com•
mailds, and got back safe to my father's house. She
appointed me to meet her that night, if I bad done my
business before twelve, at the church door when! she
was buri~d; this was about two miles from my father's'
house, · She met me at the church porch, expressed her
entire approbation of all that I had done, saying she

After i short discourse, which 'she charged r~>e never
tc divulge, she said, My time is nearly expired, follow
me into the church. The door opening~ she entered
the church, which was illuminated with the most glori-
ous light. and my hearing the most soft and hea¥enly
music betokened her happiriess. She bid me take no..
tice when the music began to 'cease, to go th:en out of
the church ; which I did;' and being very glad that aH

Aj>p,zrition of Mr Tbomkins to tbe Rev. Mr Warren.
Mn JOHN WARREN, minister of Hatfield·
Broad-Oak, in Essex, a worthy and 1~ious man, being
one day in his garden rea~ing Bunyan's.Publican ·apd
Pharisee, was accost~d by.a neighbour, as he thought,
who entered into discourse with him upon the words
11 Shall man -be more righteous than his Maker!" Mr
\Varren's discourse in general ran upon the pr~mises,
\\ hi!e Mr Thompkins, his neighbour, as he imagined .
he was disc?ursing with, chiefly urged the threaten-
ings of God. For a {while they discoursed in this
sort, till Mr Warren's servant came .and informed
him the dinner was ready, and mistress waited for bint :
common civility made· him ask his neighbour Thomp•
kins to come in with him and eat some dinner, which
the latter, with tears' now standing in his eyes, refused,
sJying, " 1\fy time is come, and I must away." l\.1r
,Warren thought it very odd, ~nd was ,proceeding to ex.

postulate with his friend Thompkins, when the servant
repeated the message, urging that a neighbour had seot
for hi111-to go immediately upon occasion of life and
death. ~:ir Wa~ren withdrawing towards t~e house,
still held up the discourse :upon the former subject,
corpforting his friend till he arrived at the door, when
entering first, be left the door open that Mr Thomp•
kios might come in, but nobody coming in, he went
directly and sought him all over his garden, but fOuna
him not, which much disturued his mind ,'then, and
much m~re soon afterwards, when he found that his·- ·
neigbbour'and friimd'Thompkirts was just espired, and
had not'been c:iut of his house, according to.every tes•
timony, that day. Mr Warren's servant testified s~eing
her Ii'a$ter in conversation with a person, in the garden,
and telling her mistress so, she wondered she had seen
12ohod;y·-go through the bouse, as there was no .other
way into the -garden. Mr Warren, a pious and sensi.
ble divine, often relates this to Mr Goodman, who re•
cites it in his Winter-evening ·Conferences between

The app(pi/io, of Samuel, Sam. cbap. zS•
.THE Philistines, recruited about this ,time, as Sir
Isaac Newton judges, by vast numbers of men driven
out of Egypt by Am~sia, ..resolv~ppon a ne\)V war with
Israel. Nor were Samuel's death an~l David's disgnce
(as we may well judge) inconsiderable motives to
it.
Now, forasmuch as the event of this war turned upon
a remarkable piece of misconduct in Saul, as a captaia ;..
and a grievous and deliberate violation of his known
duty to God, as his Creator and his King ; the sacred
historian here interrupts the course of his -relation,-to.
acquai11t us with that event; and, in order to it, aeo
quaints us with the situation of both an11ies. At that
time Saul encamped upon Mount Gilboa; and the
Philistines, in full prospect under him, upon the plains
of Sunem. '
When Sa~l saw their numbers, their orders, a~d their
appointments, he judged himself greatly overpowe.red,
and

own. appointment. At least, Saul had no .reasou to
hope, that God wotdd sbi.bU bimselfin an ~traordi­
nary manneT in bia favour. Samuel was dead, and Gad
was with David ; and we bear of :rio ot~ ·on whom
the Spjrit of God rested in those days; Howe~, he
~pplied himself to eome of the prophetic cone,ca, pro-
Qibly to S()tne of the most elftinent of those sons~ -the"

to answer him, either by Urim, by.pro-

of great ennts. In great dangers IJ!en are desirous;
even to koo~ the worst : it is some consolation to be
prepared for it. He had long since .re~ounced every
thing that was serious in religion. However, he had
been threatened as from God ; and, in all probability,
lhe time was now come, when the sentence,: so long
since pronounced upen him, was to be exe~uted :

diately Samuel asked him why he had disquieted him, to
bring him up~ (Will not this gro1,1nd a presumpd.un,
that the pythoaess bad not disturbed him by her in,-
cantatiom? for if she had, the question bad been more
naturally directed to her) To which Saul answered,
Tb.it he was sole distressed; for the Philistines warre1l
against him ; and God had forsak,en !Jim, and woul1~
neither answer him· by dr~-am~, nor pr.opbets: Thett~­
fore (says he) I have called unto thee ·t• th~tthou
m;tyest make known unto me wllat I sh<~H do.
Then said Samu~l, Wherefore tl:sn do$t thou aik o.f
me; eeeiag the Lord is depaJ,ted from tr~e, and is .l)e~
come tb~ne enemy t Aoiil the Lor~ hath done for bi,m·
ae'f, as he •pake by me; for the .Lord h.oth .rent. the
kingdom out of ahine hand. and gi~·~n it to thy neigh'..

voice of the Lord, nor exeGuted~t his fie1ce wratll upon
AmaleK;
t Th•original word &i&nifics knowing, aod sometimes see.

t Saul expresses himself here in the siime terms ·that
David makes use of to signify hts pr.1.yirtg to Uud. Whic'-
persuades me, that Saul invoked hiJD, as iOinc del11dcdchrb·
tians do saints and angels.
Aa
.Amalek: Therefore hath the Lord done· tbis thing un·
·to thee this day.
In this we see the prophet foretell's, -that Saul should
that day be stript of the kingdom ; and that the king·
.dom should be divided-1 and given to David. Then
follows, what nothing but infinite and unerring pre·
science could predict ; ail exact, _minute, precise account
of all the circumstances <5f the then depending nent:
'Moreover, the l.ord will also deliver Israel, with thee, '
·unto the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and
thy sons be with me; and also the camp of Israel shall
lbe Lord deliver into the bands of the Philistines.
I own, I am aStonished a.t the inattention (~ball I call
:it?) or impiety, or botb, of those critics and commen• ,
tators, who could ascribe this prediction to the sagacity ,1
of an impostor, or.even of th~ devil. I shall take a -,
:proper time tO refute fhem; and, in ·the meanthale, go I
-on with my history.
When Saul heard this dreadful sentence, pronounced
upon himself, his faraily, and his peo_ple, the terror of it
struck 'him to the heart; and he hasted to get away
hom that fatal place: but as he went, his feara operat•
-ing upon a mind weakened with guilt, and upon a body
exhausted with fatigue and fasting, be lost all power of
motion, and fell at his full length upon fhe 'floor. Tbe

nance : which he absolutely refused. fhen, calling
his-ser\tants to her aid, they all, in a manner compelled
him to consent: So he arose from the earth and sat up..
on the bed,· And the woman had a fat calf in the house,
and she hasted and killed it; and took flour ar1d knead:.
fd it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof; and she
brought it before Saul and before his serv.mts, and they·
did eat. Then they rose up and went away that
night.

These suppositions are too wild to be seriously con-
futed; they are the ver' reverse of what should and
would have been done upon such an occasion, had im.
posture intefered in it: Every one knows, the busineu
of impostors is to ftatter, to delude, to deceive, to an•
awer doubtfully; to · promise good, and pat off the
evil : it was thi•woman's business in a partii:ular mm-
ner to aet tftus. · Had she promisei Saul victory, and
tfle success had answered, she was sure of consideraWe
advantage, He who could have no benefit from
priests, or from prophets, would, doubtless, have bact

yet not save her. For, might notSaul's companions, Of.'

hazard of a conjecture 1 And God wou)d make the
event exactly aad minutely conform;able to that ~on•
jectur~, to estab;ish tbe creoit of impostur~ over the
face of the ear1h, and to the end of the world.
But an evil s;.1irir, or even au impostor, mi&bt know'
that Saul and his sons were deter~1ined either to die, or
conquer in the baule.
Let this also be allowed, without any foundation in
the text: Hath not many a man been. ·determi~d to
die, and ~et been prevented l ~ut tiJe truth is other-
wise: Neither Saul nor .his aons were determined to
uie; they all·fled from the enemy as fast an<l as tar as
&hey could. The .enemy first overtook tbe ..sons of
Saul, and slew them: And4 when S;aul could fly. no

absurdities. I cannot assent to tbem; I envy no mao
that can.
The consequence from all this i1 clear: If that per•
·eon, who now denounced the divine vengeance upon
Saul, under the semblance of Samuel, was neither an
impostor, nor an evil spirit; he must be what the
&criptures constantly call him throughout thi• narratiol'l,
Samuel.
That spirits of another world may carry about them
such vehicles, as may admit them to a sensible com·
me.ce with us, in like manner as \>ttr lj ifits bear about ,
lhese bodies of ours, tbe best philosopby will admit.
AnJ that they have done so upon extraordinary occa.
aions, the most authentic histories in the world will
attest. If tll•n God Almighty thought .fit either to
·appoint, or permit Samuel to·appear to S.ilul on this oc·
.c:asion ; I see ·no more difficulty in it, .than in bis ap.
pearing ·to him on any other occasion .whilst he was
in this wortd, and in full health and atreagth. .·For
'Saul ·no more saw- his·spirit then, dum he dicl new;
ind his. spirit ·was as well !Klle to bear a body-altout
·with it now,·as it was theri.
The only question then is, Why God ·sltould ap·
point, or permit, Samuel to appear on this. occaiion ?
And this is a question which nO man living bath :a ~gbt

communicated himself either by vision, or by his

the Jewish church upon this head.
The next is; that whereas it'hath been made a que•"
lion, whether the Jews had any beliefof the immortality
of the soul ; this history is a full decision upon that
point: And, perhaps, the establishment of that trutll
upon the foot of sensible evidence, was not the lowest

a reprobate liver, a common swearer, and sabbath•

At the time he felt himself dying away, as we have
meRtioned above, he seemed to go into fields inexpres·

the same time a glorious prospect of heaveu before
him, to whK:h he directed hi~ steps, not once thinking

A dying Prostitute.
·A YOUNG ~an, scarceTy nineteen, and at that time
ari apprentice to an eminent merchant in the city, had
for some months unhappily indulged himself iu every

exhorted to repent, or they_
would aasuredly follow_her

Almighty to indulge him in his request, One night,
just as J. M. was got into bed, he hurd a voice from
without, calling him diathx:tly bnhis name, J. M. J. M·
J. M. three times. Judging it was some one who

window; and, after walking two or three times across

be heard a very loud knocking at his door, as if with a
stick ·or cane, and presently the spirit ·of his deceased

ing with ~is arm on a chest of drawers. He had on .
(to appearance) the very clothes which he wore when _
be met his untimely fate ;1with his.hat inclining on one
side of his heR, the way he usually wore it. The
room was immediately filled with a gloomy kind of
light. J. M. viewed him very distinctly; but he seem-

Immediately those two fiends flew forward, with tbe
_
greatest rage and fury, to seize on J. M.; but he cried ·
out, I plead the blood of Christ, I plead the blood of
Christ, I plead the blood of Christ, three times: and
they shrunk back again to their place. On this, E. B.
said, Aye, plead but the blood of Christ, and all the
devils in bell can never harm you.
J. M. I fear you are not happy.
E. B. Lost for ever ! Lost for ever ! Lost for ever !

I. 1. And first, let us con11ider the P;ena damnf, the
punishment or loss. This coltllllence~ in that v~'Y mo•
ment wherein the soul is separ,atedlfrom the body: itt
that instant the soul loses all those pleasures, the enjoy•
ment of which depends on the outward senses-. The
smell, the taste, the touch delight no more : the organt
that ministered to them are spoiled, and the objects
· that used to gratify them are far away. In the dre:uy
regions of the dead, all those things are forgotten: or,
if remembered, are ·only remember~d with pain, seeing
they are gone for ever. All the pleasures.of the ima-
gination are at an end. There is no grandeur in the
infernal region ; there is nothing beaatiful in these
dark abodes; no light, but that of livid flames. And
nothing new, but one unwearied scene of horror upon
horror. There i~ nd music b.ut that ofgroans an;:l shrieks,
of weeping, wailing, and gnashing ·of teeth;· of curses
and blasphemies against God, or CL!tting reproaches of
one another. Nor is there any thing to gratify the
sense of honour : no ; they are the heirs of shame a·ad
everlasting _
contempt.
2, Thus are they totally separated froin all the
things they were fond of in the pEesent world. · At
the same instant will commence anather loss ; that of
all the persons whom they lond. They are torn away
from their nearest and dearest relations, their wives,
husbands, ·parents, children, and {what to some will be

worse tb<&n all this) the friend which was as their own
soul. All the pleasures they ever efljoved in these is
lost, gone, vanished away. For there is no friendshiP
in hell. Even the poet who affirms (though 1 know
not on what authority)
" Devil with devil damned
Firm concord holds ~"
Does not affirm that there is :any concord amQng the
human fiends, that inhab-it the great abyss.
3• But they will then be sensible of a greater loss,
than all they have enj<1yed on earth. They have lost
their place· in Abraham's bosom, in the paradise or
God. liitherto indee(•, indeed i(hath llot entered in-
to their hearts to conceive, what holy souls enjoy iu
the garden of God, in the society of angels, and of the
wbest and bt'st men, that have iivt:d !rom the begin-
ning of the world: (not to mcminn the irnmense in-
crease of knowledge, whi~;h they \~iii then un't' ubiedly
1eceive.) But they will It:en fully u ndt!rstand the
value of what they have vilely c~st aw.,y.

unhappy spirits, will be tbe completion of their misery.
They will then know and feel, that God alone is the
centre of all created spirits; and consequently that a
spirit made .for God, can have ne rest· out of him. k
'seems that the apostle had this In his yiew, wheo he
spoke of those, who ~hall be punished with everlasting
destruction f1om the presence of the Lord. Baoiall•
ment from the presence of the Lord, is ·the Yery easenGe
of destruction to a spirit that was made for God. And
if thatjbanishment lasts for eorer, it is everlalting deetru.r~

ed, chiefly among the lith and great, of burning the
bodies of the relations, and frequently iq ~ grand mag-
nificent manner. Fur which purpose they erected
huge funeral piles, with immense labour and expenfe·
By ~ther of these mdbods the body of man was soon
.ustored to its parent dust. Eilher the worm or the
· ~fire soon consumed the well wrought frame; after
which the WOI"Jil itself quickly died, and the fire was
entirely q&Jenched. But there is likewise a worm that
belongs to the future state ; and that is a worm that
J1evu dieth. And there is a fire, hotter than that of
the funeral pile ; and it is a fire that will never be
quenched.
z, The first thing Sntencled by the worm that Rever
dietb, seems to be a gqilty conacie~ce, including self•
condemnation, sorrow, ahame, remorae, and a sense of
the wrath of God. May not we have aome concep-
t.ion of this, by what. is sometimes felt in the present
evil world? Is it not of this chiefly· that Solomon
speafcs, when he .say1, •• The spirit of a man may bear
his infirmities," his infirmities or griefs of any other
lind: but a wounded spirit who can bear ? Who can
bear the anguish of an awakened c~nscienee, penet~t­
cd·with a sense of guilt, and the arrows of the Almighty
Btickiog in the soul and drinking up the spirit! How
many
o,, .idb,Google
many of the stout-hearted have sunk under it, and
chose str.mgling rather rhan life? And yet what are
these wounds, what is all this anguish ora soul while
in this present wor~d, in colllparison of those they
must suffer when their souls are wholly a\\akened, to
feel the wrath of an offended God I Add to tbese, all
unholy passions, fear, horror,-rage, evil desires; desires
that can never be satisfied. Add all unholy tempers,
envy, jealousy, malice, and revenge: all of which will
incessantly itnaw the .soul, as the vulture was supposed
to do the liver of Tityus. To these if we add hatred
of God and all his creatures, all these united together ·
serve to give usaome little, imperfect idea of the worm
that never dieth.
3· We_may obsl'rve a remarkable difference in the
manner wherein our Lord ~peaks concerning the two
parts of the future punishment. He says, \\'here their
worm dieth not, ot one; where the fire is not quem:h·
ed, of the other. This cannot be by chance. What
tken is the reason for this variation of the expression~
Does it seem ro be this ? The fire will be the same
- '
to all that are tormented therein ; only perhaps more
jnten_;e t.o some than others, according to their degree
of il!ilt. But their worm will not, cannot be the same,
It will be infinitely varied, according to their various
kinds, as well as degrees of wickedness. This variety
will arise partly from thJtJustjudgment of God, reward~
ing
o;0 .odb,Google
ing every one according to his works. For we cannot
doubt but this rule will .take place, II<' less m bell than
in heaven. As in heaven every man shall receiv~ hie
own reward, incommunicably his, that it, the whole
tenor of his tempers, thoughts, words, and actiQ»J : Je
. /
undoubtedly every man in tact will receive his own bacl ,
r•waut, according to his own bad labour. And thi1
likewiee will be incommunicably his own, even as his
labour was. Variety of punishment w.illlikewise ari&e
ftom the ve.ry nature of the thing. As they that bfiog
most holinese to heaven, will fiad most happiness there,
set on the other hand it is not only true, that the more
wickedness aman brings to hell, the more mieety he
will find there ; but that this misery will be infinitely
varied a~~ording to the varjous kinds of his wickedness.
It was therefore proper to say the fire, in general; but
their worm in particular.
+· But it has beew questioned by some, ." Whether
there: be any fue in hell ? That is, any m.terial fire:•

And
o,,, ,.,,,Coogle
And con$h!er this: does not our Lord speak as if it
were real fir·e? No one can deny, or doubt of this. Is
it possible then to suppose, that the God of trutlf would_
Speak in this manner, if it were not so ? Does he de·
sign to fright his poor creatures? What, with scare-
crows? With vain shadows of things that have no be·
ing? 0 let not any one think sa! Impute not such
folly to the Most High!
S· But others aver, " It is not possible- that fire
should burn always. For by the immutable law or
nature, It consumes whatever is thrown into it. And
by the same Jaw, as soon as it has cons.rmed its fuel,
it is itself consumed; it goes out."
It is most tru~, that in the present constitution of
things, during the present Jaws of nature, the e!ement
of fire does dissolve and consume whatever is thrown
into it. But here is the mistake : the present laws Of
nature are not immutable. When the heavens and the
earth shall flee away, the present scene will be totally
changed: and with the present constitution of things,
the present laws of nature will cease. After tllis great
change, nothing will be dissolved, nothini will be con-
sumed any more. Therefore if it were true, that fire
consumes all things now, it would not follow that it
would do the same after the whole frame of nature has
undergone that vast, universal change.

6. I say, " If it were true, that fire consum~s .1!1
things now." But indee.d it is not true. Has it not
pleased God, to give us already some proof of what
will be hereafter? Js not the Li11um Asb~stum, the in-
combustible flax, known in most parts of Europe ? If
you take-a towel or handkerchief made of this (one of
which may now be seen in the British Museum,) you
may throw it into the hottest fire, and when it ii taken '
out again it IVill be ob$erved, upon the nicest experi-
ment, not to have lost one grain of iis.weight. Here
therefore is a substance before our eyes, which even in
the present constitution of things, (as if it were an em-
"blem of things to come) may remain in fire wltbout
being consumed.
lll. It remains now only to consider two or three
-circumstances attending the never-dying worm and tbe.
unquenchable fire.
1. And first consider the company wherewith every
one is surrounded in that place of torment. They are
restrained by none from exerting to the uttermost their
total wickedness, Not by men: none will be restrain-
ed from evil by his companions in damnation•. And not
by God ; for he hath forgptten them,_ hath delivered
them over to the tormentors. And the devils need not
fear, like their in6truments upon earth, lest they should
.expire under tke torture, They can die no more: they
• are
o''"''"'b,Google
a!'e strong to sustain, whatever t~e united m~lice, skill.
and strength of angels em inflict upon them. And
their angelic tormentPrs have time sufficient to vary
t!teir torments a thousand ways. How infinitely may
they vary one single torment. Horrible appearances?
Whereby, there is no doubt, an evil spilit, if permitted,
could terrify the stoutest man upon earth to death.
:. Consider, Secondly, that all these torments of body
aud SJul, are without intermission. They have no re-
spite from pain; but the smoke of their torment, as-
cendeth · up day and night. They have nothing to
divert them from their torments even for a moment,
" Total Eclipse: no Sun, no M<_>on !"
-
no change of seasons or of companions. ThHe is no
business, bur one uninterrupted scene of horror, to
which they must be all attention. They have no in-
terval of inattention or stuftidi ty : they are all-eye, all-
ear, all-sense. Every. instant of their duration, it may
t.e said of their wholeframe, that they are
" Tremblingly alive all o'er,
And smart and agonize at every pore."
3· And'of this duration there is no end! What ll

r~bes,' with aU the priests dressed in their vestments,
and all the rest clothed in white, and meet Alexander,
and not fear any evil from that kin,, insomuch as he
would protect them.. This command was punctually
obeyed ; and accordingly this august procession, the
very day after, marched out of the city to an eminence
called Shapba, whence there was a view of all the plain,
as well as of the temple and city of Jerusalem. Here
the whole procession waited the arrival of Alexander.
The Syrians and Phenfcians \vho·were jn his army,
were persuaded that the wrath of this ,prince )VIS so
great, that he would certainly puwsh the hi3h priut
after an exemplary ma~ner, and destroy that city in the
same manner as he had done Tyre ; and ftushed with
joy upon that account; they waited i1;1 ~xpection. of
glutting their eyea with the calamities ofa people, to
whom they bore a mortal hatred.

they set ·out to meet.him with all the pomp before de·
scribed.. Ale:under was struck at the sight of the high
priest, ia whose mitre anJ forehead a golden plate was

raised their voices to wbh him every kind of prospe-
rity. All the spectators were seiud with inexpressb!e
surprise; they -could scarce belie'Ve their eyes; and did
not know how to account for a Sight, so contrary · to
their expectation.anci so vastly improbable.
Parmenio, who could not yet recover from his asto•
nishment, asked the king how it came fo pass that he,
who was adored by every one, adored the high priest ~
I do 'not, replied Alexander, adore the high priest, but
the God whose minister he is ; for whilst I was at
Dius in Macedonia (my miud wholly fixed on the
great design of the Persian war,)as I was revolving the'
methods how to conquer Asia, this very man, dressed
in the same robes, appeared to we in a dream ; exhort·
ed me to banish every fear, bid me cross the Helles-
pont boldly; and assured me, that God would march
at the head of my army, and give me victory over that
of the Persians.
Alexander added, that the instant he saw this priest,
he knew him by his habit, his stature, his air, and his
face, to be the same person wb,1m he had seen at Dius;
that he was firmly persua~ed, it was by the command,
and under fhe ·immediate conlfuct of heaven, that he
had undertaken this war ; that he was sure he should .

her summer lodgings all the winter, aud so would dis·

staying at the door_; llld IS the maid did DOt appre.
bend any mischief, she went in after him ; for he did
not look like one that came with an ill design, or to rob
the bouse, but looked like a gentleman that could have
Jlo such int~nt ; so I say she went in after him.
When she came in, he rose up and looking about
the room, he found faul~ with every thing there, even

c:icb, far above be quality that ~wned it; .and -said, that
~he lady did not know what she did, .that it was an ex·
pence s'le could not carry on, and her estate would not
support it; and that such a way of li4'J-IIg wmald bring
..
her and all the family to rwin and beggary, ami.'the
like.
By:and by, she ~arried him iuto anJtber parlotw;
and there- he found fiMllt in the $3me .IJianner: he
told her, he was surplised at what' her .Jady meant,
and that she lived· at &<> extr.avag~nt a rate as Sir John'•
estate could nell'er maintain, but ·would nm him inte
debt,and ruin him ; and so be would lte uwdone by her
extravagance. .
Upon this the maid began to take' him short a
little, and told him, that this · was all out ·of the
way of what he came about; if the lodgin~s ' were
too good for him, that was hi' ·busine·ss indeed;
aut e111e he had nothing to do with her lady's -conduct,
and how she pleased to furnish her house; that bee
master was a gentleman or' a great estate, and had large
p~antations in .Jamaica ; that he constantly supplied her
Jady with money sufficient for her support, and for aU
ber upenees; and she wondered he 'Should trouble

However, he turns to the maid, and sittittg down
again, calmly entered into some · discourse wilh her
about her lady, aud her way of living, and told so
many of the secrets of the family to her, that she be.
gan to be more mild with him, and perceived he knew
.,ore of the family than ~he thought he had, or indeed
than she did herself; at last the girl began to be very
uneasy, and to -question \ll·ith herself, whether it was
not her maate~, come over incognito, and that he had
not yet discovered himsdi.
She trN:d several times to learn who he ~as, his
'}llality, his counu-y, his name, and how she might send
to him ; but he always put it off, and only told her -be

ing him, .ao that he did not vanish as an appari-
1ion.
Yet all this time the poor gi.rl was very uneasy ; she
'began to think it could not be an ordinary creature,
because he gave such strange and particular accounts
of things done in the .family ; such as, where seveFal
things were· deposited that_ belonged to the f~mily, with
uveral circumstances belonging to her mistress, to her
little son, ~nd to his father in the Weat·lodies.: and,
41 shor~, said some things. \vhich, as she imagined,
eone bllt the devil could teU ·of; which. by the way,

was talking as ignorant people talk of such things.;.
namely, that if any thing be said, or done, out of the
oroinary .way, and more than is common for men I()
talk or to do, they will immediately say, it must be the
devil.
The pO()r gifl was very much surprised at this gen-
tleman's appearance, and more so after he was gone
~han before ; fur he did not give her time to reflect up.
on. the par:iculars he mentioned to her; but relating
one thi_
ng after another, she hai enough to do to take
in the heads in general.
But when he was ·gone, and she came to rtftect and
compare· things together, she began to consider, wh~
cou!d this po;sibfy be? how could he know such and
such things? how could he tell whos~ picture that
was? where my mistress had st.rch a. suit of cunain~
and such a cabinet ? Who must he be, to tell me lio\'1
long my master has been at Jamaica, how much his
esta-te is there, and how much money he hn sent my
lady over, at such and· such times? This must be the
deTil in my master's dothes; ~omethin g must be in it;
1'11 go to my lady, and let her know it all; and wi1h
this the maiJ gets .a woman, that used to be t1 usted irt
such c~ses, to look arter the house, and away .she ~·.
to Hampstead to her mistress. · ,

eucb a penon tud been there, and gave her aome par-
ticular tokens, by which he ~aid her mistrett would un•
tleratand who he was> and that she 6bould tell her what
be said, that her income would not 81tpport the ex-
pences she lived at, but that it would bring ber to r11inP
and she would be undo~e ; but this part I do not po-
sitively remember; but am certain t~t be told the maid
it would be se.
However, the poorgirl, the more she rwminated upon
· the thing, tke more she was alarmed at it; ilt length,
away she went, as I have said, to gh·e her lady an ac-
count of what had happened·; and she was the more
eager to go, as she understood, that he intended to wait
~pon ·her himself, to talk about the lod&iugs, and so she
would prepare her lady to receive him, and to.consider
what kind of a man it must be, thJt she must not be
frighted at him; but he had been too quick for the maid.
Wt:en she came to Hampstead. she found her mis-
tre.ss .lying upon the· bed, an~ so very ill, tbat.they at
fi1$t told her she could not be spoke with. Don't te!J

When desired to be tender of his health, he said, I'll

her vile suggestions might have brought him to a

remained. He was apprehensive every moment of
being arrested, and thr<>wn into jail by h1s creditors.-
Had he sold his halt-pay, it would have. bten by nG

expect al>ove two hundred pounds f<>r it, and five
hundred would have ·been hardly sufficient to gratify
his creditors.
He therefore formed a res<>lution to go <'Ver to ITe-

he was arrested, and there being several actions against

The soul receives not its perfections or activity from ,
the body, but can live and act out of the body d well
as in the body, yea, and much better, having then ita
perfect liberty, diYested of that heavy incumbrance
which only clogged andfettered it. "Doubtless, saith
Tartullian, when the soul is seperated from tfle body
it comes out of darkness into its own pure and perfect
light, and quickly finds itself a substantial being, able
to act freely in that light, and participate of heavnyly
Joys." A testimony of this sort 1 have just received
·of a gentleman, one Mr Jos, Reyncr, lately deceased,
who, in his last momen:s, though on a bed of sickness
·and pain, was in such ..raptures ofjoy, that he said he
·felt no pain at all, but declared that he was then in
·heaven, meaning Ms soul ; ·and that he heard distinctly
·music, as of angels singing mos.t melodiously, and
:would join with tbem, as h1! did in the words of a hymn
with "Hallelujah," &c, and his soul soon dnparted in
that moat triamphant manner. This account was re-

jn shining raiment, surrounded whh a blaze- of light
descend into my room: hi• hair seemed 1\ke sparkling

and ~tlorious. He approached me, and said, " John
" Morris, l am sent h·om God to tell thee, that t)le

" many of them in reality his people, and that the
" doctrines which they teach are the doctrines of the

"-band a Book which contaios the Mmd and Will of
!c God." He then, to my apprehension, put a boot
upon my brea.st, saying, " Search.tbl& Book and it will
shew the right way to Salvatiun." And the.n addect,
" Your petition was, that God wo11ld send an angel co

•' not sufficient strength· to bear a· sight so glorious,

• you a token, that wheo you awake you may be · sa•
n tisfierl that the Methodists arP God's people; whom
" I charl'te you to join, and ne\'ef te leave ""bile tbey

the angel gave of hia visitation, was~ by pressing tbe

tip o his finger thrice upon my naked breast, which
cailfed exquitite pain and instantly awoke me. Imme-
-diately 1 fe-ttin :my bosom and found the book, which
was-t.be Old. anci.New Testament bound up for ·the
pocket, and which belonged to the room where I lay.
The young man who slept with me was equally as-
tonished with myself, because we wer~ both certain
that ihe book lity upon a box at some distance from the
bed when we retired to rest. The pain in my breast
continued only two or three days, bnt the mark re-
mained visi!Jle for some months : when I af1er'Ward1·
. . .
shewed it to tke person who brought me among the
Methodists, and related all the circumsrances, he was
so astonished at the sight, that he almost fainted.
As soon as the day dawned I was anxious to exam•
jde' my book, and· WI$ much surprised when l found
it;was the Bible, and more especially, as it is a thing
uncommon for Catholics to:read the Scriptures. I now
embraced every opportunity of perusing this sacred
Treasury, io whiclt I found my own present state des-
cribed, and the way of Salntion clearly pointed out.
1· likewise immeditltely joiqed the Methodists, and
trust I shall ,Jive and die among them. This step'
Mwever brought upon me a torrent of persecution
from all quarters, particulaily from my relations. n.y
fdlowrservants, and from the mob that infested the
Methodist Meeting.

Its richest treasures aid the mountill~ blaze,
'Twas all conf~sion, tumult and ama7;e.
When, lo! a cloud just opening on the view,
Illum'd with dazzling Hghtthe etherial blu~!
On its broad breast a mighty angeJ came, .
His eyes were lightning, and his robes a flame.
' O'er all his form the circling glor~es run,
And his face iighten'd as the blazing suo;
Hi~ limbs with heJven's aerial vesture glow,
And o'er his head was hung the aweepingbow.
As shines tke bright'ning steers refulgent gleam,
When tbe smooth blade reflects the'sparkling beam,
Its light with quickened glance the eye -surveys,
Green, gold, and vermil, trembling as it plays,
So ftam•d ~is wings along the etherial road,
And earth's long shores resoundeJ as he trod.

Freely flash before him :
Myriads with ~~p-reme delight
Instantly adore him.
Angel trumps resound.his.fam~,.
Lutes of shining gold proclaim
All the music of his name~
Through eternity the same.
Fo~rt and twenty elders rise,
From their princely stations :
Shout his glorious victorie1,
Sing the great salvation : .
Cast their crowns before his throne,

Holy! lioly I holy ·One!
