PREFACE
Back in December, 1925, Professor William McDougall, Mr.
Harry Houdini, and I, while eating luncheon in the grill room of
the Bancroft Hotel, Worcester, Massachusetts, began talking about
spirit mediums, psychic phenomena, and other matters relating to
psychical research. Professor McDougall and Mr. Houdini, though
the best of friends, did not seem to be in entire agreement concerning
certain matters that have become of wide social interest because of
newspaper emphasis. Half jokingly and half in earnest, I suggested
that they and other representatives thrash out the entire matter in a
public symposium to be held at Clark University. The suggestion
struck both of them with great force, and the three of us worked
together in the lobby for more than two hours, planning the form
of the symposium as well as we could at that early date. The Presi-
dent and Trustees of Clark University were favorable to the idea,
and voted the use of certain funds left to Clark University some
yfears ago for such purposes.
We want it distinctly understood that Clark University, in pro-
moting this symposium, is by no means assuming the role of friend
to psychical research and its various adherents. Clark University is
assuming only the role of parliamentarian in the controversy. At
this moment it is well to announce that the members of the Clark
University Department of Psychology are most decidedly not yet con-
vinced of the validity of the psychical interpretations based upon the
subject matter of psychical research. Being scientists, we guarantee
fair play in the conduct of this symposium. If there is a spirit world,
we also, being human beings, are interested in learning about it.
Great care has been exercised in determining the individuals to
whom invitations would be extended to participate in this symposium.
We do not believe that a more able group of authorities could pos-
sibly be selected. A majority of the speakers are of world renown,
and are experts of the highest order.
The manuscripts from Sir Oliver Lodge and from Professor John
E. Coover arrived too late to be presented during the symposium,
which was held "at Clark University November 29 to December 11,
1926, and so are printed here for the first time. The letters from Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle and from Professor Joseph Jastrow continue
the controversy initiated during the symposium, and are printed here

in order to make clear the convictions of these two gentlemen. The
reprint of Dr. Walter F. Prince's article from the American Journal
of Psychology, which we have inserted at the end of his address, is
placed in this volume in order to make clear the differences of ob-
servation and interpretation existing between Dr. Prince and Dr.
Crandon. We extend grateful thanks to the American Journal of
Psychology for permission to reprint this article. Mr. Harry Hou-
dini was to have been a speaker in this symposium, but his untimely
death prevented. In consultation with Mrs. Houdini we have agreed
that the best existing statement of Mr. Houdini's convictions in this
field are represented in the chapters which Mrs. Houdini and Harper
& Brothers have very kindly allowed to be reprinted from A Magi-
cian Among the Spirits. This book is only two years old, and Mrs.
Houdini agrees that it still represents Mr. Houdini's final convictions
on the subject.
Clark University offers this volume to the public, sincerely hoping
that it may prove useful to the many thousands of people who are
keenly interested, but who find it difficult to become well informed
in this controversial field. This volume should remain for many years
the authoritative source for expert opinion concerning the case for
and against psychical belief.

BY SIR OLIVER LODGE
I
UNIVERSITIES AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
I can but heartily welcome the pioneer effort of the Clark Univer-
sity to take the subject of Psychical Research under its wing and
give it the prestige of academic recognition. The event is an im-
portant one, for hitherto the subject has not made its way and
effected an entrance into the precincts of orthodox science. Not yet,
for instance, has a serious attempt been made to bring it under the
official notice of the Royal Society. The nearest approach to such
an attempt was made by Sir William Crookes when he unsuccess-
fully invited one of the Secretaries of that august body to witness a
simple and inexplicable physical phenomenon. Neither has the British
Association, a more omniverous body, ever seriously attended to it
in any of its sections. An attempt was made by Sir William Barrett
in 1876, with Thought Transference as the thin end of a wedge, to
effect an entrance; but though his paper was read, its publication
was suppressed.
Hence, so far, the scientific world in its corporate capacity has
saved its face and held aloof from phenomena which have aroused the
attention and enlisted the services of individual workers in science.
Such workers have entered on the subject at their own risk and with
inevitable damage to their reputation. Yet the British Association
has long had an Anthropological Section, under which a study of
human faculty, even of an unrecognized kind, might have found a
place ;
and recently it has developed a Psychological Section, to which
presumably the subject may some day be held to belong. Meanwhile,
however, that Section has limited itself, certainly in the main, to
orthodox experimental and introspective psychology.
I believe that something of the same kind may be said of the lead-
ing American and Continental Societies, so that the scientific world
may be absolved from any contaminating contact with such a theme,

SURVEY OF THE SUBJECT
By Psychical Research is intended a careful, and as far as possible
exhaustive, investigation into those faculties of mankind which have
not yet become familiar, and which have failed to attract universal
attention. For there are obscure faculties, sometimes called super-
normal faculties, which are not yet incorporated into orthodox Psy-
chology, though some of them are forcing their way into practical
recognition by philosophers and medical practitioners. One of these
is the phenomenon of Hypnotism. So recently as my own youth, it
was utterly discredited, believed in by some whom it was the fashion
to call "quacks and charlatans ;" whereas now it has become a fairly
recognized department of medical practice.
Another human faculty, not as yet so fully investigated, is Clair-
voyance, including Telepathy, that is to say the ascertainment of in-
formation by other than the usual channels; whether it be by what
is called "mind-reading/* which has never been explained, or by some
still more unintelligible process, to which we have not a clue.
Professor Richet has called the faculty by what he intends to be the
non-committal name of "Cryptesthesia," though one of its forms is
often called psychometry. The reading of sealed documents, the
contents of which are not known to anyone present, is perhaps the
simplest or most easily cited example of this faculty; and this is not
the place to discuss how far this apparent clairvoyance is or is not
another variety of mind-reading. Nor is it the place to consider the
evidence for such a faculty. Suffice it to say that many serious in-
vestigators are convinced that such a faculty exists. The name
"cryptesthesia" rather assumes that it is due to some hyper-activity of
the organs of sense. But all admit that as yet we have no theory.
At present we have to ascertain the facts and leave a theory to the
future. Such a waiting attitude is a commonplace of Science. In
the most modern Physics we are familiar with it, e. g. in the recently
discovered Quantum, in the nature of Gravitation, and in our rela-
tions to the Ether generally. Facts may be known long before they
are explained ; and indeed a scientific explanation, even when attained,
is never ultimate.
Other branches of psychic or metapsychic investigation are con-

nected with the lucidity of certain persons in a trance state, and the
powers of the subconscious generally. It is found that occurrences
elsewhere, or in the past, or occasionally even in the future, are thus
somehow decipherable; as if access to wider knowledge, or to the
knowledge of other persons, were open to the liberated personality
of the entranced medium. Or, what seems to many investigators
more likely, as if information were communicated by other intel-
ligences through his or her bodily organism as through a kind of tele-
phone. Some regard this phenomenon one way, some another, but
all who have had adequate experience admit its reality as well as its
extra-ordinary or supernormal character.
The nature of inspiration is another branch, in which not much
progress has been made. The fact has always been recognized; for
the theory we still can wait. No theory fortunately has been laid
down ex cathedra on inadequate data. The inspiration of poets, the
inspiration of saints and mystics, comes we know not how ;
we feel the
vivifying breath of the spirit but we may not trace as yet its proximate
source. The temptation is to treat the products of inspiration as
oracular, which perhaps they are, and as infallible, which they are
not. We must not attribute infallibility to anything that reaches us
through a human channel, whether it be a Book or a Church or any
other medium.
I would not draw an antithesis by objecting to the phrase 'Verbal
inspiration," for surely the greatest poets are verbally inspired in the
sense that what they have to say is perfectly expressed. We should
study and reverence the great utterances; but it is superstitious folly
to treat every utterance as of equal value. As Matthew Arnold
eloquently urged, it is absurd and mechanical and illiterate to con-
sider that every part of a book or of a literature is equally author-
itative throughout. Indeed this is not done now save by those ultra
conservative good people who dare not let go of their anchorage in
the rising tide, and who cling pathetically to submerged rocks. Yet,
read intelligently, ancient documents are full of value and evolution-
ary instruction, and of unconscious corroboration illustrative of psy-
chic truths; and inspiration is a great reality, a geniune avenue to
truth, a beneficent fount which may grow and be of more and more
service to us as time goes on and we become more receptive.
Other psychic phenomena, familiar enough as to the facts, but ob-
scure in their theory, are those associated with Sleep and Dreams,
which may be ranked among the minor activities of the subconscious.

And lastly, and chiefly, the phenomenon of Death. It is perhaps
principally in connection with the subject of death that the present
outcome of Psychical Research appears to be in conflict with tradi-
tional beliefs that have come down to us as portions of religious faith.
Psychical Research is primarily an enquiry, and as such has no
creed. But it has established the reality and truth of the phenomena
which at present we group under Hypnotism, Telepathy, and Clair-
voyance; while most of the investigators have gradually become con-
vinced that existence is continuous, that death is not the end; or, in
popular phraseology, that man is an immortal being.
It may be said that that is no new discovery, that nearly every form
of Religion has held it, that it is a prime article of faith. Quite true,
but it has not been till lately an article of scientific knowledge. It
has been accepted as an article of faith, it has not been proven,
not proven, that is, for the generality of mankind. The proof in-
volves the definite assertion that those whom we call "the dead" or
"the departed" have not only in some sense survived, but that they
are still more or less in touch with us, and that occasionally they are
able to demonstrate their continued existence and interest by actual
communication. This is not really new, so far as statements and
examples go. Religious literature is full of supernormal communica-
tions. But the possibility has never been fully recognized, and has
never been made use of as a comfort to the bereaved and as a means
of obtaining information about the conditions of a future state. The
beliefs of religious people on this subject are reverent but vague, so
vague that the consolations legitimately derivable from knowledge
are not forthcoming. For all practical purposes, the dead might as
well be extinct.
But by psychic investigations, it is held, not only the existence, but
the activities of the "dead" have been demonstrated; and the power
of inter-communion has been shown to be a fact. This may be dis-
credited. Not every investigator is yet convinced. The fact if it
be a fact is a great one ; and its complete demonstration takes time.
I am sure that continued enquiry will demonstrate it to the full.
Meanwhile it is quite legitimate to hold a different opinion. Belief
is not to be coerced ; nor should one who has been convinced by direct
experience feel unduly impatient to convince others. Truth will
make its way; he that believeth need not make haste; in quietness and
confidence should be our strength.

And lastly, and chiefly, the phenomenon of Death. It is perhaps
principally in connection with the subject of death that the present
outcome of Psychical Research appears to be in conflict with tradi-
tional beliefs that have come down to us as portions of religious faith.
Psychical Research is primarily an enquiry, and as such has no
creed. But it has established the reality and truth of the phenomena
which at present we group under Hypnotism, Telepathy, and Clair-
voyance; while most of the investigators have gradually become con-
vinced that existence is continuous, that death is not the end; or, in
popular phraseology, that man is an immortal being.
It may be said that that is no new discovery, that nearly every form
of Religion has held it, that it is a prime article of faith. Quite true,
but it has not been till lately an article of scientific knowledge. It
has been accepted as an article of faith, it has not been proven,-
not proven, that is, for the generality of mankind. The proof in-
volves the definite assertion that those whom we call "the dead" or
"the departed" have not only in some sense survived, but that they
are still more or less in touch with us, and that occasionally they are
able to demonstrate their continued existence and interest by actual
communication. This is not really new, so far as statements and
examples go. Religious literature is full of supernormal communica-
tions. But the possibility has never been fully recognized, and has
never been made use of as a comfort to the bereaved and as a means
of obtaining information about the conditions of a future state. The
beliefs of religious people on this subject are reverent but vague, so
vague that the consolations legitimately derivable from knowledge
are not forthcoming. For all practical purposes, the dead might as
well be extinct.
But by psychic investigations, it is held, not only the existence, but
the activities of the "dead" have been demonstrated; and the power
of inter-communion has been shown to be a fact. This may be dis-

be a fact-is a great one; and its complete demonstration takes time.
I am sure that continued enquiry will demonstrate it to the full.

The phenomena cannot be considered new; they have been ap-

prehended by serious individuals in many stages of the world's devel-
opment. Some of them were not unknown to Plato and to Virgil.
I am told by scholars that Plotinus, that great Neoplatonist, was
acquainted with many of them, and was not unprepared to assimilate
them into his mystic philosophy. From time to time they have at-
tracted a recrudescence of attention. John Wesley was at one time
impressed with their reality; and the quondam physicist Swedenborg
developed them in his own person so extensively as practically to over-
cloud his physics. Within the memory of a few still living the sub-
ject was as it were reborn, and forced into public attention, partly in
America, partly in Britain, in the teeth of much ridicule and some
virulent opposition, and under circumstances which seemed at the
time very damaging.
Still the phenomena occurred, and in the year 1882, under the in-
fluence and the enthusiasm of Sir William Barrett, F. W. H. Myers,
Edmund Gurney, and others at Cambridge, who succeeded in en-
listing the interest and judicial calm of Professor Henry Sidgwick,
and a few other distinguished men, a definite Society was founded
for the purpose of examining whether any truth underlay all these
assertions, and of studying every variety of obscure human faculty,
so as if possible to sift out the trustworthy evidence from what might
be baseless assertion and superstition, and so gradually to put the
thing on a careful and scientific basis.
The popular notion about this Society is that it was founded to
establish scientifically the actuality of human survival. That might
or might not be the outcome of the Society's work ; but that was not
the object with which it was founded. There were certainly facts
about human personality, one of which was Hypnotism, which,
though it had long been under a cloud, was beginning to be recognized
by the medical profession; and it seemed likely enough that there
were others which could be brought to book, and either established
or discarded, if the attempt were made to examine the evidence with-
out prepossession and with critical care.
The English S. P. R. was not the only Society established for in-
vestigation, though it seems to have been the first of the permanent
ones. In 1884 a Society for Psychical Research was initiated in
America, mainly by Sir William Barrett, for the purpose of advancing
psychical research in America in co-operation with the English
Society. Professor Simon Newcomb was the first President ; and the
Officers and Council included: Professor G. Stanley Hall of Balti-

Dr. H. P. Bowditch, and Dr. C. S. Minot, all of Harvard Uni-

others. In 1890 this Society was, by its own request, converted into
a Branch of the English Society ;
Dr. Richard Hodgson acting as the
Secretary and Treasurer, and Professor William James and Profes-
sor S. P. Langley as an Advisory Committee. In 1905 Dr. Hodgson
died, and in the following year the Branch was dissolved, the
majority of its members being transferred to the English Society.
Dr. Hyslop then formed an independent organization, the present
American Society for Psychical Research.
The aim of the British Society, and presumably also of the Amer-
ican, was a study of human personality, and all its possibilities; one
of those possibilities being the survival of bodily death, towards be-
lief in which, as an established scientific fact, several of the individual
founders and workers in the Society gradually drifted, as is par-
ticularly emphasized in the standard Treatise written by Myers
towards the end of his life, and published after his death under the
title Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death.
This last, however, was a deduction from the facts which was not
universally acceptable even by those who entered on the study se-
riously. Many of theN
Continental workers to this day refrain from
giving assent to this conclusion as a deduction from the facts; while
yet they have no doubt that the facts themselves are well established.
A few still find themselves able to adhere to a materialistic view of
the universe in spite of them. Others there are whom the evidence
has convinced that survival of bodily death is a true deduction, and
these have been led to infer, as established on a basis of strict evi-
dence, what Myers called "the preamble of all religions," viz. the
existence of a spiritual world. These have maintained that the facts
could only be explained, (if such in the present state of knowledge
can be called an explanation), by the postulate of an interaction
between spirit and matter far wider than is exhibited by the ordinary
existence and normal behaviour of humanity, and have been led to the
conclusion that what was being unearthed was nothing less than the
opening of a new volume in Science, and the discovery of a whole
new world of beings, unfamiliar to us and unrecognized by the normal
senses, who yet under certain conditions are able to interact with
matter and to produce by their activity and latent powers results be-
yond the ordinary capacity of man.

That such a conclusion is absurd or impossible cannot be rationally
held. We know too little about the universe to make assertions
of that character, far too little to make an absolute denial of what is
possible. The human senses, which we share with the animals, tell
us a certain amount about the universe; but they are very limited
in scope. Science deals with a multitude of inferences beyond the
direct apprehension of the senses. By the senses alone, however
aided by instruments, we should never have arrived at the structure
of the atom. While as for the Ether of Space, it is so elusive, in-
tangible and insensible to human faculty, that it is quite possible to
doubt its existence. What we know is that mind and matter do in-
teract, that life does make use of material particles to display itself;
and what other capacities it may have, whatever other physical mani-
festations may be within its power, we can only ascertain by scrup-
ulous and long-continued investigation.
One of the faculties which seem to have been put on a firm
foundation by the labours of the S. P. R. is the previously unrecog-
nized faculty of telepathy, the action of mind on mind apart from
the ordinary organs of sense. A brain-muscle mechanism is needed
to display it; indeed, without such mechanism, no manifestation is
possible. But the process itself seems independent of the mechanism,
and seems likely to continue even when the mechanism has been
discarded. Thus telepathy alone, if its reality can be admitted,
seemed a great stride in the direction of rendering survival of mental
activity apart from the body, with continued memory and character
and personality reasonably possible.
But many of the investigators have gone far beyond that. Human
faculty in their view is not limited to mental impressions. Many
physical phenomena are also asserted to occur in the presence of
certain individuals. Physiological phenomena have been observed,
which seem to enlarge the known possibilities of living organisms;
and the existence of a protoplasmic material, which can take on
shapes akin to that of the body, and can produce the motion of pieces
of matter not in contact with the normal body, is, especially by Con-
tinental observers, maintained. It is further held by some that the
personality of some exceptional individuals is not limited to the man-
ipulation of their normal bodily organisms, but can reach out to a
distance, abandoning the organism for a time, say, during trance,
somewhat after the same fashion as it may abandon it permanently
at death ; and thus can re-act on organisms, obtain and give in forma-

tion, and produce physical results at a distance, to a surprising and
and otherwise inexplicable and incredible extent. By such means it
is held that communion with the departed is possible, and that per-
sonalities not now associated with the flesh can still occasionally in-
teract with the organism, and that by their aid, or with the help of
that hypothesis, many otherwise inexplicable phenomena can be re-
garded in a rational, and ultimately it is hoped in a truly scientific,
light.
The first step undoubtedly is to make sure of the facts, but the as-
similation and recognition of facts is always aided by some kind
of working hypothesis. To admit the facts is one thing; to con-
sider the hypothesis as verified is another. Those who, from long
habit and lifelong study of orthodox science, feel such a hypothesis
to be wild and unpalatable, find it safest to deny the facts. Others
there are, however, equally hostile to the spiritistic hypothesis, who
yet feel constrained to admit the facts as the result of direct ob-
servation.
Some of these facts if for the moment on legitimate authority
I am allowed to call them facts are violently incredible, especially
those which deal with ectoplasmic formations of a physiological and
yet temporary character. Such facts must seem especially repellent
to a physiologist. Yet eminent physiologists, like Charles Richet of
the University of Paris, feel constrained on the evidence to admit
them. The subject has grown too large for contemptuous denial;
we have not exhausted the possibilities of the universe ; strange things
do undoubtedly occur. Whether among those strange thfngs we can
reasonably include Materialisations, Dematerialisations, and what
are called Apports, I prefer to leave an entirely open question.
To many members of the S. P. R. the difficulty of admitting
physical and physiological phenomena has been so great as to make
them withhold their favourable judgment in every possible case; and
in their examinations they have taken such stringent precautions that
they may sometimes have succeeded in making them as impossible as
they appear. Nevertheless individuals, one after the other, have
succumbed to the evidence; and there is a growing body of opinion
among the workers that, not only the mental phenomena, but some
of the physical and physiological occurrences, will turn out to be
realities. I, for instance, venture to assert that objects can be moved
beyond the range of the normal body and without any ordinary con-

is a matter on which dogmatism would be inappropriate. Yet it is

Ill
A WORKING HYPOTHESIS FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
I venture to think that if a University takes a subject up, in ad-
dition to scrutiny of facts and past records, it is desirable to have
a working hypothesis, with which to attempt to lay the foundation
for a theory of the phenomena, both psychical and physical. Both
are the result of an interaction between mind and matter, the theory
of which has been an age-long problem in Philosophy; and my view
is that the mechanism of this interaction will not be solved or under-
stood until the universal connecting medium, the Ether of Space,
is taken into full account.
Consider first psycho-physical phenomena. They appear to be
operated through the intermediation of a material substance, of an
organized or protoplasmic character, drawn from the body, and tem-
porarily used both for exerting force on material objects, and for
moulding into certain shapes, giving the appearance of the semi-
physiological structures called materialisations. There is good evidence,
though perhaps not complete proof, that ectoplasmic structures can
be seen and handled; sometimes seen but not touched, sometimes
touched but not seen ;
and that these structures can imitate hands and
faces, or limbs, or even complete portions of bodies, and can exert
force so as to move inert material objects, in obedience to requests,
and with signs of intelligence.
Whether the control is exercised by the unconscious mind of the
entranced medium, or by some other intelligence, is an open question ;
but if the facts be granted (at any rate provisionally) we clearly have
to ask how this control over matter is exercised, and we are thrown
back upon the prior and ancient question of how our own control
over matter is exercised. We ourselves have a permanent proto-

porarily used both for exerting force on material objects, and for
moulding into certain shapes, giving the appearance of the semi-

plasmic organism which can do all these things and more. My hypo-
thesis is that normally we do not act on matter directly, but indirectly
through the ether. We are familiar with this kind of action through
the ether in electrical, magnetic, and optical experiments, all of which
are performed in that way. A magnet does not act on a piece of iron
directly, but modifies the ether in its neighbourhood, so that the action
is exerted. Similarly a gravitational field is an etherial phenomenon,
and causes bodies to move towards the earth in the familiar way.
Again the action of the sun on the earth, to which we owe nearly all
terrestrial energy, is conducted through the ether by the agency in
that case of light or radiation. Furthermore chemical affinity and co-
hesion are all of a concealed electrical nature. We have learnt that
no atom is in contact with any other atom, nor are the parts of an
atom in contact with each other; they are united or connected by a
medium, and all force is exerted through the connecting medium.
It seems to me probable that this idea should be extended to mind,
and that when we move our limbs, or other bodies in contact with
those limbs, we should suppose that we are exerting the force in-
directly through some mental modification of the ether. In other
words, I assume that mind is directly connected with, and (so to
speak) inhabits, the ether, and thus performs the operations to which
we are accustomed ; it would then be less difficult to admit that thus
also these unusual ones are effected for which we are beginning to
collect evidence.
It may be a difficult hypothesis, for which there is at present less
than adequate foundation; but so far as I know it is the only one in
the field, and until it is disproved it is worth following up and using
as a clue. The material called ectoplasm cannot be acting by itself;
it must be inert like any other form of matter, just like our own
muscles. Nevertheless the muscles are obedient to our will, are sub-
ject to intelligent control, the stimulus of which, though communi-
cated through our nerves, is conveyed to them somehow from the
central ganglia in the brain and nervous system. There is, however,
an unexplored gap in the process, the gap between mind and brain,
or between mental activity and nerve centres, about which we are
still in the dark. If it should turn out to be a fact that mind in-
habits and acts upon an etherial organism or etheric body, through
which matter is got at and moved, the problem is not solved, but is
pushed one step further back, which indeed is a characteristic of all
physical explanations. We know that ether and matter interact.

habits and acts upon an etherial organism or etheric body, through
which matter is got at and moved, the problem is not solved, but is
pushed one step further back,-which indeed is a characteristic of all
physical explanations. We know that ether and matter interact.
UNIVERSITY ASPECT OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH 13
We must assume that mind and ether interact, and that this last
interaction is of a closer and more fundamental kind than any in-
direct action between mind and matter.
Furthermore, when we come to consider more purely psychic
phenomena, such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and the like, we are not
so obviously, but still as really, faced with some mental action on
matter, since these phenomena can only be testified to by speech or
writing, or in some other mechanical way. Telepathy may be a
direct action between mind and mind; but it is only displayed and
made manifest when it also acts upon a brain and nerve mechanism,
so that the thought is reproduced and information given through our
vocal or other muscles, and received through our normal sense organs.
The problem is therefore not different in character, only different in
appearance, from other psycho-physical manifestations. The root
of the problem, in this case, is whether there is any direct connection
between mind and mind apart from an etherial connecting medium.
It may be that in this case also mind and mind communicate through
the ether.
Such a guess has often been made and often discarded ; but it may
have been discarded prematurely. If our real existence is definitely
and inseparably connected with the ether, it is clear that we have
thereby a physical kind of connection, which may or may not be
utilized, but which needs exploration. If ever it should be proved
that mind acts on matter through the ether, we may have to extend
that and find that mind acts on mind through the ether. Whatever
doubt exists about psycho-physical phenomena hardly applies to the
connection between mind and mind. The normal method of com-
munication is through the physical organisms of the two people con-
cerned, as by speech or writing. We do not understand that process,
we have only grown accustomed to it. It is evidently an indirect and
roundabout process; but the discovery of telepathy shows that there
is some more direct process of communication ; and sooner or later we
must ask how the idea or thought is conveyed, and what the action
of mind on mind really means.
The evidence is already strong, and is growing in bulk and cogency,
that we are in communication with minds which are discarnate, that
is minds which have been deprived of their normal bodily material
mechanism. But it does not at all follow that they have been de-
prived of their etheric bodies, by which presumably they commu-
nicate with each other, and occasionally, under exceptional circum-

stances, with us. Telepathy from the discarnate, if established,
proves that matter is not concerned in the process, at least at the
sending end, though matter is involved in the demonstration of the
action to us. It may be that there is some direct psychic activity
which we do not understand ; but the hypothesis that the psychic and
the physical are always connected or interrelated, and that the dis-
carnate still have etheric bodies, through which they conduct all
their activities, is growing in strength, and has to be faced. If we
find that our own normal activities are really conducted in precisely
the same way, that is if we find that the incarnate are acting directly
through the ether, and that in that way we have constructed and
work the mechanism of our own bodies, then the further step will
not be so difficult.

have a thread on which to string them. And the view that the ether
is not only a physical connecting medium, but is also the habitation
of mind and spirit, and that in terms of that connection all else will
have ultimately to be understood, is one that growingly commends
itself to me. Many facts can be adduced in support of it; I am not
aware of any that definitely contradict it. That, however, is a sub-

hypothesis in detail to any University Faculty which enters upon the

THE PSYCHIC QUESTION AS I SEE IT
BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
I am sorry not to be present in person at your gathering, for
every enquiry into Psychic matters excites my deep sympathy and
interest. I consider it to be infinitely the most important thing in
the world, and the particular thing which the human race in its
present state of development needs more than anything else. Nothing
is secure until the religious basis is secure, and that spiritualistic
movement with which I am proud to be associated is the first
attempt ever made in modern times to support faith by actual
provable fact.

I would first state my credentials, since my opinion is only of
value in so far as those are valid. In 1886, being at that time
a materialist, I was induced to examine psychic phenomena. In
1887 I wrote a signed article in "Light" upon the question. From
that time I have never ceased to keep in touch with the matter by
reading and occasional experiment. My conversion to the full
meaning of spiritualism was a very gradual one, but by the war time
it was complete. In 1916 I gave a lecture upon the subject, and
found that it gave strength and comfort to others. I therefore
determined to devote all my time to it, and so in the last ten years
I have concentrated upon it, testing very many mediums, good and
bad, studying the extensive literature, keeping in close touch with
current psychic research, and incidentally writing seven books upon
the subject. It is not possible that any living man can have had a
much larger experience. When I add that I am a Doctor of
medicine, specially trained in observation, and that as a public man
of affairs I have never shown myself to be wild or unreasonable, I
hope I have persuaded you that my opinion should have some weight
as compared with those opponents whose contempt for the subject
has been so great that it has prevented them from giving calm con-
sideration to the facts.

When the heavy hand of the medireval church had ceased to

all that had been taught. In this reaction much that was good was
swept away as well as much that was questionable. Not only did
many unreasonable dogmas and ceremonies suffer, but the very idea
of invisible beings, communicating with or taking an interest in
our human life, became a fairy tale. The Reformers wrought more
ruin than they had planned, for presently the enfranchised thinkers
destroyed all that was left. Hume, Gibbon, Tom Payne, Voltaire,
and a line of writers who culminated in the Huxleys and Ingersolls
of the Victorian era, cleared the whole universe of psychic power
and left it a mere clockwork mechanical wonder swinging in a vast
vacuo, with no sign of intelligence outside our own pigmy brains.
Such is the conception which a large part of civilized humanity, and
especially of the part which labels itself as scientific, still retains.
But meanwhile a separate line of thought and experience had
always existed, undisturbed by the waxing flood of materialism. It
was the belief in the Unseen, depending not upon faith but upon
happenings which were inexplicable save on the supposition of Intel-
ligences, high and low, apart from ourselves. There were the inces-
sant rumours of ghosts and visions, the curious experiences of mystics,
the phenomena of mediaeval witchcraft, such definite hauntings as
those recorded in the house of John Wesley, the inexplicable mircales
of the Saints. All these combined presented a formidable body of
evidence radically opposed to the conclusions of the materialists, but
they were vague and fluid. Suddenly in the inexplicable way in
which Providence works they all concentrated and challenged the
attention of the world in the shackhouse of a peasant in the north
of New York State. It was strange and rather sordid, but so for
that matter was a carpenter's Son in a manger. Divine values are
not as ours. The moment had come when religious revelation was
to be shifted from the East to the West, from the Jew to the Anglo-
Saxon. It is true that America was, and is, unaware of the vital
change, but it is also true that Palestine has never been a Christian
country.
What occurred is an oft-told tale, and I need not repeat it to you
at length. In itself it was trivial. In its results it will rank, accord-
ing to my belief, amidst the greatest advances of the human
race into the darkness which surrounds it. The facts are clear
enough for anyone who has a sense of evidence, which is by no
means a universal gift. By material signs, directed by invisible in-
telligence, information was given of a crime which had been, as was

THB PSYCHIC QUESTION AS I SEE If 17
afterwards confirmed, actually committed. The little band of vil-
lagers, who spent most of the night of March 31st, 1848, in examin-
ing the facts, and who promptly published the result of their
examination, did the finest bit of psychic research work that has
ever been carried through. It was thoroughly satisfying and con-
vincing. From that time the human race had definite proof within
their reach that it was really possible to pierce the veil of death and
to establish communication between separate planes of existence.
If anyone differs from my conclusions, I would only say that it is
unlikely that he has read the pamphlet entitled "A Report on the
Mysterious Noises heard in the house of Mr. John D. Fox," since
it is extremely rare, and that if he does read it he will find that
it bears out what I say.
The single fact is, as I have said, trivial, but the inferences are
enormous. If indeed it be true that the discarnate can draw a
latent power from our human bodies which they can use in order
to impress our senses, then why should it stop at the low level of a
murdered pedlar? May it not be used to reunite all the bonds
which Death may break? More important still, might it not be
used to get into touch with higher sources of wisdom from which
we may gain light and teaching to aid us in understanding those
problems of our being which have become so difficult that many have
despaired of a solution? That was the tremendous possibility which
had opened up before the human race.
And slowly, gradually, impeded at every step by human obsta-
cles, it is reaching that goal. It has done so completely in the case
of tens of thousands. It is doing it partially throughout the com-
munity. The main obstacles have been, first, religious obstruction
and prejudice aroused by the fear that old standards will be abolished.
These fears have seemed to be justified by the wild utterances of
some excited brains over-stimulated by the new wine of revelation.
But this is now passing away, and it is realized that spiritualism has
come not to destroy, but to clarify, regulate and make broader and
more reasonable the old conceptions of Christianity by recognizing
that cosmic Christ spirit which has descended in various forms and
degrees to all the nations of the earth. It is becoming a common
platform of knowledge upon which all earnest men can meet.
Secondly, there comes the opposition from Science. This arises
largely from those scientific men who have not looked into the
matter "it does not interest me," said Huxley, when asked to

examine it. Of those who have looked into it the vast majority
have found the facts to be unassailable. Among those who have
completely admitted both the physical phenomena and the spirit
inferences are: Sir Oliver Lodge, the father of wireless; Russel
Wallace, the confrere of Darwin; Crookes, the discoverer of six
elements; Lombroso, the famous alienist; Sir William Barrett, the
physicist; Professor Hare of America, and a host of others. An-
other array of names could be given of those who have satisfied
themselves as to the phenomena, but refuse to commit themselves
entirely to the spirit explanation. This includes such men as
Charles Richet, Professor of Physiology at Paris, Dr. Geley, Dr.
Schrenck-Notzing, Professor William James, and others. Most of
these men are prepared to admit from their own experience that a
materialised figure independent of the company, can walk the
room, talk and perform intelligent actions. How such a figure
can be differentiated from a spirit is a mystery to those who are
endowed with less subtle understandings.
The names mentioned above are those of scientists, but if we
were to inscribe those distinguished people in other ranks of life
who have experienced and fully accepted the proofs of this spiritual
intercourse, my paper would exceed all bounds. It would include
not only a long list of the greatest names in Europe, Thiers, Presi-
dent of the French Republic, Victor Hugo, Sardou and others, but
it would especially interest Americans as including the illustrious
Abraham Lincoln, who at the very crisis of the American Civil War
held counsel with unseen beings who guided him on the road which
led to national safety. A well-documented account of the incident
is to be found in Mrs. Maynard's book, "Was Lincoln a Spirit-
ualist?". Among other great Americans who have in recent years
been affected by the evidence are Professor Hyslop of Columbia
University, Luther Burbank, the famous magician of the fruit farm,
and finally, through the teaching and example of the latter, the
great Edison, who admits that his change of view with regard to
future life is due to Burbank's philosophy.
It is as well, perhaps, that advance has been slow, though 78 years
is but a trifle in the vast journey of human progression. Every

at present presented which may be rejected, but there are others
which are strong and true.
The weaker side of Spiritualism lies in the fact that its adherents
have largely been drawn from the less educated part of the com-
munity. The responsibility, of course, lies with the educated class
who have not played their part. But the result has been to bring
about a presentment of the philosophy which has often repelled
earnest minds, and in no way represents its true scope and signifi-
cance. Again, there has been no systematic cultivation of the gift
of mediumship this also being the fault of the community and the
law; with the result that it has often fallen into unworthy hands
and been exercised for purely utilitarian and worldly motives. This
holds good, so far as my experience goes, rather for America than
for Britain, but in a degree it applies to both.
Again, a retinue of rogues have been attracted to the Movement
by the fact that seances have been largely held in the dark when
the object has been to produce physical phenomena. This has
served as a screen for villainy, and the effect has been increased
occasionally by the systematic use of conjurors' apparatus. When
such fraud has been discovered it has naturally come before the
police courts and has been reported in the papers, while the success-
ful work of the honest medium gets no public notice. Hence an
entirely false view has been built up of the proportion of true to
false. But the fault lies, to some extent, with the Spiritualists, as
had they insisted upon the use of at least a red light at their seances
these would have been less easy for rogues. It is true that this
would have been done at the cost of a loss of power, for darkness 1*5
conducive to results, but none the less I think that smaller phenomena
with security are better than larger ones with a danger of scandal.
It is, however, upon the side of organized Science that the chief
fault lies if the general acceptance of the new knowledge has been
slow. The reasons for this hesitation are complex. Science has
always accustomed itself to think that results can be standardized,
and that, given the same apparent conditions and factors, the same
effects can always be evolved. It has suddenly been faced by a
proposition where this no longer holds good, where there are in-
visible factors which we cannot control, and where such mental
conditions as harmony and sympathy on one side, or suspicion and
aversion on the other, may make or mar the results. Many scien-
tists could never reconcile themselves to the idea that the results

are obtained, not by the medium but through the medium, and that
simply to seat him in a chair and blame him or the spiritualistic

essence of the problem which they were examining. These unusual
conditions repelled many scientific men at the very outset of their
psychic studies, and they prefererd to ascribe gross credulity to their

cent medium, rather than blame their own want of perception as
to the true conditions of such an investigation. It is true that of
those who did contrive to probe these matters the vast majority were
persuaded of the validity of the supernormal phenomena, but how-
ever distinguished in quality they were never numerous enough to
outweigh those who had either judged the question without examina-
tion, or had been repelled in the manner described. To this we
must add the fact that the prejudice against the question was so
strong that an Academic Career might even now be seriously
affected by acquiescence in psychic truth. Scientific men are brave
and unselfish, but they are human, and such a consideration cannot
be altogether ignored. It would not be difficult to mention cases
where men of science have joined in an investigation of psychic
claims in a light-hearted manner, imagining that an exposure of them
would be easy; but upon finding that the evidence presented to them
entailed not an exposure but an acceptance they have hurriedly with-
drawn without any attempt to give an explanation of their own ex-
perience, save, perhaps, vague innuendoes of fraud against the unfor-
tunate medium, neither sex nor social position being a protection.
At first it would appear as if the separation between strict ortho-
dox science, which allowed of no deviation from established standards
of truth, and this new unorthodox development was complete and
unbridgeable. Gradually, however, two points have been discovered

lead to many more in the future. There is really an immense
amount of valid evidence, and it needs only the constructive brain
to harmonise, organise and build up working hypotheses. At present
I will examine the two different lines of approach.
The first is Telepathy or the impressions produced by mind

are obtained, not by the medium but through the medium, and that
simply to seat him in a chair and blame him or the spiritualistic
philosophy when results did not follow was to ignore the very
essence of the problem which they were examining. These unusual
conditions repelled many scientific men at the very outset of their
psychic studies, and they prefererd to ascribe gross credulity to their
brother scientists, or extraordinary conjuring powers to the inno-
cent medium, rather than blame their own want of perception as
to the true conditions of such an investigation. It is true that of

of material science. The existence of Telepathy has been so well

established, largely through the labours of Myers, Gurney and other
members of the Psychic Research Society of England, that it has
been accepted by many scientists who still look askance at psychic
phenomena. Indeed it is used in very many arguments as being in
some vague way an explanation of those phenomena. But in itself
it constitutes a complete departure from the materialism of the Victor-
ian era. If it be indeed possible for mind to affect mind at a distance,
then clearly the functions of matter are not so circumscribed as we
had imagined. I cannot easily forget my own surprise when I found
by experiment that I could induce a person sitting with his back
turned to me to draw the same simple diagram which I drew my-
self. I could not reconcile it with the purely materialistic views
which I then held, and I can see as I look back that it was indeed my
first step into the unknown. If two incarnate minds, without a vis-
ible material connection, can impress each other, then admitting that
personality exists after death, it would not seem so utterly unthink-
able that a discarnate mind might also have the same power. If this
be granted, then we vaguely see a rationale lying behind automatic
writing, trance-talking and other psychic phenomena.
The second nexus which science is building up with psychic phe-
nomena lies in the explorations of ectoplasm, which have been largely
conducted by scientific observers who were not spiritualists, and who
had no preconceptions and no emotional element in their search for
truth. It is not within the scope of such a paper as this to detail what
the observations and conclusions have been of such men as Charles
Richet (who coined the word 'ectoplasm' ) ,
Dr. von Schrenck-Notz-
ing, Dr. Geley, Professor Crawford and other observers, of whom
Madame Bisson is not the least competent. They have among them
fully and finally established the existence of this extraordinary sub-
stance, which exactly corresponds to the plastic material evolved
from vapour, continually described by the early spiritualists as
being the physical basis of their phenomenal seances. If any one
doubts that its existence has been clearly established, let me remind
him that three years ago Dr. Schrenk-Notzing demonstrated ecto-
plasm to one hundred picked observers, which included Professors
of Jena, Giessen, Heidelberg, Munich, Tubingen, Upsala, Freiburg,
Basle and other universities, together with a concourse of famous
physicians, neurologists and savants of every sort. This assembly en-
dorsed the fact that they had seen beyond doubt final proofs of the
existence of ectoplasm. So also Dr. Geley gave a demonstration in

scurantism to pretend that such results can be ignored, and though
they still leave much to be explained they do, so far as they go, afford
a common ground where the man of science and the spiritualist can
meet. It should be remarked that among other points which in-
vestigation has established, there is none more certain than that ecto-
plasm, this half-psychic, half-material product, is dissipated and de-
stroyed by the actinic rays. This completely explains and justifies
the procedure of the spiritualists in holding their seances in the dark,

wiser to insist upon red light which is the luminant most easily borne
by this sensitive substance.
What is needed now is a clear definition and consolidation of that
which we know, so that we may have a firm base from which
to begin our explorations into the unknown. At present every
fresh investigator seems to start on the assumption that there has been
no investigator before him, and so the alphabet has to be learned over
again. No man has a right to be a member of any Committee of In-
vestigation upon so profound a subject until he has put in at least
a year of study and a course of reading which should include Craw-
ford's three books of his researches, Richet's "Thirty Years of Psychic
Investigation", Myers' "Human Personality", Schrenck-Notzing's
volume on materialization, and Sir William Crookes' "Researches".

that it is as absurd to approach it de novo as it would be for a tyro

useful and necessary, to be a sort of super-materialism which may

DEAR SIR:
Professor Jastrow is credited in the papers with two assertions about my
views which are inaccurate. The one is that I have shown photographs
(psychic) which were not genuine. This is entirely untrue. Of all the
photographs I have shown (hundreds in number) the only one I ever
showed which was questioned was one I showed with reservations at the
time once in New York. Dr. Prince assured me that it was not reliable and
as it was from an American source I took his word and withdrew it. I
challenge Professor Jastrow to mention any other photograph of mine
which has not held its own.
As to his story that the fairy photographs of Cottingley were taken from
a magazine what he must mean is that they were reproduced in a magazine.
Otherwise his statement has no sense at all. The photographs have met all
criticism, the honesty of the young girls has been vindicated, and every ex-
pert who has examined the negatives has testified to their reality. It is Dr.
Jastrow who shows extraordinary credulity in accepting such stories. As
to his attack on Richet well!

THE PRAGMATIST IN PSYCHIC RESEARCH
BY FREDERICK BLIGH BOND
Every man commencing a specialised line of research must adopt
a working hypothesis however simple as a guide to his experimental
work. He must inevitably begin by laying down certain postulates,
derived either from observation or from intuitive recognition. They
may be matters of personal faith. But they must be such as will
best cover the facts as he knows them. The working hypothesis he
must be ready to alter and extend as his facts accumulate, or even
to discard altogether if needed, without regard for his preferences.
He must seek positive conclusions and beware of building upon any
other. He must never generalise from negative results. At all
stages he must be fortified by fact. An ounce of fact is worth a ton
of theory; the establishing of one indubitable case of an affirmative
nature will, in theory, eliminate all negative conclusions. But in
practice the superior value of cumulative evidence must always be
borne in mind.
Pragmatism has been defined as a school of philosophic thought
which emphasizes practical consequences as tests for determining
truth of philosophic conceptions. It claims that all thought is
purposive and personal and that no knowledge is determined exclu-
sively by abstract considerations. This philosophy is connected with
Religion as justifying the will to Believe. Humanism is defined
as the application of the pragmatic method to all the sciences.*
I propose to give a succinct account of those experiments in
psychic research which have spread over the past nineteen years and
have happily enabled me to construct a working hypothesis which
seems to cover all the facts. I have applied the pragmatic method
to demonstrate the permanence and indestructibility of Mind,
Memory, and Personality or Character, together with the inde-
pendence of Mind and its direct action upon Matter. From my
experiments I have deduced a philosophy which differs only from

to demonstrate the permanence and indestructibility of Mind,

•Stokes, Eocycl. 1914 ed.
26 FREDERICK BLIGH BOND
the tenets of the Pragmatists as above defined in that I find that
all Thought is not personal in the individual sense, but may be
collective; and that this collective Thought is the vehicle of a more
comprehensive Intelligence responsive to the sympathetic action of
the group of lesser unitary intelligences which function collectively
as its vehicle.
This hypothesis admits of the perfect co-ordination of individual
minds and wills acting in attunement, to the control of super-mind.
It gives a new and wider meaning to the phrase esprit de corps.
Human organizations for various ends, religious, social, political, if
functioning with harmony of aim and method, are apt to generate
an intrinsic over-ruling spirit which is stronger by far than the
reflection of itself in its individual units. Yet in proportion as the
component individuals bend their will and mentality to the Purpose
of the organization, so do they not only vivify the Spirit of the Group,
or Genius of that organization, but they receive each one a charac-
teristic reinforcement without the loss of their own proper per-
sonality but rather with gain thereto.
It is but the law of individual man's complex personality acting
through a more extended order of being. The monadic theory of
Leibnitz, which affirms a complex structure for the mind or per-
sonality of the individual, has its analogies everywhere in Nature
from the chemical atom to the stellar nucleus, and, in human
society, from the family up through more complex grades of associa-
tion to the State, the Church, or the Nation. So may it well be
with the personality of the individual. In that personality are
elements of countless multitude and variety, racial, ancestral, per-
sonal also. Yet these are not to be regarded as necessarily his or
her exclusive and inalienable possession. Some are loosely welded;
some are not harmonious with others. There may indeed be sharp
antagonism between them. In thinking otherwise as if these ele-
ments were a true or permanent unit of individual being lies the
great heresy of the "subconscious mind" as popularly or vulgarly
conceived. Let us extend the idea of multiple personality as shown
in abnormal states of dissociation as in the succession of diverse
moods in the individual and we get a view of the possibilities of
change in grouping and in the development of character in an evolu-
tionary sense which no other hypothesis seems to account for so
rationally as does that which Leibnitz advanced.

The impress of a strong personality upon others in his environ-
THE PRAGMATIST IN PSYCHIC RESEARCH 27
ment can be well understood in the light of a sympathetic sharing
of certain monadic constituents in the galaxy of each.
The nature of spiritualistic "guides" and "controls" is readily ac-
counted for if we regard them as subconsciously members of the
group outlying members it may be which is controlled primarily
by the normal waking intelligence and will of the subject. That is
to say, there is some link of mental, moral, or emotional sympathy
subsisting between the subject and the controlling entity which is
able to declare itself through the passive medium of the subliminal
vehicle of association.
The way in which these remoter personal elements manifest them-
selves may be not inaptly compared to the radiations of human
speech and music which after almost infinite attenuation may be
picked up anywhere by a properly constituted receiver and again
reinforced until their original power and character of tone is repro-
duced and actually amplified.
In Boston at Christmas I heard, loud and clear, across the whole
breadth of the public gardens, a well known hymn beautifully played
as I thought by a band on the further side. I was astonished to
learn on the Monday that the band was playing some hundreds of
miles away. The power of the original vibrations was multiplied
fourfold in its penetrative quality, and without loss of delicacy or
any essential quality or clearness.
It is not tenable then that through the all-enfolding vehicle of
subliminal Mind and Memory there may come to our individual
minds whispers from across the void which stretches between the
moment of attention that we call the Present and that greater field
of thought and experience which we term the Past? Can we not
imagine how these tenuous links may be revived and amplified in
their turn until the link becomes vivid and vital with the colours
of reality?
The phenomena of telepathy, clairvoyance, psychometry, and the
myriad other modes of communication will fall into their place as
manifestations of that radiant activity of Mind which is ever im-
pinging upon the structure of the brain and leaving its impress in
the stimulation of creative Idea which, when once awakened in one
mind, may be imparted to others capable of a kindred vibratory
response.
If A and B are separate and discrete personalities, self-contained
and mutually exclusive, it is impossible to conceive the nature of the

If A and B are separate and discrete personalities, self-contained
and mutually exclusive, it is impossible to conceive the nature of the
28 FREDERICK BLIGH BOND
process by which Thought and Will are transferred from the one
to the other across that barrier which, it is assumed, divides the two
Egos. But if A and B are regarded as responsible heads of two
complex organizations within each of which are members common
to both and in sympathy with the policy and purpose of each, then
we have a foundation in thought on which we can bridge the gulf
of Personality.
Every individual who controls his psychic organization has a radi-
ating influence and may attract to himself by sympathetic thought
other monadic entities through the reinforcement of common sublimi-
nal elements of thought; just as the chemical atom may take up an
extra ion or ions and harmonize their activities with those of its own
group, changing its nature and general reactions through this acces-
sion. In like manner, we as personalities, makers of our souls, are
in spiritual flux, absorbing parts of the personality of others and
assimilating these with our own, thus tending to bring nearer to
realization in ourselves the symmetrical fulfilment of an archetypal
design of which our present personalities are but the merest outlines,
sketches, crude and inchoate.
We now obtain a glimpse of a more intelligible foundation on
which to build our ideas of that mysterious entity the subliminal
mind, which has been so fruitful a source of misconception by hasty
and shallow thinkers. There is still a tendency on the part of new
recruits to psychical research to adopt this term as explanatory of
all the obscure phenomena of a mental order in the various phases of
mediumship. With these and also in the case of others who should
know better, this hypothetical formula, which explains nothing and
may mean anything, is held sufficient to elucidate all. It needs no
discussion as it is in itself held to be an answer to all argument.
From a mere formal hypothesis it has come to assume the authority

be recalled later automatically or in a hypnotic or semi-hypnotic

process by which Thought and Will are transferred from the one
to the other across that barrier which, it is assumed, divides the two
Egos. But if A and B are regarded as responsible heads of two
complex organizations within each of which are members common
to both and in sympathy with the policy and purpose of each, then
we have a foundation in thought on which we can bridge the gulf
of Personality.
Every individual who controls his psychic organization has a radi-
ating influence and may attract to himself by sympathetic thought
other monadic entities through the reinforcement of common sublimi-
nal elements of thought; just as the chemical atom may take up an
extra ion or ions and harmonize their activities with those of its own
group, chan_ging its nature and general reactions through this acces-
sion. In like manner, we as personalities, makers of our souls, are
in spiritual flux, absorbing parts of the personality of others and
assimilating these with our own, thus tending to bring nearer to
realization in ourselves the symmetrical fulfilment of an archetypal
design of which our present personalities are but the merest outlines,
sketches, crude and inchoate.
We now obtain a glimpse of a more intelligible foundation on
which to build our ideas of that mysterious entity the subliminal
mind> which has been so fruitful a source of misconception by hasty
and shallow thinkers. There is still a tendency on the part of new·
recruits to psychical research to adopt this term as explanatory of
all the obscure phenomena of a mental order in the various phases of
mediumship. With these and also in the case of others who should
know better, this hypothetical formula, which explains nothing and
may mean anything, is held sufficient to elucidate all. It needs no
discussion as it is in itself held to be an answer to all argument.
From a mere formal hypothesis it has come to assume the authority
of a dogma or article of faith.

by the theory of latent impressions.
THE SPIRITIST HYPOTHESIS
The hypothesis which attributes all psychical phenomena to the
action of "spirits" that is to say, to discarnate human souls, is one
which may legitimately be held by the scientific enquirer so far as
it covers the facts observed. But it is open to certain objections,
and although men of science will admit it as a working hypothesis
they will continue to view it critically and will refuse to build
upon it conclusions which outrun the evidence. Preference and
prejudice must be equally set aside for in this enquiry there is room
for neither. It is unfortunate that the spiritualist question has
been disfigured by both. The subject must be handled dispassion-
ately and without emotion, though from its very nature this may be
far more difficult than in other branches of philosophical enquiry.
Why, we may ask, is it that men of standing in psychical or
metapsychical learning will generally prefer any other theory to
the spiritualistic? Perhaps Mr. Stanley de Brath is right in saying
"It is an indolent hypothesis: it explains everything in advance, rules
and exceptions alike . . . We need a hypothesis less falsified by
moral considerations, by anxiety as to good and evil and by the
needs of the heart." So far as this judgment implies that the inves-
tigator does not trust himself to discriminate between scientific values
on the one hand and moral or emotional values on the other, it
may be remarked that this implies no intrinsic objection to the
spiritualist hypothesis as such. From the pragmatist point of view,
the fact that the spiritualist theory should prove agreeable to the
moral judgment and should satisfy the needs of the heart would
be points in its favour.
But the spiritualist is always under suspicion from the man of
science as using his hypothesis not as a working hypothesis merely
but as a creed or faith, and without discrimination or exercise of the
critical intellectual faculty. This repels the scientific mind and
makes the qualified investigator shy of the approach. Also it must
be borne in mind that for many of the phenomena of the seance-
room there is no need to affirm the action of any "spirit" even
allowing the use of this questionable term where the activities of the
"soul" are more obviously manifest. There is perpetual confusion
here.

For some phenomena the animistic theory will cover the facts.
For example, proofs of the presence of a psychic force capable of
producing abnormal physical effects are no evidence of the survival
or immortality of the soul, still less of the presence of "spirit."
For others again the activity of a living human agent affords an
explanation. To give an instance from my own experience :
During
a recent sitting for automatic writing in America the name of a
person known to me, living in England, was written by the hand of
the medium, with a number of humorous remarks relating to affairs
in his native town in which I would be interested. The person in
question was not in my thought at the time and his name was at
first misspelled, but on identification of the surname, the whole
signature was correctly written out in a form not unlike his own
handwriting. Here the assumption is that the agent was asleep
(it would have been about 3 a. m. in England) and was dreaming
of me. He had wished early last year to take a trip to America
and had told me of this.
To proclaim the "spiritualistic" doctrine in the indiscriminate way
that some of the leaders of the movement do is but to create disgust
in the minds of rational enquirers. The spiritualists moreover con-
fuse purely psychical experience with spiritual values. Facts seem-
ing to confirm the hypothesis are welcomed. Those of an incon-
venient nature are blinked. The critical judgment is suspended and
the needs of the heart become the sole warrant for the validity of
their faith. The belief in "survival" is lauded as a religion and a
"New Revelation" is found in the phenomena of the seance-room.
On the tree of Spiritualism, says Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, all re-
ligions are grafted. Christianity itself is but one branch of that
tree.
If this be so, the pragmatist will demand a proof of the presence
of real spiritual values. Those of Christianity are recognized. They
work out in daily life when rightly interpreted and practiced.
Will spiritualism show fruits equal to these? Here the pragmatist
comes in and says: "If your doctrine and practice make definitely for
the mental and spiritual betterment of the race, and are acceptable
equally to the intellectual and the moral judgment, then your theory
confirms itself."
Unfortunately in some cases the spiritualist view and practice
seem to deprive its adherents of self-reliance and render them too
readily amenable to advice from the "spirits." It is also an easy

paregoric. The habit of intercourse on a commonplace and material
level whilst dulling the sorrow of separation deprives life of some
of its deepest emotional values, and by repetition, leaves the devotee
of this form of intercourse less capable of true spiritual growth and
effort. A. C. Benson has said, "The sorrow of earth would not be
sorrow it would have no cleansing power if the parted spirit
could return at once . . . To meet loss and sorrow upon earth with-
out either comfort or hope is one of the finest of lessons ... It
is in the silence of death that its virtue lies."
To the habitual seeker after the dead, the capacity for poignant
emotion is reduced to the level of the commonplace. He is on the
path of that false consolation which is the comfort of the drug-taker.
A PHILOSOPHIC SCHEME OF THE "SUBLIMINAL"
I submit a brief outline of the philosophy which has emerged
from my experience. The framing of the scheme has been assisted
by many valuable hints given in automatic script during the years
1918-20. Practical experiment interweaves with the teaching and
gives it substantial value. Certain principles have had to be pos-
tulated. These include a recognition of a tripartite constitution in
Man :
( 1 ) his essential part the spirit linked with the causal
Mind and Will; (2) the body and its vital forces; (3) the soul,
a complex entity developed by spirit in its reactions upon the material
part and variable in quantity and quality alike, controlled on the
one hand by the spiritual monad and on the other hand exercising
control over the body and its forces.
It is also postulated that the spiritual creative power which is
God eternally seeks more perfect self-expression through His units
and that He is in process of accomplishing this through increas-
ing differentiation of those units and the gradual perfecting of ex-
perience in each one according to their individual modes, the highest
mode known to us being the evolution of Character or Personality
in the higher and more permanent sense.
I have found in the script the following classification of Energy
which seems illuminating. I have added it to the working scheme.
The Field of Evolution is the objective and subjective Universe
alike. The agencies involved are three in number, viz:
(a). The Energy of Matter which is called the "Will of Mat-
ter" and which, by its resistance, provides the fulcrum for all the
evolutionary effort of creative Will. This Energy has a spiritual

origin and although set in opposition, it will ultimately yield to the
control of Mind and Spirit.
(b). The Energy of Life, which is psychic in its nature and is
neither purely spiritual nor yet material in its quality, but has
affinity with both these forms of energy. Life is not an entity but
an impersonal principle.
(c). The Energy of Will, Mind, and Purpose, which is always
an Entity. Mind is a function of Spirit, and is the vehicle of
Creative Idea. Individual Man is the agent for the acquisition of
progressive control over the agencies of Life and Matter; but there
are higher agencies in Collective Mind which are in process of co-
ordination and are becoming increasingly potent.
THE SOUL
It is by the evolution of this third part of Man's being through
the interaction of the spiritual and material parts that the process
of subjugation of Matter and Material Energies is brought about,
for the perfect self-expression of Spirit. This Soul is complex in
nature and variable in quality and quantity alike: It may be in-
tegrated with its spiritual Original, creating true Personality; or it
may be disintegrated in part, forming false personality which may
either be redeemed from extinction by becoming co-ordinated with
another spiritual nucleus, or may be re-absorbed and dissolved into
its constituent elements. The creative scheme knows no waste.
Souls grow by accretion as well as by evolution of powers. They
can be welded by co-ordination into companies or communions
which, in their turn, become the vehicles for the activities of higher
entities whose will and wisdom is collective and yet individual.
OBJECTIVE MATTER
We are to regard Matter in its objective aspect as superficies
only; a mere boundary or Plane of Resistance between two coun-
teracting forces of Will. The first product of the operation of this
conflict of Will in the living organism of Man is the development
of the Animal Soul.
We now reach the point at which the general hypothesis can be
stated in advance of the record of experiment.

witnessed in primitive peoples. In the higher-developed man they
are submerged, but survive in a subconscious form. This Animal

THE PRAGMATIST IN PSYCHIC RESEARCH 33
Soul, or primitive psychic nature is but little individualised, and has
more the quality of a group-soul, instinctive in its action.
(2). The second evolutionary product of the Causal Will in
man is the Material Intellect. This makes for the sharp differentia-
tion of individuals through contest. For a long while this intel-
lectual principle is dominant in Man and under its sway the original
psychic element becomes submerged, and is the subconscious recipient
of all impressions derived from the intellectual life.
(3). The Subconscious Entity is not strictly personal, being
essentially continuous with the whole psychic life of the Race and
of Nature. It subsists in Man as an individual focus of that wider
psychic life and is susceptible of impressions derived from that life
that is to say, from sources other than the personal intellect of the
subject. The thought and emotion of the Race affect it constantly
through sympathetic reaction and response.
THE SUBCONSCIOUS AS A CONNECTIVE MEDIUM
Man as an intellectual personality with a subliminal psychic stra-
tum involved deeply in his being, is thus necessarily linked with all
other intelligent personalities through the "continuum" of the sub-
conscious Mind and it is only through this medium that he can
obtain genuine recognition of any personality other than his own.
Intellect has evolved a series of external symbols of recognition
such as Language, Gesture, and other sensory modes of communica-
tion, but these convey no sense of reality except in so far as they
can be recognized as genuine symbols of what they purport to rep-
resent. The concept of Reality in the contact of personalities is
attained only through the subconscious region as the sole channel of
spiritual awareness. In the external contacts alone resides no in-
herent sense of reality. This is the experience of those in whom the
interior sense has for a time been closed and also of those in whom
the interior sensibility is weak or undeveloped. In such it has led to
the "solipsist" fallacy, and in a few circumstances, to a "logical"
insanity.
(4). Material Intellect is now sufficiently evolved in its own
domain to allow of a stimulating reaction towards the subconscious
and a strengthening of the link between separated personalities by
means of a reawakening of the latent psychic nature and its gradual
elevation towards a union with the intellectual consciousness. This
process is seen as a natural development in certain persons, and

it is marked by the dawning of a psychic consciousness and by the
emergence of the link between their own true personality and that
of others whose character or experience may bring them into sym-
pathetic relation with their own.
(5). In such individuals, the growth in strength and in scope
of the activities of their subconscious Entity, and its increase in
definiteness and power of direction through the association with the
Intelligent principle, begins to enable them to act through their sub-
conscious region in a wider environment. Their mental and psychi-
cal activities are no longer limited to the physical body, but are
capable of extension for a greater or lesser distance therefrom, both
in a temporal and a spatial sense. It follows that with such persons
the control of the psychic elements in their being is making for a
greater mastery of their environment. The psychic entity is becom-
ing plastic to the conscious Will.
(6). As the psychic Entity becomes more obedient and responsive
it will also be more plastic to influences arising from other sources.
In the absence of control or direction on the part of the normal or
waking intelligence, it may be amenable to direction or control by
any other personality which, through mental or emotional sympathy,
may be nearly in relation to the subject influenced. Thus another
mind may acquire temporary control and may speak or act through
the psychic and physical organism by virtue of the common sub-
conscious elements which form the sympathetic link.
(7). The power which enables one personality to manifest his
presence by speech, writing, or otherwise through the subconscious
being of another is dependent upon the degree of mental, emotional,
or volitional sympathy which may subsist between them. In this
respect the subliminal entity may be compared to the aerial of a
wireless installation, and the physical side of the phenomenon will
depend upon the right adjustment or attunement, and the due pas-
sivity of the brain and body of the medium or "subject."

and of voluntary recognition. The Memory of a Personality, if
sufficiently strong, is therefore an actual approach to the points of
contact with that personality; and such approach may become the
basis of a new mutual experience and association.
(10). The nexus or link between two or more separate per-
sonalities is effected through the subconscious psychic region, but the
recognition is in itself an act of Spirit of the higher Mind in the
aspect of Consciousness of Reality or of Underlying Unity. The
law of communion is Sympathetic Action and Reaction of Mind
with Mind, Memory with Memory, and Character with Character.
THE TREND OF THE NEW CO-ORDINATION
The Science of the future is Psychic Science or the Science of the
Soul. It may be defined as the exploration of the subliminal re-
gions of Man's being in the light of his spiritual Reason, the Intel-
lectual power illuminated by intuition. Its work is the harmonising
arid control of the powers and faculties of this part of his being
by the dominant Reason and Intelligence. The task of its students
will be to acquire conscious control of this region, to understand its
laws, and to lay hold of the immense privileges it offers in an evolu-
tionary sense. The promise is that our evolution as a community
on earth will by this means be directed in a course controlled by a
new co-ordinating power derived from the intuitive recognition of
all that the Past can teach. The dynamic power of Thought and its
yet undeveloped capacity for directly influencing Matter through the
psychic channels of control will be a part of this task.
The need for the co-ordination of the psychic part of man with
the intellectual is pressing. Only by the opening of the channels of
Intuitive Wisdom the realization of the higher and collective
Knowledge which is the fruit of the racial experience can the mass
of present-day learning be unified, clarified, and built into a sym-
metric structure leading to further constructive achievement. The
gifts of Higher Intelligence, Genius, Inspiration, the assimilated
Wisdom of the ages spiritually directed, can alone stabilize the
fabric of our terrestrial knowledge and build our civilization that-is-
to-be upon a permanent basis.
Underlying all must come the recognition of the spiritual Unity
of Mankind. This recognition of Spiritual Unity, embodied in

and of voluntary recognition. The Memory of a Personality, if
sufficiently strong, is therefore an actual approach to the points of
contact with that personality ; and such approach may become the
basis of a new mutual experience and association.
(l 0). The nexus or link between two or more separate per-
sonalities is effected through the subconscious psychic region, but the
recognition is in itself an act of Spirit-of the higher Mind in the
aspect of Consciousness of Reality or of Underlying Unity. The
law of communion is Sympathetic Action and Reaction of Mind
with Mind, Memory with Memory, and Character with Character.
THE TREND OF THE NEw Co-oRDINATION
The Science of the future is Psychic Science or the Science of the
Soul. It may be defined as the exploration of the subliminal re-
gions of Man's being in the light of his spiritual Reason, the Intel-
lectual power illuminated by intuition. Its work is the harmonising
apd control of the powers and faculties of this part of his being
by the dominant Reason and Intelligence. The task of its students
will be to acquire conscious control of this region, to understand its
laws, and to lay hold of the immense privileges it offers in an evolu-
tionary sense. The promise is that our evolution as a community
on earth will by this means be directed in a course controlled by a
new co-ordinating power derived from the intuitive recognition of
all that the Past can teach. The dynamic power of Thought and its
yet undeveloped capacity for directly influencing Matter through the
psychic channels of control will be a part of this task.
The need for the co-ordination of the psychic part of man with
the intellectual is pressing. Only by the opening of the channels of
Intuitive Wisdom-the realization of the higher and collective
Knowledge which is the fruit of the racial experience-can the mass
of present-day learning be unified, clarified, and built into a sym-
metric structure leading to further constructive achievement. The
gifts of Higher Intelligence,-Genius, Inspiration, the assimilated
Wisdom of the ages spiritually directed, can alone stabilize the
fabric of our terrestrial knowledge and build our civilization that-is-
to-be upon a permanent basis..
Underlying all must come the recognition of the spiritual Unity
of Mankind. This recognition of Spiritual Unity, embodied in
our philosophy of the Subconscious or Subliminal, and in our future
Science of the Soul, decrees a humanistic foundation for all effort
36 FREDERICK BLIGH BOND
and a constructive purpose which will inevitably ally itself more and
more consciously with the evolutionary Plan of the Parent Mind.
Broadly speaking, therefore, I have arrived at the conclusion that
the Subconscious part of us is personal only in a limited sense;* that
it is more largely racial and ancestral; and that it is the field of in-
numerable contacts with Mind and Personality other than our own ;
these personalities impressing us through the subconscious by sym-
pathetic mental or emotional action.
In this sense, which is that of a channel, it may be said that the
subconscious strata of our being contain the germs of all per-
sonality, all human experience, the accumulated record of man's
thought and work throughout the aeon of his racial life and develop-
ment, and that any one of these clues may be strengthened or 'drawn
home' by sympathetic action. It is a somewhat startling conclusion
but it covers, I find, all the phenomena of mental life and psychic
activities including those of the order known commonly as spiritual-
istic.
Further, the science of the future must, according to this view,
take up the task of the Integration of the Subconscious with the In-
tellectual and this is the Building of the Soul.
One corollary of the view here advanced is that the sympathetic
union and collective activity of Mind and Mind would be present in
a far greater degree among those personalities who are no longer
trammelled by the isolating influence of the physical organism, and
the limitations of sensory and brain perception. In other words,
Death of the body would imply increased freedom of association
between the minds of those whose thought is in sympathetic accord.
Hence we should except a collective voice and a collective memory as
being characteristic of any communications from minds in the liberated
spheres of human consciousness beyond bodily death. This is but
an affirmation of what the Church has always implied in her doctrine
of the Communion of the Saints, the Church Invisible, the great
Cloud of Witnesses.

problem of the survival and persistence of Mind, Memory and Per-
sonality. One is through the objective phenomena of Psychism, mis-

THE PRAGMATIC TEST
There are two methods of approach towards a solution of the
problem of the survival and persistence of Mind, Memory and Per-
sonality. One is through the objective phenomena of Psychism, mis-
•Chiefly as the storehouse of all impressions derived from the waking
experience.
THE PRAGMATIST IN PSYCHIC RESEARCH 37
called Spiritualism; into which class fall all those experiences which
recall the external symbols or tokens of deceased earth-personality.
Spiritual values may and do accompany these phenomena but in them-
selves they do not belong to that category.
The other approach is by means of the subjective phenomena of
Mind and here we seek proof of the indestructibility of Mind by an
appeal to those interior links of which I have spoken. The question
then arises: What kind of proof shall we seek as being satisfactory
and conclusive?
The phenomena fall into several classes. There is first the broad
basis of Telepathy or Thought-transference on which we can build
as a foundation. But this, although it shows the action of Mind on
Mind as apart from the physical organism, does not so clearly suggest
that Mind can act after the body is dead and the brain-organism
dissolved.
Next there is a large range of phenomena connected with what
has been known as Psychometry the faculty of reading impressions
derived from objects. These impressions are sometimes very vivid
and portray visually certain scenes and events in the history and as-
sociations of the object in question. They seem to demonstrate that
every object made or handled by man does in some way unknown to
us retain the impress of his personality and that however faint this
impress may be, it can be evoked and amplified to an indefinite ex-
tent, just as the much attenuated etheric radiations may be caught,
recorded and amplified until the original strength and volume of the
voice that generated them is reproduced.
A theory has been put forward under the title Metagnomy, for
the explanation of this. The word simply implies an extended faculty
of knowledge and thus in itself explains nothing, being only a formula.
But if through the channel of the subconscious mind, the impress
of personality inherent in the lifeless object becomes attuned to the
thought of the original personality which generated this impress, then
the delicate recording instrument of the psychic sensitive may register
and amplify its vibrations with the result that a memory of the past
is brought into living contact with the present ;
the original personality
being recalled into its first association with the object.
A third class of mental phenomena is found in the records of clair-
audience, clairvoyance and inspirational writing and drawing. One
order of the writing in this class is involuntary and unconsciously
produced. The evidence for the survival of Mind, Memory, and

Personality offered by such phenomena as these would be conclusive
only if the information or knowledge conveyed by their means proved
to be
(a) Not within the memory or experience of any living person.
(b) Not accessible in any printed or written work.
(c) Exactly verifiable from some source outside living knowledge,
(e. g. by excavation.)
This is the character of the proof sought by me of the operation
of discarnate Mind and Memory. With these, the element of Per-
sonality always consistently associates itself and cannot be dissected
from them. In the written communications collected by me since
1908 the constant claim is made that Thought persists and Memory
also in proportion as the mental sympathies of those who speak are
still bound by the ancient ties of earth-memory : and that it is entirely
through our own sympathetic thought that they are re-evoked and
recalled in their old-time vividness.
SPECIFICATION OF TESTS REQUIRED UNDER HEAD (c).
It is obvious that the mere fact that knowledge supernormally con-
veyed is not within living memory or accessible in documentary form,
cannot be of the smallest utility in proving the survival of Mind and
Memory, since it is in its nature incapable of verification. Therefore
any proofs coming only under heads (a) and (b) are discarded as
evidence.
There remain a small group of tests which will satisfy all three
conditions. These I make as follows: others may suggest possible
additions to the list.
(1) Proof from Burled Antiquities. In such cases the material
witness of the knowledge supernormally given is revealed
by excavation (anacalypsis).
(2) Proof by Fulfilment. As of predictions of coming events.
(3) Proof by Translation of Unknown Tongues. When a pas-
sage from an unknown language, living or dead, is given su-
pernormally together with a translation of the same after-
wards verified as accurate.
If incontestable evidence of either or all of the above three species
of proof be offered, it is difficult to see how the conclusion can be
avoided that it is the work of some independent mentality possessing
conscious knowledge extending beyond the human sphere, and its tem-
poral and spatial limitations.

PROOF FROM BURIED ANTIQUITIES
In 1907 I, as an ecclesiastical architect and antiquary, took up the
study of the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, the site of the traditional
first Christian mission to Britain in apostolic times. Such a site
might be deemed most promising for the locus of a psychical enquiry
since it has a vivid and inspiring record of some 1500 years of
religious history and tradition from the first to the sixteenth century.
For a year or so, until November 1907, I had stored my mind with
details of the architectural history by the study of documents available
and the views of learned antiquaries. The story of the ruins as given
in the all too scanty remnants was the object of my care.
With me was associated a friend (called in my book John Alleyne).
We had this interest in common and also an interest in psychic re-
search. I had for some time been a member of the London Society
and was desirous of contributing to its work. Mr. Alleyne had
told me that some time previously he had had a curious experience.
His right hand had been seized with a sort of cramp and he had felt
the urge to take a pencil. His hand then wrote spasmodically in
small characters on any available sheets of paper. The writing was
difficult to decipher but turned out to be a message or instruction of
interest to his family, and this was of a veridical nature, leading to
the identification of certain valuable papers.

house in Clifton, Bristol, reputed to be haunted, and obtained *a
curious story which I afterwards verified in four several particulars

base my ideas of the mental process at work. But the facts of tele-
pathy were well established and I believed that that the association
of two minds bent upon the same quest would ensure a reinforcement
of any power of memory-reading at work.
I considered that our reading and researches at Glastonbury might
have led to certain subconscious conclusions with regard to facts we
had noted but from which we had failed to educe any theory as to
the nature and position of missing portions of the Abbey fabric,
owing to the scanty amount of information in the records and the
contradictory nature of the views held by leading archaeologists over
the last half-century with regard to these.
I therefore proposed to attempt to gain information as to the lost
features of the Abbey by the use of this involuntary writing and I
suggested that I should give my friend the pencil and lay my own
hand over his during any writing that might come.
I wish here to state positively that the documents at our disposal
at this time and during the following period of excavation were only
those that had been equally accessible to all other students. I say
this because it has been falsely alleged that we were in possession of
a knowledge of documents not hitherto accessible, in which the
position and dimensions of these lost features of the Abbey were
given*.
The first passage written in this joint experiment was as follows.
It is the keynote of all that came after.
"All Knowledge is eternal and is available to mental sympathy".
This suggested the idea of a species of telepathic action between
minds of the living and some kind of storehouse or treasury of past
knowledge. I perceived that this might operate through some law of
sympathetic vibration akin to the harmonic laws which govern music
and other rhythmic activities. Thought might well be undulatory
and it would be a question only of mental attunement. This governed
my subsequent attitude.
From the first, a note of Personality came into the writing. The
communicating intelligence used the personal pronoun. He wrote:
"I was not in sympathy with monks. I cannot find a monk yet".
But he promptly found one for us. This suggested a highly or-

ganiscd knowledge classified in departments mutually connected but
widely diversified in sympathy.
There followed a rough drawing, showing, at the extreme east end
of the Abbey choir, a long rectangular building. A script in monkish
Latin followed which stated that this was the Chapel of King Edgar
and that it was thirty yards in length. The statement seemed out-
rageous at first, as the existence of any such chapel at this point had
been denied categorically in 1904 by Mr. Hope, Secretary of the
Society of Antiquaries of London (later Sir Wm. Hope), and his
decision, based as it was upon excavation made in that year, had been
regarded as final and conclusive.
Other antiquaries had different views as to the site of the Edgar
Chapel, for the existence of which we have or had then but one
authentic document, to wit, Leland's note, which said:
"Abbot Bere builded Edgar's Chapel at the east end of the church
and Abbot Whiting performed some part of it".
Professor Willis had considered this to mean the east end of the
choir and his plan shows an extension here of some fifteen feet for
the chapel in question. Others followed Mr. James Parker, who
marked the chapel as being in the south transept, to the east of the
crossing. He cites a good authority for his view. But our script
with its 90 foot extension is revolutionary and upsets them all.
My plan then was to refer back to documents already studied in
order to discover whether the script threw any light upon them. It
did so. There was one printed document which all had studied, and
all had in turn discarded as valueless. I had done the same. But
the script revealed a vital misinterpretation of the very obscure word-
ing of this document and in the light of the script its meaning became
clear.
Many more writings were obtained during the early months of
the year 1908 and the detailed dimensions of the two parts of the
chapel successively built by Abbots Bere and Whiting were given
together with descriptions of its form and architectural character.
Permission to excavate as Director on behalf of the Somerset
Archaelogical Society was accorded me in May 1908 and I com-
menced the work in June. During the summer the whole extent of

would have been greater, and we have nothing left of the super-
structure only the rough foundations being still in place.
On measuring the length of the rectangular chapel I found it to be
six inches short of seventy-two feet and on referring back to the
script produced in February and March 1908 I noted that this
dimension had been given for the part of the chapel laid down by
Abbot Richard Bere. No further extension however was visible in
the high bank of clay to the east of the excavation. I decided to seek
furthei in the following year, as the script indicated an eastward
extension with angular walls added by the last Abbot, Richard
Whiting. I drew a conjectural plan of such presumed addition and
published it in December, 1908, suggesting a polygonal apse. This
publication was made in three ways : in the form of a printed appeal
for funds; in the Christmas number of the 'Treasury' (a Church of
England magazine) ; and in the first Annual Report of my excava-
tions for the Somerset Society. The script was submitted to several
friends including Mr. Everard Feilding, then Secretary of the Society
for Psychical Research, but as it was not practicable to mix archaeolo-
gy with psychic enquiry, I withheld knowledge of the script from any
official document. Had I not done this, my term of excavation would
have ceased very shortly in view of the unready state of public opinion
and the feeling in the Church which was now the owner of the Abbey.
But I was able to construct a good argumentative case for the fur-
ther excavation I wished to make, and early in 1909 I explored the
ground to the east, finding to my great satisfaction the remains of
the two angular walls and the gap at the extreme east where the
script had specified that there was an opening in the wall. The foun-
dations were examined and duly reported on by my Committee and
the whole area of the walls of the chapel leveled and rendered per-
manently visible.
I again emphasize the fact that all through this time I was not in
possession of any documentary knowledge which had not been in
the hands of the older antiquaries. I would impress upon critics the
fact that sixty years of argument and debate, culminating in Mr.
Hope's negative finding, had not brought any elucidation of the
problem. But this was solved by recourse to involuntary writing
and without the smallest difficulty. Scarcely a spadeful of earth
was wasted in the process.
It was not until nearly two years after the discovery of the Edgar
Chapel that an XVIII century MS plan came to light in the lumber-

published it in December, 1908, suggesting a polygonal apse. This
publication was made in three ways: in the form of a printed appeal
for funds; in the Christmas number of the 'Treasury' (a Church of
England magazine) ; and in the first Annual Report of my excava-
tions for the Somerset Society. The script was submitted to several
friends including Mr. Everard Feilding, then Secretary of the Society
for Psychical Research, but as it was not practicable to mix archaeolo-
gy with psychic enquiry, I withheld knowledge of the script from any
official document. Had I not done this, my term of excavation would
have ceased very shortly in view of the unready state of public opinion
and the feeling in the Church which was now the owner of the Abbey.
But I was able to construct a good argumentative case for the fur-
ther excavation I wished to make, and early in 1909 I explored the
ground to the east, finding to my great satisfaction the remains of
the two angular walls and the gap at the extreme east where the
script had specified that there was an opening in the wall. The foun-
dations were examined and duly reported on by my Committee and
the whole area of the walls of the chapel leveled and rendered per-
manently visible.
I again emphasize the fact that all through this time I was not in
possession of any documentary knowledge which had not been in
the hands of the older antiquaries. I would impress upon critics the
fact that sixty years of argument and debate, culminating in Mr.
Hope's negative finding, had not brought any elucidation of the
problem. But this was solved by recourse to involuntary writing
and without the smallest difficulty. Scarcely a spadeful of earth
was wasted in the process.
It was not until nearly two years after the discovery of the Edgar
Chapel that an XVIII century MS plan came to light in the lumber-

room of an old Somerset family. This on examination showed a
small outline plan of the Abbey as it was, say, about the year 1770.
An extension with broken lines to the east was roughly indicated and
the parts numbered. On reference to the table, the number attached
to this part was found to be described as
"The Chapel of King Edgar's Chapel. 87 ft. long". The 87 feet
tallied with the 90 (as inside to outside measure.) This Plan, now
known as the 'Sale Plan,' has been acquired by the Somerset Society
and is now hung on their Museum walls.

There was another chapel whose site was lost. Here again the
only record was a note by Leland made about 1534. He said that
"Abbot Bere, coming from his embassy in Italy, built a Chapel of
Our Lady of Loretto, joining to the north side of the bodies of the
Church."
This was taken to mean that the chapel had been attached to the
north side of the nave ;
but for many generations it had been believed
that the surviving chapel in the north transept was the Loretto and
no one had troubled to dispute this. A note in Dugdale's Monasticon
seemed to confirm the idea.
In 1910 (Sept.) another old MS came to light. It is the diary
of a schoolmaster of the time of Geo. II. In it is a very rough sketch
of the ruins and a slight indication of ruined stonework on the north
side of the nave. Following an inspection of this MS I searched in
the year following along the line of the buried footings of the north
wall of the nave to see if I could find any sign of an attached build-
ing, of this nature. Finding none, I cut two short trenches into a
grass bank on the north side but discovered no traces of a wall and
there I left the matter.
After some further excavation in other directions in 1912 nothing
more was done for some years, as the war supervened in 1914. In
1916, finding myself among the unemployed professional class, I de-
cided to write up the story of the Edgar Chapel and its discovery in
1908 by aid of 'automatic* writing. I invited John Alleyne to sit
with me to see if we could get any further matter of interest, and he
agreed. The Loretto Chapel was not an object of enquiry, though
I must have had a subconscious wish that I had been able to locate
this, and I had still a feeling that it must have been somewhere on

the north side of the nave. But it was not uppermost in my thought.
Judge then of my surprise when my friend's hand wrote :
"You did not go far enough into the bank cast up there
"It was full five feet in..."
John Alleyne seemed totally unaware of the meaning of this
reference. But it soon became clear that it was actually the Loretto
Chapel that was being spoken of. I was told that Bere travelling
from Padua to Rome on his embassy from the King to the Pope had
been attacked by bandits. His mule slipped and he was falling down
a precipitous place, when he called on Our Lady to help him and lo!
his cloak caught on a thornbush and he was saved. Then he vowed
that on his return home he would build a votive chapel to Our Lady
of Loretto. This Chapel the script said was built in the Italian style,
being the first of the kind erected in England. It was drawn and
detailed for us. Its measures were given as being 40 feet by 20 or 21,
and the strange statement was made that it was not (as Leland's
description seemed to imply) actually attached to the nave wall on
the north, but as much as thirty-one and a half feet away from the
nave to the north.
This assurance, seeming as it did, to contradict the record of that
eminent and careful antiquary, Leland, was staggering. Nevertheless
I decided to publish all that was given, together with a plan showing
my interpretation of the script and I told the whole story in the
"Gate of Remembrance" which appeared first in the early days of
1918.
I was unable to take any steps towards verification until the late
summer of 1919 when the Trustees decided to allow excavation to
continue. But as soon as I received permission to dig, I sunk a shaft
into the bank five feet from the edge and came right upon a mass of
stonework which I had missed by only a short distance when I cut
into the soil in 1911.
During that season and the following (1919-1920) I was able to
open up almost the whole circuit of a building which appeared to
have been demolished to the very foundations. A small part of the
east end, being under a tree was left unexplored, but I had the key
of the measures and they indicated that the superstructure would
have been as nearly as possible 40 ft. by 20. The distance east of the
transept was claimed by the script to have been ten feet, by a covered
way (via claustra) between the two. I found the foundation of the
cloistral space. It ran alongside the transept wall and the little

chapel led out of it on the west. The width was as nearly as I could
estimate ten feet. But the most astonishing feature of the whole
affair was the discovery that the southern wall of the chapel was
indeed, as the script said, thirty-one and a half feet to the north
of the nave aisle. The memories in this case were singularly per-
fect and there is no document existing known to antiquaries which
could give the slightest indication of any of these details. The chapel
walls having been demolished down to the floor-line and all archi-
tectural detail swept away I was hard put to it to verify the state-
ment that the style was Italian. But the only, small fragment of an
architectural nature which I found was the pendant of a small niche-
canopy and this was distinctly of a Renaissance type. The script as-
serts that the carved fragments are thrown on a heap ten feet to the
north. It has so far been impossible to excavate there but I hope
some day to do so.
In this episode the choice of the subject was so entirely outside the
scope of my intention that I was impressed more fully than ever
of the presence of a directive and selective intelligence in the giving
of this story.

In 1921 I received script from two new sources. In neither case
did the writer or writers claim any knowledge of Glastonbury Abbey.
One was a lady living near Winchester, a devout Churchwoman who
had been a parish worker in her district for some years. She had
glanced at the 'Gate of Remembrance* and had been attracted by the
psychic side of the story. Shortly afterwards she began to get spon-
taneous writing. It purported to come from monks of Glastonbury
and Winchester Priory of the XII century, and was directed to me
as 'hym that seeketh'. I found soon that it was intelligently follow-
ing much that was in my thoughts in connection with the programme
of the 1921 excavations. I will give one notable instance of the
verification of this lady's script.
On the 27th August, 1921, she posted me a writing obtained on
the previous day. It alluded to the ancient wooden church which
occupied the site of the present Lady Chapel before the Great Fire
of 1184, and it said that the second Norman Abbot, Herlewin (a
name quite unfamiliar to her and of whose works very little is
known ) ,
built a protective stone wall around the wooden walls. She
got a plan in which this wall was shown in dotted lines, and it ran at

a slight slant from the walls of the older chapel, whose axis east and
west deviated apparently about two degrees of the compass from this
stone wall. Here is the passage from her script:

The existing Lady Chapel was built just after the fire in 1184.
No record of any stone-walled building or foundation of such building
of earlier date on this site has ever, so far as I am aware, been spoken
of at any time. No warrant then would have existed for the justifi-
cation of a request on my part for permission to dig here.
But within five days from the receipt of the script, the Dean of
Wells, Chairman of the Abbey Trustees, took an idea into his head
that the ground had risen rather high on the north side of the Lady
Chapel and that the public would get a better view of the plinth and
base-courses of the Chapel wall if he had it lowered in level. Accord-
ingly he, quite on his own initiative, took the Society's men from the
work that they were doing for me on the North Transept and started
them on the work of lowering the level of the soil on the north side
of the Chapel of St. Mary aforesaid. When I visited the ground on
the 1st September I found them busy. They had sunk the soil a few
feet in advance of the chapel wall and had already come across a
piece of masonry of unknown date and character. I told them to
follow this to the westward, and in the course of the next two days
they had traced the northern edge of this masonry some thirty feet
to the west and verified the existence of a broad stone footing wall

Austell, to my rooms on the evening of the 1st September (the day
I first saw the wall) and he initialled and attested the script as being
in my possession on that date. I pointed out to him the deviation of
the axis in the script plan, predicted that we might look for this when
the rest of the wall was opened. This was done, and on measuring
the distances of its edge from the chapel wall at both ends, the devia-

in the script had indicated between one and two degrees of the
compass. The whole story is told in the "Company of Avalon".

PROOF BY FULFILMENT
The same intelligent agency which would appear to have directed
the series of archaeological proofs, of which I have given these three
notable examples, seems also to have planned to make the testimony
more complete in other ways quite foreign to our thought. As early
as 1907 a passage would here and there be interjected in the current
of the script which would hint at coming changes, e. g.

On the 15th October, 1909 came, without warning or preface,

"Poverty, Hunger, and the War-lust in every land on which lieth

neighbours shall not be able, for Peace reigns no more. War with
their neighbours is better than war at home, and so the cause must
be made for quarrels".
"Then, when Europe is exhausted, the reign of Asia will com-

I would call attention to the repeated description of the War that
is to come, as 'The Day of the Poppies'. No more appropriate sym-
bol of that great event could have been chosen, as we all know The
Flanders Poppy is adopted throughout Great Britain as the symbol
of the sacrifice of her sons and each year, on Armistice Day it is worn
by all who celebrate that anniversary. The prognostication that the
whole of Christendom would be involved is also remarkable. It
indicates a profound understanding of the forces moving among the
Christian nationalities at the time and the high degree of probability
amounting to practical certainty that they would all be involved ; for
this was actually the case as the event proved.

Oct. 26, 1912.
"That which we spoke of, know we. The 'Poppies' cometh be-
fore the Day of Christ. Note what we have said.
"Poverty, Hunger, and the War-lust in every land on which lieth
the shadow of the Cross. They who would be at peace with their
neighbours shall not be able, for Peace reigns no more. War with
their neighbours is better than war at home, and so the cause must
be made for quarrels".
"Then, when Europe is exhausted, the reign of Asia will com-
mence, for there the sun is rising. So say we".
I would call attention to the repeated description of the War that
is to come, as 'The Day of the Poppies'. No more appropriate sym-
bol of that great event could have been chosen, as we all know The
Flanders Poppy is adopted throughout Great Britain as the symbol
of the sacrifice of her sons and each year, on Armistice Day it is worn
by all who celebrate that anniversary. The prognostication that the
whole of Christendom would be involved is also remarkable. It
indicates a profound understanding of the forces moving among the
Christian nationalities at the time and the high degree of probability
amounting to practical certainty that they would all be involved; for
this was actually the case as the event proved.
50 FREDERICK BLIGH BOND
I must be content briefly to summarise the later group of pro-
phetic forecasts given in the script received during the actual war
period. These are detailed in 'The Hill of Vision*. One was given
just before Easter 1918 when the Allied cause seemed at its darkest.
I was not allowed to fall into any pessimistic state of mind. The
dissolution of the central European combination in the near future
was affirmed.
"Watch", said the script, "On Easter Day the tide will turn and
ebb swiftly and consistently".
On the Monday, April 1st, the London evening papers came out
with the headlines:
"The tide has turned".
The script of March 29th also said :
"The very elements will fight on the side of right".
The Daily Chronicle correspondent's letter published April 2nd
says :
"The luck of the weather has turned for about the first time
that I can call to mind and gone completely against the enemy".
I was warned that Germany would undertake a new offensive in
the spring, this movement being a necessity for her to save her from
stagnation. It would carry her over many of the fair fields of
France but would end in disaster. And on or about the 26th Aug.
she would realise that the game was lost and this would be the
'spiritual' end of the war, though fighting would drag on for some
time after.
All happened as foretold. The best military judges have fixed
the date 26th August as marking the end for Germany.
I quote from Reuter's despatch as appearing in American news-
papers :
ENEMY HAS SIMPLY DISINTEGRATED
DRAMATIC ERA BEGAN WITH STARTLING
SUDDENNESS
London, Aug. 26. 'We have entered the most dramatic era of the
war with such startling suddenness that it is difficult to realize the
full extent of its possibilities', says Reuter's correspondent at British
Headquarters in describing the situation Sunday. 'It is a staggering
fact that since yesterday morning the enemy has simply disintegrated
over a considerable zone'.
Thus the specific assurance given in the script in April was ful-
filled to the letter four months later.

THE PRAGMATIST IN PSYCHIC RESEARCH 51
A final instance is found in a script obtained by me with John
Alleyne at Gloucester on the 12th October, 1918. It is given in
Latin with some grammatical errors which I have ventured to amend
as they in no way affect the sense and purport of the message.
"Concilia sapientiae prevalebant. Bellum finitum est. Pax venit
in cancellis omnibus. Bene volentes in terra jamque scripserunt.
Venit ad crescentem lunae, pro gloria Dei. Magisterium bene solve-
bitur in anno D. 1919.
"Probatus rerum finitus est. Bene fecimus.
"Via nova operta est vobis. Benedicite".
This is followed by a jubilant passage in English:
"In the mists of the spiritual, where Matter mergeth into Spirit,
ye have traced the silver thread; which follow as a clue for the
great Mystery of the Infinite.
"Follow the clue. The gates are opening on a new Dispensation
wherein Vision shall take the place of Faith and the things which
have hitherto been unseen shall be open to the spiritual eyes of
Mankind".
"Behold, the Majesty of the Lord cometh and is even now in your
midst: and the Sun of Righteousness shall dispel the clouds which
cover the face of the earth and the waters".
"All is done. Glory be to God in Heaven. I, Imperator, have
spoken ; I, Imperator, here in your midst".
"Vale, atque vale, atque salve!"
The prophecy is that peace will come in the waxing of the moon.
The full moon in October, 1918 was on the 21st, nine days after
the receipt of the script. The full moon following was on the 19th
November (18d. 18hr. 16m.)
The Armistice was declared on the llth November (lid. llh.

PROOF FROM TRANSLATION OF UNKNOWN OR UNFAMILIAR TONGUES
Some of the scripts of the 'Glastonbury' series have been received
through other hands. A large number have come through the agency
of an American gentleman known as Philip Lloyd in the two pub-
lished sections of his work. These are printed as booklets under the
52 FREDERICK BLIGH BOND
title 'The Glastonbury Scripts, Nos. Ill, IV, and VII, but the larger
part is still unpublished.*
Philip Lloyd's interest in the work continences in 1921 after his
reading of 'The Gate of Remembrance'. He sits with a friend in
the same manner as I sat with John Alleyne; his friend holding the
pencil and he, placing his hand over the hand of the writer. The
writer has no knowledge of any foreign language. Philip Lloyd has
not studied Latin since his college days (about 1912). He cannot
now translate Latin nor can he memorise it. He has no acquaintance
whatever with Gaelic, Anglo-Saxon, or classic Persian yet these are
among the tongues which are represented in the writing he has ob-
tained automatically through the hand of his friend K. L.
In May, 1921, a great friend of his was travelling in Scotland and
was in lona at the time that a script was received. Philip Lloyd had
been thinking of this friend, and on the 27th May was led to read
a book on lona in which the English of a prophecy attributed to St.
Columba was given thus :
"In lona of my heart, in lona of my love
Instead of monks' voices shall be lowing of cows :
But ere the world shall come to an end,
lona shall be as it was".
K. L. the automatist, knew nothing of this book or its contents.
At 3 p. m. on the same day, May 27th, this passage having been read
at noon, the following came through K. L.'s hand in answer to his
question "Are you ready to speak?"
"Yea. First something that you know, in Gaelic"
"An I mo cridhe, I mo ghraidh,
An a ite guth mhanach bidh geum ba;
Ach mu'n tig saoghal gu crich,
Bithidh I mar bha".
This in no way enlightened him. But light came at once when
his friend's hand immediately wrote the English lines already quoted
and at the foot of the verses came the words :
"Thought of your friend in this sacred place your thought of him,
brings this that you know, through us".
The proper accents were placed on the letters in the Gaelic as he
was to find later, but he was at a loss to verify the Gaelic himself
and in the evening he went to a public library near which his rooms

were. Turning over all the books that he could find on the subject
he was led to choose one that had never been taken out of the library.
This was Treholme's "Story of lona". Hunting thro

the pages
he found at the end the same prophecy in Gaelic that had come to
him, the sole difference being an V in the last line.
I have secured the punctual attestation of this and all other script
that has come from this source and am able to say that owing to
Philip Lloyd's great care, the evidence is flawless from that point of
view. My sole regret is that so much of the best he has obtained is
of a private nature and cannot at least for the present be given to
the public. Occasionally beautiful verse is written and the literary
excellence of this and some of the prose gives it a certain warrant of
its own as proof of the superior nature of the Mind-element operating.
Here is an example. On May 23 Mr, Lloyd read aloud the mat-
ter on p. 53 of 'The Hill of Vision*. It alludes to the end of the era
of war between the nations. Immediately the pencil moves and
writes :
"Love answ'reth love: in trusting patience wait
As one who lingers by a garden gate
Expectant of the day when doubt and woe
Shall vanish as the fleeting April snow".
This was written in the space of one minute.
On the 19th November came part of a life of Zarathustra. This
was prefaced by four sheets of Persian which he could not well
transcribe. Neither he nor his friends knew anything about the
Persian prophet and he does not know a word of Persian.
The Persian script was given in English characters, but as he did
not know a word, he did not even attempt to transcribe it but began
with the English translation of the passage which was given im-
mediately afterwards.
The day following he spent at the Library having found Mills's
translation of the Gathas. But he could not find his passage and be-
came confused, he says, at the innumerable versions. So he let the
matter go. Then came Thanksgiving Day and he sat again and
asked where he might find the Persian. He was told :
"First Yasna. Thirty-one. Verse eight".
The next day he went to the Library again but could get little
help from the card catalogue. By good chance however he met an
acquaintance who might help him. This man, Mr. W. . . took him

up to the Persian room. Here he had but little luck, for although
he found copies of the Zand Avasta, they were all in Persian charac-
ters and translated into German.
After searching for about an hour, and just about to leave the
room he was led to pick up a small book which had no title on the
back. It proved to be Mills's translation of the Yasnas into English.
He turned to the XXXIst and found what is recorded below.
Then again he started to leave, but for some reason he cannot ex-
plain, he pulled out a little flat book which turned out to be a
translation of the XXXIst Yasna itself by Jackson, published in
1888. It was a better translation and he was much pleased. As the
Persian text was in Persian characters he did not trouble about it but
took the translation, and went home.
The following morning, the 26th November he again went to the
Library to read the Yasna throughout from the little Jackson edition.
It opened at the Appendix and there, to his great delight he found
the Yasnas printed in Persian but in English characters. Feeling
very happy about this, he copied the eighth verse on the back of an
envelope and to make a perfect check, he went to his room and got
out his script, taking it to the rooms of a friend J. R. Together
they compared copy and script, letter by letter. There was the iden-
tical passage; only one mistake of one single letter. And the Persian
script had come at the same high speed as all the rest !
I now give the Persian as it came through the hand of K. L.
"At thwa menghi pauvrim mazcia yazim stoi mananha
vanheus patarem mananho hyat thwa hem cashmaini hengrabem
haithim ashahyw damim anheus ahurim shyothnaeshu".
As given in Jackson (under the title 'A Hymn to Zoroaster), it
runs thus :
"At thwa menghi paourvim mazda yezim stoi mananha
vanheus patarem mananho hyat thwa hem casmaini hengrabem
haithim asahya damim anheus ahurem syaothanaesu".
He enquired as to the differences in the spelling and was at once
told:
"Yea, Now 'pauvrim' is correct. But it is 'yezim' and should be
'ye' instead of 'ya'.
His communicator seems to stand by the other variations, so that
only one mistake is admitted.
And now for the relative values of the translations. First I will
record the translation found in Mills (Gathas, p. 134, v. 8, yasna 31).

scope of the historical knowledge it contains is wonderful; the de-
scriptions vivid and image-creating. It showed a knowledge of ar-
chitectural matters of which Mr. Lloyd is entirely ignorant. After
the completion of the narrative he took a week's rest and was then
told that there was a further long message to be given.
There ensued a writing of thirty-four sheets of Latin, given in
half-an-hour. This was produced without hesitation or pause. The
title was then written :
"The Metrical Life of Hugh. A Description of the Cathedral.
We think* this is translated".
Mr. Lloyd spent the next day at two big public libraries in the
vain hope of discovering traces of such a "metrical life*. Then he
communicated with an Anglican headquarters (educational) and
found they had no copy. He therefore asked for advice as to how
to proceed and received this answer :
"If ye will read each line, we will translate verbally".
The script was thus rendered into English, the division of the lines
being first given him. The whole process was witnessed by a friend
who attests the record. On completion of the transcript of the poem,
which was 51 lines in length Mr. Lloyd posted me a copy and asked
me to enquire whether such a work was known. Now comes in
the merit of my casual purchase in 1921. On again consulting
this little book I this time turned to the Appendix and there found
the whole of the Latin of the Metrical Life, altogether 131 lines,
containing an account of the building of Lincoln Cathedral. Certain
differences were found in the wording and of these I have made a
summary. The translation was quite a good one very good con-
sidering the disjointed way in which it was produced but it differs
materially in form from either of the known translations which
I have since discovered.
The experiments of Dr. Osty have established the reality of super-
normal cognition of the lives of persons submitted to the percipients.
He shows that an article touched by the person cognized, even in the
long past, can awaken the supernormal faculty. This cognition he
refers to a transcendental plane of thought or mental activity and
infers a transfer on this plane to the percipient quite other than what

scope of the historical knowledge it contains is wonderful; the de-
scriptions vivid and image-creating. It showed a knowledge of ar-
chitectural matters of which Mr. Lloyd is entirely ignorant. After
the completion of the narrative he took a week's rest and was then
told that there was a further long message to be given.
There ensued a writing of thirty-four sheets of Latin, given in
half-an-hour. This was produced without hesitation or pause. The
title was then written:
"The Metrical Life of Hugh. A Description of the Cathedral.
We think* this is translated".
Mr. Lloyd spent the next day at two big public libraries in the
vain hope of discovering traces of such a "metrical life'. Then he
communicated with an Anglican headquarters (educational) and
found they had no copy. He therefore asked for advice as to how
to proceed and received this answer:
"If ye will read each line, we will translate verbally".
The script was thus rendered into English, the division of the lines
being first given him. The whole process was witnessed by a friend
who attests the record. On completion of the transcript of the poem,
which was 51 lines in length Mr. Lloyd posted me a copy and asked
me to enquire whether such a work was known. Now comes in
the merit of my casual purchase in 1921. On again consulting
this little book I this time turned to the Appendix and there found
the whole of the Latin of the Metrical Life, altogether 131 lines,
containing an account of the building of Lincoln Cathedral. Certain
differences were found in the wording and of these I have made a
summary. The translation was quite a good one-very good con-
sidering the disjointed way in which it was produced-but it differs
materially in form from either of the known translations which
I have since discovered.
The experiments of Dr. Osty have established the reality of super-
normal cognition of the lives of persons submitted to the percipients.
He shows that an article touched by the person cognized, even in the
long past, can awaken the supernormal faculty. This cognition he
refers to a transcendental plane of thought or mental activity and
infers a transfer on this plane to the percipient quite other than what
is generally understood by 'telepathy'. Dr. Osty does not admit ex-
ternal intelligence.
•The word 'think' is emphasized in the script.

It is the opinion of Mr. Stanley de Brath, his translator, that the
present instances differ sensibly from Dr. Osty's cases. The infor-
mation is historical, quasi-historical, and literary. The metrical Life
of Hugh was unknown both consciously and unconsciously to both
experimenters and in a language unknown to the automatist; the
translation of the Latin is given in the same way.
I had not read any of the Metrical Life and although it was in the
book that I had bought more than a year before, I had not the least
idea that it was there. The case in Mr. de Brath's opinion is out of
the category of Dr. Osty's experiments unless these matters can be
referred to knowledge possessed by me and transferred through my
letters to the percipient.
"
However improbable this may seem", he
says, "it is not impossible, as some of the metagnomic experiments
prove the mere touch of a letter giving the most complex details
of the writer's mind ... It is 'metagnosis' supernormal knowledge ;
not 'metagnomy' supernormal faculty that is here in question. The
result, rather than the faculty, is the primary fact".
The association of two persons in these historical communica-
tions is again to be noted as it was in the case of Mr. Alleyne and
myself. Mr. Lloyd can get nothing without K. L. and K. L. can
get nothing without Philip Lloyd. Equally, Mr. Alleyne has never
produced any consecutive 'Glastonbury' script without myself and
I have no ability to get a movement of the hand unless some one is
assisting me. The same has been the case in all my experiments with
Mrs. Dowden (late Mrs. Travers Smith), in association with whom
a long and interesting sequence of writings connected with early
Glastonbury and stretching back into the apostolic times, has ap-
peared. We did not ask for these ; they have in all cases offered them-
selves. The last to appear has been a document which claims to be
the lost Gospel of Philip the Deacon. It is a very fine version and
full of interest but needs much scholarly attention before it could be
offered in its entirety to the world. A portion was experimentally
printed and was submitted for review to the leading English Church
newspaper which gave it serious attention, the reviewer stating that
he found it 'a wonderful production reverent, orthodox, edifying,
and decidedly instructive nevertheless not always convincing'. The
last I feel sure he was bound to say.
These scripts are produced at great speeds. That of Mrs. Dowden
averages 2,200 words an hour and will be consecutive for over half
an hour. It is far more than the normal literary output. The

handwriting of the automatist; more frequently it is of an entirely
different character.
The language and style have always been a source of perplexity to
the critic. A communication purporting to come from a mediaeval
source will have a more or less mediaeval flavour imparted and the
Old English employed will be very mixed and very faulty at times.
The Latin is distinctly 'queer* in the case of John Alleyne. No
schoolboy would perpetrate some of the grammatical blunders found.
With Philip Lloyd we have the purest Latin and no effort at all at
mediaeval English unless we except certain brief passages in strictly
correct Anglo-Saxon. The explanation seems to be that there are
two quite distinct types of mediumship in these writings. In one
the vocabulary and indeed the whole mechanical part of the commu-
nication is claimed to be drawn from the subconscious memory of
the writer or sitter associated ; the ideas alone being supplied by the
communicating intelligence. These ideas clothe themselves auto-
matically in the language symbols most appropriate to the mood of the
communication that can be picked out of the medium's Veil of mem-
ory*. Nothing we have ever read or heard, they say, is forgotten.
The most fugitive impression can be revived, and after any lapse of
years. This permanence of memory is attested in other ways
notably in the revival of the scroll of life as a complete panorama be-
fore the eyes of persons drowning or under the influence of anaes-
thetics.
In all about ten automatists have developed the 'Glastonbury* as-
sociations in the writings I have received since 1908. Of these I
have found four who required my presence and the touch of my
fingers to establish the special link. They could write freely alone on
other subjects, but not on this. The latest to manifest the 'Glaston-
bury* control is 'Margery* the famous physical medium, who bids fair
to outshine the fame of her physical phenomena by the striking quality
of her writing. The Johannes control, which was so marked a
feature of the first scripts of John Alleyne, has manifested spontane-
ously through four different mediums, the last being 'Margery* who
knows nothing of the story and has not read my books. Johannes
came unasked and his coming was a surprise. There is a noticeable
similarity in the writing of the J. A. Johannes and the 'Margery*
Johannes. This is a feature of considerable interest and I offer
readers a specimen of each. The dates are wide apart 1908 and 1927.

My object in the instances I have now given has been to demon-
strate the Persistence of Mind, Memory and Personality, and the
mode I have chosen for my experimental demonstrations has been the
subjective one the phenomenon of involuntary writing being the
particular process selected by me. I have not found it possible to
give equal attention to the physical or objective phenomena of the
seance-room but I would remark that these also have their own value
in Psychic Science and cannot be disregarded. As a whole, however,
I should judge them far less conclusive as evidence of the actual
presence of the true personality than the subjective proofs which ex-
hibit the active working of Mind and Memory in communications
which have all the marks of careful plan, selection, and direction of
a highly intelligent nature.
In concluding my paper I will offer one example of the dynamic
power of Thought and Suggestion in an experiment made by me to
test the power of a careful mental suggestion, or mental image to im-
press itself upon the subconscious psychic entity and through this to
influence material substance.
The record of my experiment will be found in
'
Psychic Science*
(see index). During the term of my association with this magazine
as Editor, I had occasion to study what is known as 'psychic photo-
graphy* the appearance upon a photographic plate of objects not
imprinted by any normal process. Eliminating all dubious instances
and of these I found many I remained satisfied that certain per-
sons do really possess a power of causing the projection of images
upon the sensitive surface without any conscious act of their own
or any knowledge of the process at work. In no case could I satisfy
myself that such appearances were due to any phantasmal effect out-
side the camera.
EXPERIMENT IN THOUGHT-PROJECTION
Being desirous then of securing, through the instrumentality of a
known 'medium', the impression of a specific form which should be
the record of a well-visualised mental picture, I first planned the
nature of the form to be chosen and then determined the exact posi-
tion upon the plate which it should hold upon development.
I drew a diagram of twelve equal squares, four by three, and on
the left-hand lower corner square I marked the diagonals. This
diagram I executed on paper and handed as a private memorandum

with a specification of the thought-image which I wished to obtain
with the help of the medium. This image was to be a perfect circle
and it must stand exactly over the intersection of the two diagonal
lines in this particular square chosen.
The medium was Mrs. Deane, a woman in humble circumstances
and with little education. In her presence I then drew upon a black-
board the same diagram enlarged in chalk lines and then I in her
presence focussed the camera upon the board so that it just filled a
quarter-plate, 4 ins. by 3 ins.
I placed in the dark slides three new plates from an unopened
packet supplied by the College, and I put these successively in the
camera allowing her merely to hold the closed slides in her hands for
a minute or so and afterwards to place her hand on the top of the
camera during exposure of the plates.
Before this was done, I impressed very deeply upon her mind the
exact nature and position of the spot I had determined. This I
reiterated until I felt assured that she had fully grasped and as far
as possible visualised the form of the circle over the crossed diagonals.
I then exposed the plates and took them to the dark room where
I developed them, Mrs. Deane standing by my side.
On the first plate there came out the lines of the chalk diagram
alone. The ground was absolutely void of any abnormal mark. On
the second, a shaded area of irregular outline developed over the
greater part of the selected square and this shading ran over into
the margin. On the third plate there came up brilliantly a circular
spot in the exact position I had specified, and fulfilling all require-
ments. The three plates were at once exhibited to the College
authorities and blocks made from them, these being published with
the full record in the following number of Psychic Science.
I understand that Dr. Hereward Carrington was partly successful
in a somewhat similar experiment. It is one of so simple a nature
.that it should be easy to duplicate it and I urge the desirability of a
repetition by others. A result of this kind is of no great value as
evidence so long as it stands alone. But it is one of those which with
cumulative results would possess the greatest significance for science.
The human Will evokes energies which act upon Matter. Until

psychical constitution, powers capable on the one hand of being
controlled by the acts of Will and Imagination, and able on the other
hand to affect material conditions without the aid of the physical
organism or of any mechanical appliance.
The agent employed is Psychic Substance, a vehicle of force
dirigible by the Will and yet substantial in the sense that it can
and does in its turn exercise a dynamic influence upon physical matter,
and control its particles and its masses by direct association just as the
forces of electricity and magnetism are observed to do. To the stu-
dent of Psychic Science, then, there is an imponderable material which
is plastic to the powers of Mind and Soul, and which, like the field of
magnetic force around a steel bar or dynamo can attract to itself the
infinitesimal particles of physical matter, forming from these a pon-
derable body possessing powers of mechanical control. This psychic
vehicle has a formative capacity and the forms it generates will be
fixed or mutable according to the will which animates it.
Certain living organisms create and emit light. Others are found
wliich can project an electric current in a given direction. These
powers evolved for protective purposes are typical of the telekinetic
potencies which reside in the psychic centres and are merely specific
instances of a general power which may be exercised in innumerable
modes and with countless varieties of effect. The whole range of
phenomena of the seance-room are to be viewed in this light as ex-
perimental attempts to employ this ultra-physical force in a formative
as well as a dynamic capacity. The production of Ectoplasm is
to be regarded in this light, dispassionately as a well-attested fact of
observation. The intolerant attitude of many enquirers into the sub-
ject has no justification from the scientific standpoint, and the presence
of what Dr, Schiller has described as the 'Will to Disbelieve* has been
but too obvious in many cases recent in the public mind. Truth can
only be elicited when the attitude of the seeker is impartial and no
personal considerations are allowed to obscure the judgment or with-
hold the full acknowledgment of the facts and conditions observed.
We have to admit that however extraordinary and subversive of
our preconceived notions the phenomena of psychic action may be, yet
they are not on that account to be judged impossible and it is but a
confession of impotence to say that our senses have deceived us.
But the 'Will to believe* has also its dangers and these are prom-

public lecturers and writers who are advocates of this school are con-
tent to cut out and discard all weak or imperfectly attested instances
the cause of truth will not be strengthened but rather set back, and
made a subject of ridicule and contempt. The facts are quite good
enough and their cumulative value is overwhelming. But the scep-
tics must study all the facts and not argue on an insufficient basis of
knowledge as they have too often done.
As an instance of the type of evidence which should in my judg-
ment be avoided, I might mention the dubious instances of so-called
'psychic' photographs which have been widely advertised on the
authority of a leader of the spiritualist movement who is well in the
public eye. To take one example only, there will be found in the
Proceedings of the London Society for Psychic Research, (Vol. XIV,
1898-9, pp. 234-238) the record of a supposed abnormal photograph
of the late Lord Combermere taken by an amateur on the day of his
funeral. On examination of this picture by Sir William Barrett it
was found that the effect of features in the ghostly figure seated in
the chair was produced entirely by the markings of the carvings on the
chair itself. What might have been a white whisker or part of a
beard was more probably a collar or linen stock such as a footman
would have worn. And the only other definite feature was the dark
streak of a collar either of velvet or some facing material darker than
the coat. And the picture is about thirty years old. Nevertheless
this is claimed by the ardent enthusiast as evidence of the survival
of the human soul! As Editor of a responsible journal devoted to
Psychic Science I wrote to the paper which published this afresh in
May of the present year, pointing out that the lighting of the appari-
tion was identical in source with the lighting of the chair itself, the
source of light being from a window on the right of the figure. This
alone proclaimed it to be a normal figure, obtained by a partial ex-
posure exactly as it would have been if one of the servants of the
house had rested in the chair for a few minutes and moved about
a good deal. But my communication was received with a howl of
wrath from the whole school of this lecturer's adherents and I have in
consequence been asked to withdraw from the editorship of the pub-
lication known as 'Psychic Science', whose control has now passed
into other hands.

public lecturers and writers who are advocates of this school are con-
tent to cut out and discard all weak or imperfectly attested instances
the cause of truth will not be strengthened but rather set back, and
made a subject of ridicule and contempt. The facts are quite good
enough and their cumulative value is overwhelming. But the scep-
tics must study all the facts and not argue on an insufficient basis of
knowledge as they have too often done.
As an instance of the type of evidence which should in my judg-
ment be avoided, I might mention the dubious instances of so-called
'psychic' photographs which have been widely advertised on the
authority of a leader of the spiritualist move~ent who is well in the
public eye. To take one example only, there will be found in the
Proceedings of the London Society for Psychic Research, (Vol. XIV,
1898-9, pp. 234-238) the record of a supposed abnormal photograph
of the late Lord Combermere taken by an amateur on the day of his
funeral. On examination of this picture by Sir William Barrett it
was found that the effect of features in the ghostly figure seated in
the chair was produced entirely by the markings of the carvings on the

THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP
EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHIC SCIENCE
BY L. R. G. CRANDON
All honor to Clark University on this novel occasion. When
Clark University announced a symposium on Psychical Research to
cover two weeks and there to bring together, so far as possible, the
people now in America who had had the most experience, those in
authority took a notable step forwards in the history of Science.
No University has done it before. No University before has ad-
mitted officially the existence of a psychic problem.
The history of the reactions of universities to Psychical Research
shows wisdom from the worldly and practical point of view. The
universities of America are many of them in the formative and
growing stage. There are more applications for admission than
there is room and these institutions are faced with the necessity, con-
stantly, of increasing their endowments. Gifts come from the pros-
perous men of business, many of whom are stimulated to become
benefactors of the colleges because they themselves had not the oppor-
tunity in their youth. They represent money and power and ex-
hibit that sensitiveness which has always been noticed in the finan-
cial pulse of a nation.
Three bankers and a lawyer, all leaders in their lines, wanted to
sit with a famous medium and they were told by one of their own
group that such a sitting could be had if they would write down all
they saw, heard and felt during the sitting and sign their names to
it for publication. There was to be no implication of spiritualism
and no opinions to be expressed as to the cause of the phenomena
observed. One was president of a National Bank, one was presi-
dent of a Trust Company, one was a banker and financial adviser,
and the lawyer's name is known from coast to coast. They all
decided not to go to the sitting under these conditions, saying
frankly that they felt that they would menace the standing of their
institutions in the community. It is no reproach, therefore, to past
and future donors to universities to say of them that most of them.

No University has done it before. No University before has ad-
mitted officially the existence of a psychic problem.
The history of the reactions of universities to Psychical Research
shows wisdom from the worldly and practical point of view. The
universities of America are many of them in the formative and

there is room and these institutions are faced with the necessity, con-
stantly, of increasing their endowments. Gifts come from the pros•

would probably hesitate to give funds to a university which under-
takes seriously to study psychic science. This is true only because
of the attitude of the world in general towards this budding
science. There is little doubt that if one of our biggest universities
should take up the matter as a subject of study that it might lose
in future endowments from five to fifteen millions of dollars.
Public opinion, however, is a problem in psychology and it takes
strange jumps. What is dark, discredited and, in general, without
respectability today, may be that of which all the world will be
lifting its voice in praise tomorrow.
The notable case of university contact with psychics of the last
half century is that of the Seybert Commission of the University of
Pennsylvania. The sum of money was given to the University by
Mr. Henry Seybert on condition that it investigate "all systems of
Morals, Religion or Philosophy which assume to represent the
Truth, and particularly of Modern Spiritualism." The Commis-
sion consisted of ten men who sat occasionally over a period of
14 months, in 1884-85, with several mediums.
Their conclusion was that
"
Spiritualism presents the melancholy
spectacle of gross fraud, perpetrated upon an uncritical portion of the
community and that there is an unwillingness on the part of mediums
to have their powers freely investigated nothing which could be
looked upon as evidence has been purposely suppressed." If the
Report is now read in light of present knowledge of teleplasmic rods,
based on observations by Crawford and by the "Margery" Circle,
it is quite apparent that perfectly valid supernormal phenomena may
have been misinterpreted-
The record of Harvard University with regard to this science
has been consistent throughout. In the presence of Professor, later
President, Felton and three other professors, a divinity student in
whose room raps were constantly heard was reproached and ex-
pelled. Another Commission, of which the late Professor Louis
Agassiz was a member, carried on a so-called study of the medium-
ship in 1857. The behavior of the professors in this research de-
serves no other word than ludicrous, and now an entirely unofficial
group of junior instructors at Harvard, with occasional professors
as guests, sits eight times with a medium in 1925. A brief account
of this comedy will be given later.
A fund of four hundred thousand dollars was donated to Leland
Stanford University recently. From this it may be hoped that val-

uable research will come. This single large gift also gives hope

purpose. In view, therefore, of the history of psychics and the
present attitude of the world towards it, I repeat: all honor to
Clark University!
Although this occasion is religious only in a fundamental sense,
one is nevertheless tempted to begin with a text.
"Hear now this, O foolish people, without understanding; which
have eyes, and see not; which have ears and hear not;
"Brethren be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be
ye children, but in understanding be you men''
Psychic Science or Metapsychics may be defined as the science of
physical or psychological phenomena, due to outside forces which
seem intelligent, or due to unknown faculties of the human spirit.
In this old subject which is newly becoming a science, we must
begin with a confession of ignorance. If our knowledge be com-
pared to a sphere, our ignorance is like the void of space which sur-
rounds it. Like Dante, we find ourselves in a dark wood where
the way is lost. Whatever way we look the path is of alluring in-
terest. Every experiment opens up a vista of other consequent ones.
The phenomena are not orderly, judged by our limited senses. We
are overwhelmed by their variety and bizarre quality. We are
forced into the humble position of being recorders only.
Than the subject of psychical research, there is none that leads to
such an amount of emotional controversy. "Just in proportion as
the honesty of the mediums is proved, does the wrath of the com-
munity enkindle against them. The very fact that it is not a cheat
seems to anger them." (Capron, 1855). The scientific observa-
tion and recording of psychical experiments should not arouse emo-
tion in the minds of rational people nor should the subject ever be
one for debate. That it is made subject to debate and that the
debate rapidly descends into personalities seems to be a part of the
price. "The debater starts with his mind made up, his conclusions
settled. That, of course, is the primary sin against science. Biolo-
gists do not debate, nor chemists, nor physicists. They explore, ex-
periment, discuss." (Overstreet, 1926).
The subject and its manifestation are old. What is happening
now is neither new nor unique. That wonderful organization, the
Catholic Church, has always been a society for psychical research.
Not a saint becomes one until the evidence, verbal and written, of the

unusual happenings which occurred in the presence of the candidate
have been studied, and the devil's advocate has been heard, to attempt
to show that all so-called miracles may have a normal explanation. In
the history of every race we have the medicine man. Folk lore, full
of mysteries, precedes all written history. Out of every tribe come
stories of werwolves, of the little people, of fairies, of ghosts, of
haunts. Mediumistic experiments went on in the Middle Ages
under the patronage of the alchemists. The wood-cuts in their
ancient books indicate this throughout.
A score of books have been written by scholars to show that both
Old and New Testaments are full of psychic experience, spirits, and
supernormal phenomena. (Paton and Stobart).
It may properly here be asked Do these experiences in human
history form something that our civilization has emerged from or
were the ancients nearer to the mystery of things and have we lost
it? Is psychical research encouraging a return to superstition or is
it the beginning of an effort to return to a lost sensibility?
Serious scientific investigation of this subject may be said to begin
with the Work of Sir William Crookes of the Royal Society
in 1870. His treatment by the scientific world was the proto-
type of what has happened ever since. He writes, "When I first
stated that I was about to investigate the phenomena, the an-
nouncement called forth universal expression of approval. One said
that my 'statements deserved respectful consideration/ another ex-
pressed 'profound satisfaction that the subject was about to be in-
vestigated by a man so thoroughly qualified;' a third was 'gratified
to learn that the matter is now receiving the attention of cool and
clear-headed men of recognized position in science ;' a fourth asserted
that 'no one could doubt Mr. Crookes' ability to conduct the investi-
gation with rigid impartiality;' and a fifth was good enough to tell
his readers that 'if men like Mr. Crookes grappled with the subject,
taking nothing for granted until it is proved, we shall soon know
how much to believe.'
"
"These remarks, however, were written too hastily. It was taken
for granted by the writers that the results of my experiments would
be in accordance with their preconception. What they really de-
sired was not the truth, but an additional witness in favor of their
own foregone conclusions. When they found that the facts which
the investigation established could not be made to fit those opinions,
why 'so much the worse for the facts.'

"They tried to creep out of their confident recommendations of
the inquirer by declaring that 'Mr. Home is a clever conjurer who
has duped us all.' 'Mr. Crookes might with equal propriety ex-
amine the performances of an Indian juggler.' 'Mr. Crookes must
get better witnesses before he can be believed.' 'The thing is too
absurd to be treated seriously.' 'It is impossible, and therefore can-
not be.' 'The observers have all been "biologised' and fancy they
see things occur which really never took place.'
"
After extraordinary experiences with D. D. Home, Sir William
Crookes made his report of materializations, through the medium,
Florence Cook, of the famous "Katie King." For many months
Katie King repeatedly appeared, walked about, shook hands with the
sitters and was generally present as a full formed materialization
and there in the corner was Florence Cook, the medium, sound
asleep.
In 1882, Sir William Barrett offered a paper on certain psychic
experiences to the Royal Society but the governing committee de-
clined to allow him to read it. As a result of this, Sir William went
out and, with others, formed the (British) Society for Psychical
Research. The record of this Society has been characteristically
British in its conservatism. It has endorsed few mediums but it has
given a kind of dignity to the subject, and in England at least, the
subject is no longer knocked about by mountebanks.
Since 1873 the list of great minds who believed that there was
something behind all these manifestations, which science has yet to
recognize, has been large. The list of free and courageous men in-
cludes Crookes, Barrett, Sidgwick, Wallace, Myers, Flammarion,
Lombroso, Aksakoff, Sciaparelli, Bozzano, James, Richet, Lodge,
Hodgson, Hyslop, Feilding, Crawford, Geley, Schrenck-Notzing and
Doyle. These leading minds seem to agree with the final conclu-
sions of William James, that when all the fraud and deceit and
trickery are removed, there remains a residuum which no hypothesis
covers so well as that of spiritualism.
In the last ten years there has been an immense amount of data
gathered by good observers. This recrudescence undoubtedly was
stimulated by the war and its losses in life, but the growth has con-
tinued and seems to be remarkably healthy at this moment. Craw-
ford in Ireland produced three books of experiments with the Goli-
gher family. Richet and others have produced volumes of observa-

his work, with drawings and camera, with the mediums Eva C. and
Willy Schneider.
Geley, at the Institute Metapsychique in Paris, has written two
books containing experiments with Eva C., Guzik, and Kluski. This
last medium, entirely amateur, is a banker in Warsaw in whose pres-

as well, constantly occur.
METHODOLOGY
The problem of a satisfactory method by which the study of
psychical phenomena may be raised from the status of a mere hap-
hazard observation to that of a satisfactory scientific effort is by no
no means easy of solution. The diversity of phenomena, the con-
ditions of obscurity which ordinarily obtain, and the perplexing inter-
weaving of the personal equation of all concerned, observers and
spectators as well as the medium, all present elements of difficulty.
The rational observer, acquainted with the history of psychical re-
search, realizes at the outset that certain desired tests of a purely
laboratory quality are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. It is
frequently urged, for example, that the phenomena to be veridical
should be capable of repetition at will. Were the formation and
exudation of teleplasm, for example, the result of the combination
of known forces or components, the point might be soundly urged.
As yet, however, we do not surely know those components or forces,
we do not know the precise conditions under which the genetic im-
pulse giving rise to the visible manifestation shows itself. We find,
moreover, that, in the majority of instances, the phenomena do not
rise in the volition of the medium, nor are they subsequently con-
trolled by it. They are often sporadic and subject to inhibition by
causes not known. Only of late years has there been a really serious
attempt to collect and collate data scattered over the whole world.
These are difficult of access and are defectively recorded. We do
have, today, a growing feeling that these phenomena imperatively
demand persistent and scientific study by observers with proper
qualifications. This study will soonest bear sound results if there
shall be adopted a methodology of investigation which shall insure
as large a measure of uniformity in treatment as may be possible.
Then, and only then, will it be feasible to collate and compare to
the degree necessary for scientific advance.

knowledge of procedure underlies all science, all professions. Be-

he must devote a period of years to learning in all its details the
methodology of that field.
"The reason why we have not developed a generally accepted
methodology is complex. The dominant factors are the youth and
the extraordinary subject matter of our science.

here at length. The testing precautions are those of accurate rec-
ords and patient application of all possible checks and sources of
information.
In the study of physical mediums there is some progress to report,
particularly in the case of Margery. The factors subject to control
and check are:
1 . The seance-room ;
2. The observers; their character and training;
3. The Psychic and her clothing;
4. The method and adequacy of the control apparatus ;
5. The apparatus to be used; and
6. The records, to be made concurrent with the phenomena.
The need of all these observations has been developed and made
clear by experience through the usual and hard method of trial and
error. This you will see as the story of the mediumship is told.
The Temple of Truth has many entrances: the one marked
"Psychic Research" is approached by a stairway of two steps. The
first of these is labelled: "Are the phenomena real; do the physical
manifestations of supernormality actually occur?" The second step
deals with the matter of cause and need not concern us until we
have climbed the first step.
Wherever the physical phenomena occur, whether it be in a paper
house in Japan, a humble cottage in Austria, a farmhouse in Ireland,
in a room on Beacon Hill, or the laboratory of the Research Society,
there is a similarity which must be impressive. This common for-
mula may be expressed in three parts:
(1) Under conditions of rigid control, material objects are
moved. Magnetism, electricity, radio-activity and gravity are ex-
cluded. This is called telekinesis.
(2) When these things are moved, the fact is not a miracle.
Anything which happens again and again ceases to be a miracle.
On the contrary, when a material object is lifted or moved, the
hand, the eye and the camera record that the movement is caused
by a psychic rod, of a material called ectoplasm or teleplasm, which
emerges from the body of the psychic.
Of the reality of this ectoplasm, Richet says: "The alternative,
then, is that the phenomena are genuine or that they are due to
fraud. I am very well aware that they are extraordinary, even so

measurable, repeated and continued fraud seems the more probable
explanation. But is such a fraud possible? I cannot think so.
When I recall the precautions that all of us have taken not once, not
twenty, but a hundred or even a thousand times, it is inconceivable
that we should have been deceived on all these occasions. It is
possible that some day an unexpected experiment may explain our
prolonged deception quite simply. So be it, but until it has been
explained how we have all been duped by an illusion, I claim that
the reality of these materializations must be conceded.
"
(3) Always, where these things happen, there is the figment, or
fiction, or pretense, or fact, that a human entity professing to be one
that formerly inhabited this flesh, is in control of the situation and
is producing the phenomena.
To recapitulate then, there is a common formula to all physical
mediumship :
One, that things are moved ; two, that they are moved
by a terminal of ectoplasm from the body of the medium ; and, three,
that a discarnate entity pretends to control the performance.
"The first condition which a scientist should fulfill who engages
in the investigation of natural phenomena is to free his mind wholly
from philosophical misgivings ;" and "We must understand that
what our theory stamps as absurd is not always impossible in fact."
These two wise recommendations, formulated in 1865, apply ad-
mirably to the present-day detractors of psychical research.
Claude Bernard has also said that "It is never necessary to re-
pudiate an exact and adequately observed fact." The facts of
psychics are reported by scientists who, from Crookes to Richet, are
entirely accustomed to observe natural phenomena. Why, then,
does their incorporation into academic science meet such resistance?
The reasons for this are of several sorts.
We have, first, the fear of miracles, resulting from two centuries
of scientific culture. It is certain that the phenomena of meta-
psychics are of supernormal character; and hence they appear to be
miracles of a sort, in derogation of the laws of nature. But the
modern scientist insists that nature's laws be held inviolate, and has
such horror of their derogations that often he will not even pause
to ask himself whether such an affront is not merely an apparent
one. Science has a passion for phenomena which can be repeated
at will in the laboratory, under conditions which can be altered at
will to facilitate examination of the facts.

when we come to deal with organism and with mind, we find the
phenomena less and less subject to repetition at our will perhaps
because their causation is more complex, perhaps because causation is
actually a variable. Under such conditions, we encounter more and
more of anomalous facts. There exist natural phenomena which we
can neither reproduce in our laboratories nor observe at our own
will. Finally at the top of the scale, metapsychics seems to show us
a transcendence of thought which triumphs over physiological limita-
tions and even, in some measures, over those of time and space.
The incredulity of the scientists is a systematic one, for meta-
psychics disturbs their conception of the world and, therefore, they
will have none of it. We may quote to them another passage from
Claude Bernard : "It is better to know nothing than to have a mind
occupied with fixed ideas, centered upon theories for which confirma-
tion is perpetually being sought, to the neglect of everything that
does not fall into the mold."
The scientists have the most intricate explanations of these
phenomena; all really flattering the ingenuity of the medium. But
their explanations are harder to accept than ours. Margery has
been accused of being magician, electrician, radio-sharp, ventrilo-
quist, writer in nine languages, and concealer of a trained serpent.
The old lady read Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress with Explanatory
Notes by Scott. At the end she declared it was all perfectly clear
to her except the Explanatory Notes!
The attitude of some scientists seems to be: Whatever this is,
we are at least sure it is not what it pretends to be. We, on the
other hand, hold that possibly it is just what it pretends to be; no
hypothesis seems so thoroughly to fit all the facts. One bromide
that the smart critic is constantly repeating is something like this:
If when we die I must come back and make raps and ring bells, you
have added a new horror to death. The actual triviality of the
phenomena is a theme for jocose comment for those who know little,
and have thought less, on the subject. Well, a lot of trivial episodes
have started things. The apple that struck Newton hit the right
head to produce results: gravitation was born as a human concept.
Watts and his tea-kettle were the beginnings of steam power ; Frank-
lin and his kite are part of the story of electricity. It seems as if

Although one should be sternly critical as to all psychic phe-
nomena, there is no doubt that a sympathetic spiritual attitude
namely, that all this may be what it appears to be aids in getting
results. It cannot be too often repeated that psychic research of
the best sort is really "psychic" and depends on the spiritual back-
ground of the observer. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle puts it well thus:
"It is not the bumptious, self-opinionated, sitting with a ludicrous
want of proportion as a judge upon spiritual matters, who attains
results; but it is he who appreciates that the strict use of reason and
observation is not incompatible with humility of mind and that cour-
teous gentleness of demeanor which makes for harmony and sym-
pathy between the inquirer and his subject." The communicating
intelligence should be treated as an honored guest.
Sidgwick, at the close of his presidential address, puts it thus:
"Scientific incredulity has been so long in growing, and has so many
and so strong roots, that we shall only kill it, if we are able to kill
it at all, by burying it alive under a heap of facts. We must keep
"pegging-away ;" we must accumulate fact upon fact, and add ex-
periment upon experiment and not wrangle too much with incredu-
lous outsiders about the conclusiveness of any one, but trust to the
mass of evidence for conviction. We must drive the objector into
the position of being forced either to admit the phenomena as inex-
plicable, at least by him, or to accuse his fellow investigators either
of lying or cheating, or of a blindness or forgetfulness incompatible
with any intellectual condition except absolute idiocy." When the
investigators begin to accuse each other you are on a road with no
end.
The British S. P. R. has been called "a society for the suppression
of facts, for the wholesale imputation of imposture, for the dis-
couragement of the sensitive, and for the repudiation of every
revelation of the kind." Despite this, Schrenck-Notzing exhorts
his fellow worker to take heart. "Do not allow yourself to be
discouraged in your efforts to open a new domain for science

resentation of facts, by the violence of the malevolent, or by any

While to the unthinking scoffer, table-tilting, levitation, bell-ring-
ing, etc., may seem trivial in comparison with stage tricks, it must
be remembered that those who are seriously investigating these
phenomena are not out for a vaudeville entertainment, but are intent
on showing that if a single object should move even a single inch
without there being a normal physical link of causation between the
object and any person or thing in the vicinity, that here we have a
phenomenon than which there could be nothing more challenging.
That such phenomena have occurred is well attested by competent
observers. It is the explanation that bothers the conventional scien-
tist ;
he cannot pigeon-hole it, therefore he will have none of it.
The purpose of presenting the history of the Margery mediumship
up to the present time is solely to make the plea that it be considered
earnestly; that it is apparently one of the best examples of this new
psychic science. We have here apparently definite exterior motiva-
tion which takes place within nine feet of the psychic. We feel that
our whole relation to phenomena at present should be merely that
of recorders, with precision and scientific methods. The problem of
cause and significance is not before us. A scientific study of this
medium has no relation necessarily to human survival and return,
spiritism or religion.
Curiously enough, there is nothing in our experience which makes
us believe that a scientific training or a professorship is alone
enough to make a good psychical researcher. William James puts it,
"The first difference between the psychical researcher and the inex-
perienced person is that the former realizes the commonness and
typicality of the phenomena, while the latter, less informed, thinks
it is so rare as to be unworthy of attention. I wish to go on record
for the commonness."
Most of the phenomena in the seance room are things which can
be done by a sleight-of-hand artist and are only supernormal if they
occur under conditions of control which make it impossible for the
psychic to do them. It is a fundamental regulation, therefore, of
an honestly conducted investigation that the control of the psychic
shall be such that the psychic is anatomically and mechanically in-
capable of making the phenomena. He should be able to say, before
the sitting, "The control is such that fraud is eliminated from the
discussion." Constantly we find investigators making a "plant" on

in the control through which the investigator himself can escape
later and thus avoid admitting that he could not explain the mani-
festation.
The scientist from the laboratory of chemistry or physics is by
training used to controlling all the conditions of an experiment. In
psychical research you control only some of the conditions. The
other conditions and the results may be as remote and purely ob-
servational as astronomy, where we control nothing.
In 1762, Galvani said, "I am persecuted by two classes: the scien-
tists, and the know-it-alls. They call me the frog's dancing master.
But I know that I have discovered one of the greatest forces of
nature."
It may be readily seen, therefore, from what has been given, that
the study of psychics has its vexations.
In this study it is difficult to find men who are free. By that
we rnean men independent enough of social, economic or academic
pressure to be willing to write down, sign, and publish what they
see, feel, and hear in the seance room.
The difference between the intellectual slave and the free man is
shown by this: A learned professor, faced with the thirtieth repeti-
tion of an experiment with his own apparatus, under his own con-
ditions, said, "If I were to declare that to be a supernormal phe-
nomenon, I should have to overthrow the philosophy of a lifetime."
In contrast to this, one free and fearless mind, Mr. John Haynes
Holmes, speaking on this mediumship only a few months ago, said,
"the reality of what is done, under strictest control, is established.
In saying this, we are shaking the conviction of a lifetime. But we
are interested in convictions only as they are consistent with truth.
Truth is what we want."
The story of the Margery mediumship is brief, and consists of a
series of well proven facts, but, though typical of the best quality
of physical mediumship, it is unique in several respects.
Discovered accidentally in 1923, the mediumship has advanced
rapidly and the phenomena which occur appear equally well at
home or abroad. Margery enters a laboratory in Paris, or London
for the first time, and, under conditions laid down by the most
experienced men in the world, the phenomena begin within a few

once and it was quickly found, by elimination, who was to blame.
A code of raps was established and the names of various discarnate
people came through. One, which declared itself to be Walter,
brother of the psychic, came to dominate the sittings. After two
months the psychic went into trance and Walter spoke through her.
During this period other persons in the circle were occasionally
seized in trance by the same controlling entity. Whether this
entity be a hypnotic impersonation, a secondary personality, or really
what it pretends to be has no bearing on the reality of the physical
supernormal phenomena which occur.
Two months later Walter's independent voice first came through;
of which more later. Communication was thus made easy and
experiments went on of increasing complexity.
In 1924, came a period of observation and investigation by a
committee selected by the Scientific American. This was largely a
period of comedy. One member, the most experienced student of
this subject in the world, declared the phenomena to be of first
quality and supernormal. The Secretary of the committee reached
the same conclusion. One member said at the end of every sitting,
"There are plenty of psychic phenomena here", but he wouldn't
write it. Perhaps he was wisely discreet. The third member was
deaf. At a sitting in the dark, therefore, with eyes and ears missing,
as it were, he might as well have been absent! A fourth member,
whose knowledge of wriggling out of strait-jackets and hand-
cuffs was as great as his ignorance of psychics, came with his mind
made up before he started. The last member saw apparatus used,
of his own making, under his own conditions, over forty times, but
decided it could not be true because he would not believe it. These
inexplicable occurrences did not fit into his already formed philoso-
phy, and the intellectual hole he found himself in was a bit uncom-
fortable. The signed notes of the Scientific American Committee
are entirely accurate and contain no implication of normal produc-
tion of phenomena.
Now people began coming from all over this country, together
with visitors from Canada and Europe, Mexico, Brazil and New
Zealand. No effort is made to establish a center of propaganda
and no one is asked his opinion, but each sitter was and is required
before he leaves to write down what he has observed. Interest in
the subject grows like a rolling snowball. Students and Faculty

members from many colleges are on the waiting-list: Clark, Tufts,
Yale, Smith, Harvard, Michigan, Nebraska, Johns Hopkins, Ox-
ford, Princeton, Maine, Columbia and Technology. The observers
include men and women of all classes: editors, teachers, doctors,
lawyers, ministers of all denominations, and business men.
The next flurry in this merry battle was in June, 1925, when a
group of four junior instructors at Harvard College with an occa-
sional professor as a guest, asked leave to observe things out there
under their own conditions. This was readily granted, under our
usual conditions, which are two in number: first, that the notes
shall be made on the dictaphone while the events are occurring, and
that these notes shall be signed by all present and given to the
medium before another sitting; and second, that any fraud or impli-
cation of fraud shall be entered in the dictaphonic notes or shall be
deemed nonexistent. Under these conditions there were eight won-
derful sittings, the notes of which have recently been published;
1
without addition, subtraction or any change whatsoever. These
notes are so precise and so accurate and so perfectly record every-
thing that happened, that the mediumship is glad to stand or fall
on the Harvard notes. This series of eight sittings, in which there
was no flaw and no way to escape the psychic origin of the phe-
nomena, was entirely unofficial as far as Harvard went, but, never-
theless, was in a fair way to commit the name of Harvard to the
endorsement of the medium. This would be a very serious matter
for any educational institution in any American community at this
moment. Charges of trickery were hurled into the newspapers by
the Harvard group without a single reference to their own notes.
They knew it was not trickery but that was their only way out.
There can be no blame attached to these men for seeking to pro-
tect the name of Harvard from endorsing in any way the phenomena
of the seance room. The only possible reproach to them is that they
should have begun an investigation like this without visualizing the
possibility that they might have to endorse it. The friends of
Margery can only laugh at them and forgive them. The dicta-
phone records and its memory never fails!
In June, 1926, Mr. Eric J. Dingwall, Research Officer of the
(British) Society for Psychical Research, made a report on the
Margery Mediumship. It was based on his experiments in Janu-
^argery, Harvard, Veritas, 1926. To be obtained on application.

paper is: "Those who have read it have all come to different
opinions as to the real views of the author," as if this were some-
thing of which an author should boast! The Honorable Everard
Feilding says of it "circumstances led him to box the compass of most
opinions and to end with none." Mr. Dingwall declares explicitly,
however, "I have never on any occasion detected anything that could
be called fraud or deceit." At the time of his sitting, he wrote a pri-
vate letter to Baron von Schrenck-Notzing, which was later pub-
lished.

In this he said, "It is the most beautiful case of teleplasmic
telekinesis with which I am acquainted. We can freely touch the
teleplasm. The materialized hands are joined by cords to the
medium's body; they seize objects and move them. The teleplasmic
masses are visible and tangible upon the table in excellent red light.
I held the medium's hands; I saw (teleplasmic) figures and felt them
in good light. The 'control* is irreproachable."
Suddenly Mr. Dingwall's enthusiasm received a damper. Janu-
ary 18, 1925, Dr. William McDougall wrote a letter to Mr. Ding-
wall marked "strictly confidential" but later published by him.3
In
this letter he wrote: "My testimony to it would, I venture to think,
carry considerable weight, even in the scientific world ;
whereas a
favorable report by you, if not supported or confirmed by me, might
fail to do so. It is highly probable, or even inevitable that, when
you report the ectoplasmic phenomena to be genuine, you will be
accused by the scientists of being an accomplice, of being in collu-
sion with "Margery." Your best defense against this would be my
concordant testimony and support. Further, I shall, no doubt, be
expected to render some report to the English S. P. R. : and it will
be very unsatisfactory from every point of view, if your report and
mine on the same series of sittings are in serious disagreement

the ectoplasm. That is good as far as it goes; but it seems to me,
you are bound to try to carry me along with you."

ship and is unhappy because his dictum has not already done so.
He kills it but it will not die. Thus in 'Psyche/ October, 1926, he
writes: "It might have been hoped that the adverse verdict of the
Scientific American Committee, followed as it was by Mr. Hoag-
land's article in the Atlantic Monthly for November, 1925, would
have satisfied all but a few resolute believers that the claims made
on behalf of this medium have no solid foundation. But it would
seem clear that no such result has been obtained .... Her many
partisans, some of whom are persons of excellent standing, continue
to make public large claims on her behalf, claims which, if they
were well founded, should establish her as perhaps the most re-
markable medium of all time/'
Before giving the details of the kinds of phenomena, one may well
anticipate a legitimate question which is always propounded. Why
must these occurrences take place in the dark or in red light? The
really complete answer is: these things take place in the dark be-
cause such is the law governing them. One might say, "Why pick
on me? I did not make the universe nor its psychic laws." A more
serious effort, however, to answer the question, with what knowl-
edge we have, would be as follows: The production of the tele-
plasmic rods which come from the body of the medium is a vital
process, akin in some way, perhaps, to birth. If you will reflect,
you will admit at once that nearly all vital processes go on in the
dark and in the dark only. Brain action, respiration, heart beat,
digestion and gestation all go on only in the dark. In short, a
property of teleplasm is that it is soluble in light. Consider the
conditions of the development of a photographic plate. This may
be done only in a light no stronger than red. The development of a
plate for colored photography must be done in absolute dark. The
necessity, then, of darkness, or red light for psychic experiments only
calls for a little ingenuity on the part of the observer, to insure
good conditions of control.
The visitor from Mars is told that one-third of our day is spent
as if dead. We call it sleep. "I don't believe it," says he. "Show

shout "sleep!" If no sleep ensues it's a fraud! A request for
quiet and darkness would be very suspicious.

these four fastened to eye bolts in the floor of the cabinet and to
the outside of side-holes in the glass cabinet (Figure 1) and the ends
closed with railway express lead seals. The parts of the wire going
around wrists and ankles are made immobile by surgeon's tape and
the position of the tape made permanent by blue pencil marks. The
Psychic's knees are wrapped from 4 inches above the knee to 4
inches below the knee with surgeon's tape, binding the knees fast
together, leaving no room between them. The Psychic wears, be-
sides the garments already described, only a searched kimono. Her
mouth, ears and short-cut hair are searched, and the neck is fas-
tened tightly, to prevent any movement forwards, by a locked
leather collar fastened by a horizontal rope leading to an eye-bolt
in the back of the cabinet. She sits in a wooden Windsor chair
fastened to the floor of the cabinet. The distance from the wire
knots to the eye-bolts is recorded. The general outline of the

THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP 83
Although this mediumship has several qualities which make it
unique, it is, nevertheless, typical of all the best mediumships in
history, and presents, it is believed, more kinds of phenomena than
any other, at least, that has been recorded. Notes have been kept,
in laboratory fashion, of every sitting, from the first. Every phe-
nomenon hereinafter described is to be found in the signed notes.
The categories are seventeen in number as follows:
1. Breezes from the cabinet, with a recorded drop in tempera-
ture from 70 degrees to 42 degrees, a total of 28 degrees.
2. Raps. These are heard anywhere within 15 feet of the
psychic and they vary in sound from a soft tap with the finger, up
to a sound like the kick of a heavy shoe. There may be gentle raps
under the table, and when the stethoscope is laid on top of the table
the sound can be analyzed as if it were made by a finger and nothing
else. They occur high and low in the room and may even be
heard as if made by some metal terminal. Thus apparent communi-
cating raps have been heard on a woman sitter's wedding ring. At
other times luminous apparatus of the seance room may be seen
lifted and used to make raps against the side of the cabinet or else-
where. These raps apparently answer questions intelligently and
the usual code has been used for communication by raps, namely:
1. No; 3. Yes; 2. Don't Know; 4. good night; 5. good
evening; 6. Be silent; etc. As a means of communication, the
raps were quickly superseded in this mediumship for an easier
means.
3. Table-Tilting. This was the first manifestation in this
mediumship and, using the same code, communication was apparent-
ly established with some intelligence. The table used was built on
the specifications of Crawford, namely, a seventeen-pound table,
rough wood, no nails. This same force came shortly to be used for
4. Telekinesis by teleplasmic rods. The table sometimes, with
only superficial contact of the sitters* fingers on top of it, in good
red light, will move itself about from one room to another, and even
go down stairs. On one occasion it led directly to an article of
jewelry which had been lost for a year and a half. It will at times
be lifted as high as the sitters can reach above the floor and then
will dance about in the air, keeping perfect time with music on the
victrola. It has also been levitated with a 160-pound man sitting
on it. It has also been levitated (once only) in good white light,

without hand-contact, at the rooms of the (British) S. P. R. in
London. Several times a reasonable effort was made by two ob-
servers lying on the floor to hold it down but in vain the ultimate
pull being 30 to 40 pounds upwards ;
all this in red light. Other ob-
jects are also levitated such as straw baskets with luminous bands on
them; "Doughnuts" or rings, made of stiff paper, luminous on one
side; a three-pound papier-mache megaphone, also illuminated, and
other objects even as small as a luminous-headed pin. The piano
stool has been moved in good red light seven feet ten inches, the
nearest person (including the psychic) being ten feet away. Such
levitation takes place under the strictest conditions of control, to be
described later, and, if desired as a test, in the presence of only one
observer. Many times two small luminous objects such as a dough-
nut and a basket are in the air at the same time, moving not parallel
to each other and not at the same rate of speed, and they may be
seen to be moving in all three possible directions during one levita-
tion. Such objects are taken from the hand of the observer and
levitated and a luminous "doughnut" may be thus taken from the
observer through a small hole in the front of the cabinet, levitated
about and is then pushed through a side hole in the cabinet. A
luminous basket may be lifted from the floor, carried out from the
cabinet as far as five feet from the psychic into the middle of the
circle of sitters, in front of the cabinet, and will be levitated high
and low, will touch the hands of the sitters and then will be
carried back into the cabinet, far above the head of the psychic and
behind her head, all under conditions of physical control so perfect
that the psychic could not do any of these things by normal means.

without hand-contact, at the rooms of the (British) S. P. R. in
London. Several times a reasonable effort was made by two ob-
servers lying on the floor to hold it down-but in vain'-the ultimate
pull being 30 to 40 pounds upwards; all this in red light. Other ob-
jects are also levitated such as straw baskets with luminous bands on
them; "Doughnuts" or rings, made of stiff paper, luminous on one
side; a three-pound papier-mache megaphone, also illuminated, and
other objects even as small as a luminous-headed pin. The piano
stool has been moved in good red light seven feet ten inches, the
nearest person (including the psychic) being ten feet away. Such
levitation takes place under the strictest conditions of control, to be
described later, and, if desired as a test, in the presence of only one
observer. Many times two small luminous objects such as a dough-
nut and a basket are in the air at the same time, moving not parallel
to each other and not at the same rate of speed, and they may be
seen to be moving in all three possible directions during one levita-
tion. Such objects are taken from the hand of the observer and
levitated and a luminous "doughnut" may be thus taken from the
observer through a small hole in the front of the cabinet, levitated
about and is then pushed through a side hole in the cabinet. A
luminous basket may be lifted from the floor, carried out from the
cabinet as far as five feet from the psychic into the middle of the
circle of sitters, in. front of the cabinet, and will be levitated high
and low, will touch the hands of the sitters and then will be
carried back into the cabinet, far above the head of the psychic and
behind her head, all under conditions of physical control so perfect
that the psychic could not do any of these things by normal means.

copper terminals come together and the bell in the box rings. The
box is padlocked after examination, before the sitting, and it is
examined similarly after the sitting. There is no apparent way to
ring the bell but by bringing the two terminals together. This
box was devised and made by the Scientific American Committee
and was declared by them to be fraud-proof. In red light this box
may be picked up by any sitter. After he has lifted it, the bell will
ring intermittently while the holder of it walks about the room
as far as he can go in that room, nearly nine feet; is held high and
low, and the holder may turn himself about in complete circles or
may hand the box through the hands of every sitter, sometimes as
many as fifteen, and the bell will continue to ring with irregular
intermittency, and will end ringing in the same period of red light.
It may be inspected then and there during the same period of red
light with the addition of white flash light and no normal explana-
tion is found. As another experiment, with the box sitting in red
li^ht
on the table, the bell will ring in "longs" and "shorts" in
combination of sequence designated by any sitter, the whole experi-
ment, from the verbal requests to examination of the box, carrying
on through and ending in the same period of good red light.

brass, except for wooden pans and a steel balancing edge resting on
a piece of agate, are used. In this experiment either pan of the
balance is loaded with three to six wooden weights (checkers) and
the other pan has none. These unequally loaded pans are made, by
Walter, to balance as if equally loaded. This experiment begins
and ends in the dark but is to be seen clearly in the red light for a
period of 5 to 25 seconds. While being examined in red light the
psychic can leave the cabinet and the hands of the sitters may be
passed above and below the pans, over and around the balances com-
plete, all possible threads from any sitter to the balances being thus
ruled out. As a second variety of this experiment, while the un-
evenly loaded but balanced pans, either static or in oscillation, are
seen to be balancing, the whole scale-unit with its base may be
picked up by the observer and white flash light played on it and all
around it showing it to have no connection with anything nearby.
Photographs before and after, as well as examination before and
after, show the scales to be unchanged in all respects, and no normal
explanation of the experiment is forthcoming.

86 L. R. G. CRANDON
Dr. R. T. Tillyard, F. R. S., writing to Professor Wm. Mc-
Dougall of Harvard, May 6, 1926, about the balance experiment,
said: "I must give it as my deliberate opinion that this experiment is
about as perfect as human ingenuity can devise. Taken in con-
junction with the photographs, (See category 10, below) which show
the "psychic cylinder," in the empty pan, I think this constitutes a
very strong case for both validity and also for the supernormal
origin of the phenomenon."
6. Trance-Voice. Early in the mediumship and for a period of
not over two months there was the ordinary trance-voice such as
all subjective mediums have. This voice was contralto, of a mascu-
line timbre, and used a vocabulary not characteristic of the psychic.
7. Trance-Writing. At one sitting only has this phenomenon
appeared. On this occasion the psychic in trance in red light made
motions with her hand as if to write. An envelope was hurriedly
put on the table as the only paper available. A pencil was put in
the psychic's hand. Her head was turned over her left shoulder.
The eyes were closed tight. The hand then wrote in Latin "Qui
creavit te sine te non salvit te sine te:" a Delphic remark for your
consideration. Large sheets of paper were now brought and the
psychic went on writing with great rapidity and perfect lineation,
communicating in nine languages, including Latin, Ancient Italian,
Modern Italian, French, German, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Angli-
cized Chinese, and Chinese Ideographs. Some of these when writ-
ten were shoved violently across at one sitter or another as if meant
for him.
7A. Automatic Writing has been observed a number of times.
8. Musical sounds of super-normal origin. Early in the
mediumship the control (Walter) said one night: "I am going to
try something which I believe has never been done before. The
Admiral is going to help me. You are to remain in circle, un-
broken, no matter how long." The psychic then went into deeper
trance with head bowed low, in red light, and so remained 28
minutes. At the end of that time her head was raised. An expres-
sion of satisfaction appeared on the face, though her eyes were closed,
and then all 14 sitters heard in the room a chime-like rendering of
the "Taps" of the American Navy. It was a pure sound no sound
of the impact as of hammer on gong and no other sound to indicate
any instrument. It was more like a ship's bell heard through the

of the impact as of hammer on gong and no other sound to indicate
any instrument. It was more like a ship's bell heard through the
THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP 87
fog some distance away. There was no instrument in the house
that could make such a sound, and there was no radio. This experi-
ment later was repeated about nine times, apparently needing less
effort and certainly less time on each occasion. Later the notes of
the piano were heard; on another occasion, for an ex-officer of the
British Army, apparently three buglers, playing separate instruments,
could be heard, like trumpeters sounding the "9 P. M. Call" of
the British Army. Other instruments have been made to give forth
their notes. Another manifestation of this same class is the striking
of the bell-like notes of a large clock, deep in tone and very slow.
We call it the "Celestial Clock." Walter calls it his "Wee
Watchie."
9. Perfumes. On one occasion only a phenomenon of this class
appeared. Each sitter in turn was made to smell and reported an
odor which might be described as a combination of Lily-of-the-
Valley and Rose, oppressively sweet and oriental in character.
10. Supernormal lights. These lights have varied from small,
pin-head points up to great moving, twisting columns of luminosity,
2 feet wide by 7 feet high. Such a column of light as this has
been angulated in two places as if a human figure were seated on
the table and a bifurcation of the lower section swings like two legs
from the edge of the table. A luminous mass the size and shape of
a human eye is seen going about the room and appears to wink. A
luminous object may take on the form of a human mouth a voice
comes from it. Rod-like projections of light will come forth from
the cabinet and touch the clothing, or hands or heads of the sitters,
who see and feel the impact. Another subdivision of this class is
when the object, painted with luminous bands, (zinc sulphure,
lumineux) not activated (as it must be by exposure to white light
before the sitting) is suddenly made luminous as if the control were
activating it from some source of light entirely ultra-violet. If a
hand is put on such a non-activated painted surface the control can
make the area shine under the hand. The amount of activating
light must be small because the luminosity thus made does not long
endure. A figure as of a luminous rose was once seen on the ceiling.
11. Materialization invisible to the human eye, some of them,
at least, intangible. Many times, under instructions of Walter,
flash lights of the medium's cabinet and method of control and table
have been taken. Many times these have shown objects which the

11. Materialization infJisible to the human eye, some of them,
at least, intangible. Many times, under instructions of Walter,
flash lights of the medium's cabinet and method of control and table
have been taken. Many times these have shown objects which the
88 L. R. G. CRANDON
eye did not see. For example: flash lights (l/50th of a second,
magnesium powder) were made of the aforementioned balances, one
wooden pan of which contained five wooden weights and the other
pan none. These unequally loaded pans can be seen balancing evenly
or in perfect equal oscillation, overcoming gravity. On developing
these plates, there is always seen on the lighter pan or near it, a
cylinder (Figure 2) about eight inches tall and three or four inches
in diameter, looking as if made of celluloid. This is not to be
seen by a human eye, and a hand passed above the empty pan, and
close to it, while the phenomenon is going on, fails to feel such a
cylinder. Yet always the camera, equipped with a fused quartz lens,
reveals this psychic structure. The glass lens does not photograph it.
Hence, we assume that we have here a psychic structure invisible
and intangible, but yet giving out or illuminated by ultra-violet rays.
In this class appears also materialization of a luminosity insufficient
to reach the human eye and yet recordable by a quartz lens camera.
Walter says, "I will show you my hand ringing the bell box/'
The red light shows the bell box ringing but nothing as to what
is ringing it. The flash light used with quartz lens shows a large
white hand ringing the bell box (Figure 3). A megaphone has been
photographed in the air, apparently unsupported by any normal struc-
ture. A table has been photographed in good levitation. Hands
are seen in other parts of the plate from time to time. Photographs
were wanted of the bell box for publication purposes. The photo-
graph was taken in bright sunlight in the fourth story of the house.
The photographer, an instructor of the Mass. Institute of Tech-
nology, using his own camera and plates, was alone in the room with
the bell-box in the bright sun of noon. The psychic, being the only
other person in the house, was in the basement.. Three photographs
of the bell box were taken and all of these showed a white fog, ir-
regular, over the middle of the plate, and in that fog, in a different
part of each plate and in different relation to the box, there appeared
the profile of a man. The photographer says he knows of no way in
which he could normally thus be-fog a plate.
12. Materialization felt but not seen. Hundreds of times under
conditions of perfect control, sitters have been touched as if by a
human hand or as if by soft rods. These structures are soft, rubbery,
cold (40* F.), yet feel as if they contained a firm core. They will
appear as firm black hands over a luminous plaque or may be seen

eye did not see. For example: Bash lights (1/50th of a second,
magnesium powder) were made of the aforementioned balances, one
wooden pan of which contained five wooden weights and the other
pan none. These unequally loaded pans can be seen balancing evenly
or in perfect equal oscillation, overcoming gravity. On developing
these plates, there is always seen on the lighter pan or near it, a

in diameter, looking as if made of celluloid. This is not to be

white hand ringing the bell box (Figure 3). A megaphone has been

12. Materialization felt but not seen. Hundreds of times under
conditions of perfect control, sitters have been touched as if by a
human hand or as if by soft rods. These structures are soft, rubbery,
cold (40" F.), yet feel as if they contained a firm core. They will
appear as firm black hands over a luminous plaque or may be seen
THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP 89
picking up luminous structures. They may be rods from 1-6 of an
inch up to 2 inches in diameter, blunt or pointed. They may appear
as a two-pronged instrument. It may come in shape like a French
loaf and push against leg, body or head of a sitter. It may appear
as a perfected hand over a luminous plaque. These structures are
mobile and directed by intelligence.
13. Materialization visible and tangible. In good red light there
appear hands of normal size, made of teleplasm, sometimes crude and
without skin, then with skin, with or without finger nails, some-
times with two fingers fused into one but with two nails. The whole
hand and forearm may appear. The fingers never contain more
than two phalanges. All the bones of the palm may be missing and
the forearm may contain one or two long bones. These hands move
intelligently under good red light. The hand may engage in a tug
of war over a luminous basket, the other handle of which is held by
the sitter. These materializations are always connected with the
body of the psychic by a cord resembling that which attaches the
new born infant to the mother. This cord may be felt down to its
origin as in a normal birth process. To feel, it is clammy, illustrating
a description made of it by William Blake, the Mystic, 150 years
ago when he said it was "Wet with the water which wets not".
There is a variety of the material teleplasm (or ectoplasm) which
has a different source and character. It comes from the right ear
(Figure 4) of the psychic and is pure white, whereas the color of the
hands described above is greyish. This head teleplasm is cold, feels
wet or clammy, and may develop and spread over the whole head
and face of the psychic and pour down into her lap; though it re-
mains connected with the ear. It may be seen and felt to develop and
grow downwards. A great sheet of it sometimes extends down five
feet as if draped over a kind of proboscis arising from the face of the
psychic. This mass appears lace-like in structure, but that is only
appearance. There are really no holes in it. A structure is produced
from time to time, which Walter says is the machine by which his
independent voice talks (Figure 5). It is a greyish mass looking
more or less like a large potato (4"x3"x2") which lies on the right
shoulder or chest of the psychic and is pendant from a fine white
cord out of the right ear. From this mass there goes up to the right
nostril of the psychic a structure like an umbilical cord of the new
born. It is twisted and fleshy. All the structures described under

ago when he said it was "Wet with the water which wets not".
There is a variety of the material teleplasm (or ectoplasm) which
has a different source and character. It comes from the right ear
(Figure 4) of the psychic and is pure white, whereas the color of the
hands described above is greyish. This head teleplasm is cold, feels
wet or clammy, and may develop and spread over the whole head
and face of the psychic and pour down into her lap; though it re-
mains connected with the ear. It may be seen and felt to develop and
grow downwards. A great sheet of it sometimes extends down five
feet as if draped over a kind of proboscis arising from the face of the
psychic. This mass appears lace-like in structure, but that is only
appearance. There are really no holes in it. A structure is produced
from time to time, which Walter says is the machine by which his
independent voice talks (Figure 5). It is a greyish mass looking
more or less like a large potato (4"x3"x2") which lies on the right
shoulder or chest of the psychic and is pendant from a fine white
cord out of the right ear. From this mass there goes up to the right
nostril of the psychic a structure like an umbilical cord of the new
born. It is twisted and fleshy. All the structures described under
90 L- R- G. CRANDON
this heading have been photographed many times not only by a quartz
lens but by glass camera, single and sterescopic, and the plates con-
firmed in each instance what our eyes beheld. The teleplasmic
structures, after exposure to the white flash for the photographs, be-
come luminous for a few seconds and then shrink visibly as if dis-
solving. These structures have been studied at the moment of their
appearance and at the moment of their disappearance. Apparently
they disintegrate in the same manner as has been observed of snow in
the recent expedition up Mt. Everest. Snow at high altitudes, in
evaporation, apparently does not pass through the watery stage: you
observe snow, and then nothing.
14. The Independent Voice. As has been stated, trance and
trance speaking appeared two months after the beginning of the me-
diumship, and lasted about two months. The first night a hiss like
the end of the word "yes s s" was heard in the far corner of the
seance room. At the next sitting the word "Cassie" was heard in
the doorway, (and was evidential). At the next sitting faint whis-
pers were heard in the cabinet from the region near the medium's
head. This whispered voice got stronger at each subsequent sitting
and has remained ever since. It now may be described as a mas-
culine, guttural whisper. A keen and matter-of-fact-lawyer who
sat occasionally said what every mind with good sense would say:
"A healthy young woman goes into a dark cabinet and a healthy
young voice comes out of it; one and one make two!" We could
not gainsay that. But we were not content with that. A hand was
put over the medium's mouth by Dr. Comstock and the voice went
on as before. This same experiment has been done by Dr. Carring-
ton, by Mr. Bird and by others with the same result, and these re-
ports have been published. The next objective thing to do was to
fill the mouth of the medium with water and this has been done
many times. The voice goes on unimpeded and at the end of the ex-
periment the psychic ejects the same amount of water and there is
nothing to suggest that the water comes from the stomach.
Dr. Mark W. Richardson, in many respects the best mind that
has studied the mediumship, now sought a mechanical proof of the
independence of the Walter voice which should be automatic and un-
questioned. He devised therefore what he calls "the voice-cut-out-
machine". (Figure 6) This has a U-tube 3 ft. high and 1J4 inches
in diameter. One arm of this connects by a flexible metal gas-pipe
with the mouth of the Medium. There are two luminous corks

in d!ameter. One arm of this connects by a flexible metal gas-pipe
with the mouth of the Medium. There are two luminous corks
THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP 91
floating at the same level in each arm of the U-tube. The metal
tube to the mouth has attached at its end a glass mouthpiece (See Fig-
ure 6), so shaped that it cannot be pushed beyond a certain flange
into the mouth. There is a hole which must be covered by the upper
lip, another which must be covered by the lower lip, and after the
psychic blows up the floats, the tongue must cover the end4
of the
glass tip, to keep the floats in a state of disequilibrium.
The psychic's hands are held or lashed with wire (to prevent the
hand being put on the upper end of the U-tube). The glass tip is
put into her mouth. She blows until the floats are about 20 inches
apart in level, and then in the dark, under these conditions, the Walter
voice talks and whistles freely; will whistle any tune requested, if he
knows it, and takes apparent delight in pronouncing words which
contain many labial, dental and lingual sounds. This experiment
will last as long as the psychic's teeth will endure the weight of the
tip and tube (usually about two minutes). It is interesting to note
that the first time this tube was tried was in a house in which none
of the circle had ever been before and the experiment was carried out
by the psychic and Dr. Richardson alone in a closed room. The ex-
perimental results were just as good on that first night in a strange
house as they have been ever since. In other words, no practice was
necessary because the voice is produced independently. It is thus in-
dependent not of the Psychic's presence, but independent of her nor-
mal anatomy and physiology.
Concerning the mechanism by which the independent voice is pro-
duced, a materialization of some kind must be necessary. Sure enough
in due time Walter promised to show us his voice apparatus. He
does so and we are allowed to see it, feel it and photograph it. (See
Figure 5, and description in Section 12). Walter explains that
when we want the experiment of hand-over-mouth-and-nose of the
Psychic, he must attach this voice apparatus of his to some other
part of the Psychic, that this is difficult and that whenever this ex-
periment is done, he can do no other phenomena that night, and such
has been our experience.
14-A. Other Respiratory Phenomena. Dr. Richardson, with his
clear thinking and quietly persistent mind, proceeded with ex-
periments to see if more than one alleged discarnate could exhibit
signs of respiratory materializations. He placed in front of the
Psychic in her glass cabinet a shelf. On this shelf is put a blow
bottle half full of baryta water (saturated solution of Barium Hy-

Psychic in her glass cabinet a shelf. On this shelf is put a blow

drate). To the inlet tube, is attached a metal pipe held by a wooden
clamp towards the Psychic, about 30 inches away from her mouth.
Her mouth and the apparatus cannot get nearer together. Now the
Psychic blows up the voice machine. Walter talks and there is a
passage of bubbles through the baryta water. Not only are these
bubbles heard, but luminous floating glass pellets may be seen and
heard dancing up and down in the baryta water. Here, then, we
have the Psychic's mouth fully occupied, the voice talking and bubbles
coming through the blow bottle. After the experiment the baryta
water showed precipitation of barium carbonate from carbonic acid
gas, as from a normal lung. As a check, blowing cabinet-air through
a bottle of baryta water the same length of time (40 seconds) gives
a faint precipitation, but not so much by far as a human breath gives.
This experiment is now repeated without the voice cut-out-machine
but with Dr. Richardson's hand over the Psychic's mouth and nose
and no one else in the room. To further complicate this experiment,
Walter said one night, "Now, Mark (one of Walter's band) will
blow through the Barium water and there will be no precipitation.
He will bring his own gas with him." The Psychic blew up the
voice-machine, Walter talked, the bubbles came through the baryta
water and examination afterwards showed no precipitation in the
bottle. When Dr. Richardson blew through the same baryta water,
however, normal precipitation occurred. This showed that some gas
other than carbonic acid passed through the bottle in this experiment.
15. Apports and deports. On this part of the manifestations we
bear lightly. It includes moving objects into and out of a closed
room. They are most difficult to believe. They involve either the
actual existence of a four-dimensional world or depend on the very
latest concept of matter, namely energy and the motion of atoms
without collisions whereby one solid may pass through another. These
are discontinuous physical phenomena. Together with haunts, ghosts
and psychometry, apports form a class difficult for science to explain
without turning to discarnate entities.
In this mediumship there have been ten instances of apport and one
of deport. They include antique jewelry, flowers and a live pigeon.
The conditions of each occasion have been good, but really to be of
scientific value such manifestations would have to appear with the
psychic enclosed in cement and sitting in an all cement cell. Pre-
sumption of validity must rest :

the room, and (2) on the nature of the thing apported and whether

it could be normally obtained, secreted and delivered under the
seance conditions.
16-A. Paraffine Gloves. (Figure 7). Another line of ex-
perimentation on which extended reports will be made later, is the
making of paraffine gloves. There are put on low stools in front of
the Psychic, a papier-mache pail containing 8 quarts of melted par-
affine on top of 3 or 4 inches of boiling water (making the tempera-
ture 212 when it leaves the kitchen, and 180 at the end of the ex-
periment), and beside this pail a galvanized pail full of cold water.
Through the sitting, under controlled conditions, we hear a lot of
flopping about in both pails as if a large fish were in one or the other.
At the end of the sitting, 30 to 60 minutes, we find in the pail of
water or alongside it, one, two to three gloves made of the molten
paraffine, now hardened. In the wrist end is a small hole out of
which no human hand could get. These gloves may now be filled
with an emulsion of Plaster of Paris. When this is hardened the
paraffine is melted off and we have a cast of the psychic glove. This
cast of a hand is not that of the medium, is always masculine, and
may resemble that of one of the sitters. It is needless to say that
at the end of the sitting, before anyone moves, every hand is examined
for traces of paraffine. The hand so far has always been a right
hand and the casts show finger-tip markings not like those of any
sitter. The Psychic's husband has a deformed right index-nail which
has never been seen in one of the casts. The end-joint of a finger is
sometimes formed. Two gloves in one unit have been formed, palm
to palm, and both are rights. Similar experiments, with striking per-
fection, have been conducted by Klusky, the Polish (amateur)
medium.
16-B. The Finger-prints. One of the latest experiments has
turned out to be one of the most impressive. We take a plate of
dental wax (called "Kerr") and make it soft by immersion in boiling
water. Every sitter now makes his two thumb-prints on a cake of
the wax and each is labeled with the name of the sitter. A similar
cake, marked for identification, is now put in a shallow dish of hot
water in front of the medium, in trance, under strict conditions of
search and control, in a searched room. After a while Walter says,
"There's my thumb-print for you," and examination of the marked
cake shows a thumb-print which is not that of any sitter. In ad-
dition, five nights later the same experiment shows a print of the
identical thumb as the first night, and still not that of any sitter. In
THB MARGERY MBDIUMSHIP 93
it could be normally obtained, secreted and delivered under the
seance conditions.

the Psychic, a papier-mache pail containing 8 quarts of melted par-
affine on top of 3 or 4 inches of boiling water (making the tempera-
ture 212° when it leaves the kitchen, and 180° at the end of the ex-
periment), and beside this pail a galvanized pail full of cold water.
Through the sitting, under controlled conditions, we hear a lot of
flopping about in both pails as if a large fish were in one or the other.
At the end of the sitting, 30 to 60 minutes, we find in the pail of

"There's my thumb-print for you," and examination of the marked
cake shows a thumb-print which is not that of any sitter. In ad-
dition, five nights later the same experiment shows a print of the
identical thumb as the first night, and still not that of any sitter. In
94 L. R. G. CRANDON
all we have seven prints, six of which are negatives and one a pos-
itive. A Police Captain, who has charge of the finger-print bureau
of criminals in a large city, has been asked to study these prints. He
says that all seven are identical with each other and are not those of
any of the sitters.
If you will reflect upon this simple and yet amazing experiment
you will see that it must form one of the last facts to establish the
presence in the room of a person not one of us.
The clinching factor of uniqueness in this mediumship comes when
three cameras, one on the east, one on the west, and one on the north,
the latter having a fused-quartz lens, record the materializations
which our eyes have seen. Hypnotism and hallucination are thus
eliminated. We have over 100 such photographs.
17. The Subjective Walter. The Margery mediumship is es-
sentially physical in its manifestations. Nevertheless, one cannot
talk night after night, over 500 times, with a voice from the cab-
inet, without feeling acquainted with the intelligent owner of
the voice. In this way, as in every human contact, we have learned
to know and to love the apparent personality which declares itself
to be Walter. From this long period of communication, naturally,
we have picked up bits of information as to the state of being in
which Walter finds himself and get, from time to time, glimpses of
his methods and vistas of his world.
Walter is good-naturedly willing to be called a "secondary per-
sonality," a "hypnotic impersonation", a "mindkin" (C. D. Broad),
a "prosopopesis" (Sudre) or "entelechy" (Driesch). In fact, he
says, "You may call me anything but 'It'!"
Seance action presents three elements :
( 1 ) There is the "prosopo-
pesis" which, genuinely or fictitiously presents the picture of the
presence and activity of a personality from another world. (2)
There is the cryptesthesia, the display of knowledge or abilities which
the medium could not normally own. (3) There is the physical
action, the display of mechanical effects that go beyond what mech-
anistic science can explain.
From an early date this mediumship has been characterized by the
free whispered conversation of the control. Thanks to Dr. Richard-
son, we have proved that over long intervals of the seance, this
whisper is a physico-psychic phenomenon. This brings us to con-
sideration, from the subjective viewpoint, of what Walter says.
His conversation is different from that of the average control, and

sitters find contact with him a correspondingly new experience. He
does not sermonize or pass out messages from one's deceased friends ;
he simply takes a normal part in the social and scientific interplay of
conversation. Believer or unbeliever or straddler, the sitter goes
away with a lively sense of having met Walter.
An ingenious observation of this medium was made by Dr. H. C.
Longwell, Professor of Philosophy at Princeton. He said in effect:
It is apparent that when Walter talks while he is carrying on a phys-
ical experiment, that the talk is distracted like that of anyone who
talks while he works. This proves the doer and the talker to be one.
But we prove by the lashed control that the psychic is not the doer,
hence the psychic is not the talker.
From long experience we feel justified in attempting to classify
the subjective side of the mediumship into four groups:
A. Physical phenomena plus a subjective factor possibly telepathic.
B. Physical phenomena plus a subjective factor from which tele-
pathy is excluded.
C. Pure subjective matter from which telepathy is excluded. The
instances which I shall cite under these headings will be suggestive
of subdivision. Thus, under A, we have a large group of phenomena
which we may classify together as:
A-l : Identification by Walter of objects known to sitter.
This performance has been given at 76 sittings; it is a current
feature, so the number increases weekly. I will not describe again
the control against possible normal knowledge in the totally dark room
by the psychic. Confederacy, the only refuge left the impervious
skeptic, would call for participation by an absurd number of per-
sons not known to Margery prior to their appearance in her seance
room, plus a system of silent signalling between remote parts of the
dark room.
The more thoughtful skeptic will perhaps fall back upon visual
hyperaesthesia. On July 26th, 1925, Mr. Bird was present, but stayed
out of the circle. During the entire seance he stood directly behind
the psychic, controlling her hands by reaching over her shoulders,
and controlling her head when necessary by contact with his own.
His outlook across the circle therefore coincided with hers. The
darkness was such that after an hour, he was still unable to observe
the slightest silhouetting of the sitters at the far side of the circle. If
the psychic can see with her eyes under such conditions, this is itself
a psychic phenomenon.

a psychic phenomenon.

During the period in question, a penknife, a magnifying glass in
a leather case, some paper money, a purse, a hairpin, a shoe and a pair
of scissors were placed on the table by one sitter or another, and all
completely identified by Walter. A commutation ticket was stated
to be a piece of card or paper, and a toothpick to be "too personal"
for naming. No other objects were offered, so there were no failures.
The hairpin was put out when a male sitter, called upon for a con-
tribution, robbed his neighbor to subject Walter to a searching test.
Walter's response was unusually prompt : "Ha, Eddie ; thought you'd
fool me, did you? Laura, pick up your hairpin."
This performance stands apart from most of Walter's identifica-
tions of objects, in that several of the contributions were placed on
the table remote from Margery, the identifications being made ap-
parently by a pseudo-visual process, with no apparent contact. Usual-
ly, several objects are collected in a basket which is placed close to
the psychic, under all control. The objects then, to such degree as
their nature permits, are heard being handled by Walter's teleplasmic
terminals, identification proceeding by what is in part, at least a
tactile process. Errors, though vastly in the minority, are always in-
structive. Thus a card-case and a pocket-book may be mixed; a $20
gold piece was called a half-dollar, the error being at once corrected,
etc.
Walter's treatment of the objects handed out for identification is
always brilliantly consistent with his claims of personal identity. Thus
in dealing with a small barrette, he said that it was from a lady's
hair, but not a comb the failure to name it being decidedly a mas-
culine touch. By failure actually to name an object of recent de-
sign, or in some other detail of his description or comment, he fre-
quently shows a state of knowledge corresponding closely to his date
of death. Doubtless a sufficiently intense study might produce the
same result on a basis of impersonation ; but the showing made here
is an extremely consistent one, and in any event the more direct ex-
planation is easier.

episode, etc. But if we make this confession, it must be understood
that we do so merely as a convention, and not because of absence of
control at critical moments. It must be appreciated that this is a con-
cession, in that an important part of our contact with Walter and our
sense of his presence comes through the living parallelism between
what he does and what he says.
Perhaps the most frequent item under this head arises when Walter
(or a sitter) calls for some piece of apparatus; but nobody knows in
the dark where it is. As an alternative to turning on the red light
and looking for it, Walter often tells us where it is. Lest one think
of this as normal knowledge, the product of careful observation prior
to the seance, I must say that the faculty works with reference to ob-
jects handled by sitters before or during the seance in such a way as
to defeat this explanation.
Remarks like "What are you looking so glum about?" or "Why
the smile?" are often thrown at sitters by Walter and always ac-
knowledged as pertinent. As a measure of the range of this faculty,
we have tried numerous experiments such as holding up a hand and
asking Walter how many fingers are open; and in general he can
answer such questions only after teleplasmic contact. The generali-
zation has been hazarded, and accepted by Walter, that the bodily
conditions which he can sense in a sitter without contact are those
indicating a state of mind.
Yet at times he clearly transgresses this limitation. Thus he re-
marked to a very frequent sitter: "Judge, that's an odd bracelet on
your left arm. There was a bracelet, and none knew it save the
wearer. On another occasion,

Walter knew that the bell-box had
been tampered with in a very specific way; and he made an accusa-
tion of guilt which has never been successfully disproved.
With the identification of objects Walter often displays what we
may best recognize as a psychometric faculty. One of several ob-
jects in the basket for identification is often associated correctly with
one of the sitters, or described in terms of association or use rather
than by name. A clothespin which I deposited so quietly that not
even the person carrying the basket knew of its presence led Walter
to protest against bringing in "this thing from Harvard". It was
in fact one used by the group of young men in their attempt to cast
discredit upon the mediumship.

B-l : Identification by Walter of objects known to no sitter.
The following procedure is employed: Any sitter is permitted to
go out and buy a new pack of cards, bringing it in with him and
taking it to the seance room with the Government seal intact and
without ever letting it pass out of his hands. In the seance room
in total darkness, he breaks the seal and removes cards from the
deck at random, one at a time. He places a card on the table, not
even knowing it is face up or down. Within twenty seconds Walter
names it; the sitter who has placed it recovers it and disposes of it
in such a manner as to make it possible to jot down that the six of
diamonds (say) is now alleged to be in Mr, A's custody. Each sub-
sequent card goes to a different sitter and is duly recorded. The pro-
cess continues until each sitter has a card ; and the explanation by con-
federacy would then require that every person present be in the plot
and that the back pattern of cards to be brought in be known in ad-
vance! In twenty-seven seances, totalling at least 200 separate iden-
tifications, Walter had made no error of any description while using
this method. Once he drew the trade-mark card, and for identifica-
tion read off the one word of large letters Guaranteed which it
carried.
This accident led to another type of experiment. The sitter brings
to the seance any magazine; and in the dark he tears out an adver-
tising page at random and puts this on the table. Within thirty
seconds Walter reads the words of larger type or characterizes the
picture.
The latest development here comes with the introduction by Dr.
Richardson of some large wooden numbers and letters, made for
children's games. They are four inches high and an inch in square
section. When first brought in (January 5th, 1926,) the psychic
did not see them beforehand and did not know what was in the box.
Under strictest control, already described, the utmost leeway for
hand or foot motion is two inches, for the head, three inches. Dr.
Richardson took letters out of the box, in the seance darkness, and
piled them up, without order, in a basket on the floor at the side of
the entranced psychic's feet. One could shortly hear them being
handled, necessarily by the teleplasmic terminals. Walter proceeded
to pick out letters which he needed to spell words and names, the
action being accompanied by running fire of his inimitable humorous
comment. Then he picked out letters at random, naming each as he
threw it at a sitter. Mr. Hill asked for a number if there were one:

THE MARGERY MEDIUMSHIP 99
Walter threw one at him with the statement that it was a "2". The
sitters could not quite tell in the dark whether it was a "2" or a "5"
but later examination showed Walter to be correct. Walter calls
this "his intelligence-test". On this night there were no errors in his
identification. Asked how he did it, he replied: "By feeling them,
just as you do." Occasional errors, as D for O are of a sort to bear
this out. This experiment has been repeated over 100 times. Owing
to the size of the letters, it is easy for a sitter to pick them up and
place them in the basket, grasping one limb of the wooden piece
between two fingers in such a way as to have no idea what character
he is handling. The psychic can not see the letters nor by any pos-
sibility touch them.

present of any given psychical fact of the seance ensemble. Cases
occur, however, usually in connection with derangement of the

incident is

one where an electric mechanism under wrap and seal
was stated by Walter to be inoperative and found to be so. The same
thing recurred in Dr. Comstock's apartment,

in connection with his
contact table. Walter has called attention to the fact that the bell-box
spring was broken ;
he has explained a hiatus in his work by inform-
ing us that the basket was caught between the chair and the cabinet.
In general one must refrain from citing Walter's knowledge of the
outcome of his experiments, in deference to the obvious scientific pro-
prieties; though we look forward to the day when, in mediumships
that have been through the fire as has this one, common admission of
validity will make it possible to study with profit such points as this,
which must today be passed by. But we have one instance where
Walter's knowledge of results was so hopelessly beyond what the
psychic could have known on any theory whatever that it must be
included here.
A photograph was being taken in the hope of showing teleplasmic
formations. At Walter's signal, Mr. Conant discharged the flash-
light, following which, no sitter could do other than wait the devel-

less white blur. One should not insist too strongly upon Walter's
version of what happened to spoil this picture. Upon the super-
normal character of his knowledge that it was spoiled, one must
insist. The psychic knows nothing about photography.
We come now to the incidents where, with no relation to the phys-
ical part of the seances, Walter has displayed a knowledge which the
psychic could not have had. There is a large body of this sort of
thing from the early history of the mediumship which is satisfactory
to me, which I would not cite to another because it involves things
that I or others might conceivably have told the psychic. One recog-
nizes the element of fallibility here, and only mentions it merely

Walter once addressed the recipient of the bracelet item above, in
the words: "Judge, you nearly lost your life today in that taxi in
Park Square. You didn't see how close to the edge you were you
were too busy reading that book/' This described with all precision
an incident of the afternoon, occurring at a time when we are very
certain the psychic was not in Park Square. The Judge and certain
other sitters seem particularly amenable to this sort of thing;
other sitters, whose daily routine would appear to offer much greater
scope for it, seem quite impervious. Undoubtedly the sitter must
make a contribution of some sort in episodes of this character a con-
tribution which with some persons is possible and with others not.
Despite his repugnance to "message bearing," Walter now and
again reports the name and some incident out of the earth life of a
discarnate whom he states to be present for a given sitter. He has
to his credit brilliant successes with total strangers, and no actual
error. With sitters appearing in "Who's Who", he always gives
names and events, sometimes of extreme personal significance, which
could not have been got from the volume named. Once we sat for
over an hour with no phenomena; next night Walter explained that
his whole attention had gone to keeping order among some "wild
women" who had come (from his side) with one of the sitters; and

Mr. J. Malcolm Bird gives permission to cite the following out-
line of his best experience of subjective content with Walter. In two
sittings with another medium, 500 miles from Boston, he encountered
a spirit control who stated himself to be Walter; who in some ways
displayed good Lime Street technique, of a sort not to be got by
reading the literature. At the first opportunity, and with all care to
reveal nothing, Mr. Bird questioned Walter in Lime Street about
this. While refusing to state clearly that it had not been he, Walter
gave the atmosphere of a cryptic denial. But the vital feature was
his knowledge, displayed incidentally in the conversation, of what
occurred in the remote sittings. He knew the medium's name, and
pronounced it correctly, though such feat involves a barbarous an-
glitization of a pure German name, which could not possibly be given
correctly from the mere spelling. He knew the name of a spirit
control who functioned, and in a general way what she did and said.
He has a detailed knowledge of the medium's appearance and man-
nerisms, though Margery had certainly never seen him; and he had
correct general information about the status of another sitter. Finally,
as a sop to the advocate of telepathic interpretation, he gave an es-
timate of this mediumship agreeing in every detail with Mr. Bird's
unexpressed judgment.
C-2: Relation by Walter of facts from outside the seance room,

The new category is made out of deference to those who cannot
agree as to the possible range of telepathy. The best incident is
rather parallel to the last one. A telegram arrived from A. W. G.
in Buffalo: "Ask Walter what night this week, if any, he was in
Buffalo; and what happened". That evening Walter replied: "I was
at the Buffalo Circle Friday; I whistled 'Souvenir;' They may not
have heard it all." A. W. G. comments on this: "During our sit-
ting Friday, three of us heard the first two bars of 'Souvenir* ap-
parently from no mouth in the room." Possibilities of collusion are
sufficient to prevent this narrative from attaining first scientific rank ;
but it suggests possible future experiments under better control.

ting in his own car; he failed to appear. During the seance there
were noises in the street, obviously from an automobile but other-
wise indeterminate. Walter said: "Your friend is at the door. He
came in a taxi. (Contrary to expectation). He looks like a woolly
bear. He looked at the house and went away ; but he will be back."
(prediction). Ten minutes later Dr. S. rang the bell. His car had
broken down ; he had finished the trip by taxi ; uncertain of the house
number, he looked in vain for a door-plate; then he drove around
the corner to consult a directory. He wore a shaggy new fur coat.
D. Coming to group D, where the possibility of telepathic expla-
nation does not exist, we face a difficult problem. In the absence of a
careful staging, with careful elimination of all possibility that any
living person may know the facts involved, we cannot come into this
classification save through predictive incidents. We have never at-
tempted this elaborate staging, and hence are reduced to such episodes
of prevision as the three years of the mediumship afford. They are
numerous ;
but few or none are free from obvious weak points. The
one that comes nearest to the standard is Walter's prediction (June,
1924) that one of the intimate circle would "pass over" inside four
months, realized through the death of Mr. Alexander W. Cross in
September, Over seventy times in sixteen months Walter has said
concerning a sitter of the early days of the mediumship: "Give him
my love and tell him I will see him soon." He is now dead.
In classes A and B, control of the psychic is of paramount im-
portance. Once it is clear that such control is adequate, the super-
normality of these elements is established. For classes A and C
we have to consider the telepathic possibility. But taking these
classes on their merits, it seems to me that telepathy is a harder ex-
planation than either of the alternatives:
(1) That there is at work an extension of physical perception
something to which the term metagnomy is applicable; or (2) That
we have to do with a separate entity, freed from certain of the phys-
ical limitations which circumscribe our own apperceptive powers.
When we line these groups up beside B and D, the inadequacy of
the telepathic theory to cover all that occurs reacts upon its accept-
ability as covering a fraction of what occurs. As for these two latter
groups, the alternatives which they present are somewhat different.
Apparently we are to choose between: (3) A form of cognitive
exaltation in the living psychic, the exercise of which is usually un-
recognized; or (4) A thinking entity, functioning consciously on a

ting in his own car; he failed to appear. During the seance there
were noises in the street, obviously from an automobile but other-
wise indeterminate. Walter said: "Your friend is at the door. He
came in a taxi. (Contrary to expectation). He looks like a woolly
bear. He looked at the house and went away; but he will be back."
(prediction). Ten minutes later Dr. S. rang the bell. His car had
broken down; he had finished the trip by taxi; uncertain of the house
number, he looked in vain for a door-plate; then he drove around
the corner to consult a directory. He wore a shaggy new fur coat.
D. Coming to group D, where the possibility of telepathic expla-
nation does not exist, we face a difficult problem. In the absence of a
careful staging, with careful elimination of all possibility that any
living person may know the facts involved, we cannot come into this
classification save through predictive incidents. We have never at-
tempted this elaborate staging, and hence are reduced to such episodes
of prevision as the three years of the mediumship afford. They are
numerous; but few or none are free from obvious weak points. The
one that comes nearest to the standard is Walter's prediction (June,
1924) that one of the intimate circle would "pass over" inside four
months, realized through the death of Mr. Alexander W. Cross in
September. Over seventy times in sixteen months Walter has said
concerning a sitter of the early days of the mediumship: "Give him
my love and tell him I will see him soon." He is now dead.
In classes A and B, control of the psychic is of paramount im-
portance. Once it is clear that such control is adequate, the super-
normality of these elements is established. For classes A and C
we have to consider the telepathic possibility. But taking these
classes on their merits, it seems to me that telepathy is a harder ex-
planation than either of the alternatives:

something to which the term metagnomy is applicable; or (2) That

plane where the time factor operates differently from here; where
perhaps time constitutes a new dimension, rather than an inflexible in-
dication of mere sequence.
If we elect alternative (3) here, we still need the remarks about
the time factor from (4). At this point we find ourselves come to a
conclusion: that in our metapsychic field we have use and necessity
for the latest developments of orthodox science. And we see that
these relativistic doctrines are quite as essential to the spiritistic phil-
osophy, that they harmonize quite as strongly with it, as when super-
imposed upon the prosopopetical dogma. The advantage which comes
to prosopopesis from ultra modern physics and mathematics belongs
no less to spiritism.
The experiments along the lines suggested are well-nigh infinite.
These experiments present a side of the Margery mediumship which
is only just beginning. Taken with the mechanical demonstration
that Walter's voice is independent of the psychic's anatomy and
physiology, and with all the other advances which we make from
time to time in the physical aspect of the investigation, this holds out
a new and strong suggestion of the presence in the room of an in-
telligence not any part of any sitter. This intelligence, we know,
functionates in a state of being so different from the one in which
we consciously act that we have only today discovered it, and still
have the utmost difficulty in seeking a glimmer of comprehension
of it.
In reply to the inevitable questions asked of Walter by the hun-
dreds of persons who have met him in the seance room, he has from
time to time given us glimpses of his state of existence and his sur-
roundings, as he would have us picture them. The dominant note
here is his insistence upon the substantial continuity between our
present life and the one into which he says he has passed. His
mental outlook includes ours but goes a little further; his physical
or super-physical world includes ours but goes a little beyond it in
such elements as those of sense-machinery and dimensionality. He
once put this every cleverly when, in response to a sitter's query:
"Do you use our landscape, Walter?" he shot back: "No; you use
ours!" He disclaims any crucial difference between his state of
knowledge and ours, denies anything approaching omniscience; al-
leging that he, too, is to a large degree experimenting.
Many of the vistas which he gives us into what he presents as the
life beyond the grave should be of extreme interest to the modern

physicist and mathematician; for they carry large connotations of a
relativistic scheme of things. So strong is this element, we are told
by an authority in the two fields of relativity and psychic research,
that one ignorant of seance room phenomena but acquainted with the
work of Einstein and Minkowski would prophesy that many of the
things occurring in the seance room ought to be found among the
phenomena of our world. Perhaps of equal significance is another
fact to which attention is with increasing emphasis being drawn. In
its ideas of progressive atonement for earthly errors, in a picture
of an intermediate state to which the name of purgatory seems al-
most applicable. In many other details the philosophy which Walter
would have us accept as dominating thought and conduct in his world
shows a parallelism to orthodox Catholic theology, as striking as its
physical parallelism with the newest concepts of time and space.
The philosophers from the Greeks to the present day tell us that
this is a world of phenomena, of appearances, and behind the appear-
ances, which our senses bring to us, there is a reality. But our senses
are all we have to live by and if we believe them in the ordinary
affairs of life, we must in the seance room. We know that that which
appears solid is not so, that each atom is a universe of protons and
electrons, that of a given solid object only one-millionth part is mat-
ter and the rest is space, comparable to the distance between the stars.
Our poor eyes see from the red to violet but we have very definite
knowledge of a world of light beyond the violet. The quartz lens
camera shows us constantly objects which the eye has not seen. In
this field also are the X-ray and many therapeutic rays, wholly in-
visible to the human eye. The manifestations of the seance room
are childish entertainment, unless true. The truth is one. We feel
bound to go on recording.
In an original poem, Walter puts it thus :
"There is a plan far greater than the one you know,
There is a landscape broader than the one you see."

The final big question that must arise in every mind is: "Well,

^tory of man's knowledge of the universe. Before facts, one must
sit as a little child.
2. Psychic research establishes apparent facts, however, not only
of the tangible material world but of a world outside our senses, the
psychic realm of the human entity. That almost untrodden region
calls to the intrepid explorer "Come, search me, and find me out, for
in me is the secret of that which never dies."
There is nothing more likely than that in the honest, patient study
of this subject, may ultimately be found a solution, scientifically
sound, of the problem of the continuance of the conscious entity be-
yond the change called death, a problem hitherto relegated to the
dominion of pure faith.
3. But wholly disregarding the side of this problem that points
towards individual survival and return, there is a soul-stirring
glimpse of man's possible future powers granted us. In the proved
production in a few minutes of these teleplasmic hands and intel-
ligent terminals, we get a sudden vision of an apparent creation of
matter. The spirit and human will, whether it be resident in the
medium or a spirit entity, causes under our eyes the apparent pro-
duction of solid matter. The architect conceives the cathedral, and
it is laboriously made real. The mother conceives the child and in
due time it is there. Some spirit, here or there, in the cabinet, con-
ceives and wills the materialization of part or the whole of the human
apparition. It is there for scientific measurement and study.
4. Psychic Research has about as much to do with religion as golf.
Nevertheless, it is going to be one of the most important factors in
changing not religion but religious concepts and beliefs. The end
will be good but the interim unsettling.
Science is bankrupt at the edge of the grave. Religion only offers
a sleepy comfort. Psychic research will not only kill Materialism
which is already dying, but knock out Agnosticism which is the pre-
valent condition of our college graduate. It will prove that man
is a spirit, that the whole universe is spiritual, that matter is spirit
attuned to vibrations which our bodily senses can perceive in our
present state of development; that death of the body is a biologic and
chemical change and not a religious or holy affair except in the way
that a birth, a graduation, a marriage is sacred, or holy, or im-
portant. The critics of psychic research are the same old gang who
tortured and burnt the free-thinker; they are the members of the

"The grandest sport in the world is to champion an unpopular cause
when you know you are right.*'
"Vast, indeed, and difficult is the inquirer's prospect here and the
most significant data for his advance will probably be just these
dingy little mediumistic facts which the scientific minds of our time
find so unworthy of their attention. But when was not a science
of the future stirred to its conquering activities by the little rebellious
exceptions to the science of the present? It is through following
these facts I am persuaded, that the greatest scientific conquests are
about to be achieved."
Bergson, in his fine presidential address to the Society for Psy-
chical Research, 1913, said that he had sometimes wondered what
would have happened if modern science, instead of setting out from
mathematics, instead of bringing all its forces to converge on the
study of matter, had begun by the consideration of mind ;
if Kepler,
Galileo, and Newton, for instance, had been psychologists, we should
certainly have had a psychology of which today we can form no idea,
any more than before Galileo we could have imagined what our phys-
ics would be; a psychology that probably would have been to our
present psychology what our physics is to Aristotle's. Foreign to
every mechanistic idea, not even conceiving the possibility of such an
explanation, science would have inquired into, instead of dismissing
a priori, facts such as those which we study; perhaps psychical re-
search would have stood out as its principal preoccupation. The most
general laws of mental activity once discovered (as in fact the fun-
damental laws of mechanics were discovered), we should have passed
from mind, properly so-called to life. Biology would have been
developed as a science, but a vital biology, quite different from ours,
which would have sought behind the sensible forms of living beings
the inward, invisible force of which the sensible forms are the
manifestations.
"We should have gone very far in what at present we call the un-
known or the occult, but we should have known less of physics,
chemistry, or mechanics, unless which is very probable, we should
have come upon them by another road as we travelled round the

"It is true that by deliberately rejecting everything that does not
bear the stamp of mathematical or judicial certainty, we risk losing,
as we go along, most of the opportunities or clues which the great
riddle of this world offers, using its moments of inattention or gra-
ciousness. At the beginning of our inquiry we must know how to
content ourselves with little.
"Think of it. It would be monstrous and inexplicable that we
should be only what we appear to be, nothing but ourselves, whole
and complete in ourselves, separated, isolated, circumscribed by our
bodies, our consciousness, our birth, and our death. We become
possible and probable only on the conditions that we project beyond
ourselves on every side, and that we stretch in every direction through-
out time and space."
We bespeak, therefore, from you, the "open mind." "In my
Father's house are many mansions" has become almost scientific. For
the scientist today talks of a world not only of three dimensions but
of many more. He talks of infinites. The last thing that the scien-
tist will say if he is a true one is: "The thing is impossible."
If one is a true scientist, then, the whole problem of life after
death must be approached with a completely open mind. "Nature
has far more secrets to reveal than have yet been disclosed. One of
the most characteristic achievements of science has been to prove
to us that things are not what they seem. To the ordinary mind,
the most real reality is what we see and touch. But that may not
be the most real reality at all. To a more accurate seeing, the most
real reality may be thought, purpose and will. Consider for a mo-
ment. The countless things that make up our humanly constructed
world are created by thought, purpose and will. Is not the Creator
likely to be far more real than the created?
"What, now, is an individual person? He is a focus, so to speak,

will they take? We do not yet know. Death may usher them to a
complete re-birth from which all memory of the past has vanished,
or it may usher them to a re-birth from which only part of the past
has vanished. We do not know.

the coming years will be to look for all possible evidence of the ways

the scientists who were too dogmatic ,to admit psychic research into
the holy of holies of science. The true scientist will be fearless
enough to follow along James's trail. He will eagerly search in the
region of supernormal phenomena for evidences for and against sur-
vival after death.
"At present I do not believe that we have come to the point where
we can say that anything has been 100% proved scientifically, for or
against. Science, however, is emerging from its period of materialism.
It is realizing that there is a profounder reality than so-called mat-
ter. It is, therefore, not impossible to believe that through accurate
experimentation with supernormal psychical phenomena, we shall be
able to tell, with some measure of precision, what happens, through
death, to this most real reality of all which we call the human per-
sonality."
As for us, we are not propagandists for a "new revelation." We
do not seek the support of all the world. Our recompense is to have
grasped new truths, to have delved deeper into the great mystery of
the nature of the mind. We would wish, however, to have a scien-
tific audience. We demand only a simple effort of good will yes,
let us say it, of honesty ; for it is not honest to deny without trying to
examine fairly. And to the dogmatist, we offer this last word of
Claude Bernard: "The truly scientific mind ought to make us
moderate and tolerant. We all know, in reality, very little about
things, and we are all fallible in the face of the immense difficulties
involved in the investigation of natural phenomena."
As Driesch puts it, "We are in the Galvani period: facts without
explanation. We want to enter the Faraday period : laws established

let us say it, of honesty; for it is not honest to deny without trying to
examine fairly. And to the dogmatist, we offer this last word of
Claude Bernard : "The truly scientific mind ought to make us
moderate and tolerant. We all know, in reality, very little about
things, and we are all fallible in the face of the immense difficulties
involved in the investigation of natural phenomena."
As Driesch puts it, "We are in the Galvani period: facts without
explanation. We want to enter the Faraday period : laws established

A SUBJECTIVE STUDY OF DEATH
BY MARY AUSTIN
No one making a cursory survey of the various modes of research
by which it is modernly attempted to demonstrate the continuity of
individual existence beyond death can fail to be struck by the fact
that they are practically all of them based upon the evidence of direct
communication with the survivors. Nowhere is there any extended
inquiry into the possible relation of survival to the crisis of death,
nor to the quality of the psyche upon which survival is predicated.
In this we violate all the natural logic of every other current form
of psychic research.
It cannot be denied that the individual interest would naturally
take the form of ardently desiring communication with the beloved
-dead, nor that such interest tends to give an acute public attention to
this department of inquiry. But it is not natural for us in any other
crisis of living to insist on the ability to return to a previous con-
dition as an indispensable evidence of progression. The new born
child returns not to the womb, nor does the adult become a child
again, however many the lapses of memory between those states.
History denies neither the past nor the future on the ground that
they do not occur simultaneously in our consciousness; nor is the
evolution of man through an endless chain of physical life refuted by
our individual unawareness of such evolution at any given epoch of it.
What we do assume of all these stages of being, individual or racial,
is that, rightly studied, they yield prophetic or reminiscent evidence of
continuity, informing not only to the observer, but to the recipient.
Before birth the child stirs ; modern psychology is now insisting that
it receives impressions which modify after-birth experiences. Before
puberty there are both physical and mental alterations of so pro-
nounced a character that it becomes our chief educational concern to
handle them. Is it not logical to suppose that there might be notice
of the nature of the approaching change, quite as important to be
studied as anything which might be imagined to occur after bodily
dissolution has taken place?

I do not now refer to reflexes, due to illness, arising in the gradual

process of physical breakdown. Since we are profoundly convinced
of the absolute resolution of the body to its chemical components,
we must regard survival as purely subjective in its nature ; so much so
that the failure of that subjective part of us to demonstrate itself
by objective phenomena after death can never be accepted as proof
positive of the failure of survival. But in a general way the altera-
tions of the individual during adolescence are so far subjective that
any delay in the appearance of the characteristic subjectivity of ado-
lescence is regarded as abnormal, just as failure of the stir of unborn
life is so regarded.
Assuming that we have a right to be as logical about death as
about any other human experience, let us consider whether there may
not be interior evidence of the nature of death, which can be sub-
jected to the same scientific scrutiny we have lately given to the nature
of adolescence. What phenomena of the spirit, in anticipation of the
crisis called death, do we observe which may be indicative of the
future of that spirit in the same way that the psychology of adolescence
indicates the future of the living individual ?
Inevitably such a study would concern itself with the subjective
consciousness of man, with whatever part of him might be supposed
to be capable of going on independently of the material frame and
its purely objective existence. Such study would normally concern
itself, first of all, with the origins of consciousness, and with its modes
of progression. Should the intense and scholarly inquiry which is
being pursued continuously, result in any positive knowledge of the
nature and origin of consciousness, it would undoubtedly be found to
bear directly upon the problem of survival. But pending such il-
lumination, in what other direction and by what methods could in-
quiry profitably be made? Where shall we look, in the nature of
living man, what shall we look for, and by what marks shall we
identify and how interpret interior evidence of the continuity of
man's livingness?
The writer, having spent many years under circumstances that
afforded a more than ordinary acquaintance with the ways of animals,
and with people whose trade is about animals, both domestic and
wild, would begin such a study with the death customs and behaviors
of the younger brothers of mankind. That animals can die of psychic
shock such shock as is frequently the result of capture and captivity
even under great kindness and real anxiety on the part of the captor
to induce them to live is well known. That animals have difficulty

in understanding death as an objective reality any one can convince
himself who has opportunity to observe ewes returning again and
again to the decaying clot of hide and bones which was once a lamb,
or watch a dog trying to warm her drowned puppy into living re-
sponse. That the lower animals can subjectively appreciate death to
the point of actually seeking it as a release has been so definitely
asserted by hunters and naturalists, that it deserves to be brought
under the kind of scrutiny that would reduce the assertion to fact.
That animals kill one another out of deliberate enmity and with no
reference to food is as well known as that they grieve themselves to
death over the loss of a mate or a master. That animals in peril have
somehow managed to disturb the minds of their masters at the mo-
ment of dissolution we have a number of instances related by people
whose word would be taken unquestioningly on any other matter.
One of these, which I believe has also appeared in print, I had from
Sir Rider Haggard; another from a friend, in which the certainty of
disaster to a valued horse arrived at the threshold of his own con-
sciousness several hours after the horse had died, having cast itself in
its stall. All such phenomena should be brought under the most rigid
evidential scrutiny, particularly that one which links them closest
with the Dawn-man: the difficulty in recognizing death as a reality.
The widespread existence of death-origin legends is of itself evi-
dence that man came into full consciousness of himself prepossessed
of the belief that death is a kind of natural accident, needing to be
accounted for, and with reluctance accepted as inevitable for every-
body. In almost every tribe where death legends occur it is also
possible to find legends which indicate belief in the equal naturalness
of escape from death, by favored individuals. In the majority of
such cases, death is made contingent upon the violation of some
sort of condition completely integrated with the human environment.
Among American Indians, with whose myths the writer is widely
conversant, there are many death origin tales which are sufficiently
ancient to indicate that they arose out of a still earlier notion that
death happened only to the body, that the inner man, the real man,
the one who continues his adventures while the body is asleep, had
simply gone away and neglected to come back. There are still in
existence rites indicating that there was an almost universal belief
among Dawn-men that life could be coaxed back to the empty ten-
ement, that it was of itself indestructible. To this day the American
Indian placates the ever-living life of the quarry he is about to kill

It would be interesting to have all this material set in order with a
view to realizing how far the idea of death, as involving discon-
tinuence, is instinctive to man, or to what extent it is a rationaliza-
tion of later observations. Such a labour would include a satisfactory
resolution of two elements that in our thinking about death, at pres-
ent, appear irreconcilable: the general fear of death, and the occa-
sional high hearted scorn of it. So far as my own study among
primitives has carried me, it goes to show that the fear of death dim-
inishes as we work back to the Dawn-man; and willingness to lay
down life for an idea, for an emotion, for pure willfulness, increases.
Too many accounts of savages deliberately dying, apparently by willing
rather than by doing violence to the body, have been brought to us
from widely unrelated tribes, not to oblige us to accept them serious-
ly. It is well known among those acquainted with the less sophis-
ticated peoples, that the power of predicting their own deaths is a
matter of equally wide diffusion, and that both the power of dying
and predicting death are found among peoples who have no well de-
fined notion of survival and not much interest in it.
Almost as far back, and surely to be collated with this easy, un-
afraid individual handling of death, rises the concept of the voluntary
laying down of life as meritorious. This is probably older than the
contrary idea of the evil of suicide. So also is the idea of the ex-
ceptional individual who can both lay down his life and take it up
again. I have never been quite satisfied with the explanation of these
ideas as a development of incidental observations of trance, coma
and similar conditions. The idea that to lay down life for others
is of the highest order of merit is the stuff out of which Christ myths
are made. That unforgetable sergeant in the late war who called out
to his men, "Come on you do you want to live forever?" was not
rationalizing. He was acting upon and appealing to one of the
deepest seated motive impulses in human nature, universally esteemed.
It is here, I think, in the study of our own universal approval of the
voluntary movement toward discarnation, and our own universal
disapproval of any form of conscious shrinking from it, that the sub-
jective study of death can be profitably begun. Does not the dis-
position of man, given sufficiently exigent conditions, to choose death
rather than life, suggest that back, far back of the rationalizing
power, behind the furthest reach of conscious thinking, Spirit, which

power, behind the furthest reach of conscious thinking, Spirit, which
A SUBJECTIVE STUDY OF DEATH 115
found its way into life without either self-consciousness or intellect,
knows how to find its way safely out. The question here of how
much of its equipment of intellect and self consciousness the individual
Spirit may leave behind in such a transition is unimportant. Sup-
posing there is an indestructible spirit in man, would not that inde-
structibility know itself? And would it then really fear death any
more than it fears sleep, of which it knows nothing when it comes
into this life? Would not the fear of death, in so far as it is
not the artificial by-product of myth making about a future life,
prove to be the fear merely of loosing this dear baggage of personality,
feeling, memory, and use? These are aspects of the death crisis that
I should like to see adequately dealt with by inquiring science.
Along with this new study of man's failure to realize death as the
inevitable close to existence, should go a fresh inspection of his idea
of resurrection. Folkloreists have generally conceded the derivation
of the resurrection myth from nature rites, intended to aid the recur-
rent springing of the crop from the buried seed. But the existence
of resurrection myths, myths, at least, of man resuming his life after
having parted with it, among peoples who are still in the hunting
stage, and without any ritualized spring ceremony, seems to indicate
that the assimilation of the ideas of seasonal recurrence and of life
resumption came later than the original idea of bodily life as a thing
assumed by the spirit for its convenience. "O Younger Brother,"
said Cushing's friend of the water turtle, "It can not die, it can
but change its house." What I should like to know is, how far this
notion of bodily life as assumed can be trusted as an original in-
knowing or intuitive concept of man about himself.
Three other items of the manner in which the dawn-mind has
dealt with death could profitably be brought under such a scrutiny
as I have in mind ; one of which has scarcely been noted in this con-
nection, and otherwise marked with an emphasis which in the light
of modern psychology, appears misapplied.
The first of these is the disposition toward making a good end, as
illustrated by death rites performed either by the individual in ex-
tremis, or on his behalf. Historically such rites long antedate the
codified faiths which have become attached to them, as in the Catholic
right of Extreme Unction, which is relegated by scholars to Mid-
Asian, pre-Christian antiquity. Everywhere among primitives we
find the moment of death encrusted with rites which can be resolved
into the supposition that the passage of the psyche from life to death

Asian, pre-Christian antiquity. Everywhere among primitives we
find the moment of death encrusted with rites which can be resolved
into the supposition that the passage of the psyche from life to death
116 MARY AUSTIN
is an occasion of great peril, and that the frame of mind in which this
passage is attempted, bears importantly upon the chances of survival.
All religious rituals in general may be said to objectify the search
for effective states of mind. They might fairly be described as self pre-
servative gestures of the psyche. How then does the psyche come by
this notion that it can be assisted in death by induced states? Why,
if annihilation is natural and foregone, should the self preserving in-
stinct work upon it at all ? A study of the subjective element in rites
designed to assist the disengaging spirit would be indispensable to
such an inquiry as I have postulated.
Two other notions bearing upon independent spirit existence, com-
ing a little later and widely distributed among human kind, are the
ideas of ordeal or judgment undergone by the recently dead, and the
idea of survival as an achievement.
Both of these may have developed naturally out of that earlier idea
which is embodied in the death-song and other expressions of a belief
in the power of the state of mind in which death is encountered, to
affect the welfare of the soul to which death is about to happen. If
they have so developed, then surely, the availing death rite has a much
greater validity than we have been disposed to give to it.
The whole history of the Christian faith can be summed up as the
fluctuations of belief about the nature of the saving rite and an
achieved survival. How can we then lightly discard an idea so pro-
foundly conceived and so universally entertained as that of the saving
death rite, as revealing nothing whatever of the nature of the episode
around which the rite arranges itself? If we look confidently, as mod-
ern psychology does look, for intimations of life-possibility in the sub-
consciousness of the adolescent, if we are willing to trust the issues of
marriage and the family on what we find indicated in folk ways and
lore, why not make at least the same gesture toward a possible con-
firmation of survival in the folk attitude toward death?
This raises at once the question of the evidential nature of the
widespread belief in survival. That it is indicated as universal does
not prove that the wish does not give rise to the belief. But there
are two or three items to be taken into account before we conclude
that wish fulfillment is the only element that enters into man's idea of
a Hereafter. The first of these is that man's early imaginings of the
life beyond this life, do not, for the most part, represent anything
that the people who produced them, really wished for. Nothing,
for instance, could have been more unacceptable to the Greek tern-

for instance, could have been more unacceptable to the Greek tern-
A SUBJECTIVE STUDY OF DEATH 117
perament than the vague, drab Hades of its mythology, nothing more
boring to the sensuous Mediterranean than the Heaven he hymns.
And has not the modern Christian world definitely rebelled against
both its Heaven and its Hell, finding them equally undesirable,
without disturbing the general Christian confidence in survival?
It is easy to show that the social conditions that produced the most
explicit Heaven and Hell, conceived of as definite places, embodying
a circumscribed existence, are furthest from the instinctive states that
are supposed by those who adhere to the wish-fulfillment explanation,
to have given rise to them. Much more likely to have arisen out of
the deep seated wish is the idea of direct communication with the
beloved dead. But before we can lightly dismiss the wish as evidence,
we have to demonstrate than man can wish for anything not in his
destiny. Is not the power of wishing in itself an intimation of in-
evitable fulfillment, a germ of inescapable accomplishment?
There is another group of associated phenomena which has never
been interrogated for the light it can throw on the catastrophe if
we are so to regard it? of discarnation. In this group there are
three items of fairly consistent occurrence throughout the history of
human experience. The first of these is the nature of the wound to the
psyche of the bereaved. The second is the well authenticated, though
modernly infrequent, warning or notice of death psychically received
by friends or relatives at a distance; and the third is the illusion or
perhaps it is a fact of psychic readjustment between the departed
and the bereaved, than which there is no better attested phenomenon.
The wound of bereavement shows itself in the period of the dawn-
mind. That the lower animals have been known to grieve them-
selves to death in the loss of the mate or master, has already been
noted. I do not find this sort of thing sufficiently accounted for as
shock, particularly as it seems to take place when no lesion can be
proven, and does not take place except when there is a liason of in-
timacy between the living and the recently dead. Properly inter-
rogated, this not unusual sequential occurrence should yield some
information as to the nature of the psyche, which if not directly
bearing on the problem of survival, would serve to explain the more
frequent and less understood experiences of readjustment.
Anyone, by a little inquiry among his friends, may hear some ac-
count of this, which is described as a flooding interpenetration of the
living personality by the personality of the dead, taking place often
within a day or two after death, though usually deferred until the

And has not the modern Christian world definitely rebelled against
both its Heaven and its Hell, finding them equally undesirable,
without disturbing the general Christian confidence in survival?
It is easy to show that the social conditions that produced the most
explicit Heaven and Hell, conceived of as definite places, embodying
a circumscribed existence, are furthest from the instinctive states that
are supposed by those who adhere to the wish-fulfillment explanation,
to have given rise to them. Much more likely to have arisen out of
the deep seated wish is the idea of direct communication with the
beloved dead. But before we can lightly dismiss the wish as evidence,
we have to demonstrate than man can wish for anything not in his
destiny. Is not the power of wishing in itself an intimation of in-
evitable fulfillment, a germ of inescapable accomplishment?
There is another group of associated phenomena which has never
been interrogated for the light it can throw on the catastrophe-if
we are so to regard it ?~f discarnation. In this group there are
three items of fairly consistent occurrence throughout the history of
human experience. The first of these is the nature of the wound to the
psyche of the bereaved. The second is the well authenticated, though
modernly infrequent, warning or notice of death psychically received
by friends or relatives at a distance; and the third is the illusion~r
perhaps it is a fact:--of psychic readjustment between the departed
and the bereaved, than which there is no better attested phenomenon.
The wound of bereavement shows itself in the period of the dawn-
mind. That the lower animals have been known to grieve them-
selves to death in the loss of the mate or master, has already been
noted. I do not find this sort of thing sufficiently accounted for as
shock, particularly as it seems to take place when no lesion can be
proven, and does not take place except when there is a liason of in-
timacy between the living and the recently dead. Properly inter-
rogated, this not unusual sequential occurrence should yield some
information as to the nature of the psyche, which if not directly
bearing on the problem of survival, would serve to explain the more
frequent and less understood experiences of readjustment.
Anyone, by a little inquiry among his friends, may hear some ac-
count of this, which is described as a flooding interpenetration of the
living personality by the personality of the dead, taking place often
within a day or two after death, though usually deferred until the
118 MARY AUSTIN
first shock of grief is past. There is a reawakened sense of apprecia-
tion, a renewal of intimacy, often accompanied by sudden illumina-
tion of traits and incidents never before understood. One hears this
experience frequently summed up in the phrase "my friend was never
so near me". Sometimes this sense of nearness amounts to a con-
viction of presence that, without producing any of the phenomena of
automatism which have attracted so much attention of late, leads to
belief in communication. Many people are incited to resort to me-
diums in the first place by this haunting, teasing intimation of in-
completed communication.
So far we have glibly dismissed these universal phenomena attend-
ing the wresting away of a living psyche from our midst, as incidents
of the mechanical readjustment of the life habit. And yet much of
what we generally believe about the relation of death to life, is drawn
from the experience of such loss by death. Would not a re-examina-
tion of such experience, dealing with death as a reality, and dis-
tinguishing between that reality and the emotions it gives rise to,
yield some such equivalent illumination as has been thrown by modern
psychology on the process of our dreams, or on the parental relation ?
Might not the reality of survival be discovered as were the asteroids,
by intelligent scrutiny of the void in which it has so far occurred.
In the same spirit there should be a new consideration of the
legendary lore of survival. No people is without an accumulation
of incident, passing itself off for fact, relative to reappearances and
communications of the dead to the living. What is singular and im-
portant is the general alikeness of such incidents for all tribes and
races. Supposing, as many psychologists do, that the experiences be-
hind all the ghosts stories in the world, take place within the sub-
jective consciousness of the person to whom they appear to happen,
what is the nature of this subjectivity, which is able to produce the
same type of objective presentation of itself among the least and the
most intellectual tribes? Take, for example, the world wide notion
that something of the personality of the victim "haunts" the scene of
a violent death? Notice that in all these tales it is not the murderer
but the murdered who does the haunting. Any professional maker
of tales knows that there can be no tale without some interior motion
of the psyche to set it going and give it form. What is the psychic
start behind the multifarious tales of hauntings? Is it in any way
related to that other idea of death as an occasion of peril, requiring
special rites for its safe negotiations? Or, consider the innumerable

stories of the protection afforded to our own personal crisis, by some
one of the dear dead.
I recall one such experience arising not on my own behalf, but in
the interest of another person, occurring in the middle of a crowded
afternoon on Fifth Avenue, in which the mother of a boy I had never
seen before or after, seemed to appear not only to me but to another
passing stranger with an absolutely arresting reality. In this case
there was not even a emotional reflex out of which the intimation of
presence might arise.
Can we in any way derive the practice of ancestor worship from
the sort of experiences that give rise to such presentments? Primitive
man, as his literature shows, is notably lacking in invention. His good
tales as well as his devil tales also come from the same place that his
dreams come. The concept of helpful ancestral spirits is not of the
class of invented myths, such as that the thunder is caused by a great
bird flapping its wings or a great man swinging a hammer. It be-
longs in the group of origin tales arising out of subjective experience,
out of unsatisfied egoism or sex suppressions or other unidentified
movements of the subconscious. All such experiences are more and
more shown to be the inverted shadows of subjective realities which,
by the aid of psychoanalysis, can be definitely placed. Curiously, no
one has yet undertaken to place this group of shadows around the
reality of death. If it could have the undivided attention of the psy-
chologists to the degree that the psychic reactions of the love-life have
had it, would not our yield of understanding be proportionately re-
warding? For death is quite as much of a fact as sex, quite as likely
to disguise its actuality in myths and hallucinations, myths of haunt-
ings, of resurrections, subjective presentments of seeing and hearing.
All this seems to me much more important than the sort of thing
that is now claiming the attention of investigators. Whether or not
our discarnate friends can hark backward to us over the dividing
line is relatively unimportant compared with the discovery of the
quality and conditions of the adventure by which survival is ac-
complished. One thing we know and one only: that if there is
another existence beyond the gate of death, we go through from
Here to There. Is it not from Here, then, that the adventure can be
soundly predicated?

It has been said that a man is known by the company he keeps-
but the saying may not hold good of a woman. At any rate, I can-
not be "known", intellectually or philosophically, when I speak upon
psychical research from a platform which has been honored by the

flecting upon what I want to say, I wondered why I had been in-

and his washerwoman. Moliere, anxious to know how the average
mil'ld regarded his theme, was in the habit of reading his plays aloud
to this simple person, and asking her what she thought of them ...
In relation to the subject to be discussed, the Department of Psy-
chology of Clark University has, after listening to experts, invited
the washerwoman,-and the reason is obvious: her comment upon
the hypothesis of man's survival of bodily death, will be that of the
average mind.
If to such minds is put the question: "Is there any evidence that
when a man dies he shall live again ?"-there will be many different
answers. One may be, "Immortality? Heaven ?-Oh, let's talk of
something pleasant!" Or: "Evidence? Bosh I There isn't any."
Or: "The teaching of my church is 'evidence' enough for me I" {Of
course, that sort of belief is easy, just in proportion to the ability of

"Neither was any man known to return from the grave.

Which, being extinguished, the body shall be turned to ashes,
122 MARGARET DELAND
And the spirit shall be dispersed into thin air,
And our life shall pass away as the traces of a cloud."
To a mind of this nature, survival is an unthinkable hypothesis be-
cause it is certain that there cannot be personality without an or-
ganism. Until recently I, too, was 'certain.' As long ago as my
early thirties, I had realized that, though my church asserted its be-
lief in the "resurrection of the dead," covering the statement on Eafcter
Sunday with flowers and setting it in crashes of joyous music, the
belief itself was not, to most Christians, a very real thing. If it
were, I reasoned, grief would not be the hideous thing it is, for Love
is unselfish enough to be glad of any joy that comes to the beloved.
But nobody was glad, except yes; except a certain Swedenborgian
mother I knew, who, when her only son lay dead in the house, wiped
her eyes and smiled, and said, "Course, I'm lonely. . But I'm so
happy, because I keep thinking what a good time George is having!"
But I never knew anyone else who was happy under such circum-
stances, and George's mother's faith seemed to me beautiful and
foolish. For how, I asked myself, could she know that George was
"having a good time?" or that he was, at all! So far as proof went,
her premise that he was alive would not, as George himself would
probably have expressed it, "hold water". Certainly, if "George"
was the energetic body the big, dear, sturdy body then the premise
was wrong, for the body was dead. In that shaded upper room, it
was lying still. Dust to dust. Ashes to ashes. No George. Yet she
was "so happy"! I knew that I would not have been happy, with-
out proof that George could be George without his body. Not
having that proof, I believed that "our life passes away as the traces
of a cloud." I am afraid I was not agnostic about it; I was rather
aggresively sure that survival was an unthinkable hypothesis. It
never occurred to me to investigate my own premise: 'there cannot
be personality without an organism.' Such investigation meant, I
thought, spiritualism and the very word irritated me. It stood, in
my mind, for trivialities and vulgarities; for mediumistic utterances,
often offensive to taste, and frequently accompanied by clap-trap as
old as the rods of the Egyptian priests that turned into serpents,
and yet as young as those early 90's, when tables tipped and tam-
bourines floated. To connect such things with the sacred but help-
less Dead, seemed to me an insult, not only to grief, but to intel-
ligence.

All that was my answer to the question, "Is there any evidence
that when a man dies he shall live again?" There is, of course,
another reply, but it isn't often heard. It is, "I don't know whether
there is evidence for survival, but I wish I did." This is the answer
of the Mind of Curiosity without which confessedly ignorant, but
always wondering and searching mind, there never would have been
any science in the world. This mind doesn't say "bosh" before
examining evidence. It couldn't live in the strait-jacket of a creed.
It hasn't much patience with George's mother (who was, plainly, a
Pragmatist!) or, for that matter, with Solomon's materialist, who
is sure that hereafter we shall be as though we never had been. This
Mind of Curiosity says you can't be "sure" of anything, without in-
vestigation. It is even willing to investigate that despised thing,
spiritualism, with, as someone once said, "its twaddle about 'planes
and spheres'
"
which implies that if the soul survives, it becomes im-
becile! I remember Professor Sidgwick's "curiosity" about such
things. He admitted to Frederick Myers that he thought that "when
Tradition, Intuition, Metaphysic, had failed to solve the riddle of the
universe, there was still a chance that from actual observable phe-
nomena ghosts, spirits some valid knowledge might be drawn as to
a World Unseen". "From that night onward," Myers says, calmly,
"I resolved to pursue this quest. . ."
One must read his book, "Human Personality And Its Survival
of Bodily Death" which is a sort of corner stone of psychical re-
search to know the significance of that quest; the ruthless reason-
ing, which might destroy his own hope, the sacrifice, the shrinking
from things as distressing to the taste of a poet, a scholar and a
gentleman, as a hair shirt would be to the flesh! For myself, when
I read that book, I was filled with admiration for Professor Myers

courage in facing all the "bosh" people, and religious people, and in-
tellectual people, and diving into what seemed to them a mud puddle
of illogical emotion. Also, I was myself a little less cock-sure that
no man was ever known to return from the grave. But I hadn't much
hope that psychical research would prove anything, one way or the
other. And as for spiritualism, I realized scientifically and philo-
sophically uneducated though I was that it was illogical to deduce
survival from happenings which might be hallucinations (when not
humbuggery), or, in objective phenomena, merely some unknown
force, operating upon an entirely hypothetical form of matter, of late
named teleplasm or ectoplasm. So I said to myself that, as spiritual-

istic phenomena must be fraud because they were "impossible," then
they had better be investigated by these psychical research people, and
shown up! The psychical research people have done the investiga-
ting but some of the things "shown up" have been fact, not fraud.*
As a result, we are not so certain, now-a-days, as to 'impossibilities.'
We are less ready to use the word about anything except math-
ematics.
Professor Richet snubbed the type of mind which says "impossible,"
by his statement: "To deny certain (psychic) phenomena, does not
display knowledge; it displays ignorance." Which reminds us that
sparks rubbed from a cat's fur indicated, from the beginning of time,
a Force; but only yesterday was that force curbed and bitted, and
named Electricity! So, Richet says, do spiritualistic phenomena in-
dicate a Force. He adds, carefully, that "its manifestation does not,
probably, indicate survival". He does not believe in survival.
But anyhow, the phenomena, subjective in various forms of auto-
matism, ouija spellings, scrawled reams of automatic script, gutteral
mutterings of entranced mediums; or objective tipping tables and
materializing forms, began, in the 80's, to give a few intelligent
persons pause. After all, they said, perhaps these things mean some-
thing? This appears to be a universe of cause and effect; Nature
may be brutal, but she is sincere. Mathematics are unshakable. The
attraction of gravitation knows no vagaries. (This was before Ein-
stein!) Even sparks from a cat's fur prophesied the telephone, and
the jumping lid of a tea-kettle changed civilization! So they set out
to look for the facts. Apart from any question of survival, apart
from the frantic credulousness of Grief, from the tender and lovely
irrationalities of George's mother, such people said that it was
childish to ignore what might be facts, in these queer happenings.
Happenings which take place generally in the presence of mediums
persons of a peculiar physical or mental make-up; abnormal per-
sons, probably; certainly some of them display very distinct disas-
sociation of personality. Well! They found many facts these
'intelligent' people !
Starting with Saul, who saw very 'queer' things
in the presence of the Witch of Endor, the phenomena have been re-
peated and repeated. The entirely skeptical Sir William Crookes

a result, the existence of an unclassified Force (now called psychic)
is, here and there, admitted. It differs markedly from any known
physical force. Physical forces are reliable, unselfconscious, without
intellectual appropriateness, and without recognizable will. But this
psychic force is vagrant, unreliable, and occasionally it displays not
only self-consciousness and will, but an appropriateness to occasion
which looks like choice. Yet if men who have investigated the phe-
nomena are asked if they signify anything superhuman, they reply
that nothing can be called superhuman if by any stretching of pos-
sibility it can be called human.
Such men William James was one of them prefer, before com-
mitting themselves to any hypothesis as to survival, to put phenomena
generally called psychic, through the sieve not of taste or morals
or faith, but of physics and psychology. When such testing is done,
what Saul would have taken to be the ghost of Samuel, is occasion-
ally found to be hallucination or else gauze and pulleys and ama-
zingly clever sleight of hand. And most of the automatic messages
can be traced to the subconscious mind of the writer. And George's
mother's faith is only her own desire. In other words, happenings,
accepted by credulity or sorrow as "superhuman," are shown to be
entirely (and, when fraudulent, most regrettably!) human. But is
there, ever, anything that can't be labeled human and normal ; any-
thing that won't go through the scientific sieve? Anything indicating
that when a man dies, he shall live again?
William James said to me once of the notorious Eusapia's phe-
nomena, "Her materializations and general monkey shines are most-
ly humbug. But allowing for all the cheating, and all the hideous
vulgarity, there remains a residuum which we can't explain." This
unexplained residuum, which apparently James had detected, was
an indication of Mind, acting independently of Matter; in other
words, an indication of the continuance of identity after death.
"But," comes the protest, "psychic phenomena which suggest such
a thing are (when not humbug) just chance. So why consider
them?" It is the haunting and melancholy voice of Solomon's
materialistic which asks this question:

And hereafter we shall be as though we had never been."

Chancel Well, for myself, I see the orderliness of the stars, the
perfection of a flea's leg, the reliability of physical laws in cause and
effect and I don't see how the Universe can be run by chance; if
it were, it would be a Chaos, not a Cosmos. Yet far be it from me
to discuss chance ! To speak of chance, is to touch the fringe of that
Garment of God, Free Will, which is caught about the universe by
the girdle of determinism, with its clasp of the star swarms of space !
This is only the story of the elementary processes of an escape from
materialism, so you will not expect me to bring determinism into the
question; nor will I dare, in my ignorance, to struggle with certain
other lions in the way Time and Space, Matter and Energy, and
the Fourth Dimension though indeed they all belong in any tho-
rough consideration of psychic phenomena. Instead, I will just say
that, to me, an orderly universe suggests design; and design implies
intelligence. It has many names, this Intelligence: the Absolute, the
First Cause, the Cosmic Consciousness (which last means, I suppose,
an eternal awareness of everything, past, present and to come).
There is another name for it, an august name, belittled by theo-
logical man-handling: the name God. (I don't suppose it really
matters much to God, what we call Him!) Anyhow, all the names
mean, to me, a Conscious Universe, which, because it shows purpose,
implies intelligence.
But such definitions are beyond the question whether human in-
telligence can survive bodily death. What we want to know, is
whether there is, in psychic phenomena, any indication that it does.
Any evidence that the individual human mind can exist without
a body? Certainly, intelligence is occasionally discernible in psychic
phenomena. But whose intelligence? Is it that of the medium in
whose presence things happen? Is it a secondary personality of
hers? Or is it the intelligence of John Smith, who is sitting with
her, and does she, somehow, read in his unconscious mind things
his conscious mind has forgotten? Or, is it the intelligence of some
other living, perhaps distant, person, which, without anybody's voli-
tion, reaches the medium, and is recorded by her? Or is it that
Universal Intelligence, called the Cosmic Consciousness, to which the
medium has (again, somehow!) access? Or this is the last thing
we ought to consider is it the intelligence of some person who has
died, which (somehow) stimulates the brain of the medium, and
makes her speak or write what it wishes to express?

a little kiosk near the Madeleine to buy a newspaper, read, with a

Daily Mail, these words: "On the night of February 5th, at 9:30,
the United States transport Tuscania, loaded with American soldiers,
was sunk. S. O. S. messages were sent out in all directions." Of

the war with intense anxiety, was still watching it, and, aware of this
terrible catastrophe, communicated it, twenty minutes after it hap-
pened, to two other anxious Americans in Paris. "Coincidence" is
easier to accept than the idea that a mind cognizant of what had
happened, reached, without aid of a physical organism, the mind of
one of the persons at the board, and caused her own hand to move
the pointer and spell out what he wanted said, words, you observe,
coincidental with a fact. (Of course, it is always the hand of the
operator which moves the pointer. But if there was proof that an
external mind, unassisted by any bodily senses, used the operator's
brain to produce those motor effects, we would have the "residuum.")
Here is another "coincidence" story. A lady, a widow of many
years, whom we will call "Gertrude", goes to visit some friends in
Bar Harbor. In her absence two of her friends in her own town
receive a spelling on a ouija board, which purports to be a message
from her long deceased husband. In it he says that he can't follow
Gertrude very well, because she is in "new surroundings" (he had
never been in that part of Mount Desert) ;
"but she is having," he
adds, "new experiences". As soon as Gertrude returned, her friends
asked her if she had had any new psychical experiences. "None
whatever!" she said, laughing. Later, however, she herself asked a
question: "Do you suppose that spelling could have meant that I
was doing something unusual? For I certainly was! The very

If we can make this story fit into the word "coincidence", we
have no residuum. We needn't even consider the possibility that an
amused husband, using somebody else's brain as if it were a type-
writer, tried to let his wife know, by spelling out her own words
about deep sea fishing, that, although it was difficult to follow her in
"new surroundings", he was aware of what was going on in her
life. Some of us might think this, but psychologists who would
think so are as scarce as hens' teeth !
These two trivial stories belong in the class with the letter which
arrives on the morning mail, from a friend of whom one happened
to think last night, though one hasn't heard or thought of him for
years. The arrival of such a letter is a commonplace to us all,
and, as no law governs it, we squeeze it, and the S. O. S. message,
and the "new experience" of catching a cod off Bar Harbor, into
tfye label "Coincidence"; and they all run through the sieve, and
land in the entirely normal. There are innumerable happenings of
this kind, all apparently lawless, which we can, rationally, call "coin-
cidence". Certainly we can't prove that they are not coincidence.
Neither can we prove they are "lawless." So we may, if we are so
inclined, call them, mystically, "straws", which show that the wind
of Consciousness bloweth where it listeth, and we only hear the
sound thereof, and dare not say whence it cometh or whither it
goeth. Yet how trifling the "straws" are! To some people, their
triviality is, in itself, a denial of survival, for, if identity persists after
death, would our dead come back only to talk to us of deep sea
fishing or even the terrible, but quite impersonal, affair of a sinking
ship? Would they not, rather, tell us of their lives now, and of
Him who inhabiteth Eternity? Personally, I think that if their
speech was to prove their own survival of bodily death, they would
not do either of these things. Mere descriptions of God, which, in
the nature of things, can't be verified, cannot be proof ; nor could we
verify, or even understand, descriptions of how they live now. Could
dragon-flies, zigzagging through September skies, make caddis worms
understand how they live?
Triviality even jokes in so-called communications from the
dead, cannot be denied ; indeed, the occasional indication of a continu-

tioning without an organism. In other words, indications of a dis-
carnate personality.
The next story to be tested for this indication, shows an "intelli-
gence", apparently trying to prove personality. I won't split hairs
as to the difference between individuality and personality. Philoso-
phers must do that, but common folks like the rest of us ordinarily
use the word "personality" as meaning identity, character, or, more
explicitly, Consciousness, expressing memory and will. Grant as
a working hypothesis that a person who has died, wished to make
his surviving personality known. How could he do it? If, through
a medium, he says, "I am alive! I am still myself;" we retort,
"No, you are not. You are the medium's secondary personality."
If, to show his intelligence, he tells us something we don't know
say that his wife is having a "new experience" in catching codfish
we promptly say, "Coincidence!" If, undiscouraged, he describes
Heaven in very earthly phraseology we say "Imagination I"
No; such things don't prove surviving personality, because they're
not identifying. What would be identifying? Well, memory
would help. But if the alleged communicator offered, as proof,
some "remembered" event in his life, wouldn't we instantly object:
"The medium has heard of it"? Obviously, then, to establish
identity, the "memory" must be something known only to the com-

Mrs. M. tried, confusedly, to space the letters into words, but as

tioning without an organism. In other words, indications of a dis-
carnate personality.
The next story to be tested for this indication, shows an "intelli-
gence", apparently trying to prove personality. I won't split hairs
as to the difference between individuality and personality. Philoso-
phers must do that, but common folks like the rest of us ordinarily
use the word "personality" as meaning identity, character, or, more
explicitly, Consciousness, expressing memory and will. Grant-as
a working hypothesis-that a person who has died, wished to make
his surviving personality known. How could he do it? If, through
a medium, he says, "I am alive I I am still myself ;"-we retort,
"No, you are not. You are the medium's secondary personality."
If, to show his intelligence, he tells us something we don't know-
say that his wife is having a "new experience" in catching codfish-
we promptly say, "Coincidence I" If, undiscouraged, he describes
Heaven-in very earthly phraseology-we say "Imagination I"
No; such things don't prove surviving personality, because they're
not identifying. What would be identifying? Well, memory
would help. But if the alleged communicator offered, as proof,
some "remembered" event in his life, wouldn't we instantly object:
"The medium has heard of it"? Obviously, then, to establish
identity, the "memory" must be something known only to the com-
municator and the sitter.

Mrs. M. then read the whole message to her: "Tell S. her
father has told me about that lawsuit Stewartstown. Prove it and
let me know." "Did your father have any lawsuit in Stewarts-
town ?" Mrs. M. asked
"I'm sure I don't know," Miss S. N. said; "he began to practice
there before I was born, so naturally I don't remember much about
it!"
"Did you ever hear of any lawsuit in which your father was in-
terested?"
"Never !" said S. However, to settle it, she wrote to her mother,
asking whether Doctor N. had ever been sued in Stewartstown.
Mrs. N. replied that some forty-two years ago, before she and the
doctor were married, there had been a lawsuit; a crazy boy, in
the clutches of a shyster lawyer, had sued the young physician; the
case came to trial after her marriage to the doctor, and was decided
in his favor. Here, at first glance, is an effort on the part of the
deceased Dr. N. to prove his continued existence and personality,
by telling his daughter S. that he remembered something that
she didn't know (and Mrs. M. didn't know, either) ; something
which could be verified later by persons not present at the time the
effort was made. The "memory" of a law suit, entirely unknown to
S. N., was, when corroborated later by her mother, highly identify-
ing. But we must immediately ask, whose memory was identified?
The reply is prompt! Miss S. N.'s. For, though she was positive
that she knew nothing about it, it is hardly conceivable that the doc-
tor had never, in S. N.'s hearing, when she was a child, referred
to this important event of his own youth. But if so, the reference
had been forgotten in the crowding experiences of her forty-odd
years, and now it was hidden among a million other memories!
Yet it was there, and it sprang up no one knows under what
cerebral stimulation to "identify" her father. Why did it emerge
at this particular moment? What pushed a memory so appropriate
to the purpose of identification, from her unconscious into her
conscious mind? The story itself can be called a "buried memory";
but the apparent purpose in its resurrection suggests deliberate selec-
tion, and holds it, for me, in the meshes of the sieve, because appro-
priateness to a particular purpose indicates will, as well as memory.
And will and memory, together, constitute Personality. However,
packing it into the dimensions of the label "Subliminal Mind", it
goes through the sieve and leaves no residuum.

consciousness with no body (of its own) "It thinks; therefore it is!"
But people who know far more than I do, don't say anything of the
kind. They say that two years before this automatic writing, Miss
A. may have read some newspaper account of Jack's death. She has
not the slightest recollection of having done so, but that doesn't
prove she didn't. It is improbable, but it is not impossible. If she
did read about it, and forgot it, it might now, suddenly, emerge from
her subliminal, and she herself, (like Miss S. N. with her father's
lawsuit), supply the personifying, and in Jack's case dramatic de-
tails, of anxiety about Mary. With this explanation the thing turns
normal, even while it is running through the sieve! In other words,
Jack and Mary are Miss A. It is trivial, this story of poor, il-
literate Jack unethical Jack, perhaps, because his concern was not
for his lawful wedded wife (unless he got names mixed up!) and
it is full of bad spelling, and "pitch kitPs". Yet, if the whole thing
isn't one of Miss A.'s buried memories, then Jack and his anxiety
about Mary, trivial though they are, may be the floating weed, the
spicy fragrance, the wind-blown birds of gorgeous plumage, that met
the Spanish galleons. "Jack" may herald a discovery, beside which
Columbus' sinks into unimportance!
Another label for a metaphysical fact, Telepathy, indicates that
several stories, which, at first sight seem supernormal, are only
superusual. Telepathy has been defined as an impression of any
kind from one mind to another, independently of recognized chan-
nels of sense. "Mind, acting without any known assistance of
flesh." It has not been accepted by all psychologists but the recent
experiments in England, undertaken by Professor Gilbert Murray

wasn't given to writing letters. But on March 6th, five weeks later,
a letter did come ; it had been dodging submarines, I suppose. It had
been written on the 29th of January, twenty-four hours after that
spelling promising that "Gus" would let them know. Well, he did
let them know! for he sent in this letter "certain words", jotted
down on the back of an old envelope, just as they had been
given to him on January 15th on a ouija board in America. They
were from the communicator who had promised that "words would
come". The words were, in themselves, intelligible, but evidentially
unimportant unless they indicated that a mind had functioned with-
out a body? And they do indicate that, for there was mentality in
both the spellings, one on one side of the Atlantic, and one on the
other. There was memory of "Gus" ; and there was will to prove
personality: "On Gus soon do prove." But if we are going to be
thorough about this sieve business, we must immediately ask, "Whose

The mechanism of telepathy (granting its actuality) is an open
question. Nobody knows not even the few psychologists who be-
lieve in it, let alone a layman! whether it has a physical basis, and
can be thought of in terms of matter; or whether it is a faculty of
the mind, independent of matter. But as a means of squeezing emo-
tion out of an experience so that it may go through the sieve, telepa-
thy works admirably. It doesn't, of course, explain how the think-
ing, willing consciousness of a brain in America, could use another
brain in Europe to produce motor effects, and make a veridical
statement. But the "how" is less important to me than the fact;
because if "Gus's" mind produced those effects, without the as-
sistance of his body, it would seem that a body is not essential to the
operation of a mind. Or put it this way: the intelligent movement of
that ouija board in Paris, being due to the mind of a man in Boston,
suggests that as telepathy before death is possible between living per-
sons, telepathy after death, between living and dead persons is at
least thinkable, because in either case, mind would have to op-
erate without bodily senses. But in testing the story of "Gus" for
a residuum, most of us just say, "Telepathy from 'Gus'," and leave
it at that. That the will displayed in these two ouija messages was
that of a discarnate mind a mind on the other side of the grave,

myself and a friend using a ouija board. It was arranged (by mail)
that my friend and I would use our board on a day when Mrs.
Piper was to produce automatic script for Mrs. H., and that I
should ask the "intelligence" who might communicate with us, to
give us some word or idea; then, through Mrs. Piper's control (or,
if you prefer, call it her secondary personality which names itself
"Rector") through "Rector", write, by Mrs. Piper's hand, the same
word or idea. On the day arranged, after the communicator had
agreed to make this experiment, the piece of wood on three legs up
in Maine, laboriously spelled out the following:
I will try to get the word Washington through rector but rector
says he never heard the word hard on old George
In spite of the snub to the father of our country, we wrote to Mrs.
H. in Boston, asking her if the word "Washington" had appeared
in tjie Piper script. She replied that it had not. But some weeks
afterwards Mrs. H. and I, looking over the script, came upon four
words, in an abruptly different hand a big, black, violent scrawl.
These four words had no apparent relation to the rest of the mes-
sage, nor had they the slightest meaning to Mrs. H. They were:
Somebody here called George
That was all. It is not much of a cross correspondence, I admit. In
fact, some people might turn it down as nothing but coincidence,
and not very striking at that! Telepathy, however, claims it for its
own, by saying that my concentration upon the word "Washington",
impressed the entranced Mrs. Piper, a hundred miles away, to write
it. But no; the telepathic theory breaks down here, because Mrs.
Piper didn't write it! She wrote the word which so often precedes
Washington; she wrote "George". The communicator had said, in
Maine, that Mrs. Piper's control, "Rector", had never heard the
word "Washington", and implied with his impertinent (and high-
ly characteristic!) "hard on old George!", that this might be wound-
ing to the vanity of the first President. But perhaps "Rector" had
heard the very ordinary name, "George"? However, that is a spec-
ulation. There is a good deal of "speculation", on both sides of this
question of survival ! All we can say is that this cross correspondence
indicates a personality, because will and, perhaps, memory are dis-
played; Will which ingeniously circumvented "Rector's" sad his-

should ask the "intelligence" who might communicate with us, to
give us some word or idea; then, through Mrs. Piper's control (or,
if you prefer, call it her secondary personality which names itself
"Rector")-through "Rector", write, by Mrs. Piper's hand, the same
word or idea. On the day arranged, after the communicator had
agreed to make this experiment, the piece of wood on three legs up
in Maine, laboriously spelled out the following:
I will try to get the word Washington through rector but rector
says he never heard the word hard on old George
In spite of the snub to the father of our country, we wrote to Mrs.
H. in Boston, asking her if the word "Washington" had appeared
in t)le Piper script. She replied that it had not. But some weeks
afterwards Mrs. H. and I, looking over the script, came upon four
words, in an abruptly different hand-a big, black, violent scrawl.
These four words had no apparent relation to the rest of the mes-
sage, nor had they the slightest meaning to Mrs. H. They were:
Somebody here called George
That was all. It is not much of a cross correspondence, I admit. In
fact, some people might turn it down as nothing but coincidence,-
and not very striking at that I Telepathy, however, claims it for its
own, by saying that my concentration upon the word "Washington",
impressed the entranced Mrs. Piper, a hundred miles away, to write
it. But no; the telepathic theory breaks down here, because Mrs.
Piper didn't write it I She wrote the word which so often precedes
Washington; she wrote "George". The communicator had said, in
l\!Iaine, that Mrs. Piper's control, "Rector", had never heard the
word "Washington", and implied-with his impertinent (and high-
ly characteristic!) "hard on old George!", that this might be wound-
ing to the vanity of the first President. But perhaps "Rector" had
heard the very ordinary name, "George"? However, that is a spec-
ulation. There is a good deal of "speculation", on both sides of this
question of survival! All we can say is that this cross correspondence
indicates a personality, because will and, perhaps, memory are dis-
played; Will-which ingeniously circumvented "Rector's" sad his-

torical ignorance by the use of the word "George"; and memory,
which indicated the historical if elementary! knowledge of the
communicator. Telepathy says, however, that that will and mem-
ory, and the circumvention of "George", though they do indicate
personality, are not the residuum, because the personality indicated
was embodied !
Was, in fact, my own. It was my mind that, some-
how, across Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, impressed
that part of Mrs. Piper's mind which she names Rector, and made
her hand write "George". As in the case of "Gus", an incarnate
mind (mine) did, without any detectible assistance of the physical
senses, cause another incarnate mind to produce physical effects. So
this story does not prove that, after death, the spirit is not "dis-
persed into thin air". Call it telepathy, and Washington's first name,
George, appearing (with appropriateness to the occasion) in two
widely separate places on the same day, goes through the sieve, and
falls on the growing heap of the entirely normal, and Solomon's
materialist may exult in the melancholy triumph of being able to
say, "I told you so".
But there are psychic phenomena which can't be called telepathic;
for instance, the story of Mrs. Agnes Pacquet's brother, Ed Dunn.
Now Ed was a fireman on a tugboat in Chicago Harbor, and he
was drowned one October night, towards dawn. Mrs. Pacquet's
story, (somewhat condensed) follows:
"On the morning of the accident ... I awoke feeling gloomy
and depressed. ... I went into the pantry, took down the tea canis-
ter, and as I turned around my brother Edmund or his exact
image stood before me .... only a few feet away. The appari-
tion stood with back toward me, and was in the act of falling for-
ward .... seemingly impelled by a loop of rope drawing against
his legs. The vision lasted but a moment, disappearing over a rail-
ing or bulwark. I dropped the tea, and exclaimed, 'My God! Ed
is drowned.' At about half past ten a. m. my husband received a
telegram from Chicago announcing the drowning of my brother. . . .
He said to me, 'Ed is sick in the hospital in Chicago ; I have just re-
ceived a telegram.' To which I replied, 'Ed is drowned ! I saw him
go overboard'. I then gave him a description of what I had seen;
that my brother had on a heavy blue sailor's shirt ; that he went over
the rail. I noticed that his pants legs were rolled up enough to see
the white lining inside."

A PEAK IN DARIEN 139
The actual facts were that on that night Edmund Dunn, while
adjusting a tow line, on the tug "Wolf", was thrown overboard by
the line and drowned. The crew testified that Ed had lately pur-
chased a pair of new trousers, and as they were a trifle long he had
rolled them up, "showing the white lining".
It is difficult to find a normal label for this story. "Coincidence" is
too far fetched ; the "Subliminal Mind" can't resurrect what it hasn't
buried! "Telepathy" would have to be stretched to the breaking
point before we could believe that Ed, in that swift moment of dying,
thought of his sister, and of the white lining of his new "pants'.
Such self-consciousness, under such circumstances, is a too incredible
suggestion ! We can only label the story telepathic, by accepting the
theory that the crew of the "Wolf", who saw the accident and the
details, thought the white lining of the trousers to Ed, who, dying,
thought the crew's thought to Mrs. Pacquet. This may be normal,
but it is also swallowing a camel after having strained out a gnat.
"Hallucination" is another label meaning that Mrs. Pacquet, stand-
ing in her pantry, suffered for a moment some bodily change or
lesion, which made her think she saw Ed's ghost. But though an
hallucination may be normal, in the sense of being pathological, (with
the accompanying implication that the brain is the self) the word
doesn't account for the appropriateness of the apparition to the oc-
casion. Appropriateness! I am impressed by the way in which,
in all these stories, that word lingers in the sieve; because appropri-
ateness may mean selection and, who selects? However, appro-
priateness may, also, be mere coincidence, so let it go. We won't
assume an unknown cause if we can find a known one; and the
known one may be clairvoyance. Certainly, clairvoyance on the
part of Mrs. Pacquet is nearer the normal than the striking time-
liness of that hallucination. To define it, "Clairvoyance is the
faculty of perceiving, as though visually with coincidental truth
some distant scene or event". As Ed's sister stood with the tea can-
ister in her hand, she saw ((if you can say "saw" when the eyes of
the flesh had nothing to do with it and when the seeing took place
some three hours after the event) she saw the twisted tow rope, the
blue shirt, the backward stumble. This so comppletely rules out
"spirits", that Solomon's materialist may easily say, "Ed Dunn is as
though he had never been" ! For whatever clairvoyance may be, it is
not, necessarily, related to the theory of survival. (And Time

of lightning, a midnight landscape. Such a glimpse is generally
meaningless; it may be of a sailor falling overboard; or, what is just

I know another story which if one uses sufficient circumlocution,
may also be labeled "Clairvoyance". It is concerned with a baby's
rompers. About a year and a half ago a friend, whom I will call
Molly, and I, were sitting with Mrs. Piper, in Boston, and Molly's
sister Lucy, who had died, "purported" (as the saying is) to write
with the entranced Mrs. Piper's hand. She said that the day before
she had seen her mother, in another town, doing so and so. The
statement was correct ;
but as Molly happened to know exactly what
her mother had been doing at the time, she, of course, credited the
information to mind reading on the part of Mrs. Piper. Then an-
other personality begin to write, but paused to say:
Lucy has gone again to find mother and see what she is doing.
I, rather surprised, said, "What! Now?" There was no reply; the
other communicator just went on writing about his own affairs,
then some 20 minutes later, paused, to say, abruptly:
Here's Lucy!
I said, as nearly as I can remember, "Well, Lucy, did you see your
mother? What was she doing?" Mrs. Piper's hand wrote:
Mother just looked at morning news (here followed a drawing
of newspaper) and laid it on a little table. Picked up what
looked like a box of buttons (Here the hand drew seven little
circles o o o o o o o suggesting buttons) and shook them.

Yes, the wings of wondering carry us
as high as that! But we must come down again to precise terminol-
ogy, and say that neither the buttons, nor Ed Dunn, constitute a
residuum which proves survival, because that word "clairvoyance"
takes them both through the sieve and names them normal. Yet it
leaves something glimmering on the meshes, it leaves the implication
that, though Ed is not the residuum, perhaps his sister is? The im-

door happens to be ajar, it steps out and sees that which it hath
not entered the heart of man to conceive !

Robin's mother. She said that about three weeks after the boy's
death ·(his ship had been torpedoed and he was drowned), she went
to the house of her brother in London :-but I'll give you (slightly
abbreviated) her report to Sir William.
"I went," she wrote, "to my brother's house. His cook asked me
if I was interested in spiritualism. I asked her why; she replied
that her sister Mary, who had previously lived with my brother as
parlor maid, had received a message from my boy, whom she knew
as a youngster. This message was that my boy wished me to know
A PEAK IN DARIEN 143
that he had not suffered at all, but had died from shock. I had not
seen this girl for two and a half years. The message was not
evidential, for she may have heard of my son's death. So I requested
that if my boy appeared again to her, he would send me something
to prove his identity." Later Robin's mother saw Mary . . . "and she
told me she had again seen my son, and he had given her a message
which she could make nothing of. He said, 'Tell mother I hope
Stella (his sister) has been able to get the gray suede shoes. Tell
mother I hope she will keep the pen in a sheath always by her'." The
mother adds: "The day before my son left home, his sister was
hunting round different shops for gray suede shoes, and my son and I
spent the morning going from shop to shop seeking for a chatelaine
case for my fountain pen, which he gave me as a parting present.
Now Mary had not seen either me or my son, or any member of my
family, since she married, and there was no possible means of her
knowing or finding out anything whatever about the pen or the
shoes/'
None of the normal labels we have used fit this story; even the
hard-worked theory of telepathy from the living, which explained
"Gus" and "George" Washington, won't dispose of Robin, unless we
say that his mother transferred her memory of Stella's slippers to the
cook's mind who transferred the transferred memory to the parlor
maid's mind. To believe that, we would have to swallow two
camels! But will Robin be considered the evidential "residuum" by
anyone except his mother, and Stella, and the parlor maid? Prob-
ably not. On this subject, other people's convictions do not convince.
Do you remember what was said to Dives when he wanted to go
back and warn his brothers? "Neither will they be persuaded, though
one rose from the dead." Most of us dodge in any direction to es-
cape from being "persuaded" that, for instance, Jack Creasy rose
from the dead to ask help for his poor Mary; or that Robin was so
anxious to comfort his mother, that he came back to tell the parlor
maid to tell her (as a proof that he was still living) that he remem-
bered Stella's shoes! In this instance we dodge by saying, "Why
didn't Robin speak to his mother, direct, instead of the parlor maid ?"
Well, why don't we use a piece of string for telephoning? Because
we have to use a wire! Mary was a wire; Robin's mother (like
most of us) was just string. However, the story of Robin is not the
residuum in the sieve, because we have still one label left to attach
to it the Cosmic Mind. Like the other labels, it is only a name;

Now Mary had not seen either me or my son, or any member of my
family, since she married, and there was no possible means of her
knowing or finding out anything whatever about the pen or the
shoe!!."
None of the normal labels we have used fit this story; even the
hard-worked theory of telepathy from the living, which explained
"Gus" and "George" Washington, won't dispose of Robin, unless we
say that his mother transferred her memory of Stella's slippers to the
cook's mind-who transferred the transferred memory to the parlor
maid's mind. To believe that, we would have to swallow two
camels I But will Robin be considered the evidential "residuum" by
anyone--except his mother, and Stella, and the parlor maid? Prob-
ably not. On this subject, other people's convictions do not convince.
Do you remember what was said to Dives when he wanted to go
back and warn his brothers? "Neither will they be persuaded, though
one rose from the dead." Most of us dodge in any direction to es-
cape from being "persuaded" that, for instance, Jack Creasy rose
from the dead to ask help for his poor Mary; or that Robin was so
anxious to comfort his mother, that he came back to tell the parlor
maid to tell her (as a proof that he was still living) that he remem-
bered Stella's shoes I In this instance we dodge by saying, "Why
didn't Robin speak to his mother, direct, instead of the parlor maid?"
Well, why don't we use a piece of string for telephoning? Because
we have to use a wire! Mary was a wire;-Robin's mother (like
most of us) was just string. However, the story of Robin is not the
residuum in the sieve, because we have still one label left to attach
to it-the Cosmic Mind. Like the other labels, it is only a name;

thesis of a continuing awareness a sort of Reservoir of all the
thoughts that have ever been thought by all the human beings who
have ever lived since the beginning of time. An unthinkably vast

can number, of all peoples and kindreds and tongues, Mary, it is
alleged, drew a single memory, appropriate -not to herself, or the
cook, or one of the millions of remembering and grieving mothers
in the world but to Robin, and his mother.
Another story labeled Cosmic Mind, is the famous experiment of
Sir William Crookes. He was alone with his medium testing for
that eluding residuum, and finding it constantly slip through the sieve
on the words "unconscious cerebration/' To eliminate that, he said
to the communicating intelligence (I quote from his report) he said
to this Intelligence which was, it alleged, using the hand of the
medium to operate a planchette: "Can you see the contents of this
room?" The planchette wrote "Yes." "Can you see to read this
newspaper?" (A copy of the London Times was on a table behind
him). The planchette wrote "Yes." Sir William was standing
between the table and the medium, with his back to the table ; neither
he nor she could, by any normal possibility, read that paper. He put
his hand behind him, put one finger down somewhere! anywhere!
on the paper. "Well," he said, "if you can see that, write the
word that is now covered by my finger, and I will believe you." The
planchette hesitated, then slowly wrote one word: "however". The
scientist turned, lifted his finger, and read "however". Unless we
say about Crookes, "the boy lied" which, of course, would be silly
we find nothing but a willed clairvoyance, which would be per-
sonality in Omniscience, to account for that "however". The
medium "saw", without physical eyes, through the body of Sir Wil-
liam; "saw", under his pressing finger, the coincidental fact the
hidden word. That indication of knowledge and will, is one step
ahead of Mrs. Pacquet and Mary, for their experiences had a rela-
tion to human minds, and the word "however" had no human con-
nection. Hence it does not go through the sieve on any of the nor-
mal labels. It is, to me, the residuum, which reveals a mind function-
ing without an organism . . . Does it reveal more than that ? Does
it suggest that the One Mind (whose awareness is Eternity) is made

about Ed; knew about the buttons for the baby's rompers; knew
about Stella's slippers ;

minds of the swarm Agnes Pacquet's mind, say swirl for a second
close enough to catch that glimpse of what the Whole knew namely,
that Ed was drowned? If so, she remained herself, for the glimpse
was appropriate to her; she felt grief! And grief like love, like
memory, like will is an attribute of personality. So, though part
of infinity, she remained finite! Did some other consciousness in the
swarm Robin's consciousness have a flash of contact with the
parlor maid's consciousness, and so get his message through to his
mother? Did Lucy tell Molly something about their mother, which
Mrs. Piper caught, and wrote down? Did Sir William Crookes'
medium, push the blindness of her physical eyes aside, and read, with
the eyes of the spirit, that word "however"?
We can speculate thus about each of the trivial stories I have told
you,^ because in all of them is this "residuum" ;
this intelligence,
displaying memory, will, appropriateness, selection which together
equal what we call ourselves. But this residuum does not mean that
the human self is lost, swallowed up by the Cosmic Mind, as the rain
drop is swallowed by the sea! On the contrary, it makes our per-
sonality fit into the scheme of Universal Consciousness, like a speck in
a stupendous picture puzzle; a necessary speck, perfect in its place
in the Whole, yet perfect in itself as a speck; as enduring in its per-
sonality as the whole Picture the whole Plan the whole Universe.
As immortal as God. As normal as God!
Perhaps this is all the wild surmise that we make, staring at each
other, silent upon the peak in Darien; but it is thinkable. To me,
it is more than thinkable, it is an unavoidable deduction. Call it
intuition, in George's mother it was plainly intuition. To me, it
it is intuition, pillared and buttressed by Reason! George's mother
called it Faith (oh, beautiful word so maltreated, like the word
"God," by theology!), and she never needed, as I did, to add to her
faith, knowledge. But Intuition, Faith, and, perhaps last of all
Reason, plodding with heavy, steady feet behind those other two
winged words even Reason may say, "Yes, it is thinkable that
the Universe, whose thought is the Pleiades, and New England
hills in October, and the laughter of little children, and the gal-
lantry of old age, and the faithful love of a dog; it is think-
able, that the Conscious Whole is made up of our consciousnesses."

too, know Beauty, Order, Love, Genius, Calvary. Is it too much,

PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY
BY WILLIAM MCDOUGALL
This course of lectures on Psychical Research is, I believe, the
first of its kind to be given in any university, whether of this or of any
other country; and I venture to think that this innovation will prove
to be yet another leaf added to the laurels of Clark University, al-
ready so distinguished by its impartial and courageous spirit of re-
search.
Other lecturers, persons distinguished in the most various lines of
activity, but all of them qualified by special study of the field of
Psychical Research, will deal with special parts of aspects of the field
and from the most diverse points of view. For it is the intention
of those who have designed the course that it should represent with
perfect impartiality every point of view from which this most difficult
and controversial field may be approached; the only stipulation be-
ing that each lecturer shall present his facts, his evidences, and his
reasoning upon them in a truly critical spirit and with all the im-
partiality and openness of mind attainable by him.
This course being so great an innovation, it is fitting that this
lecture should be devoted to the justification of the inclusion of
Psychical Research among University Studies; for there can be
no doubt that Clark University, while it will be praised by many
for its courage and its pioneer spirit in thus opening its doors to
a study hitherto denied University recognition, will also be severely
criticized by others. It v/ill be said by those adverse critics that the
University is encouraging superstition and countenancing charlatanry;
that it runs the risk of leading its students into a slough of despair, of
entangling them in a quagmire where no sure footing is to be found,
where will-o'-the-wisps gleam fitfully on every hand, provoking hopes
that are destined to disappointment and emotions that blind us to the
dangers of this obscure region; dangers ranging from mere waste of
time to disturbance of intellectual balance and loss of critical judg-
ment ; dangers which he who enters by the gate we seek to open must
inevitably encounter.

This course of lectures on Psychical Research is, I believe, the

to be yet another leaf added to the laurels of Clark University, al-

that it runs the risk of leading its students into a slough of despair, of

that are destined to disappointment and emotions that blind us to the

ISO WILLIAM MCDOUGALL
Let me begin, then, by frankly admitting that such criticism is not
wholly without substance and foundation. The field of Psychical
Research has pitfalls and morasses unknown in other fields of
science. The student entering this field cannot avoid contact with
vast currents of traditional sentiment, which sentiments, in nearly all
cases, he either shares or repudiates with an intensity of feeling that
renders calm and critical judgment well nigh impossible. It is as
though the student were invited to embark with Coleridge's Ancient
Mariner ;
to exclaim, with him, "We were the first that ever burst
into that Silent Sea"; to witness, with him, strange and even hor-
rible phenomena that seem to defy all the ascertained laws of nature,
a phantasmagoria that can have no reality and no origin other than
the phantasy of minds disordered by the conflict of strong emotions
and blinded by glittering hopes long held before the imagination of
mankind, hopes long deferred and now threatened with total ex-
tinction by the triumphant progress of scientific enquiry.
Let it be admitted, then, that this is no field for the casual amateur;
for the man who merely wishes to take a rapid glance at the phe-
nomena and thereupon form his own conclusions; for the person who
approaches it in the hope of finding solace for some personal bereave-
ment; for the dilettante who merely seeks a new and sensational
hobby. It is a field of research which at every step demands in the
highest degree the scientific spirit and all round scientific training and
knowledge ;
a field which gives the widest scope for the virtues of the
scientific intellect and character and which, just because it makes
these demands and affords this scope, is of the greatest value as an in-
tellectual discipline.
Here the mind long disciplined in other branches of science may
find the supreme test of its powers and its training, tests of impar-
tial observation, of relevant selection, of sagacious induction and
deduction, of resolute discounting of emotional bias and personal in-
fluence. Here, better than in any other field, it may learn to recog-
nize its own limitations, limitations of knowledge, of power, of prin-
ciple; and to recognize also the limitations of science and philosophy
themselves, their inadequacy to give final answers to problems which
mankind has long answered with ready-made formulae, handed down
from the dim dawn of human reflection, and before which it now
halts with burning desire for certainty or unsatisfied longing for
more light.

no sufficient grounds for excluding it from our Universities. Has not
the teaching of all science in our schools and Universities been vigor-
ously opposed on just such grounds, on the ground that such teach-
ing might lead young people into intellectual and moral error, or
raise in their souls insoluble problems and conflicts that would de-
stroy their peace of mind? That question has been decisively an-
swered. Our Western civilization has definitely repudiated the old
way of authority, has committed itself irrevocably to live by knowl-
edge, such knowledge as the methods of science can attain. It can-
not return to live by instinct and traditional beliefs; it has gone so
far along the path of knowledge and of self-direction in the light
of knowledge that it cannot stop or turn back without disaster. The
inclusion of Psychical Research in the scientific studies of our Uni-
versities is the inevitable last step in this advance from a social state
founded on instinct and tradition to one that relies upon knowledge
and reason.
But it may be answered by our opponents. The introduction of
Science to our Universities was justified, in spite of its risks, because
Science offers a mass of well established truths, truths which are in-
dispensable to the life of the modern state. Psychical Research has
rightly been excluded because it furnishes no such body of established
truth ; it has solved no problems, has attained to no sure conclusions.
Let us admit that this contention also is not without substance and
force. But to accept it as a sufficient argument would be disastrous.
It would imply a false and fatally narrow view of the functions of
our Universities. It is on just such grounds that the movement
against the teaching of evolution takes it stand. It is said that evo-
lutionary biology must not be studied by young people, because evo-
lution is not an established fact, but merely a theory, or a mass of
unverified hypotheses. Yet all enlightened opinion rejects this reason-
ing, rightly holding that the teaching of established truth is only one
of, and perhaps not the most important of, the functions of a modern
University. Such teaching may perhaps be the sole or main function
of Technical Schools. Our Universities have other, higher, more
important functions.
We may, I think, distinguish three main functions of the Univer-
sity, as follows: First, the function of educating the young people
within its gates; secondly, the function of research, of extending the
bounds of knowledge; thirdly, a function which, as the life of the
modern State assumes an accelerating complexity, becomes more and

modern State assumes an accelerating complexity, becomes more and
152 WILLIAM MCDOUGALL
more important, namely, the function of exerting a controlling in-
fluence in the formation of public opinion on all vital matters. Con-
sider each of these three great functions in relation to our question:
Should Psychical Research find a place in our Universities?
First, then, the educational function. Under this head we may
properly distinguish two very different, though inseparable, sub-
functions; namely, first, the imparting of knowledge; secondly, in-
tellectual and moral discipline. It is only as regards the former
of these that Psychical Research is open to the indictment of its op-
ponents. Let us admit, for the purpose of the argument, that it has
not achieved any conclusions that may be taught as firmly established
truths. That admission denies it a role only in what we may roughly
estimate as one-sixth of the total field of activity of the modern
University, a fraction of the field which is its lowest or least im-
portant part.
As regards the other educational functions, intellectual training
and moral discipline, it may well be claimed for Psychical Re-
search that it ranks very high, perhaps highest of all possible sub-
jects of University Study. For consider In what does such dis-
cipline consist? First, in attacking problems patiently and resolute-
ly, in spite of failures and disappointments, in spite of uncertainty
that any solution may be attainable. Surely, in this respect Psychical
Research may claim a foremost place ! No other field of study makes
such large demands on the patience and resolution of the student.
Secondly, the discipline of observing exactly and recording faith-
fully phenomena presented to our senses. There is a lower form of
such discipline to which the young student of science is extensively
subjected ; namely, the task of recording as exactly as possible all he
can observe within some very limited field ;
as when he has to weigh
exactly some chemical substance, or when he is set down before a
microscope and required to draw what is there presented to his view.
Psychical Research offers little scope for discipline of just this kind;
but this is a lower form of observation, one which does not of itself
lead to discovery. There is a higher form of observation which re-
quires selective sagacity; it is conducted with a problem in view and
under the guidance of some hypothesis which is to be tested. It re-
quires the observer to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant, to
look for the relevant, to concentrate upon it, and to devise ex-
periments which shall isolate or accentuate the relevant. For dis-
cipline in this higher kind of directed observation, Psychical Research

Secondly, the discipline of observing exactly and recording faith-
fully phenomena presented to our senses. There is a lower form of
such discipline to which the young student of science is extensively
subjected; namely, the task of recording as exactly as possible all he
can observe within some very limited field ; as when he has to weigh
exactly some chemical substance, or when he is set down before a
microscope and required to draw what is there presented to his view.
Psychical Research offers little scope for discipline of just this kind;
but this is a lower form of observation, one which does not of itself
lead to discovery. There is a higher form of observation which re-
quires selective sagacity; it is conducted with a problem in view and
under the guidance of some hypothesis which is to be tested. It re-
quires the observer to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant, to
look for the relevant, to concentrate upon it, and to devise ex-
periments which shall isolate or accentuate the relevant. For dis-
cipline in this higher kind of directed observation, Psychical Research
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY 153
offers unlimited opportunities and makes upon the observer demands
of the highest order. Then as regards the reasoning processes by aid
of which general conclusions are drawn from the phenomena ob-
served. Here the demands upon the thinker in the field of Psychical
Research are very great and the discipline consequently severe. The
physicist or chemist observes the reactions of a single sample of some
substance under particular conditions, and is forthwith in a position
to state a general conclusion with high probability. The biologist
observes some particular feature in fifty or one hundred specimens
of some species and, without great risk, makes a generalization as
probably true of all members of the species.
But the Psychical Researcher is dealing with the most complex and
highly individualized of all known objects, namely human beings;
before he can summarize his observations in any generalized state-
ment, he must exercise infinite caution, observe unlimited precautions,
be ready to allow for an immense range of possible disturbing factors
of unknown nature and magnitude. And, when he proceeds to ap-
ply statistical treatment to his data of observation, he finds himself
facing problems of unrivalled delicacy. For he can never, like other
scientists, be content with the comfortable assumption that each of his
unit facts is exactly or even approximately equivalent to every other
one of the same general order.
If, by reason of the complexity and delicacy of its problems, Psy-
chical Research rivals all other branches of science, it far surpasses
them all in respect of the demands it makes on character and, con-
sequently, in respect of the character-discipline which it affords. It
requires perfectly controlled temper, and a large and understanding
tolerance of human weaknesses of every kind, intellectual and moral
alike; an infinite patience in face of renewed disappointments; a
moral courage which faces not merely the risk and even the probability
of failure, but also the risk of loss of reputation for judgment, balance,
and sanity itself. And, the most insidious of all dangers, the danger
of emotional bias in favour of one or other solution of the problem
in hand, is apt to be infinitely greater for the Psychical Re-
searcher than for the worker in any other field of sicence; for, not
only is he swayed by strong sentiments within his own breast, but
also he knows that both the scientific world and the general public
will react with strong emotional bias to any conclusion he may an-
nounce, just because such conclusions must have intimate bearing on
the great controversy between Science and Religion, a controversy

154 WILLIAM MCDOUGALL
which, in spite of the soothing reassurances which great scientists and
religious leaders now utter in unison, is still acute and may well be-
come again even more embittered and violent than it has been in
the past.
As regards the second function of the University, the extension of
knowledge, Psychical Research may boldly claim its place within the
fold ; on this ground any opposition to it can only arise from narrow
dogmatic ignorance, that higher kind of ignorance which so often
goes with a wealth of scientific knowledge, the ignorance which per-
mits a man to lay down dogmatically the boundaries of our knowl-
edge and to exclaim "ignorabimus." This cry "we shall not, can-
not know !" is apt to masquerade as scientific humility, while, in
reality, it expresses an unscientific arrogance and philosophic in-
competence. For the man who utters it arrogates to himself a knowl-
edge of the limits of human knowledge and capacity that is wholly
unwarranted and illusory. To cry ignorabimus in face of the prob-
lems of Psychical Research, and to refuse on that ground to support
or countenance its labour, is disingenuous camouflage; for the as-
sertion that we shall not and cannot know the answers to these prob-
lems implies a knowledge which we certainly have not yet attained
and which, if in principle it be attainable, lies in the distant future
when the methods of Psychical Research shall have been systematic-
ally developed and worked for all they may be worth. The history
of Science is full of warnings against such dogmatic agnosticism, the
agnosticism which does not content itself with the frank and humble
avowal that we do not know, but which presumes to assert that we
cannot know.
Let us suppose that, after forty years of tentative skirmishing in
the wilderness, Psychical Research, in part as the consequence of this
course of lectures, should be received within the scientific fold and
systematically cultivated in our Universities; and suppose that, after
a hundred years of such cultivation, its representatives, surveying the
results of all the work done, should find themselves compelled to ut-
ter a purely negative verdict, to assert that Psychical Research had
attained to no positive answers to any of the problems it had set out
to solve. What then ? We should still have to repeat There is the
gate to which we have no key; there is the veil through which we
may not see. But, also, we should still have to add And there the
Master-knot of Human Fate ! And, though Science might then turn
aside, baffled and discouraged, it would at least have given some re-

aside, baffled and discouraged, it would at least have given some re-
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY 155
spectable foundation for the cry Ignorabimus and have made some
real contribution to our knowledge of the limitations of human
knowledge.
But, some hearer will object, this question of the limits of human
knowledge is one not for Science but for Philosophy; and in all our
Universities Philosophy has long had a well recognized place and its
numerous representatives; it is for the philosophers to answer the
questions which Science leaves unsolved. Such an objection would
imply an old-fashioned and quite mistaken view of the scope and
functions of Philosophy.
Philosophy may rightly claim to teach us how to think, how to live,
and how to die. It may answer the question Given the present state
of the world and of our knowledge of it, what ought I to do? But
it is wholly incompetent to answer the questions What may I hope?
What may I expect: A cosmogony that is to be more than a fanciful
speculation must be a scientific cosmogony; and, as science progresses,
our- cosmogony must change with it. Every cosmogony that profes-
ses to be philosophical rather than scientific is a hollow pretense. Only
Science working by the methods of Science can presume to answer the
question What is? Philosophy must learn that its proper field is
defined by the question What ought to be?
And here I will ask leave to revert to the disciplinary, the educa-
tional, function of Psychical Research with special reference to stu-
dents of Philosophy. In my opinion, formed through considerable con-
tact with such students, their chief lack is knowledge of Science ; and
of all forms of Science that which can most enlighten them in litera-
ture can go far to induce in them that which so many of them need,
namely, a clear recognition of the limitations of the scope of Philoso-
phy and a corresponding humility in themselves as philosophers. For
here they will find that questions which philosophers through all the
ages have answered in their peculiar and utterly diverse fashions are
capable of being approached by the methods of Science ; and the mere
act of following in imagination such lines of approach can hardly
fail to bring home to the student the fact that the methods of Phil-
osophy, divorced from Science, are of no avail. He will be brought
to realize that Philosophy, whether it aims to sketch the main features
of the Universe or seeks to instruct us regarding the values and the
duties of mankind, must, in both cases, proceed from the fullest pos-
sible knowledge of what Science has achieved, or lay itself open to

those charges of futility and ignorant presumption which so often
have been launched against it.
What, then, are the essential questions on which we may expect
new light from Psychical Research? They may all be resumed in
one, namely Does Mind transcend matter ? Or more fully stated
Is all that we call mental, intellectual or spiritual activity, is all un-
derstanding and reason, all moral effort, volition, and personality,
merely the outcome and expression of a higher synthesis of physical
structures and processes and, therefore, subject to the same general
laws and interpretable by the same general principles as those which
Physical Science arrives at from the study of the inanimate world?
Or are mental activities, are all or some of the essential functions
of personality, in some degree independent of the physical basis with
which they are so intricately interwoven? Have they their own
peculiar nature, interpretable only in terms of principles quite other
than those whose validity has been proved by the victory of man over
his physical environment?
It is the old problem of materialism versus spiritualism or idealism,
of mechanism versus vitalism in biology ; or, as I would prefer to for-
mulate it, the problem of animism versus mechanistic-monism.1
This
has been the central problem of Philosophy for more than two thou-
sand years; and always the philosophers have been pretty equally
divided into two groups, those who say "Yes" and those who say
"No". The course of development of modern Science has on the
whole tended strongly to give predominance to the view which denies
the transcendence of Mind. Idealistic philosophers have struggled in
vain to stem this tide, urging that it is absurd to regard as subject to
the laws formulated for the interpretation of physical phenomena, the
mind, which conceives the physical world and which has itself in some
degree created those phenomena.
But this and all similar reasoning remains inconclusive and must
ever remain so. We are up against a question of empirical fact ; and
the answer to the question can be brought only by the methods of
empirical Science.
Many of the greater physicists have inclined to think that their own
science points towards a positive answer to this question of transcend-
ence; and it is possible that the progress of physical science and of
formulation of the problem is explained and defended in my book,
Body and Mind.

biology may in the course of time lead us to a decisive answer to this
central problem. But, if so, the answer will be achieved only very
slowly by very indirect methods of attack. The essence of Psychical
Research is the proposal to attack the problem directly. If Mind in
any manner and degree transcends the physical world and its laws,
surely it may somehow and somewhere be possible to obtain direct
evidence of the fact by the methods of science, by observation of phe-
nomena and by reasoning from them ! That is the proposition on which
Psychical Research is founded. Psychical Research proposes, then,
to go out to seek such phenomena, namely phenomena pointing direct-
ly to the transcendence of Mind, and, if possible, to provoke them
experimentally. Phenomena of this kind have been reported in
every age; and in every age antecedent to our own age, dominated
as it is by the principles of scientific evidence, their obvious implica-
tion has been accepted. Psychical Research proposes to marshal all
such sporadically and spontaneously occuring phenomena, to examine
them critically, to classify them, to discover if possible the laws of
their occurence and to add to them experimentally induced phe-
nomena of similar types.
Consider now the third great function of our Univerities, the
guidance of public opinion. It is perhaps from this point of view
that the admission of Psychical Research to the Universities is most
urgently needed. Here is a most obscure question vitally affecting
the intellectual outlook and the moral life of men in general. Surely
it is for the Universities to find, if possible, the light that we need!
What ground can be found for their neglect or repudiation of the
task? Several such grounds are implied, though rarely formulated
explicitly.
First it may be said, the task is one for the philosophers and theo-
logians, who are well represented in the Universities. But phil-
osophers and theologians have wrestled with it for long ages; and
there is no faintest reason to believe that by their methods alone they
can achieve in the future any greater success than they have at-
tained in the past. Let us glance at the grounds they offer us for ac-
cepting a positive answer in face of the general tendency of science
to insist on the negative answer. They may all be reduced to two.
First, the moral ground; to believe in the transcendence of Mind is
a moral need of mankind in general. Such belief, it is said, is es-
sential to the maintenance and progress of our civilization. Our
civilization has been built up on a foundation of and under the sway

civilization has been built up on a foundation of and under the sway
158 WILLIAM MCDOUOALL
of such belief; and, if that foundation and that influence should be
taken away, our civilization must surely decline; even though it be
possible for exceptional individuals to continue to attain high moral
excellence in an attitude of stoic agnosticism. This argument is re-
spectable; it has weight and substance. Given a balance of evidence
and the impossibility of assured knowledge, we would be justified
in accepting that view which seems the more conducive to human
welfare. This argument, which perhaps William James was the
first to state and defend explicitly, is, I suppose, implied by those who
ask us to continue to accept the transcendence of Mind as an article
of faith. But this moral argument in no sense justifies a refusal to
countenance or support Psychical Research, which is nothing less than
an endeavour to replace faith by knowledge in this matter. If, from
time to time, religious leaders exhort their flocks to eschew Psychical
Research and pour scorn upon it and all its works, we cannot wholly
acquit them of a preference for ignorance over against knowledge.
It would seem that they fear the result of Psychical Research ; they
fear either a negative outcome of the great enquiry, or a positive out-
come which shall disturb the minds of their flocks by bringing knowl-
edge not strictly in accord with traditional beliefs. Therefore they
ask us to remain content to accept these beliefs on authority. But it
is too late to advocate that policy with any hope of success. As I said
before, it is obvious that we have left the age of authority behind
and that our civilization is irrevocably committed to the attempt to
live by knowledge, rather than by instinct and authority. Consider
now the second main ground offered for acceptance of the positive
answer. If we ask whence does ecclesiastical authority derive the
views it seeks to impose, the answer is that they are founded upon
alleged historical events of a remote age, events of just such a nature
as Psychical Research is concerned to investigate at first hand as
contemporary events. However we regard the evidence of those re-
mote events, we can hardly claim that the lapse of some two thousand
years has made the evidence of them less disputable ; and in any case it
is clear that mankind in general is ceasing to find that evidence suf-
ficient. More and more we are inclined to say You ask us to ac-
cept the transcendence of mind because we have certain records of
events which, if the records be above suspicion, would seem to justify
and establish that belief; and yet you would forbid us to examine,
in a candid and critical spirit, similar events that are reported as oc-
curing among friends and neighbours. Truly, he who repudiates

PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY 159
Psychical Research in the interests of religion and of religious author-
ity cannot easily be absolved from the charge of a timid obscurantism.
But it is not only in respect of this high problem of transcendence
that public opinion needs from the Universities guidance of a kind
which they can give only if they cultivate Psychical Research. That
after all is a problem for the intellectual few; although the views
of those few may have far-reaching influence upon the lives of the
many. The great public does not much concern itself with the
question Are we truly in some degree rational beings capable of
moral choice and creative endeavour? In the main they continue to
regard themselves as such beings, in spite of all statements of scientists
and philosophers to the contrary. But they are much concerned to
know what kind and degree of influence Mind can exert uporl bodily
processes, what truth there is in the claims of many sects and schools
of mental healers. They do keenly desire to know whether there is
a kernel of truth in the widely accepted claims of communication with
departed friends; whether each of us, as science tells us, is forever
shut off from all his fellows by the distorting and inadequate means
of communication provided by sense-organs and muscular system;
whether there is not some common stock of memory and experience
upon which men may draw in ways not recognized by Science;
whether at death each of us is wholly exterminated; whether ghost
stories are founded only on illusion and other forms of error.
There is in all lands an immense amount of eager questioning about
such matters; immense amounts of time and energy are given to
ineffective efforts to obtain more light on such questions. And un-
fortunately there is a multitude of persons who for the sake of filthy
lucre take advantage of these eager desires, these strong emotional
needs, and of the prevailing lack of sure knowledge, to falsify, obscure
and fabricate the evidence.
It is perhaps this last aspect of the present situation which most
urgently calls for action of the Universities. In spite of the immense
and growing prestige of Science and its steady and scornful negative
to all such questioning, the whole civilized world increasingly be-
comes the scene of a confused welter of amateur investigation, of
conflicting opinions, of bitter controversies, of sects and schools and
parties, each confidently asserting its own views and scornfully ac-
cusing the others of error, and of woeful blindness or wilful deception.
The negations of the scientific world are of little or no effect upon
this chaos of conflicting beliefs and ardent desires. And so long as
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY 159
Psychical Research in the interests of religion and of religious author-
ity cannot easily be absolved from the charge of a timid obscurantism.
But it is not only in respect of this high problem of transcendence
that public opinion needs from the Universities guidance of a kind
which they can give only if they cultivate Psychical Research. That
after all is a problem for the intellectual few; although the views
of those few may have far-reaching influence upon the lives of the
many. The great public does not much concern itself with the
question-Are we truly in some degree rational beings capable of
moral choice and creative endeavour? In the main they continue to
regard themselves as such beings, in spite of all statements of scientists
and philosophers to the contrary. But they are much concerned to
know what kind and degree of influence Mind can exert uporl bodily
processes, what truth there is in the claims of many sects and schools
of mental healers. They do keenly desire to know whether there is
a kernel of truth in the widely accepted claims of communication with
departed friends; whether each of us, as science tells us, is forever
shut off from all his fellows by the distorting and inadequate means
of communication provided by sense-organs and muscular system;
whether there is not some common stock of memory and experience
upon which men may draw in ways not recognized by Science;
whether at death each of us is wholly exterminated; whether ghost
stories are founded only on illusion and other forms of error.
There is in all lands an immense amount of eager questioning about
such matters; immense amounts of time and energy are given to
ineffective efforts to obtain more light on such questions. And un-
fortunately there is a multitude of persons who for the sake of filthy
lucre take advantage of these eager desires, these strong emotional
needs, and of the prevailing lack of sure knowledge, to falsify, obscure
and fabricate the evidence.
It is perhaps this last aspect of the present situation which most
urgently calls for action of the Universities. In spite of the immense
and growing prestige of Science and its steady and scornful negative
to all such questioning, the whole civilized world increasingly be-
comes the scene of a confused welter of amateur investigation, of
conflicting opinions, of bitter controversies, of sects and schools and
parties, each confidently asserting its own views and scornfully ac-
cusing the others of error, and of woeful blindness or wilful deception.
The negations of the sci~ntific world are of little or no effect upon
this chaos of conflicting beliefs and ardent desires. And so long as
160 WILLIAM MCDOUGALL
Science stands apart, coldly refusing to take a hand in the game, re-
fusing to take seriously the questions asked, refusing to bring to bear
upon the many phenomena that keep alive these conflicts, these hopes,
and these beliefs, its powerful, highly organized apparatus of investi-
gation, its negations will continue to exert but little influence toward
stilling the tempest.
Let me state the demand upon our Universities at its simplest and
lowest. Let us suppose that we are firmly convinced that no positive
knowledge is attainable, that the outcome of a sustained, organized,
and co-operative attack upon the problems of Psychical Research,
such as the Universities alone are capable of making, must lead to
purely negative conclusions; I submit that, nevertheless, we ought to
recognize such enquiry as a task which the present state of chaos
in the public mind urgently requires of the Universities that they
undertake and steadfastly pursue.
The situation, its needs and its demands on the Universities may
be illustrated on a small clear-cut scale by one particular problem
which has long been recognized as crucial in Psychical Research,
namely the problem of telepathy. Does telepathy occur? That is
to say Do we, do minds, communicate with one another in any
manner and degree otherwise than through the sense-organs and
through the bodily organs of expression and the physical media which
science recognizes?
Science asserts that no such communication occurs or can occur.
Yet in all ages antecedent to our own, belief in such communication
has been universal. And in our own sceptical age and community,
such belief is still very general. It is held by all intelligent Christians ;
for it is implied in the practice of prayer and communion. A very
large proportion of intelligent educated persons believe they have ob-
served or experienced instances of such communication. In that high-
ly educated, scientific and sceptical class, the medical men, it is I
think true to say that about one in three believes that he has first-
hand knowledge of indisputable instances of it. A careful, highly
critical statistical survey of such sporadic instances, made by persons
of the highest qualifications, has resulted in a strongly positive ver-
dict. A number of carefully conducted attempts to obtain evidence
of it under experimental laboratory conditions have given equally
positive results. A number of men of great distinction and of the
highest intellectual and moral qualifications have announced them-
selves as convinced, after due enquiry, of its occurrence. Yet, in

PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY 161
spite of all this, Science, especially Science as represented in the
Universities, refuses to regard the question of its occurrence as one
to be taken seriously, as one deserving of investigation. And why?
Simply because we cannot at present see how such communication
can take place.
Now, to deny that phenomena of a certain kind may occur on the
ground that we cannot understand how they may be brought about,
is very unsatisfactory even in the sphere of physical science. It is
still more unsatisfactory and positively misleading in the biological
sciences. And in relation to any events in which the human mind
or personality plays a part, it is reprehensible and utterly inadmissible
as a ground of denial or refusal of investigation.
What more suitable task for a research department of a University
can be conceived than the task of investigating such a problem. The
individual man of science may and does offer two valid excuses for
ignoring this and other problems of Psychical Research. He may
say That is not my line, I have other things to do. Or he may say
I have tried and have had purely negative results. But our Uni-
versities as a group of national institutions cannot excuse themselves
in this way. The signs of the times call aloud to them that they
shall follow the courageous lead of Clark University, shall frankly
acknowledge their responsibility and welcome Psychical Research to
an honoured place within their gates. Nowhere else may we hope
to find the calm critical temper of scientific enquiry sufficiently de-
veloped and sustained; to no other institutions or associations can
we hopefully entrust the task of shedding the cold clear light of
science upon this obscure and much troubled field of vague hopes and
vaguer speculations.
In conclusion, greatly daring, I will venture to say a few words
in reply to a question which I feel sure many of my hearers wish to
put to me, the question, namely In your opinion has Psychical Re-
search hitherto achieved any positive results? I am not the sort of
person who holds a great number of clear-cut positive and negative
beliefs. I am rather a person of the kind that deals in probabilities
and degrees of probability, recognizing that our best formulations are

I do feel very strongly that the evidence for them is such that the
scientific world is not justified in merely pooh-poohing it, but rather
is called upon to seek out and investigate alleged cases with the utmost
care and impartiality.

PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY
BY HANS DRIESCH
1. Philosophy is theory of order. The word "theory" means
systematic knowledge ; the meaning of the word "order" is indefinable.
As the word "systematic" implies order itself, we may call philosophy
the ordered knowledge about order; thus we find order on the sub-
jective and on the objective side.
The order with which philosophy has to deal is related to "every-
thing." There is nothing that is not a possible object of philosophy.
We, therefore, call the object of philosophy "the Universe," if we
take this word in a very wide sense, embracing subjectivity as well
as its counterpart.
Philosophy in the first place takes the Universe as my Universe, as
related to the Ego, "my" Ego as possessed or consciously had by I
I do not say "me." Thus far philosophy is logic in the widest sense of
the word. In the second place philosophy raises the question whether
the word "in itself" or absolute has a meaning. It finds that it has;
and for this reason a second part of philosophy, called metaphysics, is
possible.
All so-called sciences, the word taken in the widest sense, are
branches of philosophy which live, as it were, an independent life.
Psychical P.esearch is one of these branches, or, rather, the word
"Psychical Research" or "Para- or Meta-psychology" to introduce
the terms used in Germany and France denotes several branches of
philosophy that have become independent to a certain extent. For,
at the first glance at least, there is not one Parapsychology but there
are several Parapsychologies, which may one day unite into one, there
being several groups of psychic phenomena which, at first in any case,
are as different from one another as, e. g., chemistry is from optics.
Let me only mention telepathy and levitation, which in the first
resort have certainly nothing in common except that they are "super-
normal". It is our hope, of course, that there may ultimately be but
one parapsychology, just as there is but one science of inanimate nature
in our day, even chemistry and physics having come together.

2. We now approach our proper subject, the relation between
Psychical Research and general philosophy, and it seems advisable to
me to start from the former, Psychical Research, as we have seen,
being a collection of rather different phenomena. To take it as one
in the very beginning would mean to proceed in a dogmatic way.
I know very well that there are certain hypotheses, the spiritualistic
hypothesis for example, which allow of a great unification and simpli-
fication. But they are hypotheses at present, and the real philosopher
must approach his subject in quite an unbiased way, looking merely
upon the facts and trying to find a certain type of order in them.
This has also been the method that has made biology an independent
science, whilst all biologists who start from physical and chemical
problems find nothing but that from which they have started in the
organism again, and have blinded themselves, as it were, with regard
to the problems of life as they are.
If now we look upon the various sides of Psychical Research in the
way described, we realize at once that they show a relation to a great
number of different problems of general philosophy, that the one
thing belongs here and the other there, and that only ultimately, in
the highest areas of philosophy, which means in that part where
philosophy itself has reached its last very general principles, the
philosophic importance of Parapsychology taken as one may be studied
with some advantage.
3. The phenomena of telepathy, mind reading, and clairvoyance
(I intentionally use the old historical names to avoid misunderstand-
ing, well aware of the fact that better names have been introduced,
by M. Sudre for example) all those phenomena stand in a very
close and clear relation to the theory of knowing as developed by
general philosophy.
For reasons of simplicity we now shall consider philosophy from
the metaphysical point of view exclusively. That means that we
shall start from the assumption that there is or exists something in an
absolute way, and that "our'* universe, or, in other terms, the content
of our experience, is the picture or appearance of that which exists.
In this sense we may be said to start from a
"
realistic" point of view.
But the word realism means by no means materialism. For, first,
even so-called matter is only appearance of something absolute to us,
and secondly, there is certainly something else in the Absolute besides
that which gives us the appearance of matter, this something mani-
festing itself already in the phenomena of orderly organic life.

PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY 165
From our metaphysical or, if you would prefer this, from our
realistic point of view, now, all our knowing about particulars comes
from two sources: there is a something which affects and there are
minds which are affected. The result is a particular conscious pos-
session on the part of the Ego in the form of appearance, the visual
image of a flower, e. g., or even more, namely a flower regarded as
a material so-called thing.
How is knowing possible? Metaphysics has only one way of inter-
pretation left to itself, so it seems to me. It must look upon Reality
as composed of subject-points and of objects, and must assume that a
primordial relation, which we shall call knowing potentia, exists in an
unexplainable original way between these two sides of Reality. For
it must not be forgotten that the one who knows is also part of
Reality. To argue in a different way would lead into nonsense, for
it would mean to assume that there is Reality and something besides.
We shall not discuss here the problem whether the mind, when
affected, attributes something to the result of the affection, namely
the image or thing as an appearance, from its own qualities or proper-
ties. This is the problem studied in the so-called theory of knowl-
edge. In any case there are two sources of all knowledge; the af-
fecting something and the affected mind, connected by the original
or primordial relation, "knowing potentia"; and the result of the
affection is actual knowing in the form of appearance.
In normal life, now, all affection leading to particular knowledge
starts from that side of Reality which appears under the form ot
matter, and takes its way by stimulating that part of Reality which
appears in the form of our body and in particular our sense organs
and our brain.
This is a great miracle, and is by no means understood.
Think of this: The ultimate result of the affection is a certain re-
arrangement of the electrons and protons in my brain and then I
"see" the flower "outside in space'*. This in fact is a real enigma
and will be an enigma forever. Things would be much easier for
us to understand if the electrons and protons of the brain would "see"
themselvesf but this, as you know, is not the case.
And now Psychical Research sets in; it tells us that in telepathy
and mind reading we may not only "know" about things or material
states, but also, and this in an immediate way, about the content of
another mind's knowing, be it an actual Ego-knowing or merely a
possible Ego-knowing, namely something that belongs to the sub-

possible Ego-knowing, namely something that belongs to the sub-
166 HANS DRIESCH
or unconscious content of that mind. The latter is the case, wher-
ever the mind reader reveals something of which the sitter is not
actually thinking.
The simplest kind of mind reading is so-called exteriorization of
sensibility or, in short, extrasensibility, so well described by Dr.
Pagenstecher in Mexico: his medium when in the hypnotic state felt
his pain whilst he was hurting himself by a needle, tasted the sugar
he ate, etc.
All our normal knowledge about another mind's contents is reached
in an indirect way; we see and hear that the other being moves and
speaks, and then infer that his mind is in a certain state. In the
realm of psychic phenomena the indirect way is turned into a direct
one. Sense organs and brain are excluded. The knowing goes from
subject to subject immediately; the relation "knowing potentia,"
therefore, must have existed also between them.
I know well that there are some psychic researchers who try to
explain telepathy and mind reading by means of a so-called radia-
tion of a physical character, starting from one brain and affecting
the other. But I have shown already in my London address that
this hypothesis is absolutely impossible. Only with regard to ex-
trasensibility this hypothesis might perhaps be applied, because in
this case the same relation between the state of the brain and sen-
sation may exist in the agent and the percipient. But this is ex-
cluded in all complicated cases of telepathy; and for this reason the
theory of physical radiation is not even probable with regard to
those simple cases.
This, then, is the new statement which the first part of Parapsy-
chology attributes to the theory of knowing: the relation of knowing
potentia exists also among subjects, and not between subjects and the
object side of Reality exclusively; and it may be filled with content
along those new and abnormal lines.
And this seems to show that all subjects are One in some last
resort.
The phenomena of so-called dissociation of personality tend al-
ready in this direction : there is one mind, but two or more Egos are
implanted upon it, knowing about one another's contents as if they
were strangers. One Ego knows here in a form as if it knew about
the knowing of somebody else. And the same is true in dramatic
dreams.

I may also refer to certain embryological experiments, which I
have carried out myself many years ago. If you separate the cleavage
cells of an embryo from one another, say in the four-cell stage, you
get as many complete organisms as you have isolated cells. And two
eggs may be forced to form one giant organism together. Instead
of the One the many; instead of the many the One.
Does it not seem as if the "many" were all united in the "One" in
the last resort, and might not this viewpoint be applied to our first
class of psychic phenomena?
4. So-called clairvoyance is much more difficult to approach than
telepathy and mind reading are, and in particular so when what is
usually called Psychometry is in question, which means when an ob-
ject given into the hands of a medium reveals its whole past history
to the psychic person.
Three different forms of clairvoyance must be distinguished:
clairvoyance into actual material conditions or states at a spatial dis-
tance or of microscopical dimensions, clairvoyance into the past, and,
finally, clairvoyance into the future, i.e., premonition or prophecy.
At first we shall only consider the two first of these three species of
clairvoyance.
Very simple cases of clairvoyance are given if a Psychic knows
the chemical nature of some substance which is prevented from stim-
ulating his sense organs. These cases, as described by Chowrin for
instance, must, of course, not be confused with extrasensibility as de-
scribed above. In most cases it is not very easy to exclude mind read-
ing, of course. In the case of Swedenborg, who "saw" the fire at
Stockholm and the moment and locality of its being stopped, pure
clairvoyance is probable, as it is in many other cases, the phenomena
of the so-called divining rod belonging most probably also to this
field of phenomena.
Let me shortly refer to the experiments carried out with Mr.
Kahn in the Institute Metapsychique at Paris: Kahn "reads" folded
letters without touching them. Here also telepathic influences are
very improbable, whilst in some of the performances of M. Forthuny
their possibility cannot be excluded definitively. The performances
of M. Forthuny, part of which I have personally seen, are extremely
impressive. Psychometry may be implied here. For even if we can-
not exclude telepathy and mind reading in a decided manner, it re-

mains true that he is in immediate contact with a certain object,
which in this case is a human person.
How may we understand clairvoyance, that is, how may we relate
it to a class of facts already known? For this is the usual meaning
of the word "understanding". If we put aside the spiritualistic hy-
pothesis at first, only one possibility of understanding is left to us, so
it seems to me, namely, that the subconscious Ego is omniscient to a
certain degree, as Leibnitz believed his monads to be, and that in cer-
tain persons, called mediums, parts of the total knowledge about the
universe transcend the threshold of consciousness. "Why, then, are
we not all actually omniscient ?" so you will ask. And the only pos-
sible answer to this question may be, that we are not because it would
make us unfit for life ;
we should be confused by knowing too much.
We must know only what is important for us in each moment.
This is an idea brought forward already by Bergson. The whole
matter is very unsatisfactory, and I therefore should not like to deal
with it again and so merely refer to my London address.
5. But let me say something on that strange fact called psy-
chometryj which I have discussed in my London address but very
shortly. Here also we shall at first exclude all spiritualism. If we
do, then, so it seems to me, the only way open to us is to assume that
every object in the Universe is impressed in a certain way by its own
past history, and in particular so, but not exclusively, if this past his-
tory relates to human beings. The object, a knife or a ring for ex-
ample, is a material thing. Is for that reason its being impressed of
a physical kind? In other words, is there something in the material
conditions of the object that may reveal its history? This is hardly
thinkable, for it is the chief characteristic of non-living nature that
it only is at the present moment what it is, namely : a particular com-
plex of protons and electrons.
We may try to apply a more complicated hypothesis. Let us as-
sume that, by the aid of the object, the clairvoyant is brought into
connection with some other living mind and is now performing mind
reading of the well-known type. But should we be able to under-
stand this connecting role of the object without coming back to some
sort of physical impression upon it, which, we have said, is quite
unacceptable? And in a good many cases in the famous experi-
ments of Dr. Pagenstecher, for instance the person, in whose mind

PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY 169
the medium might be supposed to read, is dead. And we disregard
spiritualism at present.
I, therefore, must confess that I find it absolutely impossible to
offer you any psychometrical theory on the grounds upon which we
are moving at present. Clairvoyance without psychometry may at
least be related to a certain philosophical doctrine, namely that es-
tablished by Leibnitz, though, of course, this is also a very vague con-
sideration. But the role of the object, the non-living object, in psy-
chometry is the great enigma to us. If we consider this role as a di-
rect and immediate one, then there must be something "on" the ob-
ject which we are absolutely unable to understand, and if we regard
the object as a mere vehicle, destined to connect the medium's mind
with some other mind, it ultimately comes to the same, quite apart
from the question that a good many of these minds are dead. You
might say perhaps that the mere being seen or touched of the ob-
ject on the part of the medium enables the medium to come into
direct connection with some other mind; but even then the question
arises as to how it comes that just this object is able to play this
role. Again there must be something "on" it which we don't under-
stand.
Let me say one word more about the impossibility of any "radia-
tion" theory in connection with clairvoyance in general. That such
a theory is impossible with respect to mind reading and telepathy, I
have shown in my London address and also shortly mentioned above.
This theory formed on the analogy of tuning forks, is impossible here
as, first, it rests upon the impossible theory of a psycho-mechanical
so-called parallelism, and as, secondly, it is obliged to assume that the
conscious experiences of the agent and the percipient are exactly the
same, which is certainly not the case. With regard to clairvoyance
the radiation theory is quite impossible in the case of reading a letter
which is folded. The percipient knows about the meaning of the let-
ter, not about its visual image, which, whenever the letter is folded,
is a very complicated and chaotic one.
Other difficulties of the radiation theory have been very success-
fully explained by Tischner. And now radiation would not even suf-
fice for an explanation of psychometry !
Clairvoyance into microscopic dimensions, as discovered by Wa-
sielewski, might be explained by some sort of hyperaesthesia. But I
do not say that it must.

6. Premonition or prophecy is absolutely ununderstandable. For
if we say that time is nothing but a form of human experience, and
that that which appears to us in time is timeless in the last resort,
this is not much more than a playing with words. Osty is of the
opinion that premonitions which refer to a human being's fate may
often be reduced to mind reading in the Subconscious. This is cer-
tainly true, as far as no accidents from without are concerned. And
we may add that the effects of clairvoyance may also sometimes be
taken for premonition: the medium may say that somebody "will"
arrive, as it sees him already walking along the street. But a good
many cases of premonition, so it seems to me, cannot be reduced to
other classes of abnormalities in any way. Supposed, of course, that
they are quite certain. But ununderstandable as they may be, all
premonitions refer quite directly to the great philosophical problem
of freedom and of free will in particular, and are, in any case, very
important for us in this respect.
Whoever accepts premonition as a fact cannot accept freedom in
its strict sense, that is in the sense of indeterminism, at the same
time. Freedom would make abnormal premonition just as impos-
sible as normal calculation of any sort. For the chain of causal con-
tinuity is broken by freedom. One way, however, seems to be left:
you might say that premonition may go together with freedom if it
only refers to possibilities, if it says nothing but "this fact will happen
unless free will interferes." For we know that the contents of will-
ing present themselves to an Ego in a determined way, and that his
"free" action might only refer to a saying "yes" or "no" to these con-
tents. But even then a great difficulty presents itself, as already one
single free act would change the course of the whole universe in an
unpredictable way. Therefore premonition together with freedom
would be a matter of an enormous improbability and uncertainty,
unless we assume that "free" acts are extremely rare. Better per-
haps to reverse the matter and to say simply: whoever accepts pre-
monition cannot accept freedom. Here we have found a point where
Psychical Research is playing quite a decisive role with regard to
Philosophy.
Personally I should like to leave the question open until more
cases of premonition have become known.

7. The physical phenomena of Psychical Research, telekinesis,
levitation, materialization, and the like, have been met by much more
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY 171
mental resistance among both scientists and laymen than the psychical
phenomena have. Even those who tell us a good many stories about
telepathy themselves may deny even the possibility of paraphysics.
And yet it is here that Parapsychology is in closer connection with
well established and well known facts of science than any where else.
I may even go as far as to say: modern biology is already "psychical
research", along the physical side, itself.
The fundamental feature of all physical paraphenomena is this,
that mind is an agent able to promote material events, the word
"mind" being taken here in a very wide sense, including the Uncon-
scious and the Subconscious.
Let us begin by enumerating all cases in which a causal relation
between mind and material phenomena is already well known along
so-called normal lines.
In the first place there is so-called will in its relations to the move-
ments of my limbs, my tongue, etc. I "will", and something material
happens. This alone is the correct formula, for "I" am not "doing"
anything, as was already seen by Hume; except perhaps that "I"
may stop the doing on the part of the unconscious part of my mind,
as you must say if you are inclined to accept freedom. But. even
then the performance of moving my arm or, in speaking, my tongue
and lips is done by the mind as far as it is unconscious. And "I" do
not even known how that is done, "stimulating my motor nerves",
"contracting my muscles", etc. ; nay, as a layman in the field of physi-
ology and anatomy, I do not even know that all these things exist!
My mind knows them, and my mind also knows how to use them in
order to reach a certain end which alone is "willed" by the Ego.
Secondly, there is the psychical influence upon the secretion of the
glands of the body, so well established by the Russian physiologist
Pawlow in his studies on "psychical secretion". A smell of food
makes the glands of the digestive tract secrete, in man as well as in
the dog. This is not "willed" at all, a mere sensation or even imag-
ination is concerned here. But, on the other hand, the event is not
of the kind of an innate reflex. It rests upon a learning on the part
of the Unconscious in the way of association ; and it is also subjected
to the law of association in so far as a dog, for instance, may be
brought to the process of secretion by merely hearing a specific tune
which had always been presented to him when he got his food.
In the third place there are the physical effects of suggestion and

phenomena have. Even those who tell us a good many stories about
telepathy themselves may deny even the possibility of paraphysics.

of the Unconscious in the way of association; and it is also subjected
to the law of association in so far as a dog, for instance, may be
brought to the process of secretion by merely hearing a specific tune
which had always been presented to him when he got his food.
In the third place there are the physical effects of suggestion and
172 HANS DRIESCH
autosuggestion in the hypnotic or even in the waking state. All of
you know that in this way the bleeding of wounds may be stopped,
that so-called "colds" may be prevented or at least reduced to a
minimum, and that even, what is more, inflammations may be pro-
voked by, say, the touching of the skin by quite an ordinary piece of
metal, which is only "said" to be hot. And there are many other
phenomena of a similar kind.
Last, but not least, there is the modern aspect of general biology
as a whole. This aspect is becoming vitalistic more and more, and I
myself may claim to have played a certain part in this movement by
my own biological theories. These theories were most decidedly
based upon quite specific facts and are by no means lofty specula-
tions. Certain facts in the field of morphogenesis, embryology as
well as regeneration, can simply not be understood on a so-called
mechanistic foundation, which means on the assumption of a specific
given structure including nothing but the dynamic agents of physics
and chemistry. The development of complete organisms out of iso-
lated cleavage cells belongs here, and a good many other things. And
the unconscious non-mechanical factor at work in these cases may cer-
tainly be called "mind" in the widest sense of the word, though it is,
of course, by no means the so-called "Ego".
8. There are, then, non-mechanical mindlike agents which affect
matter and are affected by it. And, in order to explain the so-called
physical phenomena of parapsychology, we have to do nothing but to
enlarge the area of validity of known agents, which means to assume
that those non-mechanical agents are able to do still a good deal more
than we are normally acquainted with. They are not only able to af-
fect physiological processes, to direct and regulate the genesis of the
normal form, they may also provoke abnormal structures under the
guidance of imagination. This is what may be called an enlarged
Coueism but nothing else.
Let us keep well in mind that the action of what I have called
Entelechy in the field of biology proper does not "create" matter but
is only ordering pre-existing matter. And it is only this action of or-
dering, of directing which we have to assume also in parapsychology,
matter being everywhere. Mere assimilation, then, would be the
most simple instance of a long series of events of which so-called ma-
terialization would be the end.
All this, of course, is only valid in those cases where physical para-

All this, of course, is only valid in those cases where physical para-
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY 173
phenomena are happening in continuity with a medium's body. Con-
tinuous phenomena, to put it shortly, are in fact nothing but an en-
larged vitalism. As soon as we agree that there are also discontinu-
ous phenomena, so-called spook, apport, etc., our theory fails and we
are moving upon an absolutely unknown field.
But would it not be very narrow-minded to suppose that all
"fields" of reality must be known to us today, and that there is
nothing of an absolutely new character?
Facts are always the first thing in science. And a man who tells us
that certain facts "have never occurred and will never occur" as a
very well known personality verbally did is not a great critic, but a
negative dogmatist, very much resembling that famous professor of
physics who "proved" the impossibility of the railroad.
9. Discontinuous phenomena, in fact, are just as little understand-
able at present as psychometrical phenomena are, at least on non-
spiritualistic grounds. It even seems to me as if there were a certain
sort of relationship between both classes of phenomena, and this
brings me back once more to psychometry itself. In psychometry,
as we know, there must be something unknown on a given material
object, be it in an independent way or because this object is still
in some unknown actual relation to some rnind. In discontinuous
physical paraphenomena a certain amount of matter, which does
not stand in any perceivable continuity with a living body, must
nevertheless be in some sort of relation to it, and, in this respect, may
also be considered as having something on itself.
Perhaps we may say that in both cases there is still an actual con-
tinuity, absolutely unperceivable to ourselves, and in this way we
should avoid the action at a distance. The something which is "on"
a material object in psychometry would in this case be itself some
sort of materialized structure, perceivable only to those rare persons
which we call mediums, just as many phantoms are said to be only
perceivable to certain very exceptional persons.
But, of course, this assumption of an unperceivable connection in
the realm of those phenomena, which are de facto, i. e. as far as we
know, discontinuous, is a mere hypothesis, and the only advantage it
has, so it seems to me, is that it brings these phenomena together with
psychometry under one heading. Psychometrical objects would them-
selves be "spook"-objects to a certain extent.
But, in a certain very wide sense, embryology and regeneration,
from the vitalistic point of view at least, are already "spook," all
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY 173
phenomena are happening in continuity with a medium's body. Con-
tinuous phenomena, to put it shortly, are in fact nothing but an en-
larged vitalism. As soon as we agree that there are also discontinu-
ous phenomena, so-called spook, apport, etc., our theory fails and we
are moving upon an absolutely unknown field.
But would it not be very narrow-minded to suppose that all
"fields" of reality must be known to us today, and that there is
nothing of an absolutely new character?
Facts are always the first thing in science. And a man who tells us
that certain facts "have never occurred and will never occur"-as a
very well known personality verbally did-is not a great critic, but a
negative dogmatist, very much resembling that famous professor of
physics who "proved" the impossibility of the railroad.
9. Discontinuous phenomena, in fact, are just as little understand-
able at present as psychometrical phenomena arc, at least on non-
spiritualistic grounds. It even seems to me as if there were a certain
sort of relationship between both classes of phenomena, and this
brings me back once more to psychometry itself. In psychometry,
as we know, there must be something unknown on a given material
object, be it in an independent way or because this object is still
in some unknown actual relation to some mind. In discontinuous
physical paraphenomena a certain amount of matter, which does
not stand in any perceivable continuity with a living body, must
nevertheless be in some sort of relation to it, and, in this respect, may
also be considered as having something on itself.
Perhaps we may say that in both cases there is still an actual con-
tinuity, absolutely unperceivable to ourselves, and in this way we
should avoid the action at a distance. The something which is "on"
a material object in psychometry would in this case be itself some
sort of materialized structure, perceivable only to those rare persons
which we call mediums, just as many phantoms are said to be only
perceivable to certain very exceptional persons.
But, of course, this assumption of an unperceivable connection in
the realm of those phenomena, which are de facto, i. e. as far as we
know, discontinuous, is a mere hypothesis, and the only advantage it
has, so it seems to me, is that it brings these phenomena together with
psychometry under one heading. Psychometrical objects would them-
selves be "spook"-objects to a certain extent.
But, in a certain very wide sense, embryology and regeneration,
from the vitalistic point of view at least, are already "spook," all
174 HANS DRIESCH
questions of distance being quite evidently only questions of the
second order.
Only on the assumption that discontinuous phenomena are not
what they seem to be in the last resort is a certain sort of under-
standing possible here. That means that only on this assumption dis-
continuous phenomena also would belong to the realm of an enlarged
Coueism and vitalism. If you reject this assumption, "understanding"
becomes quite impossible. And it seems also to be in favor of our
theory that some light falls from it upon psychometry, as we have
said, and that this strange phenomenon acquires at least some sort of
hypothetic elucidation.
Let me still say some words on psychical "voices" and "lights"
though only in the form of an additional note. If we regard these
voices as genuine and not as performed by the subconscious side of
the medium, we, of course, have to classify them together with
materializations. For they are affections of matter on the medium's
part, and it means but a slight difference in the last resort whether
matter, :

ordered into specific form or into a specific combination
of rhythmical movements.
10. We now approach the discussion of a particular parapsychol-
ogical hypothesis which so far, quite intentionally, has not been taken
into consideration, in order not to burden Psychical Research from
the beginning with a theory which is not its prerequisite by itself,
namely, Spiritualism.
For Spiritualism is not the same as Parapsychology, but is a par-
ticular hypothesis within its realm, in exactly the same way as the
theory of natural selection is a particular hypothesis in the realm of
the general theory of evolution. Spiritualism is, however, a logically
legitimate hypothesis, i.e. a hypothesis which is free from any con-
tradiction in itself.
The hypothesis of Spiritualism may be understood in two various
forms, a general and a more specified one. In its general form Spirit-
ualism merely assumes that there is some mental entity embracing the
remains of formerly living minds after their so-called death, leaving
open the question whether this mental entity is split off into persons
or not, and, if it is, whether these persons correspond to the original
persons one by one. In its more specified and, so to speak, popular
form, spiritualism says that the personal minds qua personal minds
survive death in some unknown form of existence.
It now cannot be denied that there are some facts in Parapsy-
174 HANS DR.IBSCH
questions of distance being quite evidently only questions of the
second order.

It now cannot be denied that there are some facts in Parapsy-
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY 175
chology which are able to make the spiritualistic hypothesis material-
ly, and not merely logically, possible and perhaps even probable to a
certain extent, this hypothesis, at first, being taken in a very general
sense.
11. Let me begin the discussion by enumerating these facts: in the
first place there is the selective character of mind reading, so often ex-
perienced in the phenomena shown by Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Leon-
hard. The medium "reads" something out of this mind and some-
thing out of that, and yet it puts all the results of its reading together
into the characteristics of one personality that is dead at the time of
the sitting. This feature, of course, may be explained on the assump-
tion that the medium is guided in its selection by that personality qua
still existing. It may however be explained also by assuming that the
medium is at first getting a general type of the person in question by
a mind reading in one of the sitters, and that the selective mind read-
ing that follows is under the guidance of the subconscious idea of the
medium, gained in the way described. In this case the guiding per-
sonality would merely have an existence in the medium's mind.
The phenomena which have been called the classics by British
authors belong here, too, and need no mentioning under a particular
heading. For to have spoken Latin or Greek belongs to the char-
acteristics of a personality.
In the second place there are the cross correspondences, though
these also, of course, may be explained by a mind reading among
various mediums at a long distance.
So much for the topics which might be brought forward in favor
of spiritualism and which have already been mentioned in my London
address. But there is still something more, so it seems to me now.
In the third place the book and newspaper tests, so well elaborated
by the British S. P. R. They would belong to clairvoyance and not
to mind reading or telepathy, if they are taken as "animistic" phe-
nomena. But it is hardly imaginable how the medium itself should
be able to discover a passage in any book, unknown to it so far, that
relates to a particular fact with regard to a sitter. A spirit that has
known the book in his life might do it, of course. We do not know
what he "might" do, in any case. But if he exists, it would not seem
to be too much to attribute to him this faculty.
In the fourth place there is a certain fact in favor of spiritualism,
the mention of which may surprise you, and this is the very limited
faculty of all mediums. They know a good deal in an abnormal way,
PSYCHICAL R.BSBAllCH AND PHILOSOPHY 175
chology which are able to make the spiritualistic hypothesis material-
ly, and not merely logically, possible and perhaps even probable to a
certain extent, this hypothesis, at first, being taken in a very general

that is true. But they are by no means omniscient. But does not
this fact stand in direct opposition to spiritualism? so I hear you
saying. I answer: no, not at all. For it is rather hard to under-
stand why the faculty of a psychic person, that once is in possession
of supernormal power, should be as limited as it actually is. Whilst
if we assume a formerly living personality to be the real agent upon,
the scene, we should quite well be able to understand his limitations.
The more so, if we apply to the second, particular form of spiritual-
ism, granting the endurance of the mefntal personality qua personal-
ity beyond the grave. For in this case the "spirit" might be bound
to his former experiences, and these, of course, are very limited, as
they are in each of us. I must confess that this argument seems to me
to be very impressive, in particular if taken together with the first,
selective mind reading. It might, however, be also possible in some
cases to explain the limitation of knowledge on the part of the medium
by the limited experiences of the sitters. But there are instances, in
the book tests for example, in which there is limitation in fields where
mind reading does not seem to come into account.
In the fifth place, we only raise a question: Are there cases in
which a medium gave evidence of facts known to absolutely not one
living person ? I confess that I am not quite convinced of the reality
of such facts though, of course, I do by no means deny it a priorL
But if such cases existed, you might, of course, recur to psychometry,
for there are certainly some objects which have been in connection
with a person who is now dead. This would, however, be a psychom-
etry at distance.
Psychometry itself is now to take the sixth place in our enumera-
tion. We have said on a former occasion that psychometry might per-
haps be understood on the assumption that the psychometric object
has something "on" itself that connects it with a mind and that, in
this way, the object serves to connect two minds with one another
and to allow mind reading on the part of the medium. But, so we
were obliged to add, the psychometric medium very often seems to
read in a mind that does not exist any more. What, then, about
"reading"? On the spiritualistic hypothesis that mind would exist
in the case of Dr. Pagenstecher's experiment for instance. Living
mind or "dead" mind, that would no longer make any difference.
Uniformity in explanation would be reached.
Finally let me but shortly mention all physical phenomena occur-

12. All phenomena mentioned so far would be explained on one
and the same foundation as soon as we would be inclined to accept
spiritualism, and this is the great advantage of this hypothesis. This
advantage, however, is not sufficient, so it seems to me, to accept it in
a definite way. For, on the one hand, other kinds of explanation,
however artificial they may be, are still possible, and, on the other
hand, it has always been regarded as a sound principle of research not
to introduce new entia praeter necessitate, which means to introduce
them only if no other way is left. And the spirit would certainly be
a new ens, even if we endow him only with superhuman and not with
transhuman faculties.
Prophecy, of course, would remain unexplained on the foundation
of such a sort of spiritualism also, unless we are inclined to attribute
to the spirit faculties of an absolutely unknown kind.
Let me once more come back to the two kinds of spiritualism men-
tioned above, one of them very general and indefinite, the other refer-
ring to personal immortality in the popular sense. William James was
inclined to the first form of spiritualism in a certain way: a foreign
personality seemed to be at work in the Piper phenomena, but he
was not sure that this was just the personality of his friend Hodgson.
The Italian parapsychologist McKenzie has advocated a similar view,
assuming that there is a general Supermind into which the individual
minds are lost after death, but out of which new constellations of the
character of a "person" might emerge under certain conditions for
a limited time. The relations between Supermind and personal minds
would then be of the same kind as those between one mind and
various Egos in the case of so-called dissociation.
Oesterreich has justly said that we should never be able to decide
between the two forms of spiritualism, even if we accepted it as a
whole. And yet, so I think, one of the two forms of spiritualism may
perhaps appear to be more probable than the other, when our positive
knowledge will be more advanced than it is today.
So much about the spiritualistic hypothesis. Animistic hypotheses,
of course, are not abolished by it, for it would certainly be very un-
wise to refer to a disincarnate being in the face of every psychip phe-

nomenon. But might it not be that incarnate and disincarnate spirits
are ultimately one class of beings, and that, in this way, all mental
phenomena of Parapsychology might be reading in "some mind" in
the last resort? This, so it seems to me, has been Frederic Myers*

must be very careful not to be too rash. Make hypotheses, as many
as you like, but never forget that they are mere working hypotheses,
destined to be thrown away whenever they do not stand any fact.
The main thing for Psychical Research, in my opinion, is to get
a more direct control with regard to conditions of experiment. The
best thing, of course, would be if we could get mediumship as a
whole into our hands, which means if we could make every human
being a "medium" whenever we like. This is not at all out of the
realm of probabilities. For it is not very probable that the media
are a particular species of human beings. Every man is probably a
potential medium, but we do not yet know the conditions under which
his potencies become actualities. We shall know this one day, so I
hope, and it seems, e. g., as if chemical substances might have the
faculty of provoking mediumship. What we may try now is to have
control of the outer conditions of experiment to any extent we like.
Darkness, e. g., is a great handicap in all physical experiments, for it
always leaves room for scepticism. The medium or the "spirit", if
there is any, tells us that there must be darkness. Well, tell the
medium that you don't believe that, and try the matter at least in a
dim red light. And if this goes well, suggest to the medium, in the
Coueistic fashion, that everything will now go perfectly well in or-
dinary light also. I was told by a member of the British committee
that investigated Eusapia Palladino at Naples that the best results
were got one day at noon in a very good light. This ought to en-
courage us not to become the absolute slaves of the medium or the
"spirit". We must try to make the medium our object, and not be
his. As soon as we shall have reached the new standard of conditions
and controls just mentioned scepticism will become quite impossible.
For it would be ridiculous, as a good deal of it is now.

IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH WORTH WHILE?
BY WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE
No cautious and intelligent person can or should be convinced by
testimony that supernormal phenomena exist except on the basis of a
great many case reports, nor can he take into consideration any case
report which is not full, detailed and critical in the extreme. There-
fore it would be quite hopeless for me to attempt in the limits of one
lecture, to convince anyone by citing cases. I shall occasionally refer
to one by way of illustration, and toward the close I may present
one or two case sketches with the understanding that they are only
"thumb-nail" sketches and that the full reports are available in print.
In the main what I have to say will constitute a study in trends
and reactions. What were the causes which led to the foundation of
Societies for Psychical Research? What has been the effect of in-
spection and study upon the minds of persons apparently well quali-
fied? Why is it that after nearly half a century Psychical Research
Societies are still in existence and even multiplying? Have the
methods of psychical researchers, to outward appearances, been
cautious, logical and painstaking, or otherwise? How far has earnest
and protracted psychical research, deserving of the name, resulted
in making thorough skeptics ? How far have opponents shown them-
selves qualified by experience or by study? On which side, among the
most scientific leaders, is there the greater appearance of dealing with
facts rather than dogmas, with logic rather than appeals to authority?
What are some of the arguments against psychical research, and to
what extent are other branches of scientific inquiry also liable to the
weight of them? Is psychical research becoming more or less form-
idable with the passage of time? Are there sets of facts on which
experienced researchers are practically agreed? If there are sets
upon which they differ greatly, how is this to be explained? Has
psychical research made, aside from the category of the supernormal,
any worthy contributions to knowledge? In the main this paper is,
though I dislike the term, a study in behaviorism as related to 'psy-
chical research.

1. Phenomena of the same nature as those which now form the
subject-matter of psychical research are witnessed to from the first
records of the human race, apparently in all lands. They are in our
Bible and other bibles. They are in ancient Roman histories and
biographies. They are in the writings of the Christian Fathers, and
so on to our day. Many of them are given at second-hand, many
are doubtless distorted and curiously interpreted in the telling, yet the
narratives witness to human belief in actual experiences. Oddly, we
sometimes hear it said as a taunt that such beliefs were common in
ancient times and are common among aborigines, which isj exactly what
we should expect would be the case if the phenomena to A^hich they re-
late, correctly described, are integral to the human r^ee.
2. Such testimonies may be found far more frequently in our own
vaunted period of enlightenment than in any former period, now
that effort is being made to collect them and it is comparatively an
age of recording. They are not confined to the ignorant or the
credulous, but are shared by the greatest intellects. Nor do they
shun the lives of scientifically inclined men, though these tend to dis-
courage them, discount them, and much less frequently to record than
tell them to intimates.
I have noticed that if a small group of intelligent men, not sup-
posed to be impressed by psychical research, get together and such mat-
ters are mentioned, and all feel that they are in safe tnd sane com-
pany, usually about half of them begin to relate exceptions. That
is to say, man after man opens a little residual closet and takes out
some incident which happened to him or to some member of his fam-
ily, or to some friend whom he trusts, and which he thinks odd and
extremely puzzling. I made a remark of this kind once when with
six men of high standing in various professions. No sooner had I
ceased speaking when a physicist whose name is known over the world
told of something which happened to him when a young man how he
heard his father's voice pronouncing his name at the very hour, as it
afterward proved, when his father died, hundreds of miles away.
He ended : "That is something I never could understand." I do
not think the physicist would forgive me if I revealed his name. Then,
to my equal surprise, a very prominent physician, whose name is
familiar to the profession all over the country, told stories of what
seemed like telepathy in his own family. A noted editor and a well-
known lawyer followed suit.

1. Phenomena of the same nature as those which now form the
subject-matter of psychical research are witnessed to from the first
records of the human race, apparently in all lands. They are in our
Bible and other bibles. They are in ancient Roman histories and
biographies. They are in the writings of the Christian Fathers, and
so on to our day. Many of them are given at second-hand, many
are doubtless distorted and curiously interpreted in the telling, yet the
narratives witness to human belief in actual experiences. Oddly, we
sometimes hear it said as a taunt that such beliefs were common in
ancient times and are common among aborigines, which is;exactly what
we should expect would be the case if the phenomena to *hich they re-
late, correctly described, are integral to the human n\fe.

3. There is a large degree of homogeneity in the stories ancient,

mediaeval and modern, subject, however, to at least two disturbances
even when told at first-hand. (1) Superadded interpretation, as
when Luther said that he saw the devil, whereas had he lived in the
20th century he would have said he saw the apparition of a man, the
notion that it was the devil being his interpretative addition. (2)
Modification by the subconsciousness under the influence of the zeit-
geist and the individual composite. As among the waving grass-blades
shimmering in the morning light a pious child would be more likely
to experience the illusion of a winged angel, and an ardent youth
the illusion of a dancing girl, so, admitting that there are veridical
apparitions, they are probably subject to modification by that strange
mechanism, the mind, which at the same time is acted upon and acts
upon itself. Thus, if one saw a vision of his deceased mother gazing
pityingly upon him, a few moments after, as it proved, his far-distant
father died, we might well, on the background of many similar cases,
suspect a supernormal stimulus, but likewise suspect an intermixing
memory stimulus to account for her being dressed in the familiar
garb of years gone by.
Nevertheless, many of the ancient and mediaeval stories strikingly
resemble the recorded and authenticated ones of our own time. Un-
becoming as they may be in an age of science, dreams more complexly
coincident with uninferrible events of the near future than any pro-
phetic dreams in the Bible have been proved to occur in our generation.
Lest some of my hearers should gaspingly turn for relief to Royce's
theory of pseudo-memories, I add that I refer to dreams actually re-
lated to intelligent witnesses before the astoundingly coinciding events
occurred. The raps which I studied in my own home, in my office
and in the office of a New York physician lead back to the startling
thumps which Luther heard in his monastery and in Wartburg
Castle. The Apostle Peter's becoming aware of the messengers
from Cornelius before they were in sight is analogous with the authen-
ticated recent case of the lady who saw while awake a vision of a man
of whom for a long time she had heard nothing, with his face tied
up in a bandage, at the hour when her husband at a distance beheld
with astonishment this man's face so bandaged as he lay in his coffin.
The double incident of Peter and Cornelius is of a type with the re-
cent authentic case of a New Jersey woman of culture who had a
waking vision of her dead father and living foster-brother, which she
immediately told to persons whose testimonies I have, it afterwards
proving that at that hour her brother on a war ship in the North Sea,

periences, strangely coinciding subjective facts, which no so-called
"logic of science" can annihilate.
4. The foregoing considerations determined a group of English
university men 44 years ago to found a society for the investigation
of such alleged incidents. One of the prime movers, Professor Henry
Sidgwick, who has been called the "most incorrigible skeptic in
England," nevertheless agreed that it was the scandal of science that
it had never more than sneered at all this testimony of the ages, that
it made no effort finally to determine whether there is or is not any
fire back of so much smoke. At least it would be worth while as a
study of folk lore and of psychology, and would, if all was found
illusory, have the effect of discouraging an epidemic which, if it be-
gins in the slums of human mentality, frequently enters the palaces
thereof.
5. Forty-four years have passed since the Society for Psychical
Research was founded. Several other worthy organizations have in
the meantime arisen to engage in the same inquiry, not to give heed
to less respectable ones. Some of the most eminent scientists on earth
have taken part, some of the most brilliant intellects, some most
familiar not only with pathological mentality, but also with the oc-
casional queer mechanisms of the normal mind, not omitting some
expertly conversant with the methodology of fraud in this field. If,
after all, comparatively few with such varieties and combinations of
equipment lent themselves to the work, it really seems as if there
were enough and the time elapsed enough to have already proved to ap-
proximate certainty that only superstition and credulity, illusion and
delusion, infantilism and mental aberration underlie these million
stories, if such indeed is the case. But the 44 years have not had this
result. If I could go no farther, this would be a striking announce-
ment. After thousands of years science at last turned its critical eye
upon the matter, men of learning, intellectuality, logic and familiarity
with critical procedure took hold, some of them with the full ex-
pectation of showing that the whole class of beliefs was without
rational foundation, and they have not succeeded.

IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH WORTH WHILE 183
eminent scientists, men of brilliant intellects, adepts in logic and
critical procedure, trained detectives in the jungle of human illusion
and delusion, have actually become convinced on the evidence, that
more or less types of supernormal claims are valid. It would ap-
pear that, if it was worth while in 1882 to begin an organized at-
tempt to study the phenomena alleged, there is now ten times the
motive to continue that study.
7. Let us not lose sight of the significance of the fact that many
of these convinced men started their quest as materialists, and that
the training and prepossessions of the scientific fraternity were ad-
verse to the claims under consideration. And yet as honest analyzers
and reporters of the facts they have declared their conviction that
certain species of hitherto discredited claims are justified.
To cite one example, if any man was fitted by mental constitution
and by equipment to build a road clear across the bog, assuming that
the whole region of psychical research is a bog, Dr. Richard Hodgson,
the academic product of two great universities, lecturer in one of
them, seemed to be the man. Of keen and logical intellect, author
of historic exposures of fraud, co-author of the finest demonstration
of the possibilities of mal-observation and memory aberration in ex-
istence, unusually versed in the methodology of fraud and deception,
he was regarded as the arch skeptic, and his appointment to the head
of Psychical Research in this country was hailed by its opponents
with approval. After years of study, particularly with Mrs. Piper,
he became convinced that several types of mental supernormal claims
were valid, and that certain phenomena were best explained by the
spiritistic hypothesis. Therefore it is now dogmatically asserted that
he was all the while dominated by the "will to believe," although
for years manifesting the very opposite symptoms.
8. As intimated, the favorite jeer of scientific opponents is that
such men as Lodge, Barrett, Crookes, Myers, Hodgson and Hyslop,
were victims of a "will to believe." If uttered in good faith this
cry is simply a tabloid of desperate superstition, superstition because
it is a belief irrationally grounded and desperate because beyond it is
the deep sea of utter inability to explain the conviction of those quali-
fied men who have most laboriously and protractedly studied the
phenomena, without admitting that they probably obtained some re-
spectable evidence. Of course no man is absolutely without bias,

allows the scales of his thinking on the subject to be weighted by a
will to disbelieve. But prior to his study of the evidence the man with
the hypothetical will to believe may have seemed to keep it in good
subjection. If he secretly longed to live after bodily death, in some
cases he neither went to church nor read nor conversed much on
religion. It really looks as though, with most men, actual present
advantages rather than those of a hypothetical future world are more
influential. We don't know what inner craving for continuance a
given psychical researcher may have had (for aught I know, most
scientific men, pro and conf if their lids could be taken off, would re-
veal at least a vestige of such an instinctive craving, and if so the fact
would be to a degree evidential) but we do know, and he knew, that
his reputation for sanity and judgment, that his scientific standing,
that his very job, would be less secure if he announced that a claim
to the supernormal was established. It is certain that such motives
to create a "will to disbelieve would press upon him as they do on
those who announce themselves as opposed, while the slogan that a
Lodge or a Hodgson is actuated by a will to believe is purely a dogma,
as fully as that of the philosopher's stone. But, equally enamored of
this comforting dogma and of the Freudian technique, an eminent
gentleman undertook to reconstruct the biography of a living man,
encouraged by lack of response from dead worthies subjected to a
similar process. Sir Oliver Lodge, said he, is convinced of survival
because he is getting to be an old man who doesn't wish to lapse from
being, and because he wants to see again his son who was killed in the
Great War. How evident that, instead of yielding to the logic of ob-
served facts, Sir Oliver gravitated toward the fulfilment of his wishes !
Only Sir Oliver was not an old man when he arrived at his con-
victions, long before the war, and his son was yet a boy. But why
should facts be allowed to spoil a fine theory?

has told us, there comes a point in a man's investigation of an ob-
scure phenomenon when he legitimately employs his "scientific imag-
ination" to picture a cause or concurrence of causes which would
satisfactorily explain the phenomenon. From the time that he has

it may prove to be the true one. That must have been the case with
Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Faraday, Darwin and all the rest. Who
cares for that? The only question is what evidence did they pro-
duce and what was their argument founded thereon?
10. A man reaches his convictions in any one of three ways. (1)
In the main by the intellectual route, through study and reasoning,
or (2) partly by this route but also partly through his emotions, his
prejudices and likings, or (3) mainly through these emotional by-
ways. Whatever class he belongs to can be pretty well gauged by
the way he writes or talks. It is certain that many advocates of
supernormal phenomena and theories belong to the last class. Their
reports of cases are full of leaks, their inductions are hasty and
fragile, they rush to defend cases of another continent against the
judgment of the actual and competent observers, their language is
heated and hortatory, they display a degree of zeal becoming to an
apostle but not to an investigator of facts. There are also the half-
way class, those who have had and set forth some evidence, but mix
with it so much indiscrimination, incaution and intemperate zeal as
also to make them ineffectual except with the unthinking and as marks
for their adversaries. Mesmer in his time announced a new and very
important fact to the world, but in his ignorant zeal invested it with
so much extravagent nonsense as to delay its scientific reception for
half a century. Nevertheless it was the reproach of science that it
turned away in disgust and did not go directly to the dust-heap and
lay hold of the valuable thing therein hidden, as a similar course is
a reproach to it today.
But there have been and are persons whose works show them to
have been careful, intelligent and patient observers, experimenters,
analyzers and synthesizers of evidence. Fully as much as Darwin or
Huxley or Tyndall or Spencer, do such leaders minutely collect,
examine, weigh and classify their facts. They are fully as conserv-
ative, paving their way as they go, their language is as temperate and
they as seldom give vent to exclamations of impatience at the im-
pudent and vacuous volubility of their critics. They set forth the
facts and the conditions in detail, they dodge no difficulties, and calm-
ly discuss the various possible theories to account for the facts. They
have built up a precautionary methodology from which many a psy-
chological laboratory, as Professor Schiller has shown,

hints to make its inferential errors less frequent. Hence the spectacle
of such men, standing up before a taunting scholastic majority and
calmly announcing that they have reached, severally, one or another
stage of conviction that supernormal facts actually exist, is a pro-
foundly impressive one.
11. Now let us apply the same test, analysis of modes of discus-
sion, to the physical scientists, psychologists, physicians and others
who have written books and articles attacking the whole domain of
Psychical Research, including telepathy. I make a statement which
will seem incredible, but which defies confutation. Every one of
them, by the application of the test is shown to belong, when he en-
ters the field of Psychical Research with general, hostile intent? to the
third class, that composed of persons whose conclusions are actuated
mainly by their emotions, by manifest bias and prejudice, rather than
by calm reasoning on the basis of careful study; persons who react
irrationally to particular subjects which for some reason are obnoxious
to them^ and evidence the fact by generalities, a priori assumptions,
refusal to face squarely and discuss calmly main issues, attacks on men
of straw, weird logic which they would deride were it employed in
their own special field, indulgence in wild and unsupported hypotheses
in regard to the intellects of all their opponents, exhibitions of ignor-
ance of their subject matter by frequent blunders of fact, exclamations
of disgust and sundry marks of emotionalism. So emphatically is this
true that I wrote for a London magazine
3
an article exhibiting these
"The reader is asked to take account of every word in this italicised pass-
age. I do not accuse scientific men in general of being emotional or unfair,
nor the particular men referred to of being so characterized in other fields
than that of psychical research, nor even men who have written against the
spiritistic theory, endeavoring to account for the facts by telepathy. Nor is
my statement based upon conjecture. It is an induction drawn from actual
survey of the books and articles which indiscriminately attack all alleged
supernormal facts and theories. Most scientific men lack both interest and
time to pay attention to psychical phenomena, and write little or nothing re-
lating thereto. Such as do have the interest and time to study the facts tend
to become impressed by them, and either to express to one or another degree
their interest, or at least to refrain from disparagement. But a comparatively
small number, to whom psychical research is as the traditional red rag to the
bull, turn their attention to it mainly to collect material for polemical pur-
poses, and betray the insufficiency of their acquaintance and their departure
from the scientific spirit by the characteristics of their writing. It is solely

hints to make its inferential errors less frequent. Hence the spectacle
of such men, standing up before a taunting scholastic majority and
calmly announcing that they have reached, severally, one or another
stage of conviction that supernormal facts actually exist, is a pro-
foundly impressive one.
11. Now let us apply the same test, analysis of modes of discus-
sion, to the physical scientists, psychologists, physicians and others
who have written books and articles attacking the whole domain of
Psychical Research, including telepathy. I make a statement which
will seem incredible, but which defies confutation. Every one of
them, by the application of the test is shown to belong, when he en-
ters the field of Psychical Research with general, hostile intent,2 to the
third class, that composed of persons whose conclusions are actuated
mainly by their emotions, by manifest bias and prejudice, rather than
by calm reasoning on the basis of careful study; persons who react
irrationally to particular subjects which for some reason are obnoxious
to them, and evidence the fact by generalities, a priori assumptions,
refusal to face squarely and discuss calmly main issues, attacks on men
of straw, weird logic which they would deride were it employed in
their own special field, indulgence in wild and unsupported hypotheses
in regard to the intellects of all their opponents, exhibitions of ignor-
ance of their subject matter by frequent blunders of fact, exclamations
of disgust and sundry marks of emotionalism. So emphatically is this
true that I wrote for a London magazine3 an article exhibiting these
"The reader is asked to take account of every word in this italicised pass-
age. I do not accuse scientific men in general of being emotional or unfair,
nor the particular men referred to of being so characterized in other fields
than that of psychical research, nor even men who have written against the
spiritistic theory, endeavoring to account for the facts by telepathy. Nor is
my statement based upon conjecture. It is an induction drawn from actual
survey of the books and articles which indiscriminately attack all alleged
supernormal facts and theories. Most scientific men lack both interest and
time to pay attention to psychical phenomena, and write little or nothing re-
lating thereto. Such as do have the interest and time to study the facts tend
to become impressed by them, and either to express to one or another degree
their interest, or at least to refrain from disparagement. But a comparatively
small number, to whom psychical research is as the traditional red rag to the
bull, turn their attention to it mainly to collect material for polemical pur-
poses, and betray the insufficiency of their acquaintance and their departure
from the scientific spirit by the characteristics of their writing. It is solely
the last class to which I refer in the text.

title "The Enchanted Boundary." I am fairly familiar with the
literature on this subject of the last 45 years, and have been searching
in vain for a case where a hostile spear, however effective outside, did
not turn to a reed when it crossed the border of this region of inquiry,
and where this cannot easily be shown. No rejoinder came from one
of my fifteen subjects of demonstration, because the facts were ir-
refutable when once pointed out. One could recite instances for
hours; how opposers of psychical research pick out for attack in-
cidents which the original reporters for honesty's sake did not omit
but expressly stated were not evidential, while carefully avoiding the
real evidence; how they mutilate and do malpractice on records they
profess to summarize; how they ludicrously misconceive and misstate
the problems and opinions of those whom they criticise ; how in juve-
nile awe of scientific assumptions which are continually altering and
enlarging they undertake to demolish facts by dogmatic pronuncia-
mentos ; how they boast of their unwillingness to get first hand knowl-
edge by patient experiment, and betray their lack of acquaintance
with the works of those who have done so by childish blunders of fact
(I counted six in one short paragraph) ; how they sweep away hosts
of authenticated actual cases by one oracular dictum as intelligent as
that of the farmer who when he saw a giraffe said "There ain't no
such animal;" how they betray emotional repulsion as in the case of
the psychologist of whom Dr. Hyslop said that if he was so actuated
he ought to join the Salvation Army.
Even Huxley lapsed from his logical rectitude when he said that
the only good of a demonstration of "Spiritualism" was to furnish an
argument against suicide. If he had heard some one in or out of
Texas say that the only good of a demonstration that men are bio-
logically related to apes is to furnish an argument for suicide, I can
imagine his acid retort that facts do not pay heed to emotional re-
pulsions. I myself have a decided prejudice against biting and sting-
ing insects, and my feelings declare that my world shall not contain
them, but now and then in my travels I am painfully reminded that
it nevertheless does. Suppose it proved that all subconscious twaddle
of a medium comes from Heaven and that the indications are that we
all become idiotic when we reach that region, still facts would be
facts, whether blissful or otherwise.

agony to terminate the testing process and write a report ; intolerably
detailed in reporting and in presenting the subject in hand at every
possible angle ; alive by experience and study to the various pitfalls of

vestigation was scientifically defective, that the reasoning from it
was not sound. No one has done so, though one professor of psy-
chology, at once my friend and my forensic opponent, is notably vol-
uble on the subject. Several declared that they could do it. One
promised that he would do it and was furnished with all the materials
which after four years he has yet. I predict that on his death bed he
will murmur: "I could have done it if I only had had time."
By the way, I think that my friend, the voluble professor of psy-
chology, may have the Saul of Tarsus complex. You remember that
Saul, knowing nothing in particular against the Christians, imagined
that they were a bad lot, and having no official functions which re-
quired him to persecute them, went out of his way to obtain an of-
ficial license to do so. We know he had listened to Stephen at the
time of that martyr's execution, and it well may be that he became
half convinced that the Christians were right. He verily thought, as
he tells us, that he was doing God service by harrying them, and yet
all the time it was probably a subconsciously initiated psychological
defense against his own heretical tendencies. There is nothing in my
friend the Professor's official functions which calls upon him to tour
the country and enrich the magazines with his attacks upon psychical
research, within which his revelations of knowledge are not very pro-
found. Have certain facts like winged arrows pierced the joints of
his armor, and is he, actuated by the Saul of Tarsus complex, fight-
ing for the preservation of his own academic orthodoxy? It is an in-
teresting psychological question.
13. Even rational men, unable to cope with facts against which
they have an emotional complex, frequently react irrationally, set up
an illusory dogma and cling to it as a pillar of safety. So we hear
that psychic or supernormal facts are "impossible" by the "logic of
science," are contrary to the laws of nature, and destructive to the
principles of the universe. Psychologists, much more than physicists
and biologists, are apt to cherish the delusion that science has reached
the point where it can perfectly delimit between the possible and the
impossible, that its principles and final concepts have been perfectly
and fully ascertained. Science has been in our own time a changing
panorama, continually enlarging the circle to introduce facts former-
ly regarded impossible, tearing down old and erecting new theories
and altering some of its very foundation principles. fWas it not Lord

humbug. Edison's electric light was declared by several scientists,
when the newspapers first reported it, impossible. The phonograph
was impossible. The flight of heavy air machines was impossible.
So the catalogue could be extended indefinitely. Hence Von Helm-
holz's dictum to Sir William Barrett was not quite final, great a
scientist as he was : "Neither the testimony of all the Fellows of the
Royal Society, nor even the evidence of my own senses, could lead me
to believe in the transmission of thought from one person to another
independently of the recognized channels of sensation. It is clearly
impossible." As "impossible" is a word which admits of no com-
parative degree it follows that since some "impossible" things have
nevertheless been found true, others probably will be. And thus far
the universe has not suffered from the establishment of "impossible"
facts.
But, more than this, the formulas, the theories, some of the very
so-called laws relating to the origin and constitution of, and relations
existing between material things have changed. As Will Durant has

thesis flown ? . . . Where are the laws of the great Newton now, when
Einstein and Moskowski and other disreputable foreigners have up-
set the universe with their unintelligible relativity? Where is the
indestructibility of matter and the conservation of energy in the
chaos and dispute of contemporary physics . . . Where is Gregor Men-
del now that 'unit characters' are in bad odor with geneticists ?" And
again, such queries could be extended. Nor do they breathe contempt
for science, whose noble building grows in solidity and grandeur,
albeit it undergoes many alterations, some of them so radical as to
change its appearance and parts of its very structure. It is only when
a scientist becomes a philosopher, and adopts the philosophical theory
of mono-materialism, that psychic facts seem impossible in the scheme
of things. Let these facts reach to the indisputable stage and the
scientists' philosophy of the universe will alter to include them, and
they will composedly smile at the perturbations of their predecessors.
14. But is it not a fact that the field of Psychic Research extends
back through centuries of gross and silly superstitions? Superstitions
are often wrong interpretations of facts. But there certainly is very
much of superstition in the sense of irrational and unfounded occult
beliefs and practices perceptible in our glimpses of ancient times, and

refuted, but biology remains a science. The geologist Beringer was

If such a demand had been enforced by the thinking world upon
other sciences, there would be little science today. Look at the past
history of every science and see the record of conflicts of opinion, and
the skeletons of perished theories which line the road. Does chemistry
still explain combustion on the theory of phlogiston? Does catastro-
phism play the part in geology that it once did ? Review the long war
of theories in medical science, and glance at the grotesque therapies
which still appeal to public credulity. Psychical Research is almost
the youngest branch of scientific exploration, and of course there
are differing theories. This is the very sign that it is alive and that
opposing schools agree on a large basis of facts, although not yet on
all classes of alleged facts.
It is not a century since psychology was nothing more than a theo-
retical discussion of the three formal categories of the "soul", in-
tellect, sensibility and will. It is not fifty years since William James
said that he did not see that it had any practical use. It has enor-
mously developed, various methods hitherto undreamed of have been
applied to its investigation, and it is of use in various ways for vari-
ous practical ends. But is there unity of theory ;
do all psychologists

mously developed, various methods hitherto undreamed of have been
applied to its investigation, and it is of use in various ways for vari-
ous practical ends. But is there unity of theory; do all psychologists
agree in interpretation? I need only to mention the psychology of

James, or of McDougall on the one side and of that obstreperous
young scoffer Behaviorism on the other, or Freudism and Anti-Freud-
ism. Wundt at one period held that psychology is merely a branch
of physiology, and later reversed his position, lamenting the wild
oats of his youth, but he remained a pioneer of psychological method.
No general test should be applied to Psychical Research, in order to
ascertain its validity, which would not be regarded as equally sig-

17, But was not Podmore a keen and indefatigable psychical re-
searcher, and did he not combat the spiritistic theory? Only pausing
to remark that there is much in psychical research besides spiritism,
I answer that he did, but did so by urging, with extreme ingenuity
and multiplied minor assumptions, the claims of telepathy. That is,
he combated one theory of supernormal character by another. It must
not be forgotten that telepathy if it exists is a supernormal fact, that
is, it is not within the present "logic" of the science most commonly
accepted, it means that thought passes from one person to another by
some process unknown and other than the recognized channels of the
senses. The opponent of the authenticated facts of mediumship is
between the devil and the deep sea, either he must resort to telepathy,
usually abhorrent because fatal to his materialistic philosophy, or he
must pretend that the evidence does not exist, and, covering his eyes,
"thob" for the safety of his hypothetical soul formulas and shibboleths
about the "logic" and the "laws" of science, "animistic tendencies"
and the "will to believe." Dr. George M. Beard was frank when
he wrote that to face the evidence appeared to be so deadly that "for
logical, well-trained, truth-loving minds, the only security against
spiritism is hiding or running away." Incredible as it may seem,
these are the actual words printed by an opponent of psychical re-
search.
18. Do psychical researchers all agree that any types of phe-
nomena are supernormal? If I may be allowed to define a psychical
researcher as a person of evident intelligence and cultivation, whose
writings reveal acquaintance with and employment of critical method,
who has had much experience in this field, and who is interested in
the fixation of facts and not in propaganda, religious or other, I
answer in the affirmative, and will name four types upon which I
think that there is practically unanimous agreement, nor is the list
necessarily exhaustive.

(1) Telepathy is generally agreed to by psychical researchers, on
194 WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE
the basis of numerous experimental series, and on spontaneous cases
of extraordinary character. One instance of the latter class is the
fact that the naturalist John Muir, not having seen his friend Profes-
sor Butler for years, nor having heard from him for a month, in a
letter which contained no hint that he thought of going to California,
was impressed, while high up on a plateau of the Yosemite Valley,
by the feeling that he must go down and find his friend, descended
thousands of feet and found Butler lost and about to be benighted
among the rocks. The facts were testified to by both gentlemen.
Several incidents almost as remarkable occurred in my relations with
a single person.
(2) Veridical (truth-telling) Apparitions. The English Society
gathered a large list of cases, from which it eliminated all but the
most thoroughly authenticated, then applied the mathematical method
with the result that some of the most critical minds in England were
convinced that a relation, other than chance, exists between the see-
ing of such apparitions and the deaths of the persons whom they rep-
resent. I think there is practical agreement that not only apparitions
but other sensory hallucinations too frequently coincide in time and
in relevancy to emotional events happening at a distance, to be with-
out any causal nexus.
(3) Mediumistic deliverances. There is agreement that experi-
ments by stranger sitters under scientific management, with more
precautions than opponents have ever thought to suggest, and with
absolutely complete record of every word by anyone in the room,
have produced series of facts pertinent to sitters, and proveably un-
known to the medium, far, sometimes millions of times, beyond the
probabilities of chance. Such instances can be exhibited convincingly
only in their totality, but I may mention one detached incident. Just
following a purported communication from my wife, the medium
automatically wrote that I had had a cat with a long, queer name,
a name with historical associations, a name from the Greek. Only
midway of this description did there come to my memory the name
of the last cat I had owned, thirty years ago. Afterwards, without
one word of assistance from me, a"s the stenographic record shows,
she correctly gave the name Mephistopheles. Chance? But as a
part of this same incident another name was written, and that was
the name of the last and only dog I had ever owned aside from one
now in the family. Still chance? Probably no person in the world,
before my wife's recent death, but she and myself, would remember

now in the family. Still chance? Probably no person in the world,
before my wife's recent death, but she and myself, would remember
IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH WORTH WHILE 195
that odd name for a cat, certainly none within 250 miles. No living
person but myself and my daughter knew the dog's name, or if con-
ceivable that one person remembers the creature that died ten years
ago, after we had owned it a week, that person lives three thousand
miles away in the opposite direction from the long-ago abode of
the cat.
(4) Psychometry. This is the unfortunate name of the phe-
nomenon, confined to an exceedingly small number of persons, of
being able to recite during contact with a strange object a series of
facts true of a person connected with the object, facts not inferrible
from the object itself. I discovered one remarkable psychic of this
kind, a person in private life who had never been so experimented
upon. The results were immediate and astounding, case after case,
and they have been reported in detail, without other response than a
few oracular remarks about "the logic of science," "impossibility"
and my "will to believe." She got impressive results in about half
out of a dozen tests made before she joined a church which stopped
experimentation, and the evidential weight of one of the successes
was so enormous that a hundred following failures would have af-
fected it very little. These were the conditions: broad daylight, a
letter (for example) folded so that no writing appeared without, and
held immoveably between the palms, every word uttered by the psy-
chic and myself taken down, the letter itself taken from an old file
without my glancing at it, though I knew who wrote it. And these
were the results: thirty-seven statements belonging to three classes
in order, (1) description of physical appearance and other character-
istics of a man, (2) references to a journey and to two cities, one by
name and one by its peculiar description, (3) a minute description
of a church and its surroundings. The author of the letter was
a clergyman in a city hundreds of miles from the psychic. Three
of the statements impossible to verify or deny were set aside. One
of the remaining 34 was only partly correct, and all the rest were
literally correct regarding the writer, a journey he had made just
before writing the letter, and the church of which he was pastor.
One of the leading mathematicians in the country, Alan S. Hawkes-
worth, F. R. S. A., inclined somewhat to disfavor psychical research,
passed upon the chance likelihood of each of the 34 items. I did the
same and my estimate proved to be more conservative than his. On
the basis of mine, therefore, he calculated the likelihood of obtaining
all the 34 ascertained items by mere guess. He found it to be about

1 in 5,000,000,000,000,000. Do you imagine that the psychic read
the letter in spite of my vigilance? Very little that she stated would
have been revealed even could she have done so.
I have not time to mention other agreements among psychical re-
searchers, or Vo go to the other end of the spectrum and detail the
alleged phenomena, such as "spirit slate-writing" which nearly all
psychical researchers as I have defined them regard as always spurious,
and "spirit photographs" which all cautious investigators regard
as dubious.
In general I may say that the greater certainty and unanimity has
been attained in the field of mental than that of physical phenomena,
unless we except certain supernormal sounds, especially raps, some
of which at least appear to be physically initiated. In other words,
the simpler and more open the conditions, the more it is a matter
of experienced common-sense and logic, the more certitude. Some
apparently very cautious observers have been convinced of movements
of objects without contact, but probably no one can be quite con-
vinced short of opportunities for personal observation. Many scien-
tific men on the continent of Europe, some of whom had no previous
predelictions in favor of such things, have been convinced of ecto-
plasm. I have never seen any exhibition, or heard any careful de-
scription, of it on this side of the water, which was in the least con-
vincing to me, nor did Drs. Hodgson and Hyslop ever discover any
impressive samples. Whether there is a genuine product of that name
peculiar to the other side of the water or, lacking the long experience
in fakery we have had here, European scientists have been deceived
under conditions favorable to deception, I will not undertake to de-
cide.
19. Amateur acceptance and non-acceptance in this field is often
delightfully naive. There is only one thing that we can predict in
the case of the "hard-headed business man," and that is that he will
never read through one of our elaborate reports, nor listen to reason
on the subject. What impresses students will probably make no dent
on him, but he may say "Here was something that was certainly
genuine," and relate the wonders of a platform code-"telepathist" or
of "billet-switching" conjuror. And I, who was a clergyman, may
be permitted to say that what clergymen will do only God can pre-
dict, for some of them, after remaining prudent in the face of masses
of scientific evidence, fall easy victims to ingenious fakery protected
by darkness. One of the most learned clergymen that Boston ever

boasted, who during successive seasons discussed science in his Monday
lectures, in an hour of weakness was beguiled by a slate-writing con-
juror, and wrote a statement witnessing to the passage of matter
through matter.
Since the last sentence was written, I learn that two colleges and
a theological seminary, none of which, in all probability, ever invited
a Hodgson or a Hyslop to speak, are about to open their doors for
the glorification by one of its principles, of a case, which has been con-
demned by three official and accepted commissions which have re-
ported on it, and found highly suspicious by the fourth. My lords
and ladies, it is a singular world.
On the other hand, acceptance of the usual "explanation" exhibited
in public is about equally naive. I have seen a moving picture demon-
strate the methods of fraudulent mediums, which amused me more
than a comedy, for, while there are fraudulent mediums enough,
probably none of them ever used the means shown since the world
began. I have seen at least two magicians demonstrate how things
are done, and both of them were mainly faking the fakers. One of
them, the most illustrious of all, whom I numbered among my friends,
told me publicly that magicians can make raps like those I studied
in my house. I responded, "No doubt you could rig up a 'gimick'
to produce the raps in my house, but give me the same liberty of ex-
amination that I exercised for months, and I will discover it within
two hours, if not five minutes. If you think otherwise, I invite you
to come over and try it out." He didn't come. I likewise invite any
magician living to fake psychometry by guess and shrewd inference
and in one of fifty trials give me, with all his boasted arts, a result
comparable with those published by me, and achieved by a simple
unprofessional woman.

ascertain if it is worth while. Here I can do no better than to borrow
from the remarks of Mr. H. Addington Bruce.5

years, 'Margery,' the wife of Dr. L. R. G. Crandon, a Boston sur-

The establishment of these claims would
have profound interest for science, since they imply the exercise of en-
ergy in a manner at present unknown to physics, and modifications of
the human body revolutionary of present physiology. If it be a fact
that the vocal and whispered utterances and the whistling sounds
which are so frequent an accompaniment are 'independent/ that is, not
produced by the vocal organs of any living person, and yet requiring
the presence of a peculiarly-constituted person, the fact has deep sig-
nificance for physics, psychology, and physiology. Also the appearance
of live pigeons and flowers, either by special creation or by passage
through matter, if factually established, would considerably enlarge

In May, 1923,1 there blazed out the most brilliant star in the fir-
mament of alleged physical mediumship that America has seen in fifty
years, 'Margery,' the wife of Dr. L. R. G. Crandon, a Boston sur-
geon. At hundreds of sittings,2 it is claimed, 'ectoplasmic' limbs--ex-
truded from her body and afterward reabsorbed-have performed
various acts, such as touching persons seated nearby in the darkness,
shoving, lifting and throwing objects, overturning a small table, ring-
ing the bell in a box activated by a contact cover, producing phos-
phorescent lights, etc.8 The establishment of these claims would
have profound interest for science, since they imply the exercise of en-
ergy in a manner at present unknown to physics, and modifications of
the human body revolutionary of present physiology. If it be a fact
that the vocal and whispered utterances and the whistling sounds
which are so frequent an accompaniment are 'independent,' that is, not
produced by the vocal organs of any living person, and yet requiring
the presence of a peculiarly-constituted person, the fact has deep sig-
nificance for physics, psychology, and physiology. Also the appearance
of live pigeons and flowers, either by special creation or by passage
through matter, if factually established, would considerably enlarge

A REVIEW OF THE MARGERY CASE 201
It is time that an outline history and critique of the case should be
written. This I am attempting on the sole basis of a great mass of
printed and manuscript documents. I abstain from mentioning any
of the unpublished observations of the phenomena by myself, not
acting as a witness or an attorney, but strictly as a reviewer.
I. The First 'Year of the Phenomena. About two-fifths of the
518 pages comprising M.M. are devoted to the 133 sittings from
May 1923 to April 1924, the materials having been furnished by Dr.
Crandon.13
But as the author tells us that "no record was made of
the arrangement of the sitters or the degree of control" at the first 63
sittings, and that such vital information only "sometimes appears in-
cidentally or otherwise" in connection with the 70 which followed,
14
this part of the compilation can hardly impress the scientific reader,
however convincing sittings may have been to persons present. Hope
quite abandons such a reader when he finds the records mostly chopped
into bits, classified and reassembled for dramatic effect under such
titles as "The Gobble-Uns'li Git You Ef You Don't Watch Out,"
and "Ghostly Fingers in the Dark."15
The anecdotes are liberally
sprinkled with the compiler's subtle and somewhat oracular remarks.
II. The Scientific American Investigation. The Committee formed
by the Scientific American to study cases brought to its attention con-
sisted of Dr. Wm. McDougall, Harvard psychologist, then president
of the American Society for Psychical Research ;
Dr. D. F. Comstock,
formerly professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in-
terested in psychical research; Mr. H. Carrington, author of books
dealing with psychical research ;
Dr. W. F. Prince, then research of-
ficer of the A.S.P.R. ; and Mr. H. Houdini, magician. Mr. Bird be-
came, not by action of the committee, secretary to the committee and,
as he says, "stage manager."
16
In the latter capacity he was chiefly
responsible for procedure, the strict function of committee members
being to act as judges. That bane of scientific research premature
publicity was precipitated in spite of protests from the committee.
Never was an investigation more hampered, both at this and subse-
quent stages, by prohibitions and arbitrary rules.
( 1 ) An investigator ought to be able to see, at least in some kind
of light. But the darkness was relieved by red light, more or less,
only when 'Walter' gave the signal,
17
reminding one of the magician
who withdraws the curtain after a wonder is prepared behind it.
Darkness may be required by a 'psychic law/ but it is also convenient
for hoaxing.

portant instruments of investigation, the hands. But hands were
held fast except momentarily under strict regulations. The 'ecto-
plasmic limb* may shove, lift and throw objects, slap sitters and pull
their hair, and even overturn the table or rip away the wing of the
cabinet, but the slightest touch laid upon it unbidden, it is explained,

investigators obeyed the inscrutable law.

alleged laws are actually valid. An investigator on one occasion ven-

between her and the bell-box, and no objection being made continued
to do so.

founded on the theory of 'psychic rods' seemed disproved, yet after-ex-

not from beneath the medium's skirts five inches distant, the important

(g) The husband of the medium must be one of her controllers.
Exceedingly few of hundreds of sittings were exempt from this con-
dition.
83
Such a situation is scientifically suspect and in view of the
fact admitted in detail even by Bird, that Dr. Crandon's testimony
as to continuity of control is unreliable,
34
it greatly increased the
difficulty of ascertaining what took place in the darkness.
The restrictions set forth in the above Sections 1 to 4 inclusive
show why the majority of the first commission were not able abso-
lutely to determine that no supernormal phenomena were displayed.
In the nature of things the restrictions prevented the absolute deter-
mination of fraud if fraud existed unless the rules were violated or
revealing accidents occurred.
It was by springing the many-toothed legalistic trap shown in Sec-
tion 5, that an unreflecting or emotional share of the public have been

Exceedingly few of hundreds of sittings were exempt from this con-
dition.88 Such a situation is scientifically suspect and in view of the
fact admitted in detail even by Bird, that Dr. Crandon's testimony
as to continuity of control is unreliable,34 it greatly increased the
difficulty of ascertaining what took place in the darkness.
The restrictions set forth in the above Sections 1 to 4 inclusive
show why the majority of the first commission were not able abso-
lutely to determine that no supernormal phenomena were displayed.
In the nature of things the restrictions prevented the absolute deter-
mination of fraud if fraud existed unless the rules were violated or
revealing accidents occurred.
It was by springing the many-toothed legalistic trap shown in Sec-
tion 5, that an unreflecting or emotional share of the public have been
persuaded that the first commission (as well as the two subsequent

57. "Houdini and Prince preferred to stop at a hotel." This prefer-
ence was perhaps on the ground that it would be embarrassing to
render a verdict against persons on whose bounty they had been liv-
ing, and more embarrassing in the event of a favorable verdict to
incur the imputation, if not the actual risk, that friendship and
knightliness might affect their judgment.
The verdicts of the Scientific American Committeemen were as
follows, in brief:37
Dr. Comstock: "Rigid proof has not yet been furnished."
Dr. McDougall: "As long ago as November, 1923, ... I was
inclined to regard all the phenomena I had observed as produced by
normal means. . . . Since that date ... the inclination described
above has grown steadily stronger in the main, in spite of some minor
fluctuations, and has now become well-nigh irresistible."
Dr. Prince: "No sitting at which I was present was to me con-
vincing. ... In fact, I could write a chapter of indications which,
in the absence of contravening proof, seem to tell the story of normal
and deceptive production."
Mr. Houdini: "Everything which took place at the seances which
I attended was a deliberate and conscious fraud."
Mr. Carrington: "Many of the observed manifestations might
well have been produced fraudulently and possibly were so pro-
duced. . . . But I am convinced that genuine phenomena have oc-
curred here.'*
Mr. Bird, likewise convinced, and since the most voluble defender,
was not a member of the committee.38
He was, however, one of
the two editors who had "worked out a plan," namely the formation
of the Committee, to furnish "material which would have to be
accepted as authoritative." These are his words.39
III. Mr. Dingwall's Investigation. Dr. Crandon arranged with
Mr. Dingwall, Research Officer of the Society for Psychical Re-
search, to come from London as a sort of appellate court. The great
feature of this series, Dec., 1924, to Feb., 1925, was the production
of "ectoplasm," sometimes like an ill-formed, cold hand feeling like
"blanc-mange," and lying on the table or in the medium's lap, some-
times a curious substance seen either issued from or poked into her
ear. The substance was never seen in the process of actual material-
ization. Unfortunately, Dingwall's hopes that the missing links of
authentication would be supplied were disappointed, for in his report
he says:

faultless if we accept Dr. F. H. [Dr. Crandon] as a bona fide inves-

ing (M.M., 438.). That was April 28, 1924 (M.M., 488ff.). Yet in S.A. of
Aug., 1924, writing after he had been present at 22 more sittings, he had said:

has been altered, and "Dr. Crandon" or "Crandon" changed more
than a hundred times to "F. H." excusable alterations but for the
denial of any changes. There are other alterations, unimportant, but
yet alterations.
(2) Additions. A paragraph of 108 words on page 82, declaring
that in "our minds" is "no doubt that this mediumship is one of the
most important ever recorded," masquerades as part of the sitting-
notes.
(3) Subtractions. Two recorded vulgarisms of 'Walter* are
missing from page 40, and a passage of 49 words, containing an es-
pecially offensive utterance, has been expunged from page 42. All
"damns," references to the Deity and Hades are carefully omitted from

notes of crucial importance. Although various addenda of the earlier

that a luminous band could be removed and replaced without
detection, and while off still appear in the darkness to be on un-

flagrant instances of misdirection are where passages similar to "feet
and hands visible" are italicized, for those responsible for them know
that the luminous bands shed no light on nearby objects and that ac-
tually the hands and feet were not visible. The expression is a collo-
quial one, metonymy for the bands then supposed to mark the exact
position of hands and feet. Psychic research is not a game of words
but an inquiry as to the facts.
Italicized dictations, such as "seems to have very crude fingers," "in
general the visible operation of the hand seemed clumsy and awk-
ward," "ill-formed hand," are exactly what the discoverer of the foot
in action would desire the reader to attend to.

gators were to blame for the bands coming off. They at the moment
trusted the psychic's statement that the bands were loose not until
afterward did they find that she had pinned the anklets to exactly the
dimensions of her own impeccable ones. They should have measured
at once, but I have yet to meet the investigator who never forgot any-
thing he should have done. But there are few passages which should
puzzle the reader, unless he intuitively has more knowledge than the
actual observers who were convinced of particular frauds. In the
light of those discoveries many otherwise perplexing notes become not
only clear but buttress the discoveries themselves.
The pamphlet puts various questions of such quality as, "If the
garter fell off why didn't Code pick it up?"
64
It seems to be held
both that the garter did not come off and that it came off because
too loose. But it appears that Code was busily engaged in running
the dictaphone at the time and, moreover, the rules definitely forbade
his doing what is suggested. The garter was off, and this fact was af-
terward admitted by 'Walter'; did it 'fall' on again? Why, it is
asked,
65
did not Hoagland proclaim his discovery of the leg at the
moment? And precipitate a wrangle as Houdini did when he pro-
claimed fraud, and afterwards have it said that he ought to have been
thrown out! Of all cases this seems to be the one where an investi-
gator, whether he does a thing or its opposite, is most certain to be
asked why he did not do the other thing.
Dr. Crandon continues with extraordinary perseverance to put for-
ward his medium and to attack the lengthening line of accepted and
unconvinced investigators.
66
Beyond all other American cases, the
scientific investigation of this has been hampered by traditional ritual,
"psychic laws" to be taken for granted and attempts to impose ar-
bitrary and irrational rules. So far as investigators consented to such
rules they are denounced for the acts or omissions to act resulting
from the rules, and so far as any of them declined to be bound by
novel and artificial conventions they are denounced for their con-
tumacy. On the other hand there has probably never been a similar
American case which has been tried so open-mindedly and even hope-
fully, so patiently and fairly. Nor, my acquaintance with the docu-
ments compels me to add, have any adverse decisions probably been
rendered with such extreme forbearance and economy in the use of
pertinent material.
The uncommon hold which the Margery case retains upon public
attention is, I think, due to several reasons:
(1) The ordinary difficulties of guessing in the dark under
"M.H.V., 23. "M.H.r.f 23.

she was profoundly convinced that the phenomena were spurious, and
she declared that the "control" allowed and the "conditions" exacted
are far less favorable to tests than those in the European cases re-

Since the publication of my review, Mr. Dingwall has published
a lengthy report of his sittings, in the Proceedings of the English
S. P. R. (June, 1926), leaving the reader with dubious impressions.
His report was followed by a brief letter from Dr. Crandon, chiefly
composed of ridicule directed against Mr. Dingwall. Messrs. Hoag-

biologist of little experience in this field, has had two sittings and an-

by what they deemed manifestations of the other world, some dis-

There is living today a lady, Anna Eva Fay, who under control ap-
parently more exacting than any to which Margery has submitted, by
greater wonders than have ever occurred in connection with Margery,
outwitted the electrician Varley and the great scientist Crookes, who
were utterly unable to conceive of any normal mode of production.

anything I saw in eleven sittings with Margery.

CHAPTER X
SOME LOGICAL ASPECTS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
BY F. C. S. SCHILLER
I am not ashamed to confess that I have been a psychical researcher
for a long time. It was some forty-four years ago, when as a lad
of eighteen, I became a psychical researcher. It may seem very re-
markable that I have remained one ever since, without either giving
up the subject as hopeless or extracting from it any overbelief and
turning it into a religion. Perhaps this unusual tenacity in retain-
ing the researcher's attitude will seem to you less remarkable if I re-
late the story of my conversion to Psychical Research. Some one had
been telling a ghost story of the tenth-hand unauthenticated kind
which is still usual, and forty years ago was almost universal, and I
was indulging in the usual sceptical sneers which were, and still are,
fashionable among intelligent young men. But as I was arguing
against it and expressing my disbelief, the thought suddenly flashed
across my mind, "But why have these stories never been seriously in-
vestigated as they ought to be? For if there should prove to be any
truth in them, they would be tremendously important !" So I stopped
arguing and determined to investigate instead. I have been investi-
gating them ever since. Nor do I regret it for an instant, for the
study of psychics has taught me a number of very important truths
which I could hardly have learned in any other way and from any
other study.
There were, however, serious drawbacks to being a psychical re-
searcher in those days. One more than imperilled, one all but lost
any reputation for intellectual sanity one might have had, and ex-
posed oneself to several degrees of martyrdom. I remember, for
example, that the first thing I ever heard about Sir William Crookes
was that he had been a brilliant scientist, but that recently he had
unfortunately gone off his head, and lapsed into spiritualism. It was
not till many years later, when I met him, that I discovered how
grotesquely false this calumny had been. Similar stories were circu-
lated, no doubt from the highest scientific motives, about Harry Sidg-
wick and William James in short about every prominent psychical

any reputation for intellectual sanity one might have had, and ex-
posed oneself to several degrees of martyrdom. I remember, for
example. that the first thing I ever heard about Sir William Crookes
was that he had been a brilliant scientist, but that recently he had
unfortunately gone off his head, and lapsed into spiritualism. It was
not till many years later, when I met him, that I discovered how
grotesquely false this calumny had been. Similar stories were circu-
lated, no doubt from the highest scientific motives, about Harry Sidg-
wick and William James-in short about every prominent psychical
216 F. C. S. SCHILLER
researcher to my certain knowledge. I should never be surprised
to learn that by this time they had been told, or in consequence of
this lecture would now be told, also about me! For, as was so signal-
ly illustrated during the late war, there are plenty of people about
who hold that a good cause sanctifies every sort of "propaganda".
Knowing this, academic personages, especially, greatly feared to rush
in where they ran the risk of encountering angels unawares, and the
cause of free research and spiritual progress has never, it seems to me,
incurred a greater debt of gratitude than that which it owes to the
pioneers of Psychical Research. In particular was it not an act
of the loftiest moral courage when Sir Oliver Lodge, then the head
of Birmingham University, published "Raymond" in the midst of the
World War, and so recalled the world to a sense of the spiritual im-
port of the daily butcheries, which, in their nationalistic zeal and their
absorption in the Great European Dog-Fight, the churches had every-
where forgotten!
But I must return to my own humbler career as a psychical re-
searcher. When I came to Oxford in 1882 I found that there had
been in existence for six or seven years a small band of psychical re-
searchers whom I could join. They were mostly undergraduates,
with some recent graduates, not a few of whom, like Sir Charles
Oman, the Bishop of Gloucester, and Dr. F. E. Brightman have
since attained to academic distinction. They were organized into a
club called the Phasmatological Society, and they hunted ghost
stories, and, whenever they got the chance, also ghosts. A little be-
fore my time, one heroic member was believed to have actually shot
a ghost in a haunted house at Horsepath near Oxford, but of course
without mortally laying it. Our procedure, when we had run down
a ghost story, in as complete and first-hand a shape as it could be got,
was to read it out at a meeting of the Society, and to try to "explain"
it, i. e. to account for it by natural causes. If no natural explana-
tion could be suggested and we did not stick at trifles, for I re-
member we once postulated a wholly hypothetical earthquake in order
to explain a story a story was "voted" unexplained. Our idea was
that when a sufficiently large number of "unexplained" stories had
accumulated, the Society would solemnly proceed to formulate a
theory that would go beyond the bounds of acknowledged science and
"explain" them.
You will note that our procedure was inspired by the strictest
canons of Baconian induction. Needless to say the "Phas", as we

when the Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882 in
London, we became subsidiary to it, and ultimately presented our
collection of stories to its archives. It may, however, be contended
that the little Oxford Phasmatological Society was the first systematic
attempt at scientific research into psychical matters, and it is a curious
coincidence that the idea, like that of the Royal Society, first took
root in Oxford, though its development soon passed into predom-
inantly Cambridge hands.
I would also urge that from its procedure one could derive a much
better training in scientific method and the logic of real reasoning than
was then obtainable in Oxford. For the traditional Formal Logic
had, and still has, no logical connection whatever with actual reason-
ing; my experience of investigating the truth-claims of ghost-stories
was sufficient to instill this conviction into me, though I could not
then have shown, as I was subsequently able to do in Formal Logic,
that the whole pseudo-science rested on a systematic abstraction from
actual meaning. The metaphysical logicians, of whom Oxford was
inordinately proud, dwelt in a fogbelt in which no fact of any sort
or kind remained visible, and besides they too were tied at bottom to
the abstraction of formal logic. Such theories of scientific method as
existed all conceived themselves as theories, not of inquiry, but of
proof, and contented themselves with the somewhat humorous super-
fluity of bestowing their logical benediction upon truths which the
sciences had already established beyond cavil ; they all proceeded upon
the natural but fatal illusion that the method of science was best
exemplified by contemplation of choses jugees, by rumination of the
questions that had ceased to be open from time immemorial. So they
directed one's attention to the tritest truths of mathematics, of whose
discovery the record had been lost, and made us attempt to describe
how the inquirer should approach real problems and effect his selection
among rival hypotheses that all looked as if they might possibly be
true. Lastly the actual researchers, who were actively adding to the
sum of scientific knowledge, were almost always innocent of text-
book logic, and so unhampered by it, even though occasionally, when
challenged, they had a disconcerting way of looking up the logic-
books and trying to distort their own actual procedure into some-
thing like that which they found prescribed by the logicians.

claim to have been borne out by the best tendencies of modern science.
The last thirty years have witnessed a renunciation by science of the
absolute truth of Euclidean geometry and Newtonian physics, of the
universality of the "law" of gravity, and of the indestructibility of
matter, and the reduction of the conservation of energy to a metho-
dological assumption or even friction. Modern science would no
longer seriously boggle at what I should take as the first canon of
psychical research, viz. that nothing is incredible if the evidence for
it is good enough*
Many philosophers, no doubt, still cling to various sorts of a priori,
for the sake of the power which they fancy it gives them over the
sciences, and most logicians are reluctant to admit that the "laws" of
Identity and Contradiction are not basic principles of reality but
merely postulates of intelligible discourse ; but the progressive sciences
are growing more and more willing to examine any hypothesis, how-
ever shocking to our inherited prejudices, provided that it admits of
experimental verification, and submits properly accredited evidence.
But of course the open-mindedness which comes from such com-
plete empiricism is only the first requisite ; the logic which is willing
to look for empirical evidence must be followed up by a logic which
is willing to let empirical evidence accumulate. And this meant run-
ning counter to a hoary prejudice which believed that empirical evi-
dence could, and should, be "absolutely cogent". The traditional
logic was so devoted to "ideals" that it hardly ever deigned to notice
the actual, and the ideal of absolute proof was among the most mis-
leading of its ideals. For it easily lent itself to the total suppression
of cumulative evidence. Thus if, for a truth to be "proved", it is
necessary to find a case of its occurrence so "conclusive" that in no
way and on no ground can any exception be taken to it, if in addition
any case which falls short of this ideal may be rejected forthwith and
forever as "inconclusive", it is clear that the accumulation of evidence
is rendered impossible. For the ideally perfect or "conclusive" case
cannot be got, and it is logical foolishness to expect it. Sufficiently
violent assumptions of incompetence or fraud can always cast a slur
upon the most impressive evidence, and render it inconclusive. If
thereupon the inconclusive cases are not allowed to acquire collective
weight and growing probability by corroborating one another, if,
that is, logical accumulation is ruled out, each case can, and must,
be condemned on its own shortcomings. And after it is gone, the

same destructive criticism can be applied to the next case, and will
dispose of that with equal ease.
Clearly such canons of logical criticism have the effect of rendering
empirical proof impossible ; and as they originated in formal logic they
may also be suspected of having been intended to have this effect. At
any rate they proved potent to beguile and confuse even professed psy-
chical researchers. It was by these methods, applied with the utmost
ingenuity, that the late Frank Podmore was enabled to discard all
the phenomena he did not wish to believe in ; and only last summer,
when I tried to bring a very authentic case of a "spirit-photograph"
under the notice of Mr. Dingwall, the Research Officer of S. P. R.,
I was met by the reply that the case could not be published because it
was not "conclusive", and that he had "thousands" of better cases.
It seems imperative, therefore, to point out that the adoption of such
impossible standards of proof is bound to stultify psychical research,
and that their adoption is unscientific. No empirical science ever
accepts such a handicap. No scientific theory is ever proved ab-
lutely, or proved by any such coup de theatre; it is high time that
psychical researchers also learned that they must advance by the
gradual accumulation of evidence and the slow growth of probabilities
which increase the weight of one hypothesis, consolidate its superiority
over its competitors, and finally lead to its overwhelming acceptance.
These logical blunders in the theory of scientific research, not only
frustrated psychical research by setting up impossible standards, but,
what was even worse, diverted attention from the removal of a real
weakness which afflicted the subject. Psychical researchers have not
so far attained to experimental control of the matters they are in-
vestigating. They do not kuow the conditions under which the phe-
nomena they are trying to study are generated well enough to pro-
duce and examine them at will ; so they remain collectors of data and
observers, rather than experimenters. They are not able to observe
what they like and as they like, and have to wait upon fortune and
to make the most of the sporadic gifts she sends.
Now in itself this situation does not constitute a slur upon the
scientific status of a subject. It is a condition in which all sciences
find themselves at first, and in which some, like astronomy and med-
icine, must to a large extent, it seems, remain forever. But it neces-
sarily renders scientific progress slow.
It is moreover a further consequence of this lack of experimental
control over the phenomena that the severest and most trustworthy

It is moreover a further consequence of this lack of experimental

LOGICAL ASPECTS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH 221
of all the tests of truth, the pragmatic, cannot as yet be applied in
Psychical Research. We cannot as yet maintain that psychic phe-
nomena "work" so obviously and so surely that their reality is practi-
cally beyond dispute, and that disbelief in them has become merely
silly, like disbelief in telegraphy. Telepathy is not yet a cheaper sub-
stitute for telegraphy, as it should be capable of becoming if the
faculty could be controlled.
Yet here perhaps one exception may have to be recognised. Water-
finding by "dowsers," a practice known since the days of Moses, ap-
pears to have won its way to commercial recognition; at any rate
firms of well-sinkers find it profitable to employ dowsers, and will
make contracts for sinking wells based upon such employment. More-
over these contracts seem very reasonable. They proceed on the
principle, "No water, no pay!", and if the water is found at a greater
depth than was predicted, they do not charge for the extra sinking.
Moreover one frequently meets responsible persons who have been
their clients and have obtained water supplies in this manner, often
in unlikely places decried by geologists. I may mention, among my
own friends, Dr. Bridges, the Poet-Laureate, and Dr. L. P. Jacks,
the Editor of the Hibbert Journal. Clearly then dowsing is a super-
normal faculty which does to some extent stand the pragmatic test;
and this proves that psychical phenomena are not intrinsically un-
amenable to this test.
What I wish to infer from this case, and to impress on all psychical
researchers as strongly as I can, is the enormous importance of ren-
dering all psychical phenomena amenable to the pragmatic test. Its
importance is not only practical, but also logical. That its practical
importance is immense, it is easy to perceive. If the telepathic trans-
mission of thoughts from one mind to another could be relied on,
the revolution in all social relations would be incalculable. If dowsers
could be trained to find metals and oil as well as water, multi-mil-
lionaires would spring up among them. And, conversely, the fact
that they have not done so is a serious argument against the reality
of dowsing. And if communication with the departed became easy
and trustworthy, we should all find ourselves practically compelled to
live differently. But the logical situation also would be transformed.
If such psychic powers were common and in general use, it would no
longer be possible to dispute their reality. And even if it were pos-
sible, it would not be worth while. Their de facto working would be
infinitely more convincing than any amount of argumentation. So-

cieties for Psychical Research, therefore, would do well not to neglect
entirely these practical applications of their inquiries. They have
a real logical bearing upon the proof of psychical phenomena. This
was the serious point I endeavored to make, perhaps in too frivolous
a form, in the first number of the Occult Review.
On the technique of actual investigation I hardly feel competent to
say very much. To be entitled to offer advice on this question I
should have had far more experience in actual research than has
fallen to my lot; and besides the actual technique has always to be
adapted to the particular case. I will, therefore, venture to say only
one thing. It does not seem to me that any one's judgment on any
case of "mediumship" can be very valuable unless he has been able
to subject it to repeated and prolonged examination. An attempt to
pronounce judgment on a case, other than one of obvious fraud, after
one or two sittings seems to be hardly fair, either to the medium or to
the sitter. For the phenomena are still so capricious and uncontrol-
lable that, with a small number of observations no theory can be con-
firmed, and both the hits and the blanks may need to be discounted
as due to chance, while even the most intelligent inquirer can hardly
reckon on detecting all the subtler possibilities of deception and fraud
at a first glance. It is better, therefore, not to attempt investigation
of a case at all, if adequate time and attention cannot be bestowed
upon it.
On the other hand it may be useful to make some remarks on the
competing interpretations of the cases where neither the good faith
of the psychic nor the supernormal character of the phenomena is
seriously open to dispute. Such cases are rare, but I do not stand
alone in recognizing Mrs. Piper's as one of them. Granting the
facts of such cases, and I have myself received information of which
no normal explanation seems possible, the question arises, by what
hypothesis are they to be interpreted? Now prima facie there are
a number of possible hypotheses, and initially one of them may appeal
more to one mind and another to another. At present these prefer-
ences are essentially differences of taste, for no one is able to adduce
any cogent proof of the interpretation he prefers, or even to suggest
any experiment which would decisively establish it. Yet the adher-
ents of the rival hypotheses are very apt to quarrel and to waste upon
their sterile disputes energy that would be much better bestowed upon
investigation. Hence it seems sound advice to urge them not to let
such differences obstruct investigation. For it is at present much

cieties for Psychical Research, therefore, would do well not to neglect
entirely these practical applications of their inquiries. They have
a real logical bearing upon the proof of·psychical phenomena. This
was the serious point I endeavored to make, perhaps in too frivolous
a form, in the first number of the Occult Review.
On the technique of actual investigation I hardly feel competent to
say very much. To be entitled to offer advice on this question I
should have had far more experience in actual research than has
fallen to my lot; and besides the actual technique has always to be
adapted to the particular case. I will, therefore, venture to say only
one thing. It does not seem to me that any one's judgment on any
case of "mediumship" can be very valuable unless he has been able
to subject it to repeated _and prolonged examination. An attempt to
pronounce judgment on a case, other than one of obvious fraud, after
one or two sittings seems to be hardly fair, either to the medium or to
the sitter. For the phenomena are still so capricious and uncontrol-
lable that, with a small number of observations no theory can be con-
firmed, and both the hits and the blanks may need to be discounted
as due to chance, while even the most intelligent inquirer can hardly
reckon on detecting all the subtler possibilities of deception and fraud
at a first glance. It is better, therefore, not to attempt investigation
of a case at all, if adequate time and attention cannot be bestowed
upon it.
On the other hand it may be useful to make some remarks on the
competing interpretations of the cases where neither the good faith
of the psychic nor the supernormal character of the phenomena is
seriously open to dispute. Such cases are rare, but I do not stand
alone in recognizing Mrs. Piper's as one of them. Granting the
facts of such cases, and I have myself received information of which
no normal explanation seems possible, the question arises, by what
hypothesis are they to be interpreted? Now prima facie there are
a number of possible hypotheses, and initially one of them may appeal
more to one mind and another to another. At present these prefer-
ences are essentially differences of tasteJ for no one is able to adduce
any cogent proof of the interpretation he prefers, or even to suggest
any experiment which would decisively establish it. Yet the adher-
ents of the rival hypotheses are very apt to quarrel and to waste upon
their sterile disputes energy that would be much better bestowed upon
investigation. Hence it seems sound advice to urge them not to let
such differences obstruct investigation. For it is at present much
LOGICAL ASPECTS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH 223
more important to establish and multiply the facts than to devise
hypotheses for their "explanation."
A number of reasons may be assigned for this contention.
( 1 ) If there is anything in Psychical Research at all, it opens up
a region of unexplored possibilities so vast that the "facts" to be en-
countered in it are likely to be very various, very complicated, and very
different from those most familiar to us. There is, therefore, ample
room for the operations of a variety of heuristic hypotheses. One
hypothesis may be best for the apprehension of one sort of "fact,"
another for another; all may have their uses. All may prove "true"
in different parts of the field. Thus we need not deny that some of
the phenomena seem quite definitely to suggest communications from
the departed, because others, almost as definitely, do not. Nor are
we entitled to assume that because our hypotheses now seem to us
to be mutually exclusive, they will remain as exclusive as they look.
For (2) it is incumbent on us to remember that not only are the
phenomena we are seeking to apprehend doubtful, vague, and elusive,
but the hypotheses also by which we seek to apprehend them are
similarly ill-defined. They deal in terms which are really unknown
quantities to a large extent. To point this out has been a favorite
objection to the spiritist interpretation. It is asked, "What is a
spirit?" It is said that we know nothing about disembodied intel-
ligences, and can form no conception of how they would operate or
communicate. There is no harm in conceding some truth to such
objections, if they are accompanied by willingness to learn. It is also
true that we do not know nearly enough about embodied intelligences,
and have hardly begun to study how they communicate their meanings.
In any case do not similar objections hold against the terms used by
the current alternatives to the spirit-hypothesis with at least equal
force? We know nothing about the structural basis of the "tele-
pathic" intercommunication of minds, though some of us are eager
to snatch up any "ray" that the physicists discover, and to build upon
it analogies which are far-fetched and likely to be false. Others glibly
appeal to "the unconscious (or subconscious) mind," as if that term
at once explained how conscious minds were rendered porous to each
other's influence, and were not itself a first-class psychological crux.
How are we to conceive the nature of unconscious mind, and to de-
termine what it can do and what not? Yet others go still further,
and gaily postulate a "cosmic reservoir" in which to store the records
of all past events, and from which those fortunate enough to tap it

can draw unstinted draughts of potential omniscience. That would
seem an excellent way of pooling all our difficulties, if only we could
slur over the problem of intelligent selection from what would really
be an enormous rubbish heap. Others again are disposed to imagine
that "multiple personality" and "the dissociation of the self" yield
the open sesame to all the mysteries; they have overlooked that no
adequate account of personality is extant anywhere, and that the na-
ture of the self has baffled every philosophy which has attempted to
explain it. Lastly, it is very easy to allege the hypothesis of diabolical
deception, and from its very nature impossible to confute it cogently;
but are we justified in claiming to know so much about devils and
their ways that we can really prove it from the facts? Even the
most dogmatic theologians might find it hard to substantiate their
claim that they were fully familiar with the diabolic nature, and
trustworthy guides to its psychology. The truth is that devils have
always been popular favorites in accounting for any oddity of nature ;
they, therefore, easily suggest themselves to a certain profession and
to a certain type of mind. But scientific method has never found them
a profitable hypothesis, and there is little reason to think that they
will really work in Psychical Research.
(3) "Well, then, what conclusion would you draw from all this?"
I may be asked. I can see no immediate probability of conducting
crucial experiments that will establish or dismiss any or all of these
hypotheses. They may all be right, and all be wrong in part. They
may all be tried by those who think it worth the while. They may
all be of use in eliciting further facts.
Nor is there any reason why we should not try to bethink our-
selves of further theories still unheard of. For the facts are certainly
very strange, and may well be so alien to our present modes of thought
that quite unfamiliar and unsuspected analogies may yield the clues.
Even highly respectable sciences, with a long record of successful
service, may at times find themselves embarrassed by the discovery of
facts which they cannot dispute, and yet cannot interpret theoretically.
At the present moment, for example, physics finds itself at a loss to
supply a coherent theory for the facts of so familiar a phenomenon
as light. Many of the known facts point to a wave theory of light,
which only a few years ago was generally believed to have been finally
proved ; others fit only into an emission theory ; but no known theory
will cover all the known facts, and no way of rendering wave theories
compatible with emission theories has yet been devised. There is

nothing for it but to go on using both theories, without committing
oneself to either, using each for the phenomena which seem amenable
to treatment by it, and to trust to time and future discoveries to hit
upon a hypothesis which works completely and is really adequate.
I would suggest, therefore, that if such a procedure and such a sit-
uation is not beneath the dignity of so triumphant a science as phys-
ics, it is as much as can be expected from so humble and so disputed
an aspirant to scientific status as Psychical Research. It would be
rash, as things are, and it is logically quite unnecessary, for us to pin
our faith on any theory. For the degree of confidence we have in it
does not affect its power to explain. It is possible to use a hypothesis
without believing in it very much, to hold it experimentally and
heuristically, and to value it only so far as it works. Let us, there-
fore, go on using any conception and any hypothesis that looks
promising, likely to help us in apprehending a very elusive mass of
apparent facts and to be fertile in suggesting fresh experiments and
in exploring fresh regions of fact. It seems probable enough that the
facts will long continue to seem bizarre and incredible and chaotic;
but our faith in Scientific Method should embolden us to believe that,
if we go on, we shall find a way, even through the thickest jungle.
It is the scientific will to find a way which has hitherto been lacking.
I trust that I have made it intelligible how it is that I am still a
psychical researcher, even as I was forty years ago. But I am dis-
tressed to find at the end of this lecture that I can conclude with
nothing better than a profession of faith. For faith should come at
the beginning of a scientific inquiry, not at the end. At the end we
should be harvesting its fruits. But when I consider the early history
of other sciences and their agelong gropings, I do not despair. Phys-
ics blundered about with plausible but futile antitheses like the hot
and the cold, the dense and the rare, the light and the heavy, for
thousands of years, before it entered on the path of steady progress
with the mechanical hypothesis and the experimental method. Psy-
chology is more than two thousand years old, but in spite of the ut-
most ingenuity and assiduity of its practitioners it is engaged upon the

METAPSYCHICS AND THE INCREDULITY
OF PSYCHOLOGISTS
BY JOHN E. COOVER
In a recent article,

suggesting an admirable metapsychic experi-
ment, Dr. Gehrhardt reiterates
"
the wonder with which one must
regard the opposition of official science, particularly psychology, to
the new field." The opposition of the psychologist is probably strong-
er than that of his fellow scientists because much of the detail in his
particular field of knowledge has an especial pertinence to the evidence
and methods of metapsychics. To understand his position, however,
it is necessary first to examine the opposition of "official science",
which he shares, and which springs from a persistent, sometimes de-
scribed as an "obstinate," incredulity.
It is a fact that official science regards the phenomena of meta-
psychics with incredulity. It is an old fact. Official science was in-
credulous in 1848 when the Rochester Knockings began with Cath-
erine and Margaret Fox; it was still incredulous thirty-four years
later, when Professor Henry Sidgwick in the first Presidential Ad-
dress before the Society for Psychical Research said, "I say it is a
scandal that the dispute as to the reality of these phenomena should
still be going on, that so many competent witnesses should have de-
clared their belief in them, that so many others should be profoundly
interested in having the question determined, and yet that the educated
world, as a body, should still be simply in an attitude of incredulity."
There followed the further accumulations of evidence for a period of
forty-four years, and Rene Sudre,

Amphitheatre of Medicine (College of France, in Paris), under the
auspices of the School of Psychology, on March 22, 1926, exclaimed:

nomena. Why, then, does their incorporation into academic science
meet such resistance?
Thus the results of all the researches in metapsychics during the
past three-quarters of a century have failed to break down the in-
credulity of official science. Still more definitely, official science does
not accept a single phenomenon of any one of the three or four classes
of metapsychic phenomena, notwithstanding that some men of science
who have engaged in metapsychic investigation claim for many of the
phenomena of the several classes "irrefragable" and "incontrovertible"
"proof."
What is the cause of this persistent incredulity of official science?
Interested metapsychists have repeatedly faced this question, and of-
fered answers; for they know that "the final test for truth is the
agreement of experts," that the standard of evidence must be drawn
from the recognized sciences, and that to prevent a miserable failure
metapsychics must produce evidence that will convince the scientific
world. To remove this incredulity, its cause must be found and re-
moved. Until this is done, metapsychics stands without the pale of
the accredited sciences. This is the most serious problem of meta-
psychics. It has always been its most important problem, whether
fully recognized or not, and as the years of opportunity have passed,
and the incredulity of official science has remained persistent, it has be-
come more and more serious, acute, menacing. For half a century,
there has been earnest and persistent, individual and collective, effort
to adopt and maintain scientific standards in metapsychic research,
to make metapsychic research indistinguishable from scientific re-
search, in the hope of solving this problem, of winning an honored
place among the established sciences, without avail.
Various causes of the incredulity of official science are suggested by
recent writers. Rene Sudre says that

no conscientious examination of the facts. . .

He discounts these reasons for incredulity, on the grounds that new
phenomena are being constantly assimilated by official science, that
biological and psychological phenomena are granted principles that
range beyond the laws of material science, that the disputed phe-
nomena have been witnessed by eminent scientists, such as Crookes
and Richet. The causes of incredulity he is able to find do not seem
to him adequate. There is an element of culpable negligence in the
attitude of official science, a taint of dishonesty. His cure would be
persuasion, further exposition of results of metapsychic experiments
of the same character as those past and current.
Charles Richet, the eminent physiologist, in a recently published
treatise on metapsychics
3
presents the arguments of official science
against objective metapsychics: The more latitude for fraud the
more apparent are the phenomena; all mediums have been caught in
conscious or unconscious deception, hence fraud is always possible;
unless one is versed in legerdemain he cannot imagine how com-
pletely an observer can be duped; no observer can maintain con-
tinuous attention during the two or three hours of a seance ; etc., and
he says, "These doubts have occurred to me hundreds of times, and
I know, better than anyone else, the full force of these arguments.
Nevertheless, I do not think them well founded, and I am firmly con-
vinced that there are real physical metapsychic phenomena."
Richet confesses that the innumerable experiments published by
eminent men of science would not have convinced him, if he had not
himself been a witness of the four fundamental facts of Metapsy-
chics. He says he was an unwilling witness, very critical, distrustful
of the facts that forced themselves upon him. That he, nevertheless,
was able to verify those facts, under exceptional conditions, and de-
spite his desire to disprove them. They determined his belief, "and
that not at once, but after long consideration, meditation, and repe-
tition." The phenomena to which Richet gives credence, because he
has verified them, are

attitude of official science, a taint of dishonesty. His cure would be
persuasion, further exposition of results of metapsychic experiments
of the same character as those past and current.
Charles Richet, the eminent physiologist, in a recently published
treatise on metapsychics3 presents the arguments of official science
against objective metapsychics: The more latitude for fraud the
more apparent are the phenomena; all mediums have been caught in
conscious or unconscious deception, hence fraud is always possible;
unless one is versed in legerdemain he cannot imagine how com-
pletely an observer can be duped; no observer can maintain con-
tinuous attention during the two or three hours of a seance; etc., and
he says, "These doubts have occurred to me hundreds of times, and
I know, better than anyone else, the full force of these arguments.
Nevertheless, I do not think them well founded, and I am firmly con-
vinced that there are real physical metapsychic phenomena."
Richet confesses that the innumerable experiments published by
eminent men of science would not have convinced him, if he had not
himself been a witness of the four fundamental facts of Metapsy-
chics. He says he was an unwilling witness, very critical, distrustful
of the facts that forced themselves upon him. That he, nevertheless,
was able to verify those facts, under exceptional conditions, and de-
spite his desire to disprove them. They determined his belief, "and
that not at once, but after long consideration, meditation, and repe-
tition." The phenomena to which Richet gives credence, because he
has verified them, are

1. Cryptesthesia: A faculty of cognition that differs radically
from the usual sensorial faculties, A sample of evidence: Stella, in
the presence of G., whose family she does not know and cannot have
known, gave the first names of his son, of his wife, of a deceased
brother, of a living brother, of his father-in-law, and of the locality
where he lived as a child.
2. Telekinesis: Raps and the movement of objects without con-
tact. While Eusapia's head and hands were held, a large melon
weighing six pounds was moved from the sideboard to the table, the
distance between them being over a yard.
3. Ectoplasms: Hands, bodies, and objects seem to take shape in
their entirety from a cloud and take all the semblance of life. Eusa-
pia was in half-light, her left hand in my right, and her right in my
left tightly held, and before Lodge, Myers, and Ochorowics, a third
hand stroked my face, pinched my nose, pulled my hair, and gave a
smack on my shoulder heard by Ochorowics, Myers, and Lodge.
4. Premonitions: That cannot be explained by chance or per-
spicacity, and are sometimes verified in minute detail. Alice, at 2 p.m.
told me, for the first and only time, that I should soon give way to
violent anger before one, two, three persons whom she designated
with her hand as if she saw them. At 6 p.m. the unlikely and unfore-
seeable impertinence of a person absolutely unknown to Alice provoked
me to one of the strongest and most justifiable fits of anger of my
whole life before two other persons, an anger that led to my receiving
a challenge to a duel, the only one I have ever received.
Richet in his Treatise on Metapsychics has brought together the
tremendous amount of evidence that has accumulated during the past
three-quarters of a century, organized it, and indexed it with ap-
proximately 1800 names. He says he "tried to extricate the sciences
anathematized as occult from chaos, and to put in a clear light knowl-
edge that official science, in its pride of reputation, has refused to
consider. It has seemed to me that the time has come to claim for
metapsychics a place among the recognized sciences by making it con-
form to the rigor and the logical treatment which have given them
their authority.
He recognizes that "scientific men will be surprised, and perhaps
indignant"; but he thinks that a study of the evidence he presents
will shake their incredulity. Since the facts are very strange, how-
ever, "and clash with current scientific dogmas, the affirmations made
will give rise to strongly adverse criticism and to mocking incredulity."
He then presents strong argument for the acceptance of metapsychic
phenomena:

There are too many well-verified facts and rigorously conducted
METAPSYCHICS AND INCREDULITY OF PSYCHOLOGISTS 233
experiments that chance, illusion, or fraud should always be at-
tributed to all these facts and experiments without exception, (p. 595)
It is not possible that all these observers [200 competent scientists,
and a thousand others] should never have made mistakes, but the
whole constitutes a sheaf of testimony so large and homogeneous that
no criticism of details, however acute, will be able to disintegrate
and disperse, (p. 599)
To suppose that all metapsychics are but illusion is to suppose that
[twenty named eminent scientists] were all, without exception, liars
or imbeciles; it is to suppose that two hundred distinguished observers
less eminent, perhaps, but persons of high and acute intelligence, were
also liars or imbeciles, (p. 600)
I shall refer later to the sheaf of testimony as the "fagot theory",
and consider the possibility of complete and wholesale delusion.
Richet is candid and forceful. He points out that the business of
science is to establish positive facts, not to formulate negations; that
at every moment she is confronted with profound mysteries.
Therefore when new facts supported by many irrefragable proofs
are brought forward, the new facts being positive facts that do not
contradict old positive facts, lovers of truth ought to bow before them
and receive them joyfully, (p. 600)
To admit telekinesis and ectoplasms is not to destroy even the
smallest fragment of science; it is but to admit new data, and that
these are unknown energies. . . .That a hand having all the at-
tributes of a living hand should be formed from a whitish cloud in no
way nullifies the laws of circulation, nutrition, and structure of a
normal hand. It is a new fact but not a contradictory one. (p. 601)
Richet freely grants that these phenomena are not understood;
that "the more we try to analyze Cryptesthesia the less we understand
it" (p. 614) ; "its modalities and its mechanism escape us entirely."
(p. 615). And, "as regards the substance of materializations our ig-
norance is painful." (p. 476). He is sanguine, however, of important
contributions to scientific knowledge, and declares, "We must ad-
vance resolutely, using exact scientific methods." (p. 624).
Richet pleads for the acceptance of the phenomena on the grounds
of the evidence for their occurrence, not because they are in any way
understood. This appears to be a curious position, and raises a question
concerning the quality of the evidence. If the evidence for occur-
rence is sound, scientific results are already obtained, and no anxiety
should be felt lest they be disregarded by official science. Resolute
advance, by "using scientific methods", would make important con-
tributions to scientific knowledge, and the incredulity of official
science would gradually disappear. But is the evidence for a phe-

illusion and hallucination? Official science quite probably takes this
stand.

Whatever the causes the metapsychists find responsible for the ob-
stinate incredulity of official science, they are weighed and found
wanting ;
and it is possible either that undiscovered causes remain, or
that there is some error in estimating the weight of those found.
The conservatism of official science in its admission of new facts
is a natural precaution against error and the waste of time and energy.
The evidence for the new phenomenon will have had to meet the
requirements for rigorous proof. It is a curious fact that during
the past half-century, many new facts have been presented with
proper credentials and have been admitted; some of them were very
strange and were revolutionary in their effects upon current laws
of nature, but none of them were metapsychic. Conservatism cannot
be an unjust cause of the incredulity.
General indifference of official science to metapsychic phenomena
may be granted, but the indifference has not been complete. For
three-quarters of a century distinguished men of science have given
occasional professional attention to them and have investigated them
with negative results. And many other intelligent observers have
from time to time seen and reported natural methods of producing
what were currently accepted as supernormal phenomena.
The persistence of this stream of negative evidence has had the ef-
fect of strengthening the incredulity of official science :
1. Fraud is not only frequent and general, but it is witnessed
and published.
2. Astute, and sometimes eminent, observers even scientists
witness the same phenomena and pronounce them metapsychic.
3. Some of the more eminent scientists have persisted in main-
taining the validity of their observations at the same time that they
were cognizant of the adverse reports of other observers upon the
same phenomena, and cognizant of the disabilities of observation and
report of phenomena produced under the identically restricted con-
ditions, pointing with confidence to the corroboration of their ob-
servations by independent witnesses in other places at other times.

The application of each of these four points may be shown in the
investigation of "raps", for which eminent scientists have presented
"irrefragable proof," and which of all telekinetic phenomena Richet
wisely suggests are most worthy of study. The observations upon
raps will also illustrate the effect of the stream of negative evidence
upon the incredulity of official science.
It will be recalled that raps started the movement known as
Modern Spiritualism, in Hydesville, New York, in March, 1848, in
a family consisting of John D. Fox, his wife Margaret, and their
two younger daughters, Margaret aged fourteen, and Catherine aged
twelve. Owing to the annoyance of curious crowds that swarmed the
premises, Kate was sent to the neighboring city of Rochester to stay
with her sister Mrs. Fish, and Maggie was sent to her brother's
farm. The raps followed the girls and the Rochester Knockings
soon became the object of public investigation. Three public meet-
ings were held in Corinthian Hall, in November, 1848, to receive the
reports of investigating committees appointed from the floor. With
each report confessing failure to determine a natural cause for the
raps, the excitement grew until it flared into a sensation that spread
over the world and, much abated, has continued to the present time,
( 1 ) The chairman of the last Committee was Dr. E. P. Lang-
worthy, a young physician in Rochester, who took further oppor-
tunity to investigate these raps, and reported his results to the New
York Excelsior, February 2, 1850. The knockings were always
under the Fox girls' feet, or if upon doors or tables their dresses were
in contact with the objects rapped. He concluded that the mysterious
rapping was so intimately connected with the persons of these girls
that they voluntarily produced them.
(2) John W. Hurn, of Rochester, wrote a number of articles to
the New York Tribune, during January and February, 1850. He
related that the Fox girls could get no sounds when they were com-
pletely isolated from the floor, claimed that the whole affair was the
most miserable imposition ever attempted upon a civilized community,
that he had entered into an agreement with the girls to procure ink
to use on walls that would appear visible after a short time, and to
deliver spirit blows to the heads of sitters.
(3) The Rev. John fyl. Austin, of Auburn, wrote to the Tribune,
March 27, 1850, saying that he had been three times to hear the
sounds, but thought they were made by human agency. He had re-
liable information that "persons in Auburn" could make all these
knockings with the cracking of the toe joints, without any movement
the eye can detect.

December, 1850, announcing the toe-joint theory. He stood upon
the stage in Corinthian Hall and demonstrated the raps by cracking
his toes.
(5) The Rev. C. Chauncey Burr wrote to the New York Tribune,

are produced, but by much practice he learned to produce them him-

upon his credulity, and so loud that they were heard in every part
of a hall crowded with an audience of a thousand people. He made
the raps by snapping the toe-joints.
(6) Three Buffalo University professors, Austin Flint, M.D.,
Charles A. Lee, M.D., and C. B. Coventry, M.D., investigated the
raps of Margaret Fox in the Phelps House and reported their results
to the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, February 18, 1851, and the
Buffalo Medical Journal for March. They immediately saw by ob-
serving the countenance that the raps were the result of voluntary
effort, and concluded that they were made by the dislocation of bones
at the joints :
knees, ankles, toes, or hips. They studied the mechanism
in a patient who could make the raps with her knee-joints and made
a medical report. They observed that the anatomical and physio-
logical books had neglected articular sounds a circumstance that
permitted the deception practiced by the Fox girls to gain headway.
(7) At another sitting at the Phelps House, for the purpose of
resisting the damaging report of the Buffalo Professors, Mrs. Fish
and Margaret Fox produced phenomena in profusion for the gratifi-
cation of friends and believers. But that sitting is listed here because

how to make the raps by snapping the toes. She also said that Mar-

she could produce a few raps with her knees and ankles.

these cases. After many experiments, he concluded definitely that the
sounds were entirely at the control of the girls. Every rap was at-
tended with a slight movement of the person of the rapper. A very
distinct motion of the dress was visible about the right hypogastric
region. He declared that there was no necessity for wonderment on
account of the rapping sounds so long as one is excluded from a per-
sonal examination of the rappers.
(10) Rev. H. O. Sheldon, of Berea, Ohio, spent some time in-
vestigating the subject. The mediums that he detected rapped by
snapping their toes.
(11) Three Professors of Harvard College, Agassiz, Peirce, and
Horsford, composed a part of an investigating committee appointed
to pass upon phenomena offered to win a prize of five hundred dollars
put up by the Boston Courier, in June, 1857. Mrs. Leah Fox Fish
Brown and Catherine Fox were the first mediums to be employed.
Agassiz declared with emphasis that there was an easy physiological
explanation of all the effects that the Fox sisters, or any other rappers,
produced. The Editor, Mr. George Lunt, issued a report in a pamph-
let dated 1859. Whenever conditions were favorable for obser-
vation, the raps did not come ; when they were not, they came in pro-
fusion. Mr. Clark, assistant to Agassiz, produced raps on a box
with his knuckles in a way that could not be detected. Agassiz said
the taps of the mediums were produced by the bones of the feet.
(12) The Seybert Commission of the University of Pennsylvania
investigated the raps produced through Margaret Fox Kane, in
November, 1884, and "Dr." Henry Slade, in February, 1885. Pro-
fessor Furness placed his hand upon one of the feet of Margaret Fox
and distinctly felt pulsations in her foot, but no movement, while
the raps were being produced. Both Miss Fox and Slade knew when
other raps than their own were produced, no matter how similar
in sound.
(13) In May, 1888, Margaret Fox Kane sent from London a
letter to the New York Herald, in which she said, "Spiritualism is a
curse ... Fanatics like Mr. Luther R. Marsh, Mr. John L. O'Sul-
livan, ex-Minister to Portugal, and hundreds equally as learned,
ignore the Mappings' (which is the only part of the phenomena that
is worthy of notice) and rush madly after the glaring humbugs that
flood New York. . . Like old Judge Edmonds and Mr. Seybert, of
Philadelphia, they become crazed, and at the direction of their fraud
'mediums' they are induced to part with all their worldly possessions
as well as their common sense. . ."
(14) After coming to New York, Margaret Fox Kane granted
an interview to the New York Herald, in August, 1888, in which
she said she was going to expose spiritualism from its very foundation.
She loathed the thing she had been during her years of deception.
She proposed to expose the raps to the public, and produced raps for
the reporter on the floor near his feet, under his chair, under a table,

these cases. After many experiments, he concluded definitely that the
sounds were entirely at the control of the girls. Every rap was at-
tended with a slight movement of the person of the rapper. A very
distinct motion of the dress was visible about the right hypogastric
region. He declared that there was no necessity for wonderment on
account of the rapping sounds so long as one is excluded from a per-
sonal examination of the rappers.
(10) Rev. H. 0. Sheldon, of Berea, Ohio, spent some time in-
vestigating the subject. The mediums that he detected .rapped by
snapping their toes.
( 11 ) Three Professors of Harvard College, Agassiz, Peirce, and
Horsford, composed a part of an investigating committee appointed
to pass upon phenomena offered to win a prize of five hundred dollars
put up by the Boston Courier, in June, 1857. Mrs. Leah Fox Fish
Brown and Catherine Fox were the first mediums to be employed.
Agassiz declared with emphasis that there was an easy physiological
explanation of all the effects that the Fox sisters, or any other rappers,
produced. The Editor, Mr. George Lunt, issued a report in a pamph-
let dated 1859. Whenever conditions were favorable for obser-
vation, the raps did not come; when they were not, they came in pro-
fusion. Mr. Clark, assistant to Agassiz, produced raps on a box
with his knuckles in a way that could not be detected. Agassiz said
the taps of the mediums were produced by the bones of the feet.
(12) The Seybert Commission of the University of Pennsylvania
investigated the raps produced through Margaret Fox Kane, in
November, 1884, and "Dr." Henry Slade, in February, 1885. Pro-
fessor Furness placed his hand upon one of the feet of Margaret Fox
and distinctly felt pulsations in her foot, but no movement, while
the raps were being produced. Both Miss Fox and Slade knew when
other raps than their own were produced, no matter how similar
in sound.
(13) In May, 1888, Margaret Fox Kane sent from London a
letter to the New York Herald, in which she said, "Spiritualism is a
curse ... Fanatics like Mr. Luther R. Marsh, Mr. John L. O'Sul-
livan, ex-Minister to Portugal, and hundreds equally as learned,
ignore the 'rappings' (which is the only part of the phenomena that
is worthy of notice) and rush madly after the glaring humbugs that
flood New York... Like old Judge Edmonds and Mr. Seybert, of
Philadelphia, they become crazed, and at the direction of their fraud
'mediums' they are induced to part with all their worldly possessions
as well as their common sense ... "
(14) After coming to New York, Margaret Fox Kane granted
an interview to the New York Herald, in August, 1888, in which
she said she was going to expose spiritualism from its very foundation.
She loathed the thing she had been during her years of deception.
She proposed to expose the raps to the public, and produced raps for
the reporter on the floor near his feet, under his chair, under a table,
on the other side of the door, on the legs of a piano.

(15) On October 21, 1888, Margaret appeared at the Academy
of Music in New York before a large audience, enunciated her solemn
abjuration of spiritualism: "That I have been chiefly instrumental
in perpetrating the fraud of spiritualism upon a too confiding public,
most of you doubtless know. . . . The greatest sorrow of my life has
been that this is true, and though it has come late in my day, I am
now prepared to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, so help me God!"... A plain wooden stool, resting upon
four short legs, was placed before her. Removing her shoe, she placed
her right foot upon this table. The entire house became breathlessly
still, and was rewarded by a number of little short, sharp raps those
mysterious sounds which for more than forty years frightened and be-
wildered hundreds of thousands of people in this country and Europe.
A committee, consisting of three physicians taken from the audience,
then ascended to the stage, and having made an examination of her
foot during the progress of the Mappings,' unhesitatingly agreed that
the sounds were made by the action of the first joint of her large toe.
(16) In this confession Margaret Fox Kane had the support of
her sister, Kate Fox Jencken, who had recently returned from Europe
and who sat in a box during the abjuration and demonstration.
(17) Kate Fox Jencken also granted an independent interview
to the New York papers in which she said: "Spiritualism is a hum-
bug from beginning to end . . . The manifestations at Hydesville in
1848 were all humbuggery, every bit of them. . . / certainly know
that every so-called manifestation produced through me in London or
anywhere else was a fraud. The time has come for Maggie and me
to set ourselves right before the world . . . and not leave this base
fabric of deceit behind us unexposed."
It is true that these mothers of spiritism were declared com-
pletely unbalanced, that fast living had destroyed their judgment and
blunted their moral sense, and that their confessions were fraudulent.
But there is a completely corroborative fact that is decisive in its
support of the confessions And it has been almost wholly overlooked.
When Margaret Fox and her mother were in Philadelphia, engaged
in "spiritualistic manifestations," in 1852, Margaret met Dr. Elisha
Kent Kane, the intrepid arctic explorer. He was much struck with
her naivete and her danger. Margaret was eighteen and beautiful.
In a letter to her he described his first impression of her: "A little
Priestess, cunning in the mysteries of her temple, and weak in every-
thing but the power with which she played her part. A sentiment
almost of pity stole over his worldly heart as he saw through her
disguise." He sought to remove her from her life of deception, and
from the influence of her elder sister Mrs. Leah Fox Fish Brown
Underbill. He wrote many letters to both herself and Kate, warning

them of the dangers ahead of them, pleading with them to turn to
a good life before the shackles became too strong, and offering them
help. They agreed, and he put Margaret in school; Katie had
promised to live with them after Dr. Kane married Margaret. He
was especially fearful that the "rappings" would be found out, and
adjured them to remain faithful to their promise not to have any-
thing to do with seances anymore. He returned from his second ex-
pedition, married Margaret, and died.
(18) Margaret Fox Kane, in 1888, said: "From the first of our
intimate acquaintance, Dr. Kane knew that the 'rappings' which I
practiced were fraudulent. . . I simply obeyed the impulse of my
candid regard for him, when the knowledge of his devotion grew
upon me, and confided to him the whole secret of the fraud, together
with my increasing repugnance to the life I was living."
Here was an early confession not only made but acted upon. The
Fox girls only repeated it to the public forty-five years later in New
York.
This is a part of the stream of negative evidence that undoubtedly
supported the incredulity of official science concerning the supernormal
nature of spiritualistic raps. And it might well extend to other
telekinetic phenomena, or to any "manifestations" through the Fox
sisters, the greatest mediums of the early days, in spite of the eminence
of the witnesses.
In the statements of Kate Fox Jencken quoted above she explains
that all the phenomena (including raps) ever produced anywhere
through her were fraudulent. Let us now examine the records of
observations of her phenomena written by an eminent man of science
who made "Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism" during
1871-74:
With mediums, generally it is necessary to sit for a formal seance
before anything is heard; but in the case of Miss Fox it seems only
necessary for her to place her hand on any substance for loud thuds
to be heard in it, like a triple pulsation, sometimes loud enough to be
heard several rooms off. In this manner I have heard them in a
living tree, on a sheet of glass, on a stretched iron wire, on a stretched
membrane, on a tambourine, on the roof of a cab, and on the floor of
a theatre. Moreover, actual contact is not always necessary: I have
had these sounds proceeding from the floor, walls, etc., when the
medium's hands and feet were held, when she was standing on a chair,
when she was enclosed in a wire cage, and when she had fallen faint-
ing on a sofa. I have heard them on a glass harmonicon, I have felt
them on my own shoulder and under my own hands. I have heard
them on a sheet of paper, held between the fingers by a piece of thread

Crookes' observations on Ectoplasm through Kate Fox:
The first instance which I shall give took place, it is true, at a dark
seance, but the result was not less satisfactory on that account. I
was sitting next to the medium, Miss Fox, the only other persons
present being my wife and a lady relative, and I was holding the
medium's two hands in one of mine, whilst her feet were resting on
my feet. Paper was on the table before us, and my disengaged hand
was holding a pencil.
A luminous hand came down from the upper part of the room, and
after hovering near me for a few seconds, took the pencil from my
hand, rapidly wrote on a sheet of paper, threw the pencil down, and
then rose up over our heads, gradually fading into darkness, (p. 91 )

Crookes' observations on Telekinesis through Kate Fox:
Miscellaneous occurrences of a complex character, Under this
heading I propose to give several occurrences which cannot be other-
wise classified owing to their complex character. Out of more than
a dozen cases, I will select two. The first occurred in the presence
of Miss Kate Fox. To render it intelligible I must enter into some
details.
Miss Fox had promised to give me a seance at my house one evening
in the spring of last year. Whilst waiting for her, a lady relative,
with my two eldest sons, aged fourteen and eleven, were sitting in the
dining-room, where the seances were always held, and I was sitting
by myself, writing in the library. Hearing a cab drive up and the
bell ring, I opened the door to Miss Fox, and took her directly into
the dining-room. She said she would not go upstairs, as she could not
stay very long, but laid her bonnet and shawl on a chair in the room.
I then went to the dining-room door, and telling the two boys to go
into the library and proceed with their lessons, I closed the door be-
hind them, locked it, and (according to my usual custom at seances)
put the key in my pocket.
We sat down, Miss Fox being on my right hand and the other lady
on my left. An alphabetic message was soon given to turn the gas
out, and we thereupon sat in total darkness, I holding Miss Fox's
two hands in one of mine the whole time. Very soon a message was
given in the following words: "We are going to bring something to
show our power;" and almost immediately afterwards we all heard
the tinkling of a bell, not stationary, but moving about in all parts of

the room ; at one time by the wall, at another in a further corner of
the room, now touching me on the head, and now tapping against
the floor. After ringing about the room in this manner for fully five
minutes, it fell upon the table close to my hands.
During the time this was going on no one moved, and Miss Fox's
hands were perfectly quiet. I remarked that it could not be my little
hand-bell which was ringing, for I left that in the library. (Shortly
before Miss Fox came I had occasion to refer to a book which was
lying on a corner of a book-shelf. The bell was on the book, and I
put it on one side to get the book. That little incident had impressed
on my mind the fact of the bell being in the library.) The gas was
burning brightly in the hall outside the dining-room door, (
so that this
could not be opened without letting light into the room, even had there
been an accomplice in the house with a duplicate key, which there
certainly was not.
I struck a light. There, sure enough, was my own bell lying on
the table before me. I went straight into the library. A glance
showed me that the bell was not where it ought to have been. I said
to my eldest boy, "Do you know where my little bell is?" "Yes,
papa," he replied, "there it is," pointing to where I had left it. He
looked up as he said this, and then continued, "No it's not there,
but it was there a little time ago." "How do you mean? has any-
one come in and taken it?" "No," said he, "no one has been in; but
I am sure it was there, because when you sent us in here out of the
dining-room, J. (the youngest boy) began ringing it so that I could
not go on with my lessons, and I told him to stop." J. corroborated
this, and said that, after ringing it, he put the bell down where he
had found it. (pp. 96-98 )

Why should official science be expected to accept the fact of tele-
kinesis, upon the basis of "irrefragable proof" of rapping or other
phenomena produced through the mediumship of Kate Fox ? William
Crookes does not stand alone in disclaiming the possibility of a natu-
ral agency. Very probably the larger proportion of the 13,000 signers
of the Memorial to Congress, in 1854, could have testified to the raps
through this same medium producing "a sheaf of testimony" un-
exampled by any other. Is it not possible that all of the witnesses
for their supernormal nature have been wrong in each and every
instance? The fagot theory is dangerous.
If such is the case with the phenomena of the Fox sisters, can the
phenomena of other mediums be regarded free from suspicion, even
though "irrefragable proof" is offered by eminent scientists for them?

In most of the summaries of evidence, phenomena of "Dr." Henry
Slade, Miss Florence Cook, Daniel Dunglas Home, and Eusapia
242 JOHN B. COOVBR
Palladino are included. Official science has some negative evidence
on all of them.
It is well known that the great Slade was a notorious and resource-
ful imposter, and we may record a few of the counts against him :
(1) In 1872, Henry Slade was caught in fraud in New York by
John W. Truesdell, who had two sittings with him. Clasping the
medium's hands at the small seance table, and being held close to it,
Truesdell felt something touching him and pulling at his clothing
as if there was some one under the table; directly, the thing came up
into his lap. Slade said it was a materialized spirit-hand. A surrepti-
tious glance, hardly won, indicated a foot. Watching his oppor-
tunity, when the "spirit-hand" was playing its most venturesome
tricks, Truesdell suddenly recoiled from the table. .
.just in time to
see the "Doctor's'* left foot withdraw from his lap to the medium's
slipper. He saw plainly the movements of the cords in the medium's
wrist when the "spirits" were producing slate-writing. At the second
sitting, that took place months later, T. refused to give his name, but
left in his overcoat the name of Samuel Johnson. While waiting for
the medium he noticed a slate hidden under a low sideboard, covered
with a stock message, and upon it he wrote a second message in a bold
hand: "Henry! Look out for this fellow he is up to snuff ! Alcinda"
(the name of Slade's deceased wife). In the sitting, T. got a message
from "Mary Johnson" on the first slate. The next slate fell to the
floor, and, when regained, presented the double message on the sub-
stituted slate: Slade was at first furious, but he quickly recovered,
acknowledged T. as a great medium, and they exchanged tricks.
(2) In 1876, Henry Slade was unmasked in London by Profes-
sor Lankester and Dr. Donkin. They caught him in the act of sub-
stituting a slate upon which a "spirit message" had been prepared.
Criminal prosecution followed. After a trial at Bow Street Police
Court lasting three days, Slade was sentenced to three months' hard
labor. He took appeal, which was sustained, on the ground that the
words "by palmistry or otherwise" had been omitted in the indict-
ment. Before he could be arrested on the new summons, Slade fled
to the continent, in 1877, and presented himself to Professor Zollner
at Leipzig.
(3) In 1882, Henry Slade was caught in fraud in Belleville,
Ontario, Dr. Abbott saw Slade's heel making the raps against the
rung of his chair. Mr. James Starling, when touched under the table
by an ectoplasmic hand, suddenly raised his right foot; the "hand"
felt like the calf of a leg, and on Slade's countenance there was an
expression of pain. Mr. A. McGinnis saw the slate passing under
the table on Slade's left foot. Chief McKinnon detected Slade
causing telekinetic phenomena on a chair with his toe. They saw him
writing "spirit messages," and saw him substituting slates. They con-
fronted him with his fraud, and upon his confession and his accom-

felt like the calf of a leg, and on Slade's countenance there was an
expression of pain. Mr. A. McGinnis saw the slate passing under
the table on Slade's left foot. Chief McKinnon detected Slade
causing telekinetic phenomena on a chair with his toe. They saw him
writing "spirit messages," and saw him substituting slates. They con-
fronted him with his fraud, and upon his confession and his accom-
METAPSYCHICS AND INCREDULITY OP PSYCHOLOGISTS 243
modatingly showing them his tricks, they permitted him to catch the
noon train for the East.
(4) In 1885, Henry Slade was caught in fraud by the Seybert
Commission. They saw his slates with prepared messages, they saw
him substituting the slates, they saw him making scratching motions
with his thumb to simulate spirit writing. At the moment a slate
had been substituted, in preparation for the long process of getting
spirit writing, Professor Sellers asked: "Dr. Slade, will you allow
me to see that slate?" The reply was, "No, not now; the con-
ditions are not favorable." Professor Furness, the great Shakes-
pearian scholar, had seen the prepared message on that slate. At the
close of their investigation Professor Sellers said : "The methods of
this medium's operations appear to me to be perfectly transparent, and
I wish to say emphatically that I am astonished beyond expression at
the confidence of this man in his ability to deceive, and at the reckless-
ness of the risks which he assumes in his deceptions, which are prac-
ticed in the most barefaced manner."
(5) In 1886, Slade created a furore in Hamburg among the
spiritualists. But he balked at tests, and was out-conjured there.
Dr. Borchert wrote to Slade offering him one thousand marks if he
would produce writing between locked slates, similar to the writing
alleged to have been executed at the Zollner seances. The medium
took no notice of the professor's letter. Slade could do nothing in the
presence of the conjurer Carl Wilmann, and the conjurer Schradieck
eclipsed Slade in his own tricks, making use of a "spirit hand" by
means of his left foot, just as Slade did.
Daniel Dunglas Home is said never to have publicly exposed in
fraud, which may have been owing to the special protection afforded
him by his peculiar social relations that made his observers his hosts.
Nevertheless, there are reported charges of suspicious circumstances
against him:
(1) A spirit hand that could be seen against the faint light of
the window appeared and disappeared at the edge of the table. It
was observed to be continuous with Home's body : "The situation at
this point struck me so forcibly the trick so plain to my eyes and
the reverential and adoring expression of the company . . .that I
was seized with a strong impulse to laugh."
(2) Delia Logan, the journalist, in writing of one of Home's
seances at the house of a nobleman in London, says that the medium
failing to produce balls of fire tried for luminous hands. In the
darkened house Home groped his way alone to the head of the broad
staircase where every few minutes a pair of luminous hands were
thrown up. The audience was satisfied generally. But the host
stood near the mantel piece and had seen Home abstractedly place a
small bottle upon it; he slipped the bottle into his pocket, and upon
examination found it to contain phosphorated oil. He had seen

244 JOHN E. COOVER
Home's marvels and had testified to them freely, but after the dis-
covery of the phosphorous trick he dropped him at once.
(3) Solovovo wrote that it had always seemed to him that action
by Home's feet was often not a very improbable hypothesis, and that
detailed descriptions, even those of Sir William Crookes, were ex-
tremely faulty in this particular respect. That the spirit hand was
not a stuffed glove, at least when it worked under the table, is seen
from AksakofFs description : "Tender but firm fingers began to work,
trying to take off the ring ;
. . . and I was fully convinced these were
living, warm, thin human fingers/* There was no mention of the con-
trol of Home's feet, however. All these omissions are very unfor-
tunate.
(4) In the action brought by Mrs. Jane Lyon, in 1867, against
Home, for the recovery of some 30,000, the testimony convicted him
of culpable fraud. Through
'
'spirit messages" from the deceased
husband, Home induced the lady to (a) adopt him as her son, (b)
set aside 24,000 to yield him an annual income of 700, (c) make
a will giving him the arms and name of Lyon and all the property,
and (d) make him a birthday present of 6,800. After ten days of
trial, Vice-Chancellor Giffard decreed that the gifts and deeds were
fraudulent and void.
(5) Home refused Mr. Addison's offer of 50 to float in the
air in his presence ; and he declined the Emperor Napoleon's proposal
for Robert Houdin, the conjurer, to be present at one of his seances.
Miss Florence Cook and Miss Showers appear to have given
seances together which permitted Serjeant Cox to study their mate-
rialized spirits and led to the consequent exposure of Miss Showers
in April, 1874.
(1) Cox studied the "spirits," "Katie" and "Florence," moving
about together in a lighted room; he saw that they could breathe,
talk, perspire, and eat; and that in face, complexion, gesture, and
voice, they precisely resembled the two mediums who were asserted
to be lying entranced behind the curtains. When the form of
"Florence" appeared in the aperture between the curtains, Mrs. Ed-
wards opened the curtains wider. In the spirit's struggles to pre-
vent this, the head-dress fell off, and revealed the spirit's head as that
of Miss Showers. The chair where the medium should have been
sitting was seen to be empty. The medium was masquerading as
a spirit.
(2) At one of Florence Cook's seances, Mr. W. Volckman scru-
tinized the form, features, gestures, size, style, and peculiarities of ut-
terance of the so-called spirit. He grasped the spirit form and found
he held the medium. [Crookes, who studied the phenomena of Miss
Cook, referred to this incident as a "disgraceful occurrence" that cast
unjust suspicion upon an innocent young woman].

with water, and when a light was struck found himself grasping
the hand of the medium.
(4) Some half a dozen years later, in 1880, Sir G. Sitwell and
Carl von Buch seized the spirit and found it to be the medium, Mrs.
Corner (formerly Miss Cook).
Podmore says:
Reading between the lines, we are forced to recognize that the con-
fidence expressed by scientific witnesses in the genuineness of these
"materializations" is inextricably bound up with their confidence in
the personal integrity of the medium, and Miss Cook's later career,
at any rate, scarcely allows us to suppose that such confidence was
ever well founded.
It is well known that Eusapia Palladino has been frequently caught
in fraud, and it is said that her early training included legerdemain.
Sitters have recognized in her an adept in conjuring. Those scientists
who report favorably upon her phenomena recognize that the weight
of their evidence depends upon the impossibility of fraud.
The illustrations of suspicious circumstances of fraud that are
brought together here constitute but a very small fraction of the
stream of negative evidence that without doubt supports the persistent
incredulity of official science. They are not intended to offer a means
of estimating the full weight of all the negative evidence. Rather,
they were chosen for the purpose of explaining why official science
hesitates to accept the favoring results of investigations in metapsy-
chics carried out by the most eminent scientists such as Crookes,
Lodge, and Richet and of providing some concrete material for use
in the constructive intimations of this exposition.
What weight has Crookes* report on the phenomena of Kate Fox?
Of Home? Of Miss Cook? The rating by official science is prob-
ably just zero. The Zollner report on Henry Slade is also, even more
positively, rated at zero. The various reports on Eusapia Palladino
probably receive no higher rating.
The stream of negative evidence warns official science that all
metapsychic phenomena may be illusory; may be but physiological,
psychological, or simple legerdemain.

Another cause for the incredulity of "official science" is to be found
in the prevalent methods of metapsychic investigation, and this cause
perhaps has much greater weight than the stream of negative evidence.

pear." But since this is true in all science, why does it have special
significance in metapsychics ? Because in science the experimenter
controls the conditions and in metapsychics the medium controls the
conditions. In case the medium is not satisfied with the conditions
proposed by the investigator, who in fact is only a sitter, she need not
produce the phenomena, and she is excused on the grounds of their
uncontrollability.
The reports of metapsychic investigations do not always show how
completely the control of the conditions under which the phenomena
occur lies with the medium, and many earnest students of the litera-
ture will be ready to dispute the fact. We can do no better than to
examine one of the best possible cases : the classical report by Crookes
on the phenomena of D. D. Home.4
It reads like a laboratory re-
port, and the natural presumption of the reader would be that the
experiments followed laboratory procedure.
Eighteen years after the research, Crookes, in response to earnest
entreaty for the long promised amplified report of his investigations,
published his notes that were written while the phenomena were
going forward and sometimes copied or expanded immediately after.
Curiously enough, the heading for these "Notes" carries the term
"seances" instead of "experiments."
The Seance of June 21st, 1871, at Mr. Crookes' house is described
in the "Notes" as follows:
Wednesday, June 21st, 1871. Sitting at 20, Mornington-road.
From 10:45 to 11:45. (This seance was held shortly after the
previous one [8:40 to 10:30 on the same evening]. We all got up,
moved about, opened the windows, and changed our positions.
Present: Mr. D. D. Home (medium), Mrs. Wr, Crookes, Mr.
Wr. Crookes, Mrs. Humphrey, Mr. C. Gimingham, Mr. Serjt. Cox,
Mr. Wm. Crookes, Mrs. Wm. Crookes.
In the dining-room. The table and apparatus the same as before.
The light was diminished, but there was still light enough to en-
able us to distinguish each other plainly and see every movement.
The apparatus was also distinctly visible.
The automatic register was pushed up close to the index of the
balance.
We sat in the following order: [Cut of rectangular table, with
positions labeled Mrs. Wm. C. sat between Home and the apparatus
(mahogany board, etc.), and Mr. Wm. Crookes sat by the apparatus].
A lath was lying on the table. [A foot from the edge at which
Home sat].

In the dining-room. The table and apparatus the same as before.
The light was diminished~ but there was still light enough to en-
able us to distinguish each other plainly and see every movement.
The apparatus was also distinctly visible.
The automatic register was pushed up close to the index of the
balance.
We sat in the following order: [Cut of rectangular table, with
positions labeled-Mrs. Wm. C. sat between Home and the apparatus
(mahogany board, etc.), and Mr. Wm. Crookes sat by the apparatus].
A lath was lying on the table. [A foot from the edge at which
Home sat].
Almost immediately a message came, "Hands off." After sitting
quiet for a minute or two, all holding hands, we heard loud raps on
METAPSYCHICS AND INCREDULITY OF PSYCHOLOGISTS 247
the table; then on the floor by the weight apparatus. The apparatus
was then moved and the spring balance was heard to move about
strongly. We then had the following message:
"Weight altered a little. Look/'
I then got up and looked at the register. It had descended to 14
pounds, showing an additional tension of (14 S-) 9 pounds.
As this result had been obtained when there was scarcely light
enough to see the board and index move, I asked for it to be repeated
when 'there was more light. The gas was turned up and we sat as
before. Presently the board was seen to move up and down (Mr.
Home being some distance off [sitting or standing?] and not touch-
ing the table, his hands being held), and the index was seen to descend
to 7 pounds, where the register stopped. This showed a tension of
75=2 pounds.
Mr. Home now told us to alter our position. We now sat as
follows: [Cut of positions; Mr. Wm. Crookes is moved two places
further from the apparatus, and Home sits by it].
Mr. Home thereupon moved his chair to the extreme corner of the
table and turned his feet quite away from the apparatus close to Mrs.
H. Loud raps were heard on the table and then on the mahogany
board, and the latter was shaken strongly up and down. The follow-
ing message was then given :
"We have now done our utmost''
On going to the spring balance it was seen by the register to have
descended to 9 pounds, showing an increase of tension of 4 pounds.
The apparatus was now removed away from the table, and we re-
turned to our old places (see first diagram).
We sat still for a few minutes, when a message came :
$
"Hands off the table, and all joined."
We therefore sat as directed.
Just in front of Mr. Home and on the table, in about the position
shown on the first diagram, was a thin wooden lath 23^4 inches long,
\Y2 inch wide, and % inch thick, covered with white paper. It was
plainly visible to all, and was one foot from the edge of the table.
Presently the end of this lath, pointing towards Mr. Wr. Crookes,
rose up in the air to the height of about 10 inches. The other end
then rose up to a height of about five inches, and the lath then floated
about for more than a minute in this position, suspended in the air,
with no visible means of support. It moved sideways and waved gent-
ly up and down, just like a piece of wood on the top of small waves
of the sea. The lower end then gently sank till it touched the table
and the other end then followed.
Whilst we were all speaking about this wonderful exhibition of
force the lath began to move again, and rising up as it did at first,
it waved about in a somewhat similar manner. The startling novelty
of this movement having now worn off, we were all enabled to follow

the table; then on the floor by the weight apparatus. The apparatus
was then moved and the spring balance was heard to move about
strongly. We then had the following message:
"Weight altered a little. Look."
I then got up and looked at the register. It had descended to 14
pounds, showing an additional tension of (14-5=) 9 pounds.
As this result had been obtained when there was scarcely light
enough to see the board and index move, I asked for it to be repeated
when 'there was more light. The gas was turned up and we sat as
before. Presently the board was seen to move up and down (Mr.
Home being some distance off [sitting or standing?] and not touch-
ing the table, his hands being held), and the index was seen to descend
to 7 pounds, where the register stopped. This showed a tension of
7-5=2 pounds.
Mr. Home now told us to alter our position. We now sat as
follows: [Cut of positions; Mr. Wm. Crookes is moved two places
further from the apparatus, and Home sits by it].
Mr. Home thereupon moved his chair to the extreme corner of the
table and turned his feet quite away from the apparatus close to Mrs.
H. Loud raps were heard on the table and then on the mahogany
board, and the latter was shaken strongly up and down. The follow-

We sat still for a few minutes, when a message came: ..!
"Hands off the table, and all joined."
We therefore sat as directed.
Just in front of Mr. Home and on the table, in about the position
shown on the first diagram, was a thin wooden lath 23% inches long,
1~ inch wide, and Ys inch thick, covered with white paper. It was
plainly visible to all, and was one foot from the edge of the table.
Presently the end of this lath, pointing towards Mr. Wr. Crookes,
rose up in the air to the height of about 10 inches. The other end
then rose up to a height of about five inches, and the lath then floated
about for more than a minute in this position, suspended in the air,
with no visible means of support. It moved sideways and waved gent-
ly up and down, just like a piece of wood on the top of small waves
of the sea. The lower end then gently sank till it touched the table
and the other end then followed.
Whilst we were all speaking about this wonderful exhibition of
force the lath began to move again, and rising up as it did at first,
it waved about in a somewhat similar manner. The startling novelty
of this movement having now worn off, we were all enabled to follow
248 JOHN E. COOVER
its motions with more accuracy. Mr. Home was sitting away from
the table at least three feet from the lath all this time; he was ap-
parently quite motionless, and his hands were tightly grasped, his
right by Mrs. Wr. Crookes and his left by Mrs. Wm. Crookes. Any
movement by his feet was impossible, as, owing to the large cage being
under the table, his legs were not able to be put beneath, but were
visible to those on each side of him. All the others had hold of hands.
As soon as this was over the following message was given :

This sample indicates that the "spirits" directed the seating, the
order of the phenomena, the time to produce the phenomena, and the
time to inspect the phenomena or read indicators. Looking over the
rest of the notes, the reader learns that they regulated the amount
of light. The behavior of the mahogany board was irregular, some-
times swaying sideways. And the experiments of a single type were
not generally repeated consecutively. Always much else went on:
movement of furniture, playing of accordion, passing flowers, clothing
tugged, and persons touched by a "spirit hand," elongation or levita-
tion of Home's body, movement of planchette, tumbling and ringing
of a bell, knotting of handkerchiefs, the jumping of the table in keep-
ing time with the accordion music, writing of messages on paper, the
movement of curtains, trembling of the table, heavy knockings, in-
numerable raps, and many "messages." In general, we have a mul-
tiplicity of phenomena produced in confusion,
6
very similar to those
Slade provided Zollner; and we know that Home kept up an in-
cessant chatter.7
Home was the only person free to move about.8

I am certain that in most cases, when Home was not in a trance, he knew
no more what was going to happen than did any one else present. Fre-
quently he was looking another way, engaged in animated conversation with
some one at his side, when the first movements took place, and his attention
had to be called to them like the rest of us. (Crookes, Jr. S.P.R., 6:343.)
7
He was an excellent raconteur, and by no means kept silent... General
Conversation was going on all the time, and on many occasions something on
the table had moved some time before Home was aware of it. We had to
draw his attention to such things far oftener than he drew our attention to
them. (Crookes, Jr. S.P.R., 6:343.)

For my part I was always allowed to move about and examine what wa
taking place as carefully as I liked. [After permission was granted?] All
that we were asked was that we should not move suddenly. This was liable
to stop the phenomena for a short time. (p. 343)

This sample indicates that the "spirits" directed the seating, the
order of the phenomena, the time to produce the phenomena, and the
time to inspect the phenomena or read indicators. Looking over the
rest of the notes, the reader learns that they regulated the amount
of light. The behavior of the mahogany board was irregular, some-
times swaying sideways. And the experiments of a single type were
not generally repeated consecutively. Always much else went on:
movement of furniture, playing of accordion, passing flowers, clothing
tugged, and person$ touched by a "spirit hand," elongation or levita-
tion of Home's body, movement of planchette, tumbling and ringing
of a bell, knotting of handkerchiefs, the jumping of the table in keep-
ing time with the accordion music, writing of messages on paper, the
movement of curtains, trembling of the table, heavy knockings, in-
numerable raps, and many "messages." In general, we have a mul-
tiplicity of phenomena produced in confusion,6 very similar to those
Slade provided Zollner; and we know that Home kept up an in-
cessant chatter.1 Home was the only person free to move about.8

'I am certain that in most cases, when Home was not in a trance, he knew
no more what was going to happen than did any one else present. Fre-
quently he was looking another way, engaged in animated conversation with
some one at his side, when the first movements took place, and his attention
had to be called to them like the rest of us. (Crookes, Jr. S.P.R., 6:343.)
1He waa an excellent raconteur, and by no means kept silent... General
conversation was going on all the time, and on many occasions something on
the table had moved aome time before Home waa aware of it. We had to
draw his attention to auch things far oftener than he drew our attention to
tllem. (Crookes, Jr. S.P.R., 6:343.)
1For my part I was always allowed to move about and examine what wa1
taking place as carefully as I liked. [After permission was granted?] All
that we were asked was that we should not move suddenly. This was liable
to stop the phenomena for a short time. (p. 343)

their extravagant evidence, such as the levitation of pianos, and said
that what the scientist yearns for is the exercise of a force of one-ten-

however, that if woven material instead of cardboard had been used
to protect the key, it could have been moved without interference
with the apparatus. Acting on the hint the experimenters prepared
for the next seance a new apparatus. Inside the cabinet was placed
a manometer a U-shaped tube of mercury with a floating pointer
which would automatically register any movements of the mercury
on a scale. The tube was in connection with a vessel full of water,
and closed with a rubber capsule. Pressure on the capsule would,
of course, force up the mercury in the tube. The vessel of water was
enclosed in a wooden box, the sides of which rose high above the cap-
sule. The top of the capsule was blackened. In place of a lid the
box was covered with cloth, so as to prevent pressure on the capsule
by normal means. At the close of the seance the mercury was found
to have risen; but the cloth covering was torn. (pp. 1 00-1 01 )

the temperature, and the atmospheric saturation were recorded. Sev-

commutator, a rubber ball in connection with a manometer were
placed on a table in the cabinet behind Eusapia, in connection with
automatic registering machinery in another room; and in the course
of the seance several movements were registered of which the tracings
are published. Other inexplicable phenomena were observed, such as
a mandolin moving about by itself on the table, whilst Eusapia's hands
lay in her lap. But again the only really conclusive test failed. A

They tested Eusapia's alleged power of affecting the balance with-
out touching it. At first a small machine, like a letter weigher, de-
signed by M. Yourievitch, was employed. It was surrounded with
a wooden frame, with linen or wooden panels to fit in the frame, so
as to prevent the use of a hair or other fraudulent device. Eusapia
tried it with the wooden covering and failed ; tried it with the linen
covering and failed ; tried it with the frame alone and failed. All the
protecting apparatus was then removed. Eusapia put her hands on
either side of the scale and it went down, and the onlookers could not
find out how it was done. Nothing daunted, M. Yourievitch then
procured a more delicate balance (pese-cocon) and surrounded it
with a panelled glass lantern. M. Yourievitch further isolated the
balance on a cake of wax, and put it in connection with a charged
electroscope, so that if Eusapia touched the balance the fraud would
be instantly detected. No result. All the glass panels were then
removed except the one next Eusapia. Still no result. The last panel
was then taken away, a handkerchief being placed over Eusapia's
mouth to prevent her breath affecting the sensitive balance. She
stretched out her hands as before, and once more the scale moved;
but the electroscope was not discharged. Twice more the same re-
sults followed. Then in consequence of some suspicious move-
ments observed by Madame Curie and another member of the Com-
mittee the light was raised (our first intimation that the previous
experiments took place in partial obscurity), and an arch of thick
wire was placed in front of the balance. The balance moved no
more, and Eusapia said she was tired.
Now, Madame Curie and her colleagues had suspected from the
position of Eusapia's hands that she might have effected the move-
ment by means of a fine thread, and in fact, on experimenting after-
wards, it was found that the scale could be depressed by means of
a hair without discharging the electroscope. After this experience
M. Yourievitch coated the scale with lamp-black, on which even the
pressure of a hair would leave a mark and the balance moved
no more.
They then tried again with the other balance, replacing the metal-
lic scale by a disc of paper in a wooden frame. If a pin were used,
the paper would be pierced ;
if a hair, it would crackle. In fact, the
balance moved once, when Eusapia's hands were held but the paper
crackled !
On another occasion Eusapia asked that her hands might be held,
and in this position she placed her hands on either side of the leaf
of an indiarubber plant, and the leaf was seen to move. Unfortunate-
ly for her she had forgotten her usual precaution ; an isolated observer

The "obstinate incredulity" of "official science" must be largely
attributed to the seance method of investigation to which metapsy-
chics has been almost wholly confined.
For three quarters of a century, evidence has been accumulating in
metapsychics, and many eminent scientists have contributed to this
evidence. The most constant factor in the investigations whether
by laymen, public committees, academic committees, metapsychists, or
scientists, during all this time, is the method of the seance. There is
no agreement upon the nature, or the description, of a single phe-
nomen in metapsychics; there is nothing constant in the "how" of
any of the phenomena. There is agreement only "that" phenomena
occur that no one can yet describe or explain. The full yield of the
seance method is the conviction in the minds of metapsychists that
unknown phenomena occur.
"Official science" without doubt will refuse to recognize even the
"fact" that the alleged phenomena occur until it is established by the
scientific method, which at the time of revealing the fact of occurrence
will also reveal something of the nature of the phenomena. The

The incredulity of the experimental psychologist is probably more
obstinate than that of his fellow scientists. All of these metapsychic
phenomena seem to be associated with the mind of a medium, and the
reports are dependent upon the mind of the observer. A large propor-
tion of the evidence offered for metapsychic phenomena can be im-
mediately written off in accordance with the psychology of deception
and the psychology of testimony. The liability of error in seance
observations is very great, much greater than is
generally granted.
An eminent scientist may be wrong in his observation, even re-
peatedly wrong, as Crookes certainly was, without being "either a
knave or a fool"; and to charge him with error, is by no means to
call him "either a liar or an imbecile."
The case and completeness of deception have been amply illustrated
by seances held for the purpose of studying the extent and nature of
mal-observation :
David J. Halstead, proprietor of the Syracuse Daily Courier, re-
ported to that paper what he saw at a sitting with Truesdell, a
prominent young businessman of Syracuse:
The table cloth was removed from the table ; upon the table were
placed a plain slate with a bit of pencil, and some writing paper also
with a bit of lead pencil. Two tureen covers were brought, one
placed over the slate, the other over the paper. A sitter went to
another room and wrote names of deceased persons on slips of paper
which he brought back tightly folded into pellets.
The medium placed these pellets to his forehead, and called out
signals at letter after letter, to be recorded, while the sitter repeated
the alphabet. In this way the name "Adelbert" was communicated.
The selected pellet was unfolded and revealed that name on it.
After writing-sounds, located under the tureen cover on the slate,
had ceased, the cover was removed and a message of twelve or more
lines, pertinent to the evening's experiment, was found on the slate,
and it was signed "Adelbert."
The medium rubbed his arm, rolled up his sleeve, and showed
glowing flesh upon which was recorded in pale skin the name
"Adelbert."
All occurred under full gas light (and by legerdemain), (pp.

mal-observation:
David J. Halstead, proprietor of the Syracuse Daily Courier, re-
ported to that paper what he saw at a sitting with Truesdell, a
prominent young businessman of Syracuse:
The table cloth was removed from the table; upon the table were
placed a plain slate with a bit of pencil, and some writing paper also
with a bit of lead pencil. Two tureen covers were brought, one
placed over the slate, the other over the paper. A sitter went to
another room and wrote names of deceased persons on slips of paper
which he brought back tightly folded into pellets.
The medium placed these pellets to his forehead, and called out
signals at letter after letter, to be recorded, while the sitter repeated
the alphabet. In this way the name "Adelbert" was communicated.
The selected pellet was unfolded and revealed that name on it.
After writing-sounds, located under the tureen cover on the slate,
had ceased, the cover was removed and a message of twelve or more
lines, pertinent to the evening's experiment, was found on the slate,
and it was signed "Adelbert."
The medium rubbed his arm, rolled up his sleeve, and showed
glowing flesh upon which was recorded in pale skin the name
"Adelbert."
All occurred under full gas light (and by legerdemain). (pp.

Mr. L. W. Chase, a spiritualist, reported to the Syracuse Daily
Courier, of December 7, 1872, the results of a sitting with Truesdell:
Chase went into an adjoining room to write down names of de-
ceased friends, on slips of paper to be folded into pellets. "On re-
entering the room he [T.] called out, "This is all fraud ; Caroline C.
is not dead, but your sister Charlotte is. If you wish to get anything
at all, you must deal honestly with me. . .
Imagine my chagrin. . .
I am entirely satisfied that no mortal eye save my own rested upon
the names I had written, and still held tightly folded in my hand,
nor did a live soul in the city of Syracuse know the relations of
these individuals to myself."
He received on the under surface of a slate lying on the table, in
the full glare of gaslight, a message: "My dear Brother: You strive
in vain to unlock the hidden mysteries of the future. No mortal
has faculties to comprehend infinity. Charlotte." The message was
characteristic of his sister, and the handwriting "so closely resembled
her's that, to my mind, there cannot be a shadow of doubt as to its
identity." He also received a message from his mother in her own
handwriting on a sheet of paper. The time is not far distant when
"to doubt upon this subject will not only evince greater credulity than
to believe, but will necessarily destroy all confidence in our senses."
"I think, Mr. Editor, if men of science are anxious to investigate
(in an honest manner) . . .here is an excellent opportunity. . ."
Mr. Chase was a stranger; he appeared to be an honest, earnest,
seeker after spiritual knowledge. He called upon Truesdell at the
moment the latter was closing his office for the day, and requested
and appointment for a sitting. Mr. Truesdell tried to dissuade him,
protesting that he was merely an amateur investigating for amuse-
ment and instruction, that all reports about him were greatly exag-
gerated, and that science would probably reveal the true origin of the
phenomena to be of a material, instead of a spiritual, nature. The
more he protested, the more earnestly Chase begged for a sitting,
and when Truesdell noticed the large diary in which Chase made
one or two memoranda, he reluctantly made an appointment for a
sitting in the evening at his home. Before they left the office, how-
ever, Truesdell turned on the draft of the coal-stove, compelling the
perspiring visitor to remove his overcoat, and examined that diary
and a letter from Chase's sister (while Chase was engaged with a
book in the adjoining room).
Truesdell explains the phenomena of the sitting at his home : The
ballots were exchanged for blanks by palming, and were read; the
message was prepared and the slate substituted ; the movement of the
slate was effected by a thread tied to a vest-button ;
the sound of the
writing was produced by the rubbing of a slate-pencil, held by silk
loops to the knee, against another pencil clamped to the flange of the
table, (pp. 184-203)

Richard Hodgson had some sittings with Eglinton, in 1884, and
endeavored to make detailed records of the phenomena. .For the first
time, he said, he appreciated the difficulties of observation and of re-
collection of such events; they seemed so great as to effectually pre-
vent a full and accurate description, (p. 382)
12
He arranged with
S. J. Davey to give seances to ascertain exactly how much reliance
could be placed upon the reports of even acute and intelligent ob-
servers.
Mr. Davey, who was first attracted to seance phenomena by re-
ports of Eglinton, was so amazed at the ease with which that medium
deceived his sitters that he set to work at seance technique to see how
much he could perform by legerdemain that would be recognized as
supernormal. Spiritist reports were soon so glowing that he was ac-
cepted as one of the great mediums. After the Hodgson-Davey in-
vestigation, Alfred Russell Wallace declared that the findings of that
investigation could not be accepted until it is proved that Davey is
not a genuine medium, pretending that he uses legerdemain.
The reports of seance phenomena produced by Davey were writ-
ten by educated and intelligent witnesses immediately after the seance.
A single small sample follows :
Mrs. Y.: This test seemed to me perfect. The slate was under
my own eye, on top of the table, the whole time, and either my
daughter's hand or my own was placed firmly upon it without the in-
termission of even a second; moreover, we closed and opened it our-
selves, (p. 44)
13
Nevertheless, the substitution occured, and Hodgson saw it. Hodg-
son also saw Davey write the message on the slate in the morning.
The results completely discredit the reliability of records of seance
phenomena, upon the grounds of mal-observation. In addition to
these illusions of perception, Hodgson emphasizes illusions of memory
which affect descriptions written weeks or months after the events.12
Henry Sidgwick and Mrs. Sidgwick's sister attended a seance by
Haxby, in 1878, and observed phenomena that created a complete
illusion of perception in Mr. X. :

he did then. I saw his arms plainly till he was right down on the floor.
Then he put up his hands to the cloth on his head bringing the part
hanging behind over the top and front, to hide the tiara, and then
pulled the whole off his head, the white cloth remaining as the last
bit of Abdullah for a few moments. I saw his hair plainly as the

were better than theirs in Paris.

Many illustrations of the illusion of memory may be found in the
literature. But three will be quoted. The first two relate to the
phenomena of D. D. Home.
Sir David Brewster. with Lord Brougham, attended a sitting with
Home in Cox's Hotel, in 1855. In his diary he recorded:
A small hand-bell was then laid down with its mouth on the carpet ;
and after lying for some time, it actually rang when nothing could
have touched it. The bell was then placed on the other side, and it
came over to me and placed itself in my hand . . . Could give no
explanation. . .
Four months later he wrote a letter to the Morning Advertiser,
October 12, 1855:
Round table covered with copious drapery beneath which nobody
was allowed to look. The spirits were powerless aboveboard. . . A
small hand-bell, to be rung by spirits, was placed on the ground near
my feet. I placed my feet round it in the form of an angle, to catch
any intrusive apparatus. The bell did not ring; but when taken to
a new place near Mr. Home's feet, it speedily came across and placed

An alternative explanation of the contrast between the two accounts
of the same phenomena, given above, is that, upon reflection, the sen-
sorial memory responsible for the first account was discredited. What-
ever the explanation, the reliability of testimony remains impaired.
In the "Researches," William Crookes reports the behavior of the
wooden lath as follows :
A small lath . . . moved across the table to me, in the light, and
delivered a message to me by tapping my hand; / repeating the al-
phabet, and the lath tapping me at the right letters. The other end
of the lath was resting on the table, some distance from Mr. Home's
hands.
The taps were so sharp and clear, and the lath was evidently so
well under the control of the invisible power which was governing
its movements, that I said, "Can the intelligence governing the mo-
tion of this lath change the character of the movements, and give me
a telegraphic message through the Morse alphabet by taps on my
hand?" (I have every reason to believe that the Morse code was
quite unknown to any other person present, and it was only imper-
fectly known to me.) Immediately I said this, the character of the
taps changed, and the message was continued in the way I had re-
quested. The letters were given too rapidly for me to do more than
catch a word here and there, and consequently I lost the message ; but
/ heard sufficient to convince me that there was a good Morse opera-
tor at the other end of the line, wherever that might be.

Crookes, in his "Notes" published eighteen years later, but recorded
on the spot, reported as follows :
The wooden lath now rose from the table and rested one end on
my knuckles, the other end being on the table. It then rose up and
tapped me several times. Questions which I put were answered
"Yes" or "No" in this manner. I said, "Do you know the Morse
alphabet?" "Yes." "Could you give me a message by it?" "Yes."
As soon as this was rapped out the lath commenced rapping my
knuckles in long and short taps, in a manner exactly resembling a
"Morse" message. My knowledge of the code and of reading by
sound is not sufficient to enable me to say positively that it was a
message; but it sounded exactly like one ; the long and short taps and
the pauses were exactly similar, and Mr. C. Giminghamt who has
practice with the Morse codet feels almost certain that it was so.

rail and gently, and as if in pain, sat down on the foot of the bed.

"I have only the Judge's judgment to get ready, and then I have
finished." As he did not come, she went up again, about a quarter to
one, to his room and peeped in, and thought she saw him writing, but
she did not disturb him. At half-past one she again went to him and
spoke to him at the door. As he didn't answer she thought he had
fallen asleep, so she went up to rouse him. To her horror he was
dead. On the floor was his note-book, which I have brought away.
She sent for the doctor, who arrived a little after two, and said he had
been dead, he concluded, about an hour.' I looked at the note-book.
There was the usual heading: 'In the Supreme Court, before the
Chief Judge: The Chief Judge gave judgment this morning in this
case to the following effect' and then followed a few lines of in-
decipherable shorthand.
"I sent for the magistrate who would act as coroner, and desired
him to examine Mr. 's wife and servants as to whether Mr.
had left his home or could possibly have left it without their knowl-
edge, between eleven and one on the previous night. The result of
the inquest showed he died of some form of heart disease, and had not
and could not have, left the house without the knowledge of at least
his wife, if not of the servants. Not wishing to air my 'spiritual ex-
perience' for the benefit of the press or the public, I kept the matter
at the time to myself, only mentioning it to my Puisne Judge and to
one or two friends ;
but when I got home to tiffin I asked my wife to
tell me as nearly as she could remember what I had said to her during
the night, and I made a brief note of her replies and of the facts."
[Lady Hornby has kindly confirmed the above facts to us, as far
as she was cognizant of them.]
"As I said then, so I say now I was not asleep, but wide awake.
After a lapse of nine years my memory is quite clear on the subject. I
have not the least doubt I saw the man have not the least doubt
that the conversation took place between us.
"I may add that I had examined the butler in the morning who
had given me back the MS. in the envelope when I weni to the
court after breakfast as to whether he had locked the door as usual,
and if anyone could have got in. He said that he had done every-
260 JOHN B. COOVER
trusion and for the .consideration I had always shown him and his
colleagues, opened the door, and went away. I looked at the clock; it
was on the stroke of half-past one."
(Lady Hornby awoke, thinking she had heard talking; and Iter
husband told her what had happened, and repeated the account when
dressing the next morning.)
"I went to court a little before ten. The usher came into my room
to robe me, when he said, 'A sad thing happened last night, sir. Poor
--was found dead in his room.' I said 'Bless my soull dear me!
What did he die of, and when?' 'Well, sir, it appeared he went up
to his room as usual at ten to work at his papers. His wife went up
about twelve to ask him when he would be ready for bed. He said,
"I have only the Judge's judgment to get ready, and then I have

A communication to the Nineteenth Century, November, 1884, by
Frederick H. Balfour, points out some discrepancies between the
above narrative and the facts :
1. The M is the Rev. Hugh Lang Nivens, editor of the Shang-
hai Courier. He died not at one in the morning but between eight
or nine a.m. after a good night's rest.
2. There was no Mrs. Hornby at that time. Sir Edmund's
second wife had died two years previously, and he did not marry
again till three months after the event.
3. No Inquest was ever held.
4. The story turns upon the judgment of a certain case to be de-
livered the next day, January 20, 1875. There is no record of any
such judgment.
Before printing the letter from Balfour, the Editors sent it to
Judge Hornby for his comment:
My vision "must have followed the death (some three months)
instead of synchronizing with it. At the same time this hypothesis
is quite contrary to the collection of the facts both in my own mind
and in Lady Hornby's mind. . . If I had not believed, as I still believe,
that every word of it [the story] was accurate, and that my memory
was to be relied on, I should not have even told it as a personal ex-
perience."
All these discrepancies are concordant with the results of psycho-
logical research on testimony, and are to be attributed to psycho-
logical law rather than to either dishonesty or culpable carelessness.
The readiness of metapsychists to rely upon observations of seance
phenomena, their insistence that illusion can be avoided, and their
quick condemnation of the competence of an observer who is tricked,
clearly indicate that they do not understand that error is inevitable.
Consequently the psychologist remains incredulous in the face of all
the accumulating "evidence."
Perception is not the photographic process the layman and element-
ary text-books take it to be. We do not perceive with our senses,

perience. A perception, we might say, is a process compounded of
sensation and imagination; it is the result of sensory impressions be-
ing assimilated by memorial material. The ratio between sensation
and imagination varies greatly in what we call perception, depending
upon the definiteness, of the sensory component and upon the definite-
ness, or readiness, of the memorial elements which is often re-
ferred to as "expectancy". When the sensorial component is definite
but overridden, illusions occur; when it is negligible, hallucinations
occur. Thus, perception is not different in its constitution from illu-
sions or hallucinations. The observer himself is unable to distinguish
the difference ;
nor can the trained observer in the psychological labora-
tory by introspection separate the memorial component from the sen-
sory component in a perception, so thoroughly fused are they in the
unitary psychical process.
The method of the seance is precisely adapted to produce illusions
and hallucinations, and it strains credulity to imagine that any trust-
worthy observations come from it. All of the evidence is suspect,
and no "sheaf of testimony" is more cogent than its weakest compo-
nent. The "fagot theory" is fallacious. It is not universally true
that "Where there is so much smoke, there must be some fire," for
the "smoke" may be but dust stirred up by artful deceivers for art-
less perceivers. It is useless to fagot seance evidence.
It thus becomes clear why evidence for phenomena observed under
seance conditions cannot be accepted by the experimental psychologist,
and why his refusal does not reflect upon the honesty or the general
scientific competence of the seance observer.
The disability of the evidence for metapsychic phenomena can be
removed only by the adoption of the laboratory method. That the
phenomena are extremely variable and difficult to control is no more
a reason for avoiding the scientific method in metapsychics than in
physiology or psychology where similar difficulties are met.
Memory is not the recovery of a block of experience that has lain
in a pigeonhole. Physical analogy is hopelessly inadequate to illustrate
the way the mind works. Memory is a process, and a process that
never repeats itself exactly. A block of experience has no more exist-
ence before it is recalled, than the North wind has in a calm, and can-
not be pigeon-holed. Its recollection is another mental process, a new
one in itself, reproducing elements identical or similar to the elements

istic, and is often very great. It is not so much of surprise, therefore,
that flagrant errors in testimony occur, as it is that conditions can be
devised by which testimony may be accurate. The method of ex-
periment in the laboratory provides these conditions by requiring the
record on the spot.
Perhaps another circumstance bearing upon the incredulity of the
psychologist should be given consideration. In the psychological
laboratory the study of mental processes, dependent upon an adult
person, is a cooperative enterprise. The experimenter and the ob-
server, when the information sought must be obtained by introspec-
tion, have each their definite respective parts to play. The experi-
menter and the subject, when the information sought is accessible to
the experimenter, must likewise assume their respective roles. In
either case, thorough understanding, and complete cooperation, are
essential.
Now, any record of seance phenomena reads like a contest between
the medium and the sitters. There is the matching of wits, with the
great advantage in favor of the medium, who retains control of the
phenomena. When scientific instruments are brought into the seance
room, they must first be "magnetized," and later they are almost
invariably misused, so that all crucial tests fail, and the investigators
are forced to return to the usual seance phenomena.
If the relation becomes experimenter and subject, and the experi-
menter retains control of the conditions of the experiment, the nature
of the phenomena need not depend upon the immediate control of
the medium's body. The use of scientific instruments will reveal the
exact relation of her body or her movements to the phenomena. And
should phenomena new to science appear, the conditions favoring them
could be determined, and headway could be made in the further study
of their nature and the laws governing them.
The use of the scientific method, and instruments of precision, does
not constitute a threat to the medium, as is sometimes intimated, and
neither she nor her manager should demur at their use. To do so
implies a fear lest the phenomena will be found to be normally pro-
duced. Sincerity on the part of those in charge of the phenomena
should inspire not only a willingness to cooperate in the only method
of research fitted to advance knowledge, but an earnest request to be
allowed to do so. This attitude would immediately disarm many
a priori critics, and recommend the medium to the psychologist as a
suitable subject for his laboratory.

TELEPATHY AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROBLEM
BY GARDNER MURPHY
The kind of experience commonly called "telepathy" forms a very
ancient problem. Herodotus tells of a case in which King Croesus
consulted the Delphic Oracle by messenger. The messenger is said to
have obtained from the Oracle an exact description of a complicated
act which the King had performed when alone. Classical and medi<
eval literature abound in alleged cases of the influence of one mind
upon another over long distances. In the eighteenth century Sweden-
borg attracted wide attention by his claims to knowledge of events
occurring at great distances, most famous is the case of his apparent
knowledge of the great Stockholm fire several hours before the fastest
messenger could bring news of it. Late in the same century Mesmer
and his followers claimed that their patients were capable of re-
ceiving impressions from their minds without any sensory communi-
cation. Three different committees, one in the late eighteenth cen-
tury and two early in the nineteenth, investigated the claims of the
Mesmerists; although one of the commissions reported favorably
upon the claims for telepathy and many similar marvels, the scientific
world remained unmoved.
The earliest serious experimental work is that of Sir William
Barrett in England in 1876, followed shortly by the investigations of
the English Society for Psychical Research during the 1880's, and
similar experiments at short and long distances on the continent and
in this country. Parallel to these experimental studies were two
large-scale investigations of so-called "spontaneous" cases. An il-
lustration will show my meaning.

(rightly) that he must have gone out on the lake for an early sail,
as it was so fine.
"I then fell asleep. At breakfast (half-past nine), Arthur came
in rather late, and I noticed he rather purposely sat farther away
from ne than usual, and every now and then put his pocket-hand-
kerchief furtively up to his lip, in the very way I had done. I said,.
'Arthur, why are you doing that?' and added a little anxiously, 'I
know you have hurt yourself 1 but I'll tell you why afterwards.'
He said, 'Well, when I was sailing, a sudden squall came, throwing
the tiller suddenly round, and it struck me a bad blow in the mouth,
under the upper lip, and it has been bleeding a good deal and won't
stop.' I then said, 'Have you any idea what o'clock it was when it

"I then told what had happened to me, much to his surprise, and
all who were with us at breakfast. It happened here about three
years ago at Brantwood, to me."1
Such cases, supported at least by evidence beyond the testimony
of the individual, have been published by the thousands. Several
statistical studies of such cases were early undertaken to compare the
frequency of such occurrences against the number to be expected by
mere coincidence. Although such studies seemed to show that ex-
planations in terms of "coincidence" are very hazardous, the data
did not attract wide attention and have in general been ignored by
science.

to be many times in excess of the number attributable to chance. Such
estimates, however, are of no great consequence, and we cannot tell
to what extent concurrent habits of thought or a common source may
be responsible for the similarities in the thoughts of the two. In the
second series their results are even more extraordinary than in the
first but with this peculiar variation : in many cases the receiver ob-
tained, not the impression upon which the sender was concentrating,
but details of her experience during the minutes or hours immediately
preceding the experiment. Among these are such specific ideas, for
example, as that of a little girl with her hair down her back, cutting
out scraps of paper. It mav be noted in passing that this tendency
to obtain items which are in the margin of consciousness, or which
have recently been in consciousness, instead of the one upon which
the sender has actually been concentrating, has been reported by a
host of investigators; at the same time, such allowances, of course,
make statistical computation even more difficult.
The most extraordinary experiment ever reported by serious inves-
tigators using the method just described is the following:

chosen was 8 :30 P. M. It so happened that during the day preceding
the experiment in question the receiver B told his friend C that an ex-
periment was to take place and that she might take part if she wished.
The sender, A, who was at a distance of several hundred miles, did
not, of course, know of C's participation. That evening A ate his din-
ner in a little Bohemian restaurant, and at the same table began, after
his meal, a game of chess. Please notice the circumstances of the game.
There were in the room three men at an adjoining table who were
talking loudly; they were eating roast capon with bread sauce. The
room had green hangings. In the next room some one was strumming
on the piano. At 8 :25 A suddenly recalled that the experiment was
due and hastily withdrew to a quiet place. Here at 8:30 he con-
centrated on a meaningless diagram. The impression received by C
in automatic writing included the following items: "Roast capon,
bread sauce, three men, much talk, green hangings, somebody strum-
ming." And with it was a criss-cross pattern more or less resembling
the chess-board. In the case of this experiment compared with items
obtained in a variety of others, it is evident that the results are scarce-
ly likely to be mere coincidences. This is a case in which the genuine-
ness of the telepathic phenomenon depends chiefly on the good faith

to be many times in excess of the number attributable to chance. Such
estimates, however, are of no great consequence, and we cannot tell
to what extent concurrent habits of thought or a common source may
be responsible for the similarities in the thoughts of the two. In the
second series their results are even more extraordinary than in the
first but with this peculiar variation :-in many cases the receiver ob-
tained, not the impression upon which the sender was concentrating,
but details of her experience during the minutes or hours immediately
preceding the experiment. Among these are such specific ideas, for
example, as that of a little girl with her hair down her back, cutting
out scraps of paper. It mav be noted in oassing: that this tendency
to obtain items which are in the margin of consciousness, or which
have recently been in consciousness, instead of the one upon which
the sender has actually been concentrating, has been reported by a
host of investigators; at the same time, such allowances, of course,
make statistical computation even more difficult.
The most extraordinary experiment ever reported by serious inves-
tigators using the method just described is the following:4 The hour

of the experimenters and authors, a point upon which no one at our
distance has the right to any positive opinion either pro or con.
It is evident from the Miles-Ramsden experiment, as well as from
the one just named, that we needed a type of material capable of ac-
curate statistical measurement, and a method which could be repeated
at will under controlled conditions, capable of observation by any
person properly equipped and willing to give the time. Several such
attempts have consequently been made. Of these, by far the most
extensive is that of Dr. Coover of Stanford University, whose re-
sults, contained in this series of papers, may speak for themselves.
My chief duty is to acquaint you with investigations which are much

International Congress of Psychical Research by Dr. Brugmans.

TELEPATHY AS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROBLEM 269
Two rooms in the university psychological laboratory were used, one
directly above the other. A hole was cut in the floor of the upper
room and two sheets of plate glass placed therein securely, with an
air cushion between. This made it possible to look from the upper
into the lower room. Nevertheless the experimenters report that no
voice could be heard in the lower room even when one was shouting
in the upper room. The three psychologists took turns in acting as
"sender". The materials to be transmitted consisted of letters and
numbers arranged on a board as indicated in Fig. 1.
In each experiment they drew from one bag a slip of paper determin-
ing which letter from A to H inclusive was to be used, and from
another bag another slip determining which number from 1 to 6 was
to be used. The two slips of paper together therefore designated one
specific square on the board containing 48 squares. In the room
below was a wooden frame-work covered with (Fig. 2) black cloth
on its upper and three lateral surfaces. The chair of the "receiver"
was placed so that his back was to the one open side. His right arm
extended through an opening so that the hand and a part of the fore-
arm were visible to the experimenters in the room above; the re-
ceiver himself could, of course, see nothing above him. In front of
the receiver's hand was the board just described. The purpose of the
experimenters was to force the subject by their own volition to move
his finger to the square which had been chosen by lot and upon which
they were concentrating their attention. The receiver's signal that
his choice had been made was a double tap with the forefinger upon
the board; thus, no premature termination of a given experiment
could result from excitement of the experimenters upon an apparent,
though spurious, success. Six experiments at a time were carried out.
The experimenters then came into the room in which the receiver
sat, and performed six experiments at close range, changing the posi-
tion of the board upon entering as well as upon leaving the room.
The latter precaution aimed at the elimination of mere "position
habits'
1
and also undertook to keep in the foreground the factor of
voluntary control of the hand by the experimenters, rather than the
mere attempt to induce imagery in the receiver's mind. Of 187
experiments conducted as just described, one in 48 or approximately
4 T
/2 in all should have been perfect successes according to the theory
of probability. Actually, the number of successes was 60. Curiously
enough^ 40% of the experiments between two rooms were complete
successes while only 30% of those in the same room were successful.

270 GARDNER MURPHY
The experiments hazard the conjecture that in the latter case the at-
tempt to be on their guard against unconscious whispering and the like
interfered with their concentration. Not only did they measure the
number of successes but the amount of deviation upon the board from
the correct square in the case of all errors, and found that the distribu-
tion of errors follows a normal probability curve, that is, that the
number of errors of a specific type decreases in accordance with the dis-
tance from the correct square. Two familiar ideas from the psychology
laboratory were introduced: one, the effect of drugs, the other, the
effect of relaxation. Alcohol was used in a few experiments and
seemed to have a markedly beneficial effect on the results; in fact of
the 29 experiments in which the receiver took 30 grams of alcohol ten
minutes before the experiment began, 22 were successful. Upon
this the investigators comment : "Alcohol overcomes the individual's
normal inhibitions. The decrease in self-consciousness and the ten-
dency to more superficial ideas are symptoms of this lack of inhibi-
tions." The subject's introspective report of "passivity or relaxation"
coincided also remarkably with his most successful reports; the psy-
cho-galvanic method gave results which seemed confirmatory to this
view.
Probably the most serious questions relating to technique in this
experiment have to do with the possibility of auditory hyperaesthesia
(a possibility not completely covered even by the precautions named),
and the remote possibility of reflections of light

In 1921 R. Warcollier published in Paris a comprehensive text on

statistical control, but some of the more striking cases are not thus

Warcollier's work continues and has gained steadily both in critical
spirit and in the accumulation of cooperating individuals in many
regions. In a recent pamphlet, an extraordinarily interesting case is
reported in which we are given the impressions of two senders in Paris
and one receiver in this country. The first two thought of a two-
handled loving cup, and a stag's antlers, respectively. The receiver
got the impression of a loving cup, the handles of which were in the
form of antlers. The receiver, who is well known to me, is an in-
dividual who has made much of the habit of putting herself volun-
tarily into those states of relaxation and mental passivity to which
Warcollier refers.
I may now briefly mention my own work, not because it contains
anything particularly novel, but because it is a part of a sequence in
which, as you will see, my successor has benefitted by my mistakes,
and has given American research in the field a much more satisfactory
character. From 1922 to 1925 I held the Hodgson Fellowship in
Psychical Research at Harvard. I devoted about fifty per cent of my
time during those years to the search for individuals who claimed to
have telepathic gifts, my theory being that such gifts, if genuine,
are rare, and that it is among those reporting extraordinary psychic
experiences that experimental results are most likely to be obtained.
A young woman in one of my graduate courses reported to me, for
example, the following case: She and a friend had made an ap-
pointment for 5 :30 one evening. She was late in starting down town
to meet her friend. In fact it was after five when she started into
the subway at 116th Street. As she went down the steps the idea
flashed into her mind that it was futile to go further, that her friend
was already on her way uptown, and that the only thing to do was
to go quickly to the corner of Riverside Drive and 122nd Street. She
tried to banish this absurd notion from her mind, feeling certain that
her friend was waiting down town for her; and again she proceeded
down the steps. A second time the idea flashed into her mind that
she must hurry over to Riverside Drive. Giving up all attempt at
rationality, she turned around and hurried to Riverside Drive and
122nd Street, where she met her friend descending from a Fifth
Avenue bus. It seemed to me that this was the kind of case that I
wanted to experiment with ; and we have therefore carried on a series
of experiments both at short and long range in which impressions of

all sorts, but especially geometrical figures of various shapes, have
been used.
Another case is that of a young man, a senior in college, who took
with me a general course in abnormal psychology. He asked me
after class the explanation of this experience : There had come sud-
denly into his mind early one morning a tune which he had not re-
cently heard, and of which, as far as he knew, he had not recently
been thinking. It seemed to him that a friend of his was playing
this tune ; he did not understand the reason for her choice, as he had
heard her play many other tunes more recently, and many were of
more emotional significance to her and to him. The hour of the im-
pression had been so early that the idea of her playing the piano at
that time seemed to him extremely improbable. It had turned out,
however, that she had arisen early on that day, had run through
some old music and had picked out the piece in question to play at
approximately the time he got the impression. Exact verification of
the time was, of course, not possible. I told him that I had no ex-
planation to offer, but that I should be interested to hear more about
it, and to know if he had had similar experiences. He came into
my office with me and told me the following incident. About two
years before he had been much interested in hypnotism, and in the
possibility of telepathy. One evening he made up his mind to try
the experiment of transmitting a mental command to a friend living
at another address in the same city. He concentrated upon the idea
that this friend must meet him at 9 o'clock the following morning at
a certain cross-roads outside of the city. It rained heavily the next
day, which happened to be a Sunday. There he waited at the cross-
roads; at 9 o'clock appeared his friend to meet him. She asked him
why he had made her come to that forlorn locality, particularly in
view of the fact that it was raining and that she would much have
liked to be on her way to church. He asked her what she meant by
her strange question, and she replied that she had had a dream the
night before in which he appeared, demanding that she should meet
him there at that hour. I asked him, of course, whether' they had
ever met at that place or at that hour, and he replied that both the
place and hour had been deliberately chosen among those least likely
to be thought of; that is, they had never been at the place together,
and they had never met at such an hour. As in the former instance,
the case is offered not as proving anything whatever, but simply as

and as a case which should be studied under experimental conditions,
where, if possible, we might ascertain the statistical as well as the
qualitative analysis of such happenings. This young man imme-
diately agreed to cooperate, and carried through a series of experi-
ments both with me and with the previous subject mentioned. In
the latter series some of his results at a distance of two miles from
the "sender" were quite extraordinary, but the series was too short
to permit conclusions of any kind, and he shortly afterwards graduated
and went into business outside of the city. I was much surprised and
pleased to get a note from him just the other day. He has returned
and we are again experimenting.
A third subject, a middle aged woman of refinement and educa-
tion, gave us also a good many hours for experiments with geomet-
rical figures, obtaining, under a variety of conditions, results which
I have not been able to explain. The great bulk of my telepathic work
has yielded results closely comparable to those of Dr. Coover; that is
to say, the vast majority of subjects give results which offer no dif-
ficulties of explanation in terms of coincidences. Some rather marked
exceptions remain unexplained.
A case which shows all the complexities and difficulties of investi-
gation is the experiment conducted by radio on March 2nd, 1924,
from the Zenith Station in Chicago. Professors Gault and English
cooperated with me in a simple plan to test out the ability of "listeners
in" to receive impressions upon which we three and a group of other
persons at the studio were concentrating. In each experiment the
audience were told the general nature of the stimulus, for example,
that it was a number or an animal, and that they were to try to get
the particular thing, the number or the particular animal. Over
2,500 persons mailed reports. With the exception of two individuals
there is not a case in which we really have any problem. In fact,
leaving aside these two persons we find that the results are a little
worse than chance would lead us to expect. All the stimuli were
chosen by a machine constructed on the principle of a triple roulette
wheel which is capable of picking out one of any thousand objects
numbered in accordance with the numbers on the machine.7
The
first seven experiments were as follows:
'Statistical computations arc, of course, quite involved, particularly in
view of the fact that some animals are better known than others, some

The variation in the kind of stimulus showed no clear results in
spite of the tradition in favor of emotionally stimulating objects; it
is enough to note that under the conditions stated none of the types
of material used had any measurable telepathic effect. There re-
mained, however, the two cases just referred to. One got a bizarre
impression agreeing rather strikingly with the experience of one of
the senders; the latter, instead of following directions, had tied a
string around the little finger of his left hand in experiment 5, and
had endeavored to convey the idea of dull throbbing in that member.
One report mentioned a dull throbbing in the left little finger. A
single case can of course lead to no conclusion. The other case was
of quite a different character. One individual mailed in results which
showed three complete and two partial successes in the experiments
described; she got, for example, the exact location of the pain which
was on the left palm about one-half inch below the base of the little
finger, and the impression of the drowning man. An empirical check
upon the likelihood of her getting her whole range of recorded suc-

As we had explained over the radio that our chief purpose was
not to prove anything but to enlist persons for further research un-

the young woman who mailed this report. She was quite willing

Her family became interested and three of them sent me at different

the problem in their own home. One of the most serious disap-
pointments in my three years' work in the field was that I was ill
at the very time that the experiments were to have been conducted,
and have never been able at any other time to arrange the long trip
necessary to the young woman's present home. But this case must
be seen through, and studied carefully before I shall ever be sat-
isfied.
I might summarize my approach, in such work as I was able to
do, by saying that for my own work I believed and still believe in
the necessity of taking particular individuals and duplicating as far
as possible the conditions under which they claim to have had such
experiences. The procedure should, I think, be gradually tightened
up so that one source of error after another is controlled. An at-
tempt to control all sources of error at the beginning is not only
futile because of the impossibility of foreseeing all sources of error,
but prejudicial to obtaining the kinds of occurrences that one is out
to observe. Tenseness, distrust, and apathy are but three of many
ways of becoming negatively conditioned to a long series of laboratory
experiments. I have found that I must search hard to find a sub-
ject who could get anything like consistent results under anything
like strict conditions, and in general that every resource must be
used to keep the experiment interesting, and the subject's co-operation
active, as one gradually molds the situation into that which one de-
sires for scientific purposes.
My successor at Harvard, Dr. G. H. Estabrooks, has improved
on my methods in several striking respects. First, he has chosen his
subjects in a radically different manner. Instead of selecting only a
few, he has rejected only those who could not or would not co-
operate, has taken graduate and undergraduate students by the
dozens, and many other individuals. He has found methods of
winning the confidence of his subject and of interesting him in his
task. The simple expedient of promising an exhibition of card tricks
proved to be successful bait with a large number of undergraduate
students who were taken just as they came. In view of the fact
that his work is soon to be published, I can refer to his work only
in a very general way. He made use of two rooms in the Harvard
laboratory which are separated by a heavy double door. An auto-
matic timing apparatus gives a signal upon which he cuts a pack of
cards and concentrates intensely upon the card chosen. The same
instrument causes the signal to be given in the other room in which

a card. The results, which will soon be available for you in tabular
form, show not only that great statistical difficulties would occur in
applying the usual explanation in terms of chance but that the re-
sults are extraordinarily consistent. The best results are in the first
five experiments with a given subject, the next best are in the next
five, and at about the fifteenth experiment the results drop to what
we should expect from chance. Statistical measure of chance is ap-
plied to color, suit and number. Consistently, the result from colors,
that is the choice of red or black, is enormously better than the result
from the suit or from the designation of the individual cards. It is
to be noted that although the rooms are soundproof in the popular
sense, Dr. Estabrooks himself points out that they are not so in any
strict sense and that the possibility of auditory hyperaesthesia has not
been completely excluded. In addition to his success in avoiding the
vast expenditure of time in selecting subjects, which has occupied
most previous researches, his method of intense concentration is ob
viously responsible for a great deal whether the results are genuinely
telepathic or not. Quantitative statements of this factor of concen-
tration are very difficult, but his entire two years' work taken to-
gether has given me, whenever I have had a chance to watch and
discuss his procedure, a consistent impression that he takes hold, so
to speak, of the subject matter upon which he is concentrating in a
way of which I am quite incapable. He, himself, makes no claims
as to the explanation of his results, and it would be even more pre-
mature for me to do so.
This then is a summary of a few of the experimental attacks on
our problem. How does the situation stand today and what are our
greatest needs? Perhaps the first necessity is the limitation of our
hypotheses to those factors in the situation which can profitably be
approached statistically or experimentally. A great deal of discus-
sion has been put forward arguing the a priori likelihood of telepathy
in view of a supposed analogy with wireless communication. This
doctrine goes back in fact to a famous address by Sir William
Crookes in which the term "brain waves" was used to name electro-
magnetic vibrations emitted in the process of thought. Suffice it to
say that we know nothing about such waves even in the simplest
cases, and even less as to the possibility of their being received and

rejected as a priori impossible on the grounds that it would appear
to conflict with certain assumptions as to the nature of mind and
body. If we face frankly the fact that we know nothing final about
the relation or relations obtaining between mind and body, it will
seem wiser to proceed on a purely inductive basis. The burden of
proof, to be sure, has always been upon those who assert that tele-
pathy exists, but the burden is a finite and not an infinite one. Long
ago Laplace laid down the simple principle that the amount of evi-
dence needed to convince us of a given event is proportional to the
a priori unlikelihood of its occurrence, adding that since no event is
infinitely unlikely, no phenomenon requires an infinite quantity of
proof. How much proof and of what quality, is for you to ascer-
tain by reading, by experiment, and by reflection.
Another urgent need is for a clearer distinction between laboratory
investigations of the type described, and the familiar practices of the
stage or the drawing-room, which go under the name of demonstra-
tions of telepathy. The number of secret codes used by professional
and semi-professional telepathists is legion, and as they are discov-
ered new ones are constantly invented. As I change the position of
my hands and feet, for example, I can signal to an accomplice in the
back of the room any number desired ; varying inflections of the voice
are equally suitable and in equally general use. Telescopes in the
roof, and hidden wiring under loose boards in the floor, are ancient
and familiar, but they never fail to produce the expected results in
a hall full of persons eager for a thrill. A mastery of the methods
of producing fraudulent telepathic phenomena would take a man's
entire time, assuming indeed that such mastery could ever be ob-
tained. The one thing necessary is the clear recognition that per-
formances in which arrangements are made beforehand by the profes-
sional and in which the scientist must observe as best he can, are
worth nothing whatever. He must, as always, follow a method in
which he can control the variables which are for him important,
and can gradually increase his mastery of these until he can produce
at will the phenomena whose nature he seeks to understand.
It is clear that nothing is gained by endeavoring to convince any-
one that telepathic phenomena are genuine. The only method of
convincing which is worth anything is the prosecution of more and
more careful experiments with a greater and greater variety of
methods, determining under what conditions results like those of

It is unfortunate that the issues involved in "Psychical Research,

The essential problems of Psychical Research and the contro-

in the several stages of their history reflect the animus of the period ;
but all have come through a long and laborious discipline to a strict-

ly objective animus free attitude. The geologist or the zoologist
has but the one purpose, to determine and he uses guesses or hy-
potheses in doing so how the earth was formed, or how the animal
life with which it is peopled arose, what is the structure, function,
mode of action of the inorganic and organic phenomena revealed to
an impartial yet discerning observation. If he has to meet to sup-
port or oppose let us say, a "fundamentalist" view, a special animus
may enter. The science of mind, though beset with peculiar diffi-
culties, shares with the other sciences the mode of approach to and
conquest of truth; it proceeds upon the same logic, and shares with
the rest the vicissitudes of the career of reason. It will appear in the
sequel that the investigations which some phases of "Psychical Re-
search" undertake might more appropriately be referred to the physi-
cist, others to the biologist, and only a portion to the psychologist,
were it not that the ramifications of the problems thus precipitated
almost invariably involve psychological considerations to account
either for their occurrence or for the belief in them. And the mind,
the instrument of our logical powers, is likewise the complicated
medium of our emotions, our desires, needs, motives, and their satis-
faction. Our logical procedures are saturated with the trends and
products of our psychological nature, and are often strangely shaped
by them. Such is the story of human behavior, mental behavior,
belief behavior more particularly, which is so essential to the under-
standing of "Psychical Research" and its animus. Yet the director
of our excursion and inquiry is logic, logic under the tutelage of
psychology.
A fundamental logical problem arises through the inherent en-
tanglement of fact and theory, of an observation and its interpreta-
tion. If these twin operations of the mental endowment had always
been clearly and correctly distinguished, the history of human think-
ing would be very different from the actual record. It may seem
derogatory to the intelligence of an audience or a reader to insist on
so elementary a point; but here is the parting of the ways. A slight
deviation in direction, when continued, may lead to widely separated,
wholly incompatible conclusions, to sober wisdom, or extravagant
folly, or if vertically extended, determine whether a building shall
stand or fall. Logic is likewise the plumb-line of science. C'est le
Premier pas qul coute would be a suitable motto for a constructive
Society for Psychical Research.

etiology of deception. In a familiar trick of the conjuring stage the
performer collects from among the audience a series of ringer rings,
hammers them flat, rams them into a pistol, which he fires at a box,
from which he in turn removes one box after another until in the
last box are found intact, and tied to decorative favors, the original
rings which he restores to their astonished owners. The technique
of the trick is that it is all done before the trick proper is staged : at
the instant of the magician's right about face to return to the stage,
the wand on which the rings have been collected changes hands, the
true rings remaining in the palm of the performer and the sham
ones flourished on the wand. The rest is mere camouflage to add
versimilitude to an otherwise improbable tale. A parallel bit of
sleight of mind is usually subtle than the sleight of hand. But
the clue lies in the elusiveness of the word fact, as in the natural or
naive assumption that the brass rings shown are the golden ones col-
lected. In sincere cases the deception, the substitution of a golden
inference for a brass fact, is perpetrated unwittingly by the per-
former upon himself. So before all and above all, let us not be

"Psychical Research" stands a varied assortment of facts; but what
the facts are is as integral and intricate part of the problem as what
they mean; fact and interpretation are fused in one reaction. So
we are led to the interesting inquiry as to how the human mind gets
its "facts". If there were a fact-getting department of the total
human equipment most fitly termed the psyche, and which does the
mental business of our busy world of behavior and ideas, and a
quite separately organized conclusion-drawing bureau, the attainment

simpler achievement than it actually is. The members of the logi-

chology of deception. In a familiar trick of the conjuring stage the
performer collects from among the audience a series of finger rings,
hammers them flat, rams them into a pistol, which he fires at a box,
from which he in turn removes one box after another until in the
last box are fo'und intact, and tied to decorative favors, the original
rings which he restores to their astonished owners. The technique
of the trick is that it is all done before the trick proper is staged: at
the instant of the magician's right about face to return to the stage,
the wand on which the rings have been collected changes hands, the
true rings remaining in the palm of the performer and the sham
ones flourished on the wand. The rest is mere camouflage to add
versimilitude to an otherwise improbable tale. A parallel bit of
sleight of mind is usually subtle than the sleight of hand. But
the clue lies in the elusiveness of the word fact, as in the natural or
naive assumption that the brass rings shown are the golden ones col-
lected. In sincere cases the deception, the substitution of a golden
inference for a brass fact, is perpetrated unwittingly by the per·
former upon himself. So before all and above all, let us not be
blinded by the word fact.

not so artless ; the mental adventure is not so simply conducted. Part
of that story may be recalled.
The first book, the Genesis, takes us to our anthropological past,
not exactly a garden of Eden, but a different version logical rather
than moralistic of the tale of the tree of knowledge and its fruits.
We may adopt the accredited terminology of our day. James gave
us the memorable phrase: the will to believe, which is the animus
of much primitive and not a little advanced thinking. In the quest
for knowledge homo however sapiens doesn't start from a neutral
zero; his mind is a belief-seeking rather than a fact-seeking appa-
ratus; he welcomes facts and finds them and makes them to bolster
his beliefs. His beliefs, like his prejudices, are determined by the
satisfaction they afford. This most significant principle, not un-
known to our historic philosophies, awaited our critical day for a
convincing, explicit formulation.
It is the principle that is embodied in the Freudian "wish". In
Freud's analysis of the sources of belief and behavior, he discovers
several mechanisms pertinent to the beliefs which Psychical Research
encounters and attempts to establish. The first of the relevant
Freudian principles is phantasy: the impressive observation that much
primitive thinking of the race, of the child, of the less rigidly tutored
adults in all classes, is imagining day-dreaming when frankly in-
dulged in richly sprinkled or saturated or encrusted with the pro-
ducts of the imagination, even when fairly rigorously conducted.
Its motive is expressed in the pleasure principle : that unless checked
by the harsh discipline of reality, we tend to believe what is pleasant
and consoling; in more complex minds, what is aesthetically appeal-
ing, interesting esoteric, even exotic. It is a natural and helpful
quality of our emotional mood; we hope for good fortune and pleas-
ant thrills, even while we fear bad fortune or ennui; otherwise we
should yield too readily to despair, fatalism, or pessimism, and the
edge of our endeavors would be too easily dulled, our outlook too
barren. The ignorance that is bliss is a rather primitive variety of
the happiness, for which we sophisticated heirs of all the ages turn
to the satisfactions of knowledge. Doubtless with the dissipation of
ignorance we sacrifice some of our blissful perquisites; for such is
the story of the tree of knowledge. Opposed to Freud's pleasure
principle is his reality principle. We are forced to make terms with

from "a seat at the Circus of the Intellect," would have made a
stronger case had he avoided the fallacy of indiscrimination the
usual trap for cynics or reminded himself that the obsequies of
grave scientists are not held at a circus; but that is a venial trans-
gression of logic or taste. In truth, thobbing abounds; but the
thobbing of the disciplined mind attempting the role of leadership
which attracts Mr. Ward's bludgeon, is of a finer texture and differ-

present a pre-logical stage of mentality. Not only are the "primitive's"
interests differently oriented, but the concepts by which he interprets
the world which to him is of his making as ours is of ours are
differently centered ; and consequently his beliefs move in a different
logical medium also they are directed by a different animus. In con-
trast to ours they lack objectivity. The part of a phenomenon to
adopt as neutral a word as is available which to him is a fact is to
us an alien, a crude and bizarre interpretation. There thus arises
a world that may be simply called a world of magic, an authentic
folk-lore product, attractively portrayed by Andrew Lang and Ed-
ward Clodd for ready understanding, and giving rise to an apprecia-
tion of the place of primitive mentality in our psychological age the
result of many contributions from master minds. Viewed from a
different approach it is a world of mysticism; under another shift of
perspective it becomes the occult world; under still another a world
of myth and fairy-tale; restrospectively from a mature sophisticated
outlook, a world of credulity or superstition. The constitution of
that world and the forces and types of ideas operative in it are for-
tunately familiar, for its products in the genera and species of belief
have never become extinct. They continue as survivals (an anthro-
pological term introduced by Tylor) and cluster about animism
(another term of Tylor's), which means that the forces of nature, the
happenings of our real and the primitive imaginary world are pat-
terned upon human emotions, beliefs, motives, and thus register the
naive psychology of the primitive man, seeing nature in his own image.

pseudo-scientific, or in (c) scientific (the term for the moment im-

term to the pre-logical and early logical stages and the medium^ the

drama, speak the folk-lore prologue to Psychical Research. Whether
we accept it as drama or as science or as religion, it has unmistakably
this genealogical or evolutionary affiliation.
It would take us too far afield to document this conclusion. What
must be made plain is that the "primitive mentality" and "folk-lore"
evidence establishes as a universal product of the human mind a psy-
chically animated, personally significant, occult world, bristling with
forces (in later stages calmly and objectively apportioned to the
several sciences) that must be faced, or appeased, or avoided, or con
stantly considered in the daily behavior, and which holds the clue of
cause and effect in regard to everything that occurs to man here
and hereafter. Charms and amulets, totems and taboos, fortune-
telling and auguries, the hidden arcana of nature in signs and sym-
bols, and the resulting paraphernalia of rites and ceremonies, grow out
of the common belief in some form of occultism, that underlies, inter-
penetrates, accompanies and reconstitutes and gives higher significance
to the practical world of occupation ; by its dominance it stands as an
obstacle to the discovery of material cause and effect in the natural-
istic scheme as we moderns know it so familiarly and dominantly.
The story of thinking is the story of the long struggle and slow
emergence of the single-threaded scientific view of things as they
present themselves to an objective observation, detached from a per-
sonalised interpretation of the meaning of events and forces.

It would likewise be worth while to consider the higher stages of
the development of occultism, as it survives or is revised in a cultural
stream of rich interests, and has in some measure absorbed and been
amalgamated with the scientific technique and products of a later
epoch. Such products we may call pseudo-science, prominent in the
mediaeval renaissance of earlier lores and knowledge searches and
researches which the true reconstructive logical renaissance had in
turn to encounter and displace. So obvious was the disparity, along
with the temptation to pursue both knowledges as a source of power,
that the distinction of white magic morally and logically accredited
and black magic, of diabolical repute was almost inevitable. If
we could turn back to the workshop of a Roger Bacon in fact and a
Dr. Faustus in fiction, we might be in doubt whether we were pro-
jected to a primitive laboratory or an occult mediumistic seance-
chamber. Some of the apparatus would suggest a physical experi-
ment and magic has been called the physics of the primitive mind
while other procedures would suggest esoteric invocations of super-
normal powers from another world, readily paralleled in their temper
in the naive annals of modern Spiritualism or in the gravely respect-
able proceedings of a reputable Society for Psychical Research. Nor
is this imaginative excursion quite unfounded; for of the Bacon of
the 13th (the unluckily numbered) century it is reported that he was
banished from England to a bookless and instrumentless prison in
France on a charge of black magic, for conducting an order of in-
quiry for which, had he lived in the days of the more pretentious but
less experimental Bacon of two centuries later, he might have been
honored as a pioneer in the cause of science. Yet neither Bacon was
free from credulity and an acceptance of terms for reality. The white
and black magics were construed as beneficent or malicious employ-
ment; yet science and occultism physics and magic find their com-
pleter contrast not alone in the morale of their employment but in
the objective spirit, and the animus of the pursuit even more than
in the procedures. Compensatory to the motto of the premier pas
qui coute would be en toutes choses il faut considerer le fin. The
Baconian purposes rise through and above their methods.
To make this reference more intelligible and concrete in its varied

is this imaginative excursion quite unfounded ; for of the Bacon of
the 13th (the unluckily numbered) century it is reported that he was
banished from England to a bookless and instrulllentless prison in
France on a charge of black magic, for conducting an order of in-
quiry for which, had he lived in the days of the more pretentious but
less experimental Bacon of two centuries later, he might have been
honored as a pioneer in the cause of science. Yet neither Bacon was
free from credulity and an acceptance of terms for reality. The white
and black magics were construed as beneficent or malicious employ-
ment; yet science and occultism-physics and magic-find their com-
pleter contrast not alone in the morale of their employment but in
the objective spirit, and the animus of the pursuit even oiore than
in the procedures. Compensatory to the motto of the premier pas
qui coute would be en toutes choses il faut considerer z, fin. The
Baconian purposes rise through and above their methods.
To make this reference more intelligible and concrete in its varied
pertinence to the problems of Psychical Research, we might recon·
sider alchemy for its lesson that a mixture of practical purpose, tech-

nical skill and appliances, and fanciful theory is as likely to be barren
in one application as in another. The Institute of Metapsychics at
Paris perhaps the most impressive home of Psychical Research of
today is not an alchemistic retreat; but most men of science would
feel as much out of place in the one as in the other, would regard
both as equally mistaken however sincere enterprises, mistaken in
logical foundations as well as in conception of purpose and in loyalty
to the spirit of science. Astrological beliefs have a wider survival or-
bit, yet have no more place in the present-day concerns of laymen and
scientists alike; they may be cited to recall the important logical
lesson that the interpretation of cosmic events for their personal sig-
nificance is an abomination (as James called it from a moral out-
look) or a perverse employment of knowledge from the logical as-
pect. The admonitions, premonitions, phantasms and the like that
figure in certain phases of the annals of Psychical Research are open
to the like condemnation. When we come to the arts of divination,
richly represented in the older occultism, in the mediaeval and later
revivals, and in Psychical Research, we may be dealing with the same
order of intellectualistic misemployment, or we may be on the track
of the genuine psychological problem of how subconscious mechanisms,
when ignored, or as yet undiscovered, support a belief in peculiarly
endowed individuals or systems of relation, which a rationalistic ex-
planation in involuntary movements founded on subconsciously reg-
istered indications, converts into an illuminating experiment an in-
troduction to "trance" psychology.
Trance states and automatisms when studied in a different temper
and interest make definite contributions to psychology. If we turn
to the history of mesmerism animal magnetism as Mesmer called it
we are again moving in the same realm of falsely assumed cosmic
powers, whereas the proper recognition of the induced states contri-
butes to a knowledge of the inner mechanisms of psychic response,
normal and abnormal. If we choose dreams and their interpretation,
we have a similar contrast of explanation from mystic or theosophic
or premonitional accounting to the truly psychological interpretations
of Freud and the Freudian school. Clairvoyance would serve as well
to indicate the range from the assumption of inspiration, transcendent
gifts, to mistaken and distorted evidence, an imperfect hold on the
logic of coincidence, and a general inexpertness in the handling of a
problem which in this instance is capable of a scientific test, when
conceived as telepathy, again but a name for an hypothesis. The

of abnormal psychology revealed to a belated enlightenment illumin-
ated the scattered sources of such abnormality in quite a different

which I am thus far pursuing.
To conclude, we may include what to omit would be to ignore
a most prominent example of the occult in operation, the doctrine of
witchcraft, a familiar folk-lore belief, usually quiescent but sporadic-

an enlightened New England. There is none of the phenomena in-
cluded in the categories of "Psychical Research" for which the evi-
dence is more abundant, versatile, and comprehensive than that for
witchcraft as a reality, and for specially endowed persons capable of
the practice. And yet there is no belief for which we have less in-
clination, despite the magnitude, the respectability, and the authen-
ticity of the evidence. It is to us sterile, and, except historically, un-
real, unattractive to our consideration, for the all sufficient reason that
in intellectual concept, in moral mood, in quality of evidence, it falls
completely out of the scheme of things, as we frame it. We can point
to no comprehensive investigation by which it was disproved, either
by a scientific commission of inquiry or a hospitably minded Society
for Psychical Research. It was simply outgrown, and does not de-
mand, as do other sets of belief not quite in the same class yet not
quite out of it, that still flourish and reappear in more modern setting
and consequently play a part in a controversial inquiry, sufficient im-
portance to be selected as the subject of a course of lectures in a pro-
gressive New England University. Witchcraft has been rationalised
out of existence; not so ectoplasm or telekinesis or cryptesthesia, all
more "classic" and laboratoryized hypotheses, which, to venture on

movement meet with the same fate. Let us add a concrete detail,
or two, which will once more set in clear relation the dividing line so

women, affirmed on oath that they had seen visiting the suspected
witch "A white thing in the likeness of a Cat, yet not altogether so
big, a white dog with some sandy spots and very short legs, and
Vinegar Tom, a greyhound with long legs", we must not go too far
in emphasizing the different play that we give to our imagination in
that age and in this. Beliefs create facts then and now; and when
the beliefs fade away the evidence ceases to occur. The specific evi-

status, the knowledge and the logic and the practical skill of the
believers. The moral holds, and that is the pertinent consideration.
Again, on the bodies of witches were found insensitive areas ; these
were pointed to as proof that a compact had been made with the
devil; for the seal of his power was the law-defying spots produced
by his touch. Pins to test these diabolical spots are exhibited in the
Salem museum. We now know that such anaesthetic spots occur in
hysterical cases. The fact was a real fact ; but what a painfully slow
and laborious course in rationalism the human race had to undergo,
what varieties of disciplines had to be cultivated, before the one type
of interpretation could give way to the other. From witchcraft to
hysteria (and shall I say from Salem to Worcester?) is a long, mo-
mentous journey through busy centuries; and the story may be read
in full historical perspective in Andrew D. White's monumental work.
The present citation is only by way of contrast of the "white" logic
of science and the "black" logic of the occult. Before considering the

it is indispensable to realise, fully, vividly, and concretely, just how
momentous is the issue at stake.

chical Research realizes definitely its obligation to the logic of science ;
it claims in its uppermost level of exposition a place for exceptional
phenomena under the same rigor of evidence, the same modus pro-
bandi by which have come the accredited findings of all science. From
that height it ranges down to a crude occultism, a nai've credulity, an
uncritical, autistic indulgence as much out of range of our scientific
prospect as the mediaeval or the primitive acceptance. In residential
status, it spreads from the most select purlieus of the intelligentsia to
the veriest slums of belief, where we shall not attempt to follow it.
The literature of the "occult" in all its ramifications would require
a vast library to house the printed records of its assertions, revelations,

to set forth the essence of the story in so far as it is still of interest and
still affects the beliefs of modern times; and a few feet would con-
tain all that were composed under the intention or the conviction of
loyalty to the logically evidential standards of our critical day. If
among these I select one that in such intention clearly stands in the
first rank, it would be the "Thirty Years of Psychical Research" of
Charles Richet, a physiologist of distinction, the holder of a Nobel
prize in science, honored in his years by the very colleagues who re-
pudiate sharply his very position, if indeed they take it seriously, in-
stead of viewing it with a mingling of respect, dismay, and amaze-
ment.
Certainly in opposing to the last ditch the conclusions and the
animus of Psychical Research I can do no less than select as its ex-
ponent the most favorable example of the position involved. I choose
the book of Richet because he so explicitly recognises the implication
of the entire movement; there is no question of compromise or eva-
sion. The issue remains steadily a question of truth or error, of the
most baffling truth ever vouchsafed to the mind of man, or of. the
most stupendous error; it is either the golden book of wisdom or the
dross record of folly. So decisive an issue is entitled to a new
terminology; the book is called a "Treatise on Metapsychics." It
heralds not only a new science, but marks the dividing line challeng-
ing all science. And all this is admitted by Richet, the convinced
advocate of the metapsychical world after thirty years of investiga-
tion, quite as readily as by myself, as equally convinced after a like

the one kind of a world which presents an orderly, logical, objective
system of events and the laws of their conditioning, from which
"metapsychics" is excluded and the seeming exceptions to normal
behavior of things the human powers, is to be otherwise accounted
for on a naturalistic basis ; or a world shot through or streaked with

equally obvious logical discrepancies and aberrations, equally gro-
tesque travesties of scientific procedure, equal credulities, could be

no rhyme or reason for raising the ancient issues in the terms of

system of events and the laws of their conditioning, from which

behavior of things the human powers, is to be otherwise accounted
for on a naturalistic basis; or a world shot through or streaked with

In these less than six hundred words from a book of more than six

principles of reasoning) to occupy a class of sophomores profitably and
with only an elementary depth of analysis for six hours, and a class
of graduate students prepared to enter into all the ramifications of
the logical intrigue for six weeks. With every desire to consider with
respect the arguments of a distinguished man of science, I cannot com-
ment in any other terms than those of complete amazement upon the
singular and naive lack of the logical flair, that measure of logical
penetration by no means uncommon in competent sophomores. I can
hardly bring myself to do more than ask a few doubtless disrespectful
questions. Is M. Richet by chance logic blind, as some otherwise
normal individuals are color blind? Is it possible that M. Richet
does not see that in crediting as facts the thousand and one things
that transcend the scientific experience, and which he admits are
wholly discredited by his scientific confreres, he is woefully begging
the question or befogging the issue? Is he unaware that he is as-
suming, inferring, conjecturing, asserting, imagining or thobbing the
theory that they are of supernormal origin? Is he unaware that
while professing to refrain from theories, he is none the less theorising,
subtly theorising, boldly theorising at every step? Unaware that the
metapsychic position is no less a theory, indeed a highly speculative
fantastic hypothesis, an extravagant conjecture, quite as much as the
theory of spirit agency which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle holds with
every defiance of elementary logic, but which Professor Richet regards
as a needless or unfounded theory in the special sense of a detailed
modus operandi or "mechanism" theory of how the effects are pro-
duced, but which effects he regards as of supernormal origin quite as

THB ANIMUS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH 299

values of theories in concept, in origin, in motivation, in intrinsic
probability, in defiance or conformity of established norms, in general
scientific status, and make clear that spirit belief or ectoplasm as a
metapsychic phenomenon is on the same illegitimate footing. It is the
animus of a theory that decides its even possible consideration. With
due apology an elementary illustration may be offered. In regard to
the theory of the planetary orbits Ptolemy was wrong and Copernicus
was right, and Kepler and Newton righter and later still; but they
were all considering an astronomical problem with the same animus,
which brings them in the same line of intellectual descent, the same
logical dynasty of science, the same loyalty to a scientific sovereignty
however expressed. But an astrologer of Ptolemy's day might have
been as well versed in the knowledge of the cosmos as was Ptolemy
and as well endowed in mind ; but he worked with a different animus
and thus belonged to a different logical allegiance; and the same is
true of an astrology indulging Copernicus or Kepler or Newton;
for it is true that some of their contemporaries of like animus were
forced by the very different animus of their day to cast horoscopes
for royal families in order to hold their positions, doubtless with a
regret that not the stars but the psychological animus of their day im-
posed this fate upon them. They kept their astronomy and their
astrology (so far as they had to give it shelter) in well separated com-
partments of their mental occupations. But how in the twentieth
century a professor of physiology can find a free hospitality for con-
cepts, theories, interpretations, which would so far delimit his chosen
domain as to render it nugatory, passes my limited understanding.
Perhaps this is not the effective approach. Should one stop or stoop
to question whether the story of the clairvoyant perception of the
Serbian tragedy from Paris to Belgrade would hold water under the
mildest shower of examination? Must one convict the believer of
the tale of hopeless credulity? Must one assume that Richet does
not know that Palladino was repeatedly caught in the act of lifting
the table telekinetically by the aid of her left leg and the broad flange
on her flexible shoes? Must men of science be versed in detective
craft? Sad queries these but inevitable ones, so long as the minds of
men are subject to the limitations of their total psychology, so long
as a few among the elect contribute observations and conclusions

Such, then, is the burden of my theme: the one critical aspect of
Psychical Research which I have selected for emphasis. For the rest
of the equally legitimate problems and inquiries that, I readily admit,
should be considered, I can only plead the limitations of time and
space. Yet in a sense, they are a matter of detail, of important de-
tail it may be. Had I a second essay at my disposal, I should willing-
ly meet the issue as a question of logical analysis or evidential value,

and with a critically negative verdict; and it re-
quired a considerable volume for only a portion of the task. Since
the days of his contribution the task has been made more complex by
the additional and remodelled claims advanced in recent years. All
I can do is to make plain what the nature of that task would be, what
kinds of considerations the logical and psychological student of "Psy-
chical Research" in the second quarter of the twentieth century
would be called upon to ponder and discuss.
The reference to Dr. Tuckett's volume gives occasion to indicate
the two standards of evidence naturally not unrelated, for all logic
is one commonly employed : evidence in the legal and in the scientific
sense; the former referring to the standards upon which we act in
adjusting justice, hence the practical temper, and the latter in ap-
praising the strength of conclusions, which in turn as clues alike to
belief and practice we must apply with some risk and in such venture
often find corroboration or disproof. Mr. Tucketts' critique applies
to both phases. He places certain conclusions on trial and indicates
the steps by which a verdict is reached and what it is. In the course
of the argument the testimony of science as an expert and the weak-
ness of the conclusions as scientific theories are laid bare. To follow
this phase would require an extension of the logical approach with
which I began ;
one could do justice to it only in an independent essay
which would form an interesting chapter in the story of thinking.
The one point I should single out for emphasis relates to the meaning
of fallacy in the light of psychology. For as Miss Bradby has set forth
with marked ability in a valuable volume that has by no means
received the attention it merits (M. K. Bradby: the Logic of the
Subconscious Mind) a fallacy is but the result of a psychological pre-
dilection which bends conclusions out of their orbit, towards beliefs
cherished by emotional, including aesthetic trends. Among such

of the several types of the mental make-up of the small group of men
of standing who subscribe, often with the passion of a devotee, to the
reality of the supernormal. Here lies the material for a worthwhile
psycho-biographical study; it would be a "psychological doctor look-

trail branches from it : The Scientific Bias Trail. To show how each
exponent follows the bent that has become his through special study
and interest in one and another of the scientific disciplines to which
he owes the guidance of his intellectual life ;
his attempt to maintain
or express his allegiance while in very fact repudiating it. (3) The

automatic mechanisms, interesting in their own right and readily
utilizable, if one is so minded, as evidence of the supernormal. They
shade over to the abnormal ; and it may or may not be wise to label
a special trail criss-crossing the others: (4) The Paranoiac Trail.
That some of the case-studies of believers, as well as the psychology
of mediums, offer approaches to or actual inclusions in the para-
noiac group, is unmistakable and significant. (5) The less well
blazed Trail of Logical Procedure, with again the sub-trail of Fraud
and another of Coincidence, which crosses or debouches into one or
another of those indicated. In view of the fact that the most as-
tounding conclusions are based upon performances that continue to
arise, here, there, and elsewhere, it seems to be necessary for some
one to formulate the logical conditions and criteria of evidence, in-
cluding again the exclusion of fraud and chance. (6) The Trail of
Subtle Residues. This is an open trail, the end of which is not in
sight. It is well not to be dogmatic or final. There may be ways
of indication, hints, and suggestions of sensory and perceptual type
as yet unexplored, but to be explored in naturalistic manner, that
may have a bearing upon apparent mind-reading and related phe-
nomena when chance and the recognized avenues of communication

automatic mechanisms, interesting in their own right and readily
utilizable, if one is so minded, as evidence of the supernormal. They
shade over to the abnormal; and it may or may not be wise to label
a special trail criss-crossing the others: (4). The Paranoiac Trail.
That some of the case-studies of believers, as well as the psychology
of mediums, offer approaches to or actual inclusions in the para-
noiac group, is unmistakable and significant. (5) The less well
blazed Trail of Logical Procedure, with again the sub-trail of Fraud
and another of Coincidence, which crosses or debouches into one or
another of those indicated. In view of the fact that the most as-
tounding conclusions are based upon performances that continue to
arise, here, there, and elsewhere, it seems to be necessary for some
one to formulate the logical conditions and criteria of evidence, in-
cluding again the exclusion of fraud and chance. (6) The Trail of
Subtle Residues. This is an open trail, the end of which is not in
sight. It is well not to be dogmatic or final. There may be ways
of indication, hints, and suggestions of sensory and perceptual type
as yet unexplored, but to be explored in naturalistic manner, that
may have a bearing upon apparent mind-reading and related phe-
nomena when chance and the recognized avenues of communication
have been given their due. This is not an open door to the super-
normal, but like trance-states, hyperresthesia, the processes of light-
ning calculators, and the subtleties of quasi-psychopathic diagnosis, a
domain in which a finer perception waits upon the offices of a su-
perior and but partly conscious logic. The common terminal of all
the trails is the rationalization of the (seemingly) occult. Only by

lie, even when they are precisely of the character that have been
proved fraudulent. He disregards the minutely circumstantial evi-
dence of photographic fraud in the spiritualistic camp, which Mr.
Prince has published after years of painstaking investigation; and
Mr. Prince, far from being hostile to the "supernormal" position, is
in so far sympathetic with Conan Doyle that he accepts as evi-
dences of supernormal phenomena the revelations of private and in-
accessible information through mediums and telepathists. Yet Mr.
Prince is prepared to repudiate the amazing conclusions of the
Society for the Study of Supernormal Photographs which Conan
Doyle has founded; and would regard with the same scepticism
Conan Doyle's conviction that fairies as well as spirits appear in
photographs, even when the fairy photographs show the marks of
the shears, consistent with the "Sherlock Holmes" conclusion that
they have been cut from photographic or other prints.

his continued confidence in distrusted and "exposed" mediums, and
such naive credulity need not detain us long.
The case of Maurice Mseterlinck is in a measure more engaging.
The fact that he is a man of letters and not of science is hardly
material since Robert Browning wrote "Sludge the Medium" as
a warning of suspicious fraud when some men of science of that
day were inclined to be impressed. Mseterlinck is not a spiritualist
only, but a miraculist. He collects miracles as others collect china
or pewter. Anything sufficiently improbable and law-defying and
interesting to believe he adds to his collection. He accepts mathe-
matical horses who actually spell out his name with a German title
by pawing with their hoofs. He assumes that, celebrity that he is,
he can go incognito to mediums who read from a letter requesting
his autograph the full, intimate details of his personality. This
transcendent or translucent feat inspires the following rhapsody:
"The sheet of paper handed to the psychometer and impregnated
with human 'fluid* contains, after the manner of some prodigiously
compressed gas, all the incessantly renewed, incessantly recurring
images that surround a person, all his past and perhaps his future,

likes and dislikes, all that is bathed in light and all that is plunged

The Maeterlinckian type of mind is presumably common, though
without the literary compensation. Its analysis would be interest-
ing; so also that of the variety of logical fallacies underlying these
cherished "arguments". They require (and furnish excellent ma-
terial to illustrate) the revised version of fallacies as illuminated by
psychology. The two largest sources derive from (1) the Freudian
psychology of the wish, the sub-conscious unavowed wish frequent-
ly, and from (2) the persistence of the primitive, which is more
common that the survival of the childish for the sufficient reason that
both the modern sophisticated and the primitive mind deal with the
adult perspective of feeling, thought, and motive. Thus, this notion
which Maeterlinck seizes from the floating mass of folk-lore belief,
and puts in literary form is none other than the "law of contact"
which Frazer formulates from primitive thinking: "That things
which have touched one another continue to have an effect on one
another"; and which Levy-Bruhl formulates more penetratingly in
enlarging and deepening it to the "law of participation", including
action and relation as well as appearance; or if we prefer a formu-
lation nearer to our day and folk-lore level, there is John Wesley's
description (1770) of the "Sympathy which is observed in things
distant from one another ... So nothing is more common than if
you throw a Mulberry or a Strawberry at a Woman with Child,
the Child has the Mark of the one or the other, on the same Part

Once more is illustrated how circumstantial is the "fact" that fol-

lows a belief. There were days and ways of thinking in which
Maeterlinck would not present the anomaly that he seems to a
twentieth century setting.
The case of Flammarion has affiliation with both the case studies
reviewed, but the training is so exact a science as astronomy turns
him to other analogies, while yet his collection of accredited tales
from all corners of the world and all sorts and conditions of be-
lievers is even more formidable. Many of them deal with appari-
tions and premonitions at critical moments, particularly that of
death.
"Without doubt our Psychic force gives birth to an ethereal
movement which is projected to a distance like all the vibrations of
ether and is felt by all brains in harmony with our own. The
transformation of a psychic action into an ethereal movement, and
back, may be similar to that which we observe in the telephone."
. . . "The action of one spirit on another, at a distance, especially
in such grave circumstances as that of death and in particular of
sudden death the transmission of thought, mental suggestion, com-
munication at a distance, are not more extraordinary than the action
of a magnet on iron, the attraction of the moon for the sea, the
carrying of the human voice by electricity, the discovery of the
chemical construction of a star through the analysis of its light, and
other marvels of contemporary science. Only these psychic trans-
missions are of a higher order and may set us on the road to knowl-
edge of the human being."
One wishes to be as respectful as one can. It may be true that
the undevout astronomer is mad, but the superstitious astronomer is
afflicted with a more serious mental defection. If one found such
arguments or thobbings in a dream-book prepared for the unedu-
cated or in the groping toward truth of an obscure fifteenth century
writer, or in the pages of an irresponsible faddist, they would seem
in place and negligible; but their provenance invites more serious
reflections. Enough to say that if the predecessors of M. Flam-
marion had indulged in such speculations and followed the animus
of his procedure, there never would have been telephones, or electro-
motors, or spectroscopes, or explanations of the tides. The two
worlds are aeons of culture apart; and the attempt to spin a spider-
web of tenuous analogy between them must be regarded as either
a puerile device or the despairing rationalization of a conscience-
stricken mind ; while the suggestion of "a higher order," like Richet's
assumption of a "rarer" knowledge, adds the insult of confusion, the

I must include M. Geley in the budget of "cases" not only as the
founder of the International Metapsychic Institute, but because he
introduces the biological concept. He centres his case upon ecto-
plasm and the notorious Eva C. from whose body seated in a dark
cabinet exudes "a plastic paste, a true protoplastic mass", "remark-
ably like that of the epiploon (caul)", the medium the while sigh-
ing and moaning "like a woman in childbirth", . . . "the substance
having immediate and irresistible tendency toward organization."
"In the more complete cases the materialised organ has all the ap-
pearance and biological function of a living organ. I have seen ad-
mirably modelled fingers, with their nails; I have seen complete
hands with bones and joints. I have seen a living head whose bones
I could feel, etc."
In brief here is meta-biology. The chrysalis acts like a dark
cabinet on the grub; the insect is rematerialised and is then re-ma-
terialised into the butterfly. Richet accepts the same flabbergasting
hypothesis and speaks of these ectoplastic products as forms of em-
bryogenesis, and actually records in sober narrative the appearance
of a living ectoplastic midget; while Flammarion, not to be outdone,
explains that "these ideoplastic materialisations demonstrate that the
living being can no longer be considered as a mere cellular complex.
It appears primarily as a dynamo-psychism, and the cellular complex
which is its body appears as the ideoplastic product of this dynamo
psychism. Thus the formations materialised in mediumistic seances
arise from the same biological process as normal birth. They are
neither more nor less miraculous or supernormal; they are equally
so. The same ideoplastic miracle makes the hands, the face, the vis-
cera, the tissues, and the entire organism of the foetus at the expense
of the maternal body, or the hands, or the face, or the entire organs
of a materialization."
It is in view of these excesses in the pronouncements of men of
science that I suggested the need of the paranoiac trail evident in
delusionary ravings of less learned but not more extravagant fol-
lowers who, lacking the stabliser of a scientific training, indulge
freely in romancing satisfactions of revelations from the beyond.
For good measure I add a citation from Dr. Boirac, Rector of the
University of Dijon :
"I place between the subject's hands the glass of water destined to
receive the exteriorisation of his nerve force. I take a second glass of
water destined to receive my own nerve force." . .

at both ends... The wire thus plays the part of a conductor be-

feeling the pain quite acutely." "The act of pulling my hair caused in
my subject a very painful sensation." "As I sipped a few drops of

The case of Dr. Crawford is most instructive. He is an engineer ;
his subject, the usual jeune femme of the drama, lifts a table and
performs similar feats of what Richet calls telekinesis; but the ex-
planation is that a psychic rod acting as a cantilever is exuded from
the body of the medium and lifts the table or makes raps; and by
adopting a code the "operators" (he does not like to call them
spirits) by taps assure Crawford that his theory is correct. Sir
Bryan Donkin, M.D., calls attention to the "superabundant expo-
sure of the massive credulity and total defect of logical power dis-
played by Dr. Crawford (who gives) the most pathetic picture of
a willing victim of pernicious deception." Dr. Crawford committed
suicide. After his death a further examination of the medium was
made by the translator of the sumptuous volume of Schrenck-Notzing
and Mme. Bisson, the sponsors of the ectoplastic performances of
Eva C., which the translator credits as genuine; contrary to expec-
tation he discovered definite evidence of fraud photographically docu-
mented. He agrees with a hostile critic that "the cantilever which
worked the experiments in Crawford's book was the leg of that
Irish medium." The minute detail of apparatus and all the para-
phernalia of an engineering experiment which fills the Crawford
books must ever remain an amazing document in the story of the
metapsychic. As proof of what prepossession can do to a trained
mind the case is invaluable.

each mind resorts to the legimate concepts of science, physical, bio-

question of why such experiments (?) are devised and the conclu-
sions advanced is more significant than are the details of how the
effect is actually produced. The "Case" trial, and the trail of
"Scientific Bias" appear clearly; and that of "Logical Procedure"
no less. As soon as one type of performance is exposed another ap-
pears; but the point emerges that if any such claim is to be met and
its examination conducted after the logical pattern of an experiment,
then the one supreme condition is that the experimenter and not the
medium shall control the conditions. That indispensable require-
ment is always evaded, though seemingly accepted. At the crudest
we are told that light is inimical to these occult forces; so the shelter
of darkness which nullifies the control is resorted to ; or if not that,
the screen of the table which conceals the modus operandi; or one is
forbidden to stand at the only place from which the operation could
be detected; and there are curtains and cabinets and holding of
hands, and clever tricks of release from apparent control, and rigid
examinations of the body which still leave a loophole of conceal-
ment; and ever the neglect of the observation that as such controls
are made rigid, the phenomena are curtailed, while the amazing per-
formances reported occur when such control is relaxed. Yet they
are recorded with the implication that the conditions of one seance,
which in results was substantially "negative", were observed at an-
other when the law-defying marvels appeared. The whole atmos-
phere of the conditions is repellent to the scientific mind, and the
time and patience expended in this pursuit by men whose training
and positions entitle them to protection from such service is by no
means a credit to the intelligence of our supposedly enlightened day.
All this may sound dogmatic, when reduced to such curtness of state-
ment ;
but the documentation is all too ample, and, to repeat, pathetic.

Naturally the more responsible advocates of "Psychical Research"
beliefs turn with greater confidence to the subjective aspect (in
Richet's sense) substantially the revelation of unknown facts, either
in a trance state or in a normal condition, by persons endowed with
peculiar powers. That we are here dealing with a different prob-
lem, I have made clear; though the possibilities of fraud and chance
have to be carefully considered. In this phase, also new devices have
been invented ; such as the "book-test" and the mental picture reading,

of darkness which nullifies the control is resorted to; or if not that,
the screen of the table which conceals the modus operandi; or one is
forbidden to stand at the only place from which the operation could
be detected; and there are curtains and cabinets and holding of
hands, and clever tricks of release from apparent control, and rigid
examinations of the body which still leave a loophole of conceal-
ment; and ever the neglect of the observation that as such controls
are made rigid, the phenomena are curtailed, while the amazing per-
formances reported occur when such control is relaxed. Yet they
are recorded with the implication that the conditions of one seance,
which in results was substantially "negative", were observed at an-
other when the law-defying marvels appeared. The whole atmos-
phere of the conditions is repellent to the scientific mind, and the
time and patience expended in this pursuit by men whose training
and positions entitle them to protection from such service is by no
means a credit to the intelligence of our supposedly enlightened day.
All this may sound dogmatic, when reduced to such curtness of state-
ment; but the documentation is all too ample, and, to repeat, pathetic.

Naturally the more responsible advocates of "Psychical Research"
beliefs tum with greater confidence to the subjective aspect (in
Richet's sense)--substantially the revelation of unknown facts, either
in a trance state or in a normal condition, by persons endowed with
peculiar powers. That we are here dealing with a different prob-
lem, I have made clear ; though the possibilities of fraud and chance
have to be carefully considered. In this phase, also new devices have
been invented; such as the "book-test" and the mental picture reading,
THE ANIMUS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH 309
which in one notable instance engages the attention of so dis-
tinguished a scholar as Gilbert Murray. The argument is complex
and may involve quasi-abnormal states on the one hand, and very
different logical problems on the other. The "book-test" consists in
having a medium indicate a page in a volume in a library which he
or she is supposed not to know, and then find the reference pecu-
liarly apt. It is a vague, inconclusive performance, and the possi-
bility of estimating the operation of coincidence is practically impos-
sible. Dr. Slosson had the happy idea of imitating the book-test
experiment without the aid of a medium, and by chance alone; and
found enough surprising pertinence in the passages thus selected to
convince one inclined to believe in a supernormal thought transfer-
ence of its reality; yet the resulting pertinence was pure chance.
While as to the Gilbert Murray mind reading, one can only say
that the clues may be lost in some cases, the experiment may be
loosely conducted in others, and the open possibilities that remain
await the ingenuity of further experimentation, though ever beset
with the uncertainty of how far our similar training and interests
and stock of knowledge may account for the measure of success in
transferring a picture from one mind to another. Subtle residues
remain ; but they do not alter the general verdict. If it is worth
while to do so, they can be followed too a clearer issue.
Perhaps I can suggest the order of incident and inquiry here per-
tinent, if I cite from the work of Jung, who has made a shrewd
and sympathetic study of the psychology of the medium from a legiti-
mate psychological and psychopathic position, the fact that Nietzsche
a distinctly psychopathic individual of rare endowment intro-
duces in his Zarathustra (1883) a rhapsodical story of men landing
on an island, shooting rabbits, and seeing men fly through the air,
which actually came from the log of the ship Sphinx (1686) as
recorded in Justinus Kerner's Blatter aus Prevorst which Nietzsche
read between the ages of twelve and fifteen but had not seen since.
Such subconscious memories for no one would suspect plagiarism
indicate similar mechanisms at work in minds of this order. To
Richet this would be a case of cryptomnesia paralleling his crypt-
aesthesia. It has a naturalistic explanation. Nor is it without in-
terest to note that when a classical scholar steeped in the allusions
and technique of the literary record, "telepaths", he reveals or "gets"
material in the dominant "medium" of his interests; when an archae-

shall be met with the rejoinder that I am proceeding eclectically and
dogmatically according to my own skeptical bias, rather than than
appraising the top-cream of the evidence which alone is convincing
to the critical Psychic Researcher, who is as ready as I am to
discard most of the bulky evidence as debris of primitive culture,
and its survivals in the credulous and unschooled of our day; when
it is not deliberate fraud which abounds and flourishes, as they
equally admit, under the stimulus of the belief in the occult and
the unusual, or the explanations are amenable to well known prin-
ciples of normal and abnormal psychology. But the residue, they
say, is genuine and cannot be discarded. Well! logic is against
them though with no finality, but with an overwhelming probability.
We are in face of what has been termed the great divergences, but
not as in the usual sense, of schools and "isms" with much in com-
mon in belief and animus, but with completely divergent views of
the lessons of science and the laws of reason.
If such admission of an open trail protects me from the one charge,
it remains only to meet the charge of eclecticism. It is easily done.
The argument as I have met it suggests the nursery refrain:

guilty of making statements which are not in accord with fact, or, to use
his own expression, "entirely untrue". He indicates that of all the hundred
photographs that were shown, there was only one which was questioned
and he withdrew it at the suggestion of Dr. Prince. I am assuming that
he is aware of Dr. Prince's article in the Scientific American for December,
1925, ifrwhich, for purposes of illustration, only a few of these photographs
are shown, but they are all questioned. In order that he should not mis-
understand my position which is equally the position of Dr. Walter Prince

who has examined more photographs of this kind than anyone else and
THE ANIMUS OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH 313
whose opinion is certainly not biased since he is inclined to accept other
explanations of the supernatural, I wish to say everyone of the photographs
offered by Sir Conan Doyle is spurious and has been produced by fraudu-
lent means. I am quite content to leave this phase of the matter to Sir
Arthur and Dr. Prince, as I am not concerned with it in my address except
so far as it indicates to what extent credulity will go, and in using this
expression, I am again in accord with Dr. Prince who uses it in the same
application.
With reference to the preposterous story about fairy photographs, there
may have been some slight misrepresentation in the report which appeared
in the newspaper, but it is not essential. Particular reference was to the
effect that these so-called fairy photographs were obviously either real
photographs which were set up in the grass, or pictures, and the mark of
the shears in cutting them out appears definitely. Dr. Prince, who has
examined them far more minutely than I have, agrees with this opinion.
Of course, without having the actual photographs one cannot form a definite
guess as to just how they have been manipulated, but to say that the pho-
tographs have met all criticism and the honesty of the young girls has
been vindicated, is completely misleading. The photographs have been re-
jected as ridiculous by almost everyone who has examined them; and, as
for the other question, the inference can be left to anyone's imagination.
Let me repeat that all this is quite indifferent to me except that it is
quite illustrative as to attitude of mind. There is one point worthy of
notice, the notion that I or anyone else would be interested in attacking
anyone or attempting even to persuade anyone who is inclined to take an
opposite view. This introduction of any personal attitude is extremely
unfortunate; and naturally anyone who appears publicly, will be judged
by his public statements. I have no desire to modify in any way^the use
of such a flagrant example of such extreme credulity as is shown in the
writings and public addresses of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
It may be of interest to him to learn that I was present at one of his New
York lectures as a representative of one of the large New York dailies.
They had sent a regular representative to report the address and asked me
as a special favor to report from the point of view of psychology. When
I made my report verbally to the editor, he agreed there was nothing in
the address worthy of attention and the reporter's report was all that was
required. He added that he did not want to be held accountable for any
further opinion of the author, who, in the literary field, commanded his
respect, as he does mine.

SLATE WRITING AND OTHER METHODS
A REMARKABLY large number of methods have been used at one
time and another by the numerous mediums of lesser repute than
Slade who prospered on slate writing. Slade himself, like any skilled
prestidigitator, had a variety of ways which he used to produce his
effects. His usual method was very simple. A common kitchen
table with the leaves extended was used, the Doctor being seated
at the end and the client on the side against the leaf, at the Doctor's
right.
After the slate had been thoroughly washed on both sides he
placed it under the leaf at the left of the sitter, holding it in posi-
tion with the fingers of his right hand, with his thumb above the
table. The sitter was requested to hold the left end of the slate
with one hand and with the other to grasp the Doctor's left hand
near the center of the table. In such a position it was impossible for
the sitter to see the slate or the fingers of the medium.
On the forefinger of his right hand Slade had a sort of thimble or
ring to which was attached a bit of slate pencil. With this he wrote
a short message on the bottom side of the slate, the scratching of the
pencil being quite audible to the sitter. When this scratching ceased
the Doctor would be seized with a series of nervous spasms during
which the slate was snatched from the sitter's hand for the fraction
of a second and, unknown to him, turned over, thus bringing the
message to the top so that when a few minutes later it was shown

slate was switched for one bearing a previously written message con-
cealed about a nearby piece of furniture. If a special message was
required it was written by an assistant listening in the next room.
When the slate had been cleaned ready for the message the Doctor
gave the cue and the assistant rapped on the door. The Doctor an-
swered the knock in person, taking the slate with him, and while
listening to some commonplace report the slates were exchanged. On
resuming his seat the slate was placed under the table leaf as before.
No sound of writing being heard, he would examine the top of the
slate several times but of course find no writing. Finally, claiming
that the influence did not seem powerful enough, he would lay the
slate on the top of the table, message side down with a piece of pencil
under it, and then take both the hands of the sitter in his. Soon a
sound of writing would be heard and on examination the message
would be found. It was possible for Slade to produce the sound of
writing while his hands were holding those of his client by slipping a
piece of pencil through threads on the side of his knee and rubbing it
against another piece held to the table leg by a wooden clip.
One of the most common methods of slate writing is known as
the "flap slate." The message is written beforehand and concealed
with a flap of silicated gauze, or thin slate, which fits closely within
the slate frame. One side of this flap is covered with cloth to match
that used on the top of the table and when it is dropped is unnoticed.
A better way is to cover the back of the flap with newspaper and by
dropping it on a newspaper it becomes invisible.
There is an ingenious double form of this flap slate with which it
is possible to make a message appear on both inside surfaces of a
pair of locked slates without having them leave the sight of the sitter
for an instant. The two slates are hinged together like the old-
fashioned school slates but with the hinges on the outside of the slates.
The slabs of slate are very thin and the ends of the frames bevel
toward them slightly. One end of each frame is so made that by
pressing on one of the hinge screws the frame end is released and can
be drawn out about a quarter of an inch. A very thin slab of slate
called the "flap is arranged to fit snugly over the real slate when the
frame ends are in place but drops out as soon as they are released and
drawn out. In working these slates the medium writes a message on
the inside of one of them, say the left and also on one side of the flap.
The end of the slate with the message is then drawn out and the flap
inserted, message side down, and the frame fastened back in place.

slate was switched for one bearing a previously written message con-
cealed about a nearby piece of furniture. If a special message was
required it was written by an assistant listening in the next room.
When the slate had been cleaned ready for the message the Doctor
gave the cue and the assistant rapped on the door. The Doctor an·
swered the knock in person, taking the slate with him, and while
listening to some commonplace report the slates were exchanged. On
resuming his seat the slate was placed under the table leaf as before.
No sound of writing being heard, he would examine the top of the
slate several times but of course find no writing. Finally, claiming
that the influence did not seem powerful enough, he would lay the
slate on the top of the table, message side down with a piece of pencil
under it, and then take both the hands of the sitter in his. Soon a
sound of writing would be heard and on examination the message
would be found. It was possible for Slade to produce the sound of
writing while his hands were holding those of his client by slipping a
piece of pencil through threads on the side of his knee and rubbing it
against another piece held to the table leg by a wooden clip.
One of the most common methods of slate writing is known as
the "flap slate." The message is written beforehand and concealed
with a flap of silicated gauze, or thin slate, which fits closely within
the slate frame. One side of this flap is covered with cloth to match
that used on the top of the table and when it is dropped is unnoticed.
A better way is to cover the back of the flap with newspaper and by
dropping it on a newspaper it becomes invisible.
There is an ingenious double form of this flap slate with ·which it
is possible to make a message appear on both inside surfaces of a
pair of locked slates without having them leave the sight of the sitter
for an instant. The two slates are hinged together like the old-
fashioned school slates but with the hinges on the outside of the slates.
The slabs of slate are very thin and the ends of the frames bevel
toward them slightly. One end of each frame is so made that by
pressing on one of the hinge screws the frame end is released and can
be drawn out about a quarter of an inch. A very thin slab of slate

frame ends are in place but drops out as soon as they are released and
drawn out. In working these slates the medium writes a message on
the inside of one of them, say the left and also on one side of the flap.
The end of the slate with the message is then drawn out and the flap
inserted, message side down, and the frame fastened back in place.
A MAGICIAN AMONG THE SPIRITS 317
A secret mark on the outside of the frame shows which slate is writ-
ten upon. The slates can then be shown and will appear clean on all
four sides, and it is possible to either seal or lock them without inter-
fering with the success of the demonstration. They are then placed
on the table with the fake ends nearest the medium and while he leans
on their ends with half-folded arms, engaging the sitter in conversa-
tion, he at the same time with the ringers of his concealed hand pulls
out the frame ends, allowing the flap to fall from one slate to the
other, and then secures it in place by putting the ends back. Of
course when the slates are opened a closely written message is
found on both.
Another sort of double slate intended for producing a similar effect
in dark seances or cabinet work also has a loose end which instead of
moving a quarter of an inch draws out to any length, bringing the
slab with it. After the lights are out or the cabinet closed it is an
easy matter to draw out the slab and write a message on it.

WJliTI:L:rG ON "HONEST SLATES" BY
MEANS OF WEDGE AXD WIRE.
Writing is sometimes produced between two perfectly honest slates

to its tip. By this means a message can be produced at a dark seance
in a few minutes without breaking the seals.
There is a form of slate where the slab is invisibly hinged on the
side so that it opens like a door and is held shut by a secret catch. This
slate can be used in a dark seance or under the table at a light one.
It can also be used on a cloth-top table with an invisible trap. The
trap and the hinged slate drop down together and the medium is able
to write on the slate by reaching under the table.
Still another scheme used with a pair of hinged slates is to have
a hole through both frames at one end and locking them with a pad-
lock. In working this the pins are pushed out of the hinges and the
frames, moving easily on the shackle of the padlock, permit the
medium to write on the inside of the slates without difficulty, after-
wards fastening the slates together again by simply replacing the pins
in the hinges.
A method of concealing an extra slate is to have it a trifle smaller
than the rest and then hidden in some convenient place, say the seat
of a chair. A large slate is first examined and laid on the chair.
Later it is picked up with the extra one under it. Sometimes the
extra one is hidden under the edge of a rug on the floor and worked
in the same way. At other times it is hidden on the medium's body
and slipped under a large slate when the medium stands with his right
side on a line with the sitter's vision.
An entirely different method is employed to some extent by me-
diums who are very rapid and interesting talkers. Throughout the
seance the medium walks nervously about the room, keeping up a
continual flow of conversation. He passes two slates to the sit-
ters for examination. A third, the same size, with a previously
written message on one side, being concealed in a large pocket
inside the breast of his coat. While the slates are being examined he
walks about the room sometimes behind and sometimes in front of the
sitter, tapping him on the shoulder to emphasize his remarks. As soon
as the slates are examined he takes them and, passing behind the sitter,
places them on his head and asks him to hold them there and at the
same time continuing his walk and talk. Of course when the slates
are examined there is a message on the inside of one of them. When
the medium steps behind the sitter with the slates in his hand he
quickly changes the slate with a message which he has hidden for one
of the blank ones. This is no more bold or difficult than many me-
diumistic tricks but it requires a particularly fluent conversationalist

to successfully produce the needed amount of misdirection when the
slates are switched. Women mediums effect a similar exchange some-
times by the aid of a special pocket in the dress.
A very effective method of getting a direct answer to a question on
the inside of a sealed double slate is as follows. The slates are tho-
roughly cleansed by the sitter, who writes a question on a slip of
paper, folds it and places it between the slates, with a bit of pencil.
The medium keeps at a distance during the writing and cannot see
what has been written. The slates are then sealed with strips of paper
and placed on the table and the sitter holds both hands of the medium.
After a time, as no sound of writing is heard, the medium shows
some concern as to the possibility of failure and suggests that the sit-
ter hold the slates at the top of his own head. Still there is no sound
and the slates are returned to the table, where they remain for some
time without any sign of writing. The medium becomes very much
worried and suggests that the slates be placed on the sitter's head
again, remarking that if no sound is heard he will be obliged to post-
pone that test till a future sitting. This time the writing is heard
almost as soon as the slates touch the head and when it ceases and the
slates are unsealed a complete answer is found written on the inner
surface of one or both slates.
This seeming marvel is produced in the following simple manner.
The medium's assistant steals into the room with a duplicate pair of
sealed slates and stands behind the sitter. In the act of placing the
slates on the head a switch is made, and the sitter holds the duplicates
while the originals are taken into an adjoining room by the assistant.
He lifts the seals with a hot table knife and after reading the question
he writes an appropriate answer, reseals the slates and returns to his
position behind the sitter. Another exchange is made when the slates
are placed on the sitter's head the second time. The sound of writing
is made by the medium under the table with a piece of slate pencil and
a bit of slate, but it is so faint that the sitter cannot locate it.
In Bohemia, Province of Prague, I ran across a medium who was
especially good in slate writing. At first I could not "get" his work.
When I was playing in Berlin, at the Wintergarten, he came in one
night and wanted to give a performance to the directors. I was guest
but went prepared for him. His work was so designed that he walked
behind us and in so doing he baffled me. I asked for a private sitting

almost imperceptible hesitation. In this fraction of a second the
slates were switched through a trap in the panel behind me. I had
a mirror on a rubber elastic fastened to my vest and as I took my seat
I pulled the elastic so I could sit on it. I managed ta secure this

slide open, the arm extended with the duplicate slates, and the ex-

S. S. Baldwin, an acknowledged expert in Spiritualistic and Tele-
pathic tomfoolery, was bamboozled by a Dr. Fair, according to his
own story which he told to me in December, 1920. He received
a message on a slate held by himself under a table, and afterwards,
at the suggestion of the Doctor, made a thorough examination of the
table, the room, and everything in sight, but failed to discover a con-
cealed door in the wainscot of the wall through which a man in black
garments could find his way to space under a sofa and thence to the
table, which was a rather large one, do the Spirit writing and then
make his exit while Mr. Baldwin was fully occupied holding the slate
under the table with his eyes fixed on space above it.
One of the very best mediumistic tricks, and one that has made
the reputation of more than one well-known medium, is done with
a number of small slates and one large one. The size of the slates
is immaterial but the large one should be three or four inches larger
each way than the others. The manner of presentation differs some-
what with different performers but in general is as follows.
When the sitters arrive the slates are piled near one corner of the
table, the larger one at the bottom and eight or nine smaller ones on
top of it. The medium stands at the end of the table nearest the
slates and after a few casual remarks he picks up the top slate with his
left hand, changes it to his right and passes it to the sitter to be ex-
amined and cleaned if desired. When he is quite satisfied the me-
dium takes it back, glances at both sides, and then places it on the
table directly in front of the sitter. This is repeated with the re-
maining small slates, which are not stacked up evenly but left in a
haphazard pile. While the last small slate is being placed on the
pile with the medium's right hand he picks up the large slate with his
left and rests it on top of the others, at the same time passing the

is at liberty to examine this slate also and to write his message on
either side.
The large slate is then placed at the right of the sitter and he is
asked to place his right hand on it. The small slates are then evened
up by the medium, secured by a heavy rubber band and then placed
in the center of the table. The medium then takes a seat at the
table opposite the sitter and they clasp hands at the sides of the slates.
After a sufficient pause the slates are unbound by the sitter and on
a slate near the center of the stack a message is found written in chalk
or slate pencil and signed by a departed friend.
The secret of this startling effect is extremely simple. Concealed
beneath the big slate at the beginning of the seance is a smaller slate
with the message already written on it. This is picked up with the
larger one when the latter is placed on the stack for the sitter to
write on it and dropped on the others, written side down. The extra
slate is never noticed as the pile has not been counted and the business
of passing the slate pencil occupies the sitter's attention so that he
does not realize that the large slate rests on the small ones before
he examines it.
The medium then takes about half the small slates, evens them up
and lays them to one side and repeats with the remaining ones, lay-
ing them evenly on the others. This is a perfectly natural move as
the whole stack makes more than a handful and by means of it the
slate with the message is placed in the middle of the stack. The stack
is then set on end, the rubber band placed around it, and it is then
ready to be placed in the middle of the table for conclusion of the
seance.
Two methods of writing between locked or sealed double slates
when only one or two words were needed puzzled the investigators
for a long time. The first was worked with a strong magnet. The
bit of slate pencil which was put between the slates was specially pre-
pared with either powdered soapstone mixed with iron filings, water,
and glue, or a small piece of iron was used covered with a paste of
soapstone, water, and mucilage. By holding the magnet under the
slates and tracing the words backwards the prepared pencils would
follow the magnet and write the words. The other method was
worked with an electro magnet set m the table, the necessary wires
running down one leg and making contact with a copper plate in the
floor under the rug by means of a sharp metal point on the end of
the leg.

Since the introduction of "raps"* by the Fox Sisters various meth-
ods have been devised for producing them. One of the simplest ex-
pedients is for the medium to slightly moisten the fingers and slide
them very gently on the top of the table. A little experimenting soon
shows the amount of pressure necessary to product the desired amount
of sound and of course the medium is cautious to let the fingers move
only the desired distance and that too when no one is looking.
Another simple method is to place the thumbs close together in
such a manner that the nail of one overlaps the other a trifle. Then
while the thumbs are pressed hard on the table if one nail is slipped
up or down distinct raps are produced which seem to come from the
top of the table.
Some mediums produce raps by slipping a knee up and down against
a table leg. Others have been known to fasten blocks of wood to
the knee under the skirt and rap on the table leg with a sidewise
motion of the knee. Still others strike the table leg with the heel of
the shoe or press the side of the heel against the table leg and by
moving the heel up and down the friction of the leather against the
wood produces raps.
Many mediums will not depend on these methods but use more
complicated ones which produce the raps by means of mechanical de-
vices which they conceal about their person. One of these consists of
a small hollow metal tube in which a long, heavy needle is arranged
to move up and down like a piston, and attached to it to operate it a
stout black thread. The tube is fastened to the inner side of a trouser
leg. The free end of the thread is brought out through a seam and
an inconspicuous little hook attached. After being seated at the seance
table the medium attaches the little hook to the opposite trouser leg
and draws on it until the needle point comes through the cloth. He
then watches an opportunity to press on to the point of the needle
a cork to which has been attached a piece of lead. This accomplished,
all he has to do is to place the knee in the proper relation to the table
and by moving the other back and forth the piston is made to work
up and down, causing the leaded cork to rap out all sorts of messages.
Another ingenious mechanical contrivance is built into the heel
of the medium's shoe and operated electrically by running a wire

back of the shoe and the foot and so on up the leg to batteries con-
cealed in a pocket. By placing this heel against a table leg the raps
can be made to sound as though coming from the middle of the table
and with a proper amount of "suggestion" the sitters can be made
to believe that the mysterious taps are produced in turn under each
pair of hands on the table.

can lift the table from the floor without difficulty. By slightly rock-
ing or tipping the table the medium and assistant can simultaneously
slip a foot under table legs diagonally opposite, lift the table and keep
it balanced by the pressure of the hands on its top. These and many
similar methods are perfectly practical in dark seances but for mani-
festations where there is any danger of the sitters being able to see
mechanical contrivances are resorted to. The oldest form is simply
a light, though powerfully strong, length of blue steel riveted to a
stout leather wrist strap. When not in use the whole thing is con-
cealed in the medium's sleeve. Sometimes both the medium and the
assistant are thus equipped.
This has been somewhat superseded by a chamois-covered flat steel
hook concealed under the vest and riveted to a tight-fitting leather
belt encircling the medium's body. With this hook under the table
edge great power can be exerted upon the table with very little strain
upon the operator. The lifting strength of a human hair is not
generally known, yet by means of one freshly taken from the head,
long enough to span a small light table, the table can be lifted. One
of the more modern contrivances is a steel belt which the operator
wears and to the front of which is attached a short metal arm which
can be engaged under the table top in such a way that the operator
can take his hands off the table and still support it in the air. When
releasing the table the metal arm is slipped back and the steel belt
shifted to another position on the body, the medium's coat concealing
both.
Just as advances are made in other lines of work, so too mediums
advance in their methods of deceiving their subjects. Few would re-
sort to the old-time methods of releasing a foot from under the foot
of an investigator. They have devised a new and baffling method.
The medium's shoes are especially made for her in such a way that by
a certain pressure on the sole it is possible to withdraw the greater
portion of the shoe with the foot from a false front. This front
is made of metal and padded. When the medium asks the committee
to place their feet on hers she makes sure that they do not overreach
the portion she can withdraw from. In the full glare of the light
the investigator thinks he feels the medium's foot securely held under
his own and as he cannot see under the table the medium has the
full use of her foot to produce manifestations.

the window and walked around on the wall and ceiling of the room
and then out of another window. The explanation is simple. On
the bill with me were two acrobats, hand to hand balancers. One
took off his shoes and stockings and the other sneaked up to him.
He pulled down the window and then did a hand-to-hand balance
with his partner and walked around the room. He then went back
to his seat, put on his shoes, and looked as innocent and meek as
possible under the circumstances when the lights were turned on.
I told every one present that it was only a trick but as usual they in-
sisted that I was a medium.
A rope trick which always causes astonishment and helps to create
a belief in supernatural aid is done by a woman medium who enters
a cabinet with a rope bound around her neck. The loose ends of the
rope are forced through opposite sides of the cabinet and held tightly
by two members of the committee. Nevertheless the manifestations
take place just the same and when the cabinet is opened afterwards
the medium is found bound just as she was before the seance. As a
matter of fact when the curtains have been closed and the committee
have a grip on the ends of the rope the medium cuts the specially tied
loop around her neck. When she is ready to come out she simply
ties another loop, using a duplicate piece of rope which she had con-
cealed on her person. When the committee release the ends of the
rope she slips the mutilated piece into her bloomers and appears with
the duplicate, which looks like the original one.
There are various methods of producing Spirit photographs. One
is to have a table prepared so that a developing pan is placed where
an X-ray penetrates to the negative. This produces a "Spirit light."
Another is to fix the side of the plate with some luminous substance,
shape, or flash, and it is astonishing what these things look like. You
get forms and frequently recognize faces in the splotches. Father de
Heredia has palmed a figure in his hand and as the investigator signed
the negative remarked: "I might as well sign it myself." In so do-
ing he rested the left hand over the plate while signing with his right
and the phosphorus figure in his hand was photographed on the neg-
ative. A simple method is to have something concealed in the hand
and hold it over the lens instead of a cap, and still another is to get
the camera out of focus and snap it secretly, then when the regular
exposure is made there is an additional hazy something on the plate.

shows the sitter finger prints of the departed soul. I hesitated at first
about including this fake, fearing to add to the stock of unscrupulous
mediums but I finally concluded that the public should know about
it. The scheme was first discovered by a sculptor who dabbled some
in Spiritualism. One day, several years ago, a workman fell from
the top of the building, in which this man had his studio, and was
killed. The body was carried into the studio and while alone with
it the sculptor conceived the idea of fooling some guests who were to
hold a seance that night. He hurriedly made a plaster of Paris
mould of the dead man's fingers and later filled it with a rubber-like
substance used in his work. When this had hardened and the plaster
had been removed it resembled, even to the most minute detail, the
dead hand.
During the seance that night he produced finger prints with it on
a trumpet which he had lampblacked and upon investigation it was
found that these finger prints corresponded exactly with those of the
man in the morgue. No one was able to explain the mystery and he
kept the secret for some time but later another medium learned it
and obtained a position in an undertaking establishment where he
found an opportunity after a while to secure the finger prints of
several of the dead who belonged to the wealthy class. In due time
he arranged seances with the relatives and convinced them of his
genuineness. There are two cases on record where fortunes were at
stake because of this sort of fraud. In one case five hundred thousand
dollars changed hands upon the recognition of the finger prints of a
man who had died two years before. His hand had been maimed in
an accident and all the scars showed in the impression on the Spirit
slate. Fortunately a confession was wrung from the medium and the
money went to the rightful heirs.
A "manifestation" which seems mysterious but which is in reality
ridiculously simple is worked as follows. A glass is filled with water
and placed on the table in a cabinet. Ribbons or bands of tape are
then drawn over it at right angles and the ends fastened to the table
with nails. Thus secured the glass cannot be lifted and the top is
entirely covered except some small openings. The medium is then
locked into the cabinet for a few minutes, during which he keeps up a
continuing clapping of his hands, but when the cabinet is unlocked the
glass is empty of water and the general impression is that the Spirits
drained it. As a matter of fact the medium had worked his hands up
near his face and shifted from slapping his hands to slapping his face

Of course these examples are only a few of the many means em-
ployed by mediums to produce their "manifestations" and take ad-
vantage of the credulity of the average sitter, but they are enough
to show the reader the sort of methods practiced and the lengths to
which they will go in their deceptions.

SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY
With what is perhaps pardonable pride we point to the genius of
American enterprise in scientific advancement but it is with decided
chagrin that I repeat that, as modern Spiritualism was born in
America, so also have been most of the phenomena that under the
mask of Spiritualism have unbalanced so many fine intellects the
world over. Spirit photography, the most prominent of mediumistic
phenomena, had its beginning in Boston, "Hub" of intellectual de-
velopment, its coming being announced by Dr. Gardner, a devout
Spiritualist, who discovered a photographer that "in taking a photo-
graph of himself, obtained on the same plate a likeness of a cousin dead
some twelve years before."
This was in 1862, but a little more than a decade after the original
demonstration of so-called Spirit power at Hydesville. Fortunately
for the success of the new art the photographer selected by the in-
habitants of "Summerland"* to use for the demonstration of the new
phenomena was a medium and of all the hosts in heaven the spirit
chosen to be photographed was (singular coincidence) a cousin of his
who had passed the border some years previous.
No sooner had the discovery been announced than spiritual en-
thusiasts in large numbers began flocking to the studio of the medium,
Mr. William H. Mumler, and this kept up until evil spirits (?) be-
gan to create an atmosphere of doubt and skepticism, whereupon he
abruptly took himself and his new enterprise to New York City, a
precipitous plunge presumably prompted by his Spiritual guides.
The change proved to be of great financial benefit to Mumler un-
til the ire of the evil Spirits was once more aroused and he was ar-
rested on a charge of fraudulent transactions. A most interesting and

sensational trial followed with many noted people appearing as wit-
nesses, among them being that prince of showmen, Phineas Taylor
Barnum, who testified for the prosecution, and Judge John W. Ed-
monds, of the Supreme Court Bench, for the defence.
Mr. Barnum testified to having spent much time and study in the
detection of humbugs and had recently written a book called "The
Humbugs of the World." He knew Mumler only through reputa-
tion but had had some correspondence with him in regard to his pic-
tures, wishing to learn his process and expose it in his book, and
some pictures which Mumler sent him Barnum paid ten dollars apiece
for and put in his museum labelled as
"
Spiritualistic Humbugs."
Barnum's testimony was attacked by Mumler's lawyer who char-
acterized it as being a 'Very pretty illustration of humbug" and added
that even if it were true Barnum violated the "great precept relating
to honor among thieves," but I want to go on record as believing that
Mr. Barnum told the truth in the Mumler case.
Judge Edmonds declared on the stand that he had seen Spirits al-
though many Spiritualists could not and recalled an instance when
he was on the bench trying a case in which the payment of an accident
insurance policy was the issue. He told the court that the whole as-
pect of the case was changed after he saw the spirit of the suicide and
several questions which this Spirit had suggested were put to the wit-
ness, the decision being reversed on the testimony thus brought out.
He also testified to his belief that Mumler's pictures were genuine
photographs of Spirits.
During the trial many methods* of producing Spirit "extras" were
shown in court by expert photographers and the possibilities of the
effect being produced by natural means proven. The investigators,
however, did not have their case in good shape. There were strong
grounds for suspicion but they were unable to present positive proof
and though the court was morally convinced that fraudulent methods
had been practiced sufficient evidence to convict Mumler was lacking.
Although acquitted, it is significant that Mumler refused an offer
of five hundred dollars to reproduce his pictures in another studio
under test conditions and while free to resume his business so far
*In those days there were no dry plates and with the old "wet" plates
it was quite possible to expose a plate, develop it, and then prepare it again

fleeced, he was nevertheless soon lost to view and seems to have
vanished entirely after the publication of his book in 1875.
Spiritualistic mediumship is not immune to the flattery of imitation
for even a casual examination of Spiritualistic history and develop-
ment shows that just as soon as a medium forms a new alliance with
the psychic power dispenser and produces phenomena unknown be-
fore, other mediums immediately begin to produce it also and the new
manifestation soon becomes epidemic. It was so with Spirit photo-
graphy. No one had thought of such a possibility before Mumler in-
vented the mystery but talented mediums everywhere when they heard
of his pictures began to produce them also. Stories of his success
crossed the sea and Europe discovered equal talent there.
In the summer of 1874 a Parisian photographer by the name of
Buguet went over to London and attracted considerable attention with
his Spirit pictures. They were of much higher artistic quality than
any preceding ones and Podmore in his "Modern Spiritualism" tells
us that :
"The Spirit faces were in most cases clearly defined, and were, in
fact, frequently recognized by the sitters, and even W. H. Harrison
failed to detect any trickery in the operation."
After a short stay during which his demonstrations completely satis-
fied such men as Rev. Stainton Moses, who was liberal with his en-
dorsements, Buguet returned to Paris, where the next year he was
placed under arrest "charged with the fraudulent manufacture of
Spirit photographs." Unlike Mumler, his conscience did not prove
court-proof, or perhaps the evidence against him was such that a
friendly Spirit advised confession, at any rate he told the court that
all of his Spirit photographs were the result of double exposure. On
the strength of this confession Buguet was convicted and sentenced to
one year of imprisonment and a fine of five hundred francs. A like
sentence was given to M. Leymaire, Editor of the Revue Spirits, who
admitted suggesting to Buguet that he should enter the field of Spirit
photography.
The police seized all the paraphernalia in the studio of Buguet and
took it to court. Amongst it was a lay figure and a large stock
of heads. These with dolls and assistants at the studio took turns as
inspirations for Spirit extras. But the real interest of the trial was
not these revelations, Podmore tells us, for after all Buguet did little
to improve on the methods inaugurated by his predecessors. It is the

effect produced on his dupes by Buguet's confession, and the display
of his trick apparatus, which is really worthy of attention. Witness af-
ter witness journalist, photographic expert, musician, merchant, man
of letters, optician, ex-professor of history, Colonel of Artillery, etc.,
etc. came forward to testify on behalf of the accused. Some had
watched the process throughout, and were satisfied that trickery had
not been practiced. Many had obtained on the plate unmistakable
portraits of those dear to them, and found it impossible to relinquish
their faith. One after another these witnesses were confronted with
Buguet, and heard him explain how the trick had been done. One
after another they left the witness-box, protesting that they could not
doubt the evidence of their own eyes. Here, chosen almost at random
from many similar accounts, is the testimony of M. Dessenon, pic-
ture-seller, aged fifty-five. After describing how he had obtained in
the first instance various figures which he could not recognize, he
continues :
"
'The portrait of my wife, which I had especially asked for, is
so like her that when I showed it to one of my relatives he exclaimed,
"It's my cousin 1"
"The Court: Was that chance, Buguet?'
"Buguet: 'Yes, pure chance. I had no photograph of Mme.
Dessenon/
"The Witness: 'My children, like myself, thought the likeness
perfect. When I showed them the picture they cried, "It's mama."
A very fortunate chance!. . . I am convinced it was my wife/,
"The Court: 'You see this doll and all the rest of the things?'
"The Witness: 'There is nothing there in the least like the pho-
tograph which I obtained/
"
Incidentally there were two or three curious bits of evidence on the
value of recognition as a test. A police officer stated that Buguet
showed him a portrait which had done duty as the sister of one sitter,
the mother of a second, and the friend of a third. Again, it came
out in the evidence that a very clearly defined head (reproduced as
an illustration to Stainton Moses' articles in Human Nature) which
had been claimed by M. Leymaire as the portrait of his almost life
long friend, M. Poiret, was recognized by another witness as an ex-
cellent likeness of his father-in-law, still living at Breux, and much
annoyed at his premature introduction to the Spirit world.

effect produced on his dupes by Buguet's confession, and the display
of his trick apparatus, which is really worthy of attention. Witness af-
ter witness--journalist, photographic expert, musician, merchant, man
of letters, optician, ex-professor of history, Colonel of Artillery, etc.,
etc.--came forward to testify on behalf of the accused. Some had
watched the process throughout, and were satisfied that trickery had
not been practiced. Many had obtained on the plate unmistakable
portraits of those dear to them, and found it impossible to relinquish
their faith. One after another these witnesses were confronted with
Buguet, and heard him explain how the trick had been done. One
after another they left the witness-box, protesting that they could not
doubt the evidence of their own eyes. Here, chosen almost at random
from many similar accounts, is the testimony of M. Dessenon, pic-
ture-seller, aged fifty-five. After describing how he had obtained in
the first instance various figures which he could not recognize, he
continues:-
" 'The portrait of my wife, which I had especially asked for, is
so like her that when I showed it to one of my relatives he exclaimed,
"It's my cousin I"
"The Court: 'Was that chance, Buguet?'
"Buguet: 'Yes, pure chance. I had no photograph of Mme.
Dessenon.'
"The Witness: 'My children, like myself, thought the likeness
perfect. When I showed them the picture they cried, "It's mama."
A very fortunate chanceI. . . I am convinced it was my wife.'.
"The Court: 'You see this doll and all the rest of the things?'
"The Witness: 'There is nothing there in the least like the pho-
tograph which I obtained.' "

numerable mediums have discovered that they possessed the same
phenomenal power for producing the coveted likeness in the form
of "extras" on the sensitized plate. The art has now advanced to
such a stage that it is no longer necessary for one to sit but all that is
needed is a relic of the departed one, something which either belonged
or was of especial interest, to the person. This relic is photographed
and when the plate is developed there appears beside it as an "extra"
the face of the departed ; that is, I should say, if your imagination is
strong enough to see a resemblance to the person supposed to be
represented.
Nor is a camera necessary in these days, according to Spiritualists.
In fact, I am told that it is not necessary to even open a box of plates,
but that they can be "magnetized" just as they come from the maker
provided the box is in the possession of the medium a few days in ad-
vance of the sitting. This single condition fulfilled and the demon-
stration will follow if the sitters, including the nearest relative, pile
their hands on top of the medium's. Then to create a solemn at-
mosphere the sitters are usually asked to join in some form of religious
devotion such as singing "Nearer, My God, to Thee," or a fervent
prayer.
This is the type of performance conducted by what is known as the
"Crewe Photographers" and supported and defended by the present
day leaders in Spiritualism. This Crewe combination of photograph-
ers is under the management of professional Spiritualists and is an or-
ganized effort to promulgate this particular phase of Spiritualistic
phenomena. The group consists of Mr. William Hope and Mrs.
Buxton, Crewe; Mrs. Deane of London; and Mr. Vearncombe
of Bridgewater.
My friend, Harry Price, attended a sitting given by Hope and
tells of the religious exercises as follows:
"Mrs. Buxton sang several verses of 'Nearer, My God, to Thee/
after which Mr. Hope made a long impromptu prayer in which he
thanked God for all our many mercies, and hoped He would continue
His blessings at the present moment. He also craved blessings on
our fellow creatures and friends on the other side and asked assistance
in the attempt to link up with them, etc. Then Mrs. Buxton sang
another hymn, after which Mr. Hope picked up the package of dry
plates, put them between the hands of Mrs. Buxton, placed her hands
on his, and others in the party piled their hands on top. Then we had

Can one imagine a sacrilege more revolting than singing hymns,
saying prayers, and calling on the Almighty for help in such fraud-

The combination evaded detection and were doing a most success-
ful business when in the spring of 1921, Mr. Edward Bush, of the
Society of Psychical Research, laid a snare into which Hope walked
with his eyes wide open. Mr. Bush wrote for an appointment under
the assumed name of "D. Wood," enclosing a photograph of a son-
in-law who was alive. On the back of the photograph was written :
"Tell Dad, if anything happens to me, I will try and let him have
a Spirit Photo. Tell him to shout up to let me know where he goes to.
"JACK ACKROYD."
Hope arranged a time for a sitting but returned the photo, saying
he regretted that it had been sent as it subjected him to suspicion.
When the time for the sitting arrived Hope went under control and
Mr. Bush manipulated the plates as he directed but no "extras'* ap-
peared. On the next day, however, when the plate was developed
after another sitting, there was an "extra" which proved to be a like-
ness of the son-in-law. Mr. Bush published the details of this ex-
posure in a pamphlet and the London Truth said editorially:
"But not only have William Hope and his sister medium, Mrs.
Buxton, cause to kick themselves at Mr. Bush's exposure, Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle,* Lady Glenconner, the Rev. Walter Wynn, and many
other leading lights of the movement have brought these products of
faith and hope forward as conclusive proof of the continuation of
existence and the possibility of communication with the next world."

tific nature for the purpose of ascertaining the value of these Spirit
phenomena." Mr. Mitchell was a photographer and wished to use
his own plates in the experiment but Mrs. Deane, who was to con-
duct it, refused to let him unless he first left them with her for a few
days to be magnetized. He objected to this and it was finally agreed
that he could use his own plates provided he would magnetize them
himself but the results were unsatisfactory. He then purchased
from Mrs. Deane a package of fresh plates, which, it was claimed,
had not been opened since it left the manufacturer. The likeness of
a soldier appeared on one of these which Mr. Mitchell developed him-
self and he concluded that not only had the plates been "magnetized"
but that they had been exposed in a camera as well.
The issue of Truth for June 28th, 1922, gives an account of the
experience of an ex-Indian missionary, who, with three others, visited
the Crewe photographers and sat for Spirit pictures. Four exposures
were made and Spirit "extras" appeared on two of the plates but the
men could not remember whether the plates had at any time been be-
yond their control so the missionary arranged for another sitting
taking the precaution to have his plates marked on the corner with
a glazier's diamond. At this second sitting one Spirit extra was pro-
duced but there was no diamond mark on the plate, positive proof that
an exchange had been effected.
During 1922 the Occult Committee of the Magic Circle took up
the investigation of Spirit photography first giving its attention to
Mr. Vearncombe who produced Spirit extras in connection with some
object once in possession of the deceased. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
put this committee in touch with the Honorary Secretary of the
Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures, Mr. Barlow, and at
the latter's suggestion sent him an unopened package of plates for
Mr. Vearncombe. Although Barlow objected, "for Vearncombe's
satisfaction, though not essential," the package was enclosed in a lead
case. Also at Barlow's suggestion a fee accompanied the package.
After a month of waiting the committee received a photograph of the
package and on the photograph was a spirit message which read:
"Barred your side."
In order to remove the barrier a fresh package of plates was for-
warded to Vearncombe, this time in an ordinary wrapper. Some
months later, after the plates had been Spiritually treated by Vearn-
combe, they were returned to the committee. When developed "psy-

combe, they were returned to the committee. When developed "psy-
chic extras" were found on two plates. There was evidence that the
334 HARRY HOUDINI
package had been tampered with and the same spirit had been seen
on other photographs.
The committee sent Vearncombe a package of plates under an as-
sumed name but received word from him that it was not necessary
to send plates. That small objects which had belonged to the deceased
would do and that if the proper fee were enclosed photographic prints
showing the "psychic extras" obtained would be supplied. As a full
compliance with this suggestion would have been useless as a test, a
box of plates, a small object supposed to have belonged to the deceased,
and the fee were sent.
Again Vearncombe protested that he did not treat unopened boxes
of plates owing to many failures but offered to expose plates on the
object which had been supplied. He was informed that such ex-
posure would be unsatisfactory whereupon rather than disappoint his
correspondent, he consented and forwarded the package with the
statement that he had treated the plates as desired and hoped for
success. On development a "psychic image" appeared on one of the
plates but the committee found that the wrappers of the package had
been unsealed and the plates disturbed in their arrangement.
In order to clinch the results of their trapping Vearncombe was in-
formed that the experiment had been a "success" but in order to "avoid
criticism" he was asked for an assurance that the package had not
been tampered with. It soon came in the form of a written state-
ment that the package had been treated by him and returned to the
sender as originally sealed when he received it.
The committee had arranged fourteen tests, twelve of which had
been violated, and as two or three violations would have been sufficient
evidence of fraud it did not consider more necessary but reported that
it had been established by the evidence that fraud-proof packages pro-
duced no results whereas it found "Spirit extras" in packages which
had been tampered with and that "collectively the result is damning."
The committee next directed its attention to Mrs. Deane who, be-
cause of "complications from annoying sitters," had given up private
practice at her residence and was working under engagement with the
British College of Psychic Science. The Principal of the College,
Mr. McKenzie, had vouched for her as being absolutely conscientious
and straightforward in her work and one fully qualified to produce
"psychic extras without resort to trickery." Mr. Harry Price and
Mr. Seymour negotiated for a private sitting with her. She required
that sealed plates should be sent several days in advance for "mag-

netization." Six plates were exposed at the sitting and on most of
them "extras** appeared, but evidence was obtained that the package
had been opened previous to the sitting and the plates treated but there
had been no substitution of plates.
An effort was made to get more convincing evidence and after
considerable difficulty a second sitting was arranged for. This time
the committee went to a manufacturer, whose plates had been men-
tioned by the college people as being preferable, and had a special
package made up and sealed. In this package each plate was so
marked that substitution or manipulation were sure to be revealed.
It was simply fraud-proof.
At the sitting the regular prayer and hymn singing were conducted
as usual after which the plates were exposed and developed. It was
found that the package had been opened previously, the top plate re-
moved and another substituted for it and on this substituted plate,
only, there was a "Spirit extra.*' At a third sitting a fresh box of se-
cretly marked plates was opened in the presence of Mrs. Deane.
Four plates were loaded into as many separate slides and Mrs. Deane
carried them into the adjoining studio. On a table in the studio was a
hand-bag and beside it a hymn book. The hand in which she held
the four slides momentarily disappeared inside the bag while at the
same time she picked up the hymn book with her other hand. With
the hymn book she had picked up a duplicate slide which, with a per-
fectly natural movement, she added to the three in her other hand one
of the four marked plates having been dropped in the bag where it
was found later by one of the investigators who examined the bag ,
while Mrs. Deane was absent for a moment.
Following the customary religious service the four plates were
exposed and then developed. Three plates which had the identifying
marks had no Spirit extra, but the fourth plate which had no iden-
tification mark did have a Spirit form.
As a result of this investigation the committee found that when-
ever there was an opportunity packages were opened and treated,
plates substituted, and in the tests which followed "Spirit extras*'
were secured, but when the conditions were absolutely fraud-proof
there were no "extras,** and so far as it was able to discover all the
so-called Spirit photography rested on the flimsy foundation of fraud.

I then got in touch with a friend of mine by the name of DeVega*
who lives in Glasgow and asked him if he would not see Hope and
arrange to sit for a photograph. After considerable correspondence
between DeVega and Hope the latter agreed to make the photo-
graphs provided DeVega would go to Crewe. DeVega assented to
this, and an appointment was made and the sitting took place. The
following account of DeVega's experience is taken from a full report
which he sent me.
"Dec. 16, 1921. Arrived at No. 144 Market Street, the door was
opened by an elderly lady. I asked if Mr. Hope was in and presently
he came down. I told him that a well known member of the Spirit-
ualist Society and a man known to be a collector of Spirit photographs
sent me and that seemed to be sufficient for Mr. Hope.
"I had brought my own camera along and asked him whether the
pictures could be taken with it. However, he said he used his own
camera but would let me investigate it all I wanted to. He told me
he could not possibly photograph me that forenoon as there was
another gentleman coming but arranged for two o'clock.
"I watched Market Street, from a distance, all the forenoon but
saw no one go in. I arrived there promptly but it was 2:30 before
Mr. Hope arrived. A Mrs. Buxton joined us. She, Hope and myself
sat around a small table. They sang hymns, said a prayer and asked
the table if all was favorable.
"At his request I placed my packages of plates on the table. They
placed their hands above them and sang again. Hope suddenly gave
a quiver and said, 'Now we will try.' He showed me the dark room,
which is a small arrangement of about six feet high, three feet wide
and five feet long. There were two shelves and on these were dusters,
cloths, bottles of chemicals, a lamp, etc. The lamp is an old affair
lit by a candle. The room is so very small that when two people are
in it there is no room to move about.
"He next showed me the camera and asked me to examine it.
I gave a glance at it and told him I did not doubt his word, which
seemed to please him a great deal. I thought if it was a fake he
would not allow me to examine it as closely as he asked me to. It

magical entertainer; has invented a number of legerdemain feats; con-

artist and a clever photographer. I was very fortunate in being able to
secure a man of his ability for the investigation.

placed their hands above them and sang again. Hope suddenly gave
a quiver and said, 'Now we will try.' He showed me the dark room,
which is a small arrangement of about six feet high, three feet wide
and five feet long. There were two shelves and on these were dusters,
cloths, bottles of chemicals, a lamp, etc. The lamp is an old affair
lit by a candle. The room is so very small that when two people are
in it there is no room to move about.
"He next showed me the camera and asked me to examine it.
I gave a glance at it and told him I did not doubt his word, which
seemed to please him a great deal. I thought if it was a fake he
would not allow me to examine it as closely as he asked me to. It

but worked with a cap over a lens (the cap was missing). He next
showed me the dark slide. It was an old-fashioned, double wood end
slide. I examined it very closely but it was unprepared.
"The studio itself is a little glass hot-house arrangement built on
to the side of the house. A green curtain is hung at the one end at
which the sitter sits.
"We went again into the dark room to load the plates. He gave
me his slide and told me to leave two of my own dark slides down
in front of the light as he would try my camera too. I opened my
plates and placed two in his dark slide and closed it. It was placed
on the under shelf where I could see it faintly. He then asked me to
open my own two slides slightly and sign my name on them. (I signed
J. B. Gilchrist.) As I signed them he moved the lamp to let me see
better. This threw the one fourth plate in the shadow. After that
he handed me the one fourth plate slide to sign the two plates in the
same way.
"/ am sure, although I did not actually see him, that the slide I
loaded, was changed for another one. It was too dark to see under
the level of the shelf. I, for a moment, considered letting my pencil
slip and spoil the plate and load in another from my pocket but I
thought it advisable to let things go on as I would then see just what
his usual procedure was. I wondered at the time Why I could not
have been told to take the plates from the package, sign them and then
place the plates In the slide and place the slide In my pocket until they
were to be exposed. Why was it necessary to sign my own plates In
my dark slide at all? In fact, there was no necessity for me to take my
slide In the dark room.
"We went back into the studio, again I was asked to examine the
camera. However, I took up my position in front of the camera.
Mrs. Buxton stood at one side and Mr. Hope at the other. The
dark focusing cloth was low over the lens (the cap being missing)
and the slide open. Mrs. Buxton and Hope sang a hymn and each
took an end of the cloth, uncovering the lens. This was repeated
with other plates as well.
"Now my camera was set up. I was asked to open the slide and
show them how the shutter worked. The exposure was made. He
placed his hand in front of the camera, covering the lens and asked
me to open the slide myself as he did not want to touch it. Now why
did he close the lens In that way? It would have been simpler to

have pushed down the open front of the slide, closing it, but I believe
that on his hand was a spot of some radiant salt or some such sub-
stance that would cause a bright spot to appear on the negative, such
as appeared on that plate when it was developed. Holding his hand
in front of the lens while an exposure was being made is such an un-
natural action that I believe that was the cause of what he called 'a
Spirit Light/ when it was developed. The next photograph I told
him to press the release again to close the shutter. He did so.
"We then adjourned into the dark room to develop the plates.
The two, one fourth plates were placed by me, side by side, in a dish
and the two three and a half by two and a half in another dish and
developed. By pouring the developer from one dish to another, one
of the one quarter plates flashed up dark. I remarked that one was
coming up very quickly and he replied that 'when they come up like
that it is a good sign for it is very likely there is an "extra" on them.
I said no more but in my experience and knowledge of photography,
such an occurrence is impossible unless the plates have been previously
exposed.
"The two plates were taken from the same packet, loaded into the
dark slide at the same time, with the same dark room light and the
same distance from the light. They were then exposed on the same
subject immediately after each other; the same length of exposure be-
ing given (I counted them mentally) with the same aperture of lens.
The plates were then placed side by side in the same dish of developer
and I contend that the image must come up at a uniform speed on
both plates and that it is impossible for one to flash up before the other
and darken all over unless it was previously exposed, especially when
there was no variation in the light when the exposure was made, it
being three P. M., December 16, clear sky, no sunshine.
"An 'extra* did appear on this (one fourth plate). It is a clean
shaven face above mine and drapery hanging from it. On my own
three and a half by two and a half a light splotch is over my face.
Mrs. Buxton informed me that it was a 'Spirit light* but Mr. Hope
believed he saw the faint features of a face in it."

A MAGICIAN AMONG THE SPIRITS 339
the eminent Psychic investigator, who, according to Sir Arthur,
had made a special journey from England to Denver in order to have
a seance with Martin but had not been successful.
Martin lived about fifteen minutes out of town by taxi. I took
with me my chief assistant, James Collins, so I would have a witness
if anything of a psychic nature occurred. Collins had my camera
as I wanted at least to get a picture of Martin. We found him
standing in the doorway of a rear building and after I introduced my-
self he seemed cordial. I showed him some Spirit photographs which
I had with me and after a few minutes talk I asked him if he was
willing that Collins should take a snap-shot at us. He thought I was
asking for a sitting and replied that he did not feel good and besides
had been engaged to take the pictures of the children in two schools.
I kept on talking in my most entertaining manner and before long
he invited us into the house saying he would photograph both of us.
Meanwhile Collins had secured five snap-shots at close range without
Martin knowing it.
When we went into the house I walked right into the dark room
but Martin called me saying :
"Now don't you go in there, just wait a minute."
While we waited outside Martin spent about eight minutes in the
dark room. Then he came out and we went into his studio, a simple
room with a black background. He had me sit down and placed
Collins behind me on my right. As a test I told Collins to step over
to the other side as it might look better. Then when he had done so
I turned to Martin and asked:
"Is that all right or is it better to have him take the original
position ?"
"I think it would be nicer if he stood where he was in the first
place," Martin replied.
This led me to think he was keeping that side of the plate clean
for something to appear. There was considerable light in the room
and Martin pulled a dark screen on our right explaining that he did
not need much light for the psychic stuff, then putting a shade on his
eyes he turned to us and said :
"Now keep quiet and I will try and do something."
When he uncovered the lens I counted the time of the exposure
which was about fifteen seconds. As he covered it again he said to us :
"That is all I can do to-day. Now I must hurry away."
We thanked him and as we were going out I asked him if he had

340 HARRY HOUDINt
any photographs we could see. He went into an adjoining room but
closed the door so we had no opportunity to look in. When he came
out he had four photographs which he allowed me to keep but he
would not write on them who they were of.
The next day I went to see him again and he gave me another
seance. This time he said he would have to cut a plate and he gave
me a book to read while I waited. In looking for a piece of paper
on which to write my address he picked up a lot of newspapers and I
noticed some scientific publications systematically inserted between
the leaves which led me to think he was trying to hide his knowledge
and wished to appear as a simple minded old man who knew but little
about photography.
I have not the slightest doubt that Mr. Martin's Spirit photo-
graphs were simply double exposures. I think his method was to cut
out various pictures, place them on a background and make an ex-
posure. His plates were then ready for his next sitter, who in the
above instance was myself. Being an expert photographer he might
have used the original wet plate method of making an exposure,
developing it, washing the emulsion off the plate and refmishing it
with a new emulsion but I am convinced that the two Spirit photos
which he made of me were simply double exposures.
The technique of photography does not trouble the psychic operator.
He has no regard for the laws of light or chemistry. The fact that in
all of his pictures the Spirits appear to be perfectly conscious of posing
does not disconcert him, nor is he disturbed because they always appear
as they were in life. How much more interesting it would be and how
much more such photographs would add to our knowledge and aid the
advancement of science if once in a while the Spirits would permit
themselves to be snapped while engaged in some Spiritual occupation.
From a logical, rational point of view, Spirit photography is a most
barefaced imposition and stands as evidence of the credulity of those
who are in sympathy with the superstitions of occultism. It is also
evidence of how unscrupulous mediums become and how calloused
their consciences.
In this country there is no such organized group of Spirit photo-
graphers as the Crewe photographers in England. Since Mumler's
narrow escape from deserved punishment and his disappearance there
have been few who had the courage to operate as boldly as he did.

his life and soul into the conversion of unbelievers. Sir Arthur
believes. In his great mind there is no doubt.
He is a brilliant man, a deep thinker, well versed in every respect,
and comes of a gifted family. His grandfather, John Doyle, was
born in Dublin in 1797. He won popularity and fame in London
with his caricatures of prominent people. Many of his original draw-
ings are now preserved in the museum under the title "H, B. Car-
icatures." He died in 1868. An uncle of Sir Arthur's was the
famous "Dicky Doyle," the well-known cartoonist of Punch and de-
signer of the familiar cover of that magazine. In his later years he
became prominent as an illustrator, making drawings for The New-
comes in 1853, and becoming especially successful in illustrating such
fairy stories as Hunt's "Jar of Honey," Ruskin's "King of the Golden
River," and Montelbas' "Fairy Tales of all Nations." The fact
that he leaned toward Spiritualism is not generally known. Sir
Arthur's father, Charles A. Doyle, was also an artist of great talent
though not in a commercial way. His home life is beautiful and Lady
Doyle has told me on numerous occasions that he never loses his tem-
per and that his nature is at all times sunshiny and sweet. His child-
ren are one hundred per cent children in every way and it is beauti-
ful to note the affection between the father, mother and the children.
He is a great reader who absorbs what he reads but he believes what
he sees in print only if it is favorable to Spiritualism.
The friendship of Sir Arthur and myself dates back to the time
when I was playing the Brighton Hippodrome, Brighton, England.
We had been corresponding and had discussed through the medium
of the mail, questions regarding Spiritualism. He invited Mrs. Hou-
dini and myself to the Doyle home in Crowborough, England, and in
that way an acquaintanceship was begun which has continued ever
since. Honest friendship is one of life's most precious treasures and I
pride myself in thinking that we have held that treasure sacred in
every respect. During all these years we have exchanged clippings
which we thought might be of mutual interest and on a number of
occasions have had an opportunity to discuss them in person. Our
degree of friendship may be judged best from the following letter
of Sir Arthur's.

You have done enough of them. I speak because I have just read
of the death of the "Human Fly."* It is worth it?
"Yours very sincerely,
(Signed) A. CONAN DOYLE."
It would be difficult to determine just when Sir Arthur and I first
discussed Spiritualism, but from that talk to the present we have never
agreed upon it. Our viewpoints differ; we do not believe the same
thing. I know that he treats Spiritualism as a religion. He believes
that it is possible and than he can communicate with the dead. Ac-
cording to his marvellous analytical brain he has had proof positive
of this. There is no doubt that Sir Arthur is sincere in his belief and
it is this sincerity which has been one of the fundamentals of our
friendship. I have respected everything he has said and / have al-
ways been unbiased, because at no time have I refused to follow the
subject with an open mind. I cannot say the same for him for he
has refused to discuss the matter in any other voice except that of
Spiritualism and in all our talks quoted only those who favored it in
every way, and if one does not follow him sheep-like during his in-
vestigations then he is blotted out forever so far as Sir Arthur is con-
cerned. Unfortunately he uses the reasoning, so common among
Spiritualists, that no matter how often mediums are caught cheating

It would be difficult to determine just when Sir Arthur and I first
discussed Spiritualism, but from that talk to the present we have never
agreed upon it. Our viewpoints differ; we do not believe the same
thing. I know that he treats Spiritualism as a religion. He believes
that it is possible and than he can communicate with the dead. Ac-
cording to his marvellous analytical brain he has had proof positive.
of this. There is no doubt that Sir Arthur is sincere in his belief and
it is this sincerity which has been one of the fundamentals of our
friendship. I have respected everything he has said and I hafJe al-
ways been unbiased, because at no time have I refused to follow the
subject with an open mind. I cannot say the same for him for he
has refused to discuss the matter in any other voice except that of
Spiritualism and in all our talks quoted only those who favored it in
eveti way, and if one does not follow him sheep-like during his in-
vestigations then he is blotted out forever so far as Sir Arthur is con-
cerned. Unfortunately he uses the reasoning, so common among
Spiritualists, that no matter how often mediums are caught cheating
he believes the only reason for it is that they have overstepped their
bounds and resorted to trickery in an effort to convince. I wonder
if some day Sir Arthur will forget that he is a Spiritualist and argue a

me that Palladino* and Home some day would be canonized for the
great work they did in the interest of Spiritualism, even though they
were both exposed time and time again. In all gravity he would say
to me, "Look what they did to Joan of Arc." To Sir Arthur it is
a matter of most sacred moment. It is his religion, and he would in-
variably tell me what a cool observer he was and how hard it would
be to fool him, or in any way deceive him.** He told me that he did
not believe any of "the nice old lady mediums" would do anything
wrong and it was just as unlikely for some old gentleman, innocent
as a child unborn, to resort to trickery. But there comes to my mind
the notorious Mrs. Catherine Nicol and her two daughters who were
continuously getting in and out of the law's net, usually breaking the
heads of a few detectives in the process. Among the "nice old lady"
mediums might be mentioned a prominent medium of Boston who
was accused of taking unlawfully from one of her believers over eight
thousand dollars in cash.
Another case was that of a medium who received $1,000 from a
man in Baltimore for the privilege of a few minutes' chat with the

described this seance as very clever.^

could be done. Among them, the black boxes were exchanged surreptitiously

Brothers being genuine, and related how, owing to the great interest

land was to have been one of the committee, but the mediums refused
to allow him to be "Among those present." As they refused to pro-

struments that were used and instructed the investigating committee
how to detect fraud. The feature of the seance was the passing
along in the circle, of a button and a pair of suspenders, which were
thrown on the knees of a news Editor present. I ask the common-

A MAGICIAN AMONG THE SPIRITS 349
I reminded Sir Arthur of the Davenport Brothers and called to his
attention the fact that they were able to release themselves. Sir Ar-
thur feels very strongly in the matter of the Davenport Brothers and
although I have told him and proven to him that I was a pupil of
Ira Erastus Davenport and that Ira personally told me that they did
not claim to be Spiritualists and their performances were not given in
the name of Spiritualism, Sir Arthur insists that they were Spiritual-
ists and has strongly said that if they did their performances under any
other name, then Ira was "not only a liar, but a blasphemer as he
went around with Mr. Ferguson, a clergyman, and mixed it all up
with religion."
I want to go on record that to the best of my knowledge and belief
I never stated that Sir Arthur endorsed the mediumship of the New
York Thompsons. I did say there were full page articles:): where he
was illustrated as accepting the genuineness of the materialization of
his mother. I never claimed that Sir Arthur's son or brother came
through the Thomas mediums in Cardiff. I did state, that Sir Arthur
said -they were genuine and that they, the mediums, were helpless to
move because he had tied them and in his judgment if they were tied
in my presence I would be convinced of their genuineness. I wish
to call attention to the fact that in a letter written by the late Stuart
Cumberland he agreed with me that there was not a vestige of truth
in the mediumship of the Thomas Brothers, and regarding Sir Ar-
thur's endorsement of the "Masked Lady/' I did not say he endorsed
her although 1 should judge from newspaper* accounts he seemed
very much impressed.
Sir Arthur has rarely given me an opportunity to deny or affirm any
statement. In fact one of our sore points of discussion has been the
matter of being quoted, or misquoted, in newspapers or periodicals
and it seems that Sir Arthur always believes everything I have been

I reminded Sir Arthur of the Davenport Brothers and called to his
attention the fact that they were able to release themselves. Sir Ar-
thur feels very strongly in the matter of the Davenport Brothers and
although I have told him and proven to him that I was a pupil of
Ira Erastus Davenport and that Ira personally told me that they did
not claim to be Spiritualists and their performances were not given in
the name of Spiritualism, Sir Arthur imists that they were Spiritual-
ists and has strongly said that if they did their performances under any
other name, then Ira was "not only a liar, but a blasphemer as he
went around with Mr. Ferguson, a clergyman, and mixed it all up
with religion."
I want to go on record that to the best of my knowledge and belief
I never stated that Sir Arthur endorsed the mediumship of the New
York Thompsons. I did say there were full page articlest where he
was illustrated as accepting the genuineness of the materialization of
his mother. I never claimed that Sir Arthur's son or brother came
through the Thomas mediums in Cardiff. I did state that Sir Arthur
said, they were genuine and that they, the mediums, were helpless to
move because he had tied them and in his judgment if they were tied
in my presence I would be convinced of their genuineness. I wish
to call attention to the fact that in a letter written by the late Stuart
Cumberland he agreed with me that there was not a vestige of truth
in the mediumship of the Thomas Brothers, and regarding Sir Ar-
thur's endorsement of the "l\1asked Lady," I did not say he endorsed
her although 1 should judge from newspaper* accounts he seemed
very much impressed.
Sir Arthur has rarely given me an opportunity to dwy or affirm any
statement. In fact one of our sore points of discussion has been the
matter of being quoted, or misquoted, in newspapers or periodicals
and it seems that Sir Arthur always believes everything I have been
quoted as having said. When I was in Oakland, California, I was
interviewed by a Mr. Henderson of the Oakland T1·ibune. I gave
him some material to work on, enough for one article from which,
to my surprise, he wrote a series of eight articles enlarging and mis-

heard of my son or brother through the Thomas brothers. They were
never exposed. I never said that Masked Medium was genuine. I

even though to all outward appearances we are merely talking, point-
ing or doing the most innocent looking things, but which have dif-
ferent meanings to us.
In that manner Mrs. Houdini told me that on the night previous
she had gone into detail with Lady Doyle about the great love I bear
for my Mother. She related to her a number of instances, such as,
my returning home from long trips, sometimes as far away as
Australia, and spending months with my Mother and wearing only
the clothes that she had given me, because I thought it would please
her and give her some happiness. My wife also remarked about my
habit of laying my head on my Mother's breast, in order to hear her
heart beat. Just little peculiarities that mean so much to a mother
and son when they love one another as we did.
I walked with Sir Arthur to the Doyles* suite. Sir Arthur drew
down the shades so as to exclude the bright light. We three, Lady
Doyle, Sir Arthur and I, sat around the table on which were a number
of pencils and a writing pad, placing our hands on the surface of the
table.
Sir Arthur started the seance with a devout prayer. I had made
up my mind that I would be as religious as it was within my power
to be and not at any time did I scoff at the ceremony. I excluded all
earthly thoughts and gave my whole soul to the seance.
I was willing to believe, even wanted to believe. It was weird to
me and with a beating heart I waited, hoping that I might feel once
more the presence of my beloved Mother. If there ever was a son
who idolized and worshipped his Mother, whose every thought was
for her happiness and comfort, that son was myself. My Mother
meant my life, her happiness was synonymous with my peace of mind.
For that reason, if no other, I wanted to give my every deepest at-
tention to what was going on. It meant to me an easing of all pain
that I had in my heart. I especially wanted to speak to my Mother,
because that day, June 77, 1922, was her birthday.* I was deter-
mined to embrace Spiritualism if there was any evidence strong
enough to down the doubts that have crowded my brain for the past
thirty years.
Presently, Lady Doyle was "seized by a Spirit." Her hands shook
and beat the table, her voice trembled and she called to the Spirits

to give her a message. Sir Arthur tried to quiet her, asked her to re-
strain herself, but her hand thumped on the table, her whole body
shook and at last, making a cross at the head of the page, started
writing. And as she finished each page, Sir Arthur tore the sheet off
and handed it to me. I sat serene through it all, hoping and wishing
that I might feel my mother's presence. There wasn't even a sem-
blance of it. Everyone who has ever had a worshipping Mother and
has lost earthly touch, knows the feeling which will come over him
at the thought of sensing her presence.
The letter which follows, purported to have come from my Mother,
I cannot, as much as I desire, accept as having been written or in-
spired by the soul or Spirit of my sweet Mother.
"Oh, my darling, thank God, thank God, at last I'm through
I've tried, oh, so often now I am happy. Why, of course I want to
talk to my boy my own beloved boy Friends, thank you, with all
my heart for this."

such a son tell him not to grieve soon he'll get all the evidence

"I will work with him he is so, so dear to me I am preparing so
sweet a home for him in which some day in God's good time he will
come to it, is one of my great joys preparing for, our future."
"I am so happy in this life it is so full and joyous my only
shadow has been that my beloved one hasn't known how often I have
been with him all the while, all the while here away from my heart's
darling combining my work thus in this life of mine."
"It is so different over here, so much larger and bigger and more
beautiful so lofty all sweetness around one nothing that hurts
and we see our beloved ones on earth that is such a joy and com-
fort to us Tell him I love him more than ever the years only in-
crease it and his goodness fills my soul with gladness and thank-
fulness. Oh, just this, it is me. I want him only to know that
that I have bridged the gulf that is what I wanted, oh, so much

what you have done for me this day God bless you, too, Sir Arthur,
for what you are doing for us for us, over here who so need to
get in touch with our beloved ones on the earth plane
"
"If only the world knew this great truth how different life would
be for men and women Go on let nothing stop you great will be
your reward hereafter Good-by I brought you, Sir Arthur, and
my son together I felt you were the only man who might help us to
pierce this veil and I was right Bless him, bless him, bless him, I
say, from the depths of my soul he fills my heart and later we shall
be together Oh so happy a happiness awaits him that he has never
dreamed of tell him I am with him just tell him that I'll soon
make him know how close I am all the while his eyes will soon be
opened Good-by again God's blessing on you all."
In the case of my seance, Sir Arthur believed that due to the great
excitement it was a direct connection.
The more so do I hesitate to believe and accept the above letter be-
cause, although my sainted mother had been in America for almost
fiftj* years, she could not speak, read nor write English but Spiritual-
ists claim that when a medium is possessed by a Spirit who does not
speak the language, she automatically writes, speaks or sings in the
language of the deceased; however, Sir Arthur has told me that a
Spirit becomes more educated the longer it is departed and that my
blessed Mother had been able to master the English language in
Heaven.
After the purported letter from my Mother had been written and
I had read it over very carefully, Sir Arthur advised me to follow
out the advice, given by my Mother, to try to write when I reached
home.
I picked up a pencil in a haphazard manner and said, "Is there
any particular way in which I must hold this pencil when I want to
write, or does it write automatically?" / then wrote the name of
"Powell" entirely of my own volition. Sir Arthur jumped up ex-
citedly and read what I had just written. He saw the word
"Powell" and said, "The Spirits have directed you in writing the
name of my dear fighting partner in Spiritualism, Dr. Ellis Powell,
who has just died in England. I am the person he is most likely
to signal to, and here is his name coming through your hands. Truly
Saul is among the Prophets."
I must emphatically state that this name was written entirely of
my own volition and in full consciousness. I had in my mind, my

for what you are doing for us-for us, over here-who so need to

whom at the time I was having a great deal of correspondence re-
garding a business proposition which has since been consummated.
There is not the slightest doubt of it having been more than a
deliberate mystification on my part, or let us say a kindlier word
regarding my thoughts and call it "coincidence."
A few days later Sir Arthur sent me the following letter in ref-
erence to my explanation of the writing of the name, "Powell."

"My dear Houdini:

the one man who would wish to get me, but in the evening, Mrs.

that he is sorry he had to speak so abruptly this afternoon." The
message was then broken by your Mother's renewed message and
so we got no name. But it confirms me in the belief that it was
Powell. However, you will no doubt test your powers further.

I had written an article for the New York Sun, October 30,

attention of Sir Arthur, who wrote as follows:

"My dear Houdini:
". . . I see that you are on the Scientific American Committee,
but how can it be called an Impartial Committee when you have
committed yourself to such statements as that some Spiritualists
pass away before they realize how they have been deluded, etc?
You have every possible right to hold such an opinion, but you can't
sit on an Impartial Committee afterwards. It becomes biased at
once. What I wanted was five good clear-headed men who can
push to it without any prejudice at all, like the Dialectical Society*
of London, who unanimously endorsed the phenomena.

test seances. The permanent sitters were Mr. Walker, Mr. Les-
curboura, Mr. J. Malcolm Bird of the Editorial staff of the Scien-
tific American, Mr. Owen of the Times, Mr. Granville Lehrmann
of the American Telephone and Telegraph and Richard I. Worrell,
a friend of the medium. Drs. Carrington and Prince of the Com-
mittee of Judges sat on Monday. Dr. Prince and myself on Thurs-
day. On Tuesday the Committee was represented by Mr. Fred-
erick Keating, conjuror.
The medium, a man by the name of George Valentine of Wilkes-
of human exertion, and failed utterly in so doing when securely fettered, as
proved to be the case, when I personally did the tying.
And from the results gotten thus far from the series of sittings with this
"medium" it is safe to predict that the final analysis will place him in the
same category as all others to date.
*According to Spiritualistic publications The Dialectical Society never
made a full report. The "Reports" of sub-committees only were published
by Spiritualist papers used by writers in books but such reports were based
on "hear-say" evidence taken from Spirits. They told their ghost stories
to Committees and they were believed. There never was a unanimous re-
port or conclusion. The non-Spiritual (?) members of the Dialectical So-
ciety refused to have anything to do with the investigation. The great
majority of the Committee were full-fledged Spiritualists, and the few whom
they claimed to have convinced were simply credulous.

Barre, Pcnn., claimed to be genuine. He was trapped by being
seated on a chair which was so arranged that when he arose an elec-
tric light arrangement was fixed in the room adjoining, together
with dictographs and a phosphorous button. In the estimation of
the Committee, Mr. Valentine was just a common, ordinary trick-
ster.
Lady Doyle, Miss Juliet Karcher, Mrs. Houdini, Sir Arthur and
I were lunching at the Royal Automobile 'Club in London, May 11,
1920, and Sir Arthur called attention to the fact that a few days
previously they had been sitting at the same table with a powerful
medium, and he told me in a very serious tone, which was corrobo-
rated by Lady Doyle, that the table started to move all around the
place to the astonishment of the waiter, who -was not aware of the
close proximity of the medium.
All the time he was relating it, I watched him closely and saw
that both he and Lady Doyle were most sincere and believed what
they had told me to be an actual fact.
There are times when I almost doubt the sincerity of some of Sir
Arthur's statements, even though I do not doubt the sincerity of his
belief.
I have been over a number of letters which I have received from
Sir Arthur during the last few years and selected the following
excerpts which show his viewpoint regarding many of the matters
we have discussed.
"I do not wonder that they put you down as an occult. As I
read the accounts I do not see how you do it. You must be a
brave man as well as exceptionally dexterous."
"How you get out of the diving suits beats me, but the whole
thing beats me completely."
"I spoke of the Davenport Brothers. Your word on the matter
knowing, as you do both the man and Ithe possibilities of his art,
would be final."
"You are to me a perpetual mystery. No doubt you are to
everyone."
"In a fair light I saw my dead Mother as clearly as I ever saw
her in life. I am a cool observer and I do not make mistakes. It
was wonderful but it taught me nothing I did not know before."

sake be careful in those fearsome feats of yours. You ought to be
able to retire now."

baffling it is to the layman. He says that I do not enter a seance
in the right frame of mind, that I should be more submissive, but
in all the seances I have attended I have never had a feeling of
antagonism. I have no desire to discredit Spiritualism; I have no
warfare with Sir Arthur; I have no fight with the Spirits; but I
do believe it is my duty, for the betterment of humanity, to place
frankly before the public the results of my long investigation of
Spiritualism. I am willing to be convinced; my mind is open, but
the proof must be such as to leave no vestige of doubt that what is
claimed to be done is accomplished only through or by supernatural
power. So far I have never on any occasion, in all the seances I
have attended, seen anything which would lead me to credit a
mediumistic performance with supernatural aid, nor have I ever
seen anything which has convinced me that it is possible to com-
municate with those who have passed out of this life. Therefore I
do not agree with Sir Arthur.
IV. CONCLUSION
It has been my desire in this book to convey to the reader my
views regarding Spiritualism which are the result of study and in-
vestigation, the startling feature of which has been the utter inability
of the average human being to describe accurately anything he or she
has witnessed. Many sitters, devoid of the sense of acute observa-
tion, prefer to garnish and embellish their stories with the fruits of
their fertile imaginations, adding a choice bit every time the incident
is reported, and eventually, by a trick of the brain, really believing
what they say. It is evident, therefore, that by clever misguidance
and apt misdirection of attention, a medium can accomplish seeming
wonders. The sitter becomes positively self-deluded and actually
thinks he has seen weird phantoms or has heard the voice of a be-
loved one.
To my knowledge I have never been baffled in the least by what
I have seen at seances. Everything I have seen has been merely a
form of mystification. The secret of all such performances is to
catch the mind off guard and the moment after it has been surprised
to follow up with something else that carries the intelligence along
with the performer, even against the spectator's will. When it is
possible to do this with a highly developed mind like Mr. Kellar's,
one trained in magic mystery, and when scientific men of the intel-
ligence of Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the late

do believe it is my duty, for the betterment of humanity, to place
frankly before the public the results of my long investigation of
Spiritualism. I am willing to be convinced ; my mind is open, but
the proof must be such as to leave no vestige of doubt that what is
claimed to be done is accomplished only through or by supernatural
power. So far I have never on any occasion, in all the seances I
have attended, seen anything which would lead me to credit a
mediumistic performance with supernatural aid, nor have I ever
seen anything which has convinced me that it is possible to com-
municate with those who have passed out of this life. Therefore I
do not agree with Sir Arthur.
IV. CoNCLUSION
It has been my desire in this book to convey to the reader my
views regarding Spiritualism which are the result of study and in-
vestigation, the startling feature of which has been the utter inability
of the average human being to describe accurately anything he or she
has witnessed. Many sitters, devoid of the sense of acute observa-
tion, prefer to garnish and embellish their stories with the fruits of
their fertile imaginations, adding a choice bit every time the incident
is reported, and eventually, by a trick of the brain, really believing
what they say. It is evident, therefore, that by clever o:{isguidance
and apt misdirection of attention, a medium can accomplish seeming
wonders. The sitter becomes positively self-deluded and actually
thinks he has seen weird phantoms or has heard the voice of a be-
loved one.
To my knowledge I have never been baffled in the least by what
I have seen at seances. Everything I have seen has been merely a
form of mystification. The secret of all such performances is to
catch the mind ofi guard and the moment after it has been surprised
to follow up with something else that carries the intelligence along
with the performer, even against the spectator's will. When it is
possible to do this with a highly developed mind like Mr. Kellar's,
one trained in magic mystery, and when scientific men of the intel-
ligence of Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the late
A MAGICIAN AMONG THE SPIRITS 363
William Crookes and William T. Stead, can be made to believe by
such means how much easier it must be in the case of ordinary
human beings.
I cannot accept nor even comprehend the intelligence which jus-
tifies the conclusion, so often put in print as the opinion of brainy
men supporting Spiritualism, that admits the possibility of a result
being accomplished by natural means but nevertheless assert their
sincere belief that the identical performance by a professional medium
is solely of supernatural origin and guidance, nor can I understand
the reasoning that, acknowledging the disreputable character of cer-
tain practitioners or mediums, deliberately defends the culprits in
the performance of what has been proven a crime. Is it true logic,
logic that would stand either in court or club room, to say that a
medium caught cheating ninety-nine times out of a hundred was
honest the hundredth time because not caught? Would the reader
trust a servant who stole ninety-nine articles and then professed in-
nocence when the hundredth article was missing?
Sir Conan Doyle asks in all innocence, "Is it really scientific to
deny and at the same time refuse to investigate?" My answer is
most emphatically "no." Nevertheless, they absolutely oppose all
honest efforts at investigation, and justify the mediums in refusing
to work when the conditions are not just as they want them. When
one is invited to a dark seance for the purpose of investigation and
finds the conditions so fixed as to bar him from enquiring too
closely and compel him to be content with merely looking on he
stands a poor chance of getting at the facts, and should he dare to dis-
regard the "rules of the circle" and the seance results in a blank, the
investigator is charged with having brought an atmosphere of incre-
dulity to bear which prevents manifestation.
I do not affirm that the claims of Spiritualism are disproved by
such failures but I do say that if under such circumstances one
dared to investigate properly and sanely, and to cross-examine, as
he most certainly would do in any other form of investigation,
scientific, or in the other walks of life, Spiritualism would not be
so generously accepted. In justification the psychic says that dark-
ness or excessively dim light is perfectly legitimate and that tangible
investigation might result in injury or even death to the medium.
The folly of any such fear has been proven time and again by the
unexpected play of a flash light. Even the ardent supporters who
lay emphasis on such ah absurdity, according to their own confes-

sion, made, or had made, flashlight photographs and there has
never been a single case of harm or disaster reported. This necessity
for darkness seems but the grossest invention of the medium to di-
vert, even to the point of intimidation, the attention of the sitters.
Such a necessity cannot be accorded a logical reason for existing under
test conditions to demonstrate a scientific subject. It can be sup-
ported only as a visionary, speculative superstition; an instrument
to foster hallucinatory illusion and as an admirable subterfuge to
cover fraud.
Sir Arthur says:
"If you want to send a telegram you must go to a telegraph
office. If you want to telephone you must first pick up the re-
ceiver and give your message to either an operator or a waiting auto-
maton."
Very well, I have gone to the operator between the Beyond and
this earthly sphere, I have gone to the telegraph office that receives
the message in code, to the so-called medium. What would be more
wonderful to me than to be able to converse with my beloved
mother? Surely there is no love in this world like a mother's
love, no closeness of spirit, no other heart throbs that beat alike;
but I have not heard from my blessed Mother, except through the
dictates of the inmost recesses of my heart, the thoughts which fill
my brain and the memory of her teachings.
Would not my private secretary, John William Sargent, come
back to me and tell me the secrets of the beyond if it were possible?
Did he not, just before he died, tell me that he would come to me
if there was any way of doing it? More than being a private sec-
retary, he was my friend, true, loyal, sacrificing, knew me for
thirty years. He has not come back to me and he would if it were
possible.
I had compacts with a round dozen. Each one promised me
faithfully to come back if it were possible. I have even gone so far
as to create secret codes and hand-grips. Sargent had a certain word
he was to repeat to me; William Berol, the eminent mental expert,
gave me the secret handshake a few hours before he died and did
not regain consciousness after silently telling me that he remem-
bered our compact; Atlanta Hall, niece of President Pierce, a
woman ninety years of age, who had had seances with the greatest
mediums that visited Boston, called for me just before her death,
clasped my hand and gave me our agreed-upon grip which she was

A MAGICIAN AMONG THE SPIRITS 365
to give me through a medium. They have never come back to me!
Does that prove anything? I have attended a number of seances
since their death, the mediums have called for them, and when
their spirit forms were supposed to appear not one of them could
give me the proper signal. Would I have received it? I'll wager
I would have. There was love of some kind between each of these
friends who are gone and myself. It is needless to point out the
love of a mother and son; the love of a real friend; the love of a
woman of ninety toward a man who held her dear; the love of a
philosopher toward a man who respected his life study, they were
all loves, each strong, each binding. If these persons, with all the
love they bore in their heart for me and all the love I have in my
heart for them, did not return, what about those who did not hold
me close, who had no interest in me? Why should they come back
and mine not?
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has repeatedly told the Spiritualists that
I will eventually see the light and embrace Spiritualism. If the
memory of a loved one, gone to the protection of the hands of the
Great Mystifier means Spiritualism, then truly I do believe in it.
But if Spiritualism is to be founded on the tricks of exposed mediums,
feats of magic, resort to trickery, then I say unflinchingly I do not be-
lieve, and more, I will not believe. I have said many times that I am
willing to believe, want to believe, will believe if the Spiritualists can
show any substantiated proof, but until they do I shall have to live on,
believing from all the evidence shown me and from what I have
experienced that Spiritualism has not been proven satisfactorily to
the world at large and that none of the evidence offered has been
able to stand up under the fierce rays of investigation.
It is not for us to prove that the mediums are dishonest, it is for
them to prove that they are honest. They have made a statement,
the most serious statement in recent times, for it affects the welfare,
the mental attitude and means a complete revolution of age-old be-
liefs and customs of the world. If there is anything to Spiritualism
then the world should know it. If there is nothing to it, if it is, as
it appears, built on a flimsy framework of misdirection, then too the
universe must be told. There is too much at stake for a flighty
passing, for unsubstantiated truths.
