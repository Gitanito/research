PREFACE
In response to the many requests from members of the Order
M ilitia Crucifera EvangeuCA wc are happy to present a re­
publication of four of the Manifestoes of the Order.
The first of these, Thu L unenburg M anifesto of 1530, is of
particular interest, since it embodies much of the fundamental
philosophy of the Militia. The Second M anifesto of L unen­
burg, issued 68 years later, actually established the Militia as an
Order and adds much of value to the earlier declaration. It is
believed that a Third Manifesto was issued during this period,
although the manuscript is not in the archives of the Order.
The first AMERICAN M anifesto was published under the au­
thority of the Supreme Council in 1902. Its philosophy is identical
with that first expressed in 1530. It represents primarily an
endeavor to interpret in terms more acceptable to the modern
western world the underlying tenets and principles of the Order.
The Second American M anifesto was published in 1903, and
bears to the earlier American document about the same relation­
ship in principle as that which existed between the Second AND
First L unenburg M anifestoes.
The earlier publications in 1902 and 1903 met with such an
enthusiastic reception that the membership of the Order increased
rapidly, with a resultant demand for a further elaboration of its
principles. Consequently, in 1905, a volume, T he Order Cru-
cii era E vangklica, was published in the form of a handbook of
198 pages. This book contained a history of the Order in Europe,
the European Manifestoes, rules and obligations, and the earlier
American Manifestoes. The entire edition was absorbed within a
few months of printing. Since then much of the earlier material
has been republished in pamphlet form and in the official magazine,
T he Initiates. It is interesting to observe that while the Order
is an entity in itself, its symbol and emblem form one of the seven
of the Associated Fraternities, as shown on the cover of T he
Initiate, a reproduction of which is included herein.

FOREWORD
Webster’s Dictionary defines the verb “plagiarize"—“to steal,
or to use as one’s own, the ideas, words, writings, etc., of another."
Plagiarism is one of the most contemptible of all forms of theft.
It is a parasitic entity that draws its nourishment from the ideals
and labors, aye, even the suffering and self-denial of others—many
times of those who sacrificed their all, even life itself, in the accom­
plishment of an idea or an ideal. Plagiarism often depends for its
very existence upon the essences distilled from lies and misrepresen­
tations.
The philosophies of true ancient lineage have suffered continu­
ally throughout the centuries from the work of imposters, plagiar­
ists and charlatans. Masquerading under self-appointed authority
and usurped title, with counterfeited, self-invented and stolen ma­
terial, as a claim to leadership, there arc those in this country and
of this century who have constituted themselves leaders of self-
denominated “ancient orders," under one name or another, and
have established organizations with thousands of followers whose
experience could only end in disappointment and disillusionment.
We have no concern witli the sin or folly of such people, but we arc
concerned with preserving the landmarks of the ancient mysteries
and in defending the sincere aspirant from the injuries resulting
from delusion.
We would be derelict in our duties were we to allow misrepre­
sentation to go unchallenged, and we shall not be thus amiss. It
is beneath our dignity as men to indulge in bitter personalities or
personal denunciation, but in every instance in which plagiarism is
brought to our attention in respect to any of the associated frater­
nities, we shall publish the facts—and the reader shall be the
judge.
The M ilitia Crucieera E vangelica suffered no plagiarism,
to our knowledge, prior to 1933. During that year, and since, un­
authorized use of the name has been frequent, and despite the pro­
tests of the original organization, usurpation ol our rights and
lineage has been repeated.
That full knowledge may be had by all, we have added an
Addendum hereto, wherein is given detailed information, and we
refer the reader to the same at the end of this volume.

INTRODUCTION
The Sixteenth Century witnessed such a complete dominance by
the Catholic Church of every phase of religious and philosophical
activity, that to antagonize it meant death or worse than death.
The Church was utterly intolerant. It permitted no freedom in
the expression of thought that differed from its own.
A group of men who deliberately chose to risk all that they held
dear secretly organized under the name of MlLlTIA Crucifera
Evangelica, that their combined efforts might be directed to com­
bat this religious tyranny and intolerance. The circumstances
which occasioned the organization and surrounded its early activi­
ties influenced its perspective as an Order to such an extent that for
a time it was sectarian in the sense that its primary purpose was
opposition to the then dominant church. History indicates a
strong sympathy for Luther, and it would appear that for a time
the Order reinforced the activity of the Lutheran Church. How­
ever, as conditions changed through the centuries, the Militia
gradually became truly non-sectarian, and during its later history
the religious faith of an acolyte has not been questioned. The
Order was established to militant!)' defend the principles of toler­
ance and freedom. Its ideal, in its exoteric organization, was that
of absolute and complete freedom of man to worship, without
compulsion or restraint, at the altar which he himself chose.
There is no indication that the Militia was organized by the
Rosicrucian Order, but research definitely establishes sympathy
with its existence among those who arc believed to have been
Rosicrucians.
T he M anifestoes of L unenburg clearly establish principles
and purposes which reflect the deep interest of the membership of
the Militia in the mystical and philosophical teachings, and indi­
cate definitely that the further purpose of the Order was to pre­
serve these teachings from debasement. To this end it defends its
members today, as it has throughout its history, against the
religious intolerance of any church or organization, regardless of
whether its adherents are numbered in units of millions or threes.
The Order has survived not because of its militancy; it has survived
7
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F K R A EVANGELI CA
through the centuries because of its underlying doctrines and phil­
osophy. These are the principles of fundamental religion. The
teachings are those of mysticism; its work is in the interest of the
immortalization of the Soul; its soldiers arc for the defense of free­
dom in matters of worship: its exoteric principle, the right of the
few to protection from the domination of the many.
An expression of its ideal is embodied in the thesis of “The
Brotherhood of Man” by George Washington:
“As a member of an infant empire, as a philanthropist
by character, and, if I may be allowed the expression, as
a citizen of the great republic of humanity at large, I can­
not help turning my attention sometimes to this subject,
‘How mankind may be connected, like one great family,
in fraternal ties’, I indulge a fond, perhaps an enthusi­
astic idea, that as the world is evidently much less bar­
barous than it has been, its amelioration must still be
progressive; that nations are becoming more humanized
in their policy; that the subject of ambition and causes for
hostility are daily diminishing: and in fine, that the period
is not very remote when the benefits of a liberal and free
commerce will liberally succeed the devastations and the
horrors of war.”
T hf. LltNF.NBURG M anifestoes of the Sixteenth Century are
basic, to any clear concept of the ideals and purposes of the Order.
The history of activities of the Militia, either in foreign lands, or
in America prior to the Twentieth Century, is not of interest to
the purpose of the present publication. The present phase of the
activity of the Order in America began in 1901, and was first
announced in the American M anifesto of 1902. The last IS
years of the Nineteenth Century had indicated that a period was
beginning in which intolerance and bigotry must again be met mili­
tant ly and aggressively. It was evident that circumstances were
developing that could only end in tyranny, unless men interested in
the Principle of Freedom once more fought the forces that sought
domination.
It was in 1901 that a group of men, many of whom were mem­
bers of long established fraternal, mystical and philosophical
orders, requested authority from the then International Supreme
Grand Master, Count Quinotti, to establish in America T he
Order M ilitia Crucifera Evangelica. Permission was
O R D E R M I L I T I A C R U C I F E R A E V A N G E L I C A
granted in the same year. In 1902, the First AMERICAN M ani­
festo was published, and this was followed in 1903 by the publi­
cation of the Second American M anifesto.
To avoid repetition as much as possible and to further illumi­
nate the contents of all four of these Manifestoes, some changes in
the text have been made. In such instances, however, the substance
of the thought remains the same.

MANIFESTO
O r d e r M ilitia C r u c i f e r a E v a n g e lic a
Lunenburg, 1530
Brethren, since we no longer can believe in the universal Catholic
religion as taught us by our Priests, and. since we are not permitted
to believe, nor to openly follow any other religious practice, we
must, therefore, keep these, our meetings, secret from henceforth,
admitting to our meetings only such as are well fitted to become
brethren with us.
Thus we find that we must subscribe to a set of rules to govern
us, and all who would join us must take oath to follow these rules
throughout their lives, and to keep all things secret.
We believe that the Book of Revelation is written both within
ami without, and that it contains the secrets of true Alchemy and
all Mystical wisdom. It shall be the duty of the brethren, both in
our secret meetings and when alone, to study this book and seek
its hidden meaning. We believe that the Pope is anti-Christ and
only a man of sin like unto ourselves, and that he is no more holy
or divine than Mahomet or any of the Prophets. We believe that
all men should be free to follow the religious belief of their choice,
without hindrance and without interference.
Also, like unto our Brother Paracelsus, it shall be our duty and
our aim to search for:
First. The secret of the transmutation of metals, or the Mag­
num opus, and apply to chemistry the usages of Kabbalism and of
ancient astrology.
Second. The Universal Medicine, which includes the Cathnlieon,
or Elixir of Life, and the Panacea, the first insuring to its posses­
sor the prolongation or perpetuity of existence, the second restor­
ing strength and health to debilitated or diseased organisms.
Third. The Philosopher's Stone, the great and universal syn­
thesis which conferred upon the Adept a more sublime knowledge
than that of transmutation or of the Great Elixir, but on which
both depend.
RULES
1. The membership of the Order shall not be limited. All men
10
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
who arc able to prove themselves worthy and arc willing to take
upon themselves the Oath of Silence may join with us.
2. The initiation of Catholics shall be allowed. No man shall
be permitted to question another concerning his religious faith.
The Catholic shall not become a member us a Catholic, but as a
man. Neither religion, matters of state, nor personalities shall
be discussed from our platform. Men of all creeds and colors may
hccomc one with us so long as they are men.
3. The Master shall keep the name and address of every mem­
ber on a special list so that he may know where to find each in case
of need. One brother shall always be welcomed by another, but
no visitation shall be longer than twenty-four hours, lest inhar-
inonv prevail.
4. If three or more brothers meet together, they shall not be
empowered to elect a new member without the permission of the
Master, unless such authority had been previously conferred upon
them. The Master alone shall have power to accept a new mem­
ber.
5. The newly received member shall obey such Master until the
death of that Master or the selection of a new Master, when his
allegiance is automatically transferred to the new Master.
6. A father may not elect his son as a member of the Order.
The son should be elected by a committee appointed by the Master.
7. Although many brothers may live in a city they may not make
a brother, nor take one as their neophyte unless the Master give
them full permission to do so. In all cases the applicant must first
make application to the Master by giving his full name, country,
occupation and other necessary information concerning himself.
The Master will then choose his teacher.
8. Immediately after a brother has been accepted as an Acolyte
by the Order lie shall begin his study and training. He must first
make oath to God, pledging himself not to use his secret art to
offend God, nor to corrupt or destroy the empire (state), nor to
become a tyrant through ambition or for other reasons, but always
to appear humble, invariably asserting that the existence of such
a secret art is only proclaimed by charlatans.
9. It is absolutely forbidden to make extracts from the secret
writings or to have them printed, without permission from the
Master; it is also forbidden the members to sign with the names
or characters of any brother. It is forbidden, and punishable by
death, for any brother to speak or write against a brother, the
11
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
Arts, or the Order.
10. The Brethren may be allowed to produce the works of the
Order and to discuss the secret writings only in well closed rooms,
where no one but a brother may hear. Each brother must first give
the sign of the degree to which he belongs.
11. It is not permitted for one brother to teach the secret of the
Elixir of Youth to another until such other has proven, beyond a
doubt, that he is worthy of the possession of such secret, and has
the strength to resist using the secrets in an illegitimate manner for
an unholy purpose.
12. It is not permissible for a brother to kneel before anyone
under any circumstance except when taking the Oath of Allegiance
or before the Supreme God in secret prayer.
13. The brethren shall neither talk much nor shall they marry
as other men do. Yet it shall be lawful for a brother to take wife
and live with her in mystical marriage.
14. Brethren shall not stir up hatred or discord among men.
They shall refrain from discourses on religion lest this be the cause
of hatred and resentment. Should it be the desire of a brother to
write a thesis on the subject, he may obtain permission from the
Master, and, in such instance, be under the protection of the Order,
provided only that such discourse be in harmony with the teachings
of the Order.
15. A brother possessing the secret of the Elixir of Life shall
not give of the same to any profane to lengthen life, irrespective
of what he be offered in return. To do so, is to call upon himself
the curse of the Elemental Spirits.
16. Because many brethren may live in a city, it is not permitted
them that they force their opinion upon anyone. They may teach
the true Art of Living, but only to such as arc ready and willing
to hear. In the sight of the Brotherhood, all men are free in
affairs of faith.
17. Should a brother desire to move to, or travel in, another
country, it is requested of him that he so inform the Master and
that he give the name of such country, and the name under which
he will be known there. Should he fail to do this, he will forfeit
all claim to the Brotherhood.
18. A brother shall not carry with him any printed or written
description of the Secret Arts, but, should this become necessary,
it must be so written, or printed, in characters, that no one but him­
self be able to read it. The key must always be kept separate from
12
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
the writing.
19. Should a brother who travels much or who takes active part
in the affairs of government become known as a member of the
Order to those who do not belong to it, he shall take such steps as
may be necessary to assure his safety, even to the denial of his
connection with the Brotherhood.
TH E OATH
“ I , ---------------------------. do solemnly swear by the eternal and
living God not to make known the secrets which have been com­
municated to me, to anyone outside of our Order. I further swear,
before God, not to reveal any of the secret writings which may be
entrusted to me during my natural term of life. Should I, at any
time, leave the Order, or be expelled therefrom for any cause, I
swear, by all that is holy and terrible, that I will thereafter, as now,
hold all such teachings as secret, and that I will never, by word of
mouth, or by writing, or in any other way, betray the trust which
was placed in me. I further swear that I will never betray, or con­
vey to another, a secret entrusted to me by a brother, but will hold
such secret as sacred, even though I may leave the Order. Should
I, at any time, reveal such secret, I shall willingly forfeit my right
to life. I further swear that I will not reveal, even under punish­
ment, curtailment of liberty, or under torture, anything concerning
the Order, the name of the Master, or the location of the Inner
Temple. I promise to keep eternally silent, by peril of my life, as
God is my judge."
TH E CREED OF TH E ORDER
"Only those who arc pure-minded and spiritual can possess true
magical powers. Thought is the supreme power in man, and pure
spiritual thought is the miracle-worker within him. If the thought
and desire of man be bound in the flesh, deeply amalgamated with
it and occupied with animal desires, it loses its power over the
divine elements, and therefore of those who seek to exercise
magical powers there are few who can succeed.
"If we desire to become spiritually developed, as is the desire
of each member of the Order, we must try and find out how we
can free ourselves of our animal instincts and propensities, and
become rid of our sensuality and passions. We must, furthermore,
attempt to rise up to a state of true spirituality. Without accom­
plishing these two propositions we will never rise up to that state
13
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
which is necessary to obtain the magical powers which result from
the spiritual elevation and dignity of man.
“Wc must therefore attempt to remove all external things
which are in the way of our spiritual development, and to live in
a state of purity. Our thoughts must be continually directed in­
ward and tcilhin ourselves: for tvilhiu ourselves is the clement of
consciousness, knowledge and power. Nothing hinders us from
developing ami exercising our own powers except our okh miscon­
ceptions, imaginations, and external desires. Therefore, the di­
vine influence will only come to him who liberates his Soul of all
such hindrances, carnal desires, prejudices and hallucinations. .!
disrated rye cannot bear lo look al Ihr I.iijhl; an impure Soul is
repulsed by the divine light of Truth."
SECOND MANIFESTO
O rd e r M ilitia C r u c if e r a E v a n g e lic a
L unenburg, 1598
In consequence of the power of the church and the Holy Inqui­
sition over the inhabitants of this country, a power which has been
abused in a horrible manner, it has become necessary that wc shall
be not only a secret society, but that we shall be an Order for, and
of. defense: that we shall have places where we can meet secretly
and exchange our opinions and researches without being overheard
by spies and traitors: where we may instruct our secret agents in
their leadership of the people against the Holy Inquisition.
Henceforth, those who seek admittance to our ranks must not only
be true students of the Occult but they must likewise be desirous
of receiving the priceless book of liberty of conscience, and of
avoiding clerical persecution.
After almost three-quarters of a century we find that we are
still of our former beliefs and that we hold to our articles of
faith. Many new discoveries have been made by our members,
and these, with such additional rules as we find necessary, shall
now be incorporated in this, our Second Manifesto.
Our system of religious truth, the original esoteric Christianity,
is not a popular one, nor is it a religion for the vulgar. It is a
system of philosophy, given us in symbolism, and comprehensible
only by those who have found the key. It is our duty to give such
portions to the people as they can appreciate and apply, but the
14
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
whole philosophy may he given only to those who are ready to
receive it.
Our science embraces a knowledge of the most sublime and ex­
alted truths, the deepest mysteries in nature, the knowledge of
the nature of matter and energy, of the attributes and qualities of
all things. By uniting the powers of nature and combining the
lower with the higher the most surprising effects may be produced.
This science is therefore the highest and most perfect of all; it is
a sacred and exalted philosophy, the culminating point of all. We
know this science as Magic.
The Natural Soul is the link by which the Spirit becomes united
with the flesh ami the body, through which the latter lives and acts
and exercises its functions. This link is intelligent, but also cor­
poreal ; or perhaps more correctly, the Soul takes part in the
materiality of the physical body. This is the doctrine of all the
Hermetic Philosophers. Man consists of the higher, of the inter­
mediary, and of the lower principles. He is a perfect Trinity
when properly developed. The higher ones are of the Illuminated
Spiritual Soul, and this is what “God breathed into the nostrils of
man and he became a Living Soul.” It is the Fire of God. The
lower ones are of the animal soul. The intermediate principle is
the rational soul which connects the animal soul with the Divine,
and takes part in the natures of both extremes. It is the silver
cord of the Philosophers.
We have found that man’s power to think increases in propor­
tion as the Ethereal and Celestial power of Light penetrates his
mind, and strengthens his mental faculties. It may enable him to
see and perceive that which he interiorly thinks, just as if it were
objective and eternal. Spirit being independent of our ideas of
space, and all men having essentially the same spirit, the Souls of
men existing at places widely distant from each other may thus
enter into communication and converse with each other exactly in
the same manner as if they had met in their physical bodies. In
this state man may perform a great many things in an exceedingly
short period of time, so that it may seem as if he had required no
time at all to perform them. Only such as those who possess a
strong imagination and whose power of will is strong can do this.
All brethren may, by following our arcane instructions, develop
both the Imagination and the Will to develop into Masters.
While we believe that all men have identical spirits, we do not
believe in the erroneous teachings that men arc all equal, because
15
O R D E R MI LI TI A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
the majority arc so hard and sinful that it will take many re-incar­
nations before they may become equal. We believe that all men
belonging to our Order love God and seek to please Him, but
even these are not equal, one to the other, because men are in
different stages of spiritual growth and Soul enlightenment.
We do not believe in “death" or that anything really dies. We
hold with the teachings of the thrice-wise Hermes, that every­
thing is merely in a stage of transition. The Soul of man leaves
his body at intervals, but this is a change from one stage to another
and not an actual death. Nothing is annihilated.
RULES, OBLIGATIONS AND PROFESSIONS
1. I will always, insofar as lies in my power, act only as is be­
coming a worthy member of the Order. I shall, throughout the
days of my life, be grateful to the one who first helped me on the
Path to become a member of the Order.
2. That the name of the Order may be protected, I will, under
no circumstances, unless permitted or ordered to do so, profess
that I am a member, nor will I reveal the name of any person
whom I know to be connected with the Order.
3. I promise that I will at once begin the work placed before
me and that I shall, with the help of God, continue such work dur­
ing my whole life. I shall keep all instructions conveyed to me as
secret and rather lose my life and SAVE M y Soul than reveal any­
thing which may be intrusted to me by cither the Master or a
member of our august Fraternity.
4. I will communicate every new or useful discovery relating to
the Work to the Master, or to the member appointed by the Mas­
ter to receive such information, and will conceal nothing from such
person, knowing that as a worthy member he cannot betray or
abuse the confidence placed in him by me.
5. I promise that should 1 become aware of any plot against the
Order, or against any member thereof, I will at once report such
to the Master, and if possible protect the brother against whom
such plot is designed.
6. 1 further promise that I will never, so long as 1 remain in my
proper mind, accuse a brother of wrong. Should I have any reason
to suspect a brother, I will report the matter to the Master and
offer the brother an opportunity to vindicate himself. I agree
that I will abide by the decision of the Master and attempt no
appeal therefrom. I further agree that should I accuse the
16
O R D E R MI L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVANGELI CA
brother before placing the matter before him I shall be held
responsible and may be expelled from the Order for conduct un­
becoming a member.
7. Should I travel and meet one 1 have reason to believe is a
brother, I will first test him by the proper examination as instructed
in the secret work, before conveying any information to him.
Should I find that he is my superior, I will accordingly honor and
respect him.
8. Should I be able to accomplish the Work, I will thank God
for giving me the strength and the opportunity and will honor the
brother who so kindly indicated the Path to me. I will devote my
time to the pursuit of knowledge and doing all the good that lies
in my power.
9. In all my dealings with men, I will be impartial and just. I
will try at all times to do unto others as I would have them do
unto me. I will sow the seeds of love, kindness and charity, so
that wisdom and peace of mind may follow me all the days of
my life.
10. I solemnly promise that 1 will, so far as lies in my power,
discourage all wickedness and wrongdoing and frown upon all
acts which arc an offense to God. I engage upon my Soul that no
woman shall ever go wrong through my agency and that I will pro­
tect the weak to the full extent of my ability.
11. Should my connection with the Order be discovered by one
in power, I faithfully promise that I will sooner die than to con­
nect him with, or help initiate him or reveal to him, the secrets of
the Order. Should I find him worthy and willing to be bound by
the Laws of the Order I will instruct him in his duty as a member
and help him to the Path which will ultimately make him one
with us.
12. Neither married man nor woman shall be accepted as a
member on first application. Should they insist, however, and be
found worthy, they may be elected, provided they arc willing to
take special oath to keep silent on all matters pertaining to the
Order, its members and its teachings.
1.1. By appealing to the Master, brothers may be given special
names, and such names shall be placed on the record of the Order.
In conversation or in correspondence, such brothers may use their
initiate names and thus remain unknown to the profane. Both the
proper name and the initiate name may never be written in the
same communication. This is expressly forbidden by all the
17
O R D E R M I L I T I A C R U C I F E R A E V A N G E L I C A
132 MILITIA CRUCIFERA EVANGELICA
not only in the best of standing with the Order but,
that they were also high Masons or members of the
Illuminati. Arrangements were made, satisfactory
to both sides, and a charter granted by the Supreme
Grand Lodge for the establishment of the Order in
America, and, also, covering the entire Western
World. It was also arranged that all members of
the Order in the Western World should henceforth
pay homage to the Western branch. The first

est, aspiring man or woman; but neither earthly king nor one of
lesser power can gain admission by reason of his position, station
or influence. Manhood and womanhood are the sole test for
admission.
TH E OATH
I, --------------- ,ofmy own free will and accord, in the
presence of Almighty God and my brethren, do hereby most sol­
emnly and sincerely promise and swear, that I will not communi­
cate the secrets belonging to this Order to any person or persons,
except it be a true and lawful brother of higher degree.
I further promise and swear that I will willingly abide by all the
laws, rules and regulations of the Order as they are conveyed to me
by those in authority.
I further promise and swear that I will answer and obey all
signs and summons sent me from the Order, or handed to me by
a brother of the Order, and will carry out ail instructions to the
best of my ability.
I further promise and swear that I will not, under any circum­
stances, reveal any of the secrets conveyed to me, or that have
been placed in my care. I shall court death sooner than prove dis­
loyal in word or deed.
All this I most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with­
out any hesitation, mental reservation or secret hope of profit,
binding myself to the penalty of the traitor, which I know to be
death of body and Soul.
So help me God and lead me aright. Amen.

Count M . duSt. Vincent, Presiding
There are latent powers and almost infinite potentialities within
man, of which he has scarcely more than dreamed. Mere cultiva­
tion of the intellect will not reveal them. Though his by birth­
right, he may come into possession of them only through study and
19
O R D E R M I L I T I A C R U C I F E R A E V A N G E L I C A
application of the complete philosophy of nature and of man.
These universal and eternal truths may be obscured and seemingly
lost in one age by misinterpretation, persecution or ignorance, but
inevitably they appear again and again, rising like the Phoenix
from its own ashes. Hidden by the symbols of antiquity, they may
be revealed in all their grandeur and beauty only by the Perfect
Master of the Mysteries. They arc the Divine Ideal, concealed
in a block of unhewn stone which the inept artist assails with mallet
and chisel, square and compass, but to release a distorted image.
The Real Truth is to be found in the theme that runs through the
symphony of creation; in the lofty ideals that inspire the life of
man and that may lead him from the lowlands, where hover the
ghosts of superstition and fear, to the mountains in which he may
dwell in inspiration, peace and light.
The grandest wisdom ever known to man was concealed in the
Ancient Mysteries. It was expressed in a universal language of
symbolism, that it might be hidden from the profane, and yet
revealed to the initiate of all ages. This wisdom has never been
lost; always there have lived a few who possessed the Great Secret.
This ancient wisdom is the fountain-head from whence all of the
esoteric philosophies have risen. Many false interpretations have
been rendercil and numerous creeds and dogmas have developed—
various and fantastic as the unbridled imagination of each unpre­
pared and unauthorized investigator. True initiates possess the
Key, and when the search is guided by one who possesses the Key,
the complete philosophy of the Secret Doctrine unfolds and reveals
the ultimate meaning and purpose of human evolution. It is said
that the great Lodge of Adepts or Perfect Masters has never
ceased to exist, and that this Lodge, though secret and unknown,
has often shaped the course of empires and influenced the fate of
nations. It is believed that the process of evolution is now being
guided by those who know, as not before in many centuries. The
new cycle of liberation and enlightenment is dawning, and to those
who are ready and to those who seek for the pearls of truth the
Way is open. An ever-increasing number is seeking more Light.
“Light Comes From the East." It is ordained that the philosophy
of the East shall illuminate the science of the West and dispel the
darkness of the materialism of the western world.
The Occult Philosophy of the Ancient Mysteries is recognized
by us as the Godmother and progenitor of all intellectual forces.
Queen of Society, in her hands she holds the Key to all divine
20
O R D E R M I L I T I A C R U C I F E R A E V A N G E L IC A
obscurities. Toward this higher knowledge all useful and rational
development tends. All systems of education, of culture and of
religion, that aspire to the highest, inevitably reach those limita­
tions which may be overcome only as the Ancient Mysteries guide
the way. The Higher Knowledge is the Knowledge of the Soul.
It concerns the origin, the nature, the powers and the laws that
govern the evolution of the Soul. It is a wisdom that ancient
science taught in the mysteries of antiquity in the ages long past.
Behind the veil of all mystical allegories, beneath the ordeal of
initiation, under the seal of all sacred writings, in the symbols of
the old art of alchemy, in the secret mysteries of the Bible, in the
ceremonies of all secret societies, may be found the traces of a
principle, carefully concealed always and everywhere the same,
differing only in expression. To revive the ancient wisdom is to
recover the Lost Word and to facilitate and hasten universal prog­
ress and the attainment of the Brotherhood of Man, but these
secrets must be sought by the individual himself, for the Law is
that every man must work out his own salvation. All evolution
and regeneration is from within and it consists of an orderly un­
folding of the natural powers of the individual, that he shall
become the very thing that he desires to possess. All life is an-
evolution; all real knowledge is initiation, and both proceed in
natural order by specific degrees. The candidate for initiation in
the Ancient Mysteries must be “worthy and well qualified, duly and
truly prepared." He must fee! that a realm of knowledge exists
beyond the perception of his senses, and that knowledge he must
desire intensely to possess. He must have passed beyond the stage
of blind belief, of superstition and of fable, and he must seek to
free himself from the bondage of fear and of appetite and of sense
and he must demonstrate the desire to use his knowledge and his
power for the good of himself and of others rather than for selfish
or destructive purposes.
The purpose of initiation is to free the ego from the dominion
of the appetite and the passions of the lower nature and thus to
bring the operations of the body under the dominion of the will.
This is mastery of self and through it finally is attained peace,
clarity of vision, and spiritual discernment.
The lost word for which man seeks concerns the science of rhyth­
mic vibration, and it is the key to the equilibrium of all forces and
to the harmony of eternal nature. It is the key to the science of
magic, and through it is opened a philosophy as boundless as
21
O R D E R M I L I T I A C R L ' C I F E R A E V A N G E L I C A
Cosmos,* as inexhaustible as time and as beneficent as the “Father
in Heaven." There exists now as there has existed through all
the past a real and potent Magic; its secret constitutes the science
of good and evil. The understanding of the science of Magic is
the most precious gift of divine providence. It is the mysterious
**kev that opens to our dazzled intelligence the world of truth
and light and joins the finite with the Infinite. It is the basis of
that secret philosophy for which Democrates, Hermes, Plato and
Pythagoras travelled to Egypt. Invisible to the senses, it must be
studied with the vision of the Soul, and it can only be sensed and
understood in the Light of Illumination. One of its principal vir­
tues is its generative power, for which the sacred name is regencr-
tiling fire, a principle jealously guarded by all true occult frater­
nities. Soul of the world, permeating all nature, it is the essence
and vital spark of all it animates.
The underlying aims, principles and purposes of the Order
M ilitia Crccifura Evangelica are essentially those of its tra­
dition. Its expression is twofold; it seeks to draw within the
bounds of true fraternity those whose mutual aspirations are con­
sistent with its higher teaching and to instruct them further in the
regal philosophy which it has preserved. The landmarks serve to
guide and protect its members who aspire to the Ancient Wisdom,
but today, as of old, the very nature of its teaching impresses the
obligation of serving in a true sense as a Militia. The expression
of intolerance, bigotry and prejudice changes its form from one
era to another, hut it is stalking amongst us today as of old, ever
ready to force man into a conformity that defies his God-given
heritage of free will. The Militia again must work to defeat these
• Among the -acred hook- of the Bible there are two which the church ha- made
little claim to under-rand and ha- never attempted to explain; these arc the prophecy of
Ezekiel and the Book of Revelation-, two Kabbalistic keys perfectly plain to the initiate
in occult science. There i« another hook which i- of all the mo-t occult and unknown.
It is the “key" to all the others. This work is still preserved onmutilated and in
primeval characters, on detached leaves, like the tablets of the ancients. This hook
i- the sum of all the sciences and can resolve all problems by its inhnitc combinations.
The church, whose special ollicc is supposed to be the custody of the keys, does not
pretend to possess those of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse, and many Christians suppose
that the scientific and magical clavicles of Solomon have been lost; but nothin); which
has existed can perish.
** Moses depicts it under the figure „f a tree which is in thr erntrr of the terrestrial
paradise, in proximity to the Tree of Life, and hat a radial connection therewith: at
the foot of the tree is the source of the mysterious rivers; it is guarded by the sword
of fire and by the four figures of the biblical Sphinx, the Cherubim of Ezekiel.

destructive forces, that man may not be deprived of the freedom
which is his and for which he has fought so long. It is firmly
established in the western world as a constructive agency, and it
remains in direct communication with the Supreme Order in the
East. The Supreme Council continues in secret, but each brother
may, if he will, fulfill his duty, effect direct contact with the Coun­
cil and its initiate members.
The fundamental purpose of the Order is to aid in the establish­
ment of the true universal Brotherhood of Man on earth, that all
beings may be assisted to a higher expression of life.
Through its aid members who arc worthy, and only those who
arc worthy, may develop the powers of Soul.
Through the guidance of its philosophy its members are taught
to express and control the innate powers of the Soul, that they
may gradually accomplish the elimination from their lives of error,
disease and evil.
The Order teaches the true secrets of ancient alchemy, that the
acolyte may ultimately manifest the potentialities of the macrocosm
in his own microcosm, and in truth become a manifestation of the
world in miniature.
The Order seeks to establish a Brotherhood whose bonds are
those of mutual love and of ministration, that Soul communion
may become a source of mental exaltation and spiritual realization.
It accepts its responsibilities to uncover hypocrisy, charlatanry,
intolerance and exploitation, and to deal with them fearlessly.
As the sun rises in the East to open and govern the day, so rises
knowledge in the East to illuminate and govern the minds of men.
The character, origin and modes of thought of the order as con­
cern the Soul arc recognized as coming from the East.

We now, more than ever, should look toward the spirit of
Truth, that we may become free from the bondage with which the
bigotry, pride and love of power of the age would enslave us.
Many of those who have acclaimed themselves leaders, whether
in spiritual, political or social affairs, arc in truth interested not in
the welfare of the nation and of their fcllowmcn, but only in self-

"While the vast majority of men are in far greater
ignorance, at the present age, concerning Spiritual
matters, than have been the people of any past age,
it is also true that they are more serious in their •
hunt after the mil in life and are therefore open to
instructions. Happy are they who find the truth
and are fed on bread instead of receiving stones.
We cannot at thia day, give men a lot of things and
tell them to pick out that which is good, we must
take them as a child who is learning to eat, start
them at the beginning, and give them the Spiritual
’nod as fast as they can assimilate it.
It is for this reason, that Mystic Orders, be they
good or bad, are attracting thousands upon thou­
sands of men and women, and are able to make them
as unto themselves, either good or bad, or throw
them into utter despair. Happy is he who may be
able to lead but one out of darkness, for surely his
labor has not been in vain.
After the First Manifesto had been issued by
the Order, there was a demand for more light con-

glorification and sordid gain. The bigot, by virtue of the arro­
gance which he expresses in his leadership, draws from men the
very essence of their character and reduces them to a servitude
from which it is more difficult for them to free themselves than
from physical shackles. That these false leaders, in the blind
faith of dogma and creed, ultimately must suffer in terms of humili­
ation for their presumption does not relieve their followers from
the limitation with which their liberties have been enshrouded.
Belief in the infallibility of religious and social leadership must
be broken or the ideals of the Freedom of Man and of Universal
Brotherhood will be but empty dreams. Men have thought that
because they hold membership in an established church they have
fulfilled all that is necessary to pass the scrutiny of the One who
views all things with justice and equity. Man’s true Master is
His Conscience, and no one, regardless of his own self-approval
or the approval in which he is held by his fcllowmen, should dare
hope to escape the judgment. The Conscience is the avenging
angel recognized by the Egyptians. It is The Great Book upon
which is written all that man enacts, and each Soul must read ITS
O H'S RECORD.
To deliver oneself to the blind leadership of another is a form
of weakness, through which man is robbed of the God-given right
of free will and is reduced to slavery. The true nature of
man is manifested in love, in peace, in graciousness, in kindness.
These qualities are only to be found in the Path to which we were
guided by the first Master. It is the Path that leads to Greatness
of the Soul and through which may be found Life and Light and
Love. It alone points the Way through which man can come to
live in harmony with the laws of nature and reap the fruits thereof.
“Ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you free.”
Physically, mentally, spiritually, life may be enjoyed to its utmost,
free from remorse and sin and misery- and the sorrows that have
been the lot of men. "As ye do unto others, so will it ultimately
he done unto you." As we forgive, so are we forgiven. Evil can
be overcome only by the power of good. True superiority is proven
by the use of a force, motivated by kindliness and love, fused with
justice.
Through the Illumination of Man’s Inner Temple, and through
the awakening of the intuitive faculties to the perceptions of the
great truths of life, which lie beyond the objective senses, may be
found the ancient and royal road across the Threshold, to health,
25
O R D E R MI LI TI A C R U C I F E R A E VANGEL I CA
happiness, peace and immortality.
Those who may inherit the fullness of the promise, through
which may be found the salvation of the body, the spirit, and the
Soul, must trust in the Law and live it.
The words that were spoken to the early fathers were intended
as well for their children unto many generations, for the vision
could be seen by them only in part. In the new world and in the
New Age, there is much of the early vision from which the veil
that has obscured it may now be drawn. Behind the veil of the
mystical allegories of the ancient doctrines, under the seal of the
sacred writings, in the inspired pages of the Vedas, are found the
traces of Magic. The Bible is filled with mystic lore, the secrets
of which arc hidden from the profane through allegory and mystic
symbol, but revealed to the initiate who possesses the Key. The
Christianity of the Gnostic fathers was but initiation into the mys­
teries anti their teachings, and though obscured by creed and
dogma, the early teachings have been guarded and preserved by
those who refused to bend the knee at the altars which would rob
the arcane teachings of their true spirit. Mysticism and its initi­
atory expressions reigned in Persia with the Magi; it endowed
India with its most priceless tradition: it concealed, in the calcula­
tions of Pythagoras, the principles of all science and of all intel­
lectual progress. It is the essence of the four secret sciences, magic,
alchemy, occult-medicine. Cosmic Law. To the true initiate the
"Philosophers' Stone," “The Elixir Vita," “the famous Universal
Solvent." all are spiritual works that belong to the realm of Soul.
True Philosophy seeks to solve rather than deny. We hear the
modern materialist and religionist jeer at the “absurdities" of
Magic anti laugh at the dreams of the alchemist, but sincere re­
search will prove that many of the greatest discoveries of science
have had their roots in the discoveries and demonstrations of the
alchemist, and the key to their mystic phraseology still may open
the door to other and nobler achievements, for they studied deeply
grand laws of nature, concerning which modern man, with all of
his boasted advancement, knows little or nothing. The modern
scientist is filled with theory, argument, conjecture and assumption
concerning matter and its effects, but in spite of his imperfect
knowledge governing the laws of nature, he stubbornly refuses to
delve into that mysterious realm in which matter is given substance.
The alchemist, not the chemist; the mystic, not the materialist,
holds the keys to the doors of life's great mysteries. The Brother-
26
O R D If. R M I L I T I A C R U C I F E RA EVAN G E L I CA
hood seeks to develop the powers of the Soul lying dormant in
man and to bring man to a true understanding of the laws of
nature, through instruction in that which has to do with the body,
the will, and the Soul. Magic is a science of Universal Law, and
it may be understood as man learns the Law, for it underlies all
human action and the consequent reward and penalty. The Order
confers such knowledge upon those who prove themselves worthy
and qualified to receive it. It seeks to unite those of earnest pur­
pose into a Brotherhood that they may work harmoniously to­
gether to the same purpose as that of true Christianity—to lift
the fallen, to heal the sick, to clothe the naked, and to bind up
the wounds of the afflicted.
Before being born into matter, man was of the Spirit, a lumi­
nous emanation from the Great Soul. Under the Law, this spark
from the Divine was drawn to the process of evolution that
through the development of that which was embryonic, self-con­
sciousness, immortality, individualization and perfection might be
accomplished. In the primordial condition of planetar)’ life, earth
was not ready for the advent of man, for he could appear only
as the climax of animated being. The earth underwent great
ages of preparation and growth and matter was refined by many
generations of births and deaths in the vegetable and animal king­
doms before conditions were provided through which man could
sustain himself and secure the experiences necessary for his
development.
The Divine principle of Soul which was man, before his mate­
rial experience, survives all change and is subject to neither decay
nor disintegration. It is through this Deific Spark that man the
creature is united with the Creator. Surrounding this Divine
Essence, forming, as it were, a garment, is the Spiritual body,
composed of that subtle and refined element which in its action,
through organic bodies, is Life, and in its effect, Force. It is well
termed “the regenerating fire,” for in its all-pervading influence
throughout the realms of space it is fire. This is the second of
that grand trinity of principles, the union of which constitutes man
a Living Being while on earth. Universal Spirit permeating all
space, Soul of the world, it is the vital spark of all it animates. In
this principle lies the secret of all expression of spiritual, occult or
mystic power, for through it is animated all orders of being. The
Soul is like its source, the central sun of being, in its nature and
essence a spiritual light, pure and unalloyed. It is the invisible
27
O R D E R MI LI TI A C R U C I F E R A E VANGEL I CA
and infinitely sublimated Spirit of Fire, that wonderful innermost
Light, which, while it reveals and proves all things, in its own
manifestation is itself invisible, unknown, uncomprehended. The
Universe is the Macrocosm or greater world; Man is the Micro­
cosm. or little world. Man is the image of all objective forms,
the embodiment of all subjective ideas, and the connecting link
between existing things, higher and lower than himself. Man is a
trinity A-body, spirit and Soul. His body is the conservator of
all the powers and functions of matter. His spirit, which is the
animating principle, is made up of all the forces called “Life.”
His Soul is the pure Deific and Immortal Essence, whose attributes
arc will, intelligence and love.

injustice, wickedness, in any form or of any nature.
I shall refrain from stirring up hatred and discord, and so far

ADDENDUM
The statements made in the Announcement herewith reproduced
arc entirely consistent with previous misrepresentations from the
same source. For a number of years H. Spencer Lewis has been
guilty of the same type of plagiarism and unwarranted distortion
of fact as that embodied in nearly ever}' statement in this an­
nouncement. In the present publication we are not interested in
dealing with the many offenses of which Mr. Lewis is guilty against
orders of legitimate lineage, other than the one now under dis­
cussion. Mr. Lewis chose to appropriate the O .’.M .'.C .-.E .•.
as of the date of the announcement— November, 1933. Since the
Order has been in existence and publicly active in America with
official headquarters since 1902. it is quite evident that in this
instance the accusation of plagiarism is fully justified. The details
of the article arc so obviously a fabrication that it scarcely merits
further emphasis. However, in passing, it is interesting to observe
the statement that: “The Militia Crucifera Evangelica was origi­
nally formed as a special group of the ‘Knights of the Temple,’ who
were Rosicrucians, and the organization became a secret Rosicru­
cian body throughout the whole of Europe" and the further state­
ment that “the plans of the Militia in North America were spon­
sored by the Mystic Templars of Europe, and the only authorized
branch of the Militia in North America is under the immediate
direction of our Imperator, H. Spencer Lewis, who is the ‘Gener­
alissimo.’ ’’
The “Mystic Templars” have no existence except in the mind of
Mr. Lewis, unless he has reference to the O. T. O.—Order Ori­
ental Templars—which came into existence through Alcister
Crowley in 1912, nor is there any record of such an organization
to his activity. The “Militia" came into existence long years
Bi-fore the term, title or appellation Rosicrucian was coined.
The Rosicrucians have ever been a separate and distinct body of
men. The Order of the “Knights of the Temple” was solely for
Christian conquest. It was in no way connected with cither the
M ilitia or the Rosicrucian Order or Fraternity, and, of course,
is long since extinct.
Mr. Lewis in the present instance follows his usual—one might
31
O R D E R M I L I T I A C R U C I F E R A EVAN G E L I CA
truthfully say—his habitual practice. He establishes false author­
ity through lineage from a mythical European agency. H. Spencer
Lewis has no more legitimate right to the use of the name or
Order Militia Crucifera Evangelica than lie has to the use
of the numerous variations of the appellations "Rosy Cross” or
“ Rosicrucian." We accuse him of a deliberate and open violation
of all fraternal laws, moral and spiritual precepts. In the pres­
ent instance he is once again guilty of plagiarism, and with the
deepest sincerity of intent and purpose we urge the reader to
establish the facts for himself.
The M . ' . C . ' . E . * . was established in America in 1902 and
first Manifesto issued. The second Manifesto was issued in 1903.
In 1905 the Order published a handbook prepared by the Count
M. deSt. Vincent, which contained all the various Manifestoes
published up to that date, and this handbook also included part
of the philosophy as taught by the Order.
On January 10. 1934. the Militia Crucifera Evangelica
registered its name in the State of Pennsylvania for the first time
in any State or Country, thus preempting the name against in­
fringement.
In 1909 the Militia became a member of the Royal Fraternity
Association, and this Charter was filed in the State of California
on March S, 1928* and thereby protected against infringement
in that State. Finally, on the 20th day of March, 1935, the
Militia Ckccifera Evangelica was registered in the State of
California as a separate body under the Laws of that State
approved May 16, 1933, and is therefore protected by prior use
and preemption against all infringement.
These statements may readily be verified by anyone who will
take the time to investigate.
