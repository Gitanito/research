    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 World Theosophy.
 A Journal Devoted to the Art of Living.
 1931--1933  Monthly
 Hollywood, CA.  Publisher: Henry Hotchener.  Editor: Marie R. Hotchener.
 Succeeds: Theosophist (published by Hotchener from Hollywood, 1930)
  1/1, January 1931-1933.  86 pp., $3.50 a year.  From January through December 1930

 	 Hotchener took over publication of the Theosophist from Annie Besant in Adyar, publishing it from Hollywood "on [Besant's] behalf."  During the same period, Besant published what was called the Adyar Theosophist from India, and then in January 1931 resumed control and published the journal under the original title from Adyar, while Hotchener renamed her journal World Theosophy.  The journal played a prominent role in the "fraternization movement" initiated by Gottfried De Purucker (Point Loma) to unite "real Theosophists" of whatever background.   On Hotchener generally, see the note under the Channel.  Contributions by the usual Adyar Theosophists, including Bishop C.W. Leadbeater, George Arundale, C. Jinarajadasa, et al.
