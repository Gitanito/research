it&#39;s got on the radar of the
intelligence community and they knew
that we had come across the rosetta
stone of contacting and communicating
with interstellar civilizations and it
worked that is what started the
intelligence community coming after what
we were saying and doing and trying to
intercept it this is in fact cosmic
disobedience on a grand scale we&#39;re
gonna bypass the sociopaths in these
covert programs and do this directly
it&#39;s the same thing with the civil
rights movement the civil rights
movement would have never happened from
the top down even the Kennedy brothers
did not want to step into that mess it
took a mass of people not just Martin
Luther King but millions of people all
over the country doing sit-ins and lunch
counter sit-ins and buses and
what-have-you to change that direction
of our civilization out of Jim Crow onto
a spoke society that is well not perfect
inclu so than it was well the same has
to happen here and to do that we have to
understand what cosmic consciousness is
what the nature of the cosmic mind is
that is resonating within every single
human being because that&#39;s the
foundation for the relationship between
humans and these civilizations by doing
it directly all of us are going to know
what the truth is you don&#39;t have to go
through a proxy or someone who&#39;s telling
you Secondhand but it also creates a
movement globally to show these
civilizations that there are people on
this planet who are enlightened and
conscious and peaceful which is the
majority of humans because real
disclosure as humans making contact with
these civilizations directly and these
civilizations are waiting for us to do
it and so this is our opportunity this
is our moment and it really is we the
people that have to do it
