INTRODUCTION.
During a very considerable space, it was one of
the uses of prophecy, to warn against that which
was evil in itself or in its consequences ; and to di
rect on occasions of perplexity and danger. Is it
not entirely consonant to the spirit of the prophet
ical writings, and to the character of variety ob
servable in the Divine government, to suppose that
similar beneficent objects were intended to be ac
complished, in later periods.
The splendid series of prophecies relating to
the diffusion of Christianity, its triumphs over all
enemies, and universal prevalence, and to the glo
rious days of the church, seem more than sufficient
for the purpose of furnishing a peculiar kind of evi
dence of the truth of the scriptures.
That the prophetical promises were also given,
to comfort and encourage believers, in times of
trouble, will be generally conceded. But the ques
tion, whether the import of prophecy can be un
derstood circumstantially, so as to admit of its di
recting in the affairs of nations, though of great
moment, is still undetermined. .

IV INTRODUCTION.
How far these observations are appropriate, at
this time, I shall by no means decide. Perhaps
they would have been more so, had the entire
work, originally designed, been completed. This
was an exposition of prophecy, so far as relates to
times subsequent to the final dispersion of the Jews;
and which, without neglecting the least particular,
and without a single instance of forced construc
tion, should be consistent with itself, and with the
past history, and present state and prospects, of
the world. Such an exposition must be the true
one; at least, in all those particulars, which are con
firmed by frequent notice. The theory of chances
renders this, to all practical purposes, mathemati
cally certain. And it is a remarkable circum
stance, that although no two prophecies are limit
ed to the same particulars, all the important ones
are referred to, many times, as if in view of this
kind of evidence.
The preliminary difficulties were, as was sup
posed, all overcome; and very considerable pro
gress had been made in the execution of the work ;
when declining health rendered it less and less pro
bable, that the entire work would ever be com
pleted. Still, I was desirous of bringing forward,
under the warrant of inspiration, those momentous
truths, which, as was believed, it was a leading ob
ject of prophecy, at a fit period, to make known
to the world. For this purpose, I did not hesitate
to select the fortieth chapter of Ezekiel. No where
else is such a concentration of evidence to be

found ; though an immense body of proof, equally
conclusive, is diffused through the prophecies.
I request it may be borne in mind, that the fol
lowing exposition was written, as part of a com
prehensive work. This will be needful, to account
for the turn of the remarks, in various instances.
It is published, just as it was to have stood; in the
larger work. Some few additional notes are in
serted, for the purpose of explanation. It will rea
dily be apprehended, that, under such circum
stances, explanations may be required, though the
proofs cannot accompany. It was intended that
the different parts of the larger work should be
connected, and supported, by multiplied references ;
and it was in view of determinate reference, that
the figures were added in the margin. In the pre
sent publication, the place of all references to other
portions of the work, (whether originally made in
the text or in notes,) is indicated by an n, enclosed
in brackets, thus, [n]. This appeared needful, as
the language might otherwise seem abrupt, and the
statements gratuitous.
I have spoken of certain momentous truths,
which it was believed to be a leading object of pro
phecy, to make known to mankind. These are as
follows. That THE MILLENIUM IS TO BE BROUGHT
ABOUT, BY THE OVERTHROW OF THE INDIVIDUAL
SYSTEM; AND THE DIFFUSION OF THE SOCIAL SYS

Civil institutions are no less indispensable to the
reformation and well being of mankind, than reli
gious truth and ordinances. Accordingly, they
received a proportionate degree of attention, un
der the Mosaic dispensation. It will appear here
after, that the same is the case under that which
succeeded.
Whence has it happened, that Christianity has
done so little, as yet, towards improving the con
dition of man. Let us not deceive ourselves ;
Christianity has accomplished nothing, hitherto,
towards banishing crime; and little for the melio
ration of society. Of course, I speak in the na
tional aggregate. It should be recollected, that in
the most favored soil, somewhat after the manner
of pestilential diseases, new crimes have sprang
up, as the old ones disappeared. The statistics
of criminal justice inform us, that there is less of
crime in China, than in Christian nations. Though

INTRODUCTION. VII
the criminal code of China is in some respects se
vere, making capital, offences scarcely known as
such, in Europe, as striking a parent ; and although
their police is unrivalled ; the number of those who
suffer the punishment of death, is but about two
hundred annually; or perhaps one in a million.
Compared with this, the proportion of murders
alone, in some Christian countries, (Catholic,) is
more than a hundred to one.* Theft is so unu
sual, that except in the cities, bolts and bars are
scarcely known. Of course,, the morality of the
suburbs of Canton, is no criterion of that of the
empire at large. But I shall be reminded of their
infanticide. And what is the infanticide of China,
which in most cases has the plea of necessity, com
pared with the intemperance of Christian lands.
And even in the article of infanticide, let it not be
forgotten, that a species of this crime, more dan
gerous and pernicious in its consequences, and un
accompanied by the plea of necessity, is totally
disregarded by Christian legislators.f If we con
sider less favored heathen nations, we shall find
little reason to boast. More victims are immolated,
in a single year, at the shrine of fashion, scarcely
known as an " evil principle," in the heathen world,
where dress, and modes, and forms of society, never

try, in a century. And even the dreary horrors of
cannibal wars, will find a parallel, in a moral view
at least, in the cruelties of the slave ship, and the
modern atrocity of Burkism. But it will be urged,
that those of Christian nations, who pursue a life
of crime, are not Christians. And why is it so,
since all or the most of them, have had opportu
nities of Christian instruction. The reasons seem
to be. these: first, that Christianity has not been
presented, in its simplicity and purity ; and second,
that it has not been accompanied by those civil in
stitutions, (I use the term in its most extensive
sense,) which alone can render it uniformly effica
cious. The solemn realities of a future state of
being, can not be scanned by mortals ; but is it
presumptuous to suppose, that the above may ex
plain the cause, why, in the dealings of an infinitely
wise Providence, Christianity has been limited, hi
therto, to comparatively, so inconsiderable a por
tion of the globe.
The evidence in the chapter of Ezekiel, a com
ment upon which follows, of the downfall of the
individual system, is altogether indirect, but is not
the -less conclusive. It may not be amiss here,
however, to advert to some of a more direct cha
racter.

preciating the higher beauties of the sacred writ
ings, who read this chapter, regarding it as descrip
tive of the fall of papal Rome, without a suppress
ed consciousness, that the description is too long.
Instead of a graceful allusion to corrupt dealing,
the metaphor is extended (traffick in general, all
traffick,* being included?) into a sort of counting
house allegory, altogether disproportionate. But
considered as describing an entire change in the
formation, the external mechanism of society;
which would render the dwellings of men no longer
suitable for the purpose, and give a lasting check
to the pursuits of gain, the efforts of acquisition,

earn their bread, from day to day, by the sweat of
the brow, to the merchant, whose revenues are
those of a prince ; of a burning, which will catch
from village to village, from city to city, from con
tinent to continent, till the earth is wrapped in the
conflagration, and the recesses of the ocean are

fall, and of the deliverance of mankind ; render a
lengthened and expanded description, most highly
appropriate. But I am anticipating ; though with
some, the argument might safely be left here. To
others, evidence of a different description, will be
more satisfactory.
We learn, beyond doubt, in the fourteenth chap
ter of Revelation, that Babylon includes all man
kind. And Isaw another angel fly in the midst of
heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto
them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud
voice, Fear God, and give glory to him ; for the hour
of his judgment is come ; and worship him that made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
waters. And there followed another angel, saying,
Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because
she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of
her fornication. Rev. xiv ; 6—8. Little do they know,
of the unrivalled precision of the sacred writings,
and of their uniform adherence to the rules of just
criticism, who can believe, that verse 6 comprehends
all the nations of the earth, and verse 8, without
the slightest intimation of a change in the sphere
of agency, while similar general expressions are
used, but a limited portion of them. I am aware,
that verse 6 has been supposed to relate to the
diffusion of the scriptures, &c. accompanying the
reformation. But a slight attention to particulars
will show the fallacy of this supposition. It will be
admitted, by the advocates of the hypothesis, that

INTRODUCTION. XI
this chapter is intimately connected with chapter
thirteen ; and that the earth, in that chapter, desig
nates those nations, subject to papal domination ;
and that the term has the same general meaning,
inverse 6, of chapter fourteen. A more limited
construction is not, I believe, contended for, by
any ; but, whatever portion of the globe be meant,
the angel
is,
moreover, to preach the gospel to
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.
That
is,
to all other nations and descriptions
of
people. And accordingly, an angel, flying in the
midst
of
heaven, having the everlasting gospel to
preach to every nation
;
and saying, Fear God, and

;

These views are strikingly confirmed in chapters
seventeen and eighteen. The woman, or Babylon,
appears in the wilderness
;

a
wilderness, by
her enchantments, she has rendered all the world.
How many, alas, have felt themselves in a wilder

the beast, the woman also sits upon many waters ;
and that these are peoples, and multitudes, and na
tions, and tongues. When, therefore, it is said,
verse eighteen, And the woman which thou sawest is
that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the
earth, she is spoken of as sitting upon many wa
ters, no less than upon the beast ; and since there
is no limitation or exception whatever, the earth
must mean all the earth.* "We learn, moreover,
from this, that the city which reigneth over the kings
ofthe earth, is not any one city. We are led to ano
ther, and very curious result. The word city, in
its common acceptation, includes the surface, the
houses, the inhabitants and the valuables. In the
present case, however, it cannot include the sur
face, because the seven heads are a part of the
beast. It cannot include peoples, and multitudes,
fyc. because the woman is spoken of as sitting up
on them, no less than upon the seven hills. Each
is a substantive and independent statement. The
formality with which verse fifteen begins, is con
firmation of this, if confirmation were needed.
Nothing remains then, but the houses and the per
sonal property ; the most perfect representative of
the individual system, to be found.
In the next chapter, unless some intimation be
given, of a change in the meaning of the term the
earth, it will continue to be used in the sense

in verses sixteen and seventeen. That it does apply, in part, is the rea
son why these verses are placed after verse fifteen.

above. And not only is no such intimation given,
but, as might be expected, where the complete and
final- overthrow of Babylon is spoken of, the sense
above is confirmed. For all nations have drunk
of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the
kings of the earth have committed fornication
with her, and the merchants of the earth are
waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
Verse 3. Compare the last of the above> with the
following. And every shipmaster, and all the compa
ny in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by
sea, stood afar off, &c. Verse 17. Wherein were
made rich all that had ships in the sea, &c.
Verse 19. For thy merchants were the great men of
the earth ; for by thy sorceries were all nations de
ceived. Verse 23. In the twenty-fourth verse it is
said ; And in her was found the blood of prophets,
and ofsaints, and ofall that were slain upon the earth.
This must include all the earth, in the common
acceptation, and from the earliest ages. Such
language cannot be applied, even by the most ex
travagant hyperbole, to papal Rome. I fear not
to say, however, that applied to the individual sys
tem, it is literally true.
By all that were slain upon the earth must be in
tended, every one whose death is brought about
prematurely, by any other cause than the " act of
God," as it is technically termed. Had Noah and
his sons been enabled to establish a judicious so
cial organization, their descendants, attached to
its advantages, by habit and proscription, as well.

XIV INTRODUCTION.
as enlightened views, would no more have dream
ed of existing in the individual form of society,
than could one, at the present day, of fabricating a
cojnplex product of the arts, by the labors of one
rather than fifty ; by the desultory and ill appointed
efforts of families, rather than by the varied and
well practised skill, the all but intelligent machine
ry, and the unflagging impulse, of extensive facto
ries. Such an organization would have contained
within itself, the elements of perpetuity. One of
the first consequences would have been, that the
knowledge and worship of the true God, would not
have been lost. This alone would have gone very
far towards obviating the causes of premature
death ; and the latest dispensation, instead of a
sword, might have brought peace, had mankind
been differently prepared for its reception.
In the early, and indeed in advanced stages of
society, many are slain by want. Had the first col
onists gone forth from the parent stock, in commu
nities, rather than in families, or singly, there would
always have been some, endowed with foresight;
and all would have felt the necessity, of sure provi
sion for future support. Agriculture and the tend
ing of flocks, would therefore have been resorted
to, rather than the chase. Different communities
would have maintained a constant intercourse
with each other, and with those primitive regions,
where a superabundance of food is produced, with
little labor. The causes of want therefore, would
never have existed. Incredible numbers have been

slain, in times past, and still continue to be, in
some regions, by wild beasts. The advantage, in
contending with these, of a dense and compara
tively stationary, over a scattered and wandering
population, are sufficiently obvious. But the most
formidable enemy of mankind, is the pestilence.
And here, the benefits of social organization are, if
possible, still more apparent. The pestilence ori
ginates in the abodes of extreme misery, or among
such as are exposed to unheard of exigencies ; and
in its progress, marks for victims, those who are
prepared as fuel for the flame, by squalid want, by
vicious indulgences, and irregular modes of life.
Of the fifty millions, who are said to have fallen a
prey to the destroyer, which has ravaged the world,
for some years past, not one perhaps, had their
frames been invigorated and supported, by the
healthful food, the temperate and industrious ha
bits, the various comforts and immunities, the bland
intellectual stimulus, and the moral discipline, of
the social organization, to say nothing of improved
hereditary constitution, would have been suscepti
ble of the disease. But war ! war ! nothing could
have prevented the fallen and guilty race of man
kind, from slaughtering one another. I admit,
that were the social system now to become uni
versal, it would probably have little influence, to
wards lessening the frequency of wars, for ages to
come. Indeed, prophecy informs us, that the long
struggle of the third woe, will be carried on, for
the most part, between nations, under the social

constitution. But it may be doubted entirely, had
a different frame of society prevailed at first, whe
ther this moral malady would ever have been de
veloped. Noah and his sons were probably ac
quainted with the miseries of war, in the antedilu
vian period and must have been anxious to pre
vent, if possible, by warning, and positive institu
tion, a recurrence of its evils. And the causes
which originally led to aggression and reprisal, to
lasting feud, and national hate ; and which, in a se
ries of generations, rendered the belligerent spirit
an hereditary disease, almost universal and irradi-
cable, would never have been known.* I will
mention but one other cause of premature death,
intemperance. It will readily be seen, with what
perfect facility, the constant superintendence, and
salutary restraints, of the social system, would have
prevented this great evil.
It would be easy to proceed to show, that the
sources of private violence, of the crimes which
require the severest infliction of public justice, and
of the various evils, which shorten the term of life,
remotely and indirectly, are inherent in the indi
vidual system ; and would disappear under the be
neficent influence of social institutions. But I
shall briefly advert to this part of the subject,
hereafter.
* One of the most remarkable and influential of these, was the con
fusion of tongues. Under other circumstances, this signal judgment
would not have been required.

INTRODUCTION. XVII
It will be alleged, that if Babylon be the indivi
dual system, a proportionate degree of importance
should be given, in Revelation, to the social sys
tem. I admit the justness of the plea, and accord
ingly we find, that the diffusion of the social system
is figured under one of the most sublime represen
tations, which ever filled the glowing mind of an
inspired prophet. And Ilooked, and behold a white
cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto to the Son
ofman, having on his head a golden crown, and in his
hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of
the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on
the cloud, thrust in thy sickle, and reap : for the time
is come for thee to reap ;for the harvest of the earth is
ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle
on the earth ; and the earth was reaped. Rev. xiv ;
14— 16. As we have explained these verses, he
that is seated upon the cloud, represents the sove
reigns of England from the time when the social
system is established in that nation, to the time
when it is universally diffused throughout the world.
He is seated upon a cloud, as exalted to those ter
restrial heavens, so often mentioned in prophecy.
The cloud is white, an emblem of purity. It ima
ges those noble spirits, the noblest of a potent
realm, the chosen kingdom,* who rally around
their sovereign, and devote their influence, their
efforts, their wealth, their lives, to the glorious
cause of founding these institutions, which are to

produce the reign of universal peace ; those bliss
ful times, which have been the desire and prayer,
of prophets and saints, in all ages of the church.
A cloud, in the figurative language of scripture,
signifies a gathering, a multitude. Who are these
that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows.
Is. lx ; 8. And they ascended up to heaven in a
cloud ; and their enemies beheld them. Rev. xi ; 8.
In the present instance, the several congeries of
the cloud, for all, having the slightest ray of poetic
fancy, will give to the cloud one form, happily re
present social communities ; as the drops, each
subject to a crystalline arrangement, represent in
dividuals. He who is like unto the Son of man, is
so, as being the invisible head of the church. In
his hand is a sharp sickle, to express the power,
which God has given him, of effecting a beneficent
change in the world. On his head is a golden
crown, the symbol of wealth, the unfailing accom
paniment of the social system. Religious public
opinion comes out of the temple, and exhorts him

tinued.* For proof of the truth of the above ex
position, I shall depend chiefly, upon the comment
which follows. An explanation of the concluding
verses of the chapter, will however, be necessary,
to render certain allusions, in the comment, intel
ligible ; and here, some additional, though indirect
proof will be afforded. It may be added in this
place, that the description, (verses 14—16,) is in
the same series as that of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, mentioned, as we have seen in a
verse preceding.
It will be needful, in an attempt to explain these
verses, Rev. xiv; 17—20, to advert first, to some
other portions of Revelation. The two witnesses,
Rev. xi, according to our scheme, are the Rabbini
cal and Caraite Jews. These are the earliest wit
nesses of God. They testify to many things un
known to other witnesses. To them were com
mitted the Divine oracles. And, in view of the
number of witnesses required, under the Jewish
law, they may be called, emphatically, God's two
witnesses. Of the multiplied proofs which might
be offered, I shall confine myself to one ; the ex
treme probability, that the restoration of the Jews
would be mentioned in Revelation ; yet no other
* In these verses the entire earth is regarded as a field of grain ; in
those which follow, 17 —20, the two descriptions being evidently to be
considered in connexion, a part of the field is encumbered with an ob

portion of Revelation, seems applicable to this
event.
The holy city began to be trampled under foot by
the Gentiles, forty and two months, as at verse 2,
when Jerusalem was captured by the Saracens, in
637. The two witnesses prophecy in sackcloth, verse
3, a like period, twelve hundred and sixty prophet
ical days, or solar years ; and commencing at the
same time. The great city, which spiritually is
called Sodom and Egypt, verse 8, includes those
regions, or the most of them, comprised within
the Turkish empire. Three years and a half
before the close of the twelve hundred and
sixty years, the witnesses are slain, by the beast
that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit ; verses 7 and
9 ; of which it is now needful to give some further
account.
The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless
pit, here first alluded to, has already been noticed,
and is described in chapter seventeen. He is there
called, also, a king, and is one of a series of eight
kings: verse 10, 11. In reference to the time of
prophecy, he is called, the beast that was, and is not,
and yet is. Verse 8. The only political beast, in
the time of John, which he could mention, was the
Roman empire. It was. It existed previously, as
the Roman republic. And is not. At that time
the government was imperial. And yet is. The
imperial succession was not hereditary, but de
pendent on the will of a privileged body of electors,

cian. The sixth has continued, in one form or
another, to the present day. Of the seventh it is
6aid, and when he cometh, he must continue a short
space. Verse 10. This is the popular imperial,
founded by Napoleon. Whether the sixth termi
nated finally, on the establishment of the confede
ration of the Rhine, in 1806,* or at a later period,
or whether it still subsist, is not material. Either
supposition is consistent with the prophetical state

We learn nothing important, directly, concern

particulars, of a general character, affirmed of the
eighth, are predicable of the rest of the series.
Like the eighth, the seven ascend out of the bot

have seen they bear the same relation, as the

more or less directly and consciously, they make
war with the Lamb. Verses 12—14. By the second

mature state. The scarlet colored beast has ex
isted in the world, in this state, for a period. It
will exist in this state, in the Turkish empire, when
the time shall arrive for the slaying of the wit
nesses. It is not needful to suppose a change in
the form of government; but only, that those prin
ciples have influence, somewhat extensively, which
are developed in the growth of this beast; espe
cially, that which admits of occasional popular dis
regard of the laws.
Three years and a half before the close of the
twelve hundred and sixty year*, Rev. xi ; 3, and
which terminate in 1897, the Jews throughout the
Turkish empire, are to become the objects of ge
neral dislike and suspicion. By a sudden impulse
of the multitude they are thrown without the pro
tection of the laws, and subjected to the barbarous
license of popular fury. Such scenes will perhaps
be acted, wherever Jews are found, throughout the
empire, as were witnessed, in some of the cities, at
the commencement of the late Greek revolution.
By reason of the prevalence of democratic senti
ments, and the consequent instability of the govern
ment, the public authorities will not dare to inter
fere. The unhappy victims, deprived of their civil
rights, are politically dead. And their dead bodies
shall lie in the street of the great city. Verse 8. And
after three days and a half the Spirit of life from
God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet ;
and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And

them, Come up hither —Verses 11, 12. After three
years and a half, (the greater prophetical period
concluding at the same time,) they are reanimated
by a favorable change of circumstances. The pow
erful voice of England is heard, inviting them to
return to Palestine, and ascend once more, to the
rank and privileges of an independent, and pecu
liarly favored people. And they ascended up to
heaven in a cloud ; and their enemies beheld them.
Verse 12. Their enemies, stunned by impending
events, allow them to depart, with what can be
collected of their wealth. And the same hour was
there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the
city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men
seven thousand. Verse 13. The great northern
power acts in concert with England. It is proba
ble, that at this time, Constantinople falls; and
the Turks are driven out of Europe. At any rate,
the Turkish empire undergoes some signal dis
memberment. One tenth of their dominion be
comes the possession of the enemy ; and seven
tenths of their warriors are killed. Or, since the
language of a series of professed emblems is not
to be understood literally, except where it is ob
viously needful, perhaps rather thus. An integral
part of the empire is dissevered, and more than half
of the army are slain. And the remnant were af
frighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Verse. 13. It need not follow from this, that the
Turks are converted to Christianity. The second
woe is past ; and, behold the third woe cometh quickly.

INTRODUCTION. XXV
Verse 14. With this last act of violence and op
pression, of the Othomans, towards Jews or Chris
tians, the second woe terminates. It commenced
with the irruption of the same people, from the
Euphrates, about six hundred years before.*
To the Jews assembled in Palestine, from the
Turkish empire, are added some others. Much
wealth is brought, and they prosper exceedingly.
Numbers embrace Christianity; and a considera
ble portion of these, adopt the worship and disci
pline of the Church of England. A majority how
ever, adhere to the ancient faith. A republican
government is set up, notwithstanding the example
of their great ally.
Somewhat less than five and twenty years after
the beginning of the restoration, see comment,

tlie east and out of the north shall trouble him. Dan.
xi : 44. England again interposes. Her fleets and
armies are mustering in the east and in the north.*
Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
and utterly to make away many. And he shall plant the
tabernacles of his palaces between the seas in the glorious
holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end, and none
shall help him. Dan. xi: 44, 45. Palestine is as
sailed; and there is fought that great battle, or
series of battles, perhaps, so often alluded to by
the older prophets. With this attack upon the re
stored Jews, by the armies of the Greek, the Ca
tholic, and the Armenian churches, and of the
southern Mahometans, commences the third woe ;
less than five and twenty years, after the termina
tion of the second. The second woe is past ; and,
beholil, the third woe cometh quickly. Rev. xi : 14.
Immediately after the danger of this period is
over, the Episcopalian Jews, now, partly in conse
quence of the astonishing fulfilment of prophecy,
a great majority, of the Christians, resolve upon
adopting the institutions of England, and elect a
king. A civil war follows, and the antichristian
Jews are exterminated, five and twenty years after
the commencement of the restoration. The vision,

pages, alludes, in the first instance, to the period

immediately subsequent ; when the restored Jewish
nation, now Christian, are about adopting a con

the true apostolic church, and the social system;
after the example appointed by Providence.
The full swell of the seventh trumpet is heard,
when the tremendous array of the antichristian
powers, is approaching, and Palestine is about to
be invaded. With the invasion, the third woe
commences. And there were great voices in heaven,
saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the
kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he
shall reign forever and ever. Rev. xi; 15. The
kingdoms—that
is,
the two chosen kingdoms,
under the beneficent rule
of
which, all the kingdoms
and nations
of
the earth, are to be united, previous to
the millenium. The two chosen kingdoms now
adopt MiixENiAL institutions. The ancient
covenant people have, indeed, become one of the
kingdoms
of
our Lord and
of
his Christ, after a new
and endearing manner. Him whom they rejected
and put to death, they now receive. The above
declaration has always,
I
believe, been considered
difficult to be understood, on account of the tempo
ral judgments, and the changes, which are evi
dently subsequent.
It
is
general, prospectively.
As regards the extension of the Jewish dominion,

or less, upon general coincidence, and fitness,
though the proofs are abundant.
About thirty years after the return from Palestine,
of the broken hosts of the northern confederacy, a
signal change takes place, in the nations of which
it consists. In 1950, the twelve hundred and sixty
years of the continuance of the beast, with seven
heads and ten horns, Rev. xiii, or modern political
Rome, (in opposition to papal or spiritual Rome,)
terminate. This period commenced in 690, when
" Pepin d'Heristal, by the death of Ebroin and de
feat of Thierry, became master of France and a
part of Germany, ruling, though under the title of
mayor of the palace, with regal authority. This
Pepin was the founder of the second or Carlovin-
gian dynasty ; in the early reigns of which, events
took place, that exercised a most important influ
ence upon the future state of Europe. Charles
Martel, the son of Pepin cFHeristal, checked the
progress of the Saracens; and to his energy it was
probably owing, that the greater part of Europe
was preserved from the fate of Spain. Pepin he
Bref, grandson of the elder Pepin, made important
additions of territory to France ; and endowed the
bishop of Rome, with those temporalities, which
raised him to the rank of a sovereign prince. And
Charlemagne, son of the preceding, as has been
observed, restored the empire of the west.*

suppose, that the great period of 1260 years, com
mences, with relation to all the different subjects
which it embraces, at the same time. Its influence
seems rather, progressive, like the shadows of an
eclipse..
After the overwhelming misfortune in Palestine,
great discontents are to be expected in the north
ern nations, which share in that catastrophe.
These will be augmented, by witnessing the in
creasing power and prosperity of England, conse
quent upon the social system; till at length, by
popular violence, the governments are overturned;
and kings and nobles reduced to the level of the
people. The prophet Daniel, in speaking of the
termination of the period of the Romish political
beast, says, the beast was slain, and his body destroyed,
and given to the burning flame. Dan. vn: 11. He is
slain. The spirit, arbitrary power, and the preju
dices and tone of public sentiment, by which it was
more directly upheld, is gone. The body is de
stroyed —not annihilated —by the destruction of its
political organization. The body, including the
great mass of error, and prejudice, and unhallowed
passions, upon which the structure was built, re

spoken of as alive. But, it should be remembered,
it is not said, in Revelation, that he is previously
killed. And power was given unto him to continue
forty and two months. Rev. xin: 5. For aught
that appears, like the beast that was, and is not, and
yet is, he may continue, in another state a further
period. That such is the case, may be learned, by
a comparison of the several prophetical series in
Revelation alone. In another prophecy, by a dif
ferent metaphor, the same thing is expressed. The
dead body is given to the burning flame. It scarce
need be said, that the dead body of a political
beast, with reference to its subsequent disposal, is still
alive. The two writers, according to the most
rigid technicalities of rhetorical construction, are
consistent with themselves, and with each other. I
am the more solicitous on this point, as the idea, that,
the beast no longer exists, after the close of the
1260 years, or, some few years later, and that the
millenium then commences, seems to have been
the great source of error, in prophetical chro
nology.
As respects the time of the continuance of the
third woe, I regret, that it will not be possible here,
to go into the statements and reasonings, for
shewing, that it concludes, almost precisely, with
the seventh millenary of years from the creation.
It will be sufficient to observe, that if the period of
2300 days, Dan. vin : 14, commence, as we sup
pose, with the capture of Jerusalem, by the Sara
cens, in 637, the Mahometan superstition will en

plan, within less than 100 years afterward, the third
woe terminates, and the millenium commences.
At the time specified above, 1 950, the second beast
with seven heads and ten horns, who has long pos
sessed and vexed the first, kills him; and then himself
animates and wields the dead body, which now as
sumes an appropriate hue. In the death struggle,
the ten horns, the ancient kingdoms, are broken,
though the roots remain; and other ten, the ten
kings, Rev. xvn : 3 ; 12 ; 16, or the new democra
tic governments, are developed. It is this beast,
which continues to the close of the third woe.
The two horned beast, or the false prophet, Rev.
xiii ; 11; xix ; 20, continues the same period. —
it will soon appear that this is not unregarded in the
Old Testament*
It is singular, that the last ten horns are spoken
of, as a distinct power from the beast to which they
pertain ; though acting in concert with each other,
and with the beast ; thus establishing the remark
able fact, known to those well versed in human na
ture, and political science, that elective governments
are less identified with the people, than hereditary
ones. These have one mind, and shall give their
power and strength unto the beast. Rev. xvn: 13.—

prophetical computation, is about a fortnight. Quite
as long a period, as that state of entire equality, so
much desiderated by a certain class of politicians,
between the authors ofa violent revolution, and their
newly elected rulers, all reigning together, could be
expected to last. This is happily illustrated, by the
progress of events in the late revolution in Paris.*

They practically oppose those institutions by
which, alone, the religion of Christ can be made
effective ; and are at variance with the nations by
which these have been adopted. And the Lamb
shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and
King of kings ; and they that are with him are called,

able, that notwithstanding the occasional appear

there is never even a superfluous epithet. The

the nations of Christendom. The faithful are

upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall
make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh,
and burn her with fire. Verse 16. After the de
struction of monarchy, the democratic govern
ments assail the individual system generally, and
the privileges of wealth, with the zeal of reformers,
and the fury of levellers. The situation of those
who refuse to come into their measures, is ren
dered so uncomfortable, that the woman is made
desolate and naked. Till at length her enemies eat
her flesh, and burn the skeleton with fire. Not a
trace of individual possession is suffered to remain,
in any form. They establish a social organization,
on principles of entire equality. It is this demo
cratic and social constitution, which is described
in the verses, in a former prophetical series of Re
velation, xiv : 17—20, which caused this long,
though I hope not unprofitable disquisition, and to
which we now return.
He that sits upon the cloud reaps the earth ; but
finds the grain, in a portion of this vast field,
blighted by a superficial philosophy. The sheaves
are here bad. In a subsequent metaphor, they are
figured as the clusters of the vine of the earth ; and
as requiring a further process. And another angel
came out of the temple ivhich is in heaven—verse 17.
This angel represents the line of sovereigns, of the
renewed Jewish kingdom, during the later portion
of the third woe, and after the kingdom has become
powerful. He is said to come out of the temple,

the most powerful. And it is only by the help of
England, that the second reaper can hope to be

It may here be added, perhaps, that, originally, he

and conscious, that on the completion of the work,
which he urges, the earth will be finally purified, as
by fire. Hence he is said to have power over Jire.
The clusters of the vine, it has been said, are the
social communities, of a peculiar character, under
the new organization. The vine itself, it will be
anticipated, represents the new democratic system
of government, unable to support its own weight.
For her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel
thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the
vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press
of the wrath of God. Verses 18, 19. The grapes
are fully ripe. That is, there has been time for the
social organization, on principles of equality, to
produce its entire effects. A step further, and decay
and decomposition commence. The experiment has
been fairly tried, under the most favorable circum
stances. In conjunction with democratic govern
ment, and with the aids of experience, numbers,
wealth, power, science and resources of every kind.
The result is a lesson for the instruction of man
kind, in all future ages. It demonstrates that a
state of society, without gradation, is not that,
which is most conducive to the best interests of
mankind. So ineffectual have these institutions
been found, for restraining the evil propensities of
mankind, that the wrath of God is kindled. The
vine will be gathered first, and cast into the wine
press, along with the grapes. The democratic
governments are overthrown, before the evils
attendant upon the social constitution, are eradi-

cated. And the wine-press was trodden without the
city, and blood came out of the wine-press even unto
the horses'1 bridles, by the space of a thousand and six
hundred furlongs. Verse 20. The metaphors at
first view, are highly terrific. In the connexion,
they show, that at least, an immense amount of
error, leading to incidental and prescriptive vice
and crime, is to be done away. We learn, else
where, that the change is not effected, without the
literal shedding of much blood. This is, indeed,
sufficiently implied, in the passage, already referred
to, where the extension of the Jewish dominion is
figured, by the setting up of the posts of sixty
cubits. See§32;14.
We have anticipated, in a good degree, where
the space without the city, verse 20, above, is found ;
but the questions remain, where is the city, and
how are we to understand and apply, the measure
of the furlong. The city last mentioned, is Baby-
'
Ion ; verse 8. This, I trust it has been shewn, is
co-extensive with human habitations. The next
preceding, is the great city, &c. xi ; 8, 13, or, as we
have seen, a portion of the Turkish empire. As
early as the restoration of the Jews, we have also
seen, the Turks are driven out of Europe. The
city then, is Turkey in Asia ;
* and the space
without the city, as is supposed in the preceding,
those portions of Christendom, adjoining. This

is, of itself, almost certain, because other regions,
contiguous to the great city, are mentioned in
prophecy, with little exception, only in the most
general way.
The measure of the furlong, it seems highly
probable, is to be understood figuratively, like the
measure of time, in this prophecy ; but there is no
indication, equally direct, of the manner. The
analogy makes it probable also, that the measure
intended, is larger than the furlong ; and like that,
an itinerary measure. I shall here omit the nu
merous reasons, which might be given, for suppo
sing, that the scientific measure of the sixtieth of a
degree, the minute, or English geographical mile,
the rudiments of which, derived from the learning
of Egypt, were known at the date of the prophecy, is
indicated by the furlong ; and come at once to the
results. On measuring the space without the city,
northward, towards the eastern limits, and west
ward, towards the southern, the average extent
will be found, very nearly, sixteen hundred geo
graphical miles. On the south the coincidence is
truly remarkable. The distance from the southern
point of Europe, at the strait of the Dardanelles,
west, to the Atlantic, is just sixteen hundred
miles. The average length of the belt, between
this parallel and the latitude of cape Finisterre, in
cluding the city of Rome, and a considerable portion
of the States of the Church, is sixteen hundred
miles, very nearly. Here, it will be recollected,

It may, in this place, be added, that, if the limits
of the city, and of the space without the city, are
indeed, ascertained, as above, no doubt can exist,
that the two witnesses are the Rabbinical and Ca-
raite Jews, as has been supposed.
We now return to the social system. Our plan
supposes, that the social system is to be established
in England, as early as the year 1865. At the same
time, the church, figuratively represented as fleeing
to the wilderness, 1260 years before,* will find a
permanent home. The prophet Isaiah thus refers
to this period. And it shall come to pass in the last
days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be
established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow
unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come
ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us
of his ways, and we will walk in his paths t
for out of
Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem. Is. ii: 2, 3. This passage is al
luded to in the ensuing comment, and an outline is
there given, of our exposition of the chapter. See

temple, on the mount of sacrifice ? what can it be,
but a nation, consolidated by a social union, which
acknowledges, in their fullest extent, the obligations
of the Divine law ; which secures every one of its
members against the ills of want, against the fear
of want j which confronts the mischiefs of a vision
ary and impracticable equality ; which not only in

but lays effectual restraints upon idleness and all
its train of evils; and binds, with a great chain,

characteristics of the social system of prophecy.
It has been made clear, I trust, that all Utopian
dreams of universal equality, are precluded. This
will be still further obvious, as we proceed with the
comment.
It appears, that in the new organization of soci
ety, the parties will be distributed into classes, with
reference, as seems strictly just, to the advantages
which they relinquish, under the individual system ;
or, in other words, to the contributions, which they
are enabled to make, to the common stock. And
that the station accorded to each, will be perma
nently secured to his descendants. Not that the
barriers of caste will be absolutely insurmountable.
Advantages may arise, from their being occasion
ally set aside.
Of the peculiar benefits of such a system, I shall
have occasion to speak hereafter. It may here be
remarked however, that it is vain to expect that the
wealthy and influential will, voluntarily, accede to
any social arrangement, on a different basis. It is
dictated, alike by justice and expediency. It may
be added, by expediency, remote as well as contin
gent. And it seems a wonderful manifestation of
the Divine attribute of eliciting good from evil,
that the cupidity and crime of the early ages of
the world, are to be made conducive to a state of
society, by which, new capacities for happiness
will be developed, and the enjoyments of man, di
versified and enhanced, immeasurably ; and which,

it may safely be affirmed, could not have been pro
duced, had man remained in a state of innocence.
Another question arises here. What is the evi
dence, that the proposed change in the form of so~
ciety, will achieve the promised results. I answer,
the evidence is threefold. First, it is affirmed in
prophecy, that such will be the case. That the
millenium is to be brought about, by the overthrow
of the individual, and the adoption of the social
system. I beg the reader not to believe, that this
assertion is gratuitous, or, at best, hypothetical, till
he has considered the following pages.
Second ; in this age of generalization and ab
stract truth, much may be learned, with reasonable
certainty, by philosophical deduction. What evils
can be mentioned, of the multiplied catalogue that
afflict mankind, aside from those, inseparable from
the condition of fallen humanity, that would not be
destroyed by the social system. Something has
already been said, of its tendency to check those
influences, which shorten the period of life. A
large portion of the evils of society are caused by
defective and erroneous education. Train up a
child in the way he should go : and, when he is old,
he will not depart from it. But this never can be
done, generally, under the individual organization.
All admit that the character is formed, in a great
measure, under the paternal roof. Yet how few
parents are qualified for a work, requiring high and
peculiar native endowments, aided by appropriate
education, and much experience. And of the few

who are qualified, how small a number are permit
ted, by circumstances, fully to execute the task.
Physical education too, no less indispensable to
the future wellbeing, and usefulness, of the young,
than moral and intellectual training ; and which, in
the simpler stages ofsociety, may more safely be left
to itself, requires the judicious application of sci
entific means. The undeniable fact, that an in
comparably greater proportion of the human spe
cies, die prematurely, or become feeble, than is
the case with any class of the larger animals,
proves, that the general influence of counteracting
causes, has not kept pace, in the progress of civil
ization, with the hurtful agencies, which accompany
every new discovery in the arts. It will not always
be thus. The time, we are given to understand,
will come, when the child shall die an hundred years
old. That is, if one happen to die at that age,
(though, in such an improved state, this will be a
rare occurrence,) he will still, in comparison with
the ordinary age of man, be but a child. This ex
planation is confirmed in what follows, when it is
said, that the days of a man shall be as the days of
a tree. See Is. lxv : 20—22. Various trees flou
rish eight, nine and ten hundred years.*
What is impossible under the individual organi
zation, will be attended with no difficulty under the
social. At an early age the children will be taken

agricultural state, for example, a life of constant
excitement, is given up, for one of monotonous la
bor. In the present case, nothing will indeed be
lost, on the score of the kindly affections ; though
they will doubtless be more diffused. Much the
same feelings will be exercised, towards the entire
social village, as are now confined to a single fa
mily, or circle of relatives. Doubtless, those in
stances of almost exclusive and engrossing affec
tion, between the members of a family, which are
now not uncommon, will be rare indeed. But the
condition of society will not require them, and of

cannot be united. And those instances, where
children are a grief of heart to their parents, will
be unknown.
After the course of education is finished, the
numerous causes of failure, which, at present, in

strife, and every evil work.* Doubtless, it is one of
the most insidious, of all the evil propensities ; be
cause it is blended, by imperceptible shades, with
the kindred virtue. And unquestionably, it is one
of the most dangerous; because, in addition, the
undisguised vice is regarded with indifference, or
as a virtue, by a large proportion of mankind. The
calm desire of positive excellence, with a delicate
and truly fraternal regard for the feelings of others,
which, yet, can kindle at a worthy model, makes
that a bower of peace and happiness, which the
mere, heartless craving for superiority, always ig
noble, except perhaps, in the rudest stages of so

and selfishness, and hate, mingle in perilous strife;
in which, the whole circle of evil passions, scarcely
restrained by feeble bars, are eager to engage. It
gives to the whole community, a feverish excite
ment , itself a disease, and which prepares the way
for others. In every form of society, there will still
be scope for vicious emulation ; but under the so

deprived of their power. Enlightened moral train

tem, might be extended, very considerably; but I
shall mention only one more, the love of money.
We are told in scripture, that the love of money is
the root of all evil.* Directly or indirectly, this is
unquestionably true. We have already considered
the assertion that in Babylon was found the blood
of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain
upon the earth. But in a state of society, where
the poorest have the substantial advantages of
wealth, with many others peculiar to their situa
tion ; and the rich make no acquisitions, but as the
general prosperity advances; where, in short, the
wants of all are provided for, and the condition of
every one is permanently fixed ;f the love of money
either has no place, or becomes diffuse and harm
less, like the consciousness we have, of the advan
tages of climate, good government, &c.
But thirdly, we are not left, in this matter, to
mere speculation. An experiment has been in pro
gress, in the United States, for about forty years,
which demonstrates, to a certain extent, the advan
tages of the community system. In the year 1795,
the Shaking Quakers, or Shakers, as they are more
commonly called, or millenial church, as they
denominate themselves, at the suggestion of Mea-
cham, their chief elder, threw their property into a
common stock. They united in small communi
ties, called families, were clothed by the common

means, and fed at a common table; and the direc
tion of the labor, and of their pecuniary concerns,
was intrusted to overseers, appointed for the pur
pose.
The institutions of the American People, are
regarded with curiosity and interest, by many
statesmen and philosophers in other nations ; but
those of the Shakers, are at least equally worthy of
attention. Here is a community in which, it scarce
need be said, there are no poor, in the ordinary ac
ceptation of the term. Where all contribute,
according to their power, to the common weal;
and, in turn, when feeble or old, are themselves
provided for. Where idleness, intemperance, and
statutory crime, are unknown ; and the diseases
chiefly found in the abodes of wretchedness and
want, seldom appear.* The improved husbandry
and goodness of the roads, in every direction, the
perfect neatness and order observable in the
villages, with the general appearance of abundance
and calm prosperity, and the absence of all the
usual indications of vice, give no small semblance
of justice to the appellation of the millenial church.
The contrast with the neighboring hamlets, from
which, in a considerable measure, they sprung, is
said to be truly remarkable. When it is remem
bered, that this community was originally formed
of uneducated men, very poor, and many of them
illy qualified by previous habits, for a regular mode

absence of those ties, which form the great and
original bond of society, this association would

the domestic charities, the comprehensive energy
of national government, with unshackled internal

the ordinary bounds of an introduction, to what

There are multitudes, at the present day, who
seem under an impression, that the great object
of civil institutions is, to enable the bustling and
active to scramble for office, or vie in the pursuit
of wealth, or the distinctions of vanity. Such will
ever be favorable to popular forms of government

INTRODUCTION. XLIX
But those who rise above these puerile views, who
would find security, tranquillity, restraints against
vice in every shape ; and who realize, that the only
truly important object of this life is to prepare for
another ; will readily perceive, whatever may have
been their prepossessions, the advantages of that
form of government, which is ordained by Provi
dence, to be universal, in the millenium ; and which,
it may be added, in connexion with the social sys
tem, without unhallowed competition, will afford
comfort, abundance, the means of all rational and
allowable enjoyments, not to the successful only,
but to every member of the community.
It is not, perhaps, rendered quite certain, that
the change, spoken of in the comment, which is to
be made in the British constitution, as adopted by
the restored Jews,* will prevail in England, till a
later period.
I have spoken freely in the comment, respecting
the articles. The articles, doubtless, bear a near
resemblance, to the doctrines of scripture; and
were sufficiently correct, for the great object of
practical inculcation, in the period, during which,
they were ordained, by Providence, to continue an
accredited form of belief. On the subject of the
Trinity, I wish to avoid the possibility of misap
prehension. I fully believe the doctrine of the
Trinity. It is the mode in which that doctrine is
explained, in the first article, to which alone I

object. I should not call in question a doctrine,
to doubt which, admits of no alternative, as 1
believe, to a latitude of construction, which de
stroys that character of sanctity and authority, in
separable from an adequate idea of a revelation,
concerning the mode of existence, the will and the
purposes of God. Can it be, that the Church of
England would be indicated, by prophecy, as the
true church, at a time when she held, and ever had
held, principles, essentially erroneous, on a subject,
which forms the basis of Christian theology.
The relative situation of England, makes the
question, how are the prevailing distresses to be
relieved, one of great interest and importance. I
have expressed, in the comment, utter incredulity,
as to the good effects of " reform." The reason
is simply this; that, owing to the unavoidable
influence of party —a most comprehensive word—
equal numerical representation, affords not the
slightest guaranty, of equal justice, in legislative
enactments. The advocates of reform may safely
be challenged, to produce a single instance, in the
entire history of past legislation, which does not
confirm this melancholy truth. It is said that those
who make objections, should point out a better
mode. In the present instance, I cheerfully accept
the responsibility. I do not hesitate then, to
express an entire conviction, that the national
distresses of England, may be remedied, by the
adoption, at home and in the foreign dependencies,

colonization, also on the basis of the social ar
rangement. I could not doubt, aside from
prophecy.
Of all the objects to which national resources,
and the enterprise of intelligent associations, have
been directed, there is doubtless, no one, which
has been uniformly attempted, with such dispro
portionate means, as colonization. Instead of a
few colonists, mostly women and children, arriving
on a bleak or unhealthy coast, at precisely the
wrong season of the year, the shipmaster in haste
to depart, the colonists, already sickly and emacia
ted, and with little provision for their immediate
wants, expected to erect,. themselves, the first rude
cabins for temporary shelter; instead of this, let
well appointed armies of pioneers go forth; let
villages be constructed, and roads be built; let every
thing be prepared. The colonists, at the best sea
son, may then follow. Let ample provision be
made, for immediate sustenance and comfort. Till
acclimated, let sanitary regulations be enforced,
with the strictness of military discipline. .The
dreadful sufferings, and appalling waste of life,
which have hitherto attended colonization, might
thus be avoided. Almost from the first, such
colonies would repay the interest of the investment.
They would soon be enabled to redeem the princi
pal. Whatever the products of the soil, un

On arriving at a certain degree of wealth, as a

present time, the social system were universal in
Great Britain only, the entire amount of taxation
would be no more felt, from year to year, than the
bubbles of foam on succeeding waves. Might be
greatly augmented, without the slightest incon

addition to increased production, and highly im

rapid circulation, attendant upon a state of war,
may be given to the various departments of indus

already commenced the work of colonization. As
England had a share in producing the evil, she may
also aid in its removal. Would it not be right and

logies of jurisprudence, sacred and profane, with
positive injunction in each, tend to show, that the
compact, though involuntary on one side, is not, de
facto, void. How many worthy families are to be
found, whose wealth, with no fault of theirs, con
sists of this description of property. It may be
questioned, whether the great work of emancipa
tion can be accomplished, on any other condition,
than the one proposed. And lastly, it would be a
real advantage to the colonists, individually and
collectively, to be under such obligations. With
habits of industry, and the most fertile soil, the pro
ducts of which are sought by almost all the rest of
the world, the chief danger, at first, would be from
too much wealth. In addition to the natural in
crease of numbers, the native tribes would coalesce
with the emigrants, and help to lighten the burden.
The debt would be made a national one, and there
would be pledged, for its payment, the faith of an
enlightened, industrious and Christian people; with
advantages for commerce and navigation, almost
unrivalled.
It is a remarkable circumstance, that the mere
contact of christian civilization, has been more
hurtful, to uncultivated nations, than the system of
slavery. Within the British dominions, are many
noble races of men, whom the vices of civilization
are fast degrading, and will soon extinguish. Let

less than justice, require them to cherish, they bring
not upon themselves, the stain of national guilt;
which must, in all cases, be repented of, and where
possible, atoned for, or it will be visited, and before
the millenium.
In the observations which have been made on
the social system, results have been more particu
larly contemplated. Unquestionably, the transition
from the individual to the social state, will be at
tended with great difficulties. Let those who
take the lead beware of thinking to forward the
work, by exciting unreasonable expectations, illu
sive hopes, of an Utopian paradise, to be at once
enjoyed. Let this be left to rapacious speculators,
and heated sectaries, who will enter the field, so
soon as the advantages of the social system are
known. These will be likely to engage in exten
sive undertakings, with inadequate means ; and in
various ways, to bring discredit upon the plan.
I doubt not, that millenial institutions will, in
time, raise mankind to a higher degree of felicity,
than the most fervid imagination has ever yet
clearly dreamed of. The capacities of mankind
for happiness, and of the objects around to minister
to that happiness, have as yet, only begun to be de
veloped. But millenial institutions, like the arts
which more immediately contribute to our enjoy
ment, are of slow growth. The former, as we have
seen, are to be established more than a thousand
years before the commencement of the millenium.

LVIII INTRODUCTION*
Probably, industrious and quiet laborers and arti-
zans, would, in general, feel their situation improved.
But those accustomed to the control of property,
and whose habits are formed, would, in many in
stances, find their condition sufficiently irksome.
They would pine for the unbounded liberty of the
world. And it is more than can be reasonably
hoped, that real inconveniences would not be height
ened, by innumerable jealousies and feuds. Those
alone who are early accustomed to the social form
of society, whose habits and feelings are conformed
to its discipline, as to the changes of the seasons,
who are accustomed to contribute, in their sphere,
for the common benefit, and to receive in return,
every thing for need and for enjoyment, as freely,
and with as little care, as the light of day, and who
have acquired a fraternal regard for the enlarged
family circle in which they dwell ; it is these who
will first begin to realize the advantages of the
social system. A return to the perplexities, the
anxieties, the heartlessness, the solitude of the
world, would be not less formidable to these, than
a sojourn in the literal wilderness.
I am not sure it is desirable that any, possessing
wealth, should engage, but such as are willing to
put at risque, much of personal enjoyment, actu
ated by a sober conviction of the importance, and
the duty of making an effort, in the mode set forth
by prophecy, for the reformation of mankind ; and
by the laudable desire of improving the condition

EZEKIEL, CHAPTEli XL.
In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the 1
beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in
the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the
self-same day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and
-brought me thither. In the visions of God brought he 2
me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high
mountain, by which was as the frame of a city'on the
south. And he brought me thither, and behold, there was 3
a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of
brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring
reed ; and he stood in the gate. And the man said unto 4
me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with
thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew
thee ; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art
thou brought hither : declare all that thou seest to the
house of Israel. And behold a wall on the outside of the 5
house.round about, and in the man's hand a measuring-
reed of six cubits long, by the cubit, and an hand-breadth :
so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed ;
and the height, one reed.

and the .other threshold of the gate, which was one reed
7 broad. And every little chamber was one reed long,
and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers
were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate, by the
8 porch of the gate within, was one reed. He measured
9 also the porch of the gate within, one reed. Then
measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits ; and
the parts thereof two cubits; and the porch of the
10 gate was inward. And the little chambers of the gate
eastward were three on this side, and three on that
side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts
1 1 had one measure on this side, and on that side. And
he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate,
ten cubits ; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
12 The space also before the little chambers was one
cubit ore this side, and the space was one cubit on that
side ; and the little chambers were six cubits on this side,
13 and six cubits on that side. He measured then the gate
from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of ano
ther : the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door
14 against door. He made also posts of three score cubits,
even unto the posts of the court round about the gate.
15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the
face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
16 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers,
and to their posts within the gate round about, and like
wise to the arches : and windows were round about
17 inward : and upon each post were palm-trees. Then
brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were

18 about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement. And

And the gate of the outward court that looked toward 20
the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth
thereof. And the little chambers thereof were three on 21
this side, and three on that side ; and the posts thereof,

first gate : the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the
breadth five and twenty cubits. And their windows 22

they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches
thereof were before them. And the gate of the inner 23

an hundred cubits.
After that he brought me toward the south, and be- 24

posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these

upon also they laid the instruments wherewith they
slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. And within 43
icere hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about : and
upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
And without the inner gate were the chambers of the 44
singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the
north-gate ; and their prospect was toward the south :
one at the side of the east-gate having the prospect to
wards the north. And he said unto me, This chamber, 45
whose prospect is towards the south, is for the priests,
the keepers of the charge of the house. And the cham- 46
ber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests,
the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons
of Zadock, among the sons of Levi, which come near to
the Lord to minister unto him. So he measured the 47
court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits
broad, four-square ; and the altar that was before the house.
And he brought me to the porch of the house, and 48
measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side,
and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate
was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that
side. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and 49
the breadth eleven cubits ; and he brought me by the
steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars
by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

reason thus. The vision happened on the anni
versary of the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchad

that of the temple. The intervening period obvi
ously divides itself, such was the division of time
among the Jews, into two equal periods. Now as

again, the third time ;* and that immediately after,
the fulfilment of the prophecy would commence.
It will be seen, as we proceed, that the fulfilment
of the prophecy begins, at the close of the civil
war, between the converted and unconverted Jews,
subsequent to the restoration; during which the
city is taken by the former. [n] Whatever destruc
tion of buildings may ensue, the city from that
time, ceases to be the abode of the adherents of
the individual system ; and at the close of the war,
the ancient worship is forever abolished, in Pales-

upon a few resemblances, which may ever be
found. An exposition, thus imperfect, is at best
dubious. In an inspired prophecy, every discrim

and it scarce need be remarked, how greatly the
probabilities are multiplied, than an explanation,
which, without forced construction, omits nothing,

instruct them, in the various particulars, which are
the subject of the vision. It has appeared that
the man, as he is designated, represents, the Jewish
royal line, for ages in advance, during a very con
siderable portion of the third woe. See § 29; 13,
&c. As the vision is often retrospective, there
seems no reason to doubt, that he also represents
the same family, that

the royal family of Eng

cubits. —He now measured the breadth of the porch,
or, from north to south. And the posts thereof two 10
cubits : 18, 19. And the porch of the gate was inward. 11
The porch, it is obvious, must be on the opposite
side of the gate, to that where the mensuration
commenced. This passage, and the last of verse
7, see 7, margin, confirm the supposition, if con
firmation were* needful, that the inner court, men
tioned, verses 19, 23 and 27, is the court west of
the gate here described. [10] And the little cham- 12
bers of the gale eastward were three on this side, and three
on that side. —It would seem, at first view, that there
were three chambers on each side, and two inter
mediate spaces, as see 6. This can not, however,
be the case, since the breadth of the threshholds,
or the entire length of the entrance court, is but
eighteen cubits, or one cubit more than the length
of two rooms, and one intermediate space. It is 13
the interior of chambers 4, 5, which is called the
space between the chambers. These chambers
are thus distinguished from the others, because
they serve a different purpose. They are entran
ces to the passages beyond : 2, 3, and 6, 7. Still,
they are of the same size as the outward cham
bers ; are in the same range ; and have the same re
lation to the walls which separate the one from the other.
In this view, they are called, above, along with the

being mentioned, will be stated in another place.
14 See 21. By the dimensions of the chambers thus
given, we learn incidentally, that the thickness of
15 the walls is half a cubit. They three were of one
measure. There are on the one side and on the
other, three interior spaces, each five cubits square,
and each, as has been seen, surrounded by walls
half a cubit in thickness. It would be an idle re
finement to say, that half of the inner side walls
belongs to one chamber, and half to the other,
while it is not so with the outward walls. It will
be seen, in another place, that the middle cham
bers are arched. See 28. If therefore, the words,
they three were of one measure, are to be understood
in the fullest extent, which is safest, the side
chambers are arched also. This will not preclude
a difference of arrangement as respects the doors
16 and windows. And the posts had one measure on this
side and on that side. As it is said, verse 16, And
there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and
TO THEIR POSTS WITHIN THE GATE ROUND ABOUT,
it is to be inferred, on the one hand, that the posts
above, are an extension of the side walls, as see
29 —36 ; and on the other, that the continuation of
the posts, forming the sides of the little chambers,
is distinguished by the same name of posts. The
walls being, as we have seen, half a cubit in thick
ness, it follows, if the front posts are of one mea

It
will
be seen that
it
cannot be the length of the entrance

The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on 19

beyond doubt, that

breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.
See II ; 12, 17 ; and 13—16. The reasons for
making this addition to the chambers of the gate,
are as follows : first, no chambers are mentioned
directly, the interval between the roofs of which,
can be five and twenty cubits. Second, the space
from theface of the gate of the entrance, unto the face of
the porch of the inner gate, can not, as is said in verse
15, be fifty cubits, without such addition. Third,
the chambers 25 —28, and 4, 5, are called, verse
10, in reference to the porch, the chambers of the gate
eastward, implying that there are other chambers of
the gate, westward. Fourth, the singular phraseol
ogy at the close of verse 14, even unto the post of the
court round about the gate, seems purposeless,
and scarcely more applicable to one court than
the other, unless the addition be admitted. It
will be seen that 12, 17, are regarded as a part of
the porch. These are the architectural reasons :
others, no less conclusive, will be mentioned as
22 we proceed. See § 29; 8—11. [14] He made
also posts of three score cubits, even unto the post of the
court. round about the gate. As there is no reason
for placing the post of the court round about the gate,
either north, or south, or at any considerable dis
tance from the west side of the quadrangle, it is
placed directly opposite the gate, as see 9. The
posts of three score cubits extend from the sides of
the porch, 12, 17, to the post of the court, as see

[16] And there were narrow windows to the little cham- 24
bers. —To the chambers 25—28, and 4, 5, in front.
The arrangement of the windows of the chambers,
4, 5, is different from that of the other chambers,
to allow room for spacious doors, leading to the

the gate round about. On each side of 4 and 5. See
16. And likewise to the arches. On each side of the 26

on the east side, except 26 and 28, are in another
story, the windows on that side are placed opposite
those on the west side, without any regard to the
disposition of these chambers. And windows were 27
round about inward. In the passages 1 and 8 ; lead

account above, of the position of the windows,
with the description of the arches and windows of
gate 6, see verses 29—31; and having in view also,
the circumstance, verse 7, that between the little
chambers were five cubits; no doubt can remain that
the arches are arched passages, on each side of the
gate, leading to the interior of the edifice, as see 3,
2, and 6, 7. That the arches, moreover, commence
in front, and include the middle chambers 4, 5 ;

of gate 3, verses 21, 22; since it appears, that the
arches of that gate, [which are after the measure of
the
first gate,] belong in some sort, to the little
29 chambers and the posts. The length of the
arches of gate 6, twenty-five cubits, see verse 30,
is assumed as the measure of all the arches ; be
cause no other measure is given, and on account
of certain coincidences, to be noticed hereafter.
The short passages 1, 8, are included as a part of
30 the arches, when it is said, verse 31, And the arches
thereof were toward the outer court ; and in similar
cases : see verses 22, 26, 34. It follows of course,
31 that they also are arched. They are not included,
however, when the length of the arches is men
tioned. First, because it would hardly consist
with the simplicity of scripture language to sup
pose, that the length of the arches is to be found by
reducing the quantities of an arched passage, [or
roof,] containing an angle ; or even by a line along
the centre of such an arch. Second, because of
the coincidences alluded to above. In verse 16
above, they are clearly discriminated from the
32 arches. Compare as see 26 and 27. See, also, §
28; 2. The words round about indicate, some
times, the circuit around the front corners of the
arches ; and sometimes that around the inner ones,
2 to l,and 7 to 8. The context in all cases deter-
33 mines. In verse 16 above, it is only that part of
the passages from 3 to 2, and 6 to 7, it will be no

same width, it is assumed, as that in front, or ten
cubits. (18) And the pavement by the side of the 37
gates, over against the length of the gates, was the lower
pavement. 49. A pavement over against the length,
that is, the height of a gate, see verse 11, is also,
over against its breadth. This peculiarity of ex
pression is adopted partly to show, that the pave
ment is not against the entire gate, which includes
the chambers on each side, as appears by the
words, verse 36, and the windows to it, the gate,
round about, but only against the entry ofthe gate,
which alone is intended, when the length of the gate
is spoken of. The breadth of the entry of the
gate is ten cubits ; consequently that is the breadth

38 of the pavement. See 17, 18. It is to be sup
posed that the ground is excavated, so that the
pavement is lower than the rest of the court, inclu-
39 ding the pavement round about. As the pavement is
over against the length of the gates, the presumption
is that the breadth of the opposite gate, 2, is the same
40 as that of gate 1, or ten cubits. (19) Then measured
he the breadth, from the fore-front of the lower gate unto
thefore-front ofthe inner court without, an hundred cubits
eastward and northward. The lower gate is that,
fronting the lower pavement, opposite to gate 1, or,
gate 2. The phraseology seems designed to
place it beyond doubt, that the inner court is that
west of gate 1. The last of the verse, an hundred
cubits eastward and northward, is evidently a concen
trated expression, signifying that the court is an
hundred cubits square.* We learn also, that there
are no gates north and south. Had it been other
wise, they would have been mentioned. As the
line east and west is still, the breadth of the court,
we learn that the breadth of the city is in that
direction.

thereof, and the breadth thereof. 21. And the little
chambers thereof were three on this side and three on
that side ; and the posts thereof, and the arches
thereof, were after the measure of the first gate : the
length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five
and twenty cubits. 22. And their windows, and their
arches, and their palm-trees, were after the measure
of the gate that looketh toward the east: and they
went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof
were before them. 23. And the gate of the inner
court was over against the gate toward the north, and
toward the east : And he measured from gate to gate
an hundred cubits.—The inner court and the gate
toward the east, verse 23, are court II and gate 1 ;
since no other court and gate have been thus de
signated. The gate of the inner court over against
the gate toward the north, and toward the east, it
then follows, can be in no other place than that as
signed for gate 4. It is between that and the north
gate, that the distance is an hundred cubits. It may
be said, that by the same rule, the court, verse 20,
the gate of which looked toward the north, is court I,
since no other has been called the outward court.
And doubtless this would be a just inference, were
it not inconsistent with the statement, verse 23.
That verse explains, that the court, verse 20, is
one not previously mentioned, III; like court I,
outward in respect of the inner court, II, and on
the north. The gate described, verses 20 —22, it
follows, is at 3.

—The prophet and his conductor, in the first
instance, come to the steps in front of gate 1. They
ascend the steps and cross the gate into court II.
Hence the courts I and II are called the outward
and the inner court. In reference to the inner
court, II, court III is the outward court toward the
north, see verse 20 ; and court IV is the utter court
toward the south: see verse 31, &c. The court
mentioned above, is the inner court toward the east.
It is obviously to be inferred, that this court is fur
ther towards the east than the other inner court ;
and perhaps than any of the others. No intima
tion is given that it is an inner court in reference
to the outward court toward the north, or that to
ward the south; it is therefore to be supposed, that
it is an inner court in reference to that which is
called the outward court, without addition, (ex
pressed or implied,) or, court I. For these reasons

1 35—49—(35.) And he brought me to the north
gate, and measured it according to these measures.
See 8. The reasons for placing court VI, as in the
plan, are as follows. First, the gate on the north
is called the north gate, while the other northerly
gate, 3, see verse 20, is called the gate that looked
toward the north; leaving it to be inferred, that the
north gate is farthest towards the north. Second,
it is to be supposed that every gate, the direction
of which is given, is an exterior gate, unless there
are good reasons to the contrary. Third, by this
arrangement the altar, which, it will be seen, is in
front of gate 9, is more readily accessible, from all
the courts, than by any other which can be pro
posed, that is consistent with the preceding. (36.)

merely carried, like the rest, twenty-five cubits to
the right and left of the entrance of the gate.

eight steps. It is to be inferred, that there are no
walls across the arches, forming chambers of the
space between the chambers, as at the other gates ;
since, if there were, with a passage through the
centre, the posts of the south chambers would not
be more toward the outward court, than those of
the north chambers, toward the inner court. It
may be supposed, that in this instance, the entire
'
breadth of the arches, except the posts of half a
cubit, on the south, would be thus left open, for the
greater facility of conveying the burnt-offering, to
be washed, after being slain upon the tables of
stone, as see the following verses. (38) And the 4
chambers, and the entries thereof, were by the posts of
the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering.
The spaces between the chambers, 4, 5, are here
called by the fourth name* of entries. The posts, 5
&c. are just within, near the chambers, and per
haps fronting the arches. Or the gates of these
inner rooms may front the entries, (the rooms
crossing the arches,) and perhaps including one
or both of the side spaces ; but as no particulars
are given, they are not added in the plan. (39) And 6
in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering,
and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering. There
is,
it
appears, at this gate,
a

are not given, but the size of the gate leads to the

the two, which are particularly described, or, that
at gate 9. Circumstances to be mentioned in the
sequel, will make it probable, that the size is the
7 same, or, twenty cubits by eleven.* The position
of the tables is not designated accurately ; but they
are supposed, in the plan, as the most obvious, ar
rangement, to be, the two on the right, equi-distant
from each other, and from the north, east and south
sides of the porch ; and the two on the left, equi
distant from each other, and the north, west and
8 south sides of the porch, See 13. (40) And at
the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
north gate, were two tables.—These tables are on the
ground, a little in front of the porch. They are
placed, in the plan, directly forward of those within
9 the porch. The steps, it may be observed, at all
the gates, are supposed to be three fourths of a
cubit in breadth. This is unexceptionable, in an
architectural view; while a cubit on the one hand,
or half a cubit on the other, would be without the
10 allowed limits. In determining the distance from
the steps, it will be remarked, that they are at the
side, Sfc; yet it seems proper that there should be
space sufficient to admit of passing between the
tables and the steps. The breadth of the passages
within, 4, 5, by which are conveyed the burnt-offer
ings, after being slain on the tables, or five cubits,
combines perhaps, every requisite. That this is
the true distance, is confirmed by the circumstance,

that the two remaining altars, 13, 16, at the sides
of the porch, on being placed at that distance from
the porch, are nearer in front of the centre of the
chambers, 19, 20, than they can be brought, by any
other even number of cubits. (40) And on the other 11
side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
The six tables already mentioned, are at the side of
the entry of the gate. The other side, &c. is the side,
collectively, of the chambers 19, 20, which, as we
have seen, are a part of the gate. These tables
are not within the gate, because different and une
quivocal language would have been employed ; as,
at the side within the gate, or, at the side within the entry
of the gate; &c. And because the expression, at the
side, though of itself uncertain, has acquired, in the
first of the verse, a determinate meaning, which is
jiot to be changed without good reason. They can
not be within the inner court, because there is a
connexion with the porch, which would not then •
exist. It seemed proper that they should be placed
as near the chambers, or thereabouts, as those in
front, to the steps> They are therefore placed at
the same distance from the gate, as 14, 15 ; and
five cubits from the porch, by which they are
brought, as has been remarked, nearly opposite
the centre of the chambers. (41) Four tables were 12
on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of
the gate: eight tables^ whereupon they slew their sacrifice.
The preceding arrangement is here confirmed.
There were four tables on the right side, and four
on the left side; making in all, eight on the north

for the burnt-offering, of a cubit and a half long, and
a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high : where
upon also they laid the instruments wherewith they
slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice. The tables

measured, its form and dimensions are not speci
fied. In consequence of this omission, its place
only, before gate 9, and westward of gate 3, as at
32, is indicated in the plan. It will be urged how
ever, that as the altar is said to be measured, the
particulars alluded to should be, in some way, de-
ducible. And, so far as the altar is a national one,
it doubtless resembles that in front of the visionary
temple, described in succeeding chapters, and of
which this is the model. The altar of the present
delineation however, is also, at times, as will be
seen, to be considered as the altar of a single social
community, or village. This circumstance doubt
less, explains the reason, or at least one of them,
for the omission. The arrangement at the temple,
is followed, in placing the altar before the houses
without, rather than in the court; and also, in
placing it toward the east. That it should be
placed toward the east, is also to be inferred from
these circumstances. The chamber for the priests,
the keepers of the charge of the altar, is at the east
gate. The altar is mentioned after the mention of
that chamber ; and the worshippers from the other
five courts, would thus be brought in front of the
altar, on issuing from the gate toward the north.
The expression, before the house, rather than
before the east gate, may have been adopted,
partly because the altar was placed with respect to
the two gates. Another reason for thus placing
the altar, will appear hereafter.

measured each post of the porch, Jive cubits on this side,
and Jive cubits on that side. —The porch here men
tioned, can not be that at the north gate, because
there would not be room, in one porch, for the two
posts of five cubits, and the four tables. This
porch moreover, is called, by way of eminence as
appears, the porch of the house ; while the other is
mentioned, in the first place, incidentally. Nothing
is said of a gate on the west, or on the south.
There seems no doubt therefore, that the porch of
21 the house, is at the east gate, as see 30. The posts
26, 28, are placed five cubits forward of the gate ;
leaving, as see 24, one cubit in front. A like
22 space is left north and south. [48]
—and the breadth
of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits
on that side. The gate was six cubits broad, having
23 two doors, each three cubits broad. Or, second,
here is an allusion to the Gothic style of architec
ture. The gate is neither arched nor rectangular,
but pointed. I incline to the latter solution : be
cause doors are specifically mentioned, in the de
scription of the gate of the temple; and there
seems no reason, if there were doors, why they
should not be thus mentioned, in the present case.

breadth eleven cubits. —The posts being placed as see

The plan of the city, it will be perceived, bears 26
a resemblance, not to be mistaken, and which
could not have been accidental, to the geographi
cal figure of the old world ; the gate which looketh
toward the east, 1, being Palestine. On combining
this circumstance with the others, that the city is
built for the reception of a people, who have been
dispersed, for many hundred years, throughout
every nation of the old world ; and that no two
gates, which are described, and no two courts or
quadrangles, are, in all respects, similar, can it be
doubted, that this emblematical structure figures
various particulars, relative to these countries.
The returning wanderers will bring with them the
science, literature, arts, manners and customs, of
the various nations, where they have dwelt. These
they will contribute to the common stock, so far
as they may advance the general good, no less
than their wealth and industry. Can it be doubted
then, considering the tenor of the sacred writings,
that there will at least be references to the insti
tutions, civil and religious, and to the history, of
the more distinguished of the several nations. On
an examination of particulars it will appear, that 27
such is the case. There are also allusions to the
future ; that
is,
the future in respect of the time of
the accomplishment
of
the vision. We shall now once
more go over the ground, beginning at verse
5,
in
reference to this view of our subject.

1 5—19—The mere circumstance that the frame
of a city is a map, evinces that it is to be regarded
as an architectural symbol, rather than an archi
tectural plan. Still, in respect of mere architectu
ral arrangement and proportion, something may
doubtless be learned.—It is worthy of remark, that
the form of the parallellogram, Mr. Owen's prefer
ence of which, has furnished a subject for so much
humor to a writer in the Edinburgh Review, is
uniformly preserved.
2 It has been remarked, that in an inspired pro
phecy, every discriminative particular is adapted
to convey important instruction. Such are the
measures of length, breadth, &c. A perfect idea
of the form of the city, might have been conveyed,
without giving any of the dimensions. They are
however, given; and it is to be presumed that
those proportions, which were adopted, were pre
ferable to any others. The reason why they were
thus preferable, seems a proper inquiry in every
case.
3 Allied to these considerations is the question,
why was the measuring reed of the length of six
cubits. That the sacred cubit should be employed,
was to be expected, from the nature of the subject.
Six cubits, or eleven feet, very nearly seems a more
true proportion or rule, as has been intimated, for
the breadth and height of a dwelling house of the
smallest size, or one proper to represent the indi
vidual system, than any other even number of cu

bits. The dimensions of such a house obviously
furnish the appropriate standard by which to mea
sure the visionary city, adapted to the social form
of society. The figurative meaning, it need not be
said, is this, that in founding the new system, con
stant reference will be had to the old ; the advan
tages and disadvantages of the individual organiz- 4
ation, will furnish a scale, by which may be gradu
ated those of the social, about to be established.
The gate which looketh toward the east, 1, as has
been said, is Palestine. That
is,
exclusive of the
additions to the porch, 12, 17. The propriety of

the designation, in a geographico-historical view,

is
not an external one, will now be

Not, in strictness, geographically speaking, for the

the course of the Babylonish armies.
It
is
called
the lower pavement, to indicate the humiliated con

court, I, with a part of court II,* represents the
Turkish empire. The thirty chambers, upon the pave
ment round about, verse 17, are evidently, as has
been seen, in a basement story. They are for the
subjects of the empire, not Mahometan; and who,
though not strictly regarded as slaves, are subject,
in a greater or less degree, to restraints and civil
disabilities. Their situation is very similar to that of
the Jews during the Babylonish captivity. The num
ber of the chambers is thirty, three times ten, in
reference to the threefold division, of Jews, Chris
tians and Pagans.
8 In the inner court, II, the space between the
little chambers, which constitute the addition to
the gate, 12, 17, is five and twenty cubits: see
verse 13. As there is no reason to doubt that the
walls were perpendicular, why is the distance reck
oned, in this instance, and in this alone, from roof
to roof. F^om roof to roof, is equivalent to mea
suring from eves to eves. This mode of mensura
tion seems adopted, to confirm the supposition,
hardly doubtful before, that these chambers repre
sent, as far as they extend, the shores ofthe Mediter-
9 ranean. The breadth wasfive and twenty cubits, door
against door. It will be found, by comparison
on a good map, that 12, 17 reach, the one to
Derne, and the other to Cape Matapan ; indicat-

interior space ; and where, in addition, the sides of the quadrangle.

ing, as nearly perhaps as can be done, the aver
age distance to which the Turks have possessed
on both sides, harbor against harbor. The breadth 10
was five and twenty cubits. If the breadth of
the court, 100 cubits, represent, as will directly
appear, the length of the Mediterranean, the pro
portionate breadth should be just twenty-five cubits ;
the length of this sea being commonly stated at
2000, and its greatest breadth at 500 miles. The 11
coincidences here mentioned, furnish additional
proof, that' 12, 17 are really to be added to the
gate or porch, though this is not in terms express

It will now scarce need be said, that the post of 12
the court round about the gate, 9, verse 14, is that
one of the pillars of Hercules, which has acquired
such universal celebrity. That the posts of three
score cubits, 10, 11, extend, even,
" To where Gibraltar's daring flag unfurl'd,
Awes the wide ocean, and controls the world."
The posts of sixty cubits, it is said, were made 13
by EzekiePs conductor. We have seen, that dur
ing the third woe, all the south of Europe and
north of Africa, are to come under the Jewish dd-
minion. For a time at least, fortified places, gar
risoned by Jewish soldiers, would be needed, for
preserving tranquillity in the newly acquired terri-

This will be, as we have seen, in the time of the
descendants of him, who is more particularly in
tended, by Ezekiel's conductor. It seems there
fore, that he represents, on this occasion, the royal
family, at a remote period; as Ezekiel does, a
succession of the chief men.
14 It may be supposed that the Jewish nation, com
pact Jewish settlements, will spread as far west
ward as 12, 17. Their numbers will be consider
able, on the return of the ten tribes ; and will ra
pidly augment, in consequence of the prosperity,
attendant on the best civil and religious institu
tions.
15 The size of the columns was such, that they
must have risen, in the vision, as if by magic. In
like manner, it is to be inferred, the Jewish ascen
dancy will extend, with exceeding rapidity, when
the time for gathering the vine of the earth, shall ar-
16 rive* To give the reason for supposing that all
the posts, [9
—1 1] are of the size represented on
the plan, it will be needful to anticipate. The
posts of the porch of gate 9, represent, as is sup
posed, the constitutions, in church and state, of
England. These extend to their foreign posses
sions. They are to be adopted, as will soon most
fully appear, by the Jews ; and will prevail in the
military establishments abroad, of this nation.
There seems, therefore, good reason for supposing

that the posts, 9—11, should be of the same size as
those of gate 9, or five cubits on each side. The
supposition is confirmed by the circumstance, that
the posts being five cubits on each side, and sixty
cubits high, the proportional size and height, are
those of the Corinthian column. In a mere archi- 17
tectural view, these columns are not, I believe, an
entire novelty. I have seen, if I mistake not, some
account of a range of isolated columns, in front of
one of the royal palaces in England.* Another 18
reason will appear hereafter, why the height of the
columns is sixty cubits.f
We now return to the gate, which looketh 19
toward the east. The three threshholds, 21 —23,
represent the three periods of the Jewish national
existence, in Palestine, before the fulfilment of the
prophecy. From their establishment in Canaan,
to the Babylonish captivity. From the return from
Babylon, to the dispersion by the Romans ; and
from the final restoration, to the close of the civil
war ; a period, as we have seen, of five and twenty
years4 Their breadth is six cubits, to signify, that 20

of social union are only such as are incident to an
22 elementary stage of national organization. The
space of one cubit on each side, 37 —40, as against
22, 23, which represent the two first of the periods,
23 are for strangers and slaves. Against 21, they are
for converts to Christianity ; that on the one side,
for those of the church of England ; and on the
other, for other denominations inclusively. In
confirmation it will be noticed, that the spaces are
without, not against, the porch. the posts of which
represents the constitutions in church and state;
though they are a portion, (the spaces,) of that part
of the gate which is public, and which, in some sort,
represents The Public. Their breadth is one cubit,
not so much in view of relative proportion of num
bers, as to shew that separate and distinct classes
are intended.
24 The posts of the porch, 18, 19, it has been said,
represent the constitutions in church and state.
This is inferred partly from architectural consider
ations, and partly from the declaration, chapter
43: 8. [ra] Various particulars, respecting the
posts of the chambers, and those of court VI,
furnish additional confirmation. The posts, 18,
19, are supposed to relate to each of the three pe
riods. They are two cubits on each side, to signify,
that the constitutions of these periods, the religious
dispensation, which continues through the three,
and the dictatorial and regal or despotic, govern
ments, of the two first, and the democratic of the
last, [ri] are all adapted to the earliest and simplest

combinations of society. They are less than one
sixth as large as the posts of the porch of gate 9, to
shew that in the transition to constitutional mon
archy, founded upon the social system, and Christi
anity, the advantages will be greater than in the
previous transition from the patriarchal state and
worship. The porch upon which the posts 18, 19 25
are placed, is six cubits in breadth. They are based
upon the individual system. The porch is however,
^
eight cubits in length. A cubit is added o?i each side,
to shew, that under the old regime, the priests lived
after a different manner, partaking, very consider
ably, of the advantages of the social organization ;
and that, during the last period, a party in the state,
the Episcopalians, are desirous of establishing, and
towards the close of the period, (just before the
civil war,) do establish, the modern social system.
Before proceeding farther, it will be proper to 27
observe, that the frame ofa city is to be regarded in
a three fold light. As an historical map ; as repre
senting national institutions ; and, (under the social
system,) municipal institutions. An architectural
emblem, of this complex description, will obviously
require to be judged of by rules, in a degree, almost
peculiar to itself. Particulars of a local and per
manent character, as of government, social institu
tions, geographical limits, &c. will require to be ex
hibited, at different periods, and under different re
lations, by the same or contiguous portions of the
structure. It is apparent that frequently, in the ex

an abstract proposition might seem to require, is
not to be included.
28 The chambers on each side of the gate, are of
the size of the building, measured previous to the
city, to signify, first, that during the three periods
alluded to, the individual system prevails ; and se
cond, generally, that under the social system, all
the essential advantages of the individual system
29 will be enjoyed. The walls are half a cubit in
thickness, as tending to exemplify the advantages
of the most perfect social union. Of these, a mere
apartment is, at the same time, a simple and highly
perfect, architectural emblem. The walls singly,
would afford little shelter. If one were wanting the
shelter would be very incomplete. In anearly stage
of society, it is needful that every one be competent,
in a great measure, to the supplying his own wants.
In the most perfect social combination, on the other
hand, quite the reverse of this is the case. For
supplying the most simple wants, the labor of num-
30 bers is requisite. The chambers are arched, as
indicating the security and permanence of the so-
31 cial system. During the second of the periods al
luded to, the intercourse between the nations on
the north and on the south, of the Mediterranean,
is far more considerable than before. Armies oc
casionally march round its eastern limits. Pales
tine is invaded and subdued, by the Greeks, the
Egyptians and the Romans; and these nations in
terfere more, with the institutions, civil and reli
gious, and the various privileges, of its inhabitants,

than had been done by foreign nations previously.
Hence, the chambers, 4, 5, are a part of the arched
galleries, 1 —i and 5—8, which represent the route
to Asia Minor and Europe, on the one hand, and
to Africa on the other.
These arches, as they are called in the transla- 32
tion, it has been mentioned, are laid down in the
plan, as being five and twenty cubits in length, be
cause this is the measure of those of gate 6. See 33
§ 26 ; 29. The breadth of the arches conforms to
that of the chambers, to signify, that under the so
cial system, when abroad, all are still at home. It 34
is remarkable that no mention is made of windows
on the exterior of the building. Fronting the entry
of the gate however, and the arches, there are nar
row windows. The meaning seems to be, that un
der the social system, every thing relating to the
subordinate departments of government, and to the
several callings and occupations, is open to the view
of all. There is none of that mystery, which cha
racterizes the individual system, in other words,
the new testament babylon. The windows of the 35
chambers, the posts, the arches, and the passages
leading from the arches to the inner court, are each
mentioned separately. One purpose doubtless was,
to convey, with that obscurity consonant to the de
sign of prophecy, an idea of the form and location
of the arches. Another object seems to have been, 36
to signify, that the intelligent Jews beheld, by the
light of prophecy, the fate of the nations, which in
vaded and possessed themselves of their land, see

31 ; and also, the diffusion, in the last days, of the
Jewish power, over the countries which these na-
37 tions inhabited. The arches, as the name implies,
are arched, as an appropriate expression of safety
and durability.
38 The breadth of the entry of the gate is ten cubits,
and its height thirteen. These proportions express,
in some sort, the relative influence of the people
and the government. The height of the gate ex
ceeds the breadth, but slightly, to shew, that during
the successive periods, the different governments
39 merely preserve their ascendency. The height ex
ceeds the breadth by three cubits, to signify, that
the three departments, which exist, however de
rived or vested, in every government, the legisla
tive, the executive and the judiciary, are but just
enabled, in consequence of the want of fixed prin
ciples, and of the insubordination of the people,
during the two first periods, and of the imperfection
of the governments in all, to support their indepen
dence, against the immediate expression, however
factitious or erroneous, of popular will.
40 The posts of the chambers, 29—31 and 33—36,
it will be recollected, are half a cubit on each side,
and they front the open space of the gate. The
same is the case at the other gates, where posts
are mentioned, except the north gate. Posts, as
has been seen, represent systems of rules to be
observed, or statutes. In the present case, they

quired, rights of parties, using the term parties

in its most enlarged acceptation, are opposed to,
and inconsistent with, the interests of the com
munity.
We now see why there are palm-trees upon only 41
one of the chambers of this gate. There are at
least two, for they are mentioned in the plural, and
there is no architectural or other reason perhaps,
for supposing that there are more. They refer to
the priests, who, during the two first periods, lived
in the temple ; and to the party in the state, the
Episcopalians, who, during the last period, are in
favor of, and finally adopt, the social system. It is 42
remarkable, in another view, that the palm-trees,
at this and all, except the north gate, are not to
wards the entry or open space of the gate, but to
wards the space between the chambers, or, the
front of the arches. The meaning obviously
is,
that under the individual system,
a
few only, not the
public, are in prosperity. At the north gate, where
the social organization
is
more particularly de
scribed, the arrangement
is
entirely different. See

tions, past and prospective, will, for a moment,
doubt. Various associations, not generally re
garded as "secret societies," whose purpose is to
acquire objects not avowed, or avowed objects by
secret means, will, indeed, be included. It will be
sufficient here to observe, that in the millenium, as
there will be no conceivable reason, defensive or
otherwise, for the forming of such societies, it is to
be presumed they will not then exist. Accordingly
it appears, that at the north gate, already mention
ed, in consequence of another disposition of the
posts and chambers, no such spaces are found.

ing, to a certain extent, is the same. Viewed as a
map, the various particulars will of course, require
to be applied, with little exception, to other people
than the Jews. It is such of these, as are merely
local, that will require to be especially noticed, at
present. Some other circumstances, variously cha

at gate 3, we begin to perceive those coincidences
spoken of, § 26 ; 29. There is a compound refer
ence to the great outlines of the coast, to national
divisions and those of climate, having respect also,
to commercial importance and naval power, which
is truly striking; and leaves no doubt, that the mea
sure of the arches of gate 6, is to be taken as that,
of the other arches, in reference to some of the
leading geographical features, using the term in its
more extended sense, of the several continents. A 3
meridional line, drawn from Le Conquet, (over
against Ushant,) and another from the river Don in
the same latitude, may be considered as including
the inner court, and the sides of the quadrangle,
with the additional space, opposite the inner court,
north and south. Those portions of Europe, with
out these lines, will then fall into the sides of the
quadrangle, &c. east and west. Such being re
garded as the termini, and this seems by far the
most obvious arrangement, it will be found, that the
gate alluded to,* extends from the mouth of the
Baltic, to beyond Riga and Revel, including, among
other places distinguished for extensive commerce
and opulence, Copenhagen, Lubec, Dantzic, Kon-
ingsberg, Riga and Revel. The following rivers
are also wholly or in part included. The Elbe, the
Oder, Vistula, Niemen and Dwina. The outlet of 4
the arches, on the right, is against the White Sea. }'
* The chambers, it will be recollected, are a part of the gate.
t It will be recollected, that previous to the rise of St. Petersburg,
the maritime commerce of Russia was carried on by the way of the
White Sea.

That on the left, includes the mouth of the Seine,
and the harbor of Cherbourg.
5 It is remarkable that at each of the gates, 1 and
3, there is more than one palm-tree, probably two.
At gate 5, that number is particularly specified ;
and at each of the other gates, where palm-trees
are mentioned, there are several, but the number
is indeterminate. The reason has been given why
there are two at gate 1.* The reason at gate 3,
seems to be this. One refers to the social system,
as adopted by several of the nations of Europe,
after the example of England, as see p. 115.f This
form of the social system is finally to be received,
during the third woe, by all the nations of Europe.
6 The other refers to the democratical form of the
social system, which is to be adopted by Russia,
and the Catholic nations, after the defeat of the
king of the north.
7 The gate on the south of this court, 4, resembles
the lower gate, 2, in not being described. Nothing
is said, in either case, of steps, chambers, arches,
&c. This leads to a presumption of something in
common, in the figurative meaning. The lower
gate, as we have seen, is Babylon. The inquiry
immediately arises, may not the other gate help to
determine the question, what is intended by the
New Testament, or Mystical, Babylon ; a symbol
evidently derived from the literal Babylon. The

slightest glance at the map, will leave no doubt,
that gate 4 alludes to Rome; though there might
be some difference of opinion, as to fixing the pre
cise boundaries. The difficulty arises from the
irregular form of the Mediterranean. It need
not be said, that gate 1, and the posts, describe
the shores of the Mediterranean, and gate 3, the
southern shore of the Baltic. Considering the
south line of the posts, 10, where against the gate,
as equivalent to a line drawn east and west, from
Cape de Larmi, or the southern extremity of Italy,
and chambers being supposed, as at the other
gates, the chambers on the right will include the
city of Rome, and a great portion of the Papal ter
ritory. I incline to the opinion however, that the
line should be carried higher, perhaps as high as
Mileto; and in conformity with my purpose, of add
ing nothing, in the plan, which is not specified, the
chambers are omitted. In any mode of measuring,
a portion of the papal territory is within the gate,
exclusive of chambers. The allusion to Rome is
therefore unequivocal ; would, indeed, be scarcely
less so, if this were otherwise, if only a portion of
the adjacent waters were included within the gate.
In reference to the size of the gate, it may be add- 8
ed, that it conforms to that of gate 2, for obvious
reasons; and that conforms to gate 1, because the
larger gates had not been previously described, and
because the pavement, 49, was by the side of the
gates, over against the length of the gates, that

of the larger gates, most of the Roman territory,
in any case, and if the south line were adopted,
Rome itself, would be included, aside from the
9 chambers. No doubt can exist, I conceive, that
Rome is, in some sort, a representative of Mystical
Babylon. Not as respects her religious errors,
these are described under other emblems ; but be
cause of her pre-eminence in those arts and prac
tices, peculiar to her on whose front was written
MYSTERY. That her practical organization affords
the most striking example of the evils of a system, the
reverse ofthat, which it was a prime object ofthis vision
to introduce. It was thus alone, that the literal Baby
lon was pre-eminent in her time. Her despotism was
less ferocious, and her idolatry less monstrous and
cruel, than those of many other nations. The pre
eminence of Rome is evinced, in the multiplicity
of unprincipled intrigues, involving all manner of
bribery, that of factions and states, as well as of in
dividuals; and at a time when her opportunities
for religious knowledge were almost exclusive, and
her professions of superior sanctity, unbounded ; in
the facility of purchasing absolution, for the most
enormous offences ; in the frequency of simony, in
every form and grade ; and lastly, in the sale of in
digencies. Her station in the mart, whose burn
ing is described by St. John, was indeed the place
10 where sale is made of the souls of men. It is a
remarkable circumstance, that though the city of
Rome is not within the gate, in that small portion
of the papal territory, which is included, is the city

of Loretto. Loretto, the riches of whose shrine,
the gold, the silver and the precious stones, might
compare with those of ancient Belus. I say nought
here of idolatry, if indeed, in the literal sense, it
ever existed. It is a far different character of the
offerings at Loretto, of which I now speak. Is there
not reason to fear, that they were often made, in
the spirit of paying a sufficient penalty for vices
and crimes, an adequate pecuniary forfeiture, where
repentance and reformation can alone avail. It has 11
been said, that Rome is in some sort, a represen
tative of Mystical Babylon; it will be recollected,
that Rome is not Mystical Babylon. That sublime*
harlot, that magnificent and ever changing phan
tom, in whose appearance and decorations, are em
bodied all the false splendors, and pomps, and de
ceitful vanities, of the world, sat, also, it will be
remembered, upon peoples, and multitudes, and na
tions, and languages. She is every where, whereso-
e'er the allurements of individual possession tempt
to the sacrifice of virtue for a price.*
It will be contended that all allusion to Rome,
under this personification, is to heathen Rome ;
and that therefore, in the present case, as in the
preliminary instance of ancient Babylon, at gate 2,
the view is retrospective. Alas, is not the city here
described, essentially, a Christian city, built in pre
paration for the millenium, yet the priests, the

keepers of the charge of the altar, are found at
another gate.
13 The gate next mentioned, is that toward the south,
or gate 5. The gate extends from about 120 miles
eastward of the Cape of Good Hope, nearly to the
mouth of the eastern Calabar, in N. lat. 4° 30'.
The outlets of the arches include, on the one side,
the western portion of the gold coast, and on the
other, the mouth of the river St. Christopher's.
14 It has been said, that at this gate there are two
palm trees. The language might possibly be con
strued to mean, that there are four, one on each of
the inner posts, or, one on each side of 4 and 5 ; I
prefer a different construction, for these reasons.
All the terms of the description are literally com
plied with, on the supposition that there are but
two ; and the circumstance, that at gates 1 and 3
there are two on one of the posts, and none on the
others, shews that architectural uniformity is not
indispensable. Besides, the more obvious phrase
ology, were there four, would be, and it had palm
15 trees, two on this side, and two on that side, upon the
posts thereof. The question then follows, were the
palm trees, one on this side and one on that side,
of the gate, or of one of the arches, 4 or 5. I in
cline to the latter supposition, because we are
freed, on this supposition, from a difficulty which
will attend the other. It would still be doubtful,
on which of the two posts, on each side of the
gate, the respective palm trees should be placed.
It will be recollected also, that at each of the gates,

1 and 3, the two palm trees are on one side of the
gate. There will be no doubt, in the present case,
that the palm trees are on the side of the gate,
most known and distinguished, and that is the side,
where is a portion of the settlements near the Cape
of Good Hope. The two palm trees seem to refer
to the English and Dutch population, or rather, to
the social system, as it is to prevail among these
colonists. That they should conform to the so
cial system, after its adoption by England, was to
be expected ; but there is perhaps, a still farther
meaning. That the kingdom of Holland is one of
those nations, heretofore alluded to, which will
early follow the example of England, and adopt
the social system, as there established.* Many
considerations, and among others, this, that their
habits of neatness, order and industry /would enable
them to make the change with greater facility per
haps, than any other nation, render this exceedingly
probable.

in conformity with the general structure of the plan,

may be safely traversed. There seems also, an
allusion to the prevailing influence of England ; a
distinguished instance of the exertion of which,
about this time, in compelling the northern nations
of Africa, to allow the Jews among them, to de
part, with their wealth, for the land of their fathers,
is spoken of in another place. [n] See 26.
19 This gate is the only one, the arches of which,
are not turned to that side where are the steps.
The arches are toward the utter court, verse 31, so
denominated in respect of the inner court, II, to
represent the difficulty which nations abroad ex
perience, in having any communication with the
interior of this continent; though the nations of
its northern border, have ever kept up a very con
siderable intercourse. Accordingly, the outlet of
one of the arches is against a distinguished route
for caravans, towards the south ; the other is
20 against the river Nile. The gate includes the king
doms of Tunis and Tripol; one formerly much
celebrated, and the other still somewhat so, for
foreign commerce. It also includes, of course,
the site of ancient Carthage.
21 There are one or more palm trees, on each of
the inner posts of this gate.* The allusion at this
gate, and at gate 7, seems to be merely a general
one. That

The greater part of China is within the same 22
parallels of latitude, as those countries within the
interior of court I. On referring to a map of China,
there will be perceived, a striking adaptation of
the proportional spaces and distances, of the gate
and arches, on the east of court V, to the leading
geographical characteristics of this most interest
ing region. The gate includes the rivers Hoang 23
and Yang-tse-kiang, and the cities Nankin and
Hangtcheou, the latter scarcely inferior to Pekin
or Canton ; together with the province of Tche-
kiang, the most extensive, wealthy and populous,
in the empire. In the arch on the north, is the 24
outlet of the Pai-ho, on which, and its tributary
streams, is the city of Pekin, the capital of the
empire, and the wonderfully populous and fertile
district, with which it is surrounded. The arch on
the south, comprises the city of Canton, and a con
siderable portion of the river upon which it is situ
ated. In this admeasurement the peninsula or 25
island of Louitcheou, and the most of Further and
Peninsular India, are considered as included in the

of Europe, or south of Africa ; while to the east
ward of gate 7, there is another court, though not
immediately contiguous, that is, the continent of
North America. Sweden, Norway, &c. must be
regarded as included in court III, though the north
side, since but one exterior boundary could be de
lineated, represents the coast from Ushant to St.
Petersburg, with the southern coast of the White

This evident and pointed recognition of the exist

for this department of the subject. A mere outline
is all that I can hope to give.
The gate on the north, 8, differs, in various par- 2

perhaps alluded to, more particularly.
3 It will be recollected that the dimensions of the
porch, the breadth of the steps, and the exact po
sition of the altars, are not specified. Should any
reader have doubts of the justness of the principles
adopted, in reference to these particulars, I beg
him again to consider those parts of § 28, in which
they are discussed. I am solicitous as to this point,
on account of an interesting result to which we are
4 conducted. Let a line from St. Bees to the mouth
of the Tweed, represent the north side of the
quadrangle. Another line, from the centre of this
to the south side of the island, will represent the
entire length of the quadrangle, or 134 cubits. This
is clearly the most obvious, if not the only prac
ticable, arrangement. On the first mentioned line,
place the porch : its breadth, from east to west, in
proportion to that line, and its length, from north
to south, in proportion to the other. It will then
be found, that the altar, 11, its distance northward,
being determined by one line, and its place in front
of the steps, by the other, is on the site of the an
cient borough of Lanark, as at 12. New Lanark,
so long the scene of the observations, and benefi
cent labors, of Mr. Owen, is distant from the bo
rough, about one mile. The maps made use of,
though modern, were not, perhaps, entirely accu
rate. Nor can I affirm that the admeasurement

I could make

I conclude there is no essential error. I cannot
suppose that any degree of accuracy would carry-
Lanark without the space required by those offi
ciating at the altar.. But even if this were the case,
in a slight degree, the allusion to Lanark would be
scarcely less questionable.
It is equally certain, that the allusion is not to 5
any peculiar opinions of Mr. Owen, on the subject
of religion or government. The emblems relating
to these momentous topics, are at another place.
Neither can it be to that just and considerate treat
ment of the laboring poor, which Mr. Owen found
attended with such eminent advantages. This is
all included in the moral precepts of the religion
just mentioned. The allusion can only be, to the
social system. The part which Mr. Owen has 6
acted, in bringing the social system before the
world ; and continuing its intrepid and persevering
advocate, is universally known. Even Mr. Owen's 7
celebrated doctrine of "Circumstances," is far from
being new- Who maketh thee to differ from another?
and what hast thou that thou didst not receive: is said
by him under whose control are all the circum
stances of our lives. Train up a child in the way
he should go ; and when he is old, he will not depart
from it. The social system has, however, the un

ed. Under the individual system, few indeed can
•be trained in the way in which they should go.*
8 The character of the emblem leaves no doubt as
to its determinate import, in the present connexion.
It is a table or altar, on which, as on the others at
9 this gate, are slain the sacrifices. The sacrifices
were then, it seems, conveyed to apartments with-
10 in the gate, where they were washed. In these
apartments were hooks, an hand broad, fastened
round about. These could not have been, as is
supposed by some, hooks for suspending the ani
mals while flaying them. For this purpose, hooks
of a far different form would be required. They
are such hooks as were once used, for supporting
the spits, in the process of roasting. The marginal
11 reading, and-irons, is doubtless the correct one.
After the sacrifices were washed and prepared, in
these apartments, they were again carried and laid
12 upon the tables. The chamber 21, is for the
priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. The
opposite chamber, 22, is probably for .persons of
distinguished consideration. The pos4s of these
chambers are towards the passages leading to the
apartments, where the sacrifices are washed, &c.
Those performing this office are therefore under
the particular direction of the public authorities.!
There are also posts to the gates of these interior
rooms; indicating appropriate organization and

authority, even in this subordinate department. It 14
would seem that the Jlesh of the offering is laid upon
the tables, at the same time with the instruments
wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacri
fice. The sacrifices are burnt-offerings, and 15
sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings, although the
city is built after the restoration of the Jews, and
their conversion to Christianity, and when, of
course, literal sacrifices are unknown. And, final
ly,
the tables are of hewn stone;* in which respect
they differ materially, from the altars designed for

will be of the best description, and in abundance ; that
so far as circumstances render it expedient, it will be
furnished, as on those occasions, upon public tables.
17 The posts of the gates of the apartments where the
sacrifices were washed, frc. are toward the arches
2, 3 and 6,7; at least, these apartments are in im
mediate connexion with the arches, intimating,
that the tables will be enriched with the choicest
products of every clime. Partaking of the good
things of God's providence, in a right spirit, with a
humble, penitent and thankful heart, is equivalent
to the various sacrifices of the former dispensa
tion.*
1 8 The size, height and number of the tables, col
lectively, represent that the individuals of the so
cial community, will dwell together like the mem
bers of an ordinary family. The height is one
cubit, the breadth one and a half. They are suit
able for one person. The number, appropriate on
other accounts, is near the average number in
families. They are of stone, to denote that perma
nent and sure provision is made for all. None are
liable to experience the effects of poverty and want.
19 A degree of resemblance, in the arrangement of
the tables, to that in an ancient baronial hall, will
not fail of being noticed. When it is found, that
the diversities of rank, with the appropriate ob
servances, are of Divine appointment, it will be ad
mitted that they' are designed for the general bene-

fit, and not for the advantage of a few privileged
individuals. The table more particularly spoken
of heretofore, 11, is for those who engage in ma
nufactures. The one opposite, 10, is for such as
apply themselves to agriculture. —Those at the
sides, 13, 16, as will directly be seen, are for ser
vants. Those on the porch, are for persons of
rank, wealth, high station, distinguished acquire
ments, &c.
The chamber 21, is for the priests, the keepers of 20
the charge of the house ; that
is,
as we have seen,
for the secular authorities. They are called priests,
because their ministration
is
no less in the fear of
God, and tends no less to promote the service of
God, and the great cause of human happiness,
than that of the priests the keepers
of
the charge
of
the altar. The number can hardly exceed two,
since the interior of the chambers
is
but about nine
feet square. They are probably a superintendent
or director, and an assistant. Millenial institu- 21
tions,
it
scarce need be said, will conform to the
rule, that when integrity and capacity can be se
cured, public affairs are best conducted by a few.
The chambers 22, 19, 20 are probably for per- 22
sons of rank and wealth, but without official
station. The posts of 19, 20, are towards the
altars 13, 16; hence
it
is
supposed that these are
for servants.

part of America, or Greenland; or rather, the North
American continent, inclusively. See 59.

24 The palm-trees are on each side of the entry of
the gate, instead of being, as at the other gates, on
the sides of the space between the chambers.
They thus indicate universal plenty.
25 As respects the dimensions of the porch, see §
28; 6, with 31; 29,30. The application, in the
present case, is sufficiently obvious. The social
system, practically considered, is founded upon
just theory; and requires, for the development of its
most beneficent influences, the agency of appro
priate civil government, and religious institutions,
26 The chambers of the singers, 23, 24, are be
tween the chambers of the priests, the keepers of
the charge of the house, and those of the priests
of the altar, to signify, that the most perfect agree
ment subsists between them ; that is, between the
civil authorities and those of the church.
27 On turning to the map, not many coincidences
are observed. This is called the north gate, verse
35, and the principal district, where it is situated,
is Northumberland. Here are the rivers, North Tyne
and Reed. Will it be deemed ludicrous, to allude
to the immense supply of fuel, in the vicinity of the
rooms appropriated to the culinary department.
28 If the frame of a city be a map, two inferences
see.m unavoidably to follow. That the institutions
of England are to be adopted by the Jews, when

previous to that time, the social system will exten
sively prevail. It is in other prophecies we learn,
that it is thus to prevail, in England, near sixty

years before, or as early as the year 1865. If then,
the final re-establishment of the Jews commence, as
we have endeavored to make appear, in 1923,
ample space will be allowed, for the arrangements
of the social organization, to be brought to a good
degree of perfection, previous to the time when
the institutions of England will be required, as a
model, in founding the last and permanent Jewish
monarchy.
It has been mentioned incidentally, that the posts 29
of the porch of gate 9, are supposed to represent
the constitutions of England in church and state.
The porch is twenty cubits in length, by eleven in
breadth. There is allotted, in the plan, for each
post, an area ten cubits square ; leaving, in front
of each area, a space ten cubits long and one
broad. This is the most obvious division ; and of
the remaining possible ones, there seems no rea
son for preferring any one, to several others. It
will be recollected, that the measure of six cubits
is made an emblem of the individual system. In
like manner ten cubits, ten, as the element of nu
meration, being, in some sort, the most perfect
number, is a fit emblem of the social system.
Thus, of the two constitutions, the social system is
the basis. The posts are five cubits on each side,
half of ten, to represent, that church and state are
mutually dependent. Their united circumference
is "equal to that of one of the areas of ten cubits.
The spaces in front are for the pillars. The pil- 30

front of the posts, to signify, that a precedence is
enjoyed by the king and royal family, in every thing
which pertains to their station, no less than in the
circle of official duties. They are the most
perfect examples of correct moral deportment, and
the great patrons of whatsoever embellishes and
gives its greatest value, to social life.
31 It will be objected by some, that if the frame of
a city be a map, the altar is upon the ocean. But
was there not a manifest propriety', in the altar of a
people, whose home is on the deep, every one of
whose floating habitations will, in due time, become
a bethel, who are to be the chief instrument in
diffusing true religion, along with the best political
and social institutions, who, themselves, inhabit an
island, and the most of whose domain is in the
islands of the sea, or the lands beyond, was there
not a manifest propriety, in the altar of such a
32 people being thus located. The post on the right
of the porch represents the constitution of the
church. The altar represents the church as
practically organized.
33 The particulars concerning the religious estab
lishment, are considered in a subsequent part of
the vision. We there learn, beyond doubt, that it
is,
exclusively, the national church, the Church of
England, which

serve as a model for the Jews. Nothing further is
required, [as respects the religious establishment,]
for completing the outline intended here, but a
slight notice of the system, in its usual operations.
To this intent, the court is, again, it would seem, to
be regarded in its character of a social commu
nity or village. The chamber of the priests of the
altar, 25, like that of the other description of
priests, at the north gate, is merely sufficient for
two persons, a priest and an assistant. In the
millenium, doubtless, every village will be supplied,
at least with a pastor and colleague, that the exer
cises of the sanctuary may never be suspended, and
that all the duties of the station may be ade
quately performed. Why the priests are called the
sons of Zadok, among the sons of Levi, as at verse
46, will be seen in another place. [»]
Every village will require the superintendence of 34
the national government. The proper place for
the chamber of the officers of the national govern
ment, seems to be opposite that of the priests of
the altar ; the post representing the civil constitu
tion, being in front. We now learn why it is said,
verse 48, and the breadth of the gate was three cubits
on this side, and three cubits on that side. One side
is for one description of public men, and the other
for another. There are not two doors, but the
limits are accurately defined, by the form of the
gate, which is of a peculiar style of architecture.

can be imagined, more happily illustrative of the

Gothic arch.*
35 The height of the gate is not specified, a con
firmation perhaps, since that of all the others is
mentioned, of the supposition as to its form. Its
breadth is three cubits on each side, in allusion to
the threefold character of millenial institutions,
which include, as equally requisite to that state of
felicity, which is promised, the civil government,
the religious establishment, and the social econ
omy; the preservation of each of which, is a
solemn duty, incumbent on all in public situations,
civil or religious.
36 On the map few coincidences appear. A line
drawn southwardly, from the mouth of the Tweed,
till it intersects another, drawn eastwardly, from
Lizard Point and Beachy Head, being regarded as
the east side of the entire quadrangle, The Wash,
or rather, the inlet, between Spurn Head and St.
Edmund's Point, represents, with tolerable accu
racy, and in a striking manner, the position of the
gate. The entire gate, including the porch, is
against the diocese of Lincoln, the largest in the
kingdom. The city of Lincoln, with its vast cathe
dral, which is, perhaps, to be accounted the first in
England, originally built in the Gothic style of archi
tecture,]' is just within the court, west of the gate.

Gothic church is said to be, I know not how truly,
the loftiest in the kingdom, is within the gate, on
the right.
A highly interesting question arises, what 37
change, if any, are the form of government, and re
ligious establishment, to undergo, previous to the
time, 1923, when they are to serve as a model for
the renovated Jewish kingdom. Upon this subject
prophecy throws some light. We learn directly,
or, indirectly, by the account given of the Jewish
institutions, that the government will continue an
hereditary monarchy ; [n] and that the sovereign 38
will be head of the#
church. [zi] That there are
two legislative bodies, one hereditary, \ri] and one
elective. That the former consists, in part, of dig
nified clergy ; [n] and singular as it may seem, that
the latter, as now, is not apportioned, in reference
to numbers.*
The only changes mentioned in prophecy, so far 39
as I am aware, are these, that a part, at least, of
the spiritual lords, and of the more exalted juridi
cal authorities, will hold their stations by inherit
ance, and not by appointment. [n] The reason is
obvious ; that these important departments may
have the benefit of that aptitude of talent, which is
the consequence, in time, of hereditary occupation.
The objections which might exist, at present, in re
spect of these particular trusts, will have less and
less weight, under the progress of millenial institu
tions.

40 The great outline of the constitution will re
main the same, but the government will undergo
a marked alteration. The people will become
more intelligent and moral; will confide in their
rulers, an indispensable requisite to the well being
of a community; will perceive the advantages of
union, in the prosecution of the great objects of
society ; will be disposed to obey, rather than elude
the laws ; to strengthen the authority of those who
bear sway, rather than assail it continually, like a
hostile territory ; as well from a better understand
ing of their own interests, as from an increased
sense of the obligations of duty. The rulers, on
the other hand, will have less indirectness of pur
pose ; more leisure ; and, in general, better qualifi
cations. Greater perfection will be given to the
arrangements of every department ; and the struc
ture of society will be incomparably less complex.
41 These changes, the natural result of the social or
ganization,* will give to the government, all the
energy of the most perfect military despotism ;
while, at the same time, its paternal character will
be more and more developed and confirmed. The
public authorities, having nothing in view but utili
ty and the general good, may be likened to the che
rubim seen by Ezekiel, in a former vision, whose
course in'the heavens, unlike that of the bird, was
directed with unerring precision. They ran to and

in steady progress, at the time contemplated.
The other division of our subject will require to 42
be considered, in reference to the order of the
church, the terms of communion, including the test,
and the articles of belief.
A large portion of the remainder of the vision is 43
occupied with an account of the order, or constitu
tion, of the Jewish millenial church. We there learn,
that this is the same as that of the church of Eng
land at present. That the sovereign will be its
head. That the clergy will consist of three classes,
bishops, priests and deacons ; and that, as now in
England, there will be a subdivision of the first
mentioned class. An important change in the mode 44
of appointing, (not consecrating,) pastors, will be
noticed as we proceed.
The terms of communion and the test, will be 45
spoken of hereafter. [n]
The remaining question, are the articles to be 46
changed or superseded, involves considerations of
great moment. We learn, by the promises in the
following chapters, that this vision describes the
commencement of the millenial state among the
restored Jews. We also learn, by these promises,
in connexion with the purifications that are com
manded, that the worship of the sanctuary, as might
be expected, commences at the same time, in pu
rity. It is equally certain, that the worship of the
sanctuary is copied from that of England. These
considerations alone, are sufficient to prove, that

when she whose term of abode in the wilderness is
almost expired, shall again find a resting place, it
will be, not in Palestine, not in the cities of the
Seven Churches, not in Rome, but in England. It
will not be supposed that aught material, indeed,
that scarce any thing, will be erroneous, or defec

47 England, in other words, The True Church, at
that time. At this very time and place, as we have
seen in the sublime language of Isaiah, The moun
tain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top
of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills ;
and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people
shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the

which is this word of the Lord, is diffused through-
48 out all the earth from the Church of England. Will
it be believed that such a church has no creed.

on the other hand, shews, that in the present con
dition of the world, in consequence of different de
grees of knowledge, and the great variety of pre
possession, different minds arrive at directly oppo
site conclusions, upon almost every point in theo
logy. Without a summary of the doctrines which
are expected to be taught, there is then no assu
rance that those who, from time to time, are ad
mitted to the office of instructing, will not teach
the very principles which The Church, and this
Church must now be a judge, deems directly
subversive of the great objects of revelation. It
would seem however, quite needless to discuss the
subject, since the denominations, which insist that
creeds are of no utility, are identified by their pe
culiar tenets. The latitudinarian has his range of
belief no less than the Catholic. It is not entirely
irrelevant to say, that even the sceptic believes, and
thinks he does good service to mankind by extend
ing his creed, that truth is unattainable.
There is a view ©f the subject which is of high 49
importance. "Without uniformity in religious in
struction, neither the church nor its doctrines will
be respected. Much of the infidelity so prevalent
among the uneducated, and much of the practical
infidelity, which prevails so universally, I might al
most say, among nominal christians, is owing to
the want of this uniformity. The limits of tole
ration however, are given in another part of the
vision. [w]

[§31
50 The question returns, are the articles to be al
tered, or their place supplied by others, previous to
the establishment of the millenial church, among
the restored Jews. It may be inferred from pro
phecy, that before that time, the articles of the
church of England will be, in a great measure,
perfect ; it remains to be determined, by a careful
examination of other portions of Scripture, whe
ther they deserve that character at present.
Though the church of England be the true church,
it is perhaps questionable whether, at the time of
the adoption of the articles, the human mind was
prepared for a faultless system of Christian belief.
It will be admitted that the articles are venerable,
that the church has flourished since their adoption,
and produced great and illustrious names ; but we
are also compelled to acknowledge, that they were
framed when little was known of the philosophy of
the mind, and when a just logic had scarce begun
to prevail, at least in theology. That they contain
statements inconsistent with the first principles of
belief; and, what is still more extraordinary, incon
sistent with the plain declarations of Scripture.
For proof we need not go beyond the first article.
" There is but one living and true God. And in
unity of this godhead there be three persons, of
one substance, power, and eternity." That
is,
the
Supreme Being consists of three persons, having
a separate identity, no less complete than that of
three persons, in the ordinary acceptation of the
term

with infinite perfection, the language is totally in-
52 adequate. Another objection to the articles is,
that they are employed in acquainting us with what
is not the truth. Is it to be supposed, that the creed
of the millenial church, will be occupied, in any
part, with an exposition of the errors of popery.

ing a residence for her, whose sojourn in the wil

them are to witness the sublime pageant, which
will celebrate, at once, her restoration, and the

To speak without metaphor, the prophetical
period demands a change. Because, the time has
arrived, when pure and consistent Christianity is
55 about to prevail. The spirit of the age demands
-
it. With many acute and independent minds, the
solemn and imposing words, the mysteries of our
religion, will not, as heretofore, sanction absurdity.
56 Infidelity demands it. Though infidels will ever
assail the Scriptures in vain, they have waged no
unsuccessful war, not less to their own satisfac
tion, than the disgrace of Christians, against re
ceived formularies of belief. And what multitudes,

and earnestness, have the irrational and inconsist
ent creeds of variant sects, prevented from read
ing and acquiring a relish for the sacred writings,
and turned into the heartless and dangerous paths
of infidelity, in the very outset of life. Once more, 57
the heathen demand a change. The way of the
kings of the east is almost prepared ; and the mo
mentous responsibility devolves upon the true
church, of furnishing a system of belief, unencum
bered with sophism or cause of doubt ; that the
great work of their conversion may progress, with
accelerated velocity, and free from the disputes,
and schisms, and tumults, and above all, from that
practical infidelity, which have been the opprobri
um of the Christian world, in times past.
I shall conclude with a few remarks of Mr. 58
Owen, which are worthy of being attentively pon
dered, by Christians of every denomination. Must
we not admit their applicability, though in some
cases, to a limited extent, to the creed of the
English church, and to all others, as well Christian
as Mahometan and Pagan.

I have now, I believe, noticed every particular at
the two gates. The several emblems present a
connected system, which includes, at the time of
the final re-establishment of the Jews, all in
England, or, rather, the united kingdom, who be
long to the national church, and have adopted the
social system. I have said, all in the united king
dom, rather than England. In one point of view at
least, this seems the true intent. There appear
somewhat the same reasons for including Scotland,
Ireland and the islands, in the quadrangle, as for
including the northern peninusula in the quad
rangle which represents continental Europe. It is
in this view that I have supposed the utter court,
verse 37, was the north eastern part of North
America, or rather, the North American conti
nent.* When the emblem is considered in its geo- 60
graphical outline, it need not be said, that Scot
land is a portion at least, of the utter court. The
north and east sides of the quadrangle including
those of the national church, and who have em
braced the social system, at the time alluded to, or,
retrospectively, the former, there is an obvious
fitness in assigning the two remaining sides of the

to the Dissenters. We have seen, at gate 4, that
in the millenial city the Catholics have no altar
and no posts. They neither practice their reli
gion, in public, nor possess any authority. It will
soon appear, that the case is very similar with the
61 Dissenters. [n] It will be recollected, that soon
after the time of the accomplishment of the vision,
that
is,
the time of the permanent re-establishment
of the Jews, [1923,] the social system

to become

cognized ; the seventh year being distinguished by
observances, which made it to be called the sab
batical year. In prophecy, a still larger septennial
period, of seven thousand years, may be clearly per
ceived. A short time before the beginning of the
seventh thousand of years, reckoning from the cre
ation, the millenial state commences. After a pre
paratory millenial sabbath of about one thousand
years,* during which, millenial institutions become
universal, and a considerable portion of which may
be likened to the period of the building of the se
cond temple, when the faithful worshippers labored
at the work, with arms in their hands, commences
the splendor of the millenium. This glorious event
is brought about, by the universal diffusion of pure
Christianity, the best form of government, and the
best social institutions. Thus, at gate 8 there are 3
eight steps, to signify that, at the commencement
of the eighth thousand of years, the institutions,
which are there figured, will universally prevail.
At gate 6 there are eight steps, to signify that, at 4
the same time, pure Apostolical Christianity will
universally prevail. The African church was highly
distinguished, for the purity of its doctrines, and
the learning of its teachers. It is chosen, on the
present occasion, partly perhaps, because the two
other gates, within the sphere of the primitive

steps, to signify that, at the same time, a truly pa
ternal government will be universal. Whatever
faults may exist in the structure of the government
of China, it must be admitted, that no other govern
ment is so worthy of being called paternal.
6 If the general plan of interpretation, in this case,
be the true one, it will be admitted, that the greater
number indicates the time of the completion of the
work of the introduction of millenial institutions.
Again, as the several departments of the millenial
economy, are all alluded to, in connexion with the
greater numbers, it may be presumed, especially in
the absence of all discriminate intimations, that the
allusion, founded upon the lesser numbers, will be
inclusive. It will also be allowed, that the intro
duction of millenial institutions, must be a progres-
7 sive work. These principles being conceded, it
may be supposed, that the number of steps at gate
3, is seven, to express, that millenial institutions
will begin to prevail, in the nations within court III,
or continental Europe, at the commencement of
8 the seventh thousand of years. In like manner,
the number is seven, at gate 5, to signify, that these
institutions will begin to prevail, at the same time,
in a national view, in the colonies and dependencies
of England. These, as we have seen, are to in
clude, in the course of the seventh milleniary pe
riod, the greater portion of the globe.

mentioned, but is assumed, in the plan, to be six,

because, somewhat previous to the conclusion of the
sixth thousand of years, millenial institutions are to
commence in England and Palestine. It scarce
need be said, that the change of regime, which will
here be noticed, in the explication to the numerical
token,is fully warranted by unequivocal intimations,
in other prophecies.
A circumstance worthy of notice, in a geogra- 10
phico-architectural p'oint of view, is, that the steps
all descend towards the ocean, except at gate 1,
where the descent is towards the plain country, be
yond the mountains by which Palestine is bounded
on the east.
Five of the gates, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, are fifty cubits in 11
height, by twenty-five in breadth. The height of
gate 9 is not given. Gate 1 is thirteen cubits in
height, by ten in breadth. The figurative meaning,
in this latter case, has already been spoken of. See
§29; 38, 39. Much in the same manner, the di
mensions of the five larger gates are supposed to
indicate the relative proportion of the elective, and
of the more permanent, or, hereditary, branches of
the government. The gates are fifty cubits in
height, and twenty-five in breadth. Thus there is
one popular or representative department, the
house of commons. There is another, the house
of peers, which is hereditary. The kingly office is 12
also hereditary. The judiciary is not referred to,
because, in the millenium, the judiciary will be
little more than nominal. The numerical symbol 13

is a fourth of a hundred, rather than a third, in this
case, to intimate, that there is still, so to speak,
another department, in the government, the basis
upon which the pillar rests, and this is enlightened
public opinion.
14 The height of the posts, 10, 11, court II, it will
be recollected, is sixty cubits. They are ten cubits
higher than the gates, to signify, that the govern
ment in those regions, for a time after they become
subject to the Jewish sway,* will continue, in a de
gree, more strict, as partaking of the military cha
racter, than in other parts of the empire.
15 The sides of the quadrangle, upon ordinary ar
chitectural principles, will be somewhat higher
than the gates. The gates being more than ninety
feet in height, the sides of the quadrangle will
hardly consist, with the basement, of less than ten
stories. There is then, making liberal allowance
for public rooms, the most ample space, in each
quadrangle, for six hundred persons, and very suf
ficient space for a thousand. These numbers ex
press the limits perhaps, which it would not be
expedient to fall short of or exceed, in the organ
ization of a social community, designed to assem-

one hundred cubits on each side. Such an area
contains a hundred lesser ones, of ten cubits on

perhaps, for the commencement of a social commu
nity.*
It is observable that court II, where is the Me- 17
diterranean —and court V, are the only ones not
measured.
If our hypothesis of the form of the city be cor- 18
rect, the order in which the several gates and
courts are visited, will be found strictly logical :
and this circumstance reflects no inconsiderable
proof of the justness of the theory. The prophet
is brought, in the first instance, to Palestine, on the
east. They then cross to the Mediterranean, and
continue along its shores, to the straits of Gibral-
ter. Thence return, and proceed eastward to Ba
bylon. Thence, as appears, they follow the stream
of population round the Euxine, to the north of Eu-
rope.f They next return to the Mediterranean, to
visit the papal domain. Then, as it would seem,
proceed, by the usual route, to the Cape of Good
Hope. This sufficiently indicates the discovery of
a new way to China and the east. They return
northward across the African continent : but before
measuring gate 6, cross over into court II, as ac-
* See $ 31 ; 29.
t The singular phraseology, already noticed, at the close of verse
19, seems intended to confirm this idea. Then measured he the
breadth, from the fore-front of the lower gate unto the fore-front ofthe
inner court without, an hundred cubit* eastward and northward.
They are thus left, immediately before proceeding to gate 3, on the
north of court I.

north ; and to intimate, that the entire continent
will not be freely traversed, till a late period. They
then go eastward, . by land, to China; in view of
the intercourse which is to subsist, at a future
time, in that direction, between China and British
India. And last, they proceed to England. Eng
land was known to the ancient world, after the
other divisions. Her agency is latest in the pro
phetical series ; and here are found the most im
portant particulars of the emblem.
19 We are now to consider one of the most extra
ordinary particulars of the delineation ; that is, the
circumstance, that although the North American
continent is clearly alluded to, it makes no part of
the frame of a city, nor is there mention of any
gate toward the west.* The allusion may be made,
partly, to confirm the inferences respecting the
general form of the city ; but the allusion, in con
nexion with the omission, requires explanation.
The reflections which most obviously arise, how
are the Jews of America to return to Palestine ;
how are the remaining population to enter the
millenial city. In either case, the most direct
course is, by the way of the gate of the court toward
the east: [gate 7.] Where the emblem is compound,
it scarce need be again said, the explanation will
conform to the circumstances. Returning by the
gate toward the east, the Jews will find, in the first

tional independence being restored, any govern
ment which may be established, will, in some sort,
be paternal. In strictness, however, the new go
vernment will be oppressive. For the first five
and twenty years, as we have seen, a portion, and
the more enlightened portion, of the restored Jews,
will be in a kind of bondage :* they pass through
the lower, or Babylonian gate : [gate 2.] They
proceed to gate 1, or Palestine, by the way of the
lower pavement ; the same by which the Jews re
turned from the captivity ; a course, in its varied
associations, up to the time of the completion of
the second temple, sufficiently indicative of the
civil war. They enter the gate which represents
Palestine, from the rising of the sun, as did origi
nally their great ancestor; and afterwards, his
numerous descendants, when fleeing from the bond
age of Egypt; and also, Ezekiel and his con
ductor, at the commencement of the present
vision.
The Americans, it is probable, will enter the 20
millenial city, also, by the way of the east gate—
by returning to a paternal government. They will
not need, however, to advance beyond the first
court —although America is alluded to at gate 7,

TO THE
INTRODUCTION.
Note (A.) P. 7.
The diffusion of Christianity in the Roman empire, seems
to have been the signal for that decline in letters and the
arts, which preceded the dark ages. Or, if this be attri
buted to the invasion of the barbarians, (who however, were
early converted to Christianity,) on either or any hypothesis,
how favorable a contrast is afforded by China. There, no
period of intellectual darkness succeeded one of refinement ;
and when subverted by the uncultivated but warlike tribes
around them, they imparted civilization to the barbarian con
querors, while the government was improved, by the diffu
sion of new vigor in its several branches. It is quite cer
tain then, that the present superiority of Europe, which is
but recent, in some, perhaps in most of the arts and sciences,
is attributable, as is so often and confidently alleged, to the
prevalence of Christianity. It is said that hospitals were
unknown in heathen Rome. However this may be, the
pauper system of China, practically enforced as it is, by pub
lic sentiment, is far superior to that of any people in Chris
tendom. The regulations of their prisons have probably, for
a long time, been superior to those of any Christian commu
nity, till within a few years. Much is said of the unfair

The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and giten to
a nation bringing forth tlie fruits thereof Matt. xxi ; 43.
Here is a determinate promise, that the peculiar privileges
of the Jews, should be taken from them, and given, not to
the Gentiles, but to another nation ; and which should better
improve these inestimable advantages. It will soon, I trust,
be made to appear, to unbiassed minds, that this nation is
England. To such as may believe that any nation has, as
yet, brought forth the things of the kingdom of God, in the
emphatic sense evidently intended here, I can at present
only say, that their views appear to me, exceedingly de
fective.

Note (E.) P. 42.
Some now attain to the age of one hundred and eighty.
And so certainly as like causes produce like effects, this may
be made the ordinary age of man. To doubt that heredi
tary constitution may be improved, to any degree of which
an example can be given, is contrary to all experience and
analogy. And no particular occupation or mode of life, is
more conducive to longevity, than many others. Probably
all may be made equally so. It would seem unsafe to as
sign any limit, to the practicable extension of the term of
human life, other than is assigned in prophecy.

It is worthy of remark, that a philosopher of the nine

partiality for the Scriptures, and the tenor ofwhose researches
was peculiarly favorable to a correct judgment, arrives at
the same conclusion. —" Covetousness has been made the

besides, the arrangements are far more perfect now than

I had hoped to furnish, in the entire work, the most am

Note: It may be added, that according to our exposition
Rev. 16 : 12. describes the discovery of the passage round
the Cape of Good Hope.
Note (E.) P. 114.
The immense population and resources of China, ren
der it a matter of incalculable importance, to themselves
and to the world, that Christianity should be introduced,
without those scenes of dissention and bloodshed, which
have usually attended its introduction in considerable na
tions. I cannot but doubt entirely, the morality and po
licy, in reference to the accomplishment of the object,
of introducing religious publications, into this empire, con
trary to the laws. All would admit, I conclude, that a mis
sionary might not procure a subsistence by stealing from
those heathen, whom he wished to convert. Yet are not the
injunctions in scripture, against disobedience of the magis
trate, as peremptory and unqualified, as those against theft.
In the former case, a missionary might argue, with at least
equal plausibility, I only take a portion of the superfluous
goods of this man, which were acquired by fraud, and which
will be a snare to him and his children, and am thus enabled
to preach the gospel to thousands, and perhaps may save the
souls of many. Nay further, it might be said, it has always
been deemed allowable to take the property of others, for
the immediate preservation of life ; but here it is taken, to
save themselves from spiritual death. Yet why is a violation
of the Divine precept, in the one case, deemed dishonorable,
utterly inadmissible, and in the other, of no account. The
solution is doubtless to be found, in that natural propensity
to insubordination, and those vague conceptions, as to the
duty of submission to the powers that be, which are so gene
rally prevalent. Yet it would doubtless, be found impossi

ble, aside from the commands of scripture, to give any
satisfactory reason, why the rights of self-government, in an
independent nation, should be deemed less sacred than those
of property, in individuals of that nation. The example of
the Apostles can no more be urged, than that of the Israelites
in exterminating the nations of Canaan. The Apostles were
inspired men, specially authorized to introduce Christianity,
at a peculiar conjuncture, by the only practicable means.
They wrought miracles in proof, not only that the gospel
which they preached, was, indeed, of Divine original, but
that they vxre duly commissioned to preach that gospel, and
that they preached it in its purity. Is there not reason to
fear that the methods now pursuing, may lead to results,
which will be fatal for a time, to the cause ; and which
humanity will long deplore. We may be sure, that during
the two thousand years, almost, since the promulgation of
Christianity, the fittest and best time, for the conversion of
this nation, has not arrived.

It would not comport with the plan of the present work,
to examine the question of the possibility of blame-worthi

Mr. Owen denies. I would only observe, that before Mr.
Owen's doctrine can be supported, even upon natural prin
ciples, it will be incumbent on him to explain the phenomena
of remorse. Those distinguished individuals, to whom he
refers, as having been, from age to age, aware of the errors
of existing systems, have believed, with scarce an exception,
that it was no less a native sentiment than regret, hope,
pity, &c. Setting the question of blame or criminality, for
the present, entirely aside, the scriptures carry the doctrine

of circumstances, into a future state. They assure us, that
those who die under certain circumstances, will be forever
deprived of unspeakable advantages, which, under other cir
cumstances, they might have enjoyed. And they profess to
make us acquainted with those circumstances, by which these
advantages may, in all cases, be secured.
Note (G.) P. 120.
Should these pages meet the perusal of Mr. Owen, let
me indulge a hope, that they will give him a better opinion
of the Bible, than he has hitherto expressed. What a strange
anomaly would it present, if an individual, thus honorably
distinguished by one of the prophets, and alluded to, in a
manner scarcely less unequivocal, by two of the others,
should continue to doubt the inspiration of these men. Mr.
Owen complains of inconsistency. Let me assure him, as
the testimony of one, who has spent considerable time, in a
careful examination and comparison of the scriptures, and
under circumstances, in some respects, peculiarly favorable,
that this inconsistency does not exist. That it is to be found,
only in the systems, or their progeny, which were formed
in those ages of darkness, when the early simplicity of the
gospel was lost, and had scarcely begun to be restored, by
the progress of a conclusive logic. I would insist, no less
than Mr. Owen, as a preliminary to receiving any alleged
system of revealed truth, upon its agreement with itself, and
with all known facts. And I do not hesitate to affirm, that
upon this basis, the scriptures are worthy of credit. Of the
supposed discrepancies, nearly all may be satisfactorily ex
plained. The few which cannot, (I believe there is not one
in the prophetical writings,) are caused by errors of tran
scribers. Some few of these were to be expected, consider
ing the past history of the sacred text ; and doubtless, in all

cases, (certainly in all which are in the least material,) the
right reading will be restored. The multiplied coinciden
ces, on the other hand, between writers so remote from each
other as to time, so diverse in respect of rank, acquirements,
&c. aside from prophecy, can be accounted for, only on
the hypothesis of inspiration.

I am willing to believe, that the Gothic style of architec
ture, so fruitful in ennobling and sublime associations, was
first employed, as is alleged, with considerable probability,
in England ; and that one of the earliest distinguished appli
cations of
it,
consisted
in
the repairs, about the year

and which are still extant, of the metropolitan cathedral.

While

I
do not hesitate then, to express an

to allay discontent. The reasons for this opinion will be

be convinced, practically, of its utter inefficacy. Did I not
believe, that England is specially under the Divine protec
tion, that she will be preserved, and that the institutions
spoken of, will be transmitted, without material change, to
the millenial age, as a most precious inheritance ; indeed,
that their existence is essential to the introduction of the
millenium ; I should regard the measure, particularly if car
ried to any considerable extent, as fraught with peril to the
government, and to the established church, and as throwing
an ominous shade over the glorious prospects of the nation.
—It should seem that its extreme injustice and impolicy, in
view of prospective contingencies, must be admitted, by the
most sanguine advocates of reform, upon a little considera
tion.
Note (J.) P. 151.
It is shewn in the comment on this passage, that it is a
figurative Zion and Jerusalem, which is intended. The re
mainder of the chapter evinces this conclusively. In verse
5, the house of Jacob are exhorted to walk in the light of the
Lord, along with the other nations. Verse 6—9 describe
the condition of the restored Jews, previous to the civil war.
The following verses describe the fall of the individual sys
tem in Palestine, (immediately after which this vision com
mences,) and elsewhere. Mount Moriah and mount Zion
were different portions of one mountain, within the walls of
Jerusalem. Upon the former was the ancient Jewish tem
ple, and upon the latter, the royal palace. It is obvious that
the words in the quotation above, tlie mountain of the Lord,
allude, (figuratively, not directly,) to the entire mountain.
In the comment upon this passage, I have endeavored to
shew, that the mountain of the Lord is the social system. It
rises in the midst of Jerusalem, or, the English church. As a
