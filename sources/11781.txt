I had the injection and expected to wake up on the ward post-operatively. I am a nurse myself.

I woke up and found myself in a darkened room lying on a bed that was made of a fabric with all glittering squares. My immediate thought was 'Where am I?' I expected to be on the ward. The information flowed into my head that I had swallowed my tongue in recovery.

I felt fantastic, wonderful, happy and full of joy, which was great as I was suffering from depression at the time.

Suddenly in the distance is heard a shout of 'Roll her over!'

The next thing I knew I was back in a bed on the recovery ward.
