I AM pleased, indeed, at this interesting crisis, to have it in
my power to confirm, 'at least,..some of the most important facts
stated in the "AWFUL .DtSCLOSURES." l allude to the fac~ of
Maria ]Honk's .having been a Nun in the Hotel Dien Nunnery
at Montreal; and to that of the· subterranean passage ·leading
from that Nunnery to•the Seminary or residence of the Priests.
There are now in this city s~veral 'persons of respectability,
whose.veracity we have no reason to doubt, who have commu-
nicated to me·various.facts ·relative to the Hotel ~icu Nunnery
and to the Priests of Montreal, which leav:es not a doubt on my
mind -but that the Discloshres .of M:aria "Monk, ·at,:oleast;:as to •
some of the most important of her statements~-are true:· ·· ·~ '
So~M'.of these persoi1~ are professing Christianst:members o{
-differen(. evangelical churches .in this city; atid ~Of them, .:I
be.i.ieT(', without exception, sustain a goOd, moral chamct!'r·
ifft•.:ef them is a member of the church to which I !Delong,my-
eelf,·a brother in whom 1 place the most implicit con6cience. .'
· · .Tile testimony of these persons appears to l_>e, .and;.l think, •
· ia, wholly disinterested. . They were all living in Montreal a(·
the. time connected with the facts to which they bear testimony,
and have since removed to.this city. . · , .
lu; most of the persons, whose .testimony lo
am now about to
lay before the public, have, for ~arious and weighty reasoJ1S1 de-
sired me,to suppress their names, I lay their testimony open
precisely as I received it, without the slightest altc~ratioil, , nug­
mental;on, or diminution. ;• The testimony of most ,of thinn'I
have in their own hand-writing. If necessary, both I awlthey
ar~· willing to confirm our testimony upon oath. ._,., ,: 1

>
•1. We will first adduce the .testimony which proves.MariiL'. •
Monk to have been a Nun in th~ . Hotel . Dieu·Nunnety in Moll- - :•
treal. It is the testimony of a lady who is now·married. and
living in this city with her tmshand. She statest.thaLshe 'Was
with Maria Monk at Mrs. Workman's school in Montreal;..and
that she .and Maria Monk entered the.Co'ngregatiorial Nunnery
at about the same lime i that.Maria Monk remained about t'Wo
years in the Congregational Ntinnery; and that shortly after
1" . . .••
•
DECISIVE CONFlllM.AriON,
this she entered the Black Nunnery. She states that she saw
Maria Monk while she was a novice in the Black Nunnery, and
conversed with her in the gardrm when she we~t to ~ee ar. ac-
quaintance in 'he Hospital of that Nunnery. .
Tliis same lady slates, in regard to herself, that her brother
called to see her at the Congregational Nunnery, where she was
still residing as a nuvice, and that while they were talking to-
gether in the parloir, her brother saw a Priest, the Rev. Mr.
---, in the adjoining room, put his anns around the neck of
a Nun, and kiss her. "Seeing this, my brother," (says she,)
"cxclaime{'' '0, my God, what kind of a place is this !'-or
some such expressions-' Is it possible that my sister is in such
a place as this !-I will get you out of this place if I have to
tear you out.'" In consequence of this, the lady states, that her
parents withdrew her from the Nunnery. She states, fn~·ther­
more, that some time after she left the Congregational Nunnery
she visited the Black Nunnery, to see an acquaintance in. the
Hospital, and that there she saw Maria Monk servina the col-
latiun, or lunch, and that she was there a veiled Nun. She
states that she was going to speak to Maria, but that she made
a sign, by putting her finger across her mouth, that it was time
vf silence.
2. The next testimony we have ofMaria Monk's having been
a Nun in the Hotel Dieu Nunnery at Montreal, is thai of are:~
spectable young gePtleman, who states that he was personally
~cquainted with Maria Monk and her family·in ~lontreal, and
that he has heard Maria Monk's own mother say that she was
in tho Nunnery. · . ·
Both the above witnesses say, moreover, that the Maria Monk '
who is now in this city, the Authoress of the "AwFuL Dis-
cLosuREs," i'l identicaliy the same Maria Monk who was in the
Hotel Dieu Nunnery at Montreal.
Having now proved, by two respectable and .disinteresftld
witnesses, that Maria Monk was a Nun in the Hotel Dieu Nun-
nery in Montreal: we \viii now proceed to substantiate the fact
of the subterranean passage spoken of by Maria Monk, \vhich
her hook \ells us. leads from the Nunnery to the Seminary of the
Prif-sts.
The testimony which we now bring is that of a respectable
lady in this eity, who is a pious member of an evangelical
thurch. She states that she saw a subterranean passage four or
five feet, as near as she can remember, from the surface of. the
ground. It was built of stone, and appeared to her to be nbot\t '
seven feet wide. She states that she saw only a part of the
tlepth of the wall of this subterranean passage, and that it np-
Jeared to extend from the Hotel THeu Nunn13ry in Montreat

across St. Joseph-street to the parisl~church, in the ~irection ~­
wards the Seminary. Thi~, she states, she saw in the year
1813 or 1814, at the time when some Canadians were employed
in dlgging a ditch for the conveyance of water in pipes thrQngh
the street.
4. rrhe testimony which we now adduce is that of a respect-
able young gentleman, a native of Montreal, and who arriv~
in this city not quite a year ago. He states, thilt while the
foundation of the large church opposite the Hotel Dieu Nl1n·
nery was being dug, he saw a subterranean passage which
crossed St. Joseph's-street, at the Hotel Dieu Nunnery, and
passed on in a direction towards the ~eminary. He stat~ !llso
that he understood, from the Canadians who were stamJipg by,
that it was used as a passage in tirqe of the 9ld Frenc}l W,!'-r-,Jo
lead from the Nunnery to the Seminary. , ..... .
5. The following is the testimoqy of a person who1 a~ , Jte
states, was, a fe\V years ago, a pupil in the Seminary at Mo~·
treat, to which place he states he was sent by the ~ishop of
New-York for the purpose of studying, pre:>aratory for t_
ho
Priesthood. He informs me that the account of the subterra•
nean passage leading from the Seminary at Montreal to some
place, supposed to be the Hotel Dieu Nunnery, is correct. IJe
been states that he has seen the entrance of the subterrane~n ~e,
are~-;"" -~..,.:::--~"'""ll
_ that it is by the way of the cellar, under ~he yard, in the rear
1ally. of the Seminary. · ., • .
and We have now, we think, satisfactorily proved two of the most
was important facts in the "AwFUL Discr.osuaEs ;"that is, that the
Maria Monk, who is the authoress of the!'~ Disclos~res, was a
Nun in the Hotel Dieu Nunnery at Montreal ; and that the sub-
terranean passage, of which she speaks in }ler book, does really
exist, and that it passes, as she states, under ground, from the

These two facts being proved, what must the world conclude
-what can the world conclude-but that the subterranean
passage from the Seminary to thP Nunnery is used as a secret
passage of communication for the Priests. The.subterranean
passage is there, affording a ·communication for the Priests un-
der ground t6 the Nuns in the Hotel Dieu Nunnery. So cer-
tain are we of the existence of this subterranean passage, that
we hesitate not to say that by digging a trench from three to
six fP.et deep from the .comer of Notre Dame street, and extend-
ing down St. )oseph-street tQ the end of the Nunnery1 this very
identical subterranean passage would be laid open to the view,
because, there, most certaiply, it is. Although they shoulq. at-
tempt to fill np this passage from the interior of the Nunnery,
in order to prevent discovery, it will be utterly out of their

a diligent and scrutinizing search were to be made. We thinlc
that the public authorities of Montreal arc, in deference to pub-
lic feelinO', to the importance of the thing, and in duty, bound
to have ti~e search mar.le, aud to have it done without delay.
They have denied that Maria Monk was a Nun, or that she
ever lived in the Hotel Dieu Nunnery. It being now proved
that she was·'a Nun, and that she did live in the Hotel Dieu
Nunnery, ·it follows that they have uttered what is false; a pre-
st~inptive evidence that,the Disclosures of Maria Monk arc but
too true. ,., •
· Wha~ convinces us, furthermore, that these disclosures are
trite, is'the fact that Maria Monk had never spoken' a word to
ariy.'one on the 's'ubject until she was taken dang-erously ill in
the Alms-house, and was not expected to live. The Rev. Mr.
T~@an, who was the 9haplain of the institution, was then sent
forby her, aria when he entered her room, she told him she hnd
s61Dething important to communicate to him, a'nd that she could
not' die iri' pca,ce without disc.Iosing it. · She then imparted to
him tlie'substance of what she has disclosed in her book. This

A c_
ertain Mr:'G. Vale·, of this city, has published a Review
of the "AwFUL PrsCLOSUREs," some few · points of which ·I
'viii here touch upon ; the rest may pass for what they are
wortli. In page 8, 9, and 10, of the REvn:w, Maria Monk 'is
made out to have "fix~d upon herself the character of ·li' delib-

Mr. Vale, in his Review, p. 13, seems to find an insuperable
objection to the veracity of Mari3. Monk's statements, from
something that he discovers relativE" to her a~re; but we are en-
tirely at a loss to find out where this f>reteud;i' contradiction lies.
He furthermore s:1ys, in thE? title page cf his Review, that the
facts which he reviews of the Awful Disclosures, are "fairly
stated and candidly examined." Of the fairness of llis state-
ments we have a specimen in his page 13, where he states that
Maria Monk relates that she entered the Catholic school of the
Nunnery, at"ten years of age," and he refers the reader top. 20,
of the AwFUL DISCLOSURES. We turn top. 20, and find nQ
such thing.as her saying that she entered the school of the Nun·
nery at "ten years of age." Her words are precisely as fol-
lows ; " When I was ABOUT ten years·old, my mother asked
me one day, if I should not like to Jearn to read and wri~
French j and I then BEGAN TO THINK seriously OF ATTF-!JD·
INGthe school ir. the Congregational Nunnery," p. 20. It r..tr•
Vale cannot see the difference between THINKING OF DoiNG .~
THING and actually doing it, we presume the rest of mankind,
at least, can see it. · .·
,
s DECIBIV~ CONt-'l lUfATlOl.'f.
The ·young lady does not pretend to state hoi age pre·
ciscly. ' There is nothing at nll strange, or uncommon in
it, if 'she did not know exactly how old she was. When
she. speaks of her nge in relation to the facts which she de-
scribes, she generally use!t tho expression about; showing,
thereby, that she did not pretend to know at what precise pe-
riod of her age tho facts sho relates occurred. In place of ten
years old1 sho might have been eleven, or even ~t eleven,
when she entered the school: would this provo that' • was
relating what she knew to be be false 1 .r
I !tave seen l\Iaria Monk several times, nnd if she had not
told me that she is twenty years of aqe, I would not have be-
lieved that she is more than eighteen. Mr. Vale states that
11 Mr. 'l'appan informed him·that Maria Monk was tlum, when
in the Alms House, or when he was in the hnhit of seeing her,
about twentv-five years old." 'I'he Rev. Mr: 'l'nppnn, whom I
have spoken to on this snhject, absolutely denies that he ever
said any such thiug. The general impression of those who
have seen her, is, that she is auout twenty yuars old Any onc
that would judge her to he twenty-five ye '· ,; of ag.., must, we
should think, be defc<::tive in his eye-sight.
Since Mr. Vale, in his candid Review, is pleased to make so
much of·a difficulty npon >his part of tho subject, we .will now
clear it all up. - - - - -til ·
ci About fen years :''~we will say that Marin M'>nlc was
eleven years old when she entered the school. She informs' us,
that; from this time until she quit th~ Convent; that is; previous
to her re-entering it again to become a Nun, there elapsetifour
or five years, p: 4a. Add this to the eleven, and it will bring
her to sixteen years of ag~. After she was out of tho Nun··
nery some time,·how.l,mg is not s:ated, she went to StDennis,
and after remaining there three m011tns, she returned to Mon-
treal, and was re-admitted "
into the Nunnery, p. 4:3. This add-
ed to the formP.r, brings h~r age up to sixteen years and three
months. She remained in the Nunnery, after her admission
the Just time, as she states ·in ,the title page, two years. 'l'his
brings her age to · eighte~Jn years and ·three months. She made
her final escape from the Nunnery, in the month of December,
in the year 1834. From that time to the present date·, March,
1836, is one year and two months. Now lr·t ns add this to her
a~e as above calculated, aad it makes Maria Monk to be now
mneteen years and live months old. ''Vhen she tells ns, there-
fore, that she is twenty years of age, we have no just reason
whatevP.r, for doubting her word. After her escape from the
Nunnery, she changed her dre!'s, and during the few months
that she still remained in Canada, she passed through various

fll!ont'S nnd trials, which, in th!l precipitation of getting out tho
firct edition of her book, \\'as entirely neglected to he publish-
ei; . 'l'his, however, will nil appear in the second edition, which
is now hciug prepared fm· the press.
Mr. Yolo stnte8 thr•
.t ho was informed by 1\lr. and Mrs. Tur-
pan, tho Chaplain and his lady, that Moria Monk \'las delivered
of a child last Autumn. If la~t J11ly was last Autumn, then
it is true that l'iiW was delivered of n child last Autumn; other-
wise it is untrue that site was delivered of a child !art Au-
tumn; because her child was born in tho month of July. I
have coiled Oil Rev. Mr. 'l'oppnn, who confirms what I have
said, that tho child of Maria Monk was born in July. He de-
nies C\'cr having told Mr. Vale that the child was horn ir. the
Autumn, or tb.H Marin Monk was twenty-five years old. It
was on tho eighth of August that I ' :sited the Alms IIouso
myself to see Marin Monk, at which time, her child was al-
ready about three weeks old. We have now one with Mr.
Vale's Review, in which the facts arc so frtirly stated, and so
cand·idly e:.caminP...:.·-·-Mr. Vale is one of those P,"entlcmen who
deny the divinity of the Christian religion, an• who was c()n-
spieuous by the parr which he took in tho public discussion
against Dr. Sleigh.
The facts which are related in the "AwFUL Dxscr.osuREs,"
are so diabolical, that ono, n
.t first, seems instinctively moved to
disbelieve them. But when we turn over the pages of hi~tot-y,
and read all the atrocities which are there recorded of the Ro-
mish Priesthood, and recorded, too, by their own historians, we
ponder on the question, " why are they not now as capable of
the same enormities for which they have bc-.:n characterized
during a long succession of ages ?"-Ther'J has, just at this
time, been issued from the Press, a work cr.titled "RosAMOND,
or a Na?'rative of the Captivity and St~f)'erings of an Ameri-
can Female, under tlte Popish Priests in tlte Island of Cuba,
with a full Disclosure of tlteir· l'rfmmers and C~tstoms ; writ-
~en by herself," in regard to the truth of which, we thin!{, there
is not the shadow of a doubt. The fact is, that the disclosures
made hy "RosAMOND," are confirmed by testimony that is de-
monstratively conclusive. The disclosures of Rosamond are
true, and nrc proved to be true. E these nr!! true, then, nothing
that Maria Monk has related is at all incredible.
In reading the "AWFUL DiscLosuREs of Marir, 1\lonk,"
there is one fact that sho relates, which at first sight, one might
suppose is alto~ther too improbable to be believed. This is
the pit in the cellar of the Convent. In this pit she states that
the bodies of the children who are the illegitimate offspring of
the Priests and the Nuns, are thrown, after being murdered.
•'
IU DECISIVE CON:F'IRMATION.
This pit, she states, is " so deep that she coma perceive no
bottom," and that "it is abont twelve or fifteen feet across, situ-
ated in the middle of the cellar, and unprotected by any ldnd
of curb, so that one: might easily have walked into it in the dark."
'l'be incredibility of this fact, however, all things considered,
will, we think, afford a motive 'JI credibility. If the authoress
were here relating a fiction ol her own imagination, it is hy far
the more reasonable to suppose that she would have described
this pit in a very different manner from what she has done.
·who is there that '\YOuld not have 'described it as being sit-
uated in the most concealed place that could be found? and
instead of representing it as being entirely open, and of the
width of twelve or fifteen feet, would not have staten that it
was closely covet~d over, with a small trap-door to open into
it 'I ')'his is what every one would expect to find in regan! to
such a place. This, h0wever, she has not stated. There is
something, therefore, in her !'elation relative to this pit, which
evidently seems to be in direct oppositior. to what can oo rea-
sonably expected from fie,,on. It must be granted, too, at
the same time, that there is something of in.::omprehensible
ahout it, when we reflect upon what reason the Priests or Su-
perior of the convent could have for thus leaving the pit open.
llnt in proportion as our dijjiculty·increases here, the credibili-
ty of the authoress increases with it. It would seem, thea,
that the thing was so, and that the authoress has stated the
fact, incredible as she certainly must have known it would ap-
pear, just as it was, rather than relate a mere fiction for the
sake of making a plausible tale founded on falsehood.
'Ve have n'>w one more obserntion to make, and that is in
regard to the challenge made by the authoress; she says,
"Permit me to go through the Hotel Dien Nunnery at Mon- ~
treal," (the place where the horrors sh~ descriJ:.es are said to
have taken place,) " with some impartial ladies and gentlemen,
that they ~pay compare my account with the interior parts of
the building, into which no persons but the Roman Bishops
and the Priests are ever admitted ; and if they do not find my
description true, then discard me as an impostor. Bring me
before a court of justice-there I am willing to meet Latargue,
Dufresne, Phelan, Bonin, &.nd Richards, (the Priests,) and
their wicked companions, with the Superior, and any of the
Nnns, before ten thousand men." p. 15.
This challenge being made, and the accusations laid against
the "HoTEL DIEU NuNNERY" being- of the most atrocious
character, the Bishop and Clergy of Montreal have now a fair
opportunity of vindicating their innocence, and proving Maria.
Monk to be an impostor, if an impostor she is.

DECISIVE CONFIRMATION. 11
'rhe statements made in these "DrscLoSUREs" arc creating
universal excitement through the whole United States, as well
as i~ Canada. Many, and perhaps the generality, believe them
to be true. Under such circmmtances, the Romish Clergy a.t
Montreal ought to accept the challenge.· It is nothing more
than. what 'is due to public opinion. It is a duty, moreover,
which they owe to themselves. · .,.
If they refuse to let the interior, or at least, 11. part of the
interior of the Convent, be examined, the public, then, will be
confirmed in the belief, that the disclosure:; made by 1\'larial\lon.k
are true.
Let us suppase, for instance, that such horribln disclosures
had been made respecting some religious m· literary institutiou
in 'the United States. Let this institution, for example, be Yale
College, at New Haven, or any other of onr institutions, would
not the officers of that institution, in order to remove the least •
ground of suspicion, open their d.:JOrs, and invite investigation 'J
Most certainly they would. In like manner, if the Uomish
Clergy at Montreal, who have now an opportunity of vindicat-
ing their innocence, do not avail themselves of that opportunity,
what can, and what will the world conclude, but that they are
guilty 1
1'hey deny that Maria Monk was a Nnn in the Hotel Dien
Nunnery at Montreal. They have now an opportunity of
proving, (if it is true th~t she was not a Nun,) that Maria Monk
is a calumniator. Deference to public feeling, and duty to
themselves, if they. are innocent, loudly demand of the Bishop
of Montreal, to prove that the Disclosures of Maria Monk are
calumnies and falsehoods; aud this they can do, provided her
statements are false, by merely opening a·few doors in the Con-
vent, and introducing some respectable and disinterested persons
into the interior of it. .
They will have to do tl1is, we repeat it again, or else the
world must, and will believe, that the Disclosures, awful as
they are, are bnt too trne. "" .
I know not whether the Disclosnres are all true or not.
Some, and I can-say many of her statements, I know to be true;
and I know it, from my own personal lmowledge relative to
Nunneries. I have been a Popish Priest, have had the super-
intendence of a Nunnery in Kentucky, and conseqnently, I
must know something about what Nuns are, and wha~ Nun-
neries are.
I a m .now preparing for the Press a second edition of the
first volume of the '~DowNFALL," to be printed in a book-form.
In this, I have some important disclosures to make relative to
Nunneries in the United States, part of which has never ap-

peared before the pnhlic. If this were out, the public uiind
would he well prepared for the "AWFUL DisCLOSUREs" of
Maria Monk; or for any other disclosure whatsoever ; for in
my humble opinion, and I speak from personal knowledge of
the subject, there is· nothing, howevet· shocking it may be,
which is not perpetrated in the secluded haunts of Popish
Nunneries.
Trnth needs not the aid of calumny imd falsehood. If the
statements of Maria Monk are false, I wou!d be among the first
to hold her up to public scorn. The truth or falsity of her
Disclosures can be easily attested by the accepting of the cluil-
lenge she has given, If it be not accepted, I, for one, will be-
lieve her statements to be true, awful as they are.
Evasion now is futile. Jesuitism is brought to its dernier.
1'f!Ssort. The door must be opened, or every mouth that speaks
will cry out, guilty-guilty-guilty. ·
The annexed plate represents a fact described by Rosamond,
the American female, who was held captive under a Popish
Priest, in the island of Cuba during five years. It is the cut-
tinQ; up of young ne(J'roes and making them into sausages:
"Father Francisco, w~o was the Confessor of Poncheetee, was
the Priest who obtained the reprieve of some of the robbers who
were condemned for killing black people, and making sausages
of them. This occurred just before, and at the rime of my
first coming to Havanna, about eight years ago. They were
Spaniards, Frenchmen, Italians, and Portuguese, who belonged
to the gang. They had their trial while I lived on the island,
and were condemned. I saw twelve of them hung. There
were about fifty belonging to the gang. Some were sent to
the Spanish mines. Of those who were reprieved was the
captain. He had a great deal of money ; and \vith the former
8'overnor, and the Priests, money would save any person's life
trom the gallows.• I have frequently heard people say, that
they carried on ~heir robberies two years before they were de-
tected. 'l'hey lived about two miles out of the city, by the
Montserat gate. They used to seek ont the young and fat ne-
groes, to make up the sausages. Those who bought and eat
them, said they were the best they ever eat. 'rhey called them
French sausages ; and people far and near would buy them.
They were detected hy two young negresses, who were sent
out according to the custom of the city, with dry goods, and
other articles for sale, in the streets, as is customary. One of
• Captain J. E. Alexander, in his tour through the W est India islands, tells
us that, "If a criminal has money, he may put otT capital punishment for
years, even after sentence is passed upon him; but he who is friendless and
penniless, mouqts the scaffold immediately after he has been found gnilty of a
capitnl offence.'' Alexander's TnANBATLANTIC SKETCUts, Vol. I. o. 357.-Ed.

them was fat and ycung. They called her into the house, pre-
tending to want to purchase some goods ; and told the other to
go along and sell. She waited opposite the house somo time,
for her companion to come out, until she was tired; and then
went to the door, to ask_ for her. 'fhey told hnr she had gone
out at the back door some time since, which alarmed her, lest
they had robbed her of some of her goods, as it is not uncom-
mon for the natives to call in those Mashons, who sell goods, to
pilfer them ; and th~n the poor slaves are punished by their
master or mistress most cruelly for the loss. If they die in
consequence of their punishment, there is no law to inquire how
they come by their death.
. "The negress returned immediately to her mistress, and told
her about her companion's going into the house, arid not com-
ing out again; and she took the commissaries, together with
the soldiers, who guard the city, and went to the house, to
demand her slave, without thinking she was murdered. The
commissaries saw all was not right, and sent for more soldiers
to help them. When they reachd the place, they found the
girl in their slaughter room, with her head cut off, and a num-
ber of other dead bodies, which they were cutting up. 'fhey
took, at that time, eight~oen· of the murderers, and coq,fined them
in Moro castle ; and numbers of others were taken afterwards,
and confined in this prison.
"Father Francisco was one of the influential Priests, who
signed the request which was sent to Puerto Principe, and to
the king of Spain, in order to obtain the reprieve of part of
them. Those who were reprieved gave immense sums of
money to those that obtained their pardon. The way I learned
that Father Francisco had befriended them, was through Man-
uel. When he told me that Francisco had got the power, and
the will of Poncheetee's money, he added, that he was always
fortunate in gettmg hold of persons who had money, and men-
tioned this instance of his befriending the cannibals in proof of
it." "RosAMOND," p. 188.
This relation,·incredible as it may appear to some, is con-
firmed by the testimony of Doctor Ethan A. Ward of this city,
a gentleman highly esteemed as a physician, and for the integ-
rity of his moral character. This gentleman \vas in Havanna,
a11d sa\Y the wretches executed for the atrocious crime above
described.
The Doctor returned to New York about two years before the
escape of Rosamond, and had frequently mentioned the fact of
the men's being executed for the above mentioned deed, even
before ·such a petson as Ro~amond's being in Havanna was
known in this city ; and Rosamond, the authoress of the Nar-
14 DEC:lSlVB Co.t-a.'HtMA'I'iON.
rative, related the fact to her friends in this city, previous to her
acquaintance with Doctor Vfard, and without knowing that
any one had been informed of it.
Nor is this the only instance of such a horrid crime. The
sam!! deed took place a few years ago, in the city of Paris ;
and the miserable criminals were publicly broke upon the
wheel for it. The facts upon record are as follows :
"A countryman (of the richer sort) having come to Paris on
business, went into a barber's shop to get shaved; (from whence,
in the sequel, it appears he never came out again.) He was
tollowed by his little dog, who attracted the notice of the bar-
ber's neighbours, by remaining near his door, day and night,
howling and moaning without intermission, to ·the great annoy-
ance of the barber, who tried to drive him away or destroy
him, without success. In the interim the countryman's friends
coming to ascertain the reason why he did not return, heard
of the dog's singular conduct, and knowing their friend had a
· little dog with him, these persons proceeding to the barber's,
knew the dog to belong to their missing friend ; he also knew
them, and his rage against the barber became furious. The
Police, attracted by the man's friends accusing tJ:w barber of
murder, and the unceasing rage of the dog, commenced search-
ing the premises ; and, to _the horror of all, discovered a trap
in the shop floor to let any unfortunate being whom the barber
might choose to destroy, fall headlong to the cellar beneath.
Searching further, they noticed a door artfully concealing a
passage leading under ground, to a celebrated pie-malwr's
kitchen, four or five houses off. Horrible to relate, they found
the master pie-man, and another, making minced meat for pies
of the flesh of persons whom the barber had entrapped for
that purpose. Shocking as this seems, it is nevertheless a real
fact, and publicly substantiated."
There is another fact related in the "AWFUL PxscLOSUREs,"
which ·appears, 1t seems to many, to be wrapped up wholly in
incredibility ; and this is the account given by Maria Monk,
of the Priests, keeping a register of the names of the infants
that are destroyed in the Nunnery.
We would ask, in the first place, who is th«:lre upon earth that
can account for all the oddities and irreconcilabilities in the
conduct of the Popish Priesthood, those advocates and support-
ers of that despotic spiritual power which in Scripture is em-
phatically styled, "Mvs'l'EitY, BAnYLON THE GREAT, THE
MoTHER oF HARLoTs, AND ABOMINATIONS oF THE EARTH T'

vice of the" Beast,'! I will endeavour, si~ce I have been ini-
tiated:-·into someof the mysteries, to state what I think is the
probable reason for keeping a· register of the names of those
poor unfortunate children, who, Maria. Monk declares, are first
baptized, then murdered, and finally thrown into the pit. . I
think it is very probable that' the Nuns do not generally know
that the children are all 'murdered, but, that they, on the con-
trary, are made to believe that some of them, at least, ate pre-
servoo and sent to the Foundling Hospital. Iu order, theretore,
to gratify these poor deluded women, the birth of the children is
put'·upan record, that they may afterwards know how old their
children"are, and, flO'ni-time to time, have the gratificatit;m of
sl!eing and conversing with them. If the children are females,
the day may come when they, too, will~ introduced as novices,
and ultimately take.the 'veil themselves.• In Popery every child
that is christened has its name registered, and if this ceremony
were omitted, the Nuns would consider themselves .too much
slighted to submit to it. Therefore, as it is the policy of Popery
to be all things unto all men, this punctilio must be complied
with. Be the reason what it may, we have no reason for di:s-
believina the fact as it is stated.
In order that' the public may see how completely the Romish
Priesthood can screen themselves from de~ection in any un-
lawful intercourse they may have with females, we will lay be-
fore the world the doctrine of the Romish chnrch on the snb-
ject of those who are possessed with the'·devil. Let any one
judge and decide upon the reason why such a doctrine was
invented. Their doctrine upon this subject is, that, The
devil has the power, and actually exercises the power,ofassum-
ing a human shape, and, under. the appearance of a man, of
seducing females. But, strange to tell ! in this case, the off-
spring of such connexion, is said· to belong not to the devil,
neither to the woman, but "sed illius cz~jus est semen." Lig·or.
'rheol. Prax. Conf. C. vii. N. 111. This is the most com-
modious dedrine that Popery, or rather the devil, (for none •
but i demon could have devised it,] could have framed, in or
der that the Priests might indul15e with impunity their lustfnl
appetites. Under the cover ot this " doctrine of devils,'' a
licentious Priest, in order to exculpate himself from the con
demnation of illicit connexion, has nothing more to do than
to lay it tl) the charge of the devil. It would be in vain for tho
woman to pretend to identify the Priest's person. He woulu
tell her it was the devil, who assumed his shape, and imitated
his voice; and he being a Holy Confessor, she would be
obliged to believe him. Nor does the abomination end here,
for the doctrine is SO well adapted to accommodate licentioUS·

nt>ss, that even if it is certain that,the Priest himself is the otld
who·is guilty of the action, still the blame may oo laid wholly
on the devil, and the Priest be 'excused from the guilt of sin in
what he. does. The following is what is said by the Saint on
the subject ; and is confirmed, as he says, by "Cardinal Pe·
trncci, and St. Thomas Aquin." "It is known that the qevil
can take possession of auy part of a man; ·for instance, his
eyes, his tongue, or even verenda. Hence it happens tha~ the
man utters words the most obscene, although h1s _
mind·may·
be far from thinking about what he says. ·. Hence it sometimes
happens, also, that the impulse is so .strong, that he iS 4!ren
urged on to strip himself naked ; a1;1d to oo other fi.l'thy things,
which I am ashamed to write about." [! ! !] " When the -devil
has thus suspended the use of reason, there is no more sin in
what the man does, than there would be if it was done by a
beast." [!! !] Ligor. Prax. Cont. vii. N. 111. '
This authority of Ligori no Papist dare deny, since his ·
doctrine is declared hy the church of Rome to he "sound, and
according to God, sana ac secundum Deum." Ligor. Theol.
Prref. And the man himself has lately been Canonized and en-
rolled among the Saints.*
.We believe the" AwFUL DxscLoSUREs" of Maria Monk to
be substc'l.ntially true.
