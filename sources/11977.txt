But the strange thing is that I was also in the bed, looking up at myself floating over the top of me. It was very strange; I was in two places as the same time observing myself from both vantage points. This lasted maybe a few minutes. There wasn't anything like a shock, or a sensation of being 'pulled' back. It abruptly ended.

There were no lights, tunnels, or anything like that. But there was a sense of calm. I wasn't scared, but I wasn't happy either. Hard to describe.
