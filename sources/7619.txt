  		              		Experience Description   

    On November 10, 2013, I had a major life-threatening heart attack.  Two days later,  I was flown from a local hospital to a larger hospital.  Within minutes after arrival, I recall flat lining.   I also remember a lot of noise and commotion.  I do not recall if my next memory was seconds or hours later.
  
  What I believe is my near death experience is as follows:

  I was in a room, everything including the furniture were a flat white color.  To the right there was closed door.  There were three of us in the room.  I vaguely recall being rolled into the room from the left side.
  
  I was seated in old wooden wheelchair with a high back.  I had several white pillows around me.  I was positioned on the left side of the room but not directly facing the the right side of the room, but rather I was looking to the right hand side of the room where the third person was seated.
  
  Behind this large desk was a  man who  was intimidating and very powerful.  On his right had was very large ring.  The ring had inscriptions which I do not remember, but for some reason the ring stood out as something very important.  This man and the desk were in the center of the room.  I do not recall anything on the desk.
  
  The third individual was seated in a chair on the right side of the room.  This person looked similar to my father.  When he spoke, it sounded like my  father’s voice.  I do not recall what he said, but   I do know that he and the man behind the desk were conversing.  
  
  I never spoke.  I recall looking back and forth at both of them.  Once they completed their discussion, the man behind the desk looked at me and said, 'You will be ok.' 
  
  I have no idea how much time passed.  The next thing I remember was coming to.  I was surrounded by  many machines that were keep me alive.  I began looking around for the man that had been behind the desk.  I recall looking at the right hands of all the male doctors to see if any of them were that man.
  
  I have never told anyone about this, not even my wife, best friends, family or preacher.  I knew the  experience was something important.  I always felt that this might have been a near death experience.  This past Sunday during the sermon, the scriptures were verses from the book of Esther.  During the story King Xerxes uses his Signet ring to seal a decree.  At that point, I realized the ring was a signet ring.
