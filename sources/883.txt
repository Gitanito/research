He was one of the most experienced field researchers in parapsychology and wrote over 100 articles and a half dozen books&nbsp;on apparitions, mediumship,&nbsp;reincarnation and other psychic phenomena.

In Iceland, there are no surnames. People are called by their first names, followed by a patronymic (a name formed from their father’s name). Even in that country's telephone directories, entries are listed by first name. Consequently, Erlendur preferred to be called Erlendur.

Erlendur’s father’s name was Haraldur, so he was known as Erlendur Haraldsson. Reference to him and his work in Europe and the United States follows convention, however, so&nbsp;in academic writing he is Haraldsson and in reference lists his works are listed as by Haraldsson, Erlendur. However, this is technically incorrect.  Life and Career  Early Life

Erlendur was born in Seltjarnarnes, near Reykjavik, Iceland, on 3 November 1931, to Haraldur Erlendsson, a labourer, and Anna Elimundardóttir, a housewife.1 In his childhood and early youth, he had several psychic experiences.2 He described one particularly transformative experience in an interview with Michael Tymn for White Crow Books:  

When I was around 15, I became like reborn to myself, and became aware of some inner reality that was also mysteriously external, and so immensely greater than anything I had experienced or been aware of before. It started suddenly in heavy rain during the middle of the day, near some banks of pebbles on the seashore that lit up as the sun suddenly shone and reflected on them. Then I had the experience of being filled with light that was immensely delightful and beyond words. After a while this faded away but a vivid trace of it remained with me and would sometimes – especially in my youth – sweep over me again. After that there was never a doubt that there existed a superior/supernatural reality that was sometimes closer and sometimes further away from my normal self.3   Academic Studies and Journalism

As a young man, Erlendur was interested in astronomy, but after contemplating the reaches of space he turned to philosophy and the problems of mind and existence.4 He studied philosophy at the University of Copenhagen, from which he graduated in 1954, and later at the universities of Edinburgh and Freiburg. In addition to the academic philosophers, he read unorthodox figures such as Martinus, Paul Brunton&nbsp;and PD Ouspensky, as well as theosophical writings and Evans-Wentz’s translations of Tibetan texts.&nbsp;At Freiburg he also attended the lectures of&nbsp;Hans Bender on parapsychology and was impressed by Bender’s empirical approach and the significant amount of research that had been done in the field.

After a year and a half at the University of Freiburg, Erlendur returned to work in Iceland, mostly as a journalist. Early in 1962 he went to the Freie Universität Berlin to continue his studies, switching to psychology. The Berlin Wall had just been built, and the city was a major locus of friction between the superpowers. His newspaper colleagues wanted first-hand news from Berlin and soon he found it more interesting to follow events there than to study. He gained access to the Berliner Pressekonferenz where he could listen to Willy Brandt, the mayor of West&nbsp;Berlin and later Germany’s chancellor. He also attended press conferences of famous directors and film stars at the Berlin Film Festival.

The Freie Universität required foreign students to attend a German language course. There Erlendur met students from Kurdistan, particularly those from the Iraqi and Iranian regions. (Kurds are minorities in four countries – Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.) He came to like the Kurds and developed a keen interest in their politics. At the time, a civil war was raging in Iraq between Kurds fighting for autonomy and the government in Baghdad. Erlendur became a freelance writer and travelled widely through the Middle East, amongst other things writing reports on the Iraqi Kurd rebels, particularly their struggle for autonomy in Iraq. There followed travels through Iran and&nbsp;Pakistan, then to India where he stayed for a year, writing his first book, on Kurdish political history.&nbsp;Erlendur returned to Germany in November&nbsp;1963&nbsp;to study psychology at the University of Freiburg, largely because Bender was there, and later transfered to the University of Munich.5  Entrance into Parapsychology

In 1961 Erlendur wrote to JB Rhine to purchase a pack of ESP cards,6 apparently his first direct contact with parapsychology. He elected to pursue parapsychology for his doctorate under Bender and in 1968&nbsp;attended the annual meeting of the professional Parapsychological Association in Freiburg, West Germany.7 In autumn 1969 he&nbsp; went to Durham, North Carolina, to work with Rhine at his Institute for Parapsychology&nbsp;at the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man, which he had founded when he retired from Duke University.&nbsp;During a&nbsp;year at Rhine's Institute, Erlendur&nbsp;conducted experiments on psychophysical (plethysmographic) responses in&nbsp;telepathy tests.&nbsp;He also did an experiment using a random number generator, obtaining significant results with&nbsp;selected subjects and with himself as subject.8

After leaving Rhine, Erlendur went to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville for another year's internship in clinical psychology with Robert van de Castle. While at the University of Virginia&nbsp;he came to know Ian Stevenson. From 1972 to early 1974&nbsp;he was a Research Associate at&nbsp;the American Society for Psychical Research&nbsp;(ASPR) in New York, working with&nbsp;Karlis Osis.9  University of Iceland

Erlendur received his PhD in 1972 with a thesis on 'Vasomotoric Indicators of ESP'.10&nbsp;He was appointed assistant professor of psychology in the Faculty of Social Science&nbsp;at the University of Iceland&nbsp;and began teaching there&nbsp;in 1974. He was promoted to associate professor in July&nbsp;1978&nbsp;and to full professor&nbsp;in April&nbsp;1989.&nbsp;He mainly taught courses in experimental psychology, psychological testing&nbsp;and methodology. Besides his teaching duties, he served as chairman of the Promotion Committee for the Faculty of Social Science and as a member of the University’s grant-giving Research Fund Commission. Erlendur spent a sabbatical year&nbsp;in 1982–83&nbsp;with Stevenson as guest professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Virginia. He was research professor at the Institut für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene in Freiburg, Germany, from 1993 to 1995.11 At&nbsp;the University of Iceland, Erlendur helped to standardize&nbsp;psychological testing instruments for use in his country.12  Retirement

Erlendur retired from his professorship at the University of Iceland in 1999 but remained active as a researcher, writer&nbsp;and lecturer. In 2007, he helped establish&nbsp;an endowment at the University of Iceland to support research into psychic experiences in the spirit of the research he had conducted throughout his career.13

Erlendur died on 22 November 2020, of cancer, at a hospice in Reykjavik. He had just passed his 89th birthday. He is survived by a son and a daughter.14  Website

Erlendur maintained a detailed website covering all aspects of his career. This has been removed from the University of Iceland server, but its contents have been transferred to&nbsp;a German site&nbsp;hosted by his friend Gesa Dröge.&nbsp;  Parapsychological Research  Experimental Studies

Erlendur is one of the few parapsychologists who have made significant contributions both to the experimental side of the field and to case studies. At the Institute for Parapsychology in 1969–70, he did&nbsp;studies of both ESP and psychokinesis.15 Later, he studied psi performance in relation to psychological testing&nbsp;instruments, especially the Defense Mechanism Test.16 He found results that suggested that religiosity and belief in postmortem survival might be better predictors of positive scoring in psi experiments than the belief in ESP.17 He was himself a good subject and appears to have been a psi-conducive experimenter.18  Psychic Experiences and Folk Beliefs

Erlendur wrote extensively about psychic experiences and beliefs in Iceland.19 In 1975, he conducted a large national survey of psychical and religious experiences and beliefs in Iceland. He found that 31% of his respondents reported encounters with someone who had died.20&nbsp;These findings were confirmed and extended&nbsp;by the multi-national European Values Survey, which revealed that one-fourth of the&nbsp;population believed they had had an encounter with someone who had died. Erlendur&nbsp;mined that survey for data on a variety of psychic experiences21 and compared its findings to his 1975 study.22 Separately, he reported on the survey responses to spiritual healing practices in Iceland.23

The reports of a considerable number of contacts with the dead promoted Erlendur to undertake another survey aimed at exploring after-death communications. This&nbsp;provided the basis of an analysis&nbsp;of the significance of violent death in apparition cases24 and his 2012 book, The Departed Among the Living, for which he followed up exceptional cases for additional information.&nbsp;  Deathbed Visions

When Erlendur was at the ASPR in 1972, Karlis Osis invited him to collaborate on a large-scale study of deathbed visions that patients had reported to doctors and nurses in India. Osis had already conducted such a study in the United States25 and wanted to see if his findings held up cross-culturally. This collaboration resulted in a book, At the Hour of Death, which has been translated into fourteen languages and is still in print in an English edition&nbsp;from White Crow Books. Erlendur describes the project and how it came about in&nbsp;his&nbsp;memoir, Towards the Unknown.  Sathya Sai Baba

While Erlendur and Karlis Osis were researching deathbed visions in Indian hospitals, they heard about&nbsp;the religious leader Sathya Sai Baba, who was reputed to produce miraculous phenomena. They visited him twice&nbsp;in South India. Although they could not persuade&nbsp;him to take part in experiments, they heard of many strange events associated with him and made some puzzling observations of their own.26&nbsp;Erlendur made a more extensive study of Sai Baba during later visits to India, leading to the book, Miracles are my Visiting Cards: An Investigative Report on Psychic Phenomena Associated with Sathya Sai Baba&nbsp;(Modern Miracles,&nbsp;in its American edition), in 1987. The book was issued in an updated edition&nbsp;by Hastings House in 1997 and reprinted by White Crow Books in 2013 as Modern Miracles: Sathya Sai Baba: The Story of a Modern Day Prophet.27

Philosopher of religion David Lane wrote that Erlendur's book&nbsp;'approaches the alleged miracles of Sai Baba with a critical, but open outlook' and recommended it as 'the most balanced book ever written' on Sai Baba's 'miracles'.28 Erlendur was interested in trying to distinguish genuine claims to macro-PK from legerdemain and wrote several papers on this topic, some with critic&nbsp;Richard Wiseman.29  Mediumship

Erlendur wrote about both mental and physical mediumship in Iceland. Along with Ian Stevenson, he studied two drop-in communicators through the medium  Hafsteinn Bjornssön.30 Together with Stevenson and others, he made several experiments with Bjornssön, checking to see if sitters could blindly identify the readings he did for them.31 With Loftur Gissuararson, Erlendur&nbsp;reviewed extensive historical and archival materials for his 2015&nbsp;book,&nbsp;Indridi Indridason: The Icelandic Physical Medium.  Reincarnation

Children’s past-life memories were the last topic&nbsp;to engage Erlendur’s attention, but one to which he made significant contributions. He became involved in this research in 1988, when Stevenson&nbsp;asked him to be part of a project to 'replicate' his findings by looking into new cases to see if they were comparable to those he had investigated.&nbsp;Erlendur chose to go to Sri Lanka and reported on the cases he studied there in a solo paper and in a joint paper with Antonia Mills and Jürgen Keil, who&nbsp;were involved in the replication project as well.32 Later, Erlendur&nbsp;studied cases among the Druze of Lebanon. He and Stevenson did a formal comparison of their Druze cases, studied independently some years apart, finding strong similarities between the two series.33

Erlendur examined&nbsp;the psychologies of children with past-life memories versus&nbsp;their peers without past-life memories&nbsp;in both Sri Lanka and Lebanon.34&nbsp;In both societies, children with past-life memories were judged to be better adjusted socially than their peers and did better&nbsp;in school, yet at the same time, those who recalled violent deaths often suffered from emotional problems similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp;In other important studies, Erlendur looked at the retention of past-life memories past late childhood, when many children stop talking about them. He discovered that 38% of Sri Lankan subjects and 86% of Lebanese subjects re-interviewed in adulthood claimed to remember at least some of the things they had spoken&nbsp;about in their early years.35

A list of Erlendur’s journal papers on reincarnation is available here. He devotes several chapters of Towards the Unknown to this resesarch, which he&nbsp;reviewed also in a book he wrote with researcher James Matlock, I Saw a Light and Came Here: Children’s Experiences of Reincarnation. Erlendur himself had what he suspected were past-life memories, but was never able to determine where they were set. However, the cases he studied convinced him that reincarnation does occur. He said, ‘Unbelievable as it may appear at first sight, the reincarnation theory best fits the data and the various features of the cases’.36  Honours and Awards

Erlendur received two major awards. He was honoured with an Outstanding Career Award by the professional Parapsychological Association in 1997,37 then in 2010&nbsp;he was awarded the Myers Memorial Medal by the Society for Psychical Research. Erlendur was the seventh recipient of the Myers Medal, which has been bestowed irregularly since 1995 'both to honour the memory of SPR founder Frederic Myers (1843–1901) and to acknowledge significant contributions by current researchers'.38  Works  Books

Of Erlendur's eight books, seven describe some aspect of the paranormal or psychical research; five have appeared in English. A memoir of his experiences and activities in parapsychology&nbsp;will be published&nbsp;in Spring&nbsp;2021.
