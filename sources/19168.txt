I mean certainly in it states a
consciousness and I put in here this
applies to all sentient beings all
sentient beings awake beans in the
cosmos not just human not just et but
also in these other dimensions so-called
afterlife what have you so you have all
of you know about waking you&#39;re awake
now hopefully you&#39;re still awake if not
I&#39;ll find a Zen master come around with
the stick and go clunk no I&#39;m just
kidding
we won&#39;t do it or none then the nuns do
that and so you have waking you&#39;re all
awake now sleeping you all go to bed and
go to sleep dreaming we&#39;ve spoken about
lucid dreams and lucid precognition
we&#39;ve spoken about now the lucid
precognition is important to understand
all that is is the ability to be awake
in a dream and see something&#39;s going to
happen in the future whether it&#39;s
tomorrow or a week or a year from now I
met my wife in a lucid precognitive
dream I was in Israel in 1978 and I had
these five dreams in a row very strange
where this enlightened being came to me
and introduced me to this woman that I&#39;d
never met said this is who we wish for
you to marry and I it&#39;s like an arranged
marriage but it was like from the other
side I went well fine I wasn&#39;t I&#39;m 22 I
could no more be interested and be a
mirror than the man the moon but I said
okay so I told her Franny I need to look
for who this person is and so I did I
act on these things which is something
that most people don&#39;t and about a month
or two later the person who&#39;s now my
wife Emily was came to Israel for a
conference she was in the Peace Corps in
the Caribbean and doing the kind of
physical therapy occupational therapy
setting up rehab places where there were
none cuz they were just throwing people
into like horrible settings with no
rehab
and she was there for a conference I saw
her because you don&#39;t go up to a
stranger and say hi I had a dream with
you let&#39;s get married right I mean it&#39;s
like what well you might but it&#39;s like a
little wacked out so I go alright so we
met we had this amazing immediate bond
but I didn&#39;t even I didn&#39;t even tell her
my last name I said a prayer and I said
if this is really who you wish for me to
marry she has to contact me before I
will ever contact her again so she did
she went back take care of being wrote
to where I was working in Israel it just
with my first name from North Carolina
because I was talking about the
mountains of North Carolina and how
beautiful and and it got to me so with
that I said okay now remember there are
our no cell phones making a phone call
was very expensive in 78 internationally
so we we wrote air mayor letters and
then sent little audio tapes back and
forth and so we had about a year
courtship that way met in Alaska for a
10-day courtship together and then
decided to be married and that was 39 40
years ago so that&#39;s that but that&#39;s how
I met her and it&#39;s a true story is very
strange maybe but it&#39;s not that strange
and and so that lucid precognitive dream
stay can be highly instructive and in
some cultures like the aboriginals in
australia dream time is a huge part of
their culture this lucid dreaming I&#39;m
part Cherokee Indian my grandmother was
Cherokee I&#39;m a quarter it&#39;s very it was
very big in the Cherokee tradition that
we have these lucid dreams and learning
in the dream state and seeing into the
future cetera and so on so that&#39;s
something that&#39;s folded within all of us
all of us can practice practice lucid
dreaming and then there&#39;s in meditation
and various meditation techniques you
can access that unbounded pure
consciousness min called Samadhi
so that transcendent state of
consciousness is simply your being aware
of awareness without being having your
attention divided into
perceptions that are discrete individual
perceptions is it&#39;s the experience of
just a pure state of quiet consciousness
in and of itself it&#39;s very attainable by
everyone everyone makes it more
difficult
I teach different meditation techniques
and people can experience that it&#39;s very
easy actually so all of you know about
meditation and the Samadhi state now
this is where it gets interesting and
this is just more from a Vedic
perspective you could divide this
understanding up in many different
traditional ways
there&#39;s cosmic consciousness that is the
experience of that unbounded infinite
mind even while you&#39;re up walking around
doing daily activities dreaming sleeping
waking so in other words you&#39;re tied
into and and intimately aware and
experiencing directly that unbounded
aspect of consciousness seamlessly even
while you&#39;re doing things you&#39;re not
just sitting quietly in meditation
experiencing that Samadhi state that&#39;s
cosmic consciousness so that&#39;s the first
of the higher states of consciousness
that begins to evolve if you become a
regular meditator and experiencing this
on a regular basis which is why you
should be meditating two three times a
day and occasionally go on a meditation
retreat that&#39;s an intensive we just got
off of one of them Mount Shasta now as
that begins to develop and by the way
again this is linear but it&#39;s actually
more organic they unfold together and
aspects of one state begin to blip in
and get experience as you have others
the next one has been called God
consciousness mainly because of God such
a loaded word you begin to have
experiences of the direct perception of
these other dimensions celestial realm
and eventually that most great light
creator being but all the time so you
can look at a plant and see its astral
aura you can see spirit beings as they
move in you&#39;re in touch with the
celestial realm you can see that most
great light and you have this intimate
experience of what people have called
the expressed
aspect of the Godhead of the unbounded
being as that state does that make sense
then and that is the the place where all
the various powers and cities are fully
established si DDH is is the vedic term
but in other tradition it just becomes
divine powers or you know such as
levitation materialization
dematerialization we&#39;ll get into these
in a moment then as you get established
in this state in a permanent way you
have this experience of unity
consciousness where you have a direct
perception of the unbounded infinite
inner quiet self being present even
within and present in all places and
things so all here is the saying that
goes all this is that this mean a
capital T where you everything you you
see the perfect unity that everything is
in fact conscious and consciousness and
that great being expressing phasing
resonating as that tree or this table or
this person and so you you&#39;re in a
perfect state of unity and that is at
that point the perfect state of
equanimity and also great compassion the
compassion of the Buddha because you are
all beings you are all things and you&#39;re
experiencing it directly it&#39;s not an
intellectual ization or an ethical
teaching only it&#39;s a direct experience
unity consciousness and then one that&#39;s
been described and this is my own
definition of it from my own experience
is Blauman consciousness which is your
experiencing that but at will can
experience the entirety of the
manifested cosmos the galaxies all of
those were part of your are accessed and
you can you have a certain universality
of this unity consciousness so that far
galaxies other dimensions you&#39;re
actually experiencing those at will does
that make sense
so these are just now this is just the
beginning there are actually many higher
states above this but they&#39;ve not been
articulated in any literature and to my
knowledge humans haven&#39;t experienced
them because we can only experience so
far but this is in the mystic literature
it says all of this is but one chamber
of the heart of which there are four and
the rest would be recounted could a
kindred soul be found in other words a
soul capable of comprehending it so but
this is enough for us to deal with this
afternoon all right
next slide so dry up on my chest my lips
got chapped so then now this is where it
gets fun so just do this I need to stick
back so I can see you guys okay with the
webinar and this is beautiful because
all of you have heard of this you&#39;ve
heard of enlightened beings who have
been able to teleport or materialize an
object or levitate even in the early
Christian era before it got stamped out
the very enlightened of practitioners a
prayer and meditation were found
floating up at the top of cathedrals
levitating physically levitating well
documented but of course that&#39;s not
supposed to be possible but it is
possible why is it possible the gap
consciousness causality astral physical
they&#39;re all in folded and if you know
how to operate at a deep level of
consciousness you can create an impulse
an intention where you levitate or may
happen spontaneously just as when you&#39;re
in a state of bliss I&#39;ve had a couple
experiences of the levitation I wasn&#39;t
trying to I was on an advanced training
core teacher training I was a teacher of
meditation before I was a doctor and my
misspent youth instead of chasing skirts
and dropping acid I was spending eight
hours a day in meditation at retreats
after this near-death experience I had I
went man I want to figure out what this
is about
you know so I can care about college
that I went to college was again
and I began to practice this meditation
very deeply and one time I was walking
in the there was an early spring up in
upstate in New York Livingston Manor and
it was on this course where I was
meditating eight nine hours a day and it
was so beautiful and I&#39;m so connected to
earth and nature that I was in this
state of such joy I just spontaneously
lifted up not quite this high about this
high and floated from like here to the
wall over there maybe you know 30 50
feet just floated and then my intellect
and ego kicked in and I went you have to
be in a state of flow consciousness for
this time but it&#39;s happen it happens a
lot of people experience levitation so
that&#39;s one of them the top one remote
viewing a lot of studies we have a
gentleman here today Lance munguia who&#39;s
coming out with a film called the third
eye spies it&#39;s all about the CIA
DARPA Stanford Research Institute
International Institute and others back
in the days you know experimenting and
doing work for the intelligence
community on using consciousness to see
remote places called remote viewing and
that&#39;s just a modern pop culture term
for being a sere se er you know someone
who can see beyond the limits of linear
space-time without the help of FaceTime
or something like that you know where
they can do it through consciousness but
why is that possible the only reason
you&#39;re able to remote view or have a
precognitive view of the future is
because the consciousness the true
nature of the consciousness that allows
you to be awake at this instant this
moment right now is on the present on
the present in space and time which
means you can see any point in space and
you can see any point in time going back
as far as you want now going forward you
can only talk of probable futures
because it&#39;s all probable probabilities
to based on what people do anyone who
says it&#39;s fixed on a timeline doesn&#39;t
understand how the cosmos is organized
so that&#39;s why you know the soothsayers
who say on October 30th this is going to
happen they&#39;re always wrong
I&#39;ll tell you
either wrong because by time they say it
they&#39;ve changed enough variables by
people hearing it that it&#39;s altered the
outcome okay mm-hm
right you get it all right let&#39;s grow up
childhoods in now now all of these have
a corollary technologically so view this
as the innate capabilities and slash
human and ET capabilities that are
scientifically done through electronic
systems and very advanced physics so
just like we have remote viewing that
can be done through exploring
consciousness and meditation you can
have technology assisted consciousness
these are systems that can help you hook
up to that enable and facilitate remote
viewing of different points in space or
time and these were have been developed
by all interstellar civilizations and
classified projects have quite a few of
these that they&#39;ve developed a beginning
in 1956 I&#39;m the man who had invented the
systems that got taken over by the CIA
was a member of my team who&#39;s very
elderly and he had developed the
electronic so you could hook up to a
headset and remove you anywhere and I
was in 56 highly classified but he
offered that system to me I said oh I
would like to live a few more days but I
mean I&#39;m fearless but not stupid
there&#39;s a difference that would have
been stupid so and then you have these
systems that help with remote viewing
technologically so visualized
civilizations and classified projects
that have electronic systems that
facilitate the natural experience of
scientific remote viewing or
precognition and what-have-you
so those are fully operational one of my
military advisors have been read into as
military speak for to a project and
in the early 70s at White Oaks Naval
facility in Maryland&#39;s now-closed where
they had a device an electronic system
that could target any point any place on
the earth and extract from what the
Mystics would call the Akashic record
anything that had ever been said or
happened in that volume of space so they
could target this volume of space they
could extract what is going on now what
happened last night what happened 10
years ago what happened a thousand years
ago what happened a billion years ago in
this area of space time fully
operational and had been around for a
while as of the early to mid 70s so
those systems exist now imagine if
that&#39;s what we haven&#39;t classified highly
compartmented unacknowledged special
access projects begin to think about
what an interstellar civilization has or
it&#39;s just many orders of magnitude
beyond that understand see where I&#39;m
heading this is kind of make sense in a
moment so then you have the precognition
we talked about lucid dreams well
there&#39;s an aspect of this called new
technology assisted consciousness that
lets you see in the future we mentioned
this but there was an operation looking
glass and red light that&#39;s classified
projects that we have witnesses for in
my project who were military and
aerospace and technology guys where they
had worked on this trying to figure out
those systems for the intelligence
community and military and you know I
have almost a thousand of these sort of
deep inside or whistleblowers now who
work with me who want the public to know
one I&#39;m telling you by the way as I
mentioned levitation beautiful you can
do it innately yeah it there are
techniques that you can learn for
levitating is not important it&#39;s more
important that you learn how to be in a
state of pure consciousness because if
you develop that the central operating
system is unbounded mind if you develop
that these other things will unfold
within you spontaneously as you need
them so don&#39;t waste time trying to learn
a city in and of itself if anything it&#39;s
a distraction it&#39;s better if it unfolds
naturally
in my opinion there&#39;s a bit of wisdom
now that the correlation is
electromagnetic gravid extolled
anti-gravity now this is something that
was studied back in the 20s you know T
Townsend Brown was doing work with
crystalline structures and certain
frequencies where they would begin to
levitate that was 28-29 imagine what we
had by the 40s and then extrapolate into
an interstellar civilization that have
technologies that are way beyond that
but in the US intelligence military
aerospace community what&#39;s called
gravity control the ability to control
gravity which is actually controlling
mass we&#39;ll get into this in a minute
that was established in October of 1954
so from 1954 forward we have not needed
Jets Rockets
surface roads etc and so on that is a
fact
but this highly classified and for some
good reasons because any of those
systems could be weaponized into a
missile delivery system so you could get
from here to Tehran in a couple seconds
maybe a minute or two a lot faster than
an ICBM or rocket okay remember Rockets
are 40s
Verner von braun jets were being
developed in the 30s 40s internal
combustion engines the car you drove up
here in 1880s 1888 mercedes your Tesla
those who you think you&#39;re being so cool
it&#39;s an electric motor which has been
around since the late 1800s plugged into
a coal-fired power grid or nuclear or
gas is it&#39;s not a Tesla to musk there&#39;s
a difference between a musk and a Tesla
a Tesla would be pulling energy out of
the fabric of space/time okay sorry
Elon well I mean it&#39;s true I&#39;m as well
and we don&#39;t have our civilizations
running out of time to do the little doe
see those of pretend breakthroughs we
need to have some big breakthroughs fast
trust me you know believe me we need
we&#39;re running out all right let&#39;s do it
yeah so so those and there are
consciousness assisted technologies that
interface and permit this sort of
levitation effect so that you can be
wired into a craft and your
consciousness is helping guide it but
also is affecting its movement then you
have whatever thing called teleportation
now you&#39;ve heard of people who have
appeared to sort of vanish in one place
and reappear another like some of the
great masters that something humans can
do and it&#39;s a teleportation experience
this can also be done electronically and
through physics and transdimensional
physics where you can then teleport a
craft and the beans within it across the
vast distances of space I have one of
our witnesses who&#39;s in the disclosure
project material for red thread fel who
was up at an Air Force Base in 1953 in
Canada and they were experimenting with
the electronics of this where they were
it was very prosaic it was an ashtray
and they would create a resonant field
around it here and then they had a place
for it to go to at another part in the
base and it would go back and forth D
materializing teleporting boom boom boom
back and forth that was 53 alright so
that was 65 years ago though that&#39;s
human classified research and
development
now extrapolate hundreds of thousands to
millions of years into the future what
interstellar civilizations have very it
developed next then you have this is a
continuation of this this is by no means
exhaustive the list that goes on and on
and on we be here all day
but this dematerialization re
materialization now you say well that&#39;s
the same as teleportation it isn&#39;t it is
and it isn&#39;t but it&#39;s a stationary can
be a stationary experience where you can
in any volume of space by accessing that
cosmology on the first slide
set up a resonant field where something
can be materialized in that volume of
space and you&#39;ve heard of various adepts
in India and elsewhere who can
materialize a gym or materialize a ring
or materialize a stone or a ruby well
that can be done by understanding how
consciousness is omnipresent but within
the field of consciousness within each
of us are all these other finer levels
that can then be accessed so you could
bring something into 3d not by pulling
it from somewhere else with by
manifesting it from the elementals let&#39;s
call the subatomic subatomic subatomic
at that interface in the gap and then
cause that thing to go pop right there
got it that&#39;s what material is a so
that&#39;s been done innately by humans now
it&#39;s also can be done through
technological systems so you could have
an interstellar spacecraft hovering
outside this window you wouldn&#39;t see it
it&#39;s D materialized and it could be in a
very fine level of that cosmological
structure that was outlined prior and if
it wanted to it could go blip fully
materialized in a nanosecond and then D
materialized in another nanosecond we
have actually had that happen if it
melts Shasta crap would appear disappear
right in front of us huge interstellar
craft cool stuff you&#39;ll see some
pictures later so that&#39;s something that
can be done through transdimensional
interstellar physics and also to an
extent has been experimented with and
classified projects they&#39;re hitting some
problems the limits of what they&#39;ve been
able to do with our 21 trillion dollars
in covert black money so manifestations
of objects I&#39;ve mentioned
materialization D material an object can
go and be here and just go through a
resonant shift and that can cause this
to disappear it&#39;s still there but where
is there it&#39;s in those finer near astral
resonant fields in the guy
in the interface between 3d and other
dimensions that make sense but it can be
done electronically it&#39;s all electronics
really advanced like electronics I&#39;m not
you know not you&#39;re not this no offense
Steve Jobs well he knows this now on the
other side so it&#39;s true hey Mark
Zuckerberg heads up here&#39;s where we&#39;re
headed
so the manifestation of objects is
something that as I mentioned mystics
can do but ET craft can do that and this
is where you get into extraterrestrial
manufacturing systems what we call okay
back up you came up here and a Ford or a
Tesla doesn&#39;t matter the metal was dug
up out of the earth smelted turned into
steel aluminum alloys bolted and riveted
and welded together bah blah blah blah
blah it&#39;s linear manufacturing now let&#39;s
talk about nonlocality manufacturing
where by setting up a standing wave in
the near astral interface this gap
between 3d and these other dimensions
you set up like a blueprint architect
and but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a resonant blueprint
resonance blueprint that can cause an
object then should come into 3d and
it&#39;ll be perfect it&#39;s seamless it&#39;s made
of the purest materials you know this is
why when we&#39;ve studied the remains of ET
craft that we have been downing with
advanced scalar longitudinal weapons the
the composites and the materials or
things that we can&#39;t even create from
Earth raw materials in the vacuum of
space I mean they&#39;re just unbelievably
pure and that&#39;s why the light and the
energy from these craft are so
extraordinary because it&#39;s not something
they&#39;re they&#39;re ships or materialized
let&#39;s call it or man manufactured from
that deeper level of assembly it&#39;s not
being assembled from digging stuff out
of the ground and smelting it it&#39;s being
assembled from that resonant field that
and then is brought into 3d
is incredibly pure and by the way the
reason the way you can tell a difference
between a classified anti-gravity
aircraft it looks like a UFO and an
interstellar is the man with made ones
have seams their rivets and parts and
this and that the interstellar no none
you&#39;ve heard of you know enlightened
masters and adepts who&#39;ve been able to
by locate and the same person would be
in the same place at two different
places at the same time and of course
there&#39;s this phenomenon of the spooky
effect that Einstein described of
particles the same particle being in two
places at once and four resonantly
affecting two two places at the same
time which violated all of his
understanding of physics because his
understanding physics did not go
transdimensional it&#39;s a big problem in
physics for actually so this ability
that humans have innately can also be
done through transdimensional
interstellar physics and there was some
person who had been on my Executive
Committee for a while named Burrell
lives he was an actor singer and really
great guy interesting 33 to get REME
Aysen but had no access to this
information through them so he and his
wife were very interested in this was
they I taught them the Close Encounters
of the fifth kind protocols and Dorothy
eyes was practicing them with her her
granddaughter in Anacortes Washington
where they were living at the time and
she would had amazing contact happen you
know craft that appeared on the clouds
and moved from here to there one night
morning early morning she came down from
upstairs of her bedroom I&#39;d been in this
house many times and to her foyer and
there was an ET craft materialized
outside the courtyard and kind of bluish
with this beam of light and energy
coming into the foyer and they were
saying do not be afraid we are always
with you you will be protected
she&#39;s a haha stranger but she felt
intuitively was told to pick up her
phone and call her best friend in LA who
was in the middle of the Northridge
earthquake and her friend said there is
this crap described identically an urban
copy of the craft that was over the the
upper lives house in LA where it was
over outside her house a beam coming in
and in her mind telepathically was
receiving the same message do not be
afraid we are always with you you will
be protected but she was in the middle
of the earthquake and they know how bad
it was gonna get now that&#39;s a very
strange story but it&#39;s actually very
common if you understand
transdimensional interstellar physics
and and Dorothy asked me Dorothy Ives
asked me do you think that was the same
craft in two places I said yes it was
because they can try locate try locate
Quadra locate etc and so on but that is
another capability because there is a
ability linear space-time is really an
illusion because the entirety of this
multiverse and all these dimensions are
folded within it and once you master
that that explains all these things that
have been called cities sidd HR the
Vedic powers and abilities and then of
course you can do remote healing events
you&#39;ve heard of this we talked about
intercession Airy Prayer and things of
this sort and it&#39;s very beautiful and
this translates into extraordinary
transdimensional interstellar medical
technologies that involve consciousness
assisted technology technology that is
assisting the mind and the astral subtle
body non-local resonant field medicine
etc and so on the future of medicine
will move away from chemicals and
surgical into things that look like Star
Trek tricorder sort of stuff but that
will be working on that level
transdimensional II and the ETS have
those systems already fully operational
some classified projects have versions
of it none of which can be disclosed
without also tipping the hand to the
energy the physics behind the energy
which would terminate ExxonMobil
the petrodollar the gang banksters your
utility company your road system
builders Boeing jet engines Rockets
internal combustion engines coal gas all
of it it&#39;s a thousand trillion dollars
in assets would vanish if any of that
were disclosed therefore they&#39;ve decided
to keep it secret meanwhile we die of
cancer and other diseases unnecessarily
but the point I&#39;m making is in the
future these will be in full application
and they were already pretty heavily
developed in classified projects
interstellar civilizations have a very
high level of this development so we&#39;ve
had experiences with our ce-5 teams last
year in Arizona up on a mountain and
we&#39;ll get to this at a moment there was
a man we were doing our circle and we
were doing the meditation the remote
viewing doing the protocols to contact
the ETS through the ce-5 protocols and
we saw this red orange thing about this
big that that flipped in a kind of oval
teardrop shaped and it just gonna poop
poop in a fraction of a second someone
had the lens with her camera open and in
the picture is his fairly large et with
a triangular head with some kind of
device he was holding in a tunic and the
man that was right beside the ET had
this amazing contact experience with him
that continued throughout the evening
and night till the wee hours of the
morning and he had had a permanent
hearing loss of hearing aids and that
next day he came to the meetings and he
was totally healed he had no hearing
loss and to this day he doesn&#39;t so that
was a interstellar et hearing of this
man he was very pure hearted and he
stayed with it and his hearing loss was
gone he didn&#39;t he just bit their way as
hearing aids that happened a year ago in
May beautiful what you see the picture
we have a photograph of this et in our
circle you&#39;ll see it in a moment so next
is this fun yeah all right now
this is where it gets really interesting
Miche kaku many of you have heard the
name has talked about us getting from a
level zero civilization to a level one a
Peter Thiel&#39;s talked about us going from
zero to one technologically because we
really are stuck that there&#39;s innovation
around the edges but there&#39;s been no big
breakthroughs well I Got News for mr.
Thelen for Michio Kaku we have the big
breakthroughs big huge breakthroughs
they are classified and they are
classified because the internet
smartphones YouTube Netflix Amazon those
are really not disruptive this stuff
would really transform our civilization
and so the stakeholders the multi
hundred trillion dollar stakeholders
would have to find something else to do
besides being petrol Nazis and gang
banksters but that&#39;s another issue but
when we go through this our civilization
is the bad news we&#39;re level zero our
entire world the globe the earth on
human civilization we&#39;re at level zero
the good news is we&#39;re going to make it
all the way to at least seven or eight
you&#39;ll see this in a moment in the next
few hundred thousand years which will
describe now this this is the current
human predicament
we&#39;re dis unit we have disunity war
primitive environmental to destroying
technologies and we&#39;re at this point of
extinction level events so a level zero
civilization would be the current
conundrum that we&#39;re in now and that is
we have advanced enough technologically
to have cars jets nuclear weapons but
spiritually and socially we have not
advanced to where we could have those
technologies and behave in a way that
wouldn&#39;t destroy the planet the there is
sort of an existential realization at a
crisis that the root of
this is the lack of recognition of the
central oneness we have not only with
each other but with the cosmos in a lot
of ways the problem is a spiritual
problem not religious but the solution
is spiritual also deeply spiritual I
have a theorem that spirituality is
usually inversely proportional to
religiosity so the trappings of the
catechisms of religion you often bring
people further away from to spirituality
because it becomes a matter of control
and demagoguery which is what men do but
if we were to look at true spiritual
development in the pursuit of higher
states of consciousness that I went
through a moment ago those higher states
of consciousness are all attainable by
every one of us but the first level of
consciousness we have to attain to live
on this planet to get to a level one
globally peaceful civilization is to
understand there is only as immense
roediger said in 1908 who is one of the
fathers of quantum mechanics but it was
a particle wave there he said the total
number of minds in the universe is one
that is it&#39;s a singularity consciousness
is a singularity and therefore it all of
us are one great being moving around in
different individual expressions of
ourselves of that great beam and that
once we realize there is this deep and
effable experiential level of oneness
we&#39;re not going to want to engage in
warfare because my god is better than
your God I&#39;m Catholic and you&#39;re a
Protestant we&#39;ll blow each other up in
Ireland I&#39;m Sonny your Shi we&#39;re gonna
blow each other up in Iraq I&#39;m this
you&#39;re that that hold the viscid nasai s
the thrust of the classified projects
and almost all of the UFO subculture is
to show the alien UFO phenomenon as the
good guys and the bad guys and the
Cowboys and the Indians
and they&#39;re the grays and the reptilians
versus the ones that are Nordic and of
course always look like a beautiful
woman from Sweden let&#39;s call it out
it&#39;s interstellar racism instead of a
planetary racism is racism in a
different guise it&#39;s just flat-out
racist so to get to here we have to
transcend isms we live in a time of all
the isms capitalism versus communism
racism homophobia all the religiosity
and ethnic divisions all of that is a
symptom of something more central and
this is a lack of the spiritual of
realization of the ineffable oneness of
all intelligent life and that isn&#39;t just
human but interstellar as well that is
the foundation of universal peace now to
get to this which is not just peaceful
on this earth it&#39;s no good to have world
peace if it&#39;s based on an interplanetary
war that&#39;s not going forward my friends
it just isn&#39;t going forward to have
interplanetary war be the thing that
unites us is Ronald Reagan said at the
United Nations
oh what an hour job of creating world
unity be easier if we had a common alien
threat to unite against no no no we
don&#39;t have to unite the world around
another fight however that would greatly
enrich the military-industrial
laboratory finance complex which is
what&#39;s running the planet into the
ground all right so we&#39;re going to
ground hard and we&#39;re facing an
extinction level event particularly if
we go there
my main focus for the last 20 years at
the Pentagon and CIA is to pull those
folks away from things that I haven&#39;t
ever talked about that are fully
operational that are trying to be a jean
provocateur to provoke an interplanetary
war that is actively going on it&#39;s very
dangerous is the main thing I talked
about with Putin a boutros-ghali the UN
Secretary General in the 90s but this
could lead to an extinction-level event
to several things one thermonuclear
weapons obviously mutual assured
destruction as it&#39;s called to biosphere
collapse because we&#39;ve stayed with
fossil fuels and nuclear and those
systems for a hundred years longer than
we should have we should have had Tesla
type real Tesla type systems a hundred
years ago and could have we should have
had no surface roads by the mid 50s
forget the Eisenhower interstate system
didn&#39;t need it we should have had a
globally prosperous peaceful
civilization by the League of Nations
that got subverted after World War one
and then we head to world war ii and the
militarists want to have World War three
and as Douglas MacArthur said will be
interplanetary that&#39;s what they want
they want global destruction in war
these are sick puppies who are running
these operations I&#39;m metal I know a lot
of them okay so that I&#39;ve met too many
of them I&#39;ve been in skiffs underground
I&#39;ve had dinner they either hate me or
they love it
I don&#39;t mind being hated by people like
that so anyway so this this level of
zero civilization is where we are the
foundation the root of that dysfunction
is the lack of the understanding of the
oneness that we that of all life not
just on earth but in space in the
heavens so that is a deep consciousness
this is the deep ethics behind the
science of consciousness that can
transfer into sociology and psychology
and politics it needs to happen and it&#39;s
going to have to happen through sort of
a field effect that we call the 1%
effect we&#39;ll get to in a moment so once
there is a certain
consensus in consciousness to live
together peacefully and to do so from a
deep level of the experience of the
transcendent aspect non-local aspect of
consciousness a really deep level of
spirituality it&#39;s it&#39;s more than a
religious catechism it&#39;s the experience
of that ineffable oneness that that
Edgar Mitchell experienced when he was
on the moon and looked back and saw the
earth and did go away with his thumb
that level of cosmic awareness not
necessarily fully established in cosmic
awareness but the experience of that
oneness in pure consciousness and
meditative States and understanding of
it you need 1% so we need 75 million
people it&#39;s seven and a half billion on
the planet do the math we need 75
million people actively in that state
and not only just thinking about it
it&#39;ll actually been experiencing it and
acting that way then we get here now how
does that happen with 1% you know
they&#39;ve done studies with meditators or
they&#39;ll send them into a city and
there&#39;ll be a group of people meditating
if they have 1% say a city has a quarter
of a million people so 1% of that would
be 2500 so if you send 2,500 people in
there who are in meditation together and
stay there for some time the crime rates
go down there is more coherence in
society this has been documented but
it&#39;s interesting because in non human
nonsense theological studies guess what
they found the same thing it&#39;s called
field coherence quantum mechanics so in
take for example the super fluidity and
helium you take a container of helium
cool it down to absolute zero which is
minus 260 or 70 degrees something like
that and as you begin to do that the
heat the helium atoms begin to become
aligned coherently when one percent one
percent
become coherent there&#39;s what&#39;s called a
phase transition and the entire
container of helium becomes superfluid
and it can go up and around and through
its total coherence it takes one percent
not 99 not fifty one it&#39;s not voting
it&#39;s a one percent of genuine coherence
so one percent of us can become coherent
in deeper consciousness it would move
the entire planet to a level one right
here see what I&#39;m saying this is a
message of good hope one percents
attainable one out of a hundred souls on
this planet very doable and now here&#39;s a
cautionary footnote as you approach the
phase transition the chaos within the
the media within the sub that within the
container becomes more and more chaotic
it looks chaotic it starts roiling and
boiling and being crazy pretty much
describes our society now right but when
it hits that 1% and it&#39;s a stable 1% not
transitory
then the whole thing goes to the space
transition is completely calm and
magical that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed we are
very close to that phase transition but
to make it through in the best way
possible for our children and our
children&#39;s children our children&#39;s
children&#39;s children and frankly the
20,000 generations of souls waiting to
come here for this next Yuga this era
that we&#39;re entering we got to get this
right we need that 1% in a state
established fashion at that point you
have a global peaceful civilization and
when you have that all things are
possible why because the technology
here&#39;s a message of great hope for
everyone of any age particularly younger
people who feel so like the world is
going to hell in a handbasket there&#39;s
nothing they can do about it there&#39;s
everything we can do about it because we
can come together in unity we can enter
into this coherent state in meditation
and action
and when the world can make this
transition to a level one all these
technologies that have been in
classified
projects for 60 years can be used
because they will only be used for
peaceful purposes they will not be used
as a weapon now remember all
technologies are double-edged swords and
is based on the consciousness of those
who wield it I can take a knife and put
butter on the bread or I can take it and
slit your throat the knife doesn&#39;t care
the knife doesn&#39;t care
it&#39;s the consciousness of those who
wield it so we need to have the
enlightened and the good people of Earth
which is most people understand this and
make this happen so that these
technological breakthroughs that have
been extant for decades in classified
projects can be put into peaceful
utilization which would allow the earth
to heal it would eliminate poverty in
one generation it would eliminate all
pollution immediately with these
technologies no effluent manufacturing
would be transformed to zero pollution
transportation utilities energy
generation all of it has zero pollution
you wouldn&#39;t need surface roads forget
the 101 being clogged up with an
accident or the 405 or 95 or wherever
you live or outside Paris on the Beltway
all of that is an artificial state
because the state of coherence and peace
has been for stalled we&#39;re all
responsible for that and the
aggressiveness of sociopaths in the
corporate military intelligence
governmental worlds that have taken it
upon themselves to keep the fires of
conflict and war burning longer than
they should have ever been allowed now
these interstellar civilizations
understand this they&#39;re watching they&#39;re
waiting patiently but there&#39;s a limit to
how far we can go before we blow the
system and have an extinction-level
event which would be a biosphere
collapse a massive war with these
weapons or worse the the fools that have
these technologies who are weaponizing
them and putting them on satellites
targeting ET craft provokes something
that we could not recover from
so I think that this is why disclosure
is important the ce-5 initiative of
making contact peacefully with these
civilizations is important and your own
meditation practice and and pursuit of
enlightenment is so important to the
future of humanity it&#39;s critical this is
not a philosophical angels on the head
that the tip of a pen sort of thing
this is essential and we are in a global
emergency that needs an emergency
intervention and as i always joke i&#39;m an
emergency doctor i know an emergency
when i see one
so guess what we&#39;re in one but it&#39;s like
the frog being boiled in the canoe is
there the heats going off slowly slowly
slowly and the Frog doesn&#39;t know until
it&#39;s cooked it&#39;s cooked so we&#39;re about
to get cooked the biosphere is cooking
the waterways are dying the land is
pollution polluted there&#39;s a
balkanization
of left and right and fat source and
neo-fascists and when Charlotte sphere
where I live we had the fascist run over
that lady last August all of that that&#39;s
not sustainable that&#39;s not a sustainable
paradigm we have to have a sustainable
paradigm based in consciousness and
peace and higher states of consciousness
and it isn&#39;t going to be everyone on
earth but we need the 1% the phase
transition oh there you go so that&#39;s
where we have to do once we have this
then medical technologies that are based
on transdimensional physics can be used
would be used and developed quickly
you&#39;re everything you&#39;re using for
energy would be from zero-point energy
which is the ability to tap into that
deep level of the baseline energy field
of the cosmos and it&#39;s estimated that
every look the volume inside a coffee
cup has enough energy in it to boil off
the Earth&#39;s oceans it&#39;s a huge amount of
energy and of course tests are called
the infinite energy field a professor
direc called it the direct sea modestly
after himself and but whatever it&#39;s
there it&#39;s been proven to be there
technologies have been developed based
on it if anyone has one hand it off to
us we&#39;ll get it out in the next six
months
in six days actually but that&#39;s what we
need to have and then all the other ones
can come in electromagnetic wave it
occipital civilization not using it for
a missile launch system then instead of
having a Airbus 380 or 747 to go to
Europe or Australia you go up a few
minutes later you land wonderful those
are fully developed and operational and
classified projects we have them we&#39;re
not using them and in order to use them
fully we&#39;re going to have to function
like a level one civilization the
hallmark of which is we are in a
permanent not transitory permanent state
of global peace but inter global as well
interplanetary your world peace would
have been great around 1900 1920 but in
this time we&#39;re already in a in an
interstellar period and so it has to be
universal peace
so as why the motto is universal our
objective is universal peace not world
peace it&#39;s too late for just world peace
I mean people need to kind of catch up
with where the trend like meal things
are moving forward whether people want
it to or not and it is so once we reach
this state of global and universal peace
and we&#39;re we have D weaponized space we
have made peaceful contact with these
civilizations we have made peace with
ourselves these extraordinary
technologies that are already in
existence can be put into full
application and that world which could
happen within 20 years will be more
different than today than today is from
the Stone Age literally literally more
different but there are stakeholders in
the current order that don&#39;t want that
to happen
where there is the war machine the
military industrial complex the
technology sector the energy sector the
transportation sector the medical sector
we&#39;re talking unbelievable amounts of
the macroeconomic system we&#39;re in is
based on a collapsing order and that
it&#39;s a order that&#39;s destroying the
planet in the meanwhile so to move off
that trajectory we&#39;re gonna have to make
some very hard grown-up decisions very
quickly because we&#39;re living right now
in a period of the biggest mass
extinction of species since the
dinosaurs and it&#39;s all man-made all this
man-made we&#39;re doing all this so we
created a problem we can solve the
problem but to get there has to come
from as Einstein said a different level
of consciousness than what created it we
can&#39;t replace international conflict or
racism or homophobia or ethnic conflict
or religious conflict with
interplanetary xenophobia and conflict
which is the main thrust of the fake
disclosure efforts that are going on and
which is people who are people a good
will and conscious need to understand
what&#39;s really happening out there and
then once you have this permanent peace
this level to these get fully
established and this pursuit of the
science of consciousness is the central
this is the key thing between a 1 and a
2 now all these things were overlapping
just like the other states of
consciousness these you know the seeds
of this are already in level 1 and level
0 we&#39;re working on that the seeds of a
level 2 are in this but then the pursuit
of the sciences of consciousness and the
interface between consciousness and mind
and space time matter electronics and
higher states of consciousness personal
enlightenment all through those states
of cosmic consciousness God
consciousness unity consciousness etc
that becomes the central focus of the
civilization why because there&#39;s
infinite abundance you push a button you
materialize what you need there&#39;s no
scarcity there&#39;s no poverty people
aren&#39;t working 80 hours a week with two
parents trying to have a family the
whole social structure changes where it
can then begin to pursue not only
creative and artistic pursuits but the
personal individual
of higher states of consciousness that
becomes the main thrust of a level to
civilization next
fence to interstellar now once the
civilization is peaceful and it also can
understand transdimensional II all of
these systems and is in a state where
they&#39;re pursuing higher states of
consciousness so they can understand
what&#39;s out there there&#39;s a lot out there
that&#39;s amazing
you get cleared to be interstellar so at
a level three humans will become
interstellar overtly so we will travel
amongst the stars as humans and then
there&#39;s the development and widespread
establishment of science of
consciousness not just that that is a
pursuit and the higher states of
consciousness start getting really the
the pursuit of not just part of the
society but the entire society say this
is a gradual process then happen all at
once but the times don&#39;t think in terms
of time think in terms of event horizons
okay the big mistake people say when
when when forget time times an illusion
it has to do with milestones and event
horizons of what we accomplish as a
people so then you have the an early
integration overtly into other
civilizations are the Close Encounters
of the fifth kind initiative we&#39;re
training people all over the world to do
this now so it&#39;s sort of the pioneering
Vanguard of this so that&#39;s what we&#39;re
doing and when inviting them to come
visit and they do and you&#39;ll see some of
this in a moment at level 4 you have at
least 1% of the civilization in cosmic
consciousness why is that important
because that creates a field effect
where everyone else gets pulled along
where they quicken their ability to go
into higher states of consciousness
because you then have 1% of the
population in the state of real
enlightenment where they&#39;re enlightening
the state of unbounded consciousness
while they&#39;re walking around and have
you so this is a level for civilization
these are
senior and the the ETS were encountering
that are at this level those are the
senior ambassadors that are enlightened
they have contact with other advanced
civilizations and they providing
guidance to emerging civilization what
does that mean there are in any cosmos
at any given time there are
civilizations like we are now or like we
were 10,000 years ago
etc and so on so you then become Mentors
this is why you people say well ancient
people had contact with ETS I said yeah
that we did we did we&#39;ve never been
alone we&#39;ll never be alone have never
been alone and the evidence for that is
quite obvious anyone who looks at it
dispassionately so the reason I put a
line here
everyone at birth is born into cosmic
consciousness because that&#39;s what and
this could happen fairly quickly once
you hit that 1% there is this coherent
field shift so then all the babies and
children that manifests in that world
are in a state of enlightenment at birth
there&#39;s widespread experience of what
the cities or these innate Vedic powers
and technologies parallel parallel those
states what does that mean it means that
you can then safely understand in
consciousness and do these teleportation
by location but it means because you can
experience it and understand it your
technology&#39;s mirror it and you can use
them safely without harming because
these are incredibly powerful
technologies both in terms of your
personal experience but also when you
apply it into a electronic system an
electromagnetic system transdimensional
physics so that these civilizations are
part of a senior interstellar council
collective that is operate has been
operating since time immemorial and that
is the central clearing entity that our
group contacts and and is cleared
through to operate next
this is too weird no I wanted to share
this for 25 years and so here it is yeah
so now at this point a level six
civilization is one where at least 1% of
the population that coherent field is in
God consciousness celestial and the
really the fet physical world takes home
qualities of almost like a high astral
world but it&#39;s a physical planet
everything is just very refined the
technologies the environment the
consciousness it&#39;s it&#39;s beautiful
beautiful beautiful and so that you know
it&#39;s when it really shifts level 7 is
where celestial and God consciousness
everyone from birth is in that state all
because remember neuroscience epigenetic
studies recently out of the top
universities have found that when you&#39;re
in a meditative state it actually not
only is are the ecstatics those
experiences passed on to the next child
but that the neuroplasticity enables the
mind to actually be altering its
physical form and it&#39;s carried on and
passed on in one generation it used to
be thought this had that many
generations has passed on in one well
positive and negative so as you evolve
in the core more refined there is this
quickening where the children born into
those civilizations are in these higher
states at birth in this level 7 everyone
is born into that state of celestial
perception full cities ability to
manifest D materialized what-have-you
and this is a very high and I&#39;m talking
extraterrestrial physical planets
physical worlds but it correlate it has
a corollary on the celestial highest
astral but its physical and then we&#39;re
gonna keep going level eight is where
you have at least 1% in this state of
unity consciousness where they able to
directly perceive unbounded mind
everywhere those technologies that are
corollaries to that interface with
knowing the MA
cities but the Epirus celestial and can
appear is with a thought so you can
manifest spacecraft places planets this
gets into some really the term at the
CIA is WS FM weird science and freakin
magic it isn&#39;t magic but it&#39;s something
that many people have an experience with
civilizations that are these levels five
six seven eight and up and they&#39;ll think
they had an experience with an angelic
being or celestial being because there&#39;s
so much similarity alright but they&#39;re
distinct but they&#39;re similar because
oneness is what it&#39;s all about but also
the technologies when you&#39;re talking
about a physical planet with physical
people they become transitioning into
what have been called light beings and
crafts that are light ships and
civilizations that are everyone on it in
these very high states of consciousness
so let&#39;s go on to nine ten so this is
when at birth everyone is a level nine
everyone is in perfect unity
consciousness at birth now this is
almost too hard to comprehend but from
where we are at a level zero but these
civilizations are out there we&#39;ve had
contact with these ambassadors and about
at this point about 1% or in this
brahman consciousness where they&#39;re
experiencing within themselves not only
unboundedness within and unboundedness
externally seeing all of it as one pure
conscious field but can experience the
whole cosmic creation at will with in
mind and consciousness as an individual
so that&#39;s this state and then ten is
when everyone is in that Brahman
consciousness state and it goes believe
it or not it goes on from there but this
is probably enough for us to sort of
contemplate and meditate on what&#39;s
interesting about all of these from a
level zero to a level ten is that the
technologies are commensurate with the
level of a consciousness
the consciousness interface with
technologies physical form physical
worlds physical spacecraft are an
outgrowth of the levels of consciousness
attained but think about ours our world
most of our world is in a state of
disunity socially spiritually fractured
and separate from our inner self our
technologies are destructive violent
breaking apart things blowing things up
your car you&#39;re basically just having a
little controlled explosion in an
internal combustion engine burning
dinosaur error fuels destroying the
environment and so is your electricity
that you&#39;re charging your Tesla with so
and tell you I&#39;m trying to get these
high tech people to think a little
further so go a little further let&#39;s go
come on come on come on come on it&#39;s
enough of that tinkering around the
edges won&#39;t do we&#39;re timed it&#39;s time
that we launch this next level and that
you begin to understand what you see
happening technologically and
environmentally is a reflection of the
level of consciousness of the planet
this is why we need this 1% of effect in
people who are pursuing higher states of
consciousness meditating understand this
to create that morphogenetic field this
quantum coherent field transition phase
transition that will then people you
don&#39;t even know will be affected by your
state of consciousness when they&#39;ve done
studies because they will spontaneously
move away from the actions and thoughts
of destruction all right and but imagine
then extrapolate that up through these
higher states of consciousness the
correlations and technology and
experience and purpose and your purpose
in the cosmos in being is beautiful now
let&#39;s go back a slide
hello can we go backward Oh
all right good so one more slide let&#39;s
do it here this level seven as I have
understood it is where humans we will
attain this level where everyone is in
the state of god-consciousness by the
end of this cycle this you go
this is half a million years cycle that
just opened so in the next few hundred
thousand years earth and all of humanity
will be in this level a level seven
it&#39;ll take a little longer to go beyond
