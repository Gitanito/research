 Though this was properly a Theosophical journal, it was one of the most important steps in the development of occultism in Spain.  It was the product of the novelist and Theosophist Mario Roso de Luna (1872-1931), a tireless Theosophical propagandist in Spain and South America, who supplied most of the content, including versions of some of his best-known fiction and occult idea like "El Mago de Logrosan" and "Del Arbol de las Hesperides."  It also included a translation of Kipling’s "If" ("Si tu te puedes conservar sereno . . . .").  From mid-1923 on, the journal abandoned its more journalistic format and became primarily the vehicle for a series of monographs.  Roso de Luna eventually left the Adyar Theosophists and joined the California society that followed Katherine Tingley, only to go his own way before his death in 1931, turning in the end to Om Cherenzi Lind.  The journal’s last issue, vol. 5, nos. 40-41, expressed the hope of restarting the journal in September, but it was not done.  Before his death Roso y Luna published Ateneo Filosofico, devoted to his own mature ideas on occultism.  NYPL; University of Pittsburgh; Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Espanola.
