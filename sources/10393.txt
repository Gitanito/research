  		              		Experience Description   

    I lived by myself as my wife passed away two years earlier.   I laid down on the couch. I was extremely sick with the worst flu I've ever had.  I just closed my eyes for a few minutes. 

  All of a sudden, I felt fine. I opened my eyes and was looking down on my body. I was lying on the couch for maybe 3 or 4 seconds.  Then, I was in a tunnel probably 30 foot in diameter. The walls looked like black rocks of all different sizes.  They had a high gloss look like they were wet. I floated for about 5 to 10 seconds.  There was  a light at the end of the tunnel maybe the size of a quarter.  Then I was sucked to the light in an instant and came out the other side.  It was such a beautiful place. I was in a meadow with green grass about 6 to 8 inches tall.  The grass was swaying in the wind.  Off to my left was a high hill with a creek running down from it. I noticed six or seven figures standing on the other side of the creek.  They were wearing blue robes.  Then my wife appeared and came over to the edge of the creek.  She spoke, 'Danny you have to go back. It's not your time.' I was instantly sucked back into my body.  I was also no longer sick.  

That's what happened and I remember it like it was yesterday.
