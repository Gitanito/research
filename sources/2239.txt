REMARKS ON REVELATION.
CHAP'.l'ER THIRTEENTH.
Rrv. l. And I stood npon the sand of the
ses, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having
oeven heads and ten horns, and upon his homs ten
crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy(
IN this verse we are taught that John had
a vision, and saw himself standing among
the tumultuous nations of the dearth ; and
-he saw the Roman kingdom rise up out of
the nations, having seven forms, or all kinds
of govemments, seven being a
perfect num-
ber in this prophecy. Heads denote govern-
ments, or
supreme power: 1, Republican;
2, Consular; 3, Decemvir; 4, --Dictatorial;
5, Triumvirate; 6, Imperial ; 7, Kingly.
John saw until the Roman was divided into
ten- kingdoms, all jointly reigning at one
time 'over these ten separate kingdoms, de-
noted by ten crowns; and this kingdom was
'a blasphemous power, because they claimed
'theecclesiastical power or authority over
mind, and dictated how and what»men
should worship.
6
2. And the beast which I saw was like unto 5
leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and
his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon
gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
The Roman kingdom, John saw, was like
the Grecian in conquering the world; and
his march, or power to tread under foot, was
equal to tha( of the Medo-Persian kingdom.
His laws and command were as lion-like
as Babylon, and as imperious as Nebuchad-
aiellafsvdeuree.. The :liknpenorf of Roma,
who had ubmined power by 'megan of the
arch-deceiver of mankind, the devil, Rev.
miii 9, having -received august, supreme
-power over all nations, and exercised
_the :etnlesiaatical power of Paganism over
'ithepeuple of theearth--he, the Emperor,
nalldd "
the dragon" in *he text, would de-
~|tmy orziske Paganism out of the way,2
Timm ii. 6,85 and would 've thesamts
'into ,the power of the Bisihp of Rome,
Ilhlicl .1/ii. 25. Thus the Emperor luetililm
dldgive. the Pope of Rome power over all
the Christian churohes, eaetem and weswia,
and gave him "
his beat," lfhe city of Romain
theeweot; bealsogave him great orsupreme
zuthorily in his par-xdect or oode of laws.
_This was in the year A. D. 538; from
which time the Pope exercised his supreme
power over the ninth and king of the
"1
earth, until A. D. 1798-during 1260 years
bf Papal supremacy.
'
'
3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded
to death; andhis deadly wound was healedfand all
the world wondered after the beast.
'
John saw the blasphemous Pagan head
wounded to .death and taken away, and the
Papacy take its place as a supreme head.
Then thez deadly wound was healed, andall
the~world wondered when they saw the
power of the Pope of the Roman kingdom.
`
4. And they worshipped the dragon which gave
power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast,
laying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to
make war with him?
And they worshipped Justinian, the Em-
peror of Rome, submitted to his arms and
Orthodoxy, and
they worshipped the king-
dom of Rome, saying, boastingly, Who is
able to make war with the kingdom of
Rome ?
5. And there was given unto him a mouth speak-
'iug_ great things and blasphemies; and power was
given unto him to continue forty and two months.
A mouth was given to the Pope_, or Pg.
pal civil power, to speak great words or
things and blasphemies, claiming universal
.power over the kings and kingdoms' of the
earth, as vicegerent of God ; andhe was to
exercise this power forty-two months, or

10. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into
captivity; he that killeth with the sword, mu! be
killed with the sword. Here is the patience and
faith of the saints. I
The Papal supreme power, which had led
the world into idolatry and the saints into
captivity, will, at the end of i'orty~two months,
or 1260 years, ver. 5, itself have to yield
to the supreme power of an Emperor great-
er than the Papal, and the Papal head be
led into captivity in eturnt And -as Pa-
pacy had killed millions in war, so, in
turn, it wonld be killed by the ,next sa-
preme power, in a war for the power it
had before exercised over the 'kings of the
earth. All this was literally fulfilled in the
French Revolution.---Then let the saints
have patience, and wait for this time, when
their faith in the promised .deliverance will
be increased, and their hope brightened for
a future and final deliverance.
ll. And I beheld another beast coming up out
of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and
he spake as a dragon.
What other kingdom is this ?, I answer:
It must be an image ofthe one
just descri-
bed. It must be an ecclesiastical kingdom,
for it has, or pretends to=have,;two, powersof
Christ, the Lamb of God. It also speaks
»11
with the same ,authorit p
as the .Roman Em-
perors pbefore. him.. lit is evident, then,
that it is the -next -succeeding ecclesiastical
Roman power to the imperial power of
Rome, and must, of course, mean the Papa.-
cy; .for the Emperor gave this its power,
and seat, and great authority. The Papal
power of Rome did copy after the old Ro-
man .form and laws of government; although
this was the-eighth, yet it is of the seven,
Rev. xvii. 11. Papacy did pretend to
wbrk Lrniracles; »tb call fire down from heav-
en, to bum. heretics, and to forgive sin.
'Thea this kingdmix, which arises out of the
fourth or Bsoman kingdom, 'is no less than
the Papalooclesisstical power. The prophet
having in the preceding verses described the
civil power of the same, new us a pro-
phetic -description of his ecclesiastic authori-
.ty, which 'he exercised ,over the saints.
12. And he exerciseth all the power of the iirst
beast before him and causeth th arth d th
, e e an em
_which dweli therein, to worship the tint beast, whose
deadly Wound was healed.
In this verse the prophet describes the
Pope as exercising all the Roman Pagan
power fwhich~emis1ed in the Latin kingdom
before him. .And he causes men to wor-
ship in like mmnerms did the Roman Em-
perors #under the Bagan wonship, which
'12
'head' had been wounded to death by the
pretended or real conversion of the Latin
Kings, and which ecclesiastical head was
healed in the establishment of another blas-
phemous head under Papacy, an image,
erect and bloody, equally supported by the
'civil power, as the former Pagan Rome.
, 13. And he doeth great wonders, so that he
maketh tire come down' from heaven on the earth in
the sight of men.
-
Here we have described the miracles
.which Papal Rome would pretend to have
power to perform in public, to deceive the
multitude, and make men worship as the
Roman Papal power might direct.
14. And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by
the means of those miracles which he_had
power
to
do in the sight of the beast;
saying
to t ern 'that
dwell~on the earth, that they shoul make an image to
gre
beast which had the wound by a sword _and did
ve.
We are here told the object of this pow-
er: to deceive those who dwell on the
earth, by means of those miracles which
he pretended to have power to -do, in the
presence of the civil power; and by so
doing to cause the citizens of Rome and the
subjects of that kingdom tovgive the same
power, both civiland ecclesiastical, to -Pa-
13
pacy, WhiCllfllld.b6f0l'B been held by Pugh!!
Rome under the Emperors; and by so doing
to establish a second kingdom, as an im-
age or a
corresponding power to the first,
both civil and ecclesiastical, thereby .to
heal the head of wounded Paganism, and
there would be established in Rome Papal
what had been lost by Rome Pagan.
15. And he had power to give life unto the image
of the beast, that the image of the beast should both
zgiak,
and cause that as many as would not worship
image of the beast should be killed. '
'
The Papal' power received great author-
ity, so that it could give life or death,
as the case
might be, and cause as many as
would not obey the Bishop of Rorhe to be
killed: Papacy being the image of the Pa-
gan Roman Empire.
16. And he causeth all, both small and great,
rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in
their right hand, or in their foreheads.
f
And he (Papal Rome) caused all under
his authority, from the infant in its mother's
arms to the aged man of many years, rich
and poor, bond or free, to receive the mark
of initiation and confirmation into the church
of Rome, under the control of this ecclesiasf
tical power.. ,
The initiation rite, which they
call baptism and regeneration, is
performed
14
in their foreheads, and the confirmation; or
token of fellowship, hy the right hand.
These marks bring them into full fellowship
and communion with the greet 'body of the
Roman Church, and were beth
by a hwof the llornazdlmureh.
17. And that no lmnmlgbtb orsetll,sa.vghq
that had the mark or the name bigthe beast, or the
uumberof his name.
V
No man, during the reign of Papacy,
where the lam of Papacy weve supreme,
could buy or sell, or use any lawful trade,
except such as were initiated into tba
Roman church, had a name in this Rof
man chmch or kingdom, and were numbered
with the multitude in the great association
of this blasphemous power.

Here it is necessary that the resdershonld

his word, and by comparing Scripture with
Scripture, get an

4. To undersemd the number given,

1. It cannot mean the Papal kingdom;
for that is an image of this beast. Then
M we can leam what°Pa1pacy is the image of,
we shall have at clue to an understanding of
the beast. Itis a beast which existed be~
fore Papacy did, or how coulé Papacy be
made in its likeness of image-See 12th
verse. Now compare Rev. 1, with
Rev. xii. 3, 4, and xvii. I--7 ;»a9so with
Daniel vii. 7, 8, 23, 24 ; which shows plainly
that it is the 4th, or Roman kingdom, and
a blasphemous, bloody, persecuting power.
Then it is a plain matter of fact, that
it is a full and clear description of Rome
Pagan.
2. What may we unéerstand by num-
bering this kingdom? I_ answer, it is to
finish, or take it away. See a sample in the
first of the four kingdoms-Babylon. Read
Daniel v. 26, 30. To number, then, is to
finish or take away. Compare Daniel xi.
31, and xii. 11, with 2 Thess. ii. 7.
3. What is the number of a man? It
is the nnmber of his days, or the ears of his
life. See Psalm xc. 12 ;'Job x. gi; xiv. 5, 6,
14 ; xvi. 22. See margin, years if number.
The number of the years of fthe 'Bnnsan
kingdom under itdfirstbluphumous head of

16
Pagani m, was six hundred sixty-six years,
beginning B. C. 158, and ending 508
AJ). : it being 666 years that Pagan Rome
reigned as the supreme power over the
earth, and was that bloody, persecuting
power over the people of God, which
destroyed the city and sanctuary, and trod
down the holy people, until its power was
taken away, to make room for the image-
beast of Papacy, which reigned supreme
forty-two months or twelve hundred and
sixty years.

CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.
Rn. xviil 1. And there came one of the seven
angels which had the seven vials, and talked with
me, saying unto me, Come hither ; I will shew unto
thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth
upon many waters.
In this chapter, John, by the angel, is
shown the character and judgment of the
great false Church of Rome, which sitteth
on many people, multitudes, nations and
tongues.
See explanation, in the 15th ver.,
of the waters.
2. With whom the kings of the earth have com-
mitted ibniieation, and the inhabitants of the earth
17
have! been made drunk with the wine of her for-
mcation.
With this false Church of Rome, the
Kings of Rome have committed fornication.
They have united their civil with her ec-
clesiastical power, and thereby produced a
blood-thirsty and a
supreme monster of in-
iquity, which has made the inhabitants
of the earth giddy with ignorance, supersti-
tion and bigotry, and caused them to have
fellowship with this monster of iniquity,
in the union of church and state; worshiping
according to the laws of the abomination
that maketh desolate.
3. So he curled me away in the spirit into the
wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having
seven heads and ten horns.
John was carried away in his spirit, into
the then future desolations of the Roman
earth, when the Emperors of Rome would
lose their power in the desolations of the
empire by the barbarian Kings. These
conquered the empire, and afterwards gave
their power to the false, bloody church of
Rome, which received her power, seat and
great authority from the Emperor Justinian,
and her homage from the ten kings. L
18
4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and
scarlet-color, and decked with gold and precious
stones and pearls, having a
golden cup in her hand
full of abominations and Iiltluness of her fornication.
The raiment and splendor, with the
riches Of this false Church, is literally ful-
filled in the dress and pomp and show of
the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Legates and
Priests of the Roman Catholic Church. The
.golden cup in her hand, is the political
bait she holds out to all nations. In a me-
_public she can be a great _republialn ; and in
'a kingdom,a flaming royalist. ,Her golden cup
is held outfto-aill sorts of governments, sothst
if possible by false pteteimes, plighted Eith
and broken vows, she may obtain her object-
power over all. These political movements
of Priests -and Jesuits are too well known to
need any more description of her abomina-
tions, filthiness and fomication with the
<governinenis of I earth.
'
5. And upon her forehead was a name written,
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE
MOTHER -OF HARLOTS AND ABOMLNA-
TIONS OF THE EARTH.
'In thevery front of this false Chunch is
_her public profession-Mrsmznv-written.
~She`claims the single -and sole power of ex-
plaining the mysteries of God's word; and
forbids-any of her liege subjects from read-
19
ing, or believing and practising any of God's
precepts, excepting in accordance with her
comments and permission.
Bannon 'rl-In GREAT;
This is as plainly fulfilled as the former.
Nebuchadnezzar, the head of the Babylonian
king, claimed the power of a God, pretend-
ed to make a God, and then compelled his
sub`ects to fall down and worship it;
and] if they would not, death was the con-
sequence. This mystical Babylon has done
the same. The Pope claims to be the vice-
gerent of God on earth. He also claims the
power of making the common bread and
wine, the actual body and blood of God.
They have also put to death many millions
of heretics, as they call those who do not
follow in their creed.
THE Mornlm or -HAnLo'rs.
Well may the Church of Rome
'
claim
the title of Mother Church; and those
churches which have come out from her may
as well be called n_uLo°1~s. For there are
few of them at this time, but are partaking
of the old mother's character, and commit-
ting the same .momnrrtous of pride, vain
show, worldly grandeur. and riches, popular
applause and political power.-Where is
there a Protestant sect but now claims the
same authority as the Pope over 'those who

standing the word of God? Never did the
Church of Rome persecute the Protestant

The angel inquires of John why 'he
should marvel -? He then informs him that
he will tell him the mystery of this false
Church, that has her Epower, seat and great
-authority from the Roman empire ; and also
of the :Roman .empire, which had the
seven forms of government and ten kings.

into ignorance, superstition, will-worship,

of Christ's coming, .when he shall lcome to
false vengeance on them that know not
'God,_gn¢l'ebey'not»'thejGfospel. And then
22
they who dwell upon the earth shall wonder
at their own stupidity and base ingratitude,
in not believing the word of God, and in
slighting the overtures of mercy, while they
enjoyed a probation ; yet they will neglect so
great salvation, and not have their names
recorded in the Lamb's book of life, which
God prepared in the
beginning of the world,
for all those who would believe and obey
the gospel. And they will wonder and per-
ish in the general destruction of the king-
doms of the Roman empire, which is now
Pagan, not yet Papal. .But it is the same
bloody perecutin
"
power it will be when
it becomes Papj; for then it will only be
animage of what it now is.
9. And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The
seven heads are seven mountains, on which the wo-
man sitteth.
This is an explanation for the inquiring
minds of those who desire an
understanding
in the word of God. The seven executive
heads are seven forms of government. See
comments on Rev. xiii. 1. A
10. And there are seven kings; tive are fallen, and
one is, and the other is not yet come ; and when he
eometh, he must continue a short space. .
A
These seven executive_ heads, here called
Kings, have and will exist in the Roman
23
kingdom. Five of them-1, Republican ;
2, Consular; 3, Decemvir; 4, Dictatorial;
5, Triumvirate-these forms had all passed
when John saw his vision; "and one is,"
that is Imperial, then in power; the "
other,"
Kingly,
"
is not yet come." The kings did
,not exercise their power over the empire of
Rome until after about 508 years after
Christ. Then the Kingly must be the su-
preme head 'for a short space ; all of which did
.take place between A. D. 508 and A. B. 538.
ll. And the beast that was, and is not, even he is
the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdi-
JIQQ.
The 'kingdom of Rome, which was in
ipower
then; but not in its church state.
or when the Church of Rome should ob-
'tain its supremacy, it would be the eighth
head, in succession. Yet the Roman Church
would be of the seven ;that is, it would have
all the seven forms of government of the
former Roman, and no other; and although
it would be in the succession, the eighth
head yet it only retains the seven forms.
In that sense, it would not probably be a
new form of government, but "is of the
seven"-combining all forms of government
,into one; and at the.end it shall go into per-
dition.
94
19. And the ten horns which thou sawest are tel
kings, which have received no kingdom as
yet; hut
receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
This is an explanation of the ten homs,
that represent ten kings, which had not
received their place among the seven heads
when John saw this vision; but they will
receive their power in the kingly form of
government a. short space of time in this
Roman empire of seven heads.
13. have one mind, and shall give their
power and strength unto the beast.
h
These kings, after they are -all converted
to one faith, or one mind, became, as they
then called it, orthodox. These "
shall give
their power,
"
i. e. supremacy or ,
head,
"
and strength," meaning the' physical
strength of the military to assist the Bishop
and Church of Rome in obtaining the su-
preme power over all other sects, kingdoms
and powers.
14. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the
Lamb shall overcome them; for he is Lord of lords
and King of kings; and they that are with him are
called, and chosen, and faithful.
.These ten kings or kingdoms, shall sup-
port this Anti-Christian power, the Church
of Rome, and by so doing will oppose or
make war
against the Lamb of God, Jesus
Christ; and the Lamb of God shall over-
25
come them ; for Jesus must reign on his
Father's throne until he puts down all rule,
and all authority and power, and he must
reign until he puts all enemies under his
feet, 1 Cor. xv. 24, 25. When he [Jesus]
shall come,he will dash them, like a potter's
vessel, to pieces. Compare Psalm ii. 8,
9; Daniel ii. 35, 36; vii. 22; Rev. ii. 27.
He will grind them to powder. He will
carry them away as the wind carries away
the chaif of the summer threshing floor, so
that no place on earth shall be found for
them: for Christ is Lord over all lords,
and King over all kings ; and will by these
means take posse sion of his lawful inherit-
ance, the earth, and reign forever and
ever. Then will those who are his by faith
be redeemed by his grace from all their
enemies, even from death, and they shall be
_with him where he is, and be like him, called
by his Spirit and word, being chosen by his
grace, and having chosen salvation through
grace. He has faithfully performed his
promise unto them, and they are faithful in
their obedience to him.
15. And he saith unto me, The waters which thou
lawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and
multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
This verse is an explanation of the first
verse, and means just what it says-showing
26
ever whom the false Chureh of Rome would
have power, and who would sustain her in
that power, and be her followers even down
to perdition. Oh, that men would be wise !
16. And the ten horns which thou szwest upon
the beast theéeshlllhatsth h dfshall
,
'
e w ore, an make
her desolate and naked, and shall eat her Kelli, and
burn het with Exe.
The ten horns are a representation of the
ten kingdoms that would arise out of the
division ef the old Roman empire, as it
stood when it began its conquest of Mace+
donia and the east. These kingdoms would,
for the time, give unto the false Church of
Rome their power and strength. Yet after the
time appointed of her reign over the kings
of the earth, 1960 years, these kingdoms
would hate the supreme power of 'the Ro#
msn ohmoh, and would take if fo them-
selves, would her of-her benefiees, con-
hseate her goods, take away her supremacy,
Garry her eapiive, make her desolate, eat up
het power to rule over kingdoms, and divide
it among themselves. They would burn her
-palaces and chapels, her prisons and nim-
nefies, her pictures and pleasant things with
fire, and lay waste het cities and territory
by war and the sword. This was
literally
woomplished in. the French Revolution. l

will, and to agree and give their kingdom unto the
beast, until the words of God shall be fulhlled. M
We learn by this verse that God has 8.
supervision over the kingdoms of men-that
while they pursue their wicked propeusities,
they execute unknowingly the purposes of
God. These rulers, or kings of these
kingdoms, must first be agreed, before Pav
ganism could be taken away. They, then,
must be converted to the Orthodox faith
of the Catholic Church Of Rome, before
they would yield their power and submit to
_the Bishop Of Rome, and establish the Papal
Hierarchy, In the beginning of the sixth
century these kings were converted tp the
Christian faith; yet many of them were
Arians. But this was sufiicient to take away
Paganism. Iustinian was than raised up
to make war against, the Arian kings,
and compelvthem to submit and agree to Or-
thodoxy ; so that in A. D. 538, they gave
their power and strength to the Church Of
Rome ; and the Bishop of Rome be08-me
head over the kingdoms, as well as the
churches, and the two homed beast came
;
'
out of the Roman earth.-The words of
'
,Od ,Were thus far fulfilled, and the world
`
'w it not. Why? Because they believed
not in the words of God, and regarded not
the unseen hand of the Almighty.

18. And the woman which thou sawest is that
great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
The Church of Rome, in this verse, is
very appropriately called agreat city. First,
because of its great multitude. Secondly,
because of its great influence. Thirdly,
because of its combination. Fourthly, be-
cause of its mode of government ; and last-
ly, because of _its laws and ordinances.
1. Like agreat city. Rome. as a Church,
has claimed for her communicants a vast
multitude among all nations, of all grades,
colors and conditions.
2. A great city has a great influence
over the country where it is situated,--in
the manners, customs, religion and politics
of the inhabitants of the same. So like-
wise with the Church of Rome. Who can-
not see that in all the countries where she
has gained any ascendancy, the same dis-
solute manners, and vain show and costume
have prevailed? The samemoml blight and
political degradation, in every Catholic coun-
try in Europe, is at this .time true to the
very letter.
3. A city is a large corporatebody; and
so is the Church of Rome. It is not
many bodies, but one at least in profession.
Wherever their influence is felt, and votaries
are obtained, they belong to the same combi-
29
nation ; and this is the reason why the Pope of
Rome, to this day, calls Catholics his sub-
jects,-whether belonging to the Czar of Pe-
tersburg or to Queen Victoria of England ;-
whether they are the vassals of the Mogul
of the East, or freemen of the land of liberty
in the West. All, all are the subjects, or
sworn citizens of this great city.
4. Its mode of government. Great cities
have a
Mayor, Aldermen, Council, Police,
Watchmen, &c. So with the Church of
Rome. She has her Pope and Cardinals,
her Archbishops and Bishops, her Priests and
Jesuits, all watching for the interests of this
one great Roman Church, like a vast city.
5. The laws of the Catholic Church are
concocted, promulgated, enforced and obey-
ed, in like manner with the laws and ordi-
nances of a
great city. Her business is like
a
city. Read Rev. xviii. 10, 20. What
better figure could the inspired penman use
to describe this abominable church, reigning
over all kingdoms of the earth, than a great,
wicked city?
30
CHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.
'
l. And utter these things I saw mother angel como
down hum heaven, having great power; and the
earth was lightened wah his gloq. r
After John had seen the vision iii the
'1'7th chapter, in which the character and
acts of the Roman kingdom had been min-
utely described,under both of its blasphemous
heads, Pagan and Papal. He, in this chap-
ter, has a view of the fall and final destruc-
'tion of the Papal power, and the overthrow of
the last Satanic kingdom on the earth. This
first verse represents the coming of Christ
from heaven, in his power and great glory,
`to take vengeance on those that obey not
the gospel, who have worshipped' the king-
doms of the earth, and obeyed only the laws
of Papacy-the blasphemous power of the
man of Sin, the servant of Satan. Compare
Psalm Xcvii. 3, 8, Isa. ii. 6 to 2l,Matt. xxiv.
20.
_
2. And he cried mightily with a
strong voice, say-
ing, Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen, and is be-
come the habitation of devils, and the hold of every
gong spirit, and a
cage of every unclean and hateful
ir .
-
'
He comes with a strong voice, which is
the final shout of victory, 1 Thess. iv. 16,
31
"
saying, Babylon the Great is fallen, is fal-
len." This shows me that the Papal Church
is to have two overthrows»--one "fall" un-
der the power of the ten kings, as in the
French Revolution, when she became a
cage
for every unclean and hateful bird, which is in
agreement with Paul's description of the
same event, 2 Thess. ii. 8. The other
"fall
"
is the final destruction of all'Satanic
power on earth, when the shout of victory
is given from all the heavenly host, as is
given in Rev. xi. 15, also xiv. 7, 8, when
the battle is won and the victory completed.
Then this voice will raise the righteous
dead, and put the last enemy under his
feet. Thevfirst "fall" was the loss of su-
preme power, and exposure of her abomin-
ations. It. will show that the devil and
Satan, and all foul spirits, dwelt in this
kingdom ; and it was a
cage in which dwelt
all manner of tyrants, wicked, proud and un-
clean men, from every nation under heaven.
The second' "fall
"
will be the final de-
struction of all, when it will be said to the
saints, "God hath avenged you on her,"
21st verse.
3. For all nations have drunk of. the wine of the
wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth
have committed fornication with her, and the mer-
-__...-- _...___
B2
chants cf the earth are waxed rich -through the
abundance of her delicacies. c
The expression "-Mr" in this text, must
mean Babylon; and it lmnstmesnmone than
the nominal Church of Rome: for allmen
are not the visible members of her commun-
ion. Yet all nations have committed forni~
cation with her, and will drink of the wrath
of God, which he will pour out upon her
and them. Babylon, then, must mean Church
and State, and to unite them is fomimtion.
Vesting the supreme power in both of these
is Babylon, or confusion ; for God has severed
them, and says, My kingdom is not of this
world. Then, when the church of Rome,
or
any other church or body of Christians,
seek for and obtain the honors and emolu-
ments of the political 'powers of the earth,
they commit foruication with the nations and
kings or kingdoms, as the case may be; and
the :kings or rulers of the Satanic kingdoms,
when they seek to be defenders ofthe faith
of the saints, and tyrannize over the minds
and consciences of msn, also, commit
foruication with her; and both_ together form
an alliance unnatural,and are
Babylon ilIll8l'
robes of blood. All wicked, selfish and
deigning demagogues, bigots and sectarian
-leaders among men, are
evidently intoxicated
or drunken after or for this power of civil
B8
Qmd ecclesiastical authority over their fellow-
'men. And it is a fact, that the great men,
ind rich men, the mighty and merchants of
the earth, are waxing rich by means oi' the
*favors obtained, and privileges granted them
'bythe civil and ecelesiastical powers in the
lcountries where they reside. See the "
corn
laws
"
of England, the "
toll laws
"
of
Wales, and in many other countries; the
°"
tithe taxes
"
of Ireland, and the "banking
-and company privileges
"
in our own and
every other country-giving the rich and
iavored classesflawful powers to take unlaw-
ful gain-making "the rich richer and the
poor poorer"-»-as say your own smtesmen.
How literally has this verse been fulfilled in
fourduy. See James v. 1, 8.
4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying,
"Come out of het, my people, that ye be not partakers
,af h|arsins,'and that ye receive mmofhu plagues.
V
This text is awarning voice from God
~to_ his people ;-»-that when the governments
of the 'world and the churches are seen
"thus engaged in wronging and enslaving
-the poor no favor the rich--when they
Y are seen expending their thousands' and
'millions to make a show and gratify their
»pi~ide, while millions of human beings are
wuiferingl for their daily foodandthe breed
34
of life,-to come out, and have no
fellowship
either with Church or State, lest when God
comes out against them in his. righteous
judgments, we be found on the sideof the
enemy, and therefore be made .partakers
of the plagues God will send on the ungod-
ly. For all these Satanic kingdoms and
Anti-Christian churches will be carried away,
and no place will be found for them. _
5. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and
God hath remembered her iniquities.
Surely the present moment is one hi
which the sins of the people are reaching to
heaven. And God, remembering his oath,
will not much longer delay his coming; and
Babylon the Great will fall the second time,
to rise no more forever.
6. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and
double unto her doubleaocording to her works; in
the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double.
This, with the following verses to the
19th verse, shows the situation and punish-
ment the false Church will receive, between
the first and second fall, when she will be
utterly destroyed. She is now receiving her
reward from the hands of the kings and na-
tions of the earth. As she had made war
against kings, and as they had depended on
35
,her for their political existence, so now they
have made w'a.r.agiinst~her,and have robbed
her of her power and territory; and she
éis a, dependant on
'kings for her existence,
lbbth political and ecclesiastical-heing sup-
ported by Austrian bayonets.
7. How much she hath glorified herself and lived
deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her _;
for she saith in her heart, I sit a. queen, and am no
fwidow, and shall see no sorrow.
'She has glorified her earthly power, she
thas lived deliciously among the kings,-
~once commandi a revenue equal to any
other kingdom iiiilurope,and is now a poor
bankrupt, as to her ,national resources. She
pretended to be the queen of heaven, the only
Catholic Church, against which the gates of
'hell should never prevail; but behold her
now, a desolate beggar at the feet of kings,-
a
fewning hypocrite among the political
-daughters.
8. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day,
death, and mourning, and famine; and 'she *shall be
tutterly burned with fire 1 for strong is ihe Lord God
vvholjudgeth her. A
-Then her-next fail 'wil eomeuponf her
suddenly, "in one day," and death perha ,
dn every shape; uiourningyfamine, and fe
sviillhe hm' -eternal destruction, for
be done--by the strong arm'of' the Al-
mighty God she will be finally judged.
9. And the kings ofthe earth who hue commixtod
fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail
`her, and lament for her, when they shall see the
smoke of her burning.
Before she is "burned, while the smoke is
ascending, between the first and second fall,
the kings of the earth political rulers, who
have committed fomication with her, have
been the means of favoring her claims, and
have received help to power and office by
her influence, will, when they see the smoke,
or evidences of the loss of her influence,
bewail and lament for her: for this is her tor-
ment and sorrow, to lose her influence over
the minds and consciences of the common
people.
10. Standing afar oil' for the fear of her torment,
saying, Alas, alas! that great city Babylon, that
mighty city ! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
The rulers will not dare to come out
openly and boldly to favor the Church of
Rome ; but will stand afar oil] for fear of the
common people, and the loss of influence,
which is her present torment; but will cry,
Alas, alas! that great city of the union of
Church and State-that mighty combination
87
`
to obtain powerover our fellows! 'For the
hour is come, and is already manifest, when
religion will no longer be used as a
stepping
stone to earthly power, and to enslave the
minds of the freemen in Christ.
ll. And the merchants of the earth shall weep
and mourn over her; for no man
buyeth their mer-
ohandise any more.
The merchants are the great men of the
earth, see 23d verse. These shall weep and
mourn over this mighty engine to deceive
men in morals as well as in politics, be-
cause of the loss of its power over their
minds ; for men will not be deceived by her
sorceries any more, "For by thy sorcenkas
were all nations deceived." See last clause
22d verse.
12. The merchandise of gold, and silver, and pre~
cious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and
purple,
and silk, and scarlet, and all thyne wood, and a l man-
ner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most
precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble.
13. And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and
fhmkincense, and wine, and oil, and fine Bout, and
wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and bones, and cha-
riots, and slaves, and souls of men.
14. And the fruits that thy soul lusted after, are
de arted from thee, and all things which were
dainiy
aus goodly are departed from thee, and thou sh t
lind them no more at all.
These are a description of the merchan-
38
disc in which this false church will be en-
gaged, thus showing clearly that her treasures
are on earth rather than in heaven. When
we read over this catalogue of
merchandise,
and review the apparent condition of the
Protestant churches at the present day, we
cannot tell where to find the true church,-
if these are the marks of a false church.
It is no wonder our great men feel so anx-
ious to get this book, (the Revelation) con-
denmed as
spurious, or to make it an eni a.
That these texts are to be understood élrer-
ally, as
they read, I can have no doubt; for
they are nowhere explained in the Bible as
figures. They show that where a church is
lusting atler these earthly things, she has
become false to her Lord, and may properly
be called a harlot; and they go to show, that
in the end all her earthly treasures will be
taken from her, and the church willjstand
naked and ashamed before God ,iii Judg-

lating church when they see the tokens of
her fall, for fear of her torments. At the
present day, many of the men of the world
would be ashamed to be found in the feasts
and fairs of some of our churches. Yet
they weep and wail when any of the mem-
bers come out of the rotten ship.
16. And saying, Alas,alas! that great city that
was clothed in tine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and
decked witn gold, and precious stones, and pearls !
17. For in one hourso great riches is come to

in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea
stood afar oiil
'
The great men of the earth and the rich
men, will mourn and lament for the down-
fall of the Church of Rome. In another
place, Rev. xvii. 16, it says they will hate
this same church, and make her desolate,
&c. Why this contradiction? I answer:
they hate her nile over them, and the de-
gradation they suffer under her sway; but
they only want her power to enslave others,
and are only coveting the same rule which
they hate in her. Yet in destroying her
rule and power, the common people must
be undeceived, which in the end operates
against themselves ; and when the people
learn their rights in the one case, they will
understand them in the other; and when the
40
kings and great men were purposingito ob-
tain the power of Papacy for themselves,
the people discovered the mode of keeping
it from both. Let me show a case in point.
A few years since, our Protestant divines
were loud and strong against the Papacy
for suppressing the Bible from the common
people, and compelling men to come to their
Priests for an understanding of the Scrip-
tures. The people learned their rights, and
began to read and understand for themselves.
And what do we hear from our Protestant
Priests now? One says,
"
How dare Mr.
Miller attempt to explain the Bible, seeing
he understands neither Hebrew nor Greek?
"
Another,
"
We advise Mr. Miller to go
home to his farm, and let alone the ex-
pounding the Scriptures unto them that
understand Bible exegesis." Still another,
"
IfMr. Miller had been brought up a sober
Churchman, he would have gone to his.Bish-
op to expound the Scripture for him."
Still another, "It is very impolite for ladies
to study the Old or New Testament."
These are samples of the perfect iliéon-
sistencies of our would be great men. 'lime
great secret is, they covet
dpower
and
worldly gain for themselves, eplore .the
loss of power and hate the persons "who
possess it. 'i'hus it is with all classes of
worldly men.
41
18. And cried, when they saw the smoke of her
burning, saying, What city is like imto this great
city.
~
19. And they cast dust on their heads, and cried,
weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas! that great
city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in
the sea, by reason of her oostliness! for in one hour
is she also made desolate.
Here is a continuation of the same mourn-
ing for the loss~of the World's honors and
goods ; and the present troubles in the
Italian tates prove, and show plainly
that the hour of her dissolution is at hand.
Therefore God calls upon his people to
20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and
I6
holy
plpostles
and prophets ; for God hath avenge you on
err.
For the last and final fall of this false
church, with all other Anti-Christian power,
has now come; also the vengeance of God is
extended,and the last plague and indignation
poured out.
21. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a.
great mill-stone,and cast it into the sea., saying, Thus
with violence shall that great city Babylon, be thrown
down, and shall he found no more at all.
This verse shows how it' will be done ,-
like a great millstone sinking into the sea
with violence-like a mighty earthquake-
.,¢-¢»--
..._.,_.
-
42
like the dashing in pieces of a potter's yes-
sel, Psalm ii. 9-like a stone breaking in
pieces the image, Daniel ii. 34-see Rev.
xvi. 18 to 21.
22. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and
of pipers and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at
all in thee ; and no craftsman, of whatsoever crah he
be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound
of a mill~stone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
23. And the light of a candle shall shine no more
at all in thee; and the voice of a bride room and
of the bride shall be heard no more at ah in thee;
for thy merchants were the great men of the earth;
for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
These verses show us the effect of God's
final judgment and indignation upon the
earth; for the great city Babylon meaning
the Church of Rome, had corrupted the
whole earth, by her abominations, her for-
nications, her sorceries, and breach of God's
ordinances and laws, by her riches and pow-
er. Therefore the voice of music would no
more be heard in her revels, nor in her
palaces, nor in her idolatrous. temples. No
craftsman of any craft would ever be there
to make her costly robes of purple or scarlet
dye. The sound of her machinery would
no more be heard. The light of the candle,
nor the voice of the bridegroom and bride,
all of merriment would cease forever. The
43
reasons assigned are,
"
That her merchants
are the great men of the earth," and of
course when the earth is renovated, none of
the men of the earth, who have laid up their
treasures on earth, will be there. The meek
only will inherit the earth. When the
wicked are cut off thou shalt see it, says
the Psalmist, Psalm xxxvii. 34. David saw
this same power, Psalm xxxvii. 35 and 36.
Compare this with 20th and 21st vs. in the
chapter we are considering.
"
For by thy
sorceries were all nations deceived." It
does not say all of all nations were deceived,
but it must mean a part were deceived out
of all nations.-And what may be consid=-
ered as a
corroborating fact, is, that the Ro-
man church claims adherents and subjects
in every known nation on the globe. This
passage then, cannot apply to any other
church under heaven; for there is no other
church in one
body that pretends to, or can
claim converts among all nations. And if
the character we have been trying to under-
stand in these chapters we have thus far
commented on,» is not the Roman church,
then there must be another exactly like it on
this earthly ball. You may say that some
of the Protestant churches are as fond of
power as the Catholics, are as full of mer-
chandise, and as fond of show, and love
---->-__T-
44
mind earthly things, and make slaves of bod-
ies and souls of men, as do the Catholics.
This may be all true, and for aught I can
tell, they may be harlots, or daughters of
the old mother, yet the marks given cannot
all apply to any one Protestant church.
Do not, you enquire, the Protestant
churches break the laws of God by their
traditions? Yes. Do they not worship
their idols as well as Romans? Yes, if you
please to have it so. Where' then is the
failure? you enquire. I answer: she rules
over kings. But does not the Episcopal
church rule over the king? No.The King
or Queen rules over the church. Even the
young Queen Victoria is now the head of
that church. And no Protestant church
has reigned over any king or kingdom.-
Again, another mark:
24. And in her was found the blood of propheS,
and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the
earth.
This then is a mark in which we cannot
be mistaken. I defy the great men of the
earth to show an instance .in the history
of the world, where any church, calling
itself Christian, since the days of Christ,
has had the power of life and death,
even in civil authority, but the church of
45
Rome; and in her may be found the blood
of nearly or quite fifty milliohs of the hu-
man race, who dird for their religion.--
I have been truly astonished, of late, to
hear and see our Protestant divines trying
to prove that this Church of Rome is not
the woman on the scarlet colored beast.--
But to me it must be a certainty, that there
can be no other; and if the Roman church
is the woman
spoken of in these chapters,
we must be near t.he close of our world's
history. We must be within the first and
second fall of Babylon. Every thing is
fulfilled that is here prophecied of, except
the last thing, the overthrow and the final
fall and destruction of all her earthly
power and possessions. The kings have
hated her, they have taken away her power
over themselves, they have spoiled her goods
and bumed her palaces, they have broken
down her prisons and demolished her nun-
neries they have made her that made kings
tremble at her nod, now become a
crouching
hypocrite at the feet of kings, pleading for
her pretended birthright, which she acknowf
ledges is wrested from her by the kings in
the ,French Revolution. Where then are
We," pro ,hetic chronol ? I ab'ure you,
res,£r, answer thggciuestion lor your-
self. Let nothing hinder you If time has
46
nearly run out, as the writer verily be-
lieves, how is' the case between God and
your soul? Has not the cry gone forth
from every Christian land,
"
Behold the
bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet
him ?" Did you ever see or hear such a
cry before, such a searching of Scripture,
such a
moving of mind from every land,
such fearful forebodings ofthe hypocrites in
every sect, so little good sense used by our
opponents in their arguments, so much
skepticism and Gemian Neology, ridicule
and scofling, as the opposers of this cry
use? Yet what has been the effect ? The
editors of our religious periodicals have re-
fused to give our reasons. Denunciation,
falsehood, bombast and ridicule, have been
their common weapons of attack. But they
have fallen harmless at our feet. Noth-
ing can be more evident than that God is on
our side. What l a few ignorant fanatics
raise such a cry, that scores of our
great,
learned, doctorated men of science, puffed
and lauded by every penny paper in the
land, with all their skill and tact in ar-
gument, have never been able to start
apillar or remove a landmark ! Surely my
friend, you will examine these things; and if
they are so, you will not, you cannot, you
dare not fall to sleep and let that come upon
47
you unawares, for which all Second Advent
brethren are
looking, and waiting, and
watching-the Day ofthe Lord. Oh fly!
poor sinner, fly!! Stay not in all the
plain! Awake, awake! your life and soul
is all at stake. No harm to watch-all
men acknowledge this. Be ready then.
And may we all be watching when our
Lord may come, and then receive him with
the grand response: This is our God, we
have waited for him, and he will save us."
