All the pain was subdued and I felt like everyone around me was in a different world. I saw a very bright light, the light was beckoning me, it wasn't like it was speaking to me, but rather, I knew what it was saying in my guts. It said, 'Let go, relax, everything is going to be okay.' There was just love everywhere; there was nothing to worry about. Then I heard my father's voice (in the ambulance at the time) talking, and I started to pray to God, I said I didn't want to die yet etc. I tried really hard to catch that first breath. I don't remember anything after that I just awoke in the hospital.
