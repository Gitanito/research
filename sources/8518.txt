  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   General anesthesia is administered during surgical procedures to block   sensory, motor, and sympathetic nerve transmission.&nbsp;   It induces pain relief, amnesia (loss of ability to recall the   procedure), motionlessness, reduced autonomic nerve responses, slowed heart and   breathing rates, and lowered blood pressure. Anesthesia involves intensive   efforts to maintain loss of consciousness during surgery, “and that essentially,   the patient is dead to the world.”[i]

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Neurologist Robert Spetzler states the aim of adequately administered   anesthesia is to:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   …bring the brain to a halt.&nbsp;    We don’t just want the brain to be asleep.&nbsp;   We want the metabolic activity of the brain to stop.&nbsp;   Every measurable output that the body puts out really disappears   completely, so that you have no measurable neuronal activity whatsoever      [ii]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Cardiologist Pim   van Lommel further explains:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Registration of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) in patients   under general anesthesia has shown that unconsciousness during surgery is   coupled with a clear change in the brain’s electrical activity, with lower   frequencies and less extreme discharges. This is consistent with the   neurophysiological hypothesis that brain function   &nbsp;&nbsp; is completely disrupted and impaired under general anesthesia.[iii]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus, it appears   medically inexplicable that highly lucid and enhanced consciousness can exist   under properly administered anesthesia. Nonetheless, numerous NDEs occurring   under general anesthesia have been verified.

    Perhaps the most compelling case of a NDE ever documented under general   anesthesia is that of Pam Reynolds. Cardiologist Michael Sabom emphasizes the   significance of her case:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Occasionally, a patient…reports exceptionally clear consciousness [under general   anesthesia], including lucid thoughts, memories, emotions, and verifiable   perceptions from a position outside and above their unconscious body, despite   the total absence of loss of demonstrable brain activity.&nbsp;   There are only a few cases in which this loss of function has been   carefully documented…Because she [Pam] had her NDE during brain surgery, when   the activity of the cerebral cortex and brain stem were constantly monitored,   hers is a good example of an NDE during carefully documented brain function.      [iv]   &nbsp;&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pam was diagnosed   with a giant aneurysm in a cerebral artery near her brain stem. Although   Neurosurgeon Robert Spetzler agreed to operate on Pam, her chance of surviving   surgery was remote. The procedure necessitated that Pam’s body temperature be   lowered to fifty degrees and all blood drained from her brain. She was   additionally attached to a heart-lung machine (a mechanical circulation support   of the heart and lungs, also known as cardiopulmonary bypass).&nbsp;   Finally, clicking devices were inserted into both ears to monitor her   brain. Spetzler emphasizes:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   During standstill, Pam’s brain was found “dead” by all three clinical   tests-her electroencephalogram was silent, her brain-stem response was absent,   and no blood flowed through her brain. Her eyes were lubricated to prevent   drying and then taped shut.&nbsp;    Additionally, she was under deep anesthesia.[v]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon waking,   however, Pam was able to describe with complete accuracy the entire procedure,   the surgical instruments used, detailed conversations of the medical team, and a   song playing on the radio during her surgery. She later concluded,

    &nbsp;  When I came “back”   and I was still deeply under general anesthesia, they were playing “Hotel   California”, and the line was “You can check out anytime you like, but you can   never leave.” I mentioned later [to the assisting surgeon] that was incredibly   insensitive, and he told me I needed to sleep more. When I regained   consciousness, I was still on the respirator. “I think death is an illusion. I   think death is a really nasty bad lie.”      [vi]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dr. Spetzler has   acknowledged:

  ...I find it inconceivable that the normal sense,   such as hearing, let alone the fact that she had clicking devices in each ear,   that there was any way for her to hear those [sounds and conversations] through   normal auditory pathways…I don’t have an explanation for it.&nbsp;   I don’t know how it’s possible for it to happen, considering the   physiological state she was in.[vii]

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   With an essentially “dead” brain   any recall of this or other surgery under general anesthesia is medically   incomprehensible. Skeptics, however, argue vigorously that surgical NDEs are   merely the result of insufficiently administered anesthesia, which medical   literature has termed, “awareness during surgery.” This hypothesis proposes that   those who experience NDEs under general anesthesia may only  appear to be unconsciousness and thus   able to ‘imaginatively reconstruct’ surgical events. The strongest proponent of   this model is British psychologist Susan Blackmore. She maintains:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   So what kinds of information can we pick up from what we hear?&nbsp;   Speech is probably the most important. The surgeon may issue instructions   for the resuscitation, ask for instruments to be passed, or even start chatting   to other people present; nurses may confer over procedures, check doses…or even   pronounce the patient close to death.&nbsp;   Potentially, any of this may be heard by the patient.&nbsp;   Although patients appear to be unconscious, they may retain residual   hearing, and thus, be aware of events happening around them. Through this   information, they are able to construct a convincing and realistic impression of   what was occurring during surgery and believe they have experienced a NDE.[viii]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Blackmore’s   postulation allows for primarily auditory, not visual perception while   anesthetized. NDEs that occur under general anesthesia, however, are both visual  and auditory in nature. Non-materialists challenge Blackmore’s   hypothesis on several levels.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  First, awareness   under general anesthesia is extraordinarily rare. According to Long and Perry   “only one to three patients in one thousand experience anesthetic awareness.”[ix]     The Journal of Anesthesia and Analgesia defines anesthetic   awareness, also known as unintended intra-operational anesthesia, as a “rare   event when a patient under general anesthesia becomes conscious during surgery,   but can’t move or talk because paralytics are in effect”.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Secondly, those   who awaken during surgery describe their experience as painful, terrifying, and   confusing.&nbsp;  This is contrary to NDErs   who, nearly universally, describe their encounter as joyful, loving, and   immensely peaceful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This author   explains her own personal experience with anesthetic awareness:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   My nose was broken badly during a traumatic sports injury. I required   Rhinoplasty to reconstruct it-a surgical procedure which necessitated general   anesthesia. I awakened at some point during surgery. I wasn’t groggy, ‘out of   it’, ‘reconstructing memories’, or dreaming. I knew exactly where I was and what   was happening to me. The overhead lights were shining in my eyes. I could see 2   nurses by the side of the table wearing green scrubs. The surgeon was standing   directly over me, with what appeared to be a scalpel in his hand. I was   terrified. I could see everything, hear every word being said, yet was   completely paralyzed.&nbsp;  When the   surgeon saw that I was conscious, he yelled, “She’s awake!&nbsp;   Get the gas NOW”. I could see the panic on his face. I thought to myself,   he’s almost as frightened as I am. Then everything went black. In no way did the   incident resembled any aspect of a   NDE, nor could it possibly be confused with one.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Furthermore,   numerous procedures are intentionally performed under lighter sedation.&nbsp;   According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists,

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   …certain procedures, however, do increase the risk of surgical   [anesthetic] awareness, such as procedures performed under local or regional   anesthesia with modest levels of sedation. In these circumstances,  deep unconsciousness is not intended,   and patients will predictably have varying levels of recall of events and   surroundings.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, those   who experience anesthetic awareness do not report out-of-body experiences.   However, NDEs which occur under general anesthesia frequently report   observations of the surgery from above their bodies. As Long explains:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When near-death experiences occur during general anesthesia, there are   often OBE observations of the operation. NDErs typically see their own   resuscitation taking place on the operating table. These near-death experiencers   are not seeing themselves with too little anesthesia; they are seeing themselves   coding     [x]    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  NDEs which occur   under general anesthesia provide especially compelling evidence supporting the   validity of both the experience itself and continuity of consciousness after   life.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Van lommel   concludes:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         When patients report   memories of their operation…we should not dismiss this as mere fantasy or   question the amount of anesthetic administered…but instead seriously consider   the possibility of an NDE[xi]
