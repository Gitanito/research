I didn't feel or hear anything.

Then I was sitting next to my recently deceased son. It was really bright. I had a feeling of instant pain, then nothing. I saw my life, and I questioned my existence here and wondered about my daughter too. My son asked me in a calm voice, (he seemed to be really at peace, too.) 'What are you going to do? Are you going to come with me, or not?'

I went with him and found myself sitting in a church with him. My head was bowed, and he was praying with me. (Note: In life, my son had not been a very religious man.) Then I woke up in an ambulance and he was still there with me. I fell back into unconsciousness and the next thing I knew, I woke up in the hospital. I don't remember any paramedics or other medical people. I do remember my father wetting me with water and slapping me. I don't remember anything else at all.
