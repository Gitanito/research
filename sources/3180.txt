proofreading and making corrections; to E. Myron Clymer
for the excellent typography, and lastly, but by no means

the Art is nothing but "Nature acting through man, that man
may attain 'man's highest estate.'"

the perfection, or unity which is A STATE OF THE SOUL; an
attained CONDITION OK BEING; resulting from effort, by faith in
a set purpose of the Art. It is BEING. It is FEELING. It is SENS-

state of being is a development of the unconscious, spiritual
nature, deeply hidden in the innermost being; in the "TRUE

Teacher-Initiate, Madathanas.
This development results from a process of thinking and
acting, by means of which all that is carnal or evil in
man's nature is changed, i.e., Alchemically transmuted into the

is brought into unity with himself, i.e., when he unifies, central-
izes, directs and controls his every act by means of the har-
monious activity of his ennobled intelligence and developed
Will, he is at the threshold of spiritual knowledge which will
lead him gradually to a transcendent unity with the Cosmic
Law, called the perfection of the totality of nature. That which
is called "the Absolute," the "Absolute perfection," the "Per-
fection of Nature," "Harmony with the Cosmic Law or Will,"
i.e., God, are one and the same thing.
Following the perfect formula of the Initiate Alchemist, as
the modern chemist does his symbolic figures, the Neophyte
will come to understand that sulphur signifies Nature, and

x PREFACE
the work of Alchemy is man's conscience, once it is fully
awakened, and is designated by a thousand seemingly mis-
leading and incongruous tenilS. By means of this instrument or
agent, quickened into vital activity under a sense of the eternal
presence of God, by whatever name known, the stone, i.e., man,
is, in the beginning, purged and purified, to make possible the
full realization of this truth.
One of the numerous tenilS used by the Alchemists to
designate man's conscience, or inner guide and monitor, is
that of the middle substance which partakes of an azurine
sulphur; of the nature of a celestial spirit; the Cosmic spirit of
God. This is the "still small Voice" in Alchemy, as it is in
Scriptural writings. It can be compared to a fire, which alone
is potent to purify and separate, preparing the way for the
Light, THE OBJECT SOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE GRF.AT WORK, and
which becomes, or makes itself, manifest.
The one subject of the Alchemist is intellectually known
under the theological name of spiritual REgeneration. This is
a promised reward of God to man for effort made, the Al-
chemist himself investigated as a work of Nature, to be dis-
coverable within Nature (himself).
The repentance, which in religious inculcations is said to
begin conversion, is the "Philosophic contrition," of Hermetic
allegory, and is a work to be performed, not a mere acceptance
by, or in, faith, as an article or belief. This actual philosophical
contrition is the first step towards the discovery of man's whole
(Soul) being, and is frequently mentioned as the black (evil,
carnal) of the matter (man), in which is carried on the work
of dissolution, calcination, refination, purification, separation,
during the proc~ of which the black will manifest the red
(the process of transmutation) and finally turn white (become
spiritualized).
The evolution of the glorious and red state finally results
in the fixation (making certain) of perfection, and during this
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLfc xi
period, the Soul coming into consciousness, has attained One-
ness with the Cosmic Soul—God.
If the reader has followed us through thus far and compre-
hends in part or whole what is here written, he will be able to
more readily understand what is to follow.
It can be said with truth, without rancour or the possibility
of successful contradiction, that a grave error has existed for a
long time, and has become a part of practically all literature
dealing with the Rosy Cross and its various appellations.
The public is greatly confused and finds it almost impossible
to place a correct meaning on the terms "Mysticism," "Occult-
ism," "the Rosy Cross" and "Rosicrucians."
This is especially true in the Americas. Due to this con-
fusion and misapplication of terms, acknowledgly great and
well known writers, who lived and labored during the seven-
teenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and thus far in the twentieth
centuries, have often been thought of, or accepted as of the
ROSY CROSS, and every effort made by the various authors to
connect them with the Fraternitas.
Among these men so accepted, to name but a few, were the
German Mystics; Master Eckhardt, Tauler, Merswin, Arnold
of Bresica, Abalard, Raimund of Subunda, Bohme, Thomas
Munizier and a multitude of other great leaders of the religious
renaissance. While the Rosy Cross would be proud to number
these men among its Initiates, their doctrine was the opposite
in many respects, often diametrically opposed to that of the
Fraternitas of the Rosy Cross as can be explained in a very few
words:
The Rosy Cross taught, and continues to teach, THAT MAN
is AN EMBRYONIC GOD (yea, "these are the sons of God"); THAT

period, the Soul coming into consciousn~, has attained One-
n~ with the Cosmic Soul-God.
If the reader has followed us through thus far and compre-
hends in part or whole what is here written, he will be able to
more readily understand what is to follow.
It can be said with truth, without rancour or the possibility
of successful contradiction, that a grave error has existed for a
long time, and has become a part of practically all literature
dealing with the Rosy Cross and its various appellations.
The public is greatly confused and finds it almost impossible
to place a correct meaning on the terms "Mysticism," "Occult-
ism," "the Rosy Cross" and "Rosicrucians."
This is especially true in the Americas. Due to this con-
fusion and misapplication of terms, acknowledgly great and
well known writers, who lived and labored during the seven-
teenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and thus far in the twentieth
centuries, have often been thought of, or accepted as of the
Rosy CRoss, and every effort made by the various authors to
connect them with the Fraternitas.
Among these men so accepted, to name but a few, were the
German Mvstics; Master Eckhardt, Tauler, Merswin, Arnold
of Bresica, ·Abalard, Raimund of Subunda, Bohme, Thomas
Munizier and a multitude of other great leaders of the religious
renaissance. While the Rosy Cross would be proud to number
these men among its Initiates, their doctrine was the opposite
in many respects, often diametrically opposed to that of the
Fraternitas of the Rosy Cross as can be explained in a very few
words:
The Rosy Cross taught, and continues to teach, THAT MAN
IS AN EMBRYONIC GOD (yea, "these are the sons of God"); THAT
HE HAS WITHIN HIMSELF ALL THE ATIRIBUTES, ALL THE POSSIBILI-
TIES, ALL THE POTENTIALITIES OF AGOD; THAT HE HAS THE RIGHT,
THE OPPORTUNITY, TO BRING THESE POTENTIALITIES INTO MAN-
IFESTATION AND BECOME INDIVIDUALIZED, A GOD IN MINIATURE;
xii PREFACE
A MICROCOSM OF THE MACROCOSM; SOUL CONSCIOUS AND GoD-
LIKE, IN TRUTH AND FACT, A SON OF GOD, OR AFTER THE PATTERN
OF GOD.
Mysticism, on the other hand, teaches the desirability and
the possibility of becoming, first a "Friend of God," and ulti-
mately fuse with, and a part of God, with the loss, first, of the
personality, and finally, the individuality. Rosicrucianism
makes prominent the desirability of transmuting the personality
into the individuality; it glorifies; raises up, individuality; while
Mysticism tends away from individualization and the loss of
personality in God. Because of this confusion of terms, the
Rosy Cross, in the eyes of the masses, lost its vital character
and came to be considered as a mere vehicle for Mysticism.
This was further enhanced by the confusion of the terms
"Rosy CROSS" and "ROSICRUCIAN."
Of the thousands who have studied modern (charlatan)
Rosicrucian texts and sincerely believe themselves to be of the
ROSY CROSS, it is safe to say that not one in a hundred has any
knowledge of the written word of the FAMA, much less of its
spirit or Arcane interpretation, yet this FAMA is the foundation
of the Fraternity; moreover, and regrettably, an even less num-
ber have an understanding of the real meaning of ROSY CROSS
and ROSICRUCIAN.
With the intent of conveying to our readers a clearer under-
standing of the difference in the meaning of these terms, as
understood by Continental Occultists, we have selected ex-
tracts dealing with this subject from the writings of a number
of French authors and have made use of these as an Introduc-
tion to the present work.1
These texts have been literally translated for this express
purpose by one with a thorough knowledge of both the French
language and the meaning of the terms used; then liberally
interpreted by the help of the "key" placed in our possession.

weaknesses of the flesh and the strength there is in the spirit,
i.e., the Soul of men, to overcome this weakness; rising above
it sufficiently to bring the Fire or Light of the Soul into mani-
festation.
Lully clarified, though he did not reveal, the work of RE-
generation merely hinted at by de Meung in his Romance of
the Rose. Another, Nicholas Flamel, was soon to follow, and
he by his accomplishments, by the help of the first woman
Philosophic Initiate in the records, would demonstrate the
REgeneration of man by Arcane or alchemical means.
Lully illustrated the truth in his allegory, that the way of the
flesh is after all flesh; that though man might find and use the
Elixir vit<e for physical rejuvenation, it would defeat its own
ends because it would be at the expense of the Immortal spirit;
that it is far better to let the flesh follow after the flesh and at
the proper time give up, or exchange, the old, for a new and
better vehicle to carry forward the Great Work, than to
remain youthful and beautiful in form, but miss the Light of
the Soul.
He further made plain that however great an Initiate's attain-
ment, the end of mortal life is by means of some form of
weakness, i.e., disease, because there must be an excuse by
Nature to retire the old structure in order to release the
"mortal which has attained to Immortality," that it may enter
upon the next state or phase of its existence or activity; that
the change, or death, so-called, is not necessarily so because of
evils committed. Suffering may be part of this change because
the flesh is weak. It cannot comprehend the Light and it
naturally fights for its own existence, though such continued
existence is not best for the Immortal spirit.

i.e., the Soul of men, to overcome this weakness; rising above
it sufficiently to bring the Fire or Light of the Soul into mani-
festation.
Lully clarified, though he did not reveal, the work of RE-
generation merely hinted at by de Meung in his Romance of
the Rose. Another, Nicholas Flame!, was soon to follow, and
he by his accomplishments, by the help of the first woman
Philosophic Initiate in the records, would demonstrate the
REgeneration of man by Arcane or al<;hemical means.
Lully illustrated the truth in his allegory, that the way of the
flesh is after all flesh; that though man might find and use the
Elixir vitte for physical rejuvenation, it would defeat its own
ends because it would be at the expense of the Immortal spirit;
that it is far better to let the flesh follow after the flesh and at
the proper time give up, or exchange, the old, for a new and
better vehicle to carry forward the Great Work, than to
remain youthful and beautiful in form, but miss the Light of
the Soul.
He further made plain that however great an Initiate>s attain-
ment, the end of mortal life is by means of some form of
weakness, i.e., disease, because there must be an excuse by
Nature to retire the old structure in order to release the
''mortal which has attained to Immortality," that it may enter

the change, or death, so-called, is not necessarily so because of

the flesh is weak. It cannot comprehend the Light and it

Lully had as his contemporaries such other Initiates as"Arnold
de Villanova who, though he fulfilled his part in the Arcane
Drama, was a somewhat lesser light. Others who followed
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLffi xv
were Alain of Lisle, Monk Ferrarius and Bonus, and Johannes
de Rupecissa.
Eliphas Levi, later to become Supreme Grand Master of the
Fraternhas of Europe, spoke of Lully as "a grand and sublime
adept of the Hermetic Science," i.e., an Hermetic Initiate who
had attained to Philosophic Initiation.
Next in the pageant of those who travelled the path of
Initiation, came Nicholas Flamel, Hermetic Initiate, Master of
the Great Arcanum, member of UOrdre du Lis, who, with
the help of his wife Parrenelle, found the solution of the
Arcanum of REgeneration and laid bare its secrets. Here was
a truly great Initiate, one to be compared to Jean de Meung,
who had unraveled the same mystery and told the same story
in different words.
These were the men who carried the tradition forward and
prepared it for a more general concept.
Flamel was to the Brethren of Light of the fourteenth cen-
tury that which Jean de Meung had been to them in the
thirteenth century, but it was his mission to go a step farther;
to advance the Mysteries of the Arcanum enough so that those
who were to follow him would find it easier to take up and
carry on the Drama of the Arcanum by showing them that
"mortality might truly take on Immortality."
Nicholas Flamel was followed by Basil Valentine, whom we
have rightly designated a pre-Rosicrucian Initiate, because the
Arcane work had now assumed a radically different complexion.
The Initiates of the various Orders and Fraternities felt a
new impetus; they recognized that "coming events cast their
shadow before them." They could see this shadow and had a
concept of what was to follow.
The desire for communion and companionship in a single
unit had gained in strength and they planned for union, though
as yet they did not have a full conception of what this was to

be like. Now there was an effort, feeble at first, to bring all
Philosophic Initiates into one fold, and as this finally was con-
summated in the Fraternitas we shall thenceforth know these
Brethren as pre-Rosicrucian Initiates.
All who were active in this direction were members of the
World Council. The first of these was Basil Valentine and in
the background, urging them on, was the sublime UOrdre du
Lis in France, and the Order of the Rose in England, to which
none but fully attained Philosophic Initiates were invited; an
honor which was a constant urge to all Neophytes to make
greater effort. There was over them the shadow of the Im-
mortals, Jean de Meung and Nicholas Flamel, and the Arcanums
they had left to the Brethren of Light for their guidance.
Valentine's greatest contribution to the Great Work was the
story of his long and almost heartbreaking search for the
Mystery, and his final success in attaining Philosophic Initia-
tion. This, like so many of the contributions made to the
literature of the Brethren of Light, is in the form of a story
which, as with others of like nature, we have liberally inter-
preted with the help of the "key" furnished us so that all may
profit.
Valentine had as his contemporaries and co-Initiates, Isaac
of Holland and his son, and the "good" Trevisan as well as the
English Philosophic Initiates, Norton and Ripley. All of these
did their full part to advance the literature of the Arcanum and
to further the efforts of all engaged in bringing about an uni-
versal Confederation. These are given full credit in the secret
records of the Fraternity. They contributed much time and
labor and each added a link in the spiritual chain.
Bernard Trevisan's part in the great effort toward the uni-
fication of all Arcane teachings was recognized and appreciated
by all who sought the ultimate of Philosophic Initiation. Of
him it was said that he was a living example of the work he
espoused. This was so well understood that he was known by

all as the "good" Trevisan. Hitchcock, centuries later, con-
sidered the teachings of Trevisan as worthy of special con-
sideration and our interpretation is recommended as of great
importance in helping Neophytes to a fuller understanding of
the Arcane teachings.
Thomas Norton and George Ripley, contemporaries of both
Valentine and the good Trevisan, were to England all that
the others were to the rest of Europe. Both attained to full
Philosophic Initiation. Both were active members of the World
Council for the establishment of a Confederation of the Initi-
ates of the Arcane schools. Both wrote on Alchemical and
Arcane subjects in verse, much after the fashion of Jean de
Meung in his Romance of the Rose, and both were members
of the Order of the Rose.
A later great Initiate, Eugenius Philalethes, of whom more
will be said in the proper place, recognized both these Initiate
brethren for their work, but reserved special consideration for
Ripley's writings. Ripley was given less to the use of the
jargon of the Alchemists in writing than those preceding him
and is more readily understood.
Next, and one of the truly great Souls; Counsellor, Friend,
Guide and Instructor to more Acolytes than any other man
before the consummation of the Fraternitas, was John Tri-
themius. Immortals like Paracelsus were instructed by him, and
so was Agrippa, who in turn guided Paracelsus through his
final Initiation. Here was a man, lowly born, who, by self-
effort, not only himself reached the highest spiritual peak of
Philosophic Initiation, but in turn helped others to become
equally as spiritually or Cosmic Conscious. Little wonder that
Paracelsus called him his "spiritual Father," for this he cer-
tainly was, not alone to Paracelsus but also to many others
whom he instructed in all of the Arcane sciences, helping them
to become Brethren of the Light.

Agrippa travelled considerably, studying in Paris and there

He was made a member of the L 'Ordre du Lis while living in

the greater number of other Philosophic Initiates of his time
because his works have been published in English and long
open to students. Moreover, they are more readily interpreted
than many of the writings of others of the Brethren of Light.
Agrippa was a strong link in the chain which finally became
the Fraternitas and is honored accordingly.
Following the Immortals, John Trithemius and Cornelius
Agrippa, the Arcane panorama changes completely. John
Trithemius was bom in 1462, and Cornelius Agrippa in 1486.
Paracelsus was born Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombast,
of Hohenheim, in 1493. Here was the trio who were to become
the reformers of Science, Religion and Medicine and bring
greater freedom to man. Trithemius as a teacher, guide and
friend, Agrippa and Paracelsus as active reformers in their
respective field. Though these three lived at one and the same
time, it may be said that Trithemius was to be the foundation
stone of the World's greatest Spiritual structure; Agrippa was
a co-worker with him, carrying forward the work where
Trithemius left off, while Paracelsus, the final product; the

Nettesheim already mentioned. Agrippa was a philosopher,
physician, theologian, statesman, teacher and author. He was
clear seeing and clear thinking. At a glance he saw the shams

Today we would call him an iconoclast. He was fearless in

Agrippa travelled considerably, studying in Paris and there

He was made a member of the L 'Ordre du Lis while living in
Paris and attending the University for the study of medicine.
Later, when in London, he was made a member of the Order of

the greater number of other Pbilosophic Initiates of his time
because his works have been published in English and long

than many of the writings of others of the Brethren of Light.
Agrippa was a strong link in the chain which finally became
the Fraternitas and is honored accordingly.
Following the Immortals, John Trithemius and Cornelius
Agrippa, the Arcane panorama changes completely. John
Trithemius was born in 1462, and Cornelius Agrippa in 1486.
Paracelsus was born Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombast,
of Hohenheim, in 1493. Here was the trio who were to become
the reformers of Science, Religion and Medicine and bring
greater freedom to man. Trithemius as a teacher, guide and
friend, Agrippa and Paracelsus as active reformers in their
respective field. Though these three lived at one and the same
time, it may be said that Trithemius was to be the foundation
stone of the World's greatest Spiritual structure; Agrippa was
a co-worker with him, carrying forward the work where
Trithemius left off, while Paracelsus, the final product; the

The records of the Fraternitas are a proof of this, but many
will read this work who are neither Acolytes nor Initiates of
the August Fraternity. To help these understand we have
drawn a parallel in juxtaposition between the lives, travels and
experiences of the Legendary Father C.'. R.'. C.'. and Par-
acelsus. This is followed immediately by the FAMA of
Paracelsus, wherein is given an outline of his most important
teachings. In this "Fama," as throughout the entire work, our
quotations are not literal, but interpretations based on the
"key" furnished by the record itself. We feel that the Par-
allelism and the Fama are self-explanatory and need no further
explanation except the positive statement that the records of
the Fraternitas make it clear and beyond contradiction that
Paracelsus was the Father C.'. R.'. C.'. of the Confederation
which later became the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis and continues
to be such unto this day.
Another link in this chain, one contemporaneous with
Agrippa, though far less known, was Giacomo Picus de
Mirendola. Mirendola differed somewhat from many of his
fellow Initiates in that he belonged to the Kabbalistic school
of Initiates and is known chiefly for the influence he exerted
upon Paracelsus. It was through the interpretation of his
writings by Trithemius that Paracelsus became the great Kab-
balist he was. In the classification with Mirendola also were
such men as Reuchlin and Bovillus and then followed /Egidius
Gutmann.
Gutmann was an Hermetic, Christian Initiate. He differed
somewhat from Mirendola, but with Valentine Weigel and
Simon Studion, played an important part in the formation of

gelica into whose Fama, the Naometria, were incorporated
many of the Laws taught by Gutmann and accepted by Valen-

The records of the Fraternitas are a proof of this, but many

in 1614.
At this time Jean Braccesco was also active. Braccesco was
an Alchemic, Hermetic Initiate of the Italian School of Miren-

to the same classification as Jean de Meung, Nicholas Flamel
and Raymond Lully. In their writings they taught the same
Arcanum of REgeneration and those who have "eyes to see"
will find the one thread of the Mystery running through all
of their teachings.
Braccesco's Tree of Life, or Wood of Life reveals, in Al-
chemic jargon, the method to follow whereby the Acolyte will
attain Philosophic Initiation, full REgeneration and become a
Philosopher of Fire; at the same time he even indicates the
length of time frequently required to accomplish the Great
Work. We have endeavored to interpret his instructions in the
language of the day, though we have not divulged the means.
In Braccesco's eyes, the cardinal sin of which Acolytes are so
frequently guilty, and which dooms them to failure in the

many trials. He was honest in admitting the reasons for many
failures to have been weaknesses within himself which he fre-

their fellow Initiates as "the Three" because all three were
Hermetic, Christian Initiates and members of the World Coun-
cil. Each played his part in the preparation for the formation of
the Confederation of Initiates which became the Fraternitas
in 1614.
At this time Jean Braccesco was also active. Braccesco was
an Alchemic, Hermetic Initiate of the Italian School of Miren-
dola and a member of the ivorld Council. Braccesco belonged
to the same classification as Jean de Meung, Nicholas Flamel

of their teachings.
Braccesco's Tree of Life, or Wood of Life reveals, in Al-
chcmic jargon, the method to follow whereby the Acolyte will
attain Philosophic Initiation, full REgeneration and become a
Philosopher of Fire; at the same time he even indicates the
length of time frequently required to accomplish the Great
Work. We have endeavored to interpret his instructions in the
language of the day, though we have not divulged the means.
In Braccesco's eyes, the cardinal sin of which Acolytes are so
frequently guilty, and which dooms them to failure in the
Great Work, is impatience and Jack of application. These
retard or stultify proper spiritual growth and delay final
success.
Contemporary with Braccesco was Dennis Zachaire, who
finally achieved Philosophic Initiation after a long search and
many trials. He was honest in admitting the reasons for many
failures to have been weaknesses within himself which he fre-
quently permitted to govern his actions. Zachaire was unspar-
ing in condemning himself for his own weaknesses and lack
of continuity in his search for the ultimate. In his writings he
points out that he is an example to other Neophytes of what

not to do. Despite his early failures, Zachaire fulfilled his part
in the Arcane Drama by first attaining to Philosophic Initiation,
then becoming a member of the World Council and helping in
the effort to bring about a world Confederation of Initiates.
Next in line in the Arcane drama was Thomas Charnock of
England. Charnock, as an Acolyte, could not see "eye to eye"
with others on the Path, with the result that he left England for
Germany to seek instructions and guidance. In Germany he
contacted those who had accepted the teachings of Paracelsus,
but chose of these teachings only those which dealt more
directly with the Hermetic and Alchemic Art.
After attaining to Philosophic Initiation, Charnock returned
to England and began the practice of medicine. He had become
a member of the World Council while in Germany and gave a
considerable amount of time to preparing those interested with
him for the time when a Confederation would be established,
with the Initiates of England as members. Charnock was made
a member of the Order of the Rose because of the degree of
Initiation to which he attained and for his efforts in behalf of
establishment of a Confederation.
Charnock is recorded as the first active pre-Rosicrucian
Initiate for the reason that while he accepted the teachings of
the Hermetic and Alchemist Initiates, he combined with them
those of Paracelsus, and herein was the essence of what later
was to be the Fraternitas, though much was yet to be done
before that could be an accomplished fact.
Following Charnock closely, and contemporaneously with
him, was John Fountaine of France, an Alchemic, Hermetic,
pre-Rosicrucian Initiate, who, though not as well known as
many others, nevertheless performed an important duty and
became a strong link in the Arcane chain.
Fountaine may be said to have continued the theme of the
Arcanum of REgeneration first started by Jean de Meung, and
later followed by Flamel and others. For his attainment and

efforts he was made a member of the UOrdre du Lis. His writ-
ings were after the fashion of de Meung. He was a member of
the World Council and tireless in his efforts to bring about a
world Confederation of Initiate Brethren or Brethren of Light.
Next in line, and contemporaneous with Charnock, was
Alexander von Suchten, Swiss-German by birth. Here was an
Alchemic, pre-Rosicrucian Initiate who was to be honored
centuries later by Initiates of the new era, such as Levi of
France and Hitchcock of America.
Alexander von Suchten's contributions to the literature of
true Initiates is highly important and in direct harmony with
the Tree of Life, or Wood of Life of Braccesco, dealing as
they do, with the process of REgeneration or bringing into life
the Tree of Life every Neophyte must bring into being if he
is to become a Philosophic Initiate, a true Rose Cross.
While von Suchten was engaged in the Great Work in
Switzerland and Holland, Nicholas Bernaud, the French Al-
chemist, Hermetic Initiate and member of the World Council
was active in France. Bernaud was of an entirely different type
from that of the other Philosophic Initiates in that he was
frankly and openly engaged among the Initiates of the various
schools, in trying to harmonize their desires for a world Con-
federation. For this purpose he travelled extensively and met
many, if not almost all, of the Initiates and even the Acolytes
engaged in the Great Work. Because of his activity in this
direction he became known among the Brethren as the "Door,"
and through his efforts many entered the "Portals" of the
Confederation then forming.
In Germany, Simon Studion, Mystic Alchemist, Lutheran
convert, Paracelsian enthusiast and member of the World
Council, was occupied in establishing the Militia Crucifera

mystic and occult literature, including the teachings of the
Alchemists and Paracelsians. He had prepared and published
his Naometria, which was to the Militia what the FAMA was
later to be to the Fraternitas Rosae Cructs. In fact, it proved to
be the forerunner of the FAMA and in many respects much
like it.
Meanwhile, Julius Sperber had attained to full Philosophic
Initiation, had become a co-worker with Studion in the estab-
lishment of the Militia Crucifera Evangelica, but, visioning the
future of the Great Work, engaged himself in the preparation
of a text far in advance of the Naometris of the Militia. This
was his famous Echo of the God-Illuminated Brotherhood of
the Venerable order R.'. C.'., which was to have been pub-
lished to the world directly after the issue of the great FAMA
itself, but which, due to the sudden death of Sperber, was
inadvertently published before the FAMA, and has been ever
since a cause of great misunderstanding among the profane
writers on the subjects who have not possessed the true facts.
Sperber was a Christian Initiate of the Studion type, but
with a vision sufficiently clear to comprehend that if the about
to be born Confederation, the Fraternitas, was to be a success
and fulfill its mission, all Initiates of every school would need
work in harmony, one with the other. Because of his open-
mindedness, he was chosen as one of the Co-Founders of the
Fraternitas.
Between Sperber of Germany and Berigard of France, and
co-working with them, was Henry Khunrath of Germany,
member of the World Council; of the Order of the Rose and
co-founder of the Fraternitas, though, unlike the others, he
did not live to enjoy the finale of the formation of the Fra-
ternitas. Khunrath not only attained to full Philosophic Initia-

John Baptista van Helmont, Alchemic Initiate, Member of

the truly great Lights of the Fraternity, and is to be considered
as a second Paracelsus, whom he called his "spiritual" Father.
The works of van Helmont help to clarify the teachings of
Paracelsus on the Microcosm and Macrocosm and therefore are
much less difficult to understand. Van Helmont was the sec-

Initiate, member of the Great Council and Council of Three,
co-worker with the seven brethren. Much mystery surrounded
Monnius in as far as the profane were concerned, though every
move he made was known to Dr. Fludd and Michael Maier.
Peter Mormius was a member of the L 'Ordre du Lis of France
and of the Order of the Rose of England.
Jean D 'Aspagnet, another great Philosophic Initiate whose
life was a mystery to the profane as also to the many non-
Initiates who have written much about him, was a co-founder

of the Fraternitas from France, a member of the World Coun-
cil; of the L 'Ordre du Lis, one of the seven Brethren present
at the formation of the Fraternitas and the first Grand Master
of the Fraternitas for France.
D 'Aspagnet was personally known to both Dr. Fludd and
Michael Maier, a considerable time before the formation of the
Fraternitas. He was an Initiate after the order of the "good"
Trevisan and Lully and was fully conversant with the Arcamem
of REgeneration of Flamel and Lully. This was the reason for
both the mystery surrounding him and his greatness.
Finally we come to the four great corner stones of the
building of the Sancti Spiritus, i.e., The House of the Sanctified
Spirit, or, the Spirit (Soul) made whole (Holy), of which Jean
D 'Aspagnet was the apex.
These, Illuminated Souls, Philosophic Initiates, according to
the year of their birth, were:
Michael Maier, born 1568.
Robert Fludd, born 1574.
Henricus Madathanas, born 1575.
John Valentine Andrae, born 1586.
Michael Maier, Physician, Nobleman, Alchemic Initiate, Mas-

the first Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas, a member
of the World or Great Council and a member of the Council of
Three for Germany. He also was a member of the L ''Ordre du

The term Rose Cross is properly the designation of a degree
of spiritual or Philosophic Initiation. It has nothing whatever
to do with Rose Croix, a ritualistic degree conferred in many
different Rites of Free Masonry. The true Rose Cross is attain-
able only by those who are Neophytes in the Rosicrucian Fra-
ternity of Arcane foundation. It represents what one might
correctly designate as the perfection of the human being—the
ultimate of man—the goal of Initiation into the "Lesser Mys-
teries."
It is necessary to recognize the fact that the Rose Cross desig-
nation, linked expressly to the usage of certain symbolism, has
been used legitimately only under certain circumstances deter-
mined by time and place, outside of which it would be incor-
rect to apply it. One may state in truth that those who pos-

Cross under the circumstances, or for historical reasons, as they
are able to appear under aspects in keeping with traditions and
requirements.

The distinction is far from reducing itself to a simple ques-
tion of terminology, as one might be led to believe, but instead,

unified association. The name, or signonum, could not be taken
from the symbol and was not applied to any initiatory degree
except, and until, starting with the fourteenth century, follow-
ing the vicious acts engaged in by church and state.
The Rose Cross designation is therefore applied only in rela-
tion to a certain traditional form, that of Christian esotericism,
or, perhaps one should say with greater percision, that of
Christian Hermeticism.
This Hermeticism represents a knowledge of Cosmological
order, corresponding exactly to proper Initiation into the
"Lesser Mysteries" by means of spiritual, not intellectual or
ritualistic attainment.
Under these circumstances the sign of the Rose Cross marks
the finale, by figuring the reintegration of the being to the
center of the human state, and the full extension of its indi-
vidual possibilities emanating from this center.
This Hermeticism, of Greco-Egyptian origin, as its name
indicates, was incorporated at the same time with Christic
Esotericism and with Islamic Esotericism, in such a manner as
to become an essential part one of the other.1
'The Rosy Cross has never been considered as a strictly Christian
society in the narrow sense of that term. It is assuredly Christic in prin-

belief known. It could not possibly be dogmatic in the sense that its
adherents as a whole accepted the tenets of the orthodox Christian church;
nevertheless, and in seeming contradiction to this statement, its members
as a whole accepted the Christic concepts; not of the church but of the
Coptic and Gnostic early Fathers. Vaughan, in his Introduction to the
First English edition of the FAMA and CONFESSION, makes this plain:

4 INTRODUCTION
These two traditional forms certainly present, under all
aspects, more resemblances between themselves than with all
the others.
Under the legend of Christian Rosenkreutz and the voyages
attributed to him was that, after the destruction of the Order of
the Temple, the Initiates of Christian Esotericism, stenuning in
great part therefrom, reorganized themselves with the help of
members from other schools of Esotericism, in accord with the
Initiates of Islamic Esotericism, in order to maintain, as far as
possible, the link which had seemingly been broken by the
betrayal and martyrdom of the Templars. This reorgani~tion
had to be carried on in a hidden manner, more or less invisible,
and seemingly without taking its root in an institution known
in the outer, and which, as such, could not again be betrayed
and destroyed as was the Temple, hence the use of symbolic
nomenclature and spiritual initiatory names.
The true Initiates were properly the inspirers of this reor-
ganization. They alone were the possessors of the Initiatory
degree or attainment already mentioned. So successful were
these brethren that to all appearance the traditional link was
broken for the Western world and the profane, and would-be
seekers for admittance were led to believe that the Rose Cross
had retired to the Orient. This led them to believe that there
no longer existed in the West any Initiation allowing one to
attain to this degree, unaware of the fact that the Esotericism of
the Rose Cross had come via the East, and had to continue
received his principles at Damcar in Arabia, as their Fama will instruct
you at large.'
The Rosy Cross, as a "messenger" of the generalissimo of heaven or the
Cosmic Father; being Cosmic, that is, over ALL creatures, cannot possibly
be sectarian and single out any one class because of the designation of
their beliefs or philosophy; but must recognize the individual only to the
degree that he is obedient to the Divine or Cosmic Law. That society or
aggregation of men which lives and labors nearest in conformity to the
Divine decree-the Cosmic Law, is most acceptable, because most in
hannony with the Divine Order.

Westward or cease to exist; the East being decadent spiritually
and unable to retain the Esotericism of the Rose Cross.
As to anyone other than Initiates knowing who were real
Rose Cross, and to state with certainty that such or such a
person was one of them, was simply impossible, due to the fact
that it is a question essentially of a spiritual state or attainment
and not a membership or connection, therefore purely of the
inner, and it would be imprudent to judge according to any
outer signs or pretensions of any description.
In addition to this, by the very reason of the nature of the
role they played, these Rose Cross, unless they held a temporal
position made necessary for the maintenance of links of con-
nection, dared leave no trace in profane history in such a man-
ner that even if their proper names become known, it would
mystify the profane still more.
It was also considered that these names would have only a
very relative value, since the Rose Cross changed them accord-
ing to the country where they sought residence, showing
clearly that they were freed from certain limitations of the
ordinary individual.2
As for those persons whose names became known, notably as
authors of mystical writings, and who were commonly desig-
nated Rose Cross, these in many cases were influences inspired
by the Rose Cross, and served as spokesmen of a sort. Their
standing may be expressed by saying they were merely Rosi-
crucians,8 whether or not they belonged to one of the groups
identified by such a name.
On the contrary, if there be an exception, and if it be acci-
'In the authentic Fraternity only the name of the Grand Master or
Supreme Grand Master is known outside of the inner circle and only
because of his official position. Names of other brethren in offices such
as the Councils, may not be made known to the profane until after their
demise.
* This term as applied here, will later be defined.

only one which he can use or accept; not by virtue of purely
human consideration, such as prudence or humility, but because
his spiritual state constitutes actually an incommunicable secret
which is comprehensible only to those who have likewise
attained.

order [since it does not go beyond the limits of the human
state] as may be expressed by the two terms of Rose Cross and
Rosicrucian; the later being able to designate every aspirant to

if someone has declared himself a Rose Cross or a Cufi, one is
justified in declaring with emphasis that such an one is certainly
not what he pretends to be.
Another negative criticism results from a statement made in
the beginning, i.e., that the individual Rose Cross never formed
an association. If they inspired and invisibly directed certain
associations, which are for that reason known as "Rosicrucian,"
they never took any direct public part therein.
This is contrary to their role and character. If one is known
as having been a member of such an association it may safely
be affirmed that it is not because he himself desired to be known
as such, having done everything possible to remain unknown.
It is moreover to be remarked that those who made them-
selves known under this title were more or less illegitimate, or
at all events, far astray from the original source. The more so
is this true because the associations which were formed later
under the same name could make no claim to the true Rose
Cross, except possibly an ideal, if one may so call it, and not an
authentic or regular affiliation.

8 INTRODUCTION
We do not speak, let it be understood, of contemporary
formations which have nothing more of Rosicrucian than the
name, having received and conceived no trace of the traditional
doctrine, and have simply adopted a symbol which each one
interprets according to his own fancy, for want of knowledge
of its real significance.
There is in the foregoing a point to which we should return
for further consideration. We have said that there was, at the
origin of Rosicrucianism, a collaboration between Initiates of
the two Esotericisms, Christian and Islamic; this collaboration
continued thereafter, the link between the Initiations of the
East and West having never been severed.
The Rosicrucians, disciples more or less direct of the Rose
Cross, are uniquely those who follow the path of Christian
Hermeticism to Interior Illumination.
There can be no Initiatory organization worthy of the name
which has not, at the apex of its Hierarchy, beings, either once
incarnate and become Illumined, or directly descended from
the Great Light, who are beyond the diversity of formal ap-
pearance except to the highest Initiates (Rose Cross). These
could, according to circumstances, appear as Rosicrucians, as
Mutacawwufin, or under still other aspects.
They are the living link between all the traditions, because,
by their consciousness of Unity, they participate effectively in
the great original Tradition, from which all the others are de-
rived by adaptations to times and peoples, and which is ONE
LIKE TRUTH [EXISTENCE] ITSELF.
A DISSERTATION on the Rosicrucian tradition and those who
could justly be called the brethren of the Rose Cross is both
a difficult and a delicate task. It requires all the science and the
skill of the most learned collaborators if the task is to be done
in a gentle and fitting manner.

were, the whole of the oral traditions.

of well-known and venerated names. Unfortunately, nothing
is frequently more misleading. In reality, the designation Rose
Cross attached to, or in connection with a name, proves almost
infallibly that such an one was not really one of those who had
attained, that such an one never reached to the degree of
knowledge essential to becoming one of the brethren, and that
he had never experienced THE UNION IMPLIED BY THE DESIG-
NATION ATTRIBUTED TO HIM. In the attainment of such a union
ALONE is there reason for him to be known as such. This Rose
Cross designation, which is partial to the West, but of which

"Every man possesses of it [Wisdom] that which He has
given him of it, and He has distributed largely to those who

It is because men have attained to this state of consciousness,

the Mystic fire darting its red petals in whirling fires at the
ultimate "center of true being." I have no need to recall the
passage by Gorres relative to the red color, which, he says,

"It is thus that in all times there has been an Inner Assembly,
the Society of the Elect, the Society of those who had the
greater capacity for Light and sought it continuously; and
this Inner Society was called the Inner Sanctuary of the Inner
Church.
"These Elect are always united by the Spirit and by Truth,
and their Chief is the Light [Guide] of the world Himself . . .
the unique Meditator of the human race ... the primitive Light,
the Wisdom, the Media by which alone man can return to God.
"When mankind increased in numbers, his fragility and weak-
nesses made necessary an outer Society which held hidden
within itself the Inner Society, and covered the Spirit and the
Truth by the letter; the truth being released to those seeking
only to the limit to which they were able to receive it. The
danger would have been too great to confide the real Occult
Truth to those incapable of receiving it, therefore the com-
mand: 'Throw not pearls before swine.'
"The outer adoration of God [all things holy] should never
have been forced to separate itself from the inner adoration,
but men were unable to bear the Light and hid their faces from
it Since the weaknesses of mankind leads men to so easily
forget the spirit of the letter, the Spirit of God always spoke,
among all nations, to those who had the capacity, AND THE
DESIRE, for Light, and made use of them as his agents, for MEN
ARE THE AMBASSADORS OF GOD now as they have always been.
"By divine instruments [Soul Illuminated men] the inner
truths were carried among the farthest nations, and modified
symbolically, in accordance with the customs of these nations
and their capacity for culture; their climate and their ability
to receive. These Truths were promoted in such a manner that
the outer forms of all their religions, their cults, their cere-
monies and their holy books in general, had more or less clearly
for their object, the revealment of the inner truths of the
Sanctuary, by which humanity could be led in the later days to

BOOK OF ROSICRUCUE 13
"It is thus that in all times there has been an Inner Assembly,
the Society of the Elect, the Society of those who had the
greater capacity for Light and sought it continuously; and
this Inner Society was called the Inner Sanctuary of the Inner
Church.
"These Elect are always united by the Spirit and by Truth,
and their Chief is the Light [Guide] of the world Himself ...
the unique .Meditator of the human race ... the primitive Light,
the Wisdom, the Media by which alone man can return to God.
"When mankind increased in numbers, his fragility and weak-
nesses made necessary an outer Society which held hidden
within itself the Inner Society, and covered the Spirit and the
Truth by the letter; the truth being released to those seeking
only to the limit to which they were able to receive it. The
danger would have been too great to confide the real Occult
Truth to those incapable of receiving it, therefore the com-
mand: 'Throw not pearls before swine.'
"The outer adoration of God [all things holy} should never
have been forced to separate itself from the inner adoration,
but men were unable to bear the Light and hid their faces from
it. Since the weaknesses of mankind leads men to so easily
forget the spirit of the letter, the Spirit of God always spoke,
among all nations, to those who had the capacity, AND THE
DESIRE, for Light, and made use of them as his agents, for MEN
ARE THE AMBASSADORS OF Goo now as they have always been.
"By divine instruments [Soul Illuminated men] the inner
truths were carried among the farthest nations, and modified
symbolically, in accordance with the customs of these nations
and their capacity for culture; their climate and their ability
to receive. These Truths were promoted in such a manner that
the outer forms of all their religions, their cults, their cere-
monies and their holy books in general, had more or less clearly
for their object, the revealment of the inner truths of the
Sanctuary, by which humanity could be led in the later days to

all-embracing.
"But we approach now the time when the Spirit of Truth
must make the letter a living entity, and the hieroglyphs will
be transformed into real visions and the words into under-
standing.
"Soon ... the holy obscurity of the mysteries will be made
manifest in the brilliance of the greater Truth."
This is the time of which Catherine Emmerich speaks and of
those who must render the Ancient mysteries understandable
to those who truly seek and are ready and willing to be
prepared. If not all of the "last apostles" spoken of by the
Saint, at least one of the three groups will unite itself and the
first ones in the Light; and one of these three groups must cor-
respond to the most "Western" branch of which we here speak
of the Community indicated by Von Eckhartshausen, The
other two groups are able to correspond to the two Eastern
[Southern] and Near Eastern [Near Southern] branches of
the same Community.
"In the last days of the disaster," says the Saint, "I see the
Apostles dispersed in various countries without being in con-
tact one with the other, but all of them receiving the rays of
the Living water. All of them will be engaged in the same
Work, though performing it in a different manner, as becomes
the time and people. There will be nothing special in their
costume, but each will be clothed in the manner of the country
and following the fashion of the day. They will not be a
'peculiar* people other than that though they are amongst the
people, they will not do [evil] as the people do. All of them
will receive from God that which was lost [to others] and
their works will be good.

the universality of the knowledge of a single Truth which is
all-embracing.
"But we approach now the time when the Spirit of Truth
must make the letter a living entity, and the hieroglyphs will
be transformed into real visions and the words into under-
standing.

respond to the most "Western" branch of which we here speak

other two groups are able to correspond to the two Eastern
[Southern] and Near Eastern [Near Southern] branches of
the same Community.
"In the last days of the disaster," says the Saint, "I see the
Apostles dispersed in various countries without being in con-

Von Eckhartshausen further states: "No member can [may]
choose another member; the Spirit of All reserves to itself the
choice.5 All men are called;0 and those called will be chosen if
they have become Mature7 for entrance.
"Each one can [may] seek entrance, and every man who is
in the Inner, can teach the outer to seek entrance. As long as
one is not mature, one does not arrive at the Inner.
"The one who is mature adds himself to the chain, perhaps
often where he believed it the least, and often where he knows
nothing of it himself. There are means whereby to mature
oneself...."
It is clearly pointed out how to know one's part in the
Community.
"Ask not who are those who write to you, but look at the
spirit and not the letter; the thing and not the person," because:
"No egotism, no pride can rule in our retreats."
* "What seekest thou?" The Light! The Neophyte must have one only
desire in his heart and this is for the Light or his own Soul. It is this
sleeping Soul that must be brought into the Light, because in that Light
is contained all that is of benefit to that Soul. SEEK YE THE LIGHT, is the
command. That is why the Initiates are called "The Children, or Breth-
ren, of Light."
* No man can come into this Light except by his own efforts. However
much the Masters would wish to confer the Light upon another, this is
impossible. The search must be made by the Neophyte and this search
(effort) must continue until the Light is found (uncovered) within. It is
then that the Neophyte has come into the Light.
'All men, every living Soul, is given the opportunity to enter the Path
and seek for this Light. All men have free Will; they may accept or
refuse. If they refuse, another incarnation, or perhaps many incarnations
will be necessary before they awaken sufficiently (mentally and are bap-
tized by the water; Spirit) to accept the opportunity.
* "Become Mature," i.e., accept the opportunity to be a chosen one and
follow the Path until the Light is uncovered and brought into manifesta-
tion, i.e., the seeker or Neophyte becomes an Initiate.

will admit that they are R. C, the office being aside the fact.
At the most, one can only be assured that they were, or are, a

All outer Societies exist only so long as the Inner Society
communicates its spirit to them. As soon as the outer Society
attempts to be free from the Inner Society, the Inner Society
withdraws itself and the outer Society, possessing only the
letter, becomes bereft of spiritual light; withers and dies.
These outer Societies, for the time being, are inspired by the
One Society. To fully protect the "One" Society it is essential
to continually observe the work of the outer societies and
reject all who loudly pretend to be attached to the great

The Great Fraternity of the Brothers of Light, by whatever
name one may wish to call it, is retired from the profane and

THE true Rose Cross1 must possess three cardinal virtues.
While these are rarely found combined in one person, they
can be developed by all who truly Will.
1. To be of pure life; virile, strong, but unsullied.
2. To make every effort to penetrate the secrets of Nature.
3. To sacrifice oneself, if necessary, for the good of one's
own development and to help others along the path.
The rose bush full of thorns symbolizes how painful this
development may be, but the beautiful rose in bloom, with its
exquisite fragrance, is the promised reward for success in the
Great Work.
The Language of Signs
The use of signs and of rudimentary symbols appeared with
the dawn of consciousness in humanity. Points, lines, circles,
and especially the Cross (the crossing of two lines), are the
outstanding signs.
There is a correlation between sound, color, Light, the Word
and form. Numerous Occult schoolsl have had the presenti-

Grand Master was a distinct organization having no connection whatever
with the Rosy Cross. Likewise, one may be a member of the Martiniste
Rose Croix yet be in no way connected with the Philosophic Rose Cross
or Fraternitas Rosae Crucis.
Only those who had attained to Philosophic Initiation were acceptable
as members of either the Order of the Rose, or L'Ordre du Lis before
the institution of the Fraternitas and this rule continues to be observed
today.
One may be a Rose Cross without being an Occultist or a member of
an Occult Organization. It is equally true that one may be an Occultist
and belong to Occult organizations yet have no connections whatever
with the Rosy Cross, i.e., The Fraternitas Ros<e Cructs.
These statements have special reference to Occultists, Neophytes and
Initiates in Europe, Central and South America.

One of the Egyptian signs for fire was in the form of a Cross
of which the higher branches terminated in flame. This was
the Oriflamme of the Templars, symbolizing the Soul of those
who had attained, but to the profane it was considered as proof
of their idol worship.
Certain lamps excavated from the ruins of Carthage bore the
Chrism ornamented with three points. Freemasonry adopted
this sign in 1777 to be used after signatures. Initiates of Occult
Fraternities had employed it for specific purposes centuries
before.
Mediaeval coins in large part, bear a cruciform sign, varied
according to the place and the time.
Finally the Orient came forth with the Swastika as a symbol,
using varied forms totalling some forty and made of it its pre-
ferred symbol of life, power and activity. Among the Ameri-
can Indians, the Swastika was one of the most universal symbols.
Leaving the prehistoric behind, and coming to the time of the
Gauls, M. De Mortillet states: "They, the Gauls, choose for
first money the Rouelle [rowel, round], which represented to
them the sacred sign of the Cross, enclosed in a circle."
This was the Symbolic representation of the Way to Life;
and to eternity as indicated by the circle; in truth, a complete
symbolism upon which moderns have not been able to improve,
except by the use of the Cross and the Rose.
Among these same people, the Cross also Ornamented the
arms, the jewels and harness trappings. The Tau is the Cross
which was spread among the Celtic tribes; equally so among
the Berbers and the Touregs.
The letter called "T" is a cross which is like the root of the
twenty two other letters of their alphabet. It is the letter which
creates the sign, the existence of a thing. It implies; / think,
I am thinking.

first money the Rouelle [rowel, round], which represented to
them the sacred sign of the Cross, enclosed in a circle."
This was the Symbolic representation of the Way to Life;
and to eternity as indicated by the circle; in truth, a complete
symbolism upon which moderns have not been able to improve,
except by the use of the Cross and the Rose.
Among these same people, the Cross also Ornamented the
arms, the jewels and harness trappings. The Tau is the Cross
which was spread among the Celtic tribes; equally so among
the Berbers and the Touregs.
The letter called "T" is a cross which is like the root of the
twenty two other letters of their alphabet. It is the letter which
creates the sign, the existence of a thing. It implies; I think,
I am thinking.

THE ROSE: Like the Cross, the Rose is a symbol universal in
time and space. One of the reasons for this is that this flower,
by its perfection, its fragrance, its harmonious form and its
glamour, attracts the attention of everyone, and one meets in
all climes and under all latitudes, varieties of roses, even though
it be but the wild briars in the natural state. Roses of the
hedges and roses of the fields bloom upon the Old and New
world. To this may be added that it is the symbol of Love, the
language of Lovers. Is not God, the god of Love? therefore
what could be more fitting than it should symbolize the
Reeling in the hearts of men through which alone they can
become like unto God, their Creator?
Go where we will, Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, Labrador,
the Carolinas or the Virginias, we will find in each their
varieties of roses. It is the same in Mexico and Brazil, where
they exist more or less native; how long before the discovery
by Columbus no one may say. China, Cochin-China, Japan,
Persia, Georgia, Siberia and even Kamtschatka all have innu-
merable varieties of roses. The deserts of Africa, Abyssinia,
Iceland and Lapland all have their rose bushes.
Europe is foremost; France alone counting innumerable
varieties which, because of the innate love in all men for this
flower, are constantly increased and improved. Love for the
rose is inborn and springs from the inner recesses of being
because its spirit is part of the Soul of man.
The adoption of the rosaceous form is further activated by
Egyptian symbolism, which from time immemorial, employed
the Lotus flower, a form of the rose, as its symbol of the Im-
mortal Soul and the path by which this Immortality might be
attained.
The linked circles of the leaves of both the rose and the
lotus indicate the source of heat, and this heat is life; it is the
energy of the sun made manifest.

Eliphas Levi, speaking of these symbols, tells us:
"First form: Four circles, either concentric or entwined in
one another, with a cross at the center, at the Will of the

The past of the Rose is extensive. In early days it was con-

of Sharon became the symbol of the Nazarene. The Mussul-
mans believe that this flower is born from the sweat of
Mahomet. The Jews covered their High Priest with roses.
The Turks carved them upon their tombs. The Poles threw
them upon the coffins of children at burial. Mark Anthony
commanded that he be covered with roses at his death. At
Catholic festivals rose petals were scattered, and the flowers
applied against the ostensoir.

[young ladies who had obtained a prize for virtuous conduct].
In England, the magistrates rendered justice with a bouquet of
roses in their hand. Transported into Gothic architecture it
became the rosette, the preferred and perfect ornament.

The Romance of the Rose was called

by the equilibrium of the masculine and feminine nature; the

This Rose Arcanum was given its greatest attention, first
by Jean de Meung, then by Nicholas Flame!, and finally by
Madathanas who completed the Arcanznn by adding the fiam-
ing rose to the golden cross.
Thousands of years before, the Egyptian Initiates had their
Crux Amata, a symbol of this same Arcanum. It symbolized
salvation (Philosophic Initiation); Regeneration brought about
by the equilibrium of the masculine and feminine nature; the
staff being the male while the circle was the female. Without
the equalization of the counterparts, there was unbalance, in-
harmony, darkness, and finally death. Through equalization
harmony resulted and the Light was brought to light in the
hearts of men.
The mystery of the handled Cross was as little understood
as is the Arcanum of the Rose.
Centuries later, one Moses solved the same mystery for
himself and innocently accepted it as a fact that the mass of
his people would believe and accept the mystery he unveiled to
them, only to find that "pearls cast before swine are trampled
upon," and that the "Manna of life becomes the poison of death

when abused." Too late he became conscious of the mystery
revealed to Madathanas that:
"... if they [the Initiates and sages—the knowing ones]
had described it in an universally intelligible manner, and
placed it within the reach of every laborer and porter,
it would have been a great theft [evil] and no true
mystery; MOREOVER, MANY EVILS WOULD HAVE ARISEN 8
FROM SUCH A PROFANATION OF THE ARCANUM, which WOuld
also be manifestedly contrary to God's Will."
Then came the Templars, a mighty host of Brethren of Light
whose insignia was the Cross and Flambeau, or the Flaming
Cross. The Philosophic Initiates among the mass understood
the mystery or Arcanum of the Flame, but the mass was yet in
darkness and saw only self benefit and glory; the darkness of
the mass was too great, and the Light was extinguished with
the exception of the few who, still being in possession of the
Light, renounced the sword and:
MADE THE ROSE, THE EMBLEM OF LOVE, THEIR INSIGNIA.
In doing this, they did not forget the meaning of the Cross;
that unless the thorns, part of the bush on which the roses grow,
were overcome, the rose would fade and die. They realized
that only by the transmutation of the thorns (evils within us)
could the rose be immersed in Light.
Dante, from the religious point of view, and Jean de Meung,
from the mystical side, took up the cudgel from here. Jean de
Meung, having solved the Arcanum, proceeded to tell the
history of old France; the mystery of Love as the outgrowth of
affection, and revealed the method for finding the Rose in the
innermost Triangle, there encased in Light, or the Fire of the
1 Moses, great Lawgiver as he was, thought otherwise, he felt that the
"manna" or "bread of life" should be given to all, and almost too late he
learned the folly of this. It was only by the LIFTING of the serpent upon
the Cross, so that it would no longer "drag its tail in the dust" that he
was able to save the remnant of his people.

placed it within the reach of every laborer and porter,
it would have been a great theft [evil] and no true
mystery; MOREOVER, MANY EVILS WOULD HAVE ARISEN a
FROM SUCH A PROFANATION OF THE .ARCANUM, which would
also be manifestedly contrary to God's Will."
Then came the Templars, a mighty host of Brethren of Light
whose insignia was the Cross and Flambeau, or the Flaming
Cross. The Philosophic Initiates among the mass understood
the mystery or Arcanum of the Flame, but the mass was yet in
darkness and saw only self benefit and glory; the darkness of
the mass was too great, and the Light was extinguished with
the exception of the few who, still being in possession of the
Light, renounced the sword and:
MADE THE RosE, THE EMBLEM OF LOVE, THEIR INSIGNIA.
In doing this, they did not forget the meaning of the Cross;
that unless the thorns, part of the bush on which the roses grow,
were overcome, the rose would fade and die. They realized
that only by the transmutation of the thorns (evils within us)
could the rose be immersed in Light.
Dante, from the religious point of view, and Jean de Meung,
from the mystical side, took up the cudgel from here. Jean de
Meung, having solved the Arcanum, proceeded to tell the
history of old France; the mystery of Love as the outgrowth of
affection, and revealed the method for finding the Rose in the
innermost Triangle, there encased in Light, or the Fire of the

"manna" or "bread o life" should be given to all, and almost too late he
learned the folly of this. It was only by the LIFTING of the serpent upon
the Cross, so that it would no longer "drag its tail in the dust" that he
was able to save the remnant of his people.

which he taught the Hermetic Mystery or Arcanum which
made him eligible to become a Knight in the Order of the Rose,

to show, by those who had no knowledge whatever of the

insulted because her beauty had turned the head of a young and
brilliant nobleman. He proposed that Ambrosia should cure her
admirer by a folly as grotesque as his own.
"Meanwhile, Raymond Lully had already written to the
lady to excuse, or rather to accuse himself still further. What

the noblest intention, every thought being centered on a desire
to accomplish the great KEgeneration, when, quite uncon-

attracted to someone unlawfully and, unless well on their
guard, a profane love follows; an attraction that, being irregu-

If we read the name "Ambrosia" either "Soul," or the newly
awakened "Conscience," then we have a perfect understanding
of the behests that follow. The Soul is a woman, a beautiful
woman, because inherently it is perfect. The voice of that
woman within us is the Conscience. When this conscience is
outraged it would speak thus to us and encourage us to follow
the Law; the holy inculcation given us by those who seek to
lead us to Philosophic Initiation, which prohibits profane love
or any thought of it.

till doomsday, but he refused to understand it as such; from

appeared to have forgotten her and to be absorbed only in his
sublime work."

fane lover seeking his Amorata what would she know of the elixir of life?

has been attained, all love is sacred to the Initiate for he has succeeded in
transmuting the profane passion into the love which is an Immortal
existence.
'"Till then live for your wife and your children," i.e., obey the Divine
Law and you will not be guilty of any act that might retard your Soul's
development or bring shame upon anyone, least of all upon the honor
of yourself or of those you profess to love.
'In the use of the terms "alchemist" in the legend we have the further
proof, that the story concerning Lully, was a legend wherein is hidden
the mysteries of the Great Work; that it had nothing whatever to do
with mortal life. Alchemy and the elixir vitae belong wholly to Philo-
sophic Initiation.

34 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
The cavalier had recognized the folly and danger of the
great temptation of giving up honor and responsibility for a
profane love which would lead to degradation and require
many years of toil to regain his first estate; he had accepted the
Soul's behest to obey the Law and keep his Conscience free;
to follow duty even though it demanded denial of carnal desire.
He had moreover, given up all that might interfere with his
quest, and in doing so, had in truth become the ALCHEMIST; he
who should endeavor to change or alchemically transmute all
evil, all carnal desire, all ignoble instincts into that love, which
would become an Immortal existence. He was in fact and act,
an alchemist engaged in the SUBLIME WORK.
"At length, one day, the widow being alone, Raymond Lully
was announced. There entered the apartment a bald and emaci-
ated old man, who held in his hand a phial filled with a bright
and ruddy elixir. He advanced with unsteady steps, seeking her
with his eyes. The object which they sought was before them,6
but he did not recognize her, who in his imagination had re-
mained always young and beautiful."
The Neophyte is in search of the ideal. In the ardour of his
search he entirely forgets the mortal, physical self. In the
imagination, the spiritual sight, the ideal is always beautiful and
can know no age. It is IMMORTAL EXISTENCE. That which at-
tracted the carnal self, the youth of amorous ideas and desires,
grows old, but this is not the ideal which the imagination sees
and seeks.
The legend continues:
"And now, Raymond," continued Ambrosia, "look at me,"
and she unbound her hair, which was white as snow; then loos-
ening the clasp of her robe, she exposed to him her breast,
"'The object they sought" is another key in the allegory or legend.
Profane love was repudiated for the greater Love which is the Soul. Thus
must all Neophytes do if they would become an Alchemist like Lully and
become Philosophic Initiates, Members of the Order of the Rose.

which was almost eaten away by a cancer. "Is it this," she
asked piteously, "which you wish to Immortalize?"
The flesh of man must follow all flesh. The lot of the flesh
is to suffer, to grow old and to be thrown aside. This is the
Law; but the Neophyte has not in mind the Immortalization of
the body, but to bring his original innocent Soul again into
Consciousness so that it will be free from the flesh. The flesh
is the instrument; the Imagination, the artist, the Ideal, the
pattern to follow. It was not the body of Ambrosia that Ray-
mond sought, but the Immortal Soul which, if not degraded, is
always beautiful and cannot know age, though it pass through
all time.
"Then, seeing the consternation of the alchemist, she con-
tinued: 'For thirty years I have loved you, and I would not
doom you to a perpetual prison in the body of an infirm old
man; in your turn, do not condemn me. Spare me this death
which you term life. Let me suffer the change which is neces-
sary before I can live again truly; let us renew our nature with
an eternal youth. I have no wish for your elixir, which pro-
longs only the night of the tomb: I aspire to Immortality.'
'For thirty years we have followed the Law and made effort
to achieve the ultimate: Philosophic Initiation, or Soul Con-
sciousness. Now we have attained the goal, but the years have
left their marks on the physical self. Why should we want
to prolong the life of the body which is now not much more
than a prison, seeing that we have the opportunity to free our-
selves from this which will soon become a tomb, and by mak-
ing the change, be able to truly live again, and start where we
leave off? Having achieved this much, we may now renew our
nature, the real self, with the youth that is eternal, because in
it is God Consciousness. Let us forget the elixir which would
give new life to an old body and prove little less than a tomb
rilled with darkness. Let us seek instead the Light which leads
to full Immortality.'"

mond sought, but the Immortal Soul which, if not degraded, is
always beautiful and cannot know age, though it pass through
all time.
"Then, seeing the consternation of the alchemist, she con-
tinued: 'For thirty years I have loved you, and I would not
doom you to a perpetual prison in the body of an infirm old
man; in your turn, do not condemn me. Spare me this death
which you term life. Let me suffer the change which is neces-
sary before I can live again truly; let us renew our nature with
an eternal youth. I have no wish for your elixir, which pro-
longs only the night of the tomb: I aspire to Immortality.'
'For thirty years we have followed the Law and made effort
to achieve the ultimate: Philosophic Initiation, or Soul Con-
sciousness. Now we have attained the goal, but the years have
left their marks on the physical self. Why should we want
to prolong the life of the body which is now not much more
than a prison, seeing that we have the opportunity to free our-
selves from this which will soon become a tomb, and by mak-
ing the change, be able to tTUly live again, and start where we
leave off? Having achieved this much, we may now renew our
nature, the real self, with the youth that is eternal, because in
it is God Consciousness. Let us forget the elixir which would
give new life to an old body and prove little less than a tomb
filled with darkness. Let us seek instead the Light which leads
to full Immortality.'"

The legend of Lolly's profane love, his labors and his success
is the story of every Neophyte who, like him, listens to
Ambrosia, the Soul, the voice of Conscience, and refuses the
desires of the carnal self.
Lully was the author of a number of books on the subject
of alchemy, all of them as difficult of interpretation as the
legend of his life and works to which we have given considera-
tion. Levi tells us:
"In his Philosophical Testament, Raymond Lully has set
forth all the principles of this science, but in a veiled manner,
following the practice and indeed the duty of Adepts. He
also composed a Key to the Testament, and finally a Key to the
Key, or, more definitely, a codicil, which is in our opinion the
most important of his writing on alchemy. His principles and
modes of procedure have nothing in common, whether with the
sophistication of pure metals or the separation of alloys. As a
theory, it is in conformity with the principles of Geber, and
as a practice, with those of Arnold de VUlanova; in respect
of doctrine it is in conformity with the most exalted ideals of
the Kabalah. Those earnest minds, who refused to be discour-
aged by the discredit into which ignorance brings the great
things, should study Kabalistically the codicil of Raymond
Lully, if they seek to carry on that research of the absolute
which was followed by the greatest men of genius in the
elderworld.
"A disciple of the great Kabalists, Lully sought to establish
an absolute and universal philosophy by substituting for the
conventional abstractions of systems, a fixed notion of natural
actualities, and by substituting a simple and natural mode of
expression for the ambiguous terms of scholasticism. He con-
demned the definitions of the scholars of his period because
they perpetrated disputes by their inexactitude and amphibol-
ogy. . . . Raymond Lully defined things by their right names

explained the names by etymology. To the question: What is
Man? he would reply that the word, in its general acceptance
signifies the state of being human, but taken in a particular
acceptation, it designates the human personality. What, how-
ever, is this human personality? Originally, it is the personality
which God made by breathing (His) life into a body composed
of earth (humus); literally, it is you, it is I, it is Peter, Paul, and
so on."

Organization. On being informed, in October, 1311, that a
general council would sit in Vienna, he considered it a favor-
able opportunity to appear before the council and demand,
among other things:
"The reduction of all the Military Orders in the Christian
World into a single order, so that living under one religious
rule,6 and inspired with the same deskes, they might all do
battle with the Saracens (evil), and, suppressing all seeds of
jealousy, all SELFISH INTERESTS, by a laudable immolation, with
true Christian piety, seek the delivery of the Holy Place (all
ill-gotten gain) from the hands of the miscreants."
Among Lully's works are the An Magna, part of which was
published in 1702, in Mangetus' Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa;
the Codicillus already mentioned, Vade Mecum, or Cantilena.
Lully died in 1315.
'It matters nothing whether such an organization is of a religious,
political or military nature, the end sought is the same: Freedom of man
from exploitation, irrespective of the nature of the exploitation.

is either legend or in the jargon of the Alchemists. Flamel
himself made certain that this would be so, because his personal
life portrayed the story of the Romance.
Of all the Hermetic or Philosophic Initiates prior to the
Fraternitas, most of whom were monks or preceptors, or phy-
sicians who never married, Jean de Meung and Flamel were of
the very few who had mastered the Great Arcanum of Re-
generation both in theory and by practice. Only few in that
age could understand this part of the Great Work; therefore
the need of extreme secrecy; hiding the Mystery in Alchemical
jargon.
Among the few who did understand this mystery and hinted
at it in his writings was the great Initiate Henricus Madathanas.
In the Preface of his The Golden Age Restored, he states:
"The keys to the ancient Mysteries of the Patriarchs,
Prophets and Sages have always been kept secret. 'For if,'
says Monarcha, in a certain passage, 'they had described
it in an universally intelligible manner and placed it within
the reach of every laborer and porter, it would have been
a great theft, and no true mystery; moreover, many evils
would arise from a profanation of the Arcanum, which
would also be manifestly contrary to God's Will.'"
This we know to be true. The recorded records had in mind
the Science of Regeneration by means of the first matter where
two of the opposite sex were engaged in the Great Work.
Because Flamel's method, though unknown, was felt to be
opposite to that of other Philosophers, he was first considered
as a mystery and then became a legend.
Flamel, as stated, worked as a scrivener. Two things hap-
pened. In the performance of his work he became acquainted
with the writings of Acolytes and Initiates of the various Initia-
tory schools, and while it is true that the real meaning of these

ance with these scripts, to cause him to become deeply inter-
ested in philosophical and alchemical lore. The other important
event was that he fell deeply in love with a young widow who
not only returned his love but became as deeply interested in
the mysteries as he was, and who was anxious to study and
co-operate with him in solving the Arcanum hinted at in many

to many others but thyself it would remain forever unin-

none but thyself will see!"

written in plain language how it happened that he became in-

"As I worked among the documents and manuscripts,
transcribing them, there were those which, though wholly
unintelligible to me at the moment, nevertheless held my
attention. The more I studied them the deeper became
my interest. Gradually as light broke in upon me, I
recognized that they dealt with the first and deepest

widow with whom he fell deeply in love and who loved him in
return. Love gave a new light to the mystery he was seeking to
solve. Within his heart was a song of Life and Light, and
he tells us of this in the form of a prayer:
"The Lord God of my life, who exalts the humble in
spirit out of the most abject dust [Love raises the most
humble to the highest throne, for God is Love], and makes
the heart of such as hope in Him to rejoice, be eternally
praised [where there is love in the heart, there is the vision
of God and through this, all mysteries are solved].
"Who, of his own grace, reveals to the believing [seek-
ing] Souls the springs of His bounty, and subjugates be-
neath their feet the crowns of all earthly felicities and
glories [Love overcometh all things].
"In Him let us always place our confidence, in His Fear
let us place our happiness, and in His mercy the hope and
glory of restoration from our fallen state [by having faith
and obeying His Laws shall man be lifted from the state
of generation to that of REgeneration; the serpent creeping
on its belly shall be raised up upon the uplifted Cross].
"And in our supplications to Him [our efforts to raise
ourselves to Him] let us demonstrate and show our faith
without shame and stand firm as an assurance that it can-
not ever be shaken.
"And Thou, O Lord God Almighty, as Thou, out of Thy
infinite and most desirable goodness, hast condescended to
open the earth and unlock thy Treasures to me [as a
result of my efforts reveal the mysteries to me] Thy poor
and unworthy servant, and hast given unto my possession
the fountain and well-springs of all treasures and riches of
this world [the first water which, transmuted, becomes the
fires of the REgenerated and Immortal Soul, i.e., by which
man becomes a Son of God]."

BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 43
Flamel continues in his praise of God and his goodness for
giving him the means to become one of the Sons of Wisdom
and then confesses and reveals the first source of his knowl-
edge:
". . . though I learned not much Latin, because of the
poverty of my parents, . . . yet by the blessing of God,
I have not wanted an understanding of the books of the
philosophers, but [by diligence and effort] learned them
and attained to a certain kind of knowledge, even of their
hidden secrets.
"For which cause sake there shall not any moment of
my life pass, wherein remembering this so vast a good, I
will not on my bare knees, if the place will permit it, or
otherwise in my heart [never for a moment unconscious
of my blessings], with all the entireness of my affection
[love and devotion to the mysteries], render thanks to this
my most good and precious God."
* * •
"After the death of my parents, I, Nicholas Flamel, made
my living by the art of writing, engrossing inventories,
making up accounts, keeping books, and the like.
"In this course of living there fell by chance into my
hands a gilded book [valuable, arcane], very old and large
[complete], which cost me only two florins [was of small
price]."
Here follows a description of the book which, though of
value, is not important. He then reveals the arcanum to those
who are in the knowledge. This is of a nature similar to the
mystery of Moses raising the serpent upon the Cross during the
days in the wilderness when his people fell into the ways of
shame and degradation:
"Upon the first seventh leaf was depicted: i. A virgin
[a woman of pure estate but ignorant of the Laws of life].

BOOK OF ROSICRUCUE 43
Flamel continues in his praise of God and his goodness for
giving him the means to become one of the Sons of Wisdom
and then confesses and reveals the first source of his knowl-
edge:
". . . though I learned not much Latin, because of the
poverty of my parents, . . . yet by the blessing of God,
I have not wanted an understanding of the books of the
philosophers, but [by diligence and effort] learned them
and attained to a certain kind of knowledge, even of their
hidden secrets.
"For which cause sake there shall not any moment of
my life pass, wherein remembering this so vast a good, I
will not on my bare knees, if the place will permit it, or
otherwise in my heart [never for a moment unconscious
of my blessings], with all the entireness of my affection
[love and devotion to the mysteries], render thanks to this
my most good and precious God."
• • •
"After the death of my parents, I, Nicholas Flame/, made
my living by the art of writing, engrossing inventories,
making up accounts, keeping books, and the like.
"In this course of living there fell by chance into my
hands a gilded book [valuable, arctme}, very old and large
[complete], which cost me only two florins [was of small
price]."
Here follows a description of the book which, though of
value, is not important. He then reveals the arcanum to those
who are in the knowledge. This is of a nature similar to the
mystery of Moses raising the serpent upon the Cross during the
days in the wilderness when his people fell into the ways of
shame and degradation:
"Upon the first seventh leaf was depicted: 1. A virgin
[a woman of pure estate but ignorant of the Laws of life].
44 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
2. A serpent swallowing her up [woman misled as a result
of her ignorance—purity defiled]. On the second seventh,
a serpent crucified [woman by her knowledge bruising the
serpent's head by the heel of her foot—the way of life
changed—the First water lifted up and becoming the Fire
on the altar], and on the last seventh, a desert or wilderness,
in the midst whereof were seen many fair fountains,
whence issued out a number of serpents here and there.
[Man, in his ignorance, wanders during many years in
the wilderness of darkness. It is only at last after his
awakening to the truth, i.e., when the Light appears, that
he recognizes the fountain out of which issues the Waters
of Life and these waters (forces) quaffed become the
uplifted, or serpents of Life.]"
No Hermetic writer, not even Moses, ever gave a clearer
interpretation of the Arcanum of REgeneration than this by
Flamel. Flamel proceeds to give a description, in Alchemic
jargon, of the Work itself and then proceeds to reveal the
Arcanum:
"Having thus obtained this delicate and precious book, I
did nothing else day and night but study it; conceiving
very well all the operations it pointed forth, but wholly
ignorant of the prima materia [first water] with which I
should begin, which made me very sad and discontented.
"My wife, whose name was Perrenelle, whom / loved
equally with myself, and whom I had but lately married,
was mightily concerned for me, and, with many comfort-
ing words, earnestly desired to know how she might
deliver me from this trouble.
"I could no longer keep counsel [secret], but told her
all, shewing her the very book, which, when she saw, she
became as well pleased with it as myself, and with great
delight beheld the admirable cover, the engraving, the

images, and exquisite figures thereof, but understood them
as little as I."
Flamel now describes what he did and how he was mocked
by those he consulted, indicating thereby the many mistakes
he made before he actually was able to enter the true path and
begin to make progress; experiences which all Neophytes of
the Arcanum must pass through unless they are fortunate
enough to have been fully and truly taught. But finally, as a
result of his efforts and travels [experiences] he did succeed
in the Work, and this is described by Flamel:
"He that would see the manner of my arrival [success]
and the joy [satisfaction] of Perrenelle, let him look upon
us two in the city of Paris, upon the door of the chapel of
James of the Boucherie, close by the one side of my house,
where we are both painted, kneeling and giving thanks to
God. For through the grace of God [my faith, my efforts
and my love} it was that I [we] attained to the perfect
knowledge of all I desired.
"... I now had the prima materia, the first principle,
yet not their first preparation, which is a thing most
difficult above all other things in the world; but in the end
I had that also, after a long aberration, and wandering in
a labyrinth of errors for the space of three years [three
years of effort following many mistakes as is natural],
during which period I did nothing but study and search
and labor,. . . praying also continually unto God [having
the one holy desire], and reading attentively in my book.
... At length I found that which I desired, which
I also soon knew by the scent and odor thereof. Hav-
ing this, I soon and easily accomplished the magistery.
. . . This was done in the year of our Lord 1382, January
17, about noon, being Monday, in my house, Perrenelle
only being present."

This gives us the time when the second part of the Great
Work was performed; there was a third, or ultimate, the final
or Third Degree of the Great Work of the Arcane Science.
"I speak it in all truth: I have made it three times [this
is figuratively speaking], with the help of Perrenelle, who
understood it [the operation] as well as myself, because
she assisted me in my operations. And without doubt, if
she had done it alone, she would have brought it to the
same, or fully as great, perfection.
"I was much concerned for a long time lest Perrenelle,
by reason of extreme joy, should not hide her felicity,
which I measured by my own, and lest she should let fall
some words among her relations concerning the great
treasure possessed. . . . But the goodness of the most great
God had not only given and filled me with this blessing,
to give me a chaste and sober wife, but she was also a wise
and prudent woman, not only capable of reason but also
to do what was reasonable, and was more discreet and
secret than most women. Above all, she was exceedingly
religious and devout; and therefore seeing herself without
hope of children, . . . she made it her business, as 1 did,
to think of God and to give ourselves to the works of
charity and mercy [kindness and goodness]."
Had Flamel and his wife been engaged in chemical experi-
ments for the making of material gold, religion and devotion
would have had nothing whatever to do with the "operation,"
nor would the lack of children nor thought of God have had
any influence on such work. Flamel was the second of the
early Alchemists who mentions the help of a woman in the
operation. Overlooking the importance of the woman was in
greater part due to the fact that many of the alchemists, due to
their connections with the church, were not married.

possess the secret of his transmutations but who attributed great
meaning to the various monuments with their figures in a
number of cemeteries. While it is true that these dealt with
the "Operation" of the Great Work, only one of them is of
any great significance and this because it deals directly with the
Arcanum Flamel attempted to reveal to those "imbued by the
Will of God." This describes the Marivaux door of the Church
of St. Jacquesla-Boucherie, where on the left entrance was the
figure of Flamel, kneeling at the feet of St. James, with a Gothic
N upon the pedestal. The Figure of Perrenelle was represented
on the opposite side, kneeling at the feet of St. John, the
pedestal bearing a Gothic P.
Without attempting to reveal the esoteric meaning, let us
point out that in the temples of Initiation of early primitive
Masonry, in Paris, France, there is, on the inside of the meeting
hall, on one side of the door the figure of a man, while on the
other side there is the figure of a woman. These two figures
take the place, and represent to all Masons, the two Masonic
figures in Masonic temples.

Paracelsus was born in 1493, thirty-five years after the demise
of Valentine. It was during his numerous travels after he
first became interested in Alchemy that Paracelsus met mem-
bers of the then World Council and was made familiar with
Valentine's bitterness toward the then current system of
medical practice. Paracelsus also learned about Valentine's
experiments in antimony and other minerals and became a con-

day, and that for their impenitence God's everlasting pun-

and to devote myself to the service of God.
"When I had spent some years at the monastery, I found
that after I had performed my work and my daily devo-

pass in idleness, lest evil thoughts should lead me into new
sins [the devil finds work for idle hands to perform]. I
therefore determined to use it for the study and investiga-
tion of those natural secrets by which God has shadowed
our eternal things [coming events cast their shadows be-
for them]. I read a great many books in our monastery
written in olden times by philosophers who had pursued
the same study,8 and was thereby stimulated to a more
ardent desire of knowing that which they also knew.
'This was written in approximately 1435. One is almost compelled to
believe that he visioned the unspeakable and almost unbelievable evils
committed by man against man during the past six years (1940 to 1946).
These were acts so vile and Soul-stultifying that it is inconceivable
the human mind could possibly plan them.
4 This is the Karmic Law. So long as the Karma of an evil is not will-
ingly paid it is a "lasting punishment hanging over" the guilty person.
This cannot be removed until the debt is fully paid. The words used are
those of the church, the meaning that of the Alchemist.
"To the majority of those engaged in Hermetic-Occult-Arcane study,
who are Protestant by choice, this statement would appear far-fetched.
Speaking from my own personal experience, in 1940, while in one of the
largest cities in South America, I was permitted, by the intercession of the
physician to the Priests and nuns of one of the largest and oldest mon-
asteries in that country, to not only visit but to closely examine the books
of the monastery and was amazed at the great number of volumes dating
far back into the limbo of time, volumes priceless and beyond compare.
I doubt if there was ever published a single volume of the forbidden
science which is not in that library. This is not strange because history
and the records show that before the time of the Fraternitas Rosae
Crucis, almost all of the Adept Masters were found among the monks of
the monasteries, and men like Valentine were not rare.

committed by man against man during the past six years (1940 to 1946).
These were acts so vile and Soul-stultifying that it is inconceivable
the human mind could possibly plan them.
•This is the Karmic Law. So long as the Karma of an evil is not will-
ingly paid it is a "lasting punishment hanging over" the guilty person.
This cannot be removed until the debt is fully paid. The words used are
those of the church, the meaning that of the Alchemist.
•To the majority of those engaged in Hermetic-Occult-Arcane study,
who are Protestant by choice, this statement would appear far-fetched.
Speaking from my own personal experience, in 1940, while in one of the
largest cities in South America, I was permitted, by the intercession of the
physician to the Priests and nuns of one of the largest and oldest mon-
asteries in that country, to not only visit but to closely examine the books
of the monastery and was amazed at the great number of volumes dating
far back into the limbo of time, volumes priceless and beyond compare.
I doubt if there was ever published a single volume of the forbidden
science which is not in that library. This is not strange because history
and the records show that hefore the time of the Fratermtas Rosae
Crucis, almost all of the Adept Masters were found among the monks of
the monasteries, and men like Valentine were not rare.

that he may obtain health [and the fruits of the spirit],

As a second step, which Valentine called "Contemplation,"
he states:
"An accurate, positive or deliberate attention to the

proceed? Whence is it infused? Whence implanted and

depths of things can be conceived in no other way than
by thought in the spirit of man. It is, moreover, of a two-

of abundant cogitations which never proceed to effects,

"Contemplation in its possible aspect is called theory;
it has regard to things which are perceived by sight and
touch, which have a nature formed in time. Such contem-
plation is set to consider how the given nature may be
appropriated and perfected by resolution of itself; how
each body may be caused to put forth from within the
good or evil, venom or medicine which is latent in it;
how destruction and confection may be handled, so that
the pure may be separated from the impure by correct
procedure, apart from sophistical deceits."
Into this may be read the methods of Alchemy and Divine
Alchemy; Chemistry and Alchemy, for that which is within, is
as the thing that is without, both are under the same law. If one
is but slightly versed in Alchemy, is it so difficult to compre-
hend the meaning or reference to "twice-born Mercury"? Is
not Mercury quicksilver? Is it not quicksilver, because it is
never still, never settled, a synonym for mind, and did not St.
John teach us that mind must become awakened, i.e., baptized,
i.e., reborn or twice-born, i.e., born a second time? And did he
not also teach that this mind reborn would then lead us to the
greater birth, that of the spirit, whence, in Alchemical terms,
the mercury would become pure gold, i.e., the Christos be
awakened and the Soul be baptized by the Holy Ghost, i.e.,
with, in, or more correctly, through Fire, the ALL cleanser and
purifier of the Alchemists?
Maier, a Supreme Initiate, a century and a half later, under-
stood well all that Valentine taught, for he himself became a
Philosopher of Fire, a Brother of the Light, and with this
knowledge he published Claves Duodecrm under the name of
Basil Valentine. Spiritually, or perhaps more correctly, Maier,
by Philosophic Initiation, became a fusion of Valentine and
Agrippa; nothing greater can be said of him.

never still, never settled, a synonym for mind, and did not St.
John teach us that mind must become awakened, i.e., baptized,
i.e., reborn or twice-born, i.e., born a second time? And did he
not also teach that this mind reborn would then lead us to the
greater birth, that of the spirit, whence, in Alchemical terms,
the mercury would become pure gold, i.e., the Christos be
awakened and the Soul be baptized by the Holy Ghost, i.e.,
with, in, or more correctly, through Fire, the ALL cleanser and
purifier of the Alchemists?
Maier, a Supreme Initiate, a century and a half later, under-
stood well all that Valentine taught, for he himself became a
Philosopher of Fire, a Brother of the Light, and with this
knowledge he published Ctaves Duodecim under the name of
Basil Valentine. Spirin1ally, or perhaps more correctly, Maier,
by Philosophic Initiation, became a fusion of Valentine and
Agrippa; nothing greater can be said of him.
Valentine followed the Path that is diametrically the opposite

his brethren of the church because he was imprisoned by Pope
Innocent VI.
When Trevisan was forty-six years of age he had, due to
close attention to study and experimentation with metals and
lack of personal care, lost his health, and decided to discontinue
study and confinement for a time, and travel in foreign coun-
tries to seek out and meet those engaged as he had been. During
his immediate travels he visited England, Spain, Scotland, Hol-
land and Germany. Succeeding in regaining at least part of his
health and energy he became imbued anew with the desire
for Arcane knowledge and in his search visited Egypt, Persia,
Palestine and Greece, everywhere finding new leads in the
mysterious science of the Mystery of the Light.

60 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Trevisan has been wholly misunderstood by profane writers
who have not been able, because of lack of Philosophic Initia-
tion, to uncover the thin veil of fantasy and find the real
secret of his life's work. They based their opinion on the
conclusion that he sought gold, rather than that gold, which is
the Illuminated Soul, issuing, Pheonix-like, from the purifying
Fire, as a result of effort, experience and, many times, of great
suffering.
This concept of the profane is hardly understandable, be-
cause in his book he tells plain and easily understood facts,
despite the delusive title, i.e., Opus de Chemica or Natural
philosophy of Metals. The profane writers failed to then rec-
ognize, even as they do now, that man himself is composed of
metals i.e., mineral salts. His Opus is divided in four parts and
these subtitles are not as cryptic as the title itself. They are:
(a) Concerning the founders of the Sacred Science [cer-
tainly chemistry is not a sacred science; seeking for the Soul's
Illumination is a sacred science].
(b) Concerning himself.
(c) Concerning the roots and principles of metals [man, as
said, is composed of metals and water].
(d) Concerning the Practical Work of Alchemy.
He does not say that the practical work is that of Chemistry
or the dealing with crude metals, but of Alchemy, which deals
with the metals which may be so refined as to become Divinity
itself.
These terms used by Trevisan very effectively confused the
profane, even though he tells us that the "sole concern of the
Art is to find a way of escape from 'accursed poverty,' and is to
be loved for that reason." His interpreters forget that to the
Initiate there is no "poverty" as great as lack of wisdom and of
spiritualization. This is the poverty of the Soul; an eternal

attain to these "riches" give unstinted alms, AND THIS SAVES THE
SOUL.
No Philosophic Initiate ever pretended to believe the Soul
could be saved by giving alms, because this is a duty imposed
upon all able to do so and does not reflect spiritual credits. It
is only by doing the WORK; by making spiritual efforts and
bringing the Soul into Christic Consciousness that the Soul
can be saved; become "like unto the gods," or the Father.
That is not all, he tells us this ART has been perpetuated from
age to age [the secrets handed down from Initiate to Initiate]
and that among the custodians were Arnold of Villanova and
Raymond Lully, a statement beyond contradiction.
Initiates are fully aware, though the profane may not be,
that both these men were Hermetists and engaged in the work
or art of Spiritual Alchemization and not in the making of
crude gold, however precious that may appear to the mass.
Philosophic Initiates recognize Trevisan for what he really
was. In the Preface of Rjpley Reviewed, the author frankly
confesses: "For my own part, I have cause to honor Bernard
Trevisan, who is very ingenious, especially in the letter to
Thomas of Bononia, where I seriously confess that / received

achievement.

of Bononia, published in English, London, 1680. He employs
the jargon of the Alchemists as an extract will show:

solution, has attained the secret point of the art, which is

coming of a Brother of Light.

of Isaac and inherited the responsibility of establishing the

HOMAS NORTON was born in Bristol, England, in 1411. His
early life was much after the fashion of the youths of that
day, except that at a very early age he
became interested in the "forbidden"
science and, hearing of George Ripley,
made effort to become Ripley's Neo-
phyte.
In 1436 Ripley was elected to repre-
sent his section in Parliament. His up-
rightness and the high-esteem by which
he was held by his associates reached
the ears of Edward VI, and he was made a member of Edward's
privy council and thereafter frequently served as Ambassador.
Norton was five years older than Ripley. When Norton was
thirty-nine, he succeeded in contacting Ripley. After proving
his sincerity and trustworthiness to Ripley, he was received as
an Acolyte by Ripley and six years after his reception, or when
he was forty-five, he had succeeded in the first part of the
Great Work and became a member of the Brethren of Light,
and was so recorded.
Norton was the author of a work still famous among Philo-
sophic Initiates. This was his Ordinall of Alchemy. This work
is included in Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum,
Ashmole thinking it worthy to become one of the famous col-
lection. Maier, after he became Supreme Grand Master of the

into English and it is included in the Hermetic Museum.

the requirements for the accomplishment of the Work. He
does more; he shows how clearly the Work is a Work of the
Spiritual part of man, the Soul. The Acolyte, to succeed, must
possess seven—the number of Initiation—Virtues. These are
the four cardinal Virtues: Prudence [to speak and act care-
fully]; Temperance; Fortitude [never to give up, no matter
what the odds against one], and Justice [to deal justly, first
with the self, and then with all others], and three theological
virtues: Faith, Hope and Charity:

Eugenius Philalethes, an Englishman, styling himself Citizen of
the World,1 1678, wherein he affirms:
"... a true artist he was, as every one who hath attained
the knowledge in this mystery, can testify." And again:
"For his experience herein he was eminent, yea, his writ-
ings indeed are in my opinion, for the fullness of them,

any that I have yet read or seen, (and) I have seen many."
Ripley's philosophy was summarized by Eugenius based on
Ripley's Epistle to King Edward VI, as:
All things being multipliable by their kind, so may be
metals; all things have in themselves the capacity of trans-
mutation from an imperfect to a perfect state. This, in a
sense, is the theory of evolution, but there is a higher law,
that of directed change, or transmutation by design and by
deliberate effort made. This is the "Art" or Alchemy.
Michael Maier, England's Grand Master of The Rosy Cross,
thought so much of Ripley's works that in 1649 he had pub-
lished Georgii Roplei, Connonici Angli nempe Bridlingroniae

In Philosophers' books therefore who wishes may see,
Our Stone is called the less-world [Microcosm],one and three."
This less-world, or Microcosm, is Man, as has been so fully
explained by many of the Philosophic Initiates. The subject of
the Work therefore is man.

BOOK OF ROSICRUCIJE 73
In Philosophers' books therefore who wishes may see,
Our Stone is called the !~world [Microcosm],one and three."
This less-world, or Microcosm, is Man, as has been so fully
explained by many of the Philosophic Initiates. The subject of
the Work therefore is man.

Eugenius Philalethes, an Englishman, styling himself Citizen
of the World, 1678, catalogs Ripley's teachings in this manner:

Alchemist is to take any one substance and gradually refine it.
By this method of refining, gradually all gross matter is reduced
to the ONE thing and the "seed" is found. This seed is the
Great Secret. The work being MAN, when the refining is com-
pleted, there remains the "seed," or that which first came from
God. This is the Soul become glorified or surrounded by
Light, for the Soul is a Fire which gives off Light.
The assurance for the possibility of a transmutation being
made resides in the certainty that all "metals" being reduced to
their first mercurial matter, which is to say that the first

from God and around which was built the body, that is, the
gross man. This gross man must be refined. This is possible
only if the "mercurial Matter," i.e., constructive mind, can be

so that ultimately man, the subject, becomes man, the son.
Ripley is very plain in informing the seeker that Wisdom is
only for those who are clean of Soul. To be clean of Soul,
requires first of all that the mind be made free from evil
thoughts and desires. This is then followed by a clean heart;
a heart free from the carnal passions which degrade and lastly,
if this cleanliness of mind be constant, if the desires of the
heart be pure, then, in time, through this Alchemy of change,
i.e., transmutation, will these things be reflected upon, and im-
bued IN the Soul, and as the Soul awakens, will Wisdom come.
Since Wisdom is inherent in the Soul, the Soul of the individual
containing within itself all that is good for that Soul, the Soul
will manifest this knowledge as, and to the degree, that the
Soul is brought into Consciousness. This Consciousness, of a
certainty, is not possible unless the Seeker is really sincere in
his desire for knowledge, is ready and willing to free mind,
heart, and body of all that would retard him in his search for
knowledge and is ready to transmute all he is, all he possesses,
by the fire, which BECOMES the Light of the Soul, and which
is then Consciousness or Illumination; is the Light in which
Illumination and all wisdom is contained. This interpretation
is aside of that given by Eugenius who writes clearly and un-
derstandingly, but who is yet of the sixteenth century and
perhaps not as readily understood because of the use of Al-
chemical jargon.
Both Eugenius and Ashmole readily, aye, gladly, confess
they owe much to Ripley, and modern students may profit no
less by a careful study of his works.
George Ripley died in 1490, faithful to his trust to the end.

with which he pursued his studies, he advanced rapidly and by
the time he was twenty years of age he had acquired a repu-
tation as a scholar. Becoming homesick for his mother for
whom he had retained a deep affection, despite her ill treat-
ment of him, which he now considered as due to her ignorance,
he, in the winter of 1482, set out on a journey back to
Trittheim.
He arrived at Spanheim in a snow storm that blocked further
passage and sought refuge in a Monastery. His stay in the
Monastery was so agreeable to his nature that he took the vows
as a monk. After a few years he was chosen abbot of the
Abbey of Spanheim, order of St. Benedict.
He remained Abbot of Spanheim for some twenty years,
devoting his time to study and the improvement of the Monas-
tery. He was a fair but strict disciplinarian, so much so that
the monks revolted and elected another Abbot.
Trithemius then traveled considerably, always seeking to
increase his knowledge and finally arrived at the Monastery of
Wurtzburg, where he was elected Abbot of St. James. It was
at the Monastery of Wurtzburg that Trithemius wrote the
greater part of his manuscripts and where he received and
taught both Paracelsus and Agrippa in the Hermetic science
and acted as their friend and counsellor.
Many modern writers on Arcane subjects have erroneously
stated that Trithemius was a Rosicrucian. This was a gross
misconception on their part for the reason that the association
one day to become known as the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis, or
Rosy Cross, was then only in its formative state, though the
Initiates had in mind the consolidation of the members of all
Occult and Arcane schools of the day.

Agrippa was a philosopher, physician,
theologian, soldier, secret service agent
for the Government, statesman, teacher,
author and above all, a reformer, both
feared and respected by the church and the men of science of
his day. His great talent and attainments were never questioned
by even his bitterest enemies. He was acquainted with eight
languages.
Agrippa was never for a moment free from persecution, for
which he admittedly was personally responsible, because he
never hesitated to expose evils and shams; priests and monks
were among his most bitter enemies.
Agrippa was born at Cologne on September 14, 1486, and
educated at the University of Cologne, a city then free from
the evils of the priestcraft of the day. The members of the von
Nettesheim family were intimates of the then Archbishop and
young Cornelius grew up in the service of the Emperor of
Germany, Maximilian I, who had such faith in the ability of
Agrippa that he sent him on a secret mission to England.
On his return from England he followed MaximUlian to
Italy, where he served for seven years. Thereafter he held a
post at Metz, after which he returned to Cologne and then
practiced medicine at Geneva.
At one time he was appointed physician to Louise of Savoy,

feared and respected by the church and the men of science of
his day. His great talent and attainments were never questioned
by even his bitterest enemies. He was acquainted with eight
languages.
Agrippa was never for a moment free from persecution, for
which he admittedly was personally responsible, because he
never hesitated to expose evils and shams; priests and monks
were among his most bitter enemies.
Agrippa was born at Cologne on September 14' 1486, and
educated at the University of Cologne, a city then free from
the evils of the priestcraft of the day. The members of the von
Nettesheim family were intimates of the then Archbishop and
young Cornelius grew up in the service of the Emperor of
Germany, Maximillian I, who had such faith in the ability of
Agrippa that he sent him on a secret mission to England.
On his return from England he followed Maximillian to
Italy, where he served for seven years. Thereafter he held a
post at Metz, after which he returned to Cologne and then
practiced medicine at Geneva.
At one time he was appointed physician to Louise of Savoy,

mother of Francis I, but left her services after a short period.
He next accepted a post offered him by Margaret, Duchess of
Savoy, Regent of the Netherlands.
Agrippa was a student under the Abbe Trithemius, who in-
structed him in the Arcanum of the Occult and the secret of
Alchemy. They became close life-long friends and co-workers.
In 1506 Agrippa went to Paris to attend the University and
while there, became acquainted with many of the then active
Mystics, Occultists, Alchemists and Novices of the Secret and
Arcane science.
These quickly recognized his ability both as a master of the
Alchemical science and as a leader of men and of the reforma-
tion then beginning. They persuaded him to found an exoteric
society of Occult Science to include the Acolytes of every
branch. He complied with this request and as a result of this
organization was given the title of "Imperator." l
This society was not a "Rosy Cross" but a prelude of what
was to follow, and after its formation, many students of this
society later became affiliated with the Fraternhas Ros<e Crucis.
Later Agrippa visited London, where he was the guest of an
Acolyte, Dean Collet, and in 1510 established a branch of the
Paris Society.
Still later Agrippa also established a branch of this same
society in Lyon. All of these groups were little less than study
and preparatory groups, engaged in the preparation for the
final form of the Grand Fraternity, the Fraternhas.

88 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
When Paracelsus was sixteen he left St. Andrew's for the
University of Basel. Immediately on his arrival there he con-
tacted Trithemius and became his Neophyte in the Cabala,
Alchemy and the Philosophy of Light. Paracelsus remained
a Neophyte under Trithemius until Trithemius passed on "to
his Father," or in the words of Paracelsus, "my spiritual Father
left me to join his Father."
Paracelsus himself stated that he was most fortunate in
coming into contact with so great a Master at so early an age,
Trithemius being recognized by all of the Philosophic Initiates
of his time as a Master in Magic, Alchemy, Astrology and the
Occult.
This in itself established a great love for these Arts in the
heart of Paracelsus. Immediately after the passing of Tri-
themius, Paracelsus was accepted as a Neophyte by Sigismund
Fugger, at Schwatz in Tyrol, who, like the Abbot, was an
Alchemist of high repute, having been selected by Trithemius
to succeed him in the instruction and guidance of the young
Neophyte.
Paracelsus remained with Fugger for nearly two years. He
then commenced his travels, visiting various parts of Germany,
Italy, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Russia,
and frequently served as Army physician and surgeon, ending
in the wars of Venice in 1525. During these years of travel
Paracelsus attended the various Universities in the cities he
visited and made contact with the Philosophic Initiates where-
ever he went.
After leaving the Army service in 1525, Paracelsus went to
Basel; and in 1527, on the recommendation of Oecolampadius,
he was appointed by the City Council as a professor of physics,
medicine and surgery. Unfortunately for him, the instructions
he had received were the opposite of Galen, Hippocrates and
Avicenna, and it was but a short time before he was in conflict
with organized authority.

During this time he held the office of city physician. In that
capacity he requested of the City Council of Basel that the
apothecaries of the city should be subjected to his supervision,
and that he should be permitted to determine whether or not
the compounders of medicine understood their business, and
to ascertain whether they had drugs of purity and potency.
This quickly drew upon him the combined hatred of the
druggists, apothecaries, physicians and professors, with the net
result that it was necessary for him to leave Basel in July of
1528, in order to avoid personal unpleasantness.
From Basel he went to Colmar; from Colmar to Esslingen
and Nuremberg in 1529 and 1530. In Nuremberg he met a
number of neo-Platonists and Alchemists and gained further
knowledge in the Arcane Science, which was an aid and benefit
to him, but he was again quickly denounced as a quack, char-
latan and imposter and answered the "regular" faculty of the
day by curing cases they could not even relieve. However, his
stay was made so unpleasant that he left Nuremberg and the
brethren, for Noerdlingen, thence to Munich, Regensburg,
Amberg, and in 1531, he attended a meeting of Philosophic
Initiates in St. Gall.
After this he traveled as an itinerant physician making cures
wherever he went. In 1535 he reached Zurich, where he made
contact with the brethren, thence to Maehren, Kaernthen and
Hungary; from thence to Salzburg.
While in Hungary, he was invited to Salzburg by the Prince
Palatine, Duke Ernst of Bavaria. Duke Ernst was at this time
an advanced Neophyte and sought the assistance of Paracelsus
to complete a certain part of the Work in which he was
engaged.
The record indicates that between the age of twenty-one
and twenty-five, Paracelsus also visited India and Turkey, but
there is no specific information.
Theophrastus was neither born nor baptized "Paracelsus."

Paracelsus was an attained, a spiritual or Hierarchic name indi-
cating the degree of his Initiation. It means of "high degree"
or of "high spirit," i.e., a highly developed, Illuminated or
"made Conscious" Soul. Paracelsus had a right to the name as
is being revealed more each day.
Paracelsus lived between two periods; between the ages of
priestcraft and debased rulers, in their worst form, and the
Renaissance of science, art, of medicine and philosophy, and at
a time when mental conflict shook the mental atmosphere of the
known world. Paracelsus was surrounded by master minds
such as Nicholas of Cusa; Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, great-
est of the Philosophic Initiates, Alchemists, and Symbolists;
Reuchlin; Trithemius, instructor and guide to more Neophytes
in the Arcane Science, than any other man; Bonvillus; and,
lastly, one whose influence on Paracelsus was possib.'y greater
than that of Trithemius; Cornelius Agrippa von Netiokeim,
who, but seven years the senior of Paracelsus, was nevertheless
the "Trismosinus" who helped Paracelsus in the final phase of
his Philosophic Initiation.
It is stated of Christian C R C in the FAMA, that "though yet
in his growing years, he determined to go to the Holy Land.
Paracelsus began his continent wide travels when he was a little
more than twenty-one. In the FAMA it is also stated of Christian
C R C that, "by reason of the feebleness of his body, he re-
mained still there." This has an important bearing on Paracelsus
as revealed by the records of his esoteric training.
Among the many questions in the numerous texts on Para-
celsus are such as:
Acknowledging the greatness of Paracelsus, why was he
never at ease? Why was he not content to settle down as did
other men?
Why was it not possible for Paracelsus, with all his knowl-
edge and insight into Natural and Divine Laws, to live at peace
with other men?

Why was it that Paracelsus was never known to associate
with any women?
Was it natural that a youth, well born as he was, not to
seek the association of women, especially since he had the
choice of the most noble?
How is it possible to reconcile the fact that, as a youth he was
associated with his father, and proved to be a most lovable and
respectful son, who always honored his father, yet he did not
grow up into an ardent lover which would be the natural
sequence?
Lastly, why is it that Paracelsus never grew a beard as do
other and apparently less virile men?
WE KNOW THE ANSWER. Compare the picture of Paracelsus
painted by Jan Wildens, with that of Count Cagliostro by
Bartolozzi, in the British Museum. Compare the general history
of these two men with that of Lawrence of Arabia. These
three men had the same unfortunate accident in their youth,
under different circumstances, but as far as the achievement of
greatness is concerned, the experience REACTED in the same
manner on all three.
Paracelsus was precocious. At fifteen he fell in love with a
young lady of high family of a neighboring city. As was
usual at the time and among noble families, an arrangement for
marriage was entered into. Six months later while out horse-
back riding, his horse became unmanageable and Paracelsus
was severely injured, though not emasculated. He was taken
to a surgeon who repaired the injury, but informed young
Paracelsus that the "Art required in marriage would be im-
possible to him."
The shock, the revulsion and the disappointment was such
that he rebuffed all consolation; he refused to see the young
lady or her people and the results of the accident reacted in two
directions: It embittered him and it gave him an inferiority

complex so that he decided to shun all mankind. Fortunately,
at about the time he was healed of the injury he came in touch
with Trithemius who was able to console him; win his confi-
dence, and direct his love and energy toward correcting abuses
then prevalent and to teach a new art and science.
Why is it that two women bitterly disappointed in love
react differently; one becoming bitter toward humanity; a
vixen, while the other becomes an angel of mercy? The answer
is to be found in the innermost recesses of the ego.
Two men become drunk, one of them will become a jolly
good fellow, while the other will manifest the traits of an in-
carnate devil. Why? Because, that which is in the innermost
spirit, in the ego itself, will be released.
It was thus with the three men of history: Paracelsus, Cagli-
ostro and Lawrence of Arabia. In all three instances, the
Creative vital energies, "the seed" of the Biblical narrative, was
turned inwardly and upwardly. The spirit which is of the
innermost ego was released, turned to good intent and genius
was released.
No one but Trithemius and Agrippa were ever told the
secret. Others who were in contact with Paracelsus accused
him of many things, including drunkenness, not being able to
comprehend that his acts were the result of inner complexes
and penned-up energies, seeking release.
He was "drunk," but it was a drunkenness of the creating
energy within, which could not find its full release even with
all his activity, and at the early age of forty-eight this had
burned itself out. Like his "Father," Trithemius, Paracelsus
"returned to his Father"; a man wholly misunderstood; reviled
on the one hand; loved and honored on the other, and at last
being acknowledged for what he really was; bereft of Love, but
master of Light.

complex so that he decided to shun all mankind. Fortunately,
at about the time he was healed of the injury he came in touch
with Trithemius who was able to console him; win his confi-
dence, and direct his love and energy toward correcting abuses
then prevalent and to teach a new art and science.
Why is it that two women bitterly disappointed in love
react differently; one becoming bitter toward humanity; a
vixen, while the other becomes an angel of mercy? The answer
is to be found in the innermost recesses of the ego.
Two men become drunk, one of them will become a jolly
good fellow, while the other will manifest the traits of an in-
carnate devil. Why? Because, that which is in the innermost
spirit, in the ego itself, will be released.
It was thus with the three men of history: Paracelsus, Cagli-
ostro and Lawrence of Arabia. In all three instances, the
Creative vital energies, "the seed" of the Biblical narrative, was
turned inwardly and upwardly. The spirit which is of the
innermost ego was released, turned to good intent and genius
was released.

The Credo of Paracelsus *
First and foremost, it was the intention of Paracelsus to be
to medicine what Luther sought to be to religion. He desired
to establish the art of healing upon an impregnable philosophic
foundation. The Aristotelian method was then current among
the schoolmen of Europe, but this he condemned and accepted
the Platonic doctrines instead.
He, at one fell swoop, swept aside the dogmas imputed to
Galen, Ibn Sina, and the Arabian physicians of the Middle
Ages.
These theories, catagorically stated, were:
1. Disease comes from God by direct volition as a
warning or as a punishment. Only God should be per-
mitted to effect a cure. Prayers, penances and the office
of the Church are the natural instrumentality through
which the divine mercy may be invoked to relieve the
suffering.
2. Disease comes from the influences of the devil and
his agencies. Here again, prayers, penances, exorcisms and
purification by the offices of the Church may avail. Dis-
ease may also be overcome through magical ceremonies,
formulas and exorcisms by wise women and magicians
who owe their power to their superior knowledge of the
occult powers of nature, and even, at times, to unholy
alliances with the forces of evil, as in Black Magic.
3. Disease comes from the stars. Here the physician
who knows the secret of the heavens and who has gathered
and prepared his remedies at the auspicious time may be
able to help.
4. Disease comes from the disturbances in the fluids or
humors of the body.

Paracelsus was vigorous in his denunciation, affirming that
the current medical doctrine was a system founded upon false
premises, and a philosophy consistently erroneous: "An arti-
ficial system fit for nothing except to swindle the public and
to prey upon the pockets of the sick."
In this one sentence he accused and condemned, in toto,
both priests and physicians, the two working together. He
describes the current system of medicine as a gibberish, unin-
telligent to everybody, and charged further that the aid and
abetment of the legal profession permitted the imposture to be
carried on, with punishment evaded by means of the law.2
"The best of our popular physicians are the ones that do
the least harm," he wrote. "But, unfortunately," he added,
"some poison their patients with mercury, while others
purge or bleed them to death. There are some who have
learned so much that their learning has driven out of them
all common sense.
"There are others who care a great deal more for their
own profit than for the health of their patients. Medical
science may be acquired by learning, but medical wisdom
is the gift of God."
In the treatment of the various topics in his works, Paracelsus
necessarily made use of a terminology greatly unlike that of
later writers. Many of the terms he used had to be coined by
him, but the great leaders that followed him, such as Baptist
van Helmont, Robert Fludd, Hahnemann, Rademacher and
others, readily understood them, because they were trained in
the same school.
Paracelsus was unwilling to leave any important subject
* "In the time of Paracelsus entrenched medicine, church and the law
subjected the people to serfdom. A modern Paracelsus is needed today
to free the people from the enstrangling hold organized medicine, forti-
fied by legal enactments, has on the people to a degree never thought
possible among an enlightened public. —The Viking, 1945.

(c) So many sick have been ruined, killed, crippled and
even abandoned, not in one disease only, but in nearly all ill-

In my time, there was no physician who could cure even a
toothache with certainty, not to mention more severe diseases.
We see, moreover, how great cities and rich persons offer
large sums, yet are abandoned in their need by their physicians,
who nevertheless, go about in silks, golden rings, much show,
display and idle babble, but with few cures.
I had on several occasions decided to abandon the art; for
the reason that no one appeared certain of anything, that it
was a collection of fables and a honeyed device for attracting
pennies; an art founded on credulity.
Yet have I failed to follow my convictions, but instead I
have acted with my usual simplemindedness, being influenced
by the suffering of mankind. I attended the universities in
Germany, Italy and France, and sought the foundations of
medicines. I was not only anxious to devote myself to their
doctrines, books and writings, but I wandered on to Granada,
to Lisbon, through Spain, through England, through the Mark,
through Prussia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, WaUachia, Tran-
sylvania, Croatia, the Wendian Mark, as also other countries.
In all corners and places I industriously and diligently ques-
tioned and sought for the true and experienced arts of medicine
and among all other men who might teach me.
I pondered much over it and concluded that medicine was an
uncertain art not honorably to be followed, an unfair art to be
hit upon by chance; where one was cured, ten were ruined.
This knowledge and experience caused me to think that it was
a deception of spirits to mislead men and to degrade them. I
again abandoned the art; but again I was driven back to it.
Then I discovered this saying of the Master, "The whole
need not a physician, but the sick."
This impressed me so much that I had to substitute another

feet and whole, nor fortune was to blame, but that it was an art
proven by need, useful to all sick and leading to health.
When I accepted this view, and adopted it for my own, it
was necessary that I should consider all that medical art was,
all that I had learned from books and from others. I found that
no one had a knowledge of the foundation of the art, had no
experience in it, understood it only a little and that many prac-
titioners had gone around the art of medicine much as a cat
around porridge; they were teaching something they themselves
did not understand; their disputations were at fault; that though
they visited and advised the sick, they understood neither the
disease nor the art of curing. Therefore the fault was, and is,
so much idle talk; chatterers in display and pomp, with nothing
in them. They were tombs which outwardly are beautiful but
inwardly ... For such reasons I was forced to seek further—to
stop reading evil lies, and to seek for a new foundation for
medical arts and practice which should be unspotted by such
fables and babble.
Astronomy is the science which deals with the comparison of
the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, elucidating the nature of
both and bringing man an understanding of the rational prin-
ciple governing their combined activity. This term, astronomy,
is used in a metaphoric sense, relating not so much to the sky
as to the celestial principles inherent, though generally dormant
in the mind of man.
Astronomy denotes ivisdom, the direct observance of the
truth resulting from a just appreciation and comprehension of
the relations between the Macrocosm and Microcosm. The
practical application of its science is the Kabala, erroneously
called magic.

feet and whole, nor fortune was to blame, but that it was an art
proven by need, useful to all sick and leading to health.
When I accepted this view, and adopted it for my own, it
was neces.5ary that I should consider all that medical art was,
all that I had learned from books and from others. I found that
no one had a knowledge of the foundation of the art, had no
experience in it, understood it only a little and that many prac-
titioners had gone around the art of medicine much as a cat
around porridge; they were teaching something they themselves
did not understand; their disputations were at fault; that though
they visited and advised the sick, they understood neither the
disease nor the art of curing. Therefore the fault was, and is,
so much idle talk; chatterers in display and pomp, with nothing
in them. They were tombs which outwardly are beautiful but
inwardly ... For such reasons I was forced to seek further-to
stop reading evil lies, and to seek for a new foundation for
medical arts and practice which should be unspotted by such
fables and babble.
Astronomy is the science which deals with the comparison of
the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, elucidating the nature of
both and bringing man an understanding of the rational prin-
ciple governing their combined activity. This terni, astronomy,
is used in a metaphoric sense, relating not so much to the sky
as to the celestial principles inherent, though generally dormant
in the mind of man.
Astronomy denotes wisdom, the direct observance of the
truth resulting from a just appreciation and comprehension of
the relations between the Macrocosm and Microcosm. The
practical application of its science is the Kabala, erroneously
called magic.

should be instructed and become proficient in this art.
He should be able to find out a great deal more about his
patient's disease by his own perception rather than by
questioning the patient.
"This inner Light5 is the astronomy of medicine; and as
physical anatomy shows all the inner parts of the body,

Philosophy is the true perception of both cause and effect
which enable the physician to understand the origin of the
disease and recognize the proper remedy. A physician must,
first of all, be a philosopher, daring to use his own reason, de-
spite the opinions of others and the authority which would
supersede his own conclusions.
The physician must, above all things, be in possession of that
faculty which is called intuition, a sensing-feeling-consciousness
within his innermost self, which enables him to see his own way
without being influenced externally. Nature, in the last analy-
sis, is the real physician. Her ways are simple, and she is not in
need of complicated prescriptions.
Astronomy is the higher part of philosophy. The latter deals
with the visible, material part of the human constitution; but
there is a vastly greater part which is ethereal and invisible.
There is a heaven (good) and an earth (evil) in man, as there
is in the great world; and in that heaven are all the celestial in-
fluences whose visible representatives we see in the sky.
By the science here called "astronomy," the whole of the
Microcosm (man) may be known. As the two worlds are
intimately connected, the physician should be acquainted with
the influences of the spiritual as well as with those of the
terrestrial world.
Man's diseases do not all originate in himself, but from the
influences that (he permits to) act upon him. These are by no
means to be comprehended solely under such terms as malaria,

moral causes, like obnoxious influences from others, discourage-
ments, the failure to realize cherished expectations, fear, terror,

state we know as health, the other as disease; both are harbored
in the same organism. The conflict is carried on everywhere in
the body, the actors being heat, cold, discomfort, pain. The
fever or pain suffered or manifested, is NOT the disease. Such
diseases are merely a physical expression of the raging conflict;

alchemist (battler for life), the arch<eus, or "host," or whatever
we choose to call the living force within, seeks to reduce the
destructive forces and bring about harmony or balance.
The main battle ends in a crisis. If the arch<eus wins, the
disease must disolvc, give way, and be eliminated in the form
of perspiration, excreta, respiration, or all three. If the disease
conquers, the host is overcome and dissolved in death.
Disease itself must be viewed as a hah* spiritual, half corporeal
living organism; as a microcosm within a Microcosm, as a form
of parasite, containing within itself its own life-phenomena and
life-processes within the human organism. Healing takes place
when nature or medical art succeeds in developing so forceful
a vital activity (health host) that the parasite is reduced to nor-
malcy, that is, the disease is overcome.
The less power of resistance for actual influences that a
person possesses (the less health hosts present), the more
liable to disease will man be subject. The vital force is not

luminous sphere, and it may be made to act at a distance.
In these semi-material rays the imagination of man may
produce healthy or morbid effects. It may poison the
essence of life and cause disease, or it may purify it after
it has been made impure, so as to restore health.
To understand what it is that heals wounds, and without
this knowledge the remedy will not be recognized, we must
know (understand) the nature of the flesh, of the body, the
veins and the bones. All have in themselves an innate force

That is to say, this force native in the bone heals the frac-
tures; the same force naturally contained in the flesh heals the
flesh; so with every member of the body; each has its healing
agent within itself, and thus nature has in every member the
force that heals the wounded part. The surgeon should recog-
nize that it is not he that heals, but this force in the body. If
the physician thinks it is he that heals he deceives himself and
does not understand his art.
In nature's battle against disease the physician is only the
helper, which furnishes nature with weapons, the apothecary
is but the smith who forges them. The business of the physician
is therefore to give to nature the things she needs in fighting
and winning the battle and Nature must be recognized as the
real physician.
There are five inductive causes for disease in man; The astral,
the venene, the natural, the spiritual and the divine. As there
are five causes for disease, so there are likewise five separate
methods for their treatments, and even so, five faculties or
sects of physicians. Each method might be sufficient for them
all and it is not well for a physician to change from one system
to another unless he is fully conversant with it.
As to the causes for disease; all the influences that ema-
nate from the sun, the planets, and the stars, act invisibly
upon man. The world is surrounded by a vaporous sphere
like an egg surrounded by its shell. Through that shell the
Cosmic influences pass toward the center.
If evil elements exist in the sphere of our Soul they
attract such astral (evil, destructive), influences as may
develop disease; but if no germs of disease exist in our
mental atmosphere, the astral influences coming from the
outside will cause no harm.10

whether of planets, stars, sun and moon, or to "germs," is still the domi-

image (see ourselves as we really are, not as we would make
ourselves believe we are by a hypocritical self-righteousness),
and according to the dictates by which we should act, without
attempting to discover reasons in the guidance of our life in
regard to morals and virtues. We should do that which our
conscience urges, for no other reason than that our conscience
dictates it so.
We should build the fundamental and corner-stone of our
Wisdom upon three principle points:
First, Prayer; a strong desire and aspiration for that which is
good. It is necessary that we should seek and knock, and
thereby ask the Omnipotent Power within ourselves, and re-
mind it of its promises and keep it ever active. If we do this

be opened, and that which was hidden before our sight will

that may or may not be true, but that faith which is based upon
knowledge as a result of feeling by experience, an unswerving
confidence, a faith that may "move mountains" and throw them
into the ocean, by which every thing is possible, testified to by

kindled in the Soul, we will find no difficulty in harmonizing it

were, in his own Soul, is like one who has lost his material
senses. The world may look upon him as a fool, vide the great
leaders and geniuses; but in the consciousness of the Supreme,
in the sight of the Cosmic Law, he is wise and is in a sense the
confidential friend of God; comprehending a great deal more
of the mysteries of God than all those who receive their
superficial learning through the avenues of the external senses.

throughout the whole of man's organism (even in the marrow
of his bones), moves upon (in) the seminal fluid, out of which
the human form is developed.
The spirit of God is the vivifying and spiritualizing element
in the process of co-creation.18 But the human fetus in the

It is like a fish in the water, and brings an animal nature in a
human form, into the world.
A man carrying the seed within himself and having a lewd
imagination is dispossessed of reason;17 he lives only within his
lusts and morbid desires.17 God has created man that he may
live a free being within the Light of Nature,18 therefore the
11 Herein is a mystic or alchemic Arcanum touched upon by only a few
of the Philosophic Initiates. It is not strange that Paracelsus should do so,
because due to an accident both the seed itself and the Spirit of the seed
remained in him and there was a constant conflict between the "fancies"
as he calls them, and the "lusts" or "morbid desires," and the higher light
of his spiritual knowledge.

of the Pbilosopbic Imtiates. It is not stran~e that Paracelsus should do so,
because due to an accident both the seed itself and the Spirit of the seed
remained in him and there was a constant conflict between the "fancies"
as he calls them, and the "lusts" or "morbid desires," and the higher light
of his spiritual knowledge.
Paracelsus had attained sufficiently that he could, by his Will ( Volantia)

the opinions of those supposed to be "Divine."
The wisdom which man should possess, does not come from
the earth, nor from his mind, but is a fifth essence. When in
possession of such wisdom, man is superior to the stars and the
constellation, provided he lives according to that superior wis-
dom. Such a person, being a master, is no longer under the
dominion of either heaven or earth, but by means of his free
Will, is a Magus and the means to fulfillment are the Magic at
his command.
Christ, the prophets and the apostles possessed magical
power, acquired less by their learning than by the holiness to
which they had attained. They were able to heal the sick by
the laying on of their hands28 and to perform many other
wonderful but natural things.
The clergymen talk about what the Nazarene was able to do,
but where are they who live like him and by so living are able
to do as he did? Was it not promised by Christ that his true
followers (representatives) would be able to perform the same
and even greater things? Where are these who, having been
ordained to the ministry, fulfill his promise? But should anyone
not a WMW-ordained minister be capable of healing the sick by
Cosmic state. This, also, is the Work of the Alchemist and once accom-

""That which man is capable of performing in one age, men of other
ages may do also. There are those today who are as capable of healing

of selfish organization effectually prevents men from performing God's
Will. Soon men will throw off their shackles and return to the fold
despite the might of selfish men."-The Viking.

sequently they rule the world of man. As the mind of man is
the Microcosmic counterpart of the Universal Macrocosmic
Mind, the opposite types of these states are also active in the
imagination of the world.
The thoughts of man act upon the Universal to the degree
that the Universal acts upon him. It is therefore essential that
man should govern his imagination and not allow it to run wild
and become destructive.
Man is a twofold being, possessing a divine and an animal
nature. When he thinks, feels and acts as a divine being should,
he is a true man; when he feels and acts like an animal, he is an
animal, and as low as those animals he imitates and which
manifest in him.28
An exalted imagination, the result of desires for good, raises

that are low, degrade and vulgarize him.
Imagination is the power by which the Will forms entities
out of thought. Imagination is not fancy, for fancy is the cor-

man becomes pregnant through desire, and desire gives birth
to deeds that harmonize with desire. It is the privilege and
within the power of everyone to educate and direct his imagi-

He who desires to learn how a man can unite his power
of imagination with the imagination of heaven, must learn
the process through which this is accomplished. Man
comes into possession of creative power by uniting his own
mind with the Cosmic mind. He who succeeds in blend-

128 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Faith stimulates and elevates the power of the spirit. A
person possessed of a strong faith feels as if he were uplifted,
and were living independently of the body, though this is only
seemingly so. By the power of faith the Apostles and disciples
accomplished great things that were above the ordinary run of
Nature. The saints performed their miracles through the use
of the same power.
True faith is a powerful force, and this fact proves that
we are (possess) Souls in addition to the mere physical
body. Faith accomplishes that which the body could not.
Man is created with the possibility of great powers; He
is great in heaven and may be greatest on earth. He
possesses faith, and faith is the emanation of a Light more
powerful and much superior to all other light, and stronger
than all creatures. BY FAITH AND IMAGINATION WE MAY
ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER WE MAY DESIRE.
The power of faith overcomes all the spirits (forces) of
Nature, because it is a spiritual force, and spirit is higher
than Nature. Whatever is grown in the realm of Nature
may be changed by the power of faith. Anything we may
accomplish that surpasses nature, is accomplished by faith,
and BY FAITH DISEASES MAY BE CURED.
Magic is a great hidden wisdom, just as that which we
commonly know as human reason may be a great folly,
because it is based on selfishness.
The human heart80 is a great thing; so great that no one
can fully express its greatness. It is imperishable and
eternal, Uke God, if we only understood all the powers of
the human heart,80 NOTHING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO us.

BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 129
The imagination is fortified and perfected through faith;
every doubt destroys that much of faith and causes it
to be inert. Faith must confirm the imagination, because it
perfects the Will.
Those who are strong in their faith, and filled with con-
fidence that the divine in them can protect them against all
evil influences, whether they come from an incarnate or
discarnate entity, cannot be harmed by either. It is only
necessary that through an effort of the Will they close
themselves against all evil.
The Will is the key that locks the door. If a man's mind
is weak and his Soul unprotected by faith and confidence,
evil may enter. The best remedy against evil is to build a
strong Will, Illuminated by the Light that is within the
Soul, and which is the Wisdom from God.

he left his home in Modena and traveled to France where he

Shortly before the publication of these propositions, he had

up with the same avidity he had devoted to Kabbalism, and

Mirendola seemingly had little or nothing in common with
the young men of his day. At a very early age he turned to
religious study. To satisfy his ardor for spiritual enlightenment
he left his home in Modena and traveled to France where he
entered the university. Mirendola was also deeply interested in
Astrology and through this he became acquainted with Kab-
halistic students in Paris who helped him to master the science
t0 a degree that he himself became an authority, so much so
that by the time he was twenty-four, he had written and pub-
lished nine hundred propositions in logic, mathematics, physics
and divinity, as these were connected with the Kabbala.
Shortly before the publication of these propositions, he had
also become interested in Neo-Platonism, a study which he took
up with the same avidity he had devoted to Kabbalism, and
he soon became known as a master of both.
The greatest of his works was his THESIS KABBALISTICAt, in-

body all of the mysteries beginning with the days of Abraham.
Despite his mastery of the science of the Kabbala and that
he became one of the most prominent of the Neo-Platonists,
Mirendola was a sincere Catholic and at one time, i.e., about
1489, the Inquisition was induced to take action against him.
Pope Alexander appeared to be friendly to him and he was
absolved. Thereafter he wrote his Apologia Pici Mirendola.
Other works by Mirendola which clearly indicate the trend
of his mind, were Conclusiones Philosophic< e et theologic<e,
published in 1486, and Disputationes adversus Astrologiam
Devinaticum, published in 1496.
To add to his reputation, Mirendola also was a Philosophic
Initiate of the Hermetic school. This is made manifest to all
Initiates in his De Auro, sometimes called The Light, wherein
he shows that he had accomplished the First Watch, and, like
Madathanas, had found The True Center [Light] in the Inner-
most Triangle.
This alone would have made his help invaluable to all who
were seeking to attain Philosophic Initiation, the Cosmic Light
of the true Kabbalist.
Mirendola's Conclusiones Kabbalistic< e was published in 1486.
Paracelsus who was to become the greatest of Kabbalists, was
born in 1493. Trithemius, instructor and guide to many of
those who became Philosophic Initiates and members of the
World Council, was born in 1442 and was therefore forty-four
when Conclusiones Kabbalistic< e was published. Trithemius
was well acquainted with Mirendola at the time this book was
in preparation.
It was through Mirendola's Conclusiones Kabbalistic<e and
Trithemius' interpretation that Paracelsus was initiated into

Mystics, they were more certainly Paracelsian Converts and

As persecution followed and he was made vividly aware that

circulated and the Fraternitas launched among the seekers of

136 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Here in a few paragraphs you have the reason for success and fail-
ure in all activities in life, with emphasis on Spiritual Development.
To make this work more easily understood, let us take for
example the man, any man, who plants an apple orchard and
develops it into healthy, fruit-bearing maturity.
First of all, he will select the proper soil. He will then pains-
takingly prepare the soil in accordance with known rules and
the best known methods. After the soil is ready and the proper
time of planting approaches, he will select the best stock of
grafted trees and plant these most carefully. Having finished the
planting, his work is not finished; only barely begun.
Step by step and in proper sequence, he must spray the trees
from time to time to keep them free from destructive insects;
he must frequently work the soil to prevent choking weeds
from causing disease or otherwise killing the trees. He must
furnish food for the trees so that they will grow and not be-
come stunted. When fall comes he must mulch the trees for
the protection of the precious root system.
During the spring of the second year of planting, his first
duty is to carefully cut out all undesirable growth commonly
and vulgarly known as "water shoots," because these would
gradually kill out the fruit-bearing branches. He must trim
the fruit-bearing branches to keep them in proper proportion.
Next comes spraying with insecticide to keep the trees free
from disease. This is followed by cultivation of the soil and
again feeding the trees for proper growth.
Thus, by constant care and watching, the second year passes,
but yet there is no fruit; however, if he is a good husbandman,
his trees will be healthy and will have made the proper growth.
A third year follows in like manner, then a fourth; a fifth;
a sixth; a seventh; an eighth and then a ninth. If all continued
well, then after eight to ten long years of hard work and wait-
ing, he may be rewarded by a few blossoms and possibly a fruit

governs the growth of a tree in the field, so does it govern in

i4o ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
In his own work La Vraie Philosophie des Metaux, published
in 1567, he tells the story of his search and Initiation, but in
a jargon which none but a Brother of Light would be able to
understand, as he clothed his own ideals, struggles and failures
because of weaknesses not yet overcome, under the cloak of
being "misled and defrauded by charlatans."
He was, in truth, misled time and again, but if the sincere
Neophyte will substitute himself for Zachaire and recognize
that each time he fails it is because of a weakness within himself
(this weakness being in fact a part of himself and is a "charla-
tan" or weak-one), and when he fails he has been defrauded
and becomes bereft (defrauded indeed, by himself and lost
much), then the book will not be too difficult to understand.
Unfortunately, all writers dealing with Zachaire and his texts
have accepted the story literally instead of symbolically, and
have made "confusion more confounded." One might just as
well accept Bunyan's Pilgrims Progress literally and believe and
teach that all these animals actually inhabit the human body
instead of being symbolical of the passions and emotions in the
heart of man. In this is the Arcanum.
Leaving Toulouse, Zachaire traveled to Paris where he sought
out others who were engaged in the Great Work. Fortunately,
he had learned his lesson fairly well, was able to persue his
study and continue with his own development without repeat-
ing the many errors he had been guilty of in Toulouse.
It should, however, be said with justice, that the Neophyte
is exceptionally rare who is enabled to proceed with the Work
without being misled and retarded by errors resulting from
weaknesses within and passions as yet unsubdued or transmuted.
Especially is this true of younger Acolytes.
Zachaire arrived in Paris in 1545. After making the proper

Especially is this true of younger Acolytes.
Zachaire arrived in Paris in 1545. After making the proper

as Turva Philosophorum, all of Trevisan's writings then in the
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 141
Archives of the Brethren in Paris, the writings of Lully and
Arnold de Villanova. These works, together with his own
gradual spiritual development, furnished him with the material
for his own text Opuscule de la Philosophie de Metaux, traitant
de L1 Augmentation et Perfection de ceux, first published in
French and accepted by the Brethren as an authoritative text
and many times translated into Latin.
Zachaire was not a boaster and did not spare himself in telling
of his many failures. He was a true preceptor in that he
outlined the work to be done and, by his failures, warned
Acolytes what they might expect on beginning the Great
Work.
This warning is even of greater importance in our modern
age for the reason that few are as thoroughly imbued with the
Soul-stirring desire to succeed in the Great Work as was he.
Zachaire succeeded in attaining to Philosophic Initiation in
1550, twenty-five long years after his first introduction to the
Great Work. This also should be encouraging to those with
many weaknesses and difficulties to overcome and who feel
they are not progressing.
In 1551, having been made a member of the World Council,
Zachaire left the Brethren in France on a commission to
Brethren in Lausanne, Switzerland. His commission fulfilled,
he left for Antwerp and remained there until his book was in
print. He then left Antwerp for a retreat known and open to
the Brethren in Germany where he remained until his demise in
1576. His entire record is proof that he was a faithful member
of the World Pre-Rosicrucian Council, representing France.

THOMAS CHARNOCK
THOMAS CHARNOCK was born in Faversham, (Kent) England,
May n, 1525, of poor parents. Charnock travelled ex-
tensively throughout England as a
if ,A>- j., J.K- **. —* young man. Being of an inquisitive
f MEMBER OF \ mind with a brilliant intellect, he sought
* THE WORLD ?knowledge wherever he could find it.
During his travels in England he became
acquainted with what then was termed
"hidden" or "forbidden" knowledge,
which he later recognized as the Arcane
science.
Charnock was not satisfied with the
Occult science he could gather in England. On being informed
that such knowledge was more easily obtained and more openly
taught in Germany, he left England for Germany, and there
contacted the Paracelsians. Only part of the teachings of
Paracelsus appealed to him because his greatest interest centered
in the Hermetic and Alchemical science. As he advanced in
his studies and the brilliancy of his mind was recognized by his
fellow students, he was introduced to members of the World
Council then being organized for the purpose of enlisting the
interest of the Acolytes and Initiates of the various Arcane
associations into one esoteric body. He became an interested
and active member of the organization which later became the
ROSY CROSS or Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis.
As was the universal practice of that early period, Charnock
never revealed, either by word of mouth or in his writing, who
his initiators (instructors and guides) were. However, he does
tell us that he received the secret and that after much misfor-
tune [many trials] he attained to the work [Philosophic Initia-
tion] in 1555. Before he returned to England his instructor
and guide invested Charnock with all his regalia and instru-
ments of the art [all the Arcane instructions and manuscripts]
in his [the instructor's] possession.

May 11, 1525, of poor parents. Charnock travelled ex-
tensively throughout England as a
~t
~ young man. Being of an inquisitive
MEMBER OF mind with a brilliant intelle~ he sought
THE WORLD knowledge wherever he could find it.
{ COUNCIL, PRE- During his travels in England he became
~
ROSICRUCIAN acquainted with what then was termed
INITIATE "hidden" or "forbidden" knowledge,
L'Ordre J11 Lis. which he later recognized as the Arcane
science.
~~ Charnock was not satisfied with the
Occult science he could gather in England. On being informed
that such knowledge was more easily obtained and more openly
taught in Germany, he left England for Germany, and there
contacted the Paracelsians. Only part of the teachings of
Paracelsus appealed to him because his greatest interest centered
in the Hermetic and Alchemical science. As he advanced in
his studies and the brilliancy of his mind was recognized by his
fellow students, he was introduced to members of the World
Council then being organized for the purpose of enlisting the
interest of the Acolytes and Initiates of the various Arcane
associations into one esoteric body. He became an interested
and active member of the organization which later became the
Rosv CRoss or Fratemitas Rosee Crucis.
As was the universal practice of that early period, Chamock
never revealed, either by word of mouth or in his writing, who
his initiators (instructors and guides) were. However, he does
teH us that he received the secret and that after much misfor-
tune [many trials] he attained to the work [Philosophic Initia-
tion] in 1555. Before he returned to England his instructor
and guide invested Charnock with all his regalia and instru-
ments of the art [all the Arcane instructions and manuscripts]
in his [the instructor's] possession.
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 143
Charnock returned to England after his admittance into the
World Council and took up his residence in Oxford, where, as
a vocation, he practiced Alchemical medicine and Surgery, and,
as an avocation, he continued his studies and experiments in
Alchemy. Of these he treats in his various writings, but in the
jargon of the hermetic Alchemists, and unless one has the key,
it is impossible to understand them.
Charnock attained to the first degree of the Great Work in
1555, according to the record. By 1557 he had so far suc-
ceeded in the second phase of the Work that he felt assured of
success. Unfortunately, like so many others before and after
his time, he did not think of his personal safety. He made no
provision for his protection with the result that he was forcibly
recruited into the English army to fight the French. Charnock
was sent to France as a common soldier.
The English were defeated at Calais, and shortly thereafter
Charnock was again free. Though his induction into the
English army was unfortunate in that it interfered with the
continuation of his Work, it, nevertheless, proved to be a
fortune in disguise, because after his release he became ac-
quainted with a number of Initiates of the French Arcane
orders and on leaving Calais he, together with his newly found
friends, journeyed to Avignon and was there received and
further instructed in the Arcanum of the Occult, and later
visited Lyon, where he was favorably received by the brethren.
In 1560 he returned to England and settled in Stockland,
Somerset, where, in 1562, he married and settled down to the
practice of his former profession, surgery, and continued his
researches.
Charnock was the author of an autobiographical work en-
titled Aenigma ad Alchhniam, published in 1572, and also
Beviary of Natural Philosophy, first published in 1557 and of
which Elias Ashmole thought so much that he reprinted it in
his Theatrum Chermcum.
Thomas Charnock died August 27, 1581.

was born at Valenciennes in 1531.
Like most of the youth of the century
preceding the formation of the Fra-
ternitas, he early became interested
in Alchemy and the Arcane Sciences.
The very air seemingly was pervaded
by the odour or influences of the mys-
teries. Perhaps as many of the Initiates claimed, the air was
filled with the Souls of the Initiate Templars who had been so
violently released from their bodies as the result of the ordeal
of fire suffered at the hands of priests and kings.
Whatever the reason, Fontaine began the study of Alchemy,
his favorite texts being those of Agrippa and Jean de Meung,
the later making such an impression upon him that the style of
his writings was copied from that of The Romance of the Rose.
At the age of twenty-three he came to Paris and there
quickly contacted the Society of Occult and Alchemical stu-
dents, earlier organized under the direction of Agrippa. This
Society was actually a sub-branch of the profoundly Arcane
Order of the Rose which later became the L 'Ordre du Lis.
By the time Fontaine had reached his twenty-ninth year he
had attained to Philosophic Initiation and became one of the
Brethren of Light. In 1561, when but thirty years of age, his
first work, La Fontaine des Amoureux de Science, was pub-
lished at Paris. This was written in his native French. When
he was forty-one his second work, La Fontaine Perilleuse, was
published, also at Paris.

attention to them. Some years later when he began to expound
these doctrines he could not give sufficient praise to Paracelsus,
and gave him all possible credit.
Directly after attaining Philosophic Initiation, he all but
discontinued his practice of medicine and began to devote most
of his time to writing, with the result that his first work,
Mysteria Antiminii, was published at Basle, 1573, or when he
was but thirty-five.
His second work was De Secretis Antimonti Liber, published
in Latin, Basle, 1575.
Another work Clavis Alchemize, his most important text for
the Neophyte, was not published until 1614, two years after his
death.
The Alchemical writings of von Suchten were first made
available to American Neophytes by the great Alchemist,
Philosophic Initiate and member of the Council of Three,
Ethan Allen Hitchcock in 1862, in his work Alchemy and the
Alchemists.1
Like Paracelsus and Valentine, von Suchten employed the
jargon of the early Alchemists; nevertheless, even uninter-

straightforward in a positive manner without disputing on any

things. We refer again to the Wood of Life of Braccesco: The method
of planting an orchard and bringing it to healthy maturity is not a wit
different than to bring the Tree of Life within us to flower and perfec-
tion. In the work of both the identical care and insight, the same pa-
tience and effort are essential; the same weaknes,, and diseases exist and
must be overcome in both instances.
i5o ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
In further explanation, Hitchcock quotes from Philalcthes
that the Acolyte may more easily understand:
"Since this knowledge is so wonderful, being the very
Looking-glass of Nature, the antidote against poverty and
sickness [weakness and slavery to self and others], and
consequently the cut-throat [the eliminator] of covetu-
ousness, pride, sordid ambition and weak affection, who
would not bestow a little time in the inquiry of it? Let
me assure you, in the words of the great Trevisan, the
Art is so plain, that, if it were nakedly described, it would
be contemptible; and yet in mechanical arts how fre-
quently it is for men to serve seven, eight, yea, ten years'
apprenticeship to attain them.
"With some who are a little more ingenious, how fre-
quently are considerable sums of money bestowed in addi-
tion; YET IN THIS NOBLE ART, EXCELLING ALL HUMAN
SCIENCE, AS THE SUN DOES A CANDLE, WHO WILL EMPLOY
HIMSELF WITH DILIGENCE? UNLESS IT BE SOME MONEY-
MINDED SOTS, WHO SEEK ONLY RICHES; AND YET EVEN THEY
SOON WEARY. So THAT FEW OR NONE PERSIST IN THE IN-
QUIRY, SAVE A FEW ROUGHISH SOPHISTS WHO LIVE BY COZEN-
ING; by reason of whom the Art is scandalized, and ill-
spoken of"
The entire philosophy of von Suchten runs parallel to that
of Paracelsus, Valentine and Trevisan. To comprehend the
one is to understand the other.
Although von Suchten was most active in helping to lay the
ground work of the Fraternitas, he did not live to see it pro-
claimed to the world; passing to the great beyond in 1612,
just after the formation of the Fraternitas was completed, but
had not as yet been announced to the public.

convert to the doctrines of Luther, so
much so that he actually became a

For a short period he was preceptor
at Marbach, near Ludwigsburg, but be-
came so imbued with the new crusade
for religious freedom and the attain-
ment of spiritual realization held out by
the teachings of Paracelsus and the Alchemists that he pro-
ceeded to devote all of his time and energies to this ideal.
Studion left Marbach for Nurenberg to seek full contact
with the Philosophic Initiates of the various Initiate schools
and there found his preceptor who proceeded to instruct him
in the Great Work. In 1586 he left Nurenberg to attend a
mission to a Lutheran assembly to be held at Lunebergon. The
success of this assembly gave him the thought that if this
religious convocation could be such a success so shortly after
the beginning of the Reformation, why could there not be an
Association of the age old Occult and Arcane schools then
active, all of whom were engaged in the Great Work and
sought Philosophic Initiation, or Greater Light, as their ulti-
mate. Out of this thought was born the first organization
composed of those engaged in the Great Work and this he
named the Militia Crucifera Evangelica, an Evangelical Occult,

The Basic teachings of the MILITIA was the Occult and religi-
ous teachings of Paracelsus. Studion was more of a Mystic than
an Alchemist, though the end in view was the same, i.e.,
Philosophic Initiation. His views were colored by his con-
version to Luther's religious interpretation and an intense desire
for religious freedom which also had in view the freedom of
those engaged in the Great Work, but by a different method
than that employed by Luther for the reason that the number
of students engaged in the Great Work was limited in number.
Studion did not foresee that his Militia would become the
open door into the greater and more Arcane that was to follow
and be known as the Fraternitas, nor did he live long enough
to see the formation of the Brethren of Light into an organiza-
tion such as he had dreamed of and labored for. It may be said
with truth that out of the travail of the MILITIA was born the
Fraternitas Ros<e Cructs and that great credit is due Studion.
Both Maier and Fludd were members of the MILITIA though
Fludd did not have the opportunity to meet Studion; both were
fully acquainted with the principles inculcated by the NAO-
METRIA and both were of the original Seven actively engaged
in the "bringing to birth" of the Fraternitas. The fact that
neither Maier nor Fludd mentioned either Studion nor the
NAOMETRIA should not have ever mislead anyone sincerely
engaged in the Great Work because even their own part in the
foundation of the ROSY CROSS as such was carefully hidden
under Initiate names or initials.
However, Fludd was acquainted with Henricus Madathanas
who was the real Father of Rosicrucian Symbolism and who
gives the key thereto in the Preface of his Golden Age Restored

R. C. ausgebotten, etc., 1615, or Echo of the God-Illuminated
Brotherhood of the Venerable Order R.'. C.'..
The unexpected death of the author and co-founder of the
Fraternitas completely upset the plans which had been made for
its publication. Originally this publication was to have been
printed as of 1615 and not released until AFTER the FAMA had
been made public.
This explains the use of the word "ECHO," whereas, released
as it was, before that of the FAMA, it should have been called
the "PRECURSOR" of the FAMA.
The actual facts are that the plans for the publication for
the FAMA and the announcement of the Fraternitas were known
for some time before either materialized. This was natural
because the preparation of the FAMA and the formation of the
Fraternitas took a considerable number of years and Sperber,
helping in both, knew all about it.
He carefully prepared the text for his book during this period
of formation, with, as stated, the thought that his text should be
released, and be truly an ECHO, or a part of the teachings of
the Fraternitas.
His death and the misunderstanding or impatience of his
publisher upset these plans and conveyed erroneous facts to
the profane.
Shortly after this period there arose several other equally mis-
taken ideas. A publication known as the Responsio, by one
Haselmeyer, member of the Knights of the Holy Cross, a religi-
ous order having nothing to do with Mysticism, was printed
with, or as a part of, the FAMA. Haselmeyer, according to the
records, had no actual knowledge of the formation of the
Fraternitas or the Publication of the original FAMA.
As a matter of fact, Responsio was published four years prior
to the FAMA. Later, the publisher, who, in no way was con-

The unexpected death of the author and co-founder of the
Fraternitas completely upset the plans which had been made for
its publication. Originally this publication was to have been
printed as of 161 5 and not released until AFI'ER the FAMA had
been made public.
This explains the use of the word "ECHo," whereas, released
as it was, before that of the FAMA, it should have been called
the "PRECURSOR" of the FAMA.

As early as 1618; four years after the FAMA was made public,
the Supreme Grand Master Michael Maier, made it known that
the General Reformation was not actually a Rosicrucian pub-
lication and did not belong with the FAMA as an official
publication.
This was equally true of the Confessio, though this was, and

The Mystic or Christian concepts of Sperber were those of
a much earlier Christian Mystic, namely, Basilius, who, in
describing the process of the preparation, wrote:
". . . Invocation to God must be made with a certain
heavenly intention, drawn from the BOTTOM OF A PURE
AND SINCERE HEART AND CONSCIENCE, pure from all ambition
[selfishness], hypocricy, and all other vices which have
any affinity with these. Arrogance, boldness [forward-
ness], pride, luxury, petulancy, oppression of the poor
and other similar evils, must be eradicated from the heart.
"When a man desires to prostrate himself before the
throne of grace, for obtaining health, he must do so with
a conscience free from all unprofitable weeds, THAT HIS
BODY MAY BE TRANSMUTED into a holy TEMPLE OF GOD, and
be purged from all uncleanliness.
"God will not be mocked by worldly, self-righteous
men, pleasing and flattering themselves with their own
conceits. . . . God must be invoked with reverential fear
and acknowledged with obedience and true respect . . .

be a partaker of the true medicine [elixir], much less of

not in any way influence those who had entered the Portals
of the Fraternitas or those who had attained Philosophic Initia-

Julius Sperber was released from further labor in 1615, some
six months before the release of the FAMA to the profane world,
his part of the work was finished and well done.

During these travels he contacted many

and as a result of transmutation, the spiritual side of man, the
Soul, might gain its freedom. He, like Paracelsus, taught of
the opus of medicine, as also the science of the Sanctus Spiritus
or the House of God, or, as the FAMA has it, the "House of the
Holy Spirit," the two being one and the same thing, i.e., the
material form of the Neophyte which has been successfully
transmuted so that the Soul has been brought into consciousness
and Illumination and, baptized by the Holy Ghost, is the Holy
Spirit or sanctified Spirit.
Years after the passing of Khunrath, another Supreme Grand
Master of the Rosy Cross paid tribute to him by stating that
he, Khunrath, deserved to be crowned as a Prince of the Rose-
Cross, a statement which has been universally misinterpreted.
In modern masonry, a deserving brother may be so crowned
even though he has no knowledge whatever of the Hermetic
Science, but Levi had in mind that Khunrath had become, by
his efforts and labors, a Knight, i.e., an Illuminee of the ROSE
CROSS.
It was due to the fact that Khunrath had proved his Illumina-
tion to those sitting in Council in the pre-formation of the
Fraternitas Ros<e Cructs that he was named an "Illuminated
Christian Kabbalist."
Khunrath wrote a considerable number of manuscripts, but

Christos (Biblically speaking, the Christ), and bringing this
Christos into life, i.e., into Consciousness.

by it revealed, all the Wisdom known to Solomon.
THIS is AN ARCANUM and those who solve it become ROSE
CROSS by attaining to Philosophic Initiation.
In this we have all the Wisdom not only of Solomon, but of
all the Initiates. It is both extremely simple to those who have
sought, and found, the Light, and yet shrouded in utter dark-
ness to those who have not been able to penetrate the veil of
the Temple.
Christos is the hidden mystery. This mystery cannot be
solved until man individually, by great desire and constant
search finds the "grave" where the Christos is buried, removes
the "stone" and brings the Christos into life, i.e., Consciousness
or Illumination, the Light.
The stone is profane, carnal man. This stone must have all
its rough edges removed and be perfectly moulded to fit into
the Temple. This is done by the transmutation of all carnal
desires, passions and thoughts. This, in short, is the work of
Philosophic Initiation and when success crowns the effort, the
Aspirant has become a Knight ROSE CROSS, not Rose Croix.
Khunrath did not use the jargon of the Alchemists as much
as many of the other writers of his time and his description of
the Great Work may be understood by those without a pro-
found knowledge of the Arcane.
He informs the Aspirant that the first need is to bring
about the purification of the personal being. This requires
a transmutation of all thoughts and desires so that the
student avoids all carnal acts which do not have a spiritual
reason. Until this is done it is impossible to open the vision
to see God. To see God, of course, is only possible when
the person has become so greatly free from the gross evils
that the divine within, the Christos or Soul, has been suffi-

be able to manifest in the Light, or AS A Light. To the

profane, this statement, though perfectly simple and plain,
will seem like the jargon of the old Alchemists.
After thus speaking esoterically, Khunrath is perfectly clear,
for he tells us the "senses must be stilled." This being "stilled"
does not mean that the senses must be destroyed, but that they
must be refined on the one hand, and held in subjection, or
controlled, on the other.
Biblically speaking, it was stated: "Be still and know that I
am God." It is only when the senses are in abeyance that the
still small voice of God can be heard and that He can be known.
In the stillness of the Soul, i.e., when the passions are subdued
and do not make themselves felt, sanctification can take place,
and when this happens, then Illumination follows.
This in itself is the manifestation of the Fire or Light of the
Soul; it is thus that the Holy Ghost descends and man then is
the ROSE CROSS Temple of the Holy Spirit.
The path to attainment is possible only through the means of
change. Change, when in the direction of the spiritual, is a
form of transmutation. The senses, i.e., the carnal desires, must
be changed, by lofty desire and a spiritual outlook, to the holy
emotions such as love, affection, generosity, forgiveness and a
native graciousness.
These kindly emotions are the "workmen" that chip off the
rough edges of the "stone" until finally it becomes smooth,
"square" and polished. This is then the Christos brought into
consciousness by the Alchemical Transmutation.
Throughout the "work" God must be the incentive. By
"God" is meant all that is good in man. All the goodly emotions
such as those already enumerated are the forces that will take
the place of the carnal, evil, destructive desires and passions
until finally the temple has become purified, the stone rolled
away, the Christos arisen, the Light shining forth, the Holy
Spirit come into the Temple; BY THIS MEANS MAN HAS BECOME
THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT OF THE ROSE CROSS.

BERIGARD OF PISA

LAUDE Gu1LLERMET DE BERIGARD (Beauregard), chemist,
Alchemist and philosopher, was born in Moulins, France,
in 1567. While still a youth he became

ROSY CROSS the study. At nineteen he left for Paris
~ and there sought out the brethren of
the Society founded there earlier. He took up the study of
Alchemy and the Arcanum leading to Philosophic Initiation.
He was so well advanced esoterically that he became a member
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 165
of the Great Council1 and one of the co-founders of the Fra-
ternitas Ros<e Crucis.
At twenty-four he entered the Sorbonne at Paris, but there
is no record of how long he remained. However, his erudition
was such that later he was appointed professor of Natural
Philosophy at the University of Pisa, where he remained until
1640.
Because of his long stay at Pisa, and his fame as an instructor,
he became known as Berigard of Pisa, and considered by many
as an Italian.
Shortly after leaving the position in the University of Pisa
he was offered and accepted a similar position at Padua, which
he held until just four years before his death in 1664.
His first and most important book dealing with science was
Dubitationes in Diagohum Ealil<ei pro Terra immobilitate
published at Florence in 1632. His second and best known
work was Circulus Pisanus, published at Udine, in 1643.
Berigard's Alchemical writings are much after the style of the
later Helvetius and require identical interpretations to be
understood.
While Berigard must be considered as one of the lesser lights
when compared with Agrippa, Madathanas and others, never-
theless, due to the fact that he did attain to Philosophic Initia-
tion and became a ROSE CROSS and was one of the co-founders
of the Fraternitas, he has an honored place in the Rosicruciari's
physical and spiritual temple.

"the World Council" and "the Great Council." Members of the Great
Council were those who were active only within their own country or
countries adjacent to their own. Members of the World Council were
such members of the Fraternity who were not limited in their activities.

the Alchemists and refusing all offers, he proceeded with his
experiments. Following Paracelsus, he continued the revolu-
tionizing of the practice of medicine as taught by Galen and
the Arabians. Van Helmont was the first known to have
recognized the function of the stomach and its relationship to
the other organs of the body. His many experiments led him
to the discovery of the aerial substance which he named "gas,"
a substance without a body; carbonic acid gas being one of his
discoveries.

his interest in Chemistry, although in his case, contrary to the

chemistry the medium for experimentation in seeking for the

water was the FIRST MATTER because it was the symbol of mind

as a consequence of this, both the worlds have not a great

the Scriptures? Yea, but that which is therein inculcated must be
accepted by faith, whereas, Alchemy teachings illustrate the
Why and the HOIV, the MEANS TO THE END.
In his De Vita JEtherna, Van Helmont tells us that: "I have
seen and I have touched the Philosopher's Stone more than
once; the color, it was like saffron powder, but heavy and
shining pounded glass."
The Philosopher's Stone is the WORK ACCOMPLISHED. This is
made manifest and may be touched in the sense that it is part of
the self. The Light which manifests to the sight of the Phil-
osophic Initiate is of a color,—FOR is NOT SPIRITUAL COLOR A

transmutation. Van Helmont cryptically tells us he has com-
pleted the inner work and proved it by his statement of what
the Stone is.
Van Helmont's work was recognized by those high in
authority and it is on record that he received flattering offers
from the Emperor and Elector Palatine with complete freedom
of action guaranteed to him.

Another work by D'FAc:;pagnet is Arcanum Philosophice

Hermetic<e, better known as the Canons of Espagnet. Consider-
able confusion has existed relative to this work because, as
reported in the Dictionnaire des Science Occultes:
Ce chevalier, tres-reveree des Alchemistes, est mentionnee
souvent dans la Trompette Francaise, petit volume, contenant
une Prophetic de Bombast sur la Naissance de Louis XIV. On
a, du Chevalier Imperial, le Miroir des Alchemistes, avec in-

Our own American Alchemist, Hitchcock, considered this
as D'Espagnet's best work and compared his writings to those
of Basil Valentine, showing that D'Espagnet was wholly en-
gaged in the Work of spiritual alchemy:
"The light of this knowledge is the gift of God, which,
by his freeness he bestowed upon whom he pleased." This

Hermeticte, better known as the Cll1lons of Espagnet. Consider-
able confusion has existed relative to this work because, as
reported in the Dictionnaire des Science Occultes:
Ce chevalier, tres-reveree des Alchemistes, est mentionnee
souvent dll1ls la Trompette Francaise, petit voltmze, contenant
une Prophetic de Bombast sur la Naissance de Louis XIV. On
a, du Chevalier Imperial, le Miroir des Alchemistes, avec in-
structions aux dames pour dorenavent etre belles sll1ls plus user
de leurs dards venimeux, 16oc), 16 mo.
Our own American Alchemist, Hitchcock, considered this
as D'Espagnet's best work and compared his writings to those
of Basil Valentine, showing that D'Espagnet was wholly en-
gaged in the Work of spiritual alchemy:
"The light of this knowledge is the gift of God, which,
by his freeness he bestowed upon whom he pleased." This
statement is in accordance with St. John 3:8: "The wind
bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cameth, and whither
it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." "Let
none, therefore, set himself to the study thereof [alchemy],
until, having cleared ll1ld purified bis heart, he devotes
himself wholly unto God, and be emptied of all affection
to things impure." In this we have the Arcanum contain-

requireth the whole man; and being found, possesseth him,
and being possessed, challengeth him from all long and
serious employment, esteeming all other things as strange
unto him, and of no value."
This command, though severe, is not as strong as that of the
Biblical writer of Philippians 3: 8: "Yea doubtless, and I count

all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus
Christ my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
and do count them but dung, that I may win [become] Christ
[Cbristos]."
"Let him that is desirous of this knowledge clear his
mind from all evil notions, especially pride, which is an
abomination to heaven, and the gate to hell. Let him
frequently be at prayer [devotion], and charitable; have
little to do with the world; abstain from too much com-
pany keeping, and enjoy constant tranquility, that the
mind may be able to reason more freely in private, and
be more highly lifted up; for unless it be kindled with a
beam of Divine Light [the Arcanum], it will hardly be
able to penetrate the hidden mysteries of truth.
"A studious Tyro of a quick wit, constant mind, in-
flamed with love of philosophy, very skillful in natural
philosophy of a pure heart, perfect in manners, mightily
devoted to God, may with confidence enter the highway
of Nature, and peruse the books of the best philosophers.
Let him seek out an ingenious [and ingenuous] com-
panion for himself, and not despair of accomplishing his
desire [the Great Work]."
It is easily conceivable why D'Espagnet was called a convert
to Trevisan. Certainly after reading the few excerpts from his
"Canons" no one would consider D'Espagnet a practical al-
chemist.
Hitchcock interprets D'Espagnet correctly when he tells us
that the subject of the Great Work is MAN, God's chief instru-
ment and co-worker. That alchemy is not a work of the hands,
but of the heart; that the aim is to discover the true Fire, the
creator of the Light of the Soul, without which man is mortal;
an animal with a brain and reasoning power, more cruel than
any creature on earth.

D'Espagnet continues in his "Canons":
"Let a Lover of Truth make use of but a few authors,
but select those of best note and who have experienced
truth; let him suspect things that are quickly understood,
especially in mystical names and secret operations; for
truth lies hidden in obscurity; nor do philosophers ever
write more deceitfully than when plainly, nor ever more
truly than when obscurely."
As for himself, he studied and recommends the works of
Hermes, Morienus Tomanus, Count Trevisan and Raymond
Lully.
It may be said with truth that D'Espagnet was steeped in
Mysticism. We may admit this and counter that this being
true, what must be said of some of these Biblical writers who
gave the laws to those who sought to become true Christians,
or followers of the Christie regime? Were these not far more
drastic in their commands? Did they not offer only faith, while
the Philosophic Initiates assured an accomplishment? Let critics
give thought to this.
Jean D'Espagnet was one of the truly great early Rose Cross
and remained faithful to his trust until the end of his days,
passing away in peace in 1630.
Jean D'Espagnet, though a Rose Cross, did not mention the
Fraternitas he helped to bring to birth, because his books were
all published prior to the birth of the Rosy Cross as such in 1614.

MICHAEL MAIER
MICHAEL MAIER was born in Rindsburg, in Holstein, No-
vember 26, 1568. He studied medicine and became the
physician to Emperor Rudolph II, and
was ennobled by the Emperor. Shortly
after beginning the study of medicine
he came in contact with men who were
deeply concerned with Alchemy and
the Arcane Science, and found them so
intriguing that medicine soon took sec-
ond place in his nature.
Maier was thirty years of age when
he became a member of the then active
College of Teutonic Philosophers 1 and was soon the most active
instructor of its Acolyte in Alchemical science and the Occult.
Contrary to the general conception of many writers who never
belonged to the Rosy Cross, this was not in any sense a Rosi-
crucian Body, because at that period, 1600, the Fratemitas
Ros<e Crucis had not yet been formally inaugurated and the
various Occult Orders and Societies were operating separately,
while Alchemists and Hermetists were engaged in individual
practice.
1 Prior to 1614, very few Occult and Arcane activities were known by
names which actually signified the work in which they were engaged.
Thus this Teutonic or Germanic College, indicating by its designation
that it was composed of German students interested in general in things
German, was wholly composed of students engaged in the forbidden
science. This common practice was followed as a means of protection;
those belonging thereto having in mind the fate of the earlier brethren,
the Templars.
Maier indicates this clearly by stating in his publications that the
Fraternity (Ros<e Crucis) was preceded by the College of Gymno-
sophists among the Ethiopians, the College of the Magi among the Ver-
sions, the College of Brahmins in India and various other organizations,
such as the Alchemists of Arabia under Geber and the later Brethren of
the Hermetists.

Maier has always been considered as an Alchemist and this
is strongly indicated in his earlier public writings. It was not
until the various Occult and Spiritual organizations combined
into one activity under the name Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis, and
Maier became the first Supreme Grand Master, that his writings
changed and he became a vigorous defender of the Fraternity.
By adherence, Maier, like the greater number of students and
Masters of things Occult, between the time of Luther and an
hundred years after the formation of the Fraternitas Ros<e
Crucis, was a staunch Lutheran. In general, the Lutheran Re-
formation had brought about a considerable degree of freedom
from persecution by the Roman Hierarchy and the State but
it cannot be too frequently repeated that these early Initiates
clearly remembered what had befallen the Templars, those
early Christian Initiates, as is more or less indicated in the FAMA.
In 1615 Robert Fludd, the great English Alchemist, visited
Maier in Germany and was there initiated into the outer pre-
cepts of the Fraternity. On his return to England, Fludd began
to consolidate all students of Alchemy, Occult Arts and Arcane
Science for the purpose of forming an English body of the
Fraternitas Ros<e Crusis. This was completed when Maier
visited England approximately 2 two years later and remained
with Dr. Fludd at his home in Bearsted for some time. During

BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 179
After the release of the FAMA to the public and the contro-
versy which quickly followed and convulsed the learned of
that day, Maier took a vigorous and enthusiastic part in the
verbal conflict, writing a number of books in defense of the
principles for which the Fraternity stood. At the same time,
Maier travelled considerably that he might personally contact
those who either belonged to the Fraternity or were of a nature
desirable to the Fraternity.
Maier was a really great Alchemist, a Philosophic Initiate of
the highest order. He was a voluminous writer, nevertheless,
his books are extremely scarce and not even found in many of
the great libraries of the Initiates themselves who have so
sacredly kept the traditions of the Fraternity.
Among these publications may be noted the following:
Arcane Arcanissrma. Published in 1613, and released in 1614.
This book was written prior to the inauguration of the Fra-
ternitas and in it he gives the line of descent of those men and
activities who composed the original body of the Fraternity.
Physio Quadrato. Published in 1616.
Lusus Serins. Published in 1617. This book was in publica-
tion while Maier was in England visiting Fludd. It is purely
Alchemical in its inculcation, though it is well to understand
that one who has practiced the Alchemical formula, and by way
of it has attained to the spiritual consummation of the WORK, is
an Initiate, therefore a Rose Cross.
Symbola Aure<e Mensa>. A work on Alchemy.
Jocus Severus. Published in 1617. This book is on mystical
symbology and deals with a Parliament of Birds, of which the
Phoenix was the President and Judge. To the greater number
of even occult students this work appears to be somewhat of a
satire and uninterpretable, therefore meaningless. However,
August Fraternity. In all instances, then as now, the Grand and Supreme
Grand Masters must also be members of the Council of Three.

that day, Maier took a vigorous and enthusiastic part in the
verbal conflict, writing a number of books in defense of the
principles for which the Fraternity stood. At the same time,
Maier travelled considerably that he might personally contact
those who either belonged to the Fraternity or were of a nature
desirable to the Fraternity.
Maier was a really great Alchemist, a Philosophic Initiate of
the highest order. He was a voluminous writer, nevertheless,
his books are extremely scarce and not even found in many of
the great libraries of the Initiates themselves who have so
sacredly kept the traditions of the Fraternity.
Among these publications may be noted the following:
Arcane Arcanissima. Published in 1613, and released in 1614.
This book was written prior to the inauguration of the Fra-
ternitas and in it he gives the line of desceut of those men and
activities who composed the original body of the Fraternity.
Physio Quadrato. Published in 1616.
Lusus Serius. Published in 1617. This book was in publica-
tion while Maier was in England visiting Fludd. It is purely
Alchemical in its inculcation, though it is well to understand
that one who has practiced the Alchemical fonnula, and by way
of it has attained to the spiritual consummation of the WoRK, is
an Initiate, therefore a Rose Cross.
Sy111bola Aurete Mensa:. A '\\.·ork on Alchemy.
]ocus Severus. Published in 1617. This book is on mntical
symbology and deals with a Parliament of Birds, of which the
Phoenix was the President and Judge. To the greater number
of even occult students this work appears to be somewhat of a
satire and uninterpretable, therefore meaningless. However,
August Fraternity. In all instances. then as now, the Grand and Supreme
Grand Masters must also be members of the Council of Three.
i8o ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
while it is wholly symbolical, it is neither meaningless nor
worthless. The key to its interpretation is found in Bunyan's
Pilgrmfs Progress. Every animal has its meaning. There are
those representing the destructive passions in the heart of men;
those who symbolize the Fire through which the Phoenix
passed in order to receive a renewal of life. This ends in the
transfiguration, the descension of the Holy Ghost (Immortal-
ized Soul—in the form of Fire or Light) from the transmuted
body. This is the Work. He who succeeds is a Rose Cross.
Herein is the Great Mystery.
Examen Fucorum Pseudo-Chemicorum Detectorum. Pub-
lished in 1617.
Silent in in Post Clamor es. Published in 1617. This deals ex-
clusively with the Rosy Cross and has been understood by very
few students, consequently it is considered as of little value,
never-the-less, like his other works, it hides a great secret.
The controversy, as to whether such a mystical Fraternity
did or did not exist, was then in full swing. Charlatans of every
description were active everywhere. They made claims of be-
longing to the Fraternity in order to profit thereby. Maier's
book gave the answer. Those who were of the Fraternity un-
derstood, to others it was jargon. To true seekers it offered the
way by a test of faith which has been employed by members
of the Fraternity throughout its entire history.
Its effort was to discourage those who were self-interested
and in whose heart there was no spiritual desire to become a
Rose Cross through faith, material abnegation, obedience and
self-effort.
It held forth a promise, but great faith and a deep search was
necessary to obtain the desired contact. Charlatans were ex-
posed. The weak fell by the wayside. The true seekers found
the way and were accepted. To the ignorant the book was
nothing less than Alchemical jargon, possibly braggadocio; to

prove their fitness; fitness alone being the "word" of
acceptance.

would reveal will be denied the secret; the shallowness of
the babbler being the closed door to the Wisdom of the

Only the wise are blessed. This is a trite fact and follows
the Solomonic request: GIVE ME WISDOM. Those who are
wise are so BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE WISDOM
THAT WILL PREVENT THEM FROM COMMITTING ERROR. ThoSC
who do not commit error are free from sin, consequently
there is no evil in them; being free from evil, they are free
from the consciousness of guilt, and where there is no
consciousness of guilt there can be no unhappiness, con-
sequently there is the peace which, according to St.
Matthew, is heaven; i.e., a state of blessedness. The com-
mand is: "Seek ye wisdom." In doing this you will ulti-
mately find that all other things will be added; this is
the blessedness which is found only in the "kingdom of
heaven."
Unhappiness is necessarily the reward of the fool-
ish. The foolish commit all manner of error; they are
guilty of evil, and evil leads them into the byways of the
unwary. Every foolish act is an erroneous one; every
erroneous act brings a penalty and this penalty brings
about sorrow. Foolish acts, being necessarily evil, create a
guilty conscience and a guilty conscience is always an
unhappy one.
The unwise and foolish cannot become Rose Cross until

BOOK OF ROSICRUCiiE
Only the wise llTe blessed. This is a trite fact and follows
the Solomonic request: GIVE ME WISDOM. Those who are
wise are so BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE WISDOM
THAT WILL PREVENT THEM FROM COMMITTING ERROR. Those
who do not conunit error are free from sin, consequently
there is no evil in them; being free from evil, they are free
from the consciousness of guilt, and where there is no
consciousness of guilt there can be no unhappiness, con-
sequently there is the peace which, according to St.
Matthew, is heaven; i.e., a state of blessedness. The com-
mand is: "Seek ye wisdom." In doing this you will ulti-
mately find that all other things will be added; this is
the blessedness which is found only in the "kingdom of
heaven."
Unhappiness is necessarily the reward of the fool-
ish. The foolish commit all manner of error; they are
guilty of evil, and evil leads them into the byways of the
unwary. Every foolish act is an erroneous one; every
erroneous act brings a penalty and this penalty brings
about sorrow. Foolish acts, being necessarily evil, create a
guilty conscience and a guilty conscience is always an
unhappy one.
The unwise and foolish cannot become Rose Cross until
such time, due to their unhappiness, they seek wisdom;
gaining this, they follow the Way.

ceived a spiritual name, not from the Order or the brethren, but
from the Spiritual Hierarchy, and this spiritual name contained
within itself the virtue of the Initiate.
Thus, throughout all the record, everyone's spiritual name
is given in addition to the baptismal name. This name implied:
"One who has faithfully applied himself has received the
spiritual marriage name Hilarion."
This name implies that having attained to the second birth,
the Mystical Marriage; the spirit has undergone a radical
change. The human transmuted; the spirit has gained in
strength, because of the regeneration and transition. This is
clearly indicated by the contents of the book in question.
The transmutation of "metal" is indicated, but not as it
would be interpreted by the profane. These "metals" are
the material desires and longings of the animal man. These
metals, by the change of desire, have been spiritualized to
a degree that the operator—Maier—has become spiritualized
and prepared for the transition, consequently he tells us
of the fundamentals of this NEW life into which he has
entered and is about to enter much farther.
These fundamentals are:
God, the eternal, was the Father-Creator; being without
end he necessarily was without beginning. He [It] is an
incorruptible Fire; that is, pure and undefiling, and every-
thing that has passed through this fire is without blemish.
He [It] is an everlasting Light; that is, the "Light which
is to be found on neither land nor sea," but ONLY in the
redeemed [REgenerated] Soul of Man.
This spirit of God is greater than his body, the earth;
because only in this spirit, i.e., Fire is there Life and
continuity, and the degree of life in man is in proportion
to the degree of the spiritual fire he has been able to bring
into manifestation by regenerate acts.

At the age of seventeen, Fludd entered St. John's College,
Oxford, and five years later in 1596, he received his first degree

as Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Arts in 1598. Shortly there-
after he decided to take up medicine. He left England to prose-
cute his studies on the Continent, going to France, where, at
Avignon, he became acquainted and fully inoculated with the
doctrines of the Arcane Science; thence to Spain, Italy and
later, Germany.
In Germany he became conversant with, and converted to,
the Paracelsian theory of medicine and the Arcane Science
Paracelsus had formulated. It was at this time also that he
became acquainted with those who were to become the Breth-
ren of the ROSY CROSS then in formation and from whom he
received his initiatory instructions.1
The record shows that on July 10, 1607 he was enrolled as an
Acolyte in Hermetic Science, this being the general term applied
to the studies of the Brethren. He first met Maier on November
9,1615, was admitted to the newly founded Fraternitas February
8, 1616 and made Grand Master of England, July 8, 1617, by
Maier, when he visited England. At this same time he was made

Perhaps without exception, writers and even the best of research work-

This is as utterly impossible as it is for the sun to rise in the West. No
man, however good or kind, can be made, or Initiated, as, or into, a
Rosicrucian. This is no more possible than that a man can become a
Christian by accepting the tenets or being accepted into a church. Unless
Christ is in his heart, and his thoughts, acts and feelings are in full accord
with Christic laws and principles, he is only a believer; an acceptor. This
is equally true with the ROSE CROSS.
Even though one receives initiatory instructions and guidance, if there
is not full renunciation of evil and the transmutation thereof into the
Light so that the Rose may appear upon the crucified Cross, he cannot
become a Rose Cross. Men are not, cannot, be made ROSE CROSS, they
become such only by deliberate, conscious effort.
The statement by any writer that one has been made or initiated a
Rosicrucian is in itself evidence that he was wholly lacking in the
knowledge of the Arcanum.

In 1609 he received his degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of
Medicine. His proficiency in medical practice was such that
five years later he became a Fellow of the College of Physicians
and, according to the record, was Censor for the years 1618,
1627, 1633 and 1634.
Fludd went to London shortly after receiving his medical
degrees and took up practice as a Physician. His first residence
was in Fenchurch Street, later in Coleman Street. Fludd had
his own medicines compounded after the manner of Paracelsus,
but actually depended more on his innate powers of healing than
on drugs. This was due in part to his mastery of the Paracels-

Gilbert, a doctor of medicine, but much given to what he
termed "magnetic induction."
That Dr. Gilbert was in no sense a charlatan, nor so con-
sidered at the time is indicated by the fact that he was elected
as a Fellow of the College at Oxford in 1573 and appointed
physician-inordinary to Queen Elizabeth, and after her death,
to King James I. Dr. Gilbert's work "De Magnete magnet-

purity of the inculcations of the Fraternity and the innocence

all who truly desire and seek) Solomon was well advanced,
because he had learned to know the secret powers hidden
in all things, even in the lowest matter.
He points out that in the tenets of the Fraternity hap-
piness is promised those who have become miserable as a
result of the sins of Adam. He refers, of course, to the
creative Arcanum, and he indicates that this happiness can
be brought about only by a willingness to serve "Christ,"
i.e., by a return to an obedience of the Law, thereby en-
abling the Acolytes to bring the Christos, so long buried
within, beneath ages of debris, into Consciousness, and by
doing so, becoming a Rose Cross.
In his Apology Fludd indicates his own modesty and
nobility by telling us that there is nothing greater than to
become even the lowest associate in the Fraternity, because
it is only by a true willingness to begin at the bottom or
lowest rung of the ladder that man can attain; that he who
seeks to become a Master must be ready and anxious to be
first a servant.
He further tells us that his spouse is called desire of Wis-
dom and his children the fruits. This informs us that our
search must be for the Divine Sophia, that only thus may
the effort bring forth the Conscious Soul, she who is the
"Queen of Heaven."
The reason for being known as one of the Brethren of
Light or a Philosopher of Fire is clearly indicated in his
first work, in his description of God as the Ens entium, the
pure igneous or fiery inviolate existence. Light and fire are
the cause of all energy, the sun being composed of fire
manifested as light.
The Ens is the innermost spirit of all things. It is die
God of the universe. It is the vital water of the atomic
bomb. It is the heat which gives life to all creatures; the
volatile substance in vegetables which gives us life. But it

194 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
all who truly desire and seek) Solomon was well advanced,
because he had learned to know the secret powers hidden
in all things, even in the lowest matter.
He points out that in the tenets of the Fraternity hap-
piness is promised those who have become miserable as a
result of the sins of Adam. He refers, of course, to the
creative Arcanum, and he indicates that this happiness can
be brought about only by a willingness to serve "Christ,"
i.e., by a return to an obedience of the Law, thereby en-
abling the Acolytes to bring the Christos, so long buried
within, beneath ages of debris, into Consciousness, and by
doing so, becoming a Rose Cross.
In his Apology Fludd indicates his own modesty and
nobility by telling us that there is nothing greater than to
become even the lowest associate in the Fraternity, because
it is only by a true willingness to begin at the bottom or
lowest rung of the ladder that man can attain; that he who
seeks to become a Master must be ready and anxious to be
first a servant.
He further tells us that his spouse is called desire of Wis-
dom and his children the fruits. This informs us that our
search must be for the Divine Sophia, that only thus may
the effort bring forth the Conscious Soul, she who is the
"Queen of Heaven."
The reason for being known as one of the Brethren of
Light or a Philosopher of Fire is clearly indicated in his
first work, in his description of God as the Ens emium, the
pure igneous or fiery inviolate existence. Light and fire are
the cause of all energy, the sun being composed of fire
manifested as light.
The Ens is the innermost spirit of all things. It is the
God of the universe. It is the vital water of the atomic
bomb. It is the heat which gives life to all creatures; the
volatile substance in vegetables which gives us life. But it

is more. It is the Holy Ghost of high heaven; the Light of
the Soul of Conscious man. It is that which the Neophyte
must seek, develop and bring into manifestation before he
is a ROSE CROSS. Such was the constantly reiterated doc-
trine of Fludd, and because of it he became known as one
of the Brethren of Light.
Even among the prefounders and actual founders of the
ROSE CROSS there was none who so thoroughly understood what
Fludd terms the MYSTERY OF LIGHT. He constantly reiterated
this fact and was positive in his statements that those who had
come to KNOW the Light, that is, COME INTO THE LIGHT, were
blessed indeed because these had a full taste of Immortality
here and now.
Sometimes he would employ the phrases of the church and
speak of Christ, but always in conjunction with the Light,
recognizing that the Christos in man when fully awakened,
appeared in the form of a pure Light; that God did not appear
otherwise to men, and that when man attained to the Baptism
of Fire, the Holy Ghost then descended upon them, i.e., came
from heaven (above) to Baptize them, this being the second
or Spiritual Birth; in other words, the Initiation, or becoming a
Rose Cross. Had Fludd never mentioned the Rosicrucians, this
alone would have been his signature as a ROSE CROSS.

resurrection of either the body or Soul or both, but the leading
of an ennobled or spiritual life HERE AND NOW. It speaks of the
"death" of the mortal or animal body through Alchemical
transmutation and sublimation, and the resulting return to
life; the resurrection of the Mystical Phoenix which has re-
turned to life through purification by fire and now lives in the
Light, self-sustaining. This is the WORK of Initiation; that of
the spiritual Alchemist of whom Fludd was one of the greatest,
not only of his, but of any day.
Fludd points out by symbolism that sin is death; that
through sin the Soul lost Paradise or the blessed estate;
having lost it, man must now make the necessary effort to
regain the Paradise Lost, and that this is not possible until
such a time as he has performed the GREAT WORK of the
Alchemists and has freed the pure gold from the ore in
which it is imprisoned. While the language used by him
is that of the fifteenth century alchemists, literally inter-
preted, the instructions differ in nowise from those given
Neophytes of today.
After a lengthy investigation in many countries, Fludd admits
through this book that the Brethren of the Rosy Cross alone
have attained to Illumination as a result of living according to
the Law taught them, and that they alone are the proper per-
sons to teach and guide those who seek the truth, the way and
the life. Through obeying the Law and living within the Law
they have transmuted the carnal desires within themselves into
the Light which is acceptable to the Cosmic Father as Divine
Grace. Moreover, having received the Light, or more correctly
speaking, having brought the Light into manifestation, as a
result of consuming or transmuting and sublimating the gross
and carnal within themselves the Holy Spirit, i.e., the Holy
Ghost, not only descended upon them at the consummation of

Likewise, man, the Microcosm or little world, is a re-

Macrocosm. Everything is in order; the Universe after
(fashioned after) God or the Creator; man, the creature,
patterned after the greater or, Macrocosm.

free Will and sets at naught all of God's and Nature's Laws
and is therefore in constant chaos, while the Universe obeys

Ultimately man must awaken to the facts that even with
Free Will, he is under the Law and must obey the Law

This second part or book of the Historia is of inestimable
value to the mystic who is religiously, rather than occultly in-

may actually be used as a spiritual ritual. This work, like the
former volumes, clearly indicates that Fludd's mind was most
spiritually inclined and that the signature Brother of Light is
not amiss.
Even in his treatise on disease, Fludd cannot disassociate him-
self and his thoughts from the spiritually basic ideas of fire
Light. To him the Divinity, God, is of the nature of pure Light.
He agrees with the philosophy of Trismegistus that God
is the Light which is hidden in darkness, i.e., man's ignoble
body, which, when transmuted and sanctified', permits the
Light, which is the Soul, to become Conscious, to manifest

In this explanation Fludd cannot help reverting to the Al-
chemical formula that the body, spirit and Soul have their
counterpart in earth, air and fire, i.e., the Alchemists sal,
mercurium et sulphur. As a whole, Fludd bases most of his
teachings in this book on Biblical writings, citing book
after book to prove his contention.
In 1621 Fludd issued the second part of the second volume
entitled: De praeternaturali utriusque mundi Historia in Sec-
tiones tres divisa, and of which the first section bore the title
De Theosophico Cabalistico et Physologici utrhisque mundi
discursu, in Portiones tres diviso* Fludd, Frankfort, Erasmi
Kempfferi, sumptibus Joan. Theodori de Bry, anno 1621.
The great value of this work is in the fact that like some of his
former work, it deals with the Philosophy of Fire, i.e., the true
Rosicrucian doctrine forming the basis of Philosophic Initiation
through which Neophytes must pass in order to become Breth-
ren of the Light.
The Arcanum is in this: The Lord talked with Moses
face to face on the mount, out of the midst of fire. It is in
this manner only that God may appear to man; conse-
quently God is the Light which is the Fire. Since man's
Soul is a part of God, it is certain that man's Soul, once it
has gained the awakening and become Conscious, also is a
Fire and appears as Light. Where there is Light out of
darkness, i.e., out of the body of man which is ALL dark-
ness, it is certain that there is a Soul which is part of God,
and it is this God, or Light within, which the Neophyte

entitled: De praeternaturali utriusque mundi Historia in Sec-
tiones tres divisa, and of which the first section bore the title
De Theosophico Cabalistico et Physologici utriusque mundi
discursu, in Portiones tres diviso.2
Fludd, Frankfort, Erasmi
Kempfferi, sumptibus Joan. Theodori de Bry, anno 1621.
The great value of this work is in the fact that like some of his
former work, it deals with the Philosophy of Fire, i.e., the true
Rosicrucian doctrine forming the basis of Philosophic Initiation
through which Neophytes must pass in order to become Breth-
ren of the Light.
The Arcanum is in this: The Lord talked with Moses
face to face on the mount, out of the midst of fire. It is in
this manner only that God may appear to man; conse-
quently God is the Light which is the Fire. Since man's
Soul is a part of God, it is certain that man's Soul, once it
has gained the awakening and become Conscious, also is a
Fire and appears as Light. Where there is Light out of
darkness, i.e., out of the body of man which is ALL dark-
ness, it is certain that there is a Soul which is part of God,
and it is this God, or Light within, which the Neophyte

seeks to bring into manifestation, and in doing this, BE-
COMES A ROSE CROSS.
God is beyond, yet within all, and this concerns man
especially. He is beyond man because man is unconscious
of his presence and to all intent and purpose, in as far as
that "dead" man is concerned, God might be a million
miles away. Nevertheless, God is in Man, in the spirit
which exists in the unconscious Soul.
This spirit or Spark is a dormant FIRE which, by DESIRE
and EFFORT, may be aroused and brought into conscious-
ness, and when this is accomplished, it is a Conscious part
of God, an Awakened Soul, and it is GOD; it/he, is a ROSE
CROSS.
The next Arcanum is: Light is really the invisible Word
of God. Now all men seeking Initiation seek the WORD;
that Word which has become (entered) flesh. The Word
is in the Light and he who brings the Light into manifesta-
tion has found the (Lost) Word. That again is Philo-
sophic Initiation.
The next Arcanum is: ALL (that is) subsists in it (the
Light). If this Light did not exist there would be no Fire,
no warmth, no life and all would be as dead, and in fact,
Biblically speaking, "Dead in Christ" (the Christos), be-
cause the Christos, in the form of Light is dormant in man,
consequently man is indeed dead in Christos or the Light
of the Soul, and must/will remain so until such a time as
he makes a conscious effort to find this Christ and bring
it in the Light of day, i.e., into manifestation.
The next Arcanum is: The Light being with God, is the
eternal glory, this glory being the Holy Ghost. It is the
Image of the Invisible, i.e., the-as-not-yet-made-manifest;
it is the essence, i.e., the spirit of divinity, and further it is
the Light in the world, that world being the little universe,
that is, the Microcosm—MAN. But man is "dead" in

until he becomes conscious of other than the carnal self
and begins to seek the real, i.e., the Word which is the
Light of man.

awakening and bringing the Light into Consciousness, is
lighted, that is, is brought, has brought himself by effort,

ing the Soul, the becoming Soul Conscious.
The next Arcanum is in this: The Light may not be seen
by human eyes, by the eyes of those not yet baptized by
the water which is mental awakening, but with the spirit
with which God has endowed man. How did God endow
man? By giving into the keeping of man a part of himself;
a spark of the Divine Soul. This Soul is dormant and being
dormant, man has no more than human eyes and cannot
see it; but when man is baptized with the spirit he has
succeeded in at least partially awakening this dormant
spark, and this being the "coming into the spirit," he will
be able to see the manifestation of the Light by this spirit
and to the degree of its awakening.
The next Arcanum is that of Alchemical operation and is
most simply taught: This spirit which is the Light of the
Soul cannot be seen until the Body, i.e., the carnal passions,
the unholy desires, the impure thoughts, have been purified
and made clean, that is, TRANSMUTED, that is, become like
the body of Christ (the being of Christos). No alchemist,
beginning with Geber unto the present day, has so clearly
indicated the WORK. There is no equivocation here: NOT
UNTIL THE BODY—ALL THAT IS OF MORTAL, CARNAL MAN, HAS
BEEN PURIFIED, MADE CLEAN;—C3tt this which is the WORD,
be seen, or made manifest, only then is one a ROSE CROSS.

204 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Giving the consideration due these Arcanums it will
readily be perceived WHY Fludd has been named as one of
the Brethren of Light and one of the greatest of the
Spiritual Alchemists.
In 1626, Fludd published his Philosophia Sacra et vere Chris-
tiana seu Meterologia Cosmica, Francofurti prostat in Officina
Bryana, 1626. This work is not considered by ROSE CROSS as of
such great importance as most of his other texts.
Fludd's next work was Sophi<e cum Moria Certamen, in quo
Lapis Lydius a Falso Structore, Fr. Marmo Mersenno, Monacho
Reprobatus, celeberrima Voluminis sui Babylonici (in Genesin)
figmenta accurate examinat. Authore Roberto Fludd, alias de
Fluctibus, Franfurt, 1629.
This was an answer to an attack by one Mersenne, entitled
Guestiones Celeberrim<e, cum accurata textus explicatione, in
quo volumine Athei et Deisti impugnantur, Paris, 1622, in
which the writer clearly showed that he no more understood
the writings by Fludd than the profane writers of that day,
since that day, and of today, understand the arcane and do not
possess the slightest conception of what it is to be a ROSE
CROSS.
Fludd's next publication was Sunnum Bonum, Quod est
Verum Subjectum Ver<e Magirt, Cabal<e, Alchymi<e Fratrum
Rose<e Crucis verorum, in dictarum Scientiarum louden, et
insignis calumniatoris Fratis Marini Mersenni dedecus publi-
catum, Per Joachimum Frizium. Anno 1629. This is a truly
Kabbalistic work and of first importance. Unfortunately,
Fludd, who despised controversy of any nature, used a
pseudonym, believing this would more quickly end the matter
than if he continued to defend himself. In defense of what he
had taught, he returned to his first publication, the FAMA,
thereby showing that all his writings were within the word and
spirit of Fraternitas in which he thoroughly believed because
he had been able to manifest the Work, or Christos, in his own

life and, contrary to his accusers and defamers, he wrote of
what he KNEW to be truth, and not as of mere belief.
Fludd also was attacked by one Franciscus Lanovius and
another writer, Petrus Gassendus. Fludd answered these writers
in his Epistolica Exercitatio, in qua pr<ecipua principia philoso-
phic ROBERT FLUDDI deteguntur, et ad recentes illius libros
adversus Patrem Mariutn Mersennum scriptos respondetur,
Paris, 1630.
It is perhaps needless to say that the men who attacked Fludd
were churchmen who naturally considered anything and every-
thing written by the Alchemists or the members of every other
Arcane society as works of the devil. If they did not actually
believe this, they at least tried to make the people believe it.
In 1633, Fludd published his last work and his final answer
to those who had attacked him: Gassendi, Lanovius and
Mersenne, in his Clavis Philosophic et Alchemyi<e Fluddan<e,

Frcmcoforti, Anno 1633.
A year after Fludd's death came the publication of his Phil-
osophia Moysaica, Gouda, 1639, and in 1659 an English Trans-
lation of this work under the title Mosaicall Philosophy;
Grounded upon the Essential Truth or Eternal Sapience, first
written in Latin, and afterwards thus rendered into English, by
Robert Fludd, Esq., and Doctor of Physick.
In his last work, written a considerable time before his death,
Fludd again reverted to the Rosicrucian principles contained
in the FAMA and his own Fire and Light Philosophy, and this
was a fitting monument to one of the greatest of all Initiate
Brethren.
We have made no mention of Fludd's lesser works, nor of
his medical texts, because we do not think these important
enough in a work of this nature. Our aim has been to deal only

Shortly after he began the study of
medicine and chemistry he became ac-

this acquaintanceship he became interested in the Great Work
and the activities of the Philosophic Initiates who were then
occupied in the formation of the Fraternitas. He was enrolled
when but twenty-two and by the time he reached his twenty-
eighth year he had accomplished the Great Work, attained to
Philosophic Initiation, and was made a member of the World

Preferring solitude, Andrea nevertheless remained of a cheer-
ful disposition, and when not devoted to his numerous studies,
charmed all who came in contact with him.
In 1603, at the age of but seventeen, he became Baccalaureus
(Bachelor of Arts) and the beginning of his literary career dates
from this period. He wrote two theatrical plays, Esther and
Hyacinthe, receiving his inspiration from English authors.
In the year 1605 he was made Magister and shortly there-
after he began his theological studies and preached a number
of sermons. However, lack of sleep, due to a natural sensitive
nervous system and much overstudy, caused impaired vision,
mental and nervous exhaustion. Following this, as an aftermath
to an unfortunate wild students' frolic by his comrades, he was
obliged to interrupt his career. This caused him the loss of his
living and former bright prospect of entering into the ecclesi-
astical hierarchy and he was obliged to temporarily leave
Wurtenberg.8 The consequence was that from 1607 until
1614, he was constrained to a wandering life, that through
travel he might regain his health and find peace for his Soul.9
Thereafter he experienced a series of trials and misfortunes,
which, severe, instead of discouraging him, taught him many
things he might never have known, had he been able to remain
a simple Magister at Tubingen. These trials and misfortunes
were the beginning of making him the Great Master he
became.10
his death. It was through Chr. Besold that Andrea was first introduced
to the Occult, which was later to Immortalize him as one of the
Rose Cross.
* This seeming misfortune, forcing him to seek other activities, actually
was the beginning of his career in the Occult field.
* This search for the "Peace of his Soul" caused him to put into practice
the instructions, though elementary, he had received earlier from his
instructor Chr. Besold.

true seeker. Instead of doing this, they are the incentive to greater effort;

Preferring solitude, Andrea neverthel~ remained of a cheer-
ful disposition, and when not devoted to his numerous studies,
charmed all who came in contact with him.
In 1603, at the age of but seventeen, he became Baccalaureus
(Bachelor of Arts) and the beginning of his literary career dates
from this period. He wrote two theatrical plays, Esther and
Hyacinthe, receiving his inspiration from English authors.
In the year 1605 he was made Magister and shortly there-
after he began his theological studies and preached a number
of sermons. However, lack of sleep, due to a natural sensitive
nervous system and much overstudy, caused impaired vision,
mental and nervous exhaustion. Following this, as an aftermath
to an unfortunate wild students' frolic by his comrades, he was
obliged to interrupt his career. This caused him the loss of his
living and former bright prospect of entering into the ecclesi-
astical hierarchy and he was obliged to temporarily leave
Wurtenberg.1
The consequence was that from 16o7 until
1614' he was constrained to a wandering life, that through
travel he might regain his health and find peace for his Soul.9
Thereafter he experienced a series of trials and misfortunes,
which, severe, instead of discouraging him, taught him many
things he might never have known, had he been able to remain
a simple Magister at Tubingen. These trials and misfortunes
were the beginning of making him the Great Master he
became.10
his death. It was through Chr. Besold that Andrea was first introduced
to the Occult, which was later to Immonalize him as one of the
Rose Cross.
•This seeming misfomme, forcing him to seek other activities, actually
was the beginning of his career in the Occult field.
• This search for the "Peace of his Soul" caused him to put into practice
the instructions, though elementary, he had received earlier from his
instructor Chr. Besold.

Returning to Tubingen, he was refused reinstatement in his
former position by the Elector Hogan Frederick. He then
renounced all thought of an Ecclesiastical career and gave up
his theological studies.
At Lauingen,11 his second stop, he remained but a short time,
encountering conditions similar to those which were the cause
of his earlier misfortunes. Thence he proceeded to Dillingen,1*
where for a time he affiliated himself with the Jesuits.13 About
the year 1608 he returned to Tubingen and became preceptor
to the sons of a German gentleman named Truchsess, which
position he held through the year 1610. During his leisure he
learned to play the lute and guitar and became friendly with
the workmen and then, encouraged by his friend, he again took
up his theological studies.
The year 1610 became decisive in the life of Andrea. Once
more something within induced him to travel and renew his
search. He left for Switzerland, visiting Zurich and Basle and
thence to Geneva to study. Almost immediately he became
intimate with the preacher John Scaron.

student in the Occult should affiliate himself in any manner whatever with

Alchemy. Albertus Magnus, a Dominican Father, being but one of them.

attached but secondary importance to the dogmatic differences
which then divided the German theologians.
Although a Lutheran, he felt himself greatly attached to the
theologians and their influence remained with him for life.
Later a stay in France still further confirmed him in these ideas
so new to him.
Once more returning to Tubingen, he entered the home of
Matthew Hasenresser, a celebrated professor of theology, as a
preceptor and was so influenced by him that he later published
a synopsis of the dogmatic doctrine of his teacher.14
Being of a mercurial nature, much after the temperament of
Paracelsus, Andrea was not content to remain in Tubingen. His
friend and preceptor, Chr. Resold, having instructed him in
Italian, he resolved to visit the land of the Doges. He crossed
Austria, spent some time in Venice, thence to Rome.
After visiting Rome and still unsatisfied and unsettled, he
returned to Germany. Arriving in Wurtenberg, he received a
kindly reception from the Duke John Frederick who, though
he would have preferred to give him a secular position, bestowed
upon him the position of Commensal (Officer of the King's
Household) at the Convent of Tubingen and created a seat
of theology especially for Andrea.
To supply his needs, Andrea also gave some private lessons
and thereby improved his position with those who became his
friends.15 Then, named Diaconus at Vaihingen (Wurtenberg)

Andrea planned the Christian Fraternity as a public vehicle to which men

cease to exist. This is true of all those who had ever attained the Exalted
Degree; become Brethren of Light and the Third.

PREFACE
TO THE
FAMA FRATERNITATIS
"To the Wise 111111 Untlersttmding RetU/er"
"Wisdom (said Solomon) is a treasure unto men that
"never faileth, for she is the breath of the power of God
"and an inherent flowing from the glory of the Almighty;
"she is the brightness of the everlasting Light ( 1), the un-
"spotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of
"His Goodness (2). She teacheth civility with righteous-
"ness and strength (3), she lmO'Weth things of old, and
"when conjectureth aright what is to come; (4) she
"knoweth the subtleties of speech and can expound dark
"sentences; she forseeth signs and wonders, with the advent
"of seasons and times."
( 1) Wisdom (all-knowing) is here coupled with the ever-
lasting Light. Lest the full meaning escape us let us search in
the realm of the Mysteries in which the writer of the Fama was
versed.
The first question propounded of all Acolytes who sought to
enter the Mysteries, was: "What seek ye here?,, The Acolyte
was compelled to answer the question, not on the basis of the
promptings of another, but of HIS OWN HEART. If his heart was
not imbued with the desire for the things (truth and wisdom)
he sought, then his answer would necessarily be unsatisfactory
and he was refused admittance until such time as his heart
would prompt him to answer correctly. If, on the other hand,
his desire was from the heart (holy), his reply would naturally
be: "LIGHT." "Light, that I may know God, and in knowing
God, come to know myself."
Above the temples of ancient Initiation was always found
jj8 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
the inscription: MAN KNOW THYSELF. If it was not in the heart
of man to KNOW HIMSELF, his weaknesses and his carnal fail-
ings as well as his strength and innate goodness, then he was
unfit to undertake the unraveling of the Mysteries. Without a
keen desire of the heart, NO AMOUNT OF STUDY OR INSTRUCTION
COULD OPEN THE DOORS OF THE INNER TEMPLE, The SanCtUW
Sanctorum, the Great Work the Mysteries had in view. To
find Light, the Light "which is on neither land nor sea," was
the purpose of the search, nor has there been any change
throughout the centuries.
(2) Light is the unspotted mirror of the Soul. Why is this
so? Because that Light which the Acolyte seeks is none other
than the Light of his own Soul, brought into manifestation in
such a manner that it appears before his material vision as
though it were a mirror, and therein HE SEES HIMSELF AS HE is,
not as he would like himself to be.
This is the UNVEILING; it unveils or reveals the individual to
HIMSELF; the student will see himself as he is, and knowing
himself for what he is, he can set about to change or transmute
(Alchemically—This is the Science of the Alchemist) the weak-
ness and evils, the carnality and crudeness, into the refined
IMAGE OF GOD, so that he may become, as commanded—God-
like, i.e., REBORN; achieving the second birth as a result of his
own efforts. If he is sincere he will also be able to see himself
as he may be, so that it will serve as a pattern to rebuild him-
self, thus he becomes a builder after the type of Solomon, the
All-Wise, who builded his Temple without the sound of saw
and hammer.
(3) In the course of his WORK the Acolyte will become
aware of three things: (a) That to become Wise after the
Wisdom of Solomon, and become Initiated, he must first of
all become a MAN in the true sense of the term; he must recog-
nize that to be civil is to speak frankly but kindly, with the
voice of velvet, but the sound of iron. He will become con-

scious of the fact that there can be no righteousness unless there
is strength. He will begin to realize that righteousness, and
those who would be righteous, are constantly challenged and
cannot survive unless they are able to defend their actions and
are constantly ready to do so. Only those who "Love me more
than father, mother, brother and sister," are fit to enter heaven
(the Temple of the Wisdom), as are those who have attained
to the degree where they are admitted into the inner Sanctuary,
"the Temple not made with hands." See / Kings 6:7 and Acts
7:48-17:24.
(4) "She knoweth things of old," Wisdom is always spoken
of as "she." This is because Wisdom (KNOWING and understand-
ing) is not gained from any outer source, but from the awak-
ened Soul within; from the Intuitive power which is the Voice
of the Soul. Wisdom cannot come to man except with, and in
proportion as the Soul is awakened, so that Intuition also be-
comes active. Wisdom is the result of inner Soul awakening
and the Soul is the SHE side of man.

"his fall fully imbued; (5) hence it doeth appear that after
"God had brought before Him all creatures of the field
"and the fowls under the heavens, he gave to every one of
"them their proper name, according to their Nature."
(5) How was Adam (the pristine Soul before it fell into
error which is sin) endowed according to the writers of the
Fama?
To answer this question it is essential that we bear in mind
that the combined philosophy and wisdom of those who
formed the Fraternatis Ros<e Crucis was that of the teachings
of a number of Arcane Societies, among which were the
Pythagoreans, and the only impartial and just way to answer
the question is to refer to the teachings of Pythagoras himself,
the Father of Philosophy.

ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
In The LIFE OF PYTHAGORAS, By M. Dacier, 1707 edition,
there is this statement: "... So long as the Soul can follow
[obey] God, she is happy [contented—at, peace]: But when
she can no longer follow him she loses sight of him, then being
miserably filled with vice [evils of the flesh] and with forget-
fulness [of her wisdom], she grows dull and heavy, and having
grown dull and heavy, she droops her wings, and falls into the
earth, where she becomes subject to the Laws of necessity, etc.
Hierocles makes use of this opinion to give the reason for his
assertion, that Providence extends itself over all things IN PRO-

230 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
In The LIFE OF PYTHAGORAS, By M. Dacier, 1707 edition,
there is this statement: ". . . So long as the Soul can follow
[obey] God, she is happy [contented-at, peace]: But when
she can no longer follow him she loses sight of him, then being
miserably filled with vice [evils of the flesh] and with forget-
fulness [of her wisdom], she grows dull and heavy, and having
grown dull and heavy, she droops her wings, and falls into the
earth, where she becomes subject to the Laws of necessity, etc.
Hierocles makes use of this opinion to give the reason for his
assertion, that Providence extends itself over all things IN PRO-
PORTION TO WHAT THEY ARE; and that for this reason it takes
greater care of the Soul of Man, than of beasts: For the Soul is
descended from Heaven, and MAY RETURN THITHER; 'tis capable
likewise of leading here a well-ordered civil life, which beasts
can never do. 'Tis therefore certain that God has more care
of Man than of beasts, which are only the work of Nature, and
their Soul and the body nothing but a mixture of Nature."
Pythagoras calls the Soul "a heavenly plant, because it comes
originally from Heaven, whereas the beasts are terrestrial
plants" and manifest their natural self [nature] because they
cannot change, such nature being "set" and unlike that of man
wherein dwells the Soul which may manifest desire, and this
desire either raises the Soul upward, or turns it downward into
carnality and destruction.
Alchemically speaking, according to Pythagoras, "the most
divine part of the Soul returns to the sun [is raised UPWARD],
and the subtile body to the moon, whereas beasts return to the
earth, whence they were taken."
This continues to be the basic doctrine of the Initiates and
in it is indicated the method of man's redemption, for the teach-
ing of which the Society of the Rosy Cross was founded.

the Initiates from the various Arcane Schools held it as a truth,
that the doctrines taught by the Nazarene, or he who was
known as the Nazarene, whoever he may have been, gave Laws
which were irrefutable, uncontradictable and eternal, and that
the Initiates did no more than give a practical application to
these Laws in the affairs and activities of everyday life.

chemists engaged in making gold with which men in their

made greater; humanity become more defiled? Were they
mere dreamers, doers of nothing, parasites on society?
Here we have the answer: They were the Illuminated of the
times. Who are the Illuminated? Let sacred Scripture answer:
Those who WERE BAPTIZED BY FIRE; THOSE UPON WHOM THE
HOLY GHOST HAD DESCENDED FROM GOD AND HIGH HEAVEN:
". . . he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and

out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto
him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove,
and lighting upon him:"—St. Matt. 3:16.1
The seekers after Initiation, and the brethren of the Rosy
Cross accepted this literally and sought to become baptized
by the Holy Ghost, by FIRE AS OF LIGHTING, for this meant the
Illuminating (lighting) of the Soul which had again come to
KNOW God.

( 18) Paracelsus was born in 1493. For more than four cen-
turies Paracelsus was abused in every language known to men
and in every denunciatory term, of which men could think.
It is only within the past twenty-five years that medical science
has accepted his theories in part, experimented accordingly,
and learned to its chagrin that Paracelsus, and not Galen, pos-
sessed many of the secrets of the healing art.
The remedy for the use of which he was most strongly con-
denmed, was antimony. Now it is accepted and used by the

"prolong his corporeal existence in health before Almighty
"God!"
Now that the "great quack" has been given his rightful place
in history as the mountebank who was instrumental in freeing
medicine from the fetters of "fourteen hundred years of cor-
ruption and superstition" let someone, acceptable to the
orthodox, proclaim him also as the father of the greatest
spiritual Fraternity of all times; as the one man above all
others who sought for, fought for, and died for, the ultimate
freedom of man, physically and spiritually, mentally and eco-
nomically, by teaching man that HE, AND HE ALONE, CAN FREE
HIMSELF, SAVE HIMSELF, IMMORTALIZE HIMSELF.
"After three years he returned again with good consent,
"shipped himself over Sinus Arabicus into Egypt, where
"he remained not long, but only took better notice there
"of the plants (19) and creatures. He sailed over the whole
"Mediterranean Sea for to come into Fez, where the
"Arabians had directed him."
(19) An apparent innocent statement such as "took better
notice there of the plants," is seemingly of little importance
until we bear in mind that among Acolytes and Initiates, only a
physician or botanist would be interested in plants. Of those
directly concerned with the formation and institution of the
Rosy Cross, Paracelsus, as a physician, opposed all systems of
the day. Andrea, the editor of the Fama was a theological
student, and it is nowhere indicated in his writings that he had
any great interest in plants or the healing art.

and therein he finds his freedom; he becomes a man first, and
then achieves Mastery, or Initiation.
(23) All that is right is good, and that which is good is in
harmony with itself and with the self. An early master-teacher
expressed this same secret in different words; he said:
To you who have attained to an understanding of the
concept that everything which is good and right, agrees
with itself, i.e., is in harmony, is "given the secret of the
kingdom of heaven," but to others who have NOT learned
this secret, it "is not so given."

POWER. In it there is life, not only of this day, but of every

stroyer. It disintegrates; it shatters, it tears to pieces. In this
there is misery, there is suffering, there is death.

"gold," "silver" and "precious stones" are the object of the
search for which Father C. R. C. travelled through many
"foreign countries," i.e., passed through many strange experi-
ences.
(29) The knowledge whereby this transmutation and regen-
eration is possible is the possession of the "governors," i.e.,
those who have passed through these experiences and are able
to instruct and guide all those who are willing to enter the
path and follow the instructions. To such will the Initiate
brethren impart the wisdom which will enable man to FREE
HIMSELF from all of the things that bring him sorrow and
suffering, and they in their turn become wise and capable to
counsel and help others who, like themselves, have been suffer-
ing and in bondage either to themselves or to others who have
so long enslaved them by one means or another.
"Verily we must confess that the world in those days
"was already big with great commotions, laboring to be
"delivered of them, and bring forth painfully, worthy
"men, who break with all force through darkness and
"barbarism, (30) and left us, who succeeded, to follow
"them. Assuredly they have been the uppermost point in
"Trigone Igneo, whose flame [Light] now should be more
"and more brighter, and shall undoubtedly give to the
"world the last [great] Light."
(30) In the year 1614 this appeared little less braggadocio
for the reason that the men who since have become Immortal-
ized were thought of as mystic masters; Philosophic Initiates.
In the writer's estimation, the three greatest were:
ist: Paracelsus, who tore the veil of falsehood and hypo-

252 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
"gold," "silver" and "precious stones" are the object of the
search for which Father C. R. C. travelled through many
"foreign countries," i.e., passed through many strange experi-
ences.
(29) The knowledge whereby this transmutation and regen-
eration is possible is the possession of the "governors," i.e.,
those who have passed through these experiences and are able
to instruct and guide all those who are willing to enter the
path and follow the instructions. To such will the Initiate
brethren impart the wisdom which will enable man to FREE
HIMSELF from all of the things that bring him sorrow and
suffering, and they in their turn become wise and capable to
counsel and help others who, like themselves, have been suffer-
ing and in bondage either to themselves or to others who have
so long enslaved them by one means or another.
"Verily we must confess that the world in those days
"was already big with great commotions, laboring to be
"delivered of them, and bring forth painfully, worthy
"men, who break with all force through darkness and
"barbarism, (30) and left us, who succeeded, to follow
"them. Assuredly they have been the uppermost point in
"Trigone lgneo, whose flame [Light] now should be more
"and more brighter, and shall undoubtedly give to the
"world the last [great] Light."
(30) In the year 1614 this appeared little less braggadocio
for the reason that the men who since have become Immortal-
ized were thought of as mystic masters; Philosophic Initiates.
In the writer's estimation, the three greatest were:
1st: Paracelsus, who tore the veil of falsehood and hypo-
crisy from off the faces of medicine, science and religion
and was bitterly persecuted for it.
2nd: Luther, who, though himself a priest and above re-
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLflE 253
proach, challenged the church successfully and brought
men religious freedom.
3rd: Agrippa, who, like Paracelsus, challenged the arts,
science and entrenched religion and suffered persecution,
prosecution and imprisonment for his efforts.
These were the three most prominent "worthy men," who
"painfully . . . broke the forces of darkness and barbarism" as
well as the entrenched brutality of a dark age.
"Such an one likewise has been Theophrastus in vocation
"and calling, although he was none of our Fraternity, (31)
"yet, nevertheless has he diligently read over the book 'M,'
"whereby his sharp ingenium was exalted (32); but this
"man was also hindered in his course by the multitude of
"the learned and wise-seeming men, that he never was
"able peacefully to confer with others of the knowledge
"he had of Nature (33). And therefore in his writings
"he rather mocked those busy-bodies, and proved to them
"what he was; yet, nevertheless, there is found with him
"well-grounded the afore-named Harmonia, (34) which
"without doubt he would have imparted to the learned, if
"he had not found them rather worthy of subtle vexation
"them to be instructed in the greater arts and sciences. He
"thus with a free and careless life lost his kind, and left
"unto the world their foolish pleasures."
(31) Neither Paracelsus nor Agrippa actually belonged to
the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross as such. Agrippa was born in
the year 1486. Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast von Hohen-
heim was born in the year 1493, seven years later. The
Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis, or Laudable Order of the Rosy Cross
was not formerly organized until 1614, some One Hundred
and Twenty-five years later. Agrippa was a Magus, Occultist
and Alchemist; Paracelsus was an Alchemist, Occultist and
Initiate in general. The Rosy Cross was the outcome of an

amalgamation of the various Occult and Initiate Fraternities
active for more than 400 years prior to this confederation and
it was as the result of the labors and teachings of these and
other Initiates that the Rosy Cross came into existence. Had the
Fraternity as such existed when these men lived and labored,
strived and suffered, they would have been members, because
all those who belonged to their respective organizations and
desired to do so, automatically became members of the Rosy
Cross when these organizations were merged into one.
(31) The book "M" had a specific reference and also was a
general term for all the esoteric and Arcane writings and teach-

Supreme Initiation, and have remained so to this day.

seeker after Truth to read the lives of both Agrippa and
Paracelsus. Only the comparatively few of those who had en-
tered the Fraternities as Novices, or had become Philosophic
Initiates, accepted the teachings of these great Masters, while
others derided, abused, persecuted, defamed and prosecuted
them. None of the "learned" men of the day would have any
of their conclusions. Only during the recent past after science
had proven the falsity of the ideas and writings of those who
were inimical to Agrippa and Paracelsus, and the truth of much
that was taught by these men, have they come into their own,

Occult inculcation, because neither science nor intellect can

(45) To "use" is to apply. The magical language or writings
were the instructions by means of which, or by the "use" of
which, i.e., OBEDIENCE TO WHICH, enabled them to transmute—
Alchemize—the carnal thoughts, desires and inclinations into
the Divine emotions, and in that manner attain toward God-
liness and Illumination, i.e., the glorification of the God in us or
in "his temple." The more man becomes God-like, the greater
is his praise of God. We cannot glorify God in any other way
than by being obedient to him and his Laws.
(46) The "making of the first part of the book 'M' was the
first effort of the associated brethren to harmonize and recon-
cile the ideas, ideals, and instructions of the vast amount of
Arcane writings in the possession of the individual brethren
and the various organizations, and at the same time, for each
of those engaged to individually follow, i.e., practice the Ar-
cane instructions and live in accordance with them. This
brought about "unspeakable concourse," i.e., in the transmuta-
tion of the carnal thought and desires there would be sickness,
that is, travail, because all birth, i.e., change is birth, is in pain
and sorrow; the sorrow and suffering of giving up the old, and
in turn, giving birth—the BRINGING FORTH—of the new. In the
course of this effort, the "new building," the house, or the
"temple not built by hands" is brought into existence, for

(45) To "use" is to apply. The magical language or writings
were the instructions by means of which, or by the "use" of
which, i.e., OBEDIENCE TO WHICH, enabled them to transmute-
Alchemize-the carnal thoughts, desires and inclinations into
the Divine emotions, and in that manner attain toward God-
liness and Illumination, i.e., the glorification of the God in us or
in "his temple." The more man becomes God-like, the greater
is his praise of God. We cannot glorify God in any other way
than by being obedient to him and his Laws.
(46) The "making of the first part of the book 'M' was the
first effort of the associated brethren to harmonize and recon-
cile the ideas, ideals, and instructions of the vast amount of
Arcane writings in the possession of the individual brethren
and the various organizations, and at the same time, for each
of those engaged to individually follow, i.e., practice the Ar-
cane instructions and live in accordance with them. This
brought about "unspeakable concourse," i.e., in the transmuta-
tion of the carnal thought and desires there would be sickness,
that is, travail, because all birth, i.e., change is birth, is in pain
and sorrow; the sorrow and suffering of giving up the old, and
in turn, giving birth-the BRINGING FORTH-Of the new. In the
course of this effort, the "new building," the house, or the
"temple not built by hands" is brought into existence, for

only in this "new building" is the Conscious Soul able to estab-

(47) The Sancti Spiritus, or the Sanctified Spirit, that is,
the Soul, becomes Conscious and therefore baptized by the
Holy Ghost, has received the Fires from heaven and the Great
Work is finished. All of this is a spiritual work. First comes
the building of a spiritualized structure for the Soul to inhabit;
then the awakening of the mind to the Illuminating truth
and bringing the Soul into God or Cosmic-Consciousness, so
that it will be possible for the Illuminated Soul to dwell in
this temple of the "living God."

the carnal thoughts, desires and inclinations are made pure, that
is, directed toward constructive and exalted effort, it is not

and spiritualization is impossible. Without spiritualization the
state of Sanctus Spiritus cannot be brought about and the

To assure that his successor will be a qualified Initiate, he
actually designates a ist, 2nd and 3rd choice. The Initiates so
recognized constitute the Council of Three.
This practice is necessary because there is always the possi-

the basis that so very few have had the opportunity to study
