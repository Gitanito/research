I graduated in the Air Force Academy and
spent about seven and a half years in
the Air Force is on active duty from
1964 to 1970 171 and I went to work for
Rockwell and white went to work for
Martin Marietta first in Denver and then
Rockwell International here in the
Southern California area and then I went
I went to work for FAA 1974 work for
them and we&#39;re about 21 years retired in
1995 federal service
you
well I was a Newark traffic control Eric
Eric well basically our traffic
controller was we&#39;ve called it
ground control intercept controller and
I would say then I was a missile launch
officer and then after that I was an
engineer at on the titan-3
propulsion system of samso or los
angeles Air Force Station and when I
resigned from the Air Force in 1971 out
that&#39;s where I was located at Los
Angeles Air Force Station the event the
incident I guess I&#39;d I call it happened
on the morning of March 16 1967 I was on
duty along with my commander Fred
Maiwald
we were both on duty at Oscar flight as
part of the 490th strategic missile
squadron there are five launch control
facilities assigned to that particular
squadron kilo Lima Mike November Oscar
okay here&#39;s echo echo launch control
facility is located o some 30 miles
north of Lewiston Oscar was another 30
or 40 miles east of Lewiston November
just south of Lewis team we were an
Oscar flight it was still dark out of
course we&#39;re 60 feet underground and
there&#39;s no way we can see out but as I
recall it was early in the morning and I
got a I received a call from my topside
security guard who&#39;s the flight security
controller I think we called FSC and he
said that he and some of the guards had
been observing some strange lights
flying around the site around the launch
control facility
and he said they were acting very
unusual just flying around and I said
well you mean UFO I think I use that
word
you mean like UFOs and he said well he
said he couldn&#39;t you didn&#39;t know what
they were but they were lights they were
flying around and they were the word
airplanes they weren&#39;t making any noise
that were not helicopters they were
making some very strange maneuvers and
he couldn&#39;t explain them well I told him
you know I I just kind of shook my head
and just said well call me if anything
more important that happens you know I
basically and we just ended the
conversation it wasn&#39;t more than well
within a few minutes I&#39;d say maybe half
hour later he calls back and this time
he&#39;s very frightened I can tell by the
tone of his voice he&#39;s very shook up and
said sir there&#39;s a there&#39;s a glowing red
object hovering right outside the front
gate and I&#39;ll show you what a what where
the gate might be located but he&#39;s got
it where he&#39;s located he&#39;s got a large
picture window of the front gate and he
said I&#39;m looking at it right now it&#39;s a
glowing red object I&#39;ve got all the men
out here with her weapons drawn and of
course he was all shook up while he was
telling me that she was very excited I
didn&#39;t know what to make you know but he
wanted me to give him instructions her
orders tell him what to do and I think I
said something like make sure the
perimeter fence is secure and then and
then he said right away he said I&#39;ve got
to go sir one of the guards has become
injured he hung up hung up I immediately
went over at my commander who was taking
a nap may have a little cot down there&#39;s
in a rest period and I was telling him
about the telephone call
just received then as I was relating
this to him our missile started shutting
down one by one by shutting down I met
they went into a a no-go condition no-go
condition meaning they could not be
launched so we get we get bells and
whistles we get a red light
no-go condition and as I recall it at
the time it seemed like every one of
them shut down but later in in recalling
this this incident with my commander
Maiwald he said he thought we only lost
about maybe maybe seven or eight of
these weapons went down into a no-go
condition these weapons are Minuteman
one missiles
these were course nuclear nuclear tip
nuclear warhead missiles the weapons
here so they started shutting down and
immediately he gets up and we both start
querying the the status board we&#39;ve got
the ability to query and and determine
what the cause of the shutdowns were as
I recall most of them were guidance and
control system failures and then he
started reporting to the command post
and in the meantime I called upstairs to
find out what the status was of this
object
trotty and the guard said well the
object has left just just left at high
speed I asked I asked him what the
object looked like
and all he could say there was a general
oval shape but it was it was it was
glowing red was glowing a reddish orange
around the object and it was generally
oval-shaped but he said it was very hard
to distinguish any any features so
that&#39;s the barley
well he said it was hovering right over
the fence and to me it&#39;s that would have
been within about you know 30 feet away
from
the fence was maybe eight feet high
there is another incident that happened
just within a week of this week after
where there were radar reports and what
if you are witnesses the Air Force did
an extensive investigation of the entire
incident and was not able to come up
with a probable cause for the shutdowns
and I&#39;ve got quite a few witnesses that
will testify to that and we&#39;ve got a
couple of people who worked on the
investigative team and I&#39;ve got
correspondence from the fellow that
actually organized the investigative
team and there was no viable explanation
for this each each missile each missile
missile is basically self-supporting the
the commercial most of them are powered
by commercial power but each missile has
its own power generator the only
connection between the the capsule and
the missile sites themselves is what we
call syn lines or their sensitive
information network si n lines they&#39;re
basically buried cables and but but
inside the capsule itself and these
lines go to the missiles directly that
the missiles are not connected to each
other so having a fault at one site
would not affect missiles at another
location went down well at our site
there were approximately anywhere from
six to eight that went down but they
went down in rapid succession which
again is a extremely rare happening we
rarely had more than one missile go down
for any reason at all
all you know and this was very rare
there was weather was ruled out like I
said an extensive investigation was done
weather was ruled out power surges were
ruled out there was only one possibility
that was was looked at by one of the one
of the Boeing engineers that that did
some tests in a laboratory and he
thought that some kind of an
electromagnetic force or field might
have might have caused a signal to go
but it would have had to have gone
through these buried cable to each of
these missiles after I talked to my
guard upstairs got the information about
but today the other guard had been
injured my commander was talking the
command post the command post and finish
talking the command post and he turned
to me my commander and said the same
thing occurred at echo Flight echo light
is another squadron about I&#39;d say 50 60
miles away from our location but they
had the same sort of thing happened they
had UFOs that were hovering not not the
launch control facility but the actual
launch facilities where the missiles are
actually located they had some
maintenance and security people out
there at the time and they were they
were observed the UFOs were observed by
these people out at those sites now they
lost all 10 of their weapons all 10
around the thing around the same it was
the same warning so that morning we lost
anywhere from you know 16 to 18 ICBMs
at the same time UFOs were in the area
and we&#39;re and were observed by Airmen
topside guard observed UFOs at the time
we lost our missile systems it also
talks about the security team that I had
sent out to check the security
infraction so and while enroute back
they lost radio contact and one of these
men again I said was very upset about
this whole incident and was unable to
return he says I heard secondhand that
one was released from security team
duties those missiles were down the
entire day because we&#39;ve got testimony
from Colonel Don Crawford who relieved
the crew at Echo flight and he was there
while the missiles were being brought up
to alert status and he said it took the
whole day so I&#39;m assuming it took our
missiles the whole day to be brought
back up also
so we got relieved I went upstairs first
thing I did is look in the guards eye
and say hey would you tell me the truth
about this this object and he swore up
and down he was telling the truth I
believed I you know for a couple reasons
I I knew he was frightened when he
called me down here and then when I
looked at me the eye and he you know he
told me about situation I certainly
believed him and again I wrote up a
report on this incident it was in my log
I turned it over when we got to the base
I had to we had to report to our
squadron commander right away and in
that room with my squadron commander was
a fellow from AFOs I we had a AF OSI Air
Force Office of Special Investigation on
the base he was there in the office with
the commander asked for my logs he
wanted a quick briefing although it
seemed to me he knew pretty much what
had happened already but we gave him a
quick briefing and then he asked us
asked us both to sign a nondisclosure
agreement saying this was classified
information we were not to release this
to anybody and that was it and we we
couldn&#39;t talk he told us we could not
talk about this to anyone including any
of the any of the other crews our our
spouses our family even amongst each
other so we could not discuss this at
all some weeks before my incident he
received report from an airman on duty
saying something was outside the
perimeter fence he&#39;d never seen before
the object was lighted and seemed to be
watching the sighted approached and
repeated or retreated and something
circled the site you had this
conversation they told him and the guard
to go ahead and use his weapon but the
but the guard said he didn&#39;t think it
would do any good he tried to report it
to the command PO
and the command post didn&#39;t want to
receive the report that was the end of
that I was there at Malstrom for another
two years after that and in that time we
were never given a debriefing on any of
the incident either incident either the
echo incident or our own which is very
unusual because we got briefed every
morning on any anomalies that were going
on with the equipment we got briefed and
D and this we discussed these technical
issues that were going on with the
weapons and all that but we never heard
anything else about these incidents and
and these were major happenings they
were major happenings I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got
a telegram a copy of a telex which we
received under foi a
coming from sac headquarters to Malstrom
and other bases saying right after the
morning that this happened saying that
this incident was of extreme concern to
sac headquarters because they couldn&#39;t
explain it nobody could explain what
happened but yet we never got debriefed
and we were cleared for very high
classification because these are nuclear
weapons were dealing with we had we had
high clearances and yet we were never
debriefed on this at all and you see
here there&#39;s a reference to a secret
message on the same subject here this is
the should be a copy exact duplicate it
should be an exact duplicate but as you
see here under the subject here there
was a reference but here it&#39;s missing
the only other thing I might mention is
we did get a security incursion alarms
at those sites that went when the
missile went down so which a little
unusual it well that is unusual because
normally when a missile went down for
for something like
guidance failure we wouldn&#39;t get
security incursion alarms perimeter
means there&#39;s a perimeter breach that
some object crossed the fence or
something broke broke the security alarm
system that we had on the perimeter of
the launch facility so I did send out go
I sent guards to a couple of those
facilities to investigate that well the
only description I got a movement was
like I said the first telephone call
well they had erratic movement of these
lights flying around above the launch
control facility other than that the
guard upstairs said that the object was
hovering took off at great speed I mean
he just just left rapidly you know
quickly the reason I think this story is
really significant is because going back
to dist:19 66 at Minot Air Force Base a
very similar thing happened at one of
the launch facility launch control
facilities at Minot Air Force Base they
had the same kind of weapon system we
had Minuteman 1 missiles this was
observed on radar there was some
communication failure the object was
observed over the launch control
facility so and that happened in August
1966 and that&#39;s documented what
well-documented that incident about a
week prior to my incident of March of 67
I&#39;ve got a record of it from the crew
commander I&#39;ve got a call from one of
his security guards who was out roaming
looking at the launch facilities and saw
an object very similar to what I just
described
over launch launch facility reported in
the commander reported to command post
command post said they weren&#39;t
interested in that report and just
didn&#39;t even want to take the report and
that happened a week before about a week
before ours happen about a week to 10
days after our incident there&#39;s a very
well documented incident that happened
at Malmstrom Air Force Base and in this
case well a near Maelstrom Air Force
Base and and again this was another one
that was tracked by radar it was
observed at close range relatively close
range by truck driver and highway
patrolman and there&#39;s a extensive report
on that and the Air Force did an
investigation and there&#39;s an extensive
report on the Air Force investigation of
this of this sighting this UFO sighting
because it flew around the base near the
base and very very close to the base
like I say was seen by a truck driver
and and highway patrolman and in this
incident was reported back to
headquarters this correspondence going
back and forth and I got some of that so
this is a whole series of things that
happened having to do with with the same
kind of weapon system Minuteman missile
the reports that were made to me by my
guards were official reports these were
not these were not jokes they were not
meant to be anything but official
reports because we were dealing with
weapons strategic weapons during the
Cold War during the Vietnam War they
were very professional these guards and
they were not about to be joking about
what
being when we had weapons down about
what they were seeing so these were not
rumors they were official reports so if
if they were recanted for any reason
these men should have been
court-martialed for giving false reports
and false information during a very
sensitive incident and none of that
happened none of that happened these
these were not rumors there&#39;s nothing
about rumors primary witnesses it&#39;ll
verify this incident are are the echo
crew the commander and deputy commander
and my own commander Fred Maiwald
Bob Kaminsky was was was headed up the
organization team that organized the
investigative team to look at all
aspects of these shutdowns Kaminsky
relates to me in writing I&#39;ve got it in
writing that at some point he was told
by his boss that the Air Force had said
stop the investigation do no more on
this and in addition do not write a
final report again this is very unusual
especially knew of the fact that sac
headquarters was stating and this is
sick sac was stating that this was of
extreme importance to find out exactly
what happened here and yet the head of
the investigative team was told that a
stop-work order was on the way from Ohio
amo is the air Materiel Command a dog
Utah to stop any further effort on this
project we stopped we were also told
that we were not to submit the final
engineering report and not write a final
report I heard that many of the guards
that had reported these incidents were
sent off in it to be a noun as a matter
of fact I know for a fact this I can
attest to that one of the guards I sent
out to one of the launch facilities
again observed an object and came back
and was too shook up
I was very shaken by the experience and
was taken off guard duty from then on he
he was he was sent somewhere else he was
just too shaken by the experience and to
this day I have never forgotten it it is
it it has been a life altering
experience for them it was off the scale
in terms of what the technology for our
are or potential targets Russian targets
were it was off the scale they are
trained to determine the difference
between radar strikes and any
atmospheric disturbances that can
approximate targets they&#39;re there
they&#39;re experts at it
