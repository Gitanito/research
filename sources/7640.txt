  		              		Experience Description   

    From my point of view of what happen:

  My friend left my room and went outside with her boyfriend. I went to their room so I’d be found. My dog Alice was with me. I drew up a heavy shot of heroine. Then, I sat with my legs crossed and tucked under each other.  I was in the middle of the floor. I took the shot. I attempt to get up, but couldn't. I had fallen face down. 

  I remember what I felt like. I was waking up out of the sleep of a lifetime and into a pool of the most overwhelming emotion of peace, serenity and love. As I open my eyes and sat up, I could see between the human world and another amazing place. When I stood up, my vision or view focused on this new, wonderful place. I was met by a group of people. I knew all of them; they were former family members and a few friends.  There were also a few I didn't know; one female and one male. The ground felt like I was floating midair above it. If I could feel it, I would liken it to silken grass but it was multi-colored. There were no trees.  Yet there was a clear, golden-yellow sky like an early morning sun that goes into mid-morning. My family began to tell me it was time to go back. I argued with them.  Then in what felt like the snap of a finger, I was back in my body and really sitting up. There was a tube going down my nose and someone just finishing cutting my shirt to place the electric shock pads on my body. 

    My friends account of thing: 

  They left the house and walked next door to a friend's house. My dog Alice broke out of the house and went to find my friend or help.  My friend rushed back to the house and found me. They took the time to find out what I used and tried to sit me up and poured water on me. Nothing would wake me. They took 20 minutes to call the emergency medical technicians.

After everything, I have felt so alone with the feelings of knowing things I shouldn’t. I have knowledge that I didn’t have before. I hear what’s supposed to be private conversation about me or I hear someone else’s thoughts in general. When my kids were younger, if I wasn't getting what they were telling me or trying to communicate with them,  they would pop a picture or words in my mind's eye. If that makes sense. My oldest was premature and had flat-lined a few times. With her I can try to hide something they can’t play with while they are asleep. She’ll go get it the second she wakes up. It is as if she already knew where it was and what I did with whatever the object was.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  Like as I felt like I was awaking up from a deep sleep and sitting myself up. I was actually pulling out of my body the room was the same but it was only me in it. My vision or view of the room was torn those like a movie screen being torn with another place behind it.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I’m actually -3.25 in one eye and -3,75 in the other. My eye site was like brand new. 20/20 vision.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      My hearing wasn’t that good before but during and since it’s way better. To the point it’s like all the noise is deafening at times.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     Family members and friends I shared a deep connection too worldly wise.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Like I had said it was almost like I was in an open field without tree and where the “background” met the “ground” was all bright gold yellowish light.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     It wasn’t a field I was in even though it seemed as one. Then when my family friends and the two extras the field disappeared and it was them and a bright light behind them.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events     Question confuses me  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will  While I was arguing with them that i didn’t want to leave for what felt like minutes, was started and sent back in the blink of an eye.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian   I have and still hold the knowing that there is something bigger than us. Higher power or God, I choose to leave it nameless,  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I explained this already  

What is your religion now?         No comment   None  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I didn’t believe the sense of peace there was, it’s completely overwhelming in the best way possible. I supposed you're not supposed to remember who your earthly family or friends were. They were all that surrounded me. The gates they talk about St. Peter, but of rubbish.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     It confirmed that there is something bigger than ourselves and bigger than this little pointless earthly life, might actually have a greater purpose for our next stop.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   There were two I didn’t know, one was a female and one was male. When I say I didn’t know, like I know of them but not of the earth but somehow there was a connection.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain   As I said there was two I felt I known of but didn’t know personally.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     As odd as it sounds If some information I didn’t know before I thought about again it’s like what I was missing of the information was sent to me at the moment of thought. Like prior to this I had an injury and the doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong, I returned after this experience with what was wrong with my knee.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     We are all connected with it in some form.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     It was why the other two I didn’t know I felt was there or they might have been spirit guides not ready to take me to the next stop.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   Knowledge yes if it’s purpose or not, I do not know  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain     I don’t know how to describe it other than just knowing.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Uncertain     Even though there were a number of family members, I knew the ones that weren’t there had already passed through this part or had restarted over.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I don’t understand how you can describe this.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love is just an emotion; marriage was made up by man.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     things I shouldn’t know about ppl things events I know can tap into a “knowing” of them inside out.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Harder to believe lies knowing and hearing them as they are said, makes it hard to want to be around or socialize with anyone  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain   I think it’s more about the sigma or “looking crazy”.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience. I remember it and the feeling, I’ve only tolerated this earth because I have kids now.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I hear living and the past with the ones in between, I hear conversations that are supposed to private thoughts of others or conversations with other people I know. Among other things.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Seeing my family with friends  and knowing they knew my life and why I have been the way I was prior to the experience.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Nope it fell on deaf ears every time I’ve tried to talk to anyone who hasn’t had the experience. I have yet to meet anyone else that has.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     A lot of things I have  been told by others were lies, the government is bullshit in any country. The way this world is and is going isn’t what it’s meant for.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real     It was real, that happens and it happens to other people.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Nope  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Do less of the repeating question in “different” forms.
