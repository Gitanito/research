    Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 American Socialist.

1876â€”1879  Weekly

Oneida, NY.  Publisher: Oneida & Wallingford Communities.  Editor: John Humphrey Noyes, William A. Hinds.

1/1, March 30, 1876-December 25, 1879.  This was the "new series" of the Oneida Circular, the weekly organ of the perfectionist and socialist communities founded by John Humphrey Noyes (1811-1886) in Oneida, New York, and Wallingford, Connecticut.  Noyes had firmly rejected spiritualism and the Rochester rappings in 1851, but by 1874 had come to see its usefulness, as the journal reflects.  LOC.
