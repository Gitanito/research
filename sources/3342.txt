THE AUTHENTIC
ST GERMAIN
By
Dr. M. Doreal
Among the figures occupying a prom-
inent place in modern occultism is the
so-called ascended master St. Germain.
Much has been told, and a,greater. amount
surmised about this mysterious being -
mysterious because the average student
of occultism has had no opportunity to
examine the records which give all that
is actually k~own about this curious per-
sonage.
It is inte~esting to note how the
myth has grown concerning him, till to-
day he has received his crown. and halo in
the form of a cult which looks upon him
as being at least co-equal with Jesus,
Buddha and other great Avatars, if not
actually superior. Actually, it 1~ by
reason only of his growing :miportance from
the cultus point of view that it is de-
sirable to notice him at all.
We will begin with unquestioned mat.
ters of fact, contained in diplomatic
correspondence pre seryed in the British
Museum under the title of .Mitchell Papers.
1. On March 14, 1760 Major Qereral Joseph
Yorke, English envoy at the Hague, wrote
to the Earl of Holdernesse, reminding
him that he was acquainted with the his-
tory of an extraordinary man, knownas
-3-
the Comte de Saint Germain, who had re-
sided sometime in England where, however
he had done nothing. Since then, during
a sFace of two or three years he had been
living in France, on familiar terms with
the French King, Mme. de Pompadour,M. de
Bellisle and others. He had been grant-
ed an apartment at Chambard by the French
-King. More recently he had been at
Amsterdam, Where he was made much of •
. Upon the. marriage of Pri.ncess Caroline,
he had arrived at the Hague, where he
calle·d on General Yorke. Subsequently
he desiPed to speak to the English En-
voy to whom he showed two letters from
Iviar:shall Belle isle, by vuiy of creden-
tials, and proceeded to explain that the
French ~ing, the Dauphin, Mme. de Pom-
padour and t"he court with the exception
of the Due de Choi~eul; desired peace
.with England. They wi~hed to know the
real · fee ling of England and to adjust
ma.tters with-all honour.· Madame de Pom-
padour, ··and Mar shall Be·11e isle had sent
this "political adventurer" with the
,King' s knowledge.
•: . ,;
·On March 21st· the Earl of Holder-
ne sse informed General Yorke that George
II entirely approved the manner in which
he had conducted the conversation with
Comte de St. Germain~- The king did not
regard it as improbable that the latter
_was authorized to talk as he had done by
persons of weight in the councils of
France and even possibly with ·the King's
knowledge. Yorke was directed not to
discuss further with St. Germain unless
the latter produced authentic proof that
-4-
he was an accredited envoy.
On Apri.1 4th General Yorke reported
that St. Germain was still at the Hague
but that the Due de Choiseul had in-
structed the French Ambassador to forbid
his interference v.vith anything relating
to the political aff.airs of· France •. De
Choiseul was a sworn enemy of the English
and antagonistic to any peace attempts.
On May 6th, the Earl of Holdernesse
wrote· to Mr. Andrew ....Mitchell, English
Envoy to Prussia, referring to all that
had passed between Yorke and St.Germain;
to the formal disavowel of St.. Germain
by the Due de ChoiseUl; · and to St.
Germain's decision to ·go to England; ".ih
order to avoid the resentment of.the
French Ministerlt. The Earl mentions hi.s
arrival; his immediate apprehension-and
examination on the ground that he was
not authorized, "even 1:>ythat PA.RT of
the Fre:r,tch Iviinistr7, in whose name 'he
pretended to talk 1 • · His examination
produced little, and the · decision was
made that he be banished from England.
He was released and set out to take
shelter in some part of Prussia, his
intention being sent to the King to. Prus-
sia, through lV!r. Mitchell •.
In addition to the Mitchell papers
there is also·a series· of papers in the
French Record Office of Foreign Affairs
on the same subject at the same period.
i::he Hague,. February 22, 1760 - de
ChoiseDl to Comte d'Offry -· St.Germain,
is reported at· Amster¢lam, claiming to be
entrusted with an important mLss.1.on.-on
-5-
the financial position of France.
March lOth - From d'Offry to de
Choiseul - stating that St. Germain had
visited him at the Hague stating that he
intended to save the kingdom by securing
for France · the credit of the · principal
bankers of· Holla·nd.
"March 14th, f-rom d 10ffry to de !Jboi-
seul - stating that he had seen the
scheme of St. Germain, and intends .to
tell him: that affairs of. the kind have
nothing to do with the mini str>y.
Versailles: March 19th fr>om de
Ch6iseul. tb d'Offry en~lo~ing a letter
from St~ Germain to Ifline
.• de Pompadour>
which ii;; described as sufficiently ex-
po sing 11
The absurdity of the personage 11•
He is an a~vent.urer of the first water
and seems to be exce~dinglj foolish.
d'Offry is to warn· St. Germain that if
he chooses · to meddle· in politics., tlhe
shall be placed in an underground dun-
geon". He ts to be forbidden d I Offry I s
house and all foreign ministers and Ams-
terdam bankers be informed:
April 5th - d'Offry to de Choiseul
- reports a visit from St. Germain to
whom he repeated the inst~uctions re-
ceived. St. Ger>main is said.to bij over-
whelmed and the two parted.
April 8th - d 1 0ffry to de Choiseul
- St. G~rmain is reported as continuing
to see Bentinck and as claiming to have
a place 1n his ·French Majesty's councils.
-6-
St. Germain is said otherwise to be ab-
solutely discredited.
April 11th From de Choiseul to
d'Offry - the latter is required by the
king to discredit the so-called Comte de
St. Germain· in the most humiliating and
emphatic manner; and to arrange for his
arrest "throu~h the friendliness of the
States General' so.that he may be trans-
ported to France and. "punished according
to the heinousness of his offence".
·, April 17th - d 'Of fry to de Choiseul"'
- r~ports flight of st. Germain by the
help of M. de Bentinck, and expre.sses a
be.l~ef that he is sorely pressed for
mone\v, having borrowed two thousand flor-
ins from a Jew on the security of three
opal~.,
~ay 12th - d'Offry to de Choiseul -
St .• Germain arrives in England but was
met by .a state messenger who forbade him
to proceed furth0r, and caused him to
emba.rk on the fir st vessel outward bound,
tt.being the English minister's opinion
notwithstanding the displeasure of French
diplomatists against St.Germain was sim-
ulated and that. he was really sent to
a.ssist the cause in England •.
May 14th - d 1 0ffry to de Choiseul -
·~ontradicts the preyious report and says
St. Germain was not stopped at Harwich
but arrested in London under an order
from Pitt; but having been examined by
one of his minister's chief clerks., the .
latter regarded him as a .kind of lunatic
/ -7-
who had no evil intentions. f3t. Germain
was the~efore taken back to Harwich and,·
warned to quit the English shores.
Ma·rch 23., 1762, ·d 10ffry to de Choi-
seul ... recalls the Comte de st·. Germain,
says that he is again in Holland under
assumed names·, that he has purchased. an
estate at Gu.elders and s·uggests that he
is making dupes of people, wi~h chemical
secret~, in orde~ to·-earn a living.
It will be seen that the papers in
the French Foreign Office give the ·inner
significance of facts·and proceedings to
which the :Mitchell papers bear witness.
There is -full documentary eviC:i-ence ·that
Louis XV assigned St. Gerrnain the castle
of Ghambar.d in 1758 as· a place of abode
and that he was actually installed·there
in IVlay. There is also extant a letter
from St. Germain to Mme. de ~ompadour,
dated · Iv.larch 11th, 1760 which most cer-
tainly exhibits his relations with the
court -in no un.oertai·l'.i manner and· just-
ifies what· is :sa·id upon this matter in
the· Mitchell papers. -· It is quite pro9..;;,
..
able ·that he had · a verbal comi_ssion to
see if he could arrange anything in ·the
matter of peace with England behind the.
bac·k of de .Choiseul., and that when his
attempted interventions became known he
~as thrown over by the~,,_French King after
the best· manner of Louts XV. At any
rate St.Germain comes before us as an UN-
SUCCESSFULpolitical emissary who was used
at be st as a cat's paw. It may_be addf}d
tr_ia.t when he addressed the king's mis-
tress it was ·not in the phraseol?gY' of
-8-
an adept. He te.ll s her that he has spoken
to Bentinck of the charming Marquis de
Pompadour from "the fullness of a heart"
whose sentiments have long been known to
her, reminds her of _the LOYALTY
he has
~worn· to HER and alludes to Louis XV, one
o.f the rottenest kings Franc~ e-ve=rhad,
n·as _the best and worthie.st of .kings". It
1.s n·ot· at such COST tha~ ·adeptship .. re-
pays the. favours· even of a palace· in
Chambard.
On Dec. 9th, 1745 - Horace Walpole
writes to·Sir Horace Mann, stating that
"the other day they seized an odd man
who goes by the name of St .Ger~ain". He
w~s said to have been. in England two
years and had confessed that he was u,si.ng
an· a asumed name, while refusing all in.-
formation as to his origin and iden-
tity. Walpole ac_knowledge s his mµsical
ability but testi~ies that otherwise he
vias quite mad.
He is heard of next at Vienna fi'an
i745 to.46 with Prince Lobkowitz "first
mi~ister as his intimate friend. ti ..
It appears tha~ he
in 1757 and_according to
her father was a great
ski~l in chemistry.
v.isi ted Paris
Mme. de Gentis,
admirer of his
He is said to have been in Paris in
1760 and when Marqµi_s~ d' Urfe mentioned
the fact to de ·choiseul the latter re-
plied it was not OFFICIALLY.known to the
cabinet~
-9-.
He is reported in Ste Petersburg in
1761-2 and according to Graf Gregor Or-
loff he "played a great part in the .Rus-
sian revolution". In 1769 he was in
Brussels as appears in a letter from Graf
Karl Coblentz, who regarded him as the
most singular man he had ever seen, af-
firms that he witnessed him transform
iron into a metal as beautiful as gold,
his preparations for dyeing skins, silk,
wool, etc. This is conciete evidence
that he had great skill in chemistry, a
fact noted previously. ·
Between the years 1763-69, we have
the authority of Diedonne Thiebault for
the fact that St. Germain spent a year
in Berlin, where he became acquainted
with the Abbe Pernety, who was a consid-
erable figure in Hermeticism and Masonry
at that period and later-.
The Graf Max Von Lamberg met him in
Venice under an assumed name, engaged in
experiments on Fl~x. According to Von
Sypesteyn, St. Germain again visited
Paris in 1770 afte~ the fall of de Choi-
seul. The same writer states that St.
Germain was at the Hague in 1774, after
the death of Louis XV, and that he car-
ried out alchemical experiments there.
In 1776 it is certain he was at
Leipzig and at Dresden the following
year, where he was offered an important
post, which he refused. According to a
letter of Baron Von Wurmb, St. Germain
was then about 60 or 70 years old. In
1777 St. Germain was at Hamburg, and af-
-10-
terwards visited Prince Karl of Hesse,
with whom he engaged in experiments on
various herbs •
. The last authentic record in the
church Register at Eckrenforde which has
this entry: "Deceased Feb. 27, buI"ied on
March 2nd, 1784, the so-called Comte de
St. Germain and Weldon - further inf or.-
mati on not known - private.ly deposited
in thi·s church". On April 3rd 1784, the
mayor and council of the town certified
that "his effects have been legally
sealed", that nothing had been ascer-
tained as to the existence of a will;
and that his creditors were called upon
to come forward, "with their claims 0 on
October 14th.
About any other personage the pre-
ceding would be· accepted as 1onclusive
proof of decease, but the St~· Germain
cultus will not have it so; they need a
miracle man, a supernatural being to
look to. Foolish persons challenge the
records of his death because a~cording
to the anti-Mason Eckert, st.Germain was
invited to attend the Masonic Congress
in 1785 and that· of Wilhelmsbad in Feb-
ruary of the same year, according to an-
other account. It has not OCCURnED to
them that such invitations could be is-
sued without knowledge; that an individ-
ual constantly travelling under assumed
names had died without general knowledge
of the.:.fact.
Other uncritical per:;ions, Mrs.
Coope~_.:..Qakley among them who take' the
-11-;
Comtesse d 1Adhemars account seriously,
instead of as the exaggerated and largely
ficticious narrative, no statement of
which can be accepted without checking.
She ce_rtifies . among other marvels that
she ·saw him _at the court of Versaille.s
in 1743 long before she herself was
present at court. It may be stated that
Pr,ince Karl of Hes.se himself knew of St.
Germain's death, and that his illness
b_egan while pursuing experiments ·in col.-
qur s.
Aside from the. fables which have
acc~ulo. ted about him we have these facts
- St. ·Ger.main was a wanderer for a con-
side.rable p·eriod over Europe - he had
entree to the court of most countries --
he was an .exp~:rt chemi_st. - he was versed
1.n ~1c~en1:y ~nd .Ma.sonry - ..for twenty-fom:a
year:a- ·he .. was !:ln occa_sional figure in
Euro-pean affatrs, and that this period
closed _.by hi.s death.
St.· Germain was.evidently a gentle-
man of his _day, ac.cepted _as such by his
peers, · but· .like many gentlemen of· the
time dabbling ill: politic_s ..with resulting
trouble .for himself. There is no evi-
dence, of any dishonorable .. conduct ·on
his part, .but neither is there evidence
of adept ship.. There is no evidence that
·he was a mystic or one with Spiritual
·experience. The Prince :of Hesse says that
St. Germain "was the friend of humani tyn
de siring money only that he might give to
the. poor; that he was a FRIEND TO ANI-
·M.A.IS;
and that 11
his .heart was concerned
only with the happiness of others".
-12-
He is presumed to have been born
about 1710, ·and according to his own ac-
count was a son of Prince Rakoczy of
Transylvania. It is fairly certain that
in his early life he was under the pro-
tection of the Due de Medici.
Out of a casual statement of Mme.
-Blavatsky that St. Germain was in pos-
session of ,a rlosicrucian cipher Mss.,
Mrs. Cooper-Oakley leaps to the conclu-
sion that he occupied _a higher position
in the R.G.
The modern St. Germain cultus has
taken this mysterious.figure, robed him
with all the powers of the real adept .ar.d
made of him a master - at least co-equal
with Jesus. Whatever St. Germain was
or was not, at least he WOrtKED
to gain
knowledge as his years of experiment with
chemistry sho~~ His followers of today
believe that Wisdom is gained otherwise,
and thus deny the methods of their lea-
der. The blind lead the blind.
