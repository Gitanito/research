Once the anesthetic was given to me, and procedure completed, while in the recovery room attendants and doctors could not awaken me. And so on.

During this time I recall looking around the recovery room and eventually, sitting up and moving. Being curious, I looked around the room to see what it looked like noticing the medical staff working in another portion of the room. Suddenly, I saw this beautiful white light slowly coming towards me. A man who had a kind gentle face dressed in a white cloth was before me. He stood to the right side of this ever-growing light. While I began to move in his direction, he was so welcoming and only spoke to me it seemed through his eyes. He asked me if I wanted to enter the light. I was overjoyed that he had come for me and loved me so much. I can't really describe the joy or calm I felt. I wanted to go with so badly. It felt like home. Somehow it was decided for me not to go with him and I returned to my body.
