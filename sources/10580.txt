  		              		Experience Description   

    When I was in  elementary school, I used to joke with my friends by kicking them on the back and running away into the big school yard. I enjoyed it a lot. One time, as I was running away, I turned my head back to see my friend whom I had kicked.

 Suddenly, I found myself floating in the sky and  could see from above, all the students moving around. I could see  the assistant principal who was standing on a platform. I could see myself lying down on the ground in the middle of the school yard.  There was a white glow everywhere and it  was totally silent. I felt no pain or any other senses, except that I could see. After a while, I suddenly popped back into my body.

   I opened my eyes and saw others had gathered around me. My friend helped me to get up,  took me to the wash room, and washed the temple area on my head. I found out that while I was running and trying to look back, my temple had hit the volleyball post in the yard very hard. I had pain in my temple the entire day.
