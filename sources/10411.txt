  		              		Experience Description   

    I have no memory of the event as far as the people involved and those types of things. My  wife and I had hired a nurse to care for her sick mother. I stepped in and gave the nurse a break. When she returned, I felt terrible. I had an upset stomach, dizziness, and shortness of breath. I was going to drive myself home and that is my last conscious thought. 

  The nurse called 911, and luckily the paramedics happened to be close by. They were literally driving by about a block away. They determined that  I had flat-lined and used a defilbrillator to restart my heart. The did this a total of three times because my heart kept stopping. During this episode my body went into a grand mal seizure. The  paramedics were having trouble trying to hold me still and keep the heart going, so several fire fighters who were there helped  hold me down until the seizure stopped. The fire fighters  told me later that I had a calmness they have seen at times under these conditions. 
  
  What I find fascinating is that my NDE is as clear today as it was in 1995. I saw a brilliant and beautiful light drawing me towards it. I tried to go toward the light but was unable to move toward it. I liken it to a real life diorama, where everything in my world was there but I was unable to get to it. There was no frustration on my part. I continued to try to reach the light. It was like a magnet drawing me in but I was not able to get as close as I wanted. In my mind, it seemed a long time had passed for me. There were no people, nor any visions of people. All I can say is that it was the most beautiful experience of my life. During this event, I was in no hurry as time stopped. I had no real feeling during the event other than joy and exhilaration. The watch-word would be calmness. I had no fear. 

  I cannot pinpoint when I woke up. I had several brief periods of being awake in the intensive care unit, hooked up to machines, and hearing the incessant beeping from those machines. It was probably 1 to 2 days before I was conscious enough to be told what had happened. The memory of the NDE came to me immediately after waking.
