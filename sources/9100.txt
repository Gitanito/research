  		              		Experience Description   

  I had known of Near Death Experiences for a long time, but I had never heard of Shared Death Experiences until just now while reading John Hagan III, MDs book 'The Science of NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES.'   I think this is what I had experienced.  This was not the death of a human, but of my horse.   I had worked for several years for a Veterinarian and I have had many animal companions that were closer to me than my human family. So, I have been present at the humane euthanasia of many loved animals, but this is the only time I have had an experience like this.
  
  Kiowa was my first horse. She was an older mare when I got her, so I don't know much of her early life experiences.I suspect  that some of them must have been unpleasant because she really did not like tall men in cowboy hats.  I could not catch her if she was lose in a pasture.  She did not like humans very much.  But over time, I won her confidence and she trusted me.  The last year I had her, she developed an ovarian tumor and started to lose weight. Her health was failing.  My Vet said she probably would not make it through the coming Winter or at best it would be very hard on her. The kind thing to do would be to euthanize her before that.  I kept her and loved her until I knew that the time was near and I needed to do what I needed to do.  I called my Vet to come out and put her down.  

  The Vet administered 2 syringes full of euthanasia solution into her neck. She looked up, flehmend, then folded her legs and laid down.  As soon as she was down, I threw myself across her body, sobbing.  That is when I had a vision as clear as looking at a large movie screen. I saw a green hill with grass and flowers, with the blue sky beyond.  Then I saw Kiowa galloping up over the crest of the hill. Her mane was flying and she looked joyful!   And I heard in my head these words,   'I'm FREE!  I'm FREE!  I'm FREE!'  And then she was gone.  
  
  That was 34 years ago, and I still cry when I remember this.  I have been present at many euthanasias but this was the only time I had experienced this.  Why this one?  Maybe because all of the other creatures had not wanted to leave the humans who loved them.  But for Kiowa, this was an escape from humans she did not want to be around.   But before she left she let me know that she was happy that I let her go.

I believe that if there is an afterlife for humans there must be one for animals as well, we are all composed of the same DNA and share the same evolutionary history.
