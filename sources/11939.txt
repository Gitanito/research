  		              		Experience Description   

    I was on life support for double pneumonia, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. 

  I saw my father, who died the year before. He was in a bright room and wearing yellow.  I was unable to see the walls or floors. The closest I can describe it was that it looked like  dry ice with fairly thick smoke in the air. My father said to me, 'If you’re coming, let’s go.' So, I walked a few steps towards him. But  I starting thinking that in that statement a was a choice, so I said to him, 'Wait! I have a choice to stay here with you or go back to my kids Mom and the dogs?' He replied, 'Yes, you do.' I said, 'I have to stay on earth because people still need me.'  I begged him to come back with me but he said, 'This only works one way. I can’t go back.'  I reiterated, 'I have to go back.' He said, 'That’s ok. I’ll see you soon enough.'

   I woke up at that moment and told my mom that I just talked to Dad. She told me that  I was unconscious for nearly two weeks. I had been on a breathing tube very near death. She said, 'Your Father died one year ago today.' 

   This experience was so real, that I have zero fear of death and feel as if I died already. I have the freedom of immortality even after my body dies.

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Physically, I was in a coma. But my NDE was so vivid that it seemed so real. I only have a few recollections of that time and the NDE was the most real memory out of all of them.

I don’t remember saying this now because of memory issues and post life support, but a nurse told me that when I woke up I explained to her my experience.
