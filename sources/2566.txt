A.:WORD TO
T H E .N E O ·p H Y.T E

Ivian11, began 'l:heron, has ·always had
a.~reat desire to expand in conscious-
ness and unde~standing. He has progress-
ed materially and spiritually toward the
ultimate goal - · onene s.s ·with the all
pervading consciousness. The greates.t
obstacle. in his ·path has always been
lack of understanding. The great master
Jesus. told his: dis.ciples that "unto y.ou
it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of Heaven, but unto them· it is
not given, f'or secling they see not and ·
hearing, they hoar not''. Lack of under-:,
standing has always .P.dEVENtEDthe master
from ~iving that which he desired to
give.
There are me.,ny people in · the ·world
who ¢tesire the goal promised by' the wis-
dom teachers &nd yet z::.re makinfs· no '1'.dlJ"E
EF'FOdT to find it. This is partly due
to teachers who having. no understanding
and knowledge 01' their own, · attempt t·o
point out· a way which they· have not
trE,velled·: themselves. Truly· they are the
blind l~.ading the blind.
No teacher who has not·coNSCIOUSLY
expanded into the infinite· can teach of'
the inf'inl te to other.a and even then he
canno·t truly teach it unless he has also
attained the power to h&rmonize the. vi·-
bra tion of his consciousness with the
-seeker and expand both into that plane
wherein the infinite operates as an in-
~9-
f'inite qu1:,lity. Th0re one sees und hears
unspeakable thin~s, comprehensible only
to another who has been lifted to the
same plane of consciousness. Many teach-
ers talk very glibly of teaching the in-
ner mysteries without understanding that
they have· a language and terminology all
their own. There is n law, material as
well as occult, that space is qualified
by that which occupies it. If the great
consciousness which we. s'ymbolize as God
is infinite, and an infinite thing oc-
cupies infinite space, then it is.mani-
festly impossible for an infinite con-
sciousness to descen~ into finite spac~.
·For -it to do· so would qualify the finite
spa·ce unti"l it. •.becomes infinite- .al so •
. Unde.rs.tanding. this law of ·qualified
=space, we know that; the infinite spirit-
ual consciousness does not descend to
the material, but rath~r that the spir-
·1tualized conr.ciousne.s 8 of man must as-
- cend to the infinite .plana and. t·here con-
·. tact the infini tt qu.t::111:ty of G:od. Only
thus can true knowl.~·dge b:e attai1~ 9d, and
only the adept cE;n show the .chela. · this
·higher plane of infinite cons9iousness,
rl.ealization of the infinite brings
to us an understanding of law that
changes our entire outlook on life. We
know that everything in all planes and
all universes is ordered and follows law
and therefore only through following
fixed and definite laws can we hope to
attain to the goal.
The individual who has butlt his
life on a foundation ct' law and order has
-10-
a much better chance of finding a master
than one who has lived in chaos and dis-
order. · Be steadfast, knowing that only
'through trial and turmoil Qan'the dis-
order which has become an integral part
of your being be eliminated, and the
smooth rhythmic vibration of the light
of the Cosmos enter.
D UT Y AND'
REALIZATI.QN
.. 'l'he attitude you hold toward you!'
· fellowman is a great facto~ in. your de-
velopment. In the l)resent da·y world
every man considers that he is solely
resppnsible for self, and perhaps for
those immediately dependent upon him..
He feels that if he has DOi~Ehis DUTY in
providing food, . f!h1,;;l
te:t•, and education,
. he has performed his part. Re does not
· realize that duty toward family· is not
by any means the most i 11por.tant duty in
·l-if~. . The great duty which every man
owes is the duty to spread the light of
trqth as he sees it. He may bt erroneous
in his conceptions, but usage and dis-
cussion will eliminate errors. ·
Another a Spt;ct of duty is that which
reflects the concupt of the brotherhood
of' man. 'rhi s is the :real duty which
evolves upon every individual. It is
t.rµe that th,:;re have been communistic
and socialistic attempts to force broth-
urhood and mutual h0lp upon individuals,
..11-
.and nations, but thc~0 are foredoomed to
,failure, -because brothGrh.ood in· its
:nighest and truest ~ens~ is not a matter
of out·er forcing, but is r~ther a result
of' the grow.th and unf'.o.ldment of the con-
sciousness. · · · · · ' · ·
,..
No one can hope to find a master
until he has gained th~ real concept of
the onene as of' man and. God, and: tho 0m~-
ness of all souls. He must be able to
look behin~ th~ veii of race, creed,. and
religion, ~ and see the .inner kinship of
soul with soul·. · When the master Jesus
·said, 11at that' day y~ shall know that I
am·in, the Father, the 1'"'ather :t,n.·me, and
ye ·-in me~"·. he w.a,s stating a wonderful
tnuth· which· has b~en misunderstood by
the· religionist of ·the present ago. ·

-·.,i -.-·Man- the real inner man, is a part
of'··tn•=·Great··Con"SCiousne sa'which·. is God.
If this ls rea.{ized. fully~ th~ s.tatement·
of:Jesus is clearly· comprehended. The
ancient t'"abbalH~t taught .of. God· as a
lantern· sending forth niariy ray~ 01· li~,ht,
each ray entering a human·body and·be- ·
coming an activatin~·consciousness. or
· soul, 01' that ·body. ·Thus we see that in
the final analysis the souls of all men
are rays of ..1.ight from the one Great
Flame ..

to be d-imrned~ or darkened,· yet ·.in the

the purpose of God in
was not created for
Deity, but as a means
to know more about
creating man. Man
the amusement of
to a definite end.
In a previous d-iscour·se I spo~e . of
the occult law, of lfspace being qualified
by that which oc-0upies it." The Infinite
Consciousness had to have a mediumthrough
which t~ step down {to use: ?,n. elect;_rical
term) its power, otherwise,. when it en-
tered the finite space, it would have
become Infinite.
Man was the medium chosen . by the
Infinite Consciousness through: which< to·
enter finite· space. He-acted as -a trans-·
former, so that the power of the· lnfin-
ite could enter finite space without
changing it to Infinite space.
:But why did Go·d desire: to enter
f::i.riit·e space? Because God is not the
stagnant, dormant,. per:f~ct being the
r~ligionist has conceived. God.is in a
constant process of growth and expfi.nsion.
If God were perfect there cpuld be noth-
ing new brought fo~th and no advanc~-
ment or growth would be possible. Ab-
sence of growth and expapsion is s_tagna-
tion, and God is not a stagnant being.
If God did not grow, then.man who is in
continual growth would eventually catch,
and pass Goa. This, to many seems blas-
phemy but it is far f'rom it_. If instead
of' looking upon God as a perfected be-
ing, we realize that he is the ultimate
of present perfection, we would discpver
the truth. As man grows., God grows,
and as God grows, man is ~iven new.and
-14-
g.t1eater. oppo!'tunities ·for gr-eater
growth. Man is as neces~ary to God, as
God is to man, for man ·is the hand of
the g~eat Maorooosmic Body, and it 1s
through the hands that ~ork is performtrl.
· 'Thus man is not the he·lpless puppet
crea·ted for the~ amusement, and enjoy-·
men.:t of God, but is an integral pa-rt. o-f
the Co.smic plan. rlealizatio-n --of the
oneness of man with God draws man· nearer.

RE.AS ON
ANO FAITH
:· 1
1':tlt; greatest asset to· the see~er on
the path is the development of the power
of reason. Without reas~n man ,,cannot
hope to find J;he masters. Many, teachers·
contend that reas<>n should b.e ·subjected
to faith, but this is aga~nst:a11 logic.
rrhe only power man has which .ena.-ble s. him
to discl'iminate between the true and the
false 1..s his. po)Ver ot l9·eaff0n. · · If he :re--
jeets. that., he·.has · lost his · power··of:
dlscri·mination·., and .cannot be certain ·as
to what to·be.lieve..: Man. can·:never- ·find.
God .: through , belief · alone, . f'or mortal,
mind,. -without the. power of rea-son domi-'
nating., is swayed by emotionalism., and
cannot see clearly •
. .:. . Lf Yi~ look around us. at-' na.ture we.
find a por:rect law and order opera.ting·.
'l'he seasons move in their cour•se, the
plants spring up, flowe.1.•s wither and
drop their seeds,. which in tw•n come
f'orth in the spring as new life. rrhe
pl.anets whirl on their axes and follow
their appointed course around the sun.
Everywhere we find exactitude and reason,
and yet we are told that the God which
created all these things did not use
reason, but is a God of blind faith.
When man refuses to use ..his reason he is
separating himself farther from God.
Con~ider the man, when he performs any
work even such as tilling the soil, or
building a house he does so beoause he
reasons from cause to effect. Through
-16-
using his power of reason the farmer
knows that there is a certain time ot
year to plant and another to harve~t.
This power has been developed throu~h
teaching, example, and observation, yet
when we try to undE).r~tand God we shut
Olli' eyes and walk blindly.
In th:.:: fir·st chapter of the Gospel
according to J ~hn, we f'ind the fGllowing
~erses: "In the beginning was the WOfil>,
and .the WOrlDwas with GOD, and the WOrl.D
was GOD. The same was in·the .beginnin_g
with God•. All things were made by Him
and without .Him was not anything made
that was made.· In. Him was life; and the
life was· the li.ght of. men, and the light
shineth in the darKness and the darKness
comprehendeth it not•. The proper under-
standing of the above verses is a key·to
tne unfoldment of reason.
The WOrlDin the·Oreek is Aoros, or
Logos, and has -been mistranslated and-
mi-sunc;lerstood. Its true-and mystioal
mea11ing was, not -WO.rill~- b·ut REJ\.00
N. Sub-
stitute reason for word in the versbs
just quoted, and you have th~ great se-
cret; "In ·the .beginning was rlEASON~ and
tlEASON was with God, and rtEASON was God.
All things were made by rl.EASON, - and
Without rl.EASONwas nat anything· mad~ that

SONwas the light of ~en. rl.EASONshineth

· Do you not see how clearly it ex-
plains creation and the ·or·dered univ.erse·
-17-
around us? The power of reason is the
ONE QTJALI':'Y man has which raises . him
above· the other creations. It ..is the
quality which man has which is r.espon-
stble .for the statement, 11tha t man was
created ·in the·im&ge, and likeness of
God". ·If reason is man'~ connection a~d
likeness to Goa, then logically' it is.
the ONLY path through.which.he can find·
God. By denying reason, and follow.Ing
bl.ind: f·ai th., · he has cut .off the. only
path whieh will ·1ead him to the true .God.
Th'e re·al. God is so muoh grea te;r than the
pa.tty; ·..anthro-po.morphJ.:c God.s. of re1·1gio,i1
that they fade into dar1,me ss,. when th_e·

REtNCARNATION
'l'he greatest reason for man's fail-
ure to f' ind a master is his lack of
uz~der standing of two great primary laws
of Life the law of deincarnation and
the .law· of Gau~e and Kf'fect -- If he only
understood the1h in- their , fullness he
would be.able to- so r~gulate his life
that it would run in far more harmonious
and peaoefui channels. Eve~ything that
happens to. the individual., ha_ppens. be-
cause of a fixed law; cau~e and effect ..
· Since the very beginning of ·.things_ eve-ry ·
ac.tion h~s created a cause and. th~ ..w~y
the. effect of' this cause·. has--been.met

is created new and uniquely for each in-
d1vidual body~ or one earthly body, and
after the.·t ereation it ·become a ·1mmo:rtal. ·
It must suffer,. endu.Pe, and realize, a

joy. I~ will be judgtid for its weakne~a
and sins, and punished or rewarded, .as
it has earntJd during its mat0ria1 incar-

We consider God just, and yet if.
th~- belie.rs 9f many -were so, God would
be·the very ultimate of injustice~ Con-
sider the soul born. into·the world. in

only f'or a moment or hour and · .passes
from -life; another soul. enters a body
-20 ...
and .l,.ives t'or fifty, sixty, or · seventy
years, and dies. Have the two had the
.s·ame chanoe? We must answer no, for the
c·hild who li7ed only an hour,- or minute,
had norie of the thi-ngs ·to meet and over· ..·
come that the one who lived· ·for many.
year,s had to. f_ace. · ·.
•.
· . The ·oriJ..'.ything which will give equal
justice. i'or a.J.l is .for each :s-oul-'.to ·pass
·thI'ough the same or si-milar experiences;
thus only- can there he .ejual justice for
all. We are told that, the sins of the
fathers are visited upon the children
ev~n to the third generation". If this
were so~-in the -light of the previous
statemen·t :that ·each soul was a n1
Jw crea-
tion, ·ood'would indeed be unjust. Why
Should a riewly created soul suffer for
tlie things ·another ,soul has done? It
would be· just as "lc,gical , tor an officer
o.f :~he. ·law to piak·any person at random
arid .mal{e theni pay the -penalty of the ;law

The real' reason why a soul 1s born· into
a~e~ippled or di~eaaed body is becaQ~e
it has, -in a previous life or incarna-
tion~ set Up oaus~s which caused it to
be· born· ih that kind of a body. The ·en-
v.irorimerit into wh.ich . we were born in

cause them to appear in their true like-

It oan al so be used · t'or harmop.izing the

the power to J.rive away evil, or nega-

Many people are aeeKing an easy way
to light, but there is no easy way. The

iv1aster only appears after earnest
and sincere effort on the part or the
seeker. It is true the roaster is always
ready to come, but be literally cannot
.until the pupil has made himself .ready.
Mastership, as far a~ HU.M.Ali
evolution is
concerned, is considered the top of the
ladder. Mastership means more than just
seeing, 01• being filled with light; it
means comvlete knowledge and understand-
ing of al.l laws or this Cosmic Cyole.
Everything evolutionary is sl•w of
progress, and the evolution of the human
soul is no exception. It has been mil-
lions~ years in reaehing its present
state of development, though it is also
true that countless billions more have
passed into mastership than have yet to
gain it. One cannot be mentally dead
and gain maste:rship; he must be al°!ve
and alert, using every faculty to grasp
the smallest hint that comes his way.

CONTACTING
THE MASTERS
Every seeker for. LIGHr has been told
many times of the Masters and their pow-
,-ers, but there are few persons who have
seen ot?,e of these Enlightened Ones, or
Masters. We speak of the 1~1asters with-
out oneself, but in .this lesson we are
gofng to show you the way to the li1aster
within yourself. Only the one who has
fir st developed master ship within him-
self, can hope to find the Masters with-
out. .One of the first laws that the
seeker must learn is t·hat God helpr- only
thos~ who help themselves. The seeker
who ·re.ally t·ries· to develop his hidden
powers and never falters at an obstacle,
no ·matter how g1•eat, is sure to ascend
frotf!. tha ignor.ance in which he is bound,
to a know.l.0dgt1 anct wisdom that will plaoe
him among the goas. ·
All ~hin~s# wha~so~ver, man has
ever accomplished, may stil.l be accomp-
lished by man . if he will put the three
lettered woi•d T.d.Y in & prominent place
in his .vocabulary. ·
The will· of man is omnipotent, when
.used to advance his mind in knowledge and
wisdom, for will is ·the concentrated de-
~ire of the soul. When the .soul has
growr . to a full realization of_ it self,
in -the mate:ri~l-,. it emits a -Vib1•ation
that is discernible to the Master a-
.cross the gulf of space. Faith and. be-
lief are not enough; the neophyte must,
-21-
through application· of ~he laws, ~row
into, and become* both the sending and
,rec~iving · f3:tation of Cosmic powers.

of' purpose, and the applicati()il to work

er has a desire strong enough to surmount
all obstacles, even though he be a weak-

neophyte mu
Rt learn is to ·obey .fo:t• with-
o.ut o.bep.ience he will be led a·str.ay by

not· capable -of attaining, it' }:le -is. will-_

Wisdom to help man see the- ·WAY.
In the Bible· you have not ··been
taught the true meaning of this Light,
which Jesus showed .by•Y:J.is ·Life on this

fieult to understand; first, because· of·.
the incompletene sa of ·original manu-
-38-
~oripts, which were written about .two
hundred years at'ter his crucifixion;
second, becg,use of the. many ·errors which
have ere pt i,n through its translators •
. The written language of the Hebrews
did,. not have any vowels or punctuations
until the rrtnth crentury A.D. Therefore,
it is easy to see how the translators
could. have,_ for example, chosen the "o"
vowel in each translation of the word
composed of two consonants.translated as
"sn", ·wheo other vowels could have been
meant bi. the original scribe.. When
"SNJHVH~was-written, many meanings were
ascribed to it •. · -The meaning thereof
which Jesus meant to eonveyto the under-
standing of mankind was the Stni of GOD,
or the LIGHTof GOD.
Among the· Jews the meaning of JHV!i
is considered ruiattainaole, so the pro-
nounciation is that of. Al>ONAI~ or Lord.
'l'o other people the word is pronounced
with the vowel nett and "o" and "a" fol-
lowed by a final silent "h", thi ~ giving
us Jehovah, a word meaningless because
uricertain:in ;its sounds, loosely trans-
lat~d ~s 11Go4", - but JHVH really sig-
nif;ie s the mightiest NAMEof God. Thus~·
we m.iiht . very re~sonably call JHVH, "'°a
power., a state of power, "a Divine Name
of Power", "a Divine state". The real
me~ning of the SUN STATE, let us call
it, (Sun of the Mighty Name of God) is
known only to metaphysicians after they
have achieved, through deep study and
arduous thoqght, · the necessary oneness

First, in our growth out of self-
consciousness into Cosmic Cons·ciousness;
we· ·see the .Light. At this stage we have.
reached the first deg~ee of Gosmie Con-
_42.:..
sciousne ss. Later when we step into the
Light) we ·are in· the second degree ·of
Cosm::.c. Consciousness. The second degree
· prepares us tor the ·becoming of the
Light it9elf; and _when we are _the Light,
we are Illuminated. It is easy for the
student to lose the ·path and fall again
into darkness. There are many pitfalls
.of ill us ion. ·many adverse farces to hind-
er him from a.dvancin~ on his path, .·yet·
keep on he must if he is·to win. Always
the. way is clear.ly shown to the one whose
desire and ,perseverance are strong arid
unbending. He must will to conquer the
obstacles that appear in his way. ·
'rhe one who has .gained Illumination
cannot lose it: while in that incarna-
tion, .and th6 way to regain Illuminat_ion
is never lost··in his futu1"e incarnations
unless he wills it. However, .each phy-
sical body into which an Illuminb.t·.1s in-
carnates, must be brought into attune-
ment ·1n ordor to become a perfect chan-
nel for the expression of his Conscious..:-
. ness in that body. In other words, he
mu~t go into Illumination from each body
he enters.
In the case where Illumination has
never been acquired before by a oon-
sciousne ss, · that consciousness when it
becomes Illuinina ted, is called a Sunof
Man for the, remainder of that incarna-
tion. However, if Illumination has been
acquired by a consciousness in a pre-
ceding incarnation, the Illuminated.one
is called the Sun of God and in the Bast
is sometimes ca.1.led a twice-born.

t_io!).s. to na.ture 1 s· circu.rn.s~ance s were vi-
tal and 0ver · pre sqrit •.. Then., his 1•eac- '
tion had to .be met :largely in a physical
manner. -He could not hide · behind the
-44-
screen o.f civilization, he could not
step to the·tulephon~ and call an offi-
cer of· the law for his protection:, nor
could he write a check on his malntEm-
ance fund and buy food with it. D.uring
these ~.tage s everything had t·o be met by
a defin.ite re-action, for :the.n he had to
protect himself. · and his family by defi--
nite· decisive actions, relying upon his
own physical :po.wel9s.
He had -~o, secure hi-s own food by
hard ef(ort, passing through many hard-
ships, t:o.o numerous to mention. ·A ne:-
oessity alw.ay's found a· definite, reaction
within himl his exp1•e,ssions were simple.-
He· did not know much of repression.
Therefor:e, we find; in ·the emotion of
fear., undel- pl"esent civilized conditions,
a mis-direction of·natural forces· through
repression •. Before, U:pon the appearance
of great.danger, his,emo:t.ional reaotions
started a vibration wi-thin his body.
This vibration started the adrenal gl.ands
secreting, which in turn stimulated the
muscle·s and nervous· EJy{3tem, ,prE}pari~g
him for instant aotivi-ty. ·
Thus energy, :upon being given. the
proper· outlet, used.up this secretion of
the blood,. and the body remained normal ..
Now,· under our present· complex system;
when undergoing the. supression of fears,·
we do not· have that'normal outlet. We
have the !'eaction 9f fear but are·· unable
to do anything . about i:t. · The. law has
taken it' out o·f our hands, . and we have
what is called· repressed fear. These
fears, them~elves, are much more complex
than original primitive emotion. Wenot
only have fear of physical danger,- and
fe~l" of hunger, but have fear of lo sirig
pl'll)perty and fear of' what people think
o.f..u;s. W.e have fear of our ability to
accomplish something we de sir~, fear to
meet_ people, fear to,. express ourselves,
fear in a thousand forms. The fear vi-
bration has thrown the secretion into
the blood stream and we find ourselves,
under present civilized conditions, with
no normal means of outlet. The result
i's -tha t there is 119 physical expression
by which it. can· use ·up 'these- stor.e.d ·_up
chemicals, or toxins. . This ~xpl-afns
many of the .peculiar emotions; and the
abillty, to trace them to·their:0riginal
~1;,urce _.;.gains freedom i'o.r' the .student.
The first consideration in th& mas-
tery of any emotion ±s·the knowledge of'
faqing the . emotion,· therefore, let us
face .and understand this·· thing called
jfEAi{ •. it appsars in the body as a ph.1,,--
sical vibration just beneath the solar
.plexus. All students.of m1.-:taphysics and
occultism know that by"' dr·awing the oon-
sciousne ss from one part· of the body to
another, ·reliev~s .the tension in the
o·ffending member. Therefore, after trac-
ing _and .understanding the nature ef' the
fear,·. an.d traoing it to · its ultimate
·source·, ·..;'the next step is to draw · the
cohscJousness from the fear center· and
place it in the brain, and here attempt
to think 06nstructively. This fadin~of
an emotion has the des;tred tendency to
dissect all negative '4uaiities and leave
only the plain ~ruth in view.

How well we reme~ber the fears we
had "in childhood".. .the fear of coming
punishment, the fear- of. th0 dark, the
fear of the bogy-m~n •. How we dreaded.
that coming pWlishment, the interview
in the woodshed· with father, but after
the first resoW1d1ng whack, the fear it-
self vanished and the pa in was not so
· bad as the · fear. How well we also re-
m=e:mberthe fear of the dark, (later on
that same fear is expressed in the fear
oi the unknown),.and po~ when we entered
the dark and found .there was nothing in
it to harm us, our tears vanished. And,._
as we became adults, the fear of the
bogy ...
man vanished, aewe reallzed that
it was only the myth of superstition.
All the follies of our groundless fears,
how they vanis:t).0d into nothingness •.
; We have considered the intellectual
angle of. fear, and now we shall consider
~ome·or·the things.that lead to fear and
which make individuals susceptible to
it. We have. learned that fear is an .un-
·eontrolled and 11 ttle under stood vibra-
·tion - a vibration that has escaped our
·Control. And now I want to call your
attention to the fact that any emotion,
-and all emotions, if habitually allowe-d
to rule the student~- will overpower him
with a sense· of weakness, will obsess
him with a sense of his being mastered
and make it ·difficult to view himself as
master. Any emotion which controls the
student and masters him, warps the j udg-
tnent and compel~ him to draw conclusions
co.1o·rect. by that emotion. Control in one
thing , .1eads to the mastery of· oth-
-47-
e.r faculties. Mastery of one school of
thouq:ht makes it ea~ier' to master other
schools' of thought.. So in becoming J?Jas-_
ter .of. one emotion,· it is then easier to
understand and master all' emotions.
In closing, I will give you the
physical aids in the qonquering of fear.
one ;is keeping· a_n abundant supply of
oxygen in the.blood~ Another is abso-
lute relaxation. · Fear is a state o:f
tension, and finds fertile soil for
gl!owth ,in a te.nse ,, mind and body. The
solar plexus is the storehouse of spirit.
A contriction of th:e solar plexus ca.uses
an inadequate suppl:y o-f vital life-f.orce
to flow to .the v_arious parts of the body
and to the vital functions of the brain.
In fact,· one of. the openings _to fear is
caused by the serise of inadequacy, a
sense of inferiority. . The individual
having a full supply of life-force finds
his mind functioning rapidly. He.has
confidence in his ability to cope with
all situations. '£he t'ear of inability
~o cope with si.tuations, · mentally and
physically, is one of the most devastat-
ing of fears, - and if.allowed to go on,
intermittently ove~ a period of years,
will result- in a collection of fears
called inferiority complex. All condi-
tions of.mind and body have a tendency
to reproduc·e. 'fher1:,fore, learn relaxa-
tion, learn the facing of facts. Learn
to take in nature's free air without
restriction •. Learn to laugh. Desire to
know •. · Stz-ive t? bring into expression
the qualities of yo~ better self.

-49-
life, yet the relation between life and
nature must be known, ..for. a well rounded
and balanced life.
To compre~nd life we should under-
stand Nature in all her pha.se s,, animate
and inanimate. Many people _think that
the study of natural or Cosmic laws is
too large an undertaking,· and that man
is too f.rail ·to comprehend the mighty
law:s o'f God. Is :it,. not . true that all
things, inoludfng ourselves,. are parts
of the inficnite whole, and are we not
l~:EU'ning something new every day about
Natu:re.? Why can we no~ eventually un-

tin,ti4lly growing ..tn com.pre.hension? It
is·.:~: question .of tha expansion of our
powers of undt;rstanding ...
A foreigner is required to know
something of the English language and
the laws of our government before he can

out· a working knowledge of how to oon-
dµct himself in the country, be a good
cit.i.zen? ' It is evident that such a man
could not be a desirable citizen until

the citizenship of the United States is
also applicable to every ·citizen of the
Cosmos. We are parts of our Cosmos~ or
God, and· in order that we may act as in-
te 11igent and. understanding citizens of
the·.Whole, we must kno~ ·the natural laws
of our univer.se. And as we know the
Cosmic Laws, we a.re able to live in har-
mony with them. Our sufferings and .pains
are primari.ly due to pur attempt to·. ig-
nore· or o.ppose them, knowingly orig-
noJ:>antly. .f)ur :happ'ine s,s and· prosperity,
physicaL and spi-rit~l., are, definitely
in proportion to. the degree in Which we.
liv:e as harmonious units of our Cosmic
order.
It ·is des:j.e.&ble that we st'.udy t'lie
laws of' the Cosmos ·and the re lat ion ship
which they bear upon our lives. It ..is
essential that we know these laws·· and
how we may adjust ourselves to them if
we. expect to live a happy and fruitful
life. It is, imperative that we know the
purpose of the order of which we are a ..
pa~t if we are to know why we are hel'.'e,
what is expected of us, and hovv to be
useful Co.smic citizens.·
We find nature: manifesting every-
where. If we studied nature as a separ ..
ate thing from. ourselves we would sep-
arate our field of study from the most
perfected manifestation of the Cosmos.
We would be discarding the instrument
which was doing the investigating, that
is, ourselves. 1

..In ow- analysis of man, .le·t us· di-
vide hj.m, into t_hl"ee parts or plf,mes, the
· physic.al, the mental, and ·the spiritual.

ti9n to '.the parts that are· hidden from

The human body is t·ruly a wonderf.ul
organism. The modern. scientists have
lea:r:ned a· great. deal about human anatomy
-5S-
and physiology but they all admit there
is still much to learn. Ip has been
round that the body is constantly re~
newing its chemical constituents. Many
noted physicians claim ·that the· human
body Would. · never weax-·out if man 'eou:ld
learn how to· ,avoid abusing· it •. · The ner-
vous system ;and the bra:in are· so ·con-
structed that, every cel1 can be·. brought
under the control of the mind, if one
has the knowledg9 and,wili to do so.
The human·mind is less understood
than the phys1·cal body. Some have; as-
serted· that ~he. mind is something .ab-·
stract and undef'lna.b-le; o.the:es even -deny·

is fo:rmulated·. ·
'l'he soul of man is so li~tle under~
stood that many people, even af'ten y:ears.
of study have arI'ived at ·the conclusion
that the soul does not exist. The mo·st
out standing reason for this confusion
is .lack of .real knowledge. Until -we can
understand the forces· and'-the laws that·
exist upon the three planes, we cannot
truly say that we understand life,'. :

as: inve-stigators wo:rk in the world of
. . .
-53-
objects alone, th0y will set up as laws
of nature mere theories that some one
else will inevitably later disprove.
This is the great weakness of the objec-
tive method. · The true nature o.f man's
being eannot be· understood until man has
studied lit'e in _its deeper, more meta-
pnysical as-pect;" only then can he ,un-
derstand himse_lf. ...·
.We ·have heard· it said that to be-
come truly educated one must know him-
self •. This :i:_sjust another way Of say-
ing that real edu~ation is for those· who
know. themselve~s physically, mentally and
spiritually. Man may :be compared to. a
chain of three links. Each link ·con-
stitutes a necessary part·of his betng.
The degree to which he is able· to iive
as a normal and healthy being d6pends
upon how well each ~art of him is func-
ti_oning. "A chain is no stronger than
. its weakest link". - .
The. physical body of' man is the ma-
terial tool of the immati8rial mind. The
bodymu8t be healthy and normal before
the mind can do its work ·.vell. The mind
in turn, must be clear end rational be-
fore it can be attuned to the "master
within". Unless the three are ·properly
coordinated and bal&nced, discor~ and
lack of harmon-y are cert£i.in to result.
A person .who studies only the ma-
t.erial and the mental phases of his· 11f.e
is ,not balanced. in his knowledge. He
iB: ,likely to see lif'e incorrectly and
disp:roportionately as one looking through
-54-
a certnin kind of lens sees only a dis-
torted part of the picture. He cannot
thus see the picture completely. . Those
·things which he does see, do not come to
his vision in tfieir proper places and
they appear in d.iaor,der, since their use
and purpose cannot be understood. But
if he understood '!;he spiritual phases of
life also,.· those dis.connected parts would
fit in harmony, beauty and order, and
could be seen where 4iscord appeared to
exist before.
The stude.nt of the material world,
~fter having rejected the spiritual,
usually looks upon life as chaotic and
inharmonious, without plan or purpose.
Being limited in his vision he develops.
th& idea that he must get everything. ·
that he can while the getting is good,
and the consequences are that he becomes
selfish and brutal in his dealings with
hi3 fellowman.
'£he person who neglects the phy-
sical and seeks the spiritual life only
is equally unbalanced. Most people who
do this are not aware of what true s pir-
itual i ty is. ·rhe spiritual part of them
is. seeking· expression in the mater-ial,
and this urge they interpret as a call-
ing solely to the spiritual. When this
urge has been kindled with the thing
that they mistake for spirituality, they
·believe that they are rewarded with what
m,atybe called a religious ecstasy. This
religious ecstasy may be ·round in any
n\llllber· of forms# but seldom does it ever
reach beyond the height of emotionalism.

ri'he exercises which you received in
these discourses will, if followed dili-
gently, develop and t:rain. yo.u in the
mastery of yourselves and of Cosmic· law.
Illumination ·cannot be c·onferred upon
you; you must attain it. By self mastery
you can prepare yow:'self for operation
of' Co smlc. law and self attUhement :With
the· Cosmic Mind. Each exercise ·1 s de-
signed to train and develop .. the cent~r s
or·povrnr within _you~ If. you.·
are pe~-
si s~ent in your exer<tise~,-you will find
you~· mind becqming' mc,re ~lert and cap_-.
able of better concentration, as well as
-57--
,:1ossessing many other characteriRtics of
attainment.
Only .through .t'fuiS1S1'EN1' '.l.:rlAINING
can mastership be attained. The Ftudy-
ing of the law without gaining ability
to operate the law will not bring you to
Cosmic Light; you must be a sKilled op-
erator of law before you can become an
adept in occultism. It is the purpose
of the Brotherhood of' the White Temple
to teach the Cosmic laws and how to op-
erate them.
The ability to project oneself on
the astral plane is the first great step
to the path of Illumination. The astral
plane is the plane of vibration on which.
tbe conscious thought of the mul travels ..
To the occultist this plane is known as
the fourth dimension. 'l'here are other
diw.ensions, but this dimensional plane
is most often spoken of among metaphy-
sical students, as it is the dimension
with which the beginning student makes
his first contact during the process of
spiritual development.
The fourth dimension is easily ac-
cessible to those knowing the law of vi-
bration. All dimensions in themselves
are, basically, vibrations of matter.
The difference between the three dimen-
sional, and the fourth dimensional
worlds, consists in the angle and rate
of th~ir vibrations. When a student can
project himself to the fourth dimension,
the other dimensions of tho Cosmo a become
aoeessible, for the astral is the plane
-58-
froru which one can c-omprehend the Infi-
nite.
By practicing the exercises which
acc·ompany these discourses, you will
cleanse your physical body of all inhar-·
monious vibrations, and elevate and re-
fine the harmonious one to a point where
you will be able to find the· Master with-
in. Before you can project yourself, you
must raise your vibrations to make oon-
ta·ct with the soul. The soul does not
lower its rate of vibrations; we must
lift our material rate of_ vibration to
the soul plane. When you have found your
soul plane, you will be capable of' con-
sciously projecting yourself upon the
astral plane.
Some of you have been taught that
you have an astral body, or a sort of
semi-material entity with:in your physi-
cal body, that it is material e.nd vibi-•at-
ing on the astral plane at a higher rate
of vibration than the· thr..:e dimensional
body, and that it can be projected out,
into space. Following we shall give you
a n~w conception. What has been called
the astral·body is no other than the FO-
CA.L POINT 01'' 'l'HE SOUL, working or mani-
festing ·as a connection between the phy-
sical and the spiritual plane. This
focal point of' the soul operates on the
fourth dimensional plane and can extend
itself to any point in space or time.
When you go on what the occultist calls
astral voyages, the only thing that
leaves the body is the focal point of
consciousness, which-is r-emoved from its
-59-
habitual point ,of physical. contact and
focused elsewhere.
The conception tha_t man he.s a body
other than t;he · physical is one of the
most widespread beliefs among. the races
of. mankind. We find . among ·. the ancient
Egyptian rer1g1ous wrftingi a three-fold
cronce p~ion; 1'irst, ... a physical body,
second, a periahable spiritual enti t_y.,
sn.d third, a soul. This spiritual entity
moves between the material world and the
place of t;h.e soul·; · o·r ·between the vis-
ible .and . the inv.:isible. worlds, and is
s,ple tQ;manifest: on both planes. This
same entity we· ca.11 the a st:ra.1 body. As
you advance in your st11die s · and exer-
cise a you will meet with ample evidence
of this explanation, and will gradually
clarify y_our understanding · of ..astral
pl;lenome.na.
We have . s&id that the a st;pal body
is the sou.l-lihou~ht 7:I1anifesting· itself
on the fourth din enslonal plane. Those
'i!hO have been taught that the a gtral
body is separate and partly ·material may·
. find 1t ha.rd to be.i ieve that ·it is, in
reality., just a creation of the con.;
scio11sne ss. -But furthe·r. experimentation
will bring absolute proof of this. Is
it not a. ,simpler method to remove the
focal point of con~ciousness · from ·the
physical body, and .re'":"·focus it els.e-
where, than to send out a partly material
body by pe>Wdr of will"!·
. Therefore, if you wish to make a
contact with a· pla oe, ('for {;;Xample, Cal-

to d0 the things that you have been
taught to be supernatural will be yours.
It is best that you go slowly and
thoroughly, assimilate the lesson ma-
terial as you-proceed in your studies.
It is highly important that you lay a
soi-id foundation upon which· to build
your spiri t.ual structure. In these le s-
sons and exercises you are creating a
foundation which will be so well con-
structed that 'il'ihen you have reached the
main path leading to the Higher Wisdom,
you will not· need to fall b~ck to re-
·build a faulty foundation. You cannot
become an occultist in a day; you JnUSt-
grow and expa!nd, making each day bring
you a ·step closer to your goal.· You
should not become discoura~ed when you
do not get the results you expect from
an exercise, but work more diligently
upon that exercise.
r.rhe concentration, relaxation, and•
visualization for which these exercises
train you, will enable"you to develop to
a point where you can project your thought
to any place you desire. There are many
other things which you will. learn to do

developing the power of astral projec-
tion.
Lie flat on your back, hands re-
laxed at sid~s, feet not crossed.
Breathe evenly and rhythmically., taking
the same time to exhale that you do to
inhale~ Concentrate :0
your thought onthe.
toes of your left foot., then the heel,
ankle, calf, knee and thigh: then change
to the right foot and repeat. Concen-
trate on the privates, abdomen, solar
plexus, heart, chest and throat. Hold
your thought on the throat for a moment,
then center it between the eyes, and
hold. it there for a moment. Move it to-
ward the back. of the h~ad - and- cen:ter on -'

as far apart as the poles. In medita-

particular thought to meditate upon.
Placing this thought in our minds, we
turn it over and over, looking at ·it
from many angles, examining it with all
its connections. This is meditation; but
it is far from concentration. In con-
centration, we have an absolute fixation

a
only after much praetice.
the ability to conceptrate perfect-
ly -is one that is v.ery nec~ssary., not
only . in occult: and metaphysical work.,.
but in the .everyday affairs of ou_r llf~.
Howev.er, no one call go· ·very.· fa-r 1.n:oc-
cult work .without the ability to oon-
c_entr.a te; therefore,, a great deal of ·our
work has to do with concentration exer-
c.ises. When w.e ha,ve the ability to con-
centrate properly,·· .we c,an ho·ld unwaver ...
ingly, any. object we ,may desire -to ex-
e,mine • . without outside . inf.J.uence being
a.I.lowed t_o .interrupt our thoughts, ..
There are certain centers in our
bodies that need to be awaKoned in order
that the Co-smic ~lind may funation through
us perf e<ttly. Tbe se centers are awakened
by .the concent1•ation ·cot'. the will upon
the object, _to be gained;.: While lea,rning
ooncen~ration, we firi&.niany new sensa-
tions: deveioping in ,oU:x-
bodie.e, and we
soon .find that~ as our ahili.ty . to co.n-
centr~te grows, we can influenc~ things
and· conditions around us. ·· ·
-Following, I giv_e a few simple ex-
erc-ises .iJ?. concentration that will .~ove
of great value to the beg-inner. ·
rl.emove. all clothtis that -bind, have
the room. as daPk as possible; hold some
object, such as a pencil, cross, bottle,
or any small ob.1ect , _before your eyes;
gaze Rteadily at the obaect, and try to
see nothing else. When possible, it is
well to do this in front of a dark cur-
tain or cloth. After gazing steadily
for two or three minutes at the object,
close· the eyes, lay the object aside,
and relax every muscle of your body .•
Mentally picture the object at which you
hav~ gazed as being directly between the
eyes, and hold this as long ~s you can.
Another exercise that is ·or great
benefit is to hang a dark cloth on the
wall; place in the center a cros,-s cut
.from· white paper, seat yourself about
ten feet from the wall and gaze fixedly
at th0 cross. After looking for a few
minutes,, try, by concentration, to have
it r0volve from 10ft to ri~ht, then from
right to left. ··
Another· excercise is to place a
lighted candle on a table -in front of
you, seat yoiµ-self and gaze at the
flame; concentnate 'upon the flame mov-
-ing right or left,= '.up or down, and you
Will be surpr~sed at .the way -the ·f·lame
'Will follow your thoughts.
All of the above exercises are very
good for concentration, but there is
another thing that is just as ·important
in,.ou.r development, relaxation. Very few
people r.eally know how to relax per-
fectly, yet it is one of' the greatest
and most necessary of all exercises used
by the ·student of' the occult.
Few realize that lack of relaxation
is the.reason the thingR they command
the Cosmos to m&nifcat do not materialize ..
We attempt to go on coricentrating upon
the attaining of an object, after we
have given a command, when we could get
much better results if we could only
learn to command, then to relax. But
how shall I gain this relaxation, is the
question the student is sure to ask. ·
First, I"eal.ize that relaxation is
more than just relaxing the muscles; it·
must also be a mental relaxation. Also
the ability to contrt>l the solar plexus
is one of· the gre.atttst aids in relaxa-
tion.
I shall now give an 0xarci se to help
you gain this. Aft1::;r achic:vtng complettt
_concentration, fully expand the solar
plexus two or three times, by muscular
action, not by breathing, then draw
three deep breaths, exhaling fully each
time. You will thon be able to relax
much mo.re fully mentally and physically.
Practice tht"; exercise faithfully
and you will soon be able to concentrate
better thari you were eve~ able to be-
fore.

THS:OCCULT CENTERS
Every individual desirds to func-
tion to the utmost of his possibilities,
though "there are .very few people who are
able to .do s.o. Man has started to awaken
to the cry "onward and upward". He seeks
development of self on at least one or
two o.f th~ three planes of bei~g. These.
p~ene,s .a.rei (1) . physical; · (2) mental;
(;3} ~pir:1.tual, and pe.rfect. balance must
.ev~mtually be attained on every one of
the ~e befo:rae the student can reach the
height.
· ·: ~very -ht,Una_n

power.to do ev~rything his mind· oah eon-

mind can barely. conceive ·in its pre·sent ·
stage of development. ' -
:•
. Before anyone can say ·ne is a' per-·
f.eotly normal human, he must be perfect-
ly balanced on all three planes. ··This
·.balance can be · broui?,ht about ·only· by
conscious effort of the will, and ··the
will functions · only where desire has
been awakened.
In the development of power we must
first balance ourselves on the physical
plane by training our minds to function
accurately in the objective sphere and
gain absolute control over the physical
body. Contr•l is the great essential in
the development of the individual. If
a person has the proper control, there·

is, no hei 6ht to which he cannot climb;
and if he lacks it, there is nothing he
ce,n c'!o as .f"l~ as develo:p:nent is concerned
ur.i~il he ;.:.;ta:-.:/1,,s
earnestly to work>t-eward
gaining that goal. HR.rd work, earnest·
desire, si21cere purpose, and the will
towa r-d acc::>m9lishment are t.he fundamental
requirements ·of th~ person starting on
the path of development.
Most of· us realize that we are po-··
tential gods, but have little concepti6p-
o"J::
how to awaken that 11-0d-power that is
inherent within e.very ·individual. ·
The· purpose of thls lesson. is to
show just how ·that C-oj-power can be
awakened and brought forth into mani-
festation as a.n actuality. ·
. Your ,physical; body was created as a
channel thr01.1gh wh:ich the Cosmic force

The answer is with you. ·
Man is con~ciousness manifested;
even his material structure -is basically
qnly consciousness in a .different rate
of' vibration. Wheri yo~ · awaken to the
knowledge that c-onsciou.sness is ALL, the
first step toward spiritual development
is-made. You AS·A CONSCIOUSWESS,
are
one _wi:t.h everything.; - the stars, the
planets, the trees, the rocks, the
lightning and the elements are all. one
with your consciousness. The great prob-
lem is for the student·· to rend the veil
of negativity and become Gonscious of
the ONENESSof all consciousness.
· r.rhe ·great ,reservoir of conscious-.
ness is dammed up, waiting only release-
ment tp manifest itself with full power •

.'11here are cert..ain occult or psyehic
cen_t~r s in your· body thr\t must be awaken-
ed."before the consciousness has a. free
flow - through your phy°sic.al · structure.·
In Yoga philosophy you are. taught.of' the
seven Chakras, o~ Lotuses, th:raough' which
~he· l\.uhdalint is dJ:"awn. '.Accord"ing to
Yoga tea:ch:I,n·gs., th!:lse are located in a
fourth dimensional tube - in a .I1ela tive
position along the spinal column .•- When
these lotuses are awakened, .power comes
t,o thti individual. This is a misconcep-
tion, taught the people of. the Western
world by so~:oalled Yogis who know little
of the subjec·~ them.solves-.

the body ar·E.; the real psychic centers,
and the forcu, instt;ad of flowing upward
only, first _flows down into the body
through the pineal and th0n through cer-
tain other centers, and then upward.
There must be a descent before there can
-be an ~scent. This force does not flow
through physical channels, but along
fourth dirr.ensional passages. The order
and sequence of this flow is this: Cos-
mic force enters at the pineal, mani-
fests in the spiritual centers and then
flows downward to the thyroids, adrenals
and gonads., and then upward through the
pancreas,·. thymus, para-thyroids, and
pituitary gland, and baok to the pineal,
thus completing the c ire le. ·-(For more
compl~te information exrunine the College
Work• of the Brotherhood). It is this
failure on the pt:irt of the Yogi to give
the downward path -that makes it im-
possible for the seeker to attain mas-
t-ership by the. Yoga method.
Jesus, the Christ, said, "No man
a.scendeth up into heaven save he that
de-scendeth from heaven." In this sym-
bol is given the key; namely, descent
before ascent. · The consciousness must
becalled down from the spiritual plane
and allowed to flow through - the entire
body,·before the God in man can manifest
it;self with full power. 'l'he channel in
inost of us is closed; the purpose of the
following worok is to open the channe 1 so
that t:he power· can flow through when we
