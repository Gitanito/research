 This was the journal of the Anthropological Society of London founded by James Hunt and Richard Francis Burton in a revolt from the politics of the Ethnological Society.  The journal was largely devoted to learned reports on current interests in cranioscopy and the like and is included here because of the regular contributions by Burton, A.R. Wallace, and C. Carter Blake and occasional investigations of spiritualism.
