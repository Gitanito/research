we are in a society that has been
basically frozen in technology
for
about a hundred years now we are still
using fossil fuels
for our for our vehicles
that has been the case since
1908 that&#39;s insane that&#39;s absolutely
crazy and all the technology that
connects with real people on the ground
basically has not moved forward very
much the technology that came out of
roswell has largely been held back from
us
and and it is getting ready to burst
forward
now
we&#39;re talking about teleporting an
entire spacecraft with people on it
that is another level
that&#39;s beyond say zero point or quantum
vacuum or electromagnetographics
if you had these other systems there&#39;d
be no energy cost
so
the average person that&#39;s why i said
yesterday 99.99999
of the world&#39;s population
wants to have disclosure even they don&#39;t
know about it they want these
technologies even though they&#39;ve never
heard of them
but
you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the problem this
is why we have to get the message out
that&#39;s why you know keep you know doing
documentaries and educational things
because you have to raise awareness
first
and then from there you can actually
make change happen
