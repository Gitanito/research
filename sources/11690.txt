    Zhihu forum 5/8/2015:  

 I had an NDE when I was under surgical anesthesia. Suddenly, I was like a cottonball floating in mid-air. I was watching everything beneath me.  I was in a white dimension where all the doors and squared windows of the buildings were also white. Everything was white. 

Gradually, I descended to the ground level where I walked through some pedestrians. Meanwhile, I met an acquaintance to whom I had spoke to previously.  However, it seemed like she did not see me, or like she was just ignoring me.  Then she walked away. I yelled at her, yet nobody saw me, nor did they hear me screaming. Then I heard someone telling me that I am dead, so people no longer saw me or heard my voice. They also could not know what I looked like either. Although I strongly felt like I wanted to do something, I was unable to change or influence anything at this point. I felt hopeless and frantic with my non-exist form. 

I came to realize that to live on earth is a privilege, and I was reluctant to depart from it. I had an urgency to return to this planet. I promised myself once I got back, I would live my life to the fullness that I could do. 

 Slowly I regained consciousness, staring up at the dangling, shadowless lamp.  I overheard the conversations among doctors. My whole body was getting warmer over time.

 It is great to be alive.
