  This, despite its recurring anti-semite rants, was one of Pelley's less political later journals, devoted principally to illustrations (ghost stories, guardian spirits, etc.) of his principle that "We are spirits clad in veils."  The journal and Pelley's philosophy "began in 1929 when an article by William Dudley Pelley, then residing in Altadena, California, appeared in The American Magazine entitled 'My Seven Minutes in Eternity.' Mr. Pelley had undergone an extraordinary spiritual experience, finding that it was possible to vacate his body in the night without death resulting. Immediately he became aware that he had acquired abnormal psychical gifts, among them the little- understood talent of Clairaudience."  The experience led Pelley to see Emerson as a precursor to his ideas.  Although the journal touted itself as devoted to "practical esoterics," there is little indication in it of what the practice might have been.  It was written entirely by Pelley.
