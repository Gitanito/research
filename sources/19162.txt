you
okay my name is Enrique Enrique
Kovac
I am air traffic controller the
controller I work on Mexico Airport
International Airport a name it benito
juarez i&#39;m a controller seems 25 years
ago a new mexico control center have
sightings with a lot of aircrafts and
this kind of this kind of phenomenon
they don&#39;t have an especially way to
appear shows appears suddenly and
frequently closing tracks of the flies I
mean the flight of the exposes on the
screen and sometimes goes with them
closer and the pilots scared sometimes
narrows first and then square give us
information about it earlier who is that
kind of object fine with us our required
traffic information in case that the
this phenomenon pass and happen very
quickly in front of them because we
don&#39;t know any kind of control about it
this kind of phenomenon of person
the Pyro&#39;s definitely fear feels in some
way consistency was insecure unsecure
yes about the D control that has a round
of the air
find saucers in the past that results to
hear that in the past results very funny
today is very very serious for us
especially after the incident that we
have with item Mexico fly 109 and think
well what have four years ago more or
less we have an incident very dangerous
with a an a identify object a flying in
a static fly over the wall Trade Center
building very soon a very important
building and for city that&#39;s is a
located in the final track of the runway
of the final of the runway is five from
the Mexico Airport so this way we have
working with them and coming from
Guadalajara to Mexico
and I pass the control of this aircraft
to the other controller in a point name
it passed the heat that that points
it&#39;s the beginning of the one or one of
the arrivals of we have their four
runways vice precisely and they we saw
in the window screen two objects to a
cause to a cause Belk loss of the
aircraft in that moment but very
suddenly and quickly and disappear
immediately we have radar contact
apparently more or less 30 seconds no
more and the aircraft it doesn&#39;t report
nothing about it I mean the pilot was in
report nothing then we know about that
the this aircraft in the final approach
arc in the in the final turn
it hasn&#39;t some kind of treasure or he
was shaking
do you see gopal hitting hitting in his
principal landing gear and the right
side I think I&#39;m assured for this kind
of situation this kind of object it&#39;s
important that you know that we receive
information at two hours ago more or
less by different ways
information about the people that was
watching that phenomenon flying a static
over the building then authorities that
was censoring about that what kind of
aircraft is flying there of course and
nobody knows nothing about it know
nothing about it and then we know
something about that the hitting of this
this object and was very very dangerous
for us for the responsibility that
represents but because we need to know
everything that be flying in our
airspace we have data pylos reports and
sightings at the same time in the Raider
you do yes we have reports a lot of
reports about the objects flying in the
very close to the final track about five
or four miles on final of the runways
0-5 it&#39;s very cozy that we have
information about that points precisely
in that week we had about seven reports
of pilots at different times to have a
traffic inside unknown traffic of course
and it&#39;s important that you know that
that appears on or that things appeared
appear in our screen just like Anna
point in a digital way and they move
definitely very very fast the other in
the human ear cups I&#39;m indeed talking
about that Boeing 727 point 757 move
some different way and of course his
speed is completely different
Sperry we use it in that condition and
when do you when you have the view of
the delta airspace and this scream the
distance between that kind of moments
represents are around 20 or 30 miles in
a second that is very weird and of
course nothing care with the order of
the human arrogance and ignorance almost
90 degrees in a second or in a half
second March 4 1992 we detect 15 objects
are west side of the Toluca Airport that
is very close up or International
Airport at 50 miles on list then July
28th and 1994 we have a almost a
collision or something that we can name
in that way with a domestic flight of
item Mexico one to nine
commands by the pilot
Raimundo Cervantes Verano we have a lot
of sightings reported by the pilots that
give us information about the rear
traffic or something
riding lights and different times he
said sometimes isn&#39;t and we have an
abiding light very riding
in front of us fine opposite or is
starting in a static line and we have
the same detection there so this kind of
phenomenon appears sometimes 12 times a
day 12 times at the month or that week
and you don&#39;t have information about
this of objects three or four months and
then appear suddenly and frequently at
the i/o Mexico fly 904 has another
almost collision that was reported for
the pilot course of the Capitan Corso at
11:30 in the morning and we detect that
object on radar
suddenly a just for a moment joining in
this way or ninety degrees turn or
descent immediately in a diagonal way to
very close to the mountains now that is
very different completely different and
completely different of course of the
the military aircrafts also this this
phenomenon of course doesn&#39;t come with a
flight plan
nobody knows nothing about them appears
when they wants to appear it is very
dangerous sometimes
the pilots turns to be hungry or scare
and require mmediately information after
that and we have information
what was the aircraft doing many things
a lot of pilots in reports when
immediately to have an unexciting do you
have problems with his his
instruments instruments of flight
precisely the electronic instruments
September 15 of 1994 we have in a
detection about five hours more or less
on a radar and a new equipment that we
believe that that Whitman was working in
another good way because it&#39;s not human
that you have detection by five hours of
the same object and apparently without
movement while we concur it with the
technical person so radar in our country
that the radar system was working well
around five miles - miles in some cases
it&#39;s very close for the email America
I&#39;m dangerous because the pilot that
doesn&#39;t know nothing about the day what
is going to do the other pilot well in
this case and a Mexican pilot has in a
having a terrified experience within
three objects that they flying around
there around them and two of these
objects flying on top of the wings of
the aircraft and the other fly in front
of them in the cup keep having them go
down and he can come single bear heat
hitting the the aircraft a small area we
have or until I know the radar register
that information about registered about
that information and
had at the information about the objects
in another place then close to the
aircraft then only one object and in
that bombing precisely the pilot reports
that he doesn&#39;t can&#39;t control where all
the the aircraft the movement I mean
apparently these objects is taking him
to somewhere I don&#39;t know but apparently
but I fortunately for us or for them
they live in his aircraft and and the
pilot very close to the volcanoes
precise and we have two volcanoes one
live volcano and it&#39;s very dangerous is
very close to the or city well a lot of
sightings was reported precisely a run
of the volcano
some pilots have been a sighting when
these subjects of flying saucers going
flying or going down in the volcano
inside of the volcano then the node of
the airport a lot of the city and
between two points one name it Pachuca
and the other is
San Mateo the others and the most
dangerous or was reported in at five
miles and the final cause of the runway
that is over the city where we are
around 140 controller zone on the Mexico
Center and I think that 50 at least we
have been information about at objects
and a scream and like visual contact
with them we have a very funny
contact visual contact we have an a -
Mexican aircrafts flying bound to the
coming from the north to the airport
flying - to land when one of them
reports to have inside and a small
object of red color flying faster and
passing beside him very very fast very
and the aircraft that was flying behind
of the first we post we have another war
inside when that happened we have or we
count with a oh one minute to having
inside and a lot of people run - to the
windows to see that to talk to try at
least to watch this phenomenon and they
have visual contact with these trees it
is three different objects different
color was what red and the other and the
other two white I think but very so
Brian red bright really brilliant okay
so and around 32 controllers have desire
the same sighting the same
phenomenon inside our radar and at the
same time like in other Raiders in the
world doesn&#39;t detect light only objects
solid objects flying that is very
important perhaps be the salaah Cuevas
case this lady had a siding with his
camera
at the same time that we have a
detection on a radar screen 40 miles
from that point at the same time and we
receive information for difference play
different sources yes about that this
that siding that&#39;s happened on meta pic
and after that we have a very busy week
with the ascites
each day for a week and then we have the
trouble with the I don&#39;t I don&#39;t make it
go fly 109 that have them a class with
their and a known object and the watery
center and like when you have
information about pilots controllers or
people walking in the street at the same
time of the same object the same moment
definitely you are talking about an
exciting very real November 1924 or 1994
we have an unserviceable
our new radar system and after that
moment we have information very exactly
about of these sightings at the same
time with the pilots and detections
that&#39;s why I&#39;m here because we consider
our my country that is very dangerous
the important thing for me and for the
professional guys like me is that they
represents a traffic and control traffic
and very very dangerous dangerous
traffic for our aircrafts and any places
of the world that is very important for
us and results to be just traffic
unknown traffic but at least traffic
we have registered information about our
12 or 12 or 15 acres at the same time at
the same time and that is very dangerous
yes a very close to the town and to the
airport also in a dangerous way because
we have a lot of but airborne landings
and a lot of traffic crossing our area
but it is very dangerous in a visual way
and instrument way in the same in his
film has a round of 50 small objects
well it is very important if a radar it
doesn&#39;t have detection after 40,000
these objects was filming very close to
the airport that&#39;s at three and a half
miles because we are checking that and
the people has visual contact with these
kind of objects can you imagine the size
of these objects
and like our civil aircraft we have tour
wealth for example a Boeing 727 we have
a 150 Souls flying well taking income
this kind of similar condition and the
size of these objects what do you have a
thousand of people there now we have a
lot of more cases but I don&#39;t want to
use more time in this the pilots a
report said the size of these objects
around 100 meters or greater this is
important
I remember in reports of mexicana
aircraft flying from Veracruz to Mexico
to have inside an Ana
an object over the in volcano named it
pico de orizaba another pilot flying the
behind around 40 miles behind of the
aircraft the first circle has the same
object inside and they are talking about
that about that it was enormous
they don&#39;t say but well you have two
aircrafts watching the same phenomenon
and between 40 miles between the
aircraft&#39;s the the object was enormous
it&#39;s very important that the people
there on war knows these events and
consider that could be very dangerous
for a logical situation especially in my
country I don&#39;t know why in my country
that&#39;s secure frequently but the point
is that happens but our Mexican
authorities had a lot information about
of the pilots and controllers reports of
UFOs in our country we are in Mexico we
are four control centers and 52 airports
and in the fork may control centers we
have been a taking information about
this kind of phenomenon of course in the
four centers on Monterey yes in the four
in Monterey on Merida
and mass at land mass at land we have an
information about that around 15 years
ago
to commercial flights and another
private aircraft but jacoti Baker flying
in Massillon aerospace very close for
with the border with the United States
the border a information about of four
or five objects flying around there and
they turns to be a skirt some way and
they decide if imma finally to land on
mass at land they don&#39;t consider safety
the airspace in that moment and I&#39;m sure
about and I think almost sure that your
your country has information because all
the controls on the world are victims in
some way of this kind of phenomenon and
the pilots also I&#39;m sure that in your
country a lot of controllers has been
information has been information about
the pilots report and reports
and sightings of pilots and definitely
they have been taken information in his
screams I&#39;m sure
you
