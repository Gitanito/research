During the coma, one evening, a ‘thought’, not a voice, forced itself upon me: ‘You will recite the ‘Our Father’ and you will forgive your mother.’ Christ appeared to me as a stamp posts on the retina.


Two weeks later, the same ‘apparition’ and another thought: ‘you will honor your father and your mother, as you have now forgiven her’, all the while in the coma.


Last Tuesday, after having gotten out of the coma and having left the hospital, no ‘apparition’ but an injunction in the street: ‘this evening, you’ll go to mass to pray for the dead.’
