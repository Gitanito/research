God prana she magic consciousness every
culture throughout history has had a
word to describe this intangible energy
that connects everyone in everything
decades of laboratory studies show that
our minds have a mysterious ordering
effect on quantum level phenomena
despite overwhelming scientific evidence
most people would still be shocked to
learn that certain scientists have known
that the force is real for a very long
time one of the people that I met in the
course of doing this work was astronaut
Edgar Mitchell who was the sixth man to
walk on the moon
we have sightings of all sorts there
seems to have been a great deal of
secrecy surrounding so-called UFO event
he had an experience in space an
expanded state of consciousness that led
him to form the Institute of noetic
sciences to study the science of
consciousness I also brought him to the
briefing I did in 1997 with the head of
intelligence where the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Admiral Tom Wilson the data on
that is since leaked out Edgar Mitchell
realized there was this connection
between space and these extraterrestrial
life-forms and the science of
consciousness that was very integral to
the study most of the people that I have
met with in seniors science NASA
aerospace and intelligence community
figures know that the key missing
ingredient out of most people&#39;s
understanding of the whole UFO
phenomenon is the science of
consciousness the ETS are trying to
encourage people to understand higher
consciousness and Universal Mind to be
able to have a relationship with them
good that&#39;s going forward into the
future and Edgar Mitchell realize that
quite early on because of his own
personal experience out in space as
the six-man welcome there what&#39;s the
nature of the universe we live in what
is our relationship to the larger
reality if that&#39;s a part of the larger
reality and we&#39;re denying it that to me
is unconscionable
