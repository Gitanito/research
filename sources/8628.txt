CHILDREN OF THE NEW  MILLENNIUM is the first in-depth study of child     experiencers of near-death states and the unique way they respond to the     aftereffects - as see through the eyes of the children involved.&nbsp;   Also     covered is how the Millennial Generation (those born between 1982 and about     2003) have many characteristics in common with near-death kids - implying     that today's children are being born with similar enhancements.&nbsp;   This link     is so striking, nothing less than the evolution of humankind could be     involved.        </body>
