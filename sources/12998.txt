  		              		Experience Description   

    After my heart stopped, I was awake and sitting in the transfusion chair.  I got up from the seat and turned around 180 degrees to see my body still in the chair. I also saw the nurses rush in to revive me. Everything looked like someone turned up the brightness on everything while slowly reducing the definition. I could see the nurse run in with the adrenaline and inject it into my IV. Then, all of a sudden, I was back in my body. 

  I was really confused as to where I was when coming to. The whole out of body experience  lasted several seconds to a minute. Ever since then, I have had almost no dreams or nightmares when I sleep.
