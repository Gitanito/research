  		              		Experience Description   

    In 1984 as a bus was about to run me down. I was in front of the left headlight and felt the bus come in contact with me. I was lifted up and then backwards and landed many yards away from the bus on the sidewalk.   The moment the headlight was in front of me I was quickly taken to a place away from the bus, there were several angel-like beings there and I was frantically telling them that I have a young daughter to care for.  After that I remember being many yards away from the bus frantically picking up my belongings.  I have always thought that this was an intervention.  The witness told me that he had never seen a person lifted up and backwards, he was amazed as was I.  I felt lucky to be alive!
