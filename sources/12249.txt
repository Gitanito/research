  		              		Experience Description   

    Hello. This experience  happened to my aunt. She is weak and because I like the subject of NDE, I am describing what she told me. My aunt is very religious. She had heart problems and previously had open-heart surgery when she was younger. Before this ocurrence, she had developed heart problems and her doctor told her she had to have surgery. The surgery happened and everything went well, but a few minutes later my aunt had a severe heart attack. It was  so severe that it caused her brain to move and then return back into place. She was in a coma for approximately 2 months. When she came out of the coma, she could not speak or move. She couldn't recognize many things or people.

   After while when she got better. She told me the following: 

  'I was separated from my body and went down a tunnel. I was moving from the sky and towards the  light at the end of the tunnel. I felt good. There was a basket of bread on top of my head. When I arrived, there was a door with two guards that would not allow me inside.  They said, 'This is not your time. Go and come back later.' I remember that I wore a dress. I also saw the future.' 

She went on to say strange things about a political figure. She talked about a prophet but wasn't allowed to talk (up there) so now she is not able to speak '100%.  She sometimes cannot remmeber words but she remembers everything that happened to her in this experience. When she is upset she says 'Why did you bring me away from there?'
