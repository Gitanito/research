  The meaning of LIFE...

  Why are you living (on   Earth)?&nbsp;

  What are the KEYS to   the Kingdom of Heaven?

  It is about LOVE. One   must love self, this way we love God. He is within each of us. We then can love   each other (including enemies). We are here to love life, to live life and   express back to our Creator our joy in having life here and seeing how beautiful   our world is regardless of how we make it. It is a very beautiful world which we   should all stop to take into our souls for nourishment. We are never asked to   endure more on this earth that we cannot handle. Our souls agreed to the test.   We were confident we could do it too.

  You may have asked   yourself: 'Why is there good and evil on earth?' It is actually a real battle   for our individual souls. It is why we all have a guardian angel or good angel   prodding us to do good, and a tormentor tempting us to do wrong. Our Creator   does not wish to loose one soul He created because we all are created out of Him   and His love. HE is LOVE, LIFE and LIGHT.&nbsp;

  Every soul before   coming to earth has personally chosen to take on a physical body and have the   life experiences they choose. Do not waste time in suffering in pain instead of   using free will to choose true love (God's Love). You designed the life that you   would lead before voluntarily coming into this world. Your free will within a   physical body was to be found only by consciously cultivating happiness through   thoughts, feelings and actions. Although, you have designed and chosen your own   destiny before taking on a physical body, there are many doors and paths that   you can choose during your life on earth. There is no judging or punishing God   like many religions say there is. It is your mind with an expanded consciousness   that judges itself with God and sifted its actions through the filter of   perfect, conscious love. &nbsp;

  To take one's physical   life is to break that law, with the result that there must be special care and   arrangements made in the spiritual world. In other words, breaking natural law   must be accounted for before one can go to higher levels. Because the person's   life was cut short and his/her work on earth incomplete, it will be necessary to   live out this uncompleted time in spirit aiding the very ones on earth who were   most hurt by the suicide. Since the motivation for suicide is usually to avoid   unhappiness, we can assume that the spirit takes such unhappiness into the   spiritual world. Any problems experienced on earth are always better worked out   on earth. The person who commits suicide has taken his life before his mission   on earth has been completed. &nbsp;

  There is a spiritual   war around every one of us that we do not see. Every person has good and bad   spirits around us. It is up to every individual to stay in good faith and try   hard to not let our soul fall into the hands of the bad spirits. People around   you have these bad spirits that also want your soul to fall. That is why it is   important to choose the people you communicate with. If you do to choose to   communicate with people that have a troubled soul...then you might strongly want   to consider helping them. &nbsp;

  You are given physical   eyes for the time you are on earth. These couple of years that you have to spend   on earth is a test for your soul. Your true eyes are the eyes of your soul.   Close your eyes for a couple of minutes and you may understand. A physically   blind man's soul may be more advanced than a man who has physical eyes to see.   Physical abnormalities may even be a test on ones soul and for others. It is   expected of us to show compassion when we see someone who has been injured, and   to remind them that what's inside is what really matters.

  Discrimination or any   kind of judgment towards another race / illness / handicap'(whatever) will leave   your soul in trouble. Each soul has agreed to the physical features, whether   female, male, parents, location, type of illness and/or handicap before entering   this world. God wants to see how each person will react when they are approached   by any of them and even those who live with them. Always show love. Every person   has a mission to do before they die. Each soul has also agreed to be &quot;born&quot; into   a specific family. God shows you the situation and problems that you will have   to solve before you go down to earth. Examine your life in the past...there is a   reason for anything that occurs in this world. This is God's way of giving you   chances to improve your soul. God's timing is always accurate. God gives you   lessons in each person's life...even if they may seem to be painful- such as:   sickness, loss of family, loss of money, an angered family member ...and so on.   No matter what troubled situation it may be...God wants to see how each person   will handle the situation. Remember...this world is just a test for your soul.   Try to help as many souls as you can. Most people on this earth don't know that   this world is just a school with many tests. Don't you want to graduate with   accomplishment? Before you came to this earth.....not only did you choose to   come to the specific parents you've chosen,(example: you choose your classes)-   but you also know the people you will be involved with. All this is &quot;forgotten&quot;   as a baby enters this world. If you see your life has become a huge challenge   and sometimes even too stressful'don't worry you choose this life. The more of a   challenge that you choose'the more rewarded you'll be'especially if you knew how   to do everything right. Even when you die, this still doesn't mean that your   soul has completely finished its task. You've soul has matured much more by   choosing to live on this earth for a period of time'but there are &quot;schools&quot; in   heaven to also help mature your soul. (The schools in heaven take longer for   your accomplishment according to many NDE's.)&nbsp;

  Each soul   agrees/accepts to their illnesses and struggles in the life that they choose.   Remember this world is just a test to get your soul to a higher maturation. Each   soul has to do their best in doing everything in life through love. We are all   Gods children'this means He has unconditional love for us. If you fail a task,   don't worry'God will throw you another one to see if you can pass. Always pray   to God and tell others to pray too. This is very important because many don't   realize their purpose on this earth. Ask for forgiveness when you fail.   Sometimes bad things that happen in life can actually bring a person or more   closer to God. Those who feel a great amount of guilt and shame and feel that   they are unworthy or incapable of being loved by God'are the ones that we need   to help. We need to teach those who remain tortured in the shadows to awaken and   realize that their turmoil is of no need. God is pure LOVE. The experiences   these souls had on earth were just that, an experience and part of their   mission. When they learn to let go of the guilt and shame they will return back   to the light.&nbsp;

  Understand: that there   is no God outside ourselves but is, rather, in everything and everything is a   part of God, as is life itself. (Hafur's NDE)&nbsp;

  That everything is part   of an essential game of life itself, and that to the degree that we live by true   love--unconditional and universal--the closer we are to an understanding of what   life truly is, which is true happiness and perfect wisdom.&nbsp;

  That everything is   experience and that this life and the next are essentially the same because   everything is God. Nothing is outside of god just as nothing is outside of life   itself. &nbsp;

  &quot;I,&quot; includes &quot;We,&quot; and   are like a mirror where we perceive the reflection of our reality in its many   facets and illusions (Hafur's NDE).&nbsp;

  Our souls in heaven can   choose to be born on earth when we want to- but we go when God's will appoints   our time. Everything is connected with full knowledge and understanding in   Heaven. He has predestined our births, our purpose, and our mission in life, and   our time to leave, to pass on to go home. There are no accidents - everything   has a reason. There is no luck or coincidences in life; everything is planned   out, right down to each hair on your head. Each soul is at a certain spiritual   level. We do have free will...and it is when you sin that your course in life   reminds you (eventually teaches you) that doing only the will of God is the only   way. If you refuse all the signs that God gives you to follow the Word of God,   then it is your own fault...(you are endangering your own soul, as well as other   souls that you encounter with). Before you come down to earth, God shows you an   overview of the people and events that you will encounter...some are events of   you committing certain sins. (All of this information wiped out from memory   since you are born into this world.) You are able to always change the path of   your destiny through prayer and actions. (Always pause and think before you do   anything- because the outcome of your actions may lead another soul to make   mistakes). The main reason why there is sin, is that hopefully you will   understand later that what you've done is wrong (your soul matures when you   learn from your mistakes). Your sin may help other people around you learn from   your mistake. Everyone on this earth will encounter sins in their lives...it's   the main reason why there's life here. Sometimes bad things happen for a reason.   God will not interfere with your life that has already been predestined or   known, unless you pray and ask him to. There are sins and bad events that will   occur in your life in order for your soul to mature; although your soul will   mature much further if you pray that you will not be tempted into sin. If you   pray constantly that you will not be tempted into sin, your life as well as   other lives will be affected in a positive way. By praying to God to avoid sin,   you prove that Satan (evil) is defeated. The importance of the future of each   human and how each individual plays on earth is an important part in the   development of each of us as a whole. Were all connected to each other and if   our life's plan is not fulfilled, it impacts the whole. There is no such thing   as death. Eternal life is of the spirit, and the body no longer has a use. It   returns to the Earth, from where it came.

  The more difficult your   task seems on earth, the more your soul will accomplish and grow'if you complete   your task with LOVE. You'll want all the difficult tasks you can get so your   soul can mature at a higher level. (You have chosen and agreed to all the   difficulties in this life from before you came to earth). Everyone on this earth   has obstacles to go through. God throws them at you because He wants to see your   soul grow. &nbsp;

  For example: A family   member has cancer. (Again; each soul chooses/accepts their illnesses before   being born into this world.) There's a reason why this person has cancer. It   helps people to work together to form a more positive atmosphere'only if each   individual chooses to do so. The family members feel sorrow and shows love to   the one with cancer. They may even try to become closer to the one with cancer.   They may even start praying to God more. The family may sense more closeness.   And, the individual with Cancer may even try to become closer to God.

  Each soul is in a   certain level in which we have certain lessons to learn. When we fail at our   lessons on earth, we still have to continue learning. Religion is a ladder of a   soul's maturity. Each religion is a sort of school grade. I also came back with   such a deep inner sadness over the lack of compassion and understanding in the   world over religion. For every person that completely devotes themselves in   their religion during their stay on earth (what ever that religion may be), is   helping their soul to mature. Respect all religions, because each soul had   already chosen to be in that religion for their own &quot;level&quot;. Eventually, they   will mature either here on earth or after death. Each individual has the ability   to help another soul mature.&nbsp;

  Why we are here:&nbsp;

  #1. To become separate   unique individuals. &nbsp;

  #2. To experience time   and space. &nbsp;

  #3. To gather memories   of what it feels like to have a physical body, which we do by forming memory in   our conscience which we will use after we die to re-create an image of a   physical body using the quantum physics principle of &quot;thoughts being things&quot; or   &quot;consciousness creating reality&quot;. &nbsp;

  #4 To understand that   LOVE equals God and Hate/sin equals Satan (away from God.)

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp;

  We become unique   separate individuals by experiencing separation and by experiencing duality.   (Some people experience death, some divorce (they feel what if it's like to have   separation). Earth has time and space - so we experience the emotions of how it   feels when a loved one moves far away). Race, religions, our weight, height,   color, culture, socio-economic status, personality, emotions, etc. all exist for   the sole purpose of teaching us what it means to be &quot;separate&quot; because on the   other side the feeling of oneness and connectedness are overwhelming due to it's   holographic nature. Even crooked teeth, the bumps on our noses, shapes of our   faces, etc., all teach us what it feels like to be a unique individual on Earth.   That's why we have to live a life in a physical body, so we'll know what it   feels like to be an individual. The feelings of oneness and connectedness are so   overwhelming on the other side that &quot;individuality&quot; may be the only thing that   can't be learned while existing in Heaven. Everything in the physical universe   exists in a &quot;dual&quot; state so that we can identify with it, and thus imprint on   our consciousness what it means to be &quot;separate.&quot;&nbsp;

  Our original form is   made of light because our creator is made of light. All is connected, seen and   unseen by the human eye. We humans don't understand and feel the connectedness   while living on earth.&nbsp;

  The other side is the   world of the quantum, where thoughts are things, and where consciousness creates   reality. It is also totally holographic in nature. That's why many NDEs say that   they went into a &quot;hall of learning&quot; or &quot;place of knowledge&quot; and it seemed like   to them the building was &quot;made of knowledge.&quot;&nbsp;

  We don't live for just   ourselves, but for all the consciousness in the entire universe. The knowledge   and memories and feelings that we are learning and storing do not belong to us   alone, but will be available for everyone to use after they cross over so they   can create a reality and learn on the other side. (There are no judgments   towards others in Heaven). Everything is shared on the other side. It's a place   where there is no separation. We all joined in on this experience before being   physically born on earth. (Even before the earth was created). Many NDE's try to   explain the knowledge that they received, but realized the difficulty due to the   limitations of the human capabilities. Time and space doesn't exist when we are   out of our bodies.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &nbsp;

  During your life   review, you will be able to judge yourself because you gain knowledge in heaven   to do so. You will observe, feel and understand why everything happened the way   it happened during every second of your life that you had on earth. Therefore,   one near death experiencer has made four helpful rules or agreements that every   person should follow:&nbsp;

  (1) Be Impeccable   (faultless) With Your Word. The broad scope of this concept is to avoid sin   against yourself by what you think. Sinning against the self takes many forms:   such as, putting yourself down, gossiping, or putting anybody else down because   you don't agree with what they think. Actions and words need to be consistent as   part of being impeccable with yourself. Our perceptions of others are merely   reflections of ourselves. Therefore, to put another down or project negative   words or energy towards another person, is to lash out at the other person   because of our own insecurities. Being impeccable with your word is the correct   use of energy; it means to use your energy in the direction of love and truth   for yourself and others. This is a powerful concept about using free will to   make correct choices that lead one closer to God. &nbsp;

  (2) Don't Take Anything   Personally. There is an awful lot of negative energy out there and some of it is   directed at us by other people. If you take it personally and take on the poison   of another's words, it becomes a very negative agreement you have with yourself.   What anybody thinks about you, or says about you, is really about them. Not   taking it personally allows you to be in relationship with anyone and not get   trapped in their stuff. This agreement can also pertain to things that we take   personally that cause us to go into upset. &nbsp;

  (3) Don't Make   Assumptions. What we think we understand about what someone says, how someone   looks at us, what someone means by what they do, etc, may often not reflect   reality at all, and more often than not lead us to think badly of ourselves or   of others, and reinforce not being impeccable with our word. &nbsp;

  (4) Always Do Your   Best. Your &quot;best&quot; is a variable thing from moment to moment. &quot;When you do your   best, you don't give the Judge the opportunity to find you guilty or to blame   you.&quot; You can always say, &quot;I did my best.&quot; There are no regrets. The other key   to doing your best revolves about being in action. &quot;Action is about living   fully. Inaction is the way that we deny life. Inaction is sitting in front of   the television every day for years because you are afraid to be alive and to   take the risk of expressing what you are. Expressing what you are is taking   action. You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the   difference is the action. Without action upon an idea, there will be no   manifestation, no results, and no reward.&quot; (More importantly: NO SPIRITUAL   GROWTH!!). This was the main reason why you are here on this earth, so try not   to fail yourself.

  For Christians- (and   those choosing to accept Christianity)

  The world of the Lord   is real. Every person is called to realize himself in the world of the Lord.   There is no other way to this world but one. This way is Jesus Christ. The only   provision and protection needed for this journey on this way is love. We must   all love one another with no return, no conditions or limitations. In order for   us to extend such love, we must immerse ourselves in the fountain of love: Jesus   Christ, through prayer. &nbsp;

  All people have ears to   listen. Few listens, few of who listens understands and few of who listens and   understands, works. Listen, understand and do the will of God.&quot; The person who   prays lives the mystery of existence, and the person who does not pray, hardly   exists! &nbsp;

  Examine your   conscience, reflect, repent and renew your life! The Lord has created each human   being to shine, to enlighten the world; you are the light of the world. Each man   is a lantern meant to shine; the Lord has provided a clear and transparent glass   to the lantern, to enable that light to shine and illuminate the world; but they   are taking care of the glass and forgetting about the light; they are caring   about the glass shape, coloring and decorating it, until it becomes thick,   opaque, preventing light from shining forth, and thus is the world drowned in   darkness. The Lord insists on illuminating the world. Your glass must become   transparent again. You should realize the purpose for which you are born in this   world. &nbsp;

  Christ knows what is in   your hearts, and it is your hearts that he wants. Don't seek for the truth   outside the Christ; when you know the Christ, you will know the Truth and you   will be free. The Christ wants you to be free. Fear not, and be sure that the   Christ has defeated the world.

  Life is also a trilogy   and it is in the three forms we identify theologically to God as &quot;Water, Air and   Light or 'Living Waters, Breathe of God, Light of the World&quot; or however we wish   to describe the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Much like the Sun being the Father,   while the sunshine is the Son and the warmth of the sunshine is the Holy Spirit   (Diane C's NDE)

  Words from the Bible:

  1 A.D. Holy Scripture:   New Testament&nbsp;

  ...Whoever hears my   word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he   has crossed over from death to life...&nbsp;

  I am the resurrection   and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever   lives and believes in me will never die. (John 11:25,26-5:24)&nbsp;

  If there is a natural   body, there is also a spiritual body...And just as we have borne the likeness of   earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven. (Corinthians   15:50)&nbsp;

  So we fix our eyes not   on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what   is unseen is eternal. (II Corinthians 4:18)&nbsp;

  ...The body without the   spirit is dead. ... (James 2:26)&nbsp;

  As long as we are at   home in the body we are away from the Lord... and would prefer to be away from   the body and at home with the Lord. (II Corinthians 5:5-6)&nbsp;

  Nothing in all creation   is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the   eyes of him to whom we must give account. (Hebrews 4:13)&nbsp;

  God will give to each   person according to what he has done. (Romans 2:6)
