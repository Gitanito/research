  This succeeded the Better Way, changing only the name and leaving behind that journal's financial liabilities in the process.  The inner workings of the journal, including the fraudulent financial machinations of its principals (who always touted the stock of their King Solomon's Mining Company) and its tolerance of shady mediums are set out in detail in the journal's competitor The Progressive Thinker.  In essence, the principals raised money in stock, loans and subscriptions for their predecessor journal, the Better Way, and then fraudulently transferred the assets of that journal (the presses, subscription list and good will) to The Light of Truth for $500, freeing the new journal from the trammels and liens of its predecessor.  See, e.g., Progressive Thinker, September 30, 1893.  The new journal promptly attempted to float $25,000 in new bonds, secured by the same assets that it had acquired at a valuation of $500.  The publishers of Light of Truth, of course, denied the allegations in detail too great to be easily believable, pointing to the growing number of subscriptions it was acquiring.  See, e.g., Light of Truth, August 5, 1893.  Willard J. Hull was an ardent spiritualist and active in the Cassadaga camp meetings of the 1890s.  Townsend ended up in 1907 condemning spiritualism as a sect, an event which ended the journal, which was merged into the Journal of Man.  W.E. Coleman, J.M. Peebles Lyman C. Howe, Jay Chaapel, M.J. Savage, Hudson Tuttle, and E.D. Babbitt contributed to the journal, as did the spirit of Henry J. Newton (one of the founders of the Theosophical Society) and many other notables of the period.  The journal also occasionally carried serialized novels intended for women.  From May to September 1898, the journal carried a noteworthy series of articles by Helen Densmore on reincarnation and its place in spiritualism.  At intervals the journal carried on its front page photographs of distinguished spiritualists, like Elliott Coues and Julia Schlesinger and of many lesser lights.  In 1895 the journal acquired the services of Mary Theresa Shelhamer Longley (1853-1928) as its assistant editor and "message medium."  She had acted in the same capacity for the Voice of Angels in 1878 and for the Banner of Light from 1879 to 1893.  Advertisements for the books of Moses Hull, E.D. Babbitt,and of P.B. Randolph.  By 1896, the journal was touting itself in advertisements as "The Largest Spiritualist Weekly in the World," a claim that possibly was true, given the state of the Religio-Philosophical Journal and the Banner of Light at the time, but the claim was rejected by The Progressive Thinker, which cited in support the journal's bulk mailing weights.  Beginning in June 1895, the journal also published The Light of Truth Library, issued on a bimonthly basis, which for $1.25 a year distributed the likes of The Light of Truth Band's  In Higher Realms and The Psychic World, Albert Morton's Psychic Studies, and Mrs. M.T. Longley's, When the Morning Comes.  It also published The Light of Truth Album with some 200 photographs of leading spiritualists and reformers.  The advertisement in Now, July 1905, indicates that the journal was in the process of conforming to New Thought: "I am an advocate of the Spirit-Man, the real man who lives forever."  By 1906 John Hazelrigg, the astrologer, was writing on the journal's front page on "Hermetic Law."  In the last issue of the journal, in June 1907, Willard J. Hull announced that he was utterly done with organized spiritualism, and declared that there were only four honest and truthful mediums then practicing in the United States and "warring, sniveling factions . .. now make up the rank and file of what is left of spiritualism," and with his departure from the scene the journal ceased -- though the rival Progressive Thinker was quick to recall Hull's and Townsend's roles in the journal's twenty-year promotion of King Solomon's Mining Company.
