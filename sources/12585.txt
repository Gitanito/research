  		              		Experience Description   

    I worked an hour away from home and was driving home in a snow storm at about 3:00 a.m. I was very nervous and my chest was hurting really badly. I remember praying to God, 'Please lord let me make it home.' I kept praying. About half way home, my chest  suddenly stopped hurting. About a mile later, I felt this feeling that I'm not going to make it. So I started to slow down.  

Before I could come to a stop, I found my self standing before this brilliant and awesome light. There was no tunnel. I was standing there in a dark spot in front of this light. All I felt was pure Love. I could not move at all and could not hear or speak. There were three figures in front of this light.  Two of the figures  looked like they were talking to each other. The third one saw me and then approached.  He had this glow around  him. He had a beard and mustache. He was talking to me, but I couldn't hear him. 

All of a sudden a figure appeared within the light. All I could make out was a shadow because of how bright the light was. He lifted up his right hand and the only words I heard was, 'Now is not your time.' 

And puff, I was back in my body and my car in a ditch. I jumpt out of the car, Praised the Lord, and prayed to get out of the ditch and make it home.  The Lord helped me. The one thing I got out of this is that it's not just faith any more. It's fact that GOD does exist. The pure Love I felt in the experience is real and I can't wait to get that back.
