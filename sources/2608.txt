INTRODUCTION
The Census of Religious Bodies, as its name indicates, is a census of religious
organizations rather than an inquiry into the religious affiliations of the individuals
comprising the population of the United States. This census is taken once in 10
years in accordance with the provisions of the Permanent Census Act approved
March 6, 1902, as amended by the act of June 7, 1906, and as further amended by
the Fourteenth Census Act, approved March 3, 1919.
The census of 1936 was conducted under the supervision of Dr. T. F. Murphy,
Chief Statistician for Religious Statistics.
Reports were obtained by the Bureau of the Census from each of the congrega-
tions, churches, or other local organization of each religious body. The census
data were thus obtained directly from the local churches and are not in any sense
a compilation of the statistics collected by the different denominations and pub-
lished in their yearbooks. Lists of the local organizations for 1936 were secured,
so far as possible, from the denominational headquarters, and much additional
assistance was rendered by the officials of the various denominational organizations.
The results of this census are given in two volumes. The statistics were first
published by denominations, a bulletin being issued for each denomination or
family of denominations as soon as the tabulations were completed. In these
bulletins the statistics for each religious body were shown for the entire United
States, and by States, distinguishing urban and rural areas; and for certain denom-
inations they were given by ecclesiastical divisions. Volume II (pts. 1 and 2),
the present report, is a consolidation· of these denominational bulletins. In
volume I the statistics covering all of the denominations are presented for the ,.;. ·
United States as a whole, by States, for the principal cities, and to some extent
by counties; comparisons are made with previous censuses where possible; and, in
addition, there is a separate presentation for Negro churches.
The statistics for 1936 were collected mainly by correspondence, but partly
by the employment of special agents. The enumeration of the Jewish congrega-
tions, resulting in the most complete statistics ever obtained as to the number and
distribution of persons of the Jewish faith in the United States, was made through
a special agent, Dr. H. S. Linfield, who was selected and generously assisted in
his work by the Statistical Bureau of the Synagogue Council of America.
The Census of Religious Bodies is confined to the continental United States
only and does not include any outlying possessions; and the statistics collected
in the present census cover either the calendar year 1936 or the church record
year which corresponds most nearly to that calendar year.
Prior to 1906 the census of religious bodies, with, however, fewer inquiries, was
taken in connection with the decennial enumeration of population; statistics
obtained in conjunction with the population census of 1880 were never published;
and data for the years 1850, 1860, and 1870, similarly obtained, are not com-
parable with:the:later statistics.
The denominations presented in this report number 256, of which 183 are
grouped in 24 families and 73 are listed asseparate denominations. For a list ofthe
denominations included in part 1, in the order of their presentation, see page V.

X INTRODUCTION
Changes in names since 1926 and other changes, such as the formation of new
denominations or the consolidation of old ones, are given for au·denominations
in the introduction to volume I. In volume II (pts. 1 and 2) such changes are
explained in the historical statement of the individual denomination and in the
table of comparative data; and in the case of the family groups there is shown, in
addition, a statistical summary of the denominations constituting the respective
groups for the years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906. In this statistical summary
which accompanies the historical statement of the family group it should be
noted that the group total has been used for convenience only and not as signifi-
cant of corporate or organic unity.
Since churches in cities and those in rural sections present different problems
of organization and methods of work, separate statistics are given for urban
and rural churches.
The order of presentation of material under each denomination is as follows:
1. A general summary for the United States of all the statistical items derived
from the schedules, showing the distribution of the figures between urban and
rural territory.
2. A comparative summary giving the available statistics for the censuses of
1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906.
3. Tables giving, by States, the number and membership of the churches
classified according to their location in urban or rural territory, membership
classified by sex, value of churches and parsonages and amount of debt on church
edifices, church expenditures, and Sunday schools.
4. Somewhat less detailed data for ecclesiastical divisions, such as presbyteries,
dioceses, synods, etc., where these exist.
5. A statement of the history, doctrine, and organization of each denomination.
This statement in many cases was substantially the same as that furnished in
1926, but it has been submitted to the official of the organization whose name is
given and has been revised to date and approved by him in its present form. In
the case of new bodies the historical statement was supplied by a competent per-
son of the denomination.
EXPLANATION OF TERMS
Following is an explanation of the terms used in the statistical tables, which,
as stated above, are presented under each denomination.
Churches.-The term "church" is applied to any organization of persons for
religious worship, whether under the name of church, meeting, mission, station,
etc., which has a separate membership, that is, no members of which are included
in the membership of any other similar organization. Thus each congregation
of a Methodist circuit is counted as a church, and likewise each preparative
meeting of a Friends monthly meeting, and each mission of a Roman Catholic or
other church, whose membership is not included with the membership of the
central church.
Number of churches.-In the reports of the Census of Religious Bodies for
1916 and 1906 the total number of churches, or organizations, shown for some
denominations was slightly in excess of the number of churches reporting member-
ship. Since membership figures have been obtained for all of the churches
included in the reports for the years 1936 and 1926 and for other reasons, it bas
seemed advisable to use, for purposes of comparison with 1936 and 1926, the
number of churches reporting membership in 1916 and 1906. These figures are
used, therefore, in the tables presenting comparative figures for these earlier
years.

INTRODUCTION XI
:Membership.-The members of a local church organization, and thus of the
denomination to which the church belongs, are those persons who are recognized
as constituent parts of the organization. The exact definition of membership
depends upon the constitution and practice of the church, or denomination,
under consideration. Each church was instructed to report the number of its
members according to the definition of membership as used in that particular
church or organization. In some religious bodies the term "member" is applied
only to communicants, while in others it includes all baptized persons, and in
still other bodies it covers all enrolled persons.
Separate figures are shown for members "under 13 years of age" and those "13
years of age and over," so far as reported by the individual churches. The
membership "13 years of age and over" usually affords a better basis for com-
parison between denominations reporting membership on a different basis.
Urban and rural churches.-Urban churches are those located in urban areas;
these areas, as defined by the Census Bureau in censuses prior to 1930, included
all cities and other incorporated places having 2,500 inhabitants or more. For
use in connection with the 1930 census the definition has been slightly modified
and extended so as to include townships and other political subdivisions (not
incorporated as municipalities nor containing any area so incorporated) which
had a total population of 10,000 or more, and a population density of 1,000 or
more per square mile. Rural churches would be those located outside of the
above areas. Thus to a very limited extent the urban and rural areas, as reported
for 1936, differ somewhat from thel!4' areas as reported in the preceding censuses.
Church edifices.-A church edifice is a building used mainly or wholly for
religious services.
Value of church property.-The term "value of church property" was used in
the reports of the Census of Religious Bodies for 1916 and 1906 and the term
"value of church edifices" has been substituted in 1936 and 1926. The figures
are strictly comparable, however, as exactly the same class of property is covered
by both terms.
The "value of church edifices" comprises the estimated value of the church
buildings owned and used for worship by the organizations reporting, together
with the value of the land on which these buildings stand and the furniture, organs,
bells, and other equipment owned by the churches and actually used in connection
with religious services. Where parts of a church building are used for social or
educational:work in connection with the church, the whole value of the building
and its equipment is included, as it has been found practically impossible to make
a proper separation in such cases. The number and value of the parsonages,
or pastors' residences, are shown where the ownership of such buildings was
reported by the churches.
Debt.-The summary tables show the amount of debt reported and the number
of churches reporting a specific debt, also the number of churches reporting that
they had ''no debt." The total of these is, in most cases, nearly equal to the
number reporting the value of church edifices.
Expenditures.-The total expenditures by the churches during their last fiscal
year are separated in the reports received from most of the churches into the items
called for, as they appeared on the schedule, which were as follows: (1) Pastor's
salary; (2) all other salaries; (3) repairs and improvements; (4) payment on church
debt, excluding interest; (5) all local relief and charity, Red Cross, etc.; (6) all
other current expenses, including interest; (7) home missions; (8) foreign missions;
(9) amount sent to general headquarters for distribution by them; (10) all other
purposes.

XII INTRODUCTION
Averages.- The average number of members per church is obtained by dividing
the total membership by the total number of churches shown. The average value
of church edifice and the average expenditure per church are obtained by dividing
the total value of churches and the total expenditures, respectively, by the number
of churches reporting in each case.
Sunday schools.- The Sunday schools for which statistics are presented in this
report are those maintained by the churches of the denomination reporting, in-
cluding, in some cases, mission schools or other Sunday schools conducted by the
church elsewhere than in the main church edifice. The statistics shown relate
to Sunday schools only and do not include the weekday schools that are main-
tained by a number of denominations.

ADVENTIST BODIES
GENERAL STATEMENT
What is known as the "Advent movement" originated with William Miller,
who was born at Pittsfield, Mass., February 15, 1782,and died in Low Hampton,
N. Y.~ December 20, 1849. He bore a good reputation as a farmer and citizen,
servea as a captain in the War of 1812, and was a diligent student and a great
reader, although he had only a common-school education. For some years he
was an avowed deist, but, as he said, "found no spiritual rest" until, in 1816, he
was converted and united with the Baptists. After his conversion, as objections
to the authenticity and inspiration of the Scriptures were pressed upon him in the
same way that he had formerly pressed them upon others, he determined to
devote himself to a careful study of the Bible, laying aside commentaries and
using the marginal references and Cruden's Concordance as his only helps. As
a result of this study he became satisfied that the Bible is its own interpreter,
and that it is ''a system of revealed truths, so clearly and simply given that the
'wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein.' "
At that time very little was heard from pulpit or press respecting the second
coming of Christ, the general impression being that it must be preceded by the
conversion of the wor!d and the millennium, a long period of universal holiness
and peace. As Mr. Miller studied the prophetic portions of the Bible, he became
convinced that the doctrine of the world's conversion was unscriptural; that
not only the parable of.the wheat and the tares, as explained by Christ in Matthew
xiii1 24-30, 36-43, but many other passages, teach the coexistence of Christianity
ana anti-Christianity while the gospel a~e lasts. As the period of a thousand
years, during which Satan is bound, mentioned in Revelation xx, and from which
the conception of the millennium is derived, lies between the first resurrection
(Rev. xx, 4-6), which he understood to include all of the redeemed, and that of
"t.he rest of the dead" (Rev. xx, 5), his conclusion was that the coming of Christ
in person, power, and glory must be premillennial. He believed that at this
coming there would be a resurrection of all the dead in Christ, who, together
with all the redeemed then alive, would be "caught up to meet the Lord in the
air''; that the wicked would then be judged, and the present heavens and earth
dissolved by fire, to be followed by their regeneration as the inheritance of the
redeemed, involving the glorious, immortal, and personal reign of Christ and all
His saints.
As to the time when the Advent might be expected, Mr. Miller's conclusion
was as follows:
In examining the prophecies * * * I found that only four uni-
versal monarchies are predicted in the Bible to precede the setting up of
God's everlasting kingdom; that three of those had passed away-
Babylon, Medo-Persia., and Grecia.-and that the fourth, Rome, had
already passed into its last state * * *· And finding all the signs
of the t1mes, and the present condition of the world, to compare har-
moniously with the prophetic descript.ion of the last days, I was com-
pelled to believe that the world had about reached the limits of the
period allotted for its continuance.
Moreover, as a result of his study of prophetic chronology, he believed not
only that the Advent was at hand, but that its date might be fixed with some
definiteness. Taking the more or less generally accepted view that the "days"
of prophecy symbolize years, he was led to the conclusion that the 2,300 days
referred to in Daniel viii, 13, 14, the beginning of which he dated from the com-
mandment to restore Jerusalem, given in 457 B. C. (Daniel ix, 25), and the 1,335
days of the same prophet (xii, 12), which he took to constitute the latter part of
the 2,300 days, would end coincidently in or about the year 1843. The cleansing

of the sanctuary, which was to take place at the close of the 2,300 days (Daniel
viii 14), he understood to mean the cleansing of the earth at the second coming
of Christ, which, as a result of his computations, he confidently expected would
occur some time between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844, the period cor-
responding to the Jewish year.
The public labors of Mr. Miller, according to the best evidence to be obtained,
date from the autumn of 1831, when he accepted an invitation to go to Dresden,
N. Y., to speak on the subject of the Lord's return. He gave several addresses,
with the result that many persons were "hopefully converted." Other invita-
tions quickly followed, and thus began a work which in a few years, though not
without opposition, spread far and wide, ministers and members of val"ious
evangelical denominations uniting in the expectation of the speedy, personal,
and premillennial coming of Christ. The first general gathering of those inter-
ested in this subject was held in Boston in October 1840. The call for this gather-
ing simply invited Christians of all denominations to come together to compare
views and to confer as to the best means of promulgating this important truth.
The Advent movement was further assisted by the appearance of a number of
papers, such as the Midnight Cry, the Signs of the Times, and the Trumpet of
Alarm, emphasizing these views.
As the time approached when the coming of Christ was expected there was
widespread interest and elaborate preparation. When the Lord did not come in
the spring of 1844, Mr. Miller published to the world his mistake. However, in
the summer of 1844, Samuel Sheffield Snow, George Storrs, and several other
prominent leaders, began to preach that the second advent of Christ would occur
on October 22, 1844, which was the date that year of the Jewish Day of Atone-
ment. Great numbers of the Adventists eagerly accepted this view. Mr.
Miller and Joshua V. Himes held aloof from any public advocacy of this theory.
But Mr. Miller did write a letter which appeared in the Advent Herald under
date of October 16, 1844, in which he expressed his faith in this October date for
the coming of Christ and announced that if this prediction too should fail, he
would suffer twice as much disappointment as he had experienced before. The
passing of this date without the occurrence of the expected event was a source
of great disappointment to Mr. Miller, as well as to those who had so strongly
advocated it, and their followers. Mr. Miller did not, however, to the end of
his life, change his views with regard to the premillennial character of the Advent
itself, or his belief that "the day of the Lord is near, even at the door."
In its beginning the Adventist movement was wholly within the existing
churches and there was no attempt to establish a separate denomination. Mr.
Miller himself during the greater part of his work was a Baptist licentiate. In
June 1843, however, the Maine Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church
passed resolutions condemning the movement, and from that time considerable
opposition was manifested. In some cases Adventists were forced to leave the
churches of which they were members; in others they withdrew voluntarily, bas-
ing their action, in part, on the command to "come out of Babylon" (Rev. xviii,
4), including under the term "Bab:ylon" not only the Roman Catholic Church,
but the Protestant churches. Mr. Miller and other leaders earnestly deprecated
this interpretation, yet it influenced some to leave the old communions.
The Adventists who, for either of the causes mentioned, withdrew from the
existing churches generally formed organizations of their own, although in some
places they omitted any formal organization, considering either that the time
was too short or that organization was sinful. No definite move was made, how-
ever, toward the general organization of the adherents of the Adventist doctrines
until 1845. In that year, according to an estimate made by Mr. Miller, there
were Advent congregations in "nearly a thousand places, numbering * * *
some fifty thousand believers." A conference was called at Albany, N. Y., in
April 1845, for the purpose of defining their position, and was largely attended,
Mr. Miller being present. A declaration of principles was adopted, embodying
the views of Mr. Miller respecting the personal and premillennial character of
the second advent of Christ, the resurrection of. the dead, and the renewal of the
earth as the abode of the redeemed, together with cognate points of doctrine,
which have been summarized as follows:
1. The present heavens and earth are to be dissolved by fire, and new heavens
and a new earth are to be created whose dominion is to be given to "the people
of the saints of the Most High."

ADVENTIST BODIES 5
2. There are but two Advents of the Saviour, both of which are personal and
visible. The first includes the period of His life from His birth to the Ascension;
the second begins with His descent from heaven at the sounding of the last
trump.
3. The second coming is indicated to be near at hand, even at the doors; and
this truth should be preached to saints that they may rejoice, knowing that their
redemption draws nigh; and to sinners that they may be warned to flee from
the wrath to come. .
4. The condition of salvation is repentance toward God and faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ. Those who have repentance and faith will live soberly and right-
eously and godly in this world, looking for the Lord's appearing.
5. There will be a resurrection of the bodies of all the dead, both of the just
and the unjust. Those who are Christ's will be raised at His coming; the rest of
the dead, not until a thousand years later.
6. The only millennium taught in the Word of God is the thousand years in-
tervening between the first resurrection and that of the rest of the dead.
7. There is no difference under the gospel dispensation between Jew and Gentile,
but God will render to every man according to his deeds. The only restoration
of Israel is in the restoration of the saints to the regenerated earth.
8. There is no promise of this world's conversion. The children of the king-
dom and of the wicked one will continue together until the end of the world.
9. Departed saints do not enter their inheritance at death, that inheritance
being reserved in heaven ready to be revealed at the second coming, when they
will be equal to the angels, being the children of God and of the resurrection;
but in soul and spirit they enter the paradise of God, to await in rest and com-
fort the final blessedness of the everlasting kingdom.
The somewhat loosely organized body formed at the general conference of
Adventists held at Albany, N. Y., in April 1845 continued for a decade to
include practically all the Adventists except those who held to the observance
of the seventh, rather than the first day of the week as the Sabbath. In 1855
the discussions, in which Jonathan Cummings had so prominent a part, resulted
in the withdrawal of some members and the subsequent organization of the
Advent Christian Church. The Adventists who continued their adherence to
the original body were for the most part those who believed in the doctrine of
the conscious state of the dead and the eternal suffering of the wicked, claiming
on these points to be in accord with the personal views of Mr. Miller. They,
however, felt the need of closer association, and in 1858 organized at Boston,
Mass., the American Millennia! Association, partly for the purpose of publishing
material in support of their belief and partly as a basis of fellowship. Some
years later the members of this society adopted the term "Evangelical Advent-
ists" as a denominational name, with a view to distinguishing themselves from
other bodies with which they differed on doctrinal points.
· For some years the association published a p_eriodical bearing at different
periods the names, Signs of the Times, Advent Herald, Messiah's Herald, and
Herald of the Coming One. It contributed to the support of the China Inland
Mission and of laborers and missions in other fields, but as the older members
died many of the younger families joined other evangelical denominations, and
the number of churches and members diminished rapidly. In 1906 they re-
ported 18 organizations with 481 members, 16 church edifices, and $27,050 as
value of church property; 9 Sunday schools with 57 officers and teachers and 264
scholars; and 8 ministers. When the inquiries for the census of 1916 were made, it
appeared that all the churches, except a few in Pennsylvania, had disbanded or
diacontinued .all services, and from those in Pennsylvania no information could
be obtained. The denomination as an ecclesiastical body has, therefore, been
dropped from this report.
Discussions in regard to the nature of the Advent, and particularly in regard
to the future life, resulted in the formation of other bodies independent in
organization but agreeing in the belief that the Advent is to be personal and
premillennial and is near at hand and in their recognition of the influence of Mr.
Miller and those immediately associated with him.
The denominations grouped under the name Adventist in 1936, 1926, 1916, and
1906 are listed in the summary table following, with the principal statistics as
reported for the four periods. Two bodies listed in 1906 were not included in the
table for 1916 or later censuses. The omission of the Evangelical Adventists is

explained in a preceding paragraph. The Churches of God (Adventist), Unat-
tached Congregations, if any of these churches existed in 1936, 1926, or 1916, were
probably included among the independent chuNIJ.es or merged with other Ad-
ventist bodies. The denomination reported prior to 1936 as "Churches of God in
Christ Jesus" is more or less a local name, and it is also known, in some localities,
as "Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith." An investigation shows the general
conference to be organized under the name "Church of God," but in order to dis-
tinguish it from many other churches of this name the location of its headquarters
is added for definiteness, as "Church of God (Oregon, Ill.)."
These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by
the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to these churches
only.

ADVENT CHRISTIAN CHURCH
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
15
The disappointment felt by the Adventists at the passing of October 22, 1844,
the date set by S. S. Snow for the second advent of Christ, resulted in confusion and
much discussion as to the accuracy of the calculations. In 1852, Jonathan Cum-
mings, F. H. Berick, and several others, mostly young men who had recently
joined the Advent movement, began to teach that the Lord had bestowed upon
them the "high and distinguishing gift of understanding the time" for the coming
of Christ, which they claimed would be in the autumn of 1853 or the spring of
1854. Inasmuch as this view was not acceptable to the main body of Adventists,
a paper was started in Lowell, Mass., and named The World's Crisis, for the
advocacy of this 1854-time argument. This caused a division among the Advent-
ists. When 1854 passed without bringing the end of the age the men who had
led the movement admitted their mistake, and it was hoped that their followers
would rejoin the original body.
By this time, however, a well-marked difference of opinion had developed
among the Adventists in reference to the immortality of the soul. The followers
of Mr. Cummings had for the most part accepted the doctrine that man is by
nature wholly mortal and is unconscious in death, and that immortality is not
inherent in mankind, but is the gift of God to be bestowed in the resurrection on
those only who have been true followers of Christ. The main body of Adventists,
on the other hand, accepted, in general, the doctrine of the conscious state of the
dead and the eternal suffering of the wicked. Owing largely to this difference,
which they considered to be upon a vital point, when a general conference met
at Boston, June 5, 1855, the followers of Mr. Cummings did not unite in it, but
held a conference of their own on the same day. From this time the separation
between the two bodies was definitely recognized. Those who had separated
from the main body organized the Advent Christian Association at Worcester,
Mass., November 6, 1861, and have since borne the name "Advent Christian
Church." This branch of the Adventists now holds simP.lY to the general im-
minence of Christ's return, but takes the position that 'no man knoweth the
day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh." They also emphasize that
side of their faith which deals with the nature of man.
DOCTRINE
The Declaration of Principles held by this church, as unanimously approved
by the Advent Christian Association and General Conference of America, in
1900, em.I>hasizes the following points:
1. The Bible is the Word of God, containing a revelation given to man under
divine supervision and providence; its historical statements are correct, and it is
the only divine standard of faith and practice.
2. As revealed in the Bible, (a) there is one God, the Father, Creator of all
things; (b) Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, came into the world, died
for man's sins, was raised for his justification, ascended into heaven as the High
Priest and Mediator, and will come again to judge the living and the dead, and
reign forever and ever; (c) the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, sent from God to
convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, sanctifies man and
seals him unto the day of redemption.
3. Man was created for immortality, but through sin has forfeited his divine
birthright, and only through faith in Christ can become partaker of the divine
nature and live forever.
.4. Death is, to all persons, righteous and wicked, a condition of unconscious-
ness, to remain unchanged until the resurrection at Christ's second coming, when
the righteous will receive everlasting life, while the wicked will be "punished with
everlasting destruction," suffering complete extinction of being.
5. Salvation is free to all who in this life and age accept the conditions, all
hope of future probation or universal salvation bein~ excluded. .
6. Jesus Christ, according to His promise, will, ' in like manner" as He went
into heaven, come again to this earth to reign forever, and this coming is the
hope of the church, inasmuch as upon it depend the reward of the righteous, the
abolition of sin, and the renewal of the earth to become the eternal home of the
redeemed.
1 Thls statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II or the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. C. H. Hewitt, secretary or the Advent Christian General Conferenoe
of America, Aurora, Ill., and approved by him In Its present form.

16 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
7. Bible prophecy indicates the approximate time of Christ's return, and the
great duty of the hour is the proclamation of this soon-coming redemption.
8. The church, an institution of divine origin, includes all Christians of what-
ever name, but the local organization should be independent of outside control,
subject to no dictation of priest, bishop, or pope, although recognizing true
fellowship and unity of action.
9. The only ordinances recognized are baptism and the Lord's Supper, im-
mersion being considered the only true baptism. Admission to the church is by
vote of the majority after baptism and profession of faith. Open communion is
practiced and the invitation to the Lord's Supper is general, participation being
left to the individual.
10. The first day of the week, set apart by the early church in commemoration
of the resurrection, is held to be the proper Christian Sabbath, to be observed as
a day of rest and religious worship.
11. War as a means of settling international disputes is held to be contrary to
the spirit and teachings of Christ, contrary to the spirit of true brotherhood, and
inimical to the welfare of humanity. Christians are justified in refusing to bear
arms for conscience' sake.
ORGANIZATION
In accordance with the principles outlined, the Advent Christian Church is
congregational in church government, each church being absolutely independent
in its own management. Local elders (not ordained) and deacons are elected
annually, as are the various officials and committees. The elders have charge
of the religious services when the church has no pastor, and the deacons care for
the poor and serve as bearers at the communion service, which is usually held each
month. Women equally with men are eligible to office.
For fellowship and the better conduct of such work as belongs to them in com-
mon, the churches are associated in annual conferences, which·are grouped in
five districts, while the Advent Christian General Conference represents the
entire denomination. According to the constitution adopted at Boston, May 20,
1915, the object of this conference is: To advance the interests of and unify the
Advent Christian people in their various branches of work; hold biennial sessions
for the transaction of business and the discussion of questions of interest to the
churches; devise the best methods for the conduct of the finances of the churches
and the cooperating societies; cooperate with the churches in securing pastors
and in utilizing the services of worthy men; act as a board of appeal; establish a
bureau of statistics; publish a biennial manual; and deal with any matters affecting
the welfare of the churches.
The membership of the General Conference consists of delegates chosen by
the annual conferences, one for each conference, and one for each 400 members
of the conference churches above the first 400, together with the officers and one
delegate from each cooperating society.
The organization of the General Conference as of 1936 includes as officers a
president, five vice presidents (who serve as regional superintendents of con-
ference work in the five districts), a secretary, who serves as the executive of
the conference, and a treasurer. In each of the five regions there is a board of
councilors, the vice president for each region being the chairman of the regional
board. The national officers named above constitute an executive committee
which has full charge of the General Conference activities between biennial
sessions. The General Conference acts in an advisory capacity only, but there
is a growing tendency to recognize its leadership in general denominational life.
The General Conference headquarters are in Boston, Mass.
There is one publication house located in each of the following cities: Boston,
Mass., Oakland, Calif., and Live Oak, Fla.
Ordination to the ministry rests with the conferences. It takes place on
request of a church, after examination of the applicant by a committee, vote of
the conference, and the appointment of an ordaining committee. The minister
becomes a member of the conference which ordained him. In the reception of
ministers from other bodies previous ordination is accepted.

WORK
The denominational activities of the Advent Christian Church are carried on
mainly through the American Advent Mission Society, the Woman's Home and
Foreign Mission Society, four publication societies, and regional organizations.
The American Advent Mission Society, which does both home and foreign
mission work, is incorporated and operates under the General Conference,
although it is independent in its organization. Its officers are elected by delegates
from the various churches and conferences, and its meetings are held annually.
The Woman's Home and Foreign Mission Society is also independent of the
General Conference in organization and operates similarly. This organization
is made up of local societies connected with the various churches. Its officers
are elected annually by delegates from the local societies. The foreign program
of this society is confined to India, and its home work is chiefly in the interest
of a home for students of the New England School of Theology. There is a West-
ern Home Mission Board which does about the same work in the Middle West
that the American Advent Mission Society does in the East, except that its
~;~phere is confined to home missions. There is also a woman's society called the
Helper's Union and Central Mission Branch, doing both home and foreign mission
work. The number of missionaries and evangelists employed during the year was
30 and the number of churches aided, 50. Contributions of more than $75,000
were received. A large part of the home missionary and philanthropic work
is done by the State conferences.
In the foreign field, 9 stations are occupied, in addition to 26 out-stations, in
India, China, and Japan. The report for 1936 shows 11 American missionaries,
with a force of well over 100 native evangelists, teachers, and colporteurs con-
stantly employed with the missionaries at the various stations; 23 churches with
2,273 members; 2 training schools, an industrial school, 2 secondary schools, 17
elementary schools, and several night schools in India, besides an academy, a
girls' school, and several elementary schools in China; a hospital, a nursing home,
5 dispensaries and rural clinics, and 3 orphanages. The value of property on
the foreign field is estimated at $133,361.
Two educational institutions, for which over $10,000 in addition to proceeds
from endowment and personal gifts were contributed in 1936, are carried on
under their auspices in the United States. They include a college at Aurora, Ill.,
and a theological school at Boston. The two institutions reported 230 students
and property valued at $381,761, including an endowment of over $300,000,
which it is hoped will be increased to $500,000. The denomination maintains one
orphanage in the South, and, in connection with it, a home for the aged; there
is also a home for the aged in New England. The southern property, at Dowling
Park, Fla., consisting of two new fireproof buildings and several frame buildings,
is valued at $75,000, and $10,000 was contributed for its support in 1936. The
New England property at South Vernon, Malls., consists of a commodious build-
ing of 27 rooms and about 3 acres of land, valued at about $10,000.
The young people of the denomination are organized in a Youn!!: People'11
Loyal Workers Society, which in 1936 included 135 branches, with a membership
of 8,352.

SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST DENOMINATION
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
27
The religious denomination known as Seventh-day Adventists had its rise about
the middle of the nineteenth century. The name is based upon two of the dis-
tinctive beliefs they hold, namely, the observance of the Sabbath of the Scriptures,
and the imminent, personal second advent of Christ.
In those years, not only in the United States, but in other countries of the world,
many students of Bible prophecy became convinced that the second advent was
drawing near, and this belief resulted in a great religious awakening, in Britain, in
some countries of the Continent of Europe, and il;l North America. "Whether
this doctrine is orthodox or not," wrote the historian Macaulay, in 1829, "many
who hold it are distinguished by rank, wealth, and ability. It is preached from
pulpits both of the Scottish and of the English church." One English writer of the
time estimated that in the years just before 1840 about 700 clergymen of the
Church of England were taking part in the awakening movement.
In the United States and Canada came a parallel movement, in which were
represented Christians of all the churches. Among prominent leaders in the pub-
lishing and evangelistic work of this second advent evangelism were William Miller,
a Baptist layman, of Low Hampton, N. Y., and Joshua V. Himes, a clergyman, of
Boston. Monthly and weekly papers devoted to this work were issued in Boston,
New York, and many other parts.
It was from among the Adventists engaged in this movement in America that
there arose a small group in 1844, in Washington, N.H., who began to observe the
seventh-day Sabbath, as they found it enjoined in the fourth commandment of the
Decalogue. Thus came the first Seventh-day Adventists, though the name was
not formally adopted until later years.
Prominent among those who })ioneered the work were Joseph Bates, James
White, his wife, Mrs. Ellen G. White, Hiram Edson, Frederick Wheeler, and
S. W. Rhodes. Later came J. H. Waggoner, J . N. Loughborough, J. N. Andrews
(who was the first Seventh-day Adventist missionary to be sent overseas from the
United States), Uriah Smith, and S. N. Haskell.
By 1860 the movement had grown until, in connection with the organization
of the first publishing house in Battle Creek, Mich., the denominational name
was assumed. The following year saw the beginning of the organization of
State conferences of churches, and in 1863 the General Conference was organized,
with John Byington as its first president. In order to decentralize and distribute
administrative responsibility, local State conferences are grouped in fairly large
areas as a union conference, with a union corps of officers. The union conferences
in continental areas are grouped again as divisions-as North American, South
American, southern Asia, Australasian, etc., covering all continents-each
division having its staff of officers. There are 12 divisions. Representatives
from each division make up the General Conference committee, with headquarters
in Washington D. C. For about half a century the headquarters had been at
Battle Creek, Mich., where the first equipped publishing house was built, also
their first medical sanitarium (with which grew up the early health food pro-
motion), and their first college. In 1903, however, the general offices were re-
moved to Washington.
DOCTRINE
Very briefly stated, the main features of Seventh-day Adventist teaching are
as follows:
1. Holy Scripture the rule of faith and practice. (2 Tim. 3 :15-17.)
2. The Godhead, or Trinity, com.ists of the Eternal Father, the Son of the
Eternal Father through whom all things were created, the Holy Spirit, the third
person of the Godhead, the great regenerating power in the work of redemption.
(Matt. 28: 19.)
3. Jesus Christ is very God. While retaining His divine nature He took upon
Himself the nature of the human family, died for our sins, rose from the dead,
and in heaven ever lives to make intercession for us. (John 1:1, 14; Heb. 2:9-18;
8:1, 2; 7:25.)
t Thisstatement, which dlflers somewhat from that published In vol. II ofthe Report on Religious Bodles,
1926, has been revised by a committee named for the purpose, and presented In Its present form by H. E.
Rogers, statistical secretary, General Conference of seventh-day Adventists, Takoma Park, Washington,
D.C.
DigitiZed by GoogIe
28 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
4. The new birth, through faith, by the recreative power of God. (John
3:3, 16.)
5. Baptism of believers, by immersion. (Mark 16: 16; Rom. 6: 1-6.)
6. The ten commandments, the moral law of God, the standard of the judgment.
(Ex. 20:1-17; Matt. 5:17-19; Eccl. 12: 13, 14.)
7. The fourth commandment of God's law enjoins the observance of the
seventh day ss the Sabbath of the Lord our God, made holy for all mankind.
(Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20 :8-11; Mark 2:27, 28.)
8. "Sin is the transgressfon of the law." (1 John 3 :4.) "The wages of sin is
death." (Rom. 6 :23.) Having sinned, man cannot save himseU, nor can the
law justify him. God so loved the world that He gave His Son, even Jesus Christ,
to diE' in man's stead; acceptJng Chr!st by faith, as his substitute, the sinner is
justified by the Saviour's grace, who cleanses from ein, creates the ne:w heart,
and abides within by His Spirit, to work obedience. Thus the gospel becomes
"the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." (Rom. 1: 16.)
9. Man is by nature mortal. God "only hath immortality." (1 Tim. 6: 16.)
Immortality and eternal life come to redeemed man only as the free gift in ChriBt;
and "this mortal shall put on immortality" at the second coming of Christ.
(1 Cor. 15:51-55.)
10. The condition of man in death is that of unconscious Fleep. All men, good
and evil alike, in death remain in the grave until the resurrection. (Eccl. 9 :5, 6;
Ps. 146:3, 4; John 5:28, 29.)
11. The resurrection of the just takes place at the second advent of Christ
(1 Thess. 4: 13-18), that of the unjust, a thousand years later, at the close of the
millennium. (Rev. 20:5-10.)
12. The impenitent, including Satan, the author of sin, are destroyed, brought
to a state of nonexistence. (Rom. 6: 23; Mal. 4: 1-3; Rev. 20: 9, 10; Obadiah 16.)
13. The Christian is to live and act and eat and drink to the glory of God,
recognizing his body as the temple of the Holy Spirit. Thus the believer will
clothe the body in neat, modest, dignified apparel, and will be led to abstain from
all intoxicating drinks, tobacco, and other narcotics. (1 Cor. 3: 16, 17; 9: 25;
10: 31; 1 Tim. 2: 9, 10; 1 John 2: 6.)
14. Gospel work is to be supported by the Scripture plan of tithes and offerings.
(Lev. 27: 30; Mal. 3: 8-12; Matt. 23: 23; 1 Cor. 9: 9--14; 2 Cor. 9: 6-15.)
l.'i. Seventh-day Adventists believe that the Bible and the Bible alone is the
authority for all faith and doctrine, and the standard by which all religious teaching
is to be judged. Believing also in the impartation of the Holy Spirit to the church
for all time, they accept the Scriptural tearhing regarding the manifestation of
spiritual gifts as a means by which the church is edified and built up-the gifts of
apostleship, prophecy, teaching, evangelism, etc. (1 Cor. 12: 28-30; Eph. 4:
11-14.) As the gift of prophecy is among these gifts listed, they accept the admoni-
tion of Paul, "Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which
is good." From the beginning of the movement they have had constant and
cumulative evidence that through the counsels and writings of Ellen G. White,
the Holy Spirit has given special help to the church. The counsel and instruction
thus received, has been a potent factor in the maintenance of unity of doctrine and
of organization for world-wide service.
16. The second coming of Christ is the hope of the church, the climax of the
plan of salvation, spoken of by all the prophets "since the world began." (Acts
3: 19-21.) While no man knows the day and the hour, Christ and all prophecy
have foretold signs by which it may be known when it "is near, even at the doors."
The gospel message in these times, it is believed, must call attention to the signs
of the times and to the message of preparation to meet the Lord. The closing
ministry of Jesus in heaven, before He comes, is a work of judgment, which will
determine between the just and the unjust. (Dan. 7: 9, 10.) When that judg-
ment begins in the heavenly temple, the gospel message is due to the world; "The
hour of His judgment is come." (Rev. 14: 6, 7.) Seventh-day Adventists
believe it is their work to carry that message to every people and tongue.
17. The order of events of the second advent are understood to be as follows:
The voice of Christ calls forth the just of all the ages from their graves, the living
righteous being translated. All ascend with Jesus to heaven. The glory of His
coming has consumed the unjust. The earth is desolated, uninhabited by men
for a thousand years, the prison house of Satan. (1 Thess. 4: 16, 17; 1: 7-9;
Rev. 20: 1-3, 5.)
18. The millennia! reign of Christ covers the period between the first and
second resurrection, during which the saved live with Him in heaven. At the end
of the thousand years, the Holy City, with Christ and the saved, descend to earth,
DigitiZed by GoogIe
SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST DENOl\:IINATION 29
the wicked are raised in the second resurrection; led by Satan they come up ·
against the Lord and the city. Final judgment is pronounced upon them, and
fire consumes them utterly. Death itself is destroyed, and the grave. Satan is
no more. All traces of sin are removed by the purifying fires, and the earth comes
forth, recreated, restored to the_purity and beauty of the original Eden. "The
meek shall inherit the .
earth." It becomes the eternal home of the redeemed of
Adam's race. (Rev. 20: 7-15; 21: 1-5.) There is then no sin or pain in all the
universe, and every creature gives praise to God. (Rev. 5: 13.)
ORGANIZATION
The local church.-The local church is congregational in its government, although
under the general supervision of the conference of which it i.s a member. One
or more elder!l-generally laymen-are elected annually to care for the spiritual
interests of the church, conduct services, and, in the absence of an ordained
minister, to administer the sacraments. One or more deacons and deaconesses
are also elected annually to care for the financial and administrative work. In
the case of large congregations, particularly in cities, ordained ministers are
sometimes appointed by the conference as pastors, but usually they act as evange-
lists, having supervision of a number of local churches, and directing their chief
effort to evangelistic work in the development of new churches.
Local, union, and General Conference.-A number of churches are united to
form a conference or mission. The conference meets biennially and is composed
of delegates elected by the churches. The conference has general supervision
of the churches and their work. In some large States there are two or more of
these conferences, and as a matter of convenience the term "local conference"
has come into use. The local conferences or missions are united into groups to
form union conferences, which hold sessions quadrennially, and to which delegates
are elected by the local conferences. The union conferences and union missions
throughout the world are united in the General Conference, which holds quadren-
nial sessions composed of delegates from union conferences and union missions
throughout the world. For convenience in administering the work of the General
Conference, the world field is divided into 12 divisions, each with its staff of
division officers, presided over by a vice president of the General Conference.
Executive committees.-Each local conference and local mission has an executive
committee for the conduct of its work, composed of its officers and other elected
or appointed members. The union conference president, secretary, and treasurer,
together with the presidents of the local conferences and superintendents of
local missions and other elected members, compose the executive committee of
the union conference. The president, secretary, and treasurer, the field secre-
taries of the division, the presidents of union conferences, and superintendents
of union missions, with division departmental secretaries, and other appointed
members, constitute the executive committee of the division. The president of
the General Conference, and other officers of the General Conference and the
divisions, the field secretaries, together with General Conference and division
departmental secretaries, the union conference presidents and superintendents of
union missions, and other elected members, constitute the General Conference
executive committee.
WORK
Membership and work.-Applicants for church membership appear before the
pastor or officers of the local church for examination. If approved, they are
recommended for baptism and church membership.
Candidates for the gospel ministry are licensed to preach, for a limited term,
by a conference, either local, union, or general. At the expiration of that term,
on approval by the conference, they are recommended for ordination.
LOcal church expenses are met by special contributions, and collections are
made during the year for the different departments of denominational work.
An effort is also being made to collect a sum amounting to 40 cents per week per
member for foreign mission work. The support of the ministry is provided by
the tithing system, each church member being expected to contribute a tenth of
his net income for this purpose. The tithes are paid through a church treasurer
to the treasurer of the local conference. The conference supervises the work of
ministers and pays the salaries. Associations for the holding of property belong-
ing to the denomination have been formed in nearly every country in which work
is carried on. The jurisdiction of these associations is coextensive with that of a
conference, local, or union, and their officers are the officers of the conference,
DigitiZed by GoogIe
30 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
while their constituencies consist of the delegates to the sessions of the conference.
The associations connected with local conferences hold in trust all the property
for the local churches, while associations formed for union conferences hold prop-
erty of a more general character.
In aU the world.-Believing in the command of our Saviour, as expressed in
Matthew 28: 19-"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations"-Seventh-day Ad-
ventists have literally gone forth into all the world, carrying the gospel message
to all lands.
At the close of 1936, Seventh-day Adventists were conducting work in 378
countries, islands, and island groups, by 26,553 evangelistic and institutional
laborers, who are using in their work 649 languages and dialects. This was an
increase of 71 languages during 1936, or practically 1 new language added every
5 days during that year. Since 1926, 393 languages have been added, or 1 new
language added on an average of a little less than 10 days.
The membership of the 8,243 churches of the denomination throughout the
world at the close of 1936 was 438,139. In the United States there were 153,125
while outside there were 285,014. There are 70 union conferences, 143 local
conferences, 328 missions, with 12,589 evangelistic laborers. The first missionary
was sent outside the United States in 1874. Since that time there have been
about 5,000 missionaries sent to labor outside this country.
Educational.-In 1872, the first denominational missionary training school was
opened in Battle Creek, Mich. At the close of 1936 there was in operation a
graded system of education, requiring 16 years' work for completion, and includ-
ing, in all countries, 33 literary and theological colleges and junior colleges, 1
medical college, 187 ac~demies and intermediate schools, and 2,514 primary
schools. All these schools had 5,715 teachers. The enrollment of the 2,514
primar;r_schools was 83,605, and of the advanced schools, 29,227, a total of 112,832.
In the United States the enrollment was 33,849. The earnings and contributions
received by all the schools throughout the world for 1936 were $7,081,983. The
schools in the United States received $5,307,296.
Health promotion.-In 1866 a sanitarium was erected in Battle Creek, Mich.,
for the rational treatment of disease and the dissemination of the principles of
temperance and healthful living. At the close of 1936 there were 95 well-equipped
sanitariums, and 68 hydropathic treatment rooms, throughout the world, in
addition to a number of dispensaries and about 50 medical institutions under
private management that are recognized as following the denominational prin-
ciples. All these institutions treated 625,083 patients during 1936. Physicians,
nurses, and other employees number 5,995.
Publishing.-The first really equipped denominational publishing house was
erected in Battle Creek, Mich., in 1855. At the close of 1936 there were 17
publishing houses and branches in the United States, and 56 in other countries,
a total of 73 publishing houses and branches, engaged exclusively in the pro-
duction and sale of denominational literature. These houses issue 282 periodicals,
in 194 languages, have 1,154 employees engaged in production of literature, and
3,383 colporteurs employed in its distribution. Literature sales in 1936 amounted
to $3,622,299. The total value of book and periodical sales from 1863 to the close
of 1936 was $109,948,167.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
In the year 1863 there were many people in various parts of the United States
who held to the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath and were looking for the
soon return of Christ, but who either had never been connected with the Seventh-
day Adventists, or who had rejected the inspiration of the so-called "visions" of
Mrs. E. G. White. These people were scattered and unorganized. In the
summer of 1863 a number of t-hem associated together and began the publication
of a monthly paper, named "The Hope of Israel." The first issue was dated
August 10, 1863, and was issued from Hartford, Mich. Enos Easton was editor
and Samuel Davison and Gilbert Cranmer were leaders of the work. Some of
those supporting the paper were loosely organized under the name "Church of
Christ" while others held to the n,ame "Church of God." But they were united
in faith in the soon coming of Christ and a number of other doctrines, and also
were opposed to accepting the "visions" of Mrs. E. G. White.
The paper was soon movetl to Waverly, Mich., where publication continued
until October 1865, when it was forced to discontinue for lack of financial support.
In the month of May 1866, "The Hope of Israel" was revived, being issued at
Marion, Iowa, by an association of some of the original group, and others who
had joined with them, under the name "Christian Publishing · Association."
The movement had received fresh impetus through two prominent Adventist
ministers, who had refused to accept the inspiration of Mrs. E. G. White, joining
with them. These were B. F. Snook and W. H. Brinkerhoff, who with W. E.
Carver, were the leaders of the revived work. Later Jacob Brinkerhoff became
one of the principal leaders. The name "Church of God" was then in general
use by these brethren and soon was adop~d as a distinctive name. The ministers
were practically all evangelists, and local churche-s were established throughout
the country.
The history of the church is closely connected with the history of the publica-
tion which continued to be published in Marion, Iowa, until the year 1889, when
it was moved to Stanberry, Mo, The name of the paper was changed several
times, and it is now known as "The Bible Advocate and Herald of the Coming
Kingdom."
Some of the churches formed remained independent from the general organiza-
tion, although holding the same beliefs. In 1906 these were registered as a
separ~e body under the title of Churches of God (Adventist) Unattached Con-
gregations. Many such independent groups still exist.
DOCTRINE
The Church of God (Adventist) has no formal written creed but believes in
constantly growing in the knowledge of the Bible, which it accepts as the sole rule
of faith and practice. Among the doctrines upon which the church as a whole
stands united are: (1) The observance of the seventh day of the week as the
Sabbath. (2) The literal and premillennial second coming of Christ, and that
present-day events indicate that this will take place soon. (3) The unconscious
state of the dead. (4) The resurrection of the righteous dead at the second
advent of Christ and their reign with Christ on the earth during 1,000 years of
restitution. (5) The complete destruction of the wicked at the end of the 1,000
years. (6) The eternal reward of the righteous on the earth, made new.
(7) That Christ was crucified on Wednesday and arose near sundown Saturday.
(8) That the Lord's Supper service was instituted by Christ to take the place of
the ancient Passover, and should be observed annually, at the time of the Passover.
(9) That the Ten Commandment law is recognized in Scripture as distinct from
the Law of Moses. (10} That sin is the transgression of the Ten Commandment
law. (11) That acceptance of Christ is followed by repentance,'baptism by im-
mersion in water, and the reception of the Holy Spirit, followed byirighteous living.
1 This statement, which di1Jers somewhat from that published In vol. II of the Report on Rellp:lous
Bodies, 1926, was furnished by Roy Davison, president, General Conference of the Church or God, Stan·
berry, Mo., and approved by him In Its present form.

CHURCH OF GOD (ADVENTIST) 37
ORGANIZATION
In polity the denomination is essentially congregational. This is modified
somewhat by the fact that a large proportion of the membership is composed of
isolated members. Where there are enough members in a State, they are organized
into a local conference. At this writing there are nine such conference organiza-
tions, some of which include several States. Each local conference has an executive
board which directs the evangelistic work in its territory. Of the tithes received,
one-tenth is sent for the work of the General Conference, which includes all the local
conferences and all unorganized territory.
Candidates for the ministry first are issued licenses on recommendation of a
church or conference. After having gained experience and proven their calling,
they may be ordained into the ministry by prayer and the laying on of hands in a
public service, by other ordained ministers of the church. Ministers are referred
to by the title "elder," no other religious titles indicating office being used.
WORK
The organized conferences employ evangelists who work for the spreading of the
gospel and the building up of the church in their territories. Work in unorganized
territory is conducted by the General Conference, with funds given or allotted for
that purpose.
The church maintains one publishing house from which is issued many books
and tracts. Besides the general church paper, "The Bible Advocate," there are
also issued, "The Sabbath School Missionary and Young People's Friend," a
biweekly for children and young people; "The Field Messenger," a monthly
church news magazine; and "The Sabbath School Quarterly," a quarterly booklet
of Bible lessons. The printing plant is known as "The Church of God Publishing
House," and is located at Stanberry, Mo.

LIFE AND ADVENT UNION
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
41
The doctrine that there will be no resurrection of the wicked was preached in
1848 by John T. Walsh, then an associate editor of the Bible Examiner, an
Adventist periodical published in New York City. A considerable number of
Adventists joined him and in 1863 the Life and Advent Union was organized in
Wilbraham, Mass., and the Herald of Life was founded as the denominational
organ, with George Storrs as its first editor. The number of churches has not
been large, but a number of people hold the views of the Union who are not
enrolled in its organized churches. Of these it is impossible to give any estimate.
DOCTRINE
In matters of doctrine they are in accord with the earlier Adventists except in
regard to the resurrection and the millennium. They hold that the righteous
dead only will be raised and that eternal life is bestowed solely at the second
coming of Christ; that the millennium, the one thousand years of Revelation xx,
had its fulfillment in the past and, instead of being a time of peace and happiness,
was a period of religious persecution and suffering; that this earth, purified by
fire and renewed in beauty, will be the eternal inheritance and dwelling place of
God's people, in which the wicked dead will have no share at all, their sleep being
eternal. They believe that omens of the near approach of Christ are to be ·dis-
cerned in the widespread weakening of faith in an inspired Bible, the general
condition of unrest and perplexity among the nations, and kindred developments
along many lines.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the Life and Advent Union is distinctly congregational; associations
are for fellowship and have no ecclesiastical authority. Home and foreign mis-
sionary work and the publication of the Herald of Life are under the control of
the Governing Council, consisting of two delegates from each member organiza-
tion, and an Executive Board, elected annually by the Governing Council. Min-
isters are ordained, either at their own request or on request of a church, and after
proper examination by a committee appointed for the purpose.
The control of the spiritual interests of the Life and Advent Union is vested in
a Ministerial Board consisting of five members, elected annually during the an-
nual meeting of the Life and Advent Camp Meeting Association, by the ordained
ministers of the Life and Advent Union in good and regular standing, from
among their members.
WORK
The activities of the Life and Advent Union consist of maintaining mission
work in China and aiding weak churches in this country. The headquarters of
the China work are in Ho-Hsien, Anhwei, the work being carried on by native
pastors and teachers under the supervision of an American missionary. The
amount spent for mission work in 1936 was approximately $6,000.
Two camp meetings are held annually--.:...one in Maine and one in Connecticut
(which is the :principal one). The official publication of the denomination is
the Herald of Life, issued biweekly at New Britain, Conn. This paper has a
circulation in the United States and in several foreign countries.
• This statement, which is substantially the same as that published In vol. II or the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revl!!ed by H. L. Babcock, editor emeritus or the Herald of LICe, New Britain, Conn.,
and approved by him In Its present form.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
With the development of church life independent of denominational organiza-
tions, many churches throughout the country were organized under various
names, such as Church of the Blessed Hope, Bl'E'thren of the Abrahamic Faith,
Restitutionists, Restitution Church, Church of God, and Age to Come Adventists.
Some were loosely affiliated but refused to be identified with any denomination,
although, in general, they were Adventist in their doctrine. In November 1888
representatives from a number of such churches met in Philadelphia and organ-
ized the association known as Churches of God in Christ Jesus, which is in
general accord with the Adventist bodies and is classed with them, although
the term "Adventist" does not appear in its title.
In August 1921 a General Conference was organized at Waterloo, Iowa.
Headquarters were located at Oregon, Ill., at which place are maintained the
general offices.
DOCTRINE
The churches belonging to this association have no creed but the Bible. The
members, however, believe:
1. That there is one God, the supreme creator and controller of all things, who
is a lovable, loving, and approachable Father, and a rewarder of all who diligently
seek Him and keep His commandments.
2. That the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into existence as set
forth in the Gospels and gave His life as a sacrificial offering for· our sins; that
those who believe in Him and obey His teachings may through Him have their
sins forgiven; that Christ arose from the dead on the third day and, after meet-
ing with His disciples on several occasions, was taken up into heaven, there to
remain with God until certain things foretold by. the prophets shall have been
accomplished.
I This statement which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II or the Report on Religions
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Sydney E . Magaw, secretary and editor, National Bible Institution,
Oregon, ru., and approved by him In Its present form.
DigitiZed by GoogIe
OHURCH OF GOD (OREGON, ILL.) 47
3. That Christ will come again personally (a) to give immortal life to those
who have been faithful, raising the dead and changing the living; (b) to establish
the kingdom of God on earth, which, with its capital city at Jerusalem, will be
gradually extended until all nations and races of mankind are brought under
His sovereignty; and to restore to its ancient heritage and God's favor the
Israelitish nation, which will then be the most favored nation in this kingdom;
(c) to reward the immortal saints as joint heirs with Christ, according to their
works, giving to each a position of honor and trust as joint ruler with Christ in
the kingdom of God; (d) to mete out to the ungodly "the wages of sin," even the
second death.
4. That obedience to the commandments of God is obligatory upon all
Christians, the first act necessary being baptism for the remission of sins.
5. That those who believe the gospel message, repent of their sins, and are
baptized, have entered into covenant relationship with God, their part of the
covenant being that they will live useful lives of faith and good works, God's
.part being that if they remain faithful unto the end He will give them eternal
life and positions of honor and trust in His kingdom.
Candidates for admission into the churches are required to confess faith in
God and in the promises of the gospel; to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord,
Saviour, and King; and to covenant to live Christian lives. On this confession
candidates are baptized by immersion.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the churches are congregational. For fellowship and general work
they gather in State and district conferences, which, however, exercise no authority
over the individual churches, being wholly advisory, educational, and evangelistic
in character. Each local church adapts its organization to circumstances. In
some cases they have pastors, in others the services are conducted by elders
or presidents. The term "minister," as understood among them, is applied to the
person in spiritual charge of the congregation, or who preaches the gospel. There
is no formal method of ordination. Ministers are authorized by the several
State conferences, who, on application, are, after confirmation as to character,
recognized by the General Conference. The general attitude toward other
denominations is liberal, the invitation to the communion service being extended
to all Christians, leaving each individual to be his own judge as to participation.
WORK
The home mission work of the churches is conducted by a number of evangelists,
who are supported by voluntary contributions. A Bible Training School is
maintained at Oregon, Ill., for those who wish to qualify for the ministry or for
other active church work. In addition to this, literature, quarterly and annual
gatherings, and Bible classes in various centers are used as mediums for educa-
tional work. There is a young people's society, called the Bereans, which has a
national organization, with affiliated State organizations and local eocieties.
There are about 25 of these local societies with about 500 members. Sunday
schools, ladies' aid societies, and similar educational and charitable institutions
are also conducted as a part of the general work of the churches.
In the Golden Rule Home, at Oregon, Ill., provision is made to care for aged
persons and others who may need such care.
Denominational printing is done by the National Bible Institution, Oregon, Ill.

InSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The African Orthodox Church came into existence in 1921, after a preliminary
period of preparation. The Reverend Dr. George Alexander McGuire, for many
years a priest in the Protestant Episcopal Church, believing that Negro Epis-
copalians should conduct and control their own religious organization, as their
Methodist and Baptist brethren have done for over a century, withdrew from the
Anglican commumon in 1919 and established a number of congregations in the
United State!!! Canada, and Cuba, which he designated "Independent Epis-
copal." On !:jeptember 2, 1921, the first General Synod was convened in the
city of New York for the purpose of organizing a branch of the Holy Catholic
Church which should be governed by {Klrsons of African descent and should gather
in churchmen of this particular race m both hemispheres, yet not refuse persons
of other racial groups who might voluntarily seek to enter its membership or
receive its sacraments. At this synod the name "African Orthodox" was
chosen as the distinctive title of the new church, and the organizer, the Rev-
erend Dr. McGuire, was unanimously elected as its first bishop, receiving the
consecration 3 weeks later from Archbishop Vilatte, whose episcopate had been

the patriarch, Peter Ignatius III. Thus the African Orthodox Church derived
its apostolic succession and became episcopal in government and polity; and
while it is autonomous and independent, it aspires to be recognized as an integral
portion of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.
DOCTRINE
The African Orthodox Church accepts the Holy Scriptures, as well as the
Holy Tradition, as the source of divme truth; it accepts the Nicene Creed,
without the "filioque" interpolation, as of obligation, but believes also in the
symbols known as the Apostles' Creed and the Creed of St. Athanasius. It
accepts the dogmatic decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Councils held between the
fourth and the eighth centuries. It receives as a portion of the original deposit
of faith the Seven Sacraments. It holds that the Eucharist is both a sacrament
and a sacrifice offered for the living and the dead. Marriage being one of the
sacraments, it holds that there should be no dissolution of its bonds except for
the cause of adultery or malicious desertion, and no priest may marry a divorced
person unless he or she be the innocent party in a divorce granted by. a proper
court for the causes mentioned, and then only by permission of his bishop in
each such case of remarriage.
The denomination has set forth its own sacred liturgy, with other rites and
ceremonies. Generally speaking, it follows the Western rite and is a combina-
tion of Anglican, Roman, and, in a few instances, Greek Orthodox formularies,
prepared with the special purpose of making an appeal to Negro Episcopalians
and Roman Catholics. The mass is the chief service each Sunday, and in the
bestowing of holy orders the Roman forms of ordination and consecration are
followed. The vestments used in worship are those prescribed by the Western
rite and the hymnal that which is known as Hymns Ancient and Modern.
Membership is counted as in the Roman Catholic Church, not by communi-
cants, but by the persons baptized.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the African Orthodox Church conforms to that of all churches
which regard the episcopacy as the central source of authority in matters spiritual
and temporal. The bishop is the head of his diocese or jurisdiction, functioning
also as president of his diocesan synod. Groups of dioceses form a province,
over each of which there is an archbishop and primate, .who presides over the
provincial synod. At the head of the entire church, including all provinces, is
the patriarch, who presides over the Pan-African Conclave of Archbishops and
Bishops and is the acknowledged ruler of the African Orthodox Church of the
world. At .present there is an American province extending through Canada,
the United States, and Latin America; and an African province extending through
the Union of South Africa, each with its own archbishop and primate.

The Ethical Movement was inaugurated by the founding of the New York
Society for Ethical Culture by Dr. Felix Adler in 1876. Ethical societies have
since been formed in Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Brooklyn, Boston, and
Westchester, and the movement has extended also to other countries, including
England, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Japan. Two federations
have been formed-the American Ethical Union, organized in 1886, and the
International Ethical Union, organized in 1896.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The Ethical Movement is linked with man's religious tradition and with the
insights and wisdom of philosophy. With reverence for the best in traditional
faiths it attempts to reinterpret ethical teachings so as to deepen man's spiritual

life today. "Ethical" is to be interpreted as that aspect of self which is sensitive
to and creative in human relationships. In its broadest and deepest sense it is
an emphasis on the fulfillment of man's possibilities. It calls for the development
of man's aesthetic and scientific powers, but above all it stresses the values to be
fulfilled through better human relationships. It is the purpose of the Ethical
Movement to make men more aware of the intrinsic worth of human personality,
of the uniqueness of every human being, of the interpenetration of one life with
another, and of the possibilities of creative relationships among men. Through
developing conscience and the sense of responsibility for better relations in friend-
ship, in family, in industry, and among different nations and cultures, the Ethical
Movement fulfills man's need for a sense of purpose, direction, and meaning.
This is the purpose of the plan of ethical education which begins with the Sunday
school and continues through youth and adulthood to old age.
The societies have no formal expression of doctrine. Their purpose, as
expressed by the constitution of the American Ethical Union, is "to assert the
supreme importance of the ethical factor in all the relations of life." The further-
ance of personal and social relationships which will promote man's ethical possi-
bilities takes the place of formal creeds; this very striving for moral life becomes
itself a "consecrating influence."
While there are no fixed rites or ceremonies, the Sunday meetings of the Society
are regarded by most of the members as religious meetings. Music, readings,
and addresses by leaders of the Society constitute an inspirational service. The
leaders, who take the place of ministers, officiate at the funerals of members of the
societies, offer counsel in moral difficulty, name children, and perform marriage
ceremonies under the laws of the States, and in the case of New York City and
Brooklyn by special act of the legislature.
The American Ethical Union, composed of the seven American societies listed,
holds an annual assembly to which the several societies send delegates in propor-
tion to their numbers. In the interval between assemblies the business of the
Union is conducted by an executive committee. However, each society is
autonomous in government.
WORK
In each of the Ethical societies there are Sunday schools for the moral instruc-
tion of children, and study and fellowship groups for young people and adults.
Effort is made to develop a sense of the fellowship and community of the members
in one another.
Each of the societies has undertaken and carries on a variety of activities-
educational, philanthropic, and social-emphasizing the ethical needs and possi-
bilities of man. These include neighborhood houses for work in neglected areas,
The New York Society is to be credited with the inception of settlement house
work in this country. Neighborhood houses initiated by the societies are in
operation in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. Free kinder-
~rtens in the New York schools, the visiting nurse movement (also started by the
Henry Street Settlement), the Child Study Movement, and the movement for the
abolition of child labor were also introduced by the Society. Some of the first
model tenements, the impulse to the first tenement house law in New York City,
and much of recent activity on behalf of housing has been stimulated by members
of the New York Society. The Chicago Society started the first public legal aid
bureau and led to the spread of this kind of institution.
The Society has also established the Ethical Culture schools for advanced
experimental work in elementary and high school education. The most recent
development of the Ethical Culture school system is the Fieldston School at
Riverdale, New York City. This undertaking is an attempt to help growing
youth through a new approach to preprofessional and high school education.
The Ethical Culture schools rank among the foremost as laboratories in education.
Systematic ethical instruction is a special feature of the schools. No attempt is
made, however, in the schools or other institutions connected with the societies
to proselytize for the Ethical Movement. The cultural and educational activities
are open to all who wish to take part, irrespective of religious views or affiliations.

lllSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
About the year 1880, Thomas E. Moore was put in charge of the American work
of the Salvation Army by Gen. William E. Booth, whose headquarters were in
London. After a few years a difference of opinion arose between the two in regard
to the financial administration of the American branch. General Booth con-
tended that a part of all funds raised in America should be sent to England and
that, as the work of the Salvation Army was world-wide, a member of that army
should not call any country his own. Mr. Moore contended that funds raised
by the Salvation Army in America should be used only in this country and that
the organization should have an American charter.
In 1882, with a number of the American officers, he withdrew and began inde-
pendent work. The movement was incorporated in 1884, and in 1885 an amended
charter was granted under the name of the Salvation Army of America. Mr.
Moore was made head of the new organization with the title of general, but
subsequently withdrew to enter the Baptist ministry and was succeeded by
Col. Richard Holz. Headquarters were first established at Mohawk, N. Y.,
but were afterwards changed to Saratoga Springs. Subsequent changes in the
Salvation Army in the United States and certain overtures made by the new
commander, Gen. Ballington Booth, to General Holz and other officers of the
new organization resulted in the return of a considerable number to the former
organization. However, about 25 posts refused to return and these united and
reorganized; in 1913 the name of the organization was changed to American
Rescue Workers, under which name it has been incorporated under the laws of
the State of Pennsylvania; and later incorporated also in the States of New York,
Ohio, California, and New Jersey.
DOCTRINE
In general doctrine and organization this body is very similar to the older one,
except that, besides being an evangelistic and philanthropic movement, it is a
Christian church with the usual sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper,
acknowledging belief in one God, in the Trinity, the inspiration of the Scriptures,
the divinity of Christ, the doctrines of original sin and of the atonement, repent-
ance, and regeneration as prerequisites to salvation, the inward witness of the
Holy Ghost and the eternal punishment of the wicked and the eternal reward
of the righteous.
t This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, bas been revised by Oen.Iames W. Duffin, commander in chief of the American Rescue
Workers, Philadelphia, Pa., and approved by him In Its present form.

AMERICAN RESCUE WORKERS 59
ORGANIZATION
The organization is represented in its corporate capacity by a board of directors,
the majority of whom are laymen and all of whom are elected by the duly quali-
fied voters of the corporation. These directors are all members of the general
council of the American Rescue Workers, which includes also the commander,
the staff officers, the field officers, and representatives of the corps.
Titles to property are not vested in the general council, but stations having
real estate may have their own local boards of directors. Should a station cease
to exist, however, the gener:al board is legally qualified to become the custodian
of all such property for American ReScue purposes.
WORK
The organization has two main objects, the dissemination of the Word of God
to the masses not reached by ordinary church methods, and the assistance of the
unfort,mate; as its name indicates, the organization does a general philanthropic
work, ·depending for its support on voluntary contributions.

Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classiftcation.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Apostolic Overcoming Holy Church of God
for the year 1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
This denomination, reported for the first time in 1926, was incorporated in
1916 under the laws of the State of Alabama as the Ethiopian Overcoming Holy
Church of God. At the annual meeting in June 1927, by a majority vote, the
word "Apostolic" was substituted for "Ethiopian," and the denomination has
since been called Apostolic Overcoming Holy Church of God.
The churches are nearly all in three States of the South, but there is one organ-
ization in Illinois. The headquarters of the denomination are in Mobile, Ala.
The National Convention, which meets annually, is divided into districts
called ministerial councils. The presiding officer of the general body is a bishop,
and the church has also elders and teachers. Its general purpose is evangelistic,
supported by the payment of tithes from all the members.
• No revision orthe history, doct:rlneJlr organization was Curnlshed by this body Cor 1936, hence thisstate-
mentIs the same as that published In .ttellglous Bodies, vol. II, 1926.

ASSEMBLIES OF GOD, GENERAL OOUNCIL
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
71
Following a great revival movement which swept around the world in 1906 and
1907, a considerable number of churches, missions, or assemblies in the United
States found a common interest in a distinctively evangelistic type of mission
work. This was at first purely independent and voluntary, but some association
and mutual fellowship became recognized as valuable and necessary for the
purpose of establishing doctrinal standards and providing effective methods of
home and foreign missionary work.
In the spring of the year 1914, a group of pastors of indepen,dent churches issued
a call for all interested in Bible order, system, evangelism, and united doctrine to
meet at Hot Springs, Ark. About 100 delegates came to this meeting. Some
were former ministers of evangelical denominational churches and others were
serving as pastors of churches, not having had previous denominational member-
ship. An organization was agreed upon based on the principles of voluntary
unity and cooperation in religious effort. This organization was fir8:t incorporated
in Arkansas in October 1914, and then in Missouri in November 1916, under the
name of "The General Council of the Assemblies of God."
DOCTRINE
The doctrine of the Assemblies of God tends mostly toward Arminian princi-
ples, emphasizing the inspiration of the Scriptures; the fall and redemption of
man; the baptism in the Holy Ghost accompanied by the speaking in other
tongues; sanctification as the goal for all believers; the church a living organism;
a divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry; divine healing; the pre- ·
millennia! and imminent coming of Jesus to judge the world in righteousness,
while reigning on earth for a thousand vears; everla..c;ting _punishment for the
wicked, and a new heaven and a new earth for the believers. While thev recognize
human government and affirm unswerving loyalty to the United States, the
Assemblies of God claim that as followers of the Prince of Peace they are con-
strained to declare that they could not conscientiously participate in war and
armed resistance which involves the actual destruction of human life.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the denomination is a combination of the Congregational and
Presbyterian systems. The local churches are Congregational in the conduct of
their affairs, and their sovereignty in this respect is fully recognized by the Gen-
eral Council constitution. They act, however, under the advice and suggestions
of the district and general presbyters.
The work of the denomination in the United States has been divided into 35
districts, largely following State border lines. These districts are officered by a
district presbytery, chosen by the membership of each district and entrusted with
the examination, licensing, and ordination of ministers. The extension of the
fellowship through home mission effort is also entrusted to the district councils.
All ordained ministers are members of the General Council, which meets
biennially. At this council, general officers are chosen, doctrinal standards are
established, and ways and means adopted for church extension. Departmental
heads are also chosen, who serve in the capacity of executive presbyters. A
~neral presbytery serves in an advisory capacity to the executive presbytery.
The membership in the general presbytery is composed of three members from
each district council, elected by the districts to this office. The general officers
are superintendent, assistant superintendent, secretary, treasurer home missions
secretary, foreign missions secretary, principal of Bible Training ~hool, editor of
publications, etc.
t This statement, which Is substautlally the same as that published 1D vol. II of the Repcrt of Rellglons
Bodiee, 1926, has been revised by J. Roswell Flower, general secretary, General CooucU Assemblies of God,
Sprlugdeld, Mo., aud approved by him In Its present form.

WORK
The primary work of the Assemblies of God is evangelistic and missionary and
this work is pursued diligently through the home and foreign missions depart-
ments. Outgoing missionaries, whether ordained or not, must be endorsed by the
missionary committee of the General Council. All local churches are encouraged
to have a part in the missionary program and many local assemblies support
missionaries on the foreign field wholly or in part. Missionary funds go through
the central mi~<sionary committee but a considerable amount is sent by individ-
uals and churches directly to missionaries whom they support or help to support.
Annual missionary receipts and disbursements are running well over $350,000 per
year. All offerings for foreign work are sent to the field, 100 percent, without
any deduction whatever for home administration, the expense of the conduct of
the foreign missions department being met by free-will offerings and grants from
the general fund of the denomination.
Only one school is operated under the direct supervision of the General Council,
the Central Bible Institute at Springfield, Mo. This school has accommoda-
tions for about 500 students and offers a 3-year course for the training of ministers
and missionaries. Other schools are operating under district supervision at
Minneapolis, Minn., Seattle, Wash., San Francisco, Calif., Pasadena, Calif., Zion,
Ill., Green Lake, Pa., Enid, Okla., Fort Worth, Tex., Houston, Tex., and New
Brockton, Ala. The total enrollment is approximately 2,000, and the courses
are devoted exclusively to subjects pertaining to ministerial and missionary work.
There are some district publications, but the publishing work of the denomina-
tion has been centered largely in the Gospel Publishing House of Springfield, Mo..t
which is entrusted with the publication of the Pentecostal Evangel, publishea
weekly, the Sunday school literature and numerous books, pamphlets, and tracts.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
620 39. 2
The Assyrian Jacobite Apostolic Church traces its origin to the first 12 apostles
of Christ, particularly to St. Peter, the first Patriarch of Anti.och.
The gospel had its origin in Syria and the Assyrian fathers were the first Chris-
tian missionaries. From the beginning of Christianity, the Assyrians went out
to Gaul, Persia, India, China, and Africa, where, notwithstanding severe perse-
cutions, they succeeded in establishing numerous schools and monasteries. They
have been constantly persecuted by the various Roman, Greek, Persian, and
Turkish rulers, and, judging from the continuous numerous outrages it would
seem that the Turks and Arabs intended to exterminate all the Assyrian Christians.
In the face of all these persecutions they gallantly faced death, and to this day
the.x ably uphold the early Christian faith.
Contact with American missionaries who had established schools in various
localities turned the attention of the Assyrians to America, and they fled from the
rule of the Moslem Turk and sought shelter under the American flag. This im-
migration began about 1893, and soon there were several large Assyrian communi-
ties in the United States. Some of 1lhese people were members of the Assyrian
I No revlalon or history, doctrine, or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this statement
Is 81lb8tantlally the same as that published In vol. U or the Report on Religious Bodies, 1926.

ASSYRIAN JACOBITE APOSTOLIC CHURCH 75
Roman Catholic Church, others belonged to the Assyrian Protestant Church,
while still others belonged to the Assyrian Nestorian Church or the Chaldean
Church. On coming here, all except the Nestorians identified themselves with
their respective American denominations. The majority of them, however, were
members of the Assyrian Jacobite Apostolic faith, and as the number of immi-
grants continued to increase, church services for them were in great demand.
In April 1907, the Assyrian Americans sent Deacon Hanna Koorie, then of
Paterson, N. J., to Jerusalem. There he was ordained priest and later a koorie
(cvhoorie). He returned to the United States September 28 of the same year.
Immediately afterward, he assembled the dispersed Assyrians, for the first time,
to worship in St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Paterson, N.J. The members of this
faith are scattered in various States, but their churches were reported only from
two New England States, Ne'w Jersey, and Michigan.
DOCTRINE
The doctrine of this church is based on the Nicene Creed. It varies, however
from that of the Western Church as regards the procession of the Holy Ghost
and uses the ,phraseology, "the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father and is
with the Son.' It accepts the canons of the first three General Councils of the
church, namely, the Nicene, Constantinople, and Ephesus, as well as the writings
of the recognized fathers of the church of the period of these councils. It teaches
that Christ was perfect God and perfect man. The interpretation of the Bible,
the ecclesiastical ordinances, as well as the traditions of the church, are held
equally important. The seven sacraments, baptism, confirmation, the eucharist,
penance, extreme unction, orders, and matrimony, are accepted. Baptism is
administered by pouring and by immersion, chiefly the latter; it usually takes
place several days after birth, and is followed by the ceremony of anointing with
the sacred oil or chrism in the form of a cross, and by the laying on of hands.
The minister also breathes on the child and on the water. The membership of
the church includes all baptized persons. Auricular confession is accepted. Holy
Communion is the sacrament which contains the body and blood of Christ under
appearance of bread and wine. It is received fasting and is given to the laity in
only one kind, the form of bread. The Blessed Virgin and the saints are venerated,
and prayers are offered for the dead.
ORGANIZATION
The organization of the Assyrian Jacobite Apostolic Church centers on the
Patriarch of Antioch, who resides at Mardin, Dair el Zahfaran, and his authority
is supreme on faith and in all church matters. Next in rank is the Metropolitan,
or mifrian, who resides in Mosul and who ordains the bishops. Then follow the
iskiffs and the mitrans, who together with the mifrian, act as advisers to the
patriarch and as heads of various commissions or congregations which have charge
of the church administration. Only a mifrian can become a patriarch. The
mifrian is chosen from the mitrans all of whom are celibates. Then follows the
office of bishop, or koorie (cvhoorie), rhahib, priest, and deacon, respectively.
A deacon under 30 years of age cannot be ordained to the priesthood. A celibate
deacon can be ordained to the office of rhahib, mitran, mifrian, and patriarch.
A married deacon can become a priest, a koorie (cvhoorie), or an iskiff.
The government of this church is democratic, every officer of the church from
the lowest to the highest being chosen by the people. It is also in a sense hier-
archical, for every priest must be ordained by a bishop whose commission is traced
to the apostles through the apostolic succession of bishops. The Patriarch of
Antioch is the supreme head of all the Assyrian churches throughout the world,
and he was represented at the second World Conference on Faith and Order at
Lausanne, Switzerland.
The official periodical of the church is the Beth Nahrin (Mesopotamia), pub-
lished in West New York, N.J.

The data given for 1936 represent 88 fully organized local assemblies, or com-
munities, of Baha'is, with 2,574 voting members, having direct connection with
the National Administrative Board, and there were 10 members under 13 years
of age. With regard to this membership it may also be stated that many other
persons who retain their membership in other denominations attend the Baha'i
meetings and are closely identified with the movement. No parsonages or
Sunday schools were reported.
Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 2 presentP, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of this body for the four census
years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906. The change between 1926 and 1916 in the
character of the returns is explained by a change in the method of organization
of the local assemblies and by the adoption of a more definite basis for voting
membership.

BAHA'IS
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
79
For more than 80 years, the Baht!.'i cause has been steadfastly presented to the
world as the expression for this age of the same universal Spirit which in other
ages spoke through Zoroaster, Muhammad, the Buddha, Moses, Christ; and as
one Divine utterance and continuous purpose, giving forth one and the same
message, albeit adapted to the conditions and human capacities of each time.
Each successive revelation renews the spirit of faith and confirms the ideals of
the previous prophets and messengers; but religion also progresses and each
cycle discloses a new aspect of truth. In Baht!.'u'llt!.h, according to his explicit
text, the Message of God has been revealed to mankind in its fullness and uni-
versality, and the Baha'i cause accordingly represents the fulfillment of that
which was but partially revealed in previous dispensations.
The history and general principles of the Baha'is, as expressed in the teachings
of the founder and his followers, are given in the following condensed statements:
The first significant Baha'i date is May 23, 1844.
At that time Western Asia was decadent, The administration of justice was
inefficient; bribery and dishonesty pervaded all ranks, while education and sani-
tation were neglected. In Persia the dominant religious party was the Shi'ih
sect of Muhammadans, who were noted for intolerance and bigotry and regarded
Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and even Muhammadans of other sects, as people
in error, considering it a merit to insult and revile them. Yet the life of the spirit
was not extinct, and amid the prevailing worldliness and superstition could
still be found some who longed for the establishment of God's kingdom and were
eagerly awaiting the coming of the promised Messenger, confident that the time
of His advent was at hand.
· On the date previously mentioned, there appeared in Shiraz a young man of
24, Mirza 'Ali Muhammad, who took the title of the Bab (i. e., "Gate" or
"Door"), and who bore much the same relation to Baht!.'u'llah as John the
Baptist had to Christ. He publicly announced his mission and began to teach
and train a band of disciples, heralding the dawn of a new era and Qroclaiming
the coming of one ~eater than himself, whom he referred to as "Him Whom
God Shall Manifest. ' From the beginning of his teaching until his martyrdom,
the Bab exemplified in his life the pure spiritual destiny of the prophets and
messengers cf old. Through him a large portion of the Muslim population of
Persia became imbued with the new faith, but against him gathered the fanatical
hatred of the Muslim clergy and the desperate fear of the civil rulers. He was
imprisoned, scourged, haled before tribunals, dragged from one place of confine-
ment to another, and at last, after 6 years of indignities and ill-treatment, was
condemned to death as a heretic to tqe principles of !shim. His execution took
place in the city of Tabriz, where, on July 9, 1850, he was publicly shot in the
barrack square together with one of his followers.
The martyrdom of the Bab fanned the flame of enthusiasm among his adherents
and they grew and multiplied despite fierce persecution. Their houses were
pillaged and destroyed, their wives and children carried off, many were beheaded,
blown from the mouths of cannon, burned, or chopped to pieces. Over 20,000
believers gave up property, families, and lives, rather than deny their faith, yet
for every one that was martyred, many joined the cause.
Among the first and foremost of the Bab's supporters was Mirza Husayn 'Ali,
better known as BaM'u'llah (i. e., Glory of God). He was 2 years older than
the Bab, having been born in Teheran on November 12, 1817. His family was
one of the noblest and oldest in Persia and his own goodness and generosity had
gained for him the title of "Father of the poor," yet this did not prevent his
being thrown into prison when he espoused the cause of the Bab. When, in
1852, there arose a fresh outbreak of persecution against the Babis, as they were
called, BaM'u'llah became the target for all the bitterness engendered by failure
to extin~ish the new light of faith. Confined in a filthy underground dungeon
along WJth murderers and other criminals, loaded with chains, bastinadoed, hA
was finally exiled with his family and a handful of faithful followers to Baghdad
in Mesopotamia. A few months later, he withdrew into the wilderness, where he
spent 2 years in prayer and meditation, living the simple life of the dervish.
After his return his fame became greater than ever. People flocked to Baghdad
to hear him and the Babi movement grew rapidly despite all efforts of the Mullas

to bring about its extinction. So he was ordered to a more distant exile, first in
Constantinop,le, then in Adrianople, and finally confined for life in the desolate
barracks of Akka, a Turkish penal colony on the Mediterranean, south of Beirut
and facing Mount Carmel. Here he instructed a large number of disciples, some
of them coming from a long distance, while he ministered to others through his
writings.
On April 21, 1863, in the garden of Ridvan just outside Baghdad, Baha'u'llah
had made known to a few followers that he was the one proclaimed and promised
by the Bab. This announcement was made public in his famous Epistles in
Adrianople, previous to the journey to 'Akka, in 1868. By this event the Babi
movement was fulfilled in the cause of Baha'u'lhth and the streams of Christian
and Jewish prophecy united with the inner reality of the Muslim religion. Baha-
'u'llah gave the glad tidings to East and West that the day of God had dawned,
that a new and universal cycle had been established-the age of brotherhood, of
peace, of the knowledge of God. This message was inscribed in Tablets, or Epistles,
written during his 40 years of exile and imprisonment, to kings and rulers, to
representatives of the several religions, to his own followers in response to ques-
tions, and in a great number of books containing the essence of universal religion,
science, and philosophy. In the annals of the world, no spiritual revelation has
been made under such conditions of personal oppression and hardship. The effect
of Baha'u'llah upon his followers, even upon his enemies, was unique and inde-
scribable. About him emanated a majesty that glorified every suffering, an awe
that penetrated to the rudest soul, a consecrated love that portrayed man in his
ultimate perfection.
Baha'u'llah ascended in 1892, leaving a testament naming as his successor his
eldest surviving son, Abbas Effendi, better known as 'Abdu'l-Baha (Servant of
Baha). From early childhood he shared his father's labors, and later became the
authoritative interpreter of his teachings. By his singleness of devotion, purity
of life, tireless effort, humanitarian love, and unfailing wisdom, the Baha'i mea~
sage slowly but surely spread to all parts of the world. His confinement at 'Akkli,
lasting 40 years, was terminated at last in 1908 by the overthrow of the old
regime by the Young Turks. From 1911 to 1913 'Abdu'l-Baha journeyed through
Europe and America, unfolding before numerous audiences the spirit of the new
age. In these addresses the message of Baha'u'llah is developed in relation to the
needs of civilization, and an organic harmony is created between religion, science,
economics, and social order. 'Abdu'l-Baha expanded the religion of the spirit
to include all the functions of life, destroying forever the antagonism between
"religious" and "secular" matters.
During the World War communication with friends and believers outside Syria
was almost completely cut off, and 'Abdu'l-Baha and his followers suffered great
hardships. During those dreary years the resourcefulness and sagacious philan-
thropy of 'Abdu'l-Baha were strikingly shown. He personally organized exten-
sive agricultural operations near Tiberias, bringing under cultivation land which
had been untilled for centuries; thus he secured a great supply of wheat by means
of which famine was averted, not only for the Bahli'is but for many of the poor
of all religions, whose wants he liberally supplied. After the cessation of hos-
tilities, a knighthood of the British Empire was conferred upon him in recog-
nition of these services. His manifold activities continued with little abatement
until within a day or two of his passing peacefully to the life beyond, on November
28, 1921, at the age of 77. His funeral was attended by thousands of all ranks,
from the Administrator-General of Palestine and the Governor of Jerusalem to
the poorest beggars of Haifa. Prominent representatives of the Muslim, Christian,
and Jewish communities bore eloquent testimony to the love and admiration for
his life and work, a fitting tribute for one who had labored all his· days for unity
of religions, of races, of tongues.
'Abdu'l-Baha has been succeeded in the leadership of the movement by his
eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, who is now known as "Guardian of the Cause."
DOCTRINE
The Baha'i religion stresses the principle of the Oneness of Mankind. It is in
the light of this principle that all its writings are to be viewed and the purpose of
the movement considered. That a spiritual power has been breathed into the
soul of humanity in this age, which shall remove all causes of difference, mis-
understanding, discord, and disagreement-causes resident in customs and insti-
tutions as well as in personal opinions and emotions-and establish the means
and methods as well as the desire for unity, is the essence of the Baha'i teaching
DigitiZed by GoogIe
BAHA'IS 81
and faith. This principle of oneness involves so many readjustments, mental,
social, and spiritual, that the wars and strifes of these latter times have been
inevitable. ' Abdu'l-Baha gave to Baha'u'llah's message an interpretation
directly and immediately applying to the nature of these readjustments, and
setting forth the following principles:
"Unfettered search after truth and the abandonment of all superstition and
prejudice; the oneness of mankind-all are 'leaves of one tree, flowers in one
garden'; religion must be a cause of love and harmony, else it is no religion; all
religions are one in their fundamental principles; religion must conform with
science, bringing faith and reason into full accord; and recognition of the unity
of God and obedience to His commands as revealed through His Divine Mani-
festations.
"There should be no idle rich and no idle poor; every one should have an occupa-
tion, for 'work in the spirit of service is worship.' Compulsory education is
advocated, especially for girls who will be the mothers and the first educators of
the next generation. In all walks of life, both sexes should have equal oppor-
tunities for development and equal rights and privileges.
"An auxiliary international language should be adopted and taught in all the
schools in order to bring men into closer fellowship and better understanding.
In the interest of universal peace, there should be established a universal league
of nations, in which all nations and peoples should be included, and an Inter-
national Parliament to arbitrate all international disputes."
Thus the mission of BaM'u'llah is the spiritual unity of mankind. While he
came to the East, his mission is to the West as well, and his teachings are suited
to all classes and conditions of men. At present there are Baha'is located not only
in Muhammadan countries, but also throughout Europe, the United States, and
Canada; and this phenomenal spread of the movement, the Baha'is believe, is
due to the fact that Baha'u'llah fulfilled the prophecies of all religious beliefs,
both past and present; and through the power of the Baha'i movement, there
is being created a new religious unity in the world.
ORGANIZATION
The Baha'i movement has no ecclesiastical organization. It holds that an offi-
cial clergy tends to become a substitute for religion rather than an instrument for
carrying spiritual influence into the world. Propaganda is carried on by means
of the local Baha'i communities or groups in which believers and inquirers meet
at stated intervals for study of the "Revealed Words." The local Baha'i com-
munity is given official recognition only after its number of adult declared believers
exceeds nine. Up to this point, the community exists as a voluntary group of
workers and students. This local group, involving as it does men and women in
all the normal activities and relations of life, is the democratic foundation upon
which rests the entire evolution of the cause.
The responsibility for and supervision of local Baha'i affairs is vested in a body
known as the Spiritual Assembly. This body is limited to nine 2 members and is
elected annually on April 21, the first day of Ridvan (the festival commemorating
the declaration of Baha'u'llah). The local Spiritual Assemblies of a country are
linked together and coordinated through another elected body of nine members,
the National Spiritual Assembly. 'Abdu'l-Baha's instructions provide for further
development of Baha'i organization through an International Spiritual Assembly
(Baytu'l-'Adl, i. e., House of Justice) elected by the members of the various
National Spiritual Assemblies, but this international body has not yet come into
existence.
To assist the Guardian (now Shoghi Effendi) in his manifold responsibilities
and duties and particularly in the promotion of the teaching work, 'Abdu'l-Bahli.
provided for the appointment of a group of coworkers to be known as "The Hands
of the Cause of God." The selection of this body is a function of the Guardian,
and these from their own number are to elect nine persons who will be closely
associated with the Guardian in the discharge of his duties. It is the function of
the Guardian also to appoint his own successor, this appointment to be ratified
by nine· Hands of the Cause.
The Baha'is have inaugurated a new calendar, dating their era from the year
of the Bah's declaration, 1844; the New Year falls at the spring equinox (March 21);
and the year consists of 19 months of 19 days each, with four intercalary days.
'In BahA'i symbology, 9ls the number of perfection.
Digitized by Coogle
82 CENS'US OF RELIGIOUS BODI!ES, 193 6
The Baha'i teachings explicitly forbid the appointment of a professional clergy.
They hold that spiritual instruction should not be sold, and their teachers have no
authority over the conscience of any member of the cause. The greatest privilege
of a believer, after securing his own financial independence, is to serve voluntarily
and without pay as a teacher under the supervision of a local or National Spiritual
Assembly.
WORK
The Baha'i faith works for the betterment of mankind and the establishment
of a world civilization. The objects of the Baha'i cause are identical with the
true objects of all revealed religion; to raise man from the earthly to the heavenly
condition; to substitute spiritual laws and realities for natural laws and realities
operating in the darkness of unfaith; to initiate a new age and era of progress and
attainment in the world of mind; and to transform civilization into the glory of
the kingdom. To this end it patiently endeavors to remold the world.
The Baha'is in America have established a national center, a temple of worship,
called the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar (Dawning Place of God's Praise). This is now in
process of completion at Wilmette, a suburb of Chicago. The temple proper or
sanctuary for prayer and praise will be surrounded by accessory buildings of
humanitarian intent, including schools, hospitals, homes for orphans and the
aged, and a university for the study of the higher sciences and arts. The relation
of all these buildings one with another and with the central edifice discloses the
relation of the organic functions of society with the spirit of religion. The
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar perfectly symbolizes the twofold nature of religion--one
aspect the turning to God, the other aspect service to man.
In addition to the house of worship, the American Baha'is operate summer
schools at Green Acre, Eliot, Maine; Geyserville, Calif.; and Davison, Mich.
About 20 of the 88 local assemblies are now incorporated under their respective
State statutes.

BAPTIST BODIES
GENERAL STATEMENT
It is a distinct principle with Baptists that they acknowledge no human founder,
recognize no human authority, and subscribe to no human creed. For all these
things, Baptists of every name and order go back to the New Testament. And
while no competent Baptist historian assumes to be able to trace a succession of
Baptist churches through the ages, most of them are of one accord in believing
that, if we could secure the records, there would be found heroic groups of be-
lievers in every age who upheld with their testimonies and, in many cases, with
their lives, the great outstanding and distinctive principles of the Baptist churches
of today.
As soon as the Reformation gave men opportunity to interpret the teachings
of the Scriptures for themselves, and to embody their convictions in speech and
act, persons holding Baptist doctrines immediately began to appear. In the
first quarter of the sixteenth century, they were found in Germany and Switzer-
land, and were called Anabaptists (Re-baptizers), because they insisted that
persons baptized in infancy must, upon profession of conversion, and in order to
gain admission into church fellowship, be baptized again, although they do not
appear to have insisted always on immersion. These early Anabaptists were in
the main of high character, though in some instances they held doctrines which
led to fanatical outbreaks which aroused no little prejudice against them.
Gradually, in spite of severe persecution, the Anabaptists grew in numbers.
Some of them, driven from Germany, found refuge in the Low Countries and
these were gathered, under the lead of Menno Simons, into the groups of Men-
nonites who passed over into England, and doubtless played an important part
in giving currency to Baptist principles. To their influence, in all probability,
the English Baptists owe their first churches, established in Amsterdam in 1608
and in London in 1611. Glimpses of them appear in the days preceding the
Commonwealth, and during the Cromwellian period they became more prominent.
It was due to this Mennonite influence that the early Baptist churches in England
were Arminian rather than Calvinistic in type, and were termed General Baptists,
indicating belief in a universal atonement, in distinction from Particular Baptists,
indicating a limited atonement. The first Calvinistic or Particular Baptist
church was formed in London in 1638, its members seceding peaceably from an
older Separatist congregation. In 1641 a further secession from the same Sepa-
ratist church occurred, and the new group became convinced from study of the
New Testament that the apostolic baptism was immersion. They sent one of
their number to Holland, where he was immersed by a minister of the Collegiate
Church at Rhynsberg, where the practice of immersion had been introduced, and
on his return the rest of the church were immersed. Gradually this practice was
adopted by all the Baptist churches and became in the popular mind their dis-
tinguishing feature. The General and Particular Baptists were united in 1891.
The first Baptist Church in America was ~robably established by Roger Wil-
liams, the "Apostle of Religious Liberty," in Providence, R. 1., in 1639, although
this honor is dis}>uted by the First Baptist Church of Newport, R. I., organized,
it is claimed, by Dr. John Clarke as pastor, in 1638. Roger Williams was a Sepa-
ratist minister who came to the Massachusetts Colony in 1631, and was banished
from that colony because "he broached and divulged new and dangerous opinions
against the authority of magistrates." Having established himself at Providence,
he adopted essentially Baptist views and soon ~athered a number of converts to
this faith. As there was no Baptist church in eXlStence in America at that time, he
baptized Ezekiel Holliman, who thereupon ba~tized him. Williams then baptized
10 others, and this company of Baptist believers organized themselves mto a
church. John Clarke came from New Hampshire to Newport about the same
time, and, apparently without any connection with the work of Williams, estab-
lished a Baptist church in that town.

These early American Baptist churches belonged to the Particular, or Cal-
vinistic, branch. Later, Arminian views became widely spread for a time, but
ultimately the Calvinistic view of the atonement was generally accepted by the
main body of Baptists in the Colonies. The divisions which now exist began to
make their appearance at a relatively early date. In 1652 the church at Provi-
dence divided, one party organizing a church which marked the beginning of the
General Six Principle Baptists. The Seventh Day Baptist body organized its
first church at Newport in 1671. Arminianism practically disappeared from the
Baptist churches of New England about the middle of the eighteenth century,
but General Baptists were found in Virginia before 1714, and this branch gained
a permanent foothold in the South. As a result of the revival movement, gen-
erally known as the New Light movement, which followed George Whitefield's
visit to New England in 1740, the Separate Baptists came into existence and at
one time were very numerous. The Free Baptists,' in 1779, once more gave a
general and widely accepted expression in New England to the Arminian view of
the atonement.
Soon after the Revolutionary War, the question of the evangelization of the
Negro race assumed importance, and a Colored Baptist church was organized in
1788. With the general revival movement at the close of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the nineteenth centuries, to which the Free Baptists owed no small
part of their growth, there developed, especially in the mountain sections of the
Middle West and in the Southern States, a reaction toward a sterner Calvinism,
which, combined with the natural Baptist emphasis upon individualism, pro-
duced a number of associations strictly, even rigidly, Calvinistic, some of them
going to the extent of dualism, as in the doctrine of the Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit
Predestinarian Baptists.
About the same time, as missionary work became organized into societies,
many of these associations opposed, not so much mission work itself, as its or-
ganization, through fear of a develooing ecclesiasticism. These were variously
termed "Old School," "Antimission/1 "Hard Shell," and "Primitive" Baptists;
but gradually the term "Primitive" became the most widely known and adopted.
In contradistinction to these, the associations, or churches, which approved of
missionary societies, came to be designated Missionary Baptists, though there
was no definite denominational organization under that name.
The denominations mentioned, however, do not represent all who hold Baptist
views, for during the revival period just referred to, the Disciples of Christ and
the Churches of Christ arose, and they have many things in common with Baptists,
although they differ from the other bodies in some interpretations. With them
also may be classed the Adventists, the Brethren (Dunker, Plymouth, and River),
Mennonites, and certain other bodies. The Armenian and Eastern Orthodox
churches practice baptism by immersion, but do not limit it to those of mature
years.
It thus appears that a survey of Baptist bodies should include not only those
which make the term an integral part of their title, but some which are not
ordinarily classed with them. It is also evident that among those who accept
the name Baptists there are many differences, some of great importance. Sev-
enth Day Baptists agree with other Baptist bodies except in regard to the Sab-
bath, but the distinction between Primitive Baptists and Free Will Baptists is
much more marked than between Baptists and Disciples. Any presentation of
the strength of Baptist denominations must take into account these divergencies.
By far the largest body of Baptists, not only in the United States but in the
world, is that popularly known as "Baptist," though frequently referred to, and
listed in the census of 1890, as "Regular Baptists." Other Bar.tist bodies prefix
some descriptive adjective, such as "Primitive," "United," 'General," "Free
Will," etc., but this, which is virtually the parent body, commonly has no such
qualification. Its churches, however, are ordinarily spoken of as "Northern,"
"Southern," and "Colored." This does not imply any divergence in doctrine or
ecclesiastical order. All are one in these respects. It is rather a distinction
adopted for administrative purposes, and based upon certain local or racial charac-
teristics and conditions, the recognition of which implies no lack of fellowship or
of unanimity of purpose. Should these distinctions cease to exist, there is nothing
whatever to prevent the same unity in matters of administration which now exists
in belief, fellowship, and ecclesiastical practice.

STATISTICS
The denominations grouped as Baptists in 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906 are listed
in the table following, with the principal statistics as reported for the four periods.
In 1926 certain changes were noted: Under Negro Baptists were included the
former National Baptist Convention, later the National Baptist Convention,
U.S. A.; the National Baptist Convention of America; the Lott-Carey Missionary
Baptists; and those colored Baptist churches that were formerly reported with the
Northern Baptist Convention. The Free Baptists of the 1916 report became a
part of the Northern Convention. A new body was organized, under the name
Independent Baptist Church of America; and a new denomination came out of
the Southern Baptist Convention, called the American Baptist Association.
In 1936 it will be noted that the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches
in the United States of America, composed of churches which withdrew from
fellowship with the Northern Baptist Convention, appears for the first time.
The National Baptist Evangelical Life and Soul Saving Assembly of the United
States of America, composed of churches which withdrew from the National
Baptist Convention, U. S. A., is reported for the first time. The Seventh Day
Baptists (GermanJ. 1728), which appeared in previous census reports with the
German ~tist .J:Srethren (Dunkers), is now shown with the Baptist bodies.
The Free Will Baptists (Bullockites) did not report as they no longer hold meet-
ings. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau
by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to these
churches only.

The history of the early Baptist churches in New England is one of constant
struggle for existence. The Puritan government of Massachusetts was so bitter
in its opposition that nearly a centu~y after Roger Williams there were but eight
Baptist churches in that colony. Conditions elsewhere were similar, although
farther south there was less persecution. Down to the middle of the eighteenth
century it seemed probable that the General or Arminian, wing would be domi-
nant in New England at least, although in Philadelphia the controversy had re-
sulted in a victory for the Calvinists. With the Great Awakening in 1740, and
the labors of Whitefield, two significant changes appeared in Baptist church
life. Calvinistic views began to predominate in the New England churches, and
the bitter opposition to the Baptists disappeared. By 1784 the 8 churches in
Massachusetts had increased to 73, and extension into the neighboring colonies
had begun. With this growth, however, there developed a conflict similar to
that found in the history of other denominations. The "N:ew Lights," later
known as "Separates," were heart and soul with Whitefield in his demands for
a regenerated church membership; the "Old Lights," or "Regulars," earnestly
opposed the introduction of hitherto unrecognized qualifications for the ministry
or, indeed, for church membership. From New England the movement S}Jread,
becoming for a time especially strong in several Southern States. In the South
the two parties eventually united in fellowship, and reorganized as United Bap-
tists. In New England the conflict wore itself out, the Baptist churches being
modified by both influences.

With the general emancipation from ecclesiastical rule that followed the Revo-
lutionary War, all disabilities were removed from the Baptists in the different
States, and the new Federal Constitution effaced the last vestige of religious
inequality. Under the influence of the later preaching of Whitefield, the close
of the eighteenth century was marked by a renewal of revival interest, and a
new development of the Arminian type of Baptist churches. For some time the
Free Baptists, or Free Will Baptists, as they were variously called, drew consid-
erable strength from the Regular Baptists, but the latter soon became as strong
as ever.
The next significant movement in the Baptist churches was that connected
with the development of foreign missions. In 1792 the Baptists of England had
organized a missionary society to send William Carey to India, and many of
the Baptist churches in the United States had become interested in the move-
ment and contributed toward its support. The first foreign missionary society in
America was the American Board, organized in 1810, in ·which Congregational,
Presbyterian, Reformed, and other churches united, and among its first mis-
sionaries were Adoniram Judson, his wife, and Luther Rice. Knowing that in
India they were to meet Baptists, they made special study of Baptist doctrine,
and before landing came to the couclusion that believers' baptism by immersion
was the true method. Judson immediately sent word of their change of view,
and Rice soon after returned to America to present the cause of Baptist mis-
sions, and succeeded in arousing much interest in the churches. To meet the
new conditions it became evident that some organization was essential, and in
1814 the General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the
United States of America for Foreign Missions was formed.
The missionary work of this organization, however, represented only a part of
its scope or achievement. It was, indeed, the first step toward bringing the
various local churches together and overcoming the disintegrating tendencies of
extreme independence. Heretofore the Baptists alone had had no form of
ecclesiastical organization. Now, through the necessities of administration,
there was furnished just what was needed to combine the different units into a
whole, and arouse what has come to be known as "denominational consciousness."
For a time this convention undertook to care also for home missions, which had
already been carried on in a somewhat desultory manner through a Domestic
Missionary Society in Massachusetts and a similar one in New York. With the
increasing migration westward and the rapid development of the States, both
North and South, the tax upon the convention, in addition to its foreign mission-
ary interests, became too great, and it was deemed advisable to organize a home
missionary society, which was done in 1832. With the development of interest
in publication, a tract society had been formed in 1824, which in 1840 was renamed
the American Baptist Publication Society.
As the discussion in regard to slavery became acute, there arose the differ~_nces
which r~ulted in three conventions-northern, southern, and national. The
northern churches, Baptist as well as others, were strongly antislavery; the
southern churches, Baptist as well as others, were, if not always proslavery,
certainly not antislavery. A crisis was reached when the question was raised
whether the General Missionary Convention (called also the Triennial Convention
because it met once in 3 years) would appoint as a missionary a person who
oWI)ed slaves. To this a very decided negative was returned, and since that
involved a denial of what were considered constitutional rights, the southern
churches withdrew in 1845 and formed the Southern Baptist Convention,'
whose purpose was to do for the southern Baptist churches just what the general
convention had hitherto done for the entire Baptist denomination. It was not
a new denomination; simply a new organization for the direction of the missionary
an'd general evangelistic work of the churches of the Southern States.
The development of the National Baptist Convention, representing the Negro
churches, was naturally slower, and when the census of Baptists for 1926 was
taken numerous divisions made it necessary to use the new term, "Negro
Baptists," which for statistical purposes includes all the various organizations
known as the "National Baptist Convention, U. S. A.," the "National Baptist
Convention of America," the "Lott-Carey Missionary Baptists," and the colored
Baptist churches, that were formerly included in theNorthern Baptist Convention.

DOCTRINE
Baptists agree with other evangelical bodies on many points of doctrine.
Their cardinal principle is implicit obedience to the plain teachings of the Word
of God. Under this principle, while maintaining with other evangelical bodies
the great truths of the Christian religion, they hold: (1) That the churches are
independent in their local affairs; (2) that there should be an entire separation of
church and state; (3) that religious liberty or freedom in matters of religion is
an inherent right of the human soul; (4) that a church is a body of regenerated
people who have been baptized on profession of personal faith in Christ, and
have associated themselves in the fellowship of the gospel; (5) that infant baptism
is not only not taught in the Scriptures, but is fatal to the spirituality of the
church; (6) that from the meaning of the word \lsed in the Greek text of the
Scriptures, the symbolism of the ordinance, and the practice of the early church,
immersion in water only constitutes baptism; (7) that the scriptural officers of a
church are pastors and deacons; and (8) that the Lord's Supper is an ordinance
within the church obsetved in commemoration of the sufferings and death of Christ.
The beliefs of Baptists have been incorporated in confessions of faith. Of
these, the Philadelphia Confession, originally issued by the London Baptist
churches in 1689 and adopted with some enlargements by the Philadelphia Asso-
ciation in 1742, and the New Hampshire Confession, adopted by the New Hamp-
shire State Convention in 1832, are recognized as the most important. The
Philadelphia Confession is strongly Calvinistic. The New Hampshire Confession
modifies some of the statements of the earlier documents, and may be character-
ized as moderately Calvinistic. But while these confessions are recognized as
fair expressions of the faith of Baptists, there is nothing binding in them, and they
are not regarded as having any special authority. The final court of appeal for
Baptists is the Word of God. Within limits, considerable differences in doctrine
are allowed, and thus o~ortunity is given to modify beliefs as new light may
break from or upon the Word. Among Baptists heresy trials are rare.
ORGANIZATION
Baptist Church polity is congregational, or independent. Each church is
sovereign so far as its own discipline and worship are concerned, calls or dismisses
its own pastor, elects its own deacons or other officers, and attends to its own
affairs. Admission to church membership is by vote of the church, usually after
examination of the candidate by the church committee. There is no specific age
limit, but each applicant must have heard the Gospel and believed for himself on
the Lord Jesus Christ. All members have equal voting rights in church matters,
except that in some phurches they are restricted to those over a certain age. The
officers are the pastor and deacons, who, with such other persons as the church
may elect, constitute a church committee, usually called the standing committee,
and have general care of the affairs of the church, but no authority, except as it
is specifically delegated to them by the church. Church property is held some-
times by a board of trustees, sometimes by the entire society, and sometimes by
a special committee of the church.
For missionary and educational or other purposes, Baptist churches usually
group themselves into associations and State conventions. The oldest is the
Philadelphia Association, organized in 1707, which stood alone until1751, when
the Charleston Association was formed in South Carolina. These associations
and conventions meet annually and are composed of messengers sent by the
churches. They elect their own officers, receive reports from the churches, and
make recommendations with regard to work or other matters in which the churches
are interested. They have, however, no authority to legislate for the churches,
and no power to enforce any action they may take. Many of them conduct
missionary or educational work in the fields covered by them.
Applicants for the ministry are licensed to preach by the church in which
they hold membership. If, after a period of service as licentiate, ordination is
desired, a council of sister churches is called by the church in which membership
is held, and on the recommendation of this council, the church arranges for ordi-
nation. In both cases the right to license and the right to ordain are held by the
individual church. Previous to ordination there is always an examination of the
candidate on matters of religious experience, call to the ministry, and views on
scriptural doctrine. During his ministry, a pastor is usually a member of the
church which he serves, and is amenable to its discipline. When a question of
dismissal from the ministry arises, the individual church calls a council of sister
churches for the examination of charges, and on the recommendation of this
council, the church usually bases its decision.

•
Besides local associations and State conventions, the Baptists have general, or
national conventions, with home mission societies, foreign mission societies,
educational societies, etc. These larger bodies attend to missionary or educational
work in the various States or districts, and are supported by the churches. Like
the local associations, none of these larger organizations has any authority over the
individual churches.
WORK
The organized activities of the Baptist churches are, for the most part, con-
ducted by societies whose membership includes individuals and delegates from
churches or associations, membership in most cases being based on contributions.
Until the separation of the northern and southern churches, the home missionary
work was carried on chiefly by The American Baptist Publication Society, or-
ganized in 1824, and The American Baptist Home Mission Society, organized
in 1832; and the foreign missionary work, by the General Missionary Convention
of the Baptist Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign Missions,
organized in Philadelphia in 1814. Since the organization of the Southern Bap-
tist Convention the publication society has continued its work throughout the
different States and has retained its distinctly national character. The American
Baptist Home Mission Society/ however, subsequently represented the northern
churches only, as did also the oreign missionary society, which in 1846 changed
its name to the American Baptist Missionary Union, and again in 1910, to the
American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society. ·
A general movement, manifest throughout the country, in church life as well
as in business and public matters, is that for centralization of administration, in
the interest of both economy and efficiency. The Baptist churches felt this, as
did every other denomination, and began to consider whether their benevolent
societies, hitherto in some respects distinct from each other, might not be brought
into some form of general organization which, by removing possibilities of fric-
tion and securing cooperation, would make for greater efficiency. After con-
siderable discussion a move in this direction was made in 1907, which has been
carried out quite successfully and, it is expected, will work great good both to
the activities of the churches and their general denominational life.
Educational work among the Baptists in the United States has made great
strides in recent years, but the same general independence of ecclesiastical con-
trol is manifest in this department as in the government of the local churches,
and is illU8trated in the University of Chicago. The same is true of the manage-
ment of Baptist philanthropic institutions. In most cases, however, the mem-
bership of the boards is limited to persons connected with Baptist churches.
In addition to the work done by the denominational societies, a large amount
of missionary and educational work is carried on by individual churches, which is
not included in any denominational statement.

State tables.-Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the Northern Bap-
tist Convention by States. Table 3 gives for each State for 1936 the number
and membership of the churches classified according to their location in urban or
rural territory, membership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools. Table
4 gives the number and membership of the churches for the four census years
1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under 13 years
of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the value of churches and
parsonages and the amount of debt on church edifices for 1936. Table 6 presents,
for 1936, the church expenditures, showing separately current expenses, improve-
ments, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics of
any individua1 church, separate presentation in tables 5 and 6 is limited to those
States in which three or more churches reported value and expenditures.
Ecclesiastica1 divisions.-Table 7 presents, for each association in the Northern
Baptist Convention, the more important statistical data for 1936 shown by States
in the preceding tables, including number of churches, membership, value and debt
on church edi!'ices, expenditures, and Sunday schools.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION
Northern Baptist origins.-Beginning with the oldest branches of Northern Bap-
tist activity, Baptist work before the war of the American Revolution was confined
aThla statement was furnished by Dr. Clarence M. Gallup, recording secretary, Northern Baptist Con-
vention, New York, N.Y.
Digitized by Goog[e
108 CENSUS' OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
to plans of individual local churches and small groups of neighboring churches,
called associations. These associational groups appeared in Virginia, Rhode
Island, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and gradually the associations themselves
came t.o stand together for the propagation of their form of faith, for the general
principle of freedom of conscience in religious concerns, and for mutual defense of
their forms of organization. The first Baptist commonwealth, founded in Rhode
Island by Roger Williams, an associate of men like Cromwell and Milton in
England and of Governor Winthrop in the New England colonies, grew into areas
of influence like that of the Philadelphia Association which, in turni was the mother
of other associations like the Warren Association, in Rhode sland. George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin all acknowledged indebt-
edness to the Baptists of Virginia and Rhode Island for principles so well estab-
lished and proven valid that they embodied them in their drafts of the Declaration
of Independence and of the Constitution of the United States. These early
associations established libraries, schools, colleges, and churches in their humble
and meager way, some of which have become institutions of national prominence
and great fame. But it was not until the nineteenth century that Baptists in
the North had grown to numbers large enough, and means of travel and communi-
cation had become sufficiently general through the railroad and the telegraph, for
the denomination, along with other denominations, to envision an organic and
organized career for the group as a whole.
Northern Baptistsafter separationfrom the South.-TheNorthern Baptist churches
withdrew from organic connection with the Southern Baptist churches about
1844. While it is generally supposed that this rift was caused by differences of
opinion regarding slavery, as was the case in some other denominations, the real
reason for the breach was a difference over the method of raising and distributing
missionary moneys.
After this adjustment had been made, the churches of the North and their group
organizations moved ahead with new growth and energy. The heated contro-
versies concerning theological and denominational ideologies, which had character-
ized the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth, had been succeeded by
a spirit of realism and of need for associated effort in the new group. It was a period
of building vehicles for moving the projects mutually sponsored by the churches.
The American Baptist Missionary Union (later named the American Baptist
Foreign Mission Society), the American Baptist Home Mission Society, and the
American Baptist Publication Society all were organized in the early nineteenth
century, before the Northern and Southern Baptist separation; and they pro-
ceeded vigorously with their work, which has been maintained with great enter-
prise ever since.
Organization of a new denomination.-A great change in the methods of the
Northern Baptists resulted from the formation of the Northern Baptist Conven-
tion, at Washington, D. C., in 1907. In this scheme of things, the convention
exists as a corporation, chartered under the laws of the State of New York, with
broad powers to conduct religious work, receive and expend funds, act as financial
trustee, and affiliate itself with other similar bodies. Previously, the churches
operated through their missionary societies. Now, they united their far-flung
interests in an inclusive corporation.
Following this arrangement, the aforesaid three societies, together with the
Woman's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society and the Woman's American
Baptist Home Mission Society, became so-called "Cooperating Organizations" of
the convention, although maintaining their own charters, powers of self-direction,
and management. The convention also instituted and caused to be incorpo-
rated the Board of Education to supervise the work of the denomination among
Baptist schools and colleges, and the Ministers and Missionaries Benefit Board to
collect and distribute funds for the financial relief of needy Baptist ministers and
missionaries, their widows and dependent children. In 1920 the Ministers and
Missionaries Benefit Board adopted a retiring pension plan as a means of definite
contributory pensions for ministers at the age of 65, based on salaries and terms
of service.
Later developments in organization, by which the work of this convention was
ramified, included a closer relationship of the Baptist State conventions of the
Northern convention territory and the better grade of local City Mission Societies
with the Northern Convention itself, under the classification "Affiliated Organi··
zations." The "Cooperating Organizations" and the "Affiliated Organizations"
assist the convention in raising and distributing funds under that which is known
as the "cooperative plan," with a "unified budget." Other organizations related
DigitiZed by GoogIe
NORTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION 109
to or associated with the Northern Baptist Convention are the American Baptist
Historical Society, Baptist Young People's Union of America, National Council
of Northern Baptist Men, and Ministers Council.
The constituent factor in the Northern Baptist group is the local church. Each
church is independent of every other church and of the convention itself, except
as they act together by agreement. The convention sessions are delegated
assemblies, composed of delegates from the churches, duly accredited, and ex-of-
ficio delegates from certain national and State bodies. The managing body of
the convention is the General Council, when the convention is not in session;
but the convention, when in session, has supreme authority in its own affairs.
The most continuously and widely active body among the convention councils is
the Council on Finance and Promotion, which promotes giving among individuals
and churches, and manages the collection of funds for the unified budget, except
as the various organizations secure, on their own initiative, "designated" gifts.
Other councils for special activities are the Council on Christian Education and
the Council on World Evangelization. Besides these councils, many committees,
elected or appointed annually or for longer periods, function according to their
obvious purposes as indicated by their names, such as law, finance, budget research,
resolutions, American home, Baptist bodies using foreign languages, city missions,
conference with other religious bodies, denominational calendar, historical libraries
and societies, homes and hospitals, public relations, social service, race relations,
State conventions, traffic bureau-and other committees appointed for immediate
service only. All the foregoing councils and committees are amenable to the
advice of the General Council.
Organic union of the various missionary societies of the denomination has been
broached several times, but legal and pragmatic difficulties have failed to be
surmounted at such times. Nevertheless, the present arrangement has resulted
in some elimination of expenditures and of overlapping in methods, and has
tended toward a unity and efficiency which were sadly lacking 40 years before.
Financial acquisitions.-In its financial undertakings, the Northern Baptist
Convention has had reasonably good success. Many millions of dollars have
been raised for its general business, as shown by the pledges for its united work,
received in the so-called New World Movement, amounting to approximately
$52,000,000, payable over a period of 5 years. From this income and that from
invested funds, vast advance projects were launched; educational institutions
were strengthened or endowed; churches and mission stations were built; new
fields at home and abroad were opened; more missionaries were commissioned;
great publishing enterprises were begun. Through a period of approximately a
century, from the group of a few original societies to the present seven major
denominational societies and boards, the assets of these organizations have
attained the amount of $58,981,196. In addition to these funds, the property
and endowment assets of the churches of the denomination are now $193,512,662,
and of its schools and colleges $254,738,176. These figures do not include assets
of Stateconventions nor city mission societies, nor of associated organizations,
which are very varied and scattered. During the fiscal year 1935-36, the churches
spent $14,262,740 for operating expenses and contributed $2,258,792 for missions.
Social service.-The general social and philanthropic attitudes of this Con-
vention are exhibited in service rendered by many city mission societies and their
sociological centers; studies of the American home; coordination of religious
bodies using foreign languages; conferences on race relations; furtherance of
historical research; establishment of Baptist homes for the aged and orphans, and
hospitals for all; promotion of social reforms; and youth-training enterprises.
Tnterdenominational relationships.-The denomination has reacted favorably
in some measure to the tendency toward cooperation and unity among the
Christian denominations. Not only are the donations noted in a previous
paragraph made to the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and to
the World Council of Churches, but the Northern Baptist Convention sends
nearly a score of delegates annually to the Federal Council and sent representa-
tives to the first and preliminary meeting of the World Council. Several of the
members of the convention serve on the executive committee of the Federal
Council. Closer relations than formerly are now maintained with the General
Baptists, the Disciples of Christ, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the
National Baptist Convention. Fraternal delegates are sent as messengers to
various Baptist bodies in Canada. In its wider affiliations, the denomination
shares importantly in official ranks and in forensic honors among the great eccle-
siastical councils of the world, such as those at Oxford, Edinburgh, Utrecht, and
elsewhere. About 25 years ago the Northern Baptist Convention received into
DigitiZed by GoogIe
110 CENSUS' OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
full fellowship and all privileges of service the Free Will Baptists. During the
World War, the convention provided its quota in the Chaplain Corps of the
United States Army and in the Red Cross organizations.
Size of the denomination.-In 1936, the Northern Baptist Convention reported
7,716 churches with 1,458,811 members and with S,300 pastors and missionaries.
There were Sunday schools to the number of 6,732, with an enrollment of 1,150,891.
Statistics concerning the missionary and philanthropic organizations are given in
other sections of this review.
DOCTRINE
The doctrinal requisites for Baptists are at an almost irreducible minimum.
Although various groups and assemblies, at various times, have endeavored to
formulate "Confessions of Faith," such as the "New Hampshire Confession";
and although many local churches have "Articles of Faith" and "Church Cove-
nants," these last are adopted by the individual churches, are for their own use
locally, and are binding on no other churches than the ones which adopted them.
Even in the local church there is wide liberty of opinion permitted concerning these
doctrinal statements. The number and length of them tends steadily to decrease.
One reason for this light hold of creedal statement is that Baptists generally hold
to the view that the Bible itself, especially the New Testament, is the only proper
compendium for faith and practice; and the individual conscience and intelligence,
enlightened by the Divine Spirit, is the proper interpreter thereof. The second
reason is that the epoch-making and successful battle which early American Bap-
tists and others made for freedom of conscience in religion and worship was cal-
culated to reduce the amount of regimentation of thought among them.
Baptists, in general,believe in religious freedom, the validity and inspiration of
the Scriptures, the Lordship of Christ, the immortality of the soul, the brotherhood
of man, the future life, the need of redemption from sin, and the ultimate triumph
of the Kingdom of God. Various groups and individuals hold to other items of
conviction, which are not so universally accepted, and by many are regarded as
secondary.
While, for centuries, Baptists generally have stood for the validity and value of
two ordinances, baptism and the Lord's Supper, their insistence ha.S been limited
to those two; and their views as to the vital efficacy of those ordinances have
gradually shaded into a conviction of their value as an aid to Christian witness
and comfort, rather than as a vital necessity for Christian character. This in-
creasing liberalism is especially characteristic of Northern Baptists, and has come
about more or less through the increase of scholarship and the association and
conference in the north of many more diverse groups than are found elsewhere in
the land.
So-called fundamentalism, or reactionary and conservative bodies of thought
revolving around the Scriptures and theology, is found somewhat among Northern
Baptists; but this phenomenon is not peculiar to them, being found also in prac-
lically all evangelical communions.
WORK
In this section are presented the operations of the Northern Baptist Conven-
tion through its agencies, as distinguished from the general scope and principles
of action treated in foregoing paragraphs.
Mission work in the United States and its dependencies.-The American Baptist
Publication Society was organized in 1824. Its operations have not been con-
fined to the North, but its offices and chief property are in Philadelphia, and it is
fully recognized as a unit of the Northern Baptist Convention organization, with
which it is in full cooperation. It has several departments: Publishing, mission-
ary (including Bible distribution and evangelism), religious education, vacation
schools, social education, and youth training. The missionary department em-
ploys religious education directors, State missionary pastors, chapel car mission-
aries, and automobile colporteurs. It distributes Bible and other literature in
a number of different languages. In 1936 the American Baptist Publication
Society was employing 127 agents; it bad organized over 7,000 Sunday schools
and over 2,000 churches during its history up to that time; churches assisted in
part numbered many thousands; young people's societies assisted numbered over
5,000; and its own religious literature was distributed, representing 118 different
publications amounting to 400,000,000 total pages for the year, not counting the
output of miscellaneous literature by many publishers, through the various book
DigitiZed by GoogIe
NORTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION 111
stores maintained by the society in strategic locations throughout the United
States. The income of the society from all sources was $1,086,854, and the total
assets were $4,753,489.
The American Baptist Home Mission Society was organized in 1832. It
employs general missionaries and pastors among people of both English and
foreign tongues, in the United States, ~exico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba· it aids
city missions; builds meeting houses; maintains schools for Negroes and indians;
and promotes evangelism and various phases of social service.
In 1936, this society employed a staff and agents in the field to the number of
502, including missionary teachers. There were 821 churches aided (including
Latin and North America); the churches assisted in the Church Edifice Depart-
ment from 192G-36 numbered 295 and to the extent of $1,074,350; the total
income of this society from all sources was $501,570 for the year, and the total
assets were $17,240,230.
The Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society was organized origi-
nally in 1877, and was consolidated in 1909 with the Women's Baptist Home
.Mission Society of Michigan, with headquarters in Chicago. Its object, primarily,
is the employment of women missionaries to work chiefly among peoples using
foreign languages, and among Negroes and Indians; and the maintenance of
training schools for missionary workers. This society employed 179 missionaries
and 22 native teachers and had 14 nurses in training in 1936. Of the mission-
aries, 18 were assigned, 1 each, to the same number of foreign language churches.
Christian centers were maintained in cities to the number of 38, in cooperat ion
with the American Baptist Home Mission Society, State conventions, or city
mission societies. Five Indian mission stations were maintained. The total
income was $186,828. The total assets were $3,193,202.
Miasion work in foreign countries.-The American Baptist Foreign Mission
Society was organized in Philadelphia in 1814, as the "General Missionary Con-
vention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign
Missions." In 1846 the name was changed to the "American Baptist Mission
Union," and again in 1910 the name was changed to "American Baptist Foreign
Mission Society." •
The fields in which this society operates in the Far East are India (including
Burma and Assam), China, Japan, Africa, and the Philippines. In Europe
work is carried on in Sweden, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Finland, Den-
mark, and Norway (and formerly in Russia); but this work is confined almost
entirely to assistance in the training of ministers and in the meeting of the ex-
penses of local churches. American missionaries are not sent to these countries
and the work there is on an entirely different basis from that in Asia and Africa.
The statistics for this society for 1935-36 included the following: Countries in
which work was projected, 10 (not including Europe); resident missionaries, 545;
stations occupied, 122; American missionaries, 545; native workers, 10,039;
churches assisted in foreign lands, 916; schools maintained in foreign lands, 4,326
(of which 2,361 were self-supporting); hospitals and dispensaries, 95, treating
25,908 in-patients and 287,203 out-patients (a total of 313,111); total income
derived from all sources was $1,097,848. Total assets were $10,249,702.
This society cooperates with the Baptists in nine European countries. This work
is represented by 2,034 workers, ordained and unordained; 647 organized churches,
with 110,949 members; 1,444 Sunday schools, with 58,335 members; 7 theological
seminaries, with 85 students. The amount of money raised by Baptists in these
lands was $242,127 in Europe and $274,806 in the 10 mission fields in other lands.
The society maintains training schools for native workers, and cooperates with
other Baptist national organizations, both American and European.
The Woman's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society is in close cooperation
with the general foreign society. This organization is a continuation of the two
former societies, the Woman's American Foreign Mission Society and the Woman's
Baptist Foreign Mission Society of the West. The earlier societies were organ-
ized in 1871 and their consolidation occurred in 1914.
The work of this society is a broad parallel of that of the general society, but
with special emphasis upon the work among girls and women in the foreign-
mission stations, in the schools and colleges, and in the area of medical and social
work in foreign countries. This society is highly organized in this country, every
district, State, and church being represented in or contacted by the official circle.
Large amounts of literature are distributed and many interesting devices for the
raising of money in small amounts from individuals are constantly originated.
For 1936 the society employed 199 missionaries in educational, medical (nurses
DigitiZed by GoogIe
112 CENSUS OF RF.LIGIOUS BODIF..S, 19 3 6
and physicians), and social work in 10 countries, at 51 definite stations. The
income of the society from all sources was $334,345, and the total assets amounted
to $2,544,573.
Affiliated missionary ·organizations.-Large and influential organizations
affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention are the State Baptist conventions
in 30 States, including special groups jn the District of Columbia, Missouri,
Oklahoma, and Puerto Rico· and 16 standard city-mission societies, operating
among foreign-speaking peopies, the under-privileged, and the humbler classes of
population generally, and maintaining church services, educational and social
service centers, hospitalization, Americanization, etc.
Education work.-The general education work of the Northern Baptist Conven-
tion is under the supervision and direction of the Board of Education, a corpora-
tion organized by the convention in 1920 to succeed the American Baptist Edu-
cation Society, which had functioned since 1888. This board assists Baptist
secondary schools and colleges financially, and in some cases exercises direct
control of them. In non-Baptist institutions, and in State universities to some
extent, the board supervises Baptist religious interests as here indicated.
There are 19 colleges, 10 junior colleges, and 11 secondary schools, caring for
white pupils, in which this board has some interest or control. These institutions
have 2,585 teachers and 30,236 pupils, as of 1936. They have real property
amounting to $102,249,601 and endowments of $152,488,515. There are also seven
schools for Negroes in the Southern States maintained in whole or in part by
agencies of the Northern Baptist Convention, such as the American Baptist Home
Mission Society, in which the Board of Education has a hand. The total enroll-
ment of these schools in 1936 was 128 teachers and 2,200 students. The property
of these schools is valued at $2,579,839 and the endowments amount to $1,954,923.
The Convention maintains I school for Indians in the United States at Bacone,
Okla., with 18 teachers and 260 students; and a property worth $365,000, with
an endowment of $233,000. The Convention also cares for some schools among
the foreign-language peoples of the United States, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Haiti,
Mexico, and Nicaragua. In the United States, there are 6 missionary and
religious work training schot>ls wit.h 46 teachers, 177 students; property valued
at $931,465 and endowments of $219,490. In addition to the foregoing, there
are 10 theological seminaries with 137 teachers, 1,512 students; property valued
at $5,.594,144, and endowments aggregating $13,191,371.
The Board of Education also maintains student pastors and similar agencies in
various colleges; and it conducts work for youth of both sexes .through its mission-
ary education department, which is popularly known under the names of World
Wide Guild, Royal Ambassadors, and Crusaders. The work of this department
also has a very wide scope among the adults of the churches and Sunday schools.
Closely allied with the work of the educational agencies of the Northern Baptist
Convention is the self-directed work of the Baptist Young People's Union of
America, a fraternal organization for the young people's societies of the Baptist
churches. In this organization are approximately 6,000 young people's unions,
with at least 150,000 members, and a considerable number of Christian Endeavor
Societies closely affiliated with the major Baptist Union.
Philanthropic enterpriseR.-While vast areas of philanthropic work are covered
by the various missionary societies of the denomination, including medical
missions and relief work, the outstanding philanthropic endeavor of the denomi-
nation is expressed in the splendid outreach of the Ministers and Missionaries
Benefit Board, which is the organization for pensions and relief among ministers,
missionaries, their widows and dependent children, of the Northern Ba.ptist
Convention. This incorporated board was 23 years of age in 1936 and, beginning
its work with only $250,000, at its twenty-third anniversary had assets valued at
$21,000,000, representing pension, general, permanent, and annuity funds. In
this year, the board had 2,839 members in its pension plan, of whom 33 percent
were already drawing pensions amounting to approximately $350,000; and other
beneficiaries, approximately 1,400, to whom, as individuals, grants were made in
extreme need for personal or family use. This board also receives annuity gifts
and issues binding contracts for the same. During its existence the board has
distributed in pensions and relief approximately $8,000,000.
Another philanthropic enterprise of the denomination is represented by the
Association of Baptist Homes and Hospitals. The association is in its infancy,
but already promises great usefulness. Baptist independent hospitals, and homes
for the aged and for orphans, which have performed important service to a
Baptist constituency, are now leagued together for enlarged scope and increased
resources. At present there are 6 hospitals, 20 homes for the aged, and 16
DigitiZed by GoogIe
NORTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION 113
orphanages, representing an average of 13,447 patients in the hospitals, and of
1,945 residents in the homes. The value of the property of these institutions is
$6,281 263, and their endowments amount to $3,846,411.
Publication agencies and projects.-Tbe publication interests of the North-
ern Baptists are varied and extensive. The American Baptist Publication
Society publishes several score of religious books a year, besides "The Annual"
(reports) of the Northern Baptist Convention and "The American Baptist Year-
Book" (statistics). This society also issues regularly 118 Sunday school and
other periodicals. The society maintains branches and stores in various cities of
the United States and Canada. In addition to this publication society,· the Ger-
man Baptist Publication Society, of Cleveland, Ohio, and the Swedish Baptist
Publication Society, of Chicago, Ill., produce a number of publications; and some
publication work is carried on by the Hungarian, Roumanian, Polish, Italian,
French, and Slovak Baptist or~anizations.
The various missionary societies and the Council on Finance and Promotion
print and distribute a large array of books, leaflets, and pamphlets everr_ year,
which are distributed through the literature department of the Board of Educa-
tion and, also, directly from the societies. ·
The principal denominational magazines (weekly, monthly, and quarterly)
in English are The Watchman-Examiner, Missions, The Ministry, and The
Baptist Minister; and tbe foreign-speaking conventions also publish some 40
periodicals of their own. The State conventions publish their own State bulletins
monthly, and the Council on Finance and Promotion provides all denominational
leaders with a monthly news bulletin of leading denominational items.
Pageantry and religious drama are more and more engaging the attention of
players' guilds in the churches, with the result that denominational authorship
is on the increase. The visualization department of the Council on Finance and
Promotion, by stereopticon, motion pictures, and crayon talks has developed a
widespread influence and business. There have been years and decades when the
figures were higher or,:lower according to circumstances than in 1936. All in
all, however, the Northern Baptist Convention has had a steady growth in mem-
bers, finances, and influence.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classiflcation.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Southern Baptist Convention for the year
1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures
between· urban and rural territory. The statistics for the Southern Baptist
Convention are incomplete, due to the failure of the pastor or clerk of the church
to furnish a report to this Bureau after repeated requests. The data presented
here represent a compilation of the reports received.*
The membership of this denomination comprisea those who have been received
into the local churches upon voluntary confession of faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ and a willingness to carry out His will, and baptism by immersion.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
At the time of the formation of the Triennial Convention in 1814 2 the Baptist
population was chiefly in New England and the middle and southern seaboard
States, and the center of executive administration was located first at Philadelphia
and subsequently at Boston. With the growth of migration to the South and
Southwest, the number of churches in those sections of the country greatly
increased, and it became difficult to associate in a single advisory council more
than a small percentage of the Baptist churches in the United States, especially
as means of transportation were deficient and expensive. At the same time the
question of slavery occasioned much discussion between the two sections, which
was brought to a focus by the impression in the Southern States that the foreign
mission society of the denomination, which had its headquarters in Boston, was
so thoroughly antislavery that it would not accept a slaveholder as a missionary.
A letter addressed direct to that organization by the Alabama State Convention,
asking for information, brought a courteous reply to the effect that while the
board refused to recognize the claim of anyone, slaveholder or nonslaveholder,
to appointment, "one thing was certain, they could never be a party to any
arran~ement which would imply approbation of slavery."
ThiS decision led to formal withdrawal of the various Southern State conventions
and auxiliary foreign mission societies and to the organization at Augusta, Ga.,
in May 18451 of the Southern Baptist Convention. About 300 churches were
represented oy delegates from Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and Kentucky, the largest number of
Baptist churches in the South at that period being in Virginia. In all the discus-
sions and in the final act of organization, there was very little bitterness, the
prevalent conviction being that those of kindred thought would work more effec-
tively together, and that, in view of the sharp differences between the two sections,
it was wiser that separate organizations should exist. The specific purpose of
the convention, as plainly set forth, was to carry out the benevolent purposes of
those composing it; to elicit, combine, and direct the energies of the denomination
for the propagation of the Gospel; and to cooperate for the promotion of foreign
and domestic missions and other important objects, while respecting the independ-
ence and equal rights of the local churches.
Previous to the Civil War the convention met biennially; since that time, for
the most part, it has met annually. At first, its efforts were largely given over
to foreign missions, under the direction of the Foreign Mission Board at Richmond,
Va., and to home ("domestic") missions under the direction of the Home Mission
Board located first at Marion, Ala., and later at Atlanta, Ga., although a number
of the cooperating State Conventions were fostering schools and colleges of various
types. The Home Mission Board, from the first, moreover, gave its most earnest
consideration and its largest help to the mission work carried on in the several
States, notably in the States where Baptists were weak. From 1845 onward,
therefore, the Southern Baptist Convention fostered foreign missions, home
missions, and State missions.
In 1859 the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, now at Louisville, Ky., be-
gan work; in addition to this seminary the Southern Baptist Convention now owns
and controls the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, at Fort Worth,
Tex., and the Baptist Bible Institute, at New Orleans, La. In 1863 the first
Sunday School Board was launched, but in 1873, owing to the great financial
panic of the times, its work was turned over to the Home Mission Board; in
1891 the present Sunday School Board was established at Nashville, Tenn.
In 1888 the Woman's Missionary Union was organized at Richmond, Va.;
in 1896 the work of the Baptist Young People's Union was officially launched;
in 1900 and 1918 this work was placed under the auspices of the Sunday School
Board; in 1918 the Board of Ministerial Relief and Annuity was established,
with headquarters at Dallas, Tex.; in 1920 the Board of Education was estab-
lished at Birmingham, Ala. This board was changed to the Southern Baptist
Education Commission in 1928.

Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Dr. E. P . .Alldredge, M . .A., D. D., secretarY ofthe Department Survey,

SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION 141
Hospital work of the convention began with the building of a great tubercu-
losis hospital at El Paso, Tex., in 1919, and a general hospital at New Orleans,
La., in 1924, although State conventions had previously supported their own
hospitals. During this period, also, the Laymen's Mission Movement, now
known 88 the Brotherhood Movement, came into existence, headquarters are at
Knoxville, Tenn. In 1927 the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist
Convention, with greatly enlarged powers, was located at Nashville, Tenn.
Up to 1860 the missionary work of the convention was carried forward with
marked enthusiasm and success. Every department of denominational life was
quickened by the increased sense of responsibility and the increased confidence
that sprang from direct control. Parallel with this was the growth in numbers
and liberality of the denomination, which was strengthened by the standing
confiict with the antimissionary spirit rife throughout the South, and manifest
more particularly among the Primitive or "Hardshell," the United, and the
Regular Baptists. The denomination suffered severely during the Civil War,
but since that time has shown great prosperity.
As was inevitable, emancipation brought about great changes in racial condi-
tions, and, whereas before the war the Negro Baptists were, in large part, iden-
tified with the white churches, after the war they formed their own churches,
associations, and. State conventions, and, later, the National Baptist Conven-
tion.• The first Negro association to be formed under the new regime was one
in Louisiana in 1865, and it was soon followed by others in North Carolina,
Alabama, Virginia, Arkansas, and Kentucky. An indication of the development
of the Southern convention is found in the fact that, whereas in 1845 the mem-
bership of the churches identified with it was 352,950, of whom 222,950 were
white and 130,000 Negro, the report for 1890 showed a membership of 1,2801066,
consisting of whites alone and by 1935 had become the leading non-Catnolic
religious body in America, reporting a total of 4,389,417 members.
With the entrance of the United States into the World War the Southern
Baptist Convention took up religious work for the Army and Navy most heartily
and effectively. It was represented on the General Committee on Chaplains of
the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, though not a constit-
uent member of that body, and contributed liberally toward the work of the Red
Cross, Young Men's Christian Association, and kindred organizations.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine the Southern Baptist churches are in harmony with those of the
NorthJ.although in general they are more strictly Calvinistic, and the New Hamp-
shire lJonfession of Faith is more firmly held than in the Northern churches. In
polity, likewise, there is no essential difference. The Northern and Southern
churches interchange membership and ministry on terms of perfect equality, and
their separation is purely administrative in character, not doctrinal or ecclesias-
tical.
WORK
The work of the Southern Baptist churches is carried on through five denomina-
tional boards, having charge, respectively, of home missions, foreign missions,
Sunday school work, educational institutions, and ministerial relief.
The home mission work, under the care of the Home Mission Board, covers
the entire territory of the South, and also Cuba, Isle of Pines, and the Panama
Canal Zone. In addition it goes into southern Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
and Missouri, cooperating with the Baptist State executive boards in the various
State conventions. It does cooperative work with the Negro Baptists in the
South, conducts missionary operations among the foreigners, maintains work
among the Indians in Oklahoma and other Southern States, and operates several
mountain mission schools in the southern Appalachian and Ozark highlands. A
department of evangelism has an able director who participates both in the city
and rural campaigns and in other activities. A church extension department
has a building loan fund of $1,350,000, and the erection of church buildings is
annually aided by gifts and loans to the extent of about $100,000. An educa-
tional and publicity department conducts a large propaganda for the instruction of
the denomination in the principles and activities of home missions. In 1936 the
total number of persons employed in the work of the board was 207, the number of
churches aided by them was 534, and the receipts for all purposes were $450,000.
To this should be added about $600,000 raised annually by the State mission
boards for work in their several States, making a grand total of $1,050,000. The

board holds as assets properties and invested gifts amounting to approximately
$3,275,000, most of which is church and mission school property, the remainder
being the invested funds.
The foreign missionary work of the Southern Baptist churches has always
held a prominent place in their church life. The Foreign Mission Board main-
tains work in 17 nations, including China, Japan, Africa, Italy, Mexico, Brazil,
Argentina, Chile, Europe, the Near East, etc. The report for 1936 shows 517
American missionaries, 2,361 native helpers, and 1,715 organized churches with
203,674 members. The educational work of the board was represented by 347
schools with 26,799 students. Of these, 11 were theological institutions, 3 were
colleges, and 4 normal training schools. The board has 24 hospitals and dis-
pensaries. The total number of patients treated during 1936 was 88,599. In-
cluding the hospitals, schools, and 231 buildings owned by the board for purposes
of worship, the total value of the property owned is estimated at $2,750,000;
and the receipts of the board for the year were $1,040,575. There are publishing
houses at El Paso, Tex.; Canton, China; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The result
of the work is apparent in the fact that during the year 14,882 natives were
received into the churches on confession of faith.
The Women's Missionary Union, with headquarters at Birmingham, Ala.,
cooperates with all the boards of the denomination, contributing.largely to their
financial support. These contributions in 1936 amounted to $2,165,787.
In close sympathy with the home mission work is that of the Sunday School
Board, which is both missionary and educational in character. Pecuniary assist-
ance is given by it to the State boards, for the employment of Sunday school
missionaries and instructors, the expense being met from the proceeds of the
business done in the publishing department at Nashville, Tenn. Eleven great
departments of work are carried on by the Sunday School Board, in addition to
14 kinds of cooperative work with the other boards and agencies of the convention.
Besides doing a large book publishing business of its own, this board also maintains
joint ownership of 16 Baptist book stores in as many States of the South. A corps
of trained specialists is maintained who traverse the territory of the convention,
holding normal institutes for training Sunday school teachers and instructing in
efficient methods. Lectureships on Sunday school methods are sustained in the
Louisville Theological Seminary, Louisville, Ky., and the first chair of Sunday
school pedagogy was established by this board in that institution. Free tract
distribution, Bible distribution, and other colportage work are also provided for
by the board. In 1936, this board expended $430,669 in denominational work
and had total cash receipts amounting to $1,745,349.
The educational institutions under the auspices of the Southern Baptists
include 3 theological seminaries, 2 training schools, 29 standard colleges and
universities, 21 junior colleges, and 15 preparatory schools. Of these 70 educa-
tional institutions, the 3 theological schools are under the auspices of the Southern
Baptist Convention; the 2 training schools are fostered by the Woman's Mis-
sionary Union, while all the other schools are directed by the various State con-
ventions. The theological seminary at Louisville, Ky., in 1936 reported 17
professors, 386 male and 90 female students, an endowment of $1,764,000, and
buildings valued at $1,317,200. The Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary
at Fort Worth, Tex., also under the control of the Southern Baptist Convention,
had 13 professors, 339 male and 222 female students, an endowment of $770,446,
and buildings valued at $1,484,980. The women in these iPstitutions are prepar-
ing for missionary and social settlement work. In the 67 colleges, junior colleges,
and preparatory schools there were, in 1936, a total of 1,487 teachers and 24,930
students, of whom 1,652 were students for the ministry.
The denomination maintains 25 hospitals, 2 of which are under the control
of the Southern Baptist Convention, while the others are under the State con-
ventions. These hospitals during the year treated about 77,057 patients. There
are also 19 orphanages and 2 homes for the aged. The value of property of all
these institutions is estimated at $20,000,000.
The number of young people's societies is reported as 33,707, with a member-
ship of 693,186.
The religious journals of the Southern Baptists are represented by 19 weekly,
4 monthly or semimonthly, and 2 quarterly publications.
Beginning the work of caring for the old ministers and their dependents in
1918, the Board of Ministerial Relief was able to report the following in 1936:
Number of ministers cared for, 552; widows cared for, 443; dependent children
cared for, 150; amount expended for relief, $84,942; and amount paid on annuity
claims, $247,530.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The day of darkness.-Although the first African slaves were brought to the
Colonies in 1619, a long span of 154 years passed before we have an account of
the first Negro Baptist Church. This was due to the fact that those who were
the first purchasers of the Africans considered themselves as guardians of these
heathen and hence, on becoming Christians, their numbers were added to the
white churches. In time it became a question whether one Christian should
enslave another. The step between guardianship and master was short and was
soon taken. The results were written into the most inhuman laws ever promul-
gated by a civilized people. Later, there came a time when it was unlawful for
Negroes to become Christians; when it was unla-v~iul to build meeting houses for
them; 150 long and cruel years of enslavement were meted out to these people.
In the meantime, the spirit of abolition, born in the hearts of good men among
the colonists, continued to grow and culminated in the Emancipation Proclama-
tion issued by Abraham Lincoln, September 22, 1862. The proclamation went
into effect January 1, 1863, which gave the emancipated people an opportunity
to serve and worship God without interference.
A new day.-Hardly had the smoke of the Civil War lifted from a hundred
battlefields when sympathetic friendA, men and women, through the American
Baptist Home Missionary Society, the Freedmen's Aid Society, the American
Missionary Association, and kindred organizations, sent preachers and teachers
to the 4,500,000 freedmen in all parts of the Southland.
The chance given through the instructions of those devoted friends, from
pulpit and schoolroom, did much to make American Negroes today the most
advanced group of Negroes in the world. Many of the wisest and best laymen
in the group were and are members of Baptist churches; among these are: W. H.
Williams, historian; Dr~ Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee Institute;
Dr. R. R. Moton, ~rincipal emeritus of T~skegee Institute; Mrs: Mary Talbert,
who saved Anacost1a, the home of Frederick Douglass, as a shrme ·ror the race;
John Mitchell, Jr., the fighting editor; Mrs. Maggie L. Walker, the only woman
banker of the Negro race; Carter G. Woodson, emineht historian; Miss Nannic
H. Burroughs, educator and foundress of the National Trade and Professional
School for Women and Girls; C. C. Spaulding, the insurance wizard; Miss Jennie
Porter, great organizer and teacher; T. C. Windham, contractor and builder;
Dr. A. M. Townsend, financial genius; W. H. Wright, great insurance man and
banker; Dr. John Hope, educator; with scores of other prominent and influential
men and women.
Revival period.-From 1862 to 1890 has fittingly been called the revival period
in the religious life of the Negro people. They organized churches by the thou-
sands, baptized converts by the hundreds of thousands, so that within the brief
interval of 15 years after the emancipation, approximately 1,000,000 former
slaves and their children had been gathered into Baptist churches alone. Since
every member of a Baptist Church must be a baptized believer, having professed
a personal faith in Christ, it will be readily seen that the 3,782,464 Baptists, each
influencing presumably an avera!!;e of 3 persons, have had a tremendous power
over a large percentage of the race group of more than 12,000,000 souls.
The church building period.-From 1882 to 1905 the number of church houses
increased rapidly. In the period from 1862 to 1882 there had been built approxi-
mately 3,000 Baptist church houses costing about $3,000,000. Church houses
were built from 1882 to 1906 at an average rate of 633 yearly, at a cost of $893,178
per year. This meant untold sacrifice from the small wages earned at unskilled
and poorly-paid labor; and besides, expenses were kept up and the pastors'
salaries paid.
The National Baptist Convention.-The first inception of the present National
Baptist Convention was born in Montgomery, Ala.., November 24, 1880, when 59
delegates reported and 9 States were represented. Rev. W. H. McAlpine was
chosen as the first president. The Foreign Mission Baptist Convention of the
United States of America was organized by this body. The American National
Baptist Convention was organized in St. Louis, in 1886; the American National
Educational Baptist Convention was organized in the District of Columbia in
1893. In 1895 all of these bodies united at Atlanta., Ga., and organized the

National Baptist Convention of the United States of America. It was incorpo-
rated in 1915 under the laws of the District of Columbia. They definitely
systematized the work to be carried on by boards selected by the parent body.
The leaders.-The National Baptist Convention has been very fortunate in its
leaders. Such has been the character and temperament of its leaders that it has
not, like the Southern Baptist Convention, been compelled, for harmony, to limit
its presidencr to 2 or 3 years. The body fought it out and has demonstrated a
purer type o democracy than the Southern brethren.
The matter of limiting the tenure of the national officers, however, is being
discussed throughout the denominational ranks; and it is not known how long
before it will have to follow in the footsteps of the white brethren.
But, so far, it has had only three national presidents, each of whom has shown
such high degree of "sanctified wisdom," that there has been no reason to fear the
future.
Dr. E. C. Morris, D. D., LL. D., of Helena, Ark., the first president, who was
elected Seftember 7, 1895, held that office until his death September 5, 1922. He
was one o the most resourceful and eloquent preachers of his day. Rev. W. G.
Parks, D. D., LL. D., of Pennsylvania, who had served 12 years as vice-president-
at-large, succeeded Dr. Morris and served until Dr. L. K. Williams was elected
at St. Louis, 1922. Dr. Parks was a great preacher and much beloved by his
brethren. · Rev. L. K. Williams is a deep thinker and very farsighted. He
speaks eloquently and wisely and has few equals as an organizer, with wonderful
power to win men to the support of a program. His comrades in service feel
inspired by the knowledge that in Dr. Williams they have a leader who is a ca-
pable executive of a forward-looking organization which has life, growth, power,
and possibilities.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine and polity the Negro Baptists are in close accord with the Northern
and Southern Conventions. They represent the more strictly Calvinistic type in
doctrine and in polity, "tell it to the Church," and refer the settlement of any
difficulties that may arise to an ecclesiastical council. Their churches unite in
associations, generally along State lines, for the discussion of topics relating to
church life1 the regulation of difficulties, the collection of statistics, and the pres-
entation ot annual reports. These meetings are consultative and advisory rather
than authoritative.
In addition to the county and district associations there are State conventions
which are held for the consideration of the distinctively missionary side of church
life and not infrequently extend beyond State lines.
The lack of close ecclesiastical relations, characteristic of all Baptist bodiesz
is emphasized in the Negro Baptist churches, with the result that it has been ana
is very difficult to obtain satisfactory statistics of the denomination.
WORK
At the first meeting of the merged bodies making up the National Baptist
Convention in 1895, the general interests and work of the churches were planned
by the election, through the State delegations, of three boards-the Foreign
Mission Board, the Home Mission Board, and the Educational Board. Since that
time the work has expanded until there are now seven boards, or agencies,
engaged in the prosecution of this work, including, in addition to those just men-
tioned-the Woman's Auxiliary Convention, the Sunday School Publishing Board,
the Baptlat Young People'8 Board, and the Baptist Ministers' Benefit Board.
The Lott-Carey Convention, organized 1898, now chartered as the Lott-Carey
Missionary Society, continues its distinctive foreign missionary work.
No accurate or definite statement of activities of the National Baptist Con-
vention of America has been furnished for 1936. The report furnished is for the
National Baptist Convention (incorporated), organized in 1915; its agencies
for propagating its work are modeled in every detail after the National Baptist
Convention of the United States of America.
The Foreign Mission Board, its oldest board, was organized with the convention
November 24, 1880, under the leadership of W. W. Colley. It receives no financial
aid from our white brethren, but is an active member of the Foreign Mission
Conference which meets annually, and the board enjoys the fellowship and useful
information about mission work the world over as do other conference members.
Interest in the work of this board is gripping the churches and members in a
marvelous way. Churches and individual regular givers are increasing yearly.

154 CE!\SUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
In 1792 the bugle call of William Carey in his two great sermons, "Attempt
Great Things for God" and "Expect Great Things from God," so aroused British
Baptists that 12 men with broken hearts and determination to obey God with-
drew from where Carey had sounded to arms and, after prayer in a secret retreat,
pledged themselves to spend and be spent that the non-Christian world might hear
the Gospel. To begin this, they laid on God's altar 13 pounds, 2 shillings, and
6 pence, approximately $66 in United States money. This was not a collection
from churches, but these humble pastors, with hearts bubbling over with joy
for a chance, were sorry they had not done this before. William Carey, during
that year, aided in founding the British Society for the propagation of the Gospel
and in 1793 he went forth as the first foreign missionary from the shores of England.
At that time the doors of the whole non-Christian world were bolted and barred
against the missionary enterprise, but the great God with His own key unlocked
door after door, until today there are very few places on Mother Earth where
the preacher may not go and preach the living Gospel and where converts may
not publicly express their faith in Christ and have the protection of the law.
The outburst of spiritual fervor and the spiritual awakening in Europe by
Carey's trumpet tones reached the Colonies as well. Ten years later a number of
Negroes, freed by the Revolutionary War and like the Apostles, who from fear of
Saul went everywhere preaching the Gospel, for fear of being reenslaved, did not
go everywhere preaching the Gospel; but David George went to Nova Scotia and
thence to Mrica in 1793; George Liele went to the British West Indies in 1783;
and Prince Williams went to the Bahama Islands about 1789. The results of their
sowing are still seen after 160 years.
Just what William Carey did in England in 1792, William Colley did for Negro
Baptists in the United States. He interested them, rallied them, and on November
24, 1880, organized them to preach the Gospel to the millions in benighted Mrica,
which was at that time very dark, indeed. Carey organized British Baptists and
agreed to go down into heathen wells and carry the light of salvation to the perish-
ing millions buried therein, if only the homefolks would "hold the ropes." Colley
organized Negro Baptists and agreed to be their first missionary, sailing Decem-
ber 1883. He Jed a band of five other persons who opened up our Bendoo and
Jundoo mission stations in the Vey country near Grand Cape Mount in Liberia.
Negro Baptists, slow as they may appear, have pushed the conquest of the cross
until in 1937 they have stations beginning with Liberia where our work is being
carried on by some godly women; on to Nigeria, where Rev. Samuel W. Martin
"in His name" goes forward; then to Cape Colony, or South Africa, where a
number of God's noble men-native Zulus, Finges, Galakies, and men of other
tribal distinctions-are nobly contending for the faith; on around to Natal where
E. B. P. Koti, our oldest and one of our best prepared native brethren, holds fort;
and on to Chinde and several hundred miles up the Shier River to Chiradzulu,
manned by Dr. Malekebu.
Foreign mission work is, indeed, the mother of home missions and Christian
education. Only as we share the Gospel with others may we enjoy it in the home-
land. Only as the home fires are kept burning may our churches and schools do
their best wor~.
In 1895 the Foreign Mission Department was domiciled at Louisville, Ky.,
with Rev. John H. Frank, M. D., chairman, and Rev. L. M. Luke, of Marshall,
Tex., secretary. Dr. Luke lived but a few months after his election. On Feb-
ruary 13, 1896, L. G. Jordan, of Philadelphia, Pa., was elected secretary, to
which service he gave nearly 26 years. Following him, in September 1921,
Rev. J. E. East, who had served 11 years as a missionary in South Africa under
the board, was elected and served till his death in October 1932.
The largest sum given for foreign missions in one collection was $4,011 at
Newark, N. J., under Dr. Jordan, and the largest offering ever given in 1 year
was $9,000 during the service of Dr. East.
The Home Mission Board was organized in 1895 and functions in cooperation
with the Southern Baptist Convention. It maintains workers in all of the
Southern States, while the American Baptist Home Mission Society cooperates
in maintaining workers to look after the needs of Negroes in the States of th€-
North, East, and West.
The Board of Education was organized in 1893 by Bishop Johnson, D. D
This board represents the cooperation of the Southern Baptist Convention with
the National Baptist Convention in a way that has not been demonstrated by
any other board. Its chief project is the American Baptist Theological Semi-
nary, Nashville, Tenn., which opened its doors in September 1924. In 1937
DigitiZed by GoogIe
NEGRO BAPTISTS, 155
there were 75 men enrolled as students for the ministry, making this a banner
year. The Board of Education aims to promote a training school for under-
privileged ministers and other religious workers which will meet a great need.
The Sunday School Publishing Board was organized in September 1896 at
St. Louis, Mo., with Rev. R. H. Boyd as secretary. In later years Dr. Boyd
claimed the institution as his own and managed it by a board of seven men.
Dr. Boyd was succeeded by S. P. Harris, a lawyer, at Chicago in 1915. In 1916
at the Savannah, Ga., meeting Mr. Harris was succeeded by Rev. L. G. Jordan,
who, at the request of the National Baptist Convention, declined to remain with
the foreign mission work and was succeeded by Rev. William Haynes, D. D., of
Nashville, Tenn. In 1920 at the Indianapolis, Ind., session, Rev. A. M. Town-
send, M. D., D. D., the present secretary, succeeded Dr. Haynes. Quite the
greatest undertaking by members of the board was the building of the present
home for our Sunday School Publishing Board at Nashville, Tenn. This build-
ing cost more than $750,000, and with the cost of equipment and the value of
the ground on which the building stands, represents an investment of $1,000,000.
It is known as the Morris Memorial Building. The cornerstone was laid Sunday,
May 18, 1924. This gigantic structure represents untold labor and self-sacrifice.
It was dedicated April 25, 1926.
The Woman's Auxiliary Convention was organized in 1900 at Richmond, Va.,
as an auxiliary to the National Baptist Convention. As its name implies, this
body helps in all departments of the National Baptist Convention. They led in
the building and largely support a fine hospital in West Africa.
The National Training School for Women and Girls, the school of the three
B's-Bible, clean lives; bath, clean bodies; broom, clean homes-was organized in
1900 and was authorized by the National Baptist Convention at Cincinnati,
Ohio, September 14, 1901. Its purpose was to stimulate, enlighten, and educate
women and girls in the grace of service and in giving to missions and Christian
education.
The Benefit Board was organized in 1913 for the purpose of creating a fund for
the protection of aged and dependent ministers and other Christian workers of
the denomination, and to maintain a home for the same. It hopes to so direct
its affairs as to be the strongest asset of the denomination.
The Baptist Young People's Union Board, organized in 1899, is an important
factor in the life of the young people of our churches. A great Baptist Young
People's Union and Sunday School Congress, representing over 18,000 Sunday
schools and 557 district conventions, meets yearly. Thousands of delegates and
members representing our 10,000 Baptist Young People's Unions gather.
The Baptist Young People's Union movement grew out of the fact that the
Presbyterians OI'ganized their Christian Endeavors, and the Methodist people
organized their Epworth League, for the purpose of teaching their young people
the distinctive doctrines, history, and missionary plans of their denominations.
The Loyalist Movement, so-called from a suggested motto, "Loyalty to Christ
in all things, at all times," was started in Kansas in 1887 and endorsed by the
Baptist State Convention in 1888. Its purpose, which soon became clear, was to
organize an exclusive society for Baptist young people. The idea was welcomed
in the Middle West, and the Kansas Baptists arranged a young people's program
in their convention in 1889 and invited young people to attend. Nebraska or-
ganized a State convention in 1889 and Iowa in 1890. In Chicago, Ill., there was
a State union formed on August 12, 1890, attended by representatives from 15
States. An executive committee was appointed to study the problem more
closely, and prepare plans for a national convention. There was pronounced
antag~mism to all young people's societies in the churches. Leaders of the Chris-
tian Endeavor movement opposed it heartily. One Congregational pastor sent
out circulars to every Baptist minister asking him to organize a Christian Endeavor
Society in his church. Circulars were sent to Baptist ministers urging them to
oppose it. Representatives of all denominations met in Philadelphia April 22,
1891, and two Baptist trustees of the Christian Endeavor Society attended this
meeting, in which was formed what was known as "the basis of organization."

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY

414
In the records of the early Baptist churches in England there are numerous
references to a discussion on the ~ualifications for church fellowship, especially
in regard to the "laying on of hands, ' included in the list of foundation "principles
of the doctrine of Christ," given in Hebrews VI, 1, 2. The General (Arminian)
Baptists considered it essential, and included it in the ceremony of admission
to the church, immediately after baptism. Many of the Particular (Calvinistic)
Baptists did not so consider it.
With the organization of Baptist churches in America, the same question came
up and agitated the church at Providence, R. I., with the result that a num-
ber of members in 1653 organized what was known as the Old, or General Six
Principle Baptist Church, the six principl~s being those mentioned in the above
passage in the epistle to the Hebrews: Repentance, faith, baptism, laying on
of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. The General Six
Principle Baptists claim that they are the original church, founded by Roger Wil-
liams. Other churches werE! organized on the same basis, and in time confer-
ences were formed in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania.
1 This statement, which Is substantially the sante as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. Arthur C. Lambourne, president, General Six Prlnclvle Baptist
Conference of Rhode Island, Providence, R.I., and approved by him In its present form.

The Pennsylvania Conference has only a few churches remaining, the strength
of the denomination heing now in the Rhode Island Conference. These confer-
ences are members of an international body entitled "The International Old
Baptist Union," which is represented by an international council, consisting of
a bishop of the union, an international secretary, a treasurer, and representatives
elected by the churches in the different countries. This council has authority
to act in all "matters relating to the world-wide union or extension," but the
churches in each country or State manage their own internal affairs without
interference from the international council or from the churches of any other
country or State.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine these churches are in sympathy with the Arminian rather than the
Calvinistic Baptist. Their distinctive feature is still the laying on of hands when
members are received into the church, not, however, as a mere form, but as a
sign of the reception of the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
The general ecclesiastical organization corresponds to that of other Baptist
bodies. The individual church is independent in its management, electing its
own officers and delegates. The conferences, composed of delegates from the
local churches, are especially for purposes of fellowship, but when a question
has been submitted to a conference, or to its executive committee in the interval
between the meetings of the conference, its decision is regarded as final. The
present two conferences, those of Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, interchange
delegates or messengers for mutual counsel. Ordination to the ministry is depend-
ent on approval of a majority of a council comprising the ordained ministers
of a conference, not less than two ordained minister!! officiating.
WORK
There is no organized home missionary work. Whatever home mission work
is done is by each individual church acting independently. Thus is help given to
a "faith work" in Kentucky. There is a foreign missionary society, and some con-
tributions are reported for work in Canada, China, and among the Maoris in New
Zealand. There is alRo a book and tract society, for the purpose of disseminating
the literature issued by the International Union.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
From the earliest periods of the Christian church there have been those who
claimed, in respect to the Sabbath, that Christ simply discarded the false restric-
tions with which the Pharisees had burdened and perverted the Sabbath,.but that
otherwise He preserved it in its full significance. Accordingly, they have held
that loyalty to the law of God and to the ordinances and example of Christ
required continuance of the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath.
Although the Apostolic church and some branches of it in every period since
Christ have observed the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, and practiced
immersion, Seventh Day Baptists do not claim an unbroken succession in the
matter of church organization before the Reformation.
At the time of the Reformation, when the Bible was accepted as the supreme
authority on all questions of faith and conduct, the question of the Sabbath again
came to the front, and a considerable number forsook the observance of Sunday
and accepted the seventh day as the Sabbath.
The date at which the observance of the Sabbath was introduced into Great
Britain is somewhat uncertain. Nicholas Bounde's book, the first book on the
Sabbath question to be published in the English language, appeared in 1595, only
to be suppressed 4 years later. During the next century, numerous other writers
on this subject flourished.
There appears to be evidence that, in all, upwards of 30 Seventh Day Baptist
churches have been established in Great Britain and Ireland. The most im_portant
of these are the Mill Yard, and the Pinner's Hall churches, both of London.
England.
The Seventh Day Baptist Church of Mill Yard, Goodman's Fields, London,
probably had its origin in 1617, and may be said to have been founded by John
Trask and his wife-both school teachers-who were imprisoned for their views
upon the Sabbath. The membership. roll of this church contains, among its
multitude of names, those of the following: Dr. Peter Chamberle~J royal physician
to three kings and queens of England; John James, the martyr; .Nathaniel Bailey,
the compiler of Bailey's Dictionary (upon which Johnson based his famous
dictionary), as well as a prolific editor of classical text books; William Tempest,
F. R. S., barrister and poet; William Henry Blac_!l;., archaeologist; and others.
The Seventh Day Baptist Church of Pinner's .tl.all, Broad Street.t London,
was organized March 5 1676, at his home, by Rev. Francis Bampneld. His
brother, Hon. Thomas Bampfield, Speaker of the House of Commons, under
1 This statemt>nt, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1921!, has been rev!sed by Corliss F. Randolph, president and librarian, Seventh Day Baptist
H~torlcal Society, Plainfield, N.J., and approved by him In Its pre!;ent form.

Richard Cromwell, was also a Seventh Day Baptist; and the four generations of
famous preachers by the name of Stennett, two of whom were Rev. Joseph
Stennett, 2d, D. D., and Rev. Samuel Stennett, D. D.
In 1664 Stephen Mumford, a Seventh Day Baptist, came from London and
settled at Newport, R. I. His observance of the Sabbath soon attracted atten-
tion, and several members of the Newport church adopted his views and practices,
though they did not change their church relation until December 23, 1671 (Old
Style), when they organized the first Seventh Day Baptist Church in America.
At first this church was composed of those of like faith and practice throughout
southern Rhode Island, but in a few years there were groups in various other
parts of the colony, as well as in Massachusetts and Connecticut, who joined the
church. Seventh Day Baptists in Rhode Island were co-laborers with both Roger
Williams and Dr. John Clark in establishing the colony on the principles of civil
and religious liberty. In doing this they suffered imprisonment and other forms
of persecution. They also joined with the Baptists in founding and supporting
Brown University; and when the struggle with the mother country came they were
among the foremost in the colony in the struggle that secured independence and
established the Union.
Some 13 years after the organization of the Newport church, or about 1684,
Abel Noble came to America and settled a few miles distant from Philadelphia.
Subsequently he became a Seventh Day Baptist, through contact with Rev.
William Gillette, M. D., a Seventh Day Baptist clergyman from New England.
Abel Noble presented the claims of the Sabbath to his Keithian Baptist neighbors,
with the result that some half dozen Seventh Day Baptist churches were organ-
ized in and near Philadelphia about the year 1700. Soon after this, or in 1705,
Edmund Dunham, who formerly was a licensed preacher in the Baptist church,
led in organizing a Seventh Day Baptist church in Piscataway, Middlesex County,
N.J.
Under the influence of churches in these three centers (Newport, R. I. Phila-
delphia, Pa., and Piscataway, N.J.), and fostered by them, Seventh Day Baptist
churches have been organized in many parts of the United States, and in China,
India, Java, GermanyLthe Netherlands, Africa, South America, and Jamaica1
British West Indies. There are 10 or more other denominations in the Unitea
States observing the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, all of which have
received their Sabbath teaching from Seventh Day Baptists. Chief among these
communions are the German Seventh Day Baptists, founded at Ephrata, Pa.,
in 1728, and the Seventh Day Adventists, whose organization grew out of the
Millerite movement in the middle of the last century.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine Seventh Day Baptists are evangelical and, except for the Sabbath,
are in harmony with other Baptists, particularly those of the Northern Convention
and Southern Convention. They stand with the Baptists for salvation through
personal faith in Christ, believers' baptism on confession of faith, soul liberty,
civil liberty, independence of the local church with Christ as its sole head, the
Bible in the hands of all men, and the right of everyone to interpret its teachings
for himself. They believe that there are only two sacraments, baptism and the
Lord's Supper, and that the seventh day of the week should be observed as the
Sabbath.
Originally Seventh Day Baptists were restricted communionists and invitations
to the Lord's Supper were given "to members of churches in sister relation";
but gradually this has changed, and by common consent invitations are now gener-
ally given to Christians of all churches. Neither do Seventh Day Baptists
forbid their members to partake of the communion in other churches, the matter
being left to the private judgment of each individual. Church membership is
granted, however, only to those who have been immersed.
Seventh Day Baptists believe that the seventh day of the week should be
observed as the Sabbath, not alone because its observance began with the history
of man, was held sacred by the patriarchs and prophets, and commanded from
Sinai, but primarily because it was observed and held sacred by Christ and the
Apostolic Church. They (Seventh Day Baptists) believe Christ to be the final
sanction for the Sabbath.
'While Seventh Day Baptists for more than 300 years have held firmly to these
doctrines they have always believed Christ would have them be friendly with other
Christians and cooperate with them in every good work. Their pastors have
DigitiZed by GoogIe
SEVENTH DAY BAPTISrrS 165
exchanged with pastors of other denominations, their ministers have ser:ved as
pastors of Baptist churches, in their associations and the General Conferences
they have interchanged delegates, and in more recent years they have belonged
to the National Bible School organizations, the United Society of Christian
Endeavor, the Foreign Missions Conference, the Layman's Missionary Move-
ment, the Federal Council of Churches, the Faith and Order Movement, and other
kindred efforts looking toward united work on the part of Christ's followers.
ORGANIZATION
Since the policy of Seventh Day Baptist churches is that of a pure democracy,
that fact determines the nature of the organizations among them, as well as the
form of the government of the church itself. Each local church is independent
in its own affairs, and all union for denominational work is voluntary. For admin-
istrative purposes chiefly, the churches are organized into associations and a
General Conference, which, however, have only advisory powers. The General
Conference was organized in 1802 and grew out of a yearly meeting established
in 1684. In it each church is entitled to representation by 4 delegates as a church,
and by 2 additional delegates for each 25 members, or fraction thereof, while
members of the 3 leading denominational societies-the Seventh Day Baptist
Missionary Society, American Sabbath Tract Society, and Seventh Day Baptist
Education Society-if present at the conference, are thereby entitled to member-
ship. Churches which cannot be represented by their own members are at liberty
to appoint, as their delegates, members of other churches which are in full and
regular membership in the conference, and the delegate or delegates present from
any church are entitled to cast the full vote to which that church is entitled when
the vote is taken by churches. For the sake of closer fellowship and inspirational
meetings, and for the purpose of interesting the members in the work of Christ's
Kingdom, the churches in the United States are organized into 6 associations.
While these associations have no authority over the churches belonging to them,
respectively, they do determine the qualifications of churches making application
for membership in them.
Applicants for church membership are admitted by vote of the local church,
generally on recommendation by a permanent committee composed of the pastor
and deacons of the church. The local church is the prime authority in the ordi-
nation of elders and deacons; but the ordination of elders, deacons, and all candi-
dates for the ministry is considered of so great importance that it has always been
the custom, when possible to do so, for the church to call a council, composed of
delegates from sister churches, to advise the church regarding the fitness of the
candidate. In recent years, moreover, it has been the practice for the General
Conference, upon the request of a church, to approve its action in the matter of
the ordination of ministers. If the candidate is accepted, this approval gives
him denominational standing and affords protection to other churches.
WORK
The churches carry on their missionary and other activities through boards or
societies. Most of these were organized by the General Conference and report
to it, though by virtue of their charters they are more or less independent of the
Conference. The societies thus organized are the Seventh Day Baptist Missionary
Society, carrying on both home and foreign work; the Seventh Day Baptist
Education Society; the American Sabbath Tract Society, which is the publishing
society of the denomination and the agency through which the work of Sabbath
promotion is carried on; the Woman's Board; the Sabbath School Board; the
Young People's Board; and the Seventh Day Baptist Historical Society.
A missionary spirit has always been characteristic of the denomination. It
found expression at a very early period in the yearly meetings, which were essen-
tially missionary gatherings. As the number of churches grew larger and the
churches became more widely separated, the sending out of missionaries by the
yearly meetings increased. It was chiefly the missionary spirit which, in 1802,
led to the organization of the General Conference for the special purpose of
prosecuting this work more efficiently. For 16 years this general work was
carried on under the direct management of the General Conference. In 1818,
the General Conference, for the purpose of more efficiency in J.>romoting missions,
established a missionary board (sometimes called the missiOnary committee).
Missionary work advanced under the ministration of this board until 1828, when
the General Conference replaced it by creating another missionary board. The
churches were trying to find the best way to promote misPions, and 14 years
DigitiZed by GoogIe
166 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODiffi, 19 3 6
later there were three missionary boards connected with the General Conference,
one of which was a board created for the express purpose of reaching the Jews.
In 1842, the present missionary society was established by the conference and in
due time the duties of the other missionary societies were merged into it. About
this time the work of foreign missions was undertaken. The first foreign mission
to be established permanently was in China, four missionaries going out in 1847.
The work has steadily grown until it has extended to four continents and the isles
of the sea. During all this time the board has fostered the home mission work
of Seventh Day Baptists.
The American Sabbath Tract Society was organized in 1843 for the purpose
of promoting denominational work especially by means of the printed page.
In the year 1872, in addition to the publishing of tracts, it took over the Sabbath
Recorder, the denominational paper, long published under other auspices, and
has served the churches by publishing, not only the Sabbath Recorder, but
Bible school lesson helps, various other periodicals, tracts, and other types of
literature needed by the churches as well.
. From an early date, Seventh Day Baptist churches have been intensely inter-
ested in promoting education. The churches in Rhode Island helped found
Brown University; early in the last century education societies were formed
in some of the churches with the express view of aiding young men preparing for
the ministry; and Seventh Day Baptist churches founded 12 or more academies,
3 of which became colleges. About 100 years ago the churches through the
General Conference established an education committee. Later this was merged
into another education committee or board, and in 1855 the General Conference
formed the present education society. Through this society the churches have
fostered the interests of education, particularly the education of the ministry.
At present there are three institutions of college rank, Alfred University, Alfred,
N.Y., with its college, School of Religious Education, and three technical schools;
Milton College, Milton, Wis.; and Salem College, Salem, W. Va.
One of the efficient organizations in the work of the denomination is the Woman's
Board, organized in 1884. It has been doing excellent service in the fields of
industrial, missionary, educational, and Sabbath promotion activities.
Organized denominational Sabbath school work was begun in 1836, although
Sabbath schools were already in existence in various churches, one at least having
been organized as early as 1740 by the German Seventh Day Baptists at Ephrata,
Pa. Previous to 1872 Sabbath school boards were appointed by the various
associations and carried forward systematic work in this field ·within their respec-
tive boundaries. In that year the General Conference created its denominational
Sabbath school board, which is incorporated and has general charge of the activi-
ties that naturally fall to such an organization, including supervision of Sabbath
school literature.
Much attention has been given to young people's work. The first Young
People's Christian Endeavor societies were formed in 1884, 3 years after the
beginning of the movement under Rev. F. E. Clark, at Portland, Maine.
Prior to the appearance of Christian Endeavor societies, work among young
people had been fostered by the organization of societies called Excel Bands.
This movement in the interest of young people has continued through the years,
and for the last half century it has been directed by a committee or board ap-
pointed by the General Conference.
History is an important phase of the activities of any denomination the same as
it is in the nation. For many years the General Conference promoted this work
for the churches, but in recent years the Seventh Day Baptist Historical Society
has fostered it. This society occupies one floor of the Seventh Day Baptist
Building in Plainfield, N.J., where it has installed a valuable library and museum
relating to the history of Seventh Day Baptists.

FREE WILL BAPTISTS
InSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
175
One f the influential factors in early Baptist history, especially in the Middle
States, was a. Welsh church, organized in Wales in 1701, which emigrated the
same year to Pennsylvania.. Two years later it received a grant of land known
as the "Welsh Tract," where the colony prospered and was able to send anum-
ber of able ministers to various sections. One of these, Elder Paul Palmer,
gathered a company in North Carolina. and, in 1727, organized a church at
Perquimans, in Chowan County. The principal element appears to have been
Ar)ninian, in sympathy with certain communities in Virginia which had received
ministerial assistance from the General Baptists of England. There was no
thought, however, of organizing a separate denomination, the object being
primarily to provide a church home for the community, a place for the adminis-
tration of the ordinances, and for the teaching of Christian ethics.
Under the labors of Elder Palmer and other ministers whom he ordained,
additional churches were organized, which grew rapidly, considering the sparsely
settled country, and an organization was formed, called a yearly meeting, includ-
ing 16 churches, 16 ministers, and probably 1,000 communicants, in 1752. As
the Philadelphia. Association of Calvinistic Baptists increased in strength, a
considerable number of these Arminian churches were won over to that confes-
sion, so that only four remained undivided. These, however, rallied, reorganized,
and, being later reinforced by Free Will Baptists from the North, especially
from Maine, regained most of the lost ground.
In the early part of their history they do not appear to have had a distinctive
name. They were afterward called "Free Will Baptists," and most of them
became known later as "Original Free Will Baptists." They were so listed in
the report on religious bodies, census of 1890, but have since preferred to drop
the term "Original" and be called simply "Free Will Baptists."
In 1836 they were represented by delegates in a General Conference of Free
Will Baptists throughout the United States, but after the Civil War they held
their own conferences. In recent years they have drawn to themselves a. number
of churches of similar faith throughout the Southern States, and have increased
greatly in strength. They hold essentially the same doctrines as the Free
Baptist churches of the North, now a part of the Northern Baptist Convention,
have the same form of ecclesiastical polity, and are to some degree identified
with the same interests, missionary and educational.
As the movement for the union of the Free Baptist churches with the Northern
Baptist Convention developed, some who did not care to join in that movement
affiliated with the Free Will Baptists.
DOCTRINE
The Free Will Baptists accept the five points of Arminianism as opposed to
the five points of Calvinism, and in a confession of faith of 18 articles de-
clare that Christ "freely gave himself a ransom for all, tasting death for every
man"; that "God wants all to come to repentance"; and that "all men, at one
time or another, are found in such capacity as that, through the grace of God,
they may be eternally saved."
Believers' baptism is considered the only true principle, and immersion the only
correct form; but no distinction is made in the invitation to the Lord's Supper,
and Free Will Baptists uniformly practice open communion. They further
believe in foot washing and anointing the sick with oil.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the Free Will Baptists are distinctly congregational. Quarterly con-
ferences for business purposes are held in which all members may participate.
The officers of the church are the pastor, clerk, treasurer, deacons, who have
charge of the preparations for the communion service and care for the poor, and
elders, who care for the spiritual interests of the churches and settle controversies
between brethren. The quarterly conferences are united in State bodies, vari-
ously called conferences or associations, and there is an annual conference repre-
senting the entire denomination.
1 No revision of history, doctrine, or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this state·
mentIs the same as that published In Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926. No data are available for "Work" In
1936.

For some years after the Civil War the lines between the white and colored
Free Will Baptist churches in the Southern States seem not to have been drawn
very sharply. As, however, the latter increased in number and in activity, there
arose among them a desire for a separate organization. Their ministers and
evangelist~ together with others, had gathered a number of churches in North
Carolina, ueorgia, Alabama, and Florida, and had met with such success that in
1901 they were organized as a separate denomination. While ecclesiastically
distinct, these Negro Baptists are in close relation with the white Free Will Baptist
churches of the Southern States, and trace their origin to the early Arminian
Baptist churches of the Carolinas and Virginia and the Free Baptist movement in
New England.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine the United American Free Will Baptists (Colored) are in sub-
stantial agreement with the white churches of the same faith. In polity the local
churches are not as completely autonomous as is the case in the other Free Will
Baptist bodies. The denomination has a system of quarterly, annual, and
general conferences, with a graded authority. Thus, while the local church is
independent so far as concerns its choice of officers, its government, and the
transaction of its business, any doctrinal question which it cannot decide is
taken to the district quarterly conference or to the annual conference. The
district conference has no jurisdiction over the individual members of the local
church, but can labor with the church as a body and exclude it from fellowship.
In the same way the annual conference, sometimes called an "association,"
has authority in matters of doctrine over the district or quarterly conference;
and the general conference has similar jurisdiction over the annual conference.
The general conference has also supervision over the denominational activities
of the church, including missions, education, and Sabbath school work, and
general movements, as those for temperance, moral reform, and Sabbath
observunce.
1 No reylslon of history, dootrfne, or organization was furnished by this body for 19!16, henl-e this statement
i~ the same as that published In Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926. No data are available for "Work" In 1936.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The General, or Arminian, Baptists trace their origin as a distinct denomina-
tion to the early part of the seventeenth century. Their first church is believed
to have been founded in Holland in 1607 or 1610 and their first church in England
in 1611. During the latter half of the seventeenth and the first half of the
eighteenth eenturiennany of the Baptist churches in New England held Arminian
views, and early in the eighteenth century there were also a number of General
Baptists in Virginia. These sent a request for ministerial aid to the General
Baptists of London, in answer to which Robert Nordin was sent to Virginia in
1714. Nordin is supposed after his anival to have organized at Burleigh the
first Baptist church in Virginia, although it is possible that he found it already

established. Later other Baptist churches were organized, and the movement
spread into North Carolina, where a flourishing yearly meeting was formed, and
to other colonies of the South.
As the Calvinistic Baptists, who had better educated and more aggressive
leaders, increased in numbers and strength, the majority of the Arminian Baptist
churches, both in New England and the South, became affiliated with them,
although the General Six Principle Baptists of New England and a small body of
churches in the Carolinas continued to hold the doctrines of the General Baptists.
Later the Free Baptists of New England, who held essentially the same principles,
attracted many who would otherwise have formed General Baptist churches.
The small group of General Baptist churches in the Carolinas, being reinforced
by Free Baptists from the North, in time became known as Free Will Baptists,
and included most of those holding Arminian views in that section of the country.
The historical origin of those Baptist bodies in the United States that bear
the appellation "General Baptists" at the present time is somewhat uncertain,
but it seems probable that they represent colonies sent to the Cumberland region
by the early General Baptist churches of North Carolina. The first very definite
information concerning them is that in 1823 a General Baptist church was organ-
ized in Vanderburg County, Ind., by Benoni Stinson and others. The following
year Liberty Association was organized with four churches. The movement
gradually extended to Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, and
Nebraska. More recently churches have been established in Oklahoma, Cali-
fornia, and Michigan.
Two distinct influences appeared early in these churches, one for greater
denominational emphasis, the other for union with other Baptist bodies, such as
the Free Will and the Separate Baptists. Various efforts for such union were
put forth, but without conspicuous success. One association united with the
Free Will Baptists in 1868, but withdrew in 1877. In 1881 two associations had
a conference with an association of Missionary Baptists, as they were called,
to distinguish them from Antimissionary or Primitive Baptists, but it failed to
produce results. More recently a union with a Separate Baptist association
caused some disturbance, but this also was not permanent. Notwithstanding
the hindrances attending these discussions, the denomination has made progress,
establishing churches and organizing missionary societies and Sunday schools.
In 1915 the General Association of General Baptists formed a cooperative union
with the Northern Baptist Convention.
DOCTRINE
The confession of faith of the General Baptists consists of 11 arti<'les which,
with but two slight changes, are identical with those formulated by Benoni
Stinson in 1823. The distinctive feature of this confession is the doctrine of a
general atonement (whence the name, "General Baptist"), which is that Christ
died for all men, not merely for the elect, and that any failure of salvation rests
purely with the individual. Other clauses state that man is "fallen and de-
praved," and cannot extricate himself from this state by any ability possessed
by nature; that except in the case of infants and idiots, regeneration is necessary
for salvation, and is secured only through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ;
that while the Christian who endures to the end shall be saved, it is possible for
him to fall from grace and be lost; that rewards and punishments are eternal;
that the bodies of the just and unjust will be raised, the former to the resurrection
of life, the latter to the resurrection of damnation; that the only proper mode of
baptism is immersion, and the only proper subjects are believers; and that the
communion, or Lord's Supper, should be free to all believers. Some of the
churches practice foot washing.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the General Baptists are in accord with other Baptist bodies. The
local churches are independent, but are united in local, State, and general asso-
ciations, of advisory character, with no authority over the individual church.
No association can legally form an organic union with any other denomination
without the ratification of each individual church, and any local church wishing
to withdraw from any association may do so, while any local association may
withdraw from a State or General Association.

GENERAL llA'PTISTS 187
When a church desires the ordination of one of its members, it makes recom-
mendation to a .body composed of the ordained ministers and deacons of the
various local churches, corresponding closely to the councils of Congregational
churches, though sometimes called a presbytery. This body conducts an ex-
amination of the candidate and if he is found worthy, ordains him, acting as
the representative of the church. It has, however, no authority except such
as is given to it by the local church. The vote of the local church on the recep-
tion of members must be unanimous.
In 1870 a General Association was organized to bring "into more intimate and
fraternal relation and effective cooperation various bodies of liberal Baptists."
With this most of the local associations are connected through delegates. While
this General Association is a General Baptist institution, its constitution permits
the reception of other Baptist associations whose doctrines and usages harmonize
with those of the General Baptists. The constitution states that the name can
never be changed, and that no less than three-fourths of its trustees shall be
members of General Baptist churches. It has general supervision over the
college and educational interests of the denomination, the home and foreign
mission work, publication interests, literature, etc. A denominational budget
of $6,000 is called for each year, which is divided among the denominational
enterprises.
A home mission board is maintained under the direction of the general asso-
ciation, its object being to support home missionaries, establish churches in new
fields, assist in building houses of worship, etc. There are 37 local associations,
and a total membership of 38,000. The various local associations also have
boards which do similar work within their own territory, and which cooperate
with the general board. The home mission board of the Liberty Association of
Indiana has a permanent fund of several thousand dollars, and has been the
means of advancing the interests of the association and of the denomination as
much perhaps as any other one a~ency. Largely through its efforts the present
publishing house of the denomination was established.
For many years the General Baptists cooperated with the Free Baptists in
foreign mission work, but, since this was found to be not entirely satisfactory,
a foreign missionary society was organized in 1904, under direction and control
of the General Association.
Through the foreign mission board work is now being carried on in the island
of Guam, where in 1936 there were several stations, occupied by a native mission-
ary and several native helpers. There are about 75 members. The value of
property belonging to the denomination in foreign fields is estimated at $10,000,
and there is an endowment of $3,500.
The General Baptists have one educational institution, Oakland City College,
in Indiana, which includes a theological department. It has a faculty of 15
teachers and an average attendance of about 250 students, property valued at
$100,000, and an endowment of about $250,000. The amount contributed for
the support of the school during the year was about $20,000.
The General Baptist Messenger, the church organ, was established in 1886,
and has assisted lar~ely in building up and strengthening the denomination and
its institutions. It IS now published at Poplar Bluff, Mo.
Sunday schools, women's missionary and aid societies, and Christian Endeavor
societies are maintained in many of the churches.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The term "Separate," as applied to church bodies, had its origin in what is
known as the Separatist Movement in England toward the close of the six-
teenth century and early in the seventeenth century. It indicated primarily a
withdrawing from the Anglican Church, without implying any specific doctrinal
or ecclesiastical character. Among the churches which thus withdrew were
some distinctively Baptist churches, though the first definite date appears to be
that of 1662, when a church called the "English Puritan Separate Baptist Church"
is said to have been organized. This, in common with some of the other inde-
pendent churches, was compelled to emigrate to the colonies and came to America
in 1695.
• This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Repol1 on Religious
Bodies, 19211, bas been revised b;r Rev. J. 8. Banta, ortbe Separata Baptists, Grab, Ky., and approvod by
him In Its pre&eDt form.

· In the early part of the eighteenth century a somewhat similar condition ex-
isted in New England. The revival movement in which Whitefield took so
prominent a part, and which culminated in the Great Awakening, caused sharp
discussion. Those who endorsed the revival were called "New Lights," and were
opposed bitterly on two specific points; one was the use of lay preachers, and the
other the refusal to retain on church rolls those who were regarded by them as
unregenerate because they had not experienced conversion. Denominational
lines were not drawn, both the Congregational and Presbyterian churches, the
latter under the lead of the Tennents, sharing in the controversy, which resulted
in the withdrawal or "separation" -Of a number of churches. In all of these
"separate" churches there were Baptists, and of 31 ministers ordained as pas-
tors from 1746 to 1751, there were 5 Baptists before they were ordained and 8
became Baptists, among the latter being Isaac Backus; the famous Baptist theolo-
gian and historian. These Separate Baptist churches were distinguished from the
Regular Baptist churches by their milder Calvinism and their willingness to re-
ceive those who practiced infant baptism, even though they themselves preferred
the form of immersion. As a result the Regular Baptists refused to recognize
them, and for some time there was more or less hostility between the two branches.
This, however, gradually disappeared, and in New England the two bodies
coalesced, though there was never any formal act of union.
.Among the more prominent leaders of the Separate Baptists was Shubael
Stearns, a native of Boston, who was baptized and ordained in Tolland, Conn.
In 1754 he left New England and settled at Sandy Creek, now Randolph County,
N. C., where he made his permanent residence. With him had come 8 families,
16 persons in all, and there the same year he organized the first Separate Bap-
tist church in the South. Before long it contained 606 members, and Darnel
Marshall, Samuel Harris, and others soon became influential coworkers with Mr.
Stearns. In 17 years the southern Separate Baptists had spread westward to
the Mississippi, southward to Georgia, and eastward to the sea, and had 125
ministers and 42 churches. Their first association, the Sandy Creek, was organ-
ized at Stearns Church in January 1758. As early as 1776 they were found in
Kentucky, and in 1785 organized the South Kentucky Association, which is etill
in existence. In 1815 they crossed into Indiana Territory, established a church
on Indian Creek, and in 1830 organized the Sand Creek Association. The first
association in Illinois, the Shelby, was organized in 1845, and the Ambraw, one
of their strongest associations, was formed in 1869. At present they are found in
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.
In 1787 the Regular and Separate Baptists in Virginia formed a union, adopt-
ing the name "United Baptist Churches of Christ in Virginia." In course of time
similar unions were formed in most of the other States in which the southern
branch of the Separate Baptists had organizations. A few Separate Baptist
churches, however, refused to join in this movement, and have maintained dis-
tinct organizations until the present time. Owing largely to difficulty of com-
municMion, some practically kindred associations, such as the Duck River
Association and others of similar character, have not identified themselves with
the distinctive Separate Baptist body. Individual members of these associations
have expressed their willingness to be classed with the Separate Baptists, but
no official action in that direction has been taken.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
Separate Baptists reject all creeds and confessions of faith, but the various
associations publish, in the minutes of their yearly meetings, articles of belief.
These are not always worded exactly alike, but in the main are in substantial
agreement. The declaration of the General Association, which may be taken as
an illustration, emphasizes the Scriptures as the infallible Word of God, the only
safe rule of faith and practice; the existence of three divine personages in the
Godhead; and three ordinances-baptism, the Lord's Supper, and feet washing.
The immersion of believers is considered the only proper mode of baptism.
They hold that regeneration, justification, and sanctification take place through
faith in the life, death, resurrection, ascension, and intercession of Christ; that
both the just and unjust will have part in the resurrection, and that God has
appointed a day in which He will judge the world by Jesus Christ.
The strict Calvinistic doctrines of election, reprobation, and fatality have never
been accepted by the Separate Baptist churches, the special points of emphasis
in their preaching being the general atonement of Jesus Christ and the freedom of

salvation for all who will come to Him on the terms laid down in His Word. In
the statements of some associations the doctrines of "adoption by the Spirit of
God" and the "perseverance of the saints" are included. The Lord's Supper
is observed in the evening and is regarded, not as a church table, but the Lord's
table. Each one who partakes is expected to follow the scriptural rule, "Let a
man examine himself, and so Jet him eat of that bread and drink of that cup."
In polity the Separate Baptists are thoroughly congregational, recognizing the
autonomy of the local church, the purely advisory character of the association,
and the rights of the individual Christian.
WORK
In the line of home missionary work each association, independent of any other,
conducts its own work, but the amount of money expended for this object is not
reported. No provision has as yet been made for foreign missionary work.
Although the denomination has no established institution of learning, educa-
tion is firmly believed in. Sunday schools are very generally maintained through-
out the different associations and are usually prosperous.
The denominational paper, The Messenger, is published at Kokomo, Ind.

State tables.-Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the Regular Bap-
tists by States. Table 3 gives for each State for 1936 the number and membership
of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural territory,
membership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools. Table 4 gives for
selected States the number and membership of the churches for the three census
years 1916 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under 13
years of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the value of churches
and parsonages and the amount of debt on church edifices for 1936. Table 6 pre-
sents, for 1936, the church expenditures, showing separately current expenses, im-
provements, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statis-
tics of any individual church, separate presentation in table 5 is limited to those
States in which three or more churches reported the value of edifices.

REGULAR BAPTISTS
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
199
Under this head are included a number of associations of Baptists who claim
to represent the original English Baptists before the distinction between Cal-
vinistic or Particular and Arminian or General became prominent. They are
thus distinguished from the Primitive Baptists, representing the extreme of
Calvinism, and the General, Free Will, and other Baptists, inclining more to the
Arminian doctrine; but are in general sympathy with the United Ba]ltists and
Duck River and Kindred Associations of Baptists. Some use the term 'Regular"
alone, and some the term "Regular Primitive," but so far as reported all are
included under the one head of "Regular." They are to be found chiefly in
North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and the adjoining States.
The question has arisen as to the consolidation of these three groups, but as yet
no definite action has been taken.~
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine the Re~ular Baptists are essentially at one with the United Baptists
and hold that God gtves no command but what he holds all men responsible for
complying therewith, compliance always being by enabling grace; and by such
enabling grace man may comply with the conditions necessary to salvation; that
man as a result of sin is completely depraved, having neither will nor power to
extricate himself from his state of death in sin and his salvation is purely or
entirely by grace as a result of God's mercy and love; since Christ was offered an
infinite sacrifice for sin, on the basis of this sacrifice the gospel of God's grace is
to be preached to all men, the lost being lost because of their unbelief.
The different confessions of faith adopted by other Baptists, such as the London
Confession, the Philadelphia Confession, and the New Hampshire Confession are
not in use. Each association bas its own confession and there will be found in
numerous cases some slight difference, particularly in the case of the Ketocton
and Indian Creek Associations, including churches in northern Virginia and West
Virginia, and Big Harpetb Church in Tennessee, where the doctrine is found to
be rather more Calvinistic, and more nearly in harmony with that of the Primitive
Baptist group. There is, however, such general correspondence as to permit the
classification of these associations together. They are strict in admission to the
Lord's Supper, practicing close communion, and for the most part observing the
ceremony of feet washing.
In polity the Regular Baptists are distinctly congregational. The churches
meet for fellowship in associations and frequently send messengers to other
associations, but there is no organic union between the different associations and
the lists of churches not infrequently vary from year to year.
• This statement, wblch Is substautlally the same as th(lt published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, hes been revised by E . A. Wllllams, or the Regular Baptists, Whitestown, Ind., and approved
by blm In lte present form.
• Use of the term "Regular" hes varied at different times. In the report of churches for 1890 It was ap-
pUed to the great body of Baptists Included In the Northam, Southern, and National Conventi0Il8. Thilt
use, however, hes dropped out and at present the term seems to be limited to the churches described above.
But someorganizations of Baptists In Tennesseeand adjoining States, listed under the head of Dock River
and Ktndred Associations of Baptists, are In fact the same kind of Baptists as the Regular Baptists and
might properly have been Included as a part of this group.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
With the immigration of Baptists from the New England and Middle States
into Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and the more intimate
fellowship that grew up in those isolated communities, the distinction between the
different Baptist bodies, Calvinistic or Particular, and Arminian or General,
became in many cases less marked, and a tendency toward union was apparent.
In Virginia and the Carolinas, J?articularly, and also in Kentucky, during the
latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth centuries, a con-
siderable number of the Separate Baptists and those who were known as "Regu-
lar Baptists," claiming to represent the original English Baptists before the dis-
tinction between Particular and General became prominent, combined under the
name of "United Baptists." The Separate Baptists emphasized less strongly
the Arminian characteristics of their belief, while the Regular Baptists were
more ready to allow special customs, particularly foot washing, wherever they
were desired. This movement, which took definite form in Richmond, Va., in
1794 and in Kentucky in 1804, for a time gained strength and the associations
kept their identity; but gradually, as they came into closer relations with the
larger Baptist bodies of the North and South, many United Baptist churches
ceased to be distinct and became enrolled with other Baptist bodies.
1Thill statement which Is the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on ReHgio118 Bodlea 182«1,
has been approved In lte present form by Elder Aaron Stepp, moderator of the 7.1on .Aasoelat1on, Un'ted
Baptista. Inee. lty.
DigitiZed by Goo§Ie
206 CENSUS' OF RELIGIOUS BODIF.JS, 1936
Of late years there has developed considerable fellowship with associations still
using the name "Regular " and with those listed in the census report as the
"Duck River and Kindred Associations of Baptists," and there has been talk of
a consolidation of these different associations. As yet no definite steps to this
end have been taken.
The name "United Baptist" still appears on the minutes of many associations
whose churches are enrolled with the Baptists of the Northern Convention or
the Southern Convention, chiefly with the latter, but there are some which retain
their distinctive position. In many cases, even where they are not on the rolls
of the Southern Baptist Convention, they are still in intimate relations with its
churches, attend the same meetings, and are identified with them in many ways.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine the United Baptists hold that salvation is all of grace and in no
sense of works; yet that it is conditional upon performance of the requirements
of the Gospel which, they claim, is to be preached to all men; and, as all men
are commanded to repent, it necessarily follows that all men are given ability
to repent, being led to repentance by the goodness of God, or, on the other hand,
being led to rebellion and resistance by the devices of Satan; but that, in either
case, it is as the individual inclines the ear and heart, or yields himself to obey.
They observe the ceremony of foot washing, and are strict in their practice of
close communion. In polity they are strictly congregational. ·

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
Baptist principles quite early gained a strong foothold in the mountainous
sections of Tennessee, many of the early settlers being Baptists from the older
States, led by Elder George Foster from Kentucky, and others. Five churches
were organized in 1807, and these came together in 1808 and organized the Elk
River Association, one of the oldest associations in middle Tennessee.
This association was strongly Calvinistic in doctrine. There grew up an ele-
ment within it, however1 which was more liberal in its belief in the atonement and
the plan of salvation. As this element increased, the opposite party became even
stricter in its theology and practice. These differences became so great that in
I Tblsstatement, which Is the same as that published in v<>l. IIorthe Reporton Religious Bodies, 1926,bas
been approved In Its present form by S. F. Shelton,clerk, Duck River and Kindred Associationso! Baptists,
Christiana, Tenn.

DUCK RIVER AND KINDRED ASSOCIATIONS 211
1825 the liberal minority withdrew from the association and organized the Duck
River Association. On account of this division, they were for a ti~e called the
"Separate Baptists," although they did not actually identify themselves with that
body. With the increase in churches, other associations have been organized,
principally in Tennessee and Alabama, which have regular affiliation with each
other.
Later discussion arose as to the legitimacy of missionary operations as then
conducted, missionary contributions being compulsory on the part of the churches;
there came another division, some withdrawing and identifying themselves with
the churches which became known as the Missionary Baptists, but leaving the
others still more closely bound together.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine, the Duck River and its kindred associations are Calvinistic
though liberal, believing that "Christ tasted death for every man" and made it
possible for God to have mercy upon all who come unto Him on Gosgel terms.
They believe that sinners are justified by faith; that the saints will persevere
in grace," and that baptism of believers by immersion, the Lord's Supper, and the
washing of the saints feet are Gospel institutions and should be observed until
the second coming of Christ. While acknowledging the similarity of their doctrinal
position to that of the Separate Baptists, they have not as yet seen their way
clear to form a union with them, although an increasing sentiment appears to
exist among the churches in favor of such union. Similar discussion has arisen
with regard to the United and Regular Baptists, but no action has been taken.
ORGANIZATION
In polity they are in accord with other Baptists, believing that no one member
has a ruling voice over another. All business is transacted by a majority vote,
no one person being given any ecclesiastical power over a church or churches.
Admission to the church is by examination and vote of the church1 and ordina-
tion to the ministry is by two or more ordained ministers, the candiaate being ex-
pected to demonstrate his consciousness of a divine call to preach the gospel. The
minister has no ri~ht to dem&nd a stated salary, but the local church is expected
to give liberally, 'that they which preach the gospel [may) live of the gospel"
The association meetings are purely for purposes of fellowship, and communi-
cation with kindred bodies is by messenger or letter. The only form of discipline
is withdrawal of fellowship, on evidence of difference of views or of conduct
unbecoming a member of the church.
WORK
While not reprdilented by any distinctive missionary societies or benevolent
organizations, this body is not to be classed with antimissionary churches. Since
it occupies mountainous sections chiefly and represents the less wealthy com-
munities. the missionary spirit finds expression m local evangelistic work. As
it comes in contact more and more with other churches its sense of fellowship has
broadened1 and with this has been apparent a desire to share in the wider work of
the generat church.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
With the development of organized church life shown in the formation of be-
nevolent and particularly of missionary societies, of Sunday schools and similar
organizations, during the early part of the nineteenth century, there developed
also considerable opposition to such new ideas. The more independent church
associations were based on the principle that the Scriptures are the sole and
sufficient authority for everything connected with the religious life. The posi-
tion taken was, in brief, that there were no missionary societies in the apostles'
days, and therefore there should be none today. Apart from this, however,
there seemed to many to be inherent in these societies a centralization of author-
ity which was not at all in accord with the spirit of the gospel. Sunday schools
also were considered unauthorized of God, as was everything connected with
church life that was not included in the clearly presented statement of the New
Testament writers. These views appeared particularly in some of the Baptist
bodies, and occasioned what became known as the "antimission movement."
Apparently the first definite announcement of this position was made by the
Kehukee Baptist Association of North Carolina, formed in 1765, at its meeting
with the Kehukee Church in Halifax County in 1827, although similar views
were expressed by a Georgia association in 1826. The Kehukee Association
unanimously condemned all "modern, money-based, so-called benevolent socie-
ties," as contrary to the teaching and practice of Christ and His apostles, and,
furthermore, announced that it could no longer fellowship with churches which
indorsed such societies. In 1832 a similar course was adopted by the Country
Line Association, at its session with Deep Creek Church in Alamance (then
Orange) County, N. C., and by a "Convention of the Middle States" at Black
Rock Church, Baltimore County, Md. Other Baptist associations in the North,
South, East, and West, during the next 10 years, took similar action. In 1835
the Chemung Association, including churches in New York and Pennsylvania,
adopted a resolution declaring that as a number of associations with which it
had been in correspondence had "departed from the simplicity of the doctrine
and practice of the gospel of Christ, * * * uniting themselves with the
world and what are falsely called benevolent societies founded upon a money
basis," and preaching a gospel "differing from the gospel of Christ," it would
not continue in fellowship with them, and urged all Baptists who could not
approve the new ideas to come out and be separate from those holding them.
The various Primitive Baptist associations have never organized as a denom-
ination and have no State conventions or general bodies of any kind. For the
purpose of self-interpretation, each association adopted the custom of printing
in its annual minutes a statement of its articles of faith, constitution, and rules of
order. This presentation was examined carefully by every other association,
and, if it was approved, fellowship was accorded by sending to its meetings
messengers or letters reporting on the general state of the churches. Any asso-
ciation that did not meet with approval was simply dropped from fellowship.
The result was that, while there are certain links binding the different associa-
tions together, they are easily broken, and the lack of any central body or even
of any uniform statement of belief, serves to prevent united action. Another
factor in the situation has been the difficulty of intercommunication in many
parts of the South. As groups of associations developed in North and South
Carolina and Georgia, they drew together, as did those in western Tennessee,
northern Mississippi and Alabama, and Missouri, while those in Texas had little
intercourse with any of the others. Occasional fraternal visits were made through
all of these sections, and a quasi union or fellowship was kept up, but this has
not been sufficient to secure what might be called denominational individuality
or ~owth. This is apparent in the variety of names, some friendly and some
dertsive, which have been applied to them, such as "Primitive," "Old School,"
"Regular," "Antimission," and "Hard Shell." In general, the term "Primitive"
has been the one most widely used and accepted.
DOCTRINE
In matters of doctrine the Primitive Baptists are strongly Calvinistic. Some
of their minutes have 11 articles of faith, some less, some more. They declare
that by Adam's fall or transgression all his posterity became sinners in the sight
I Thla statement, which Is the same as that published In vol. II or the Report on Religious Bodies, 1926,
bas been approved In Its present form by Elder 0. H. Cayce, or the Primitive Baptists, Thornton, Ark.

PRIMITIVE BAPTISrrs 225
of God; that the corruption of human nature is total; that man cannot, by his
own free will and ability, reinstate himself in the favor of God; that God elected
or chose His people in Christ before the foundation of the world; that sinners
are justified only by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them; that the saints
will all be preserved and will persevere in grace unto heavenly glory, and that
not one of them will be finally lost; that baptism and the Lord's Supper are
ordinances of the gospel in the church to the end of time; that the institutions
of the day (church societies) are the inventions of men, and are not to be fel-
lowshiped; that Christ will come a second time, in person or bodily presence to
the world, and will raise all the dead, judge the human race, send the wicked to
everlasting punishment, and welcome the righteous to everlasting happiness.
They also hold uncompromisingly to the full verbal inspiration of the Old and
New Testament Scriptures.
Some Primitive Baptists maintain, as formulated in the London Baptist Con-
fession of Faith of 1689, that God eternally decreed or predestinated all things, yet
in such a manner that He does not compel anyone to sin, and that He does not
approve or fellowship sin. The great majority of them, however, maintain that,
while God foreknew all things, and while He foreordained to suffer, or not prevent
sin, His active and efficient predestination is limited to the eternal salvation of
all His people, and everything necessary thereunto; and all Primitive Baptists
believe that every sane human being is accountable for all his thoughts, words,
and actions.
Immersion of believers is the only form of baptism which they acknowledge,
and they insist that this is a prerequisite to the Lord's Supper. They hold that
no minister has any right to administer the ordinances unless he has been called
of God, come under the laying on of hands by a presbytery, and is in fellowship
with the church of which he is a member; and that he has no right to permit
any clergyman who has not these qualifications to assist in the administering of
these ordinances. In some sections the Primitive Baptists believe that washing
the saints' feet should be practiced in the church, usually in connection with the
ordinance of the Lord's Supper. Of late years a group of churches in Georgia
have used organs in public worship, but most of the churches are earnestly
opposed to the use of instrumental music of any kind in church services. Sunday
schools and secret societies are unauthorized. These are claimed not to be iu
accordance with the teachings of the Bible.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the Primitive Baptists are congregational in that they believe that
each church should govern itself according to the laws of Christ as found in the
New Testament, and that no minister, association, or convention has any author-
ity. They believe that if, in the view of its sister churches, a church departs in
doctrine or order from the New Testament standard, it should be labored with,
and if it cannot be reclaimed, fellowship should be withdrawn from it. Admission
to the church takes place after careful examination by the pastor and church
officers, and by vote of the church. Ministers are ordained by the laying on of
the hands of pastors and elders called by the church of which the candidate is a
member. No theological training is required. The gifts of the candidate are
first tested by association with pastors in evangelistic work, and he is then
recommended for ordination. There is no opposition to education, the position
being that the Lord is able to call an educated man to preach His gospel when
it is His will to do so, and that it is the duty of the minister to study, and especially
to study the Scriptures, but they hold that lack of literary attainments does not
prevent one whom the Lord has called from being able to preach the gospel.
WORK
Notwithstanding the strong opposition to missionary societies, the Primitive
Baptists are by no means opposed to evangelistic effort, and preachers, both
regular pastors and others who are in a position to do so, travel much and preach
the gospel without charge, going where they feel that the Spirit of God leads
them, and where the way is opened in His providence. The members and friends
whom they freely serve, freely contribute to their support. Although opposed
to Sunday schools, they believe in giving their children religious training and
instruction.

St&te te.bles.-Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the Colored Primi-
tive Baptists by States. Table 3 gives for each State for 1936 the number and
membership of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural
territory, membership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools. Table 4
gives for selected States the number and membership of the churches for the four
census years 1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as
"under 13 years of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the
value of churches and parsonages and the amount of debt on church edifices
for 1936. Table 6 presents, for 1936, the church expenditures, showing separately
current expenses, improvements, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing

COLORED PRIMITIVE BAPTISTS
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
233
The history of the Colored Primitive Baptists is the same as that of the white
Primitive Baptists up to the time of the Civil War. During slave times the
colored Primitive Baptists had full membership in the white churches, although
seats were arranged for them in a separate part of the house. Before the war
some of the colored members of the churches were engaged in the work of the
ministry, many of them being considered very able defenders and exponents of
the doctrine of the Bible. Such men were sometimes bought from their owners
and set free to go out and preach where they felt it was the Lord's will for them
to go.
After the Negroes were freed, many of them desiring to be set apart into
churches of their own, the white Primitive Baptists granted them letters certify-
ing that they were in full fellowship and good standing; white preachers organized
them into separate churches, ordained their preachers and deacons, and set
them up in proper order, throughout the South; and thus, gradually, the colored
Primitive Baptists became a separate denomination.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The doctrinal principles and the polity of the Colored Primitive Baptists are
precisely the same as those of the white Primitive Baptists. Each local church
is an independent body and has control of its own affairs, receiving and dis-
ciplining its own members; there is no appeal to a higher court.
About the year 1900 a "progressive" move was introduced among the Colored
Primitive Baptists, and a large number of them began the organization of aid
societies, conventions, and Sunday schools, some of these organizations being
based on the payment of money-things which the Primitive Baptists have not
engaged in and which they have always protested against.
' No revlslou of blstory, doctrlue, or orgaDizatlon was furnished by tbls body for 1936, hence this state.
meut Is the same as that published In Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926. No data are available for " Work"

lfiSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists arose, as a distinct body
in America, in the second half of the eighteenth century, by a protest of the more
rigid against what some considered a general laxity of doctrine and looseness of
church discipline consequent upon the prevalence of Arminian doctrines as set
forth by Methodism. Its great leader was Elder Daniel Parker, a native of
Virginia, who was ordained in Tennessee in 1806 and labored in that State and
in Illinois and Texas.
This doctrine was not allowed to be taught during the dark ages. There were
a few men who contended for it; one leader by the name of Donatist who lived
250 years after Christ was here on earth in visible form; and later Peter Waldo,
the founder of the Waldenses, of medieval times. The theory of the Two-Seed
as a principle of doctrine has existed since apostolic times and farther back. The
first fountain head that broke out was back in the Garden of Eden when God
said: "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and
her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen. 3: 15.
After the Reformation the leaders of this doctrine had more liberty and freedom
to preach and teach the doctrine of Two-Seed.
The denomination at present does not emphasize the extreme Calvinistic
doctrines which they stressed in its early history, when these Baptists formed
scattered churches rather than an organized denomination. They differed from
the Primitive Baptists chiefly in the degree to which they carried their theological
opinions and ecclesiastical principles and were frequently called by the same
names, "Primitive," "Old School," and "Hard Shell"; the special feature of
their belief was gradually recognized, however, and they became popularly known
as the "Two-Seed Baptists." As a result of this general similarity, the distinction
between them and the Primitive Baptists has not always been clearly drawn and
this fact probably accounts to some extent for their decreasing numbers at suc-
cessive censuses.
As distinguished from the Primitive Baptists, the Two-Seed Baptists believe
in the resurrection of the Body of Christ, which is the Church, and that the two
seed are in the spirit and not in the flesh. They emphasize the doctrine of salva-
tion by grace. They believe that God's people are a spiritual generation and
they did exist in Christ before the world was: Eph. 1: 4, "According as he hath
chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy with-
out blame before him in love": Eph. 1: 7, "In whom we have redemption through
his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace." Again
we find in II Tim. 1:9-10, "Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling,
not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which
was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest
by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath
brought.life and immortality to light through the gospel": Prov. 8: 22-25, "The
Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was
set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there
were no depths, I was brought forth: when there were no fountains abounding
with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought
forth." Therefore we emphasize the doctrine of salvation by grace and not by
works: Eph. 2: 8-9, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast."
We believe that the ordinances such as communion and foot washing are taught
in the Bible and are to be observed in the visible church. We do not believe
that the work of a paid ministry is necessary to save sinners, as Christ came to
save sinners and He said He finished His work.
DOCTRINE
The phrase "Two-Seed" indicates one seed of good and one of evil, both of
them spiritual and not of the flesh, the good seed emanating from God, and the
evil seed from the devil; the earthly generation of mankind is the field in which
t Thiastatement, which dilfers iOmewhatfrom that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious Bodies,
19211, hasbeen revlaed by Elder B. R. IJttle, McMinnville, Tenn., and approved by him In Its present form.
238 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
both are manifested, the field, however, being no part of either. The field has
no power of its own to resist, but must and does develop or manifest what is sown
in it, 88 shown in the parable of the wheat and the tares. Neither seed can change
its character, but must reproduce after its kind. We do not divide the Adamic
race, nor can we change the decrees of God; but as He declared the origin and the
destiny of the parent or progenitor in the beginning, we claim that, as He cannot
change, neither does He change either the origin or destiny of any one of His
generation. This is manifested through the visible generations of Adam. Thus,
it is the crop which is gathered and not the field, the atonement being for the
redemption of the good seed, which are the children of God. Divine justice being
satisfied, then wisdom is justified of all her children which are the good seed;
the children of God return to Him in heaven and the children of the devil are
returned back to him in the lower regions of eternity.
ORGANIZATION AND WORK
In their church government the Two-Seed Baptists are thoroughly independent,
each church controlling its own affairs. Associations are formed, but for spiritual
fellowship rather than for church management. What are ordinarily known as
church activities do not exist among them, although they believe in good works,
but not 88 the world looks at good works. Individuals may contribute to benev-
olences as they see fit, but organized benevolence does not exist.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
Between 1870 and 1890 some Swedish Free Baptists emigrated to the United
States and settled in different localities. A number of these came together in
June 1893 at Dassel, Minn., for their first conference, and thereafter a yearly
conference was held at different places.
At the first conference they called their body the Swedish Independent Baptist
Church, but later changed the name to Scandinavian Independent Baptist De-
nomination of America. In 1912 one section of the group was incorporated,
and the name was changed again to Scandinavian Independent Baptist Denomi-
nation of the United States of America. The others, who had not joined in this
incorporation, held conferences and about 1923 associated themselves under
the name of the Scandinavian Free Baptist Society of the United States of Amer-
ica. The two factions finally came together at a conference held at Garden
Valley, Wis., in November 1927, adopting the name Independent Baptist
Church of America.
DOCTRINE
The Independent Baptist Church of America agrees with other evangelical
bodies on many points of doctrine, believing that "Christ tasted death for every
man," that "He arose again," and "every soul shall arise and stand before His
judgment seat." They believe and teach also that repentance and baptism in
water by immersion are prerequisite to membership, as well as participation in
the Lord's Supper. They also believe in the laying on of hands at the time of
acceptation into the church. They believe in the authority and necessity of
civil government and at the General Conference held in Roseland, Minn., June 8,
1898, a resolution was adopted pledging the church to obedience and loyalty to
the Government, in all of its demands, except what is contrary to the Word of
God, as participation in war, which, according to their expressed conviction, is
contrary to the Word of God. The resolution contained a formal request that
young people of this denomination be exempt from service in case of war.
WORK
The whole object or purpose of the denomination is to carry on Christian
mission work in the United States and foreign countries; to spread the Gospel in
the precepts of Christ and His Apostles; to encourage one another to love and
good works; to build up the church according to the truth given in God's Word,
both as to membership and spiritual growth; and to await Christ's second coming.
t This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, bas been revised by Elder C. M. Sundell, of the Independent Baptist Church of America,
Minneapolis, Minn., and approved by blm In its present form.

AMERICAN BAPTIST ASSOCIATION
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
249
The American Baptist Association is not a separate and distinct denomination,
but it is a separate and distinct group of Baptists. They separated themselves
from the convention groups because they regarded the methods and polity of the
convention as an innovation among Baptists. They claim that their associations
are a direct continuance of the cooperative work in missions, benevolences, etc.,
since the time of Christ and the Apostles. They sincerely believe that those
Baptists who work with the conventions, though they may be orthodox in faith,
have departed from the New Testament principles of church cooperation.
The purpose of this body is to do missionary, evangelistic, benevolent, and educa-
tional work throughout the world. They do not unionize with other religious
sects and organizations because they believe that their churches are· the onl;y true
churches; they believe also that the Lord Jesus Christ gave the commission (Matt.
28: 18-20) to the churches, and that they are, therefore, the divine custodians of
the truth, and that they only have the divine right of carrying out the commands
of Jesus as stated in the great commission, and of executing the laws of the king-
dom, and of administering the ordinances of the Gospel.
They believe that each church is an autonomous, independent body, and that
the churches are amenable only to Christ as Lord and Master. They believe
also that each church is on a perfect equality with every other like church, and
therefore should have an equal representation in all their associated work.
DOCTRINE
The American Baptist Association accepts the New Hampshire Confession of
Faith that has been so long held by American Baptists. They believe in: The
infallible verbal inspiration of the whole Bible; the Triune God; the Genesis
account of creation; the Deity of Jesus Christ; the virgin birth of Christ; the
sufferings and death of Christ as vicarious and substitutionary; the bodily resur-
rection of Christ and the bodily resurrection and glorification of His saints;
they believe in the second coming of Christ, personal and bodily as the crowning
event of the gospel age, and that His coming will be premillennial; the Bible
doctrine of eternal punishment of the wicked; that in the carrying out of the
commands of Jesus in the great commission, the churches are the only units,
all exercising equal authority, and that responsibility should be met by them
according to their several abilities; that all cooperative bodies such as conventions,
associations, etc., are only advisory bodies and cannot exercise any authority
whatsoever over the churches. They believe furthermore that salvation is
wholly by grace through faith without any admixture of law or works, and that
the church was instituted during the personal ministry of Jesus Christ on the
earth. They believe also in the absolute separation of church and State, and in
the principle of absolute religious freedom.
ORGANIZATION
They believe that in the strict sense the American Baptist Association is not
an organization, but is a cooperation of the churches composing it. But since
all the churches cannot meet in the annual meetings, churches elect three mes-
sengers who represent them in these annual meetings, and for convenience in
their deliberations the messengers when assembled in their annual meetings elect
a president, and three vice presidents; two recording secretaries; and a secretary-
treasurer. They are strictly congregational in their polity. All questions are
settled by a majority vote of the messengers present, except amendments to their
Articles of Agreement, and such questions which are required under parliamentary
law to be settled by a two-thirds majority vote of the messengers present.
The American Baptist Association proper never meets since it would be a
physical impossibility for all the churches composing it to meet at one time.
Hence the annual meetings are called "The meeting of the messengers composing
the American Baptist Association."
'Thisstatement was furnished by Dr. 1. E. Cobb, seoretary·troasurer, American Baptist Association,
Texarkana, Ark.-Tex., and bas been approved by him in its present form.

WORK
The missionary work of the churches of the American Baptist Association is
divided into three phases: (1) Associational missions. This is missionary
work done by a group of churches composing a district association usually the
size of a county. (2) State missions. This is missionary work done by State
associations working in harmony with the churches composing the American
Baptist Association. (3) Interstate and foreign missions. This is missionary
work done by all the churches in the nation cooperating with the churches com-
posing the churches of the American Baptist Association. Interstate missions is
work done by missionaries from State to State; foreign mission work, of course, is
that done in foreign countries.
The benevolent work is usually carried on by the district and State associations.
Several States maintain orphanages and this is benevolent work. Churches and
district associations have funds to help support the poor and indigent in their
bounds.
Educational work is carried on (1) by the individual churches through their
Sunday schools and training departments. Sunday school and young people's
literature is published by the Baptist Sunday School Committe!' at Texarkana,
Ark.-Tex. This literature goes into practically all the States of the Union.
(2) Religious newspapers are published by individuals and churches for the dis-
semination of information concerning the work. (3) There are religious colleges
and Bible institutes where men are trained for the ministry. The medium for the
distribution of funds of the American Baptist Association is the secretary-treasurer
whose headquarters are at Texarkana, Ark.-Tex.

CHRISTIAN UNITY BAPTIST ASSOCIATION
STATISTICS
The data given for 1936 represent seven active organizations of the Christian
Unity Baptist Association, all reported as being in rural territory. The classi-
fication of membership by age shows all members reported as being "13 years of
age and over."
Four church edifices were reported with a value of $1,450. No parsonages were
reported.
The membership of this denomination consists of persons who have been ad-
mitted to the local church upon profession of faith and baptism by immersion.
The Christian Unity Baptist Association was not reported prior to 1936, hence
no comparative data are available.
State tab1ea.-Tables I and 2 present the statistics for the Christian Unity
Baptist Association by States. Table 1 gives for each State the number and
membership of the churches, membership classified by sex, and data for Sunday
schools. Table 2 presents the church expenditures, showing separately current
expenses, improvements, benevolences, etc. Separate presentation in table 2 is
limited to the State of North Carolina, the only State in which three or more
churches reported expenditures, in order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics
of any individual church, and for this reason no table is given showing the value
of church edifices.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL lUSTORY
It would be difficult to determine when and where the Christian Unity Baptist
body had its beginning, since the doctrines held by them are advocated in some
measure by various other denominations. However, there are some certainties
about this body that may be definitely stated as regards its development as a
denomination separate from other Baptist bodies. At the forty-third session of
the Mountain Union Baptist Association of Regular Baptists convened with Big
Ridge Church of Ashe County, N. C., in the year 1909, the committee on resolu-
tions presented their report. Among other things that were disagreed upon by
the delegation from the various churches was the lollowing resolution, viz:
"Resolved, That the churches of this association that maintain free participation
in the Lord's Supper, or what is known as open communion, if they persist in
either of these until the next session of this association, shall be dropped from this
association without further action of this body." A very heated discussion followed
and the vote was taken by a roll call of the churches and recorded in the minutes
of the session of the association. The resolution was declared approved, since
there were 26 votes cast for and only 11 against the resolution. The delegates
who opposed the adoption of the resolution shook hands with the moderator and
walked out. of the association. They were fo: some years referred to as the open
communionists, since they believed that all Christians of whatever denomination
had a God-given right to the Lord's Supper, and that the "man examine himself
and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup." They were very much
in the minority and endured much persecution at the hands of the other group,
but they held to their convictions with a bold tenacity. On September 2, 1910,
delegations from Zion Hill and Macedonia churches met in an associational con-
vention and organized themselves into a body known as the Macedonia Baptist
Association. This organization was made upon the platform of the Mountain
Union Baptist Association of 1880 with some minor chanfes. In this organiza-
tion were 2 churches with a membership of 223 members, o which number 5 were
ordained ministers. Rev. F. L. Sturgill was elected moderator and R. L. Hash,
clerk. There were held 6 sessions of this body and it grew to 5 churches with a
total membership of 333, with 8 ordained ministers.
Some of the preachers left the body and joined other associations and Macedonia
Church joined the Southern Baptist Convention. Three of the churches struggled
on, holding fast to their integrity and earnestly contending for the faith of Jesus
Christ as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Rev. Eli Graham and Rev. F. L.
Sturgill were the only ministers who remained with the churches, but they held to
the doctrines (which the Christian Unity Baptist body now represents) with a
dauntless courage. They preached to the three churches, but had no association
for 18 years.
In the year 1932, Rev. F. Carl Sturgill was ordained to the ministry. Having
a desire·for, and feeling the need of an association, these three churches decided to
reorganize the Macedonia Baptist Association. Delegations were selected by the
churches and sent to Pleasant Home Church to form an association. They met
on October 27, 1934, and proceeded to reorganize the Macedonia Baptist Assocm-
tion. The 3 churches had a membership of 83, of which number 3 were ordained
ministers. They adopted the old rules of decorum but changed the constitution
in regard to reception of new churches and dropped the entire last article of the
constitution, which made provision concerning fellowship of Christian benevolent
institutions. The principal reason for its discard was that all who are born of
the Spirit of God are bro'thers and sister's in Christ.
The first change in the Articles of Faith dealt with the Calvinistic doctrine of
"eternal security." It was changed from saying that "all who are regenerated
and born again by the Spirit of God shall never finally fall away," to "all who are
regenerated and born again by the Spirit of God, and endure to the end, shall be
saved." The second change added the words "feet washing" to the article speak-
Ing of church ordinances.
During the time since the break over the communion question in 1909 other
dissensions arose in the Mountain Union Baptist Association, chiefly the right of
women to preach. So before the time for the sitting of the reorganized Macedonia
Baptist Association in 1935, other people had either "come out" on account of

oppression and restriction of Christian liberty, or been "turned out" for their
views on equality, liberty, .and unity of Christians. They were now ready to
cooperate with other people who had views similar to their own. Before the time
came for the sitting of the 1935 session of the Macedonia Baptist Association,
these people had got in touch with the leaders of this body, and it had been agreed
to organize a new association. The two breaks with the Mountain Union Associa-
tion were so sharp that it was suggested that a new constitution, rules of decorum,
and articles of faith be drafted, for those used by the Macedonia Baptists were
very much like those of the older association.
Delegates from six churches met with Zion Hill Church and upon a constitution,
rules of order, and articles of faith (drafted by Rev. Eli Graham, Rev. D. 0. Miller,
and Rev. F. Carl Sturgill) organized an assooiation known as the Christian Unity
Baptist Association. The membership of the 6 churches was 152, with 7 ordained
ministers. Rev. F. L. Sturgill was chosen moderator and Rev. F. Carl Sturgill,
clerk-treasurer.
DOCTRINE
We believe-in one only true and living God and the Trinity; that the Bible is
the scriptural word of God given by inspiration of the Holy Spirit; that the Bible
is a safe rule of faith, and the New Testament interpreted by the Holy Spirit is
the only rule of practice for the Christi'an Church; that all mankind who are
accountable to God for sin are fallen and depraved by sin and in this state they
possess no natural ability to reinstate themselves in favor with God; that Jesus
Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man, providing a way of salva-
tion through regeneration for the souls of all who are accountable to God for sin;
in the redemption of the bodies of saints, infants, and idiots, the latter two not being
responsible for sin do not need regeneration of spirit; that sinners can partake of
the divine benefits of the grace of God only by faith and repentance, that they
are called, convicted, converted, regenerated, and sanctified by the Holy
Spirit, and that all who are thus born again by the Spirit of God and endure to
the end shall be saved; that baptism, by immersion in water, the Lord's Supper,
and feet washing are ordinances instituted by Jesus Christ to be practiced by
the church and that regeneration or the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the quali-
fication for participation in either ordinance; in the unity, liberty, and equality of
God's children; the church is composed of all who are born of the Spirit of God;
in a God-called ministry preaching the word of God by inspiration of the Holy
Spirit and administering the ordinance of baptism and participating in the Lord's
Supper and feet washing; and in the resurrection of the body, both of the just
and the unjust, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they
that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation, and that the joys of the
righteous and the punishment of the wicked will be eternal.
ORGANIZATION
In polity this body is congregational, each local church manages its own affairs.
The association may act as an advisory council in matters of difficulty when a
church requests such aid, but in no case may it infringe upon any internal right of
any church. It may drop from fellowship disorderly and unorthodox churches.
Each church selects its pastor annually by a majority vote of members present
at time of election; it also has a clerk to keep a record of business transactions.
Deacons are selected and set apart for ordination by the various churches, and
ministers who feel a call to ministerial work are first licensed by the church and
when they have proved their gift sufficiently, are set apart by the church for
ordination. Usually ordained authority of other churches in the body, ministers
and deacons, are called as a presbytery and they examine those set apart for
deacons or ministers as the case may be; and, if found orthodox in doctrine, they
are given a charge followed by prayer and laying on of hands.
WORK
The work of this body is in home missions, and since it is not strong enough to
send out its own workers, it cooperates with all Christian workers, frequently
holding revivals with them. It also believes in prayer meetings and Sunday
school work, and has now on hand consideration of sending out an evangelist for
full time work among its churches and to cooperate with any work for advance-
ment of the cause of Christ where the Holy Spirit leads.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The General Association of Regular Baptist Churches in the United States of
America is not a convention. It is a fellowship. It is an endeavor to get back
to the old-fashioned ideal~, policies, and practices of Baptists as they used to be.
The association has a very simple constitution, and has as its basis of fellow-
ship the truths expressed in the old New Hampshire Confession of Faith. with a
premillennial interpretation of the last article.
The constitution provides that any Baptist church in the United States which
subscribes to the Constitution and Confession of Faith of the Association, and
signifies in writing its desire to find fellowship with the association, may be received
into fellowship-not membership. A Baptist church cannot be a member of
anything outside itself.
The Articles of Faith briefly stated are: We believe-that the Bible is the Word
of God; in the Holy Trinity; in the personality of Satan as the author of all powers
of darkness; that man came by direct creation of God; that man is born in sin;
in the deity of Christ; the virgin birth; that the salvation of sinners is wholly of
grace, through the mediatorial offices of the Son of God; that faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ is the only condition of salvation and justification; that all who are
truly born again are kept by God the Father for Jesus Christ; in the everlasting
felicity of the saved and the everlasting conscious suffering of the lost.i)n the bodily
resurrection; the ascension; the premillennial return of Christ and nis millennia)
reign; and that civil government is of divine appointment, for the interests and
good order of human society. Two ordinances are observed-baptism by immer-
sion and the Lord's Supper.
In polity the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches is congregational,
believing that the local church has the absolute right of self-government.
There is no denominational missionary agency, but contributions are made for
mission activities through approved independent Baptist missionary· agencies.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY

130
Among the earlier settlers in the United States was John Conrad Beissel, who
with others arrived in Boston in the fall of 1720. They reached Philadelphia
October 20, 1720.
These people fled from the Palatinate in Germany on account of religious
persecution. John Conrad Beissel was a skilled baker and an adept in music.
He became converted in 1715, then 25 years of age. In due course of time he
joined the Pietists. Because of persecutions by his fellow craftsmen and church
authorities he decided to come to America and join the brotherhood on the Wis-
sahickon in the vicinity of Germantown, Pa., arriving in 1720.
Great was his surprise when he learned that the community had ceased to
exist as an organized body. Kelpius, their leader, was dead; Koster, a promi-
nent member, had returned to Germany; and others were scattered. Some
lived nearby as hermits.
Matthai, a hermit whom Beissel consulted, advised him to remain in German-
town for a time and learn the weaver's art. Acting upon this advice, he inden-
tured himself to one Peter Becker, of Germantown, who had come from the
Schwartzenau community in Germany the year before (1719), and who later
became the founder of the German Baptist Brethren, or Dunkards.
1 This statement, which Is substantially the same a.' that published in voJ. II of the Report on Religious
BodiP.s, 1926, bas been revised by Miss Emma C. Mono, secretary of the Seventh Day Baptist Missionary
Board, Waynesboro, Pa., and approved by her in its present fonn.

SEVENTH DAY BAPTISTS (GERMAN, 1728> 261
Beissel was cordially received into the devout family of his master. He sug-
gested to Becker that he call together his former companions to try to renew
their religious zeal, advice which he evidently followed.
Having finished his trade of weaver, Beissel now determined to carry out
his original purpose, and with a former companion visited the Conestoga Valley
in Lancaster County. There in the primitive forest by a spring they built a
cabin on the banks of the Muhlbach (Mill Creek), a branch of the Conestoga
lliver. The two men entered upon a life of seclusion and prayer. They exhorted
their neighbors when opportunity offered and imparted instruction to young
men who were sent to them. This was virtually a free school, the curriculum
strictly religious and moral.
Later others of Beissel's ship companions joined him. Religious meetings
were held regularly in the small hut in the forest and about the country as o~por­
tunity offered. They also visited different communities or settlements. Their
mode of life, earnest exhortations, and revival services aroused much attention
among the settlers.
In 1722 the Germantown Baptists began to make journeys to the scattered
ones through the Province (Pennsylvania) and to hold religious services. On
December 25, 1723, some candidates for baptism chose Peter Becker as their
baptizer. Following this they organized into a congregation. They continued
to make journeys and hold services with the other communities. In 1724 Beissel
submitted to baptism by his friend and former master, Peter Becker. Beissel
and two of his companions were then already observers of the seventh day as
the Sabbath.
The newly baptized elected Beissel as their teacher. Upon his ordination to
this office a large measure of the spirit rested upon him and he conducted all
meetings with astonishing strength. This congregation held its first love feast
December 1724.
In the year 1728 Beissel published a little book on the Sabbath. It was so
effective that the congregation now publicly adopted the Sabbath as the day for
divine services. The observance of the Sabbath brought persecution. They
were imprisoned by the authorities and fined. This congregation consisted of
both the solitary and householders.
They had been much beholden in divine work to the Germantown Baptists.
But as they embraced and taught doctrines such as celibacy and the observance
of the seventh day as the Sabbath, which were at variance with the tenets of the
Germantown Baptists or Dunkards, dissensions arose, and Beissel and hi~;~ follow-
ers formally withdrew from them and organized as Seventh Day Baptists in
December 1728.
In 1732 Beissel left his congregation and removed to Ephrata, a few miles
distant. Here he was joined by others of both sexes who shared his ideas and
whom he organized into the Ephrata Society. Celibacy was enjoined. Separate
houses were built for the two sexes, each of which was organized in monastic
fashion, the "brothers' house" having its prior, the "sisters' house" its prioress.
The society grew rapidly. Industries were organized on the communistic plan,
which flourished. But Beissel thought them out of harmony with the spiritual
purpose of the community; they were, therefore, soon greatly curtailed and kept
subordinate to the religious idea. Ephrata had, however, one of the first schools
(1735) in that part of the country, and its printing establishment (1742) was one
of the earliest and best. A Sabbath school (for Bible study) was organized there
by Ludwig Hocker, assisted by his sister (1738).
As time advanced the celibate membership diminished. Toward the close of
the nineteenth century, celibacy as a feature of the society had disappeared
entirely, the properties being under control of a board of trustees.
About 1764 a settlement of Seventh Day Baptists was made at Snow Hill,
3 miles north of Waynesboro, Franklin County, Pa. Members from Lancaster
County and other places joined them. Here, too, a Seventh Day Baptist Society
was organized (1800). Its government was similar to that of Ephrata, but the
building was more modern. Religious services were held in the saal, a large room
in the building for that purpose. Later (1829) a church was built nearby. The
last member of this society died in 1894. The property was legally transferred to
the congregation in 1900. In each of these communities the members of the
congregation and the societies met for worship.
Formerly the German language was used in religious services. Gradually came
the change to English, which is now used exclusively.
262 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 36
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The points of doctrine on which special emphasis is laid are: (1) The inspiration
of the Bible; (2) one God, the Father, and Jesus Christ, his Son, the Mediator; (3)
the Ten Commandments as still the rule of righteousness for all mankind; (4)
baptism by trine forward immersion ; (5) foot washing in connection with the com-
munion service; (6) the anointing of the sick; (7) the blessing of infants; (8)
observance of the seventh day as Sabbath; (9) induction to the ministry by personal
request for ordination, instead of election by the congregation as formerly. The
doctrine of nonresistance is held to be involved in the sixth commandment.
Each congregation elects delegates to the General Conference which convenes
annually the second week in June. Ministers are delegates by virtue of their
office, and are entitled to vote.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The National Baptist Evangelical Life and Soul Saving Assembly of the United
States of America was founded by A. A. Banks, November 25, 1920, in Kansas
City, Mo. The first session of the assembly was held in St. Stephen Baptist
Church of that city. For 15 years this body was affiliated with the National
Baptist Convention Unincorporated, but differences arose and in September
1936z in Birmingham, Ala., the National Baptist Evangelical Life and Soul Sav-
ing assembly declared itself to be an independent organization.
This body has always done relief work and has majored in the soul saving
business. Its aim has been for each member to add one member to the kingdom
annually.
The assembly is now establishing headquarters in all of the leading cities of
the United States when suitable workers can be found to look after the work.
The intention of the founder is to make the organization world-wide. The aim
of the organization is 1,000,000 souls for Christ annually through its many
workers.
I Thisstatement was prepared from Information furnished by A. A. Banks, founder and executivecaptain
of the National Baptist EvangeUosl Life and Soul Saving Assembly or the United Statos of America, Mus-
kogee, Okla.

GERMAN BAPTIST BRETHREN (DUNKERS)
GENERAL STATEMENT
The general statement of the early history of the Brethren, Dunkers, or
German Baptist Brethren, is presented very largely in the section for the Church
of the Brethren (Conservative Dunkers), the oldest and largest of these bodies.
In view of the fact that they have been popularly known, not as "German
Baptist Brethren," but as "Dunkers," or "Dunkardsl' that name has been prPserved.
The bodies grouped under the name German tlaptist Brethren (Dunkers) in
1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906, are listed in the table following, with the principal
stutistics as reported for the four census periods. One member of this group,
reported in 1916 and 1906 as German Seventh Day Baptists and in 1926 as
Seventh Day Baptists (German, 1728), has requested to be included with the
Baptists Bodies in 1936. The body known as Old Order German Baptist Brethren
in 1916 and 1906, and in 1926 as Old German Baptist Brethren, is shown in 1936
as Old German Baptist Brethren (Old Order Dunkers).

CHURCH OF THE DltETHREN (CONSERVATIVE DUNKERS) 275
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
Among the various communities which arose toward the close of the seven-
teenth century for the purpose of emphasizing the inner life of the Christian above
creed and dogma, ritual and form, and ceremony and church polity, one of the
most influential, though not widely known, was that of the Pietists of Germany.
They did not arise as protestants against Catholicism, but rather as protestants
against what they considered the barrenness of Protestantism itself. With no
purpose of organizing a sect, they created no violent upheaval, but started a
healthy wave of spiritual action within the state churches already or_ganized.
Among their leaders were Philip Jacob Spener and August Herman Francke, who
together organb;ed and supervised the mission, industrial, and orphan school at
Halle. They gave a great impulse to the critical study of the Bible, struck a
plane of moderation in theology, revived an interest in church history, and left a
lasting testimony in at least one organization, the Church of the Brethren.
Among the students at the Halle School was Ernst Christoph Hochmann, who,
after varying experiences of expulsion, arrest, ascetic life, and confinement in
Castle Detmold, retired to Schwarzenau, where he came into intimate association
with Alexander Mack, with whom he went on various preaching tours. In 1708,
at Schwarzenau, eight of these Pietists went from the house of Alexander Mack
to the River Eder. One of them, chosen by lot, led Alexander Mack into the
water and immersed him three times in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Then Alexander Mack baptized the other seven and these
eight, probably the first to receive trine immersion in the history of the Protestant
Church, organized a new congregation which became the basis of the Taufer,
Tunkers or Dunkers, Dompelaars, German Baptist Brethren, or Church of the
Brethren, as they have been variously called, as a separate church.
The members of the new organization waived the question of apostolic succes-
sion, subscribed to no written creed, differed from other Pietists in that they were
not averse to church organization, did not abandon the ordinances which Chris-
tianity, as a whole, held to be necessary for salvation, and in general gave evi-
dence that they were men of intelligence and steadfastness. Gradually they
worked out their doctrin~ polity, and practice, following in many respects the
same general line as the \lUakers, Mennonites, and similar bodies, though they
had no association with them, and are to be held as entirely distinct.
The church in Schwarzenau grew, and other congregations were organized in
the Palatinate, at Marienborn, Crefeld, and Epstein in Switzerland, and in West
Friesland; all suffered, at the hands of the state churches of Germany, Holland,
and Switzerland, the hardships which have been the usual lot of independents
and separatists. It was from Crefeld that the first Brethren, under the leader-
ship of Peter Becker, sailed for America, settling in Germantown, Pa., in 1719.
The next year Alexander Mack, with the remaining members of the Schwarzenau
community, fled to Westervain in West Friesland, and in 1729-t with 59 families, or
126 souls, crossed the Atlantic, landing in Philadelphia on l:)Cptember 15. The
fate of the Brethren who did not come to America is not known. In all probability
the greater number migrated, and thus the nucleus of the church was removed
from European to American soil.
Mter the Brethren came to America the details of the organization were devel-
oped and individual congregations increased in number-first in the immediate
vicinity of Philadelphia; then in New Jersey, southern Pennsylvania, northern
Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas; then reaching westward over the old
Braddock road, immediately after the Revolution, to western Pennsylvania,
and from the Carolinas into Kentucky, they were among the first to enter the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and from 1790 to 1825 the great central plain was
rapidly populated by Brethren.
The Brethren of colonial times (then known generally as Dunkers) were for
the most part German or Dut.ch farmers, although they engaged in some other
occupations, particularly weaving. They retained their own language, and this
created a prejudice against them on the part of their English neighbors, who
looked upon them as illiterate, although the Saur presses of Germantown, Pa.,

Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. M. R. Zigler, executive secretary, Church of the Brethren (Con·
servative Dunkers), Elgin, Ill., and approved by him In Its present form.

276 CENS'US' OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
were famous in American colonial days. One private library contains over 400
different imprints of these presses, and their output of papers, almanacs, Bibles,
and religious and secular work gives evidence not only of a flourishing business,
but of a literary appreciation. This would seem to call for the organization of
schools, but, aside from the interest of certain members in the founding of Ger-
mantown Academy, there is no early school history to record.
There was also a widespread, though unjust, feeling that socially and politically
they belonged with the party that had opposed the Revolution, and the result
was a mutual dislike, which was prob&.bly increased by the fact that, though not
essentially selfish, they kept very much to themselves, mingled little with the
world, and took little part in the general movements of the times.
The Brethren shared the experience of other religious bodies organized in the
early history of this country. As conditions changed they developed different
practices and to some extent different conceptions, which resulted in the forma-
tion of separate communities. The first to withdraw were John Conrad Beissel
and his followers,1 who founded, .in 1728, the famous monastic community at
Ephrata, Pa. In 1848, in Indiana, George Patton, Peter Eyman and others
organized a small group.2 From that time there was no further division until
1881, when a comparatively small company withdrew a in protest against certain
modifications which they felt to be inconsistent with their early history. The
next year another division took place,4 based chiefly upon objection to the form
of government which had gradually developed within the larger body. As the
years have passed there has grown up a feeling that, with a little more patience
on all sides, this division might have been avoided. Recently greetings from the
conferences of The Brethren Church and Church of the Brethren have been
exchanged, and efforts have been made to unite these two bodies. In some
localities the union is all but effected.
DOCTRINE
The Church of the Brethren in general terms is classed as orthodox trinitarian.
Baptism is by trine forward immersion, the person baptized being confirmed
while kneeling in the water. The rite of foot washing and the love feast or agape
immediately precede the communion or eucharist, the entire service being observed
in the evening. Sisters are expected to be "veiled" during prayer, and especially
at communion services. In case of illness, anointing with oil in the name of the
Lord is administered as a means of reconsecration of spirit and healing of the mind
and body. The rule of the eighteenth chapter of Matthew with respect to differ-
ences between members is observed. Plain attire, excluding jewelry for adorn-
ment, is advocated. The civil law is resorted to but little. Taking an oath is
forbidden, all affidavits being made by affirmation. Nonresistance is taught,
and all communicants are asked to be noncombatants, not because of personal
fear nor out of a desire to be disloyal citizens, but because war is outlawed by
the teaching and example of Jesus. Any connection, direct or indirect, with the
liquor business is prohibited, and there is a corresponding insistence upon total
abstinence.
The ideal in all these ceremonies and beliefs is the reproduction and perpetua-
tion of the life and activities of the primitive Christians, and, while its effect is
manifest in a somewhat stern and legal type of religious life, mysticism or the
Pietistic temper has modified it in the direction of a quiet moderation in all
things.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the church corresponds more nearly to the Presbyterian than to
any other specific ecclesiastical form. The local congregation, usually presided
over by the bishop of that body, is governed by the council of all the members.
The power of discipline, including trial and excommunication, rests with the local
congregation.
Ministers are elected by individual ballot by all the members of a congregation,
from members of that congregation; but one feeling the call to the ministry may
present his desires for acceptance. When appointed by the congregation, he
exercises all the duties of the ministry save those especially assigned to the bishop,
and in due time is ordained to the bishopric. The bishop of a congregation may

or may not be resident. The pastorate and a salaried ministry are being rapidly
adopted by the congregations.
The individual congregation elects delegates, lay and clerical, to a State district
meeting, connected with which there is also an "elders' meeting," composed of
the bishops of the respective congregations. Above the State district meeting is
the general conference of all the brotherhood. To this each district meeting
elects one or more bishops as delegates, while the local churches elect other dele-
gates. The delegates elected by the State district meetings constitute the stand-
ing committee of the general conference, which prepares business for presentation
at that meeting. In the general sessions of the conference there is free discussion,
and both classes of delegates vote together on the final disposition of a matter.
Upon a proper request, a committee may be sent from the general conference to
any local congregation for the purpose of settling any difficulties that the congre-
gation itself or the bishops of the adjoining congregations may seem unable to
adjust.
WORK
Although the Brethren from the time of the earliest settlements in America
pursued a vigorous policy of church extension, moving forward into unoccupied
territory, it was not until 1885 that regularly organized missionary endeavor in
both home and foreign fields was undertaken.
Home mission work is being done in the United States and Canada. This
territory is divided into 49 districts. The general conference elects a general
board of seven members, with one member a woman. This board administers both
home and foreign missions. Each district elects a district home-mission board. These
district boards in cooperation with the general mission board constitute the home
missionary organization. About 75 enterprises are under direction of this organi-
zation. An average of about $100,000 is spent each year in equipment and
salaries. The program includes small work among foreigners, and mountaineers,
and an extensive work among distressed areas in city and rural fields.
The foreign mission enterprises of the Brethren are under the care of the general
mission board, which in 1936 carried on work in India, China, and Africa, also
supervising churches in Sweden and Denmark. In all these countries there are
about 25 stations, occupied by 100 American missionaries, with 260 native helpers,
and 27 churches, with a membership of about 8,620. There were also reported
180 schools of various grades with about 3,700 students, and 5 hospitals treating
more than 60,000 patients. The amount contributed in 1936 for the support of
foreign missions was about $140,000; the'value of property belonging to the de-
nomination in foreign countries is estimated at about $650,000, and there are en-
dowments amounting to approximately $1,500,000.
The denomination owns 6 senior colleges with an enrollment of 3,035 students
and 1 theological seminary and training school with 143 students. The property
and equipment were valued at $3,182,795 in 1936. Theseinstitutionshaveatotal
cash endowment of $1,776,810, notes and pledges of $404,302, and annuities and
nonproductive endowment of $654,149.
The total offering of the Sunday school is over $209,000 annually, of which
$56,000 goes to missions.
Many institutes and schools of method are provided. Leadership training
is going on with large groups of people through training schools in local churches
as well as in camps. Fifty summer camps for the various age groups of children,
also for youth and adults were held in 1936 with more than 4,400 in attendance.
The church seeks to take care of her own poor and homeless by establishing
and maintaining comfortable homes for them. There are 15 such institutions in
the United States.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
Up to the latter part of the nineteenth century the history of the Dunkers t
was one of peace. Whatever disparity of individual opinion there was did not
p8BS the bounds of mutual forbearance. As, however, social customs developed
along more modern lines during the latter part of that century, certain influences
were manifested among the communities which tended to lessen the emphasis
upon many of the special customs of the earlier times. Accordingly, some of
the members, fearful lest the traditions of the founders of the denomination
should be overborne, and "the Scriptures suffer violence," and desirous of per-
petuating the type of life, as well as of belief, observed by the early Brethren,
withdrew in 1881 and formed the organization known as the "Old German Baptist
Brethren."
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In certain matters of doctrine and also in some features of church organization
the Old Order Brethren are in essential agreement with the other branches.
They accept the literal teaching of the Scriptures in regard to the Lord's Supper
and foot washing; hold close communion; practice nonconformity to the world
in war, politics, secret societies, dress, and amusements; refuse to swear or take
oath under any circumstances; reject a salaried ministry; anoint with oil those
who are sick, not so much for the healing of the natural body as for spiritual
healing; strictly enjoin temperance upon all their members; and allow none to

traffic in alcoholic or malt liquors. They believe that nothing but death can
break the marriage vow, and refuse to perform a marriage ceremony for any
divorced person.
WORK
Specially organized missiOns, Sunday schools, and ecclesiastical schools are
regarded by these Brethren as opposed to essential Christianity, but they are
charitable in deed as in word, support their own poor, and extend a helping
hand to all needy persons, whether they are or are not members of their own
religious organization.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The first Brethren came to America from Crefeld, Rhine Valley, in 1719.
They settled at what is now Germantown (Philadelphia), Pa. The first church
was organized there on Christmas Day 1723, with 23 members. The first min-
ister was Peter Becker. Ten years later Alexander Mack, their leader in Europe,
landed at Philadelphia with 59 families.
The numerical growth of the Brethren communities was slow, and by 1880,
though widely dispersed,2 the total membership was scarcely 60,000. The mem-
bership was largely agricultural and the ministry, though it numbered among
its members some men of profound learning, was for the most part uneducated.
There were no theolo~~;ical seminaries to which they looked for a ministry. Gradu-
ally the autonomy of the local churches was lost; strict adherence to forms of
dress and worship were rigidly enforced; any steps looking toward progress or
toward a better organization were sternly opposed ; the attempt by some of the
Brethren to establish higher institutions of learning, promote missionary enter-
prise, provide for an educated and supported ministry, and above all else, the
earnest questioning of the authority of the annual conference as a legislative body,
hroup:ht on a. crisiR. This led, after many futile efforts to avert it, to a division in
the church. Those who advocated progress were derisively called "progressives."
Their leaders were expelled from the church. After a vain attempt to be reconciled
to the church, covering more than a year, these leaders determined to organize
independently. Others in sympathy with this "progressive" movement voluntarily
joined with it. So in 1882 the Brethren Church was organized.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine the church is thoroughly evangelical. The Brethren avoid doctrinal
controversy and there is complete unanimity in belief and practice throughout the
whole brotherhood. Perhaps the best expression of this doctrinal belief is set
1 This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodles,l926, has been revised by George E. Cone, national statistician of Brethren Churches, Portis, Kans.,
and approved by him in Its present form.

forth in the "Message of the Brethren Ministry," adopted about 1917. These
declarations are, in part, as follows:
The authority and integrity of the Holy Scriptures; God's supreme revela-
tion made through Jesus Christ, a complete and authentic record of which
revelation is the New Testament; and the Old and New Testaments, as orig-
inally given, the infallible record of the perfect, final, and authoritative
revelation of God's will, altogether sufficient in themselves as a rule of faith
and practice;
The preexistence, Deity, and incarnation by virgin birth of Jesus Christ, the
Son of God;
The fall of man, his consequent spiritual death and utter sinfulness, and the
necessity of his new birth;
The vicarious atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ through the shedding of
His own blood;
The resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ in the body in which He suffered
and died and His subsequent glorification at the right hand of God;
The justification by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, of which
obedience to the will of God and works of righteousness are the evidence and
result; the resurrection of the dead, the judgment of the world, and the life
everlasting of the just;
The personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit, who indwells the Christian
and is his Comforter and Guide;
The personal and visible return of our Lord Jesus Christ from Heaven as
King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the glorious goal for which we are taught
to watch, wait, and pray;
The Christian should "be not conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of the mind," should not engage in carnal strife, and should
"swear not at all";
The Christian should observe, as his duty and privilege, the ordinances of
our Lord Jesus Christ, among which are (a) baptism of believers by trine
immersion; (b) confirmationh·(c) the Lord's Supper; (d) the communion of the
bread and wine; (e) the was lng of the saints' feet; and (f) the anointing of
the sick with oil.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the Brethren Church may be best described as congregational.
Every congregation is a church of Christ. All the congregations voluntarily
uniting for the promotion of the work committed to them form the Brethren
Church as a whole. The organization of the local congregations is very simple
and believed to be in harmony with the spirit of the New Testament teachings.
There are elders and deacons, evangelists and deaconesses. The minister in
charge of the work of a local church is the pastor. The deaconess may be a min-
ister. A local congregation is entirely free to perfect its organization by electing
any officers deemed necessary. The churches of a convenient geographical terri-
tory are formed into district conferences, of which there are nine.
WORK
The denomination maintains and supports Ashland College, located at Ash-
land, Ohio. This college has a property value of $517,127, a permanent endow-
ment of $417,081, and additional income from church organizations equivalent
to several thousand dollars annually; a strong school of education approved by the
State Board, and now a member of The North Central Association of Colleges;
a college of liberal arts; and a seminary for the training of ministers. Enrollment
in all branches reaches near the thousand mark annually.
The church expends annually around $25,000 in extension work in the home
mission field. The Foreign Mission Board expends around $45,000 in French
Equatorial Africa and Argentina, South America. On both these fields, the
smallest number of North American workers consistent with demands are used.
Native workers are being used as rapidly as good practice will justify.
In addition to the above special enterprises of church activity there is main-
tnined a home for the aged ministers and members at Flora, Ind., and a fully
equipped publishing house at Ashland, Ohio.. The main auxiliary organizations
of the church are its Sunday schools, Christian Endeavor societies, women's
missionary society, Sisterhood of Mary and Martha, the layman's organization.
and the Boy's Brotherhood. One of the new ventures of the denomination is
Grace Theological Seminary, temporarily located at Akron, Ohio.
Though the denomination is small numerically, aggressive work is being done,
and work is going forward in all of the accepted branches of the work of our Lord's
church in this age. We believe the church has made many forward strides in
the past decade, and is still looking ahead with zeal and determination.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The Church of God (New Dunkers) was organized in 1848 by George Patton,
Peter Eyman, and others, who withdrew from the German Baptist Brethren.
The church claims that "Bible things should be called by Bible names" and that
the Bible name for the church, foretold by prophecy as the new name, is "The
Church of God." It refuses to adopt a human creed or confession of faith, as
the Scriptures are given to this end and are infallibly right. Baptism (a burial
or birth of water) is administered to those who profess faith in Christ and ex-
perience sorrow for sin, that they may receive the remission of sins and the
gift of the Holy Ghost. The observance of the communion, the literal washing
of the saints' feet, and the anointing of the sick are held to be essential; and the
second Advent of the Lord, and future rewards and punishments are taught.
An annual conference is held. Home missionary work is under the care of the
mission board. There is no educational or philanthropic work.
t This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. C. H. Holaday, New Castlr, Ind., and approved by him In its present
form.

PLYMOUTH BRETHREN
GENERAL STATEMENT
History.-Early in the nineteenth century there appeared in England and
Ireland, especially in the Anglican Church, con!!iderable restiveness under the
general church conditions. This was occasioned largely by dissatisfaction with the
close connection between church and state, with the stereotyped forms of worship
and with the church organizations by which believers were separated from each
other and were gathered into so many different sects. As a result of this feeling,
a number of independent gatherings sprang up spontaneously, both in England
and Ireland, in which men and women who were desirous of a "spiritual commun-
ion based on New Testament religious principles" met together for the "breaking
of bread" and for prayer. Of such gatherings, the most important, from an
historical standpoint, was one at Dublin, Ireland. Here, in the spring of 1827,
a few Christians, some of whom had already been meeting more or less regularly
for prayer, instituted the practice of "breaking of bread," though it was not until
1829 that the first permanent meeting was formed. There were also meetings of
importance at Plymouth and Bristol, England, and the fact that the meeting at
Plymouth at the first had some prominence in members and teachers eventually
gave rise to the name "Plymouth Brethren," which has come to be their popular
designation, though it has never been adopted by the different communities, who
speak of themselves simply as "Believers," "Christians," "Saints," or "Brethren."
As the different meetings, or "gatherings," as they were often termed, learned
of each other, it was natural that there should be more or less fellowship between
them, although no regular organization was formed. A number of men of excep-
tional ability and great personal power identified themselves with the movement,
among them John Nelson Darby; George MUller, of Bristol, whose famous
orphanages were but a development of one phase of the Brethren idea; Samuel
Prideaux TregeUes, the famous Biblical critic; Anthony Norris Groves, the mis-
sionary; and many others. These men for the most part worked along more or
less independent lines, as Miiller in his orphanages, and Groves in his missionary
work in Mesopotamia and India. In England the strongest influence was exerted
by Mr. Darby, who devoted to the development of the idea which had gained
complete ascendancy over his own mind an ability and intensity of purpose
seldom if ever surpassed. He was not only instrumental in the establishment of
a number of congregations in England, but extended his wor'• into continental
Europe, visiting Switzerland, France, and Germany, where ronny permanent
meetings were the result of his labors. At about the same time Mr. MUller also
visited Stuttgart, although with less success.
Jn the absence of any ecclesiastical organization, and in the presence of an
intense individualism and sense of personal responsibility, divisions naturally
arose, and the congregations gathered around different leaders. This did not,
however, prevent the extension of the idea. and tho formation of numerous meet-
ings, which exercised a powerful influence upon the religious life of the churches.
The movement first came to America as a result of the emigration of a number
of Brethren to the United States and Canada about the middle of the nineteenth
century. Mr. Darby made several visits across the Atlantic, and a number of
congregations were formed, and since that time the meetings have multiplied
rapidly. As in England, so in the United States, divisions haye arisen, but no
exact classification is recognized. Some meetings are called "exclusive" and
others "open," but there is no one term that applies accurately to any single
division.
The doctrine of the invisible membership of the church under the sole authority
of the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit has operated to prevent the collecting or
recording of statistics of the different communities of Brethren, and the tabular
statements, while as complete as it is possible to secure, probably do not include
all the individual gatherings or the full membership.

292 Cl:N'SUS' OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
Doctrine.-ln doctrine the different bodies of Brethren are in substantial
accord. They acknowledge no creeds, but look upon the Scriptures as their only
guide. They accept the general evangelical doctrines of the Trinity, the sinless
humanity and absolute Deity of Christ, and Christ's atonement by His sacrificial
death, and hold that the Holy Spirit is present in the believer and in the church,
and that believers are eternally secure. They look for the personal premillennial
coming of Christ and believe that the punishment of the unregenerate will be
eternal. The following statement, published as an answer to inquiries, sum-
marizes their general belief:
We believe in the absolute and perfect [verbal] inspiration of the Bible,
which we hold to be, not in name only, but in reality, the Word of God.
Having in it the perfect revelation of the mind of God, we refuse all
human creeds as being both unnecessary and a slur upon His Word.
We, however, have no uncertain belief in the doctrines unfolded in the
Scriptures: The fall and absolute ruin of man; his guilty, lost, and help-
less condition; the utter worthlessness of works, law keeping, or reforma-
tion as a ground of salvation; the amazing love of God in providing a
Savior in His blessed Son; the spotless perfection of Christ, both in His
divine nature and His true humanity; atonement by the blood-shedding
of Christ on the cross, by which alone redemption has been accomplished;
His resurrection as the proof of God's acceptance of that atonement.
We also see in Scripture the absolute necessity for new birth by the
Holy Spirit, through the Word of God, and of justification by faith alone,
without the works of the law.
We see that the believer is warranted to have the fullest assurance of
his present and eternal salvation, and that this assurance comes not
through feelings or experiences, but by the Word of God.
We also see that being saved by a work [Christ's] once for all, the
believer can never be lost but is as secure as though he were in heaven
already, because of Christ's death and resurrection.
We see, however, that Scripture guards from abuse of this doctrine by
insisting upon good works as the fruit of salvation; that the believer is to
reckon himself dead to sin and to live not only a moral life, but one of
love and devotedness to Christ and of separation from the ways and
thoughts of the world.
We believe that the proper hope of God's people is not the improve-
ment of the world, but the coming of Christ for His own, to raise the
dead in Christ, and change the living, and then take them all out of the
world, which He will then purge and cleanse by judgments preparatory
to the millennium, when Israel anrl the nations of the earth will inhabit
it under His rule; but His church will always be in heaven.
We hold that rejectors of the gospel and all the wicked will "have their
part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone," eternal punish-
ment, and not extinction or restoration. We therefore believe in an
earnest and affectionate presentation of the simple gospel of the grace
of God.
Organization.-The view held by the Brethren is that the church is one and
indivisible-"Christ is the head of it, the Holy Spirit the bond of union, and
every believer a member. It was begun at Pentecost and will be completed
before the second Advent." They acknowledge no ritual or definite ecclesiastical
organization and do not believe in human ordination of the ministry. They hold
that the personal gift is a sufficient authorization for the exercise of the privileges
of the ministry, and that this involves the priesthood of all believers under the
special guidance of the Holy Spirit. Hence they have no presiding officers in
their assembly meetings, but anyone who has the gift is privileged to exercise it.
Women take no part in the public ministry.
Discipline is generally regarded as "restorative in its character," and they
hold that "the solemn act of separation should be resorted to only after loving
and faithful dealing has failed to reclaim."
Considering the various denominations as unscriptural because based upon
creeds, an ordained ministry, separate church organizations, etc., they do not
fellowship with them. They observe the ordinance of baptism, usually by
immersion, meet every Sunday to "break bread" (which is the term they use to
designate the sacrament of t.he Lord's Supper), and have meetings for prayer
and Bible study, and gospel meetings for the unconverted. They own few
church edifices but meet in halls and private houses, some of which are the
personal property of individual Brethren.

PLYMOUTH BRETHREN 293
There is no special form of admission, at least no set form of words, but the
applicant is expected to give to the assembly satisfactory evidence of new birth,
of having passed through genuine repentance, and of unfeigned faith in Christ
and in the Scriptures as the Word of God, with life corresponding thereto. Giv-
ing that evidence, he is regarded as a member of the body of Christ and is accepted
as such by the meeting at the Lord's Supper. In some cases announcement of
the application is given, so that there may be conversation with the applicant
by individual Brethren.
Work.-All the branches are active in gospel work, contributing as meetings
and as individuals to the support of missionaries, though they have no mi88ionary
societies and give no pledge of personal support to their missionaries, who have
gone into every part of the world. They have no distinctive missions like those
established by the different denominations but have formed communities corre-
sponding to those in England and America.
These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by
the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to these churches
only.
The Plymouth Brethren bodies are eight in number. Roman numerals are used
for the sake of distinction, but they do not imply any precedence in chrono-
logical order or strength of membership; they simply indicate the order in which
the different bodies came to the knowledge of the Bureau of the Census. A
summary of the principal statistics for these eight bodies in 1936 with six bodies
in 1926 and 1916, and for the four bodies in 1906, follows:

State tables.-Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the Plymouth
Brethren I, by States. Table 3 gives for each State the number and membership
of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural territory,
membership by sex, and data for Sunday schools in 1936. Table 4 gives for
selected States the number and membership of the churches for the four census
years 1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under
13 years of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the value of
church edifices and the debt on such property for 1936. Table 6 presents, for
1936, the church expenditures, showing separately current expenses, improve-
ments, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics
of any individual church, separate presentation in tables 5 and 6 is limited to
those States in which three or more churches reported value and expenditures.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The more conservative Brethren, as distinct from the "Open" Brethren.
formed but one fellowship in the United States until 1885. At that time two
leaders came from England who put forth a doctrine which, it was claimed,
deprived not only the Old Testament believers, but a considerable number of
New Testament believers, of eternal life. This doctrine was strongly opposed
by a great majority, on the ground that eternal life in Christ is the common
blessing of all believers of every age, whatever other distinction may exist be-
tween them in different dispensations. Those who hold this view continue to
constitute the great body of the Brethren in the United States a11d are included
in this first division. They cherish the memory and publish the writings of
John Nelson Darby and other prominent writers of the earlier years of the move-
ment, although they have declined to look upon these writings in any degree as
a creed and are anxious to remain free to advance in the knowledge of the Rerip-
tures. They are regarded as more conservative than the second branch or
"Open" Brethren, although less so than others, and are ordinarily termed
"Exclusives" when any specific reference is required.
They have always been interested in general evangelistic work and are repre-
sented by over 60 evangelists in the United States and by 16 American mission-
aries and a number of native helpers, occupying 10 stations, in the foreign field,
where they have 6 assemblies or meetings, with about 200 communicant members.
No statement of the amount contributed for this work is available, gifts heing
made, usually, to individual missionaries and preachers, and no records are kept.
• This statement, which Is the same as that published in vol. II or the Report on Religion~ Bodies,
1926, has been approved in its present form by Mr. P. D. Loi1.enux, Bible Trutb Depot, New York City.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Plymouth Brethren II for the year 1936 is pre-
sented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures between
urban and rural territory.
The membership of this body comprises those persons who have been admitted
to fellowship upon their application, after careful examination as to the reality of
their faith and evidence of a Christian life.
There are no regular ministers in the Brethren assemblies, hence there are no
parsonages.

State tables.-Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the Plymouth
Brethren II, by States. Table 3 gives for each State the number and membership
of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural territory, mem-
bership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools in 1936. Table 4 gives for se-
lected States the number and membership of the churches for the four census years
1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under 13 years
of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the value of church
edifices and the amount of debt on such property for 1936. Table 6 presents, for
1936, the church expenditures, showing separately current expenses, improve-
ments, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics of
any individual church, separate presentation in tables 5 and 6 is limited to those
States in which three or more churches reported value and expenditures.

306 CEN'SUS' OF ThELIGIOUS DODI~, 1936
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
Plymouth Brethren II comprise those known as "Open" Brethren, though this
designation is not accepted by themselves. In 1848 a teacher at Plymouth was
charged with heretical doctrines concerning the Person of Christ. The other
assemblies were in accord in condemning the teaching and in refusing fellowship
to the false teacher. But a sharp divergence of principle and practice developed
in the matter of fellowship with individual Christians coming. from Plymouth.
Some assemblies, thereafter known as "Exclusive," put under a ban not only
Plymouth but any other assembly that received anyone who had sat under the
unsound teaching. Bethesda (Bristol) Assembly received into fellowship from
Plymouth those who had not themselves imbibed the evil doctrine. Thereupon
the "Exclusive" Assemblies put under the same ban as Plymouth, not only all
the members of the Bethesda Assembly, but all the members of any assembly
that did not repudiate fellowship with Bethesda, as well as with Plymouth.
Thus, successively, throughout the world many thereafter known as "Open"
Assemblies were declared outside the "Exclusive" circle of fellowship. Gen-
erally speaking, the "Open" Brethren, in receiving fellow believers, put emphasis
on the question, "What does the person himself hold?" They are "open" to
receive Christians that are personally sound in the faith, unless there is clear
evidence of intentional association with known evil. They reject the theory
that ecclesiastical position is in itself disqualifying; but intercommunication
with assemblies tolerating heresy has never been contemplated nor allowed.
The "Open" Brethren, inasmuch as they are for the most part "congregational"
in government, do not form a homogeneous body. Within the limits of evan-
gelical orthodoxy there is a great variety of teaching and prs.ctice among them.
As to the preaching and teaching functions, some claim that the open ministry
is preferable but not obligatory, others that it is obligatory but of secondary
importance. Some are on terms of friendly equality with evangelical Christians
of every name. Others again are intolerant of any divergence of view. While
all divisions of the Brethren look upon discipline in general as reformative rather
than punitive, the Open Brethren are more apt to judge of individual cases by
themselves than to undertake to apply to each offender general principles of
universal application.
WORK
This branch has entered heartily into missionary work, scores of missionaries
having gone out from the United States. In addition, there are many from
other countries who represent the Open Brethren in foreign missionary work,
besides those laboring in the home fields. While the Plymouth Brethren have
no humanly ordained ministry, there is a considerable number of persons who
give their entire time to evangelistic work either in connection with local congrega-
tions or in general missionary work.
t This statement, which is the same as that publishc<l in vol. II of the Report on Religiou.q Bodies,
1926, has been approved in its present form by Mr. P. D. Loizeaux. Bible Truth Depot, New York City.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classi1ication.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Plymouth Brethren III for the year 1936 is
presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures between
urban and rural territory.
The membership of this body comprises those persons who have been admitted
to fellowship upon their application, after careful examination as to the reality
of their faith and evidence of a Christian life.
There are no regular ministers in the Brethren assemblies, hence there are no
parsonages.

State tables.-Tables 3 and 4 present the statistics for the Plymouth Brethren
III, by States. Table 3 gives for each State the number and membership of the
churches classified according to their location in urban or rural territory, mem-
bership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools in 1936. Table 4 gives for
selected States the number and membership of the churches for the four census
years 1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under
13 years of age" and "13 years of age and over."
Separate presentation, by States, of the value of church edifices and the debt
on such property, and also of the amount expended for current expenses and
improvements, are omitted, for the reason that these statistics are very incom-
pletely recorded in the local assemblies.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The third branch of Brethren includes those who adopted in full the views of the
English leaders referred to in the statement for the first branch. They represent
the extreme high-church principle of Brethrenism and hold that absolute power
of a judicial kind has been delegated by Christ to the Christian assembly, so that
any decision of the assembly in entire accordance with the Scriptures must be
accepted. Accordingly, they advocate the absolute disfellowshiping of any person
whose life or doctrinal views are not in accord with the principles of the Christian
faith as laid down in the Scriptures.
1 No revlslon of history, doctrine. or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this state-
ment Is the aame as tbat published In Religions Bodies, vol. II, 1926.

PLYMOUTH BRETHREN IV 315
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The body classified as Plymouth Brethren IV disclaims any designation what-
ever save those that the Scriptures apply to all believers, as Christians, Brethren,
etc. To accept any specific title would imply that they are a sect, which they
deny, sects or divisions being condemned in I Cor. 1: 10-15. Nevertheless, they
do not consider that all the doctrines or practices of Brethren in religious denom-
inations, from whom they have separated, are those of Christ or His Apostles.
This division among the Plymouth Brethren was due to a cleavage occurring in
1890 from doctrinal differences in England and partly reproduced in the United
States, in regard to the great subject of eternal life. These Brethren hold that,
save in the sense that they recognize the principles and commandments given in
the Scriptures as governing believers who form the house of God, they have no
doctriries peculiar to themselves. They believe that all Scripture is the written
Word of God, is profitable for teaching, and should be followed in its entirety by
Christians, as regulating doctrine and conduct. From it they have learned that
Christ's death and resurrection alone suffice for salvation; that, having ascended
into heaven, He has sent down the Holy Ghost to indwell all true believers;. that,
as thus indwelt by the Spirit, believers form the one church, or body of vhrist,
of which He is the head; that, according to I Thessalonians 4, the Lord is coming
personally to take His people to be with Himself.
They have meeting rooms and regular hours for coming together to partake of
the Lord's Supper, for prayer, reading the Scriptures, and preaching. They
provide, through collections regularly made, for persons in need, for those who
preach the gospel, and for those who minister amongst them. These meetings
are scattered mostly through the Northern States. Very few are found in the
South. They are much more numerous in the British Empire.
1 No revfalon or history, doctrine, ororganization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence thisstatement
Ia tbe same as tbet published In vol U of the Religious Bodies, 1926, prepared from Information given
by the Gospel Book and.Tract Depot, 65 Bible House, Astor Place, New York City.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
About 1914 a cleavage occurred in England over a question of discipline, result-
ing in the separation of the "Lowe Party," or, as they were known in this country,
the "Continental Brethren." The remaining body of Brethren, as constituted
in the United States, have for convenience been designated Plymouth Brethren
V; in common with the other groups they claim no denominational name or creed
except that of Christians or Brethren; they believe and maintain, however, that
they stand upon the same ground, as to principles and practice, which was taken
by the original company with whom the movement began 100 years ago.
Their meetings (commonly called "gatherings") are most numerous in the
United States and Canada, though a few companies remain in England and in
France.
They are strictly orthodox in their views and look with suspicion upon cults
which depart from the simple interpretation of Scripture. They claim that the
Lord Jesus Christ was God and man in one Person; that His work upon the cross
is the sinners' only hope; that in the performance of this work He glorified God
and that, by reason of so doing, He Himself was and is glorious.
The ordinances of baptism and of the Lord's Supper are observed, and the true
church is held to consist of all those who repose faith in the Person and the work
of Christ, wherever they may be found. They believe in the premillennial coming
of the Lord and cherish the hope that the day of His advent is near.
They do not ordain or appomt evangelists or teachers, but individuals who feel
led to undertake service of this kind usually receive support and fellowship as
they go about in the different gatherings, as enjoined by the Scriptures; but no
guaranties are given them. They are held to be responsible to the Lord for their
movements and the precise character of their ministry. In such matters the
gatherings do not interfere.
WORK
In some meetings there is considerable activity along the lines of missionary
and evangelistic work, visiting of jails, hospitals, etc.
This body has three tract depots and publishing houses, one in St. Louis, Mo.,
and two in Canada-one in Toronto, Ontario, and another in Montreal, Quebec.
From these centers large quantities of evangelical and other literature are dis-
tributed. Thousands of almanacs, tracts, etc., are sent without charge to mission
workere and tract distributors, the expense being met by voluntary contributions.
"The Young Christian," a monthly. magazine, is published in St. Louis, as is
also a weekly paper, "Messages of Love," for Sunday school use. A Spanish
edition of the same is published in Pasadena, Calif.
t No revision of the history, doctrine, or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this
statement is the same as that published in Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926.

ffiSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION I
Another company of Brethren began a separate existence in the year 1906.
The reason for this separation was not doctrinal but ecclesiastical. A question
of church order arose between meetings in Alnwick and Glanton, Northumber-
land, England, identified with the company known as Plymouth Brethren IV.
The local meeting in Alnwick had been in a divided state for years, and experi··
enced Brethren in Glanton sought to introduce harmony, with the entire concur•
renee of many meetings in their locality. Failing in this, they at length began
to receive into their fellowship those in Alnwick whom they considered worthy
and repentant for their share in the confusion. The action of Glanton was
repudiated by leading men in London, and after many conferences on the subject""
neither would submit. London regarded Glanton as having interfered with
local responsibility. As a consequence, a world-wide division ensued, which
affected many in the United States. As stated above, it is purely an ecclesias-
tical question, and neither doctrine nor practice is involved in it.
aNo revision of historY, doctrine, ororganization was l'urnlsbed by tbls body tor 1936, hence tbls statement
Ia tbe same as tbat publlabed In Religious Bodies, voJ.:U, 1926.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classifl.cation.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Plymouth Brethren VII for the year 1936 is

urban and rural territory.
The membership of this body comprises those persons who have been admitted
to fellowship upon their application, after careful examination as to the reality
of their faith and evidence of a Christian life.
There are no regular ministers in this denomination, hence there are no par-
sonages.
Plymouth Brethren VII was, prior to 1936, part of Plymouth Brethren I,
hence no comparative data are available. This new branch failed to furnish his-
tory,doctrine, or description of its organization for the census of 1936.

RIVER BRETHREN
GENERAL STATEMENT
In the latter partof 1750, about 30 Mennonite families in Canton Basel, Swit-
zerland, after a long period of persecution, during which they suffered both
imprisonment and loss of property, decided to emigrate westward. They went
first to England, and in the fall of 1751 set sail for America. The voyage across
the Atlantic was disastrous; one of the ships with all their goods was lost, and
they landed destitute. One company, including John and Jacob Engle and
others whose names are uncertain, settled near the Susquehanna, in the western
part of Lancaster County, Pa., in the spring of 1752.
In 1770, as a result of the labors of some members of the Lutheran, Mennonite,
and Baptist churches, who were grieved at what they considered the formalism
which then characterized the churches, there was, in that region, a notable
revival, which was attended by many conversions. It was conducted principally
by Messrs. Otterbein, Boehm, Bochran, and the Engles, representing the different
bodies. Subsequently difference of views arose in regard to the form of baptism,
some holding that the applicant should make choice of the method, while others
claimed that trine immersion was the only proper form. The result was that
they mutually agreed to work independently, in accordance with their various
interpretations of the Scriptures.
The believers in trine immersion had no regular organization, but were in the
habit of designating the various communities as brotherhoods. There was thus
the Brotherhood down by the River, meaning in the southern part of Lancaster
County; also the Brotherhood in the North, the Brotherhood in Dauphin, the
Brotherhood in Lebanon, the Brotherhood in Bucks and Montgomery, etc. The
outlying brotherhoods looked to the brotherhood in the southern part of Lan-
caster County as the home of the organization, and it was probably due to this
fact that the general term "River Brethren" was given to the entire body.
Another explanation has been given by some, namely, that they were in the habit
of baptizing in the river. With the development of these brotherhoods it seemed
advisable to select some one to perform the duties of the ministerial office, and the
choice fell upon Jacob Engle, who thus became their first minister.
In course of time dissensions arose concerning what would now be called minor
points, which ultimately caused divisions. In 1843 the body known as "Yorker"
or, as some have termed them, "Old Order" Brethren, withdrew, and in 1853

At first the organization of the River Brethren was simple, but as their num-
bers increased a more permanent form became necessary, and about 1820 the
present ecclesiastical organization was adopted. During the Civil War some of
the members, although/roclaiming the doctrine of nonresistance, were drafted
for military service, an it became evident that the denomination must secure
legal recognition as a religious organization holding that doctrine. Steps to
secure such recognition were taken at a private council held in Lancaster, Pa., as
early as 1862, at which time those who remained after the separation of the other
two branches, and who constituted the great majority of the Brethren, decided
to adopt the name "Brethren in Christ" instead of "River Brethren," which was
done the following year. In 1904 the organization was incorporated according
to the laws of the State of Pennsylvania as "a religious body for the worship of
Almighty God," with headquarters at Harrisburg.
DOCTRINE
The Brethren in Christ have not accepted any historical creed or confession,
but have certain generally recognized doctrines to which they adhere. They
believe that the church is "built on faith in an almighty, triune, eternal, self-
existent God-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." They accept the doctrines of
the immortality of the soul; redemption through Jesus Christ as the Son of God,
who makes atonement for the sins of the world; and regeneration through the
induence of the Holy Spirit, developing into holy living. They hold that trine
immersion is the only proper form of baptism, practice confession of sins to God
and man, and observe the sacrament of the Eucharist, accompanying it by the
ceremony of feet washing. The recognition of Christ, not only as Savior, but
as Lord and Master and King, involves, in their view, the acceptance of the
tenets and principles of His government. Accordingly, they believe that1 inas-
much as He is Prince of Peace, His kingdom is of peace, and as His suojects,
they should abstain from the employment of carnal forces which involve the
taking Of human life. For this reason the doctrine of nonresistance, in a qualified
seruie, is a feature of their belief. They consider Freemasonry and all other

secret societies to be anti-Christian; they believe in prayer veiling for women,
and they advocate the wearing of modest apparel, with nonconformity to the
fashions of the world.
ORGANIZATION
The ecclesiastical organization of the denomination includes the local church,
a system of district councils, and a general conference. The officers of the
church are bishops, ministers, and deacons. The bishops preside at all council
meetings, officiate at marriages and in the observance of the sacraments, and
exercise all functions of the ministry. The ministers are specifically the teach-
ing body, but also do parish visiting, and by request of the bishop, in his absence,
administer the sacraments. No salaries are paid, and whatever is necessary for
their support is raised by voluntary contributions. The deacons have charge of
the business affairs of the churches, serve at the communion table, look after the
poor, and also do some visiting in the parish. Officers are elected by the con-
gregations or the councils, but are ordained by a bishop. The membership of
the district councils and of the general conference, which meets annually, includes
laymen as well as ministers.
WORK
The activities of the church are under the care of a general executive board of
seven persons, appointed by the annual general conference. The home missionary
work, under the immediate direction of the home missionary board of 7 persons,
was carried on in 1936 by 58 workers, who conducted general evangelistic services
and cared for 23 missions, while $8,980 was contributed for their support. The
value of mission property in the United States is approximately $4.'5,000.
The foreign missionary work is under the immediate direction of the foreign
missionary board of 7 persons, carried on in the South African and Indian fields
by 42 workers, at 7 stations, while $20,745 was contributed for the support of
this work during 1936. In Southern Rhodesia there are 40 missionary out-
schools and 8 in Northern Rhodesia, with about 1,445 converts to the Christian
faith.
The missionary activities have extended into Canada with approximately 12
congregations comprising a membership of 950. The Sunday schools are made
up of about 1,250 pupils. The church property is valued at $29,000. The educa-
tional interests are represented by the Ontario Bible School with an enrollment
of 30 students and property value, $13,000. The Canadian church has assisted
in contributing $2,541 to foreign missions and $1,397 to home missions during the
year 1936.
The educational interests of the denomination in the United States are repre-
sented by 3 schools-Messiah Bible College, Grantham, Pa., with an enrollment
of 165 students, property value of $109,000, and an endowment of $86,340;
Beulah College, Upland, Calif., with an enrollme 1t of 102 students, property
value, $15,000, and an endowment of $15,600; and Bethany Bible School,
Thomas, Okla., with an enrollment of 28 students, property value, $4,348, and an
endowment of $2,000. A printing house is located at Nappanee, Ind., with the
property valued at $30,000. There are 3 philanthropic institutions with about
150 inmates, holding property valued at $150,000, which are supported mainly by
contributions from members of the church.

OLD ORDER OR YORKER BRETHREN
STATISTICS
The data given for 1936 represent seven active churches of the Old Order or
Yorker Brethren, all reported as being in rural territory. The classification of
membership by age was reported by all of the seven churches, none of which
reported any members under 13 years of age. These statistics were compiled
from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual
churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination consists of those persons who have
been admitted to the local churches upon profession of faith and baptism by
immersion.
There were no church edifices, parsonages, nor Sunday schools reported, and
the churches in the State of Pennsylvania were the only ones reporting expendi-
tures for the year 1936.
Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 1 presents, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of this denomination for the census
years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
In 1843 a. number of the River Brethren withdrew from the main body, claiming
that the original doctrines of the founders were being departed from, particularly
in regard to nonresistance and nonconformity to the world. Most of those who
withdrew resided in York County, Pa., whence they received the name of "York-
ers," or "Yorker Brethren." They are also known as the Old Order Brethren,
and thus are sometimes confused with the Old Order German Baptist Brethren.
They have no church edifices, and the services are frequently held in large barns.
1 This statement, which is the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious Bodies,1926,
has been approved in its pre•ent form by Rev. Samuel H. Sherer, Mount Joy, Pa.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
Questions of administration or ceremonial detail, particularly in connection
with a church building, arose among the River Brethren in 1852. The next
year about 50 persons in Dauphin and Lebanon Counties, Pa., withdrew and
in 1855 organized under the leadership of Matthias Brinser as their first bishop.
They were thus generally called "Brinsers," but later adopted the name "United
Zion's Children." They are found principally in Dauphin, Lancaster, and
Lebanon Counties, Pa.
Their doctrine is essentially the same as that of the Brethren in Christ, and
their confession of faith is about the same. They practice baptism by trine
immersion, which must be preceded by "thorough repentance and remission of
sins" on the part of the applicant. They also observe the ceremony of foot
washing in connection with the communion services, generally called love feasts,
which are held several times during the year.
They have a home for their own aged and poor, as well as for such who do not
belong to this church; this is valued at $60,000.
1~0 revision of the history, doctrine, or organization was f111nlshed by this body for 1936, hence this
statementis the sameas that publishedin Religious Bodies, vol. II,1926.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a very heavy Japanese immigra-
tion into the United States. Most of these folks settled on the Pacific coast.
By far the largest number of- them were members of the Shin Sect of Buddhism
in their homeland. Until the close of the century they were without means of
satisfying their spiritual aspirations, as there were no churches or meeting places
of their denomination nor a clergy for their spiritual guidance.
In the year 1898 Rev. S. Sonoda, accompanied by_Rev. K. Nishijima, landed
at San Francisco and established the first Young Men's Buddhist Association.
Each following year saw the establishment of new branches of the "Y. M. B. A."
As these religious centers grew the necessity arose for centralized authority and
Rev. S. Sonoda became the first bishop of the Shin Sect of Buddhism in America.
The year 1905 witnessed the consecration of the first church on the mainland
of the United States, when its doors swung open for public worship in the city of
San Francisco. This church became the headquarters of the Buddhist Mission
of North America and it has thus remained through the years. The present head
of the church in the United States is the Right Reverend R. Matsukage with
the title of "bishop superintendent."
Under the jurisdiction of the bishop are 2 deans and 65 Japanese clergymen
who preside over the various churches. In San Francisco, Los Angeles, and
Tacoma, Wash., there are English departments in connection with the churches
with six American clergy in attendance.
DOCTRINE
Buddhism is a most complex system of religion and its founder, Siddartha
Gautama, the Enlightened One, taught his followers in various ways according
to their different abilities, characters, and dispositions. The Buddha opened
many a gate of entrance for his disciples, and of these we now distinguish two main
entrances or pathways to salvation. One of them is the way directly leading
to the truth of salvation whereby one can escape from a world of suffering; while
the other is a provisionary way which will prepare one to enter finally upon the
path of truth.
Buddhism divides itself into two principal schools-Hinayana or the Lesser;
Mahayana, the Greater Vehicle. The former is for those who are satisfied with
a comparatively inferior attainment, while the Greater Vehicle teaches the way
Enlightenment whereby is made possible the attainment of Buddhahood. In
Hinayana (the Lesser Vehicle) we distinguish what is called the "Path for the·
Wise" from that of the "Path of the Pure Land." The "Path for the Wise" is
one that will lead a Buddhist to sagehood while on earth, by uprooting the passions
and disciplining himself in all virtues; whereas the "Path of the Pure Land"
teaches us to attain Buddhahood by being born in the Pure Land of Amida (Infinite
Life and Light).
The "Path for the Wise" requires one to gain enlightenment through one's
own efforts, and its prescribed discipline is naturally beset with difficulties.
Therefore, it is properly called the doctrine of self-salvation, by which it is meant
that one can be saved by one's own efforts; which is to say, the way difficult to
practice.
The "Path of the Pure Land," on the other hand, teaches the possibility of
attaining enlightenment through a power other than oneself; and, therefore, this
way must be considered far easier than the other, and we call it the doctrine that
teaches salvation by a power other than one's own; which means the way easy
to practice. It is evident, then, that if a man is not highly endowed with wisdom
and intelligence, the following of the "Path for the Wise" must be said to be
extremely difficult. For such people as ourselves, who were born far from the
time of the Buddha, the best policy will be to walk along the "Path of the Pure
Land," believing in salvation through the grace of Amida (Infinite Life and Light).
• This statement was furnished by Rev. S. Alex Whit•, in charge of the English department, Buddhist
Mission of North America, San Francisco, Calif.

BUDDHIST MISSION OF NORTH AMERICA 345
The preliminary stage of this "Path "is the practice of giving, because in parting
with some of his possessions to others who may need them, a man is breaking
down, to that extent at least, his sense of separateness from others.
The next stage is the observance of "morality," of abstention from acts hurtful
to others in their property, persons, or feelings, because again such abstention
tends to break down a little more the sense of separateness from fellowmen, since
its ultimate basis is a recognition that their feelings are no different from what
our own would be under bad treatment. ·
The Buddha himself said: "One thing only I teach. Sorrow, the cause of
sorrow, the cessation of sorrow, and the path which leads to the cessation of
sorrow," and in these words is summed up the whole essence of Buddhism.
It is not pessimism, but common sense, to face the facts of life and to realize
that, on the whole, life brings more sorrow than joy, more suffering than pleasure,
despite the fact that this may not apply to a given individual; if we consider
living beings in the mass its truth is obvious to anyone not blinded by selfishness.
Buddhism, then, is a way of escape from sorrow, and sorrow being inherent in
life as we know it, Buddhism is a way of escape from life. This "escape" is not
by death, but by the attainment of a higher form of life, a form so developed that
our language cannot express it nor our minds picture it.
Buddhism expresses it by the word Nirvana, meaning, "blown out, extin-
guished," in the same sense that a candle is blown out and the flame extinguished,
and the nearest we can come to a definition is this-where desire, hatred, and
ignorance are not, there is Nirvana. That is to say that, if a man wishes to
attain Nirvana, he must extinguish in himself all desire, hatred, and ignorance,
though in effect the third includes the first and second, for if a man has eliminated
ignorance, he has ipso facto got rid of desire and hatred. These two latter can
only exist where there is ignorance.
The Buddha showed the method by which Nirvana is attainable, and he called
it the "noble eightfold path." We may express it by right actions and right
thoughts-or rather, since thoughts are actions, we can say simply right actions.
Those actions are right which-(1) Do no harm to others nor to the doer,
(2) do good to others and to the doer, (3) progressively educate the doer towards
the attainment of Nirvana by eliminating bad qualities and developing good ones.
Buddhism is a system of self-education, designed to lead to the highest develop-
ment and proved by all who have tried it, to lead to peace, i. e., to the absence of
suffering and sorrow. It contains no miracles, no divine beings-in fact no super-
natural powers of intervention in human affairs. Hence as each man is respon-
sible for himself, as he is now and as he will be in the future, he must look for no
divine aid to correct his mistakes or to answer his prayers-nor can any other
man "forgive him his sins."
The Buddha taught the law of cause and effect reigns in the moral as well as
in the physical world, so if a man suffers from "weaknesses," this effect results
from a cause-and this cause is his own doing.
It is evident that the self-education referred to is likely, for most men, to require
a long period. The Buddha taught that man has an indefinite number of lives
in which to accomplish it, for just as from the fertilized ovum results the foetus,
thence the baby, the child, the youth, the adult, and the aged, each differing from
its predecessor although resulting from that anterior form, so from the aged through
death results of new life form equipped with the good or bad qualities, the happy
or unhappy conditions, of its forerunner and cause. Realizing that all life is
one, Buddhism recognizes no caste, no rank, no color bar. A man who lives wisely
is a sage and worthy of respect--a woman also, for among Buddhists sex is no
bar to moral grandeur.
Buddhism has no theories of creation, and no historical events which its followers
are asked to accept. For this reason Buddhism is often said to be atheistic or,
at the best agnostic. It is neither atheistic nor agnostic. It does not deny or
ignore a supreme reality, nor does it assert that if such supreme reality is, that
man is incapable of recognizing it. What it does assert is, that ultimate reality
cannot be defined, therefore it is a waste of time and energy to talk about it, and
that man cannot apprehend the infinite by his finite mind, so that he must evolve
in him those latent powers which are of the nature of reality. And what we call
the Dharma (Law) is simply the way by which man awakens these powers or
attributes. That way is a master-system of religion• a discipline and a goal; a
yoke which the aspirant for truth takes upon his shoulders to bring out his spiritual
powers, a yoke which links him to that which alone is real, truth supreme.

ORGANIZATION
As before mentioned the bishop superintendent is in charge of all activities of
a religious nature. He has authority to transfer or to remove members of the
clergy for good and sufficient causes. As the congregation of each church is a
se}>8l"ate corporation, it alone has jurisdiction over the individual church property.
The clergyman of each church holds weekly services in his own edifice as well
as services in the outlying branches as often as time and his schedule permit.
He is also in constant demand to hold memorial services for the departed, and
perform all other duties that clergymen of any other denominations perform.
There are Japanese language schools of a religious nature in connection with
all the churches. At the present time they have no colleges, hospitals, homes for
the aged, children, etc., and the only publications are mimeographed monthlies
by the individual Y. M. B. A.'s. The only property is that of the individual
churches, administered by the individual congregations.

CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
349
This communion does not claim exclusive right to the name of Catholic Apos-
tolic Church but, maintaining that the one Catholic and Apostolic Church includes
everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus and is baptized according to His com-
mandment, whether by sprinkling or immersion, by layman or priest, no matter
in what sect or denomination he may be found, the church recognizes no other
name than Catholic Apostolic as correctly applicable to it.
The movement which resulted in the formation of this communion had its
inception approximately at the beginning of the second quarter of the nineteenth
century. The momentous events of the closing years of the eighteenth century
and the earlier years of the nineteenth, including the French Revolution and the
rise and faJl of Napoleon, had aroused in the minds of many devout men a con-
viction of the nearness of Christ's personal return, which was accompanied by a
deep sense of the unreadiness of His church, in its divided condition, to meet
Him. At the same time there began to be a realization of the importance of
prayer for the coming of the Holy Ghost and an earnest desire for the renewal of
the spiritual gifts of apostolic days. As a result of these things, pious people of
all denominations began to pray for a general revival and for the outpouring and
restoration of such a measure of the Holy Ghost as distinguished the apostolic
age.
About 1830 there appeared among some of those who were engaged in this
concert of prayer what were considered as distinct and abundant manifestations
of the presence and power of the Holy Ghost, similar to those of the apostolic
age, taking the form principally of speaking in tongues and prophecy, as at
Pentecost. These manifestations continued, and in 1832, as a result of the
"prophetic revelations," certain men were regarded as called to the office of apos-
tle. Others were added from time to time, until, in 1835, when 12 in all had been
chosen, corresponding to the number of the original apostolate. These 12 men
were of the highest respectability, of good standing in the Presbyterian and
Anglican communions, and several were clergymen or lawyers. Among them
were men of some prominence, including Henry Drumn:J:ond, Esq., a wealthy
banker and member of Parliament; Rev. Nicholas Armstrong, a clergyman
of the Church of England, distinguished for eloquence and pbwer as a preacher;
and Mr. Perceval, son of a prime minister of England.
The call of these men was held to constitute them a college of apostles, "dis-
tinguished from all other ministry by the claim that their call and mission were
not by election of the church, but by direct call and mission from the Lord Jesus
Christ by the Holy Ghost, making them superior in mission and authority to all
other ministry." Their mission was to testify to the personal return of the Lord
and to minister to the whole church, if it would receive them, the full apostolic
measure of the Holy Ghost and the apostolic gifts and blessings, so that corporate
unity might be manifested and the church be prepared to receive her Lord at
His coming.
After delivering their testimony personally to the heads of church and state
in Christendom, and receiving no recognition from any of the established churches
or denominations, the apostles proceeded to ordain and commission evangelists,
and to organize in nearly all Christian nations, churches on what they considered
the original apostolic pattern, which would show how the Lord would govern
His church, if it would permit.
The first church in the United States was organized at Potsdam, N. Y., and
the second in New York City in 1851. In England the adherents of this com-
munion are frequently called "Irvingites," from the fact that the celebrated
preacher, Edward Irving, was prominent !in the movement which resulted in its
formation. But its members have never admitted this title as justified, and they
never use it among themselves.
DOCTRINE
The standard of doctrine is found in the three historic Catholic creeds-the
Apostles', the Nicene, and the Athanasian. The church also includes among
its tenets the unquestionable authority and inspiration of the canon of the
• This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. H. 0. DuBois, angel (bishop) In chief charge of the churches In New
York and other Eastem States, and also by Rev. Samuel T. Pearl, angel in charge of the church In Chicago;
and approved by them in Its present form.

Holy Scriptures; the "sacramental nature" of the ordinances of baptism, the
Lord's Supper, and ordination to the ministry, as recognized by the different
denominations of the Christian Church; the indissolubility, except by death,
of the sacramental union in marriage; the restoration of the ordinance of the
laying on of hands by the apostles for the impartin~ of the fullness of the gift
of the Holy Ghost; the necessity of the gifts of the Spir1t, as tongues and prophecy,
and the other gifts, for the perfecting of the church; the payment of the t1the as
due to Christ, the High Priest, in addition to the making of voluntary offerings;
and the hope of the Lord's speedy personal coming to raise the dead, translate
the living members of His church, and bring in His reign of peace on the earth,
commonly spoken of as the millennium.
ORGANIZATION
The principle upon which the organization of the Catholic Apostolic Church
is based is that a twelvefold apostleship, as in the first days of the church, is
the Lord's only ordinance for supreme rule over the whole church and for revealing
His mind. Local churches are each under the charge of a bishop, designated
"angel," with a staff of priests and deacons, whose call, consecration, appoint-
ment, and rule are subject to the apostles. There is no election of ministers by
the clergy or laity, except that deacons, to the number of seven in any one church,
may by permission of the apostles be chosen by the people. A call from the Lord
by the word of the Holy Ghost through prophets is a prerequisite to admission
to the office of priest or angel.
Ordination to the priesthood and diaconate and consecration to the episco-
pate are exclusive functions of the apostleship. Angels cannot in any case
consecrate angels, nor can they ordain to the priesthood, except when specially
commissioned as apostolic delegates.
Angels and priests, thus called and ordained, are classified and assigned
for ministry as elders, prophets, evangelists, or pastors, according to apostolic
discernment of their rE>apective gifts and temperaments, this classification follow-
ing from the recognition of the four kinds of gifts specified in Paul's Epistle to the
Ephesians, iv: 11~13.
As appointment to any office belongs exclusively to the apostleship, and as
vacancies in the apostleship can be filled only by direct call of Christ, during the
absence of an apostle or a vacancy in the apostleship the churches remain in the
charge of their angels, with their priests and deacons.
Persons seeking admission to the church are received by the angel of the local
church on the certificate of the evangelist angel as to baptism, instruction in
doctrine, and acceptance of the authority of the apostles. The orders of priests
from the Roman and Anglican or Episcopal communions, taking service under
the apostles, are recognized, and they do not receive reordination, but only
apostolic confirmation of orders.
The last member of the college of apostles died in 1901, since which time
there have been no ordinations to the priesthood or episcopate, or even to the
diaconate. The churches remain under the pastoral care of the angels and
priests who were ordained prior to 1901, the number of whom is necessarily
gradually diminishing. The members describe themselves simply as waiting
upon the Lord, for whatever it may please Him to do; and above all waiting
for the promised coming of the Lord in visible power and glory.
Worship is conducted according to a liturgy compiled by the apostles in part
from the various liturgies of the historic church, the clergy who officiate wearing
appropriate vestments. The support of the ministry is provided for solely by the
payment of the tithe, in addition to freewill offerings for worship and for the poor.
WORK
As the work of the church has been directed exclusively toward the ~&waken­
ing of the Christian church to the hope of the Lord's coming and preparation
therefor, it has included no foreign missionary, educational, or so-called in-
stitutional work, although the different churches care for the poor in their re-
spective localities. The seeming deficiency in Sunday school work is accounted
for by the emphasis laid upon the duty of parents to teach their children, and to
bring them into contact with the ministry.

356 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
Among those who identified themselves with the Disciples of Christ in their
early history was John Thomas, M. D., an Englishman, who came to the United
States in 1844. As he pursued the study of the Bible, his views changed and he
became convinced that the cardinal doctrines of the existing churches corre-
sponded with those of the apostate church predicted in Scripture; that the only
authoritative creed was the Bible, the originals of which were inspired of God
in such a manner and to such an extent as to secure absolute truthfulness; and
that the churches should strive for a return to primitive Christianity in doctrine,
precept, and practice. He soon began to publish his views and organized a
number of societies in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, the central
thought in his mind being not so much the immediate conversion of the world
as preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God for the "taking out of the Gen-
tiles a people for His name." No name was adopted for the societies until the
bteaking out of the Civil War, when the members applied to the Government to
be relieved from military duty in consequence of religious and conscientious
scruples. It then appeared that they must have a distinctive name, and accord-
ingly that of "Christadelphians," or "Brothers of Christ," was adopted. They
have consistently maintained that their faith prohibited participation in the
Army or Navy of any country, whether in times of peace or times of war, until
the return of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth. ·
DOCTRINE
The Christadelphians reject the doctrine of the Trinity and hold that there
is but one God, the Father, and that Christ was the Son of God and Son of Man,
manifesting divine power, wisdom, and goodness in working out man's salva-
tion, of which He is the only medium, and that He attained unto power and
glory by His resurrection. They believe that the Holy Spirit is an efiluence of
divine power; that man is by nature mortal, and that eternal life is given by
God through Jesus Christ only to the righteous; that Christ will shortly come
personally to the earth to raise the dead and judge His saints, and to set up the
kingdom of God in place of human governments; that this kingdom will be
established in Palestine, where the 12 tribes of Israel will be gathered; that
Jerusalem will become "the city of the Great King" and there the throne of the
Lord over Israel will be reestablished; that Christ and the saints will reign over
them and all nations then existing upon earth for 1,000 years; and. at the end of
that period a second resurrection will take place, and judgment will be pro-
nounced upon all who lived during the 1,000 years, the just receiving eternal life
and the unjust, eternal death.
Admission to fellowship is contingent upon profession of faith in these doc-
trines and baptism by immersion in the name of Jesus for the remission of sins.
Participation in the Lord's Supper is restricted to members of the church.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the Christadelphians are thoroughly congregational. They do not
accept the name "church" for the local organization, but call it an "ecclesia."
For th~ management of the affairs of each ecclesia the members elect representa-
tives from among themselves, who are termed presiding brethren, managing
brethren, secretary and treasurer, and superintendent of the Sunday school.
The duty of the presiding brethren is to conduct the meetings in turn. They are
expected to call upon the various members in the exercises of prayer, reading the
Scriptures, or addressing the meeting, except when, by previous arrangement,
the preaching or lecturing, as they term it, has been allotted to some one brother.
The aim is to have as many as possible take part in the exercises, in order to avoid
the appearance of discrimination between clergy and laity. Women take no

brethren, who arrange the various questions that arise in proper form for final
action by the ecclesia. While the duties of these persons are the same as in
ordinary societies, the term "serving brethren" is preferred to "officers," to
exemplify the words of Scripture, "One is your master, even Christ, and all ye
are brethren." The meetings of the ecclesias are generally held in public halls,
private houses, and schoolhouses, comparatively few church buildings being
occupied.
There are no general associations or conventions of the ecclesias, although they
have what are called "fraternal gatherings." These are not legislative bodies,
neither do they claim to have power to act in any way for the ecclesias, but are
rather for the spiritual upbuilding of the members and their further enlighten-
ment in the Scnptures and for the instruction of the public. They are held in
various places in the United States, sometimes annually, and usually occupy from
2 days to a week.
WORK
The home missionary work of the denomination is carried on by each ecclesia
independently of the others, although when it is desired to invite a lecturing
brother for special public work a number of ecclesias unite in the invitation, and
each does what it considers its part in bearing the expense. Several brethren
are engaged in this special work and travel more or less for the purpose of pro-
claiming the gospel of Christ to the public and establishing a better understanding
of and obedience to the truth among the members of the ecclesias. Salaries
are not paid them, but their needs are supplied by the voluntary contributions of
the brethren or by ecclesias.
No foreign missionary work is undertaken, Christadelphians believing that
their province is to make known the true gospel to the people of so-called Chris-
tendom who have been led astray from the simplicity of the truth preached by
Christ and His apostles. During the past 90 years the Christadelphians have
established ecclesias not only in the United States but in Germany, Great Britain,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and other countries. This work
has been supported by voluntary contributions of both British and American
Christadelphians.
A Christadelphian Fellow Service League was organized in 1910, with head-
quarters at Rutherford, N. J., for the special purpose of helping brethren in
isolation, also the smaller ecclesias in their preaching.
The denomination pays special at~ntion to the preparation of literature,
including a printed statement of its doctrines, and to its distribution at great
public gatherings, such as the expositions at Chicago, St. Louis, and Jamestown.
For this work funds are sent by individuals and c~clesias to committees appointed
by the ecclesia at or near the place of the gathering, and these committees attend
to the distribution of the literature and report all receipts and the work that is
done.. ·
There are four Christadelphian magazines, The Christadelphian, The Christa-
delphian Advocate, The Berean-Christadelphian, and The Faith. The Christa-
delphian and Berean-Christadelphian are published in Great Britain.
A summer Bible school was established in 1925 in Arkansas and is held during
August in each year. The believers and their children from various States of the
Union gather at the appointed place to engage in Bible study and other exercises.
Arrangements are made for the housing, comfort, and feeding of all who attend.

The Christian and Missionary Alliance originated in a somewhat informal
movement started by Rev. A. B. Simpson, D. D., in the year 1881. At that
time Dr. Simpson was pastor of a Presbyterian church in New York City,
but left the pastorate, and also withdrew from the presbytery of New York, for
the purpose of conducting a wider evangelistic movement among the unchurched
masses. For several years he held services in public halls, theaters, and in the
summer in gospel tents. Shortly after the movement was started an independent
church was organized in New York City with an independent charter, still known
as the Gospel Tabernacle Church. The work became more widely known and
affiliated throughout the country through many calls for evangelistic services
and religious conventions in popular centers, such as Old Orchard Beach, Maine,
and various other resorts, and a number of local organizations were formed.
From the beginning a strong missionary tone characterized the conferences,
and in 1887 two societies were organized, respectively, for home and foreign
missionary work-one known as the Christian Alliance (incorporated in 1890), for
• This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926_,_ has been revised by Rev. H. M . Shuman, president of The Christian and Mlssionary Alliance,

home work, especially among the neglected classes in towns and cities of the
United States; the other, the International Missionary Alliance (incorporated in
1889), was for the purpose of planting missions among neglected communities in
non-Christian lands. In 1897 the two societies were united in The Christian and
Missionary Alliance and since then have labored in the double function of home
and foreign evangelism.
DOCTRINE
The Christian and Missionary Alliance is strictly evangelical in its doctrine.
It stands firmly for the inspiration of the Scriptures, the atonement of Christ,
the supernaturalism of religious experience, and a life of separation and practical
holiness. It has no strict creed, but expresses the great essential features of its
testimony in a simple formula known as the fourfold Gospel of Christ, as Saviour,
Sanctifier, Healer, and Coming Lord. It is not a sectarian body, but allows
liberty in the matter of church government, and is in fraternal union with
evangelical Christians of all denominations, accepting missionaries from the
various churches, provided they are in full sympathy with the evangelical stand-
ards of the Alliance.
ORGANIZATION
There is no close ecclesiastical organization, though the society has in the
United States and Canada about a dozen organized districts with about 500
regular branches. Only a small proportion of these are organized churches,
as the society seeks always to avoid a sectarian aspect and therefore is some-
what averse to the establishment of independent churches. Each local
branch is entirely self-directing and in most cases is primarily evangelistic in
character and a center of missionary conference. An annual council meets in
the spring, to which reports are submitted from all branches and fields, and
which passes such legislation as may be needed concerning the government and
administration of the work. It is to be noted that many of the most liberal and
active supporters of this work are still in active membership in various Protestant
churches, giving their support to the Alliance in its evangelistic work.
WORK
The territory covered by the home and foreign work of the Alliance embraces
the United States and Canada; Jamaica and Puerto Rico, in the West Indies;
the Republics of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, in South Amer-
ica; Belgian Congo, French West Africa, Sierra Leone, and the French colony of
Gabon, in Africa; Palestine, Transjordan, Hauran, and Djebel Druze, in the Near
East; three provinces in India; eight provinces in China; Japan; French Indo-
china and East Siam; Philippine Islands; and the Netherland East Indies.
The home missionary work consists of a general evangelism, carried on chiefly
among those destitute of church privileges, and results frequently in the organ-
izing of local branches and, in some cases, of churches. Religious conventions
are held in many centers where suitable openings are available. At these gather-
ings, while evangelism is a strong feature, much emphasis is laid upon the foreign
missionary vision of the Alliance. The annual contributions to the general fund
amount to upwards of $500,000.
The foreign missionary activities are organized on a basis similar to the organi~
zation in the United States and Canada. They are under the administration of
a large and representative board of 24 members, the foreign missionary work
being administered through the foreign department which is presided over by the
foreign secretary, who devotes his entire -.;ime to the supervision of the missionary
work. The report for 1936 shows 160 mission centers and 1,463 outstations in
20 different mission fields, where 95 different languages are employed. The
missionary staff is composed of 449 American and British missionaries, with 1,576
native workers. There are 502 organized churches with 48,142 members. In 11
Bible training schools 454 students were enrolled, and 28,603 pupils in 928
Sunday schools. Other school work is carried on where necessary but fullest em-
phasis is given to evangelism and the establishing of the church. The total
amount expended for foreign work, exclusive of expenses of administration and
including amounts received and expended on the field, was $507,430 in 1936.
The Christian and Missionary Alliance maintains three training schools in the
United States where young people are equipped for home and foreign service,
namely, The Missionary Training Institute, Nyack, N. Y.; the St. Paul Bible
Institute, St. Paul, Minn.; and the Simpson Bible Institute, Seattle, Wash.

The churches forming the organization called Christian Union trace their
origin to a number of independent movements, from 1795 to 1864, for a larger
liberty in religious thought and worship, a greater freedom from ecclesiastical
domination, and a closer affiliation of men and women of different creeds and
beliefs. A number of these independent churches sprang up in various parts of
the country, the leaders having no knowledge of the existence of the others or
their efforts to bring about a closer union of believers.
Rev. James O'Kelley led one effort in North Carolina, Rev. Abner Jones one
in Vermont, and Rev. Barton W. Stone led another in Kentucky. From 1835
to 1857 independent organizations were also formed in Clay and Ray Counties,
Mo., under the leadership of Rev. John Walker and Reverend Livingstone; and
in 1857 several organizations were formed in Monroe County, Ind., by Rev. Eli
P. Farmer, which were known as the Evangelical Christian Union. During the
Civil War Mr. Farmer entered the Army as a chaplain and a number of his
followers volunteered, and as a result most of the organizations were disbanded
for lack of a ministerial leader. Mr. Farmer united with the Christian Union
organization later, however, when he returned from the war. Several indjlpend-
ent churches were organized in Michigan under the leadership of Rev. Hiram
Rathbun, but later they were disbanded. Of the seven Missouri churches, six
were formally merged with the Christian Union organization in 1868, under the
leadership of Rev. J. V. B. Flack, and are still identified with the movement.
The intensity of the political strife during the Civil War became very bitter,
and was manifest in extremely intolerant partisan prear.hing. The war spirit
entered into the church services to such an extent that many ministers and laymen
who were strongly opposed to the pre.o:;entation of such questions from the pulpit
withdrew from the different denominations. Others, who refused to endorse war
and countenance what they termed "an unwarrantable meddling of both North
and South, which was the culmination of the great injustice and insane haste on
the part of the extreme leaders of both sections," were expelled from the churches
or socially ostracized, and many of them joined the ranks of those who were
impatient under the restrictions of ecclesiastical rule.
t ThiS statement, which Is substanti81ly the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Rellglous
Bodies, 1926, bas been approved In Its present form by Mr. 1. W. Hyder, secretary of the Christian lJnlon
Gen61'11) Council, Excelsior Sprlnes, Mo.

CHRISTIAN UNION ~71
Christian Union became a distinct church organization in 1864. Rev. J. F.
Given, of Columbus, Ohio, began the publication of a paper known as the Chris-
tian Witness, in which he gave expression to the sentiment of those who desired
freedom from political and ecclesiastical interference in religious worship. This
agitation finally resulted in a convention being called for those favorable to
"forming a new church organization" on broader lines than those of the already
existing denominations. This convention was held at Columbus, Ohio, February
3, ld64. After the representatives from several of the more prominent denomina-
tions had conferred together, both in private and in public convention, the fol-
lowing declaration was adopted as a basis of union:
Having a desire for more perfect fellowship in Christ and a more satisfac-
tory enjoyment of the means of religious edification and comfort, we do
solemnly form ourselves into a religious society under the style of the "Chris-
tian Union," in which we do avow our true and hearty faith in the received
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the Word of God and the only
and sufficient rule of faith and practice, and pledge ourselves "through Christ
who strengtheneth us" to ''keep and observe all things whatsoever He hath
commanded us."
A second convention was held in Columbus, Ohio, June 1-2, 1864, composed of
delegates from different local organizations which had been formed in the interim
and also of other persons favorable to the new movement. There were present
at this meeting some who had formerly been members of the Methodist Episcopal,
Methodist Protestant, United Brethren, Presbyterian, New School, and Free Will
Baptist Churches. A third convention was held at Lancaster, Ohio, November
19, 1864.
In 1865 a general convention was held in Terre Haute, Ind., attended by dele-
gates from different States in which organizations had been formed. The action
of the three former conventions was reaffirmed and a complete summary of
principles was declared. These have been revised by later State and general
councils, and, as now officially adopted, are as follows: (1) The oneness of the
church of Christ; (2) Christ the only head; (3) the Bible the only rule of faith
and practice; (4) good fruits the only condition of fellowship; (5) Christian union
without controversy; (6) each local church governs itself; (7) partisan political
preaching discountenanced.
The movement spread very rapidly, and among the more prominent early
leaders, in addition to those already mentioned, were Rev. M. T. Bowman, Rev.
K. D. Wolf, Rev. Ira Norris, Rev. Joseph Goode, Rev. J. W. Klise, Rev. Charles
Dorrell, Rev. Joseph Richmond, Rev. John lams, and Rev. A. T. Cunningham.
The local groups now differ somewhat in name. Those in Ohio, where the
organization had its beginning as a distinctive church movement, use the original
name, the Christian Union, for both local and State organizations; in nearly
all the other sections the local organization is called the Church of Christ in
Christian Union, and the State organizations are called the Churches of Christ
in Christian Union; but while thus differing somewhat in name, the several
State organizations affiliate and recognize one another as parts of the same general
movement, and the general council of all the States is known as the General
Council of Christian Union of the United States.
DOCTRINE
Apart from the brief summary already given, Christian Union can scarcely be
said to have a system of doctrine. Its members believe iu the generally accepted
doctrines of all evangelical churches, making no distinction between Arminian
and Calvinistic. They require no special creed, but say, as did Paul, "Let every
man be fully persuaded in his own mind." Each individual has the right to his
own interpretation of the Scriptures without controversy on disputed theological
questions, and on admission to membership is expected to make a public confes-
ston of Christ as his personal Savior, to accept the Bible as the revealed Word of God,
and give his promise to read and study it and to follow its teaching, thus "keeping
and observing whatsoever He hath commanded us," as set forth in the basis of
union adopted at the first convention in Columbus, Ohio.
The Lord's Supper, baptism, and, in rare instances, foot washing, are observed
among the churches, but none of these is required as a condition of fellowship,
"good fruits" or Christian character being the only test of fellowship. The
various modes of water baptism are practiced, each individual choosing the method
by which he wishes the ordinance administered.

The ordination of ministers is in the hands of the State councils and follows
recommendation from the local church of which the candidate is a member, but
the candidate is generally required to preach under a license for 2 or more years
and to pass certain examinations by the board of ordination. Men and women
alike are ordained to the ministry and are admitted to the charge, district, State,
and general councils on an equality.
ORGANIZATION
The local church or congregation is absolutely self-governing in all things
pertaining to its individual affairs. For purposes of fellowship, however, and for
the transaction of such business as pertains to the general movement in their
territory, various councils have be'en organized. Charge councils, composed of
contiguous churches employing the same pastor, usually meet quarterly, all
members and church officers participating. District councils are composed of a
number of counties and generally meet semiannually, with the church officers,
ministers, and sometimes delegates, taking part. State councils meet annually,
and are composed of all licensed and ordained ministers together with church
officers or delegates. The general council meets every 4 years and is composed
of an equal number of ministerial and lay delegates from the different State
councils, although some States have more delegates than others, because of their
larger number of churches and membership.
~WORK
Christian Union is engaged in a small way in missionary activities, local, home,
and foreign. The local activities are in the hands of the State missionary boards,
while the home and foreign work is in the hands of a general mission board ap-
pointed by the general council. The local mission work consists of evangelistic
efforts among the local churches that have become run down and unable to carry
on the work with regular pastoral services or to go into neglected and needy
communities and minister to their spiritual needs. What is known as home
mission work is carried on through the Chicago Tract Society uml ls confined
chiefly to Americanizing and Christianizing the foreign-speaking people in our
large cities. What is designated as foreign mission work is carried on through
the Ceylon and India General Mission. An accurate statement of the amount
contributed to these departments of the work cannot be given for the reason that
until recently no definite work had been undertaken by regularly constituted
boards. For this reason many have been contributing through various denomi-
national boards and others have made their offerings direct. Official and un-
official records, however, show that approximately $2,500 was contributed during
1936 to the local, home, and foreign work, most of which was sent direct to the
workers and did not pass through the treasury of the mission board.
Christian Union has no educational institutions at present. Sunday schools
and Christian Endeavor societies are maintained in most of the local churches
and several of the States are making special e'fforts to promote the work among
the young people of the churches.
A home for aged ministers is being maintained on the individual cottage plan,
depending solely upon freewill offerings. It is known as Christian Union HomE'
and is located at Excelsior Springs, Mo.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classiftcation.-A general
summary of the statistics for Christ's Sanctified Holy Church Colored for the
year 1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these
figures between urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from
schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual
churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination consists of those persons who will endorse
and do all in their power to enforce the rules regulating the church, and pledge
themselves to expose all evil to officers in charge.
Although this denomination may have been in existence prior to the 1936
Census of Religious Bodies, it has not been reported, and comparative data are
not available.

In the year 1903 a band of white saints from Virginia came to West Lake,
La., and preached sanctification and holiness to the people of the Colored Method-
ist Church. Many of them believed their doctrine and began reading their
Bibles and praying, and sought and obtained the blessings of sanctification.
The white saints, Asher Fisher, Charlotte Gray, Mary Handson, and others
made several visits and preached. C. E. Rigmaiden, colored, became deeply
convinced that she could not be saved without holiness, though she was Jiving in
a justified state. With this conviction she sought and obtained the blessings of
sanctification by power of the Holy Ghost, through faith in the cleansing blood of
Jesus Christ, and immediately began preaching and teaching to all she had
opportunity.
Soon others became interested and sought and obtained the blessing as a dis-
tinct and separate blessing from that of justification, among whom were Dempsey
Perkins, A. C. Mitchell, .James Briller, Sr., Lizzie Pleasant, and several others.
From time to time, others by the !1-"race of God have been sanctified by the power
of the Holy Ghost, and united in the work.
In the year 1904 the white saints came back to West Lake, La., to help destroy
the work of the devil. The colored people felt they were right and that they had
the baptism of the Holy Ghost and needed a church. On April 16, 1904..1. Asher
Fisher, Charlotte Gray, and others of the white saints organized the volored

Church South. God has prospered their work and through their untiring efforts
the work has spread north, south, east, and west.
This Christ's Sanctified Holy Church Colored was organized and given permis-
sion to do its own work as it felt led in the Lord, and from that day has gone forth
in the strength of the Lord.
Special emphasis is placed upon sanctification by faith as a distinct experience
from justification by faith in Christ, which is not brought about by a growth in
grace but is wrought instantaneously. Briefly stated this church believes in one
Lord, one faith, one baptism; that unequal persons (holy and unholy) should
not be joined in matrimony; members should observe the rules of the church;
no difference should be made in the sexes as to ministers and officers; and no
person should be received into full membership who uses or sells tobacco and
intoxicating liquors.
A board known as Board No. 1 and composed of fivE> members is the sup_!eme
ruling power; its officers are a president, vice president, and secretary. Under
the direction of Board No. 1 are several boards such as the Board of Extension,
Board of Investigation, Board of Managers, and Ministers, Leaders, and Deacon
Board.
There is also an overseer who has general oversight of the church, a recording
secretary, corresponding secretary, financial collector, treasurer, sexton, and
deputy. All officers are elected for a term of 2 years. There are three annual
meetings-annual conference held in September, district conference in June. and
Sunday school convention in March. Deacons, deaconesses. and ministers are
ordained by Board No. 1. Ministers' salaries are not fixed by the board but must
be adjusted by the individual congregations. Donations are made annually by
each church for educational purposes and all churches are required to have ami~­
sionary society.

OHUROH OF ARMENLA. IN AMERli<JA
HISTORY, DOCI'RINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
381
From general history the Armenians appear as a strong, vigorous, intellectual,
and progressive people in Asia Minor, whose fame had spread throughout the
civilized world long prior to the days of Caesar and the dawn of the Christian
period. During the ministry of St. Paul, immediately after the ascension of
the Lord, it is claimed that the Armenians were visited by Apostles Thaddeus
and Bartholomew, who introduced Christianity among them early in the first
century. The new faith spread throughout the land, and in 301 A. D. it was
accepted by the King of Armenia, Tiridates the Great, by the evangelizing of
St. Gregory the Illuminator, and thus the new faith became the state religion
of Armenia. From that time on the Armenian race has persevered in its adher-
ence to the Christian faith, and no persecution has been sufficient to alienate it.
The Armenians were imbued with the fact that they were the very guardians of
immortal truth and were to be ambassadors of the risen Lord for the salvation
of man. The literature and art of Armenia reveal how strongly their lives were
influenced by Christianity. During the early centuries of the Christian era an
Armenian alphabet was developed, the Bible was translated into the vernacular
of the people, as were also the great works of the fathers of the church and the
Greek philosophers. They erected thousands of churches which exhibited the
most beautiful forms of architectural design and testified to the religious devotion
and spiritual aspirations of the people.
St. Gregory became the first bishop of the church which he had organized,
and from him a regular succession of supreme patriarchs, who bear the title of
"Catholicos," has come down without interruption to the present time. The
residence of the Catholicos, which is at the same time the headquarters of the
Armenian Church, is at Etchmiadzine, a famous monaster_y at the foot of Mount
Ararat in Armenia, near the cathedral of the "Only Begotten" (Miadzine),
which is one of the oldest Christian edifices in the world, founded and built by
St. Gregory himself.
Until the time of the Fourth General Council, held at Chalcedon, 451 A. D.,
the Armenian Church was in full communion with all sections of the church.
Owing to a conflict with the Persian king, who was seeking to force Mazdaism
upon the people, the Armenian Church was not represented at that council and
did not receive the report of its action for some time. When the report came,
there was apparently some misunderstanding as to its meaning, and at a general
synod held in 491 A. D., the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon were formally
denounced, although the general doctrine of the Armenian Church continued to
be in substantial accord with that of the Greek Church. As a result of a bitter
controversy with the Greek Church over this matter, in which misrepresentation
and misunderstanding played a large part, the Armenian Church took no part in
subsequent general councils but maintained its independence under its own
autocephalous hierarchy.
The establishment of the Ottoman Empire and the adoption by .the Turks
of the principle of the absolute identity of church and state, so that the ecclesi-
astics of the different Christian churches became also the civil heads of Christian
communities, resulted in emphasizing the separation between the churches and
in intensifying national and churchly loyalty. As certain sections of the Otto-
man Empire acquired independence, the Armenians developed a desire for
similar freedom, and, at the Congress of Berlin, in 1878, presented a plea for
Armenian autonomy, emphasizing it in the claim of their national church upon
the sympathy of Christendom. This effort was unsuccessful; nevertheless it
aroused the suspicion of the Turkish Government, and, after some years of
general disturbance, successive outbreaks occurred in the years 1894-96, in
which thousands of Armenians lost their lives.
For many years, as a result largely of the influence of schools established by
Americans, the attention of the people had been turned to the United States~nd
a number of young men had come to this country, chiefly for education. with
• This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bod1es1 192G, has been revised by the Right Reverend Mampre Oalfayan, aot1111 primate, Church of Ar·

the increase of political disturbances and the disappointment of political hopes,
others followed until there were several large communities of Armenians. Some
of these had belonged to the Protestant Armenian Church, and, on coming to
America, identified themselves with either the Congregational or Presbyterian
denominations. The greater number, however, especially as the immigration
grew, belonged to the national church and felt the need of special services.
In 1889 Rev. Hovsep Sarajian, a bishop from Constantinople, was sent to
minister to a few hundred Armenians, most of them living in the State of
Massachusetts; and in 1891 a church was built in Worcester, Ma.'3s., which
was, until recently, the headquarters of the Armenian Church in the United
States. The great increase of Armenian immigrants made it necessary for
him to have several assistants, and the still greater influx of Armenians during
and after the outbreaks in 1894 and later, induced the Catholicos to raise the
United States to a missionary diocese, Father Sarajian being consecrated as first
bishop. Since then 1.he Armenians have increased so rapidly, in both the United
States and Canada, that the Catholicos found it necessary in 1902 to grant a
special constitution, and in 1903 to invest the bishop with archiepiscopal au-
thority. The mission was then reorganized and divided into pastorates-the
nuclei of future dioceses--over each of which a pastor in priest's orders was
appointed. All places outside these pastorates are regarded as mission stations
under the direct management of the archbishop, who either visits them or sends
missionaries to them from time to time.
Pending the building of churches, arrangements have frequently been made
with the rectors of Episcopal churches for weekly services, to be conducted by
Armenian pastors for their congregations. In other places halls have been
rented and fitted up as churches, and regular weekly services have been con-
ducted in them. Besides these regular weekly services, the pastors have bi-
weekly, monthly, or quarterly services in different places, while occasional
services, such as baptisms, marriages, and other devotional exercises, are fre-
quently conducted in private houses.
On the outbreak of the World War the Turkish Government allied itself with
Germany and asked the aid of the Armenians for the Central Powers, promising
to establish them in their homeland under their own government in return for that
aid. Only those in Turkish Armenia were able to respond, since those under
Russian rule were already in the war on the other side. Claiming that Armenia
was helping the Allies, Turkey annulled the constitution granted in 1862 to Turk-
ish Armenia and began a policy of extermination which continued until 1918.
During this time 1,500,000 were slain and 250,000 more were driven into the
Arabian desert to starve or perish. The atrocities committed by governmental
orders aroused great indignation in this country, and the Near East Relief was
organized to care for the refu~~;ees.
Prior to this war practically every Armenian in the United States had some
one in Turkey dependent upon him, and large sums of money were sent annually
for the relief of these dependent persons. In most cases the money was sent
through the State Department at Washington and was distributed by the United
States consuls, the American missionaries, or other persons known to the Govern-
ment. Under war conditions and afterwards many of these channels were closed
though the need for relief grew constantly greater as persecutions increased.
In September 1922, Smyrna was sacked and burned. The major portion of the
entire Christian population of Asia Minor was packed into Smyrna and the ships
of Smyrna Harbor, and the city was filled to overflowing with frightened human-
ity-about 700,000 all told. After a reign of terror for several days a fire was
started which wiped out two-thirds of the town, including the Armenian, Greek,
and French quarters. In this debacle 100,000 people were massacred and 160,000
able-bodied men were torn from their families and deported into the interior
never to be seen again. The American Relief Committee, the Near East Relief,
and the United States Navy succeeded in rescuing 300,000 persons. The Greek
Government did all in its power to help in the work and opened wide its doors to
take the homeless in. During the series of persecutions culminating at Smyrna
more than 1,150,000 refugees were driven from their homes and belongings and
expelled from the land on which they had lived for centuries, to find what haven
they could in Greece and on the islands of the Aegean.
As soon as the disaster at Smyrna became known to the American public the
United States rang with the desire to be of service. As always in such an emer-
gency, there was a great overlapping and duplication on the part of those wishing to
aid, and in consequence the Red Cross stepped in and offered to take charge of the
situation. In the more than 9 months that it remained in the field the Red Cross
fed an average of 600,000 refugees per month and expended $3,000,000. The

Near East Relief was assigned to Asiatic territory, yet it did much for the child
refugees in Greece, and the Greek Government strained every resource to deal
with the situation. The medical work was carried on by the American Women's
Hospitals and other agencies like the Young Men's Christian Association, the
Young Women's Christian Association, and the American Collegiate Institute of
Smyrna gave much assistance.
The pages of history, perhaps, do not record a more courageous and valorous
people than the Armenians nor one with a more tragic fate. In the eddy of the
great contending forces of the East and the West, from a once powerful nation of
some 30,000,000 souls in early times, it has been reduced to 1,000,000 in the
Republic of Erivan, under the suzerainty of the Union of Soviet Republics.
Here the Armenian Church still has its headquarters and is allowed some measure
of freedom. Besides the Armenians in Erivan-the historic home of the race--
there is a scattered remnant permanently settled in Russia, western Europe, and
the.New World, and others, perhaps another million altogether, existing under
conditions of exile in the Near East, Syria, and Greece. All the others have
perished, a sacrifice to religious persecution and the passions of war.
DOCTRINE
The doctrinal system of the Armenian Church is founded on the Nicene Creed
without the addition made by the Western Church in regard to the Procession
of the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as from the Father. It has also a longer
creed peculiar to itself, and accepts the canons of the first three General Councils
of the Primitive Church, held at Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, as well as
the writings of the recognized fathers of the church of the period of those councils.
While it has "not adopted the formula of the Council of Chalcedon with respect
to the two natures of Christ," it is "explicit in teaching that Christ was perfect
God and perfect man." The authorized version of the Scriptures is the transla-
tion made early in the fifth century (432 A. D.) by the Catholicos St. Sahak and
St. Mesrob and other fathers of the Armenian Church. In both the interpreta-
tion of the Bible andecclesiastical ordinances the traditionofthe church is regarded
as of paramount importance. Seven sacraments are accepted. Baptism is in-
variably administered by immersion, generally 8 days after birth, and is followed
immediately by the sacrament of confirmation, which is administered by anointing
with the chrism, or sacred oil, and by laying on of the hands of the officiating priest.
Holy Communion is administered in both kinds, even to infants, so that practi-
cally every baptized Armenian is also a comrimnicant.
Auricular confession is practiced and priestly absolution is given. Every
communicant is required to present himself to the priest, even if he has no specific
sins to confess, and to obtain individual absolution, before he can receive the Holy
Communion.
Prayers for the dead are offered without any definite teaching as to the inter-
mediate state. The saints and the Blessed Virgin are venerated, but the doctrine
of the Immaculate Conception is not taught as a part of the creed.
ORGANIZATION
The government of the Armenian Church is democratic, inasmuch as every
officer of the church, from the lowest to the highest, is chosen by the people.
It is at the same time strictly hierarchical, inasmuch as every minister has to be
ordained by a bishop who can trace his own commission to the Apostles through
bishops in apostolic succession. No bishop may ordain a man to the diaconate
or priesthood before the members of the church at which he ill to officiate have
given their consent, and the objection of the humblest member of such a con-
gregation must be taken into consideration. Similarly, a candidate for the
episcopate must be duly elected by representatives of the whole diocese, each
church or congregation having one or more votes according to the number of
parishioners, and he must be furnished with proper credentials from the diocesan
synod before he can be consecrated by the Catholi_
cos in Etchmiadzine. Accord-
ing to a late ruling of the Catholicos, women may vote in affairs of the parish
churches, though they are not eligible for the higher orders of the church. There
are, however, in some places deaconesses who are equal in rank with deacons,
and who, besides devoting themselves to general works of mercy and of education,
are allowed to take a limited part in the public services of the church and to
assist the priest in performing the liturgy. But this institution has not found
general favor with the Armenians, and in all other places where women are
engaged in works of mercy they do not take prominent part in the public services
of the church, nor are they invested with any sacerdotal orders.

384 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
The Catholicos of Etchmiadzine is the supreme head of all the Armenian
ohurches throughout the world. He is elected by both lay and ecclesiastical
representatives of all the Armenian dioceses and once was subject to approval
by the Czar of Russia. It is his exclusive privilege to consecrate bishops and to
bless the chrism, or sacred oil, used for baptism, confirmation, ordination, and
other rites.
Next in rank come the patriarchs of JerusalE.'m and Constantinople, the titular
Catholicos of Sis, and the titular Catholicos of Agthamar, each with archiepis-
copal jurisdiction, archbishops of other provinces, and bishops of dioceses. The
patriarchs are elected by their synods and were formerly subject to approval by
the Sultan. There are altogether 80 dioceses in Turkey and Transcaucasia and
4 missionary dioceses in Persia, India, Europe, and America. Many of the
dioceses in Turkey are vacant and are governed by vicars general in priests'
orders.
Although the government of the church is under the general supervision of the
Catholicos, and in certain cases of ecclesiastical ordinances and discipline his
decision is indispensable, each province is allowed to have a constitution of its
own suited to its special needs, provided that such constitution has been previously
ratified by the Catholicos. Thus, in Russia a code of laws known as the "Pala-
jenia" was in use from 1836 to the recent revolution, and in Turkey the con-
stitution of 1861 is in force; while a constitution, drawn up at a general conven-
tion of representatives of all the Armenians in the United States, was duly
ratified by the Catholicos in 1902 for the government of the church in this country.
The Armenian clergy in the United States includes the following grades:
Archbishop, resident pastors, missionary priests, and deacons. Missionary
priests and deacons hold no fixed appointments, but assist the archbishop gen-
erally in supplying, so far as possible, the needs of the numerous mission stations.
In each place a committee, or an agent, is appointed who is responsible for bring-
ing to the notice of the church authorities any matter requiring their attention
and for raising the funds necessary for carrying on the work of the church.
The principal divine service is the Holy Sacrifice, or Mass, which is generally
celebrated on Sundays and feast days and is conducted with as much ritual
solemnity as possible. On week days all churches hold public services, including
hymns, psalms, and selections of Scripture, both morning and evening, and
sometimes at noon and at midnight. In this way practically the whole Bible
is read in public at least once a year, while certain portions of it, such as the Gospels
and the Psalms, are read more often. The services of the church are held wholly
in the classical Armenian language, the grammatical construction of which varies
considerably from the modern colloquial dialect. The vocabularies, however, are
very similar, so that most educated Armenians can follow the services easily.
The Armenians, like other Orientals, used the ancient Julian calendar, which,
in the present century, is 13 days behind the new, or Gregorian calendar; but,
since November 13, 1925, by a special bull of the Catholicos, they have used the
Gregorian calendar.
WORK
Wherever Armenians have church edifices of their own, and in a few other
places, efforts are made to teach the children their native tongue, so as to make
the services of the church and the teaching in the Sunday schools intelligible to
them, and to instruct them in the language, history, and literature of their race.
The schools are held in the halls or rooms of their churches or in the rooms rented
for religious and social work, and the teaching is absolutely gratuitous. There
are also a number of libraries in different places, well supplied with the works
of standard Armenian authors and with Armenian newspapers and periodicals,
in order to offer the readers an opportunity to study their national literature and
history. Frequently, in connection with the libraries, courses of lectures on
various educational and scientific subjects are given in the Armenian language or
in English, a small fee being charged. The current expenses are small, as the
books are mostly presents, kept generally in the parish hall or in whatever other
place is rented for church services.
Numerous educational societies exist which before the World War contributed
to the support of Armenian schools in Turkey. It is claimed that there is an
Armenian educational society named for each place in Armenia from which
enough Armenians have come to this country to support a school in their native
place, but the activities of these have all been temporarily suspended since the
outbreak of the World War.

CHURCH OF CHRIST (HOLINESS) U. S. A.
IDSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
389
'!'his church was organized in 1894 by Dr. C. P. Jones, a pastor of the Taber-
nacle Baptist Church, of Selma, Ala. He was dissatisfied with his own spiritual
experiences and longed for a new faith which would make him one of wisdom's
true sons and, like Abraham, "a friend of God." After fasting and prayer, he
had a new inspiration in his work and accepted a call to another Baptist church
at Jackson, Miss., where he called a Holiness convention, inviting men who
appeared to be interested in his purposes.
The movement was at first interdenominational and antisectarian, but its
mission was misunderstood, and it finally developed into a new denomination in
1898, the original church at Jackson, Miss., being joined by others in Virginia,
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, under the National Convention of the
Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S. A.
DOCTRINE
This denomination stresses belief in original sin, the atonement, repentance,
justification, regeneration, sanctification, the resurrection, the second coming of
Christ, baptism by immersion, the Lord's Supper as a New Testament ordinance,
the gift of the Holy Ghost, foot washing, and divine healing. The membership
consists of persons who have declared their experience of salvation and their
belief in the doctrines of this denomination and willingness to submit to its
government.
ORGANIZATION AND WORK
The supreme authority for expressing the doctrine and making the laws of this
denomination is vested in the National Convention, which meets biennially.
This body is composed of its regular and elected officers, district chairmen and
su[>erintendents, ordained elders, and both elected and general delegates.
Episcopal in form of government, it elects bishops, one of whom is designated
senior bishop and is the executive head of the National Convention. At present
the national work is divided into seven dioceses, namely: Northern, Eastern,
. Southeastern, Southwestern, Western, North Central, and Northwestern, each of
which is presided ov.er by a junior bishop. This convention also elects recording,
corresponding, financial, and statistical secretaries; treasurer; one or more mis-
sionaries and evangelists; a committee on episcopacy; a general board of educa-
tion; a general mission board; and a general board of publications.
The district convention is composed of representatives of the local churches
and of their various auxiliaries, as well as all elders and licensed ministers in its
jurisdiction. It meets semiannually.
Each local church may elect a pastor, clerk, treasurer, deacons, deaconesses,
trustees, and such other officers as are necessary. The auxiliaries of the church
are the Sunday school, the Holiness Young People's Union, and the Christian
Women's Willing Workers.
Mission work, both home and foreign, is under the supervision of the general
mission board.
The general board of education has charge of all matters pertaining to educa-
tion. C. M. and I. College at Jackson, Miss., is under the supervision of this
denomination.
All church literature and publications are under the supervision of the secretary
of publications of the National Publishing Board.
The official organ of the denomination is Truth Messenger, published monthly
at the National Publishing House, Los Angeles, Calif.
I This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. W. H. Dunn, D. D., presiding bishop of the Eastern Diocese,
Church of Christ (Holiness) U. S. A., and approved by him In its present form.

OHURCH OF GHR'IST, SOIEN'TlST
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
397
Christian Science is the religion founded by Mary Baker Eddy and represented
by the Church of Christ, Scientist. The Christian Science denomination was
founded by Mrs. Eddy at Boston in 1879, following her discovery of this religion
at Lynn, Mass., in 1866, and her issuing of its textbook, Science and Health with
Key to the Scriptures, in 1875.
For many years prior to 1866 Mrs. Eddy observed and studied mental causes
and effects. Profoundly religious, she was disposed to attribute causation to
God and to regard Him as divine Mind. In that year, she recovered almost
instantly from a severe injury after reading an account of healing in the Gospel
according to Matthew. The discovery of what she named Christian Science
ensued from this incident. As she has said, "I knew the Principle of all harmoni-
ous Mind-action to be God, and that cures were produced in primitive Christian
healing by holy, uplifting faith; but I must know the Science of this healing, and
I won my way to absolute conclusions through divine revelation, reason, and
demonstration." (Science and Health, p. 109.)
As her discovery developed in her thought, Mrs. Eddy demonstrated its im-
portance to mankind by many cases of healing and by teaching which equipped
students for successful practice. In due course, a distinct church became neces-
sary to facilitate cooperation and unity between Christian Scientists, to present
Christian Science to all people, and to maintain the purity of its teachings and
J?ractice. Accordingly, she and her followers organized the Church of Christ,
Scientist, "to commemorate the words and works of our Master" and to "reinstate
primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing." (Church Manual, p. 17.)
Mrs. Eddy passed away in 1910. Until then, she had initiated every step in
the progress of Christian Science. Although the organic law of the Christian
Science movement, its Church Manual, confers adequate powers upon an adminis-
trative board, The Christian Science Board of Directors, yet this board always
had functioned under her supervision. Mrs. Eddy's demise, therefore, tested the
Church Manual as an organic law in the absence of its author, but it has fulfilled
the most confident expectations. The period since 1910 has been the most fruitful
and prosperous in the history of Christian Science.
The primary source of information about Christian Science is Mrs. Eddy's
book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, first published in 1875 and
occasionally revised "only to give a clearer and fuller expression of its original
meaning." This book received from the author its final revision in 1907. Mrs.
Eddy is the author of other books on Christian Science, published from 1886 to
1913, which are collected in her Prose Works Other Than Science and Health and
her Poetical Works. Her writings can be found in many public libraries and in a1J
Christian Science reading rooms.
DOCTRINE
Christian Science is a religious teaching and practice based on the words and
works of Christ Jesus, which is applicable to health for the same reasons that the
Christian religion originally was. As defined by Mrs. Eddy, the religion she
founded is "divine metaphysics"; it is "the scientific system of divine healing";
it is "the law of God, the law of good, interpreting and demonstrating the divine
Principle and rule of universal harmony." (Science and Health, pp. 111, 123;
Rudimental Divine Science, p. 1.)
The theology of Christian Science begins with the propositions that God is
"Ali-in-all"; He is the "Divine Principle of all that really is." To define God
further, it employs frequently the word "good," besides such terms as Life,
Truth, Love, and Mind, Soul, Spirit. Next to God, the name of Jesus and
references to him occur most frequently in the authorized literature of Christian
Science. Concerning Jesus Christ and His relation to God and man, Christian
Science distinguishes between what is in the New Testament and what is in the
creeds, doctrines, and dogmas of later times. Accordingly, Christian Scientists
t This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 19~ has been revised by Clltlord P. Smith, editor of the bureau of history and records ofThe First
Church of vbrlst, Scientist, In Boston, Mass., and approved by him In Its present form.

speak of Him oftenest as the Master or the "Way-shower," and they regard the
atonement, His chief work, as "the exemplification of man's unity with God'
whereby man reflects divine Truth, Life, and Love." (Science and Health,
p. 18.)
The most distinctive feature of Christian Science teaching is its absolute
distinction between what is real and what is apparent or seeming, but unreal.
This distinction Mrs. Eddy explains, for instance, as follows : "All reality is in
God and His creation, harmonious and eternal. That which He creates is good,
and He makes all that is made. Therefore the only reality of sin, sickness, or
death is the awful fact that unrealities seem real to human, erring belief, until
"tod strips off their disguise. They are not true, because they are not of God."
(Science and Health, p. 472.)
. Contrary to common misapprehension, Christian Science does not ignore what
1t regards as unreal. This religion teaches its adherents to forsake and overcome
every form of error or evil on the basis of its unreality; that is, by demonstrating
the true idea of reality. This it teaches them to do by means of spiritual law and
spiritual power.
In this connection, Christian Science maintains that the truth of being-the
truth concerning God and man-includes a rule for its practice and a law by which
its practice produces effects. To a certain extent Jesus declared this rule and law
when he sa1d, "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free"
(John vm, 32). Accordingly, for an individual to gain his freedom from any form
of error or evil, he should know the truth, the absolute truth of being, applicable
to his case; and Christian Science further teaches that this practice is effective when
employed by one individual for another, because such is the unity of real being
and such is the law of God. For these reasons, evidently Jesus could and did
declare the possibility of Christian healing in unlimited terms. (See Matthew
X, 5-10 and XXVIII, 16-20; Mark XVI, 14-18; John XIV, 12.)
The practice of Christian Science is not merely mental; it must be also spiritual.
Indeed, it is truly mental only as it is absolutely spiritual. The nonspiritual
elements in the so-called human mind do not contribute to harmony or to health.
The practitioner must know or realize spiritually, and his ability to do this is
derived from the divine Mind. Therefore, he must agree with the Teacher and
Way-shower, who said, "I can of mine own self do nothing" (John v, 30), and he
must prepare for the healing ministry and keep himself in condition for it by
living the life of a genuine Christian. The practice of Christian Science is not
limited, as is commonly supposed, to the healing of the sick. On the contrary,
Christian Scientists regard their religion as applicable to practically every human
need.
Membership in this denomination is limited to those applicants who are at
least 12 years of age; not members of any other denomination; of Christian char-
acter; and who believe in and understand Christian Science according to the
teaching and tenets in its textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.
ORGANIZATION
Since its reorganization in 1892, the denomination has consisted of the Christian
Science Mother Church, the proper name of which is The First Church of Christ,
Scientist, in Boston, Ma.Ss., and branch churches or branch societies at all places
where there are enough adherents for a local organization. A branch church is
called First Church of Christ, Scientist, of its city or town, or is called Second
Church of Christ, Scientist, of that place, and so on. A society is the beginning
of a church, and is called Christian Science Society of its locality.
Viewed in another way, The Mother Church consists of members who consti-
tute the local congregation in Boston and of members who reside in other places
throughout the world, either where there are branch organizations or where there
are not. Thus, on December 31, 1936, The Mother Church had 255,563 members,
of whom 222,067 were in the United States (not including Canal Zone, Alaska,
Hawaii, and Philippine Islands) and 33,496 were in these possessions and in other
countries. At the same time, The Mother Church had 136,504 members in the
United States (as defined above) who were members of branch organizations. At
approximately the same time, 2,113 of the branch organizations in the United
States bad 183,352 members of whom 136,504 were members of The Mother
Church and 46,848 were not. Therefore, at the end of 1936, there were in the
United States (as defined above) 268,915 persons who were enrolled as members
in the Chri.itian Science denomination, or Church of Christ. Scientist.

CHURCH OF CHRIST, SCIENTIST 399
At the same time, there were enrolled in the Sunday schools of this denomina-
tion in the United States 139,758 pupils not more than 20 years of age, of whom
comparatively few were members of the church. The number of Christian Science
practitioners listed in The Christian Science Journal (official organ of The Mother
Church) was 10,994. In a sense, the Christian Science church can be said to
include a large number of persons who believe in Christian Science and attend its
servicesbor study the Bible with Mrs. Eddy's writings, but are not yet admitted
to mem ership; and the number of adherents who are not members is estimated
as exceeding the number who are.
The officers of The Mother Church consist of The Christian Science Board of
Directors, a president, the first and second readers, a clerk, and a treasurer. The
governing body of the denomination is The Christian Science Board of Directors,
but each branch church has its own self-government.
The lesson-sermon, which constitutes the principal part of the Sunday services
in Christian Science churches, is prepared by a committee connected with The
Mother Church and is read in every church by two readers who read alternately,
the first reader from Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, the second
reader from the Bible.
A Wednesday evening testimony meeting, conducted by the first reader, is like-
wise held, at which are given the testimonies of those who have been healed and
reformed by Christian Science. In addition to Sunday and Wednesday meetings,
the churches of this denomination provide public lectures on Christian Science
which are delivered by lecturers appointed by The Mother Church.
Besides Sunday schools for children, the educational system of the Christian
Science denomination includes the teaching of classes composed of adult students.
This is done by authorized teachers who have been instructed and certified for this
purpose by The Mother Church's Board of Education.
All of the activities of the Christian Science denomination are intended to
promote spiritualization of thought, together with the innumerable results thereof
which include Christian healing. In the healing of the sick, practiced for the
benefit of particular persons, the service rendered by healers or practitioners is
regarded as an individual ministry, subject only to a degree of regulation by the
church. The efficacy of Christian Science as a practical religion is attested by a
constantly increasing multitude of witnesses who can speak from personal
experience.
The following are the principal publications of The Christian Science Publishing
Society: The Christian Science Journal (a monthly in English including directories
of churches and practitioners); the Christian Science Quarterly (containing cita-
tions from the Bible and from the Christian Science textbook for Sunday services
and study, and published in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian,
Swedish, and revised Braille); the Christian Science Sentinel (a weekly in English);
The Herald of Christian Science (a monthl:y and quarterly in French, German,
Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, and Braille); and The Christian Science
Monitor (an international daily newspaper including articles on ChrisMan Science
translated into many languages).

State tables.-Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the Church of God
by States. Table 3 gives for each State for 1936 the number and membership of
the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural territory, mem-
bership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools. Table 4 gives for selected
States the number and membership of the churches for the three census years 1916
to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under 13 years of
age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the value of churches and
parsonages and the amount of debt on church edifices for 1936. Table 6 presents,
for 1936, the church expenditures, showing separately current expenses, im-
provements, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics
of any individual church, separate presentation in tables 5 and 6 is limited to those

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION I
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The denomination known as the Church of God had its origin in the convic-
tion of a number of people, in different denominations in Tennessee, that existing
bodies with which they were acquainted were not strictly in accord with their
views of Scripture, and in the belief that their wishes for a body conforming to
their own views must be satisfied. The first organization was formed in August
1886 in Monroe County, Tenn., under the name "Christian Union." In 1902
there was a reorganization under the name "Holiness Church," and in January
1907 a third meeting, at Union Grove, Bradley County, Tenn., adopted the
uame "Church of God," with a membership of 150, representing 5 local churches
• Tbls statement, which IS substantially the same as that published in vol. II of tbe Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. J. H. Walker, g~nrrnl owrseer of the Church of God, Cleveland,
'reno., and approved by him in its present form.
DigitiZed by GoogIe
CHURCH OF GOD 407
in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. From that time the body has
grown until it is represented in 45 States and has churches in 11 foreign countries.
The international headquarters in 1936 were in Cleveland, Tenn.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine this body is Arminian and in accord with the Methodist bodies.
It recognizes no creed as authoritative, but relies upon the Bible "as a whole
rightly divided" and as the final court of appeals. It emphasizes sanctification
as an experience subsequent to regeneration; also the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
evidenced by speaking in other tongues, subsequent to sanctification. Conditions
of membership are profession of faith in Christ, experience of being "born again,"
bearing the fruits of a Christian life, and recognition of the obligation to accept
and rractice all the teachings of the church. The sacraments observed are the
Lord s Supper, foot washing, and water baptism by immersion.
ORGANIZATION AND WORK
The ecclesiastical organization is described as "a blending of congregational and
episcopal, ending in theocratical," by which is meant that every question is to
be decided by God's Word. The pastor of the local church is the chief ruler,
and after conference with the board of deacons or councillors for the purpose of
ascertaining facts and general sentiment, he announces the decision of the board
of deacons or councillors, after which a vote is taken to determine the sentiment
of the church concerning the question.
The officers of the churches are bishops, deacons, evangelists, and exhorters.
Bishops and deacons must be at least 25 years of age, having experienced sancti-
fication and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, evidenced by speaking with other
tongues as the spirit gives utterance; and they must prove themselves to have
lived what they profess. There is no age limit for the evangelists and exhorters.
All are required to have a fair general education, good judgment, wisdom, and
ability to speak.
When a reasonable number of churches have been organized in a State an
annual State assembly is held, not legislative in character, but rather educational
and for the advancement and interest of the church in that State. A general
assembly epnvenes annually, and is composed of representatives from all States,
provinces, and countries; and this is recognized as the supreme council.
The foreign mission work of the church is under the direction of a mission board,
with the general overseer as ex officio chairman. The home mission work is
under the direc.tion of the State overseer, or superintendent and his council.
A general Bible school is being maintained for the education and the training
of the ministers together with a Bible training correspondence department. A
number of branch Bible schools are located in the various States of the Union.
The ~urch operates an orphanage and children's home at its headquarters at
Cleveland, Tenn. This home is under the supervision of the general overseer
and the orphanage committee.
The Church of God Evangel is the official organ of the church and is a weekly
periodical.
The Lighted Pathway, a monthly periodical, is the official organ of .the Young
People's Endeavor.
The church owns and operates a publishing house, printing its own Sunday
school literature, periodicals, and commercial printing.
The church maintains compensation for aged disabled ministers, also aid for
widows of deceased ministers. The direction of this matter is in the hands of
the 12 councillors with the general overseer as ex officio chairman.

The name Church of God is used by a number of small religious groups in the
United States, and this fact makes for confusion. This particular group some-
times attempts to differentiate itself from the others using this name by inserting
aThls statement was furnished by Dr. Earl L. Martin. professor of theology and Bible In the Anderson
Collep and Theological Seminary, Anderson, Ind. ·
DigitiZed by GoogIe
CHURCH OF GOD (ANDERSON, IND.) 415
the name of its headquarters (Anderson, Ind.), but regards such insertion as no
part of the name. At Anderson, Ind., are the offices of its general boards, its
college and seminary, its publishing plant, and other promotional organizations.
The group uses the name Church of God, which it holds as the Scriptural designa-
tion of the church, not in a denominational or exclusive sense, but in an inclusive
sense, as the name of the church to which all true Christians belong, and that a
recognition of this fact would be a big step forward in the direction of Christian
unity, and the name Church of God would then be applied to all Christians in all
the world.
From the beginning this group has regarded itself as a movement within the
church rather than another denomination or church among churches, working, as
it holds, for the restoration of the New Testament standard of faith and life,
particularly in the matter of church or Christian unity.
The movement began about 1880 when D. S. Warner, of the Church of God,
Winebrennerian movement, began to work in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois,
and other Midwestern States, and soon found others in various sections of the
United States who were possessed of like beliefs and ideals. They believed that
the church was too much restricted by human organization and ecclesiasticism and
demanded that the church be more directly under the rule of God. The move-
ment was strongly evangelistic and spread rapidly into many States. Consider-
able emphasis was put upon the doctrine of holiness, and in this the church held
many things in common with the various holiness movements of that period,
though in other respects differing from them.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine the Church of God would be classed orthodox and evangelical. The
members, in common with many groups of Christians, hold: The divine inspira-
tion of the Scriptures; that the Bible is a book at once divine and human; that it
grew out of human life in touch with God. They believe in the Holy Trinity;
that Chtist is the Son of God; that the Holy Spirit is a person, in His indwelling
presence in the heart of man, sanctifying and giving power for life and service;
that the Holy Spirit gives gifts for the work of God in the world, but that none or
all of these gifts are evidences of the presence of the Holy Spirit; that sin sepa-
rates men from God; in the forgiveness of ~>in on the basis of the atonement of
Christ and by repentance and faith on the part of the person; in the doctrine and
experience of holiness; in a personal second coming of Christ, that this coming has
no connection with a millennia! reign, but that the kingdom of God is here and
now; in the final judgment, the general resurrection of the dead, with reward of
the righteous and punishment of the wicked.
Generally, they practice baptism by immersion, the Lord's Supper, and feet
washing, but do not regard their practice as an essential basis of fellowship.
Perhaps their most distinctive doctrine is that concerning the nature of the church
and the unity of Christian people; that the church is the body of Christ, made up
of all Christians, and that all Christians are one in Christ Jesus, but the denomi-
nationalism and the sectarian system are a hindrance to the expression of this
unity, hence are unscriptural. They believe that God is working in this time to
restore the New Testament ideal of this church; and that this restoration is based
upon the fact of spiritual experience rather than of creedal agreement.
ORGANIZATION
The local churches of tho movement, numbering nonrly 2,000, are congrega-
tional in form of church government, and though they bold the ideal of God govern-
ing His church, they recognize that He does it through human instrumentality,
and that this government may be expreS8ed in any one of the many forms. Mem-
bership in the local churches is not on a formal basis, and there are no membership
lists kept, in accordance with the belief that being a Christian constitutes one a
member of the Church of God. In the business affairs of the local church other
qualifications must be met. The ministers of the various States meet in State or
regional conventions, but such associations are purely voluntary, and in no way
are invested with authority over local churches, but act in an advisory capacity.
The General Ministerial Assembly meets annually in connection with the annual
convention and camp meeting in June at Anderson, Ihd., which has jurisdiction
over the business and cooperative aspects of the work, but not in doctrinal matters
or over the local churches. Ministers are ordained by other ministers.

From the place of organization, the church spread first into the State of North
Carolina, where it went through the trials and difficulties common to all new
denominations. However, it multiplied and spread farther into several other
States, to the Bahama Islands, to Japan, and to South America.
In 1917 a difference of opinion arose among the members in regard to the
fundamental principles and teachings of the church and it divided into factions.
Later, one faction withdrew. The faction which claimed to adhere to the original
teachings and doctrines of the church adopted the word "original," as part of the
title and legally inserted it into the name of the denomination, which has since
been known as The (Original) Church of God, incorporated in 1922.
DOCTRINE
This denomination stands for the whole Bible, rightly divided. It believes in
and teaches repentance, justification, regeneration as defined by Martin Luther;
sanctification as set forth by John Wesley; divine healing for the body, not exclu-
sively, but does believe in praying for the sick; the premillennial second coming of
Jesus; eternal life for the righteous; and eternal punishment, with no liberation or
annihilation, for the wicked.
This church invites all persons who avow faith in Christ and live a Christian life
to become members. Christian fruits are taken as an evidence of Christian living
for "By their fruits ye shall know them." The only reason for exclusion is a known
violation of God's word, for each member is accountable to God. Conscience
binding creeds are regarded as being contrary to the Scripture and love.
It accepts pentecostal experience, when, under divine power of the Holy Ghost,
it speaks in other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance, as the disciples did on the
Day of Pentecost. (Acts 2: 4.)
All Christians who are eligible to vote, have a right to vote, remembering to
obey all laws that are not sinful to obey and if anyone is elected to an office to let
God rule Ju his heart and office.
The ordinances of the church are baptism by immersion, the Lord's Supper,
tithing, and freewill offerings.
ORGANIZATION AND WORK
This church, in its organization, is founded on the practices of the apostolic
church of God. Like the early churches, each individual organization takes
a local name, such as the Church of God at Corinth, etc. They have local
government, each church with its pastor, officers, and members having authority
to transact its own business, such as dealing with its own members, finances, and
church property.
It recognizes the orders of the ministry as given in the New Testament--
apostles, exhorters, evangelists, bishops (elder bishops), and teachers as given in
Eph. 4: 11-14. Any local church may recommend a person whom it believes to
be called of God and qualified for the ministry, and after an examination by the
presbytery, he may be ordained or licensed to preach.
A general convention meets annually in the autumn at Chattanooga, Tenn.
It is a delegated body in which all the churches are represented.
In connection with the usual work of evangelization, the church has a general
office and publishing house, located at Chattanooga, Tenn. This city is also the
location of the official headquarters of the denomination. Here a church manual,
various tracts and other church literature, as well as the official organ, The
(Original) Church of God Sunday School Weekly, are published.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
The Church of God (seventh day) was organized in separate church organiza-
tions in this country soon after the landing of the Pilgrims, who came here from
London, England, in 1620, at which time there were known to be seven local
churches in London.
In the year 1664 Stephen Mumford settled at Newport, R. L, having come from
England, and in 1671 a church was organized there with William Hiscox chosen
and ordained the elder. He served as pastor of the church until his death (1704)
when William Gibson became pastor, serving till1717. He was in turn succeeded
by Josep:h Crandall who held the pastorate until 1737. He was succeeded by
Joseph Maxen and he was followed by William Bliss, who remained pastor until
his death in 1808.
During this same period there were Churches of God established at the following
cities in Pennsylvania: Newton, Pennepeck, Jottingham, and French Creek.
These churches fraternized with the Churches of God in Rhode Island and others
in New Jersey. Some of the New Jersey churches were at Piscataway and Cohan-
sey. These are the oldest Sabbatarian churches in America. The Church
History of New England, 1783 to 1796, chapter 11, section 10, mentions Stephen
Mumford and his faith in connection with the Ten Commandments being the
Christian standard of a sinless life and of keeping Saturday instead of Sunday.
The oldest Sabbatarian Christian Church in America was connected with the
oldest in London-the Mill Yard Church-and on the old church records of this
church is found a copy of a letter dated December 21, 1680, addressed to·the
church in Newport, R . I., which proves their connection. There is much other
evidence in the records of both churches besides, which is set forth verbatim on
page 271 of The History of the True Church by Dugger and Dodd.
In the year 1705 a church was organized at Piscataway, N.J., and according
to a letter from Samuel Hubbard, one of the charter members of the Newport,
R. I., church, there was another church organized that year at Noodles Island,
now East Boston, Mass.
Thomas Ward, a prominent lawyer of Newport, R. 1., in 1689 was an out-
standing member of the Rhode Island church. Richard Ward, Governor of
Rhode Island, 1741-42, was a member of the church also. Col. Jobe Bennett in
1763 was the treasurer of this church and that year served on a committee in
drafting the constitution for the Brownsville University.
1 This statement was furnished by Elder A. N . Dugger, general overseer, the Chnrch of God (Salem,
W.Va.), Salem, W. Va.

424 CENSUS' OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, I936
One of the outstanding Churches of God in the early days of American history
was the church at Shrewsbury, N. J. Elder Davis was pastor of that church
early in the seventeenth century, and other churches in New Jersey were or-
ganized as this church branched out. For instance, the church at Piscataway was
organized in 1705 and at Hopewell at about the same time. The records of this
church are still to be found, and in Randolph's History of the Seventh Day
Baptists it is also mentioned as one of the early Sabbatarian churches in this
country. It was the Shrewsbury, N..J., church that went westward and settled
in Salem, W. Va., in 1789. It was called New Salem, Va., then and is now
Salem, W.Va. At this time there were churches organized at Lost Creek, W. Va.,
and at South Fork of Hughes River, W. Va.
Between the years 1845 and 1860 State conferences were formed and started
functioning in Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan,
New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and other States. Two gospel
tents were paid for and operated in the State of Iowa in evangelical meetings and
tents were also in operation in other State conferences during the summer months.
In the year 1861 a general conference convened at Battle Creek, Mich., and
voted to change the name, adopting the name Seventh-day Adventist, for various
reasons set forth by Mrs. E. G. White, a supposed prophetess of the denomination.
Because of the undaunted faith in the leadership of their prophetess, many of
their leaders recommended the change in all parts of the country and the great
majority of the ministers followed the decision of the church, but there was a
remnant who refused to sanction this name in the place of the Scriptural name,
"Church of God" mentioned just 12 times in the New Testament. Consequently
they called an assembly at Battle Creek, Mich., the following year and launched
a paper called the Remnant of Israel, printed monthly. This was later changed
to a weekly and the name changed to the Sabbath Advocate, and later to The
Bible Advocate, which is the present name of the publication. The church head-
quarters were transferred from Battle Creek, Mich., to Marion, Iowa, and the
paper issued from there for a number of years, then it was moved to Stanberry,
Mo. The name was changed from Sabbath Advocate to The Bible Advocate since
bein~~; printed at Stanberry, Mo.
The reorganizatiQ71.-In the fall a general meeting was called of many ministers
and leaders of the church to consider a reorganization of the body patterning it
more in accordance with the Bible organization. The meeting was called to
convene at Salem, W. Va., on November 4, 1933. Ministers and local elders of
congregations in many parts of the world were invited to attend or submit names
of ministers favoring the reorganization policy, and consequently there were 145
names submitted together with the company assembled. These names were used
in choosing officers, respectively, for the different offices according to the Scrip-
tural organization. There were 12 men chosen as spiritual leaders, known as
apostles (I Cor. 12: 28), and 70 for the elders, and then 7 business stewards
(Acts 6: 1 to 6).
It was unanimously voted at this gathering to move our world headquarters to
Jerusalem, Palestine, and all foreign fields to consider this the world headquarters,
as a work had previously been started at Jerusalem.
DOCTRINE
The doctrine of this body shall in all cases be according to the Holy Bible, and
inasmuch as the Scriptures clearly teach the following points of doctrine, the
same are listed as essentials of our faith: The Bible is inspired as no other writing
is, and is complete, infallible, and expresses God's will to man; Jehovah alone is
God, the Creator of the heaven, earth, the sea, and all therein; Jesus of Nazareth
was the only begotten Son of God, conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the
Virgin Mary, and is our Lord, Savior, and Redeemer; Jesus proved his Messiahship
by remaining in the tomb exactly 3 days and 3 nights, rising in the end of the
Sabbath; the Holy Spirit is the Comforter, which abides in the believer; Satan
is a personality and is an adversary of God and the children of God; man was
created perfect originally, but through disobedience fell, bringing imperfection,
death, and God's wrath upon mankind; the Christian's life must be patterned
after the example of the perfect man Christ Jesus; the inspired Bible name for
God's called out assembly is the "Church of God" ; the apostolic organization and
government is the only one taught in the Bible for the Church of God; experi-
mental religion, or religion personally experienced by the one regenerated by its
power, is the only safe one to trust in; repentance must be preached; conversion
is essential to salvation ; sanctification is commanded for the people of God;
immersion is for the remission of sins; there is efficacy in the prayer of the right-

eousj praler and anointing will save the sick; laying on of hands is to be practiced;
the Lords Supper is to be observed annually, on the beginning of the Passover,
the 14th of Nisan, and after the example of Jesus; we ought to wash one another's
feet; we should observe the seventh day of the week, from even to even, as the
Saboath of the Lord; the paying of the tithe of all increase is a continued obliga-
tion; all carnal warfare, and the participation therein, is condemned; the law of
the clean and unclean is still to be observed in this age; the habitual use of intoxi-
cating liquors, alcoholic stimulants, narcotics, tobacco, and any habit-forming
drug, is condemned; the perfection and continuality of the law of God, the Ten
Commandments, should be taught; sin is the transgression of the law; justifica-
ti,on from sin is through Christ alone; the return of Jesus Christ will be literal,
visible, personal, and is imminent; the throne of David will be established at
Jerusalem in the person of Jesus Christ; the institution of the kingdom of heaven
is at the return of Jesus; judgment is upon the house of God during the gospel
age; the righteous are resurrected and rewarded at the coming of Jesus; the meek
shall inherit the earth and dwell therein forever; there ·shall be a final regather-
ing of the dispersed nation of fleshly Israel; the dead are unconscious; the wicked
dead are resurrected to final judgment, and not to probation; the wicked are
eternally destroyed; the third angel's message is a present-day message, and will
continue to the advent of Jesus; and the seven last plagues are literal, and fall
at the termination of this gospel age.
ORGANIZATION
This body retains the apostolic form of the primitive church and consists of:
The Twelve, The Sevooty, The Seven, the elders, the overseers, the helpers, and
the disciples.
The Twelve have the oversight over the body of believers as a whole; The
Seventy give themselves to the evangelistic ministry of the Word; The Seven
have general oversight and management of the business of the church; the elders
give themselves to the ministry of the Word and to prayers; the overseer under
the supervision of The Twelve has general care over the church as a whole and
has assistant overseers to care for the affairs of the church in States, territories,
or various countries, as the need may require; the helpers give themselves to the
advancement of the work and the truth, as the Lord has given them talents and
opportunities; and the disciples give themselves wholly into the Lord's hands
to use as He will.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY AND DOCTRINE
To distinguish this Church of God from others of a similar name it has been
the custom of this body to add the name of the general overseer to the title,
thus-(Tomlinson) Church of God. The name of the general overseer is no part of
the name of the church and the name of the church remains as the Bible gives
it-Church of God.
There are no creeds connected with the (Tomlinson) Church of God, but only
the whole Bible, rightly divided, with the New Testament as the only rule of
faith and practice. This principle was followed until the year 1922, when a
division occurred in the Church of God as a result of an attempt to abrogate the
constitution which had been adopted in 1921. This division was very grievous
to all concerned, and loyal members discarded the constitution and continued
with the original principles and government. Since that time the growth of
the body holding to the original doctrine, faith, and practice has been quite
healthy and successful.
ORGANIZATION
A General Assembly was called in 1906 to correspond with the early Church
Assembly at Jerusalem. It has been the practice to hold an annual assembly
and feast ever since that time. These feasts, which continue for 7 days, are
held in Cleveland, Tenn., and many members from foreign countries attend, as
well as persons from nearly every State in the United States.
According to the latest estimates there are 177 bishops, 163 deacons, 707 male
evangelists, and 467 female evangelists, and approximately 1,000 local churches.
The purpose of this organization is the spread of the glorious gospel of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, to every creature in the whole wide world, and fulfill the
prophecies of Scripture for the last days, and make special preparation for the
return of the same Christ who went away while His followers watched as He
ascended. Then will come the fulfillment of the story of the angels who sang
at His birth-"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
men." Luke 2: 14.
t This statement was prepared from Information furnished by A. J. Tomlinson. general overseer, (Tom
IInson) Church of God, Cleveland, Tenn.

In the latter part of the year 1896 WilliamS. Crowdy, a Negro employed on the
Santa Fe Railroad as a cook. claimed to have a vision from God, calling him to
lead his people to the true religion and giving him prophetic endowment. He
immediately gave up his employment, leaving his home in Guthrie, Okla6went
into Kansas, and soon after organized the Church of God and Saints of hrist,
November 1896, at Lawrence, Kans. At first only a few persons joined him, but
the numbers increased rapidly. In 1900 the headquarters were removed to
Philadelphia, Pa. He was appointed bishop of the new body, and a white man
who was associated with him was subsequently raised to the same office.
In September 1900 the first annual assembly convened, officers were appointed,
the church constitution drawn and adopted, a.nd the Daughters of Jerusalem and
Sisters of Mercy organized, and its constitution approved. The districts were
made.
In 1904 the general officers' ranks were completed, naming Bishop Albert
Christian to the African Continent, as its presiding bishop. Under his guidance
thousands joined and the church prospered. At his death his successor. Bishop
John M. Sykenia, was called to the African post.
During the Passover session of 1906 the founder, Prophet William S. Crowdy,
named the following: Chief Evangelist, Joseph W. Crowdy as chief speaker over
all pulpits; Evangelist, William H. Plummer; Grand Father Abraham, general
business manager of said church; also, Elder Calvin S. Skinner, counsellor of the
said body; giving them full authority to act at all times as designated.
In the summer of 1908 WilliamS. Crowdy died, leaving those here mentioned
to assume leadership in the order named.
Joseph W. Crowdy and William H. Plummer were ordained to the bishopric
by the presbytery, at the district annual assembly held at Washington, D. C., in
1909. The following year, James W. Brent and Thomas C. Person were elevated
to the bishopric of the Southern and Western districts, respectively. Joseph W.
Crowdy was a successful leader from August 190R to January 1917, when death
claimed him.
His successor, Bishop William H. Plummer, being a business man, was successful
in the redemption of the church's lands at Belleville, Va. (This land was first
purchased by the founder as early as 1902.) Headquarters were moved to Belle-
ville in 1917. Bishop Plummer enjoyed a large following, with churches reaching
from coast to coast. He established churches in the West Indies Islands with
Evangelist H. L. Chase as their overseer, while the African churches were guided
by Evangelist Matashaka as their overseer.
Elder Calvin S. Skinner followed in the procession of leaders in December 1931
when Bishop William H. Plummer passed from this life at Belleville, Va. Elder
t This statement, which is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Bishop H. Z. Plummer, of the Church of God and Saints of Christ, and
approved by him in its present form.

Calvin S. Skinner held the coveted position but a very short time, being the last
one named by the founder. He appointed and acclaimed Elder Howard Z.
Plummer cardinal head and leader of the said church to fill all the offices and
granting him all authority_given his predecessor, Bishop William H. Plummer,
by the founder, Prophet WilliamS. Crowdy. Elder Calvin S. Skinner held the
leadership from December 1931 to February 1932, when he passed from this life.
Bishop H. Z. Plummer, the present head and leader, is active in all walks of life
to bring the ideals set forth by his predecessors and founder of the church to a
glorious success; he is ever alert, looking forward to the advancement of the work,
being guided by the divine hand. He has broadened the social status of the
body and has added two to the bishopric, namely, August M. Crowdy, the son of
the late founder, Prophet William S. Crowdy; and Howard L. Chase as bishop,
with the West Indies and South America as his diocese.
DOCTRINE
Preamble: We, the Church of God and Saints of Christ of the United States and
its jurisdiction, do declare all persons as members of the Church of God, after
having repented of their sins and being baptized by burial into the water upon
confession of faith in Christ Jesus, and having received the unleavened bread and
water for Christ's ·body and blood, their feet washed by the elder, as written in
St. John 13: 1-23, having agreed to keep the Ten Commandments and having
been breathed upon with a holy kiss, also being taught how to pray, as it is written
in Matt. 6: 9-13. We do try to perpetuate a union among the Saints of Christ
and maintain a correspondence with all other Churches of God and Saints of Christ
throughout the United States and the whole world. We therefore purpose to
maintain and keep the Commandments of God and the sayings of Jesus, according
to the doctrine of the Bible.
Believing that the Negro race is descended from the 10 lost tribes of Israel,
the prophet taught that the Ten Commandments and a literal adherence to the
teachings of the Bible, including both the Old and the New Testaments, are
man's positive guides to salvation. In order, however, that the faithful may make
no mistake as to the commandments which they are to follow, a pamphlet has
been published by the church under the direction of the prophet, called the
"Seven Keys," which includes Bible references giving the authority for the
various customs and orders of the church. Among these customs are the observ-
ance of the Jewish calendar and feast days, especially the Jewish Sabbath, and
the use of the corresponding Hebrew names.
ORGANIZATION
The organization of the church centers in an executive board or council, called
a presbytery, consisting of 12 ordained elders and evangelists, whose duty it is
to look after the general business of the church. The prophet, who is presiding
officer both of the executive board and of the church, is not elected but holds his
position by virtue of a divine call. He is believed by his followers to be in direct
communication with the Deity, to utter prophecies by the will of God, and to
perform miracles. On his death the prophetic office lapses until a new vision
appears.
There are district annual and general assemblies, composed of the different
orders of the ministry, and including delegates from each local church or taber-
nacle. The ministerial order includes ministers not in full ordination, elders fully
ordained, evangelists (elders engaged in general missionary work), and bishops,
the last mentioned not exceeding four in number. The ministers hold office during
good behavior. The temporal affairs of the church are cared for by deacons under
general supervision of the assemblies. The Church of God and Saints of Christ is
the name of all local churches. They are designated in each State by tabernacle
numbers, the first one in the State, number one, the next number two and so on.
WORK
For the support of the ministry, including the prophet, tithes are collected
as well as freewill offerings, and the district assemblies are required to establish
storehouses for the tithes. From these storehouses groceries and other neces-
saries of life are sold to the members, the net receipts being used to supplement the
tithes contributed for the support of the ministers in the work.
The church is a strong advocate of temperance, refusing even to use wine in
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. It allows marriage only within the circle

of the faithful, except by special permit, and exercises a rigid censorship over all
printed matter, permitting only that to be used which receives the approval of
the publishing house, and referring the decision of all disputed points to the
Bible.
One of the main auxiliaries of the church is an organization known as the
Daughters of Jerusalem and Sisters of Mercy. It is the duty of this organization
to look out for straying members; to attend to the comforts and welfare of the
sick and needy and, as missionaries, to help forward the gospel; to devise plans
and assist in finding means to care for the orphans; and to attend to the comfort
and welfare of the members of sister churches of the organization, who may
chance to be visiting the place in which the tabernacle is located.
The church maintains a home at Belleville, Va., for aged widows and orphans
and the Belleville Industrial School (first time reporting in 1936), which are
supported and sponsored through contributions and freewill offerings. The
church, an advocate of humanitarianism regardless of race or creed, encourages
endowments for the furtherance of the cause of humanity. The home was
first conceived in the mind of the founder, when a small tract of land was pur-
chased. Fitting so greatly, other tracts, which comprise nearly 850 acres, were pur-
chased by the late Bishop William H. Plummer in 1918, and the tract known as
Belleville came into prominence. Belleville is located in an agricultural region,
famous for its production of truck crops, and it is in close proximity to great
fields of cotton, peanuts, and other farm crops, as well as to the many and varied
industries centered in Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Newport News, Va., and
other Hampton Roads communities.
Seeing the dire need of a school for the education of the orphan youth, Bishop
William H. Plummer shouldered the ardent task and incorporated the present
institution, known as the Belleville Industrial School. This institution is non-
sectarian, reaching forth to help those most in need of its graces. Its curriculum
at present reaches the junior high school. Plans have been drawn for its new
administrative, school, and dormitory buildings, with a class A high school as
its goal.
The Belleville Industrial School and Widows and Orphans Home, Incorporated,
is a private corporation, without capital stock, having been chartered and or-
ganized under the laws of the State of Virginia in 1921, with its principal office
located at Belleville, county of Nansemond, Va., and is managed by a board of
trustees consisting of 25 members.
The purpose of the corporation, as named in its certificate of incorporation,
is as follows:
1. To establish, own, conduct, and operate a school where students may ob-
tain, on such terms and in such manner as may be deemed advisable and per-
mitted by law, a general education and courses of instruction in agriculture,
business, trades, and profes&ions.
2. To establish, own, conduct, and operate a widows and orphans home (or
homes) for the care, maintenance, and relief of indigent widows, orphans, and
other poor, needy, or homeless persons.
3. To acquire, take, hold, and own all such property, both real and personal,
including stocks and bonds of other corporations, as may be acquired by gift,
purchase, devise, or bequest, and use, operate, enjoy, and dispose of the same for
its benefit in such manner as may be deemed advisable and permitted by law.
4. To do any and all lawful acts and things whatsoever which may be incidental
to or neceasary for the accomplishment of the purposes hereinbefore mentioned.
In conformity with our charter we are putting forth this special effort to raise
sufficient money to renovate our present buildings (18 in number) to pay off
our indebtedness and to erect the new school building and four dormitories to
improve the condition of our institution. It is hoped that we will be sufficiently
successful to complete this program in 2 years, together with our regular budget.
This will enable us to extend the benefits offered by this institution to a greater
number of widows and orphans. Not only in the community where our institu-
tion is located, but in every State of the United States, we do propose to operate
a charitable agency in the interest of widows and orphans. A fund is to be
provided through the medium of solicitation, and a certain percentage of all
monies received in each State will be retained for widows and orphans of that
State wherein these collections are made.
Athletics are encouraged as in all noted institutions of learning for the develop-
ment of the youth. A seminary has been planned to follow in pursuit of uni-
versity degrees.

IUSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
The founder and organizer of the Church of God in Christ was Elder C. H.
Mason, a Negro who had received his early training in the Baptist Church. He
found his own beliefs at variance with the teachings of the Baptist faith, and with
Elder C. P. Jones and others sought to establish a church with stronger appeal
and greater encouragement for all Christian believers, one which would empha-
size the doctrine of entire sanctification through the outpourings of the Holy
Spirit. These brethren formed a body which was known as the Church of God.
In 1897 while seeking a Scriptural name which would distinguish this church
from others of similar title, the name "Church of God in Christ" was revealed
to Elder Mason.
This union continued until 1906, when a great revival was held in Los Angeles,
Calif. Elder Mason attended this revival and received the baptism of the Holy
Ghost with signs of speaking with other tongues.
He preached this as a New Testament doctrine, to which many of the brethren
were averse. As a result of this disagreement, in the general assembly which
convened at Jackson, Miss., in August 1907, Elder Jones and the assembly
withdrew.
Later in the same year Elder Mason called a meeting in Memphis, Tenn., of
all ministers who believed in receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost according
to the Scriptures and these brethren formed the first general assembly of the
Church of God in Christ. Elder Mason was called as general overseer and chief
apostle. Under his leadership the church has witnessed a great triumph and
growth.
DOCTRINE
The church is trinitarian in doctrine, acknowledging its belief in God in three
persons. It accepts the Bible as the Word of God and teaches repentance,
regeneration, justification, and sanctification. The church believes in the power
of speaking with new tongue!' and gifts of healing as evidences of the baptism of
the Holy Spirit.
Three ordinances are recognized-baptism of believers by immersion, the
Lord's Supper, and washing of the feet of the saints.
ORGANIZATION
The Church of God in Christ claims to be divinely instituted and to trace
authority for all its offices directly to the Scriptures.
The organization includes the following: The chief apostle (or general overseer),
apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, elders, overseers, teachers, deacons,
deaconesses, and missionaries.
Each local church has its overseer; the groups of churches are united, under a
State overseer who holds district or State convocations annually. Matters in
dispute are adjusted by the State overseers in consultation with two or more
elders, but only upon application of the local churches. This body also assigns
the pastors of churches.
A general convocation also meets annually and takes up questions referred to
it by the State overseers and elders of the State convocations.
The women's work is well organized under a body called "Mothers," general
and State. There are also Bible Bands, Sunshine Bands, and an organization
called the Young People's Willing Workers.
t This statement was prepared from information furnished by Bishop 0. T. Jones, of the Church of God
in Christ, Philadelphia, Pa.

CHURCH OF THE NAZARENE
STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classi:fication.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Church of the Nazarene for the year 1936 is
presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures between
urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent
directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the
data relate to these churches only.
The membership of the Church of the Nazarene consists of those persons who
have been publicly received, after having declared their experience of salvation,
belief in the doctrines of the church, and willingness to submit to its government.
Baptism by sprinkling is generally accepted, though no special form is emphasized.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
I. Near the close of the nineteenth century, a movement for the spread and
conservation of Scriptural holiness in organized church form developed almost
simultaneously in various parts of the United States. This movement was
similar to that of the previous century historically known as the Wesleyan re-
vival. There was manifested everywhere a spontaneous drawing in the unity of
the Spirit toward closer affiliation of those of like precious faith which finally
culminated in the organization of the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene.
The great impulse of this movement has been the emphasis placed by the
Scriptures upon the fact that, in the atonement, Jesus Christ has made provision
not only to save men from their sins, but also to perfect them in love.
II. On May 12, 1886, a number of the brethren in Providence, R. I., interested
in promoting the Wesleyan dortrine and experience of entire sanctification, or-
ganized and held weekly reli~ious services, first in private homes, but, after a few
months, in a rented store on Oxford Street. On January 16, 1887, a Sunday
school was organized with 95 members. On July 21, 1887, the People's Evan-
gelical Church was organized with 51 members, Rev. F. A. Hillery acting as pastor.
On November 25, 1888, the Mission Church, Lynn, Mass., was organized with
Rev. C. Howard Davis as pastor. On March 13 and 14, 1890, representatives
from these churches and other evangelical holiness organizations in southern New
England, assembled at Rock, Mass., and organized the Central Evangelical
Holiness Association. Rev. W. C. Ryder, pastor of the Independent Congrega-
tional Church of that place, was elected president. Within the following year
the Mission Church, Malden, Mass., the Emmanuel Mission Church, North Attle-
boro, Mass., and the Bethany Mission Church, Keene, N. H., were organized.
In January 1894 William Howard Hoople, a businessman in New York City,
founded a mission in Brooklyn, which, in the following May, was organized as
an independent church, with a membership of 32, and called Utica Avenue Pente-
costal Tabernacle. A church edifice was afterward erected, and Mr. Hoople
was called to the pastorate. The following February the Bedford Avenue Pente-
costal Church was organize<1 in an abandoned church building, and a little later,
the Emmanuel Pentecostal Tabernacle. In December 1895 delegates from these
three churches formed the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America,
adopting a constitution, a summary of doctrines, and bylaws. This association
was duly incorporated. Associated with Rev. William Howard Hoople in this
work were Rev. H. B. Hosley, Rev. John Norberry, Rev. Charles BeVier, and
Rev. H. F. Reynolds.
On November 12, 1896, a joint committee from these two associations met in
the city of Brooklyn, N. Y., to formulate some plan of union. For the benefit of
the counsel and cooperation, several brethren prominent in the work were invited
to act with the joint committee. Among this number were Rev. C. Howard
Davis, Rev. G. W. Wilson, Rev. John Norberry, Rev. H. F. Reynolds, Rev. H.
B. Hosley, and Rev. Charles H. BeVier. This meeting resulted in the union of
the two bodies. It was agreed that the work should be continued under the
name of the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America.
III. In October 1895 a number of persons, under the leadership of Rev. Phineas
F. Bresee, D. D., and Rev. J. P. Widney, LL. D., formed the First Church of the
Nazarene, at Los Angeles, Calif., with 135 charter members. They adopted
statements of belief, and agreed to such general rules as seemed proper and need-
ful for their immediate guidance, leaving to the future the making of such pro-
visions as the work and its conditions might necessitate. As a result of this
organization, a number of churches sprang into existence, reaching as far east as
Chicago.
IV. As these two bodies came to know more of each other, it was felt that they
should unite; and, after consultation by delegates from one body to the other, the
following basis of union was prepared and unanimously adopted by both bodies.
The first union assembly was held in Chicago, in October 1907.
Basis of Union.-It is agreed that the two churches are one in the doc-
trines considered essential to salvation, especially the doctrines of jus-
tification by faith and entire sanctification subsequent to justification,
also by faith, and, as a result, the precious experience of entire sanctifi-
cation as a normal condition of the churches. Both churches recognize
• This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. E. J. Fleming, general church secretary, Church of the Nazarene,
Kansas City, Mo., and approved by him In Its present form.

that the right of church membership rests upon experience; and that
persons who have been born of the Sfirit are entitled to its privileges.
We are agreed on the necessity o a superintendency, which shall
foster and care for churches already established, and whose duty it shall
be to organize and encourage the organizing of churches everywhere.
We are agreed that authority given to superintendents shall not
interfere with the independent action of a fully organized church, each
church enjoying the right of selecting its own pastor, subject to such
approval as the general assembly shall find wise to institute; the elec-
tion of delegates to the various assemblies; the management of their
own finances; and of all other things pertaining to their local life and
work.
It is agreed that any church of the Association of Pentecostal Churches
of America going into this organization which may feel it imperative
with them to continue to hold their property in like manner as at present,
shall be at liberty to do so.
It was agreed that the name of the united body should be, "The
Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene."

V. In 1894 the first organization of the New Testament Church of Christ was
effected by Rev. R. L. Harris, at Milan, Tenn., with 14 members. This church
was deemed necessary to conserve the work of holiness, and soon spread through-
out western Texas and Arkansas. Prominent among the leaders was Mrs. Mary
Lee Harris (now Mrs. Cagle), the wife of Rev. R. L. Harris, who took up the
work after the death of her husband.
In 1898 the first holiness churches were organized in Texas by Rev. Thomas
Rogers and Rev. Dennis Rogers, who came from California.
In 1900 the first Independent Holiness Church was organized by Rev. C. B.
Jernigan, at Van Alstyne, Tex., and the denomination grew and prospered until,
in 1903, there were 20 church organizations.
The legal representatives of the Independent Holiness Church and the New
Testament Church of Christ met at Rising Star, Tex., in November 1904, where
a joint committee framed a manual and statement of doctrine and basis of union.
The union was fully consummated at Pilot Point, Tex.J. in November 1905, and
the united body adopted the name Holiness Church of vhrist.
VI. At the general assembly of the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene, at
Chicago, in 1907, in response to an invitation, several persons were present from
the Holiness Church of Christ. Some of these were appointed to attend; but
were not authorized to take any action with reference to organic union. The
assembly invited them into counsel, and provisional arrangements were made
for incorporating this church into the general body, upon proper action on their
part. Upon the invitation of the Holiness Church of Christ, the second general
assembly convened at Pilot Point, Tex., at 2 o'clock, Thursday afternoon, October
8, 1908. On the following Tuesday morning, R. B. Mitchum moved: "That the
union of the two churches be now consummated," and the motion was seconded
by Rev. C. W. Ruth. Rev. John N. Short, J. B. Creighton, C. B. Jernigan,
H. B. Hosley, P. F. Bresee, and others spoke favorably to the motion. The
motion was adopted by a unanimous rising vote, amid great enthusiasm, at 10:40
a.m., Tuesday, October 13 1908.
VII. In the year 1898 Rev. J. 0. McClurkan and a few of God's children
called a meeting of the holiness people of Tennessee and adjacent States to be
held in Nashville. At this convention an association was formed known as the
Pentecoetal Alliance, which name was afterward changed to the Pentecostal
Mission. From the beginning these people were evangelistic in spirit, having
a burning desire to disseminate the doctrine and experience of sanctification;
hence there came together in different sections of the Southland groups of holi-
ness people, known as bands of the Pentecostal Mission. They were decidedly
missionary in spirit, and soon were sending their representatives to "the regions
beyond." Throughout their career they have been characterized by this mis-
sionary zeal.
At different times the question of the union of the Pentecostal Mission with the
Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene had been discussed, and on February 13,
1915, this union was effected at Nashville, Tenn., thus uniting both the home and
the foreign work of the Pentecostal Mission and the Pentecostal Church of the
Nazarene.
VIII. In November 1901 the first stage in the present holiness church move-
ment in the British Isles began, when Rev. George Sharpe, who had been for
over 13 years a preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church, accepted a call to
DigitiZed by GoogIe
460 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
the Congregational Church at Ardrossan, Scotland. In September 1905 he was
accepted as the minister of Parkhead Congregational Church, Glasgow, Scotland,
where, after a strenuous, successful, and glorious ministry of 13 months, he was
evicted for preaching Bible holiness.
On September 30;. 1906, the first services of the first distinctively holiness church
were held in the ureat Eastern Roads Hall, Glasgow. The charter members
numbered 80. Other churches were organized and became the Pentecostal Church
of Scotland. Visits of Dr. E. F. Walker and Dr. H. F. Reynolds to Scotland, and
a visit of Rev. George Sharpe and Mrs. Sharpe to the fourth general assembly, at
Kansas City, Mo., led the way to union with the Church of the Nazarene, which
was consummated in November 1915.
IX. The general assembly of 1919, in response to memorials from 35 district
assemblies, changed the name of the organization to "Church of the Nazarene."
X. For many years a holiness movement had been develoJ>ing in Minnesota,
the Dakotas, and Montana. It was originated by a group of Methodist laymen,
and formally organized at Jamestown, N. Dak., in 1907, as The Laymen's Holiness
Association. Rev. J. G. Morrison was its first president and leading evangelist.
With him were associated Rev. Ira E. Hammer, Rev. S. C. Taylor, Rev. W. G.
Bennett, and over 20 other evangelists and workers engaged in a widespread
program of holiness evangelism and camp-meeting promotion. In 1922 more
than 1,000 people who were identified with The Laymen's Holiness Association,
under the leadership of these ministers, united with the Church of the Nazarene.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine the Church of the Nazarene is essentially in accord with historic
Methodism. It stands for apostolic purity of doctrine, primitive simplicity of
worship, and pentecostal power in experience, it being generally regarded that the
primary dispensational truth is that Jesus Christ baptizes believers with the Holy
Spirit, cleansing them from all sin and empowering them to witness the grace of
God to men. This church stands particularly for this truth and experience, which
the general assembly has expresseii in the following terms:
We believe that entire sanctification is that act of God, subsequent to
regeneration, by which believers are made free from original sin, or
depravity, and brought into a state of entire devotement to God, and the
ho!Y obedience of love made perfect.
It is wrought by the baptism with the Holy Spirit, and comprehends
in one experience the cleansing of the heart from sin and the abiding, in-
dwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, empowering the believer for life and
service.
Entire sanctification is provided by the blood of Jesus, is wrought
instantaneously by faith, preceded by entire consecration; and to this
work and state of grace the Holy Spirit bears witness.
This experience is also known by various terms representing its dif-
ferent p,hases, such as "Christian perfection," "perfect love," "heart
purityc' "the baptism with the Holy Spirit," "the fullness ofthe blessing,"
and " hristian holiness."
The Church of the Nazarene recognizes that the right and privilege of men to
church membership rests upon their bei~g regenerate, and would require only such
statements of belief as are essential to Christian experience and the maintenance
of that condition. Whatever is not essential to life in Jesus Christ mav be left
to individual liberty of Christian thought. That which is essential to Christian
life lies at the very basis of their associated life and fellowship in the church, and
there can be no failure to believe this without forfeiting Christian life itself, and
thus the right of all church affiliation.
While emphasizing the baptism with the Holy Spirit as a definite experience
of divine grace, the Church of the Nazarene never has taught, nor does it now
teach, or countenance teaching, that speaking in tongues is a manifestation
attendant upon, or an evidence of, the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
While standing especially for the great dispensational truth that Jesus Christ
baptizes believers with the Holy Spirit, cleansing them from all sin, the Church
of the Nazarene also emphasizes the great cardinal doctrines of Christianity.
Briefly stated, the Church of the Nazarene believes:
DigitiZed by GoogIe
CHURCH OF THE NAZARENE
(1) In one God-the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; (2) in the plenary
inspiration of the Old and New Testament Scriptures, and that they
contain all truth necessary to faith and Christian living; (3) that man
is born with a fallen nature, and is, therefore, inclined to evil, and that
continually; (4) that the finally impenitent are hopelessly and eternally
lost; (5) that the atonement through Jesus Christ is for the whole human
race; and that whosoever repents and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ
is justified and regenerated and saved from the dominion of sin; (6) that
believers are to be sanctified wholly, subsequent to regeneration, through
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (7) that the Holy Spirit bears witness
to the new birth, and also to the entire sanctification of believers; (8) in
the return of our Lord, in the resurrection of the dead, and in the final
judgment.
461
Applicants for membership in the church are received on the confession of
their faith in Christ and of their acceptance of the doctrines which the church
holds essential to salvation, and their agreement to observe the rules and regula-
tions that mark the conscience of the church.
The Church of the Nazarene believes in the Bible doctrine of divine healing,
and urges its people to offer the prayer of faith for the healing of the sick. Provi-
dential means and agencies when necessary are not to be refused.
Its position upon temperance and prohibition is stated in the following terms:
The Holy Scriptures and human experience alike condemn the use of
intoxicating drinks as a beverage. The manufacture and sale of intoxi-
cating liquors for s'uch purpo8es is a sin against God and the human race.
Total abstinence from all intoxicants is the Christian rule for the indi-
vidual, and total prohibition of the traffic in intoxicants is the duty of
civil government.
ORGANIZATION
The ecclesiastical organization is representative, thus avoiding the extremes of
episcopacy on the one hand and the unlimited congregationalism on the other.
Each loc,al church is governed through a church board elected by the congrega-
tion. The churches are associated for such general purposes as belong to all alike,
particularly for a world-wide missionary program. The churches in a particulai
area are united to form an assembly district, each local church being entitled to
representation in the district assembly. There are 45 such districts which hold
annual assemblies and elect district superintendents and district boards, license
and ordain ministers, commission evaMelists, and conduct such other work as
may be connected with their area. The 45 districts elect both ministerial and
lay delegates to the general assembly, which meets once in 4 years. The general
assembly elects general superintendents and other general officers and boards to
have oversight of general denominational a'ctivities.
Person8 a·re licensed to the gospel ministry litter having been examined by a
district assembly regarding their spiritual, intellectual, and other fitness for such
work. Further, ordination is by a council of the pastors and delegates, upon the
completion of a 4-year course of study, or its equivalent in college work. Minis-
ters from other denominations may be received on the vote of the district assembly
to which the application has been referred.
WORK
The general work in which the 45 districts unite with the churches composing
them is carried on under the head of home missions and evangelism, foreign
missions, publication, ministerial relief, education, young people's societies, and
Sunday schools.
The total amount of contributions for all purposes in 1936 is estimated at
$4,428,102, distributed as follows: Local interests, $3,777,210; district interests,
$322,721; general interests, $328,171.
The work conducted by the department of foreign missions includes missions
in southern Africa, India, Palestine, Syria, China, Japan, Argentina and Peru,
Central America, Mexico, Cape Verde Islands, and British West Indies. The
report for 1936 shows 30 stations occupied by 90 American missionaries and 462
native workers; 152 organized churches with 9,737 members; 273 Sunday schools
with an enrollment of 11,504 with 5,678 in average attendance; 85 schools with
1,823 pupils; 9 Bible training schools with 135 pupils enrolled; and 2 hospitals
and 9 dispensaries, treating during the year about 36,738 patients. The value of
property in the foreign field is estimated at $431,789.
The educational work is combined under five colleges and two junior colleges
in the United States. The schools have property valued at $1,240,858.

CHURCHES' OF CHRIST 469
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL IUSTORY
In their early history the churches which gathered under the leadership of
Thomas and Alexander Campbell, Walter Scott, and Barton W. Stone emphasized
the distinctively apostolic character of the individual church, not merely as a
worshiping congregation and a working force, but as an autonomous ecclesiastical
body. As set forth in the Declaration and Address, by Thomas Campbell, they
deplored human creeds and systems and protested against considerin~ anything
as a matter of faith and duty for which there could not be produced a ' Thus saith
the Lord," either in expressed terms, approved example, or necessary inference.
They also held that they should follow "after the example of the primitive church
exhibited in the New Testament without any additions whatever of human
opinions or inventions of men." With this basis of action they adopted as the
keynote of their movement, "Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where the
Scriptures are silent, we are silent."
As the churches increased in membership and wealth, however, there arose
what seemed to some to be a desire for popularity and for such "human inven-
tions" as had been deplored in the beginning of the movement. Chief among
these "inventions" were a general organization of the churches into a missionary
society, with a "money basis" of membership, and the use of mechanical instru-
mental music in the worship of the church. The agitation for the organization of
a missionary society began soon after 1840 and continued until the American
Christian Missionary Society was formed in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1849. Although
this movement received Alexander Campbell's approval, yet the literature of
that period abundantly shows that he was not the real leader behind the effort
nor the same man mentally who had previously opposed such inventions of men.
Many of his brethren were dissatisfied with this departure from the original ground
and held firmly to the earlier position, quoting his own language in speaking of
the apostolic Christians:
Their churches were not fractured into missionary societies, Bible societies,
and educational societies; nor did they dre~tm of organizing such. * * *
They knew nothing of the hobbies of modern times. In their church capacity
alone they moved. • * • They viewed the Church of Jesus Christ as the
scheme of salvation to ameliorate the world. As members of it they consid-
ered themselves bound to do all they could for the glory of God and the good
of men. They dared not transfer to a missionary society a cent or a prayer,
lest in so doing they should rob the Church of its glory and exalt the inven-
tions of men above the wisdom of God.
A society with a "money basis" and a delegated membership, it was urged,
was the beginning of apostasy from New Testament Christianity. The article
in the constitution of the missionary society which gave more offense than any
other, because, in the view of some, it established a "money basis" and created
a "moneyed aristocracy," read as follows: "The society shall be composed of
annual delegates, life members, and life directors. Any church may appoint a
delegate for an annual contribution of $10; and $20 paid at one time shall be
requisite to constitute a member for life." Various and earnest efforts were
made at different times to dissuade them from this "departure from New Testa-
ment Christianity," but without avail.
The question as to the use of instrumental music in the services of the church
became an issue as early as 1859, when a melodeon was placed in the church at
Midway, Ky. Much opposition was aroused, and the claim was made that
instrumental music in the church services "ministered to pride and worldliness,
was without the sanction of New Testament precept and example, and was conse-
quently unscriptural and sinful."
Other matters in regard to which there was controversy were the introduction
of the "modern pastor" and the adoption of "unscriptural means of raising
money."
It was inevitable that such divergencies of opinion should result in the forma-
tion of opposing parties, and these parties were variously called "Conservatives"
1 Tbls statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. li of the Report ou Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Leslie 0. Thomas, Churches of Christ, Dickson, Tenn., and approved by
him In Ita pr:esent form.

and "Progressives," or "Antis" and "Digressives." Actual division, however,
came slowly. Many who sympathized with the Progressives continued to wor-
ship and work with the Conservatives because they had no other church facilities;
and on the other hand, many Conservatives associated with the Progressives for
a similar reason.
In the census report for 1890 both parties were reported together under the
title, "Disciples of Christ." In the report for 1906 the Conservatives were re-
ported separately as "Churches of Christ," but the results were not altogether
satisfactory, as it was difficult to draw the line between them and the Disciples
of Christ. There is now a clear distinction between the two groups, and the
statistics for 1936 are far more complete.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine and polity the Churches of Christ are, in some respects, in accord
with the Disciples of Christ. They reject all human creeds and confessions,
consider the Scriptures a sufficient rule of faith and practice, emphasize the
"divine Sonship of Jesus" and the "divine personality of the Holy Spirit," and
regard the Lord's Supper as a memorial service rather than as a sacrament, to
be observed each Lord's Day. The church, with such officers as belonged to it
in apostolic times, is considered a divine institution. Each local church is inde-
pendent; it elects its own officers, calls its own ministers, and conducts its own
affairs. Membership is on the general basis of faith in Christ, repentance, and
baptism (immersion). The ministerial office is not emphasized, and there are no
ministerial associations. Each minister is a member of the church which he
serves, and is subject to its discipline. In general, the doctrine of nonresist-
ance is advocated.
WORK
The opposition to missionary societies on the part of the Churches of Christ
does not imply any lack of interest in missionary work, which has been fully
developed since the division. They arc rapidly establishing new churches in
different parts of the United States, and are carrying on missionary work in
Japan, China, Korea, Persia, Brazil, Hawaii, Philippine Islands, India, Africa,
Mexico, and other parts of the world.
The educational institutions of the Churches of Christ include 7 Bible, or
Christian, colleges, with 184 teachers, 2,206 students, and property valued at
$2,610,974. There are also several academies and professional schools; 7 orphan-
ages, with 833 children, and property valued at $496,001; and 2 homes for the
aged (1 takes children, too, and is not included in the orphanages), with 50
inmates and property valued at $500,000. These institutions are located in
Tennessee, Texas, Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Georgia, and California.
They publish eight monthly, two semimonthly, and three weekly journals
devoted exclusively to religious instruction.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio
for the year 1936 is presented in the following table, which shows the distribution
of these figures between urban and rural territory. The data given for 1936 repre-
sent 86 active organizations, all reported from the State of Ohio. These statistics
were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk
of the individual churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination consists of persons who have been
approved by the church officials.
The Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio were not reported prior to
1936, hence no comparative data are available.

The Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio trace their origin as an
independent ecclesiastical body to the year 1909 at the Council of the Christian
Union Churches which was held at Marshall, Ohio. A prominent breach was
present among the churches of this district. The point of controversy was over
holiness as a second definite work of grace subsequent to regeneration. The non-
holiness believers, being in the controlling power, enacted certain legislation to
put to death this true holiness group. But instead of dying this group, headed
by Rev. J. H. McKibban, withdrew by compulsion and took the present name,
Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio.
On October 27, 1909, a convention was held by this group at the Christian
Union Publishing House at Washington Courthouse, Ohio, over which Rev. E. S.
Cartright presided. At this convention a charter of the Churches of Christ in
Christian Union of Ohio was read and endorsed by the ministry and members
present. There was also a Declaration of Rights written and presented.
This group of Churches of Christ in Christian Union, no longer being members
of the Council of Christian Union Churches, were obliged to establish their own
council. The first council of the Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio
was held at Jeffersonville, Ohio, October 28 to 31, 1909. Rev. E. S. Cartright was
the moderator of this council. Annual councils have been held from that date
DOCTRINE
The Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio are fundamental in doctrine.
Regeneration; entire sanctification as a second definite work of grace, subseguent
to regeneration; divine healing; and the second coming of the Lord Je.'!us Christ
are the fundamental doctrines of the church.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the Churches of Christ in Christian Union of Ohio is based upott
the principle that each local church governs itself. The principle is very similar
to congregational form of government. The spiritual affairs of the church are
headed by the pastor, and first, second, and third elders. The business affairs
are headed by a board of trustees. Admission to church membership is by direct
application to the church through proper officials, "good fruits being the only
condition of fellowship," i. e., a personal experience of the new birth. Each local
church is a member of the General Council, which council in turn is controlled
by delegated power. All local churches, therefore, are subject to the General
Council. Ordination to the ministry is by the examining board of the General
Council.
WORK
The work of this body consists in the fulfillment of an inspired ambition to get
back to Christ and the autonomy, doctrines, and polity of the churches of Christ
of the first century. Its work embraces the salvation of the lost; the establishing
of new local assemblies of believers in Christ; home mission work; homes for the
orphans; foreign mission work, with active stations in India, Africa, and Mexico;
youth movements; fundamental religious training; and publishing interests.
A general conference and camp meeting ground has been established at Circle-
ville, Ohio.
There are at present a total of 86 churches with a combined membership of
several thousand, and property valuation of approximately a quarter of a million
dollars.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The organization known as Churches of God, Holiness, dates back to the year
1914, when Rev. K. H. Burruss began preaching the gospel of entire sanctifica-
tion to a little group of eight people at Atlanta, Ga. It was not until July 1916,
however, that the denomination was organized at Atlanta, by Reverend Burruss,
at which time large churches were established both at Atlanta and at Norfolk, Va.,
as the result of great revivals held in those cities. The denomination continued
to prosper until, by the year 1922, 35 churches had been established. These
churches were located in 11 States and in Cuba, the Canal Zone, and British
West Indies. In the year 1922 the churches were brought into a national organi-
zation, which is now known as the National Convention of the Churches of God,
Holiness.
The headquarters of this denomination are at Atlanta, Ga.
t No revision of history. doctrine, or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this statement
Is the same as that published in vol. II or the Repo~t on Religious Bodies, 1926.

CHURCHES OF GOD1 HOLlNESS 477
DOCTRINE
This denomination believes not only in the inspiration of the Scriptures but
that the New Testament is the standard by which all doctrine must be tested,
and that all rules of government for the churches are to be found therein. Fur-
thermore, it holds that the New Testament "gives safe and clearly aprlied
instructions on all methods of labor, sacred and secular, and all conduct o life
even to the innermost thoughts of the heart and impulses of the soul." It
acknowledges belief in the Trinity, in justification, sanctification, and regenera-
tion, and it holds that the gift of the Holy Ghost is an act subsequent to con-
version. It teaches both present and ultimate perfection. A belief in the
possibility of divine healing is a necessary qualification for membership. How-
ever, it is clearly stated in the discipline of the denomination that physicians
and medicines are not denounced in the Bible, but are approved for those who
desire them.
The ordinances of the church are baptism and the Lord's Supper. The form
of baptism is "burial in water and rising again." Although the washing of feet
is a practice which this denomination approves, "as obeying the Lord," it is not
a regularly observed ordinance of the church.
ORGANIZATION
The highest ecclesiastical body of this denomination, called the National Con-
vention, is a delegated body whose province it .is to elect the national president.
The State convention is next in rank and is held annually. A State overseer,
whose duty it is "to see that all churches under his jurisdiction shall be disci-
plined according to the New Testament Scriptures," is appointed by the national
president or bishop, who also assigns all pastors to the local churches. The
deacons are assistants to the pastor and hold office as long as their conduct
justifies it. There are five auxiliaries to the National Convention, the Christian
Women's Willing Workers, the Young People's Union, the Sunday school, the
Purity Club, and the Gospel Spreading Committee.
The official church paper is the Bethlehem Star.

480 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BOD!I'ES, 19 3 6
State tables.-Tables a, 4, 5, and 6 present the statistics for the General Elder-
ship of the Churches of God in North America by States. Table agives for each
State for 1936 the number and membership of the churches classified according to
their location in urban or rural territory, membership classified by sex, and
data for Sunday schools. Table 4 gives by States the number and membership
of the churches for the four census years 1906 to 19a6, together with the mem-
bership for 1936 classified as "under 1a years of age" and "13 years of age and
over." Table 5 shows the value of churches and parsonages and the amount of
debt on church edifices for 19a6. Table 6 presents, for 19a6, the church expendi-
tures, showing separately the amounts expended for current expenses, improve-
ments, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics of
any individual church, separate presentation in tables 5 and 6 is limited to those
States in which three or more churches reported value and expenditures.
Ecclesiastical divisions.-Table 7 presents, for each eldership of the General
Eldership of the Churches of God in North America, the more important statistical
data for 1936 shown by States in the preceding tables, including number of
churches, membership, value and debt on church edifices, expenditures, and Sunday
schools.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The revival movement which spread through the United States during the
early part of the nineteenth century was not felt as much in the Reformed as
in the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches. In one case, however, it
made itself apparent, and its fruits are seen in the denomination known as the
"General Eldership of the Churches of God in North America."
John Winebrenner was born in the Glade Valley, Woodsborough district,
Frederick County, Md., March 25, 1797, his parents being of German descent.
Baptized and confirmed in the German Reformed Church (now the Evangeli-
cal and Reformed Church), he early showed an inclination to the ministry,
and after completing a course at the district school, an academy at Frederick,
and Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., he went to Philadelphia to study theology
under Dr. Samuel Helfenstein. While here, on April 6, 1817, he passed through
a peculiar religious experience which he interpreted as sound conversion, and
from that moment the work of the ministry, which he had hitherto regarded with
more or less indifference, became "the uppermost desire of his heart."
On September 24, 1820, he was ordained in Hagerstown, Md. He then ac-
cepted a call to Harrisburg, Pa., with charge of three other churches, commencing
his work there October 22, 1820. He was earnest and energetic in his pulpit
ministrations, preached experimental religion, sought to raise the standard of true
piety, and organized Sunday schools and other church agencies. So searching
and impressive was his preaching that many of his hearers became seriousl7
alarmed about their spiritual condition. Revivals of religion were new expen-
ences in the churches of that region, so that his ministry early awakened strong
opposition. Some of the members of his charge became much dissatisfied, and
the matter was brought to the attention of the Synod of the Reformed Church,
which met at Harrisburg, September 29, 1822. The case was not finally disposed
of until some time in 1828, when Mr. Winebrenner's connection with the German
Reformed Church was finally severed.
After his separation from the Reformed Church his labors extended to sur-
rounding districts and towns and were attended by extensive revivals of religion.
Gradually his views changed on a number of doctrinal points and on the ordi-
nances or sacraments, and about 1825 he organized an independent church, calling
it simply the "Church of God." Others followed, both in and around Harris-
burg, each assuming the name of "Church of God at---." These churches,
in which all members had equal rights, elected and licensed men to preach, but
there was as yet no common bond, general organization, or directing authority.
Finally, for the purpose of adopting a regular system of cooperation, a meeting
was held at Harrisburg in October 1830, which was attended by six of the licensed
ministers. At this meeting an "eldership," to consist of an equal number of
teaching and ruling elders, was organized, which, to distinguish it from the local
church eldership, was called the "General Eldership of the Church of God."
The work continued to grow and spread to adjoining counties, to the State of
Maryland, and to western Pennsylvania and Ohio, where elderships were organ·
ized. On May 26, 1845, delegates from these three elderships met at Pittsburgh,
Pa., and organized the "General Eldership of the Church of God in North
America," which name was changed in 1896 to the "General Eldership of the
Churches of God in North America." The eldership in eastern Pennsylvania
dropped the word "General" and became the "East Pennsylvania Eldership of
the Church of God."
Missionaries were sent into the western States, and churches were organized
in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri,
Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma (including what was then Indian Territory),
Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. In nearly all these States annual elderships
have been organized, in cooperation with the General Eldership.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine the Churches of God are evangelical and orthodox, and Arminian
rather than Calvinistic. They hold, as distinctive views, that sectarianism is
anti-Scriptural; that each local church is a church of God and should be so called;
that in general, Bible things, as church offices and customs, should be known by
t This statement, which Is the same as that published In vol. II of Religious Bodies, 1926, has been
approved ID Its present form by Rev. J, 0. Weigle, Mechanicsburg, Pa., statistical secretary of this body.

Bible names, and a Bible name should not be applied to anything not mentioned
in the Bible; and that there are not two, but three, ordinances that are per-
petually obligatory, namely, baptism, the Lord's Supper, and the religious wash-
mg of the saints' feet. The last two they regard as companion ordinances, which
are always to be observed together and in the evening. The only form of baptism
recogtlized is the immersion of believers. They have no written creed but accept
the Word of God as their only rule of faith and practice. They insist strongly
on the doctrines of the Trinity, human depravity, atonement through the sacrifice
of Christ, the office and work of the Holy Spirit, man's moral agency, justification
by faith, repentance and regeneration, practical piety, the observance of the
LOrd's Day, the resurrection of the dead, the eternal being of the soul, and future
and eternal rewards and punishments.
ORGANIZATION
The organization of the churches is Presbyterian. Each local church vote.!
for a pastor, but the annual elderships make the appointments within their own
boundaries. The church elects its own elders and deacons, who with the pastor
constitute the church council and are the governing power, having charge of the
admission of members and the general care of the church work. The ministers
within a certain territory and an equal number of laymen elected by the various
churches (or charges) constitute annual elderships, corresponding to presbyteries,
which have the exclusive right to ordain ministers. Laymen, on recommenda·
tion of churches, may be licensed as exhorters. The different annual elderships
combine to form the General Eldership, which meets once in 4 years and is
composed of an equal number of ministerial and lay representatives elected
by the annual elderships.
WORK
The missionary activities of the Churches of God are under the control of the
Board of Missions of the General Eldership, composed of persons elected quadren-
nially. This board has charge of both the home and foreign mission work, the
former being principally in the Southwest.
The foreign mission work dates from October 1896, when the first missionary
sailed for India. The missionaries are stationed in Bogra and Ulubaria districts,
and the converts secured, the mission schools established, and the mission
buildings erected show a good degree of progress.
The educational work of the Churches of God, in its permanent form, began
in 1881, when Findlay College,,Findlay, Ohio, was incorporated. This institu-
tion has been constantly growing and now has a strong faculty, a large student
body, and over $300,000 endowment.
There is a publishing house at Harrisburg, Pa., worth over $100,000, with
$118,000 endowment, where the Church Advocate and other journals are
published.
The denomination celebrated its centennial in Harrisburg in 1925.

CHURCHES OF THE LIVING GOD
GENERAL STATEMENT
Under this head are included in 1936 two bodies of Negro churches, similar
in general type though differing in many details: The Church of the Living God,
Christian Workers for Fellowship, and the Church of the Living God, "The
Pillar and Ground of Truth."
The Church of the Living God, Christian Workers for Fellowship, was reported
in 1906 as Christian Workers for Friendship, having been organized at Wrights-
ville, Ark., in 1889, by Rev. William Christian. The name was changed to
Christian Workers for Fellowship in 1915. The Church of Christ in God, re-
ported in 1906, was afterwards consolidated with the Christian Workers for Fel-
lowship, from which it had seceded.
Other divisions from this church followed, which were consolidated in an or-
ganization perfected September 25, 1925, and known as the Church of the Living
God, "The Pillar and Ground of Truth." It was joined January 26, 1926, by
the Church of the Living God and the Church of the Living God, General Assem-
bly, which had previously united, December 1924, at Athens, Tex. These two
churches were reported separately in 1916; the Church of the Living God, General
A8Sembly, was returned as the Apostolic Church in 1906.
The denominations grouped under the name "Churches of the Living God" in
1936, in 1926, in 1916, and in 1906 are listed below, with the principal statistics
as reported for the four periods. Certain changes in names and organization,
as mentioned above, will be noted in more detail.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Church of the Living.God, Christian Workers for Friendship, was organized
at Wrightsville, Ark., in 1889 by Elder William Christian. In 1915 the name
Friendship was changed to Fellowship. Elder Christian was known as chief of
the organization. The ruling of Chief Christian was the law and power of the
chartered body. He and his wife, Ethel L. Christian, were known as the executive
heads of the church and nothing could be done without their approval. Chief
William Christian departed this life April 11, 1928, and the work of the Church
of the Living God, Christian Workers for Fellowship, automatically fell into the
hands of his wife, Ethel L. Christian, who has since officiated.
DOCTRINE
The distinctive characteristics of the church are-belief in baptism by immersion,
washing of the saints' feet, the use of water and unleavened bread for the Lord's
Supper, and many other fraternal points of doctrine known only to members of
the organization. The local organizations are known as temples, and are subject
to the authority of a general assembly. The presiding officer is styled the chief
or cbiefess, or whoever may be appointed by the executive head to act during the
meeting.
1 This statement, which Is substantlally the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religions
Bodi~1 1926, was revised by Ethel L. Christian, chlefess, Church of the Living God, Christian Workers
for Feuowship, and approved by her in its present form.

The seven ambassadors are assistants to the acting head, and they, with the
evangelists, are used for the work of church extension.
Bible schools occupy an important place in the life of the church. There ar11
auxiliaries engaged in works of mercy, particularly along the lines followed by
fraternal societies, rendering assistance in the care of the sick and the burying of
the dead.
One institution, located at Memphis, Tenn., is in operation and is known as the
House of Refuge.
There is also a home for widows past 65. This home stands, but is not operating

THE PILLAR AND GROUND OF TRUTH
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
497
This church, though shown under a new designation in 1926, is an outgrowth
of the body organized at Wrightsville, Ark., in 1889, by Rev. William Christian,
as the Church of the Living God, Christian Workers for Fellowship.
There had been a previous division, in 1902, of a group which called themselves
the Church of the Living God, Apostolic Church;_ these churches were organized
in 1908 by Rev. C. W. Harris, under the name ~hurch of the Living God, Gen-
eral Assembly. In 1925 a number of other churches withdrew from the original
body and were united by Rev. E. J. Cain under the name Church of the Living
God, "The Pillar and Ground of Truth"; and the following year two bodies
joined them, one of them being the General Assembly and the other a group of
churches organized in 1908 in the State of Texas, the Church of the Living God,
these two having previously united at Athens, Tex., in 1924.
ORGANIZATION
The denomination is episcopal in form of government, having at the present
time three bishops, each in charge of a diocese holding annual assemblies. Every
2 years there is a meeting called the general assembly, presided over by the
bishops in order of their age. Bishops are elected at these meetings by a two-
thirds vote of the accredited delegates.
WORK
The church maintains a nome Cor aged Negroes, called the Booker T. Wash-
ington Home, at Oklahoma City, Okla., and a secondary school and orphans'
home, the Edmondson Institute and Orphanage, at Athens, Tex. The official
organ, the Western News Review, is published weekly at Oklahoma City, Okla.,
at which place the headquarters of the denomination are located.
I No revision of the history, doctrine, or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this state-
ment Is the same as that published In Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926.

CHURCHES OF THE NEW JERUSALEM
GENERAL STATEMENT
The Churches of the New Jerusalem, popularly called Swedenborgian, are two
in number. The early history of both of these churches is given in the statement
for the General Convention of the New Jerusalem, the older body, while the move-
ment which resulted in the organization of the second body and the points on
which it differed from the General Convention are set forth in the statement of
the General Church of the New Jerusalem.
These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by
the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to these
churches only.
The principal statistics of the two bodies as reported for 1936, 1926, 1916, and
1906 are given in the following table:

504 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIEIS, 19 3 6
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Church of the New Jerusalem, known also as the "New Church," was
first organized in London in 1787. It was based upon the writings of Emanuel
Swedenborg, who was born in Sweden in 1688, studied at Uppsala, traveled exten-
sively in Europe, and was prominent in national affairs in his own country, where
he was appointed to the Bureau of Mines in 1716 by Charles XII, and served on
it with distinction for 30 years. His favorite subject at first was mathematics,
but cosmology, physics, human anatomy, and physiology all interested hiim,
especially in their relation to spiritual matters. As he said, "I have gone through
anatomy with the single object of investigating the soul." In 1747 he resigned
his assessorship on a pension and thenceforth devoted his life to the revelations
which he claims were given him. His first theological publication w11s the Arcana
Coelestia, an exposition of Genesis and Exodus, considered in their symbolical
sense, the first part appearing in 1749 and the final part in 1756. Later years saw
the publication of a number of works along the same line, including the Apoc-
alypse Revealed and the True Christian Religion. Swedenborg's death occurred
in London in 1772.
In common with the general scientific literature of the day, the writings of
Swedenborg were originally in Latin. His earlier theological works were published
anonymously. In 1750 and succeeding years some were translated into English,
but they did not attract much attention until, in 1783, Robert Hindmarsh, a
printer in London, became interested in them, and gathered together a few men
of like mind to consider them. Four years later the first orgsnization, consisting
of 16 persons, was effected. The following year public services were held, and in
1789 a general conference met. In 1821 there was incorporated the "General
Conference of the Ministers and other Members of the New Church signified by
the New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse or Revelation of John." In 1936 it con-
sisted of 69 societies with an aggregate membership of 6,573, besides two so-
cieties and a number of individuals not members of the General Conference,
so that the total number of members of the church in Great Britain in that year
was probably about 7,000. The first New Church society in America was founded
at Baltimore in 1792, and in 1817 the General Convention of the New Jerusalem
in the United States of America was organized. In 1890 a considerable number
withdrew and later organized the General Church of the New Jerusalem.
Swedenborg is regarded, on every hand, by members of this church as a "di-
vinely illuminated seer and revelator" and as having been given the key to Bible
interpretation-the science of correspondences-in order that he might thereby
open the internal sense of the Word, and announce the Lord Jesus Christ in His
second coming, which is "His coming as the Word newly revealed." He was
thus "divinely chosen to live consciously in the natural and in the spiritual world
at the same time. so that he might describe to men those things which he saw,
especially those things relating to the Holy City, the divine system of doctrine
revealed out of the internal sense of the Word for the establishment of a New
Church." It is the revelation of this interior truth of the Word, and not a personal
appearing, that, in their view, constitutes the Lord's second coming, the "clouds''
in which He comes being the literal sense, the "power and great glory" the spiritual
sense.
DOCTRINE
The general doctrines of the New Church teach that there is one God, even
the Lord God, the Savior, Jesus Christ; that there is in Him a Trinity, not of
persons, but of essence, called in the Word, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; that
the Father is the inmost Divine Essence, or Love, from which all things are;
that the Son is the Divine Wisdom and Word, by which the Divine Love is mani-
fested and acts; and the Holy Spirit is the Divine Proceeding and Operation;
and that these three are related to each other in God as are soul, body, and
operation in man. Thus they teach that the Lord Jesus Christ, as the one
Divine Person in whom is the Father, and from whom is the Holy Spirit, is, in
His glorified humanity, the one God of heaven and of earth, and the supreme
and sole object of worship for angels and men.
• This statement IS substantially the same as that published In vol. II or the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926. That statement had the approval or Rev. William L. Worcester, the president or the Oeo·
eral Convention or the New Jerusalem at that time. It has been revised by Rev. B. A. Whittemore, record-
Ing secretary, General Convention, and approved by him in its present form.
DigitiZed by GoogIe
GENERAL CONVENTION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM 505
With regard to revelation, they teach that the Word of God contained in the
Bible was not written like any other book, and cannot be subjected to the same
methods of criticism; that it was plenarily dictated by the Lord Himself, and
inspired as to every word and letter, and, like Nature itself, is a divine symbol;
that besides the literal sense adapted to men, it contains a spiritual sense adapted
to angels; that these senses are connected with each other by the great law of
correspondence, in accordance with which the universe itself was created in the
beginning; and that h1 letter and spirit it contains the rule of life for angels and
men.
With regard to redemption, they teach that the one God, Jehovah, the Creator
of the universe, came down upon earth in the assumption, by birth from a virgin,
of a human nature in order that He might live a human life, and, by purging it,
redeem it; that in doing so He met and overcame in His temptations all the
enemies of the human race and reduced them to eternal subjection; and that He
continues to hold them in subjection in the mind and heart of every man who
will cooperate with Him by faith and obedience; and that the application of this
redeeming work in those who believe in Him and keep His commandments is
salvation.
With regard to death and the spiritual world, they teach that when a man
dies he is raised up in his spiritual body in the spiritual world, and there lives
forever, either in heaven or in hell, his state being determined by the spiritual
character that he has acquired by his life in this world; the judgment begins imme-
diately after death, in the world of spirits, which is intermediate between heaven
and hell, and it consists in a man's coming to know himself in the light of the
eternal realities of the Word of God.
Besides these cardinal points the doctrines of the New Church have much to
say about the laws of divine order and of divine providence; about faith and
charity; about free will and imputation, repentance, and regeneration; about
marriage; about mental development in childhood and age; about the successive
churches or divine dispensations that have existed on this earth, and the judg-
ments terminating each; all of which teachings, based on the Word of the Lord,
the believers hold to be in complete harmony with each other, and with the
deductions of sound reason and the analogies of nature.
Baptism is administered in the scriptural formula, "in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit," to children as well as to adults who
come on confession of their faith. lnfant baptism is followed by the act of con-
firmation or ratification in maturer years, which is usually identified with the
first communion, and this profession of faith in the essential doctrines of the
church is regarded as the appropriate gate of admission to the sacrament of the
Lord's Table.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the church is a modified episcopacy, but the societies and asso-
ciated bodies are left the utmost freedom in the administration of their local
affairs. Each local society of the New Church elects its pastor and other officers,
including usually a president, treasurer, secretary, and church committee. In
some cases certain privileges are allowed to parishioners or pew holders who are
not communicant members. The different societies of a section are ~athered
into an association at the meetings of which they are represented by the1r minis-
ters and by lay members elected by the societies as delegates.
The General Convention is held annually, and every church member has a
right to be present take part in the deliberations, be ap{lointed on committees,
and be elected to office, but the right to vote is limited to delegates of associations
and to ministers whose official acts are reported to the convention. Women
frequently serve as delegates and as members of committees.
The convention is an ecclesiastical, a legislative, and a judicial body-eccle-
siastical, in maintaining the orders of the ministry and of worship and in pro-
viding for missions and for the education of ministers; legislative, in maintaining
its own organization and enacting measures for the carrying on of its various
activities; and judicial, in admitting ministers to its roll or dismissing them there-
from and in promoting pastors to the general pastorate. The various boards
of the church are elected by the General Convention and are absolutely respon-
sible to it.
A council of ministers, which consists of all the ministers belonging to the con-
vention, has charge of matters pertaining to the ministry. For the superin-
tendence of the business of the convention and the exercise of its powers m the
interval between meetings, there is a general council, consistinp: of the president,
DigitiZed by GoogIe
506 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIIES, 1936
vice president, and treasurer of the convention, together with four ministers and
eight laymen, chosen by ballot by the convention.
The ministry includes ministers, pastors, and general pastors. Ministers are
those who are ordained to the ministry without identification with any particular
pastorate, having the power to teach, preach, and baptize, and officiate at mar-
riages and the Holy Supper. Pastors are those ministers who are called to the
pastorate of societies and installed over them, generally to serve without fixed
term of office. When the candidate is called by a society at the time of his
ordination,,the ordination and installation offices are often combined. A general
pastor is one who, after a suitable term in the pastoral office, is, by request of an
association and with the sanction of the General Convention, invested with power
to authorize candidates, ordain ministers, preside over a general body of the
.church, and aetas presiding minister of an association or of the General Conven-
tion. An association may, with the sanction of the General Convention, tem-
porarily invest the powers of general pastor in its presiding minister or superin-
tendent during his continuance in office.
The worship of the church is generally liturgical, chants being extensively
used, but great latitude is observed in different societies and localities. A very
complete Book of Worship was adopted by the General Convention in 1912 and
is extensively used by the societies of the New Church.
WORK
The missionary enterprises of the New Church are conducted by the General
Convention through its board of home and foreign missions, supplemented by
an augmentation fund committee and by local boards of the various constituent
bodies. In 1936 this board and some of the State associations employed 19 mis-
sionaries among the adherents in 17 States and aided 23 churches in connection
with their running expenses, etc. The work has extended into Austria, China,
Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, France Germany, Italy, Latvia, Sweden, Switzer-
land, British and Dutch Guiana, Burma, Japan, and the Philippine Islands.
Expenditures for the work amounted in 1936 to $12,500 for the home work and
$10,500 for the foreign work. The propert.y belonging to the denomination in the
foreign field is valued at about $75,000.
The educational preparation for the ministry of the church is carried on prin-
cipally at the New Church Theological School in Cambridge, Mass., which has
property valued at $450,000 and during 1936 had 7 instructors and 4 students.
Two other institutions, in Massachusetts and Ohio, under New Church manage-
ment and partly supported by the church, reported 26 teachers and 101 students,
and property valued at $750,000. The total value of property devoted to educa-
tional purposes was given as $1,200,000.
The New Church has a pension fund for needy ministers and an orphan fund.
It has also a league of 37 young people's societies, with 504 members.
The Swedenborg Foundation, Inc., of New York, together with the Amer-
ican New Church Tract and Publication Society, and the Jungerich Trustees, of
Philadelphia, have made free distribution to theological students and clergymen
of over 173,500 copies of Swedenborg's writings, including the True Christian
Religion, Apocalypse Revealed, Heaven and Hell, and Divine Love and Wisdom,
and also The Life of Swedenborg. There are a number of other boards which
make the press an important factor in the missionary work of the church. The
church has two weeklies, a young people's monthly, and a quarterly. It is esti-
mated that $750,000 is invested in publication enterprises.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL lnSTORY
The General Church of the New Jerusalem traces its origin as an independent
ecclesiastical body to the development, at the very beginning of the New Church
in England and America, of a movement "toward a strict adh«.>rence to the
doctrines and principles revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg,
and toward distinctiveness of teaching, worship, and life, in the Church of the
New Jerusalem." Under the influence of two prominent theologians, Rev.
Richard de Charms and Rev. W. H. Benade, both of Philadelphia, this
movement gradually assumed more definite form, and in 1876 the institution
known as "The Academy of the New Church" was founded as the organic
exponent of its principles, which were subsequently adopted by the Pennsylvania
Association, connected with the General Convention of the New Jerusalem.
That association in 1883 adopted an episcopal form of government, elected
Rev. W. H. Benade bishop, and changed its name to "The General Church of
Pennsylvania." In 1890 it severed its connection with the General Convention,
and in 1892 adopted as its name "The General Church of the Advent of the
Lord." In 1897 a complete reorganization was effected, under Rt. Rev. William
F. Pendleton, and the name "The General Church of the New Jerusalem"
was adopted.
DOCTRINE
The General Church of the New Jerusalem accepts the theological writings
of Emanuel Swedenborg as doctrine inspired and revealed by the Lord Jesus
Christ in His second advent, and acknowledges that from this doctrine, which is
the essential Word and as one with the spiritual sense of the Old and New Testa-
ments, the Lord speaks authoritatively to the church.
ORGANIZATION
The General Church of the New Jerusalem has no fixed constitution. 1st
polity is based upon the principle of "practical unanimity," to be secured through
deliberation and free cooperation in "council and assembly." The spiritual
affairs of the church are under the care of the priesthood, within which three
distinct degrees are recognized-namely, ministers, pastors, and bishops.
Ordination into any of these priestly degrees can be performed only by a bishop.
Pastors may solemnize marriages, administer the Holy Supper, and preside over
local societies. At present only one of the bishops holds an executive position.
In the office of this presiding bishop, the administrative functions of church
government are vested. He is chosen by a general assembly of the church. He is
assisted by the counsels of a priestly consistory selected by himself, and by the
cooperation of an executive committee consisting of representative laymen
elected by the church members through their legal corporation which is entrusted
with the fiscal affairs of the church.
Baptism into the New Church is administered in infancy, or if not, in later life.
But membership in the General Church of the New Jerusalem is confined to adults
and is obtained only by direct application to the presiding bh1hop.
WORK
Under the head of general uses, the General Church includes all the activities
supported by the general fund, namely: The support of the bishop's office and of
the visiting pastor; the pension fund; the extension fund; special funds; the
publication of the New Church Life, its monthly organ; and of New Church
Sermons, a pamphlet issued monthly from October to June. In 1936 expendi-
tures from contributions and endowments were as follows: From the general
fund, $9,603; from the extension fund, $11,599; and from the pension fund,
$4,656.
An orphanage fund reporting, in 1936, an income of $2,468 and expenditures of
$1,670, exists primarily to assist orphaned children of the church.
• This statement, which is in part the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. Hugo LJ. Odhner, si!CfetBry of the Gen~ral Churchof the New Jeru.
salem, and approved by him in its present form.

GENERAL CHURCH OF THE NEW JERUSALEM 511
Membership in the General Church is direct and individual, and in the United
States there is a total of 1,308 individual members, all adults, only a portion of
whom are members of the local churches herein reported.
The General Church has a world-wide membership of 2,271, with 4 bishops and
38 pastors. There are 29 organized churches ministered to by local or visiting
pastors, and maintaining regular public worship. Of these churches, 16 are in
the United States and 13 in foreign countries-namely, Canada, Brazil, England,
France, Holland, Sweden, South Africa, and Australia. Seven of the societies
carry out educational work, in 7 day schools, with a total of 372 pupils. These
parochial schools are open to those who have been baptized into the New Church
and are under the direct supervision of the pastors of the local churches. The
energies of the General Church have been concentrated largely upon the religious,
moral, and social development of the children, and on the cooperation of church,
school, and home, to thiS end. In the United States there are 3 of these schools,
with 281 pupils.
The higher education of the church is entrusted to the Academy of the New
Church, which conducts a theological school, a college for young men and women,
an academy for boys, and a seminary for girls. The Academy of the New Church
was incorporated in Philadelphia, but the schools were removed to Bryn Athyn,
Pa., in 1896. In 1899 a sustentation fund of $400,000 was received. In 1936
the endowment stood at $2,052,819 and the property was valued at $446,146,
while 116 pupils attended the schools.
The headquarters of the General Church are located at Bryn Athyn, Pa., where
the presiding bishop resides and a cathedral church has been erected.
The General Church maintains a mission in South Africa, with headquarters at
Alpha, Orange Free State. It reported, in 1936, 17 ministers and authorized
leaders, and a membership of 1,005 baptized adult natives.

CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Congregational and Christian Churches for tbe
year 1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures
between urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules
sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and
the data relate to these churches only.
This body represents the mer~~:ing of two separate bodies, namely, the Con-
~~:regational Churches and the Christian Church (General Convention of the
Christian Church). Each retains full self-government but are united to further
a common Christian work.
The membership of the Congregational Churches comprises those persons who
have been received into the local churches by vote of the members, while that of
the Christian Church (General Convention) consists of those persons who have
been received into fellowship in the local churches upon their voluntary pled~~:e to
live a Christian life.
As these two denominations were reported separately prior to 1936, no compara·
tive data are available.
The data given for 1936 are exclusive of 298 federated churches, each con-
sisting of a Congregational and Christian unit combined more or less closely
with a unit of some other denomination. These federated churches reported a
total membership of 54,666, of whom 17,008 belonged to the Congregational and
Christian denomination.

CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRisrriAN CHURCHES 519
CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRISTIAN
CHURCHEs·
In 1931 the National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United
States and the General Convention of the Christian Church (headquarters, Dayton,
Ohio) united to form the General Council of the Congregational and Christian
Churches. This national merger was followed by combinations in States and
districts and as occasion called for it and congregations desired it local churches
united to form "Congregational Christian" churches.
Both bodies having been wholly democratic it was not difficult to come together
on that basis. Each church is free in its own life. It is a part of a group of
churches which is also free in its sphere. These groups, or the churches in them,
unite in State or district organizations which again are self-determining. Finally
these groups join together to form the democratically constituted national body
which exercises no authority but furnishes mutual counsel, inspiration, and
instrumentalities for common Christian work.
A church may continue to be known as a "Christian" church or a "Congrega-
tional" church. A local group may continue as a "Congregational" association
or a "Christian" conference, and in either case be part and parcel of the fellowship
bodies of the "Congregational and Christian Churches."
Something of the history and doctrine of the separate bodies is given, followed
by a statement of the or~anization and work of the united body. In the latter it
will be seen that the national missionary work has been completely combined.
HISTORY AND DOCTRINE OF THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Reformation in England developed along three lines: Anglicanism, Ptlri-
tanism, and Separatism. The Anglicans held to the old English Church, minus
the papacy and the distinctively papal features. The Puritans, including the
Presbyterians and some Anglicans, held to a National Church but called for a
thoroughgoing reformation which would provide an educated, spiritually minded
ministry and would recognize the right of the members to a voice in the selection
of their ministers, the management of the local church, and the adoption of its
creed or confession. They believed, however, that they should remain within
the church and thus secure its reformation. The Separatists held that the whole
system of the establishment was an anti-Christian imitation of the true church
and could not be reformed, and that the only proper thing for a Christian to do
was to withdraw himself from it.
Such sentiments could scarcely be tolerated in that age, especially after the
Act of Uniformity, passed in 1559, the year after the accession of Queen Elizabeth
to the throne, and church after church which professed them was broken up.
One pastor, Robert Browne, with his congregation, emigrated to Holland in 1581,
whence he issued pamphlets so bitter in their attack upon the ecclesiastical gov-
ernment of the realm, that two men charged with distributing them were hanged,
and the books were burned. In 1593 three others, Barrowe, Greenwood, and
Penry, paid for their treasonable sentiments with their lives.
The movement, however, could not be suppressed, and in 1604 (the first year
in the reign of James I) the man to whose influence is chiefly due the development
of Separatism into Congregationalism came to a little congregation already or-
ganized at Scrooby. John Robinson was ordained in the Church of England, but
he became acquainted with Browne's writings and accepted their principles
without their virulence. For him, too, exile became inevitable, and, together
with a number of friends and followers, he went first to Amsterdam and then to
Leyden. Here they met with a friendly reception, but, after a few years, decided
to remove to America, where they could practice their religion unmolested and
at the same time Jive and rear their children as Englishmen. After many delays
and discouragements, the first band of Pilgrim Separatists, 102 persons, under
the leadership of Brewster, Bradford, and Winslow, landed at Plymouth, Mass.,
in 1620, and founded the.
re the first Congregational Church upon American soil,
Robinson remaining in Leyden. They were followed after a few years by the

Puritans of Massachusetts Bay. So long as they were in England the differences
between the two bodies were accentuated, but after their arrival in America
the many points on which they agreed became more apparent, and the essential
elements of both Separatism and Puritanism were combined in Congregational-
ism. This, indeed, was not accomplished at once. The modern conception of
religious liberty was not yet realized. Certain members of the Salem Church,
who preferred to use the prayer book and withdrew from the Puritan service for
that purpose, were promptly sent to England as nonconformists, and an extreme
Separatist, Ralph Smith, was dismissed to find a welcome farther south. Little
by little, however, the two united, and it is significant that the strongest influence
for such union appears to have been that of two laymen, Governor Endicott, of
Salem, and Dr. Fuller, of Plymouth.
During the decade from 1630 to 1640, the Puritan immigration increased
rapidly, and with each accession new churches were formed, as the companies not
infrequently brought their own pastors with them, and in two cases a full church
organization. By 1640 there were 33 churches in New England, all but 2 being
of pronounced Congregational type. These two at first preferred the Presbyterian
system, but did not retain it long. A notable result was that Congregationalism
soon became practically a State religion, and church influence was everywhere
supreme,although it did not find expression inecclesiasticalcourts. In two colonies,
Massachusetts Bay and New Haven, the franchise was limited, until 1664 and
1665, to church members, and throughout the older Congregational colonies of
New England, sooner or later, the salaries of pastors were secured by public tax,
until into the nineteenth century. Any action affecting the general religious as
well as the social or civil life of the community was taken by the civil legislature,
such as the calling of the Cambridge Synod, in 1646, to draw up a plan of ecclesi-
astical polity, and the expulsion of the Salem "nonconformists" and of Roger
Williams; Williams was expelled not so much for his religious opinions, however,
as for his attacks on the government.
The withdrawal of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 replaced Congregation-
alism by Episcopacy, but a new charter in 1691 restored the former conditions
to a considerable degree. The old ecclesiastical tests once abolished, however,
were not renewed, and, while Congregationalism was still dominant, it was not
supreme.
With the beginning of the eighteenth century other forms of church life devel-
oped in New England. Episcopalians, Baptists, and Quakers protested against
being taxed for the support of Congregational churches, and little by little there
ceased to be a state church. Thus the voluntary, democratic system of Separatist
Plymouth overcame the ecclesiasticism of Puritan Massachusetts Bay and Con-
necticut, although this result was not attained until after the Revolutionary War.
In this development of their early history, however, it was manifest that the
churches considered fellowship fully as important as autonomy, and that the
strict separatism, which in England developed into independency, found little
favor. Separatist Plymouth was represented, unofficially indeed, at the formation
of the first Puritan Church at Salem; and, as the different communities grew,
they formed associations or consociations for mutual conference, and in 1648 the
"Cambridge Platform" was drawn up, a general summary of doctrine and of the
relation of the churches, which, while having no absolute authority, was recognized
as substantially expressing the views of the churches.
The Congregationalists took the initiative in the remarkable revival known as
"The Great Awakening," which was started in 1734 by the preaching of Jonathan
Edwards and was developed under the eloquence of Whitefield. They had a
prominent share in the political discussions preceding the Revolution, in its
inception and conduct, and in the subsequent national development, sending such
men as John Hancock and the Adamses to take part in the councils of the new
nation, although they were not considered to represent the Congregational
churches as a religious body.
The history of Congregationalism during the century succeeding the Revo-
lutionary War centers about certain movements: A plan of union with the Pres-
byterians, the rise of missionary enterprise, the Unitarian separation, and what
may be termed the development of denominational consciousness, manifesting
itself in the extension of Congregational churches toward the West, the organiza-
tion of a National Council, and efforts to secure some harmonious, if not uniform,
statement of Congregational belief.
As the Congregationalists of New England gradually extended westward,
they came into intimate relations with the Presbyterians of the Middle States,
DigitiZed by GoogIe
CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRISTIAN CHURCHES 521
and these relations were all the closer because of the doctrinal affinity between
the teaching of the Edwardses, father and son, and the type of theology repre-
sented by Princeton College, of which Jonathan Edwards, Sr., was president.
Furthermore, the Congregational churches in Connecticut were in many respects
in harmony with the Presbyterian idea, with the result that, before the close of
the eighteenth century, delegates were interchanged between the Presbyterian
General Assembly and several Congregational associations. These relations
were still further strengthened by the call of Jonathan Edwards, Jr., to the
presidency of Union College, and his taking a seat in the Presbyterian General
Assembly. It was natural that this intermingling of the two denominations
should result in more or less confusion, and, in some cases, in friction between
churches in the same region, especially in the newer communities where churches
were being formed. In order to avoid this a "Plan of Union" was adopted by the
Presbyterian General Assembly and by the Connecticut Association, in 1801, and
accepted later by other associations, providing that "missionaries should be
directed to 'promote mutual forbearance' between the adherents of the respective
polities where they should labor; that churches of Congregational or Presbyterian
preferences should continue to conduct their discipline in accordance with their
chosen polity, even where mutual councils were provided for; and in mixed churches
a standing committee might be chosen, one member of which should have the
privilege of sitting in a presbytery, while another should have a vote in a
Congregational association.''
While the plan was, in its inception, eminently fair to both parties, and worked
out advantageously for each along certain lines, one result was the practical
elimination of Presbyterianism from New England, and of Congregationalism
from the new communities to the West, except as various Congregational settle-
ments were established, as in the Western Reserve, in Ohio. On the other hand,
the plan assisted materially in the development of the Congregational missionary
movement. When the division into Old School and New School in the Presbv-
terian Church was accomplished in 1837, the Old School Assembly dropped the
plan, while the New School continued it for 15 years, until the Congregationalists
withdrew.
From the very beginning of the Plymoutl). colony, missionary work for the
Indians was emphasized, and John Eliot, the Mayhews, the younger Edwards,
and David Brainerd accomplished much, although there was no general mis-
sionary movement among the churches. With the increase of westward migra-
tion and the organization, during the first years of the nineteenth century, of
churches in Ohio, especially in the Western Reserve, missionary interest in the
home field developed. The General Association of Connecticut, as early as
1774, voted to send missionaries to the West and North, that is, to New York
and Vermont. The Revolutionary War interrupted, but in 1798 the same associa-
tion organized itself as a missionary society "to Christianize the heathen in
North America and to support and promote Christian knowledge within the new
settlements of the United States." This was followed by similar organizations in
other New England States; by the Vermont Religious Tract Society in 1808; and
by the Connecticut and Massachusetts Bible Societies in 1809.
The missionary movement, however, with which the Congregational churches,
as a whole, were first identified was that which culminated in the organization
of the American Board of Corv.missioners for Foreign Missions in 1810. The
Presbyterians and other religious bodies at first joined the Congregationalists in
this movement, and for many years carried on their entire foreign missionary
work through that board. As denominational consciousness developed, the others
withdrew, one by one, to form their own organizations, leaving the older society
entirely in the hands of the Congregationalists.
The foreign missionary enterprise once thoroughly organized, home missions
again received attention. In 1826 the American Home Missionary Society was
formed, on much the same interdenominational basis as the American Board.
This arrangement continued until 1861, when it became a distinctively Congre-
gational society, and later changed its name to the Congregational Home Mis-
sionary Society. The American Missionary Association was organized in 1846,
and was at first almost as much a foreign as a home society, although more
specifically interested in Negro fugitives and American Indians. In 1853, as it
became apparent that in the outlying sections the newer churches would require
aid, not merely for their services but for their houses of worship, there was formed
the American Congregational Union, subsequently known as the Congregational
Church Building Society. Even earlier than any of these was the American Edu-

522 CENSUS OF REDIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
cation Society, organized in 1815 to assist in the preparation of students for the
ministry, which passed through the same experiences as the Home Missionary
Society.
The influences which resulted in the separation between the Trinitarian and the
Unitarian wings of the CongregationaJI body became manifest early in the eight-
eenth century, with the development of opposition to, or dissatisfaction with,
the sterner tenets of Calvinism. The excesses connected with The Great Awak-
ening, and the rigid theology of the Edwardses, and particularly of their successors,
Hopkins and Emmons, contributed to this divergence. The selection in 1805 of
Henry Ware, a liberal, as professor of divinity in Harvard College, drew the lines
between the two parties more clearly, and the college was now classed as avowedly
Unitarian. Mutual exchange of pulpits still continued to a greater or less extent,
and, while there was much discussion, there was no separate organization.
In 1819 William Ellery Channing, in a famous sermon in Baltimore, set forth
the Unitarian conception so forcibly that separation became inevitable. Then a
difficulty arose, occasioned by the distinction between the church as an ecclesias-
tical body, and the society, in which the ownership of the property was vested.
In some cases the church and the society were in agreement in their theological
views; but in others, the society differed from the church, and, according to the
courts, was entitled to the property. A period of confusion and of legal strife
existed until about 1840, when the line of demarcation became complete. The
section most affected was eastern Massachusetts, all but two of the Boston churches
going over to the Unitarians. Congregational authorities give the total number
of churches lost to them as less than 100, while Unitarians claim an accession of
150. Both are probably correct, as in many cases the churches were split, so
that, while one side gained, the other did not lose. For many years the bitterness
of the conflict continued, but of late years it has been steadily diminishing.
With the increase in the number of Congregational churches and the new con-
ditions in the recently settled sections of the West, it became evident that some
form of mutual fellowship more comprehensive than the local or State associations
was needed. Under the leadership of Leonard Bacon, of New Haven, J. P.
Thompson, of New York, and others, a council or convention met at Albany in
1852, this being the first gathering representative of American Congregationalism
since the Cambridge Synod of 1648. At this council 463 pastors and messengers
from 17 States considered the general situation, and their deliberations resulted
in the abrogation of the "Plan of Union," hearty endorsement of the missionary
work, a call for aid for the churches in the West, and the inauguration of a denomi-
national literature. Under the fostering care of such men as H. M. Dexter and
A. H. Quint, the development of a denominational life went on, and the next
step was the calling of a National Council at Boston in 1865, whose principal
work was the drawing up of a statement as to "the system of truths which is
commonly known among us as Calvinism." So advantageous was this gathering
considered that a sentiment arose in favor of a regular system of councils, and
after conference between the different associations, there was called at Oberlin,
Ohio, in 1871, the first of the National Councils, at first triennial, now biennial,
which have done much to consolidate denominational life.
Of these councils the one held at Kansas City, Mo., in 1913, was particula.rly
important as marking the definite recognition of the Congregational Churches
as an organized religious body with specific purposes and definite methods. The
purposes were set forth in what has been known as a Congregational platform,
including a preamble and statements of faith, polity, and wider fellowship. This
platform did not in any respect modify the essential autonomy of the individual
church in its expression of faith or in its method of action. It did, however,
associate more fully than had been done at any previous time these individual
churches in what may be termed an organic unity based upon a fundamental
union in faith, common purpose in action, and mutual fellowship.
The same spirit has been manifest in various lines of development, especially
those looking toward coordinated action of different religious bodies. Congre-
gationalists have been prominent in the organization and development of the
Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, have cooperated most
cordially and effectively in the preparations for a World Conference on Faith
and Order, and have entered most heartily into the various movements for
interdenominational cooperation.
Through its Commission on Interchurch Relations, the denomination endeavors
to promote the idea of church unity in every feasible way, particularly by cul-
tivating the closest possible relations with other Christian groups with which
Congregationalists have a normal affiliation.

CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRISrriAN CHURCHES 523
During the year 1924 the Evangelical Protestant Church of North America,
a body of independent and congregationally administered churches, voted to
become Congregational, and in 1925 this body was received into the National
Council of Congregational Churches as the Evangelical Protestant Conference
of Congregational Churches.
DOCTRINE
The principle of autonomy in the Congregational Churches involves the right
of each church to frame its own statement of doctrinal belief; the principle of
fellowship of the churches assumes that a general consensus of such beliefs is
both possible and essential to mutual cooperation in such work as may belong
to the churches as a body. As a result, although there is no authoritative Con-
gregational creed, acceptance of which is a condition of ecclesiastical fellowship,
there have been several statements of this consensus, which, while receiving no
formal ecclesiastical endorsement, have been widely accepted as fair presentations
of the doctrinal position of the Congregational Churches. The first of these,
called the "Cambridge Platform," drawn up by a synod summoned by the
Massachusetts Legislature, simply registered general approval of the Westminster
Confession. Certain phraseology in that confeBBion, however, proved unaccept-
able to many churches, and the MaBB&Chusetts revision, in 1680, of the Savoy
ConfeSBion, and the Saybrook Platform of 1708, embodied the most necesSBary
modifications but still approved the general doctrinal features of the Westminster
ConfeBBion. The first National Council in 1865 adopted the "Burial Hill Decla-
ration," but in the changing conditions this was not entirely satisfactory, and in
1880 the National Council appointed a commission to prepare "a formula that
shall not be mainly a reaffirmation of former confessions, but that shall state in
precise terms in our living tongue the doctrines that we hold today."
The commission, composed of 25 representative men, finished its work in 1883.
The statement, or creed, was never formally adopted, but was issued to the
world "to carry such weight of authority as the character of the commission and
the intrinsic merit of its exposition of truth might command"; it has furnished
the doctrinal basis for a great many of the churches, and in the main represented
their general belief.
With the development of denominational life, there came a demand for a some-
what more definite platform, and the platform adopted by the National Council
of 1913 has served this purpose, and has been accepted with practical unanimity
by the denomination. It is as follows:
"Preamble.-The Congregational Churches of the United States, by delegates
in National Council assembled, reserving all the rights and cherished memories
belonging to this organization under its former constitution, and declaring the
steadfast allegiance of the churches composing the council to the faith which our
fathers confessed, which from age to age has found its expression in the historic
creeds of the church universal and of this communion, and affirming our loyalty
to the basic principles of our representative democracy, hereby set forth the
things most surely believed among us concerning faith, polity, and fellowship.
"Faith.-We believe in God the Father, infinite in wisdom, goodness, and love;
and in Jesus Christ, His Son, our Lord and Savior, who for us and our salvation
lived and died and rose again and liveth evermore; and in the Holy Spirit, who
taketh of the things of Christ and revealeth them to us, renewing, comforting, and
inspiring the souls of men. We are united in striving to know the will of God, as
taught in the Holy Scriptures, and in our purpose to walk in the ways of the Lord,
made known or to be made known to us. We hold it to be the mission of the
Church of Christ to proclaim the Gospel to all mankind, exalting the worship of the
true God, and laboring for the progress of knowledge, the promotion of justice, the
reign of peace, and the realization of human brotherhood. Depending, as did our
fathers, upon the continued guidance of the Holy Spirit to lead us into all truth,
we work and pray for the transformation of the world into the kingdom of God;
and we look with faith for the triumph of righteousneBB and the life everlasting.
"Polity.-We believe in the freedom and responsibility of the individual soul
and the right of private judgment. We hold to the autonomy of the local church
and its independence of all ecclesiastical control. We cherish the fellowship of
the churches united in district, State, and national bodies, for counsel and coopera-
tion in matters of common concern.
"The wider fellowsllip.-While affirming the liberty of our churches, and the
validity of our ministry, we hold to the unity and catholicity of the Church of
Christ, and will unite with all its branches in hearty cooperation; and will earnestly
seek, so far as in us lies, that the prayer of our Lord for His disciples may be
answered, that they all may be one."

HISTORY AND DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The period following the War of the Revolution was characterized by a general
spiritual declension. This again was succeeded by a revival period during which,
especially in what were then the western and southern sections, denominational
lines were frequently ignored, and members of different churches united both in
evangelistic and sacramental services. In some cases there were efforts to enforce
ecclesiastical discipline, which resulted in revolt, while in others entirely inde-
pendent movements were started, not so much antagonistic to, as independent of,
ecclesiastical organization.
The pioneer in this movement was Rev. James O'Kelley, a Methodist
minister in Virginia. He opposed very earnestly the development of the super-
intendency into an episcopacy, especially so far as it gave the bishops absolute
power in the matter of appointments to charges. He presented his cause in the
general conference and elsewhere, but failed to bring about tht> change he desired,
and in 1792, with a number of others, withdrew from the Methodist Episcopal
Church. A little later they organized under the name of "Republican Method-
ists," but in 1794 resolved to be known as "Christians" only, taking the Bible as
their guide and discipline, and accepting no test of church fellowship other than
Christian character.
A little later a similar movement arose among the Baptists of New England.
Dr. Abner Jones, of Vermont, became convinced that "sectarian names and
human creeds should be abandoned, and that true piety alone, and not the exter-
nals of it, should be made the test of Christian fellowship and communion."
On this basis he organized a church at Lyndon, Vt., in 1800. He was soon joined
by Elias Smith, a Baptist minister of Portsmouth, N. H., and by many others.
In 1800 the "Great Revival," as it came to be known, was started in the Cum-
berland Valley of Tennessee and Kentucky. It was confined to no denomination
and in the preaching no attention was given to the doctrines which had divided
the churches. In the Presbyterian Church, especially, this seeming neglect of
fundamental doctrines was viewed with concern, and resulted in charges being
preft>rred against two ministers, Richard McNemar and John Thompson, for
preaching doctrines contrary to the confession of faith. As a consequence, these
men, with a number of others, among whom were John Dunlavy, Robert Marshall,
and Barton W. Stone, withdrew from the Synod of Kentucky and, in 1803,
organizt>d the Springfield Presbytery. Shortly afterwards this body was dis-
solved, and its members adopted practically the same position as that held by
James O'Kelley in the South and by Abner Jones in New England.
Gent>ral meetings, the first step toward organization, were held in New England
as early as 1809, but it was not until 1819 that the first general conference met at
Portsmouth, N. H., on the call of Frederick Plummer, of Pennsylvania, and
Edward B. Rollings, of New Hampshire. The conference met again at Windham,
Conn., in 1820, and regularly until 1832, when it was dissolved; but the following
year, by the action of several conferences, a general convention was organized.
In 1834, by direction of thE> convention, the Christian General Book Association
was formed, and thereafter met once in 4 years in connection with the conven-
tion, the same persons being delegates to both bodies. This form of organiza-
tion continued until after 1860, when the two bodies became entirely separated.
In 1886 the general convention, then called the "American Christian Conven-
tion," and the publication board, then called the "Christian Publishing Associa-
tion," were again made identical in membership.
In the year 1829 Alexander Campbell and his followers separated from the
Baptists of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Their teaching spread rapidly to Kentucky,
and in 1832 Barton W. Stone, one of the most prominent of the original leaders
of the Christians in that section, united with them, on the condition that the
Bible alone should be the basis of the union. A large number of the Christians
in Kentucky and Ohio followed Mr. Stone in this action, but even in these States
the greater part remained with the original body, while the eastern and southern
churches were not affected. Out of this movement, however, some confusion of
names has arisen, since many of the churches of the Disciples are still known as
"Christian" churches.
In the report for 1890 the denomination was listed as "Christians (Christian
Connection)," and the same name was used in 1906. This did not prove entirely
satisfactory, and after some conference the name "Christian Church (American
DigitiZed by GoogIe
CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRisrriAN CHURCHES 525
Christian Convention)" the title already officially chosen by the church, was
adopted for the HH6 report, as identifying the denomination with its general busi-
neBB organization. This title was in 1922 changed to "Christian Church (General
Convention of the Christian Church)."
In 1854, on account of the adoption of resolutions condemning slavery, the
southern delegates to the general convention withdrew and formed a separate
organization, which continued until 1890, when the delegates from the South
resumed their seats in the convention.
DOCTRINE
The principles upon which its first churches were organized continue to char-
acterize the denomination. No general organization has ventured to set forth any
"creed" or statement of doctrine other than the Bible itself. Christian char-
acter is the only test of church fellowship, and, while their interpretation of the
teacnings of the Bible is generally in accord with that of most evangelical denom-
inations, they do not bar any follower of Christ from membership because of
difference in theological belief. This same liberty extends to the ordinances of
the church. Baptism is not made a requisite to membership, although it is often
urged upon bt'lievers as a duty. While immersion is generally practiced, no one
mode is insisted upon. The churches practice open communion and labor to
promote the spirit of unity among all Christians.
ORGANIZATION AND WORK OF THE CONGREGATIONAL AND
CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
ORGANIZATION
While the polity of the Congregational and Christian Churches is based upon
certain definite principles, as set forth in its historical development it represents
adaptation to conditions rather than accord to a theory of church government.
The local church is the unit and every church member, irrespective of sex or
position, except as limited by State law, has an equal voice in its conduct and is
equally subject to its control. For orderly worship and effective administration
certain persons are set apart or ordained to particular services, but such ordination
or appointment carries with it no ecclesiastical authority. The church officers
are the pastor, a board of deacons, a clerk, and a treasurer, usually a board of
trustees, and heads of various departments of church work. In most churches
there is a church committee which considers various topics relating to the conduct
of the church, meets persons desiring to unite with it, and presents these matters
in definite form for action by the church as a whole. Eady in Congregational
history there was a distinction between elders and deacons corresponding very
closely to that in the Presbyterian Church. That distinction has disappeared,
and the offices of elders, or spiritual guides, and of deacons. or persons having
charge of the temporalities of the church, have been united in the diaconate.
For fellowship, mutual assistance, and common Christian work, the churches
gather in local associations or conferences, and in State conferences, in which each
church is represented by pastor and lay delegates. Membership in the General
Council includes ministerial and lay delegates elected· by the State conferences.
Membership in an association is regarded as essential to good and regular stand-
ing of churches and ministers in the denomination. No association or conference,
or national council has any ecclesiastical authority beyond that of withdrawing
fellowship. That is vested solely in the council of the vicinage called by the local
church for a specific case, and its existence terminates with the accomplishment of
its immediate purpose. The result is that there is no appeal from one court to
another, although an aggrieved party may call a new council, which, however,
has no more authority than its predecessor.
Ordination to the ministry is generally by a council of churches called by the
church of which the candidate is a member, or over which he is to be installed
as a pastor. More and more, in practice, such councils are made up of the
members of the district sssociation of which the church is a constituent part.
Doctrinal tests are less rigidly applied than in the past, practical Christian fellow-
ship being emphasized rather than creed subscription. In the early history of
the churches the minister was a member of the church, selected by the church, and
ordained to the service by a council of associate churches, while his ministerial
DigitiZed by GoogIe
526 CENSUS OF REI.JIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
standing ceased with the end of his pastorate. Gradually, however, this stand-
ing became recognized as having a permanent character, although the minister,
whether pastor or not, still remained a member of his church, and subject to its
order. For purposes of fellowship, ministerial associations have been formed,
and these have furnished the basis of ministerial standing; but of late there has
been a tendency, all but universal, to vest such standing in a church association,
conference, or convention.
Admission to church membership is usually conditioned on the declared and
evident purpose to lead the Christian life, rather than on the acceptance of par-
ticular doctrine, and participation in the Lord's Supper is free to all followers
of Christ. Infant baptism is customary, and the form of all baptism is optional,
although sprinkling is the form most commonly used.
WORK
The missionary and general educational activities of the Congregational and
Christian Churches are conducted through two national organizetions, each of
which is recognized as an agency of the General Council of the churches, whose
members are voting members of each of the missionary organizations. Pro-
vision for securing the participation of those especially interested in either cause
is secured through permitting each organization to elect a limited number of dele-
gates at large, in addition to the council membership. Unity of control and
administration is thus secured.
As a result of this arrangement, there are two organizations serving the denomi-
nation. The first has the total foreign missionary field in its care; the second, the
entire home field, including Sunday school planting and church building, the task
of conducting schools and colleges among backward or exceptional populations,
the function of religious education and publication, including in its scope the
whole life of the church, and the provision of ministerial pensions and relief. The
promotion of income for all departments of missionary work is assigned to a com-
mon agency called the Missions Council, appointed by the boards themselves.
The foreign missionary work of the Congregational and Christian Churches is
carried on through the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.
Until1926therewerethree auxiliary women's boards, representing different sections
of the country; the oldest, the Woman's Board of Missions, being the pioneer of
similar societies in other denominations, and in the Christian Churches, the Foreign
Department of the Board of Missions with its related women's organization.
These have now merged with the American board. In 1936 the American board
carried on missions in East, South, and West Central Africa, in Turkey, Syria,
India, Ceylon, China, Japan, the Philippines, the Pacific islands, Mexico, and
Bulgaria. The report of the year shows 3,002 places of service, occupied by 481
American missionaries and 6,465 native workers. There were 804 churches
reported, with 107,629 members; 23 theological and training schools, 9 colleges,
48 secondary schools, and 1,033 other schools, with a total of 84,537 students;
26 hospitals and 44 dispensaries, which gave a total of 654,291 treatments. The
amount contributed during 1936 for the foreign work, including legacies, was
$802,661, and the income from various funds, $290,522, making a total of $1,093,-
183. In addition to this, $181,184 was contributed for the work by the native
churches. In regard to the total value of property belonging to the Congrega-
tional denomination in foreign countries, or the total amount of endowment for
all its institutions, there are at present no figures available. The value of the
property is estimated at about $7,500,000.
In 1936 several societies working in the United States combined their work
under the Board of Home Missions with five divisions as follows:
The church extension division is charged with the missionary work among the
white races of continental United States, whether of native or foreign extraction,
and carries on its work in close coordination with a number of State conferences,
each of which is represented on the board of the general society. The report for
the year 1936 shows a total of some 1,400 missionaries employed by the general
society and the constituent State societies, while the number of churches and
preaching stations cared for was about 1,600. Of these churches and missions,
many held services in forelgn tongues: German, Swedish, Dano-Norwegian,
Armenian, Assyrian, Cuban, Hawaiian, Italian, French, Filipino, Spanish, Welsh,
Finnish, Slovak, Portuguese, Indian, Mexican, Bohemian, Chinese, and Japanese.
The largest mission work for those of foreign extraction was carried on among the
German, Swedish, Finnish, and Welsh people. Total receipts for the yeBr were
DigitiZed by GoogIe
CONGREGATIONAL AND CHRIS'riAN CHURCHES 527
as follows: National society, $277,709; constituent State societies, $684,568;
making a total of $962,277.
The American Missionary Association division carries on work among the
Negroes, Indians, Chinese, Japanese, and the various races in Puerto Rico. It
established at Hampton, Va., during the Civil War, the first day school among the
freedmen, and after the close of the war extended its work rapidly. Such out-
standing institutions as Atlanta University and Fisk University were founded by
the association. Dillard University, Talladega, Tougaloo, Tillotson, and Le-
Moyne Colleges are still directly under its auspices. The Congregational churches
among Negroes in the South have been fostered by the association. It also sup-
ports and supervises Congregational church and educational work among the
Sioux, Mandan, Rhee, and Gros Ventres Indians of North Dakota and South
Dakota. On the accession of Puerto Rico, the association took up work in that
island. The report for 1936 shows 428 missionaries and teachers, 110 churches
aided, and 18 colleges and schools, of which 14 are for Negroes, with a total enroll-
ment of 4,384 students. The total income of the association for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 1936, was $687,675. The churches contributed $84,406 of
thisi the remainder came from legacies, individuals, and income from invested
funas.
The church building division assists congregations in the erection of church build-
ings and parsonages. In 83 years this society has helped to complete 6,701 churches
and 1,816 parsonages. Its receipts during that time have amounted to $13,-
980,464, and it has helped to secure church property worth over $40,000,000.
During 1936 the number of churches aided was 54, and the amount contributed
for this work was $54,783. Other miscellaneous receipts amounted to $249,643,
making a total of $304,326.
The Christian education division, formerly the Congregational Education So-
ciety, the successor of the American Education Society, with which two kindred
societies, organized for the establishment of Christian schools in Utah and New
Mexico, were afterwards incorporated, includes in its present work leadership in
the denominational program of Christian training in home, church, and school,
including missionary education and world fellowship, student and young people's
work, adult education, leadership training and recruiting for Christian leadership,
student work under university pastors; summer conferences, vacation and week-
day schools; aids ministerial students; and seeks to make available to schools and
colleges the resources of the denomination through administrative counsel and
advice and, when possible, through financial support. The contributions for this
·work in 1936 were $62,891, which, supplemented from other sources, gave
a total of $100,978. This does not, however, cover the entire amount contributed
by the Congree;ationalists toward educational work, there being no separate
record of contnbutions for the erection of new schools and the providing of
endowments.
Ministerial relief division.-The Board of Ministerial Relief was organized in
1887 and later developed as the Congregational Board of Ministerial Relief, "to
secure, hold, manage, and distribute funds for the relief of needy Congregational
ministers and the needy families of deceased Congregational ministers." The
receipts of this division during the year 1936 were $260,691.
The annuity fund for Congregational ministers, which in 1936 completed its
twenty-third year, is organized under the contributory pension system to secure
an annuity at the age of 65 for those ministers who become members. Its total
assets at the close of 1936 were $6,610,274. In addition there is held in trust for
the annuity fund, by the corporation for the General Council, an endowment
fund of $5,506,825. The retirement fund for lay workers makes similar provi-
sion for unordained church workers.
The totals for all the missionary societies for 1936 show contributions to the
amount of $2,001,157, exclusive of income from funds of $1,367,088.
In philanthropy, the Congregational churches have given largely to institutions
under the care of almost every denominational or undenominational enterprise in
the country, but there are very few distinctively Congregational hospitals,
orphanages, asylums, or homes, and of these there is no .available record.
Pilgrim Press division.-Publishing interests are chiefly cared for under this
division which carries on the publication of Sunday school literature and of other
periodicals and books, mainly of a religious nature. It also issues the leading
denominational_ paper, Advance. The missionary societies publish their own
monthly, The Missionary Herald, representing the home and foreign work.
In 1853 the American Congregational Association was organized in Boston for
the purpose of collating such literature as might serve to illustrate Congregational
528 CE~NSUS OF REUIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
history and of promoting the general interests of the Congregational churches.
It owns a building, the Congregational House, in Boston, and has a library of
great value.
The modern movement for the organization of young people for Christian
work was started by a Congregational minister, Rev. Francis E. Clark, who
formed the first Christian Endeavor Society in Portland, Maine, in 1881. Similar
societies were soon established in other churches, and in 1885 a general interde-
nominational organization was effected, under the name United Society of Chris-
tian Endeavor. This has spread not only throughout the United States, but
throughout the world, and has also given the impulse for a number of kindred
denominational societies, such as the Epworth League, the Baptist Young People's
Union, etc. In 1936 there were in the Congregational and Christian Churches
of the United States 3,480 young people's societies, with 178,046 members.
The interest of the Congregational and Christian Churches in educational mat-
ters is shown by the fact that Harvard, founded in 1636, and Yale in 1701, were
established as Congregational colleges, as were also Williams, Dartmouth, Bow-
doin, and Amherst in the East, and Oberlin, Grinnell, Beloit, Carleton, Drury, and
others in the West. At present more than 40 colleges and 18 academies in the
United States owe their origin to Congregationalists. In 1936 these employed
5,608 instructors, had an enrollment of 40,046 students, had 2,500,000 volumes in
their libraries, and held productive funds amounting to $344,294,241. There
were also 8 theological seminaries, Andover, now part of Andover-Newton Semi-
nary, being the oldest, with a total of 94 professors, 56 instructors and lecturers,
and 1,068 students.
The Council for Social Action deals with social questions and the Laymen's
Fellowship interests laymen in all phases of church life. Both are related to
the Board of Home Missions. The women are organized by States for compre-
hensive work.
For the better coordination of the various lines of denominational activity
there have been established a. number of commissions of the General Council
whose duty it is to recommend to the council such action as commends itself to
their judgment. These commissions are four in number, namely: On evangelism,
on interchurch relations, on the ministry, and on stewardship. In addition,
there are the delegates to the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Congregational Holiness Church for the Jear
1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures
between urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules
sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and
the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination consists of persons who profess conscious
regeneration, and who are also in harmony with the articles of faith of the denomi-
nation.

Ecclesiastical divisions.-In 1935 the growth of this denomination was such as
to need division for administrative purposes, so, at the fifteenth annual session of
the Southeastern Association of the Congregational Holiness Church, held in
Griffin, Ga., three divisions of this church were incorporated; namely, the Ala-
bama Division, the Georgia Division, and the Carolina Division, creating the
General Southeastern ABBociation of the Congregational HolineBB Church.
Table 7 presents, for each of the three divisions, the more important statistical

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Congregational Holiness Church was organized January 19, 1921. It
was a separation from the Pentecostal Holiness Church by a number of ministers
and entire congregations who desired to establish a church having a congrega-
tional form of government, but retaining its holiness belief; the new denomina-
tion was accordingly called "The Congregational Holiness Church."
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
This denomination acknowledges belief in the Trinity, the inspiration of the
Scriptures, justification through repentance and faith, sanctification, divine
healing (but does not condemn medical science), the personal second coming of
Christ, eternal punishment or eternal glory, the merits of the atonement, and
the salvation of the entire church. Baptism, foot washing, and the Lord's Supper
are the ordinances of the church, the candidate being allowed liberty of conscience
in the mode of baptism and in the matter of foot washing, while all Christians
are invited to partake of the Lord's Supper. The crowning blessing of religious
experience is believed to be the baptism of the Holy Ghost, manifested by power
to speak in other tongues.
The conditions of membership are as follows : The candidate must know he is
born of God; must be in harmony with the articles of faith of the denomination;
must abstain from the use of tobacco and slang and "other things that are con-
trary to holy living"; and must take the Bible as his rule of conduct. No one
who belongs to oath-bound secret societies will be received as a member.
The form of government is congregational. The highest governing body of
the denomination is the General Association, delegates to which are elected by
the annual associations. Church officers are elected annually. Each church is
authorized to elect 3 trustees of church property, 1 deacon for every 20 members
or fractional part thereof, and a secretary and treasurer. Each church also has
the authority to elect its own pastor by a majority vote of its membership.
Women may be licensed to preach, but are not ordained.
WORK
The church issues a periodical, The Gospel Messenger, and it also issues Sunday
school literature. There are no schools or colleges under the management of the
church at present.
' This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. Il of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. B. !.. Cox, secretary of the General Southeastern Association of the
Conllftlgatlonal HoHness Church and chairman of the Alabama Division, Piedmont, Ala., and approved by
him 1D Its present form.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Disciples of Christ trace their origin to a movement in the early part
of the nineteenth century, when a number of leaders arose who pleaded for the
Bible alone, without human addition in the form of creeds and formulas. At
first they emphasized Christian fellowship and the independence of the local
church, without adherence to any ecclesiastical system. Somewhat later an
element was added which sought to restore the union of the churches through
a "return, in doctrine, ordinance, and life, to the religion definitely outlined"
in the New Testament.
In 1807 Rev. Thomas Campbell, a minister of the Secession branch of the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, came to the United States, was received cor-
dially, and found employment in western Pennsylvania. Finding that, in the
generally destitute condition of that region, a number of families belonging to
other presbyteries had not for a long time enjoyed the communion service, he
invited them to attend his service. For this he was censured by his presbytery,
but upon his appeal to the Associate Synod of North America, on account of
informalities in the proceedings of the presbytery, he was released from censure.
In the presentation of his case, however, he emphasized very strongly the evils
of sectarianism, and as it became increasingly evident that his views differed
from those of the presbytery, he formally withdrew from the synod. In 1809
his son, Alexander Campbell, with the rest of the family, joined him, and an
organization called the Christian Association of Washington, Pa., was formed.
From this association was issued a "declaration and address," which became
historic.
Its main purpose was to set forth the essential unity of the Church of Christ,
which, while necessarily existing in particular and distinct societies, ought to
have "no schisms, or uncharitable divisions among them." To this end, it claimed
that nothing should be inculcated "as articles of faith or terms of communion
but what is expressly taught and enjoined * * * in the Word of God," which
is "the perfect constitution for the worship, discipline, and government of the
New Testament Church," nor has "any human authority power to impose new
commands and ordinances upon the church." While "inferences and deductions
from Scripture promises * * * may be truly called the doctrine of God's
Holy Word, yet they are not formally binding upon the consciences of Christians,"
and while "doctrinal expositions of divine truths are advantageous, yet they
ought not to be made terms of Christian communion," all the "precious saints of
God" being under obligation "to love each other as brethren."
Division among Christians is characterized as "a horrid evil, fraught with
many evils," anti-Christian, anti-Scriptural, antinatural, and "productive of
confusion and every evil work." Membership in the church should be confined
to such as "profess their faith in Christ and obedience to Him in all things
according to the Scriptures," and "continued to manifest the reality of their
profession by their temper and conduct." Ministers are "to inculcate none other
things than those articles of faith and holiness expressly revealed and enjoined
in the Word of God," and in administration are to observe the "example of the
Primitive Church without any additions whatsoever of human opinions or in-
ventions of men." Should there be any "circumstantials indispensably neces-
sary to the observance of divine ordinances not found upon the page of express
revelation," these may be adopted only under the title of "human expedients
without any pretense to a more sacred origin."
The publication of this address did not meet with much response, and the two
Campbells appear to have been somewhat uncertain as to just what to do. The
development of their Christian Association into a distinct denomination was the
very thing they did not wish, and accordingly overtures were made to the
Presbyterian Synod of Pittsburgh. The address, however, stood in the way of
acceptance, and in 1810 they and their associates organized "The First Church
of the Christian Association of Washington, meeting at Cross Roads and Brush
Run, Washington County, Pennsylvania."
' This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Reli~lous
Bodies! 1926, bas been revised by Dr. Stephen J. Corey, president, the United Christian Missionary Society,
Disclp es of Christ, Indianapolis, Ind., and approved by him in its present form.

DISCIPLES OF CHRIST 541
Subsequently, an invitation was given to the members of this association to join
the Redstone Baptist Association, but difficulties arose on both sides. The
Campbells had accepted the general principle of believers' baptism, but some
elements in their position were not pleasing to the Baptists. On the other hand,
the Baptist Association, in accepting the Philadelphia Confession of Faith, had
done the very thing to which the Campbells objected. Still it seemedadvantageous
for them to enter into fellowship with the churches nearest to their own in belief
and practice, and, accordingly, the invitation was accepted. This alliance, however,
did not continue for any length of time, as difference of views became more
evident, and later the Campbell association withdrew and joined the Mahoning
Baptist Association, in which their teachings had gained general acceptance.
In ·1829, however, since a majority of the members believed that there was no
warrant in Scripture for an organization such as theirs, the association was dis-
banded as an ecclesiastical body. Alexander Campbell was opposed to this
action, as he thought that such an organization was needed and that there was no
reason why a specific "Thus saith the Lord" should be required in a case of this
character.
Meanwh~le, Barton W. Stone, another Presbyterian minister, and a number
of his associates had accepted the principle of baptism by immersion, although
comparatively few made it a test of fellowship; and as they came into relations
with Alexander Campbell a partial union was effected in Lexington, Ky., in the
early part of 1832. In this there seems to have been no effort at entire agree-
ment, but only a readiness to cooperate heartily. When the question arose as to
the name to be adopted, Mr. Stone favored "Christians," as the name given in
the beginning by divine authority. Mr. Campbell and his friends preferred the
name "Disciples" as less offensive to good people and quite as scriptural. The
result was that no definite action was taken and both names were used, the
local organization being known..~. generally:bas a "Christian Church," or a "Church
of Christ," and, rarely, as a "\Jhurch of isciples," or a "Disciples' Church."
During the first few years of the movement, Alexander Campbell and other
leaders were often engaged in more or less heated controversies with represent-
atives of other denominations. Gradually, however, these discussions became
less frequent and at the same time more conciliatory in tone.
The growth of the new organization was very rapid, especially in the Middle
West. Throughout Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, and Missouri it gathered
numerous congregations, though there was evident a strong objection to any
such association, even for fellowship, as would appear to involve ecclesiastical
organization. This manifested itself in various ways, especially in opposition to
the use of societies for carrying on missionary work. The use of instrumental
music in the churches also occasioned dissatisfaction.
During the Civil War the movement suffered from the general disorganization
of the sections in which it had gained its strength~and the death of Alexander
Campbell in 1866 was no doubt a severe blow. .nom the effect of these dis-
couragements, however, it soon recovered, and the period since that war has
been one of rapid expansion. With this expansion there developed, out of the
objections referred to above, and especially to any semblance of ecclesiastical
organization and to the use of instrumental music in the churches, two parties,
generally termed "Progressives" and "Conservatives." The former were anxious
to include all under one general head as was done in the census report for 1890,
leaving each church free to conduct its affairs in its own way, but the Conserva-
tives objected, and insisted on separate classification. Accordingly, in the report
for 1906 and in subsequent reports the "Conservative" churches have been listed
as Churches of Christ. The line of demarcation between the two bodies, however,
is by no means clear.
DOCTRINE
The doctrinal position of the Disciples has been summarized as follows: They
accept the divine inspiration of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments; the all-sufficiency of the Bible as a revelation of God's will and a
rule of faith and life; the revelation of God in threefold personality of Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, as set forth by the Apostles; the divine glory of Jesus
Christ as the Son of God, His incarnation, doctrine, miracles, death as a sin
offering, resurrection, ascension, and coronation; the personality of the. Holy
Spirit and His divine mission to convince the world of sin, righteousness, and
judgment to come, and to comfort and sanctify the people of God; the alienation
of man from his Maker, and the necessity of faith, repentance, and obedience in
order to salvation; the obligation of the divine ordinances of baptism and the
DigitiZed by GoogIe
542 CENSUS OF REiliGIOUS BODIES, 19 36
Lord's Supper; the duty of observing the Lord's day in memory of the resurrec-
tion of the Lord Jesus; the necessity of holiness on the part of believers; the divine
appointment of the Church of Christ, composed of all who by faith and obedience
confess His name, with its ministries and services for the edification of the body
of Christ and the conversion of the world; the obligation of all disciples to carry
the gospel into all the world, "teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I commanded you"; the fullness and freeness of the salvation that is in Christ to
all who will accept it on the New Testament conditions; the final judgment, with
the reward of the righteous and punishment of the wicked.
In addition to these beliefs, in which they are in general accord with other
Protestant churches, the Disciples hold certain positions which they regard as
distinctive:
1. Feeling that "to believe and to do none other things than those enjoined
by our Lord and His Apostles must be infallibly safe," they aim "to restore in
faith and spirit and practice the Christianity of Christ and His Apostles as
found on the pages of the New Testament."
2. Affirming that "the sacred Scriptures as given of God answer all purposes
of a rule of faith and practice, and a law for the government of the church,
and that human creeds and confessions of faith spring out of controversy
and, instead of being bonds of union, tend to division and strife," they reject
all such creeds and confessions.
3. They place especial emphasis upon "the Divine Sonship of Jesus, as the
fundamental fact of Holy Scripture, the essential creed of Christianity, and
the one article of faith in order to bap,tism and church membership."
4. Believing that in the Scriptures 'a clear distinction is made between the
law and the gospel," they "do not regard the Old and New Testaments as of
equally binding authority upon Christians," but that "the New Testament
is as perfect a constitution for the worship, government, and discipline of the
New Testament church as the Old was for the Old Testament church."
5. While claiming for themselves the New Testament names of "Chris-
tians," or "Disciples," "they do not deny that others are Christians or that
other churches are Churches of Christ."
6. Accepting the divine personality of the Holy SRirit, through whose
agency regeneration is begun, they hold that men 'must hear, believe,
repent, and obey the gospel to be saved."
7. Repudiating any doctrine of "baptismal regeneration," and insisting
that there is no other prerequisite to regeneration than confession of faith
with the whole heart in the personal living Christ, they regard baptism by
immersion "as one of the items of the original divine system," and as "com-
manded in order to the remission of sins."
8. Followin~ the apostolic model, the Disciples celebrate the Lord's Supper
on each Lords day, "not as a sacrament, but as a memorial feast," from
which no sincere follower of Christ of whatever creed or church connection is
excluded.
9. The Lord's day with the Disciples is not a Sabbath, but a New Testa-
ment institution, commemorating our Lord's resurrection, and consecrated
by apostolic example.
10. The Church of Christ is a divine institution; sects are unscriptural and
unapostolic. The sect name, spirit, and life should give place to the union
and cooperation that distinguished the church of the New Testament.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the Disciples churches are congregational. Each local church elects
its own officers, calls its own ministers, and conducts its own affairs with no
supervision by any outside ecclesiastical authority. Persons are received for
membership in the church on profession of their faith in Christ and baptism, which
follows either at the same or at some subsequent service. The officers of the
church are the elders and deacons, the pastor usually being one of the elders. The
elders have special care of the spiritual interests of the congregation, and the
deacons of its financial affairs and benevolences, although the distinction between
elders and deacons is not always observed. Applicants for the ministry are
ordained by authority of the local church, the ceremony of ordination being
conducted by the pastor and elders of the church, sometimes by a visiting evangel-
ist, or occasionally by an association of neighboring churches. The minister is a
member of the church where he is located, whether as pastor or as evangelist, and
is amenable to its discipline. For conference in regard to ministerial matters, and
DigitiZed by GoogIe
DISCIPLES OF CHRIST 543
a general supervision over ministerial standing, ministerial associations are formed,
but they are simply advisory, the authority resting with the local church of which
the minister is a member.
There is no national ecclesiastical organization of the churches. There is an
International Convention of Disciples of Christ, which is composed of individual
members of the churches. These may or may not be selected by the churches, but
their standing in the convention is personal rather than representative, and the
convention as such has no authority over the acti<>'n of the churches, which are at
liberty to accept or reject its recommendations.
For mutual conference in regard to their Jenera! affairs, the churches unite
in district and State conventions. These cou~entions, however, have no ecclesi-
astical authority, the ultimate responsibility in every case resting in the local
church.
In accordance with the principles that have been emphasized in their history,
the Disciples of Christ, individually, in their local church organization, in their
organized societies, and in their denominational relations, have constantly sougM
to secure the overcoming of denominational distinction and the unity of the
church in its broadest sense. They are thus represented in the various inter-
denominational movements, especially the Federal Council of the Churches of
Christ in America, the International Council of Religious Education, the Advisory
Committee of the World Conference on Faith and Order, the World Alliance for
International Friendship through the churches, the Universal Christian Con-
ference on Life and Work, the Near East Relief, the Boy Scouts of America, the
Y. M. C. A., and similar organizations.
WORK
The general activities of the Disciples of Christ are carried on through several
societies or boards which, in their organization, are independent of any ecclesi-
astical control, although the various individuals are representative of their
membership. A general convention, called The International Convention of
Disciples of Christ, consisting of members of the churches, meets annually.
Its object is to promote unity, economy, and efficiency among the philanthropic
organizations of the churches, promote equitable representation, and secure
closer cooperation. Its powers are advisory.
While the earlier· sentiment was somewhat adverse to the organization of
societies, Alexander Campbell's first association at Washington, Pa., was prac-
tically a miBBionary or church extension society, and the organization with which
Barton W. Stone was identified was distinctly evangelistic in its nature. It was
with Mr. Campbell's full approval that in 1849 the American Christian Mis-
sionary Society was formed at Cincinnati, its object being, as stated in its consti-
tution, "* * * to promote the preaching of the Gospel in this and other lands."
He was the first president and held the office 18 years, until his death in 1866. In
1874 the Christian Woman's Board of Missions was organized. Prior to this
time a large number of State, district, and city societies had been formed. The
next year the Foreign Christian Missionary Society came into being, followed
in 1887 by the National Benevolent Association of the Christian Church, in 1888
by the Board of Church Extension, in 1895 by the Board of Ministerial Relief,
in 1910 by the Association for the Promotion of Christian Unity, in 1914 by the
Board of Education, and later by the Board of Temperance and Social Welfare.
These boards continued to function separately until, at the International
Convention in Kansas City in 1917, the three miBSionary societies appointed a
committee on unification, instructing the committee to seek to bring about the
complete unification of societies so that they should function as one organization,
having one headquarters and one management. It was proposed that whatever
organization should ultimately be brought about, it should have on its board and
its executive committee equal representation of men and women.
The committee on cooperation and unification held a preliminary meeting in
Indianapolis December 11, 1917. The original proposal was to unite the Foreign
Christian Missionary Society, the Christian Woman's Board of Missions, and
the American Christian Missionary Society, the latter involving the Board of
Church Extension, which was a board of the American Society. Later the Board
of Ministerial Relief and the National Benevolent Association sought representa-
tion on the committee and voted to join the above-mentioned boards in forming
the United Christian Missionary Society.
When the committee on cooperation and unification came squarely up to the
legal problems involved in a merger of the several societies, it found that techni-
cally such a merger, involving as it would the immediate surrender and dissolution
DigitiZed by GoogIe
544 CENSUS' OF REIJIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
of the old boards, could not be accomplished, or at least, not for a period of
years. It seemed, however, that the objects sought in the unification could
be accomplished by creating a new society, duly incorporated, to which the
operating functions of the old boards should be committed. The old societies,
however, were to continue their legal existence in the States where they originated,
for the purpose of holding the trusts committed to them and of discharging the
responsibilities required by law.
Appropriate articles of agreement were drawn up and adopted by each of the
boards and societies prior to their coming together in the International Convention
at Cincinnati, in 1919. At this convention, the constitution and bylaws of the
new United Christian Missionary Society were presented and adopted, and the
organization was effected. The executive committee chose St. Louis, Mo., as
the operative headquarters for the United Christian Missionary Society, and it
began its functions there October 1920. In 1928 the Society moved its headquar-
ters to Indianapolis, Ind., where it is located in its own commodious quarters,
called The Missions Building.
In 1928 the Department of Ministerial Relief was set apart to be absorbed in
the Board of the Pension Fund of Disciples of Christ, in 1933 the Church Exten-
sion Board took over church loans, and the National Benevolent Association
assumed control of the benevolent homes of the Disciples of Christ.
In 1935 the Department of Social Education and Social Action and the Depart-
ment of Higher Education were added to the United Christian Missionary
Society.
The foreign missionary work carried on by the Disciples of Christ through the
United Christian Missionary Society in 1938 covered the Belgian Congo, China,
India, Japan, Mexico, Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico, Argentina, and Paraguay.
Work by nationals is also carried on in Jamaica and at Batang on the Tibetan
border.
During 1937 there were 5,628 baptisms in foreign fields. The 499 day schools
on the foreign field had a total enrollment of 17,133. The 10 hospitals and 16
dispensaries treated 466,933 persons. Appropriations for pastoral support were
received by 58 home mission churches during the year through the United Chris-
tian Missionary Society.
Work was conducted among immigrants, and among French groups, High-
landers, Indians, Negroes, Orientals, Spanish-Americans, and Mexicans.
The National Benevolent Association conducted 6 homes for the aged, caring
for a family of 873. The Board of Church Extension in 1937 made 382 loans to
churches and had a loan fund of $2,789,606.
The educational work of the Disciples of Christ is carried on through 27 col-
leges and schools of higher grade, which provide classical, scientific, and profes-
sional training for both sexes and cover every phase of ministerial training.
The Pension Fund of the Disciples of Christ shows, in 1937, assets of $2,206,255
and a total pension family of 1,446.
The purpose of the Association for the Promotion of Christian Unity is to watch
for every indication of Christian unity and to hasten the time by intercessory
prayer, the holding of friendly conferences, and the distribution of Christian
unity literature.
Following are some interesting statistics, taken from the 1937 yearbook of the
Disciples of Christ: Total church membership in 41 countries throughout the
world, 1,761,778; total Bible school enrollment throughout the world, 1,168,488;
number of churches reported throughout the world, 8,957; number of ministers
in the United States and Canada, 7,333.
During 1936 the total contributed in the United States and Canada to the
national boards reporting to the international convention of the Disciples of Christ,
including amounts given to the various State and provincial missionary societies,
was $2,928,476.

lflSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
Divine Science had its beginnings in the year 1885, when Mrs. Malinda E.
Cramer, of San Francisco, Calif., became convinced that she had been healed
from a serious illness of long duration through her realization of God's presence.
She believed that her recovery was due to the working of a scientific principle
through divine power. She confidently believed that this principle was not
limited in its application to herself alone, but was of universal application. After
much study and investigation, she tested her conclusions by practical application
of them to suffering humanity. Her work for others was attended by wonderful
healings. She systematized her teachings and for a number of years gave instruc-
tion in the larger cities of the United States. The Divine Science churches and
theological schools throughout the country are the direct outgrowth of her work
in these early years.
DOCTRINE
The essence of the teaching of Divine Science is the all-inclusiveness of the
God-mind. The essential ideas naturally fall into three divisions-the philosophy,
the psychology, and the religion of Divine Science.
In its philosophy it is monistic; Divine Science is spiritual monism. Through-
out its teaching, the omnipresence of God is the fact stressed. God is portrayed
as the only Creator, the one substance, the one life, and the one intelligence
everywhere preSent. In this teaching, they claim to be in strict accord with the
teachings of natural science, in which matter is considered not as a solid but as a
mode of motion. Every atom, according to accepted theories, is a whirl of
activity with directive intelligence resident within itself. Divine Scientists
interpret this as the substantiation of their belief in the immediacy of God,
recognizing the Divine Mind as the resident, directive intelligence. However,
Divine Science does not deny the existence of visible matter, but interprets both
form and force as manifestations of God. The monistic concep,tion of man's
relationship to God is well set forth in the verse of Scripture~,.., 'One God and
Father of all, who is above all and through all and in you all" (.!!;phesians iv, 6).
In their practical application of this conception, the brotherhood of man and the
fatherhood of God are stressed, as well as integrity in every experience, circum-
stance, and relationship.
1 This statement, which is the same as that published in vol. ll of the Report on Religious Bodies, 1926,
bas been approved in its present form by Nona L. Brooks, president, The Divine Science College, Denver,
Oolo.

548 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
Divine Science teaches healing through thought training, making every thought
true to God-presence. For example: God is love; every thought must be kind,
helpful, and generous. God is the one powe~ every thought must evidence faith
in the God-power; fear must be abolished. J!.Ovil in its various forms of sickness,
death, and sin has come into the world through man's ignorance of the truth, and
these "complexities" will disappear only when man knows God and lives by that
knowledge.
Healing, in Divine Science, therefore, is much more than restoring harmony to
the body; it is cleansing the inner man from all that is unlike God. It is a
mental process, a turning from the misconception of wrong to a realization of
the oneness of God and man. It is the individual's duty to make his unity with
the law by thinking in terms of wholeness instead of thinking in terms of separa-
tion. Wholeness of thinking means seeing God everywhere. This process by
which one comes to know that he is in conscious touch with God is called healing.
The psychology of Divine Science is that one cannot think wrong thoughts
and reap right harvests in experience. Paul's injunction is good: "Be ye trans-
formed by the renewing of your mind." Thinking cannot change truth, but it
does change experience.
They teach love as the keynote of their religion and define love as conscious
unity. They hold that one may know their philosophy, he may exercise himself
in thought training until he achieves much, but if he leaves out that one thing
he has missed the mark of his high calling.
The fundamental concepts of Divine Science, therefore, are: God, the Om-
nipresence, the Universal Presence, Substance, Life, and Intelligence; man, a
child of God, lives in God, is of God, is like God; knowledge of this truth used
in our living frees us from sin, sickness, and death; the practice of right think-
ing, or thought training, results in the elimination of fear, doubt, anxiety, and
other wrong mental habits, and the establishment of love, faith, joy, and power
in the consciousness; evolution is God's method of accomplishing, and love,
conscious unity, is the fulfilling of the law.
ORGANIZATION AND WORK
Recently the Divine Science leaders in the United States formed a federation
for the purpose of strengthening the work of its many branches of church, college,
publication, and field activities.
Divine Science literature, as approved by the respective centers, is clear,
simple, and direct. There are books adapted to the need of the advanced student,
as well as study matter for the beginner. The circulation of Divine Science
publications reaches round the world, going to the rural districts and villages, as
well as to the larger cities.
Divine Science considers war un-Christian and works for its abolishment. It
longs for harmonious relations-for a world federation. Divine Science teaches
integrity in all relationships; it draws its lessons on this subject from the Sermon
on the Mount. Divine Science teaches that righteousness means treating others
as we ourselves would be treated. However, it teaches that the way these things
can be brought about is not by imposing them from above but by building them
from beneath on the foundation of individual development in the divine attributes
of integrity, love, and faith.

EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCHES
GENERAL STATEMENT
History.-The Holy Eastern Orthodox Church, known historically as the
"Eastern Catholic," in modern times as the "Greek Catholic," the "Eastern
Catholic Church," the "Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church," and popu-
larly as the "Greek Church," is the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of the
Byzantine Empire. It has always been known as the Old Church, the church
of the first Christian era, of the time of the Oecumenical Councils, and considers
herself to be the direct heir of the true conserver of this old Holy Church.
In the first period of the development of the Orthodox Church, during the first
five centuries, Orthodox Christianity received its basis and direction. The basic
truths, the basic forms or constitution, and the foundations of the cult of the
Orthodox Church were set forth by the great oecumenical Church Fathers during
this period.
Two important historical events, the rise of papal Rome and the·advance of
Mohammedanism, held the church's chief attention during the second period,
which extended from the fifth to the eleventh century. These two forces
threatened the integrity and the existence of the Eastern Church. The heathen
Slavs, and the iconoclastic controversy caused more unrest during this troubled
period, which finally led to the separation between eastern Christianity and
papal Rome.
During the third period, from the eleventh to the nineteenth century, the
advancing waves of the Mohammedan storm swept over and destroyed the south-
eastern empires of the Byzantines, the Bulgarians, the Serbs, and the Roumanians.
At the same time, the monstrous flow of Tartars swept over Russian orthodox
territory, threatening the existence of eastern civilization and eastern Christianity.
Here the church's iron endurance and its capacity to sacrifice for the faith had a
double result-eastern Christianity maintained its own existence. and also
secured immunity and safety for the Christianity of the west.
During the fourth and last period of development, from the nineteenth century
on, all the orthodox peoples, supported by the inner protective power of their
churches, have been liberated from all foreign subjection and oppression, whether
political or religious. So a new life is seen dawning for Orthodox Christianity.
The Orthodox Church consists of a number of so-called autocephalic or auton-
omic churches, the oldest of which are the four eastern patriarchates of Con-
stantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The World War and the result-
ing national and political changes have left their mark in many alterations in
various churches of orthodoxy, a depressing example of which being that the
external substance of the patriarchate of Constantinople, the Mother Church of
all orthodox churches, is now reduced to a ruin and shadow. As a parallel to the
political changes in the former Russian Empire, the Orthodox Churches in Poland,
Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, separated from the Russian Church
and instituted themselves as free (autonomous) churches. Thus on the one hand
is disintegration and on the other individual unification.
These different organizations, although independent of each other ecclesias-
ticallyt agree in doctrin!lz and essentially, in form of worship, and together consti-
tute wnat is called the Holy Eastern Orthodox Church.
Of the 11 bodies comprising the Eastern Orthodox Churches in the United
States, 8-the Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Roumanian, Russian, Serbian, Syrian,
and Ukrainian-are headed by a bishop or archbishop under the spiritual jurisdic-
tion of the mother church in their ancestral homelands. The remaining three
organizations-the American Holy Orthodox Catholic Eastern Church, the
Apostolic Episcopal Church (The Holy Eastern Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox
Church), and the Holy Orthodox Church in America, whose distinguishing char-
acteristic is that the liturgy is conducted in English-were formed to meet the
needs of American-born descendants of foreign lineage.

550 CENSUS OF RELIG10US BOOIF.S, 1936
Doctrine.-The doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Churches is founded
on the Holy Scriptures, the Holy Traditions, and the dogmatic decisions of the
seven Ecumenical Councils. The Holy Scriptures are interpreted strictly in
accordance with the teachings of the seven Ecumenical Councils and the Holy
Fathers. The Niceo-Constantinopolitan Creed is held only in its original authori-
tative form without the Roman-Latin addition of the "filioque" phrase. Recog-
nizing Christ as the only head of the earthly as well as the heavenly church, they
do not accept the dogma of the Pope as the special representative or Vicar of
Christ on earth, and the infallible head of His earthly church. According to their
teachin~, infallibility belongs to the whole assembly of true believers, to the
"Eccles1a," or church, which is represented by its council legally called together
and whose decisions are confirmed by the consensus of the church.
They believe in the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father alone; honor
Mary as the mother of God, and honor the nine orders of angels and the saints;
do not define as dogma the doctrine of the immaculate conception of the Virgin
Mary, but hold the true Catholic doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ. They
reject the doctrine of the surplus merits of the saints and the doctrine of indul-
gences. They reverence relics of the saints, pictures of holy subjects, and the
cross, but forbid the use of carved images. They accept seven sacraments-bap-
tism, anointing (confirmation or chrismation), communion, penance, holy orders,
marriage, and holy unction. Baptism of either infants or adults by threefold
immersion is recognized as the only proper form, although other forms are accepted
of necessity or in the case of converts who have previously been baptized. The
sacrament of anointing with "chrism," or holy oil, is administered immediately
after that of baptism and the chrismated infant or adult is thereafter a full com-
municant in the Eucharist.
The doctrine of transubstantiation is taught. In the Eucharist, leavened bread
is used, being consecrated and soaked in the consecrated chalice and then received
by all members of the Eastern Orthodox Churches after confession and absolu-
tion. Children under 7 years of age, however, receive the sacrament without
confession. Holy unction is administered to the sick, and not alone to those in
danger of death. The church rejects the doctrine of purgatory, but believes in
the beneficial effect of prayer for the dead by the living and for the living by the
dead. It rejects the doctrine of predestination and considers that for justifica-
tion both faith and works are necessary.
In the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, membership has two distinct but
frequently confused meanings. All persons who have been baptized in the church
and received the sacrament of chrismation (confirmation) which immediately fol-
lows baptism, are communicant members of the church, participating in the sac-
rament of the Eucharist. Parish membership, however, is counted more
frequently by males over 21 than by communicants, because the head of
each family is the voting member of the parish congregation. This fact gives
rise to confusion and uncertainty of statistics of all Eastern Orthodox Churches.
Organization.-There are three orders of the ministry-deacons, priests, and
bishops. The deacons assist in the work of the parish and in the serv-
ice of the sacraments. Priests and deacons are of two orders, secular and mo-
nastic. Marriage is allowed to candidates for the diaconate and the priesthood,
but is forbidden after ordination. The episcopate is, as a rule, confined to mem-
bers of the monastic order. A married priest, should his wife die, may enter a
monastery and take the monastic vows, and is eligible to the episcopate. The
parishes are, as a rule, in the care of the secular priests.
Monks and nuns are gathered in monastic establishments or are scattered out
in missionary work. In some monastic colonies the members live in communi-
ties, while in others they lead a secluded, hermitical life, each in his own cell.
There is but one order, and the vows for all are the same-obedience, chastity,
prayer, fasting, and poverty.
The organization for the general government of the different Eastern Orthodox
Churches varies in different countries. In general, there is a council at the head
of which, as president, is a bishop elected by the ecclesiastical representatives of
the people. Historically, and at present in some cases, this presiding bishop is
called the patriarch, and has special colleagues and officers for the purpose of
governing his flock. The largest or most important of the bishoprics connected
with the patriarchate, or synod, are called "metropolitan sees," though the title
now carries with it no special ecclesiastical authority. In early times, both the
clergy and the laity of the local churches had a voice in the election of bishops,
priests, and deacons, but of late that right has been much restricted, and at pres-
DigitiZed by GoogIe
EASTERN ORTHODOX C'HUIRCHES 551
ent the priests and deacons are usually appointed by the bishops, and the bishops
are elected by the clergy.
The service of the Eastern Orthodox Churches is solemn and elaborate. It is
essentially that of the earlier centuries of Christianity, and is most fully and
completely observed in the monasteries. There are no sculptured images and no
instrumental music, although there are pictorial representations of Christ, the
apostles and saints, and scenes in Bible history. The most important service is
the divine liturgy, the chief part of which is the celebration of the Eucharist.
There are three liturgies, those of St. John Chrysostom, St. Basil the Great, and
St. Gregory, the last called the "Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts," for which
the holy gifts are prepared at a preceding service. There are no so-called "silent
liturgies" or "private masses," and two liturgies are not allowed to be performed
in the same church simultaneously, nor can a liturgy be performed by the same
p,riest, or on the same altar, twice a day. A "corporal," otherwise known as an
'antimins," a cloth with a particle of the holy remains of some saint sewed into it,
and especially blessed by a bishop for every church, is necessary to the performance
of the liturgy. Moreover, a priest may perform it only when he is fasting. Be-
sides the liturgy, the church has vespers, vigils, matins, hours, and special prayers
for various occasions and needs. The several services named consist of readings
from the Old and New Testaments, supplicatory prayers, thanksgiving, glorifying
hymns, etc.
Statistics.-The churches grouped under Eastern Orthodox Churches in 1936,
1926, 1916, and 1906, are listed in the following table, with the principal statistics as
reported for the four census periods. It will be noted that four churches presented
in 1936--American Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern, Apostoli\} Episco-
pal (The Holy Eastern Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox), Holy Orthodox Church
in America, and Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America-were not reported in
earlier census years.
Certain small groups or movements which have sprung from the Old Catholics
in America must not be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Some
of these Old Catholics use the word "Orthodox" in their names (f". g., African
Orthodox Church), but none of them has any relation with Eastern Orthodox
Catholic Churches either in orders or sacraments.

The churches of this communion represent in America what is held to be the
oldest existing race in Europe, the descendants of the Macedonians, lllyrians,
and Epirotes, who were the offspring of the Pelasgians.
The various invasions by Romans, Goths, Huns, Serbians, Bulgars, Normans,
and Turks have made little change in social customs, language, or traditions, and
the present-day Albanians represent their early ancestors more exactly, probably,
than does any other nation in Europe. They are noted for their independence,
persistence, strong sense of honor, caution, hospitality, respect for womanhood,
bravery, loyalty, and keen appreciation of poetry; and they have produced some
of the most noted leaders of history: Alexander the Great, Pyrrhus, Scander-
beg, Ali Pasha of Janina, Mehmet Ali Pasha of Egypt, the Italian statesman,
Krispi, and others.
The Albanian language, belonging to the Indo-European group, is older than
the classical Greek, has many literary qualities, and is of great interest to scholars.
It is taught today at Columbia University.
The early religion of the Albanians had many features older even than the earli-
est traces of the Greeks and Romans. Christianity reached them in the first cen-
tury, but made little progress until the fourth. The church authorities, in the
Patriarchate of Constantinople, refused the use of the Albanian vernacular in
the services, with the result that the church had little hold on the people; and
when the Turks came, their conception of power and their military character
appealed to the mountaineers, and the great majori~y became Moslem. In the
north and south, along the Adriatic, portions became Christian, those in the north,
termed Gheg, being connected with the Roman Catholic Church, and those in the
south, termed Tosk, with the Orthodox Greek Church. In Albania, one-half of
the Albanians are Moslem (about 500,000), and the other half divided, 300,000
Orthodox Greek and 200,000 Roman Catholic. Both spiritually and ceremonially
the three classes have much in common. Under King Zog I Albania made great
progress. The Albanian Orthodox Church is now using the Albanian language in
the services, the church has been declared autocephalous, and has translated
all the church books in the Albanian language. The Autocephalous Albanian
Orthodox Church is merely a question of administration, implying no change in
dogmas, doctrines, rites, or ceremonies.
1 This statement, which differs somewhatfrom that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious Bodle~~,
1~ he.s been revised by the Very Reverend Mark 1. Kondlli, archpriest, Albanian Orthodox Church,
Phuadelphla, Pa., and approved by him In Its presenttorm.

Albanian emigration to America is of recent origin, the result of the unrest and
strife of the whole region before and after the World War. It is estimated that
there are about 20,000 Albanians in the United States who have come from
Albania, besides those of Albanian origin who have come from the settlements of
Greece and Italy. There were more, but after Albania gained her liberty and
independence many went back. In the United States they organized national,
educational, and musical societies and clubs, of which the most important is the
Albanian Federation-Vatra, the "Hea.rth"-which played a leading part in the
struggle for independence. They founded the Federation under the leadership
of His Excellency Faik Konitza, Minister of Albania in Washington, an exceedingly
preeminent man of letters.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
Churches of this group are--3 in Boston, Mass.; 1 in Natick, Mass.; 1 in Wor-
cester, Mass.; 1 in Southbridge, Mass.; 1 in Bridgeport, Conn.; 2 in Philadelphia,
Pa.; and 1 in Jamestown, N.Y., with an attendance of about 5,000. There were
only 6 priests for the 10 churches. Lately, four priests were sent from Albania to fill
the vacancies. The Very Reverend Mark J. Kondili, mitered archpriest, Phila-
delphia, Pa., is in communication with the Holy Synod of Albania and also with all
the canonical authorities of the different nationalities of the Eastern Orthodox
Church in the United States. There is a movement to unite all these churches
under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Holy Synod of Albania with an administra-
tor who will officially be appointed by the Holy Synod.

558 CEN'SUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
This American church was instituted on May 20, 1932, and incorporated under
the Religious Corporation Laws of the State of New York on April 17, 1933, as
a National Church of the Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Faith and Rite for
all men indiscriminately.
DOCTRINE
In the provisions of our charter, it is plainly stated that the American Holy
Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern Church, which spiritually owns no head
but the head of the Christian faith, Jesus Christ our Lord, is inseparably joined
in faith with the great church of Constantinople and with every other orthodox
eastern church of the same profession. In common, therefore, with all other
eastern orthodox we accept: The Holy Scriptures as the source of divine truth,
to be interpreted in accordance with the teachings of the holy fathers and the
ecumenical councils. We believe that Christ alone is the head of the church in
heaven and on earth. That the church is infallible and that this is given expres-
sion through her ecumenical councils, as it is in this body, the whole company of
true believers vest their authority-therefore this council alone can both bind
and speak for the whole church. We hold that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father alone. That Mary is the mother of God, and that she was a perpetual
virgin, and honor her highly. We honor the nine orders of the angels and the
saints. We reverence the saints, pictures of holy subjects, and the cross.
We hold that there are seven sacraments, namely: Baptism, chrismation (or
confirmation), Holy Eucharist (or communion), penance, holy orders, marriage,
and holy unction. We practice and hold that the proper form of baptism is by
threefold immersion, but in cases of absolute necessity other forms are accepted.
In keeping with the practice of the primitive church chrismation (or confirma-
tion) is administered Immediately after baptism and the Infant or adult Is there-
after admitted as a communicant of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
It is believed that the Holy Eucharist is the sacrament at which the believer.
under the forms of bread and wine, partakes of the very body and blood of Christ,
to everlasting life-that it is to be received after confession and absolution. We
hold that holy unc'tion is for the sick as well as for those in danger of death. We
hold that those having departed with faith, but without having had time to bring
forth fruits worthy of repentance, may be aided toward the attainment of a
blessed resurrection by prayers offered in their behalf, especially such as are
offered in union with the oblation of the bloodless sacrifice of the body and
blood of Christ, and by works of mercy done in faith for their memory; that
for justification, faith accompanied by works is necessary; and that the Niceo-
Constantinopolitan Creed in its original form to be the one authoritative symbol
of faith for the church.
We reject: The dogma that teaches that the Pope of Rome is the vice regent
of Christ on earth and that he is the supreme and infallible head of th~ church on
earth; the doctrine of the surplus merits of the saints and of indulgences; the
immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary; the "filioque" phrase as being a
Roman, or Latin, addition to the Nicene Creed; and the doctrine of purgatory.
Generally speaking, the worship of this church is conducted in the eastern rite,
commonly called the Greek Rite, more properly the Byzantine. However, it
receives into communion and affiliates other churches, who, while one in faith,
retain their own national and individual characteristics in the canonical order,
the office ritual, and the liturgy.
ORGANIZATION
This church is autocephalous, exercising its sovereign rights, independent of
every other church. We are, therefore, a church whose chief bishop does not
acknowledge the authority and jurisdiction of any other bishop. But is, together
with all other organs of church administration, responsible to the National Coun-
ciL This body is the supreme authority, legislative, administrative, judicial,
and supervisory. Its membership consists of bishops, clergy, and laity. The

head of the ecclesiastical administration is the primate. The council meets in
every third year on the Tuesday after the first Monday in September. Con-
jointly with the primate two elective bodies manage the affairs of the church be-
tween National Councils, namely: The Holy Synod and the Supreme Ecclesiastical
Council. The Holy Synod consists of the primate who is a permanent member and
its president and the primatiallocum tenens and such other bishops as may be
elected by the National Council or designated and appointed by the primate, sub-
ject to confirmation by the National Council. Its function is hierarchical and pas-
toral in character. The Supreme Ecclt>.siastical Council, besides the primate-
president, consists of a definite number of bishops, clergy, and laity, selected by
the primate or the National Council. It is concerned mainly with the external
relations of the church, such as economics, finances, business concerns, and the
legal aspect of the life of the church. They meet either separately or jointly, at
the call of the primate.
The National Council of 1935 authorized the primate to federate Christian
bodies of other rites who accept or have adopted for themselves the confession of
faith of the Orthodox Catholic Eastern Church; to recognize by covenant that
such federated body is a sovereign power, retaining the management of its own
affairs or they may be affiliated by merger; and to designate and appoint bishops
of the federated churches with seat in the National Council, and with seat in the
Holy Synod of the American church. To further the purpose of developing a
united and efficient administration and work for the whole of the American church
and federated bodies, there was authorized and created a jurisdictional body,
possessing territorial and governing rights· thi.~ body being designated and
described as The American Holy Orthodox Catholic Patriarchate of Washington
D. C., and to be commonly known as The Patriarchate of Washington; that the
members of the Holy Synod of the American church, including the bishops of the
federated churches, should constitute the provisional patriarchal synod; and that
upon a membership of 13 bishops inclusive of the patriarchal locum tenens, the
synod will thereupon elect one of its members, by two-thirds vote, patriarch. The
National Council designated the primate of the American church to serve during
the interim as patriarchal locum tenens and vested him with patriarchal powers.
The Provisional Patriarchal Synod is gradually developing into a coordinating
synod representing all national groups of independent status and is a responsible
body with a unified program of work. The patriarch is a visible symbol of its
spiritual unity.
WORK
In every community wherein we are established we seek to serve our people and
all others who seek our ministrations through a threefold effort along not only
religious, but social and educational lines. Our relationship to other orthodox
bodies may be indicated thus: We claim and exercise spiritual jurisdiction only
over those who declare their acceptance of the doctrine, discipline, and worship of
this church, irrespective .of their race, nationality, language, or previous form of
organization or affiliation, and throughout any other part of the world wht-re the
church shall establish any mission or engage in any other activity within its scope
and objects. Our growth since our institution indicates that there is a need for a
church of this type. Since 1932 we have grown to the extent that there are today
5 bishops, 16 clergy, 9 parishes and missions, with a membership of about 1,700.
Some of our people possess their own property, while others have to worship and
conduct their activities in rented or leased quarters. The executive office of the
church is located at Maspeth, New York, N.Y.

APOSTOLIC E:PISOOPAL CHURCH 561
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
This body is an English-speaking primitive Catholic Church of Apostolic
Eastern Orthodox faith and order, an American church free from all ecclesiastical
and political alliances. Its object is to proclaim the Gospel of Christ to all man-
kind, regardless of race or nationality, and to administer the holy sacraments
according to the primitive religious rites and customs of the East to the American
people.
The organization of this church, as an independent American body, grew out
of a missionary movement on the part of a group of American churchmen to
provide spiritual ministrations for the scattered adherents of the ancient Eastern
Catholic (Chaldean) rite. The movement began in 1922, but it was not until
1924 that the group succeeded in forming a definite religious society which took
the title "Anglican Universal Church of Christ in the United States of America
(Chaldean)."
Through canonical authority, by representation and delegation from the
patriarchate of the ancient Chaldean Church and through the consecration of the
first American bishop of this rite, this church became an autonomous and in-
dependent church in America. Realizing that in this country the American
tradition requires separation of church and state, and that constitutional freedom
of religion is a great bulwark of American liberty, it was determined at the very
outset that this American church should be free and independent religiously, as
the Nation is free politically; and while this Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church
respects ancient traditions, nevertheless, it is a fundamental principle in this
church that a primitive Catholic Church in any nation may be free from all
foreign alliances. Such is the basic principle of our organization.
Naturally however, spiritually, this church is dependent upon a source for its
Orders in the ministry. On May 4, 1925, its episcopate was derived by the act of
consecration of Rev. Arthur Wolfort Brooks, under ecclesiastical name and
title Mar John Emmanuel, Titular Bishop of Sardis, according to the ancient
primitive Catholic (Chaldean) rite. The consecrator was Bishop Mar Antoine,
Bishops Mar James and Mar Evodius assisting. A French Canadian priest by
the name of Father Timothy participated. Bishop Brooks was at the time a
priest in Anglican orders, a former professor of the Greek Orthodox Seminary of
St. Athanasius. Thus, through Orders and the episcopal office and ancient
Chaldean rites, this infant church was spiritually united with the ancient church
of the East, which, according to tradition, had its origin before the end of the first
century as one of the early primitive churches founded by the Apostles.2
The Apostolic Episcopal Church is proud to acknowledge with gratitude the
source of its. apostolic episcopate. The true Chaldean Church should not be
confused with the N.estorians. There is not the slightest trace of the condemned
Nestorian heresy in this ancient Eastern Church of primitive, true Catholic
heritage. It is an Orthodox Apostolic Church.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine the Apostolic Episcopal Church differs very little from the other
Eastern churches of orthodoxy. In general it is thoroughly in accord with the
faith and order of the historic Catholic wing of Christendom, and similar in polity
and in worship. Its chief characteristic is that the liturgy-the Eucharist or
Mass-is general1y in the English language, since that is the language of the
United States. However, as it is a fundamental principle to minister in the
language of the people, this church also provides for services in other tongues
where the need requires.
The ancient, historic divine liturgies of St. James, St. Mark, St. Clement, St.
Thaddaeus, and St. John are all authorized for use in this church.
• This statement was furnished by Rt. Rev. Arthur Wolfort Brooks, Titular Bishop of Sardis, Apos·
toile Episcopal Church, Hollis, Long Island, N.Y., and approved by him In its present form.
• Tradition holds that the Chaldean Church was actually founded by the Apostle St. Thaddaeus, who,
with St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew, went out on the East Syrian mission to the gentilesfrom the church
In Antioch which was presided over by St. Peter, the Apostle, and the date is fixed at A. D. 51.

These are all translated into the English from their original language, or early
copies, which antedate the Ecumenical Council of Nice, 325 A. D. Ordinarily,
however, this church has a liturgy of its own, compiled from these and other early
church sources, a liturgy particularly adapted to American needs.
This body accepts seven sacraments--baptism, anointing (confirmation or
chrismation), commlmion, penance, holy orders, marriage, and holy unction.
The Eucharist (Mass or Divine Mystery), as it is referred to, is definitely regarded
as a sacrifice. The clergy may marry. The Nicene Creed is the symbol of the
faith. Divorced persons can only remarry, according to the religious rite, by dis-
pensation; but in order to do justice, the church has an ecclesiastical tribunal to
consider applications for dispensations in such cases, and any divorced baptized
person may apply to the church for dispensation. If dispensation is freely granted
by the tribunal the divorced person may marry again with the benediction of the
church, as though never married before, and one of the clergy may officiate.
Local parishes are under the care of an ordained priest, appointed either as
rector or vicar by the bishop. The bishop is the chief pastor, overseer, and shep-
herd of the church, and in every incorporated parish the bishop is by statute and
canon law one of the trustees. The Primate Bishop is the ecclesiastical adminis-
trator of the whole body. Each properly formed and incorporated congregation
is a unit of the synod, which is the governing ecclesiastical body. Each parish is
represented in the synod by the clergy and elected lay delegates. Provision is
made for the setting apart of women to the order of deaconess and office of mes-
sen~~;er. Religious orders may be formed and incorporated. The church is both
sacerdotal and evangelical, and provides for the ordination of men as readers and
preachers, teachers and evangelists, as well as the priesthood. The apostolic
constitutions are accepted as a guide in principles and tradition.
The organization of this body proceeded gradually. In 1927 Bishop Brooks
took under his jurisdiction a congregation located in Broad Channel (Far Rocka-
way), N. Y., at the request of the Brooklyn Federation of Churches. It was re-
organized, ecclesiastically constituted, and incorporated by the name of Christ's
Church By-the-Sea, and is now the see church of the bishop. In 1929 the Metro-
politan Synod was formed and on November 19, 1930, the first holy convocation
was held, at which time the Primate Bishop-Ecclesiastical Administrator was
rightly, canonically, and publicly enthroned at the loud acclaim of the people,
with Bishop Cornelius Nicholas, an orthodox bishop, and Archpriest John The-
opolus performing the rite at the request of the clergy and lay delegates.
In 1932 the legislature of the State of New York gave legal status to this body
by enacting a special article of the Religious Corporations Law (art. 3-A., chap.
597 of the Laws of 1932) which became a law on Aprill, 1932, when it was signed by
the governor, Bon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, now President of the United States.
In 1933 the law was amended providing for granting of ecclesiastical degrees of
orders in theology, which became a law on April 3, 1933, when it was signed by
Gov. Herbert H. Lehman. Under this legislative charter, the Apostolic Episcopal
Church, its metropolitan synod, its several parishes in New York, and its religious
orders are incorporated. ·
WORK
This religious body is in its infancy, but it is gradually expanding. While it
began as a purely missionary movement aimed to provide spiritual ministrations
to a particular group, it knows no bounds whatsoever regarding race, color, or
nationality, and ministers to all who come to the church. No longer is its work
confined to foreign-born Chaldeans, but it now ministers to Anglo-Saxon, Irish,
Germanic, Nordic, Armenian, Chaldean, and Syrian Christians--all Americans,
but whose ancestral lineage is traced to these various stocks. Also, this church
has several congregations made up of colored people of African lineage, and those
who have come to this country from the West Indies and the Caribbean islands.
This branch of the ancient historic primitive Catholic Church proclaims its
ideal as follows:
The brotherhood of man in the Fatherhood of God, in union with the Son,
Jesus Christ, true God and true man, bound in the true unity of the Holy
Spirit, is the only foundation of fellowship in the Universal Church; which
must be above all class, racial, and national differences, as the outward and
visible expression of the spirit of Christ. On this principle of Christian fellow-
ship we hope to build for the future, and trust we may prove to be worthy of
the noble heritage of the East, which has inspired this body to do its part to
uplift humanity.

STATISTICS
The data given for 1936 represent five active Bulgarian Orthodox churches, all
reported as being in urban territory. These statistics were compiled from schPd-
ules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches
and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this body is of two types, communicant members, or all
persons, including infants, baptized and confirmed in the church; and parish
members, or the families of the congregation, the head of the family being the
voting member.
Comparative data, 1916-36.-Table 1 presents, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of thi~ church for the census years
1936, 1926, and 1916. It is probable that the decrease in membership between
1916 and 1926 is accounted for in part by differences in the method of reporting
at the two censuses, as well as by decreasing immigration.

With the introduction of Christianity into Bulgaria as a state religion, in the
second half of the ninth century, during the reign of the Christianized Tsar, Boris,
a Bulgarian church organization under an archbishop sent from Byzantium was
instituted. As the Bulgarian state grew in political importance and territorial
expansion, and the rulers of Bulgaria laid claim to the title of "tsar" or king, the
head of the Bulgarian Church also assumed the title of patriarch, as the chief
of an autonomous organization. This title was formally recognized by the patri-
arch of Constantinople, with the consent of the patriarchs of Antioch, Alexan-
dria, and Jerusalem, at a local church council held in the town of Lampsacus,
on the Hellespont, in 1235, and was borne by the subsequent heads of the Bul-
garian Church up to 1394, when Bulgaria lost her political independence to the
Turks and her ecclesiastical autonomy to the Greeks. But in Macedonia, at the
town of Ohrida, an archbishopric, founded in the latter part of the tenth century
under the name of "Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrida," subsisted until 1767,
when it also was abolished by a decree of the Turkish Sultan, and its dioceses
were incorporated with those of the Greek patriarchate of Constantinople. Thus
I Thia statement, which is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been taken from the records of the Holy Synod in Sofia according to a report from the
Bulgarian Lej(atlon, and approved in its present form.

BULGARIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH 565
all the Bulgarians living in the Turkish Empire were placed under the spiritual
jurisdiction of the Greek patriarch, and, owing to the identity of religion, were
classed a.s Greeks.
The first movement of the Bulgarians to secure recognition of their ecclesia.stical
rights as a national unit, distinct from the Greeks, started in 1859, when the de-
mand was made that all dioceses or districts where the Bulgarians were in the
majority should have Bulgarian bishops, that church services should be conducted
in Slavic and not in Greek, and that in the schools the Bulgarian language should
be the medium of instruction. On the refusal of the Greek patriarch to meet
these demands, on the ground that they were contrary to the canons of the church,
the Bulgarian people, through duly appointed delegates, pleaded their cause for
more than 10 years with the Turkish Government. Finally, in 1870, the Sultan
issued a decree or charter instituting a Bulgarian church organization under the
name of "Exarchate," and in 1872 the first Bulgarian Exarch was chosen by a
National Council. In the same year the Greek patriarch called together a local
church council in Constantinople, composed exclusively of Greek clericals, which
declared the newly instituted Bulgarian church schismatic, on the ground that it
introduced racial distinction as an innovation into the church. The patriarch of
Jerusalem alone, of those present at the council, refused to sign the decision, con-
sidering it unjust. As the Bulgarian Church organization was merely a question
of administration, implying no change in dogmas, doctrines, rites, or ceremonies,
the Russian, Serbian, and Roumanian churches likewise declined to accept the
charge of schism as legal or valid. The Bulgarian Exarchate, therefore, is not a
separatist body that has seceded from the Eastern Orthodox Church, to which
the Russian, Roumanian, and Serbian churches also belong, for it has not changed
in its beliefs, tenets, creed, and form of polity, which remain exactly what they
always have been and what they were when the Bulgarians were under the spiritual
jurisdiction of the Greek patriarch.
Prior to the Macedonian insurrection of 1903 there was very little Bulgarian
immigration to the United States. The immigrants who did come, however,
sent back such attractive stories of the situation and the opportunities in this
country that, when the conditions in Macedonia became intolerable, large numbers
from that section found homes in the United States. These in turn were followed
by considerable immigration from Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia. No figures
are available, as the immigration reports give all these as coming from European
Turkey, but it has been claimed that as many as 10,000 a year came over in some
years prior to 1909. For a time there was very little done for their spiritual or
ecclesiastical care, but a few churches have been organized since 1907, and these,
since 1922, have been under the control of the Bulgarian Orthodox Mission of
America and Canada, which is itself under the state synod of Bulgaria. Since
the outbreak of the World War, there has been some return migration to Bulgaria,
but not so much as to other European countries.
The Bulgarians formerly belonged to the smaller national groups of Orthodox
in America who were under the Russian hierarchy and who had churches com-
posed strictly or chiefly of their countrymen. Today, the Bulgarian clergy in
the United States are attached directly to the synod of Bulgaria. The mem-
bership of the churches in the United States is composed of Bulgarians from the
kingdom of Bulgaria, and from Macedonia, Thrace, Dobrudja, and other parts
of the Balkan Peninsula.
The Holy Synod in Bulgaria established in January 1938 a bishopric in the
United States, and in July of the same year the first head of this bishopric was
appointed, in the person of His Grace, the Bishop of Velichky, with the seal of
his bishopric in New York City.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The state religion of Bulgaria is that of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, but
all other denominations are allowed free exercise. According to statistics given
for 1934, the whole population was 6,077,939; and of these, 5,128,890 belonged
to the Eastern Orthodox Church; 831,200 were Mohammedans, and 45,000 were
Roman Catholics.
The Bulgarian Church is governed by a synod of which the Exarch, as primus
inter pares, is the president. The religious affairs of non-Orthodox Christians

Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 2 presents in convenient form for compari-
son, a summary of the available statistics of the Greek Orthodox Church (Hellenic)
for the census years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906. The number of organizations
given for 1906 included in some instances entire communities, but in 1916 and 1926
only well organized churches were reported. The decrease in members between
1916 and 1926 was probably due to the decrease in immigration.

During the period from 1890 to the World War the number of Greeks immigrat-
ing to the United States increased greatly. Some came from Greece, some from
the Greek islands of the Aegean Sea, Dodecanese, and Cyprus, and others from
Constantinople, Smyrna, and other parts of Asia Minor. The;v were largely un-
married men, or, if married, they had left their families behmd them and had
scattered over the country, those from the same section usually keeping together.
As they became to·a certain extent permanent residents, and especially as they
were joined by their families, they felt the need of religious services, particularly
in case of marriage, sickness, and death. Accordingly, application was made by
the communities to the ecclesiastical authorities of their own sections, and priests
were sent to this country, sometimes by the Holy Synod of Greece and sometimes
hy the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. These priests formed
<'hurches in the larger centers and also congregations in places within easy reach,
which they visited more or less regularly as convenient.
• This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Mr. Demetrius E. Valakos, secretary, Greek Archdiocese of North and
South America, Astoria, Long Island, N.Y., and approved by him in its present form.

GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH (HELLENIC) 573
As in the case of the early Russian chnrches, there was at first no central organi-
?.ation, each priest holding his ecclesiastical relation wit.h the s~nod or patri-
archate which sent him to this country. In 1908 the Ecumenical Patriarchate of
Constantinople resigned its ecclesiastical relations to the Greeks in America in
favor of the Holy Synod of Greece, which had decided to send to America a Greek
(Hellenic) bishop.2
Yet the first serious effort to organize the Greek churches of America was made
only in 1918, when Bishop Alexander, of Rodostolou, was sent to America by the
Synod of Greece as the first bishop and synodical delegate.
According, however, to the holy canons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the
spiritual jurisdiction and supervision over the Orthodox Churches in the Diaspora
belong to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople; and the transfer of its
rights to the Church of Greece by an act, known as the Tome of 1908, was only
provisional and due only to certain special considerations. But, as soon as con-
ditions changed, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, in March 1922,
revoked the measure, took again the churches in the Diaspora under its direct
canonical supervision and, in May 1922, by a synodical and patriarchal act,
known as the Founding Tome of 1922, established the Greek (Orthodox) Arch-
diocese of North and South America, consisting of four bishoprics, and promoted
Bishop Alexander (formerly of Rodostolou) to the rank of Archbishop of North
and South America.
In August of the same year the Second General Convention of the Archdiocese
of America convened in New York and adopted the constitution of the Greek
Archdiocese of North and South America, based on the patriarchal Tome of 1922.
After this constitution was ratified by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Con-
stantinOJ?le, the bishops of Chicago, Boston, and San Francisco were elected by
the provmcial conventions of each diocese.
In 1930, owing to certain dissatisfaction and divisions in the church, the
Greek bishops in America-with the exception of the bishop of San Francisco-
were translated to various dioceses in Greece, and a new Archbishop of America
was appointed, The Most Reverend Athenagoras, formerly Metropolitan of
Corfu, Greece, who came here in February 1931.
The Greek parishes in America have been all united under the new Archbishop.
The former d10ceses were suspended and a new constitution, with slight changes,
was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Archbishop Athenagoras retained
the Right Reverend Callistos, Bishop of San Francisco, as his assistant bishop.
The Fourth General Convention of the Archdiocese, held in New YorK, in
November 1931, adopted the riew constitution and a number of bylaws for the
various activities and departments of the archdiocese.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The Greek Archdiocese of North and South America is in accord with other
Eastern Orthodox churches in doctrine; its polity and worship, while in principle
the same as in those churches, vary somewhat in form to meet the peculiar needs.
There are about 250 organized congregations and churches under the jurisdic-
tion of the Greek Archdiocese of North and South America. There are also about
50 missions and parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Diocese, recognizing the
juristliction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and affiliated with
the archdiocese, under Right Reverend Bishop Bohdan.
WORK
The entire organization of the Greek parishes is practically on a home mission-
ary basis. The priest in charge of a central church or congregation looks after
the social as well as the spiritual interests of his fellow countrymen, wherever
they may be.
The archdiocese supervises the function of about 450 parochial and 200 Sunday
schools, and maintains one theological preparatory school, situated at Pomfret,
Conn. There are also over 250 branches of the Greek Ladies Philoptochos So-
ciety, a benevolent organization for the care of the poor. The "Orthodox Ob-
server," a biweekly publication, is the official organ of the archdiocese.
' See Eastern Orthodox Churches, p. 649. In view of the very general use of the term "Greek" to describe
the entire Eastern Orthodox Church In all its branches, the term "Hellenic" is used to designate specl1lcally
the Ea.qtern Orthodox Church of Greece, governed by the Holy Synod of Greece and to the Greeks or
Constantinople governed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

HOLY ORTHODOX CHURCH IN AMERICA
STATISTICS
The data given !or 1936 represent four active organizations of the Holy Ortho-
dox Church in America, all reported as being in urban territory. The total
membership reported was 804. Of the four active organizations, one reported
from New York, is the only organization having a church edifice and parsonage.
The other organizations, one each in Alabama, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, are
considered missions. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly
to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data
relate to these churches only.
The membership of the Holy Orthodox Church in America consists of all
persons who have been confirmed in this church.
This body was not reported prior to 1936, hence no comparative data are
available.
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The historical and doctrinal statement of the Eastern Orthodox Churches as
given in this publication is the general background of the Holy Orthodox Church
in America. This church endorses the canons of the Seven Oecumenical Councils
of the undivided church, the apostolical constitutions, and the teachings of the
early church fathers, and follows them insofar as it is possible to do so in the
present age.
It is obvious that many of these canons related to extant cau,.es and conditions
and have become obsolete. Many of them are ignored by the Orthodox Church
as relating to matters which no longer exist. Some are interpreted in the light
of the progressive intelligence of the age. It is the intent of the Holy Orthodox
Church in America to keep alive the spirit that first brought them into being and
to use them as its guide in every way possible and practical.
The Holy Orthodox Church in America represents a movement. This movement
was instituted in 1924 for the purpose of emphasizing the mystical nature of the
sacrament:;. in the light of the newer understanding of Christian mysticism, first,
as exemplified by the great mystics of the Universal Church at considerable time
periods; and second, as exemplified by the modern understanding of Christian
mysticism as a "personal experience of God," along the lines made so clear by
St. Francis, and the eminent writer on the subject, Evelyn Underhill.
For some 10 years this movement took the form of lectures, classes, and writings,
until it was felt that the church organization under which they had first been
propagated was insufficient for the purpose.
About 1927-28 Archbishop Aftimios was mandated by the Metropolitan
Platon to institute a work specifically for the offspring of Orthodox parents, born
in this country, and educated at American public schools; and, at the same time,
to introduce Orthodoxy to English-speaking peoples. In the ancient liturgies of
this "Mother of Churches," the group previously mentioned found the perfect
vehicle for its own purpose.
In 1927 the Patriarch Tikhon, of Moscow, authorized Archbishop Aftimios
"to found and head under a synodical constitution, an independent American
Orthodox Catholic Church." Under this authority, Archbishop Aftimios assisted
by Bishops Sophronius and Joseph consecrated Rev. William A. Nichols to the
episcopate, as titular bishop of Washington, D. C.
Somewhat later the retirement of Archbishop Aftimios prevented the prosecu-
tion of the original plans and Bishop Ignatius (theW. A. Nichols just mentioned),
consecrated the present Primus, George Winslow Plummer, instituting the new
Metropolitan Synod of the Holy Orthodox Church in America. The consecration
of Dr. Plummer (Georgius) was followed by the consecration of Bishops Patricius
and Jrenaeus, forming the hierarchy of the new ecclesiastical body. This was
in 1934.
' This statement was furnished by Rt. Rev. George Winslow Plummer, primate, the Holy Orthodox
Church in America, New York City.

HOLY ORTHODOX CHURCH IN AMERICA 575
On March 16, 1936, chapter 105, entitled "An act to amend the religious
corporations law, in relation to incorporation of parishes or churches of the Holy
Orthodox Church in America," was passed with the approval of the Governor.
This act "of enablement" gives the new body wide powers relative to the creation
and institution of religious orders, seminaries, or religious societies established for
evangelical efforts, or the relief of the poor and needy, placing such power in the
hands of the Metropolitan Synod of the Holy Orthodox Church in America and
the archbishop-administrator thereof.
Since this act by the New York State Legislature the work of this church has
grown most encouragingly. It has not as yet undertaken any wide propaganda.
Instead, it has devoted the interval to the completion of its synodical boards, and
the preparation of the liturgies of St. Basil and St. John Chrysostom for use in
English-speaking congregations. It has also been occupied in the preparatiOn of
suitable canons applying to the necessities of American customs and usages.
It has made several concessions to the western usage by way of seats, instead
of the older custom of standiJ!g; organ and instrumental music; mixed choirs; and
conformity to the Western Calendar (Gregorian), the use of the latter having
been authorized by the Patriarch of Constantinople for the Orthodox who desired
it, in 1923. The confusion between the times of the observance of the great
feasts of the church in this country has been a prime obstacle in the progress of
the Orthodox Church in the United States as well as elsewhere. Nevertheless,
it already has a rapidly growing membership, which is, of course, by Orthodox
baptism and chrismation.
The original intention to emphasize the mystical nature of the Christian sacra-
ments beyond the ordinary doctrinal catechisms has been amplified manyfold
by the adoption of Orthodox Orders and alignment with orthodoxy. The
Orthodox Church, despite its many national groups and consequent variety of
local customs, perpetuates so much of the usages of primitive Christianity and
preserves the unvaried usage of the ancient liturgies with their wealth of tradition
that the authorities of the Holy Orthodox Church in America firmly believe that
no better impetus can be given a better understanding of the essential mysteries
of the sacramental system than by a clear exposition of the liturgies and offices of
Orthodoxy in toto.
While carefully preserving the essentials of primitive catholicity, this church
encourages the utmost liberality of thought and action, believing and finding
that through an intelligent understanding of what the Catholic faith stands for
removes all possibilities of conflict between the two. Thus it seeks to bring to bear
the best findings of scientific, religious, and philosophic thought on matters which
have, in the past, been sources of wide controversy and contentious argument.
In its use of the ancient liturgies the Holy Orthodox Church in America permits
no changes or variations. It does seek to present them in a manner more readily
understandable to Americans. Like so many other national groups, the Holy
Orthodox Church in America is autonomous but fully recognizes the l.'piritual
supremacy of the Patriarch of Constantinople.
It is far from the intention of the authorities of the Holy Orthodox Church in
America to add another sect, or denomination, to the already overgenerous list.
It regards itself solely as a branch of the Holy Eastern Orthodox Catholic and
Apostolic Church with a definite mission to present the sacraments of the Catholic
Church in their true mystical nature through a progressive interpretation of the
offices of Orthodoxy.

lfiSTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
The great majority of the people of Rouma.nia. belong to the Roumanian Ortho-
dox Church, in communion with the Greek, Russian, Serbian and other Orthodox
churches. Until 1900-1902 there were few Roumanian immigrants in this
country, but today there are about 150,000. With very few exceptions they are
from the Roumanian Provinces of Transylvania, Banat, and Bukovina, which
before the World War were parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They
settled first in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and
Indiana. Most of them are railroad and factory workers or farmers, and the
great majority of them belong to the Roumanian Orthodox Church.
1 Tbls statement, which is substantially the same as that published In vol. IT or the Report on Religious
Bodies,1926, bas been revised by the Very Reverend John Trutia, dean and counselor or the Roumanian
Orthodox Episcopate of America, Cleveland, Ohio, and approved by him In ita present form.

DOCTRINE
The source of the doctrine of this church, like that of all the other Eastern
Orthodox Churches, is the divine revelation as it is contained in the Holy Scrip-
tures and in the Holy Traditions. The unchanged foundation of this doctrine
is the Niceo-Constantinopolitan Creed, together with all the decisions given in
matters of faith by the ecumenical and particular synods of the Holy Fathers of
the church.
ORGANIZATION
The Roumanian Orthodox Church of the United States and Canada, since April
1929, is organized in "The Roumanian Orthodox Episcopate (Diocese) of America,"
presided over by a bishop, whose see is in Detroit, Mich.; 44 organized congrega-
tions and churches comprise the episcopate (diocese).
In matters of faith and doctrine the Roumanian Orthodox Episcopate of America
recognizes the canonical and spiritual authority of "The Holy Synod" (House of
Bishops) of the Roumanian Orthodox Church of Roumania of which body the
hishop of the American diocese i~ a de jure member.
In all administrative matters the episcopate (diocese) is an autonomous orgaui-
zation, canonically recognized as such by the Holy Synod of the Roumanian Ortho-
dox Church. The rules of church administration are contained and set in "The
Constitution and Bylaws" of the Roumanian Orthodox Episcopate of America
adopted and approved by the church-congresses (general conventions) of 1932 and
1936. The supreme administrative body is "The Church Congress" (convention)
consisting of one-third clergy and two-thirds lay delegates (representatives) of the
congregations (parishes) comprising the episcopate (diocese) . The church-congress
delegates are elected for 3-year terms, and meet in sessions every year under the
presidency of the bishop.
WORK
The vrincipul work of the clliii'Ch, being Christ.iun' consists of I"'"'"'"i JJg t.hc
(;o,..pd of Christ, of propagating Christian, moral, and ethical principles, and caring
for tlw religious and spiritual needs of its members.
For t.he religious education of children and young people, weekday catechetical
and Sunday-school classes are maintained in every congregation (parish), the
priest doing the teaching.
The episcopate publishes, at Detroit, Mich., a weekly religious-educational
newspaper, "The Herald," and a yearly "Calendar" (almanac) .

Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 2 presents, in convt-nient form for compari-
son, a summary of the available statistics of the Russian Orthodox Church for
the census years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906. Differences in the method of report-
ing as well as organic disturbances probably account, in part, for the decrease in
members.

Russia first came into definite relations with Christianity on the visit of Princess
Olga to Constantinople, where she was baptized about A. D. 957. Subs~uently,
Vladimir the Great sent emissaries to thedifferent churche11, Eastern and Western,
to learn of their doctrines and rituals, with a view to adopting those which they
liked best. The emissaries returned and reported in favor of the Eastern Ortho·
dox Catholic Church, whose ceremonial in the Cathedral of the Holy Wisdom at
Constantinople seemed to them to ext'el all others. Thereupon, "1adimir was
baptized in 988 A. D. and the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church became the
church of the state.
During the succeeding centuries the church was governed, first, by metropoli·
tans looking to the patriarch of Constantinople as their titular head; from about
1589 to 1720 by patriarchs equal to the other Eastern Patriarchs of Antioch,
Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Constantinople; and from 1721 to 1917 by the Holy
Synod. This synod was a collegiate institution consisting of several metropoli-
tans and bishops from all parts of Russia, who were invited to take a temporary or
permanent part in its sessions. To see that the civil laws and interests of the
country were complied with, a representative of the monarch sat in the synod as
a civil officer, with the title of Chief Procurator of the Holy Synod. To his pres-

cuce iu the syuud is due the incorrect opinion, widely extended outside of Russia,
that the Emperor "'ll-R r~>ally the head of the Rus;;ian rhurch, under the Czarist
regime.
For many years previous to the World War the Russian Church had been pre-
paring for a great council or conclave of representatives of all the Russian dioceses
and missions, to determine many questions of policy, organization, and adminiR-
tration that had arisen and persisted since 1720. The very constitution of its
organization as laid down under Peter the Great was outgrown and obsolete.
Preliminary committees, councils, and conventions between 1900 and 1915 had
prepared the way and the program for the work of the great Pan-Russian Church
conclave, or Sobor, as it is called in Russian. The World War was not permitted
to interfere with the holding of the Great Sobor. In 1917 delegates from all
Russia, from Siberia, from Alaska and other parts of North America, and from
China and Japan, representing every part of the Russian Church and its mission11,
assembled in Moscow for what has since been known as the Great Sobor of 1917.
The Great Sobor revised the constitution and administrative enactments of
the Russian Church. It determined upon a return to the patriarchal form of
supreme government for the church. While it was meeting, the Kerensky pro-
visional government was overthrown by the Red Revolution of October. Under
the gunfire of the Soviet revolutionists the Great Sobor elected and enthroned a
Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, in succession to that sainted Nikon whose
power had made Peter the Great tremble and decree the end of the office of
Patriarch.
With the reestablishment of the Patriarchate and the installation of the Patri-
arch Tikhon at its head, the Great Sobor closed its sessions. Unfortunately
for both church and state, the Patriarchate and Patriarch Tikhon became at once
and inevitably the symbol of the old vanished r6gime, and the church was set in
opposition to the Soviet State on purely political as well as religious questions.
In the ensuing con,tlict Patriarch Tikhon was imprisoned and his assistants
exiled, imprisoned, or executed. The administration of the church was totally
disrupted. In these chaotic conditions reformist groups, sometimes sponsored
hy those fighting against the church, arose and divided the church into rival
factions.
Finally, in 1923, a coalition of these reformist groups, favored by and favorable
to the Soviet Government in its fight against Patriarch Tikhon and the church,
organized a new church administration, forcibly removed the bishops that would
not submit to their will, appointed bishops and clergy favorable to their reform
ideas, and to the Soviet regime, established a married episcopate (hitherto un-
known and uncanonical in the Russian Church, as in all the Orthodox Catholic
Churches since the Council of Chalcedon), and summoned a Russian Church
Convention.
This convention, called the Sobor or pseudo-Sobor of 1923, without the presence
or authority of the Patriarch, proceeded to depose the Patriarch Tikhon and un-
frock him in his absence and without trial. It then abolished the Patriarchate of
Moscow and all Russia; reversed the canon law of the Orthodox Catholic Church
in matters of the clergy and marriage; abolished monasticism in the Russian
Church; established a Synodist administration; and finally declared the commu-
nism of Karl Marx and Lenin essential to the salvation of all Christians, and
adherence to the Soviet State obligatory upon all Russian Orthodox people.
The reaction against the extremes of the Synodist group and its 1923 conven-
tion was so great in Russia that the Soviet Government sought peace with the
Patriarchal party by releasing Patriarch Tikhon and permitting him to reorganize
the Patriarchal administration. While in the midst of this work Patriarch
Tikhon died. It has been impossible for the Russian Patriarchate to hold a
Sobor for the election of his successor. His office has been held by a number of
substitutes, each in turn acting as locum tenens, or Guardian, of the Patriarchal
Throne.
To these and to the Patriarchate, the vast majority of Russian clergy and
parishes in Russia have remained faithful, while the Synodist group has lost influ-
ence and adherents steadily. The situation is still unsettled, and it is impossible
to make definite statements about the present condition or the future of the
Russian Church.
The Russian Church is the only branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church that
has undertaken in recent years any foreign missionary enterprise. It has de-
veloped quite extensive missions in Siberia, Japan, anrl China, bnt its great
work has been the care of the churches in America.

RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH 589
In 1759 a Russian merchant, named Glotoff, baptized several Aleuts of Umnak
Island. Fifteen years later Schelehoff, the organizer of a company for fur trading
in Alaska, baptized 40 Aleuts of Kodiak Island. In 1792, at his request, the
Holy Synod sent to Alaska a special mission consisting of eight monks, who estab-
lished their headquarters at Kodiak and built the first Eastern Orthodox Church
in America. In the course of 2 years 12,000 natives were baptized, and almost
every hamlet had its church or chapel. During succeeding years a number of
additional missionaries were sent from Russia, both to care for the Russians and
to do missionary work among the natives. Of these, John Veniaminoff, after-
wards Bishop Innocent, accomplished the most. Coming to Unalaska Island in
1824, he spent 10 years among the Aleuts, and then went to Sitka to teach the
Kolosh. Until he left for Siberia in 1855 he was an indefatigable worker for the
Alaskans. He prepared an alphabet and grammar of the Aleutian language;
translated the catechism, the more important divine services of the church, and
some books of the Bible, and did much for general education and the improve-
ment of civil and social life. In Sitka he built the cathedral which is titill an
ornament to the city and founded an ecclesiastical consistory for the government
of the churches.
After the change of political rule, accompanying the sale of Alaska to the
United States, many Russians returned to their own country, and with them a
large number of priests or missionaries. As a result, there was a loss of interest
in the country on the part of the people of Russia and an attendant loss of the
means for carrying on the missionary work. Furthermore, as traders of different
nationalities multiplied and missionaries of different creeds came to the country,
many natives were drawn away from the church. Nevertheless, the Russian
Church did not give up its work in the country, but continued to do whatever was
within its means.
In 1872 the see was removed from Sitka to San Francisco, where there were
already quite a number of Russians, Serbians, and Greeks. In 1888 Bishop
Vladimir came from Russia, remaining until 1891, when he was succeeded by
Bishop Nicholas, whose stay was noted for two important features: (1) An excep-
tional development of religious activity in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, which
found expression in the building of new churches, chapels, and schools; in the
increase in the number of missionaries; in the founding of various societies and
fraternities for charitable purposes and for the improvement of the moral condi-
tion of the natives; in the opening of asylums for children, etc.: (2) the enlarging
of the eparchy to include Canada and the Eastern States of the United States,
thus opening a new period in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church in the
United States.
In the more recent immigration, large numbers have come from the old Austria-
Hungary, especially from the former Galicia and Poland, who belonged to what
are known as the Uniat churches. When those sections, once a part of Russian
territory1 came under the control of Poland, and later of Austria-Hungary, and
thus unaer the general influence of the Roman Catholic Church, an arrangement
was effected, called the Unia, by which members of the Eastern Orthodox Churches,
while recognizing the supremacy of the Pope, were permitted to retain most of
their liturgy and have their own special bishops. These provisions, however, did
not hold outside of Austria-Hungary and, on coming to America, the members of
these churches found themselves compelled to use the liturgy of the Roman
Catholic Church and be under the jurisdiction of local bishops, who in general
either knew nothing about the Unia or did not take it into account.
In seeking relief from this position, one of the Uniat parishes in Minneapolis
became aware of the existence in the United StatE>.s of a see of the Russian Ortho-
dox Church and, in 1891, under the leadership of Rev. Alexis G. Toth, petitioned
the Russian Bishop Vladimir to take them all under his jurisdiction within
the pale of the Russian Church. Bishop Vladimir willingly complied with the
request and, during the time of Bishop Nicholas, who succeeded him, the example
of the parish in Minneapolis was followed by a number of Uniat parishes.
About the same time the immigration from Russia proper increased, and soon
purely Russian parishes were formed in New York and Chicago, although in the
former city there was an Orthodox Russian Church in existence as far back as
1876. In 1905 the episcopal see was transferred from San Francisco to New York
City and the mission was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese with an arch-
bishop and two vicar bishops, one for the diocese of Alaska and the other for the
Syrian Mission having its headquarters in the Diocese of Brooklyn, headed by an
Arabic-speaking bishop of the Russian jurisdiction.

With the growth of the archdiocese, two additional vicar bishoprics-Pitts-
bur~h and Canada-were added, and the church remained under the adminili-
trat!On of these five prelates until after the World War.
The history of the Russian Church in America since the World War and the
Russian Revolution has reflected the uncertainty and persecutions characteristic
of this period in the church of Russia. As already mentioned, the pseudo-Sobor
of 1923 in Moscow had declared communism essential to Christianity, and the
adherence to the Soviets obligatory; it then had appointed a pseudo synod, which
delegated to America an unfrocked priest, formerly of the Russian-American
clergy, with the title of metropolitan-archbishop, head of the Russian Church in
America. That man, armed with all credentials of the pseudo synod, instituted
legal proceedings and obtained possession of the Russian St. Nicholas Cathedral,
New York City, which was the see of the ruling bishop. At that time in Russia,
Patriarch Tikhon and his lawful administration were imprisoned and otherwise
isolated by the Soviets; therefore no direct legal evidence could be obtained from
them as to the authority or even the existence of the regular church administra-
tion in America, which remained faithful to the rules and canons of the Russian
Orthodox Church. This is how an agent of the Soviet supporting faction of the
church won possession of the Russian Cathedral in America. He has, however,
virtually no followers either among the clergy or the laity.
Metropolitan Platon, the then actual ruling bishop of the Russian Church in
America, was forced to move his sec from the Cathedral, New York City, to the
new cathedral, which was offered to him by Trinity Parish of the Protestant ·
Episcopal Church, New York City. It was one of Trinity's chapels which was
rebuilt and transformed into a Russian Cathedral, and now houses also the office
of the Metropolitan Council, governing body of the church.
Seeing the impossibility of any further connections with Moscow controlled
by Communism, Metropolitan Platon, in an epistle published in 1933, proclaimed
the Russian Orthodox Church in North America to be temporarily autonomous.
It so remains now.
In 1934, after the death of Metropolitan Platon, an all-American Sobor of the
church was convoked in Cleveland, Ohio. Theophilm:;, Archbishop of San
Francisco, was elected Metropolitan and head of the Russian Church in America
and Canada. He occupies that office today.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The general doctrine of the Russian Orthodox Church is in accord with that
of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, as given in the General Statement of this
publication.
In the United States the Autonomous Russian Orthodox Church is governed
by a metropolitan elected to that office for life by an all-American Conclave, or
Sobor. That Sobor is convened periodically to pass upon matters of the internal
organization of the church. It consists of all bishops and of delegates elected
from all parishes (one clerical and one lay from each) . The last Sobor was held
in New York City in October 1937.
The 10 Russian bishops in America form a council of bishops, with power to
rule upon matters of doctrine. That council is also being convened periodically.
The permanent governing body is the Metropolitan Council, consisting of
clerical and lay members elected by the all-American Sobor, and/or appointed by
the Metropolitan. That council, however, has but consultative power, its de-
cisions becoming effective only after they are approved by the Metropolitan. It
has a permanent secretary with offices in New York City.
The whole territory of the United States, Canada, and Alaska is divided into
11 bishoprics, and into 25 districts under district deans, periodically elected by the
clergy of the districts. They exercise local supervision.
Previous to the fall of the old regime of Imperial Russia the Holy Synod of
Russia allowed $77,850 annually for the maintenance of the epa.rchy, besides
which the Missionary Society of Russia. gave for its purely missionary work
$1,481. The bishops, the official institutions, and the officers of the eparchy
were supported by these appropriations, other expenses were met partly from the
same funds and partly from parish fees. Since 1918, however, the missionary
work and all the clergy have been supported, of necessity, by the contributions
from the local congregations, since the present Russian regime does not permit
funds to be provided from Russia.

WORK
While originally the archdiocese was a mission, at present almost the only
strictly missionary work is that carried on by the clergy of Alaska among the
Indians and Eskimos, and each year sees Alaskan and Indian converts brought
into the Russian Church. In the United States the clergy are almost entirely oc-
cupied with caring for the religious needs of immigrants from Europe who are
members of the Russian Church by birth or have returned to it from the Uniat
churches.
There are also converts in increasing numbers who come unsought from
Americans of other denominational allegiance or of none, but of non-Orthodox
ancestry. These are increasing as the church services and literature become
available in the English language.
The educational work of the archdiocese consists in the maintenance of schools
of various types, taught mostly by priests or readers. The Sunday schools are
few in number, more attention being paid to the parish schools, which are held
in some places only on Saturday, while in others they are held three times a
week, and in still others every evening, after the sessions of the public schools
are over. In these schools instruction is given in the Russian language, Russian
history, Bible history, the catechism, prayers, and church singing.
In 1938 a Russian Orthodox Seminary was organized in New York in coopera-
tion with Columbia University. High school graduates are given special courses
of preparation for priesthood, simultaneously with their regular studies for B. A.
and B. S. degrees at Columbia. During the same year another pastoral school
was opened in South Canaan, Pa.
A number of publications are devoted to the religious education of the members
of the church. The archiepiscopal cathedra of New York publishes a monthly
magazine entitled the Russian Orthodox American Messenger. The Bishop
of Chicago publishes for his diocese a monthly Russian journal called Our Way.
The Russian Orthodox Journal is published monthly in Euglish in Binghamton,
N.Y., as the organ of a nation-wide association of young people's societies known
as the Federated Russian Orthodox Clubs. A weekly paper, called the Light, is
published in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The Russian Archdiocese also publishes books
and pamphlets in various languages, chiefly Russian.

urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent
directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the
data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination is of two types, communicant members,
or all persons, including infants, baptized and confirmed in the church; and parish
members, or the families of the congregation, the head of the family being the
voting member.

for the census years 1936. 1926, 1916, and 1906. It is probable that the decrease
in membership in 1926 and 1916 is accounted for in part by differences in the
method of reporting, as well as by a decrease in immigration.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION '
The Serbian Orthodox Diocese of the United States of America and Canada is a
part of the Serbian Patriarchate in Yugoslavia (Europe), which in ita turn is a
branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, although independent of the same in
ita government. ·
The introduction of Christianity among the Serbians began in the seventh
century. It was first preached by the Greek Church of Constantinople. But
Christianity finally came to rule only in the ninth century, after the Slavs' first
apostles, St. Cyril and St. Methodiua, translated gospel and liturgical books into
the Slavonic language, which has been up to the present time the official church
language of the Serbs, the Russians, and the Bulgarians.
Up until the thirteenth century, the Serbian Church was under the juris-
diction of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople; only in the year 1219, under
the leadership of St. Sava, the first Archbishop, the Serbian Church became inde-
pendent, organized into the National Serbian Church, and as such, we see her
playing a very important role in the national life of the Serbian people.
In the middle of the fourteenth century, the Serbian Church was heightened
to the grade of a Patriarchate, with its center at the city of lpec (today called
Pech) . This was the period of the greatest height and glory of this church, the
time when the Serbian-Byzantine architecture and art reached its culmination, as
the following period, after the invasion of the Turks (1389 to 1815), was the time
of suffering and martyrdom for the faith. Even up to the present day one can
see the important and beautiful remains of the brilliant past of this church, espe-
cially the architecture and church art, which is evident, even today, in the many
old monasteries built in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
Today the Serbian Patriarchate consists of 26 dioceses, one of which is the
Diocese of the United States of America and Canada. The church is governed
by the Patriarch and the Holy Synod, whose sole members are the bishops. The
residence of both the Patriarch and the Holy Synod is in Belgrade, the capital of
Yugoslavia.
The Serbian people began to immigrate to the United StateR about the year
1890. The majority came from the territories which were under the Austro-
Hungarian rule, and the main reason, evidently, for leaving their native land, was
not merely economic, but more of a political nature, because conditions in pre-
war Austria-Hungary were very intolerable toward Slavs in general, and toward
the Serbians in particular.
Beginning their new life in the adopted country (the United States) they used
to attend Russian Churches and call upon Russian priests for services, because the
Russian Church here was the closest to them, not only in teaching and form, but
in language as well. In the beginning of the twentieth century, we see the first
organized Serbian parishes in Jackson, Calif.; Douglas, Alaska; McKeesport, Pa.;
Steelton, Pa.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; and Chicago, Ill. They were also under the
supervision of the Russian bishops.
In 1921 the Serbian Patriarchate founded a special diocese for the United
States and Canada, which received its first own bishop in 1926. Headquarters
and offices were established at St. Sava's Serbian Monastery, Libertyville, Ill.
Now this diocese has 36 parishes (church congregations). The bishop's residence
and church consistory for this diocese are now in Chicago, Ill.
t Thls statement was furnished by Rev. M. Stefanovich, secretary to Rt. Rev. Dr. Damaskln, Serbla.n
Orthodox Bishop for the Unlted States or America and Canada, Chicago, Jll.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox Church for the year
1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures
between urban and rural territory. There were four parsonages reported-one
each in the States of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas and Iowa. These
statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor
or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination is of two types, communicant members,
or all persons, including infants, baptized and confirmed in the church; and
parish members1 or the families of the congregation, the head of the family being
the voting memoer.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION1
The churches of this body represent the immigration into the United States
of communities from Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Iraq, connected with the
Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. Before the World War, although they all
had priests of their own, the great majority of these were under the general super-
vision of a Syrian coadjutor bishop under the jurisdiction of the Russian Church.
Their history is included in that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and in doctrine
and polity they are in harmony with the other bodies of the Eastern Church.
Up to 1934 the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox parishes in America were divided
in their spiritual allegiance into five groups, with five bishops, each at the head of a
group. Between 1933 and 1934 three of the five bishops passed away, and two
were excommunicated by the church. During the month of September 1934, the
Patriarchat-e of Antioch appointed the Very Reverend Archimandrite Antony
Bashir as patriarchal vicar for all the Syrian Orthodox people in North America
with full authority to unite all the parishes in America in one organization, to be
known as the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of New York and all North
America.
Under the leadership of the new patriarchal vicar, all the Syrian Orthodox
Churches and people in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America
were united in one organization known today as the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox
Archdiocese of New York and all North America, with headquarters in Brooklyn,
N.Y.
In February 1936, at the request of the olorgy and the people of the said
Syrian Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of New York and all North America,
the House of Bishops of the Patriarchate of Antioch, presided over by the supreme
head of the Syrian Orthodox Church, the Patriarch of Antioch, Alexander III,
elected Rt. Rev. Archimandrite Antony Bashir as an archbishop of New York and
all North America and head of the Syrian Antiochian Orthodox Church in North
America. Archbishop Bashir was consecrated in April1936 in Brooklyn, N.Y.
1 This statement, which differs somewhat from that published in vol. II of the Report on Relfrlons
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by the Most Reverend Archbl•hop Antony Basblr, Syrian Antiochfan Ortho-
dox Archdiocese of New York and all North America, Brooklyn, N.Y., and approved by him !nits present

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classiflcation.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America for
the year 1936 is presented in table I, which shows also the distribution of these
figures between urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from
schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual
churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination is of two types, communicant members,
or all persons, including infants, baptized and confirmed in the church; and
parish members, or the families of the congregation, the head of the family
being the voting member.
As the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America was reported for the first
time in 1936, no comparative figures are available.

msTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
Ukraine first came into definite relation with Christianity through the visit
of Princess Olga to Constantinople, where she was baptized about the year 957.
Subsequently the Ukrainian ruler of Kiev, Wolodimir the Great, sent emissaries
to the different churches, Eastern and Western, to learn of their doctrine and
rituals, with a view to adopting those which they liked best. The emissaries
returned and reported in favor of the Eastern Orthodox Church, whose ceremonial
in the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia seemed to them to excel all
others. Thereupon Wolodimir was baptized, and the Eastern Orthodox Church
became the church of the state of Ukraine. In the year 988 the whole Ukraine
accepted Christianity.
During the succeeding centuries the Ukrainian Church was governed by
metropolitans under the supreme jurisdiction of the Oecumenical Patriarchate of
Constantinople. From 1686 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was under the
jurisdiction of the Russian Patriarch of Moscow.
Mter the World War the Ukrainians in the United States of America started
to form their own church, and in 1928 the first Ukrainian Orthodox Church was
organized. In July 1931 the first church convention was called. In September
1932 Dr. Joseph Zuk was consecrated as the first bishop On February 23, 1934,
Dr. Zuk died. On February· 28, 1937, Archimandrite Theodore Shpylka was
consecrated as the second bishop of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America,
accepting the name Bohdan, by the Greek Archbishop, Most Reverend Athena-
goras, of New York City.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America, while recognizing the supreulf'
spiritual authority of the Oecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, is prac-
tically an autonomous and independent organization in all matters of adminis-
tration. It is canonically recognized as such by the Orthodox Churches every-
where.
In general, the Ukrainian churches are in accord with other Eastern Orthodox
Churches in doctrine; their polity and worship, while in principle the same as in
those churches, vary somewhat in form to meet the peculiar needs.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
The Evangelical and Reformed Church was established on June 26, 1934, at
Cleveland, Ohio. As such it has a very brief history, but since it was formed by
the union of two denominations, each of which had a long and honored history,
we must briefly trace these two streams as they moved on their separate ways
prior to the union.
The older of these two bodies is the Reformed Church in the United States.
It dates back to October 15, 1725, when the first communion was celebrated at
Falkner Swamp, about 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Pa. Prior to that date,
however, scattered congregations existed in eastern Pennsylvania and even as
far south as Virginia. Ministers were scarce and these groups of Reformed people
sometimes engaged the services of school teachers to conduct religious services.
There was as yet no organization to hold the widely 1<cattered congregations
together. In September 1747 Michael Schlatter, who had been sent to America
by the Synod of South and North Holland, organized the Coetus in Philadelphia.
This is a Latin term and means practically the same as the word Synod. It was,
however, subject to the Synod in Holland and made regular reports to that body,
from which it also received periodical aid. In 1793 the Coetus declared its
independence from Holland and reorganized itself under the name of The Synod
cf the German Reformed Church.
The church had no educational institutions, no boards, and no organized mis-
sionary work. These things came later in its history. The first missionary,
however, had been sent west of the Allegheny Mountains in 1783. Early in the
nineteenth centur:v missionaries were sent to North Carolina and to Ohio. People
began to settle in new parts of the country which had been offered for occupancy
and the church sent pastors to minister to these new settlements on the frontier.
In 1819 the Synod divided itself into eight districts known as Classes. In 1824
• This statement was furnished by Rev. Charles E. Schaeffer, D. D., general secretary of the Board of
Home Missions, Evangelical and Reformed Church, Philadelphia, Pa.

EVANG'ELICAL AND REFORMED CHURCH 615
the Ohio Classis organized itself into the Ohio Synod, with powers similar to those
belonging to the mother Synod in the East. In 1825 a theological seminary was
opened in Carlisle, Pa., which later was moved to York, Pa., and in 1836 to Mer-
cersburg, Pa. In 1871 the seminary was moved to Lancaster, Pa., where it is
now located. In 1826 the American Missionary Society of the German Reformed
Church was organized in Frederick, Md., and the Missionary Magazine was
started. A few years later this came to be known as the Reformed Church
Messenger. In 1838 the Board of Foreign Missions was organized in Lancaster,
Pa. The Ohio Synod patterned its work somewhat after that of the mother
Synod. It formed a Board of Missions, published a paper known as The Western
Missionary and founded a theological seminary which was first located in Canton,
Ohio, and later was moved to Tiffin, Ohio, and still later, after the union with
the Ursinus School of Theology, came to be known as Central Theological Semi-
nary at Dayton, Ohio. This seminary in 1934 united with Eden Theological
Seminary of the Evangelical Synod in Webster Groves, Mo. In 1863 the mother
Synod and the Ohio Synod united in forming the General Synod, which, after an
honored history of 70 years, ceased to function when the union of the Reformed
Church in the United States and tjle Evangelical Synod of North America took
place.
During its long history of over 200 years the Reformed Church developed its
missionary work at home and abroad; founded educational institutions; estab-
lished. homes for orphans, for old folks, and hospitals; and thus took its place
among the leading denominations of the country.
The Evangelical Synod of North America has also an interesting history to its
credit. It traces its origin in this country to a group of six ministers who met at
Gravois Settlement near St. Louisi Mo., on October 15, 1840, and formed the
Evangelical Union of the West. t will be observed that both the Reformed
Church and the Evangelical Synod have the same birthday, October 15, although
the former is 115 years older than the latter.
At first, the Evangelical Union partook largely of the nature of a ministerial
association, and it was not until1849 that the first congregation affiliated itself with
the same. Similar associations had sprung up in Ohio and further east, as also in
the northwest. All of these eventually, by 1872, joined themselves to the original
union with its center in St. Louis, and in 1877 adopted the name of the German
Evangelical Synod of North America. Many independent congregations of
German-speaking people, of either Lutheran or· Reformed backgrounds, identified
themselves with the denomination, and thus during the course of a century, the
Evangelical Synod developed into a strong and virile body. It followed the gen-
eral plan and program of all denominations in America and established a theologi-
cal seminary, first at Marthasville, then in St. Louis, and later at Webster Groves,
Mo.; a college at Evansville, Ind., which in 1872 was moved to Elmhurst, Ill.; and
boards for home and foreign missions, for Christian education, for ministerial
pensions, and for other activities in the church. It likewise made adequate provi-
sion for its orphans, its old folks, and its sick, in the form of homes and hospitals.
During the hundred years of its separate history it extended its borders into many
States of the Union, and came to occupy an honorable place among the denomina-
tions in America.
These two historic churches, in June 1934, after several years of friendly nego-
tiations, formed a new denomination under the name of Evangelical and Reformed
Church, each bringing into the union the rich heritage of the history of the past,
with the conviction that by so doing they were following the leadings of Providence
and were answering tho prayer of Christ that "they may all be one," and thu~
would be equipped to render a greater service in the interests of the kingdom of
God.
Through this union the Evangelical and Reformed Church has 2,900 congrega-
tions which are distributed throughout the United States and in 2 provinces of
Canada, with a total membership of 652,000. It has church property valued as

DOCTRINE
. The Evangelical and Reformed Church, true to its name, believes in the Bible.
It believes that the Bible is the Word of God, that God hath spoken and revealed
Himself in His word, and in Jesus Christ the Word made flesh. Early in Protes-
tantism certain doctrinal statements were formulated to express what the respective
churches which emerged through the Reformation believed. One of these was
the Augsburg Confession, formulated in 1530 at Augsburg, Germany. Later on
this was somewhat modified under the influence of Melanchthon, and John Calvin
himself subscribed to this altered form of the Augsburg Confession. The Luth-
erans generally accepted this Confession either in its original or altered form.
Martin Luther wrote a brief catechism in which some of these Protestant doctrines
were set forth in the form of question and answer.
In 1563 the Heidelberg Catechism was issued at Heidelberg, Germany. It was
prepared by two young theologians named Olevianus and Ursinus. This, too,
was influenced by John Calvin and Melanchthon. It became the standard of
doctrine for the reformed branch of the Reformation. When in 1817 the Evan-
gelical Union in Prussia under Frederick WilliaJ;II III was formed, which sought to
bring together the Lutheran and Reformed groups, the matter of the doctrinal
standards of the two bodies was not raised. It was presumed that each group
might continue to believe in its own confessions and to use the same catechisms
it had formerly used.
Those who came to America and represented the Reformed Church naturally
held to the doctrines set forth in the Heidelberg Catechism, while those who came
to America at a later date and organized the Evangelical Synod of North America
adhered not only to the Heidelberg Catechism, but also to the Augsburg Confession
and Luther's Catechism, as interpretations of the essential truths of the Bible.
They accepted all of them so far as they agreed, but wherein they differed they
reserved the right to go to the Bible and find the final and ultimate truth.
When the Evangelical and Reformed Church was formed, these three standards
of faith were thus brought Into tho union. Conacquontly, in formulating the
doctrinal statement of the Evangelical and Reformed Church, there were written
into the constitution tliese words:
The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are recognized as the
Word of God and the ultimate rule of Christian faith and practice.
The doctrinal standards of the Evangelical and Reformed Church are the
Heidelberg Catechism, Luther's Catechism, and the Augsburg Confession.
They are accepted as an authoritative interpretation of the essential truth
taught in the Holy Scriptures.
Wherever these doctrinal standards differ, ministers, members, and congre-
gations, in accordance with the liberty of conscience inherent in the Gospel,
are allowed to adhere to the interpretation of one of these confessions.
However, in each case the final norm is the Word of God.
The Evan~~:elical and Reformed Church, therefore, continues as the church of
the Word. On this rock it l1as built its house. And in so doing it is true to its
traditions and to the spirit of Luther, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Calvin, and all of
the reformers.
Like all Protestant churches it accepts the two sacraments of Holy Baptism
and the Lord's Supper and adheres to the rites of confirmation, ordination, con-
secration, marriage, and burial. It allows freedom of worship, but in the interest
of unity and harmony, it prescribes forms of worship and hymns for common use.
ORGAmZATION
The Evangelical and Reformed Church has a presbyterial form of government.
The members elect their representatives, so that each congregation is governed
by a consistory or church council. A "charge" is composed of one or more con-
gregations ca:nstituting a pastorate. A number of contiguous charges form a
Synod. There are 34 such Synods. These Synods, however, are constituted, not
by all the members of the congregations in a given territory, but by their repre-
sentatives, vi-z: The pastor and a delegate from each pastoral charge, preferably
an elder. The Synod has certain distinct duties and functions to perform. It
has jurisdiction over its ministers and congregations; it examines, licenses, and
ordains candidates for the ministry, and performs such other functions as may
be assigned to it. It elects its own officers for the administration of its work,
and meets twice a year-in the spring for legislative purposes and in the fall in
DigitiZed by GoogIe
EVANGELICAL AND REFORMED CHURCH 617
the nature of a workers' conference, at which a larger representation of the
congregation drawn from its organizations are expected to attend. The Synod
appoints numerous committees through whom the work of the church is being
carried forward.
Beyond the Synod comes the General Synod. This body represents the whole
church and consists of delegates chosen by the synods, an equal number of
ministers and lay members, together with certain officials definitely named.
The General Synod is the highest body of the church. It meets regularly
every 2 years and has definite functions reserved to it. It elects its own officers
of which the president, secretary, and treasurer are full-time officers. It elects
a smaller group known as the General Council, consisting of 21 members, to super-
vise and direct the work of the church and to act for the church when the General
Synod is not in session. The General Council functions principally through com-
mittees charged with specific tasks.
The General Synod also elects hoards and commissions and prosecutes its
kingdom work through these and certain auxiliary organizations such as the
Churchmen's Brotherhood and the Women's Guild.
There are eight boards of the church operating in different fields of service,
and four commissions with definite responsibilities, as follows: Board of National
Missions, Board of International Missions, Board of Christian Education and
Publication, Board of Business Management, Board of Pensions and Relief,
Board of Investments, Board of Theological Seminaries, Board of Directors of
Elmhurst College, and such others as may be created by the General Synod; and
Commission on Evangelism, Commission on Christian Social Action, Commission
on Higher Education, and Commission on Benevolent Institutions.
The General Synod, the Synod, and the consistory or church council are called
"judicatories." The boards and other organizations are called "agencies."
These judicatories and agencies have mutual relationships. The jndicatories
create the agencies and use them as instruments to carry the work into effect,
while the agencies in turn use the organizations set up in or b.v the judicatorie~
as avenues through which to work. The whole organization of the church is so
integrated that each particular part does its work in relation to the whole. This
scheme enlists the activity of every individual member in the whole task of the
church.
WORK
To make its contribution to the Christianizing of America is one of its specific
tasks. Apart from what each congregation in its local community is doing in this
Christianizing process, the Evangelical and Reformed Church, through its Board
of National Missions, is working in the frontier sections of the country, among the
less privileged types of population, such as the Ozarkians, the fishermen at Biloxi,
the sojourners in Madaline Island, and such national groups as the Indians, the
Volga Germans, the Hungarians, the Czechs, the Japanese and, in large centers
of population, such as the Caroline Mission in St. Louis, and in rural communities
where conditions require guidance, aid, and readjustment.
In the fields outside the United States and Canada the Evangelical and
Reformed Church, through its Board of International Missions, maintains missions
in India, Japan, China, Honduras, Iraq, and Africa. The work in these distant
lands partakes largely of an evangelistic, educational, industrial, and medical
nature whereby the kingdom of God is to be established among these peoples.
The teaching function of the church includes such activities as are carried for-
ward in the Sunday school, the weekday school of religion, the vacation Bible
school, the catechetical class, the leadership training school, the summer camp,
the adult school of Christian living and the general church-related schools, col-
leges, and theological seminaries. It includes the publication of Christian periodi-
cals, church school hymnals, general Christian education books, and other liter-
ature for the instruction of our people in the work of the church and in the art of
Christian living.
Most of these educational activities are administered by the Board of Christian
Education and Publication, whose administrative headquarters are in Philadelphia
and whose editorial offices are located in St. Louis.
The educational institutions of the church, of which there are 14, operate in the
field of higher education. These institutions consist of three theological seminaries
for the training of men for the ministry, of eight colleges, and three academies.
These institutions are related to each other and to the church through a com-
mission on higher education.

The Boards of Missions, the Board of Christian Education and Publication, the
Women's Guild, and the Churchmen's Brotherhood have formed the Cooperative
Council of Missionary Education which coordinates the educational features in
the field of missions.
Chief among our educational publications carrying news of the church is "The
Messenger" which is the weekly paper for the denomination. There are also
two papers issued in the German language, "Der Friedensbote," published in
St. Louis, and "Die Kirchcnzeitung," published in Cleveland.
Most of the printing of our literature is being done by our two printing establish-
ments, one located in St. Louis, the other in Cleveland.
The Board of Business Management has under its supervision the Schaff
Building in Philadelphia, Eden Publishing House in St. Louis, and Central Pub-
lishing House in Cleveland, all of which places maintain up-to-date book stores
and supply houses where material can be procured for the further instruction of
our people.
The Board of Ministerial Relief and Pensions concerns itself with the relief
of aged ministers and the widows of deceased ministers. Then there are the
numerous benevolent i nstitutions which care for the orphans, the aged, and
the sick.

SlT'S OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
The membership of this denomination consists of persons who are on tht•
register of communicants in each local church, having subscribed to the doctrine
of the church.
Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 2 presents, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of the Evangelical Church for the
census years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906. The figures are not entirely comparable
for the various periods, however, by reason of the division between this church
and the United Evangelical Church and their merger at a subsequent date.

1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as "under 13 yeal'l'l
of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 shows the value of churches and
parsonages and the amount of debt on church edifices for 1936. Table 6 presents,
for 1936, the church expenditures, -showing R
eparately current expenses, improve-
ments, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing the financial statistics of
any individual church, separate presentation in tables 5 and 6 is limited to those
States in which three or more churches reported value and expenditures.

ical Church, the more important statistical data for 1936 shown by States in the

The great religious awakening which took place in the United States at the
close of the eighteenth century was at first largely confined to the English-speak-
ing communities. It was inevitable, however, that others should feel the effect
of the new spirit; and a number of leaders arose, through whose influence varying
types of religious life developed, eventuating in different church organizations.
Among them was Jacob Albright, who was born in Pottstown, Pa., in 1759,
and died in 1808. Bapti7.ed in infancy, and confirmed in the Lutheran com-
munion, he was later converted under the influence of a Reformed minister;
but coming into connection with the Methodists, he declared his adherence
to them and was licensed to exhort. Albright, who had begun to preach in 1796,
felt called upon to devote himself particularly to work among the German people.
It had not been his purpose to found a new church.
It was not until 1803 that an ecclesiastical organization was effected at a
general assembly held in eastern Pennsylvania, when Mr. Albright was set
apart as a minister of the gospel and ordained as an elder.
His training in the Methodist Episcopal Church influenced him in organizing
the new movement, and many characteristic Methodist features, such as the cir-
cuit system and the itinerancy, were adopted. The first field of operations in-
cluded the counties of Bucks, Berks, and Northampton, and extended into por-
tions of Northumberland and Centre counties. The first annual conference was
held in Lebanon County, Pa., in November 1807. Albright was elected bishop,
• This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. J. Raphael Dallas, general statistician of the Evangelical Church,
Cleveland, Ohio, and approved by him in Its present form.

and articles of faith and the book of discipline were adopted, but a full form of
church government was not devised for some years. The first general conference
convened in Buffalo Va.lley, Union County, Pa., in October 1816, at which time
the denomination took the name Evamrelical Association.
Although, in the beginning, the activities of the church were carried on in the
German language only, the scope was soon widened by taking up work in the
English language also; and of late years English has become the dominant lan-
guage, practically displacing the German. The denomination spread into the
Central States, and throughout the Northern and Western States from New
England to the Pacific coast, and north into Canada.
For some years the missionary idea, which has always been a dominant purpose
of the denomination, found its expression in local work; but in 1839 a general
missionary society was organized, and a woman's society followed in 1883. In
1854 the church first reached out to Europe, and commenced an important work
both in Germany and Switzerland. In 1876 Japan was occupied, and since then
missions have been established in China, Russia, Poland-Latvia, and Africa. As
early as 1815, a church publishing house was founded, and what is said to be the
oldest German religious paper in the United States, Der Christliche Botschafter,
was founded in 1836.
A division, in 1891, resulting in the organization of the United Evangelical
Church, took from the denomination a lar~~:e number of ministers and members.
Both denominations continued their separate existence until the end of the
second decade of the separation when the growing conviction that the two
churches should be reunited began to find articulate expression. The General
Conference of the Evangelical Association of 1907 and that of the United Evan-
gelical Church in 1910 took definite steps toward a reapproachment by the
appointment of commissions on church union and federation. These commis-
sions, after a series of meetings, agreed upon a partial basis of union in 1918,
which basis was ratified by the General Conference of the United Evangelical
Church in 1918 and by the General Conference of the Evangelical Association in
1919.
Commissions were again appointed which, in joint session in 1921, completed
the basis of union; it was submitted to the annual conferences of both denomina-
tions, receiving the required constitutional majority in both churches. At a
special session of the General Conference of the Evangelical Association, and at
a regular session of the General Conference of the United Evangelical Church,
meeting simultaneously during the month of October 1922, the adoption of the
Discipline and the Basis of Union was consummated, and on October 14, 1922, in
the General Conference of the Evangelical Church, the two churches were united
under the name of the Evangelical Church. This church is not one of the
Lutheran bodies.
DOCTRINE
In doctrine the Evangelical Church is Arminian, and its articles of faith corre-
spond very closely to those of the Methodist Episcopal Church. They emphasize
the divinity as well as perfect humanity of the Son of God and the true divinity
of the Holy Ghost; and hold that the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments reveal the will of God so far as is necessary for salvation. Christian
perfection is defined as "a state of grace in which we are so firmly rooted in God
that we have instant victory over every temptation the moment it presents
itself, without yielding in any degree; in which our rest, peace, and joy in God
are not interrupted by the vicissitudes of life; in which, in short, sin has lost its
power over us, and we rule over the flesh, the world, and Satan, yet in watchful-
ness." Entire sanctification is the basis of this perfection, which, however, con-
stantly admits of a fuller participation in divine power and a constant expansion
in spiritual capacity.
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the Evangelical Church is connectional in form. Bishops are
elected by the General Conference for a term of 4 years, but are not ordained
or consecrated as such. They are eligible for reelection and are general overseers
of the work of the church. They preside at annual conferences and, as a board,
decide all questions of law in the interval between General Conference sessions.
The General Conference, which meets quadrennially, has been, since 1839, a
delegated body. Previous to that time all elders of the church were members.
The annual and quarterly conferences correspond to the similar bodie!l in the
Methodist Episcopal Church; the annual conferences consisting of the ministers
275318--41----41
?'T'irrrl h:: Goog'e
628 CENSJUSI OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
within certain territorial bounds and a limited number of laymen; and the
quarterly conferences consisting of the officers of the local congregations. Dis-
trict superintendents are elected for 4 years by the annual conference. Pastors
are appointed annually, on the itinerant system. No time limit is imposed.
The property of local congregations is controlled and managed by trustees for the
use of the ministry and membership, and subject to the doctrine and polity of the
denomination.
WORK
The general missionary work both home and foreign is under the care of a
missionary society, whose members become such by the payment of dues. It
carries on its work through a board, whose membership consists of the officers of
the society (who are also the officers of the board); one ministerial delegate from
each annual conference society; two delegates from the Woman's Missionary
Society, the missionary executive secretaries; and eight laymen who are elected
by the General Conference. The annual conferences are practically organized
as branch societies for missionary work. All transactions of the missionary
society are reviewed at the General Conference. The Woman's Missionary
Society has 1,216 local societies, with a total membership of 33,606, and works
under the general direction of the Board of Missions. This general board makes
the annual appropriations for mission conferences in the United States and
foreign lands, and these conferences in turn divide their respective appropriations
among the various mission stations. In 1911 the missionary activities of the church
were enlarged and a Young People's Missionary Circle was organized. It now
has 624 societies with a membership of 15,522.
Appropriations for home mission work are directed to the support of the
missionaries and the Rrovision of homes for them. A considerable amount of
work is done in the West and Northwest, including the western provinces of
Canada-Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta-and in the large cities of the
United States. Of late, work has developed among the foreign nationalit.ies in
the United States, there being now 4 missions among Italians. The total number
of missionaries reported in the home department in 1936 was 607, the number of
churches aided was 957, and the contributions for the work were reported as
$494,400.
In close sympathy with the Board of Home Missions is the work of the Board
of Church Extension in assisting needy mission congregations to erect church
buildings by means of temporary loans at a minimum rate of interest. For this
work, in 1936, there was contributed $22,000. There is a general fund amounting
to $496,923, and a special fund of $ll,043, making a total of $507,966.
Foreign missions are carried on through both the Board of Missions and the
Woman's Missionary Society. The fields occupied are Japan, China, Germany,
Poland, Latvia, France, Africa, Switzerland, and Russia. The most distinc-
tively foreign mission work is that in China and Japan, in each of which there
is a principal station, with various substations and churches connected with it.
In 1936, in connection with the missions in these countries, there were reported
541 organized congregations, with 38,200 members; and 2 training schools. In
addition, there were in Europe, generally under the care of native preachers, 424
churches, with 33,453 members; and in Canada, 111 churches, with 11,310 mem-
bers. The total number of American missionaries employed was 40, chiefly in
Asia, and there were 725 natiYe workers, including deaconesses, most of them in
Europe. In the foreign field there were also 7 hospitals and dispensaries, and
1 orphanage, with 45 inmates. The total amount contributed for foreign missions
by the churches in 1936 was $129,925, of which $35,050 went to assist the work
in Europe, $50,000 that in Japan, $32,000 that in China, and $12,875 that in
Africa. The contributions for the work in Canada are special and are not in-
cluded in the regular contributions. The property in Europe is valued at $2,630,-
500, that in Japan at $427,253, and that in China at $98,091, making a total of
$3,155,844. The general receipts of the missionary society for both the home
and foreign fields have shown a steady increase, and in 1936 amounted to '5696,925.
The average contribution in the whole denomination in 1936 for home and foreign
missionary purposes was $2.93 per member.
The educational work of the denomination in the United States in 1936 in-
cluded 5 institutions of higher grade, with 1,562 students. The current income
for educational work at home was $482,700; great emphasis was placed upon
raising a fund for endowments, which were materially increased. The value of
property is estimated at $3,496,000, and there is an endowment of $1,758,911.

EVANGELICAL CHURCH 629
The institutional or philanthropic enterprises of the church include two orphan-
ages, six homes for the aged, and three hospitals, with a deaconess home.
Aside from these institutions there is a charitable society, whose funds are in
the form of a permanent endowment, the. proceeds from which are applied to
the supP.ort of aged ministers, or such as are in broken healt~ and to the support
of families of deceased ministers. This is designated "The Superannuation
Fund."
The young people of the church are enrolled in what is known as the Evangelical
League of Christian Endeavor, which has in the United States 1,825 societies,
with 43,521 members. These societies contributed $52,818, of which $12,279
was appropriated for missionary work and the remainder for various other pur-
poses.

634 CENSJUSI OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION:
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The United Evangelical Church, as a separate ecclesiastical body, dates from
the year 1894. Previous to that time its members constituted a part of the
Evangelical Association, organized under the evangelistic labors of Jacob Albright,
in eastern Pennsylvania, in the year 1800. The division which resulted in the
formation of the new church was due to differences of opinion as to what were
considered fundamental principles of church polity, and official acts affecting
the claims of a large minority of the ministers and members of the association.
Seven annual conferences, with from 60,000 to 70,000 members, who were des-
ignated the "minority," entered a protest against what they regarded as "abuse
of the powers conferred by the discipline, and usurpation of powers in violation
of the discipline." This protest availed nothing, and in due time a separate
organization was effected, with articles of faith and a discipline in strict accord
with the doctrine, spirit, and purpose of the original church. On October 10,
1894, the former members of the East Pennsylvania Conference met in convention
and organized as the "East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Evangelical
Church," and called a general conference to meet in Naperville, Ill., November 29,
1894. Other conferences joined in the call, and on the designated day the con-
ference met, and on the following day dedared itself to be the first General
Conference of the United Evangelical Church.
In 1910 a movement wa~~ started looking toward a reunion of the United
Evangelical Church and the Evangelical Association. Commissions were ap-
pointed by the general conferences in 1914 to consider the question and prepare
a basis of union. For a number of years the matter lay dormant, but in 1922
the majority of the delegates to the General Conference held in Barrington, Ill.,
voted to reunite on the basis proposed by the commission.
The East Pennsylvania Conference, long recognized as the mother conference,
at its annual session prior to the session of the General Conference, refused to
vote on the basis of union, giving nine reasons for its action, which briefly stated
were: That the method of procedure was irregular and contrary to the law of the
church; that it meant a return to a church polity which had been objectionable
30 years before and had been one of the principal reasons for the establishment
of the United Evangelical Church; that it meant the omission of a number of
articles of faith which were deemed of vital importance and concerning which the
discipline explicitly stated "The Articles of Faith shall never be changed."
This conference also instructed its delegates to the General Conference to enter
a protest in harmony with the foregoing action. This protest was, however,
disregarded and the merger declared effected.
The protesting delegates, upon their return from the General Conference,
called a special session of the East Pennsylvania Conference and presented their
report. This body endorsed the action of their representatives and decided to
perpetuate the United Evangelical Church. Since that date the large majority
of churches in this conference, together with individual churches in the Central,
Pittsburgh, Ohio, and Illinois conferences, have been functioning apart from the
merger, with marked success. Though the supreme court of the State of Penn-
sylvania declared the merger to be legal, its decision did not define exactly the
status of these churches; but, pending such interpretation, and under an agree-
ment with the larger body, they continued their separate existence under the
same name. They later adopted the name Evangelical Congregational Church.
The boundaries of the East Pennsylvania Conference remain the same as before
the merger, while the churches in the Middle West have been organized into a
Western Conference.
The valuation of the property owned by the congregations reporting in 1936
is $3,652,777, to which must be added the value of general property, making a
total valuation of $3,773,177.
The ministerial ranks are composed of 124 itinerant preachers serving charges
and 46 local preachers.
The Evangelical Congregational Church is a constituent member of the Federal
Council of the Churches of Christ in America, and is identified with the various
movements for church unity and fellowship.
t This statement, which is sub, tantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Reli-
gious Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. C. H. Mengel, bishop of the Evangelical Congregational
Church, Allentown, Pa., and approved by him in Its present form.

EVANGELICAL CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH 635
DOCTRINE
In doctrine the Evangelical Congregational Church may be characterized as
Arminian. Its confession of faith, formulated in 25 articles, varies but little
from the teachings of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The church emphasizes
the principle of voluntary giving, not only for the support of the ministry, but
also for the maintenance of all the religious and benevolent enterprises of the
church; "voluntary abstinence from all intoxicants, as the true ground of per-
sonal temperance, and complete legal prohibition of the traffic in alcoholic drinks,
as the duty of civil government"; the exercise of strict discipline for the safety,
purity, and power of the church; the integrity of the Bible, as given by inspiration
of God; and the fellowship of all followers of Christ.
ORGANIZATION
In polity the church resembles the Methodist Episcopal Church. The local
congregations are self-governing in their temporal affairs. There is equal clerical
'lnd lay representation in the annual conferences, as well as in the General Con-
ference. The itinerant system of ministerial supply and service prevails, the
appointments of ministers being made at each annual conference, by a committee
eonsisting of a presiding bishop and presiding elders, for 1 year, with the privilege
of reappointment to the limit of an 8-year term.
WORK
The missionary interests of the church are committed especially to a Society
of Home and Foreign Missions, which has a branch in each annual conference.
Its affairs are managed by a general board, consisting of its officers, together
with one delegate from each conference auxiliary, and one from the Woman's
Home and Foreign Missionary Society. The latter is auxiliary to the general
society. The annual conferences are empowered to establish missions within their
own bounds, and supervise them, while beyond the limits of conference districts
the board of missions can act. The number of such missions now in operation
within and beyond the conference bounds is 62, cared for by the same number of
missionaries; and for the prosecution of the work in 1936, the sum of $29,064 was
contributed.
Foreign missionary work is carried on through interdenominational boards.
The Woman's Home and Foreign Missionary Society is especially active and it is
largely through its efforts that 21 missionaries are being supported in several
foreign countries.
The Keystone League of Christian Endeavor Societies in 1936 numbered 201
with a membership of 6,143 and contributed $1,121 for missionary purposes,
while the Sunday schools contributed for various purposes the sum of $44,954.
A home for the aged has been established at Herndon, Pa., with a property
valuation of $100,000, which includes a farm of 110 acres. Three fine parks are
owned by the church-namely, Waldheim Park, located near Allentown, Pa.;
Rosedale Park, near Reading; and Herndon Park, adjoining the property of the
Home for the Aged, at Herndon, Pa. Successful summer assemblies are con-
ducted in all of these parks.
A publishing company has been organized with headquarters at Myerstown, Pa.
The official church publication is called The United Evangelical. A church center
has been established at Myerstown, Pa.

EVANGELISTIC ASSOCIATIONS
GENERAL STATEMENT
Under this head are included various associations of churches which are more
or less completely organized and have one general characteristic, namely, the
conduct of evangelistic or missionary work.
In a few cases they are practically denominations, but for the most part, while
distinct from other religious bodies, they are dominated by the evangelistic
conception rather than by doctrinal or ecclesiastical distinctions. None of them
is large, and some are very small and local in their character.
Between 1916 and 1926 certain changes were noted: The Church of God (Apos-
tolic) was added; the Lumber River Mission, now known as the Holiness Method-
ist Church, was listed with the Methodist bodies; the Church Transcendent, and
the Voluntary Missionary Society in America ceased to exist; no report was re-
ceived from the Peniel Missions; and two bodies were listed under new names-
Apostolic Faith Mission, reported in 1916 and 1906 as Apostolic Faith Movement,
and Missionary Bands of the World, formerly reported as Pentecost Bands of the
World.
In 1936 the Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarean) has been added to the
group.
The bodies grouped under the head "Evangelistic Associations" in 1936, 1926,
1916, and 1906 are listed as follows, with the principal statistics as reported for the
four census years.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The Apostolic Christian Church traces its origin to Benedict Weyeneth, who
came to this country about the year 1847 and established a number of German-
Swiss churches. The principal characteristic of these churches is the develop-
ment of .the doctrine of entire sanctification. They aim solely at the saving of
souls, a change of heart through regeneration, and a life of godliness guided and
directed by the Holy Spirit.
This body does not believe in war, therefore the members sought exemption
from bearing arms, but they are very willing to support the Government of the
United States in any service which is compatible with the teachings of Christ and
the Apostles. This was demonstrated by the members in the World War, in
which they were commended for their faithfulness. Each member is required to be
obedient to the laws of the United States and honest in discharging his duties,
such as reporting all taxable property, paying taxes, etc.
The di1ferent organizations are distinct from each other, although combining
in a loose association, and they are considering the advisability of a more definite
organization.
I This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Rev. Emest Ora!, Sr., Akron. Ohio, and approved by him In Its present
form.

only.
The membership of this denomination consists of persons who have become
converted to Christ and are baptized and who strive for sanctification and prep-
aration for eternal life.
The Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarean) was not reported prior to 1936,
hence no comparative data are available.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION '
HISTORY
Samuel Heinrich Froehlich was born on July 4, 1803, in Brugg Switzerland.
From his youth, he was influenced by his parents to devote himself to the clergy
of the Protestant Reformed (State Church) so that he never contemplated any-
thing else and was educated accordingly.
The further he advanced in his study, the more his faith vanished until he came
to the point that he believed nothing at all. Then God had compassion on him
and awakened him and led him through a well-grounded conversion to true or
real faith.
From that moment on, however, he met nothing but opposition everywhere
in the church (the state or established church) . When he took his first examina-
tion for acceptance into the ministry in the year 1826, because of his testimony of
the truth, he was put back a year. Finally he was accepted as a clergyman and
after an initial and temporary installation he returned as a clergyman to his home
scenes.
He preached repentance and conversion in a convincing manner. A great
awakening took place in the entire church. (As above, by "church" the state
church of that place is meant.) One poor sinner-heart after another laid itself
at the feet of Jesus. From other localities, too, many came to hear his sermons.
When the enemy saw what blessed-making awakenings were taking place, he
would no longer look on. One storm broke after another over the faithful witness
of Christ until, in October 1830, he was deprived (for nonconformity) as a clergy-
man in the Protestant Reformed (State Church) because he ventured to preach
against rational religion and proclaimed the Gospel of reconciliation in its original
purity.
But much as the opposition was stirred, it was yet not possible to repel the
light that had appeared. The good seed had been sown and had brought forth its
fruits. Seeking souls inquiring after God flocked around S. H. Froehlich and
here and there flourishing assemblies originated in Switzerland.
Still the opposition asserted itself more and more. Persecutions intensified
until S. H. Froehlich was forced to leave Switzerland in the year of 1844. In
response to a call from seeking souls he emigrated to Strassburg, in Alsace. From
here, the word was spread out into all of Alsace and Germany and churches were
begun here and there. ·
In the summer of 1839, two Hungarian youths, Emerich Henkschei and his
brother, came to Zurich in their travels and became acquainted with S. H.
Froehlich. They were converted and baptized and when they returned to their
native land they also preached the Gospel. This was the beginning of the many
congregations in Hungary, Austria, and the territory comprising the present
Jugoslavia and Roumania. Congregations began to appear in Germany also,
and to some extent in France.
1 This statement was furnished by Elder Frederick ScWJer, Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarean),
Mansfield, Ohio.
DigitiZed by GoogIe
APOSTOLIC CHRIS'I'IAN CHURCH ( NAZAREAN) 645
Severe persecutions oppressed many of the members and under this oppression
many believers emigrated to America. In this wise, congregations spread to the
new continent.
It has been estimated that there are about 35,000 adherents to this faith in
Hungary and somewhat more than 35,000 additional members in Jugoslavia and
Roumania. Besides these 70,000 there are several thousand more in Switzerland
and many hundred additional members scattered in Germany and France.
DOCTRINE
"Nazarean" is defined in Funk and Wagnall's dictionary as, "3 Eccl., one of
a Hungarian Sect of Christians having no priesthood, rejecting infant baptism
and transubstantiation, refraining from military service and politics, and refusing
to bind themselves by oath." This concise statement is correct as far as it goes.
The teaching further consists in this: That a man must be converted to Christ and
become reborn to a lively hope of eternal lif~ that such a believer be baptized
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; that he covenant with
God to live a life sanctified in Him and according to the Word of God to seek to
become rich in good works; that he live according to the Gospel of Christ, subfect
to the authorities, strive to be at peace with his fellow men, and fulfil his obliga-
tions as a good citizen. According to the Word of God believers refrain from
taking up arms for the purpose of shedding blood, since the Bible commands,
"Love your enemies"; likewise the oath cannot be given-but "Let your yea be
yea and your nay be nay."
The organization consists of members of the church who have become converted
to Christ and baptized and who strive for sanctification and preparation for eternal
life; and also of such friends of the truth who sincerely and earnestly strive to
attain such adoption to sonship in Christ.
The principle has been recognized since time immemorable that there is a
transitory degree or class existing between those who are yet in total darkness
and those who are in union with God through Jesus Christ. The disciples of
Christ themselves were for a time being of this class, and it was present and
existing in the ancient Church of Christ going under the name of "Catechumens."
This very same class is present and existing in our organization and is known
under the name of "Friends" or "Friends of Truth." Such members of the
organization, although they have not yet received baptism or communion and
are not yet greeted with the holy kiss, meanwhile freely enjoy other valued privi-
leges and the fellowship with all the members.
In times of persecution, hatred and suffering fell upon this transitory class
with equal fury, and in compensation they were also partakers of the benedictions
and blessings which emanated from the light and truth as taught by the ministers
of the church. Even in our day that law of compensation should and does hold
good, that in the eyes of the law as well as in the eyes of the people in general,
those belonging to this transitory class are and should be as they alwafS have
been regarded as being classed and associated with those who are in umon and
fellowship with God, rather than with those who are outside of the bounds and
influence of the church.
Those members of the organization who are yet within the transitocy class
(Friends of the Truth) do share and hold with equal conscientious conviction,
along with the more advanced class of members, the doctrine founded upon the
teal'hing of Christ, that it is sinful to shed human blood.
It is made a fundamental duty of every member of the church to be subject to
principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to do evecy good work,
to speak evil of no man, to be no brawler and show all meekness to all men.
The members are not actuated in their attitude by the spirit of cowardice or
unwillingness to bring sacrifice for the good, and are willing to observe the com-
mand of the government to do noncombatant service, but their conscience does
not permit them to render obedience to the command to kill.
Members do not claim or insist upon exemption from all service in time of
war but only from such service as cannot properly be classed as noncombatant.
ORGANIZATION
Each church is served by elders who are authorized to baptize, lay on hands,
give the Lord's Supper, and conduct meetings of members for exercising church
discipline in accordance with the teachings laid down by Christ and the Apostles.

State tables.-Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the statistics for the Apostolic Faith
Mission by States. Table 3 gives for each State for 1936 the number and mem-
bership of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural
territory, membership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools. Table 4
·gives for selected States the number and membership of the churches for the four
census years 1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as
"under 13 years of age" and "13 years of age and over." Table 5 presents, for
1936, the church expenditures, showing separately current expenses, improve-
ments, benevolences, etc. Separate presentation in table 5 Is limited to those
States in which three or more churches reported expenditures, in order to avoid
disclosing the financial statistics of any individual church, and for the same
reason no tabular statement can be shown for the value of church edifices or the
debt on such property since no State reported the value of so many as three
churches.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
This movement origiuated in 1900, in the revival work of some evangelists.
It stands for the "restoration of the faith once delivered to the saints, the old-
time religion, camp meetings, revivals, missions, street and prison work, and
Christian Unity everywhere." It is not a denomination, in the sense in which
that word is ordinarily used, but "an evangelistic movement on a Scriptural
plan," carried on by preachers evangelists, and special workers, who feel that
they are called by God, and who devote their whole time to the work, without
salaries or collections of any kind the entire expense depending "upon God's
blessing through freewill offerings.'/ Special attention is paid to "salvation and
healing." Wlienever possible, the leaders upon request visit and pray for the
sick without charge. The distant sick are treated through correspondence, the
sending of handkerchiefs that have been blessed, etc. There are headquarters in
Portland, Oreg., and in Minneapolis, Minn. The membership reported indicates
merely those persons who are permanently and actively identified with the move-
ment, not including those who attend the meetings, or who In&Y be classed as
associated with it.
WORK
Foreign missionary work is carried on in Japan, China, Korea, the Philippines,
India, Mrica, South America, and some of the European countries, under the
general supervision of committees which have charge of the receipt of funds and
the forwarding of supplies to those in the field, no definite salaries being J)aid.
It has extended rapidly_in Finland and Gerinany, where before the World War
there were conventions attended by as many as 2,000 persons. There are, also,
many adherents in South Mrica.
1 This statement, which Is snhstantlally the same as that published In vol nor the Report on Religloas
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Miss M. Hanson and Mrs. M. White, pastors In charge, Minneapolis,
Minn-. and approved by them In Its present form.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
The Church of Daniel's Band was organized and incorporated in February
1893 at Marine City, St. Clair County, Mich. The general purpose is evangel-
istic, with special emphasis upon fellowship, abstinence from all excess, and liberty
in the exercise of faith. The organization is somewhat after the Methodist
form. In addition to the churches in the United States there is a mission con-
nected with the body in Canada. In their Sunday school work most of the
churches unite with other bodies in union schools.
1 No revision of history, doctrine. or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, hence this
statement Is the same gg that published In Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926.

The Church of God (Apostolic) was organized at Danville, Ky., in 1897,
~y Elder Thomas J. Cox. At that time it was called the Christian Faith Band
Church, under which name it was later incorporated (1901). At the General
Assembly held at Freeman, W. Va., August 15, 1915, the general overseer held a
council with the elders concerning the name. The desire was expressed for a
more Scriptural name, and the report of the council recommending that the name
of the church be changed to "The Church of God (Apostolic)" was adopted by
a more than two-thirds vote of the assembly; the latter, however, seeing that a
number desired to hold the old name, did not press the matter, and the church
was not incorporated under the new name until 1919, at Paris, Ky.
DOCTRINE
Admission to the church depends upon repentance for sin, confession of faith,
and baptism by immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The members
believe in holiness and sanctification, practice the washing of feet, and celebrate
the communion, or Lord's Supper, with unfermented grape juice and unleavened
bread.
ORGANIZATION
The governing body is the General Assembly, and the officers are the apostle,
or general overseer, the assistant overseer, district elders, pastors, evangelists,
and local preachers. The church field is divided into districts, each of which
holds a ministerial council once a year. The various churches have local names,
the headquarters church being known as 7.ion Hill Church of God (Apostolic) .
I No revision of history, doctrine, or organization was furnished by this body for 1936, henee this state-
ment Is the same as that published in Religious Bodies, vol. II, 1926. No data are available for "Work"
in 1936.

----------
In 1886 a circuit preacher, Rev. P. J. Kaufman, belonging to the Mennonite
Brethren in Christ, with some other members, became impressed with the eccle-
siasticism of different denominations and the lack of Bible authority for their
organization. They accordingly withdrew and associated themselves together
in what became afterwards the "Church of God as Organized by Christ," the
principal basis of which is the belief that membership in the church is not de-
pendent u"pon human choice, but that all Christians, of any and all sects, who
are true to all the gospel light they have, and lead honest, true, and Christian
lives, have equal rights with all in the services and are members of His church.
They hold to the oneness of God's people, and that it is this Spirit birth that
constitutes membership in the true church. Hence, there is no joining of the
church among them, nor is there definite ordination to the service of the church,
inasmuch as Christ ordains all officials. Christ ordains all officials of the church,
but the ministry may be licensed and ordained, if they so desire, for public recogni-
tion. Things that cannot be explained or proved with the words of Christ are set
aside with the belief that every man "should be fully persuaded in his own mind."
They teach repentance and restitution so far as restitution is possible; nonre-
sistance, and full obedience to Christ's commands; observe the sacraments of
baptism and the communion, and foot washing, but have no binding form for their
observance.
They believe strictly in the American school, are opposed to all church schools
and church colleges, holding that the State should control all secular education.
Missionary labor for the organization is confined to those near at hand, although
individual members contribute liberally to foreign missions of other organizations.
Christ being the head of the church no one place can be named as the head-
quarters of the church, although the "Gospel Teacher" is accepted as the official
organ.
I This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, bas been revised by Rev. J. J _ Kaufman, Church of God as Organized by Christ,
Nappanee, Ind., and approved by him in its present form.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
A number of independent churches were organized under the name of Hephzi-
bah Faith MiBBionary Association, at Glenwood, Iowa, in 1892, for the threefold
purpose of preaching the doctrine of holiness, developing missionary work both
at home and abroad, and promoting philanthropic work, especially the care of
orphans and needy persons. They have no formal creed and no general church
organization ; each local body, called an assembly, keeps its own records; but
there is a central committee, located at Tabor, Iowa, which superintends the
general activities of the churches.
A communicant is considered to be one who gives evidence of a new birth, who
is willing to conform to the teaching of the Scriptures, walking in love and fellow-
ship, amenable to the church and to those who have its spiritual oversight or rule.
Those who reside in isolated communities may, if they wish, retain their church
affiliation.
Ministers usually receive no salaries, most of them being supported by freewill
offerings.
WORK
The number of persons engaged in home missionary work is 100, including or-
dained and licensed ministers, evangelists, deaconesses, etc. No salaries are
paid. Complete figures for this work are not available, but the superintendent
reports that "sufficient food and clothing and traveling expenses for about 100
persons were supplied during the year." The denomination supports 2 schools
with 200 students, for which $8.000 was contributed during the year. The value
of property is $100,000.
Foreign missionary work has been carried on since 1894. The fields occupied
at present are Japan, India, Africa, and China. In 1936 there were 15 stations
and outposts, with 9 missionaries and 31 native helpers. There were 25 organized
churches and Sunday schools in the foreign field but no membership figures are
available. The amount contributed in the United States for work in the foreign
field was $7,749 and the value of property was estimated at $20,000. The amount
of endowment for institutions of all kinds is $10,000.
1 This statement, which is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Josle M. Fattig, assistant secretary of the Hephzibah Faith Missionary
Association, Tabor, Iowa, and approved by her In Its present form.

METROPOLITAN CHURCH ASSOCIATION
STATISTICS
The data given for 1936 represent 14 active organizations of the Metropolitan
Church Association, all reported as being in urban territory. These statistics
were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of
the individual churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of the congregations of this denomination are those persons
who, having made profession of conversion, or new birth, have subscribed to the
doctrine of the church and continue to live a Christian life.
Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 1 presents, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of the Metropolitan Church Asso-
ciation for the census years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
This organization, sometimes called the "Burning Bush," is an outgrowth of
the Metropolitan Methodist Church, of Chicago, Ill., and was organized in one
of the most densely settled districts of that city. It found its impulse in a
revival movement in 1894 and has increased until it now has churches in various
parts of the country. It also conducts fairly extensive foreign missionary
work. The headquarters of the organization are at Waukesha, Wis.
I This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by Mr. Charles L. Capsel, secretary, Metropolitan Church Association,
Waukesha, Wis., and approved by him in its present form.

METROPOLITAN CHURCH ASSOCIATION 667
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
In doctrine and practice the Metropolitan Church Association resembles the
early Methodists. Its one aim has always been to give the gospel free to the
poor, indeed to all; and especially to give to the helpless and outcast another
chance for a life of usefulness.
It does not emphasize a creed, except such as may be found in the Scriptures
themselves. It published a discipline setting forth articles of faith that are
purely evangelical in nature and simple enough for a child to comprehend.
In 1918 a charter was secured in the State of Wisconsin, and an organization
was perfected among the ordained preachers working under the denomination.
A set of bylaws was adopted, providing for government through a board of
trustees and an auxiliary board of stewards. The establishment of new classes
and churches was also provided for, which are recognized as branches and pre-
sided over by ministers appointed by the board of trustees.
The association is conducted as a faith organization, and no one connected
with it receives any salary or regular payment of any kind for work done. It
has a number of ordained ministers, who do not receive regular salaries, nor do
they solicit gifts in any way. Individual members make it a rule of life not to
hold any property which can be sold and the proceeds applied to the advance-
ment of the kingdom of Christ. The Scripture text, "Sell that thou hast, and
distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven," is thus made
a literal rule of practice throughout the organization. The practice of sharing
temporal benefits equally is also a rule in the association. All money received,
from whatever source, is turned into the treasury and distributed for the gen-
eral advancement of the association work. In the conduct of the schools and
institutions no charge is made for board or tuition, but all are expected to con-
tribute their work for the general welfare.
WORK
The special feature of the association is its evangelistic work, which is carried
on in all parts of the country. A party of from one to five persons may go to
some point where evangelistic services are desired and carry on this work, without
charge, in a tent or hall hired for the purpose, continuing as long as the interest
warrants, and may organize a local class and leave a pastor in charge.
Since the last census (1926) the work of this church has gone forward in foreign
lands. Several departments have been added to the India branch, located at
Siwait near Allahabad. The Bitzer Memorial School has been opened to give
elementary education to native children. A new hospital has been erected, as
well as a new Bible school building. A monthly paper is published, called
India. A favorable opening in South India is being followed; property has
been purchased with the intention of organizing a permanent work there.
Evangelistic work is being carried on in Norway and Sweden. In each country
the church prints a quarterly periodical, which aids in religious instruction.
In Glasgow, Scotland, which serves as headquarters for the British Isles,
property has been purchased. A Bible training school is conducted there to fit
workers to labor in the British Em_pire as well as the foreign field. A printing
plant is operated which publishes Christian literature. A monthly magazine is
printed, known as the Message of Victory.
Extensive work is carried on in the Union of South Africa. Tae headquarters
are located in Capetown. The Metropolitan Training Institute has been
opened to give religious training to those who feel called to labor for God in
Africa. A quarterly paper is published, called The Africa Burning Bush. Con-
nected with this branch is a mission at Cape Coast Castle in West Africa, which
is operated by native workers.
In 1933 evangelistic work was started in the interior of Brazil. This is only
pioneer work; no permanent buildings have been erected.
The association conducts a large Bible school and training home for Christian
workers at Waukesha, Wis. It operates at the same place an extensive pub-
lishing plant where the official organ, The Burning Bush, and also the Gospel
Art Calendar, Scripture Text Mottoes, and numerous books, leaflets, and tracts
are published.
It conducts an orphans' home at Waukesha, in which there are about 35 chil-
dren, and these are educated at the private school of the association.

The Missionary Church Association is a group of cooperating evangelical
churches, which have a common faith and which are banded together to work
more effectively toward common ends. The association was organized in 1898
and was incorporated in the State of Indiana in the year 1905.
This society had its origin in the convictions of certain men and women of
God who felt the need of giving united testimony to the faith and experiences
I This statement, which is substantlsll_x the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bod!~ I926, bas been revised by Rev. o. F. Lelgbtner, secretary or the Mi'!!<lonary Church Association,
Fort wayne, Ind., and approved by him In its present form.

that were dear to them. These Christian believers stressed the baptism with the
Holy Spirit as a definite crisis experience subsequent to conversion and the truth
of the imminent return of our Lord Jesus Christ, in addition to the accepted fun~
damentals of the faith in that day. Accordingly, an association of churches was
formed to give better opportunities for cultivating the deeper spiritual life, to
give a bold testimony to the faith "once delivered to the saints," and to engage
in more aggressive missionary work. The position of the founders on the essen-
tial articles of faith and practice are accepted as being in substantial agreement
with the Word of God, which is the final authority in all matters pertaining to
the life and faith of the church. The Missionary Church Association is com~
mitted to the fundamental position that in the Acts and the Epistles of the New
Testament is given a pattern of the message to be preached; the principles of
administration; the methods of evangelization; and the basic form of church
government, that are to be followed by every successive generation of the church
until Jesus Christ comes again.
Its present headquarters are at Fort Wayne, Ind.
DOCTRINE
The association stands for all the great evangelical truths of Christianity, such
as the Divine and plenary inspiration of the Scriptures; the Deity and virgin
birth of Jesus Christ; His substitutionary death and physical resurrection; the
total depravity of man by nature and his need of regeneration as a personal
experience; the enduement of the Holy Spirit subsequent to the new birth to
empower the believer for life and service; divine healing for the body as provided
in the atonement; the personal, premillennial return of Christ and His reign on
the earth; and the future resurrection of the body unto the immortality of the
just and unto the endless punishment of the unjust. It urges upon its members
the importance of being law-abiding citizens; but it is nonresistant in its belief,
having always been opposed to the taking up of arms in war.
ORGANIZATION
The government of the Missionary churches is chiefly congregational; however,
the general conference of the churches, made up of all the ministers, missionaries,
and appointed delegates, is recognized as final authority.
The general conference annually appoints a committee consisting of a president,
vice president, secretary, assistant secretary, and treasurer, together with five
additional members. This body examines candidates for the ministry and issues
licenses to preach, acts as the committee on finance, and has charge of the general
work of the association.
Each church elects its own pastor, deacons, and deaconesses. These, together
with the secretary and treasurer, usually constitute the church board which has
charge of the general affairs of the church. New members are admitted by the
vote of the church after the candidates have been examined and recommended by
the board. Baptism is administered by immersion. Open communion is observed
by all the churches.
WORK
As the name implies, the organization is misAionary in character. While efforts
are put forth in the home field to preach the Gospel in needy and neglected
sections, the great aim is to help evangelize the heathen. Missionaries, number~
ing 60, have been sent to India, China, Africa, South America, and Hawaii.
Those who are now on the field are laboring under various mission boards, but
most of them under The Christian and Missionary Alliance. Ten new candidates
have been accepted for service in the foreign field. The missionary offering for
1936 amounted to, approximately, $25,000.
The Fort Wayne Bible Institute, Fort Wayne, Ind., is owned by this association.
However, it is operated on interdenominational lines, having representatives of
various religious bodies on the school board and faculty. The purpose of the
institution is to prepare missionaries, pastors, evangelists, teachers, singers, etc.,
for Christian service. The school has an enrollment of about 155 students. The
property is valued at, approximately, $200,000 and is practically free from in~
debtedness.

of the World by States. Table 3 gives for each State for 1936 the number and
membership of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural
territory, membership classified by sex, and data for Sunday schools. Table 4
gives for selected States the number and membership of the churches for the four
census years 1906 to 1936, together with the membership for 1936 classified as
"under 13 years of age" and "13 years of age and over." Separate presentation,

• Separate presentation was limited to States having 3 or more churches in 1926, 1016, and 1006.
The Bureau of the Census has been informed that a Church of God (Holiness),
with headquarters at Fort Scott, Kans., merged with the Missionary Bands of
the World in 1933, for the purpose of furthering the general interests and foreign
and home missionary activities.
The data for this denomination, which were received too late for inclusion with
the tabular matter for the Missionary Bands of the World, are as follows: 120
churches, 31 of which were reported as being in urban territory and 89 in rural;
and 86 church edifices with a reported value of $272,000 and an approximate
indebtedness of $5,000. There was a membership of 3,050, comprising 1,220
males and 1,830 females; and 78 Sunday schools with 468 officers and teachers and
2,730 pupils.
HISTORY,. DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
In 1885 a missionary society of young people was formed in the Free Methodist
Church by Rev. Vivian A. Dake. Gradually, as the members of the bands
came into closer fellowship, they united in distinct organizations and in 1898
became a separate body, adopting the name "Pentecost Bands of the World,"
with headquarters at Indianapolis, Ind. While primarily a home and foreign
missionary movement, it is practically a denomination. The doctrine corre-
sponds in general to that of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The bands have
I This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, has been revised by William H. Graef, secretary, Missionary Bandsofthe World, Indian-
apolis, Ind., and approved by him in ita present form. No history was furnished for the Church of God
(Holiness).

a regular membership, church edifices, and pastors, besides evangelistic and
mission work of a general character. The name of the organization was changed
to Missionary Bands of the World by the annual conference of 1925.
WORK
The various churches of the merged Missionary Bands of the World and Church
of God (Holiness) in America conduct a mission work in which about 341 licensed
ministers were engaged in 1936, including pastors, home mission workers, and
evangelists. The foreign mission work is carried on in India, Japan, Jamaica,
and Sweden, with property valued at about $40,000 and congregations numbering
about 1,200. There were 25 missionaries and about 70 native workers who car-
ried on this work in 1936. The entire work is unsalaried, being supported by
freewill offerings only.
The rescue work is conducted on a property worth $25,000, at Richton, Miss.
Headquarters' offices and camp-meeting property is worth $20,000.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classiflcation.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Pillar of Fire for the year 1936 is presented in
table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures between urban and
rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the
Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to
these churches only.
The membership of this denomination includes those persons who have made
profession of faith and have assented to the doctrines and practices of the church.
It is made up of four classes-probationary members, regular members, full
members, and associate members.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Pillar of Fire Church was incorporated in the State of Colorado, in 1902,
having been organized December 29, 1901, as the Pentecostal Union, under which
name it continued until October 6, 1917. It is now incorporated in several States
and has branches in England.
The history of the Pillar of Fire is to be found, mainly, in the life of its founder,
Mrs. Alma White. Early in her life as the wife of a Methodist minister, despite
the fact that the Methodist Church at that time gave no official recognition to
woman's ministry, Mrs. White occupied her husband's pulpit occasionally and
devoted much of her time to revival work. It was not long before she proved
to be a powerful preacher. Such success attended her efforts that she soon
aroused not only great interest, but also some opposition from the Methodist
bishops and presiding elders.
t This statement, which is substantially the same as that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodi~ 1926, has been revised by Rev. Albert L. Wolfram, A. B., treasurer, Pillar of Fire, Zarephath, N.J.,
and approved by him in its present form.

PILLAR OF FIRE 681
But notwithstanding this she continued to preach. In time she began to
establish missions of an independent character and soon acquired a considerable
following, organizing a regular society in 1901, which was incorporated in 1902,
in order to hold property. Her original plan was that the organization should be
a missionary society for the conversion of sinners and the spread of Scriptural
holiness, similar to the societies which John Wesley organized. But as Method-
ism, when it was raised up, had a special mission to perform, and finally became
a church in itself, distinct from the Church of England, so the Pillar of Fire in
its turn became a church distinct from the Methodist Church. It was found
that complete separation and independence from other denominations alone
could give the Pillar of Fire, with women as well as men in the pulpit, freedom to
pursue its course as an evangelizing and reforming force.
The organization has grown rapidly and has acquired valuable property,
and in 1908 it established its headquarters at Zarephath, N. J., about 30 miles
from New York City. Here, and at Bound Brook, 1,025 acres were acquired
and large buildings for schools and a printing plant erected.
DOCTRINE
The doctrinal beliefs include the fundamental doctrines of other orthodox
denominations; they are, in fact, Methodistic, any difference which exists coming
from a closer adherence to primitive standards, guarding against modern liberal-
ism and heresies; another difference is the extension of full ministerial orders to
women. Doctrinal points emphasized are: (I) Belief in the inspiration of the
Scriptures as the only sufficient rule of faith and practice; (2) repentance toward
God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (3) justification by faith, evidenced by
holy living; (4) Christian perfection or entire sanctification, which is interpreted
as a cleansing of the believer's heart from inbred sin or spiritual defilement, so
that the whole spirit, as well as the body, may be preserved blameless until
the coming of Christ-perfection or sanctification here not implying freedom
from mistakes or infirmities, but that Christian perfection which is purity of
heart and a perfect attitude toward God; (5) the immortality of the soul and
the resurrection of the body; (6) judgments as taught in the Scriptures; (7)
water baptism, which is a sign of regeneration, the mode being optional; (8) the
sacrament of the Lord's Supper; (9) marriage is a divine institution; (10) divine
healing for the body; (11) the premillennial coming of the Lord, and the restora-
tion of the Jews; (12) eternal punishment for the wicked and life everlasting for
the righteous.
ORGANIZATION
The Pillar of Fire Church is episcopal in that, like the Methodist Church,
its discipline provides for bishops, presiding elders, etc. Its orders include
regularly ordained ministers (both men and women), regularly ordained deacons
and deaconesses, consecrated deaconesses, licensed preachers, and missionaries.
Of the four classes of members, probationary, regular, full, and associate,
only the second and third classes are qualified to vote; regular members, consist-
ing of persons who have passed the probationary period, are qualified to vote on
matters of ecclesiastical administration; while persons in full membership, con-
sisting largely of regular members who are in active service as missionaries,
teachers, ministers, etc., have power to vote also on matters pertaining to the
financial administration.
WORK
Shortly after its incorporation the organization erected a training school at
Denver, Colo., and later a printing plant was established, from which were
issued the Pillar of Fire and numerous tracts and pamphlets. Upon the opening
of the larger buildings at Zarephath, N. J., the publication work in Denver
ceased for a short time, but was later resumed, the paper issued there taking the
name Rocky Mountain Pillar of Fire, also the Dry Legion, a temperance paper.
At Zarephath three schools have been established, Zarephath Bible Seminary,
Alma Preparatory School, and Alma White College, the latter being authorized
by the State of New Jersey to grant degrees in arts and sciences. There is also
a large printery where three papers are published, the Pillar of Fire, Woman's
Chains, and Pillar of Fire Junior, besides numerous books and pamphlets.
In 1919 the organization came into possession of Westminster College, near
Denver, Colo., once operated by the Presbyterians, now known as Belleview
Junior College. They have also erected a large auditorium at Denver, called
Digitized by Goog[e
682 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BO])IIES, 19 3 6
Alma Temple. In Los Angeles they conduct a Bible school and other schools
and publish the Occidental Pillar of Fire. In Cincinnati, Ohio, they conduct a
school; and at Jacksonville, Fla., there is a school and missionary headquarters,
and also day schools in some other cities.
In 1909 the Pillar of Fire opened missionary headquarters in London, England,
and a publishing department, from which are issued the British Sentinel and
the London Pillar of Fire. New and enlarged quarters were secured in 1925
and it is the purpose to make this branch-known as Alma White Bible Col-
lege--a center and headquarters for general foreign missionary work.
· A very important feature of the Pillar of Fire's activities is its missionary and
colporteur work in large cities of the United States, another is the opportunity
which it affords for the training and education, at little or no expense to them-
selves, of worthy young people.
The total valuation of church property is placed at $2,800,000, and school
property at $1,100,000. Money expended for educational work during 1936
amounted to $75,000; nearly $15,000 was appropriated for charity, in addition
to the assistance of students and others. Students in Pillar of Fire schools
numbered about 400.
In 1929 the Pillar of Fire acquired a radio station in Colorado now known as
KPOF. In 1931 permission was granted by the Government for the operation
of a broadcasting station at the national headquarters at Zarephath, N. J.,
known as WAWZ. Each of these stations operates on 1,000-watt power.

STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Federated Churches for the year 1936 is pre-
sented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures between
urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent
directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the
data relate to these churches only.
The membership requirements for the Federated Churches are those of its con-
stituent denominations. Provision is sometimes made for a "federated" or
"independent" membership, composed of persons who do not desire to affiliate
with any of these denominations.

The Federated Church represents one of the forms under which two or more
churches in a community have united for the joint prosecution of their work.
The organization of united churches of the various ty'pes in rural and village
communities is an interesting phase of religious development upon which some
light is thrown by the census of religious bodies. The consolidation of church
activities in places where the maintenance of two or more churches was found
to be impracticable, or at least ineffective, is due largely to two factors, namely,
the changes that are taking place in the ideals of church service and changes in
local economic conditions.
While at one time in the development of the church denominational rivalries
were so intense as to preclude organic union on any basis, today less emphasis
is placed on ancient creeds and other historic causes of separation. Further-
• In the preparation or this general statement a considerable amount or material, Cor which due !ICknowl-
edgment Is made, bas been taken from tbe volume entitled "Unltad Churches," by Elizabeth R. Hooker,
published In 11126 by the Instltute of Social and Religious Research, In New York City.
?r:!th:: c:gggJs
690 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BOD!IES, 19 3 6
more, the conviction is growing among all denominations that the message of
the gospel is in part social, as well as individual.
This change is well expressed by a modern church historian: "Not a rescue
by individual salvation only, but the establishment of a reign of righteousness
among men, has become increasingly the ideal * * *. Emphasis is there-
fore placed on service in preventative and reformatory effort." 2 This ideal
makes possible the union of two or more churches under certain circumstances,
where a narrow adherence to creeds might widely separate them.
Changing economic conditions have fostered the new attitude, especially in
the rural regions. The outlook of country people has been broadened by the
enlarged opportunities afforded by better transportation facilities, consolidated
schools, rural free delivery of mail, and the increased use of the telephone and
radio. Not the least of the factors contributing toward this closer relationship
is the campaign of education in community spirit which has been conducted
by various social welfare agencies.
When, therefore, by reason of changes occasioned by the flow of population
from country to city, reduced local economic prosperity, or increased cost of
church maintenance, an organized religious body becomes too weak to be effec-
tive, union with another local church in like circumstances seems the natural
and logical step. The result has been the rise of the united churches in various
forms.
In 1906 and 1916 these churches were included, without discrimination, in the
data for Independent Churches. However, in 1926, a definite segregation was
made and the Federated Churches were given separate presentation.
As here used, the term "united church" indicates a church whose member-
ship, either regular or associate, is composed of elements representing different
denominations, the elements in some cases being organized churches and in
others individuals. The four types or groups of united churches found in the
United States, as reported to the Census of Religious Bodies, in the order of
their importance, are:
1. Denominational united, a type in which one or more of the uniting
churches has given up its denominational allegiance in order to merge with
another church and has accepted the denominational connection of the other.
2. Federated, a type in which each of the combining units retains its con-
nection with its own denominational body.
3. Undenominational, a type in which union results in an organized church
not connected with any denominational body.
4. Affiliated, a type resembling the undenominational church in control of
its local affairs, but having an attenuated connection with a denominational
body, usually for ministerial supply and distribution of benevolences only.
As the first and fourth groups are more or less closely identified with their
denominations, their statistics have been included in the denominational totals.
The third, or undenominational group, has been included in the statistics for
Independent Churches.
The Federated Churches, however, since each maintains relations with more
than one of the established denominations, cannot well be consolidated with any
denominational group, and they are therefore given independent presentation in
this report. There is further reason for making these churches the subject of a
special presentation in that the federation of churches is of particular interest
as affording a solution to a vexing problem-the problem of what to do with
those churches in a rural group which are too weak to be efficient and yet are
staunchly loyal to their denominations.
The term "community church" is not employed as a classifying term in the
census reports, because a study of the word disclosed that its use was ambiguous,
more than half a dozen different usages being noted. The same diversity in use
was found in regard to the term "union church."
Federated Churches are those made up of two or more denominational organi-
zations, each maintaining a separate membership and perhaps some separate
activities. The Federated Church acts as one body, however, in the holding of
religious services and, usually, in the maintenance of a Sunday school and in most
or all social activities. The different denominational units of which the Federated
Church is composed are closely identified with their respective denominations,
not only by retention of their distinctive membership, but also by the common
practice in each unit of recognizing its missionary obligations and sending to its
own denominational board contributions for home and foreign missions, etc., and

of keeping such property as it may own in the hands of its own trustees. They are
united for local purposes only, in calling and paying a minister, in the holding of
services, and in maintaining a common Sunday school. The distinguishing char-
acteristics of this type of church are, therefore, that the two or more units enter
into an agreement to conduct most of their activities as a single church, but to
preserve the organic integrity of each denominational group.
The first Federated Church is said to have been formed in Massachusetts
in 1887. Its formation appears to have been due to economic pressure, as the
two churches which united were unable to finance their op~rations separately
and made the experiment of joining for local activities. This experiment proved
successful.
Church leaders who were alarmed at the overchurched situation in the rural
sections of New England were quick to recognize the possibilities of this type of
united church and not only lent their influence to prevent the organization of
additional competing churches, but actively cooperated in the formation of
Federated Churches. In fact, it is stated that the first Federated Church in
Vermont, organized in 1899, was formed at the suggestion of denominational
leaders. Both official and local leadership have played important parts in the
organizing of this type of church, but it is probable that local necessity and a
deeper sense of the church's responsibility for its immediate environment have
been the determining factors in a majority of cases.
Federated Churches were formed at first only in New England, but by the
year 1912 they had spread to many other parts of the country. The schedules
returned for the 1936 census show 508 Federated Churches, located in 42 States
of the Union. Of the total number reporting, 244, or 48 percent, were found in
New England and the Middle Atlantic States, and 184, or 36.2 percent, in the
North Central States. Thirty-three such churches were located in the Pacific
States, while 26 were in the South and 21 in the Mountain States.
Of the whole number, only 82 churches, or less than 17 percent, were reported
as being located in urban territory, which includes all cities or incorporated
places having 2,500 inhabitants or more in 1930, while 426 churches, or more
than 83 percent, were in rural territory, which comprises the remainder of the
country.
DOCTRINE
Each unit, or constituent part, of the Federated Church retains in its entirety
the doctrine of the denominational body to which it adheres; and the member-
ship requirements of each unit correspond exactly to those of the denomination.
ORGANIZATION
In order to function as a single body, the Federated Church has, besides
officials of the ordinary church of the denominational type, a joint committee
which is in charge of the general activities of the church. This committee is
generally representative of the units comprising the church, although in some
churches it is.selected without reference to such representation. Frequently
important officers, such as elders and deacons, are chosen by the units separately.
The history of these churches seems to indicate, however, that the longer the
church exists as a federation the fewer officers are elected by action of the separate
units. The same tendency toward united action is noted in regard to the finances
of the Federated Church. At. first the units are often held responsible for the
raising of a proportionate share of the budget, but after the federation has lasted
for some time the budget is generally provided for by the entire church.
All local ex})enses, including the salary of the minister, are paid by the church
as a whole. In many Federated Churches the minister is chosen alternately
from the different denominations represented by the units constituting the
church; in others there is an agreement to procure the minist.er from one denomi-
nation only; while still others agree to disregard the denomination of the minister
in making a choice.
Sunday schools are generally held in common. Of the 508 Federated Churches
reporting to the Census Bureau, 484 reported Sunday schools, which were almost
always held jointly.
The great majority of the churches have two denominational units only, as,
for example, a Congregational unit and a Methodist unit. About 10 percent
of the total number have three denominational units, but the churches composed
of more than three such units are comparatively few.

692 CENSUS! OF RELIGIOUS BOmES, 1936
Certain denominations were found to predominate in this type of church.
More than three-fourths of the total number of units of all Federated Churches
studied belonged to four denominations. The predominance of these denomi-
nations, in the 1,032 denominational units making up the whole number of Fed-
erated Churches reporting, is indicated below:
Congregationalists and Christians.._____________________________ 298
Methodists-------------------------------------------------- 269
Presbyterians_______________________________________________ 165
Baptists________________ ----------------------- _____________ 153
Fifteen other denominations_______ _________ __________________ 147
Students of the subject of Federated Churches have made certain interesting
observations concerning their tendencies, as well 1\S those of the other types
of united churches. It has been found that a church which has organized in
one way sometimes changes to another type of united church, or even into a
strictly denominational church of the traditional sort. For example, a denomi-
national united church may in time ally itself with one or the other of the included
denominations, or it may become an undenominational church, or it may become
an affiliated church; but it was found that few churches which had united by
actually consolidating or combining their elements ever again resume separate
existence. ·
Some of the Federated Churches, however, do dissolve and permit the con-
stituent units to resume their original status, though the majority become more
and more closely united. Federated Churches, it may be said in general, have a
tendency to develop either into strictly denominational churches or into churches
which are affiliated with a single denomination. But it has been ascertained that
after a Federated Church has lasted as such for 2 years the federation is likely
to be permanent, and that after 5 years of such existence the federation is
rarely abandoned.

summary of the statistics for the Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the
Americas for the year 1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribu-
tion of these figures between urban and rural territory. These statistics were
compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of
the individual churches and the data relate to these churches only.
The membership of this denomination consists of all persons admitted to the
local churches upon confession of faith.
This church was not reported prior to the 1936 Census, and no comparative
data are available.

The first general council of the Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the
Americas was held at Anderson, S. C., 1898. It was at that time called the Fire
Baptized Holiness Association of America as reported by W. E. Fuller:
There were 140 representatives from various parts of the United States
and Dominion of Canada and I, W. E. Fuller, was the only colored repre-
sentative among them. Here it was that this grand old church of ours began
among our own people.
We were connected with the white people for 10 years and at the expira-
tion of 10 years we met again at Anderson, S. C., 1908, and owing to the
growing prejudice that began to arise among the people outside this denomi-
nation, it was mutually agreed that we have separate incorporations.
During our connection we accumulated upwards of $20,000 worth of prop-
erty and at the separation we were given warranty deeds for the same.
I This statement was prepared from material taken from the Discipline printed by The True Witness
Publishing Co., Seneca, S. C.

W. E. Fuller was elected general overseer and C. C. Childs was elected secre-
tary and treasurer. The membership at that time, according to the general
secretary's record, was 925.
From 1922 to 1926 this church operated under the title Fire Baptized Holiness
Church of God. In 1926 the General Council met with Mt. Moriah Fire Baptized
Holiness Church at Knoxville, Tenn. During this council it was voted to change
the name of this church to the Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the
Americas.
DOCTRINE
The object and purpose of this church is threefold: (1) For the deepening of
our spiritual life, so that all our members may attain and impress every Christian
believer to seek the highest Christian experience possible in this life. (Matt. 5:
14-16.)
(2) To ordain elders, pastors, evangelists, missionaries, and teachers, divinely
called and set apart according to their gifts and calling, who shall be required to
teach and preach the doctrine set forth in the Basis of Union. (I Cor. 7:20;
Titus 1:5.)
(3) To enforce ordinances enacted by Christ and practiced by the holy Apostles
and fathers of the early church, such as baptism (Matt. 3:16) and administration
of the Lord's Supper as instituted by Himself, followed by washing of the saints'
feet (St. John 13: 4, 17); solemnizing matrimony (I Peter 2: 13, 15) and burying
the dead.
Article III. The Basis of Union, shown in the Discipline, contains the doctrinal
basis for this denomination. It believes and teaches repentance; regeneration;
justification; sanctification; pentecostal baptism, speaking with other tongues as
the spirit gives utterance; divine healing of the body; and the premillennial sec-
ond coming of Christ. It also teaches the sanctity of marriage.
It utterly opposes the teachings of the so-called Christian Scientists, Spirit-
ualists, Unitarians, Universalists, and Mormons. It denies as false and unscrip-
tural Adventism, immorality, antinomianism, annihilation of the wicked, the
glorification of the body, and many other modern teachings of the day.
No subsequent general council shall have authority to change the Basis of
Union without a full representation from the local churches.
ORGANIZATION
The Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas recognizes and
acknowledges the Lord Christ as the supreme head and rightful governor of the
church in all its departments. The organization includes the following officers:
A bishop, two overseers, general secretary, treasurer, and board of trustees.
The local churches are served by the ruling elders, ordained ministers, and
pastors. A general convention meets annually for the purpose of raising funds
for education, orphanage, and missionary purposes.

GENERAL STATEMENT
The general history of the different bodies of Friends is presented in the state-
ment for the older, or Orthodox, body. The specific statements, therefore, in
regard to each of the other bodies indicate the differences between them and the
Orthodox Friends.
The four bodies included in this group in 1936, in 1926, in 1916, and in 1906
are listed below, with the principal statistics as reported for the four periods.
These statistics were compiled from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the
pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the data relate to these churches
only.

The religious situation in England during the first half of the seventeenth
century has been described as "a hurly-burly of religious polemics." The
civil war, the unsatisfactory social and business conditions, the rival claims of
the adherents of the different ecclesiastical forms and creeds, and the discussions
as to the respective rights of pastors and people caused thoughtful men of the
country to become utterly dissatisfied with church and state, and, indeed, with
almcst every existing institution.
It was in the midst of this period, in 1624, that George Fox was born, in Fenny
Drayton, Leicestershire. He was a sober-minded serious youth, and early had
his mind turned to religious matters. After severe mental and spiritual struggles,
he was led to emphasize the spiritual side of Christianity. While external forms
of religion were not ignored, he taught the necessity of divine power within the
man to enable him to live according to the will of God, the direct communication
of this will to the individual believer in Christ, and the necessity of a perfect
consistency between the outward life and the religious profession. This was
unfamiliar teaching to most persons in that day of rigid adherence to creeds and
of great formalism in religious observances. Fox soon gathered around him
a band of preachers who, with himself, spread their doctrines far and wide in
Great Britain, and later extended their missionary efforts to Ireland, the Conti-
nent of Europe, the West Indies, and North America, in which countries, pR.rtic-
ularly America, they gained many adherents. It does not seem to have been
their intention to establish a new branch of the church, but, almost before they
knew it, an organization had developed.
At first they called .themselves "Children of Truth" or "Children of Light,"
also "Friends of Truth," and finally the name which was given to them was the
"Religious Society of Friends," to which was frequently added "commonly called
Quakers." This last name was applied to them by a justice in response to an
address, in which George Fox called on him to "tremble at the Word of the Lord."
I This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. n of the Report on Relldous
Bodies 1926, has been revised by Walter C. Woodward, secretary of the executive committee of theFive
Years Meeting or the Friends in .America, Richmond, Ind., and approved by him In Ita preeent form.
706 CENSU'SI OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
Many of the extreme charges against them, as, for example, those with regard
to the disturbance of public worship, were greatly exaggerated. At the same
time their refusal to attend the services of the Established Church, to support it
by the payment of tithes, or to take oaths of any kind, and their uncompromising
attitude toward much of the religious preaching of the day created a great deal
of bitterness against them and brought upon them severe persecution. Heavy
fines were imposed upon them; their property was confiscated; and, worst of all,
they were subjected to long imprisonments in the horrible jails of the time.
Nevertheless, they increased in numbers, until by the close of the seventeenth
century they were one of the most important bodies of dissenters in England.
With the cessation of persecution, about the beginning of the eighteenth cen-
tury, the Friends relaxed their missionary zeal, paid more attention to the disci-
pline of their members, and gradually settled down into a comparatively quiet
existence. So far, however, was this discipline carried, in its minute supervision
of the actions of members, that their numbers declined, and some have expressed
a wonder that the society continued to exist at all. About the middle of the
nineteenth century a new movement began, and since that time the great ma-
jority of the Friends have either dropped or modified many of the old customs
and external forms.
The first recorded visit of any Quakers to America was that of two women,
Ann Austin and Mary Fisher, who arrived in Massachusetts from Barbados in
1656. They were immediately put under arrest, subjected to a brutal examina-
tion to see whether they were witches, and finally shipped back to Barbados.
Two days after their departure a vessel arrived with eight more Quakers, and
these were forcibly returned to England. Severe laws were enacted and heavy
~nalties provided for those who knowingly brought into the community that
'cursed sect of heretics lately risen up in the world which are commonly called
'Quakers,' who take upon them to be immediately sent of God and infallibly
assisted by the Spirit to speak and write blasphemous opinions, despising govern-
ment and the order of God in church and commonwealth,'' etc. Notwithstand-
ing these laws, the Quakers continued to come, and at last the situation im-
proved, although it was not until 1724 that their appeals to the Royal Privy
Council in England were sustained. A few years later laws were enacted in
their favor.
The Friends had almost as trying an experience in Virginia as in Massachusetts,
and they suffered certain persecutions in Connecticut. In Rhode Island, how-
ever, they were received more cordially and were held in high regard, several of
the early Governors being members of the society. In New York, New Jersey,
and Maryland there were many Friends. The culmination of their influence
was reached in Pennsylvania, under the charter given to William Penn in return
for a debt due by the Crown to his father, Admiral Penn.
The society continued to grow during the first half of the eighteenth century
but drew more within itself in view of the general disturbances resulting from the
colonial wars and the political situation, and Friends were discouraged from
membership in the assembly or from holding any public office. These conditions
led to the establishment, in 1756, of the first "meeting for sufferings" in America,
whose object was to extend relief and assistance to members of the society who
might suffer from the Indians or other enemies on the frontier, and in general to
look out for the interests of the society. The relation of the Friends to the Indians
was one of cordial interest, following the position taken not only by William Penn,
but also by George Fox.
With regard to &lavery, the early attitude of the Friends was one of toleration,
although they insisted that the slaves should be treated humanely. A develop-
ment, however, was inevitable, and in 1688 the German Friends, at a meeting
in Germantown, Pa., protested against the "traffic in the bodies of men" and
considered the question of the "lawfulness and unlawfulness of buying and
keeping Negroes." The question continued to be agitated, and, chiefly through
the efforts of John Woolman, in 1758, the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting directed
a "visitation" of all who held slav-es and decided that all who should "be con-
cerned in importing, selling, or purchasing slaves" should be forbidden to sit in
meetings held for deciding matters of discipline. In 1776 slaveholders were to be
"disowned" if they refused to manumit their slaves, and by the close of the
eighteenth century personal ownership of slaves by acknowledged members of
the society had ceased, except where slaves were held by trustees and State laws
did not allow them to be set free. In the transition, however, care was taken
that feeble or incapable persons should not suffer.
In the disturbances that preceded the Revolution the Friends were in hearty
sympathy with the desire of their fellow citizens to obtain redress of grievances,

but since, from religious principle, they took no part in warlike measures, and
refused to serve in the Army, or to pay taxes levied for warlike purposes, they were
subjected to very great misapprehension and suffering, and their property was
often seized to pay for recruits or for the meeting of taxes. Some, indeed, sup-
ported the Revolution actively. These were disowned or seceded and were
known as the "Free" or "Fighting" Quakers. This small body soon dwindled
away. After the close of the war the Friends loyally sustained the new
government.
The early part of the nineteenth century was marked by divisions on doctrinal
points, resulting in separations more or less serious. The most important of
these was that popularly known as the "Hicksite" in 1827-28.2 This was followed
by th_
e "Wilburite" in 1845 a and the "Primitive" a little later.f
During the years following there was a period of considerable ministerial
activity, ministers traveling up and down the country, visiting the congregations
and holding meetings, to some extent, with the public.
As the slavery question came up more prominently the Friends appeared in the
front rank of the antislavery forces, and their poet, John Greenleaf Whittier,
did perhaps as much as anyone to make current the Quaker conception of Christi-
anity. As the Civil War drew on, they endeavored to maintain their ground in
favor of peace, although not a few members of the different branches were found
in the Army. The close of the war brought relief, and a Peace Association of
Friends in America was organized, which put lecturers into the field, issued
tracts, and started a monthly publication, the Messenger of Peace. It is to
be noted that too movement for international arbitration received perhaps its
strongest impulse from the annual gatherings at Lake Mohonk, N. Y., under
the auspices of a Friend.
During the past two or three decades, chiefly as a result of the Five Years
Meeting, there has been a strong tendency toward greater unity of effort in the
fields of home and foreign missions, Bible schools, education, evangelistic work,
philanthropy, and social reform. This is true of all branches of the society.
The relations to other bodies of Christians have become closer, and Friends have
joined with other churches in the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in
America and similar organizations.
DOCTRINE
The Orthodox Friends, who are by far the most numerous branch, have never
adopted a formal creed. Their doctrine agrees in all essential points with the
doctrine of the great body of the Christian Church, but they differ from other
denominations in the following important respects: (1) The great importance
attached to the immediate person~ teaching of the Holy Spirit, or "Light Within,"
or "Inner Light" ; (2) the absence of all outward ordinances, including baptism
and the Supper, on the ground that they are not essential, were not commanded
by Christ, and, moreover, tend to draw the soul away from the essential to the
nonessential and formal; (3) the manner of worship and appointment of ministers;
(4) the doctrine of peace or nonresistance, in accordance with which no Friend
can consistently fight or directly support war.
ORGANIZATION
The organization of the Society of Friends includes monthly, quarterly, and
yearly meetings, each being a purely business organization. The monthly meet-
ing is either a single congregation, or includes two or more congregations, called
variously, weekly, local, or preparative meetings. The monthly meetings in a
certain district combine to form a quarterly meeting, and the quarterly meetings
in a wider territory constitute a_yearly meeting.
The yearly meetings in the United States are 14 in number: New England,
established in 1661; Baltimore, 167~ Philadelphia, first held at Burlington,
N.J., 1681; New York, 1695; North lJarolina, 1698; Ohio, 1812; Indiana, 1821;
Western (Indiana), 1857; Iowa, 1863; Kansas, 1872; Wilmington (Ohio), 1892;
Oregon, 1893; California, 1895· and Nebraska, 1908. These meetings were inde-
pendent and each had its own discipline, but in 1902 all except Ohio and Philadel-
phia entered into a loose confederation and adopted a discipline that was uniform
in essentials but modified in details to suit local conditions.' Each yearly meeting

is independent in the transaction of its own business but gives authority in
certain matters of common interest to a body of delegates from the yearly meet-
ings composing the confederation referred to, which is known as the Five Years
Meeting, from its convening once in 5 years. The functions of this body, however,
are chiefly advisory.
The unit of authority in the society is the yearly meeting, to which every man,
woman, and child who is counted in the society's membership belongs, and
every one of these has an equal right to speak on any matter before the meeting.
Members of different quarterly meetings, sometimes called delegates, are ap-
pointed to attend the yearly meetings, in order to insure a representation, but
no one of them has precedence over any other member. The quarterly meeting
receives reports from the monthly meetings, appoints committees on various
lines of meeting business and Christian work, and informs the monthly meetings
how much each is expected to contribute toward the expenses of the yearly
meeting. The monthly meeting is the executive power so far as the member-
ship is concerned, although appeal may be made to the quarterly and yearly meet-
ings. It receives and, on occasion, can disown members and has the direct
oversight of the congregations. Its regular officers are elders and overseers, ap-
pointed by the monthly meeting. The elders and overseers have general super-
vision of the membership. Ministers are not spoken of as regular officers,
inasmuch as the organization is complete without them.
There is less formal provision for the training of ministers than in most other
denominations. While the value of intellectual training is recognized, it is not con-
sidered wholly essential, since ministers are "called of God, and the call to work is
bestowed irrespective of rank, learning, or sex." The theory is that the church
recognizes when a man or woman is qualified and has received the "gift," and
acknowledges it, after which he or she is called and acknowledged, recommended,
or recorded as a minister. There is no ceremony of ordination, and often the
minister receives no salary, although a change has taken place in this respect,
and in most places where pastoral work is expected ministers are paid. When a
minister feels a call to engage in special religious work or to visit another section
on a religious mission, he asks the monthly meeting to which he belongs for liberty
to do so. For an extended journey he must obtain the consent of the quarterly
meeting. If that consent is refused, he is expected to remain at home. If he
wishes to cross the ocean, the certificate given him is not complete without the
endorsement of the yearly meeting and of the yearly meeting on ministry and
oversight. The yearly meeting on ministry and oversight, composed of ministers,
elders, and, with a single exception, of overseers also, meets at regular times to
review the general state of the membership and consider the needs of the work,
although it has no disciplinary powers. A similar meeting, sometimes called the
"select" meeting, of ministers and elders is held in connection with the regular
quarterly meeting.
Woman is in a position of absolute equality with man in Friends' polity.
The worship of a Friends' meeting is distinctly nonliturgical. Since the Friends
believe that worship is fundamentally a personal matter between the soul and
God and can be carried on with or without a minister, meetings for worship can
be held partly or even wholly in silence. Formerly there was no prearrangement
of service, but some prearrangement is now generally common, with the exception
of the more conservative groups, including those in Philadelphia. There is no
stated length for any sermon, prayer, or exhortation, and often several persons,
not necessarily ministers, take part during the same meeting.
WORK
Within the decade the home and foreign mission activities of the Five Years
Meeting have been united under one board known as the American Friends Board
of Missions. Home mission work carried on cooperatively in addition to that
conducted by the yearly meetings consists of work among the mountaineers in
Tennessee and among the Indians in Oklahoma. Fourteen workers are engaged
in these two fields. The work among the Indians is under the direct administra-
tion of the Associated Executive Committee on Indian Affairs but is included in
the appropriations made by the mission board, to which the aforementioned
committee makes annual report.
Foreign missionary work is conducted in Palestine, British East Africa, Cuba,
Jamaica, Mexico, and West China. In 1937 the board reported 31 missionaries
and 1,006 native workers in 136 centers; and they reported 49 churches, with
11,272 members; 373 schools, with 18,821 pupils; and 1 hospital. The contribu-
tions for missions during the year amounted to $56,700. The endowment fund
totaled $84,130.

Philadelphia Friends carry on work in Japan, Ohio Friends in China and India,
California Friends in Central America and Alaska, and Oregon Friends in Bolivia.
Without doubt the outstanding development of Quaker activity within the
decades 1916-36 has been registered in the far-reaching reconstruction, relief, and
good-will work carried on by the Society of Friends both in Europe and in this
country. This is a work in which not only the so-called Orthodox but all groups
of Friends have united, with headquarters at Philadelphia.
Notably distinctive throughout the decade has been the work of the American
Friends Service Committee, which is inclusive of all Friends in America. Organ-
ized in 1917, it carried on a far-reaching program of reconstruction relief and good
will in the war-stricken areas of Europe. Reconstruction units were first engaged
in rebuilding demolished villages in France. Following the armistice, arrange-
ments were soon made to carry on a huge child-feeding program in Germany,
which included more than 1,000,000 children and involved an expenditure in
money and kind of more than $25,000,000. The Service Committee was made
the dispensing agency of the American Relief Administration and other relief-
fund organizations. Reconstruction, relief, and health work were also carried on
in Austria, Serbia, Poland, and Russia.
As the era of the need of food and physical relief gradually passed, Friends con-
tinued their work in Europe in the areas which they had served, now emphasizing
moral and spiritual values as a means of the furtherance of understanding and good
will among the European peoples. In cooperation with the British Friends they
maintained a number of peace "embassies' or good-will centers in Europe. This
work has been developed within the decade. Strong emphasis has been placed
upon centers maintained at Paris, Berlin, Geneva, and Vienna. Developments in
Central Europe since 1933 have accentuated the importance of these European
<>enters. Because of successive emergencies in Austria, programs of active relief
have been revived. At various times, Friends have been called upon by opposing
parties and factions to dispense relief in Vienna.
Not long after the outbreak of the civil war in Spain, the American Friends
Service Committee, in cooperation with English Friends, gradually developed a
relief program for that stricken country. As an expression of their philosophy
of good will, Friends have conducted relief on a strictly nonpartisan basis, rendering
help impartially to those in need among the nationalists and among the loyalists.
From the American viewpoint, the decade has shown a significant development
of the Service Committee program at home. The depression years brought many
industrial emergencies to the fore, among them, that of the soft-coal areas in
western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. At the request of the
President of the United States, Friends undertook a relief program in this section
in which thousands of children were given supplementary feeding through the
schools. On the basis of this relief work, Friends gradually became concerned
for the more thoroughgoing work of rehabilitation, in which they undertook ex-
periments which helped point the way for governmental action. An example of
this work is found in the subsistence homestead development maintained by
Friends at Penn Craft near Republic, Pa. In harmony with this concern the
Service Committee has developed a thoroughgoing program of summer work
camps over the country located near industrial friction areas. These camps in-
volve a definite work project of value to the community and offer a means of
direct study of industrial problems. Another significant feature developed by the
committee within the decade has been the establishment and gradual extension
from coast to coast of a system of summer Institutes on International Relations.
As many as 10 of these institutes have been maintained in a given summer which
have been served by faculties recruited from the ranks of leading internationalists
and authorities on political science in this country and abroad.
Throughout their history Friends have been keenly interested in fostering the
interests of Christian education. In keeping with this historic concern they
maintain 9 colleges in which are enrolled approximately 3,000 students. They
are as follows: Haverford College, Haverford, Pa.; Guilford College, Guilford
College N. C.; Wilmington College, Wilmington, Ohio· Earlham College Rich-
mond, ind.; William Penn College, Oskaloosa, Iowa; Nebraska Central College,
Central City, Nebr.; Friends University, Wichita, Kans.; Whittier College,
Whittier, Calif.; and Pacific College, Newberg, Oreg. With the exception of
Haverford, these institutions are all coeducational. Formerly, Friends main-
tained a large number of strong secondary schools, but with the development of
the public high school as an important factor of the system of public education
these have largely been discontinued. However, several strong boarding schools
are maintained in the Atlantic States. Among these are Oak Grove School for
710 CENSU'S OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
Girls, Eae:t Vassalboro, Maine; Lincoln School for Girls and Moses Brown School
for Boys, Providence, R. I.; Oakwood School, Poughkeepsie, N. Y.; and West-
town School, Westtown, Pa., which are coeducational. A coeducational boarding
school is also maintained at Friendsville, Tenn.
Shortly following the close of the decade there was held in the Philadelphia. area
in September 1937, on the campuses of Swarthmore and Haverford colleges, a
World Conference of Friends, with representatives present from 24 countries.
'T'his marked the first really ecumenical gathering in the history of the Society of
Friends. It was inclusive of Friends of all groups.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Society of Friends from its rise has put central emphasis upon the divine
power within each individual, which was called the "Inner Light" or the "Light
of Christ Within." Friends have never adopted a creed but have held that each
individual should be free to follow the truth as his light revealed it to him. In
such a religious fellowship there is wide diversion of personal opinion on theolog-
ical issues. There has often been harmony of spirit even with a wide diversity
of religious experience.
The separation of 1827 was caused partly by the reaction to the unitarian-
trinitarian issue of the time, partly by the difference between the evangelical
movement and the mystical movement within the society itself and partly by
misunderstanding between local grol!ps. There had been liberal thinking in the
Society of Friends since the time of George Fox. The liberal group in 1827 made
no claim to be unitarian in doctrine. They held, however, that each man should
have the right to believe that which his best judgment showed him to be true.
As the discussion developed, Elias Hicks, a minister of remarkable personality,
became the central figure. Believing that "God is a Spirit," he held that "a man-
ifestation of His Spirit is given to every man everywhere, and that this alone if
followed and obeyed is sufficient for his salvation." While Elias Hicks was a
prominent personal factor in the discussion he was not a direct mover in behalf
of the separation. In the division each branch claimed to be the original Society
of Friends. The word Hicksite for the liberal branch has been used as a nick-
name, but never adopted by that body. They have not considered as a group
that they accepted the opinions advocated by Elias Hicks.
The separatiOn occurred first in 1827 in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. It was
followed by a similar division in the Yearly Meetings of New York, Ohio, Indiana,
and Baltimore. At the time of the division the Hicksites were in the majority in
Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore, and the Orthodox groups in the majority
in Ohio and Indiana. There was no division at this time in the Yearly Meetings
of New England, Virginia, and North Carolina, each of which maintained its
affiliation with the Orthodox body.
The history of the Hicksite branch since 1827 has been similar to that of the
Orthodox branch, except that it was not influenced by the evangelical movement,
and it developed its own lines of work. Since 1917 all branches of Friends have
been increasingly working together. The significant items in present-day history
include all groups of Friends.
I Thisstatement, which dlfters somewhatfrom that published In vol. II of the Report on Religious Bodies,
lll26, has been revised by 1. Barnard Walton, secretary, Friends' General Conference, Philadelphia, Pa..,
and approved by him In its present form.

716 CENSIUSI OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 1936
DOCTRINE
The Hicksite Friends hold that the fundamental principle of the society has
always been a belief in and a reliance upon the "light within." This means that
there is a measure of the divine spirit in each individual. This leads to a rever-
ence for the personality of every man, and to a recognition of the brotherhood of
all men. The application of this principle leads to the recognition of the equality
of men and women, to the treatment of dependents and delinquents in the light
of their infinite possibilities, and to the use of nonviolent methods in seeking
justice in controversial issues, whether industrial, interracial, or international.
ORGANIZATION
In method of church government and in worship this branch follows the method
of the early Friends. In worship, the responsibility is placed equally upon every
individual. Communion with God is sought not through outward ritual, but
through the influence of the divine spirit within. No one is appointed to conduct
a service and no salary is paid to a minister. The meeting for worship depends
upon the values to be found in silent meditation and prayer, and in the democratic
ministry that may be shared by all who are present.
In government, the monthly meeting of the congregation is the primary execu-
tive body. It is presided over by a clerk who is the servant of the body. Issues
that are raised are discussed with an earnest purpose to find the way that is in
accordance with truth. No vote is taken, but the whole group seeks to reach a
unity on the question in hand. When this unity is reached the clerk prepares a
minute which when agreed to is the action of the meeting.
District organizations including several monthly meetings are called quarterly
meetings. A number of quarterly meetings in an area about the size of a State
form a yearly meeting. The six yearly meetings of this branch are united in
Friends' General Conference which holds biennial gatherings in the even years.
WORK
The major interest of this group of Friends has been expressed in social service
and in education. It took an active part in the abolition movement and founded
two schools for Negroes in South Carolina after the war. It has worked for
temperance, social hygiene, peace, and prison reform. At present it is con-
cerned with standards of community life and standards of public and private
relief.
Under the care of this branch of Friends or acknowledging the application of
its principles are-1 college located at Swarthmore, Pa., and 16 preparatory and
secondary schools situated in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, and the District of Columbia. The college has 600 students and the
other schools an aggregate of 3,541 pupils. All are coeducational.
Some social work is conducted by local meetings in their own locality. Most
of the social work of Friends, however, is the result of their participation in com-
munity organizations, and therefore it cannot be reported statistically.
A hospital for nervous and cancerous diseases has been conducted at Fox
Chase, Philadelphia, since 1928. A social settlement is maintained in an old
Friends meeting house in Philadelphia and is now supported by the Welfare
Federation. One high and industrial school is conducted for Negroes in North
Carolina with 350 pupils and an annual budget of $17,500.
In some sections there are Friends homes for elderly people and in some cities
there are Friends centers conducted as residences for transients, for young people
who are at work and for elderly people. There are 13 of these institutions in
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, and Indiana, accommodating about
400 persons.
The young people's work of this body is organized through the Young Friends
Movement. The objectives are (I) the interesting of young people in religious work
and (2) the furnishing of an opportunity for young people to take an active part in
the work of the society. The Young Friends Movement is a united activity of
the branches and one of its dominant motives is to build toward a real unity in
the Society of Friends.
Since 1902 a definite attempt has been made to coordinate the society's activi-
ties, extend its influence, and promote its principles. This effort took shape in
the appointment of a committee for the Advancement of Friends Principles and
the opening of headquarters in Philadelphia with a secretary. This movement
attempts to train the rank and file of the members to be spokesmen of the Society

SOCIETY OF FRIENDS ( H£CKSITE) 717
of Friends and to interpret its teachings to those who are interested. It helps in
the starting of new meetings.
The Advancement Committee founded in 1915 at Swarthmore, Pa., a school for
religious and social study called Woolman School. In 1917 this school was
reorganized under a board of representatives of all Friends. In 1925 it was moved
to Wyncote, Pa. In 1929 it was again reorganized under a more representative
board of all Friends with the name of Pendle Hill. It was located at Wallingford,
Pa. It is now the eenter for the promotion of religious and social studies for all
Friends in America.
The united work of all Friends for foreign service, for peace education, and for
social-industrial issues in America, is conducted through the American Friends
Service Committee.

HISTORY, DOCTffiNE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The second separation among Orthodox Friends was brought about by a pro-
test against what was believed by Wilbur and others to be radical departures
from the original principles of the society.
John Wilbur, a minister of the New England Yearly Meeting, while visiting
in Great Britain during the years 1831-32, believed that Joseph John Gurney
was advocating doctrines contrary to the accepted teachings of Friends from the
beginning; and when Gurney later came to America, in order to prevent his
being received and thus spreading what was thought to be insidious doctrines,
Wilbur adopted a disciplinary course which was not acceptable to the larger
part of his meeting. There was a separation of those who with Wilbur believed
that the society was departing from the original principles and the ancient faith
of Friends, and a yearly meeting was set up in New England in 1845. There was
increasing unrest in Ohio Yearly Meeting resulting in a part of the membership,
who were in sympathy with Joseph John Gurney, withdrawing in 1854; as in
New England, the minority groups withdrew from Kansas and Iowa in 1877-79,
and North Carolina in 1904.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
Fully believing that the doctrines set forth by the society in the beginning
should be maintained in their purity, they endeavor to bear witness to the spiritual-
ity of the Gospel. They own and believe in Christ Jesus, the beloved and only
Son of God, and in redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
They believe in the Holy Spirit, or Comforter, whom Christ declared He would
send in His name to lead and guide His followers into all truth; that the Holy
Spirit convicts for sin, and if obeyed, gives power to the soul to overcome and
forsake sin. They hold that the Holy Scriptures contain a declaration of all the
fundamental doctrines and principles relating to eternal life and salvation;
though they do not call them the "Word of God," believing that term to be
applicable to Jesus only, yet they are believed to be the words of God, written
by holy men as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. Believing in the resurrec-
tion, they reject, however, the belief in the resurrection of the body, as nothing
material ever enters the spiritual world. In consequence of their belief that the
baptism which saves is inward and spiritual, they do not practice water baptism;
and, as all true and acceptable worship of God is offered in the immediate moving
of His own Spirit, they seek in public worship to wait before Him without outward
form or ceremony.
The ministry among them is exerciRed by men and women, freely, without
money and without price, as freshly called forth. In general, they hold and
believe as did the early Friends. As a rule, they have not been in favor of Bible
schools, but of late such schools have been set up in some of the meetings.
WORK
They have 1 academy, with 78 students, and 3 elementary and graded schools,
with 28 pupils. The value of property used for educational purposes is estimated
at $171,500, and there is an endowment of about $140,000.
They have no missionary enterprises and no philanthropic institutions, but
as individuals they are interested in numerous efforts along many lines and
contribute to the work maintained by other Friends.
t This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodles,1926, has been revised by James Walton, Barnesville, Ohio, and approved by him in its present form.

FRIENDS (PRIMITIVE)
STATISTICS
The only meeting of Primitive Friends in 1936 was in the State of Pennsylvania,
a rural church which reported a membership of 14, comprising 6 males and 8
females, all of whom were reported as "13 years of age and over."
In this branch of the Society of Friends, as in all the others, the membership
consists of those who are enrolled by the local meeting, including both "birthright"
members, who are enrolled because their parents were members, and those whe>
have joined upon application.
There was no debt on the church edifice reported, and there was no parsonage
or Sunday school.
Comparative data, 1906-36.-The following table presents, in convenient form
for comparison, the available statistics of this body for the census years 1936,
1926, 1916, and 1906.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
DENOMINATIONAL HISTORY
The Primitive Friends withdrew from the Wilburite body because of the failure
of that branch to bear what seemed to them practical testimony against the
modified and modernized beliefs and practices introduced into the Society of
Friends during the middle and latter part of the nineteenth century. Their
chief interest is to "maintain the ancient testimonies of the society" intact, with
the idea of bearing witness to the spirituality of the Gospel.
The general Meeting of Men and Women Friends (Primitive) of Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Delaware, etc., was organized in the year 1861, at Fallsington, Pa.
This was organized by a few members of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting who
were not satisfied with what they considered the Unitarian tendency of Elias
Hicks, about 1828, and the influence of the Church of England upon Joseph
John Gurney, who came to America in 1845.
This society was composed of three monthly meetings, namely, Philadelphia,
Falls Monthly Meeting of Men and Women Friends, and Nottingham and
Little Britain monthly meetings, which met quarterly at Philadelphia and twice
a year at Fallsington.
One by one the monthly meetings have been laid down, until, at the present
time, Falls Monthly is the only survivor. This general meeting has been affiliated
with a small meeting held at Fritchley, England, and also with Friends at Poplar
Ridge, N.Y., and Newport, R.I.
1 This statement, which is substantially the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, ha.• been revised by Charles Henry Moon, clerk of Falls Monthly Mooting, Woodbourne, Pa.,
and approved by him in Its present form.

parison, a summary of the available statistics of the Holiness Church for the cen-
sus years 1936, 1926, and 1916.
The decrease shown between 1926 and 1936 in this denomination is due, in part,
to the fact that these self-directing local churches frequently merge with congre-
gations of like doctrine or organization.

About 1880 Rev. Hardin Wallace, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, accompanied by James J. A. Singer, of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
and Henry Ashcroft, a minister of the Free Methodist Church, went through the
southern part of California preaching repentance and forgiveness of sins, or justi-
fication by faith, of the sinner; and, for believers, sanctification or heart purity,
which also might be received by faith and subsequent to regeneration or justifi-
cation. A considerable number of persons followed his line of teaching, and
numerous bands were formed under the name "Holiness Band," the members
retaining, however, their membership or identity with the churches of which they
were already members. Also many new converts joined, who had had no church
connection.
I This statement, which Is the same as that published in vol. II of the Report on Religious Bodies, 1926,
has been approved in its present form by James R. Adams, president of the Holiness Church, El Monte,
CaiU.
DigitiZed by GoogIe
726 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
With the development of these bands and the acquisition of property for the
conduct of their worship, certain legal difficulties arose, and in 1896 they became
incorporated under the laws of the State of California.
From California the work extended into other States and was especially promi-
nent in Kentucky and Tennessee. The churches in Tennessee constitute a dis-
trict assembly of the entire body, but the churches in Kentucky are included in
the corporate body of California.
DOCTRINE
The doctrine of the Holiness Church is Methodist or Wesleyan, following the
principles laid down by John Wesley. It teaches repentance, restitution, con-
fession, and the forsaking of sin, as the part for the sinner; and the forgiveness
of sin and the divine light received by the repentant sinner, as the part from God.
The church teaches that it is the privilege as well as the duty of every believer
to consecrate himself to God without reserve and that the result of such conse-
cration will be sanctification, meaning by that term freedom from the "carnal
mind" and the tendency to sin. Specific conditions of church membership are
baptism by water (the mode being chosen by the candidate) and sanctification.
The church also emphasizes belief in prohibition, abstinence from drugs and
tobacco, and from all poisons that are "against the best for God"; also belief in
the second coming of Christ, and divine healing by faith. Divorce is allowed for
but one cause, adultery; membership in secret societies is disapproved and for-
bidden; and plain dress, avoiding extravagance and the use of jewelry, especially
for show, is inculcated.
ORGANIZATION
Local churches are self-directing, but there is a board of 12 elders who care for
the spiritual welfare of the church and serve between the meetings of the assem-
bly. There is, in addition, a board of nine trustees, whose office it is to look after
the properties of the church and who hold that property subject to the General
Assembly, which is composed of representatives from the churches. District
assemblies are formed under the care of superintendents who are members of the
board of elders of the General Assembly, but who have also their own official
board which transacts the business pertaining to the district and handles its
property without special voice of the General Assembly. Ministers are selected
on their qualifications, upon examination by the church. For those holding per-
manent credentials there is a regular form of ordination. Those having pastorates
are looked upon as leaders rather than dictators, no fixed salaries are paid, and
as many of the congregations are small and unable to pay a minister, they are
frequently obliged to take other work for the support of their families.
WORK
The Holiness Church is missionary in spirit and evangelistic in practice, carrying
on its activities largely by freewill offerings of the churches, there being no tax-
ation or assessment.

Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 2 presents, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of Independent Churches for the
census years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906.
This group represents a constantly shifting number of organizations. A most
important change, as affecting the comparability of the figures, is the fact
that the denominational federated churches, which were formerly included in
Independent Churches, are in 1926 and 1936 shown as a separate group, comprising
361 churches and 508 churches respectively.

Under this head are presented those single churches which are not identified
with any ecclesiastical body and have not even such affiliation as would entitle
them to inclusion under a special name. Although any general classification is
im~racticable, through the several censuses certain distinct types have p~rsisted.
The first class embraces those churches variously called union, community,
nondenominational, and interdenominational. These represent the growing
movement toward nonsectarian unity and the consolidation of church work to
eliminate weak churches and the waste of duplicated effort in overchurched
localities, and they also show a trend toward churches which serve the religious
and social needs of the entire community, regardless of its specific creedal beliefs,
and emphasize social righteousness rather than individual salvation. In the
current census all churches of this class which have any ecclesiastical affiliation
734 CENSUS! OF RELIGIOUS BODIIES, 19 3 6
are shown with their respective denominations, while the federated churches,
formerly included with the independent churches, are presented as a separate
group. Community churches and nondenominational churches together com-
prise nearly one-half of the number of so-called independent churches, while
about one-fifth of the whole report themselves as union or interdenominational
churches. Of these latter, "Union" may be simply a part of the name and have
no other significance, or the term may be historic and suggest a former denomina-
tional connection. Interdenominational churches, as included in this group, are
those having organic unity in which the several denominations represented have
fully merged their individuality.
The second class includes churches which use a denominational name, but for
one reason or another are not included in denominational lists and are not
reported by the denominational officers. In the past a number of Lutheran
churches were so listed because not included in the synodical returns, but the
Lutheran bodies, as a part of the larger movement toward union, now report both
synodical and nonsynodical churches. Among other bodies it occasionally
happens that a Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregational, Methodist, Reformed, or
other church, for some reason-doctrinal, ecclesiastical, or geographical-is not
included in the lists of any association, presbytery, classis, or other body. In
some cases these have simply grown up dissociated from the ecclesiastical bodies,
and have preserved their independent status from habit rather than from differ-
ence of opinion. Not being included in the denominational returns, however,
they are classed as independent.
The third class includes churches which were organized by individuals inde-
pendent of any denominational status, some that originally had denominational
connection, and some which are the result of holiness or evangelistic movements.
With regard to all these classes it is to be noted that they represent a con-
stantly shifting number. In each class, occasionally, a church which is one year
reported as independent will in another year be reported as identified with some
ecclesiastical body. Others, lacking the support of some general body, drop out
of existence entirely or become consolidated with other churches. Classified
with the Independent Churches are several Christian Churches which did not
join the Congregational and Christian merger and now have no denominational
affiliation.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
The withdrawal from the list of Independent Churches of the denominational
federated churches has left a group for which no special features either of doctrine
or polity can be definitely stated. Each of the organizations included in this
report draws up its own creed, adopts its own form of organization, chooses its
own officers, makes its own conditions of membership, and conducts its own
worship as it chooses, and no general statement is practicable, except that the
union and interdenominational churches accord more or less closely to the cus-
toms of the denominations represented in their organizations.
While it is probable that most of the individual churches carry on the usual
programs of religious and social activities, no reports on these were received.

INDEPENDENT NEGRO CHURCHES
STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classi1lcation.-A general
summary of the statistics for the Independent Negro Churches for the year 1936
is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of these figures between
urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled from schedules sent
directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual churches and the
data relate to these churches only.
The qualifications for membership are those of the individual organizations and
cannot be defined for the whole group.
The Independent Negro Churches were not shown separately prior to 1936,
hence no comparative data are available.

State tables.-Tables 2, 3, and 4 present the statistics for 1936 for the Independ-
ent Negro Churches by States. Table 2 gives for each State the number and
membership of the churches classified according to their location in urban or rural
territory, membership classified by sex and age, and data for Sunday schools.
Table 3 shows the value of churches and parsonages and the amount of debt on
church edifices. Table 4 presents the church expenditures, showing separately
current expenses, improvements, benevolences, etc. In order to avoid disclosing
the financial statistics of any individual church, separate presentation in tables
3 and 4 is limited to those States in which three or more churches reported value
and expenditures.

1 Includes 2 churches in New York; and lin each of the following Stetes-IIIinois, Michigan, Maryland,
Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington.
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION
HISTORY
Churches which were reported without any denominational designation and
which were not included in any of the denominational lists received by the Census
Bureau are called independent churches. One group of these churches which use
denominational names, were either organized without any thought as to ecclesi-
astical connection, or had severed denominational ties which they formerly had.
The second group includes organizations which do not use denominational names
and which probably never have had any denominational affiliation. Some of
these churches are the result of movements, especially the spiritual movement
among Negroes. Both groups of independent churches are perhaps indicative of
the initiative of persons who have desired to become leaders of religious bodies,
and the inability or disinclination to conform to the practices of well-established
churches.
DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATION
Since each of the organizations included in this report draws up its own creed,
adopts its own form of organization, makes its own conditions of membership,
and conducts its own worship as it chooses, no general statement concerning
doctrine and organization is practicable.
Not any of the Negro independent churches supplied a statement relative to
"work"; however, it is known that some of the churches carry on well-planned
religious and social activities.

INTERNATIONAL CHURCH OF THE
FOURSQUARE GOSPEL
STATISTICS
Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classi1ication.-A general
summary of the statistics for the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel
for the year 1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the distribution of
these figures between urban and rural territory. These statistics were compiled
from schedules sent directly to the Bureau by the pastor or clerk of the individual
churches and the data relate to these churches only.
Members must possess such qualifications and furnish such evidence of spiritual
fitness as prescribed by the Board of Directors.
This body was not reported prior to 1936, hence no comparative data are
available.

744 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODIEIS, 1936
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
The great religious awakening which was coincident with the World War of
1914-18 resulted in America in a definite desire for a more personal knowledge of
God a.nd a closer communion in the Spirit.
From this yearning there has sprung a large number of so-called Full Gospel
movements, i. e., an earnest endeavor to reproduce the spirit of first century
Christianity in a church that was founded by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
at Pentecost, immediately following the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer.
To a large number of believers the most complete and satisfying expression of
this faith was that preached by Aimee Semple McPherson in a series of nation-
wide evangelistic tours, reaching from Maine to Florida and eventually across
the nation to Los Angeles. In her life history Sister McPherson, as she is known
to all of her churches, gives the following account of her early life.
Her birthplace was in a farmhouse in the Canadian Province of Ontario, some
5 miles distant from the town of Ingersol. She was an only child, and many of
the "homey" tasks fell to her lot. She rejoices in the fact that her idioms of
speech-which have given her message so wide an appeal-date back to the
early life on the farm.
During her girlhood, her conversion occurred under the preaching of the
evangelist, Robert Semple. Shortly afterward she married Robert Semple, and
the two were sent to Hong Kong to do missionary work among the Chinese, and
were housed most uncomfortably next to a Hindu Temple, the back yard of which
was used as a "burning ghat" where one day she saw the horrible sightofahuman
body being cremated. Robert Semple was, however, indefatigable and continued
his labors among the Chinese until they went down to the coast at Macae where
he was taken very seriously ill with malaria fever and carried back in this con-
dition to Hong Kong. He died a few weeks later at the Matilda Hospital and the
romance so happily begun ended in a newly turned grave in the Hong Kong
cemetery called Happy Valley.
Following this, Sister McPherson with her baby, who had been born a month
after the death of Robert Semple, returned to the United States. Soon she was
the victim of a serious illness, from which she was miraculously delivered with
the strong impression that God had commanded her to go forth to preach.
A long period of evangelism followed. The summer of 1917 was spent in
the East with camp meetings at Long Branch, N. J., and Huntington, N. Y.
Her second southern campaign extended from the northernmost town in Maine
to the southernmost city in Florida, with meetings in Virginia and Delaware.
In Philadelphia a gospel tent was purchased, a city of tents erected and a nation-
wide camp meeting, followed by a series of meetings extending from Massa-
chusetts to New York. The decision to come to California was made in Chicago.
The transcontinental gospel tour began in Tulsa with the conviction growing
upon Sister McPherson that God had summoned her to California for a special
purpose, a conviction which strengthened as sh~ approached the coast. The
family entered California at San Bernardino and proceeded at once to Los Angeles.
Almost her first congregation insisted in joining in the building of "the little
grey home in the West," of which she had dreamed, and soon she was perma-
nently settled in her new home.
Los AngelE's is widely known as the Athens of America; it is a city of accom-
plishment. It is populated with men and women who come here to spend their
declining days. A religion to appeal to them must contain factual elements
and be spoken by one who knows how to reach both the heart and the head.
Our evangelist preached this from the first, but when she added to this the final
revelation of the Foursquare faith, the enthusiasm of the city knew no bounds.
Angelus Temple.- The most important building of the denomination is Angelus
Temple which was dedicated on January I, 1923. With its twin structure, the
L. I. F. E. Bible College building, located on the shore of beautiful Echo Park
Lake in Los Angeles, it forms the most complete evangelistic unit on the continent.
From its crowded commissary where it is said that more than a million Americans
have been fed, through its auditoriums, classrooms, and prayer tower, it is a
great machine, a skillfully conducted vehicle for evangelism, education, and
charitable aid. It is thronged night and day.

INTERNATIONAL CHURCH OF THE FOURSQUARE GOSPEL 745
The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was incorporated in 1927.
Its headquarters are in the administration building, which also houses its principal
educational unit, L. I. F. E. Bible College. The meaning of this name is Light-
house of International Foursquare Evangelism.
This college has a faculty of 14 instructors and an enrollment of approximately
700 students. From these ranks are drawn the future pastors, evangelists, and
miBBionaries of the Foursquare organization.
Spreading from Los Angeles the International Church now claims 400 estab-
lished branch churches in practically all parts of the United States and Canada
and an important missionary movement which includes branches in China,
Philippine Islands, Belgian Congo, the Union of South Africa, Panama, Bolivia,
South America, Northern China, and Puerto Rico. About 200 local mission
stations are tributary to these stations. In Northern China and Luisa in the
Belgian Congo, Bible colleges have also been established with the intention of
creating an indigenous ministry among the natives.
One of the important features of the work is the radio station, KFSG, which
broadcasts from Los Angeles 6 days weekly. Application has recently been made
for the short-wave system and a new 235-foot tower erected on the roof of Angelus
Temple.
DOCTRINE
The doctrine of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel is published
in its "Declaration of Faith" compiled by Aimee Semple McPherson and is di-
vided into 21 paragraphs, including: The Holy Scriptures, the Eternal Godhead,
the fall of man, the plan of redemption, salvation through grace, repentance and
acceptance, the new birth, daily Christian living, baptism and the Lord's Supper,
the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit-filled life, the_gifts and fruits of the Spirit,
moderation, divine healing, the second coming of Christ, church relationship,
civil government, the final judgment, heaven, hell, and the spirit of evangelism.
Emphasis is laid upon the Deity as well as the perfect humanity of the Son of
God and the true divinity of the Holy Ghost, and maintaining that the canonical
Scriptures are true, immutable, steadfast, unchangeable as its author, the Lord
Jehovah.
The Eternal Godhead is accepted on a trinitarian basis, the work of the Holy
Spirit being defined as the "Spirit of the Father shed abroad, omnipotent, omni-
present, performing an inexpressibly important mission upon earth, convicting
of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, drawing sinners to the Savior, rebuking,
pleading, searching, comforting, guiding, quickening, teaching, glorifying, baptiz-
ing, and enduing with power from on high, them who yield to His tender ministra-
tions, preparing them for the great day of the Lord's appearing."
The fall of man is accepted and the plan of redemption is stated to be through
the atoning death of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary, "Who by divine appoint-
ment of the Father taking the sinner's place, bearing his sins, receiving his con-
demnation, dying his death, fully paying his penalty, and signing with His life's
blood, the pardon of every one who should believe upon Him; that upon simple
faith and acceptance of the atonement purchased on Mount Calvary the vilest
sinner may be cleansed of his iniquities and made whiter than the driven snow."
Salvation of the sinner is through grace, by "pleading the merits and the
righteousness of Christ the Savior, standing upon His word, and accepting the
free gift of His love and pardon."
The result is the new birth, the belief that the sinner is then born again in
such a glorious and transforming manner that old things are passed away and
all things are become new; insomuch that the things once most desired are now
abhorred.
The institutions of the baptism and the Lord's Supper are definitely accepted,
in addition to which the "Declaration of Faith" speaks of the baptism of the
Holy Spirit in the following language:
"We believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the incoming of the promised
Comforter in mighty and glorious fullneBB to endue the believer with power from
on high; to glorify and exalt the Lord Jesus; to give inspired utterance in witness-
ing of Him; to foster the spirit of prayer, holiness, sobriety; to equip the individual
and the church for practical, efficient, joyous, Spirit-filled soul-winning in the
fields of life; and that this being still the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, the
believer may have every reason to expect His incoming to be after the same
manner as that in which He came upon Jew and gentile alike in Bible days."
A second important tenet is divine healing described as follows:
"\Ve believe that divine healing is the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to heal
the sick and the afflicted in answer to believing prayer; that He who is the same
. . . . . ill!
746 CENSUS OF RELIGIOUS BODmB, 19 3 6
yesterday, today, and forever has never changed but is still an all-sufficient help
in the time of trouble, able to meet the needs of and quicken into newness of
life the body, as well as the soul and spirit in answer to the faith of them who
ever pray with submission to His divine and sovereign will."
The second coming of Christ in clouds of glory is fully accepted as also the
obligations of church relationship and of obedience to the civil government.
ORGANIZATION
The organization is declared to be for the purpose of the propagation of the
Foursquare Gospel as presented in the Declaration of Faith compiled by Aimee
Semple McPherson.
The principal place of business is in the city of Los Angeles, Calif. The mem-
bership of the corporation and those entitled to vote at the General Assembly are
the officers of the corporation and ordained ministers who are pastors of chartered
churches, and other ordained and licensed ministers and evangelists who are ap-
proved by the board of directors and 1 delegate for each 100 members of a branch
church or a fraction thereof. An annual meeting of the General Assembly is held
in January of each year.
The trustees or board of directors consist of five members. The office of presi-
dent is held by Aimee Semple McPherson during her lifetime. The power of the
board of directors includes the right to manage the business and affairs of the
corporation. Two meetings monthly are held. The board appoints five field
supervisors who are given charge of the five districts into which the work of the
International Church of the Foursquare Gospel branch churches is divided. These
include the California district, the Northwest district, the Midwest district, the
Great Lakes district, and the Canadian division.
The Ordination Board and Missionary Board are two groups including the di-
rectors of this corporation, the dean of the Bible college, and such other persona
not exceeding two as the president shall appoint, whose duty and power is to ex-
amine into the qualifications and fitness of applicants desiring admission to the
ministry, licensed evangelists, and workers of this church.
The missionary work is under the direction of a missionary board consisting of
the president of the corporation, the International Board, and the field super-
visors, who meet semiannually or by special order of the president.
Branch churches.-Branch churches are organized throughout the United
States and Canada and number approximately 400 at this time. Members must
possess such qualifications and furnish such evidence of spiritual fitness as may
be prescribed by the board of directors. Each member must subscribe to and
adhere to the doctrine of the Foursquare Gospel as outlined in the Declaration
of Faith compiled by Aimee Semple McPherson; members shall be received by the
pastor of any branch church once each month, and are examined prior to admission
by the pastor and must show evidence satisfactory to the pastor of a genuine born-
again experience of salvation and godly Christian life. Members at all times are
requested to conduct themselves in accordance with the standards of Christian
living and with the rules and regulations of the corporation.
Branch churches are governed by a church council, which consists of the pastor,
who is ex officio the chairman thereof, and either four or six members elected by
the membership of the church at the annual or organization meeting of the church
membership.
Each branch church contributes one offering each month, taken preferably on
the third Sunday of the month, for the home and foreign missionary work of this
corporation.
Crusader movement.-The young people are organized in a youth movement
known as the Foursquare Crusaders, represented by groups in practically every
church. Membership to this organization requires the signing of the covenant,
which is a pledge to a consecrated life. The organization of bands is encouraged
in each group and frequent rallies are held in all parts of the United States.
Uniform.-The organization is uniformed, including full regulation dress for
women, which consists of a white dress, blue cape, and black tie.
The distinguishing insignia is an open Bible with the figure "4" enclosed in a
square. The Crusader organization adds to this a triangular shield.
Flag.-The flag adopted by the church has the colors of the Tabernacle-
red, yellow, blue, and purple--with the red cross on a white ground with a blue
square on which the figure "4" is prominently displayed in gold.
Music.-Band music is a feature of all Foursquare work. The hymns of the
denomination include many marches written by Sister McPherson and possess
distinctive joyous notes.

HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
The Pentecostal movement was started some 32 years ago by a group of Ital-
ians who were converted in an American church in Chicago. The movement
grew rapidly and today there are some 200 little missions and assemblies through-
out the United States. There are 100 or more throughout Italy, and over 60
accounted for in South America in the Italian tongue.
For this reason Rev. Rocco Santamaria and his father, Rev. John Santamaria,
with the cooperation of Rev. Pietro Giordano, conceived the idea of forming a
council similar to the American one to try and unite all these little groups.
It is now 3 years since this council was started. We already have about 25
churches affiliated together. It is hard work to try to merge them. As a rule
the majority do not believe in organization, but with the help of God some day
we will succeed.
The General Council of the Italian Pentecostal Assemblies of God is governed
by an executive board and a board of presbyters. We have checked up and have
up to date 17 ordained ministers, 20 licensed ministers, 6 who have exhorters'
papers, and 23 Christian workers.
The General Council also publishes a monthly paper called "Fede, Speranza,
Carita" (Faith, Hope, Charity). This paper is published with the money re-
ceived by voluntary offerings from the various assemblies. We have also a yearly
subscription of $1 for whoever wishes to subscribe for it.
t This statement was furnished by Rev. Rocco R. Santamaria, general superintendent, General Council
of the Italian Pentecostal Assemblies of God, Newark, N.J.

ITALIAN PRNTECOSTAL ASSIEMBLIES OF GOD 751
DOCTRINE
We believe in the Almighty God, that He is a Spirit, Omnipotent, Omniscient,
Omnipresent, that He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. We
believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died for our sins, that He is
coming again on earth. We believe the Holy Bible to be the inspired word of
God written by godly men who were so moved by the Spirit of God. We believe
in the speaking in tongues as quoted in the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
chapter 2, verse 4. We believe in the gifts given to the church as written in I Cor.,
chapter 13. We believe there is a place of punishment for the wicked when they
die, that there is an eternal resting place for the godly and that after death on
earth the good shall always be with God in a place described as heaven. We
believe in clean morals-worldly amusements have no part in our churches; the
church is the place to worship God and not to preach politics. We believe
America is the land for Americans and all people should believe and have faith
in our Government and uphold the Constitution of the United States, and we
also believe in saluting the flag of the United States of America. We believe in
the Holy Supper observed by the breaking of the bread and drinking of the wine
celebrated in church every time seen fit to do it. We believe in the baptism of
water by immersion and that when a person receives the baptism of water he
should be of an age to understand its meaning. We do not believe in infant
baptism. Lastly, we believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit given as a gift to
all believers by God, and that the speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance
is a sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. We are against fascism, nazism,
bolshevism, communism, and socialism. We shun all forms of idolatry and be-
lieve in one God in three divine persons-the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost.

Summary for the United States, with urban-rural classification.-A general
summary of the statistics for The Unorganized Italian Christian Churches of
North America for the year 1936 is presented in table 1, which shows also the
distribution of these figures between urban and rural territory. These statistics

UNORGANIZED 'ITALIAN CHRISTIAN CHURCHES OF N. A. 755
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
This church was founded in 1907 by Louis Francescon in Chicago, Ill., who
under divine guidance was called upon to work in the Lord's work. The church
is nondenominational and nonsectarian. Mr. Francescon was directed by God
to spread the gospel in the United States, mostly to the Italian people. This work
has spread not only throughout the length and breadth of the United States and
Canada but also to Italy, Brazil, and Argentina. The various churches in the
United States are incorporated locally under State laws as separate congregations.
Each congregation is a separate entity and authority is vested in elders, deacons,
and trustees as the law may require in the various States. However, the church
in Italy is comhined into one corporation named "Congregazione Cristiana"
(Christian Congregation).
In Brazil the various congregations are grouped into one corporation known as
"Congregac~W Christ' do Brasil" (Christian Congregation of Brazil).
The "Congregazione Cristiana," Chicago, Ill., is the mother church. Mr.
Francescon is senior elder and missionary. Active missionary work has been
carried on in the United States and abroad by Mr. Francescon since the beginning.
In April 1927 a convention of the various congregations was held in Niagara
Falls, N. Y., and articles of faith were adopted. Briefly stated they are: We
believe that the Bible is the infallible word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit;
there is one only living and true God, eternal, with unlimited powers, Creator
of all things, and in one God are three distinct persons: The Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit; that the Son of God is the Word, made flesh, who in reality suffered
death, not only for the primitive transgression, but also for the actual sins of
man; in the existence of a personal devil, who, with all evil spirits, will be eternally
punished in the lake of fire; that regeneration or the new birth is received only
through faith in Christ Jesus who was delivered for our trespasses and was raised
for our justification; in water baptism by single immersion; in the baptism of
the Holy Spirit as an experience received subsequent to salvation, with the
sign of ~peaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance; in the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper; that it is necessary to abstain from things offered to idols, from
blood, from things strangled, and from fornication, as decreed by the Holy
Spirit in the General Assembly held at Jerusalem; that Jesus Christ, Himself,
bore our infirmities, and therefore we obey the following commandment: "Is
there any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let
them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if he has
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him"; that the Lord, Himself (before the
millennium), shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the arch-
angel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, then
we that are alive that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds,
to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord; there shall
be a bodily resurrection of all dead, just and unjust, and these shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.
• This statement was prepared from information furnished by Mr. Louis Francesoon, senior elder and
missionary or The Unorganized Italian Christian Churches or North America, Chicago, ill.

Comparative data, 1906-36.-Table 2 presents, in convenient form for com-
parison, a summary of the available statistics of the Jewish congregations for
the census years 1936, 1926, 1916, and 1906. In 1906 the membership included
heads of families and a small number of persons known as "seat holders"; in
both of these classes the person counted was frequently representative of a whole
household. The figures given for 1916 included other contributors besides the
seat holders, but the figures were admittedly incomplete, since there were known
to be 282 organizations that made no report of members. The figures given for
1926 and 1936 included all persons of the Jewish faith residing in communities
where there was a congregation. The number and percentage of increase between
1916 and 1926 are not given in table 2, therefore, as the figures are not comparable.

JEWISH CO·NG'REGATIONS
HISTORY, DOCTRINE, AND ORGANIZATION 1
HISTORY
763
There were Jews in the ()riginal colonies before 1650. In New York, then New
Amsterdam, there were Jews in 1654, and in the fall of that year a company of
Jewish refugees arrived from Bra.zil, who settled in the colon·y. Although the
Dutch authorities of New Amsterdam favored the Calvinist church and did not
permit persons of other faiths to hold public assemblies, the Jews established their
worship upon their arrival in the town, the population of which then numbered
only about 800 persons. Like other residents of dissident faiths, the Jews gath-
ered among themselves according to their opportunities, in their own homes or
in a hired room, beginning to do so as soon as there were enough persons to hold
public worship. In July 1655 they applied to the authorities for a plot for
a cemeter_y. With the granting of this application, in 1656, the Congregation
Sheerith Israel (Remnant of Israel), the first Jewish congregation in North
America, entered upon· its career as an institution. Its first minister was one
named Saul Brown (originally Moreno, Spanish for Brown), who came to the
congregation from Newport, R. 1., and he officiated in the synagogue regularly.
He died in the year 1682, at which time the congregation was occupying a rented
building on Mill Street, now South William Street.
Other Jewish communities were formed in Newport, R.I. (1658); in Savannah,
Ga., Jews having been in the company which came with Oglethorpe; in Charles-
ton, S. C.; in Philadelphia, Pa.; and in Richmond, Va.; all in colonial times. In
1850 there were 77 Jewish congregations, located in 21 of the then 31 States of the
Union. In 1877 there were at least 277 congregations in the country and 230,000
Jews; i'n 1890, 533 congregations and probably 475,000 Jews; in 1906, 1,700
congregations and about 1,775,000 Jews; in 1916, 1,900 congregations and about
3,300,000 Jews; in 1926, 3,118 permanent congregations and 4,081,000 Jews; and
in 1936, 3,728 congregations and 4,641,184 Jews residing in the cities, towns, and
villages in which the congregations were located.
DOCTRINE
The Jewish religion is a way of life. and has no formulated creed, or articles of
faith, the acceptance of which brings redemption or salvation to the believer, or
divergence from which involves separation from the Jewish congregation. On
the other hand, it has certain teachings, sometimes called doctrines or dogmas,
which have been at all times considered obligatory on the adherents of the Jewish
religion.
The unity of God.-The fundamental doctrine of the Jewish religion is that
God is One. At all times the religion of the Jew vigorously protested against
any infringement of this dogma of pure monotheism, whether by the dualism of
the East or by the Trinitarianism of the West. It never permitted the attributes
of justice and of love to divide the Godhead into different powers or personalities.
God is a Spirit without limitations of form, eternal, noncorporeal, unique, omnis-
cient, ommpotent, and one. "Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is
One" is the declaration of faith which the Jew pronounces daily and breathes it
even in his hour of death. God is the Creator of the world. He is also the
preserver of the world, its ruler, and the arbiter of its destiny. He was God from
the very beginning, and the worship of other gods is a rebellion against the
universal God beside whom there is no other. "Look unto Me, and be ye saved,
all the ends of the earth; for I am God and there is none else" (Isaiah, xlv, 22).
He is the God of righteousness, mercy, love, and holiness; the ideal of moral
perfection. God is "our Father, our Redeemer for everlasting" (Isaiah, lxiii, 16);
He is not remote· from mortal man in his need, but He is rather, as Jewish sages
have put it, "near, nearer than any other help or sympathy can be," who "appears
to each according to his capacity or temporary need.' A Jew cannot compromise
with idolatry or polytheism; indeed he is enjoined to give his life rather than to
renounce the purity of his religion.
The world and man.-The world is a cosmic unit and it is good. The Holy
One created and sustains the earth and the heaven, light and darkness, life and
death; and the world is ruled by everlasting wisdom and kindness. There is
no cosmic force for evil, no principle of evil in creation. There is no inherent
impurity in the flesh or in matter, and man is not subject to Satan. There is
1 'This statement, which Is substantially the same as that published In vol. II or the Report on Religious
Bodies, 1926, was furnished by Dr. H. s. Linfield, director or the 1ewish Statistical Bureau, New York
City.
764 CENSIUS• OF IliE!LIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
no original sin; sin is the erring from the right path. The crown and the acme of
God's creation is· man. He is capable of perfection without the aid of an extra-
neous being, and, being born free, is able to choose between good and evil, and is
endowed with intelligence; "God created man in His own image" and made him
"but little lower than the angels." From one man did all the races of the earth
descend, and thus they constitute one family. This doctrine of the unity of the
human family is a corollary of the doctrine of the unity of God. The One God
is in direct relation with man, all men, there being no mediator between God
and man, and all men may attain to immortality through following the good life;
for immortality, the Jewish religion teaches, is the reward of human righteousness.
There is in this respect no distinction between its own adherents and those of
other faiths. As one ancient teacher exclaims: "I call heaven and earth to witness
that whether it be Jew or gentile, man or woman, manservant or maidservant,
according to their acts does the divine spirit rest upon them."
The future of mankind and Israel.-The perfection of humanity through the
unfolding of the divine powers in man is the aim of history. There is to be a
divine kingdom of truth and righteousness on this earth. Daily the Jew concludes
his_prayers by declaring his hope to behold speedily the time when God, in the glory
of His might, will be manifested, and the abominations will be removed from the
earth and idolatry utterly cut off, and He will perfect the world as the kingdom
of the Almighty, and all flesh will call upon His name. This kingdom is the hope
of mankind and the goal toward which it is striving. Whether or not this universal
kingdom of God will be preceded by the day of God or by a universal judgment
when "all that work wickedness shall be stubble," Jewish religion teaches the
coming on this earth of a social order of human perfection and bliss, of peace
without end, when none shall hurt or destroy, and when the earth shall be full
of the knowledge of the Lord (Isaiah chapters ix, xi); this is the Messianic era.
Israel is a unique people that shall never cease (Jeremiah xxxi, 36). It is not
claimed that this people is better than others or that it possesses a special share of
the divine love; but it is affirmed, and the Jew daily declares this faith in his
prayers, that God has brought them near to His great name, to give thanks unto
Him, and to proclaim His unity. In this sense Israel is called a "kingdom of
priests and a holy nation" (Exodus xix, 6), selected or assigned by God for His
special purpose. Because of this duty they are taken to task more severely than
others: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will
visit upon you all your iniquities" (Amos iii, 2). It is a widespread Jewish inter-
pretation that the Servant of the Lord described in Isaiah refers not to an indi-
vidual but to the Jewish people as a group. Israel is God's witness (Isaiah xli-
xliii), testifying to His existence and His unity. The duty of Israel, its imperish-
ability and restoration (Deuteronomy xxx, 1-4) and the blessed future that awaits
mankind, are doctrines of the Jewish religion.
The Law.-The belief in the unity of God, in the future hope of the world, and
in the other doctrines is of no value unless one lives in accordance with the require-
ments of the beliefs. The emphasis is not on belief, but on righteous conduct.
What is required is service of the Lord, a just system of human conduct in accord-
ance with statutes and ordinances, "which if a man do, he shall live by them."
The duty of man, created in the image of God, is to order his life entirely in
accordance with the will of God, and only by so doing can he attain perfection and
fulfill his destiny. And what does God desire of man? That was definitely con-
veyed to him. Already the first man, Adam, had received divine revelation for
his conduct and for that of his descendants; others followed, until Moses received
the full revelation, all the commandments and the statutes and the ordinances,
which should govern the life of man and lead him to moral and religious perfection.
This revelation, as contained in the Five Books of Moses, constitutes the Law of
Moses, the Law, the Torah, the Written Law, and it must be understood in the
light of Jewish tradition, the Oral Law. This Torah of divine origin, which will
not be changed, is the foundation of the Jewish faith; and that the Jew must
order his life ion accordance with the Torah has always been a basic principle of the
Jewish religion. To fear God and to keep His commandments is the whole duty
of man.
The Torah, written and oral, preeminently emphasizes the principle of justice;
llther principles stressed are purity and truth, optimism and hope, joy and thanks-
giving, holiness and the love of God. Righteousness and compassionate love are
demanded for the fatherless, the widow, the oppressed, the stranger, and even the
criminal; charity is zedakah, justice to the needy; and compassion is required even
for the dumb animal. Further, a man's life must be permeated by purity of heart
and built on truth. For, "the seal of the Holy One is truth" and "upon truth
rests the world." Hope and optimism are other requirements, and hope is but
DigitiZed by GoogIe
JEWISH OONGREGATFONIS 765
rarely deferred to the world to come, but a man must rather wait for the moral and
spiritual advancement of mankind in this world. At times this world is declared
to be "like a vestibule in which one prepares for the palace," nevertheless, "one
hour devoted to repentance and ~ood deeds in this world is more valuable than the
entire life of the world to come. ' A man should "rejoice before the Lord" and
p-atefully enjoy his gifts and fill other hearts with joy and thanksgiving; ascetism
Is discouraged. The whole life of man is holy, for the "Lord our God is holy,"
and man's life should be motivated by the love of God. Twice daily a Jew recites
the Shema', a declaration which contains the words "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might." It implies
the purest motives for action, specifically serving the Lord, not from fear but
rather out of love and for the sake of God and the glorification of His name; the
doing of good, not in view of any reward, but for its own sake; and the love of
man and the most unselfish devotion and the willing surrender of one's life itself
whenever the cause of God demands.
Other fundamental teachings of the law, written and oral, are freedom of will
and human responsibility, divine providence, retribution, resurrection of the dead,
the power of repentance and of prayer. Man is free, the choice between good and
evil having been left to him as a participant of God's spirit; man is responsible for
his own actions. In close relation with the doctrine of divine providence stands
that of retribution-that God rewards the righteous and punishes transgressors.
The doctrine of the soul's immortality and of a future life in which retribution
shall take place is plainly set forth in the Talmud, and the belief in the resurrection
of the dead is closely connected with the doctrines of immortality and of retribu-
tion in the hereafter. Emphasis is laid on the power of repentance to avert from
man the evil which threatens and to procure for him God's grace, and on the effi-
cacy of the prayer "of all that call upon Him in truth." There is no need for any
mediator when one prays to God, "for the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon
Him." He hears great and small alike.
The Torah emphasizes the need of study and education. It imposes a duty upon
every father to instruct his children and upon the community to provide for the
general instruction of old and young. The law sanctifies labor and makes the
teaching of a trade whereby one may earn his living a duty upon the father and
upon the communal authorities. Each man is enjoined to build a home and to
contribute to the welfare of human society; celibacy, except under rare circum-
stances, is unlawful. Systematic care of the poor is a duty of a community.
Love of one's country and loyalty to his government is enjoined upon every Jew,
and he is solemnly adjured to seek the peace of his country and to pray for the
welfare of its government.
Side by side with these universal principles of conduct the Torah surrounds
the Jewish people with numerous laws and rites. Some laws, also called testi-
monies, have been given to make Israel testify to God's miraculous guidance, such
as the festive seasons of the year; others, called signs, are tokens of the covenant
between God and Israel, such as circumcision and the Sabbath; and still others,
also called statutes, are divine marks of distinction-special means to preserve
Israel and its group life. The covenant at Sinai made Israel a society "of priests
and a holy nation" and laws were given to them designed to preserve the priestly
character of the nation. Some of these appeal to the human reason while others
do not, but even those which human intelligence is unable to grasp, are, through
belief in their divine origin, vouchsafed the same high religious importance.
Judaism is bound up with the Jewish people. "Ye shall be holy unto Me; for
I the Lord am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be
Mine" (Leviticus xx, 26). These particularistic religious obligations of the
Torah, written and oral, enabled the small Jewish people to resist the disintegrat-
ing forces of the idolatry and error which surrounded them, and encouraged the
Jews to live by the principle, ascribed by the early rabbis to Abraham, "let all
the world stand on the one side; I side with God and shall win in the end." The
laws gave the Jews the strength to withstand the persecutions of the nations and
the vicissitudes of time, and to fight for the truth amidst a hostile world. The
Jewish religion knows of no sacraments, in the sense of rites by which a person is
brought in bodily relationship to God; but the whole life of the Jew, even his
commonest acts, are invested with religious obligations and meanings, and they
are regarded as a sign of merit; as the rabbis have put it, "The Holy One, blessed
be He, was pleased to bestow merit upon Israel and therefore heaped upon them
laws and commandments." A pious man is "eager in the pursuit of religious
obligations" and they fill the life of the Jew with a higher joy.
The Jewish religion in its relation to other faiths.-The Jewish religion enjoins
upon its adherents the application of one law for Jew and members of other faiths,
766 CEN'SIUS• OF l~LIGlOUS BODIES, 1936
home-born or stranger; "Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger
as for the home-born" (Numbers xxiv, 22). The harsh expressions found some-
times in ancient Jewish lore, concerning the heathen and the laws against him,
are directed against the moral depravity ascribed to the heathen because of his
unchastity and violence; he is always under grave suspicion of immoral conduct.
The Jewish religion recognizes two classes of proselytes-"a proselyte of the
gate" is one who abandons idolatry and accepts instead the seven Noachian laws
of humanity, while "a proselyte of righteousness" is one who submits to the
Abrahamic rite and becomes a full member of the House of Israel. No distinction
whatever is drawn between a born Jew and a proselyte of righteousness. In
former centuries, the Jews carried on an extensive proselytizing propaganda; later
the world conditions prevented it. But whether as a result of that interference
or not, proselytizing activities have since been neglected. In the fullness of time,
however, the prophetic promises of the universal recognition of God will be ful-
filled, and as the Jew expresses it in his prayers on New Year's Day, "God will
reign in His glory over the whole universe and all the living shall say, the Lord,
God of Israel, is King, and His kingdom ruleth over all."2
ORGANIZATION
The polity of the Jewish congregations is characterized by the independence
which the individual congregations enjoy. There is no synod, conference, as-
sembly, hierarchy, or other organization which directly controls the ritual and
synagogal customs of the congregation or its organization; nor do the Jewish
congregations feel the need of anyi· all congregations teach the doctrines of the
faith, accept the inspiration of the aw, and hold to the unity of Israel.
Due to the fact that the Jews in the United States came from many countries,
some congregations differ slightly from others in the version of their prayer book
and synagogal customs-(nuasah=version, or minhag=custom)-and also in
matters of polity. One important group of congregations uses a prayer book
designated as of "German version" and follows the synagogal customs that go
with it (Congregation So and So nussah Ashkenaz), and another important group
uses a prayer book known as of "Spanish version" (Congregation So and So
nussah Sefarad) . The great majority of the latter group are known also as hasidic
congregations. There are also others, like Spanish-Portuguese congregations
(Congregation So and So Portuguese minhag). These are sometimes designated
as orthodox congregations, to distinguish them from others known as conservative
congregations or as reform (or liberal, or progressive) congregations. The
conservative congregations, which as a rule use the "German version," are at
other times classed with the orthodox congregations as distinguished from the
reform congregations, whose version of the book of common prayer was once
known as "American custom" ("minhag America"), but which is now known as
the Union Prayer Book. These divisions are old. In the first Americen Jewish
directory of congregations, published in 1854, 41 congregations reported the rite
in use. Of these 19 described themselves as of German nussah, 12 Polish (Sep-
hardic) minhag, 7 Portuguese minhag, I Bohemian minhag, and 2 were designated
as Netherland or Dutch congregations. Congregations further differ in the use of
Hebrew and of the vernacular in the prayers and in the sermon. All congregations
use Hebrew in their prayers; but numerous congregations make extensive use of
English, while still others use little or none at all. As for the sermon, in some
congregations the rabbis preach in English only; in other congregations, in English
on some occasions and in other vernaculars, specifically Yiddish-a dialect of
German with a large admixture of Hebrew words-on other occasions; while in
still others, whose congregants are mostly immigrants, the rabbis preach solely
in Yiddish or other vernaculars best understood by the congregants. The con-
gregations differ also in the use of music in the services. Some congregations
abstain from the use of instrumental music, regarding the latter as unlawful in
synagogal services. Such congregations often have choirs of men, but not of
women; others admit women to their choirs. To pray in the synagogues with
covered heads is regarded as a synagogal custom by the great majority of the
congregations, but some congregations pray with uncovered heads. Another
point of difference is that of the seating of women side by side with men in the

auditoriums; most congregations seat their women worshipers in a separate part
of the halls of the synagogues. These differences, however, do not divide Israel.
All congregations are as one in the chief doctrines of the faith and its observances;
and thus, although the reform congregations deny the validity of the Holy Scrip-
tures or any book whatever as a final authority in religion, there has been nothing
in the nature of a schism in Israel; there is no established synagogue, and all are
animated with a strong loyalty to the common cause of Judaism. In 1936 the
3,728 congregations represented Portuguese minhag, German nussah, Spanish
nusaah, orthodox, conservative, reform, and others, all established to serve the
religious needs of the 4,641,184 Jews living in places in which the congregations
were located.
A congregation consists of a number of corporate members. New congrega-
tions are formed when some public-spirited and zealous Jews of a. neighborhood
reali:l:e that the need for a congregation exists and, being able to bear its financial
and other responsibilities, organize one for the neighborhood or the town. To
join a congregation is not a matter of salvation; but it gives a Jew an op~ortunity
to serve his community, imposes upon him fiscal and other responsibilities, and
confers upon him certain privileges and advantages which the institution offers
to members. There are no examinations for membership. But those congrega-
tions every one of whose members is a strict observer of the Sabbath will not
admit Jews who are not such; and no congregation will admit to membership
one who is not a Jew of unimpeachable character. Married women and un-
married children are not, as a rule, members of a congregation in their own name,
but they enjoy the privileges of the institution by reason of the membership
of the husbands or fathers. A woman or unmarried son, who is prominent
because of her or his public spirit or zeal or financial standing and who is able to
serve the community, is often a corporate member in her or his own name. Some
Jews, while they are not corporate members of their neighborhood congrega-
tion, are pew holders; through purchase or inheritance they acquire a !seat in
the synagogue and this entitles them to certain privileges, imposes upon them
responsibilities, and offers them opportunities to serve their community. Others
are neither corporate members nor pew holders, but regular or occasional wor-
shipers with the congregation. Such worshipers and others, and in many con-
gregations also corporate members, pay for the use of a seat in the synagogue
during the High Holidays. With the exception of the High Holidays and certain
special occasions, admission to the services of the congregations is free, though the
use of its educational and other institutions may not be free. Corporate members,
pew holders, worshipers, and High Holiday seat holders, as a rule, make freewill
offerings for the support of the activities of the congregation in accordance with
their means. The corporate members are usually few in number, and theoretically
they are the only ones who control the property of the congregation and its
activities. In some congregations, however, seat holders and others participate
in the management of the congregation and its institutions; their actual manage-
ment, however, is vested as a rule in the officers or trustees and in committees.
Congregations sometimes combine to form city-wide federations for the pur-
pose of meeting certain particular needs, such as the maintenance of religious
schools. Again, many congregations are members of one of the three national
federations of synagogues-the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the
United Synagogue of America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations
of America. The first aims to meet certain needs of the congregations that
commonly go under the name of reform; the second serves the conservative
congregations, and the last, the orthodox congregations. In 1936 the combined
membership of the 3 unions was nearly 900 congregations out of a total of
3,728 congregations.
The Jewish ministry con11ists of rabbis, trained men who have received ordina-
tion from one or more known rabbis, and they are graduates of theological semi-
naries, or former fellows of theological academies. Sometimes a congregation
will accept one as its rabbi who lacks ordination or who is not a graduate of a
seminary, but the practice is becoming rare. American trained rabbis are gradu-
ates of theological seminaries, college graduates, and are fully ordained. In addi-
tion to the rabbis, many congregations, realizing the importance of the prayer
service in synagogal worship, engage a reader or a cantor (Hazan). The sexton,
too, occupies a more or less important position in the .Jewish congregation. But
it is the rabbi who is the teacher, preacher, and leader of his congregation; he
performs the office of the Jewish religious functionary, decides matters of Jewish
law and ritual, and guides his congregation or community.

WORK
The work of the Jewish congregations is inseparable from the work of the
Jewish community as a whole. It is the aim of the latter to care for the religious,
educational, charitable, and social needs of the Jews; and numerous organizations
exist for the purpose of serving as tools in meeting those needs. All these
organizations are voluntary and are supported by Jews as individuals and not
by central ecclesiastical organizations. It is not possible to speak of Jewish
congregational work in a way similar to that of the churches among other religious
bodies. The congregations perform some tasks and other Jewish organizations
perform other tasks, the totality of the results of which constitutes the life and
work of the Jewish community.
Worship and ritu.al.-The congregation is the chief organization of religion.
It supplies or seeks to supply adequate facilities for worship. During the past
decade, unlike former years, the facilities for Jewish worship kept pace with the
increase of the Jews of the country. Yet during the High Holidays the inade-
quacy of permanent buildings forces congregations to hire halls for overflow
meetings, and numerous benevolent organizations, and also private persons,
form High Holiday congregations and provisional synagogues. The promotion
of Sabbath and holiday observance is a field of activity which engages the con-
gregations and their functionaries, and there is also a national organization,
the Jewish Sabbath Alliance of America, devoted to this work. The solem-
nization of marriage is the work of functionaries of the congregations, especially
the rabbis. The latter also grant decrees of divorce in accordance with the
requirements of Jewish law, but only after a civil divorce has previously been
granted by the State courts. All ritual matters are the specific tasks of the
rabbis and their congregations; they reveal their interest in the important rituals
of circumcision and of ritual purity. The rabbis exercise supervision over the
slaughtet·ing of animals for food, and care for the distribution of kosher meat
and meat products in accordance with the religious requirements of the Jews.
A few States have laws making it a misdemeanor to sell non-kosher meat or meat
products, while falsely representing them as kosher; and this law, in the State
of New York, has been declared constitutionally valid by the Supreme Court
of the United States. Chaplaincy is another field of activity of the congregations
and their functionaries, though there are also special societies for service among
Jews in State institutions. Religious work among men of the Jewish faith in the
United States Army B-nd Navy is under the control of the Jewish Welfare Board,
a national organization which seeks to provide adequate opportunity for religious
worship and to assure the hospitality of Jewish communities adjacent to military
and naval posts, for Jews in the armed forces of the country. An important field
of activity of the congregations is the matter of the burial of Jews in accordance
with the requirements of the Jewish faith. As a rule, congregations own their
cemeteries or have cemetery societies, which offer facilities for the burial of mem-
bers, and also of nonmembers and of the poor. There are, however, numerous
cemetery associations not connected with congregations, cemeteries owned by
benevolent organizations, free burial societies, and also Jewish private burial
associations, all of which bury the dead in accordance with Jewish religious custom.
Finally, the rabbis of the congregations render decisions in religious matters and
also in Jewish communal matters in accordance with Jewish law, and a decision
of a known rabbi, or a group or a conference of rabbis, is accepted by Jews as
binding, in spite of the fact that the person or group which renders the decision
completely lacks the means of enforcing compliance.
The promotion of religious life in the .Jewish community is the work not only of
the individual congregation~ and their functionaries, but also of other organiza-
tions. These are especially the city·wide federations of congregations, the
national federations of congregations, the city-wide associations of rabbis wherever
they exist, the national federations of rabbis, and finally the Synagogue Council
of America which aims to further the religious interests which its constituent
organizations have in common. Its constituents are the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, the Union of Orthodox .Jewish Congregations of America,
and the United Synagogue of America; the Central Conference of American
Rabbis, the Rabbinical Assembly of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
and the Rabbinical Council of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congreg_ations of
America. One of the functions of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, it
may be added here, is to provide for relief of members, their widows, and orphans.
Broadly speaking, all Jewish organizations, whether engaged primarily in the
field of worship and ritual, of education and culture, or of charity and social work,
seek to further the religious life of the Jewish communities.

Education.-The religious education of the young is largely, but not wholly, in
the hands of the congregations. Numerically negligible are the Jewish parochial
schools (institutions where the children receive both their secular and religious
education). Jewish children attend the public schools and receive their religious
education in congregational schools, in communal schools belonging to noncon-
gregationalsocieties, in private schools, or through private instruction. A Jewish
private school, generally known as heder or beth-sefer, consists usually of a group of
children whose religious education is in the hands of a master; and a small congre-
gation, unable to maintain a congregational school, sometimes arranges for the
establishment of a heder on its premises. The congregational and communal
schools, generally known as (Bate) Talmud Torah, are comparatively large institu-
tions, offering instruction to many groups of children at one time. The private
and the communal schools are generally weekday schools, which as a rule require
attendance four times a week in after public school hours; but even among the
congregational schools the system of weekday instruction is well developed.
In 1936, 1,028 congregations reported 104,392 pupils in their Sabbath schools,
which offered religious instruction on Sundays only; 1,192 congregations reported
85,420 pupils in their weekday schools. The teachers in the weekday schools are
always professional persons who receive remuneration for their work, and this is
also the case in the Sabbath schools, as a rule. There are a number of schools in
the country for the preparation of teachers, the most noteworthy of which are
connected with the institutions for the training of rabbis.
In the city of New York and in other large cities the work of the schools is
promoted by organizations generally known as bureaus, or departments, or asso-
ciations of Jewish education, which render assistance to the individual schools in
pedagogic and administrative matters; engage in increasing the enrollment of
pupils; and, often extend financial assistance and control the individual schools.
The Jews aim to provide a Jewish education for every child and to create the means
to render the education offered adequate.
The congregations also extend educational and recreational facilities to adoles-
cents and adults through their young folks' societies; through congregational
study circles, generally known as hebrah's, which consist of groups of adults en-
gaged in the study of the Holy Scriptures, the Talmud, .Jewish history, etc.; and
through their "centers." The latter are similar to the noncongregational insti-
tutions commonly known as young men's or young women's Hebrew associations,
Jewish centers, Jewish educational alliances, Jewish or Hebrew institutes, which
care for the education and recreation of adults and serve the community in other
ways. These institutions enjoy the services of a national organization, the Jewish
Welfare Board, which stimulates the establishment of such organizations, assists
in their activities, and cooperates with them in the furtherance of Judaism and
good citizenship. In 1936, 305 young men's and youngwomen'sassociations and
kindred societies were constituent members of the national organization. Many
of the institutions for the recreation and the education of adults offer commercial
courses to young men and women. There is also a farm school, located in Bucks
County, Pa., for the preparation of Jewish boys for agricultural ~pursuits.
A number of Jewish societies, among them the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations,
seek through extra-curricular means to meet the religious and cultural needs of the
Jewish students that attend the colleges and universities. During the past
decade American Jews established, for the first time, in the city of New York, a
college offering a liberal education leading to the degree of bachelor of arts or of
science. A }>Ostgraduate institution with the right to confer the degree of Ph. D.,
the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning is located in Philadelphia,
Pa. The institution is maintained for the promotion of Hebrew and cognate
languages and their respective literatures, the chief aim being the attainment of
ripe scholarship in Hebrew, the Bible, and rabbinic literature, connected with
original research. The college is free and open to students without distinction of
creed, color, or sex. There are several institutions for training of rabbis, and a
postgraduate school in New York for the preparation of young men and women
for Jewish social work. The Dropsie College, the theological seminaries, and
other organizations seek to promote Jewish learning in America in all its branches,
and these institutions have published important works. The former issues The
Jewish Quarterly Review, devoted to research in all the fields of Jewish learning.
The American Jewish Historical Society, organized in 1892, has issued 34 volumes
of its "publication" devoted to research in the history of the Jews of the United
States and of other countries of the Western Hemisphere. There are in the
country valuable libraries of Jewish books. Notable among these are the libraries
of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New York City, and the Hebrew
Oiqitlzed by GooQIe
770 CE:N'SfUS OF RIEILIGIOUS BODIES, 19 3 6
Union College, Cincinnati, Ohio; and the Jewish collections in the Semitic Depart-
ment of the Library of Congress, in the New York and Philadelphia public libra·
ries, and in the library of COlumbia University. The library of the Jewish Theo-
logical Seminary of America is famous for its large collections of Jewish manu-
scripts, incunabula, and rare books.
The Jewish Publication Society, a membership organization formed in 1888, is
engaged in the publication and the distribution of Jewish books in the English
language. It has issued a new English translation of the Holy Scriptures, which
has been declared to be one of the best translations of the Holy Scriptures into the
English tongue. Graetz's "History of the Jews," translated from the German into
English, in 6 volumes, is another great work issued by the society, and recently it
has published a 1-volume "History of the Jewish People" by Margolis and Marx.
It is issuing a series of Jewish classics in Hebrew and in English, of which 9 volumes
have appeared. Another important publication, namely "The American Jewish
Year Book," the thirty-eighth volume of which appeared in 1936, is prepared by
the American Jewish Committee and published by the Publication Society. "The
Jewish Encyclopedia," a monumental work, in 12 volumes, was published more
than 25 years ago, by a private concern, and a new work under the name of "The
Universal Jewish Encyclopedia," in 10 volumes, is in the process of preparation.
In fact, as in other fields of Jewish activity, private concerns engage extensively in
the dissemination of the Jewish word, including prayer books, Bibles, and other
religious works. The majority of the Jewish periodicals are private undertakings.
In 1936 the Jews had 7 dailies, 78 weeklies, and 58 monthlies and other periodicals,
all of which showed great zeal for the welfare of the Jews.
Charitable and social work.-The congregations engage in charitable, quasi
charitable, and Rocial work. A congregation may have its ladies' aid society,
men's aid society, free loan society, sick benefit society, funds for the shelter of
transients, buri!Usociety, etc. But the Jewish communities have generally found
it more efficient to have separate organizations to meet the needs of the family in
distreSR, the orphan, the delinquent, the widow, the sick, the immigrant and the
transient, the poor, the aged and indigent, and even the "poor dead." These
organizations are numerous; some maintain orphan asylums, hospitals, and homes
for the aged; others lend money without interest; and still others extend relief to
the needy, rehabilitate familiCR, etc. There are also quasi charitable institutions,
such as homes for Jewish working girls and recreation camps. It is the aim of
Jewish philanthropy to care for its own needy; yet Jewish charitable institutions,
especially the hospitals, care for Jews and non-Jews alike.
One of the chief features of Jewish philanthropy is the charity federation. In
the large cities and in many smaller ones, the important charitable societies are
federated with a view to coordinating their work in the community and to effecting
economy in the collection and distribution of funds. In 1936 there were federa-
tions in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland, and 98 other cities.
In many communities city-wide societies, commonly known as Jewish welfare
funds, operate for the purpose of collecting and allocating funds for Jewish na-
tional institutions in America, as well as for relief work abroad. In other com-
munities the charity federations fulfill both functions.
The care of the immigrant Jew and the transient is carried on specially by the
Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society of America, located in New York
City, with branches in other cities. Jewish women immigrants are provided for
by the National Council of Jewish Women. These are large national organiza-
tions, that seek to aid the Jewish immigrant and to foster American ideals and the
knowledge of American history and institutions.
The Jewish Agricultural Society exists primarily for the encouragement of farm-
ing among Jews, through information and advice, agricultural instruction, farm
labor placement, and loans to farmers and prospective farmers; and the society
helps to form associations of farmers for economic, educational, social, and religious
advancement. Sinre 1900, when the society was organized, it bas lent over
$8,000,000 to 13,000 .Jewish farmers in 40 States. Another important economic
and quasi charitable activity of the Jewish community is the lending of money
without interest. Societies performing this function on a small scale exist in
connection with many congregations usually under the name of hebrath gemilluth
hasadim (society for the performance of good deeds); but there are communal
organizations for this work in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and other cities.
In the city of New York the Hebrew Free Loan Society (Hebrew Gemilluth
Haaadim) has, since its organization in 1892, lent without interest, $28,388,000 to
601,625 persons, Jews and non-Jews. In 1936 it lent $948,000 to 18,000 persons,
Jews and non-Jews, at the small loss of $5,000 for that year.

JEWISH CONGREGATIONS 771
Charitable work is also carried on by a class of societies the chief purpose of
which is mutual benefit. They pay to members or their beneficiaries sick benefits
and death insurance, pay burial expenses of members, and extend other benefits;
and all such societies contribute, as a rule, to the maintenance of charitable insti-
tutions and do other relief work. These local societies are quite numerous, but
great numbers of such societies exist as "lodges" or~ "chapters," of "orders" or
"brotherhoods." In 1936 there were 8 such orders or brotherhoods, national
organizations which had an aggregate membership of 218,000. There are also
numerous societies that do not pay insurance, nor extend other benefits, but
engage in social-philanthropic work. Like the mutual benefit societies, great
numbers of these social-philanthropic societies exist as branches of national socie-
ties. In 1936 there were 7 such brotherhoods, with a total of 163,000 members.
These include the society, B'nai B'rith, organized in 1843, which in the course of
its existence has organized and continues to maintain, in whole or in part, numerous
charitable institutions, such as: The Touro ln,firmary, New Orleans, La.; the Jewish
Orphans Home, Cleveland, Ohio~the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives,
Denver, Colo.; the LeoN. Levi nospital, Hot Springs, Ark.; and the B'nai B'rith
HillelFoundations. To anotherclaasof societies belongs the Jewish War Veterans
of the United States, which in 1936 had 140 posts with 60,000 members.
Notable is the share of the Jewish women in the common cause of Judaism.
They work through a large number of women's local organizations and through
several influential national organizations. Each of the federations of congrega-
tions has an auxiliary federation of women's societies. These are the National
Federation of Temple Sisterhoods, the Women's League of the United Synagogue
of America, and the Women's Branch of the Union of Orthodox Congre~ations of
America. In 1936 the number of these societies was nearly 1,000. Two other
national organizations of women are the United Order of True Sisters, organized
about 1840, and the National Council of Jewish Women. In 1936 the former had
36 lodges, and the latter 200 sections. The work of the "Hadassah" Women's
Zionist Organization of America will be mentioned below; noteworthy is the work
of the National Council of Jewish Women and its sections, which maintain Sab-
bath schools, assist the Jewish immigrant woman, and care for the religious and
educational needs of Jews in rural areas and on the farms, and engage in other reli-
gious, educational, civic, and welfare work.
There is nothing among Jews corresponding to what is known among other
religious bodies as foreign mission work. Yet the Jews of America are deeply
interested in the welfare of Jews in foreign countries. Jewish work in foreign
fields may be classed as follows: (I) Work for the restoration of Palestine, and
(2) work for the protection from injustice, the relief of refugees, and the recon-
struction of Jewish communities that were destroyed or impoverished as a result
of political events and persecution abroad.
The Jew's interest in Palestine is universal and age-old. This interest has been
deepened since the declaration, made on behalf of the British Government on
November 2, 1917, by Lord Balfour, then British Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
that the "British Government views with favor the establishment in Palestine of
a national home for the Jewish people." In July 1922 the Council of the League
of Nations awarded the mandate for Palestine to Great Britain, imposing upon
her the "responsibility for placing the country under such political, administra-
tive, and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of a Jewish national
home." Previously, in 1922, the Senate and, later, the House of Representatives
of the United States, unanimously passed a joint resolution, signed by President
Harding'pwhich provided "that the United States of America favors the establish-
ment in alestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly under-
stood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights
of Christian and all other non-Jewish communities in Palestine, and that the
holy places and religious buildings and sites in Palestine shall be adequately
protected." Since then, the policy of the mandatory, namely, Great Britain,
has fluctuated, and the work has not proceeded as expected. The Jewish agency
for Palestine, recognized by both the League of Nations and the mandatory, as
the supreme Jewish authority for the rebuilding of Palestine, has severely criticized
the policy of the mandatory in recent years. In spite of that. the interest of the
Jews in Palestine has not abated.
The principal organization in the United States for the restoration of the
Holy Land is the Zionist Organization of America, which in 1936 had 72,000
members, of whom 51,000 were enrolled in the "Hadassah" Women's Zionist
Organization; another Zionist body, the Mizrahi Organization of America, had in
1936, 27,000 members. The chief work of the women's branch is to maintain in
Palestine hospitals, clinics, and other health institutions where service is given
2751118-41--50

to Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans alike. American Jews contribute large
sums for the rebuilding of the Holy Land, settling refugees, religious and edu-
cational work including the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. During the past
10 years, namely, 1927-36, the chief agency for the raising of funds among
Jews of the United States for Palestine, received $13,412,632 for the work of the
restoration of the Holy Land.
American Jewry very early began to evince its interest in the welfare of the
Jews of foreign countries and in their rights as citizens of the countries where they
lived. As early as 1859 the then Board of Delegates of American Israelites con-
ceived it to be its duty to watch occurrences at home and abroad, that the civil and
religious rights of Israelites might not be encroached upon; aud in 1878, when that
board was combined with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a stand-
ing committee, now abolished, was created under the name of the Board of Dele-
gates on Civil and Religious Rights. In 1906, following the pogroms in Russia of
1905, the American Jewish Committee was instituted. The objects of the com-
mittee are to prevent infraction of the civil and religious rights of the Jews, to
secure for the Jews equality of opportunity, to alleviate the consequence of perse-
cution, and to afford relief from calamities. It has issued a number of publications,
and since 1908 it has prepared the material for the American Jewish Year Book,
already mentioned. In 1913 the charitable society known as B'nai B'rith, men-
tioned above, organized its Anti-Defamation League, for the purpose of promoting
good will and the ideal of American democracy. The American Jewish Congress
was organized in 1916, and reorganized in 1920, to promote Jewish rights and to
defend such rights wherever they are violated. Finally, in 1934, the Jewish
Labor Committee was formed to help fight fascism and nazi-ism and the propa-
ganda of these subversive movements in our country, and to represent organized
Jewish labor in all Jewish social causes.
The World War and its aftermath, the pogroms in Russia, and the upheavals
in Germany and other countries have made large numbers of Jews terror-stricken
refugees, and have otherwise ruined millions of Jews in Europe and other parts
of the world. This catastrophic situation called forth an unprecedented activity
among American Jews for the relief of their brethren Between October 1914 and
the end of 1936, the central relief-distributing organ, the American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee, distributed the amount of $86,342,514 for the relief of
Jewish and also non-Jewish war sufferers, Jewish pogrom victims, and German
refugees. Since 1914 American Jewry has been called upon to help save the
refugees, reconstruct the Jewish communities, and rehabilitate the religious and
educational institutions of literally millions of Jews; and American Israel could not
fail their suffering brethren abroad.
