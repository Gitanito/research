some years ago I had a meeting with the
crown prince of liechtenstein Hans Otto
von Lichtenstein he had reached out to
me through some of his contacts he said
look doctor here we have to meet but we
can&#39;t talk about this on the phone
your efforts to effect disclosure are
noble but they will not be able to be
permitted and not for the reasons you
think I saw well this is interesting
finally we got together in New York City
in July of 1994 he said to me in 1989 a
group of us were trying to do disclosure
and it involved Gorbachev president bush
senior himself and the UN Secretary
General Perez de Cuellar and in the
course of us putting together and the
high-level planning meetings to do this
Paris de cuéllar the UN
secretary-general was abducted out of
his limousine in Manhattan he was told
by the aliens that if they did not cease
and desist from their plans to just
disclose this information that every
world leader involved including the
President of the United States would be
abducted this blew up like they an
atomic bomb in the Bush White House and
it did not go forward I said okay well
tell me more he says well we&#39;ve
concluded that we have to prepare the
public for an interplanetary war and in
doing so we can then also force the
return of Christ and I&#39;m quoting and I
just listened he didn&#39;t know that I knew
that the means for that abduction
prepares to play are were run by a
counterintelligence unit out of the
national security state that had the
technologies to simulate an alien craft
and aliens run completely by military
assets and that there was a deeper part
of these unacknowledged special access
projects that were zooming even people
like Bush Senior who was on the
committee but had lost control of some
of these renegade factions Paris de
cuéllar being abducted caused him to
stop that process it manipulated these
leaders into going on to a war footing
and he confessed to me that the reason
he was funding the
of the abduction groups was because they
wanted to put information out to the
public that would scare the public so
the people would make the sacrifice and
blood and treasure to have an
interplanetary war
