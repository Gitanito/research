  		              		Experience Description   

    I was at a hospital visiting my sister-in-law. I was sitting in a room and remembered suddenly  falling from a bench.  I must have fainted.

  I  felt like my life was going  normally. People were doing things but I was not normal. People could not see me,  but I was able to see and hear people doing daily routine tasks and talking to each. There were a lot of people there, even though I didn't know the place where I was in. I had never seen this place in my real life. I saw my family doing routine tasks.  I also saw other people doing their work too, but they were strangers. I do know I was going somewhere, and was about half way there, when I started to hear my brother's voice. My elder brother was shouting my name over and over while trying to make me wake up.  I was trying really hard to answer him because I could sense the tension in his voice.  After a few moments, I woke up to I saw my brother rubbing my hands and still frantically shouting my name. Doctors were gathered around me and I had wet my pants. My brother told me my eyes were open and tears were rolling down my face. My lips were blue and I was cold.  I was sweating even after waking up. 
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 15-11-2021  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.           Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening   

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Uncertain.   I don't remember what people were doing, but I do know that they were not doing anything special.  I remember  someone  giving someone something, like an  antique teapot with long spout. I thought, 'Wow, that's really nice!'  I think he was my elder brother who later shouted my name, and  who was giving the gift to  his wife. She was who I was visting in the hospital. 

  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.    I noticed minor details that I never would notice in real life. in real life, I don't  notice what other people are doing at all, but at that time I was noticing in detail what even strangers are doing.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When people were performing daily routine tasks,  I was seeing them doing all those things. At that time, I was at my highest level of consciousness and alertness  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     Everyone was rushing because they were doing everything really fast  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I think during the experience. I was seeing fine details like I knew what  each and every person was doing, even if I didn't know him or her.
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I was listening to whatever each and every person was saying at the same time. People were talking about normal things but I was able to listen to all of that may be because they were not able to see me so they are talking freely.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain.     I was on some kind of way when I listened to my brother shouting my name but was not a tunnel because there was a light day light and it was more like unpaved road. and there was nothing around that road not even a tree. I was not able to see my brother only his panicked voice was coming to me

Did you see an unearthly light?         No     

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place     I don't know whether it was unearthly or not but was totally strange place. I am not familiar with any place like that in real life. and I have never been on unpaved road (in real life) where I was when I listened to my brother shouting my name because he was trying to call me. There was more than one place where I was during the experience and none of them was familiar  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I don't know may be mixed  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I was understanding each and everything what was happening in those places where I was during the experience. I mean I was totally understanding what are people doing why are they doing it. but I did not understand why everything was happening so fast. but when I was on unpaved road I was walking on a normal pace and completely peaceful. I was not in a hurry  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No

An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     when I was at place where people were doing things in a hurry and where one person gave antique tea pot to another person, I knew people are not able to see me so I guess I knew I was dead. I did not know at that time but now I think that was my spirit and that is why nobody was able to see me. even when I woke up my first thought was I am going to die and I started reciting First Kalima: Tayyab (Purity) because I am a Muslim. and when I was on the road I knew I was going to better place and I was calm and walking calmly  until I listened to my brother's voice and then I started trying to come back and respond to him because I knew he was tensed
