if these Technologies were being used
for peaceful energy generation and by
the way these same technologies that can
create Havana syndrome type uh bad
effects can be used for healing and for
good effects I mean speaking as a doctor
I&#39;ve seen this in an underground
facility I went to on the Mexican border
near El Paso and and I think this is
another big area of exploration but see
the reason that secret you open up that
a crack into that room then you get all
of these technology because they&#39;re all
related they&#39;re all related what you
know in terms of the energy spectrum and
all this sort of science it&#39;s it&#39;s all
part of a a basket of related
Technologies correct me if I&#39;m wrong you
were an emergency medical doctor correct
yeah so now just imagine if I had a
device that was like a like a pen you
know but now it turns out oh we got into
a car accident oh hold on let me get my
thing out and I wipe this over you and
it heals you now I&#39;ve just I&#39;ve wiped
out your job with this technology It&#39;s
like Star Trek yeah the doctor won&#39;t
Star Trek yeah but that&#39;s what we&#39;re
actually up against is people don&#39;t know
what to do with this transition it is I
mean it is I mean I I I sometimes tell
these stories but uh you know I I&#39;ve
also met with people in the in the
classified programs managing these and
they go
this coming out it would be if you took
everything that&#39;s been invented since
the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution to now
150 200 years choo choo trains all the
way to what we have now that we call
High Tech
that isn&#39;t frankly
um put all of that together the
implications of this area of science
technology energy transformation
communication healing uh medicine what
have you would Eclipse all of that
combined so it is the ultimate
disruptive technology so the good news
is it&#39;s a solution to some of the most
pressing problems the bad news is it&#39;s
in the hands of people who are you know
absolutely hell-bent only using it for
destructive purposes
and it&#39;s not benefiting Humanity so I
you know I turned this the Lost Century
there&#39;s a hundred years of lost
technological social spiritual
biological evolution on this planet
because of the secrecy people anyway
people have to realize what are the
foregone opportunities what
opportunities has Humanity missed in 100
years and what are we still missing and
that&#39;s why you know the discussion of
these issues in a serious way is is
really needs to be stepped up you know
beyond the dog and pony show of the fake
um you know stuff going on on in the
news Median on Capitol Hill about uaps
and all that it&#39;s just a dog and pony
show set up by people trying to create a
distraction uh from information like
this this has actually been out in the
public since the 50s and 60s
you&#39;re making me wonder now that we&#39;re
talking about the medical aspect of this
and since your expertise is right here
and I&#39;m trying to decipher my experience
I sustained an injury at the South Pole
and had to go to medical and I assure
you my my my surgeon at the South Pole
was former CIA he was Mac vsog
um over in Laos and he was a pilot and a
surgeon way back then he was the he was
the head surgeon on the glomar Explorer
the Howard Hughes boat that was
snatching up Soviet submarines and he
was also my head doctor at the South
Pole station for my winter season
I in the throes of working one day went
to go move I believe it wound up being
like a 75 gallon drum of fuel or
something and I tore my bicep the
atmosphere that we were in the low
oxygen and the low humidity I was told
makes us injure ourselves more easily
right and it also makes it harder for us
to recuperate
so I went to the doctor do form and he
was basically telling me my arm was
shredded that in this environment I need
to just basically try to do nothing with
it and hope that it heals and he wasn&#39;t
giving me a good prognosis on that like
he was telling I screwed it up badly and
because of the environment you&#39;re not
going to do well keep coming back and
checking with me
I kind of chuckled at him because I have
a history of doing well with healing but
I did respect the environment that we
were in
lo and behold a couple weeks later I was
fine interesting and now I&#39;m wondering
because we were just talking about tech
and things like that and I&#39;m wondering
with he who he was the program that I&#39;m
in compartmentalization of information
our level of remoteness the importance
of keeping me functional right
was I just rectified unbeknownst to me
by something unbeknownst to me probably
it certainly it&#39;s certainly feasible
yeah it&#39;s absolutely a rapid heel for a
torn bicep to me especially when I
didn&#39;t really stop using it that much
right right yeah well that would not
surprise me actually so I know we just
have a few minutes left there&#39;s anything
else you want to share we have about 10
minutes anything else that you&#39;ve
learned
um you know from this experience or that
you want to share with the general
public
I I just I want people to reconsider the
way they looked at the world up into
this point like like you&#39;re trying to
impress upon everybody that you know
things have been unacknowledged things
you know have been hidden from us and
like myself I was there with 49 other
people that didn&#39;t see the things the
way that I did at the time now we&#39;re
having conversations and everybody&#39;s
kind of going oh oh I want everybody to
do that with everybody else any weird
experience that you&#39;ve had in your past
talk to those people again communicate
it and share these stories I mean it&#39;s
very important I oftentimes say that you
know
80 20 right 80 percent of your life is
the same as 80 of my life we wake up we
brush our hair you have a mortgage to
pay a car insurance and all the same
things in life but 20 of your life is
going to be very individualized to you
in different same thing for me right I
think the vast majority of us get way
too comfortable hiding that 20 percent
because we don&#39;t know who to show it to
yeah right and the world is very
divisive nowadays and it&#39;s pitting us
against each other which is horrible we
need to be accepting and tolerant of
differences right that we can learn
together as a society it&#39;s a detriment
to us as a whole and to not be
communicating our Oddities amongst our
own Society right exactly and on also
suppressing this kind of information and
experiences people have had
um by the way speaking of that were
there any uh personnel there that you
heard whoever saw a UFO type object in
the vicinity I did oh you did oh tell us
I did myself Yes actually I was walking
back from an area they called The Dark
Sector it was a limited amount of wind
that day which brings up it rustles up
the snow that&#39;s laying on the ground
doesn&#39;t really drop from the air there
so there&#39;s like a low layer of snow
moving across and I was simply just
trying to engage my distance that I had
remaining to get back to the facility
and when I had lifted my eyes up a
couple of degrees to get over the
drifting snow
from what we call grid North the front
end of the elevated station I saw this
massive massive Fireball
furrowing there&#39;s just Flames all around
this thing that I could see licking all
over the place and from best I could
tell it appeared to be like what I
imagined would have been like a rocky or
craggly Surface in my mind but again
huge and moving across the entirety of
the sky at that elevation there&#39;s
nothing else in the in the field of view
so I can&#39;t even begin to imagine the
distance from Horizon to Horizon that it
was covering
but it just went across the entire Sky
the link of an eye fraction of a second
faster than I can describe and at the
time
because I thought a UFO would have been
you know spinning disc with flashing
lights and you know bug-eyed peoples you
know waving out the window at me I just
I wrote it off
but in reality
I it never left my mind that that thing
never went down it went straight across
the entire Horizon never went down it
never changed his Direction and it was
only after somebody inquired to me
afterwards to reconsider that moment
that I went you know something you&#39;re
right that was that was a controlled
flight path
that was that was an unidentified flying
object it didn&#39;t crash there&#39;s no way
that it you know it was just daytime or
nighttime this was the winter time it
said it was dark yeah it was always
night time yeah it was dark it was dark
dark
the winner yeah it&#39;s dark all the time
yeah yep yeah and do you know if uh is
Raytheon still running managing that
facility or has it been passed on they
are not they actually I believe they
lost the contract uh right after us
there was an extension during our season
and I believe it was the following year
that it went to I believe it was
Lockheed Martin and then that would
Lockheed yeah absolutely and then
Lockheed Martin got in a weird
circumstance because they did something
where they tried to pass it over to
Lidos which is also a very shady company
and then something happened where they
like reversed that out and now it&#39;s kind
of um like third-party subcontracted
through pae okay and who was Raytheon
the the main or contractor were there
other subcontractors working on that
that came back Raytheon was pretty much
the exclusive contractor and they have
done things differently since Raytheon
has exited they have they have divided
it out a bunch since then okay well
interestingly many years ago I think
this would have been probably in the um
early 2000s I met with a very senior
executive with uh Raytheon who was
telling me how they had acquired
e-systems so company used to be called
e-systems because and e-systems did a
lot with this with uh ET crap UFO issue
all these sort of Technologies but I
guess the brothers who headed up uh
e-systems had a conflict they were
afraid it would get into a situation
where some of those projects could get
disclosed so Raytheon myrrh or took in
e-systems and but e-systems had been
very involved in exactly these kinds of
Technologies and of course then became
part of Raytheon
yeah I believe that there&#39;s I mean
there&#39;s tons of little companies I spent
a lot of time as a as a plumbing and
heating contractor on Long Island and
there is a fist full of secret little
companies all over the place that are
just manufacturing things and you know
under broad daylight you know it looks
it looks like a little machine shop or
something something but you know you go
in there to work on their sink and they
have a Humvee in there that they&#39;re
retrofitting some gear on that they&#39;re
trying to get a contract for right
exactly well there are a lot of
companies doing it saic who&#39;s Alan
Hamilton uh yeah uh you know certainly
Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Boeing
um there&#39;s a lot of companies dozens and
dozens of them um you know Etc our tax
dollar is hard at work yeah ail TRW yes
all of those absolutely TRW so that&#39;s uh
you know that&#39;s really great well one of
one of the concerns I&#39;ve always had
about and I thank you for coming forward
with this information because
what I what the disclosure project
really is trying to do is get enough
sources you know from various places
so that you know it&#39;s this big Mosaic
and picture that gets developed because
what happens if you have one person from
one uh experience or a contractor or
government agency but at this point it&#39;s
between well over 900 maybe a thousand
folks like yourself that I&#39;ve met with
most of whom don&#39;t want to come forward
publicly because they&#39;re afraid but but
that that give me information or
documents or very specific information
what I try to do is create that mosaic
from people you know like your
experience with that system uh what I
heard from the scientists in the early
90s about the nro getting his neutrino
light detector inventions to put on
satellites
your experience with the Christchurch
earthquake being temporarily associated
with switching on this huge array at the
South Pole and then this man who had
been on this contract vessel over the
where the Indonesian earthquake happened
um you know and again it obviously it&#39;s
a bit through a glass dimly but you know
the best we can do without having full
access to every one of these
compartmented projects which frankly
nobody does
um you know I guess a very small handful
of of people might have been read in on
almost all of it is to try to do that
and create an assessment
so I first wrote my comprehensive
assessment on this issue in 1991 just 30
years ago now
and now we keep updating it and the more
people like you I just want to say
anyone listening the more people uh like
Eric Hecker and others who can come
forward with a slice of the picture a
piece of the puzzle it really it helps
create the big full picture which I
think the public should know
I agree thank you for doing it thank you
so much sir I really appreciate you
giving me the time to do that and let me
share this info on my end as well it was
a great chat well do you have a website
where people can go to and see some of
these documents and other things I know
you have yes absolutely please I do have
documentation to prove what I&#39;m saying
I&#39;m not a maniac go to
lifering.tv and there&#39;s an archives
section there and you can you can peruse
if you want to hang out there there&#39;s a
chat room talk to people about these
documents or you can download them and
share them at will I&#39;m providing this
information to be shared I want
everybody to know what&#39;s going on out
there and I just want to lead by example
everybody is around these things you got
a document somewhere as well that means
something right everybody pull out one
sheet of paper and put it out on the
table there for everybody to take a look
at will all be better off for it
absolutely all right again well thank
you again for your time and I hope
everybody enjoyed this and until next
time it&#39;s Dr Stephen Greer and we&#39;ve
been very pleased to have uh Eric Hecker
with us today thank you thank you
bye-bye
