Later, the Doctor told me they call it the widow maker; it was the one you don't want.  I had a total blockage of the LAD with ventricular fib.  My wife summoned the ambulance, and after loading me, the emergency medical technician placed a nitro pill under my tongue.  That was the last thing I remembered.   I was taken to the emergency room.  The staff hit me twice with the defibrillator paddles.  Then I was put on a helicopter and flown to the hospital.  Then I underwent angioplasty and received a stint in my heart.  I was unconscious for two weeks, breathing with a respirator.  The heart ejection fraction was down to about 10% and my son in law, a physician, gave my chances less than that.  I stayed a total of 39 days in the hospital.  I now have a defibrillator in my chest and returned to work after six months.  I began writing about it on a blog, www.Fixedhearts.blogspot.com.  

When I awoke, I told the story of my trip to ‘heaven’.  Although I had two weeks of morphine dreams, the death experience was very separate and very real.   I was thrilled with the experience and anxious to share.  For a few brief moments, I found myself in what seemed like ‘heaven's front yard’.  I was aware of a door to the right.  Jesus (I am specific here) was talking to someone standing in front of me.  I was amazed at the grace, unconditional love, and freedom I was feeling. This person had not been a Christian (by religion, or birth) on earth, but was given the opportunity to choose now.  I thought this was fantastic.  I did not choose to return, but I left there and returned to earth.  I don't remember being asked to choose, but now 8 months later, some of the details are vague.  It was crystal clear to me then, and I thought I would never forget every second and every detail.  Since I couldn't speak or even write for a long time afterward, the details suffer

  Experience Description 4633  					</p>  					My last memory was being placed in an ambulance. The heart attack happened at midnight at my home. From the emergency room, I was air lifted to a different hospital for surgery.  I have no memory, only dreams, of the two weeks I was under.  I had a total stay of 38 days in the hospital.  I don't remember having the defibrillator used on me or speaking to my wife, but I clearly remember being in another state of existence. I was in a short line, speaking to Jesus.  Amazingly, he took as much time with each person as needed. I learned a lot from listening to the conversation of the person in front of me. It was clear I would be passing through a doorway or portal to ‘heaven’, but then the experience was over. This must have been when I sat up and spoke to my wife.
