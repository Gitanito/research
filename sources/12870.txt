            		Experience Description:   

I was playing with my grandmother in the pool by jumping off the edge and letting her catch me. While jumping during this game, I came short of her arms and fell into the water. As I couldn't swim at that time and the pool was too deep for me, I went underwater. I remember my mouth and lungs filling with water and then I remember seeing my lifeless body settling on the floor of the pool. I didn't feel anything when I watched it. I knew that I was out of my body and that I was very happy that it happened. I felt that this was right and I felt such lightness and wonder and peace that I never wanted to go back. I think I remember myself flying over the city and seeing the building where the pool was situated from a great height. I wanted to leave my body permanently, but then I saw my grandma grab my body and I felt as if someone shoved me with a forceful push into my body, or it was as if I was attached by strings to my body and they pulled me back in as my grandmother pulled me to the surface. I then remember spluttering and coughing up lots of water and grandma holding me. I was a bit annoyed that she didn't let me go. I felt a great sense of freedom when I was out of my body and I didn't want to lose it.
