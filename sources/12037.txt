  		              		Experience Description   

    I have always been a very empathic person. I have always wanted to be there to help people, to care for them and enable them to live in the best way possible.  I am a nursing assistant.  My vocation is to care for them and alleviate their emotional and physical pain any way I can.
  
  My story is as follows.  By various circumstances, I came across a person who was about to die or had very little chance of survival, and who was completely alone.  I didn't think it was right for him to die alone without anyone with him, and I decided to stay there during his final moments if it really was his time, and if not, to try to help him to survive.

  I stayed beside him all night and tried to comfort him with my presence.  He was unconscious; I kept talking to him and touching him.  I wanted him to feel that he wasn't alone.  I was there about eight hours until I fell asleep.  It was three in the morning, and I was holding onto him. I was practically lying on top of him from my chair.  For me, what was important was that he might feel there was someone with him, that he wasn't alone.   
  
  I actually slept only a few minutes, but suddenly I saw a tunnel and the blue sky covered with clouds with rose-colored hues.  It was as if the clouds were the walls of the tunnel, but all very ethereal.  Everything was pastel-colored but like it was shining and iridescent.  I was seeing the tunnel from the front, but I found I was floating.  I was above, and the rest was below. That was how it felt, even though I didn't see anything but the tunnel. The emotional sensation was that of love, so much love and peace.  Something very great, hard to describe.  No words can encompass the meaning of love and peace.
  
  Something like music could be heard, something heavenly, but it wasn't music.  It was as if it were a background sound, as if it were produced by a mechanism in motion, but it resonated like a chorus with an echo. I just can't think of how to explain it in any other way, but it wasn't music; it was background sound that was radiating from all directions, very beautiful.  If you have heard the sound of the universe, according to scientists, then it was something like that. It was  extremely beautiful.
  
  I remember thinking how this resembled the heaven of the believers, then I laughed at the craziness.  It was very beautiful.  The tunnel started opening in the distance, but I kept floating there alone; I didn't go forward.  It was as if I were at the door.  I wanted to stay in that place, but I knew I couldn't.  Suddenly I had the thought, 'Oh, it's because the patient has died.' That's what made him open his eyes.  I found I was crying, I hadn't realized it before, with tears of sadness for the person but happy for the experience at the same time.  I took his vital signs, and the person had passed away.
  
  I think he passed during those minutes when I had that dream, but for me it was something very real and vivid.

  This wasn't the first time that I've had experiences of a 'sensitive' type, but I had never imagined, never used to think this stuff about heaven was even remotely like this.  It was all too obvious:  Had it been my imagination, I would have created something very different.
  
  I should mention that when I was about three years old, I had an accident in which I lost consciousness.  I fell and hit my head hard; I crashed onto the ground.  I felt I was in emptiness, everything was dark; there was nothing, only me, or rather, my thinking and the darkness.  I was lost and trying to go back, but couldn't find the way out of that darkness.  I wasn't scared, but I did feel kind of worried.  I wanted to go back but I didn't know the way.  And while I was thinking how to go back, someone I didn't see but did feel became my guide.  I was scared of trusting that one, but I followed him, and when I opened my eyes, I felt he had come outside with me.

  According to those who were there, it was only a few minutes, but I had felt lost for hours.  And since then, I have had a special sensitivity, but I never assigned very much importance to this experience.

  I have never thought of that experience as an NDE, but just today I read about Negative or Neutral Experiences.  Since this accident happened to me when I was so little, I don't know what my personality was or whether I changed.  But I can say that I have always felt a lot of compassion toward all beings.  I have literally tried not to harm even a fly.  And I understand the world from the perspective that we are all connected, something like one collective consciousness, that we are all one consciousness. But aside from that, and aside from my great empathy or feelings of compassion, I am very analytical and pragmatic.

  Recounting this experience has been encouraging for me, because for me it's something that has aroused a lot of curiosity in me, wondering about whether it is possible to experience the NDE of another person.  At the least, it's very curious.  I know the NDE wasn't mine, but I do know I was there. Thank you for your understanding.  I think it will at least prove curious for you.

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Agnostic     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I had always thought there wasn't anything else after this, and thinking in that way was a comfort to me.  After my experience, I think there are more cycles.  I don't like that idea a whole lot, but I can handle it.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     It reaffirms my values.

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I felt that we are a divided consciousness, but that it is only one consciousness, being one that is "separated" for each individual to be one.  Something like the cells of the body:  We are thousands that form a body, we are cells and the body at the same time.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I just felt it was a different stage, the cycle keeps going, but I didn't feel a supreme being, just a different path.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   There is more after this.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     There is only love.  That alone exists, that's what's important.  There's nothing else.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife probably exists     No       

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Everything is greater than what we suppose; there is so much more than what we see and feel.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Uncertain     In my experience I didn't "take note" of anything, but I do sense the great importance of compassion and love toward others.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     It is the only thing that is truly important, being present for the difficulties, sharing the joys.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         No changes in my life     Reaffirmation of values.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am more aware of the importance of compassion; I feel more tied to others.  It's as if I were connecting more.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It's easy to report in words, but the concepts don't manage to truly describe what I'm trying to say.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The memories are as vivid now as when I had the experience.  My perception of them never changes, and I don't forget or add anything.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Telepathy, deja-vu, knowing future events.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The feeling of peace and love.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told it several weeks later, but only to people very close to me or those to whom, I knew, it simply wouldn't make any difference.  I don't think it influenced them.  I tell it only as an anecdote; I don't offer it with any mystical tone, but as something curious, something interesting.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I believe I had a neutral NDE experience of my own when I was three years old, although for me it was something fairly absurd and something distressing.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     Because of the circumstances in which it occurred; I see no other interpretation except that it was real.  My mind was healthy, and I didn't have any reason to "hallucinate".  That alone was reason enough to think it must have been real.  And because the sensations were very vivid, very intense, and, as I just said, my mind was calm and clear before the experience.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Logic tells me it was real because I don't see any other reason for it.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         The experience has made me be—or want to be—a better person; reaffirming my values.
