GENERAL REMARKS.
Phrenology professes to point out a connection between certain condition* »j the brain, and certain manifettatkmi of the mind, li claims to
be a new and compli
° i intellectual and moral philosophy, and also professes to dovolone new and fundamental principles of human
nature—principles which embrace every thing pertaining to man as a moral, physical, and intellectual being, and which are most intimately
connected with his happiness and improvement It rests for support, in part on the following propositi.
1. The bram is the orcan of the mind , or
tfa
l
instrument which the mind employs
In
the exercise of thought and feeling. As
this proposition .
i
hyaiologists, anatomists, metaphysicians, and philosophers generally,
1
may take
it
for granted, and
throw the
:
roof on those who call
it
in question.
2.
The mind u a plurality of innate and independentfaculties
—
a
congregate of distinct and leparate powers, This
is
evident from the follow-
ing reason*.
I.
It
pet fun., - of functions, or kinds of operations, inch as
t.
>\
,
■
.
hatred, fear, reason, &c. and, throughout all nature,
n nt kinds of operations are performed
by
different msfniou n/<. The mind, therefore, consists of as many different fitfullies as
il
perform!
real classes offunctions. 2.
It
i-
often doing let era! different things ni /Ac same time—
\<
often feeling and reasoning, hearing and fearing, seeing
and admin nz. hatine one object and loving another, kc. simultaneously, which could not possibly be done
by.
a
single faculty. 8. Ifthe mind were a
ily alike in their nature, and could differ mill/ in tiie tlrength of their qualities ami operations, which
is
not
the case. But ifdirterent persons po«s.--.-.l tin- lame faculties in different degrees of Btrength, they must differ accordingly, which
is
strikingly
true. 4. If the mind were
a
single faculty,
it
could work just as well
in
one harness as anothei could perform all classei .>r mental operations
with equal f'.riliti/, which
is
by no mean If the mind were but one faculty, its derangement musl tt/ualh/ affect all claiUI of
the mental op*
r
ctsbuta swigfe class, c. If the mind consisted
ol
several faculties,
it
could perform not only
a
greater
rar.rtij €,\ greater numbsr
in
a
given time, and thus be proportionable the more perfect. 7. Several othei reasons might
be adduce
'
proposition
is
generally admitted,
it
may with propriety, be assumed. The mind, therefore, consists of innate and inae-
pendc
'
ral of which can be in simultaneous action.
3. Thi st different faculties are po*<et*ed,ori/tinal/i/. in dijferenl degrees

8. The truth of Phrenology is demonstrated chiefly by a would of physical facts. The Phrenological phenomena are uniform,
throughout the whole human family —throughout the whole animal kingdom. The whole world is challenged not only to produce a single im-
portant exception, but also to examine the facts in the case. This uniformity proves the existence ol" certain Phrenological laws which gov-
ern these phenomena. Phrenology, then, is consistent in theory, and susceptible of physical demonstration, by an appeal to nature,
and to facts. Let it be judged ai this tribunal alone, and stand or fall accordingly. It boldly challenges the most scrutinizing examination. Those
who question its truth must disprove the above propositions, and also account Ibr the facts which support Phrenology on other than Phrenological
principles. The following are some of the "world of facts" which demonstrate the truth of Phrenology. In the human head there is a large devel-
opement of the coronal and frontal portions of the head, or of the moral and intellectual organs, while in the animal brain this portion is almost en-
tirely wanting, leaving scarce the least traces of these organs. This corresponds exactly with the mental qualities 01 the two classes of
beings. In the European head there is a much greater endowment of these organs than among any other race. Franklin, Locke, Bacon,
Webster, and all powerful and prolbund thinkers; all deep, original reasoners, without one exception, possess truly immense 34 and 35; men of
ordinary minds, a respectable developement of them; the American Indians, Hindoos, Chinese, &c, an inferior developement; the African, still
less, and all the lower order of animals, none, or next to none at all. The monkey possesses immense 2 and 22, large 1, 5, 7, &c, but no 33, 34, or
35, which exactly corresponds with the character of that animal. The crow has immense 12, very large 7, large 5, 6, 22, &c; the fox, cat, and
all animals which employ secrecy in catching their prey, possess very large 7, and large 5,
(i,
and 12; the tiger, lion, leopard, dog, cat, fox, wolf,
hawk, eagle, owl, and all those animals of this class, which destroy other animals, and live on their flesh, possess, without one individual excep-
tion, immense
6,
and large
5,
while the sheep, calf, deer, dove, robin, and all those animals which eat no flesh, and are harmless in their nature,
have scarce the least
5
or
6;
the dog has very large 29, and accordingly can chase the deer through the forest for successive days, making almost
innumerable turnings and windings, and yet know which way home is. These facts might be multiplied ad infinitum, and coincidences added to
any extent, between the talents of individuals and their phrenological developements.
Other conditions being equal, the size of the brain
is
proportionate to the strength of the mind, and the size of each organ, to the strength
of the corresponding faculty. Yet very much depends upon the quality and activity of the brain, and this upon the temperament of the subject.
When that
is
very active,
a
given volume of brain indicates proportionably greater power, so that
a
small brain may gain in activity what
it
loses in size. The mental manifestations are affected far more by the temperament, health, habits, &c, than by size. There are four temperaments.
1.
The lymphatic, or phlegmatic,
in
which the secreting glands are the most active portion of the system, indicated by soft and abundant
flesh, languor of the pulse, and all the vital functions, and aversion to corporeal and mental effort.
2. The sanguine, in which the arterial and circulating organs are most active, indicated by light or sandy hair, fair skin, florid countenance,
blue eyes, strong and rapid pulse, more ardor and activity than power, and strong animal passions.
3. The bilious, in which the muscles predominate in activity, characterized by an athletic form, strong bones and sinews, black hair and
eyes, dark skin, strong and steady pulse, hardness, force, and power, but less activity.
4. The nervous, in which the brain and nerves are most active, accompanied with the highest degree of activity and excitability of the cor-
poreal and mental powers, vividness and intensity of emotion, rapidity of thought, sprightliness of mind and body, light, fine, and thin hair,
a
clear and delicate skin, and more activity with less power. These temperaments are generally compounded, the nervo sanguineous giving
the highest degree of activity and energy; the nervous bilious, activity and power; the bilious lymphatic, mental and corporeal weakness and
indolence, &c. But as these temperaments, and other conditions, except size, are alike in the same head,
it
follows that the power and activity
of each faculty
is
proportionate to the size of its organ. Education and circumstances may change the direction of the organs, may greatly
modify their manifestation, yet will not materially affect their relative power, unless efforts of the right land are employed;
it
may then be done.
The combined action of the organs has also
a
very great influence on the character, particularly in directing it. The principle is, that the
larger organs control and direct the smaller, while the smaller modify the action of the larger. Thus, one having
5
and
6
of
a
given size, say
12, with 10 very large, will employ his
5
and
6
to avenge personal injuries; promote selfish interests, &.c. with
8
very large, in prosecuting
money making plans, and defending property; with 13, 14, and 16, very large, in defending suffering innocence, and punishing the aggres-
sor; in maintaining the cause of truth and justice; in driving forward moral and religious, and philanthropic causes, &c. with large intellectual
organs, in pursuing intellectual enterprises with vigor; in debating with spirit, &c. with 10 small, and
3
and 13 very large, in defending
friends, while he himself endures oppression. As the combinations of these 35 faculties are almost innumerable, especially when taken in con-
nection with the different temperaments, educations, habits, &c. of different persons, there
is
opened the most expansive field of philosophical
research imaginable;
a
field embracing the whole range of the mental phenomena, and also every thing pertaining to human nature.
The portion of brain lying behind the line A. E. in the open cut,
is
called occipital, that before it, frontal, that above the line B. C.
coronal, that below basilar. One in whom the occipital region
is
larger than the frontal, will have more of feeling than reason, of passion than
intellect, of mental efficiency than strength, of propelling than directing power, of mental sail than ballast, of zeal and action than judgment, of
the animal than intellectual and moral qualities. But when the frontaris larger than the occiptal, the character will be reversed. One in whom
the basilar region greatly predominates over the coronal, will have great force and efficiency of character,
a
ready talent for business, and study,
and strong passions, applied to selfish purposes, but less morality and elevation of feeling, less sentiment and depth of mind; yet with mode-
rate 34 and 35, may conduct and effect important operations. One having the coronal region larger than the basilar, with
a
full frontal devel-
opement, will possess goodness without greatness or force of character; morality and virtue with effeminacy and want of impetus; will have
fine talents and
a
love of intellectual and moral pursuits, joined with so much modesty, tameness, and dependence of character, that he
will not be likely to rise in the world, unless pushed forward by others, but will then sustain himself; will be amiable and sentimental, if not
eminently pious, yet effect but little. One with large organs of the propensities and sentiments, and deficient reasoning faculties, may strug-
gle hard against the current of his propensities, yet will be often overcome by them; may endeavor to live
a
virtuous christian life, but will be
guilty of gross and repeated inconsistencies, take contracted views of religious subjects, and indulge alternately, both classes of organs. One
with
a
large developement of the propensities, and very large moral and intellectual organs, will possess great strength of mind, combined with
great energy of character, directed by the religious sentiments, and applied to the advancement of moral and philanthropic objects, and be
a
talented and useful member of society, yet have many faults. One with the propensities and intellectual organs very large, and the moral de-
ficient, will combine great strength of mind with great depravity of character, and never lack means for the gratification of his propensities.
One with some of" each class of organs large, wnl present seemingly contradicting phases of character, will often do what he afterwards re-
grets, and be subject to
a
constant warfare "between the spirit and the flesh." One having the perceptive organs large, and the intellectual
moderate, will have
a
mind well stored with facts, and
a
desire to see and know;
a
thirst for general information, and
a
facility for acquiring it;
an ability to attend to detail, and
a
popular, practical, business talent, but will lack depth, judgment, originality, and penetration of mind; may
execute well, but cannot adapt means to ends nor superintend complicated operations; may possess versatility of genius, be
a
good seholar,
and pass for
a
man of talents and learning, yet will not think profoundly, nor comprehend principles, nor bear sounding. One with the reflect-
ing organs larger than the perceptive, will think more than he observes or communicates; will have to do much more with ideas than with fads;
with thefundamental principles, and general bearings of things than with their detail and minutiae; with abstract relations, than with qualities; with
the analytical and demonstrative sciences, than with the natural, with thoughts, than things; may have great strength, shrewdness, and pene-
tration of intellect, and be
a
deep and profound reasoner, but will lack versatility of talent, and cannot employ his powers to so good advantage,
nor show what he is, except in
a
certain sphere, yet will wear well, have
a
fund of important ideas and excellent judgment, and shine in pro-
portion as he is tried. One with the perceptive and reasoning organs both large, will have
a
universal talent,
a
mind well balanced and well
furnished with both facts and principles; will be
a
general scholar, and, with
a
respectable developement of propensities, possess
a
decidedly
superior intellect, and be capable of rising to eminence; will not only possess talents of
a
very high order, but also be able to use them to the
best advantage, and can both devise and execute projects. One with an even head, in which all the parts are respectably developed, will have
few prominent traits of character, few excesses or deficiencies, will do
a
fair business, take his character from circumstances, and pass quietly
through life. One with an uneven peculiar head will possess a sui generis character; will be notorious for his peculiarities of talents and dis-
position; for his excesses and deficiencies; his strong and weak points; will often present opposite phases of character; cut
a
bold and com-
manding figure wherever he moves, and effect something important. Each mental faculty
is
manifested by means of two organs, one in each
hemisphere of the brain. They are conical, their apex being at the medulla ablongata, and their base at the skull. In some "heads the organs
are longer and sharper, in others, shorter and broader. The former denote greater activity and quicJcness, the latter intensity and strength.
The number of the primary faculties may be determined by the following process of reasoning:
1.
Every operation of the mind must be the
exercise of some primary mental faculty. 2. Every primary faculty perforins one, and but one, class of operations. Whenever, then, we ascer-
tain that there
is
exercised
a
distinct class of mental operations, we may infer the existence of
a
distinct faculty which produces them, and vice
versa. If we submit any of the faculties to this test, we shall find that the functions ascribed to
1,
5,
8,
11, 13, 17, 19, 30, 35, and all the others,
form
a
distinct,
a
sui generis class, and are consequently the exercise of so many different, innate, and primary powers.

the substantial; the fine arts rather than principles — thus making them self-important fops, and vain and gaudy belles, rather than useful
members of society; with 12 very large, indulges
a
multitude of groundless and foolish fears about them, and borrows
a

.
ten character cfa as his own, and with 10 moderate, even more, and yet V/ith to
Urge, often djffi a B, or falls OUI with them: with
8
large, loves strongly and
is
very hospitable, yet unwilling to give his morxey; but
B^aaa^BBBi
with 11 and 13 also large, is sometimes forward to discharge the social bill, yet generally more affectionate than lihcral; with 11 large, is emu-
lous to excel among friends, and cut to the heart by their reproaches: with 7 and 11 large, and 16 small, flatters them to obtain tlnir favor:
with 10 small, and 11 and 12 large, depends too much upon them, is too apt to follow their advice, and too fearful of displeasing them; but with
10 very large, puts himself forward among them, assumes the lead, and must be 6rs1 Or nothing: with 12 large, is very anxious about them;
fears too much for their safety, even when they are not exposed, and that he shall do or say something to injure them: with 17 large, anticipates
, seeing them with great delight, and at their death, is consoled with the hope of meeting them in another and better world: with 5, 6, and 10
moderate, or small, and 11, IS, 16, 19, 21, and the intellectual organs large, or very large, will have many friends and few enemies: with 19
large, expresses his affection in a refined and delicate manner, and with 21 large, in a jocose, pleasing manner: with .'!()large, recollects with
vivid and lively emotions, by-gone scenes of social cheer and friendly intercourse: with 34 and 35 large, gives good advice to friends; lays ex-
cellent plans for them, and rigidly appreciates their character. Those who have 3 very large, or predominant, instinctively recognise it
in each other; soon become mutually and strongly attached; desire to cling around the objects of their love; take more interestand delight in the
exercise of friendship than in any thing else; are unwilling to think or believe ill of their friends; sympathise in their misfortunes; dread an
interruption of friendship as the greatest of misfortunes, and willingly sacrifice ease, property, happiness, reputation, and sometimes even life
for their sakes. Their friends may befew, but will be clear, and their attachment mutual, ardent, strong, and with 15 large, constant; their
joys, hopes, fears, trials, &c. one; their social intercourse delightful beyond description; their separation painful in the extreme; their loss
agonizing, almost beyond endurance, and the interruption of friendship, a frequent source of partial derangement.
One with 3 large, and 5, 6, 10, 15, and 17 large, and 7 and 11 small, is both a most ardent friend and bitter enemy; never forgets a favor nor an in-
jury, till the one is rewarded, the other avenged, or confessed; cannot do too much good to his friends, nor evil to his foes, and makes.all his acquaint-
ance ardent friends, or bitter enemies. One with 3 large, or very large, loves those best and chooses them for his friends, who most
nearly resemble himself, or gratify the largest number of his organs; with 11, 17, 19, and 21 very large, and 16 and 35 only moderate, the gay,
fashionable, refined, showy, witty, etc.; with 13, 14, 16, and 17 very large, the eminently devout, benevolent, religious, &c; with the intellectual
organs large, the highly intellectual and talented, except when 5, 6, 10, 11, &c. produce jealousy; with 1and 2 very large, sets every thing by
his family or almost idolizes them, takes more delight in home and friends than in any thing if not every thing besides, cannot endure to be ab-
sent from home, is pre-eminently domestic, and with 13 and 16 very large, promotes their happiness by every effort, every sacrifice in his power
and deeply sympathises in their distress, and with 5 and 6 moderate, regards the peace and quiet of the fireside as the greatest of pleasures,
and family dissension as the worst of evils, and does every thing in his power to promote domestic peace and happiness. One with 3 small,
thinks and cares little about friends; takes little delight in their company; prefers to live and act alone; is cold hearted, unsocial, and selfish,
has few friends, and with 5, 6, and 10 large, very many enemies. While 1 is generally much smaller, 2, 3, 13, and 16 are generally much
larger, in females than in males, which qualifies the former, in a pre-eminent degree, to enjoy the domestic and social relations, and discharge the
duties of their station. The faculties of 1, 2, and 3, and particularly the latter, have direct reference to the marriage state, and creates most of
its duties and its pleasures. Its location is outward and upwards from 2; and its shape nearly oval.
3. IIVHABITIVEIVESS.—Love of home and counti~y,desire to locate, and remain in one spot. One with Tnhabitiveness large, has a very strong
desire to settle in a single spot, and remain at home; leaves the place of his abode and nativity with great reluctance, and returns with the
greatest delight; soon becomes very much attached to his office, dormitory, &c, is generally satisfied with them, and very unwilling to change
them. One having Inhabitiveness large, with 2, 3, 19, 22, and 29 large, will be extravagantly fond of travelling, and yet too fond of home to
stay away long, and extremely delighted with his return; will have an insatiable desire to rove in early life, and then to settle; with 10 large,
has high ideas of his country, of national honor, advantages, &c; with 5 and 6 large, is eminently patriotic and ready to sacrifice all, even life
itself, in defence of his country's rights and honor, and his own fire-side: with 14 large, looks with great reverence to those departed worthies who
have served and honored their country, and also to national relics of past ages. One having Inhabitiveness small, is not disposed to locate,
but with 17 very large, often changes his location, in hopes of bettering it: with 19 and 29 large, has an insatiable desire to travel in foreign
countries; and lead a roving unsettled life: with 2 and 3 large, will regard his home not for its own sake, but for the sake offamily and friends,
and will feel perfectly at home wherever his friends are. Between Spurzheim and Combe there exists a difference concerning this organ. I,
however, am satisfied, by my own observations, that both are substantially correct —that there are two organs as analysed in the chart; that Inhab-
itiveness is located directly above 2, and partly between the two lobes "of 3, occupying the lower portion of 4, as marked in the cut; and that 4
is located directly above Adhesiveness, and Inhabitiveness.
4. COffCENTBATIVENESS.—Power of continuity and concentration.—Its object is to continue any given thing before the other iaculties>
until they have fully acted upon
it,
and till the result can be fully presented. One having
4
moderate, can hold his mind for some time to
a
sin-
gle thing, and also change, without difficulty, from one thing to another, asoccasion requires. One having
4
largess enabled and disposed to keep
his whole mind patiently fixed for
a
long time on
a
single thing; to continue the existing train of thought, feeling, Sec., and to exclude every
other; to impart unity and mutual dependence to propositions, arguments, paragraphs, parts of
a
sentence, Sec; to dwell patiently on any subject
of interest, and, with large intellectual organs, to go to the bottom of subjects; investigate them thoroughly; run out processes of reasoning,
and chains of thought, &c, in all their bearings and consequences; to give his whole mind to one, and but one, thing at
a
time; and to hold his
mind to
a
train of thought, subject of study, piece of labor, &c, till they are entirely completed. Concentrativeness large, continues the opera-
tion of the other organs that are large. One having
4
large, with
5
and
6
large, prolongs the exercise of anger: with 12 large, of fear: with
13 large, of kindness: with 19 large, flights of imagination, &c. One having
4
very large,
is
confused
If
several things claim attention at
once, requires
a
long time to bring his mind to bear on one thing, or recall
it;
in conversation and discourse
is
prolix and tedious, and wears his
subjects thread-bare: with
5
and
6
large,
is
vexed if disturbed: with 22 moderate, and 34 and 35 large, or very large,
is
abstract, ahsent mind,
and so deeply buried in meditation as to be unconscious of what
is
passing around him, and holds subjects so long before his mind as often to dis-
tort them, and to carry them out into absurd extremes. One with
4
small
is
able and inclined to pass rapidly and easily from one kind of study,
book, conversation, thought, feeling, business, occupation, &c. to another; from point to point, in argument, without connecting or arranging
them; does not sufficiently digest or lay out his subjects; fails to impart mental dependence to sentences, paragraphs, propositions, and parts of
a
discourse, so that many of them can be omitted without affecting the rest; throws out his thought in concise and distinct propositions rather than
prolix paragraphs; stops when he has finished; and even before he has sufficiently illustrated his ideas, passes to anothers, and again returns;
makes his anecdotes and sentences short by the omission of important particulars; drops one sentence, subject, anecdote, &c. to commence
another, and forgets what he was beginning to say, marks his sentences short, laconic, sententious, and pithy; wanders in contemplation on
a
great variety of different or opposite subjects; throws off care and trouble easily, and keeps no organ long in connected action unless
it
is
pow-
erfully excited.
Concentration of style, thought, and feeling, intensity, vividness, and power of mind, are the result not of
4
large, but of
4
moderate or
small, and very large 34, 35, and an active temperament. One having
4
small, with
3
large, thinks of friends with vivid and intense emotions, but
not long at
a
time: with
5
and
6
large, gets angry quick, but cannot retain his anger unless the injury
is
deep and intended; with 19 large, has bold
and lofty flights of imagination, and raptures of fancy, which will be too vivid, intense, and rapid, to be preserved: with 21 large, brilliant scintilla-
tions of wit, which will be quick and seasonable; with the intellectual organs generally large, rather
a
general than critical scholar, and have
a
smattering of all the sciences rather than
a
critical or profound knowledge of any; soon gets weary with one book, study, &c, takes up another
and returns, thus studying by piecemeals; prefers short pieces on various subjects
to
long ones on any;
a
newspaper to
a
book, &c,; with 34
and 35 large, has bold original ideas, which will make rather
a
striking and momentary, than lasting, impression: with 19, 20, 21, 22, 30, 33,34, and
35 large, will make
a
better extempore speaker than writer, may give variety, but will never give copiousness to conversation and discourse; will
lack the requisite patience to prepare his ideas for critical reading, and yet possess great versatility of talent. For the merchant, accountant, su-
perintendent, and those who have many different persons and things to attend to,
4
moderate, or small,
is
indispensable, and
4
large, very incon-
venient. One with

very small, thirsts for variety and change of occupation, and
is
too restless and impatient to continue long enough at
one thing to effect much.
It
is
generally full or large in those who spend their time in doing one thing, such as factory tenders, he. The dif-
ference between
4
and 15 is, that 15 refers to one's general plans, purposes, opinions, &c,

to the particular mental operations of the time being.
5. COillBATIVEBTESS —Courage, propensity to defend, resist, and oppose.—This faculty exerts an immense influence and discovers itself
not only in
a
physical, but also in moral and intellectual opposition. Its action
is
necessary whenever any thing whatever
is
to be resisted or
overcome, in the execution of any projects attended with difficulty. One with
5
moderate, will stand up for his rights, yet contends no more
than
is
really necessary; will not tamely allow himself or others to be imposed upon, yet never seeks
a
quarrel, and bears long before he shows
resentment or resistance; may be irritable from the excitability of his temperament, yet
is
by no means contentious; preserves
a
happy medium

siological principles. The nerves of the animal functions originate chiefly in the base of the brain, which is the very portion allotted to the
exercise oi the animal propensities. Stimulating meats and dunks excite these nerves, and with (hem the portion of brain in which they origi-
nate, which constitutes the organs of the animal propensities, and consequently over-excites the animal nature (if man; thus making him rather
a lustful, contentious, revengeful, intriguing, hoarding, vain, and haughty animal, than B moral and intellectual being. The intoxicated person
furnishes an illustration of the operation of these principles. Ardent spirit stimulates the animal nerves, and through them, the animal /Missions,aud
these alone. These animal nerves, as they originate in the bate of the brain, have little connection with the portion by means of which the su-
perior sentiments and intellect are exercised. Their irritation, then, whether by meats or drinks, while it goads on his vicious passions forag-
ing madness, does not stimulate the moral or intellectual powers. That mankind are given far more to the gratification of his mere animal pas-
sions than to the exercise of his superior sentiments and intellect, is an undeniable fact. Even his religion is subservient to his propensities,
and his intellectual faculties are employed, and his short life consumed, chiefly in devising and executing means for their gratification. The ope-
ration of the principles stated above, is unquestionably the true cause of this phenomenon. If so, it is as utterly impossible to effect a moral
or intellectual reformation, without "striking at the root of this tree of vice," — without first removing, by means of temperate living and a natural
diet, this feverish excitement of the corporeal system and nerves, and consequent irritation of the animal organs, as to quench fire by pouring
on oil. What! reform the drunkard by presenting religious motives, and lessons of morality, while you excite his passions by the intoxicating
cup? Just as well as to "convert men from the error ol their ways," while their propensities are being constantly excited by a stimulating diet.
Will not the philanthropist and the Christian labor in vain to reform and Christianize mankind, till they duly appreciate the reciprocal bearing
of these principles, and give a right direction to the incalculable power they wield over the intellectual and moral destinies of mankind?
An important class of facts bearing on this point is, that carniverous animals have 5 and 6 proportionate to their savage, destructive propensi-
ties, while herbiverous animals possess scarce the least* —that the butcher's dog^
becomes ferocious in proportion to the flesh he eats—that the
Roman gladiators, to whom ferocity was the greatest desideratum, were fed chiefly on flesh —that the Indian, and all those tribes of men who are
notorious for their savage revengeful, and brutal dispositions, and for the predominance of their animal passions, live chiefly on flesh, while the
Hindoos and Chinese, who scarcely taste flesh from the cradle to the grave, are comparatively mild, and, in their own way, pre-eminently religious
—that intemperance in eating or drinking causes irritability, and excites the amative propensity and the other beastly passions, while they blunt
the moral emotions, and drown the intellect. Of this the libertine is fully aware. The question naturally arises, does the indulgence of the
appetite, and the eating of flesh, cause ferocity of disposition, and stimulate to excess the animal nature of man? This subject is of the utmost
importance to those who would exercise the intellect or improve the heart—to the scholar, the philanthropist, and the Christian. My own views
on diet, &c, will be found more in detail in a work entitled Nature's Own Book, which the candid reader will find to be truly invaluable.
7. SECRETIVENESS. —Propensity to conceal and secrete. We often think and feel what it would be very improper to express. Hence
the necessity of some faculty for suppressing the expression of the mental operations till the other faculties have decided on the propriety
of their expression. One having 7 moderate, can keep his thoughts and feelings to himself, when occasion really demands
it,
yet commonly
expresses them freely,
is
generally free in conversation, yet seldom commits himself, &c,
is
not hypocritical or cunning, yet not remarka-
ble for saying all he thinks, and generally governs his feelings, except when considerably excited, and then throws them out freely. One hav-
ing? large, generally keeps his thoughts, feelings, business, plans, opinions, &c. very much to himself, except when they are drawn from
him; effects his purposes indirectly, and without detection; governs his feelings, and restrains the open manifestation of anger, joy, grief, &c;
can discharge from his countenance and appearance the indications of his real feelings, and with 20 large, seem to feel as he does not; suffers
pain and sickness without showing or complaining much of
it;
is
prudent about speaking; careful of what he says; reserved; slow to communi-
cate, form attachments, make acquaintances, &c; does not make the first advances to strangers;
is
not free in expressing his feelings, but does
it
equivocally, and by piecemeals; suspicious about the intentions of others; wary and always on the alert; generally answers questions, express-
es opinions, &c, in
a
doubtful, ambiguous, indirect, equivocal, evasive, indefinite manner, which will bear different interpretations, so that he
seldom commits himself; hesitates and re-commences his sentences as though afraid to speak out plainly just what he thinks; can employ cun-
ning, art, management, manoeuvre, and act the double part; says but little, but thinks the more; prys into the secrets of others, yet keeps his
own to himself, or at least sounds others closely, and generally judges correctly of character, especially if 22, 34, and 35 are large, and so con-
ducts himself that men generally know little of him. One having
7
large, with
3
large, may sometimes express himself freely to his nearest
friends, yet seldom does this; feels more attachment than he expresses; may love strongly, yet expresses his love in
a
doubtful, equivocal manner;
with
5
and
6
large, may restrain, for
a
long time, the expression of his anger, yet when he does give vent to it, boils over in good earnest; with 10
or 11 large, employs cunning and deception to advance his reputation; operates through the agency of others, and does
a
great many things
merely for effect; with 12 large,
is
very careful about both what he says and what he does; drops no word, and gives no clue by means of which
he can be detected, and with 16 small, contrives to throw the ignominy of his deeds upon others; with
5,
6, 10, and 11 large and 15 and 16
small,
is
obsequious to superiors, but domineering to inferiors;
is
given to backbiting and deception, tells one thing to your face, and another
behind your hack, with 20 also large, can carry oh his villanous designs under the garb of friendship^ and with
5,
6, 10, and 15 large, possesses
great fortitude, and courage.
One with
7
very large, keeps every thing pertaining to himself wrapped up in profound secrecy within his own breast; discloses his
feelings to no one;
is
dark, secret, and mysterious, in all his movements; never accomplishes his purposes, but in an indirect, intriguing man-
ner; with
5
and
6
large, and 11 small,
is
a
snake in the grass, hypocritical, deceitful, and mysterious, so xhat no one knows any thing of his
real character.
f
One with
7
small, acts just as he feels, and speaks just as he thinks;
is
frank, candid, plain-spoken, open-hearted, free from
deceit and suspicion;
is
so plain in his manners, so blunt and direct in his expressions as often to give needless offence; speaks out his whole
mind without due regard to the time, circumstances, or manners; communicates his ideas in plain terms; uses unequivocal language; prefers
natural and forcible, to elegant expressions;
is
natural and open in his manners; lacks art, tact, prudence, management! communicates freely
his feelings and concerns to his friends, and even to strangers;
is
so ingenuous, undisguised, and free from suspicion, as often to expose himself to
imposition and deception, and cannot equivocate or deceive, except
by
means of his intellectual faculties. One with
7
small, and
5
and
6
large,
tells men just what he thinks of them, and often speaks even more than he really intends; shows freely his hatred and his love; with 10 and
16 large, takes an open, fair, honest, honorable, dignified, high-minded course, and heartily despises every thing like low cunning or manage-
ment; employs none but fair means, and does nothing behind the curtain: with 13 and 16 large,
is
naturally upright and honest, and open in
his dealings, and thinks others equally so;
is
too apt to"trust acquaintances; presumes too much upon the integrity of others, and relies tooim-
Elicitly
upon their word, so that he
is
extremely liable to imposition and deception: with 11 large, talks incessantly of himself, tells what he
as done and can do; praises himself, and
is
too often the hero of his own tale; with 12 large,
is
very cautious about acting but very incautious
about speaking; shows great care and deliberation about plans, business, &c, but
is
very imprudent about the expression of his feelings: with
7
and 12 both large,
is
careful about both what he says and does, &c. One with
7
very small, keeps nothing back; with
5
and
6
large, and 11,
12, and 35 moderate, blows right out just all he feels, and thinks; frequently expresses much more than he really intends, and thus often gets
himself into difficulty; gives way almost entirely to his feelings; and has
a
window in his breast so that his heart can be read by all. Its location
is
about an inch above the top of the ear.
8. ACQUISITIVENESS. —Propensity to acquire substance and appropriate
it
to one's self— love
of
properly —desire to lay up, keep, possess, fyc.
It gives deas of exclusive right, personal ownership and possession; desires property merely for its own sake, without any regard to its uses;
brings within our own reach most of the comforts and conveniences of life; promotes industry, and thus prevents vice; keeps most of mankind en-
gaged in money making pursuits, and induces men, from mere love of money, and without forethought, to lay up in health and the vigor of life,
provisions for future wants —for sickness, old age, &c. One with
8
moderate,
is
somewhat saving and economical, yet spends money freely;
is
equi-distant from prodigality and penuriousness, and will be likely to lay up enough to live comfortably, yet live well on what he has. One
having
8
moderate, with 11, 13, 19, &c. large, or very large, finds
it
very difficult to hold on to his money, because these larger organs expend
it
for
their gratification, so thathe seems tobe extravagant. One with
8
large,
is
prompted
by
his love of money to use arduous self-denying efforts
to obtain
it;
parts with
it
reluctantly, and, at times, discovers in his dealings
a
perniciousness, littleness, and closeness, unless prevented by other
faculties; counts his treasures with delight, and employs
a
variety of means to increase them; demands every farthing that belongs to him, and both
makes and saves all the money he can. His successin acquiring, and also the substances selected for acquisition, are determined by the other
faculties. One having
8
large, with
2
large, lays up for children, yet spends
it
freely for their sake: with
9
large, tools, mechanical apparatus,
&c: with 10 large, such things as will contribute to his own aggrandizement: with 11 and 19 large, and 35 moderate, things that combine the
showy with the splendid; the ornamental with the gay and gaudy, such as fine clothes, splendid houses, and rich and costly,
if
not glittering, fur-

from
it;
will not be ruled;
is
enabled and disposed to lead—to push himself forward into notice; to trust to his unaided resources, feels at
least equal to, or above others, that whatever proceeds from him must be good,
if
not perfect; endeavors to make others look up to him, and
to command an influence; will never be content to be dependent; speaks with authority; cannot endure to be under obligations to another,
will never stoop the least; disdains servility, and will be free; despises every thing degrading; feels that he desires particular notice; and as-
fiires
to something commanding and worthy of himself. One having ten large, with
5
and
6
large, protects himself and his exclusive privi-
eges;
is
very indignant at the least word derogatory to his character and talents, and severely punishes the offender; guards with
a
jealous
eye whatever belongs to him;
is
arbitrary, dictatorial, arrogant, and overbearing, unless prevented
by
large 13 and 16; claims much to himself,
and
is
very hostile to those who do not acknowledge his pretensions; with
8
large, puts
a
high value on whatever he possesses, and wishes
to live in such
a
style as will place him above others, and secure to him authority; with 84 and 35 moderate, puts
a
very high value on what
he says, does, and possesses, and
is
very consequential, with
5,
6,
13, 15, 17, 19, and the perceptive faculties large, and 34 and 35 very large,
accompanied with
a
large and active brain, will possess great lueight of character; command
a
very extensive influence in the world; possess tal-
ents of
a
very high order, and so employ them as to cut
a
bold commanding figure wherever he moves; will advance himself to some com-
manding station, and maintain
it
with great ability and dignity; will place unbounded confidence in himself; attempt great things, and
cany them through; will not be satisfied with ordinary attainments, but grasps at something great, and imposing; aims high; aspires to pre-
eminence;
is
emphatically magnanimous, and yet not haughty, merely because he has too much good sense; with
5,
6,
15, 17, and 1!) large, and
35 moderate, thinks he knows
a
great deal, when he knows very little; pushes himself forward where he
is
not wanted;
is
proud, egotistical,
self-important, and thinks and talks much more of himself, than others do of him; considers himself infallible, and that whatever proceeds from
him
is
perfect.
One with 10 very large, and perverted,
is
proud, bold, forward, haughty, repulsive, domineering, self-sufficient, conceited, jealous,
austere, blind to his faults, or considers them virtues; expresses himself with great gravity and solemnity, as though whatever hesaid was of the
utmost consequence, magnifies his talents as much above what they really are, as this organ
is
above mediocrity; thirsts for power, and
is
arbitrary in its exercise;
is
insensible to the shafts of ridicule; thinking that he cannot surely be intended;
is
ambitious in the extreme, never
takes an insult, and can never be made sensible of his errors. One with 10 very large, and 15 large, and 11 small,
is
utterly regardless of the
favor and frown of men; deaf to reproof; intractable; blindly obstinate, and likely to have
a
great many enemies. One with 10 small, looks
down upon himself, and with 14 large, up toothers; feels inferior and diminutive; shrinks into comparative insignificance in his own estimation;
is
too humble and submissive; does not possess that confidence in his own opinions and plans which
is
indispensable to their maintainance; too
readily gives in to the judgment of others;
is
not sufficiently manly and independent, and elevated in character and feeling; more apt to follow
than lead; too modest and diffident to appear well; undervalues himself, and
is
therefore undervalued; places too little confidence in himself;
stoops too much; makes himself too common and familiar; fails to command respect; and will never advance to some bold, commanding posi-
tion, and maintain himself in it, even though his talents may be abundantly sufficient. One having 10 small, with
7
large, and 16 small, will stoop
to low cunning and base intrigue, will have no principle either of manliness or honor to keep him from mean and despicable trickery and per-
fect dishonesty: with 19, 21, and the intellectual organs large, will have very superior talents, yet cannot add dignity to talent, nor make others
look up to him: with 15 large, may possess genuine firmness of character, but too little self-confidence to show it, or carry
it
into effect: with
16 large, will be always condemning himself, and feel ashamed to hold up his head, or look his fellow man in the face, &c. The location of 10
is
on the back, upper, and middle portion of the head, and at an angle of about 45 degrees, with
a
line passing through the base of the brain.
Its influence on the moral conduct
is
perhaps as great as that of any other faculty. It
is
much larger in males than females.
11. APPROBATIVENESS. —Regard for the opinions, and desire for the approbation ofmen—ambition for distinction, promotion, popularity, fame,
4rc Certain actions are considered honorable and others disgraceful. This proves and also illustrates the faculty of 11. It
is
both
a
powerful
stimulant to virtuous and praiseworthy actions, and also preventive of vice. It creates ambition for distinction, but the object of that ambition
is
determined by the other faculties. Thus, one having 11 large, with
5
and
6
large, and 35 moderate, will be ambitious to be considered the best
'
boxer or pugilist, to be thought bold, daring, courageous, &c; with
8
large, very rich: with
9
large,
a
great mechanic: with 13 large, eminently
benevolent, and will make great show of benevolent feeling: with 14 large, devout, and eminently pious: with 16 large, perfectly upright:
with 13, 14, and 16 large, will consider his moral and Christian character as the apple of his eye, endeavor to live
a
blameless Christian
life, and be ambitious of moral distinction: with 19, 33, and 34 large, will seek distinction as
a
writer,
a
poet, or an orator: with 21 large, as
a
wit: with the intellectual organs generally large, as
a
scholar,
a
reasoner,
a
person of high intellectual endowments, &c. One having 11 mod-
erate, will not be regardless of the praise and censure of men, yet will not turn aside from his ordinary course to secure
it;
will not be un-
mindful of the frown and favor of men and the voice of public opinion, yet will not be governed by it, and with
5,
10, 15, 16, and 35 large, will
very willingly breast
it,
when even duty, or intellect, or selfishness demand
it,
and will have sufficient independence to do as he chooses, wheth-
er he
is
praised or censured.
One having 11 large, has an eye, in all he does, to the approbation and disapprobation of men; frequently asks himself and others what did
or will people think of this or that course of conduct or performance, &c: feels and acts as though people were narrowly watching him;
is
very desirous of being thought and spoken well of; noticed and commended; esteemed and praised, &c;
is
very affable, courteous, condescend-
ing, polite; mindful of appearances; as fashionable in his dress and appearance as may be; and extremely sensitive on every point connected
with his character, his honor, his fame, his reputation, &c; cannot endure ridicule or reproach;
is
cut to the heart by the finger of scorn or de-
rision; and withered by the frown of men. One having 11 large, with
3
large,
is
extremely sensitive to the approbation and disapprobation
particularly of his friends: with
5
and
6
large,
is
very quickly offended by the least neglect or coldness, and too ready to construe
it
into dis-
like, will revenge his injured honor, and never allow the least stain of dishonor to attach itself to him; with
7
large, and 16 small, will do things
in secret which he would not for the world have divulged; employ
a
multitude of ceremonies and all for effect, appearances and outside show:
with 10 large,
is
ambitious in the extreme, and with 35 moderate, both proud and vain, extremely selfish; affected in his manners, as though 11
wished to bow, while 10 prevented
it;
constantly fishing for popularity, yet has not the talent requisite to secure
it;
and with 19 also large,
is
foppish, gay, dressy, pert, and
a
fashionable, but weak-minded, beau or belle, floating on the surface, following the wake of popularity and fash-
ion, and, like the weathercock, ever shifting with every changing breeze of public opinion, and
a
perfect index of
it;
with 10 and 15 small, has
no mind of his own; will do as others do, and because they do so; may be good company, and do good business, but will lack commanding in-
fluence and weight of character, and feel ashamed to ask
a
favor, or even his just due: with
7,
12, 14, and 16 large, and 10 moderate, or small,
will desire to please, yet fear that he may not, and also consider himself inferior and unworthy, and thus be extremely diffident, tormented by ex-
cessive modesty and backwardness,
if
not bashfulness; fear to push himself, and be too retiring to effect much: with
5,
6,
10, 15, 19, 22, 30, 33,
and 35 large, and 34 veiy large, will not only possess talents of
a
very superior order, but also have
a
restless ambition, which will stimulate
him to do his utmost to attain pre-eminence, enable him to succeed, and make him
a
great man. One with 11 very large,
is
excessively
vain, tormented with ambition and rivalry; lives chiefly to be admired and praised; uses his utmost endeavor to show off; talks incessantly of
himself;
is
generally the hero of his own tale; constantly boasting of what he has done and can do, and always holding himself up to notice.
One having 11 very large, with
7
large, and 16 small,
is
very obsequious, and
a
real double-tongued hypocrite: with 12 very large, fears to be
noticed lest he should be reproached, and thus shrinks from the gaze of public eye; with 12 moderate, and 17, 19, 33, and*34 large, takes the
other extreme, and makes himself officious, &c.
One with 11 small, thinks and cares little what will be thought or said of him; pays very little regard to the opinions entertained of his con-
duct, appearance, talents, 8tc. and with
5,
10, and 15 large,
is
rather too independent and austere to please the community, or be popular. One
having 11 small, with
a
high endowment of intellect, may possess great strength of mind, and
a
high order of talent, yet too little ambition to
call
it
into action, and thus not be likely ever to distinguish himself.
13. CAUTIOUSNESS. — Solicitude about consequences
—apprehension of danger—instinct of fear. As mankind are constantly surrounded
with dangers, they would be soon destroyed unless possessed of some faculty which, on the least intimation of danger, gives the alarm and thus
saves from accident. One with 12 moderate, does not act without some care and forethought, yet does not consider so long as to let pass the
day for action, and cannot be called rash or careless, except when rendered so by his other faculties. One having 12 moderate, with
5
and
6
large,
will appear rash and precipitate, when his anger
is
kindled, especially if
7
is
small: with
8
very large, may take good care of his property,
barely from his love of it, and not from mere carefulness: with 17 very large, will not possess sufficient caution to balance 17, and thus push
headlong into projects, without sufficient consideration and arrangement. Thus some persons possess more 12 than they seem to possess, and
others less. One with 12 large, examines carefully before action, and hesitates long before he finally decides; turns the whole matter overand
over;
is
very often in suspense, and remains too long undecided; fully considers every chance against him; thoroughly digests and arranges
every project before entering upon
it,
takes all necessary, and often even unnecessary, precaution; too often reconsiders, and
is
frequently so

perfectly righteous and also merciful being, and as benevolent as is consistent with his justice; as disposed to do good to his creatures, and
yet severely to punish the guilty: with 13 very large, and 5 and (i small, as too benevolent to punish the violators ol his law: with 1!)large, as
crowned with splendor, and worships him while contemplating the beautiful, the splendid, the sublime, the grand, Sic. in nature: with 3-1and 86
large, as a wise and intelligent being: with 22, 23. and 28 large, as a being possessed of identity, form, Locality, and other personal qualities,
&c. One having 1I large, with
.">
and
(i
large, defends bis religion with great spirit,
if
not enthusiasm, contends earnestly lor its advancement,
and
is
severe on its opposers: w ith
■'*
large, desires earnestly the conversion of his friends, and
is
extremely delighted in social worship: with 10
large, thinks his religious opinions, his sect, lbrms of worship, StC, better
by
far than any others, and
is
rather bigoted, austere, and disposed to
denounce those who diihr from him: with 15 large, holds on to one faith, but with 15 small, very frequently changes his religious opinions and
connection: with 7 and
1
1
large, and 16 small,
if
he regards religion at all, makes great pretensions to piety, and puts on
a
fair outside show
of religion, yet
is
hypocritical, and possesses little practical every-day religion; has the form of godliness without its power; neglects duty,
disregards justice, violates moral principle, and takes shelter under the cloak of religion; but with 13 and 16 also large,
is
a
consistent every-
day Christian; and with 34 and 35 also large, delights to contemplate the character and works of Deity, and to see the advancement of religion
and purity, and labors to ell'ect
it;
takes great delight in religious exercises, and
is
an honor to the Christian name: with
4
small,
is
troubled
with wandering thoughts in devotional performances, and
is
a
periodical Christian: with IS large, believes w hat
is
told him of Deity; but with
IS small, thinks for himself on religious subjects; with 16 and 18 small, will have very little religious veneration, and may be cleislical in sen-
timent and feeling, anil despise IheChrislian religion; but will have
a
great deference for aged men, superiority in rank and station, and lor an-
cient customs, relics, &c.f One having 14 very large, carries his religion to extremes; makes every thing subservient lo
it;
gives himself
up chiefly to religious- exercises, and takes his chief delight in them; and makes the worship and service of his Creator the paramount object of
his existence: with 10 and 15 large,
is
extremely bigoted, austere, superstitious, and with
8
small, cares little about riches or "worldly things."
One having 14small,1s not very devout; seldom looks up to others, especially if 10
is
large, and
is
not naturally disposed to be religious,
except
it
be in consequence of his 13 and 16. One having 14 small, with 13 and 16 large or very large, will place his religion rather in doing
justice and in loving mercy, than in religious observances: with 13 and 16 large, may be eminently pious; faithful in his attendance on relig-
ious services, and zealous in converting men to his religious opinions, and in doing good, yet will be so more from feelings of duly than of de-
votion; will pay comparatively little regard to religious creeds and ceremonies, but will be governed strictly by moral principles; will follow the
dictates of his own conscience, even though he
is
obliged to forsake "the good old w
:
ay" and adopt new measures; be honest, consistent in his
conduct, and perforin the "weightier matters of the law," yet neglect "meats and drinks;" will do right and do good, rather than go to meeting,
and live
a
moral, virtuous life: with 16 and 18 small, will have very little regard for religion; seldom attend worship, and be inclined to deism
and infidelity; never be influenced
by
the restraints of religion; doubt every thing connected with religious belief; be irreverent, irreligious,
unprincipled, sceptical, and opposed to every thing pertaining to religion. The location of this organ
is
on the middle of the top of the head,
and his legitimate primary object the worship of Deity. This necessarily presupposes, and consequently proves, the existence of
a
God.
15. FIKMIVESS.— Decision
of
character—
-fixedness of purpose—disposition to continue—unwillingness to change. Continuance and perseverance
are indispensable to success. Hence the necessity of
a
faculty of this kind. One with 15 moderate, would like to hold to his purposes, opin-
ions, &c, yet
is
very often changed by the influence of the other and stronger faculties, especially
if
11, 12, or 17, are large. One with 15 large,
is
very unwilling to change his plans, opinions, 8tc;
is
stable, determined, decided, may be relied upon; disposed to carry through what-
ever he undertakes, and cannot endure the thought of abandoning any thing which he adopts. This organ acts on the others that are large.
Thus, one having 15 large, with
8
large and
3
small, will hold on to the very last to any money-making project, and pursue one steady course
for acquiring wealth, yet readily forsake his friend: with
8
and 17 very large, has
a
great many new projects: with 12 very large, may change
his plans from fear, and be irresolute: with
1
1
very large, may change to adapt himself to public opinion, &c, and yet be very firm when none of
these causes operate; thus presenting opposite phases of character, appearing sometimes too firm and then too fickle, and will hold on to his
opinions, while he may change his plans and seem to be less firm than he really is: but with 10 large;
is
sure and positive that he
is
right, and
therefore seemsto possess more firmness than he really does. If
5
and
6
be also large, and 11 and 12 moderate or small, his apparent firmness will
still be increased, and the individual seem blindly obstinate, especially when his passions have been once roused. If 34 and 35 are large, be
can be influenced by strong reasons and conclusive arguments, and holds his mind open to conviction; but if 34 and 35 are moderate, and
5,
6,
and 10 large, he will not perceive the force of reasons urged against him, and blindly and tenaciously adheres to whatever he adopts.
One having 15 large, with
5,
6,
and 10 large, not only holds on to his opinions and purposes till the very last; but also drives forward with
great energy; stops at no obstacles; fears no danger; will carry his point, regardless of consequences; is pre-eminently persevering and well
nigh obstinate; has the utmost confidence in every thing pertaining to himself; will not be driven the least, but may be persuaded; pursues his
own straight forward, high-minded, independent course, regardless of what may be said or thought of him; possesses great fortitude and determina-
tion; pursues one undeviating course; will not give over, and with large reasoning organs,
is
pre-eminently qualified to attempt and carry
through great and important undertakings, and
if
possible, completes whatever he undertakes: with 12 large,
is
a
long time in making up his mind,
but very unwilling to change
it;
is
deliberative in planning; but resolute and unchanging in executing; makes up his mind judiciously, but
very seldom changes
it;
and may be more slow, but
is
more sure. One with 15 very large,
is
stubborn,
if
not really obstinate; will not turn,
will not give up so long as there
is
?t
possibility of holding on;
is
very little influenced by reasons; and with 10 large, or very large,
is
very posi-
tive, even blindly obstinate, or mulish, andean be turned by no amount of reasoning, unless 34 and 35 are very large^ One with 15 small,
is
fickle,
vacillating, inconstant, subject to frequent changes; lacks stability, and decision, and perseverance; begins many things, but finishes very few,
and cannot be depended upon. One having 15 small, with
3
large, may love his friends ardently for
a
short time, but soon becomes weary of
them, and changes them for slight causes; with
5
and
6
large, may, in the prosecution of his plans, drive all before him for the time being, yet
will soon change them, so that he effects but very little; will feel bold and courageous in the onset, but very soon give up, and fail to sustain
his courage and execute his threats: with 10 moderate and 11 large, does just as others tell him; lacks independence; can be turned with perfect
ease;
is
very obedient, and shifts with every current of public opinion: with 12 large,
is
always on the fence; always halting between two
opinions; always undetermined what to do; with 17 very large,
is
always changing his condition in hopes of
a
better, and never "lets well enough
alone:" with the intellectual organs large, will be
a
rapid, but not
a.
persevering, scholar; have
a
profound knowledge of no branch of science,
and allow trifles to divert him from his studies.
1G. CONSCIENTIOUSNESS. — Sense ofjustice —regard for duty, and moral obligation —disposition to judge
of
the right and wrong of feelings
and conduct.—Man
is
a
moral and accountable being, governed by moral laws, placed under moral obligation, and capable of performing
actions, and exercising feelings which arerewardable and punishable. Hence the necessity, and also proof, of
a
primary faculty, which takes
cognizance of the morality, or right and wrong, of actions, feelings, &c.
I
have found this organ much larger in females and children than in
men. One with 16 moderate, wishes to do right, and feels condemned when he has knowingly done wrong; acknowledges the claims of
duty and recognizes his moral accountability, yet
is
often obliged to struggle hard against the demands of the other organs; will be honest un-
less the temptation
is
very strong, when he may, perhaps, yield, 16 not being sufficiently strong to maintain the ascendancy. One with 16
large, regards the claims of duty and justice as of primary importance; will discharge them at any hazard; cannot, by any considerations,
be induced to violate them; makes strenuous efforts to restrain the active exercise of the other organs, and generally maintains the ascendan-
cy over his passions, though he may be sometimes overcome by them, and led into sin; has
a
keen moral eye;
a
quick perception of what
is
right and wrong in himself and others, and frequently directs his attention to this point; consults duty rather than expediency; intends to be,
and generally is, perfectly honest and faithful;
is
by no means blind to his faults, nor unwilling to acknowledge them; often feels guilty and
unworthy,
if
not punishable, for his actions and endeavors to lead
a
correct, moral, virtuous, upright, honest life. One having 16 large, with
8
and 13 large, and
5
and
6
at least moderate, will faithfully, yet mildly, reprove his friends, and with
7
small, tell them their faults in
a
plain
and candid, yet feeling and tender, manner, so as to injure their feelings as little as possible, and yet do them the greatest amount of good; has
at heart their welfare, and closely watches over their moral conduct; but with
5
and
6
large, reproves and censures the guilty in
a
harsh, un-
pleasant manner: with
5,
6,
10, and 15 large, thinks himself always in the right; assumes the prerogative of judging of the character and
conduct of others;
is
censorious, and sets himself up as
a
standard of morality; with 13 very large, and
5,
6,
and 15 large, has great moral
courage; stands up boldly and resolutely in defence of morality and truth, and will never abandon them, let consequences be what they may; never
flies from persecution in the cause of virtue or benevolence, but boldly meets and faces all opposition; never forsakes his ground; drives for-
ward moral, and religious, and benevolent enterprises with great energy; will go all lengths, and make any sacrifices in defence of moral prin-

13
to the speaker and writor; gives to fiction its imagination; to poetry its inspiration, and to painting, sculpture, the fine arts, and the beauties
of nature their peculiar charms. One with 19 MODERATE, IS not much taken with the splendid and beautiful, though he may relish them
somewhat; may show some taste, yet will be more distinguished for other qualities; may in speaking and writing, be sometimes eloquent, yet it
will be the eloquence of thought rather than of diction; may relish poetry for its moral sentiment, the love it describes, the history it embodies,
kc. yet not for its rapture ami imagination; will prefer plainness and utility to beauty and ornament, and seemto lack taste, refinement and del-
icacy of feeling.
One with 19 LARGE, possesses refinement and exquisiteness of taste and feeling; a lively imagination; a brilliant fancy; an almost passionate
fondness of the beautiful, the elegant, the perfect, the rich, the ornamental; for the fine arts and polite literature; for poetiy, if itbe of ahi"h
order, and for eloquence; gazes with intense delight on a beautiful painting, a splendid landscape, cascade, flower, &c; delights to indulge tile
reveries of his fancy; experiences, when 19 is excited, glow, exaltation, rapture, and elevation of feeling; expresses himself with warmth and
eloquence, and is disgusted with every thing coarse and vulgar. One with 19 very large, 84 large, and 35 moderate, will have more of refine-
ment than solidity; of sound than sense; of rhetoric than logic; of sickly delicacy than vigorous intellect; of finely turned periods than important
ideas; and overload his style with figurative expressions. One having 19 large or veiy large, with 5 and 6 large, "throws invective into the form of
poetry; with 2 large, composes hymns for children; with 1 and 3 large, breathes the passion of love into poetic, romantic, and dramatic composi-

poetry, and with 35 large, sensible poetry. One with 19 very large, possesses an imagination so exalted and glowing, a fancy so brilliant

so refined and exquisite that the sober duties of real life appear insipid, that he is disgusted with them, and disqualified for their performance;
considers things as they are so imperfect, that he is almost weary of life, and longs incessively after perfection; consumes much of his time in
the regions of fiction and fancy, and in the indulgence of his poetic and romantic feelings. One with 19 small, is uncouth in his manners;
coarse, if not indelicate in his expressions; not refined in his feelings; lacks taste; looks upon works of splendor, poetry, the fine arts, polite
literature, &.c. with comparitive indifference; is regardless of beauty, and mindful only of utility, and prefers plainness to ornament.
20. IMITATION. — The faculty of imitation in general —ability to represent, copy, describe, act out, fyc. In learning to speak or write, either one's
native or a foreign language, perform any kind of mechanical labor, and in innumerable actions in life, imitation is absolutely indispensable.
One having 20 moderate, will seem to possess very little faculty for imitating, and manifest this power only in the every-day business of life,
where it is hardly noticed. One having 20 large, finds it easy and natural for him to copy, represent, &c, is admirable at description, and rep-
resentation; can act out things to the life when in the humor for
it;
and
is
sometimes troubled with
a
disposition to imitate. One havin" 20
large, with
7
large, suppresses his own feelings while he imitates others, or mimics; can seem to feel what he does not: with
3,
5,
6,
8,
10, 11,
12, 13, 18, &c. large, can imitate the several passions produced by these faculties, and portray them with admirable tact and accuracy: with
5
6,
10, and 19 large, can represent an angry, domineering, vindictive, haughty, overbearing tyrant:* with
3
large, affection: with
8
lar°-e, the
miser and thief: with 14 large, devotion, &c: with 19, 22, 33, and 34 large, can describe and relate anecdotes to the very life;
is
a
complete
story-teller, and acts
it
out so perfectly that you seem to see it: with 22, 23, 29, 33, and 34 large, can recollect the appearance of the landscape,
andof natural scenery, and give
a
perfect and admirable description of it: with 19, 21, 22, 33, 34, and 35 large, can, by his manner, attitude,
gestures, the expressions of his countenance, tones of his voice, &c, make
a
far deeper impression than by any language, and act out just what
he feels, or assumes to feel, &c. One having 20 very large, finds
it
extremely difficult to keep from imitating others, and can copy or mimic
almost any thing he undertakes: with 22 large, notices all the actions, gestures, and peculiarities of others, and imitates them perfectly: with 19
large, can imagine the action which
is
appropriate to any given sentiment; carry on
a
dialogue in different voices, and change the expression of the
countenance accordingly: with 14 and 16 small, ridicules religion by imitating the peculiarities of its teachers or advocates: with 32 large, easily
learns to imitate another's style of singing, to play on musical instruments, and with
3,
5,
7,
10, 15, 19, 20, 30, 33, and 35 large, or very lar°-e.
is
a
first rate play-actor, and has
a
predominant passion and
a
remarkable talent for the stage. One having 20 small, has little inclination or ability to
imitate, and none to mimic; fails
in
his descriptions and representations; cannot copy or write well; with 34 and 35 large,
is
original,
if
not eccentric in his manner of thinking and acting, and with
7
moderate, can act and look only as he feels. This organ
is
located on each side
of 23, forming, when large,
a
ridge which runs laterally, and also giving width and flatness to the upper, lateral, and frontal portion of the head.
21. miBTHFUIilVESS. — Wit—humor— a lively perception of the ridiculous —tendency of mind toform ludicrous ideas and conceptions. One
with 21 moderate, may enjoy
a
joke, and readily apprehend its meaning, yet will not make much sport; may laugh heartily at the fa-
cetiousness of others, yet will not take or turn
a
joke remarkably well. One having 21 moderate, with
5
and
6
large, may be sarcastic, co-
gent, cutting, severe, pungent, and extremely fond of teazing, pestering, &c. and very apt to twit and torment, yet his mirthful effusions
will rather sting than tickle; indicate but little of the purely ludicrous, and seldom contain
a
witticism which
is
not intended to rally some
one: with 34 large, may be eminent for his dry and ludicrous comparisons, which will be always in point; cause
a
great deal of laughter, and
pass for genuine wit, with
3,
5,
6. and 34 large, may hold up the object of his displeasure to ridicule, by comparing him to some ridiculous
objects, and thus b° eminent as
a
satirist: with 17 large, may be gay, cheerful, lively, full of glee, always in high spirits, and extremely
fond of hilarity and amusement, yet does not say many very funny things; with
7
and 20 large, may express what ludicrous ideas he has in
a
mannerso secret and funny, and act
it
out so admirably as to make
a
great deal of real sport, and gain him celebrity as
a
wit, while in
reality he possesses but little 21, so that the amount of one's 21 cannot be determined by the amount of laughter he creates. Indeed pure humor
creates less laughter than
7,
20, and 34 combined.
One having 20 large, has
a
keen, quick, lively perception of the ridiculous, and
a
strong propensity to turn every singular remark or cir-
cumstance into ridicule; to manufacture fun and mirth out of every passing incident, to joke, jest, teaze, &c. One having 20 lar^e, with
3,
13, and 19 large, seldom injures the feelings of others by joking them, but rather strives to make them happy by his humor: with
5
and
6
also
large, will often injure the feelings of those he dearly loves, yet with 16 large, soon regret it: with
5,
6,
and 34 large, mingles the sarcastic
with the ludicrous; the pungent and bitter with the purely humorous, and stings while he tickles;f with large
7,
and 20 added, says
a
witty
thing in
a
witty manner; mingles so much of the cunning and sly with his humor, and acts
it
out so to the very life that
it
takes admirably
can laake fun of others without their seeing
it;
can employ insinuations, the double entendre, &c. with great effect, and without com-
mitting himself; keep others in
a
constant roar of laughter, and appears perfectly sober himself; delights to hoax, quiz, &c, and play his
cunning pranks upon others;
is
emphatically quick to turn
a
joke, pre-eminently as
a
wit, and aptto carry his witticisms too far, and with 30
and 33 also large,
is
a
complete humorist especially in relating an anecdote, with 34 and 35 large, or very large, expresses important ideas
and sound sense, and embodies important moral lessons, and
a
world of philosophy and sense in witty sayings;
is
sententious, dry, pithy, and
always in point in his attempts at humor;}; with 11 large, says
a
witty thing and then laughs at it: with 30 and 34 large, has frequent allu-
sions to past incidents, so calls them up as to create laughter, and sets off
a
humorous anecdote to admiration: with
3,
11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 30,
33 and 34 large, will make
a
social, obliging, cheerful, pleasant, sociable, companionable friend, who will be full of good cheer, humorous
anecdote, and very entertaining in conversation: with 19 large, expresses his humorous effusions in
a
tasteful, polished and refined manner, and
can express even
a
vulgar idea in adelicate manner:§ with 34 very large,
is
pre-eminent for his ludicrous, dry, terse, striking appropriate com-
parisons, full of point and good sense, and very laughable,
||
is
a
ready punster, and argues chiefly by the "reductio ad absurdum," or by ap-
plying the arguments of his opponents to something which makes them appear ridiculous: with 17 large,
is
both cheerful and witty, but with
17 small, makes many
a
witty expression when borne down with melancholy: with
7
small, may have an abundant flow of humorous ideas,
yet fail entirely in their expressions; may relish
a
joke, yet be unable to make others laugb: with 10 small, and Hand 12 large, or very
large, will not have sufficient confidence to venture
a
joke, or will say
it
with so much fear as to spoil it: with 14 and 16 large, and
a
religious
education, will be extremely fond of joking and strongly urged to
it;
annoyed with the frequent intrusion of humorous thoughts even on
solemn occasions; will endeavor to banish them, and feels guilty on this account, yet these thoughts will arise: with 14 and 16 small
is
in-
clined to ridicule religion, and make fun on solemn occasions. One having 20 very large, manufactures fun out of almost every passing inci-
dent, cannot restrain the current of humor which
is
constantly bursting forth; looks at almost every thing as
it
were through
a
ludicrous me-
dium, makes fun of every singular incident, and finds
it
almost impossible to express himself without
a
mixture of facetiousness.S One
with 20 small, cannot without the aid of
5,
6,
or 34, turn the joke; considers wit as either impertinent or silly; shrinks from the lash of ridicule
and withers under
it,
especially
if
11
is
large; feels ashamed when joked, and cannot reply: with 10 large, feels above noticing
it;
is
very slow
to suppose that he
is
the one intended by it, or heats
it
with contempt: with
5
and
6
large, will be very angry
if
joked; sarcastic, but his mirthful
effusions will rather sting than tickle, and displease more than please: with the moral organs large,
is
sedatej sober, seldom smiles and ^en-
sures those who do; thinks
it
very wrong to say
a
humorous thing, and lacks vivacity and sprightliness in conversation and discourse. This
faculty contributes greatly to health by causing laughter, and thus promoting circulation, digestion, respiration, 8tc. and auo-mgnts the mental
powers by imparting to them buoyancy and elasticity. Its exercise
is
unquestionably right, though considered wtoii°- by many pious persons.

fretful and angry when things are disarranged. One having 27 small, leaves his things very much as it happens; is very much troubled to
finds things he wishes to use, which occasions much delay; operates without system, and thus without despatch; will, when in great haste,
be in great confusion, and thus effect but little; and is not troubled by disorder. One with 27 vekv small, has not the least regard for order;
puts nothing in place, and has every thing around him in utter confusion.
38. «' vi.«'i J. \TiOi\ —Intuitive perception of the relations of numbers—
of proportions, §c. One with 28 moderate, performs numerical and
arithmetical calculations with respectable facility and correctness, yet is not pre-eminent; may be, from habit, a good accountant, yet does not
readily discover the result of new combinations; performs his calculations mostly by the assistance of the pen, and, on the whole, dislikes fig-
ures. One having 28 moderate, with 22, 23. 2-1,29, 34, and 35 large, or very large, may possess great loudness for geometry, surveying, as-
tronomy, &c, and be a first rate mathematician, especially in the higher branches of mathematics, yet will not be extraordinary for arithmetic
and figurative calculations merely; may be greatly delighted with the reasonings, and demonstrations, and principles, of the mathematics, yet
not be partial to figurative calculations as such. One with 28 large, intuitively perceives the abstract relations of numbers, even though com-
plicated; readily solves difficult arithmetical problems, is an excellent accountant, performs numerical calculations wjjh uncommon ease, fa-
cility, despatch, and correctness, even in his head, and delights in these operations; can readily cast up accounts, add and subtract two or more
columns of figures, and multiply and divide several figures at a time; and with 9, 22, 23, 24, 2(i, 34, and 35 large, is a natural mathematician;
possesses a superior talent for surveying, engineering, astronomy, geometry, and every branch of the mathematics. One having 28 very large,
can go through the most difficult and abstruse numerical calculations with perfect ease, and intuitively comprehend, and instantaneously answer
any arithmetical problem which may be offered to him, yet with 34 and 35 moderate, will be unskilled in the higher branches of mathematics.*
One with 28 moderate dislikes arithmetical calculations; finds them difficult; is obliged to perform them with a pen or pencil; makes fre-
quent mistakes; may go through a mechanical routine of calculations, yet will not advance far, even with hard study, in arithmetic and mathe-
matics. One with 28 very small, will perform even the simplest calculations in figures with extreme difficulty.
39. JLOCALilTV. — Observ ation and recollection of the relative position of objects, of places, locality, fyc.— One having 29 moderate, will recol"
lect, for a time, the looks of places he has seen, yet often finds some difficulty in retracing his steps because his recollection will not be
very distinct, nor of long duration. One with 29 large, recollects for a long time the looks and position of objects he has seen; seldom
loses himself; easily retraces his steps; readily finds his way even in the dark, provided he has been there before; o ften recalls to mind
facts by recollecting where they transpired, and also what he has read by remembering its location on the page; delights in the study of
geography and makes rapid advances in
it;
forms correct ideas of the geography of places and countries from the map, and
is
very fond of trav-
elling. One having 29 large, with Inhabitiveness large, calls to mind, with vivid emotions of delight, the aspect, mountains, dales, scenery,
&c. of the place of his childhood and former residence: with 19 and 22 large,
is
almost excessively fond of travelling and visiting localities; and
gazes with intense interest on the cascade, the beautiful landscape, mountain scenery, &c, and can hardly be contented without travelling in
foreign countries; and with
8
small, will spend money freely for this object.
One having 29 very large, can retain in his mind
a
perfect recollection of the looks of every place he has ever seen, and with 20 large,
give
a
perfect description of them; can, years afterwards, recall to mind not only the general aspect of places he has seen, and the geog-
raphy, scenery, roads, &c. of countries through which he has passed, but also the location even of insignificant objects; has
a
great talent and
taste for pursuing the studies of geography, geology, &c, and will be likely to break away from all restraints to indulge his roving, travelling
propensity. One with 29 small, finds
it
difficult to recollect or return to places; often loses his way; finds extreme difficulty to form cor-
rect ideas of geography, and of places described to him, and
is
troubled when travelling to keep the points of compass.
GENUS II. Knowing Faculties. These are connectedwith fads which are disconnectedwith physical objects.
30. EVENTUALITY —Memory
of
incidents, events, occurrences, circumstances, historical facts, fyc. One having 30 moderate, may recollect
the principal events which he has seen, heard of, and read, yet forgets the minutiae and detail. One having 30 moderate, with 34 and 35 large,
or very large, can command
a
sufficient number of facts to substantiate and illustrate his positions, but will deal chiefly in general principles, and
argue more than narrate. One with 30 large, has
a
mind well stored with historical facts, the news of the day, scientific knowledge, and gene-
ral information; remember, with remarkable precision; treasures up
a
rich fund of anecdotes on such subjects as may be selected by the other
faculties;
is
very fond of reading and study; notices and recollects the operation of the other faculties, and
is
seldom troubled with forgetful-
ness. One having 30 large, with 19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29, and 34 large, or very large, has literally
a
passion for study, reading, and the pursuit of
chemistry, mineralogy, geology, botany, natural history, and every thing like the acquisition of facts, and, for his advantages,
is
a
very supe-
rior scholar; will allow nothing to divert or prevent him from literary and scientific pursuits; have
a
remarkably tenacious memory of even
minute circumstances and details, and have at least
a
smattering knowledge of things in general, so that with 33 large, he can converse readily
on all subjects; but with 35 only moderate, will be
a
better scholar than thinker.
One having 30 very large, has
a
wonderfully retentive memory of events, and an insatiable thirst for the acquisition of general knowledge;
more facts at command than he can well manage;
is
given quite too much to narration; makes
a
short story long by putting in all the little par-
ticulars; weakens his arguments by adducing too many facts; and with 35 moderate, fails to systematize or digest his knowledge;
is
emphati-
cally
a
bookworm; confines himself too much to minutiae, and
is
governed chiefly by experience rather than reason. One having 30 small,
is
very forgetful of detail and circumstances; has
a
poor memorj' of events; often fails to recollect and do important things which he intended;
finds
it
very difficult to sum up, and cannot think of what he intended. One with 30 very small, has
a
miserable memory; can recollect
scarce any thing, and suffers intolerably from this cause. This organ
is
much larger in children than in adults, and maybe illustrated
by
a
ref-
erence to their kind of memory. In children 22
is
also generally very large.
31. TIME —Knowledge
of
succession—dates—the lapse of time, fyc. One with 31 large, can tell the time of day without
a
time-piece, recol-
lect dates with correctness; awake from sleep at the time he wishes;
is
always punctual at the appointed time; recollects the ages of persons,
and how long since certain events transpired; keeps perfect time in music, and with 28 large, has
a
correct knowledge of chronology. One
with 31 very large, can tell with perfect accuracy the dates of all the important events he has ever seen or read of; the ages of persons;'the
state of the weather on almost any given day, and
is
a
living chronometer. One with 31 small,
is
very forgetful of the time when; finds
it
diffi-
cult to remember the ages of person's children, and perhaps his own, and
is
extremely deficient in
a
memory of dates.
32. TUNE. — Sense
of
musical harmony— love
of
melody— ability to learn tunes and detect discord. One with 32 moderate, may learn tunes
mechanically; readily read music, and be
a
respectable singer, yet will not easily learn them by rote; and fail to impart melody and pa-
thos to his musical performances, so as to warm and melt the heart. One with 32 large, easily catches tunes by hearing them sung; has
a
correct musical ear; delights to listen to good music but
is
very much annoyed with that which
is
indifferent or discordant. One having 32
large, with 19 large, willimpart
a
richness, and taste, and pathos to his singing which finds its way directly to the heart: with
3
large, ex-
presses affection: with
5
and
6
large, delights in martial music, and
is
kindled by
it
for the battle-field: with 14 large, expresses devotion, and
prefers sacred music: with 17, 19, 20, and 31 large, prefers light music, dancing tunes, &c: with 17 small, and 12, 14, 16, and
3
large, pre-
fers plaintive airs and minor moods: with 31 large,
is
a
perfect timist, and adds to his melody by keeping the beat correctly, but with 31
small, may have an excelled musical taste and talent, except that he will fail in time, &c.
One with 32 very large, can learn tunes by hearing them once repeated, and will never forget them; throws his whole soul into his
performances; finds his way directly to the heart;
is
completely carried away with good music, but as much tormented by discord, and
can detect the slightest discord and its origin. One having 32 very large, with
3,
13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 31, and 34 large, or very large,
is
pre-eminent for his musical taste and talents; pours forth his whole soul in melting strains of melody and harmony, so as often to overcome
the hearer; can compose musical pieces characterized by melody, harmony, and taste; readily learn to play on any musical instrument, and
performs to admiration all kinds of music, particularly sentimental pieces, Irish and Scotch melodies and other airs of kindred sympathy and
pathos.
f
One with 32 small, may perhaps with great effort, learn to sing and play, yet will be only an automaton, mechanical, indifferent
musician, and cannot make melody, nor learn tunes by the ear. One having 32 small, with 19 large, may be delighted with excellent music,
and sensitive to discord: yet will with difficulty distinguish one tune from another, and be no singer. One with 32 very small, cannot disT
tinguish one tune or note' from another, and
is
generally disgusted with music. The location of" this organ
is
so much affected by the size of
the surrounding organs, the temporal ridge, and other causes, that
I
cannot always decide correctly upon its size, except in the case of
children. The same
is
true, in some degree of
9,
31, 26, 27, and 28, on which
I
sometimesmistake.

Where a single discover}' has been made, doubtless scores re-
main to be made. Future centuries, like those thai are past, may wit-
ness clusters of new sciences unfolding new truths and new worlds
of lads, by which the knowledge and happiness of mankind will be
greatly augmented. There are multitudes of minds calculated to ex-
plore the fields of nature, and make scientific discoveries; but they are
either wholly confined to other things, or enter so late on a literan
course that the) make (comparativelj little progress. Whereas, iftheir
phrenological characters had been early known, and their education
conducted on phrenological principles, such naturalists, such mathema-
ticians, such artists, such mechanics, sue',! statesmen, such poets, such
orators, such divines, and such profound philosophers, would rise on our
world, as would completely eclipse every thing past and present —as
would incalculably improve, adorn, and bless mankind. It would also
throw out from under the wheels of science, multitudes who now retard
their progress, and clear the various professions of those drones which
arc both their bane and disgrace.

rod, and possesses a mor il chara<-

OBJECTIONS TO PHRENOLOGY ANSWERED.
1st. "But," says the objector, "Phrenology leads directly to fatalism;
for
if
any individual has the organs which predispose to theft, he
is
thereby forced to steal;
if
those which are indicative of virtue, he must
be virtuous; and no thanks to the virtuous man, no blame to the vicious,
for each
is
forced to be just what he
is
by his organs. The Creator deter-
mines the shape of the head, and this determines the intellectual and
moral character; so that God thus wrests from them all moral agency — all
powei of volition, all virtue and vice, and with them all liability to re-
wards and punishments."
1st. That certain vicious propensities do exist, and are very strong;,
is
an absolute matter of fact,
a
fact which every where stares the
observer of human nature full in the face.
I
have seen, you must also
have seen, innumerable instances in point. It were needless to point to
our prisons, and criminal courts; to cite the numberless details of cold-
blooded murders, and revengeful duels, and daring robberies which
blacken almost every newspaper; to enumerate the ever varying, ever
multiplying crimes of mankind in confirmation, or illustration ofthe po-
sition that vii ious propensities do exist, and are very strong,
for where
is
the individual who
is
not himself an illustration of
it
—that
is, who does not possess some vicious propensity, some easily besetting sin?
Now, sir. you are in reality urging your objection, not against one's hav-
ing certain Phrenological organs, which are mere physical signs of the
•various propensities, but against his having the vicious propensities,
themselves —not against the Phrenological explanation of these facts,
but against absolute matter of fact— against the system of nature
— against the government of the all-wise and holy God. You are thus
jii reality guilty ofthe very same crime which you charge upon Phrenol-
ogy, and must admit, either that your inference
is
groundless, or else
that
it
reflects no less against the government of the all-wise and holy
God, than against Phrenology. You have your choice.
_
Now since your objection
is
in reality urged against the existence ofthe
vicious propensities, and since you, equally with myself, admit their ex-
istence, you admit that against which you object; and an objection
is
al-
ways answered when shown to lie with equal force against what the ob-
jector himself admits. If Phrenology did not decide that one man had
a
propensity to murder, and another to rob,
it
would not correspond
with iacts, and would not therefore be true.
"But"
it
is
replied, "you do not answer the objection by throwing
it
back
at
me, you do not get yourself out of the snare
by
getting me into
it." True, but
I
shut your mouth. First extricate yourself from the
snare you have laid for me, and you will thus extricate me—that is, first
answer your own objection, as
it
applies to matter of fact, and you will
have answered
it
as
it
applies to Phrenology.
2d. Thus far
I
have admitted the objection, but will nc#*endeavor to
answer it. These organs of Acquisitiveness, Destructiveness, &c, are
only instruments ofthe corresponding propensities, and not the propensi-
of Mr. F. was complete, as was strongly evinced by the long and loud
applause of the audience —to the no small confusion and discomfiture
of the obstinately sceptical, and to the high gratification of the non-
committal or fence men, many of whom jumped down on the phreno-
logical side.
It
was then proposed that Mr. F. should cover his eyes, and then ex-
amine; and although
it
deprived him of the important assistance (to
which, too, he had always been accustomed,) of sight, in connexion with
touch, Mr. F. faultered not, but boldly proceeded to gratify the audience
in any manner, whether reasonable or unreasonable, that they might
choose: and to the utter astonishment of all,
a
number of characters thus
rapidly hit off, leaped out from the mint so strongly and elegantly
stamped, that all their acquaintances would have known them at the
first glance, even had they, like the Phrenologist, been blind-folded.
It
seemed more like magic than any thing else. The ends of Mr. F's.
fingers operated as if they had been 'inspired.
But the most satisfactory case of all, was yet to come. Mr. F. had
frequently desired some one to come forward, whose character was
very prominent, or well known to the audience for some striking, and
pecui'mr qualities; and was now requested to blind-fold himself again, with
ties themselves. Their increase
is
caused by the exercise ofthe corres-
ponding propensity, and their size proportioned to its strength. They
are the effects of the exercise ofthe propensities, and not their causes.
Men are not murderers, thieves, &c, because they have large
f>,
8,
Sec.
but they have large
6,
8,
fyc, because they possess thievish ana mura
propensities. Very large
6
and
8,
then, instead of compelling, or even
urging, their possessors to steal or murder, are only the instruments, by
means of which the thievish or revengeful passions are exercised, and
their size only shows how much the subject has chosen to exercise the
corresponding propensities. They are not inordinately large, unless they
have been inordinately indulged, and this indulgence
is
the clearest, the
strongest possible proof of their possessor's guilt. It follows, then, that
very large
6,
8,
&c, so far from excusing the murderer and thief, &c,
are physical witnesses of their guilt.
Your theory of free agency is, that the strength of any depraved pro-
pensity
is
in proportion to its indulgence, and that the guilt
is
also propor-
tionate to the same indulgence —that is, the guilt
is
proportionate to the
strength ofthe depraved propensity. The Phrenological theory
is
precise-
ly
the same.
The same principle, reversed, applies to small organs. If Conscien-
tiousness and Veneration are small,
it
proves, not that the person could
not bejust, or worship God, but simply that he did not, and irouli not do
it.
I
admit, however, that God gives to one man more of the faculties
of
6
and
8,
and less of 14 and 16, and to another, the opposite organiza-
tion; and also that this different distribution of the faculties, causes, in
part, the endless diversity of character which
is
discoverable among men.
But this
is
obviated by the following, on which
I
mainly rely as the con-
clusive reply to your objection.
3d. It
is
a
fundamental principle of Phrenology that every faculty
is
originally good, and its proper exercise virtuous —that, therefore, all vice,
all sin, are the excess or perversion ot some good faculty. Take the case
of murder which you instance. On analyzing the faculty of Destruc-
tiveness, from which
it
proceeds, we find
it
to be simply
a
propensity to
destroy and inflict pain. Without this propensity, how could man de-
fend himself, his family, friends, property, &c. — how fell the forests,
destroy those noxious vegetables and animals which are prejudicial to
his happiness, punish the guilty, and make himself feared, &c. Without
this faculty he must be
a
tame milk-and-water sop, so passive, so chick-
en-hearted, that he could be abused with impunity. This same faculty,
then, which, in its perverted exercise, produces murder,
is
so absolutely
necessary, even to man's existence, and much more to his happiness, that
without
it,
he must soon be overwhelmed. And since the proper exercise
of Destructiveness
is
not only virtuous, but even absolutely indispensable
to human happiness, no matter how strong
it
is, provided
it
is
properly
employed and controlled. An illustration. There lives beyond
a
certain
marsh, which
is
infested with beasts of prey,
a
poor starving family.
the expectation of being gratified in this particular. Accordingly,
a
gen-
tleman was prevailed upon to submit to examination, who
is
more dis-
tinguished for certain bold and strong characteristics, than any other in
our city. The Phrenologist was completely successful. He gave the
character in bold and graphic style, and with an accuracy that could
scarcely have been equalled by any one of his numerous acquaintances
present. The conviction of skill and truth on the part of the Phrenolo-
gist, went home so powerfully to the minds of the audience, that their
applauses several times interrupted the examination.
But there was, at least, one sceptic wdio yet remained incorrigible: and
this was
a
man who, the writer
is
informed,
is
notorious for his over-
weening fondness for "the root of all evil." This worshipper of Midas
could not be persuaded but that Mr. F. had previous knowledge of the
head just examined, and therefore desiied his own to be brought in con-
tact with the magical touchstone. But no sooner did the inspired fin-
gers of Mr. F. play upon the golden bumps of our money-loving hero,
than his acquisitive character burst forth before the audience in so strong
relief, as utterly to shock the incredulity of its owner, who soon
b
for "quarters," and was let off-— to the great diversion of all present
