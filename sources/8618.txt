  The  latest book by noted NDE researcher  PMH Atwater is out!&nbsp;   THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES through Macmillan  (and assistant, David Morgan) is now available.

This  book is the largest Idiot's book ever published by Macmillan; 460 pages, 5  appendices - the world's first complete compendium on the entire near-death  phenomenon, its implications and aftereffects, a 360-degree approach,  positive/negative.&nbsp;  It is a  one-stop, one-shop source.&nbsp;  And  there's nothing else like it anywhere.&nbsp;  Although  for the general public, it is especially written for teachers and students,  medical personnel, and the families of near-death experiencers.&nbsp;   The material is first-rate with new research and new cases, but done in a  lively style - perfect for busy people on the go and for the younger generations  of readers.&nbsp;  There are many drawings  by the experiencers themselves, several photos; plus, whoever the Macmillan  cartoonist is, that person did an incredible job.
