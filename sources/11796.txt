The light was so bright and white; I was so peaceful you will never feel like that on earth. The person that talked to me, we talked with our minds. Then they told me I had to go back. I got mad. A big man all in white with big blue eyes and long white hair told me again, you must go back your job is not done.

I was back in the bathroom, I had gone sick on the floor, my wife was on the phone with 911, and I told her I was back. Two days later, I told my wife of experience that I had. To this day, I cannot tell you what my JOB is. Maybe someday I will find out what my JOB is. If you are uncertain about Life, maybe you will have an experience of a lifetime. Thank you for letting me tell you of my experience.
