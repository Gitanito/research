LA MÉTAPSYCHIQUE.
Par M. Charles Richet
(Professeur de Physiologie à la Faculté de Médecine de Paris).
Discours prononcé à la réunion de la Société le 6 février 1905.
Mesdames, Messieurs,
Puisque j'ai l'honneur de parler aujourd'hui en votre
nom, je tiens d'abord à exprimer ici nos respects et notre
gratitude à notre président, M. le professeur Barrett, qui, dès les
premiers jours de votre Société, lui a donué tout son talent et
tout son labeur. Nul de nous ne se consolerait de ne plus
l'avoir comme président, si nous n'avions pas la certitude
qu'il continuera à nous apporter, comme par le passé, le précieux
appui de ses conseils et de sa haute science.
Pourtant il n'est pas besoin de vous dire combien je suis
fier d'avoir été nommé votre président. Et ma reconnaissance
égale mon émotion. C'est la première fois qu'à un étranger
revient cette dignité, et j'en sens tout le prix.
A vrai dire, j'ai tort de prononcer le mot d'étranger; car
je me flatte d'avoir été un des premiers adhérents de la
Société des recherches psychiques. Elle est aujourd'hui incon
testée et prospère ; mais elle a connu des temps moins favo
rables.
Aussi bien me permettrez-vous, en débutant, de vous rap
peler un souvenir tout à fait personnel et intime, car il évoque
la mémoire d'amis qui me sont bien chers, d'hommes illustres
que vous avec tous connus, et qui ont jeté tant d'éclat sur
notre Société, Edmond Gurnëy, Henri Sidgwick, et surtout
Frédéric Myers.
L.] La Metapsychique. 3
C'etait en 1882. II y a dtja presque un quart de siecle.
Le premier volume de vos bulletins venait de paraitre, con-
tenant des histoires curieuses et etranges, des experiences sur
la transmission de la pense"e ; des recits de maisons hantees,
de fant6mes veridiques ; et en me"me temps une sorte de pro
fession de foi, prudente et bardie tout ensemble, indiquant la
ferme resolution de donner a 1'etude de ces plie"nomenes la pre
cision scientifique qui leur avait manque jusqu'alors.
Ce livre, qui repondait a mes secretes aspirations, fit grande
impression sur moi. J'etais convaincu dejJi—et je le suis
davantage aujourd'hui—que la science classique n'avait pas
encore deVoile" toute la ve>ite contenue dans 1'univers ; et
que 1'inexplicable (ou 1'inexplique") gouvernait le monde. Aussi
etais-je heureux de voir des savants, audacieux et sans pre-
juges, poursuivre re"solument la conquete du mystere par la
voie de 1'expe"rimentation rigoureuse. Mais, si tel fut mon
sentiment, ce fut loin d'etre 1'opinion ge"ne"rale. De toutes
parts, les critiques, sarcastiques ou pe"dantes, affluerent. Et
ceux qui ne daignerent pas critiquer remplacerent la raillerie
et la discussion par le silence ; un silence hostile et obstine".
Les spirites memes, comprenant mal que si peu de place fut
faite h la theorie, furent sans bienveillance pour la nouvelle
Socie"te psychique. Indifference, scepticisme, raillerie, hostilite :
tels furent les premiers succes dans le monde de votre tenta
tive gene"reuse.
Maintenant que bien des anne"es ont passe", nous pouvons dire
que ce debut peu triomphal ne fut pas un malheur. II est
bon que les tentatives nouvelles et hardies soient re9ues par
le de"nigrement ; car ce denigrement est f^cond ; il encourage
a la lutte ; il provoque des experiences nouvelles ; il stimule
les e"nergies. Au lieu de maudire nos contradicteurs, nous
devrions les remercier ; car ils nous empe'chent de sommeiller
sur le commode oreiller de la vanite satisfaite.
A ce moment (1882), je ne connaissais aucun d'entre vous.
Mais votre initiative me donna une stimulation puissante. Et
je re"solus, de mon cote, de travailler dans le meme sens.
Silencieusement et tout seul, en 1882, 1883, je fis quelques
experiences sur la lucidite et la suggestion mentale, qui con-
firmerent plusieurs des tails affirmes dans vos premiers
bulletins, et je les publiai dans la Revue philosophique. Quelques
4 M. Charles Richet. [part
jours après je recevais une lettre d'Edmond Gurney, où il
m'exprimait toute sa joie, et, si je puis dire, sa reconnaissance,
pour l'appui imprévu que venaient apporter à l'œuvre, in
augurée par lui, mes modestes tentatives d'expérimentation.
Nous nous rencontrâmes, et à Paris et à Londres ; et je
pus alors m'initier à la pensée de cet homme éminent, trop
tôt disparu. Je pus apprécier la haute et sereine intelligence
du professeur H. Sidgwick ; et me lier d'une amitié profonde
avec Fréd. Myers.
Celui-là, vous l'avez tous connu. Vous ne trouverez donc
pas que j'exagère si je dis que Fréd. Myers a été vraiment
pendant vingt ans l'âme de cette Société. C'est lui qui, par
un heureux mélange d'audace dans les théories, et de rigueur
dans les méthodes, servi par un esprit sagace et charmant, a
inspiré vos réunions et mené à bien le travail considérable que
la Société des recherches psychiques a pu effectuer.
Voilà pourquoi je ne puis me considérer comme un étranger
parmi vous ; car je fus, dès les premiers jours, initié par Gurney
et Myers aux nobles efforts tentés par eux pour faire rentrer
les phénomènes psychiques dans le cadre des sciences régulières
et précises.
Mais le meilleur hommage qui se puisse rendre à ces hommes
pour qui le travail était le premier devoir, c'est de suivre leur
exemple et de travailler. Je vais donc inaugurer tout de suite
mon rôle de président, en vous conviant au travail. Et alors,
pour que cette exhortation comporte une sorte de sanction, nous
jetterons un rapide coup d'œil sur le passé : nous comparerons
l'état actuel des sciences psychiques avec ce qu'elles étaient
autrefois, et nous envisagerons ensemble quelles espérances nous
sont permises et quels écueils il faut éviter.
II.
Nous ne remonterons pas au très lointain passé : car dans
tous les ouvrages on trouve d'abondants documents sur les
phénomènes dits occultes, qui avaient été entrevus par les
anciens et par les Orientaux. Ce sont travaux d'érudition, dont
l'intérêt, quoique assez vif, me paraît secondaire. J'aime mieux
prendre les choses au point où elles étaient en 1875 environ,
il y a trente ans. Vous verrez qu'en trente années—ce qui
L.] La Métapsychique. 5
n'est absolument rien dans les histoires humaines—un grand
pas a été fait.
Nous nous rendons compte assez mal de la marche des idées.
Autour de nous tout change, costumes, machines, langage même,
et ces changements, qui sont graduels, passent inaperçus. Une
fois qu'un progrès a été effectué, il entre si vite dans les mœurs
que nous avons peine à concevoir qu'il n'ait pas existé toujours.
Les très jeunes gens ne s'imaginent pas qu'il y a trente ans
on ne connaissait ni le téléphone, ni le phonographe, ni les
bicyclettes, ni les automobiles, ni les sleeping cars, ni les rayons
X, ni l'antisepsie, ni la théorie des microbes. Il leur paraît
aujourd'hui que ces choses ont toujours existé, qu'on n'a pas
pu vivre sans elles ; et pourtant—j'en appelle aux souvenirs
de jeunesse de tous les hommes de ma génération—rien de
semblable n'existait il y a trente ans, et personne ne supposait
que cela existerait un jour.
Et, si l'on veut avoir une preuve bien démonstrative de notre
rapide évolution, qu'on compare les robes, les chapeaux, les
théâtres, les romans de 1875, à ce que l'année 1905 nous
donne en fait de robes, de chapeaux, de théâtres et de romans.
Pas une dame n'oserait sortir avec un chapeau de la mode de
1875; pas un auteur dramatique n'oserait faire une pièce
comme les pièces qui réussissaient en 1875. Quant aux romans
de l'époque, sauf quelques rares chefs d'œuvre, ils n'ont plus
à présent un seul lecteur. Même les ouvrages écrits pour les
enfants sont de tout autre modèle, et les enfants d'aujourd'hui
repoussent dédaigneusement les livres qui ont enchanté notre
premier âge.
Donc nous changeons, et nous changeons très vite. Seule
ment ce changement se fait par une imperceptible série de
transitions, de sorte qu'il passe inaperçu de nous.
Or, dans les sciences psychiques, tout s'est profondément
modifié, et, pour comprendre ces profondes modifications, il nous
suffira d'examiner quelle était, en fait de sciences psychiques,
la mentalité des hommes de 1875.
Ni le somnambulisme, ni le magnétisme animal, ni l'hypnotisme,
ni aucun des phénomènes dits occultes n'était accepté; et même
on ne se donnait pas la peine de les étudier. On traitait toutes
ces études par un sourire d'incrédulité et de dédain. Et
cependant n'y avait-il pas pour le magnétisme animal les
6 M. Charles Richet. [part
beaux travaux de Deleuze, de Reichenbach, de Braid ? Mais
il était plus simple de nier tout, en bloc, sans examen,
solemnellement, comme l'avait fait un médecin éminent dans
l'article " Mesmérisme " du Grand Dictionnaire encyclopédique
des Sciences médicales, en 1875. "En définitive" disait-il pour
tout résumer en un mot, " le magnétisme animal n'existe pas."
Et, afin de mieux indiquer sa pensée, il faisait imprimer
cette phrase en gros caractères, en lettres capitales, les plus
grosses de tout ce colossal dictionnaire, qui compte cent
volumes.
Le spiritisme était plus maltraité encore, s'il est possible.
Notre illustre et génial collègue, Sir William Crookes, avait
cependant déjà publié ses extraordinaires expériences ; mais
elles n'avaient provoqué aucune conviction. On les avait
raillées, avec plus ou moins d'esprit, mais sans même se donner
le soin de les réfuter. Les spirites d'ailleurs formaient une
caste à part, représentant en quelque sorte des adeptes d'une
nouvelle religion. Ils s'entouraient de mystères, exigeaient une
initiation, des prières. On ne pouvait faire partie des cercles
spirites qu'après avoir fait acte d'adhésion à leurs principaux
dogmes. Le fondement de la doctrine spirite était, en France
et sur le continent, la doctrine de la réincarnation, propagée
par Allan Kardec, et les discussions sur les théories préoccupaient
plus que l'exposé des faits. Ces faits, épars, et mal racontés,
étaient presque exclusivement des histoires de tables tournantes.
Or nous savons que, de toutes les expériences qu'on peut faire
en matière de sciences occultes, celle des tables tournantes est
peut-être la plus décevante ; car elle exige des précautions telles
que bien rarement elle peut fournir quelque renseignement
sérieux.
Quant aux matérialisations, aux apparitions, aux maisons
hantées, aux prémonitions, aux apports, cà et là dans les
journaux spirites quelques récits étaient rapportés, qui ne
pouvaient en général inspirer aucune confiance ; car c'étaient,
sauf exceptions, des histoires vagues, de seconde ou de troisième
main, et la naïve crédulité des narrateurs provoquait, comme
de juste, le scepticisme des lecteurs.
En tout cas, tout était épars, sans lien, sans cohésion. Selon
l'occasion ou le tempérament, il y avait des magnétiseurs, des
spirites, des hypnotiseurs, des médiums clairvoyants, des
L.] La Métapsychique. 7
médiums à matérialisations ; mais le groupement de tous
ces phénomènes n'avait pas été tenté ; et la seule tentative
de synthèse qu'on s'était hasardé à faire, c'était l'évocation des
esprits, sortes de Dei ex machina, suppléant à tout par leur
omnipotence, leur omniscience, et leur ubiquité.
Aussi les doctrines et les faits psychiques étaient-ils égale
ment repoussés par les savants et par le vulgaire. On ne
comprenait même pas qu'il fût permis à un homme sérieux
d'examiner si de tels faits étaient vrais ou non.
Voilà pourquoi, Mesdames et Messieurs, je professe une si
grande admiration pour notre illustre collègue, Sir William
Crookes. Ce n'est pas seulement parce qu'il a découvert des
métaux nouveaux, inventé des appareils admirables, source de
fécondes découvertes, imaginé des théories audacieuses dont
chaque jour vient confirmer la profonde pénétration. C'est
pour autre chose encore que je l'admire ; c'est pour son
courage scientifique. Le courage du philosophe consiste à
déclarer la vérité et à braver pour elle la raillerie et le
mépris. Il me parait que ce courage là—le courage professionnel
du savant—vaut bien la bravoure du soldat qui monte à
l'assaut, sous la mitraille.
Quand, en 1875, étant alors tout jeune étudiant, je me
hasardai à parler du somnambulisme, je débutai par des
paroles qui sembleraient bien ridicules maintenant : II faut
un certain courage, disais-je alors, -pour prononcer le mot som
nambulisme. De telles expressions ne se comprennent plus
aujourd'hui. Aujourd'hui nos jeunes étudiants parlent couram
ment du magnétisme animal, de la suggestion hypnotique, et
des autres phénomènes de même ordre, devenus classiques.
Même ils sont parfois un peu ingrats envers leurs devanciers,
car ils ne peuvent pas se figurer à quel discrédit l'étude de
ces phénomènes menait les hommes ayant la témérité de
s'aventurer dans ce champ maudit. Je me souviens encore
que, lorsque je fis part de mes études à mon père, dont la
haute raison et la sagacité me guidèrent toujours, il les
reconnut exactes. Mais, quand je lui dis que je les voulais
publier, il m'en dissuada, me disant : " Tu veux donc te
perdre."
Heureusement on ne se perd pas quand on défend ce qu'on
croit être le vrai. Ce serait une étrange maladresse que
8 M. Charles Richet. [part
d'avoir découvert une vérité et de ne pas oser la révéler,
sous prétexte qu'elle sera contredite. Eh oui ! mille fois oui,
elle sera contredite. Toutes les vérités nouvelles ont com
mencé par là, presque sans exception. Et, si magnis liceat
componere parva, je ne me suis pas plus perdu en affirmant
la réalité du somnambulisme provoqué, que Sir William
Crookes ne s'est perdu en affirmant l'existence des maté
rialisations.
Même, puisque je parle ici de ce qu'on est convenu d'appeler
courage scientifique,—ce qu'il vaudrait mieux dénommer
devoir scientifique,—on me permettra une courte digression.
Souvent les spirites, dont la conviction, profonde comme celle
des apôtres, n'est pas toujours appuyée sur des preuves irré
futables, nous reprochent de ne pas oser dire tout haut ce
que nous pensons tout bas ; et de mettre une prudence
exagérée, presque lâche, dans nos paroles ou nos écrits.
Nous aurions dans la main des trésors de choses vraies, et,
par timidité, nous n'oserions pas ouvrir la main pour laisser
s'envoler de par le monde ces vérités que nous détenons
jalousement. Il me paraît que ce reproche est bien injuste.
Nous ne sommes encore ni les uns, ni les autres, parvenus à
ce degré d'ineptie. Quoi ! voici une vérité dont je suis abso
lument certain, et que, par je ne sais quelles enfantines
craintes, je n'oserais pas énoncer ! Serions-nous assez sots pour
ne pas être sûrs qu'une vérité finira toujours tôt ou tard par
apparaître au grand jour et faire irruption parmi les hommes ?
Vraiment non ! Si nous hésitons à raconter tel ou tel fait,
à publier telle ou telle expérience, c'est qu'il nous reste encore
des doutes. Car, si notre certitude était complète, nous n'hési
terions pas à parler urbi et orbi. Quel pauvre calcul que de
ne pas oser dire la vérité, sous prétexte qu'elle va soulever
des appréciations hostiles ! C'est un peu de cette manière
naïve et sotte que procèdent certains gouvernements, quand
ils ont reçu la nouvelle d'une défaite militaire ; ils n'osent
pas la communiquer à la presse, et publient des bulletins
mensongers. Cependant ils doivent bien savoir qu'un jour
ou l'autre la défaite sera connue dans tous ses détails.
Si parfois on hésite à raconter des faits dont on a été
témoin, ce n'est pas seulement parce qu'un doute subsiste,
c'est aussi parce qu'il ne suffit pas d'avoir observé un fait
L.] La M&apsychique. 9
pour le publier. La science n'est pas le re"cit d'un fait,
ni meme le re"cit de plusieurs faits. Elle est plus compli-
que"e qu'une serie d'histoires entasse"es 1'une apres 1'autre. Elle
demande que ces faits e"pars soient plus ou moins coordonnes ;
avec des preuves, des demonstrations, et des repetitions qui les
eclaircissent. Comme on a 1'espoir de faire sortir les sciences
psychiques de la pe"riode empirique pour les faire entrer dans
la periode experimentale, on attend que 1'experimentation ait
complete, et plus ou moins elucide, un fait empirique isole" ; et
souvent on est force d'attendre longtemps. Experientia fallax,
judicium difficile, disait deja Hippocrate.
En outre il est parfois certaines preuves morales, qui sont
decisives pour nous, mais qui ne peuvent etre considerees
comme telles par le public. On pourrait citer bien de curieuses
histoires, tres instructives, mais qui n'ont que notre conviction
personnelle pour preuve de leur valeur scientifique. Elles n'ont
done pas droit d'admission dans la science, et j'estime que pro-
visoirement il vaut mieux ne pas les publier. Ce n'est pas
par defaut de courage, ce n'est pas par deference pour 1'opinion
publique, c'est par respect d'une critique scieutifique tres legi-
time. J'avoue me'me que, si un excellent observateur venait
me citer certains faits singuliers, etablis uniquement sur sa
conviction intime, j'aurais peine a y ajouter foi, et je sup-
poserais quelque defectuosite dans 1'observatiou, ou quelque
tromperie habile dans la production du phenomene.
Alors a quoi bon publier une experience dont la realite,
quelque certaiue qu'elle soit pour nous, ne peut e'tre demon-
tree ?
Revenons maintenant a 1'annee 1875, et aux progres de
1'opinion en matiere psychique.
Ces progres ont ete considerables : et, au risque de passer
pour un flatteur, je dirai que c'est a vous qu'ils sont dus.
C'est votre Societe qui, dirigee par vos illustres presidents,
que ce soit Fred. Myers, ou H. Sidgwick, ou M. Arthur Balfour,
ou M. Barrett, ou Sir O. Lodge, car tous ont eu part h vos
travaux, a ose initier un public sceptique k des faits etranges
et troublants. Le public put se rendre compte qu'on pouvait
etre, vis a vis des faits psychiques, aussi exigeant en demonstra
tions que pour les autres faits scientifiques, de chimie, de
physiologic, d'astronomie. Vous avez meme avec raisou
10 M. Charles Richet. [part
pensé qu'il fallait être plus sévère encore que ne sont d'ordi
naire les chimistes ou les physiologistes dans leurs démonstra
tions ; car, plus la chose à établir est extraordinaire, dépassant
les prévisions normales, plus les preuves doivent être rigou
reuses. Et alors, dans votre Journal et dans vos Proceedings,
parurent des récits contrôlés exactement, toujours soumis à une
critique pénétrante, desquels on pouvait tirer cette conclusion
•certaine que des phénomènes inexpliqués se produisent, divers,
multiples, protéiformes, dépendant probablement de causes
.diverses, mais cependant ayant ce caractère commun de n'être
pas explicables par les explications simplistes, qu'essayent de
nous donner les sciences officielles classiques.
Parallèlement à votre effort, sur le continent, en France et
•en Italie surtout, on poursuivait méthodiquement l'étude des
phénomènes semblables. Aksakoff, Ochorowicz, de Rochas, Lom-
broso, J. Maxwell, et bien d'autres, s'appliquaient à donner
.de la précision aux expériences. Mais, malgré tous les efforts
<le ces hommes éminents, ce serait une lourde exagération que
de croire la démonstration parachevée. Pour grand que soit
le labeur, il n'a pas réussi à ce point que les phénomènes psy
chiques sont entrés définitivement dans la science. Nous serions
bien imprudents de le croire. Mais nous sommes au moins
arrivés à ce résultat, qui est de première importance, qu'aujour
d'hui on a le droit d'étudier ces questions sans être accusé
•d'aliénation mentale. Il n'y a plus ni commisération, ni raille
ries, ni injures pour les psychologues qui osent aborder de front
l'étude des sciences occultes. Et c'est là un réel progrès que
-d'avoir ouvert la voie à nos successeurs, de sorte qu'ils pourront
poursuivre la recherche de la vérité sans rencontrer les obstacles
•qui nous ont été opposés.
Il me paraît que ce résultat n'est pas une quantité négligeable.
Mais il en est un autre, très important aussi, et sur lequel
je dois maintenant insister.
Les nombreux faits, plus ou moins authentiques, plus ou
moins bien observés, qui, grâce à la collaboration des amis de
la psychologie disséminés dans le monde, se trouvent consignés
dans les recueils de sciences psychiques, constituent une masse
imposante de documents, dans lesquels on peut largement puiser
pour écrire un livre qui n'a pas été écrit encore, livre qui traitera
de la science psychique dans son ensemble, livre où seront mis
L.] La MétapsychiqUe. 11
en valeur les liens qui unissent les divers phénomènes.1 Ce livre
de synthèse n'est pas fait : mais quelque jour il apparaîtra,
I La bibliographie est tellement vaste dans la science métapsychique qu'on
ne saurait passer sous silence cet important chapitre négligé.
Je crois bien que pour la commodité des recherches on devrait faire usage
de la classification décimale, telle que Melvil Dewey l'a proposée, et telle
qu'elle a été modifiée, avec l'assentiment de M. Dewey, par l'Institut de
bibliographie internationale de Bruxelles.
J'ai donné en 1902 la classification décimale de la Physiologie, et j'y ai
introduit la bibliographie des sciences occultes. Elle est imprimée dans les
travaux de l'Institut international de bibliographie.
Un rapide exposé va vous faire connaître la nature de cette classification.
Soit 6, Sciences appliquées. 61, Sciences appliquées à la médecine. 612,
Physiologie. 612.8, Physiologie du système nerveux. 612.82, Physiologie du
système nerveux central. 612.821, Physiologie psychologique. 612.821.7, Phy
siologie du sommeil et du somnambulisme et des phénomènes analogues, on pourra
indexer sous le nombre commun 612.821.71, tout ce qui se rapportera au
somnambulisme, à l'hypnotisme et aux sciences métapsychiques.
De sorte que tout ce que nous avons à étudier peut être groupé sous ce
chiffre 612.821.71, qui fera rentrer la métapsychique dans le cadre général
des connaissances humaines.
Ce chiffre lui même a été subdivisé ainsi :
612.821.711 Théorie de l'hypnotisme.
612.821.712 Hypnotisme chez l'homme.
612.821.713 Hypnotisme chez les animaux.
612.821.714 Lucidité (ou métapsychique subjective).
Ce chapitre à son tour est subdivisé de la manière suivante :
612.821.714.1 Lucidité, ou clairvoyance.
612.821.714.2 Hallucinations véridiques.
612.821.714.3 Prémonitions.
612.821.714.4 Télépathie.
612.821.714.5 Suggestion mentale.

II me semble bien qu'il sera avantageux pour nos recherches de mettre en
12 M. Charles Richet. [part
bientôt peut-être ; et ce jour là les sciences psychiques auront
enfin trouvé leur Compendium, leur Manuel, leur Traité élémentaire.
Une science n'est vraiment constituée que lorsque elle peut
donner, aux étudiants et aux maîtres, un livre qui la résume
et l'expose. Nous avons des centaines de Traités, excellents
d'ailleurs, pour la chimie, la physiologie, la physique, l'algèbre,
l'astronomie, la psychologie même. N'est-il pas désirable que,
profitant des richesses éparses, patiemment amassées de toutes
parts, quelque penseur ingénieux et sagace se dévoue à les
colliger, séparant le bon grain de l'ivraie, laissant résolument
de côté ce que est douteux et incomplet pour ne prendre que
les faits dûment et solidement constatés ?
Je ne prétends pas que l'auteur doive remplacer, là où il
y a doute, les faits incertains par des affirmations : ni proposer
comme parfaites des théories incomplètes. Je dis seulement
qu'en 1905, après les innombrables récits accumulés depuis
trente ans sur les sciences psychiques, les matériaux d'un grand
ouvrage sont préparés. Et j'ajoute que l'heure de ce livre
est venue. Les temps sont murs, pour ce grand Traité élémentaire
et rationnel des sciences occultes.
Mais, en prononçant ce mot, je m'aperçois qu'il faut donner
un nom à cette nouvelle science. Ne l'appelons pas science
occulte ; car toutes les sciences à leur début sont occultes ; elles
cessent de l'être lorsque elles sont moins incertaines. L'astrologie
a cessé d'être une science occulte lorsqu'elle s'est transformée
en astronomie ; l'alchimie, quand elle s'est transmutée en chimie.
Je ne trouve pas que le mot de sciences psychiques soit très
heureux ; car il est bon nombre de phénomènes pour lesquels
l'explication par la ^xy est insuffisante. Par exemple qu'y
a-t-il de psychique dans les bruits qui se font entendre en une
maison hantée ? Il vaut mieux employer un mot qui ne constitue
pas déjà en lui-même une hypothèse, et une hypothèse manifeste
ment insuffisante. En outre la psychologie classique est l'étude
de l'âme humaine et de l'intelligence. Elle aurait droit, elle
tête des divers mémoires ou des récits qui seront donnés, soit dans nos
Proceedings, soit dans le Journal, soit dans un recueil scientifique quelconque,
ces indications décimales ; car, en les classant par fiches, on aura ainsi une
excellente bibliographie, qui, si l'on prend soin de se tenir au courant des
choses publiées, sera rapidement abondante.
Mais je ne puis qu'effleurer le sujet ; j'espère pouvoir lui donner prochaine
ment toute l'extension qu'il mérite.
L.] La Métapsychique. 13
aussi, au titre de science psychique ; et cependant elle ne fait
pas partie du cercle de nos études. Elle a son histoire, ses
traités didactiques, ses professeurs, son enseignement, à ce point
qu'on l'enseigne même dans les gymnases.
Repoussons aussi le mot de sciences spiritiqxws, plus mauvais
peut-être encore que les précédents ; car l'hypothèse des esprits,
malgré sa simplicité un peu naïve, et la grande vogue qu'elle
a acquise à l'heure présente, n'est pas, dans l'ensemble, recevable.
Alors je vous proposerai une expression nouvelle—avec quelque
timidité, comme il convient quand on se hasarde à un néologisme—
c'est celle de sciences métapsychiqv.es.
Vous savez tous quelle extraordinaire fortune a eue le
mot métaphysique. Il s'agissait, dans l'œuvre d'Aristote, de
dénommer les chapitres qui suivaient les chapitres consacrés
aux sciences physiques, et alors, tout naturellement ils furent
appelés chapitres métaphysiques, c'est à dire suivant les chapitres
de physique. De même, semble-t-il, nous pourrions à cette
science nouvelle, dont nous prévoyons le rapide essor, dont
nous avons déjà les premiers linéaments fragmentaires, donner
le nom, en somme assez simple, de métapsychique (fiera Ta
.^fvj^iKa). Evidemment, si cette métapsychique n'existait pas,
il serait absurde de créer un mot nouveau pour une erreur.
Mais je ne crois pas, malgré toutes les crédulités aveugles
qui ont compromis cette science, qu'il soit possible de nier
tous les faits. Et la meilleure preuve que je puisse donner
de ma conviction à cet égard, c'est précisément que je
propose un mot, le mot de métapsychique, pour les phénomènes
qu'elle est appelée à établir.1
Si donc vous acceptez, au moins provisoirement, le mot
de Traité de métapsychique, pour ce livre que nous espérons,
1 Ces lignes étaient écrites quand j'ai appris que le mot de métapsychique
était moins nouveau que je ne le croyais. A l'issue de l'adresse que je
présentai à la S. P.R. le 6 février 1905, M. Wincenty Lutoslawski vint
nie trouver et m'annoncer, à ma très grande surprise, qu'il avait appliqué
le mot de métapsychique à peu près de la même manière. En effet,
dans un de ses ouvrages ( Wyklady Sagiellonskie, t. IL, 1902, Krakow, XXIII.)
se trouve cette phrase (qu'on traduit du polonais) : "Je nomme métapsychique
cette partie des recherches psychologiques qui traite des phénomènes anor
maux de la conscience individuelle, phénomènes étudiés récemment, surtout
par la Soc. for Psychical Research." Mais, comme on voit, j'ai donné une
bien plus grande extension au mot Métapsychique, en comprenant sous ce
terme tout ce qu'on appelait jusqu'à présent sciences occultes.
14 M. Cluirles Richet. [part
nous allons examiner quels en seraient les principaux chapitres,
et comment on pourrait le concevoir. Cet exposé va nous
donner l'occasion de préciser quelles sont les limites de cette
science, ou plus exactement quel est pour elle le vaste champ
à parcourir, presque sans limites.
III.
Vous m'excuserez des détails techniques, parfois un peu
arides, dans lesquels je serai forcé d'entrer. Mais je crois que
notre devoir strict est d'aborder sérieusement les choses
sérieuses, et de faire, de la science qui nous occupe, autre
chose qu'un divertissement littéraire.
Tout d'abord il y aura dans la métapsychique deux parties
bien distinctes, encore que sur les confins, comme toujours, elles
se confondent; à savoir les phénomènes purement psychiques,
et les phénomènes exclusivement matériels.
Sont phénomènes purement psychiques ceux dans lesquels il
ne se décèle aucune mouvement, aucune vibration de la matière.
Ainsi une prémonition, un fait de télépathie, une suggestion
mentale, ne supposent pas l'existence d'une force agissant sur
la matière, tandis qu'un apport, des raps, une matérialisation,
supposent de toute nécessité qu'alors la matière a été mue et
actionnée par une force autre que les forces psychologiques
attribuées à notre être. Dans les phénomènes psychiques il
n'y a aucune objectivité. Tout se passe en mouvements de
l'âme, en sentiments, perceptions, émotions, tandis que, dans les
phenomènes matériels, l'objectivité est complète.
Au premier abord il semble que la distinction soit absolue.
Nullement. Elle est très malaisée à établir dans bon nombre
de cas.
Par exemple, voici une prémonition donnée par des raps.
Les raps sont phénomène matériel ; et je suppose que, dans
le cas actuel, ces raps aient été obtenus sans contact. Au
contraire la prémonition est phénomène psychique. Iaudra-t-il
classer cette observation dans l'un ou l'autre groupe ?
De pareilles difficultés se présentent dans toutes les sciences ;
et il ne faut jamais concevoir nos classifications que comme
des procédés analytiques, commodes pour l'enseignement et
l'étude, mais ne répondant pas à la complexité des phénomènes.
L-] La Métap&ychique. 15
Un phénomène, lorsqu'il se produit, ne se préoccupe pas de
savoir s'il va rentrer dans la physique, ou la chimie, ou la
psychologie, ou la mécanique. C'est un phénomène, voilà tout ;
et cela lui suffit. Mais pour la facilité de l'exposition nous le
faisons rentrer dans les cadres plus ou moins artificiels que
nous avons établis ; et nous devons nous résigner d'avance à
considérer notre classification comme inadéquate à la réalité
des choses.
Pour en revenir à l'exemple cité, nous dirons que, dans
cette prémonition par raps, il y a un double aspect au phé
nomène ; 1°, le côté mécanique, matériel (vibrations de la
table) ; 2°, le côté psychique, intellectuel (prémonition). L'étude
des raps doit être faite à part, comme celle de tous les phé
nomènes matériels, en tant que phénomènes matériels. Mais un
chapitre spécial dans l'étude des raps doit être consacré aux
phénomènes psychiques, intelligents, qui se révèlent par le
moyen des raps, et qui par conséquent leur donnent une signi
fication psychologique.
Prenons une comparaison qui rendra plus claire cette disso
ciation d'un phénomène unique en apparence. Voici un
message téléphonique qu'on se propose d'étudier complètement.
Il faudra donc faire deux études séparées ; d'abord analyser
tout ce qui est la mécanique même de la transmission ;
l'appareil récepteur, les fils conducteurs, la vibration des plaques
téléphoniques, etc. Ce sera l'étude physique du téléphone.
L'étude psychologique viendra en second lieu. Il faudra alors
examiner ce qui a été dit dans le message même, la portée et
la signification des paroles qui ont été prononcées. Et il
parait bien qu'une distinction complète entre l'acte mécanique
produit, et la signification intellectuelle, morale, de cet acte est
facile à instituer.
Dans d'autres conditions encore les phénomènes psychiques
et matériels sont en partie confondus. Un fait de télépathie
est le plus souvent exclusivement subjectif. Toutefois, dans
quelques très rares récits, il est dit que la mort d'une personne
éloignée a été annoncée à plusieurs personnes à la fois, par
une apparition ayant tous les caractères de l'objectivité, de
sorte qu'il n'est guère possible alors de dire que le phénomène
a été seulement psychique.
On pourrait multiplier les exemples, et je crois bien que
16 M. Charles Richet. [part
l'incertitude grandira à mesure qu'on approfondira l'étude de
ces choses. Mais, au fond je ne crois pas que la difficulté soit
insurmontable ; et je persiste à penser que ces deux grands
chapitres fondamentaux de la métapsychique peuvent être con
servés (A) phénomènes matériels. (B) phénomènes non
matériels.
Maintenant vous m'excuserez si, passant en revue les uns
et les autres, je fais une excursion rapide dans le vaste do
maine de la science qui nous intéresse. Je serai forcément très
incomplet ; et je ne pourrai donner qu'un résumé, très som
maire. Mais même ce résumé, trop bref, nous permettra de fixer
l'état de la Métapsychique aujourd'hui, en 1905. Je m'imagine
que, dans quelques lustres, nos petits neveux le liront avec
quelque curiosité, pour rire de notre ignorance, et s'étonner
de nos étonnements.
En tout cas—et je tiens à ce qu'il n'y ait sur ce point
aucune méprise—le fait de mentionner tels ou tels ordres
de phénomènes, et de les faire rentrer dans un cadre commode
à un exposé didactique, n'implique nullement que je croie à
leur réalité. Je n'en parle que pour tenter une classification
d'ensemble, et nullement pour affirmer leur existence. D'ail
leurs les phénomènes que je vais tenter de classifier sont, pour
la plupart, plus surprenants que démontrés. Et, si je me
hasarde ainsi à parcourir ce vaste domaine de la science
métapsychique, c'est que nulle part peut être, elle n'a été,
même en résumé, traitée dans son ensemble, comme je vais
témérairement essayer de la faire devant vous.
IV.
Ce qui caractérise les phénomènes matériels, c'est qu'alors
des forces physiques naturelles sont mises en jeu ; lumière,
mouvement, vibrations sonores, forces qu'on ne peut expliquer
par une émotion de la conscience: car il se produit alors évidem
ment un dégagement de force matérielle qui s'extériorise, qui
peut être enregistrée par un appareil, et dont la réalité peut
être constatée par des procédés rigoureux de contrôle.
A priori on peut admettre que ce dégagement de force n'a
rien d'invraisemblable ; car les forces de la nature, connues de
nous, ne sont rien à côté des forces inconnues. Nous pouvons,
L.] La Métapsychique. 17
et même nous devons faire ce dilemme très élémentaire. Ou
nous connaissons toutes les forces de la nature: ou nous ne
les connaissons pas toutes. Or l'hypothèse que toutes les forces
de la nature nous sont connues est tellement absurde qu'il
suffit de l'énoncer pour en établir l'absurdité. Ce qui est
invraisemblable, et radicalement invraisemblable, c'est que nulle
force physique n'échappe à nos sens, et qu'il n'existe pas de
vibration que nos chétives sensations ne nous aient jusqu'à pré
sent révélée.
Donc l'existence de forces inconnues agissant sur la matière
est possible, vraisemblable, rationnelle. Mais le problème qui
se pose n'est pas de savoir si ces forces sont possibles et vrai
semblables ; car la question est jugée, et bien jugée. Il s'agit
de les constater et de les démontrer d'une manière irréfutable.
La tâche paraît d'abord facile. En réalité elle est d'une
difficulté extrême.
Prenons pour exemple le phénomène matériel le plus simple ;
la vibration d'une table sans contact. Il semble que ce soit là
vraiment le phénomène mécanique élémentaire. Un grand
nombre d'observateurs, et de bons observateurs, affirment avoir
été témoins de ce fait. Combien cependant cette affirmation
trouve-t-elle de contradicteurs ? On oppose la supercherie,
l'obscurité, le défaut d'attention, les mouvements musculaires
inconscients, les craquements du bois, dus à l'humidité ou à la
chaleur ; les déplacements des tendons (Schiff), et autres allé
gations qui sont aussi invraisemblables que le phénomène
lui-même. Pourtant il y a eu, dans d'innombrables séances
métapsychiques, raps, ou déplacements d'objets, ou mouvements
de la table. Cela ne paraît guère douteux. Même si, en
exagérant quelque peu les scrupules de la rigueur scientifique,
on élimine les cas, authentiques cependant, où les séances
ont eu lieu dans l'obscurité, il restera encore un bon nombre
de séances, tenues en demi-lumière, ou en pleine lumière, pen
dant lesquelles on a entendu des vibrations dans le bois d'une
table que personne ne touchait, vibrations que le hasard et
l'humidité n'ont pas pu produire.
Si je n'avais pas pris le parti de fester aujourd'hui dans des
généralités, je pourrais vous rapporter à ce sujet d'assez nom
breuses expériences personnelles. Peut-être, quelque jour, si vous
le permettez, aurai-je l'occasion de vous faire le récit de mon
B
18 M. Charles Richet. [part
expérimentation sur les raps : mais de tels protocoles d'expéri
ences ne valent que par le détail ; et les détails à développer
sont si abondants que leur exposé méthodique me mènerait beau
coup trop loin. Je me contenterai donc de vous dire que,
selon moi, le phénomène des raps sans contact, toute réserve
faite quant à leur cause, me paraît un fait certain.
Il est d'autant plus important à établir, ce fait, que mille faits
négatifs ne prouvent rien contre un seul fait positif. Supposons
qu'une seule fois, en des conditions reconnues irréprochables,
il y a eu vibrations (intelligentes) dans une table, que personne
ne touchait et ne pouvait toucher, c'est assez pour que le fait
existe, défiant toute critique, et inattaquable. Cent mille
expériences négatives ne prouveront rien contre ce fait unique,
s'il a été dûment établi. Or vraiment, si nous voulions analyser
ce qui a été écrit à ce sujet depuis les expériences de Sir
William Crookes jusqu'à celles de J. Maxwell, pendant trente
ans, dans les livres et journaux de sciences métapsychiques, nous
ne serions pas embarrassés pour trouver trente ou quarante
cas de raps bien nettement perçus par tous les assistants, en
pleine lumière, sans contact avec la table. Probablement, dans
cette réunion, il ne se trouve pas un seul auditeur, ayant assisté
à quelques séances, qui n'ait eu l'occasion, au moins une fois
dans sa vie, de constater dans de bonnes conditions ce phéno
mène, et d'être convaincu de sa réalité.
Si ces sortes de vibrations moléculaires des corps n'ont
pas pris rang encore dans la science classique, c'est que la
science classique est, à juste raison, très sévère, très exigeante
en fait de preuves. On ne peut la blâmer de cet excès de
sévérité. Mais, ce qui est moins à son honneur, c'est qu'elle
s'est contentée de juger—et de nier—sans expérimenter sérieuse
ment, de telle sorte qu'elle n'est guère qualifiée pour apprécier
des faits qu'elle n'a point voulu étudier.
Au fond cette hésitation de la science ne doit pas nous
surprendre ; car il faut pour l'étude de pareils phénomènes un
peu plus qu'une patience ordinaire; un peu plus même que
la patience du savant, qui est proverbiale. Tout d'abord on
doit se dégager des anciens préjugés, se contenter, au début,
d'expériences mal faites, incertaines, que l'on peut graduelle
ment rendre moins fautives, mais qui aux commencements se
produisent dans des conditions absolument défectueuses. Et
L.] La Métapsychique. 19
alors il faut que le savant dépouille le vieil homme, comme
on dit, se contente d'expériences imprécises, au début, avec
la ferme volonté de les rendre peu à peu de plus en plus
rigoureuses ; de sorte que, pour mener à bien cette progres
sion, ce n'est pas moins de quinze séances, au bas mot, qui
seront nécessaires. Mais combien sont-ils, les médecins,
chimistes, mathématiciens, ingénieurs, qui ont pendant quinze
séances expérimenté avec un vrai médium, reconnu comme
tel, et qui ont formulé, à la fin, une conclusion défavorable ?
S'ils ont eu le courage d'entreprendre ces expériences, ils n'ont
pas eu le courage, après quelques échecs, de continuer : et
leur patience a été bientôt lassée.
Quelques uns cependant ont poursuivi, sans se laisser
rebuter, et alors, il faut bien le reconnaître, ils ont fini par
être convaincus. L'histoire de la métapsychique est pleine
de conversions de ce genre. Seulement ces conversions ne
se produisent pas brusquement. Ce n'est pas la lueur ful
gurante qui, en quelques secondes, éblouit pour toujours
l'apôtre Paul sur le chemin de Damas. C'est une lente et
progressive conquête, disputée aux doutes, aux retours en
arrière, aux angoisses, aux défectuosités expérimentales, aux
suspicions peut-être. Je puis en parler par ma propre expé
rience. Cette route n'est pas un sentier de fleurs. Elle est
semée de pierres, et de ronces ; et, quand on l'a parcourue, on
regrette parfois de s'y être engagé, de ne pas avoir pris le
parti, plus sage et plus lâche, d'accepter l'opinion commune,
et de sommeiller dans la crédulité naïve et aveugle des
spirites, ou dans le dédain solennel et négateur des savants,
ou dans l'indifférence satisfaite et apathique de l'immense ma
jorité du troupeau humain.
Revenons aux phénomènes matériels : et concluons qu'ils
existent. Il n'y a pas là de quoi mettre en péril la science
contemporaine. Déjà un premier caractère différencie ces
forces matérielles métapsychiques des autres forces maté
rielles connues. Elles sont intelligentes. Et alors tout de
suite apparaît un redoutable problème. Sont-elles humaines
ou extra-humaines ?
Pour ma part, je l'avoue sans crainte, je ne vois à priori
aucun motif scientifique pour repousser l'intervention d,'êtres
intelligents, autres que l'homme. L'hypothèse de puissances
20 M. Charles Richet. [part
intellectuelles, évoluant autour de nous, dans cette immensité
mystérieuse de la nature, n'est ni invraisemblable, ni impos
sible. Mais ce n'est pas sur ce terrain de la possibilité
ou de la vraisemblance qu'il faut placer la discussion.
L'hypothèse est possible, assurément: il s'agit de savoir si elle
est nécessaire.
Or jusqu'à présent cette nécessité ne me paraît pas évidente :
car les limites de l'intelligence humaine, et des forces matérielles
ou psychiques qu'elle dégage, n'ont pas été tracées encore. Plus
on approfondit la conscience, plus on y découvre des couches
profondes, inconnues de nous-mêmes ; des consciences sublimi
nales, des personnalités secondes; se superposant, se succédant,
tour à tour, et prenant les apparences de personnalités réelles,
bien distinctes de notre moi.
Et qui sait ce que peut produire la vibration nerveuse ?
Elle produit de la chaleur et de l'électricité. Elle provoque des
actions chimiques. Elle donne une forme matérielle à la pensée.
Pourquoi n'agirait-elle pas sur les objets inertes ? On pourrait
fournir à cet égard bien des arguments, favorables ou contraires ;
mais il ne me semble pas sage d'aborder cette discussion.
Il ne paraît pas que les temps soient murs encore. A\ant
de faire la théorie d'un fait, il faut déterminer le fait lui-
même, et nous serons fidèles à la vraie méthode expérimentale,
en recherchant les conditions d'un phénomène, avant de dis
serter sur sa cause même.
D'autant plus que le phénomène lui-même est bien loin
d'être accepté universellement et reconnu par tous comme
authentique. Alors à quoi bon nous perdre dans les nuages de
la théorie ? Etablissons solidement la réalité des faits, et nous
pouvons être certains que la théorie en sera donnée un jour.
Je me suis étendu sur le phénomène des raps : car c'est le
plus simple des faits matériels de la métapsychique ; mais il en
est d'autres encore, nombreux et variés, plus compliqués
d'ailleurs, dont il convient de faire mention.
1°. Phénomènes mécaniques autres que les raps.
2°. Phénomènes lumineux.
3°. Transports d'objets à distance ou apports.
4°. Autres phénomènes objectifs.
1°. Les phénomènes mécaniques autres que les raps sont très
variés: et on peut les classer en plusieurs catégories.
L.] La Métapsychique. 21
(A) Déplacements d'objets.
De ces déplacements d'objets le plus simple paraît être celui
de la table tournante. Des volumes ont été écrits sur ce sujet.
Mais toute cette littérature ne me semble pas très démonstra
tive; car, dans la plupart de ces expériences, les mains
touchaient la table. Or personne de vous n'ignore que des
mouvements musculaires inconscients, chez des personnes de
très bonne foi, peuvent produire des déplacements matériels
considérables.
Pourtant il y a eu souvent des soulèvements complets de la
table sans contact, ou des mouvements de la table sans
contact. On pourrait faire de très probantes citations de
phénomènes de ce genre ; mais ce serait abuser de votre
patience que d'en entreprendre rémunération, même incomplète.
Ce ne sont pas seulement les tables qui peuvent se mouvoir.
D'autres objets peuvent être déplacés, tantôt plus petits, tantôt
même plus volumineux quune table. De sorte que, tout bien
considéré, l'extériorisation du mouvement, suivant l'expression
heureuse de mon ami A. de Rochas, paraît bien être un
phénomène réel, et dûment constaté.
Cependant ne nous félicitons pas trop. Ce fait n'est pas
encore reconnu par la science officielle ; et des mesures pré
cises n'ont pas été prises encore. Même, hélas ! quand on a
voulu l'enregistrer dans des conditions rigoureuses de contrôle,
des difficultés se sont présentées, toujours renaissantes. Chaque
nouvel appareil scientifique a semblé arrêter le développement
des phénomènes. Les instruments méthodiques ont plus ou
moins échoué, de sorte que les expérimentateurs futurs ont
encore beaucoup à faire. Il s'agit de déterminer les conditions
de ces mouvements à distance. Je dirais même, au risque
de vous paraître quelque peu sceptique, qu'il s'agit d'en
donner une démonstration plus rigoureuse que toutes celles
qui ont été données jusqu'ici.
On voit tout de suite combien nous voilà loin de l'hypo
thèse spirite. Car, s'il était prouvé qu'il y a attraction ou
répulsion des objets matériels par des forces émanant d'un
médium, ce ne serait pas du tout une preuve qu'on puisse
alléguer en faveur de l'existence des esprits.
A vrai dire, pour être équitable, il faut reconnaître que ces
22 M. Charles Richet. [part
phénomènes kinétiques sont bien plus marqués quand on
admet, dans une séance, l'hypothèse spirite. Tout se passe
comme si le médium n'était apte à dégager cette force qu'en
la croyant fournie par une intelligence étrangère.
Je rappellerai ici qu'on a construit des appareils très simples,
dont le principe est le suivant. Un fil de soie porte à l'une
des extrémités une petite tige métallique qui se déplace sur
un cadran gradué. Le tout est enfermé dans un cylindre de
verre, de sorte que les mouvements de l'air ne peuvent dé
placer la barrette suspendue. Cet appareil (magnétomètre de
Fortin) a été employé par H. Baraduc pour déceler le soi
disant fluide vital dégagé par les divers individus, variant
avec chaque personne, variant aussi suivant l'état de santé et
de maladie de ces personnes. Même il paraîtrait, d'après
Baraduc, que la nature morale de chaque individu serait
caractérisée par un spécial déplacement angulaire de cette
petite machine. J'ai à peine besoin de vous dire que les
observations faites par Baraduc sont souvent enfantines, et ne
donnent guère envie de s'engager dans une pareille étude.
Cependant le problème mériterait de tenter les physiciens,
d'autant plus qu'après tout c'est une question de physique.
Quelle est la part des influences électriques, ou thermiques,
que l'approche de la main exerce sur le fil de soie ? La
question est assez ardue ; mais, jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit com
plètement élucidée, il ne sera pas permis de parler du fluide
vital. Il nous faudra de bien d'autres preuves pour admettre
l'existence d'une nouvelle force dans le monde.
{E) Lévitations.
Une autre forme, tout à fait spéciale, des actions mécaniques
d'origine métapsychique, ce sont les lévitations.
Dans les vies des saints les lévitations ont été souvent
racontées. Mais ces récits de miracles sont sujets à caution ;
et nous devons être très réservés à ce sujet.
Toutefois, de nos jours, il est difficile de nier qu'il y a
eu des lévitations authentiques. Tout en attribuant une pro
digieuse habileté aux magiciens de l'Inde, on ne peut guère,
en présence de certaines narrations précises, douter que quel
ques fakirs aient pu s'élever au dessus du sol. N'ayant
rien vu d'analogue, je ne puis à cet égard émettre une
t.] La Métap&ychique. 23
opinion qui ait quelque autorité : je constate seulement qu'on
aurait le plus grand tort de ne pas examiner de très près
les allégations que des témoins judicieux nous apportent.
Un officier de marine français, assez sceptique, et nullement
porté au mysticisme, m'affirmait récemment avoir vu un fakir
s'élever de quelques centimètres, lentement, au dessus du sol ;
et cela, en plein jour, sans vêtements, sur le grand chemin.
Dans la vie de Douglas Home, se trouvent aussi relatés
de nombreux cas de lévitation, attestés par des témoins de
moralité et d'intelligence irréprochables. On a peine à supposer
qu'ils ont mal vu et mal observé un fait si facile à observer
et à voir. Dira-t-on que D. Home a réussi à les tromper
ainsi cinquante fois et davantage ? En vérité, s'il ne s'agissait
pas d'une science expérimentale où l'expérience doit être
répétable, et si le témoignage humain était suffisant, les
preuves de la lévitation de D. Home seraient surabondantes.
Mais nous devons être pour la métapsychique plus sévères
que pour une science historique. Nous la voulons expéri
mentale, non traditionnelle, et nous ne nous lasserons pas
de demander l'expérience après le témoignage ; né nous esti
mant satisfaits que si les conditions de la lévitation peuvent
être précisées, et si cet extraordinaire phénomène peut être
enregistré par des appareils scientifiques.
(C) Ecriture directe.
Avec l'écriture directe, obtenue sans qu'il y ait contact
entre la plume écrivante et le médium, nous avons une
série de phénomènes plus étranges encore. Naturellement, si
déjà il y avait quelque hésitation à affirmer la lévitation,
l'incertitude est plus grande encore pour affirmer l'écriture
directe. En effet, peu de médiums seraient capables de la
produire ; et la fraude est relativement facile.
Il faut donc soumettre les cas observés à une critique
sévère, et provoquer de nouvelles expériences.
(D) Autres phénomènes mécaniques.
(a) Maisons hantées.
Il paraît que de grands phénomènes mécaniques se pro
duisent dans les maisons hantées. Mais l'histoire des. maisons
hantées est presque légendaire, et il est fort malheureux
24 M. Charles Richet, [paet
que, malgré bien récits, bien des discussions, finalement il
ne reste pas grand chose de définitivement établi. Si la
solidité des preuves était en rapport avec l'intensité des
bruits, rien ne serait plus certain que la hantise des maisons ;
car il s'y produirait des fracas effroyables. Mais il ne faut
pas se laisser étourdir par tout ce tapage ; et, comme pour
la lévitation, comme pour l'écriture directe, nous devons dire
que sub judice lis est.
(/S) Vibrations vocales.
On a prétendu que parfois des voix se faisaient entendre,
accessibles à plusieurs personnes, soit dans les maisons hantées,
soit dans certaines séances de matérialisations.
(y) Empreintes ; moulages, contacts.
Le plus souvent, quand des matérialisations se produisent,
ce ne sont que des phénomènes lumineux ; mais on a rap
porté quelques cas d'empreintes de moulages laissés par ces
formes matérialisées. Malheureusement les exemples qu'on a
cités n'ont rien de bien démonstratif, et, dans quelques cas,
il semble bien qu'il y a eu fraude, puisqu'on a trouvé dans
l'empreinte reçue les traces d'un léger tissu dont les mailles
s'étaient imprimées sur l'argile.
Cependant je ne conclurai pas négativement ; car dans
bon nombre de cas, en des conditions bien rigoureuses, des
contacts de mains ont été perçus.
S'il est vrai que des formes lumineuses se sont montrées
à des expérimentateurs, il est alors tout aussi vrai que ces
formes pouvaient exercer une action mécanique extérieure.
La même force qui a produit une lumière peut tout aussi
bien exercer une action mécanique de contact. En fait,
beaucoup de spirites affirment avoir touché les mains de
ces fantômes, et dans les récits de séances il est souvent
question de mains, grandes ou petites, chaudes ou froides,
avec bagues ou sans bagues, sèches ou humides. Je me doute
bien qu'il y a dans ces récits imagés une grande part d'illu
sion, et je sais qu'il est très difficile d'être absolument sur
que les mains du médium sont solidement tenues de manière
à éviter toute fraude. Mais, quand on est bien averti
qu'une fraude est possible, on prend toutes les mesures néces
saires, de sorte que tout n'est pas erroné peut-être. Donc,
L.] La M&apsychique. 25
fiddle a mon principe d'etre aussi reserve dans la negative
que dans 1'affirmative, je ne preiendrai pas que des actions
mecaniques ne puissent etre excretes par des forces ayant
apparence humaine. Si elles ont revetu les formes et les
mouvements d'un homme qui vit, pourquoi n'exerceraient-
elles pas les memes forces mecaniques que 1'homme vivant ?
Ces diffeYentes manifestations de forces occultes (que nous
appellerons maiutenant, si vous m'y autorisez, me"tapsychiques),
sent peut-etre sans relation entre elles. Nous les groupons
provisoirement sous la denomination commune de forces mecani
ques. Mais il n'est pas certain qu'elles relevent de la me'me
caase. C'est par ignorance peut-etre que nous les rangeons dans
nn liii'inc chapitre : et 1'avenir peut fort bien nous prouver
qu'elles sont profondement dissemblables, et sans lien re"ciproque.
2°. La second groupe des phenomenes materiels comprend les
phe"nomenes lumineux ; c'est a dire la production de lumieres,
de lueurs, de fantomes. En proce"dant du simple au com-
plique, nous avons successivement :
1°. Lumieres et lueurs informes.
2°. Formes lumiueuses, plus ou moins distinctes.
3°. Formes lumineuses bien distinctes, et materialisations
completes.
Four se rendre compte de 1'extreme difficulte a emettre
une affirmation ou une negation formelles, je me contenterai
de rappeler 1'etonnante histoire des rayons N.
II y a peu d'anne"es un savant physicieii de Nancy, le
professeur Blondlot, decouvrit que divers corps emettent des
rayons qui different des rayons electriques ou thermiques; et
il appela rayons N ces nouvelles vibrations. II put meme
en donner les constantes physiques et les longueurs
d'onde. Puis, poursuivant ses recherches, il montra que ces
rayons ont la propriete de renforcer la luminosite" du sulfure
de calcium. Avec d'eminents collaborateure, M. Charpentier,
M. Bichat, M. Meyer, professeurs a Nancy, il fut amene" a
constater que les centres nerveux, et les muscles (quand ils
se contractent), degagent des rayons N ; car une plaque re-
couverte de sulfure de calcium devient avec plus d'intensite"
phosphorescente quand on 1'approche du cceur, ou de la tete ;
de sorte que tout phe'nomene vital, une pensee, comme une
contraction musculaire, serait une source de rayons N.
26 M. Charles Riclœt. [part
Voilà donc des phénomènes constatés par des physiciens
et des physiologistes dans des conditions d'expérimentation qui
paraissent faciles, puisque il n'est pas besoin des complications
qu'exige toute séance de métapsychique, et que la présence d'un
médium n'est pas nécessaire. Eh bien ! malgré cette facilité
apparente, la preuve des rayons N n'a pu être donnée en
core. Et des savants distingués doutent de leur existence.
Il est possible que les rayons N n'existent pas, même dans
les objets inanimés, la où M. Blondlot avait cru les trouver,
de sorte que le monde des physiciens connaît maintenant
les angoisses d'incertitude qui avaient semblé jusque là réservées
aux seuls adeptes des sciences occultes ; et qu'il se partage
en deux groupes : celui qui croit à l'existence des rayons
N, et celui qui n'y croit pas.
On multiplie les expériences, on accumule les preuves, on
prend des photographies de l'étincelle électrique, du sulfure
de calcium phosphorescent, et cependant le doute subsiste
encore. Les journaux scientifiques sont remplis de discussions
qui s'engagent sur un phénomène dont la constatation se
présente comme très simple ; et finalement ces rayons N
sont si vigoureusement et universellement contestés que même
ceux qui avaient eu d'abord le plus de confiance dans les
affirmations de M. Blondlot sont forcés de suspendre leur
jugement et d'attendre ; encore que, selon toute vraisem
blance, M. Blondlot n'ait pas commis cette colossale erreur.
Cet exemple est bon à méditer ; car il nous prouvera h
quel point un fait nouveau est parfois difficile à établir quand
les méthodes d'investigation et de contrôle sont incertaines.
Si les hésitations sont telles pour un fait d'ordre pure
ment physique, comme la phosphorescence du sulfure de
calcium par l'action des rayons N, combien ne sont-elles pas
plus légitimes encore quand il s'agit d'affirmer l'existence
de lumières, de vapeurs lumineuses, de formes matérialisées ?
Tout concourt à entourer l'expérience de mystère. D'abord
le phénomène ne peut être provoqué que par un petit
nombre de personnes. Rares sont les médiums ; plus rares
encore les médiums qui donnent des matérialisations. On
ne peut ni les toucher ; ni s'approcher d'eux ; ni déranger
le cours de l'expérimentation par de brusques contrôles. Une
demi lumière est indispensable, parfois même l'obscurité.
u] La Métapayckique. 27
Toute modification du plan préparé arrête la manifestation
attendue. Le médium s'épuise vite, et l'expérience ne peut
se refaire qu'à d'assez longs intervalles.
Il semble, à voir toutes ces complications, que l'étude des
rayons N ne soit que jeu d'enfant, à côté de l'étude des
lumières et des fantômes.
Vous ne serez donc pas surpris si, malgré les éclatantes
affirmations d'observateurs sagaces et dignes de foi, malgré une
abondante série de preuves, que les journaux spirites ont
accumulées, nous pensons que notre jugement doit être réservé.
Mais cette réserve peut s'interpréter de deux manières bien
différentes ; et en effet deux observateurs, ayant une opinion
diamétralement opposée, peuvent, s'ils sont sages, rester l'un et
l'autre dans la même réserve. Même c'est leur devoir à tous
deux de réserver leur jugement. Le premier croit que le phéno
mène existe ; que les preuves sont nettes, que les phénomènes
observés sont convaincants ; le second, au contraire, pense que
la supercherie et l'illusion jouent le principal rôle dans ce
qu'il a vu ou cru voir, comme dans les récits qui lui ont été
rapportés. Et alors ces deux hommes, que je suppose sages
l'un et l'autre, reconnaîtront, l'un qu'une affirmation absolue
est quelque peu téméraire ; l'autre, qu'une négation formelle
est impossible, sans nouvelles expérimentations.
Pour ma part, si vous me permettez d'indiquer l'opinion
vers laquelle je penche, je serais tenté de croire à la réalité
de ces formes lumineuses, de ces lueurs, de ces matérialisa
tions. Car j'hésite à prétendre que ce qui a été vu et décrit
par R. Wallace, par William Crookes, par 0. Lodge, par A.
de Rochas, par bien d'autres encore, tout cela ne fut que
supercherie, fraude et illusion. Et d'autre part j'ai cru voir
dans de bonnes conditions, en des séances—dont le détail ne
peut être donné ici—des phénomènes analogues. Voilà pour
quoi, en présence de ces faits, ma réserve—et une réserve
dont je tiens à faire ici la formelle affirmation—est plutot
une réserve favorable.
Assurément la production de forces lumineuses, de fantômes,
de formes matérialisées, n'est pas de certitude aussi grande
que la composition de l'ammoniaque, ou la loi des oscillations
du pendule ; mais il me faudrait une bien désespérante
série d'expériences négatives pour me forcer à rejeter comme
28 M. Charles Richet. [part
légendaires et définitivement erronés les phénomènes lumineux
objectifs de la métapsychique.
D'ailleurs qu'importe ? Qu'on y croie ou qu'on n'y croie pas,
au fond la conclusion doit être la même ; c'est que de nou
velles expériences sont nécessaires. Même les sciences qui
semblent achevées sont dans un état de perpétuelle évolution
qui nécessite sans cesse de nouvelles recherches. A plus forte
raison alors pour les sciences à peine nées, embryonnaires
encore, comme la nôtre, où tout est inconnu, méthodes et
fins dernières ; où toute affirmation des faits les plus simples
est à la fois téméraire et incertaine.
Avant de terminer ces courtes paroles relatives aux appari
tions fantomatiques, il faut tenter de distinguer ce qui en elles
est objectif et ce qui est subjectif. Dans le chapitre consacré
aux faits matériels, nous n'avons pas fait allusion à ce que
vous avez, avec Fr. Myers, appelé hallucinations véridiques.
Car dans ce cas il est probable que nul phénomène matériel,
dans le sens vulgaire du mot matériel, ne s'extériorise. La per
ception, à distance, d'une mort ou d'un danger, ou d'un
événement, se traduit dans l'esprit du voyant par un phéno
mène visuel. Il croit voir ou entendre quelqu'un ou quelque
chose. Mais probablement c'est par la pensée qu'il voit, de
sorte qu'il symbolise sa pensée en une forme matérielle exté
rieure. Aussi les cas, nombreux et authentiques, où une vision
véridique a été constatée, ne doivent ils pas être classés parmi
les phénomènes matériels. Il faut, pour parler de leur
matérialité, que l'apparition (ou la lumière) soit perçue par plu
sieurs personnes, ou qu'elle ait déplacé des objets, ou qu'elle
ait impressionné une plaque photographique.
Puisque je prononce le mot de photographie, il me semble
que c'est à obtenir des photographies irréprochables que nous
devons tendre. De même que M. Blondlot et M. Charpentier
l'essayent en ce moment pour les rayons N, de même nous
devons pour les matérialisations faire tous nos efforts afin d'en
obtenir des images, qui soient le souvenir indélébile et le
témoignage impérissable du phénomène. Je ne sais vraiment
pas pourquoi, maintenant que la photographie est à la portée
du premier écolier venu, les expérimentateurs n'emploient pas
davantage ce procédé de contrôle, qui est si simple, et qui
entraînerait la conviction.
L.] La Métapsychique. 29
Si nous possédions vraiment quelques photographies prises
dans des conditions de certitude absolue, toute discussion devien
drait inutile, et la preuve serait faite. Mais, par malheur,
jusqu'à présent, ces photographies irrécusables n'existent pas.
Peut-être en est-il qui n'ont pas été publiées encore ; mais,
s'il faut se contenter de celles qui ont paru daus les livres,
journaux et revues, elles n'entrainent pas la conviction.
Il est d'ailleurs assez remarquable que les images photo
graphiques de fantômes—je ne parle que de celles qui ont
été publiées—prêtent largement à la critique ; car les person
nages ont des apparences de mannequins ou de poupées ; de
sorte que c'est pour le public qui les regarde un sujet de
facile raillerie. Mais cette apparence de fraude ne nie touche
guère, et ce n'est pas là dessus que porteront mes objections.
J'admets fort bien qu'une matérialisation ne puisse revêtir
nettement les apparences d'un être vivant, et qu'elle ait forme
de poupée ; car, en vérité, nous ne savons rien des conditions dans
lesquelles un fantôme apparait sur une plaque photographique.
Donc, si la photographie a été prise sur une plaque marquée à
l'avance, si cette plaque a été développée par l'expérimentateur
lui-même, savant de bonne foi incontestée, sans que cette
plaque ait jamais, pendant un seul instant, quitté ses mains,
alors, sans que cela me trouble beaucoup, j'accorderai à l'image
fantomatique toutes les apparences qu'on voudra, de poupée
ou de mannequin, à condition, bien entendu, qu'on puisse
plusieurs fois répéter cette expérience. Mais précisément le
manuel opératoire de ces photographies spirites est confié à
des praticiens peu scrupuleux, et ils ont toutes facilités pour
faire les manipulations nécessaires à la production d'une image
parasite juxtaposée au personnage principal.
Puisque notre Société, dont l'autorité est si grande, a des
ressources notables, il me paraît que c'est surtout vers des
constatations photographiques que nous devrions diriger nos
efforts. Après tout le métier de photographe n'a rien de bien
difficile, quand on ne cherche pas à obtenir des chefs d'oeuvre
artistiques, mais seulement un contrôle documentaire, perma
nent, de ce que nos yeux ont rapidement perçu. Donc,
chaque fois qu'un cas nous est signalé où il y a eu des
lumières, des apparences lumineuses, des matérialisations visibles
à tous, il faudrait aussitôt en recueillir la photographie, et cela
30 M. Charles Richet. [part
avec toutes les précautions nécessaires pour que pas un doute
ne puisse s'élever sur l'authenticité de la plaque.
Si la certitude expérimentale est absolue, peu nous impor
tera alors que l'image soit dramatique ou non : il suffira qu'une
tache blanche quelconque, non imputable à une erreur de
technique, apparaisse sur la plaque; car c'est une question
d'intérêt secondaire que d'obtenir des formes ayant ap
parences humaines. Nous devons borner nos désirs à de plus
modestes constatations : une lumière, si vague qu'elle soit, nous
suffira, pourvu que ne soient pas vagues les conditions dans
lesquelles elle a été recueillie et fixée. Ce ne sont pas les
phénomènes les plus extraordinaires et les plus compliqués
que nous devons rechercher ; mais ceux qui sont le plus
rigoureusement observés. Notre grand effort doit tendre à
obtenir des faits, élémentaires peut-être, mais des faits aux
quels on ne puisse rien reprocher.
Si les photographies authentiques ne sont pas plus abondantes,
c'est probablement parce qu'on n'a pas daigné, bien à tort,
essayer d'enregistrer de simples stries lumineuses. On a voulu
probablement attendre que ces lueurs aient pris l'apparence
d'une personne humaine. Car on avait toujours l'espoir que
cette image humaine, reproduite par la photographie, serait
une preuve de la survivance. Mais j'oserai dire qu'il faut
reléguer au second et même au troisième plan ces aspirations,
d'ordre non scientifique, vers la survivance de la per
sonnalité humaine. Attachons nous seulement à ceci, qui est
probable, quoique encore contestable ; qu'autour de certains
rares médiums, dans des conditions particulières, il se forme
des vibrations lumineuses, que la rétine humaine peut perce
voir, et que la plaque photographique peut enregistrer.
Plus tard il ne sera pas interdit d'aller plus loin, et ce
n'est pas moi qui conseillerai la timidité aux expérimentateurs.
Mais la sagesse conseille de commencer par le commencement.
Quand on construit un édifice, on se préoccupe d'abord de lui
donner des bases solides, et on ne va pas mettre de décora
tions au chapiteau et au fronton, quand les assises mêmes,
sur lesquelles repose le temple, sont encore branlantes.
Nous conclurons donc que, pour tous ces phénomènes lumi
neux, ces fantômes, ces apparitions, il faut, de parti pris, aban
donner les récits sensationnels, et faire comme les physiciens
L.] La Metap&ychique. 31
devant un difficile probleme de physique ; c'est a dire s'occuper
de ce qui est simple, e"liminer les causes d'erreur et les com
plications, ramener le probleme a sa forme elementaire.
Y a-t-il, par la force que dfyagent les mediums, production
de vibrations lumineuses ? Si oui, on peut le constater par
la photographic, et la voie de la recherche a, suivre est tout
indique"e.
3°. Un des plus curieux chapitres a eerire sur les pheno-
menes materiels, c'est celui qui a trait aux apports,
transports, penetrations de la matiere. Je ne vois aucune
impossibilite a de pareils faits. Les re"centes et troublantes
experiences relatives au radium nous prouvent que le vieux
dogme de 1'increabilite de la matiere est peut-etre errone, de
sorte que je ne me refuse nullement a priori a, admettre que
des apports puissent exister.
Mais de la a conclure qu'ils existent, il y a loin, et je ne
crois pas etre trop timide en disant que tout ce chapitre de
la metapsychique mate"rielle (mutations et transports de la
matiere) est 1'incertitude meme.
Dans les phe"nomenes objectifs nous devons faire rentrer
encore :
4°. Les odeurs intenses survenant immediatement, comme
il en est souvent cite dans les experiences de Home ou de
Stainton Moses.
5°. L'action des fluides vitaux (?) ou des passes mag-
netiques, ou de 1'aimant, sur les organismes sains et normaux.
Par ces cotes la science metapsychique est aux confins de
la physiologic me'me, mais d'une physiologic bien incertaine
encore. Une experience—plus extraordinaire peut-etre que
tous les recits les plus extraordinaires—est racontee par
Home. II pouvait prendre dans sa main, et sans se bruler,
un charbon incandescent. Que faut-il penser de ce fait pro-
digieux ?
L'aimant exerce-t-il une action sur les organismes, comme
1'a pretendu Reichenbach ?
Les phenomenes d'extase, d'hibernation humaine; les enseve-
lissements de fakirs par exemple, sont-ils reels ou apocryphes ?
Et quant & 1'action sur 1'evolution des maladies, il a ete
dit, que, me'me en dehors de toute suggestion, il y a influence
du fluide magn&ique humain sur les organismes vivants.
32 M. Charles Richet. [PART
Ainsi, par exemple, on aurait gue>i de tres jeunes enfanta
par 1'imposition des mains.
Tout cela n'est que 1'indication des chapitres qu'on aurait k
4crire ; et n'implique nullement 1'opinion que les phenomenes
sont redls. Je veux dire seulement qu'ils meritent 1'etude.
Je ne pretends pas qu'ils soient vrais ; je dis seulement qu'ils
peuvent 1'e'tre ; car il faut se me"fier des negations a priori, et,
si extraordinaire que nous semble 1'influence d'un medium ou
d'un magnetiseur sur I'evolution d'un phenomene morbide, il
serait te"meraire d'assurer que cette influence est impossible.
V.
Tels sont a peu pres, si je ne me trompe, les principaux
phenomenes objectifs de notre science. Nous arrivons a la
seconde partie ; c'est a dire a la metapsychique subjective.
Ici les methodes doivent etre toutes difterentes, car il ne
s'agit plus de constater des phenomenes materiels, mais bien
des faits psychologiques.
Un parallelisme interessant se presente tout de suite entre ce
qui est subjectif et ce qui est objectif. De me"me que nous
avons fait rentrer, par definition meme, dans la metapsychique
objective, les faits que les forces physiques actuellement connues
et classe"cs ne peuvent expliquer, de meme vont ressortir de la
me"tapsychique subjective tous les phenomenes de connaissance
que nos process ordinaires de connaissauce ne permettent pas
•d'expliquer.
Les connaissances de 1'homme de'rivent de sensations et de
raisonnements. Nous sommes par nos sens en relation avec le
monde exterieur; nous pouvons a la suite de ces sensations
conclure, raisonner, induire, de"duire ; et nulle connaissance du
monde exterieur ne peut, d'apres la science classique, deliver
d'autres proce"des d'information.
Par exemple je puis connaitre la mort de Pierre, parce que
je la vois, ou parce qu'on me la raconte ; ou encore parce
que, le sachant tres malade hier, je peux conclure avec presque
certitude qu'aujourd'hui il est mort. La connaissance que
j'ai de la mort de Pierre sera un phenomene mental simple,
que des sensations ou des deductions rationnelles expliquent
"'•me maniere adequate. Mais, si, ayant laisse" tout a 1'heure
L.] La M&apsychique. 33
Pierre en parfait e"tat de sante, sans qu'aucun danger le
menace, et me trouvant trop loin pour le voir on 1'entendre,
je viens tout a coup a affirmer que Pierre est mort, au
moment meme ou il est frappc'- par un coup imprcvu, alors il
s'agira d'un phenomena de metapsychique ; puisque aucune
sensation, aucun raisonnement ne pourront expliquer la con-
naissance de ce fait.
Nous definirons done les phenomenes me"tapsychiques sub-
jectifs, des connaissances qui ont d'autres origines que nos
perceptions et nos raisonnements ordinaires.
Si j'insiste sur ces definitions, c'est que souvent des con
fusions s'e"tablissent, dont le point de depart est une incerti
tude dans la definition meme. Pascal, qui s'y connaissait,
declarait que la science est une langue bieu faite. II est
done bien important de pre"ciser tous les termes qu'on emploie.
Alors cela nous conduit tout de suite a discuter ce point
fondamental. Existe-t-il pour Intelligence humaine des con
naissances ayant d'autres origines que nos perceptions et nos
sensations ? Toute la question est la, et, si nous re"pondons
par 1'affirmative, il s'ensuivra qu'il y a une metapsychique
d'ordre subjectif.
II est vrai qu'on parle souvent du hasard, comme jouant
un grand role dans ces " soi-disant connaissances. Mais je
crains fort que les sceptiques, qui, lorsque nous leur racontons
une experience, viennent nous objector qu'elle est due & un
hasard heureux, n'aient guere re"fle"chi sur le hasard et le cal-
cul des probabilites.
Je tiens a discuter ici, tres brievement, cette influence du
hasard ; car on le fait intervenir a tort et a travers, et on
s'abandonne a bien des fantaisies, des qu'on parle des proba-
bilites.
Quand un chimiste fait une pese"e, il ne songe jamais que
le hasard a pu lui donner le chiffre qu'il obtient. Assure"ment
il a pu se tromper en comptant les poids qui sont sur la
balance ; ou il a eu affaire a un produit impur ; ou il s'est
servi d'une balance deTectueuse ; en un mot il a pu faire une
mauvaise experience, mais ce n'est jamais par hasard que tel
ou tel chiffre a ete" trouve". Et alors notre chimiste ne se
preoccupe pas du hasard, et il a raison ; car, a trouver un
nombre qui est seulement de trois chiffres, la probabilite"
c
34 M. Charles Richet. [part
d'avoir tel chiffre plutôt qu'un autre par le fait du hasard est
de j-^j, c'est à dire tout à fait négligeable.
Que, dans une expérience de lucidité, ou de télépathie, avec
un jeu de cartes ; on dise une première fois la carte pensée ;
la probabilité est de ^. Certes le hasard peut donner ce
chiffre ; mais que deux fois de suite la carte pensée soit
indiquée, alors la probabilité devient très faible „ 710 4 ; et, quoique
le hasard puisse encore donner ce chiffre, il ne le donne, pas.
Implicitement on reconnaît cela, quand on n'est pas aveuglé
par le désir de trouver un défaut à des expériences irrépro
chables ; car, dans la pratique quotidienne de la vie, on ne fait
jamais intervenir ces probabilités faibles. Si vous jouez à
l'écarté avec un individu qui quatre fois de suite retourne le
roi, vous serez tenté de supposer qu'il triche ; car la probabilité
40198 de retourner le roi quatre fois de suite est très faible.
Donc quand, dans des expériences de typtologie, un nom
est obtenu, le nom de Marguerite par exemple, même si
l'on ne tient compte que des quatre premières lettres, la
probabilité d'avoir Marg. . . est de ^"4 soit 3 - 018 „ 5 ; c'est à dire
extrêmement faible. Si, jouant à l'écarté, vous avez devant vous
un adversaire qui retourne le roi six fois de suite, vous serez
tenté de quitter la partie, bien persuadé, que ce n'est pas le
hasard qui lui a fait avec cette persistance obtenir l'heureuse
carte, qui le fait gagner.
La probabilité, pour chacun de nous, de n'être plus vivant
dans deux heures est moindre que la probabilité d'obtenir le mot
de Marguerite en tirant au hasard les lettres de l'alphabet.
Et cependant nous passons notre existence à supposer que
nous serons encore vivants dans deux heures : et nous avons
raison.
C'est pour ne pas avoir suffisamment réfléchi à ces problèmes
qu'on objecte le hasard. Résolument je repousse cette objec
tion, car elle n'est fondée sur rien, et elle est contraire à
toute la tradition scientifique. Objectez, si vous voulez, les
défauts de l'expérience—et vous aurez, hélas ! presque toujours
raison—mais ne parlez pas de hasard ; car pour un expéri
mentateur il n'y a pas de hasard.
Ce n'est pas le hasard qui rend incertaines nos expériences
de métapsychique subjective; c'est notre défectueuse méthode
d'expérimentation, car nous ne savons pas tenir compte suffi-
L.] La Metapsychique. 35
samment d'un phenomene psychologique d'essentielle importance,
trop souvent meconnu, la memoire inconsciente.
II y a eu de ce fait tant de graves erreurs qu'il convient
de nous expliquer formellement a cet egard.
Autrefois la memoire etait considere"e comme une faculto
intellectuelle tres simple. II est des faits dont on se souvient,
d'autres dont on ne se souvient pas : par consequent la limite
est nettement traoe"e entre les reminiscences et les creations
mentales. D'un cote, des choses que 1'on a connues et qui
reparaissent : de 1'autre des choses qu'on ignore, et qu'on con-
struit par 1'imagination et le raisonnement.
Mais 1'etude approfondie de 1'hypnotisme a eu, entre autres,
ce pre"cieux avantage de nous faire connaitre toute une
serie de phenomenes bien singuliers sur la memoire, et de
nous reveler que la memoire est une faculte implacable de
notre intelligence ; car aucune de nos perceptions n'est jamais
oubliee.
Des qu'un fait a frappe nos sens, alors, de maniere irre
mediable, il se fixe dans la memoire. Peu importe qu'il
puisse etre evoque a notre gre : peu importe que nous ayions
garde la conscience de ce souvenir ; il existe, il est indelebile.
II va s'unir et se combiner a d'autres perceptions egalement
inconscientes ; et il peut, dans certains etats mentaux parti-
culiers, reparaitre en son integrite, alors que, s'il fallait en
croire le temoignage de notre conscience, toute trace semble
en avoir a jamais disparu. Mais non ! II n'a pas disparu. II
dort en nous, completement ignore de nous.
En un mot, la conscience oublie souvent; I'intelligence n'oublie
jamais.
Cette memoire inconsciente, subliminale, pour employer
1'heureux mot de Fred. Myers, est toujours e"veillee, attentive,
perspicace. Elle se mele a tous nos sentiments, a toutes nos
volontes, k tous nos actes ; elle agit, pense, raisonne ; elle con-
stitue un veritable moi, mais un moi inconscient, qui a, sur le
moi conficient, cet avantage inappreciable de ne jamais laisser
perdre la plus petite parcelle de ce que les choses et les
hommes, dans le cours de notre existence, nous ont apporte".
On voit combien sont graves les consequences de cette per-
sistance des souvenirs. Nous avons tous, les uns et les autres,
—surtout ceux dont la vie est deja a son dedin—lu, vu,
36 M. Charles Richet. [PABT
entendu, tant et tant de choses qu'il est impossible, malgre" la
surete de notre memoire, d'affirmer que nous n'avons pas a tel
ou tel moment lu telle phrase, entendu telle parole, assiste a
tel evenement. Aussi peut-on, en parfaite bonne foi, certifier
que ce que nous pensons, en ce moment me'me, est une creation
mentale, et non un souvenir; car non seulement nous ignorons
1'avoir su, mais me"me nous ne comprendons pas comment nous
avons pu le savoir. Si nous pouvions contempler cet immense
amas de souvenirs dont notre me"moire inconsciente est la
vigilante gardienne, nous serions veritablement stupeTaits ; car
nous trouverions, dans ces images qui ont fixe" tout le passe
de notre existence, des tre"sors absolument ignores.
Aussi bien les phe'nomenes de soi-disant lucidite" ne sont
ils souvent que des souvenirs ; et, quoique la personne lucide
affirme, en toute since"rite", et avec tout 1'e"nergie d'une bonne
foi ardente, qu'elle ne savait rien, ce n'est pas assez pour que
nous affirmions sa lucidite". II faut que la preuve nous soit
donne"e qu'il lui a e"te" absolument impossible d'avoir jamais
rien su du fait qu'elle affirme. Ignorer aujourd'hui n'est rien ;
il faut prouver qu'on a toujours ignore". Si 1'on e"tait plus
severe a constater cette impossibilite d'avoir su autrefois, on
eliminerait beaucoup de phe"nomenes, de merveilleuse apparence,
explicables tres simplement par la re"viviscence de souvenirs
que la conscience avait totalement oublies.
Bien entendu, en e"tablissant cette discussion, je ne pretends
rien dire qui ne soit parfaitement connu de tous les psycho-
logues. Ce sont meme des verity's tres banales ; mais dans
1'interpre"tation des faits de lucidite^ on les a negligees si
souvent qu'il faut insister sans cesse sur cette cause d'erreur.
Abordons maintenant la classification des phenomenes sub-
jectifs. Nous les envisagerons en eux-memes, sans rechercher
quel a e"te" leur mode de production, sans nous demander s'ils
derivent ou non de phe"nomenes mate"riels. Certes, quand un
phenomene materiel, tel que les raps, est la cause immediate
d'un beau phenomene psychique de lucidite, 1'expe"rience est
doublement interessante ; mais 1'analyse scientifique doit dis-
socier ce phenomene unique, et examiner separe"ment la
materialite des vibrations me"caniques (raps), et le sens des
paroles prononceea (message).
C'est ce dernier point seulement que nous e"tudierons a
r i
L-] La Metapsychique. 37
present, puisque plus haut nous avons examine le cote objectif
et materiel des phenomenes.
II me parait que tons les phenomenes subjectifs peuvent
recevoir la classification suivante :
(1) LueidiU, c'est a dire connaissance de faits que les pro-
cedes ordinaires de connaissance n'ont pas pu apporter.
(2) Personnification, c'est h dire affirmation d'une person-
N.-iliti' autre que celle du medium, et avec des
caracteres ve"ridiques, que ni la perspicacite ni les
souvenirs ante"rieurs ne peuvent donner.
(3) Langages Grangers, totalement inconnus.
(4) Premonitions.
Je passerai en revue ces divers phenomenes.
(1) LucidiU.
La lucidite—ou clairvoyance—est le phe"nomene subjectif
elementaire. A ce titre elle me"rite toute notre attention.
On peut meme dire que tous les phenomenes subjectifs, quels
qu'ils soient, pourraient etre compris sous le nom ge"ne>ique
de lucidite.
Nous diviserons la Iucidite en deux classes qui parfois se
confondent, parfois se dissocient. A. La luddiU UUpathique.
B. La liicidiU non t&dpathique.
La lucidite telepathique, c'est ce qu'on appelle souvent la
transmission ou la suggestion mentale ; autrement dit la con
naissance plus ou moins nette par la conscience A des e"motions
d'une conscience voisine B, sans qu'il y ait e"videmment de phe-
nomene exterieur appreciable qui puisse reveler a A 1'emotion
de B.
Au contraire la Iucidite" non te1e"pathique s'exerce sur des
choses inconnues de toute personne vivante, de sorte que la
conscience A a connaissance de faits qu'aucun homme ne peut
connaitre.
Chacune de ces deux varies de Iucidite peut se produire
expe"rimentalement ou fortuitement.
Mais—ce qui est assurement tres malheureux—la Iuciditt5
exp<5rimentale est un chapitre beaucoup plus court et beaucoup
plus incomplet que la lucidite" fortuite, occasionnelle.
Evidemment je laisse de c6te ces soi-disaut experiences
de transmission mentale dans lesquelles il y avait contact :
38 M. Charles Richet. [part
comme dans le jeu du Willing game, si répandu dans les salons,
qui a passé dans les séances de cirque et de café concert, où
un individu très naïf tient la main du soi-disant lucide. Dans
ces cas, soit le contact de la main, soit la manière de marcher,
de respirer, de s'arrêter, soit les interpellations et les physio
nomies des spectateurs, dirigent la sagacité du voyant bien
suffisamment pour qu'il soit inutile d'admettre autre chose
qu'une habile interprétation des mouvements inconscients.1 Pour
qu'il y ait vraiment lucidité, il faut que nul phénomène exté
rieur ne se produise, qui puisse renseigner l'opérateur. Par
conséquent il ne faut pas qu'il y ait contact. S'il y a contact,
tout devient incertain, et je récuse formellement toutes les
expériences faites devant un auditoire crédule et ignorant, dis
posé par avance à admettre les balivernes qu'on va lui présenter.
Aussi, en éliminant ces très nombreuses et très peu
démonstratives expériences, ne restera-t-il que quelques rares
comptes rendus où la lucidité expérimentale a pu être tant
bien que mal établie.
C'est peu. C'est trop peu ! Donc nous devrions faire tous
nos efforts pour combler cette grave lacune, car la certitude
expérimentale est d'un ordre plus élevé que la certitude em
pirique, et, tant que la lucidité ne sera pas établie par une
assez longue série d'expériences méthodiques, rigoureuses, devant
des observateurs qui gardent un silence et une impassibilité
absolues, la lucidité restera un phénomène contestable.
Si la lucidité expérimentale est incertaine, d'autre part la
lucidité empiriquement constatée parait solidement établie.
Mais il me parait ici nécessaire de préciser en quoi l'empirisme
diffère de l'expérimentation.
Prenons l'exemple de la lucidité se révélant par le moyen
de l'écriture automatique. On sait que certains sujets peuvent
écrire des mots, des phrases, parfois même de longues pages,
sans avoir aucune conscience de ce qu'ils écrivent. Or deux
cas peuvent se présenter : dans le premier cas une demande
est faite par les assistants. Ce sera par exemple la question,
suivante : quel est le frère de Marguerite ? Si une réponse est
donnée alors par écriture automatique, ce sera un cas de
lucidité expérimentale.
1 II y a sur ce chapitre intéressant de physiologie psychologique toute une
littérature abondante qu'il et inutile de mentionner ici.
L.] La Métapsyckique. 39
Dans l'autre cas au contraire on laisse le médium écrire
ce qu'il veut, sans lui rien demander, et il écrit. Robert est
le frère de Marguerite. C'est de la lucidité empirique, car il
ne s'agit pas de donner une réponse à une question posée ;
mais bien de dire, sans question posée à l'avance, quelque
chose qui est conforme à la vérité, (et ne peut être connu
par les voies ordinaires de la connaissance).
Or le plus souvent la réponse à une question demandée,
question qui exige une réponse précise, n'est pas donnée. Le
plus souvent le médium écrit, par l'écriture automatique, des
phrases qui témoignent peut-être de sa clairvoyance, mais qui
portent sur les matières qu'il a choisies lui-même, et ne ré
pondent nullement aux questions qui lui ont été adressés.
Assurément, dans un examen, un professeur ne se conten
terait pas de ces procédés évasifs. Un étudiant, à qui l'on
demande : que savez-vous de l'hydrogène ? doit répondre sur
l'hydrogène. Et les juges seraient mal disposés pour lui, s'il
leur parlait alors des combinaisons du mercure. Mais il faut
probablement traiter les médiums autrement que des candidats
qu'on interroge. Certains écrits automatiques, quoique ne
répondant pas aux questions qui ont été faites, fournissent des
témoignages éclatants de lucidité. On demande : quel est le
frère de Marguerite ? Si le médium répond : le grand père de
Marguerite s'appelait Simon ; ce peut être encore une très
bonne preuve de lucidité au cas où l'on réussit à prouver que
le nom du grand père de Marguerite a été en toute certitude
absolument inconnu du médium. Mais, dans ces cas de réponse
évasive, il faut toujours exercer une perspicacité vigilante; car
la conscience subliminale, si elle peut choisir l'objet de sa
lucidité, va inventer des supercheries qui peuvent prendre une
extension redoutable.
L'analyse approfondie devient alors d'une difficulté extrême ;
et toute règle générale est inapplicable. Chaque cas va exiger
une étude minutieuse, détaillée, sagace, pénétrante, et c'est en
désespoir de cause, après avoir bien établi l'impossibilité d'une
acquisition par les voies connues, qu'il faudra se résigner à
admettre la clairvoyance.
Combien mille fois serait préférable une expérience faite
avec un simple jeu des cartes ? mais il semble, hélas ! que les
médiums—on les forces intelligentes qui les animent—aient
40 M. Charles Richet. [part
peu de sympathie pour des expériences aussi abstraites que
des probabilités mathématiques. Les phénomènes émotionnels
les inspirent davantage.
Même ce ne sont pas seulement les médiums, c'est
encore le public, le commun du vulgaire, qui est coupable, car
il est frappé par des expériences dramatiques, plus que par
des expériences algébriques. La lucidité qui fera dire exacte
ment la valeur d'une carte d'un jeu de 52 cartes, est plus
démonstrative, au point de vue rigoureux de la science, que la
soi-disant lucidité qui fera dire le nom de la maladie dont
est mort le père de mon grand père il y a soixante ans.
Pourtant l'émotion sera plus grande, et la conviction plus
forte, si un médium nous dit qu'il y a 60 ans le père de
notre grand père est mort d'une fluxion de poitrine, que si
nous prenons sur 52 cartes une carte au hasard—un trois de
pique, par exemple—et que ce même médium nous dise : c'est
un trois de pique que vous avez pris.
Il me semble toutefois que les savants devraient être d'une
mentalité un peu différente de la mentalité vulgaire, et je me
permets de vous exhorter à tenter, plus souvent que cela n'a
été fait, et en dépit des médiums eux-mêmes, ces expériences
de lucidité expérimentale abstraite.
De fait, à mesure que les phénomènes émotionnels sont plus
intenses, plus dramatiques, si je puis dire, les cas de lucidité
deviennent plus abondants, plus remarquables.
Je le répète, au point de vue scientifique pur, c'est re
grettable, car les savants ne seront pas disposés à l'indulgence
pour une science qui est d'autant plus riche en faits qu'elle
s'éloigne davantage de la précision scientifique. Mais vraiment
nous ne pouvons guère changer la mentalité des médiums, et
nous sommes forcés d'accepter les choses comme elles se
présentent, sans avoir la prétention de forcer les lois d'un
monde profondément inconnu, à obéir à notre ignorance.
En effet les plus beaux cas de lucidité sont peut-être ceux
dans lesquels un phénomène grave, apte à provoquer une
violente émotion, la mort d'un parent ou d'un ami, a été
connu par une vision fantomatique. Des récits si nombreux
ont été recueillis dans Phantasms of the living, dans le livre
de C. Flammarion, dans nos Bulletins, dans les Annales des
sciences psychiques, et dans les journaux spéciaux, que la preuve
L.] La Métapsychique. 41
aujourd'hui n'est plus à faire. C'est un fait avéré, aussi bien
établi que la chute d'une météorite, et malheureusement aussi
difficile à provoquer à point donné par une expérience.
Nous faisons rentrer ces hallucinations véridiques dans les
phénomènes généraux de lucidité, encore qu'ils en diffèrent
par le caractère même de cette hallucination qui a une apparence
objective. Mais, sauf quelques cas, d'interprétation très difficile,
il parait bien que ces fantômes sont tout à fait subjectifs. Ils
ne sont vus que d'une seule personne ; ils ne se fixent pas
sur la plaque photographique ; ils ne déplacent pas les objets
extérieurs.
Aussi la réalité matérielle de ces visions est elle très
improbable.
Puisque la vision n'est perçue que par une seule personne,
c'est qu'il n'y a pas de matérialisation, pas de lumière, pas de
fantôme ... et cependant il y a quelque chose, puisque le
percipient a connaissance d'un fait réel.
Ce quelque chose n'est pas une forme matérialisée : cest
un phénomène extérieur, une vibration quelconque, perceptible
à une seule personne, et même perceptible suivant une modalité
dont la nature nous est profondément inconnue.
Je n'ai assurément pas la prétention de la pénétrer. Pourtant
il est bien permis de se demander pourquoi le percipient voit
une forme humaine, matérialisée, avec chapeau, canne et lorgnon.
N'est-il pas probable que toute cette objectivité donnée par le
percipient à son hallucination est symbolique ? La connaissance
d'un fait pénètre dans l'intelligence du percipient. Par
quelles voies, peu importe : toujours est-il que le percipient a
connaissance d'un fait, la mort de A, par exemple, et le fait
qui soudainement se révèle à lui se présente alors aussitôt
sous la forme symbolique d'une image.
Ce n'est qu'un symbole, car il n'y a pas de mouvement
matériel extérieur, perceptible à nos sens. Mais la symboli-
sation est complète, et A apparait alors au percipient avec
chapeau, canne et lorgnon. Sans doute il ne pourrait com
prendre A autrement, et il extériorise sa perception intérieure,
après qu'elle s'est produite à lui suivant une formule qu'il ne
peut définir et qu'il est forcé de traduire par une image
visuelle. Le fait abstrait de la mort de A prend la forme
d'un fait concret. L'idée devient une image visuelle, et le
42 M. Charles Richet. [part
fantôme de A, quelque apparente que soit sa forme au per
cipient, n'est que le symbole d'une perception dont la nature
est profondément mystérieuse.
Cette opinion est d'autant plus vraisemblable que l'halluci
nation véridique n'est pas toujours visuelle. Elle est souvent
auditive. Des paroles sont entendues qui révèlent le fait
que A est mort, et ces voix sont tout aussi symboliques que
le fantôme de A.
Puisque je vous parle des symboles, je puis vous en rapporter
ici un assez curieux exemple, qui m'est personnel. Dans une
expérience faite avec un médium, il s'agissait d'un phénomène
de clairvoyance : trouver le nom de la personne qui, à ce
moment précis, loin du médium même, conversait avec moi.
Le choix du la personne en question fut par moi tiré au sort,
sans que cela pût venir, en toute certitude, h, la connaissance
du médium, parmi vingt personnes différentes. Le probabilité
était donc de 1/20. Or ce jour-là le médium, étant seule
chez elle, vit une forme humaine, bien caractérisée par le nom
de Henri. Mais, en même temps, devant sa porte se tenait
un héraut d'armes, avec hallebarde, souliers à rubans, et tricorne
galonné, empêchant les autres esprits de venir dans la chambre ;
car ils se précipitaient pour entrer, et il ne fallait pas qu'une
confusion s'établît entre eux et Henri.
N'est-il pas évident que tout ce petit drame n'a aucune
réalité ; et qu'il n'est qu'un symbole ?
Mais c'est le symbole de quelque chose qui est réel, et le
mystère n'en reste pas moins tout aussi profond, car ce n'est
ni le hasard, ni une excitation pathologique qui provoquent
de pareils phénomènes. Ils sont en rapport étroit avec un
fait vrai ; ils sont donc véridiqnes, correspondant au danger ou
à la mort de A. La lucidité s'exerce par des voies absoluement
inconnues de nous : mais le fait d'ignorer ses modalités ne
doit pas nous entrainer à la nier.
Quelques uns de nos amis émettent à cet égard une opinion
que je ne puis guère partager. Ils croient que tout est expliqué
et simple quand on a dit suggestion mentale, émotion provoquée
chez B par une émotion de A. Les deux consciences vibre
raient à l'unisson, pour ainsi dire, et il suffit que A pense à
quelque chose fortement, pour qu'aussitôt B se forme le même
concept.
L.] La Mtta/psychique. 43
Mais, si nous allons au fond des choses, nous verrons que
la suggestion mentale n'explique rien. C'est un mot commode
qui masque notre radicale inconnaissance des choses. Qu'on
1'appelle encore UUpathie, c'est un mot heureux, que je
suis tout pret a adopter, a condition qu'on reconnaisse que,
pas plus que suggestion mentale, il ne nous fournit une ex
plication, me'me approximative, du phenomene. Nos intelli
gences ne sont pas des miroirs dans lesquelles viennent se
refle"chir les vibrations des intelligences voisines ; et je ne
comprends en aucune maniere que les angoisses de 1'agonie,
frappant 1'intelligence de A, aillent provoquer 1'image de ce
meme A dans 1'intelligence de son ami B, qui sommeille
tranquillement dans son lit, a vingt kilometres de la maison
de A. De quelque nom qu'on appelle ce fait, il est myste-
rieux, ignore" ; ignore quant a sa cause, ignore quant a son
essence, ignore" quant aux conditions de sa production. Et le
mystere ne me paraitra pas beaucoup plus grand si A peut
lire sans 1'ouvrir une lettre cachetee que la poste vient de lui
remettre.
Autrement dit encore, pour bien fuire saisir ma pensee, ces
mots de suggestion mentale et de te"le"pathie ne nous expli-
quent absolument rien, de sorte qu'entre la clairvoyance tele-
pathique, et la clairvoyance non te1e"pathique je ne peux
vraiment trouver que des nuances. Si les faits relatifs a.
la clairvoyance tele"pathique sont beaucoup plus nombreux
que les faits de clairvoyance non te"lepathique, c'est, je crois,
qu'alors 1'erreur est bien plus facile, et que des indications,
conscientes ou inconscientes, ont ete donne"es, dans les cas de
soi-disant telepathic, par les personnes voisines du percipient.
Mais laissons de cote cette discussion un pen technique, que
je me reproche presque d'avoir abordee, et revenons aux faits
eux memes, c'est a dire a la lucidite" envisaged en soi.
Or, vraiment, apres tous les re"cits des magnetiseurs d'autre-
fois, apres les innombrables comptes rendus des journaux
spirites, apres les faits rapporte"s dans des ouvrages savants et
se"rieux, apres les temoignages historiques et les traditions, il
me parait impossible de nier que la lucidite cxiste.
De meme que, parlant de la me"tapsychique objective, je
vous disais que 1'hypothese de forces naturelles et mate"rielles,
autres que celles qui sont connues de nous, est necessaire ; de
44 M. Charles Richet. [PART
meme, parlant de la metapsychique subjective, je considere
comme necessaire cette hypothese qu'il existe d'autres precedes
de connaissance que ceux qui derivent de nos sensations
normales.
H existe dans la nature des vibrations qui tmeuvent obscurt-
ment nos consciences infe"rieures, ct qui nous rMlent des fails
que les sens normaux sont impuissants a nous apprendre.
Que certains individus, les mediums, soient plus que les
autres humains capables de percevoir ces vibrations, cela
me parait tout a fait certain, mais j'ai peine a croire qu'entre
les mediums et les autres mortels il n'y ait pas de transi
tions. II est bien vraisemblable au contraire que tout etre
humain est (plus ou moins) capable de lucidite". En eft'et, si
les uns et les autres nous interrogeons nos souvenirs, nous
trouverons dans notre existence des vestiges de cette extra
ordinaire et mysterieuse puissance intellectuelle. Qui de nous
n'a pas etc surpris d'apercevoir soudain au de"tour d'une rue
une personne a qui nous venions de penser avec force, que
nous ne rencontrons jamais d'habitude, et a qui nous ue
songeons pas deux fois 1'an ? Je veux bien que de tels
re"cits soient presque toujours trop vagues, trop informes, pour
meriter d'etre publics ; mais pourtant ils ont leur importance,
par leur multiplicite meme, et ils semblent nous prouver que
nous avons tous quelque parcelle de lucidite ; et qu'il faut
faire une part (grande ou petite) dans notre existence intellec
tuelle a ces vibrations inconnues agissant sur notre conscience.
A ces vibrations inconnues il faut probablement joindre les
curieux phenomenes connus sous le nom de baguette divina-
toire. N'ayant pas d'expe"rience personnelle k ce sujet, je m'en
reTere, aux beaux travaux, de si habile et savante critique,
qu'a publies M. Barrett.
Alais je ne puis m'etendre, comme je le voudrais, sur ce
vaste sujet, et j'arrive aux autres phenomenes subjectifs.
(2) Personnifications.
J'emprunte ce terme, qui me parait excellent, k J. Maxwell,
encore que les personnifications, telles qu'elles ont ete" decrites
par lui et par d'autres, puissent etre a la rigueur considerees
comme des varietes de lucidite. Ai-je besoin de vous dire
qu'il vient d'exposer ses idees et ses belles experiences a ce
,
L.] La M&apsychique. 45
sujet dans un livre dont la traduction anglaise va paraitre
dans quelques jours ?
Cette Iucidite avec personnification a un caractcre tout a,
fait special. La personnalite du medium disparait, ou semble
disparaitre. Elle est remplace"e par un autre personnage qui
entre en scene, parle par la voix du medium, e"crit par la main
du medium, donne des raps, en s'affirmant comme une entite
distincte. Le type de ces cas de personnification, c'est le cas
de Mme Piper, si bien etudie par les membres les plus e"minents
de cette socie"te\ entre autres par mon illustre ami, Sir Oliver
Lodge. Mme Piper n'est plus la; mais c'est George Pelham
qui parle, pense et agit a sa place.
Xotre savant collegue M. Flournoy a fait un re"cit pittoresque
et instructif d'un beau phenomene de ce genre, etudie" par lui
avec une extreme perspicacite.
Dans les experiences de Stainton Moses, apparaissent des per-
sonnages, des guides ; Rector, Imperator, et d'autres encore, qui
ont tout a fait les allures d'etres intelligents, avec uue volonte,
une conscience, un langage, des gouts, qui leurs sont propres.
Souvent aussi, dans les experiences de typtologie, des raps
annoncent 1'arrive"e de tel ou tel personnage, qui se nomme,
se caracte>ise plus ou moins, et prend place parmi les assistants,
ainsi qu'une personne humaine re"elle, affirmant ses sympathies,
ses desirs, ses haines, posse"dant son style original, manifestant
tout ce qui est caracte>istique d'une personnalite humaine
nettement determined.
La premiere idee, tres simple, qui se pre"sente alors, est de
croire a la realite de ces personnages; car la bonne foi des
mediums est certaine, et toute 1'adaptation de leur e"tre au
nouveau persounage apparu est d'une saisissante exactitude.
Mais il faut bien se rappeler que, dans certains e"tats de
1'hypnose, il se produit des changements de personnalite" tout a
fait analogues, avec des apparences de ve"racite" au moins aussi
eclatantes. Pourtant, dans les personnifications hypnotiques,
il est bien e"vident qu'aucune personnalite etrangere n'inter-
vient, et que tous les phenomenes ne sont que des adaptations
d'une seule et me'me intelligence humaine.
Je me demande alors si ces personnifications, qui jouent
ttn si grand role dans le spiritisme, ne seraient pas des
phenomenes du me'me genre.
46 M. Charles Richet. [part
Supposons un changement de personnalité (comme dans les
cas d'hypnotisme) avec une certaine dose de lucidité, et alors
nous assisterons aux phénomènes tout à fait étranges de Mme
Piper par exemple, qui, étant devenue George Pelham, connait
les amis, les parents, de ce même Pelham, pense et parle
exactement comme il eût parlé et pensé, s'il eût été là.
C'est une hypothèse un peu compliquée sans doute. Mais
croit-on que l'autre hypothèse, celle de la survivance de George
Pelham, venant, trois ans après qu'il a été enseveli et putréfié,
s'incorporer dans les cellules nerveuses de Mme Piper, soit une
conception simple et pleinement satisfaisante ?
Ile ne nous suffira donc pas qu'on nous dise . . . je suis
John King . . . je suis Chappe . . . pour que nous pensions
avoir affaire à la conscience de défunt John King ou de défunt
Chappe. Je ne vois même pas bien encore comment John
King et Chappe, à supposer qu'il s'agisse vraiment d'eux,
pourraient nous prouver en tonte rigueur leur existence parmi
nous ; car, même s'ils nous adressent par des messages des
paroles qu'eux seuls peuvent transmettre, l'hypothèse de la
lucidité est une porte ouverte à une interprétation différente.
Evidemment, dans ce rapide aperçu je ne peux prétendre
à trancher la question. Je vous signale seulement son im
portance. Car une des bases de la théorie spirite, c'est précisé
ment cette croyance à des entités humaines, survivantes,
revenant sur notre planète, dans notre monde terrestre, et
affirmant leur personnalité.
(3) Langages étrangers.
Les deux derniers chapitres de la métapsychique subjective
se rapportent aux langages étrangers et aux prémonitions.
Des langages étrangers, je n'ai que peu de chose à dire,
car on ne trouve que des bribes de documents à cet égard
dans les livres. Cependant j'ai eu l'occasiou d'assister à un
phénomène remarquable de ce genre, et peut-être quelque
jour aurai-je l'occasion de publier des phrases, même des
pages, qu'a écrites un médium qui ignore absolument le grec.
Mais la discussion d'un tel phénomène doit être très appro
fondie.
(4) Prémonitions.
De même pour ce qui concerne les prémonitions. C'est
L.] La M&apsychique. 47
de tons les faits metapsychiques le plus troublant,
le plus incomprehensible, celui qui confond le plus notre
miserable intelligence humaine. Toutefois on a pu en donner
de remarquables exemples, que le hasard, bien entendu, est
impuissant a expliquer.
Si e"trange que soit le phe'nomene de la premonition, ne
nous laissons pas detourner de la verite par 1'etrangete" des
apparences. II ne s'agit pas de savoir si un fait trouble
notre conception de 1'univers, car notre conception de 1'univers
est terriblement enfautine. La discussion doit s'engager sur
on terrain tout autre, et on aura a examiner s'il existe,
comme je serais tente par ma propre experience de le croire,
des faits anthentiques de premonition.
VI. CONCLUSIONS.
Me voici arrive au terme de cette longue enumeration, que
j'aurais bien voulu rendre plus courte, plus attrayante surtout.
Mais on a fait tant de recherches, on a agite tant de ques
tions, que nous serions inexcusable^ de passer sous silence
tout cet immense labour accompli.
Si grand qu'il ait ete, il est bien moindre encore que
celui qui reste a accomplir. En effet, comme vous avez pu le
constater, bien rares sont les phenomenes de metapsychique
pour lesquels tous les doutes ont ete victorieusement dissipes,
et c'est a peine si nous pouvons conserver comme definitive-
ment acquis deux ou trois phenomenes elementaires, les raps
sans contact, par exemple, et les hallucinations veridiques.
Encore ces faits memes, quoiqu'ils nous paraissent assez bien
prouves, n'ont-ils pas jusque a present penetre dans la science
officielle classique, de sorte qu'il nous faudra de grands efforts
pour leur donner droit de cite.
Voila pourquoi, n'etant pas assures des faits, nous avons ete
si reserves sur les theories.
Ce n'est pas que des theories tres vastes n'aient ete emises.
Mais elles me paraissent toutes d'une cruelle insuffisance.
Nous avons vu qu'il parait vraisemblable que des forces
inconnues agissent soit sur la matiere, pour provoquer certains
phenomenes materials, soit sur 1'intelligence humaine pour
donner la lucidite.
Faire la theorie de ces phenomenes materiels et de cette
48 M. Charles Richet. [PART
ciditd', c'est chercher en quoi consistent les forces qui leur
donnent naissance.
Deux hypotheses se presentent tout de suite a nous. Ces
forces inconnues sont humaines ou extra-humaines.
(a) Si elles sont humaines, il faudrait alors supposer a
notre organisme nerveux la puissance de s'exterioriser par des
mouvements sans contact (telekinesie), et la puissance de
percevoir des phe"nomenes exte"rieurs que nos sensations ordinaires
ne nous ri5velent pas (clairvoyance).
(/3) Si cea forces sont extra-humaines, il faut supposer qu'il
existe dans 1'univers des forces intelligentes pouvant interft'Ter
dans les choses de notre monde terrestre, mouvoir des objets et
agir sur notre pense"e. Cette hypothese comporte elle meme
deux sous-hypotheses bien distinctes selon que ces forces
extra-humaines sont (ft1) des etres (intelligents) completement
difftrents de 1'homme ou (/3") des consciences d'hommes ayant
ve"cu.
Autrement dit ces forces sont soit des ge'nies, des Sainoves,
des e"1e"mentaux, des anges, pouvant communiquer avec les
hommes ; soit des ames humaines ayant quitte le corps, et
poursuivant leur existence psychique apres la decomposition
du corps.
C'est cette derni^re theorie, tres simple, qui est celle des
spirites ; et il est inutile d'insister pour montrer qu'elle souleve
de terribles objections.
Quant a, la theorie qui admet 1'existence d'etres intelli
gents completement diff^rents de 1'homme, elle n'est guere
deTendue que par les the"ologiens pour des raisons qui ne sont
pas d'ordre experimental.
Reste la thcorie qui attribue tout a des forces humaines :
elle est peu se"duisante, et elle ne s'appuie sur aucune preuve
solide.
Nous voici done en face de trois theories egalement invrai-
semblables et irrationnelles, ce qui nous permettra sans doute
d'en proposer une autre.
Mais rassurez vous tout de suite. Elle ne sera ni longue
a exposer, ni difficile k comprendre ; car cette nouvelle theorie,
explicative des phenomenes, je ne la saurais formuler, ne la
connaissant pas, ne prevoyant meme pas ce qu'elle peut etre.
C'est une theorie x que 1'avenir nous revelera.
L.] La Métapsychique. 49
Oui ! je crois bieii que, dans un temps très prochain, après
que de nouveaux faits seront constatés, après que d'habiles
expérimentateurs, aidés par de puissants médiums, auront mis
en lumière des phénomènes qui sont encore ténébreux, nous
serons amenés à modifier si profondément toutes nos conceptions
sur la métapsychique que nous aurons d'autres hypothèses à
formuler que celle des anges, des esprits, ou des effluves humains.
Cette théorie x, inconnue, qui est inattaquable puisqu'on
ne la formule pas, a toute chance d'être vraie, aussi vraie que
la théorie de la sélection était vraie avant Darwin, que la
théorie de Képler était vraie avant Képler, que la théorie
chimique était vraie avant Lavoisier, que la théorie de l'électri
cité était vraie avant Ampère, Faraday, Maxwell et Hertz.
Avant que les découvertes fondamentales de ces sciences
eussent été faites, on n'avait émis que des théories absurdes,
(comme la théorie du phlogistique, par exemple, ou la théorie
géocentrique). La vérité n'avait été ni prévue ni soupçonnée.
Et je crois bien qu'il en est de même pour la théorie de la
métapsychique, théorie que personne, je crois, n'a encore ni
prévue, ni soupçonnée.
Assurément, au lieu de nous décourager, cette constatation
d'insuccès doit nous engager à multiplier nos travaux avec
prudence, audace, patience.
Jusqu'à présent nous ne connaissons que des phénomènes
épars. Le lien qui les réunit nous échappe. Soit. Il ne
nous échappera pas toujours. Un jour viendra où une explica
tion en sera donnée, différente de toutes celles que notre igno
rance a construites. La découverte est peut-être très simple ;
mais il faut bien savoir qu'elle n'a pas été faite encore : car,
quoique plusieurs des phénomènes racontés soient véritables,
toutes les théories qu'on a édifiées sur eux sont ridicules.
Mais ne perdons pas l'espérance. Ayons confiance dans la
science qui nous ouvre des horizons illimités ! Ne savons
nous pas que la science seule diminuera les misères et les
douleurs humaines ? Ne savons-nous pas que l'esprit de
solidarité et de fraternité internationales grandit par l'étude
de ces nobles problèmes ?
Donc, que notre conclusion soit conforme à la devise de
l'homme vraiment digne d'être homme : Laboremus ! Travaillons.

II.
REPORT ON VARIOUS SPIRITUALISTIC PHENOMENA.
By Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor.
I have been asked to write a short paper on some of the
curious and abnormal things I have witnessed during the
time I have interested myself in the investigation of pheno
mena claimed by Spiritualists, not only to be evidence for,
but to have proved the existence among us of discarnate
human beings able to communicate.
The conditions under which these Spiritualistic phenomena
occur are so mysterious and little understood that many
investigators are unable to appreciate their bearing on the
facts observed, and, judging rather by what they think they
should be than by what they are, attribute fraud to mediums
when, in reality, only a misunderstanding exists, on our part,
of the conditions necessary for the production of the mani
festations.
The phenomena above alluded to are of various kinds, but
are frequently divided into two classes, namely :
(I.) Psychical phenomena, including clairvoyance, automatic
writing and speaking, psychometry, pre- and retro-cognition,
etc., and
(II.) Physical phenomena ranging from the spontaneous
movement of ponderable objects to " spirit lights " and material
isations.
In. the first class there need be no evidence of interference
with physical laws as accepted by science; in the second,
no indication of intelligent purpose. But there is a
(III..) Third class, the largest of all, in which purposive
humanlike intelligence manifests itself in intimate connection
with abnormal physical phenomena of every kind. Of this
class, what is called " direct writing " is the best example.
L.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 51
I think there has been an unfortunate tendency to discuss
these classes of phenomena too much by compartments ; I
mean, to discuss psychical phenomena without. mentioning the
accompanying physical manifestations and to lose sight of the
seemingly purposive direction given when physical phenomena
are under discussion.
I will try to illustrate the three classes I have mentioned
by describing half-a-dozen incidents, two of which will, I
think, fall into each class. I shall not attempt to support
what I am about to relate by bringing forward any evidence
other than a statement of my own personal experience. I
have always made notes of what I have witnessed as soon
as possible, nearly always within 12 or 14 hours of the
occurrence.
I will begin with the cases in which the least amount of intel
ligence seems involved, and in which the phenomena observed
might be the result of some obscure natural law set in motion
unwittingly by the sitters. Yet even in these cases, though
the physical occurrences do not in themselves show purposive
direction, they always occur concurrently and contemporaneously
with what looks like intelligent effort and are quite similar
to other phenomena which are found to be intimately con
nected with, and directed by, a humanlike intelligence.
Throughout this paper, except in the one instance indicated,
I use fictitious names, but the real names of the persons re
ferred to are known to the Editor.
On the evening of November 25th, 1886, I visited the house
of a Mrs. Beasley, in Hammersmith, to witness some physical
phenomena said to take place through the mediumship of her
servant, a young girl. The following are the notes I made
at the time, word for word as they were written.
... I found her, her sister Miss S., a Mr. G., who had been at
the second sitting, and another young man sitting round the fire in
bright lamp light. The ladies corroborated by word of mouth what
I had been told in the letters, and Mr. G. confirmed the statements
as far as he was concerned. After a few minutes we proposed to
begin. We arranged the room as follows [see Fig. I.] : Mrs. B.
and others took the ornaments off a small table 3 ft. x 1| ft. which
was standing against the wall and placed it in front of the sofa.
Some one brought up two chairs and placed them at the table, I
52 Lieut-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [part
brought two others which I carefully examined for attachments,
etc., and placed one at the end of the table nearest the door and
one on its right at an end of one of the long sides. These were
the two chairs which were afterwards moved. We placed in
various known parts of the room things in which we hoped to
get raps, and also a chair in the centre of the room clear of every
thing.
Mrs. B. rang the bell for the medium and meeting her at the
door conducted her at once to her seat at the end of the table.
We all sat down in the order shown below. The two gentlemen
seemed quite as keen as I was to examine things. Soon after we
sat down, the table began to rock and some faint taps appeared to
be made on the floor.
We now put out the lamps, but the light from the fire and the
street lamp just opposite the window made the room so light that
we could see everything and, when our eyes got accustomed to the
semi-darkness, each other's features and hands. [I mean that at first
we could see the outline of things distinctly and later on the details
of the hands and faces.] . . .
After this the chairs and things began to be moved. The chairs
on which Miss S. and the medium sat were several times slowly
moved away from the table with the sitters on them, sometimes
at the same moment and sometimes not. When the sitters found
that they could no longer keep their hands on the table, they got
up and took a step forward ; the chairs, however, quietly continued
their movement without quickening it till they rested at points
from 4 to 8 feet from the table, and after a pause returned at the
same pace to their places, when the sitters again sat down. The
medium's chair did not always move away and return in a straight
line ; once it moved as in Fig. II., stopped and had to be brought
back again by hand, and once as in Fig. III. it returned of itself,
following the direction of the dotted line.
These movements of the chairs must have taken place at least
eight times, midst exclamations of astonishment from all of us, one
and another standing up to see better. . . .
I saw the chair in the middle of the room move towards the
fire-place and fall down. . . .
[The manifestations now began to be rough.] We now thought
things were going too far, so Miss S. got up to light the candle
and while she was at the fireplace her chair again moved away
from the table as it had done before. . . .

Jj.\ Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 53
We broke up about 11 p.m. after a most astonishing and satisfac
tory seance.
In common with the two young men I examined the room and
the chairs when the lamp was re-lighted—we found nothing of a
suspicious nature.
I need hardly say that no one was near the chair in the
middle of the room when it moved and fell over, nor had
any one approached it since it was placed there.
The lady in whose house this happened I knew well ;
she had no motive for perpetrating a fraud and was actuated
alone by her great interest in the matter, and the medium
had no opportunity whatever of making arrangements to act
fraudulently.
Without referring to the difficulty of causing the chair in
the middle of the room to move in the direction it did and
to fall over by fraudulent means, I would call attention to the
complicated nature of any appliances necessary to make the
medium's chair move as I have stated it did, and as shown
in Fig. III. These must have been of a nature either to
push it or to pull it. If they were to push it, a rigid rod
several feet long would have been required, and even this
would hardly have been adequate. I need hardly say
that no such rod was used. If we try to consider how
strings could be applied to cause the motion, we shall find
that four separate strings would have to be fastened to
the chair, one to pass over a pulley at c, another over one
at d, and two others which, by being pulled in a sufficiently
divergent direction, might cause the irregular path of the
chair's return.
I would rather, of course, confine myself to cases observed
in the light, but as now I want to quote the case of a so-
called " Spirit Light," we must be content with darkness.
I again quote from my notes verbatim.
On August 8th, 1888, Mrs. Marriett kindly came into town and
gave a seance at the L.S.A. rooms. [It was a dark stance, abso
lutely no light.] The lights [I mean the spirit lights that I saw]
were such as could not have been made by ordinary means. Their
appearance, colour, illuminating power, etc., were such that I have
never seen the like except at stances. They moved rapidly about
54 Lieut-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [part
and were sometimes in a part of the room most remote from the
sitters.
For example. Mrs. Marriett sat at the end of an oblong table,
on her left Mrs. G. [this, I think, was the lady's name], then
Mr. Davis, and then I came along the longer side of the table
with our backs to the entrance door.
During the proceedings Mrs. M. said, "I think a little light is
coming in under the door. Will you, Mr. Davis, kindly push the
mat against the door to stop it ? " Mr. D. got up to do so and
just as he left his chair a light about the shape and size of the
flame of a candle came down from a point about 5 ft. above and
3 ft. to the right of the medium and seemed to settle on the table
in front of his chair. Knowing that he was away and that I
should not touch any one I slowly and very silently stretched out
my hand towards the light as one sees a boy do who wants to
catch a butterfly [see Fig. IV.] The light did not move till my
fingers had nearly closed round it, then it elongated itself and
slipped out between my first finger and thumb, re-took its shape
and floated away to my left, passing quite beyond the circle and
disappearing near the ceiling. I made no remark at the time and
no notice was apparently taken of my action by any one.
In common with other spirit lights that I have seen, this light
seemed to me not to illuminate things as much as a common light of
equal brilliancy would do, but perhaps a very feeble light, when looked
at after the eye has been some time in total darkness, may give an
exaggerated impression of brightness. I felt no heat when the
light was in my hand, nor did I feel the touch of anything.
♦
As they stand, the two cases quoted show no evidence
that human or other intelligence had anything to do with
them, except that they occurred in the midst of other
phenomena which obviously had an intelligent origin.
My next two cases bring the abnormal physical disturb
ances into closer relationship with intelligence.
It was in 1885, and I was without much experience, but
all the more suspicious and all the more careful to guard
against fraud.
We had had a very interesting dark seance at the house of
Mr. Davis. I now quote from my notes :
The seance terminated. . . . Soon we went in to supper, and I
L.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 55
took in Mrs. Harriett [who was the medium]. We went in first,
and I chose which chairs we should sit on. As soon as we sat
down I was again touched on the knee by something, not as far as
I could see by Mrs. M. Then knocks were heard in different parts
of the room, and Mrs. Fuller declared they came also on her
chair. Immediately after they sounded on mine, and I distinctly
felt the vibrations caused by them. I pushed my chair away from
the table so as to be quite clear of every one and about a yard
from Mrs. M., and no nearer any one else. The raps came on the
seat of my chair underneath, and I again heard them distinctly and
felt the vibrations. I put my hand on the place where a rap had
been given a moment before, and a new rap was at once made on
some other part of the seat underneath. This was repeated several
times. Then I said, " Knock on this arm " (it was what I believe
is called a carving chair, with arms), indicating one by placing my
hand on it. The rap was made. "On the other arm," placing a
hand on the other arm. A rap was made at once, felt and heard as
though on the part of the chair indicated. The room was brightly
lighted, and I looked closely that there was a clear space round me.
Mr. Davis said, "It must be some one wanting to communicate
with you. Ask mental questions."
I did so, asking in mind :
" Are you my wife ? " At once one rap was given signifying " No."
"Is it my father?" "No."
Then aloud: "Is it a woman?" "No." "Is it a man?" "No."
"Is it a child?" "Yes." (Three raps.)
After a pause to think who it would be, I asked, this time
mentally :
"Is it my brother?" "No."
"Is it my child?" "No."
I could not think of any one, but noticed that raps at once fol
lowed my mental questions the moment I formed them—a moment
which could not have been known by any one present; indeed they
were all very busy eating their supper, and seemingly taking very
little notice of what I was doing. Mrs. F., who was sitting opposite
to me at table, and who was taking some interest in what was
going on, said, "Let me guess." After a second or two three raps
were given (I have not noted whether these raps were given on her
chair or mine, and I don't remember). I asked her who she had
thought of. She answered, " Young King." I said aloud, " Is it
young King ? " and three raps came on my chair as before. " Will
56 Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [PART
you attend our stance at Sandhurst?" "Yes." "Will you be able
to communicate?" "I don't know" (two raps). "Will you try?"
" Yes." Then I said, " I will repeat the alphabet ; please give a
knock at the letters of your name." I went over the alphabet
aloud. When O was reached a few light hurried taps came, but I
took no notice, and they were repeated when I came to X. Mr. D.
said I had repeated the letters too fast. If the boy was there it
must have all been as new to him as to me, and I can quite
understand his blundering over the alphabet way of communicating.
Here some mind must have directed the knocks on my
chair, and timed them to my mental questions. My failure
to get a name was due, I think, to inexperience, and the
fact that at the time I had strongly in my mind, by mistake,
the name of the communicator's brother, which also perhaps
impaired the result.
" Young King " was the son of a friend of mine who had
met with a fatal accident a few months before.
I remember that before I resumed my place at table I
turned the chair upside down to look for possible electric
connections, but reflecting that I had myself placed the chair
where it stood, I saw that I could not attribute the knocks
that I had heard and felt to transmitted electricity. I
remember also wishing the chair was mine, so that I could
take it into little bits.
Here is another case in which raps, themselves of abnormal
origin, answered questions in such a way as to display intelligence.
In August, 1899, two ladies [whom I will call Mrs. and Miss
Hope] and I had a syance in one of the rooms of my house in
Cheltenham, which has a large window facing westward. The plan
of the room and the arrangement of the furniture is shown in
Fig. V.
Just before sitting down, I placed a zither on a small table at
x near the lamp, but a few minutes after we were seated, thinking
there would be too much light upon it, I shifted it and the table to
a place behind the medium, with a black double table with books on
it between them. No arrangement was made as to how the zither
should be used, and neither of my companions had anything to say
to the place [where] I first put the instrument, or the place I finally
ifted it to. [Towards the middle of the se"ance I asked the spirit]
Scal
V.
L.] Report cm Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 57
" Do you wish the light put out 1 "
"Yes." [Three raps on the table.]
Raps now came on the table behind Miss Hope and on the table
behind that, the one on which the zither rested, as well as on the
instrument itself. These knocks answered questions and " they "
tried to knock where requested, but the " boy " [the communicator
concerned] said he could not, or rather that he feared to twang
one of the strings of the instrument.
In connection with this part of the seance I wish to describe
one moment about which I am clear.
The position of things in the room was still as shown on Fig.
V. The lamp was out but I could see Miss Hope's movements,
if any, because she was between me and the blind facing a western
sky in which, though it was 9.45 P.M., there was still some light
remaining [See Fig. VII.].
Mrs. Hope asks a question which is answered at once by three
knocks on the wood of the zither (the knocks being of the same
speed and semi-softness of sound as those previously heard).
(A) I did not make those knocks.
(B) Mrs. Hope could not have made them.
(1st) Because the answer came too quickly after her question
to give her time to go round me and knock.
(2nd) Because I am sure she did not move from her chair.
(C) Miss Hope did not make them.
(1st) Because they were made out of her reach.
(2nd) Because I watched her and she did not move when the
knocks were sounding.
(D) Miss Hope did not make them by means of a stick or any
thing. Because she did not turn round when I was placing
the table with the zither on it behind her, and consequently
could not tell its exact position, yet each of the 35 or more
raps which were [now and at other times] given on the
instrument was given clearly and promptly with no bung
ling, never once touching a string, " the boy " having said
he would not do so.
I went about the room next day and rapped on all sorts of
things, both with my finger and with the end of a stick which I had
prepared for the purpose of making, as far as possible, the same
sort of sound [as we had experienced], but found that rapping on
the zither gave the only sound which approached that heard the
evening before. The three raps took about H seconds to complete.
58 Lieut-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [part
The arrangement of the table behind the medium is shown in
section on a larger scale in Fig. VI. I carefully made measurements
and believe that the figure is correct to 2 inches as greatest error.
The cross marks the furthest point I could reach with my hand
when sitting in the chair half turning round and stretching over.
It will be noticed that I do not in the picture (Fig. VII.)
show Mrs. Hope's hands on the table, because I want to re
present only what I saw at the instant of time about which I
am speaking. A moment before I had seen them resting on
the table, and a moment after I again saw the"m in the same
place. I was observing to the best of my ability and am
sure, by ear, that the question Mrs. Hope asked came from
my immediate left, and that she did not move from her chair,
and this is an additional reason in my mind to that stated
just now, that she could not have been concerned with the
production of the raps.
I now go on to two cases of the psychical class, in both
of which a communicator claiming to be the discarnate spirit
of a human being spoke through an entranced medium and
truthfully related facts' in a way I do not think can be
explained by any theory of telepathy between the medium
and another ordinary human being, without unreasonably
straining the hypothesis.
In the first case the communication was made through the
paid medium Mr. Peters (I give the real name in this case),
and he is the only paid medium connected with the incidents
described in this paper.
In March, 1S99, I made arrangements with Mr. Peters for
two sittings at the S. P. R. Eooms, then in Buckingham Street.
The medium was entranced and spoken through automatically
in the usual way, but was also used to supplement, by gestures
and mannerisms, what was said. I now quote from my notes :
In my case " Moonstone " said, ..." There is a lady for you,
she is small, fair, oval-faced, good teeth, eyebrows scarcely visible."
This description, as far as it goes, fits my wife, except, perhaps,
the teeth, which, in her case, though perfectly good and sound, were
not quite regular.
The control now changed, and " Redfeather " endeavoured to
L.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 59
procure recognition for the communicator. He said, "She says
you have a picture of her on glass, two of them, they are in a
box." He described the photograph, the position of the sitter, the
dress, etc., going so far as to sit on a chair in the position taken
in the photograph, one to some extent peculiar in that the arms
were crossed in the lap, so that each elbow may be touched by the
opposite hand.
At the seance I could think of no picture on glass in my
possession, and it was not till more than a week after that
I remembered "-that I had somewhere a photograph of my wife
which I took in 1874 on glass. I looked about for it and
at last discovered it in a small tin box in my bedroom ; it
was wrapped in paper, and just as I was unfolding this, my
eye caught sight of a similar parcel in the box ; on examining
this, I found it to be the original negative, the existence of
which had quite passed from my memory.
The position of the sitter in these photographs is quite
the same as that taken up by the medium at the stance
under Redfeather's control, but I could form no mental
picture of the dress from the medium's description. So I
sent the photographs to Mrs. Hope, who had been present at
the se"ance, for her opinion. She says in answer to my letter:
About the photograph there is a great deal that was correct
in the description ; the attitude with the hands folded across
was exactly what he endeavoured to show. Description of the
hands correct, cuffs correct, the "something" down the front of the
bodice, which he tried to explain, is certainly in the picture,
and the brooch ; did he say earrings ? I don't remember, but I
thought so.
The one thing wrong that I can think of was a hair net; was
that suggested or stated by him in the description ? I do not know,
but if given by him it was not correct, but somehow I cannot
help thinking that this is the picture indicated by the clairvoyant.
In this case, if telepathy from my sub-consciousness to the
medium is the explanation, it is curious that of all the
millions of facts which, under the circumstances, my sub
conscious mind must be supposed to contain, this appropriate
one should have projected itself. How was the selection
made ? Not by any conscious effort of mine.
60 Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor. [PART
That the impression received by the medium must have
come from my mind, if from that of any one present, is certain,
for none of the sitters knew my wife, or had ever seen her.
She had passed over 16 years previously and no one in the
world but myself knew anything whatever about the photo
graphs.
The probability of the statement being correct by chance
alone is so remote that it may be neglected.
To my mind this incident is not only evidence of extra-
mundane agency, but points strongly in the direction of
identity.
The final case I will quote is one which occurred lately.
Sitting on February 20th, 1904, in my house at Cheltenham a
communicator calling herself my wife said, through the en
tranced medium :
" Why is Edie always talking about people not doing
enough to help her ? She is very anxious just now, but I
can't see exactly why it is. . . ."
By Edie I knew she meant her sister in Toronto, so I
wrote to my niece Adele, " Edie's " daughter, to ask if any
thing had happened to which this might refer. Her answer is:
P.S.—In just talking the subject over with the girls it suddenly
struck us that on Friday night, 19th of March [February], there
was a general meeting of the "Daughters of the Empire," at which
mother was to be in the chair and speak, etc. On arriving at the
hall she was very much put out, because none of the committee
would go on the platform with her to support her, and also as they
had not provided a programme of proceedings. I wonder if this
could have been what was meant ? She certainly was annoyed.
of
,
tic
ev The se"ance was held on February 20th, and it was only the
day before that my sister-in-law was annoyed as reported.
The 19th of March in my niece's letter is a mistake for 19th
of February, because her letter is dated March 13th. March
19th was not a Friday, whereas February 19th was.
In the previous case it may be surmised that the informa
tion given by the medium was in my unconscious mind, how-
•er little I was aware of it. But in this case—assuming the
•mount of correspondence between the medium's statement and
L.] Report on Various Spiritualistic Phenomena. 61
the facts to be beyond what can be attributed to chance—we
have to consider that no one in the neighbourhood was aware
consciously or otherwise of the facts related, so that unless my
sister-in-law at the other end of the world, or one of her
daughters, is taken to be the agent, the telepathic explanation
must be abandoned.
If it is maintained that she was the agent, then the dis
tance from here to Toronto makes it difficult to believe that
a " telepathic impulse " is any sort of physical radiation ; but
if telepathy is a psychical influence exercised by one mind
or spirit on another in a way we are wholly ignorant of, pro
bably independent of time, space, and " natural law "—the
language of the angels—then the truth-telling information
received by us on the night of the 20th of February last
might have been acquired telepathically by the sub-conscious
ness of the entranced medium, either from my sister-in-law
herself or from some discarnate spirit.
Or, as I think more likely, it was a bit of information with
difficulty acquired, and with difficulty expressed, imparted to
us by my wife when in " control " of the medium's organisa
tion, as an effort towards proving her own identity.

THE LIGHT THROWN ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES
BY THE ACTION OF DRUGS.
BY ERNEST DUNBAR.
PSYCHOLOGY, like every branch of science, must consist largely
in establishing constants and should never under any circum
stances attempt to generalise from variables. The psychological
experiment par excellence must consist firstly in a correct
appreciation of the conditions at the commencement of the
experiment ; and secondly, in an equally careful analysis of
the steps by which the final stage of the experiment is
reached. It is because I believe the actions of drugs on the
mind offer an opportunity for applying scientific methods
that I have taken the opportunity of bringing forward the
subject before the Society.
Those drugs which influence the mind, if taken in sufficient
quantity, abolish consciousness: but before this happens a
variety of incidental effects are produced, according to the
nature of the drug that has been taken. Some of these
effects are constant and occur in all individuals ; others vary
with the peculiar mental characteristics of the individual.
In either case a careful study of the effects would, of neces
sity, throw some light on psychology.
The mere fact that mental processes can be so intiuenced
is noteworthy, and part of the problem must be to find out
whether the changes are radical and complete, or whether
there is not some thread of an unchangeable nature connect
ing a normal condition with an abnormal one.
Many drugs exercise so slow and gradual an action that
it is possible to follow step by step this supplanting of normal
processes by those which are abnormal. Where the difficulty
of the personal equation is most felt is in the fact that
L.] The Action of Druga on Consciousness. 63
although, as often as not, the individual is undergoing the
most profound mental experiences, which he can generally
describe at the time and often remember, yet beyond his
description we have no means of judging of the real nature
of the mental change. As against this disadvantage, it must
be noted that many drugs induce the same conditions in
different individuals and the descriptions they severally give
often tally exactly.
It is now over a hundred years since Humphrey Davy
placed on record his experiences during the inhalation of dilute
nitrous oxide gas. Since that time practically no advance
has been made along this line, and substances of this nature
have simply been regarded from the point of view of their
practical uses.
All medical writers have mentioned the temporary exhilara
tion which at first follows the administration of anaesthetics
and many narcotics, but there has been to my knowledge no
systematic analysis of these primary effects—no attempt
to bring these mental symptoms into the domain of exact
science.
It is only fair at the outset to give some reasons for
supposing that experiments of this kind can ever yield
scientific results : in a word to justify the discussion of the
subject at all.
Let us suppose that under the influence of some substance
the sense of " time " is altered while the consciousness and
reason are still retained. This is actually the case after the
administration of Indian hemp and it shows that the sense
of time is not an invariable constant or an unalterable ac
companiment of consciousness under all conditions, which is a
fact to be taken seriously into consideration in the analysis
of our idea of Time.
Or, again, suppose after an individual has been inhaling
ether for some time and has become conscious of the different
relationship he bears to his environment that he then writes
down statements involving a logical deduction, and that
these statements appear equally logical long after the influence
of the drug has passed off, this would constitute a fairly
valuable fact, which might be made use of in dealing with
the relationship of intelligence to environment. One cannot
64 Ernest Dunbar. [PART
deny that it is possible to go too far in an attempt to generalise
from conditions of this kind, but it seems to me that the
knowledge one gains from these abnormal states is sufficiently
positive to justify an attempt at scientific research.
In attempting an analysis of the primary effects of such a
substance as alcohol we must first note that under ordinary
circumstances consciousness is conditioned by the environment.
This is very well borne out by the fact that, if the field of
sensation be diminished, the greater the diminution, the greater
the tendency for sleep to supervene. Thus in order to secure
sleep there should be the minimum of light and sound ; the
temperature of the bed-clothes should be the same as the body-
temperature, and then, as these sensations disappear, the in
dividual sleeps. To quote Flammarion's flowery language—
" Our attitudes in sleep tend to a passive equilibrium. All
the activities of the senses fade by degrees. The eyelids close
And the eye is soonest asleep. The sense of touch loses its
faculty of perception and then it also sleeps. The sense of
smell disappears in turn. Hearing is the last to disappear,
remaining like a vigilant sentinel to warn us in case of danger,
but at length it also fades away. Then sleep is complete." In
other words, we are no longer conscious of an active environ
ment.
This environment may, for simplicity's sake, be taken to
include not only the immediate surroundings, but also the
memory impressions of previous environments—together with
conclusions drawn by reason from these impressions. In walking
across a room, for instance, the attention is drawn to the spot
to which one wishes to walk, or to obstacles in the way ; at
the same time, the memory impressions of what walking is
like and whether it is safe to walk on a wood-floor, etc., all
come into play in determining the simple action.
Now consider the state of things under the early influence
of alcohol or ether. The environment does not seem to change
in detail. When it does change, it changes en masse. Things
seen and heard are still appreciated in the same proportion
to each other. A gun going off still sounds louder than, a
pop-gun. An electric light still looks brighter than a candle.
Perspective still exists. Moreover the intelligence is by
no means profoundly affected, the individual is still perfectly
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 65
logical. He is so far alive to the unpleasant possibilities of
hia position that he will very likely make a more or less
successful effort to compensate. Something has taken place
in between his consciousness and his environment. The in
telligence is not by any means the complete victim of the
situation. Up to a certain stage, at least, it is master.
The simplest of all the effects produced by substances of
this kind is the feeling that there is some difference between
the relationship of the individual to his environment and the
normal relationship. This experience is very well exemplified
by alcohol. After a few glasses of wine the individual is
frequently conscious of his mouth, teeth, and body generally
as though it were not entirely a part of himself. Many de
scribe a feeling of numbness, commencing from the forehead
and working downwards. They are conscious of a certain
unreality attending common sensations. The appreciation of
touch is diminished ; the same with hearing. The voices of
friends are heard, but their significance is not so readily
grasped. Smell and taste also suffer in much the same way,
and lastly, sight becomes impaired..
The precise order, so far as I have been able to find out,
is as follows. Firstly, touch and muscular sense, are affected ;
then hearing ; then taste and smell ; anil finally, sight. None
of these senses are affected, at this stage, to an extreme degree ;
a more or less correct sense-perspective still exists. It is
rather a growing inability to realise the significance of the
various sensations as they are affected in order, which accom
panies the first degree of alcoholic intoxication. In the later
stages, these senses are affected more profoundly and in the
same order. The last to be affected is the last to disappear.
A man in such a condition may be almost completely anaes
thetic to painful impressions, cuts, bruises, etc., but still retain
sufficient sense of hearing to make an attempt to respond when
spoken to. Or again, when he no longer responds to sound,
he may look dreamily around for a moment if his eyelids be
held up and a bright light flashed in his eyes.
In the earlier stages, the person is perfectly conscious,
colloquially speaking, of not feeling quite " at home." He re
quires to think before pronouncing his words. If he moves
his legs or arms, he is not quite sure whether he will

overdo or underdo the action. In other words, he is not in
the same rapport with his surroundings as he is normally.
Yet the significant fact is that up to this stage his intelligence
is alert and grasps the meaning of the situation so well that
every effort is made to gain control again.
It is this domination of the reason over the situation which
seems to me the most significant fact of all, and it is precisely
this fact which keeps emphasising itself in all experiences
of a similar nature. Touching this point, Snow, in his treatise
on anaesthetics, writing from a time when such substances
first became known, remarks that the more intelligent the
patient, the more anaesthetic he required to put him under.
I remember my attention being first drawn to this apparent
supremacy of the intelligence during an experiment with ether.
After inhaling about two ounces of the stuff, out of curiosity,
I became much annoyed at the loud ticking of a watch on
the mantelpiece close by. There were no other sounds in
the neighbourhood, and, as it was nearly dark in the room,
the only earthly sensation I was thoroughly conscious of was
this ticking, which had assumed, to my ears, the sound of
a steam hammer. I made an attempt to stop the watch and
this attempt was certainly a most clumsy one. I had frequently
stopped the watch before, and one would have imagined that
the recollection of the side on which I had to stop it would
have become instinctive through habit. Not so ; I scratched
about on the wrong side. Reason, however, was perfectly
alert, and woke up to the possible meaning of this ; also calcu
lated that without some reminder I might forget the incident,
and I felt constrained to write down the following note :
" Under the abnormal, memory is gradually lost, reason never ! "
Reason here took advantage of an incident and at the same
time seemed to appreciate the part played by itself in the
affair ; and all this at a time when the external world was
seeming more like a dream than a reality.
Of course one uses the word " reason " as a separate term
rather for convenience than anything else. We distinguish a
conscious process which grasps the environment as a mass
of sensations, from the process which analyses them and
establishes for itself the relative character or significance of
these sensations. It is possible that the one process to a
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 67
certain extent includes the other ; yet, for a dialectic purpose,
we distinguish them.
Now, these processes have a physical parallel. The more of
the substance is taken, the more marked is this deviation from
the normal, and, as a general rule, the effects pass off in the
reverse order to that in which they come on. In some in
stances, when the quantity of the drug has been large, changes
are produced in the cerebral cells, which can be recognised
microscopically : e.g. the disintegration of Niss1's granules and the
diminution in size of the nucleus. Yet even with what must
be regarded as a profound physical disturbance, there is no
marked interference with the integrity of the intelligence, and
after the influence has passed off the individual is in the
same mental state as he was at the commencement. It is
probable, indeed, that a change of a permanent nature has
been produced, otherwise it is difficult to understand how
chronic drug-taking should modify the character and intellect of
a person ; but this change must be insignificant after only one or
two administrations, otherwise it would be more in evidence.
One of the most interesting drugs I have had the oppor
tunity of studying has been Indian Hemp. It has been well
known for hundreds of years by many Eastern nations under
various names. In India, it is called Gunja or Ganji, some
times Bhang; in Persia and Egypt, Hashish or Hatchis. In
England it is at present used as an empirical remedy in a
few cases of obscure neuralgia and obstinate cases of migraine
and sleeplessness. Its action is rather uncertain. Out of six
of my friends who took some of the same preparation, in two
no effects at all were produced. This uncertainty has been
referred to the physical properties of the resin containing the
active principle, and in order to secure absorption, it is con
sidered wisest to suspend it in a finely divided condition in
some form of mucilage.
The effect of the drug on intelligent Europeans is fairly
constant. It produces a singular loss of the sense of time
and personality and a disordered appreciation of the surround
ings. In Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine, Dr. Marshall of
Cambridge gives a very characteristic account of the action
of Cannabis Indica. It corresponds in almost every detail
with accounts given by others of the strange experience.
68 Ernest Dunbar. [part
He writes: "About 2.30 in the afternoon of the nineteenth
of February last, whilst engaged in putting up an apparatus
for the distillation of zinc ethyl, I took between .1 and '15
grs. of the pure substance (cannabinon) from the end of a
glass rod. The substance very gradually dissolved in my mouth :
it possessed a peculiar, pungent, aromatic, and slightly bitter
taste, and seemed after some time to produce slight anaesthesia
of the mucous membrane covering the tongue and fauces. 1
forgot all about it and went on with my work ; but soon
after the zinc ethyl had commenced to distil—about 3.15—I
suddenly felt a peculiar dryness in the mouth, apparently due
to increased viscidity of the saliva. This was quickly followed
by paraesthesia and weakness in the legs. Gradually my mental
power diminished. I was no longer able to control the steps
of the operation and commenced to wander aimlessly round
the room. I had a most irresistible tendency to laugh ; every
thing seemed so ridiculously funny. At times I felt more
rational, but these lucid intervals grew gradually shorter and
I fell under the influence of the drug. I was now in a con
dition of acute intoxication : my speech was slurring, my gait
ataxic. I was free from all sense of care and worry, and
consequently felt extremely happy. Fits of laughter occurred,
especially at first, and sometimes the muscles of my face were
drawn to an almost painful degree. The most peculiar effect
was a complete loss of time-relation ; time seemed to have
no existence. I was continually taking out my watch, thinking
that hours must have passed, whereas only a few minutes
had elapsed. This, I believe, was due to a complete loss of
memory for recent events. The occurrence of lucid intervals
was also peculiar in many ways. They seemed to come on
suddenly sometimes, but not always, as if a result of an effort
of will ; they lasted a variable time, being shortest when the
symptoms of intoxication were most marked, and while in
them I could converse in a rational manner, and even direct
the work of the laboratory to a certain extent. About six
o'clock I had two cups of coffee, and afterwards, feeling quite
better, walked home. The fresh air and exertion revived me.
No unpleasant after-effects were experienced."
That is Dr. Marshall's account of the strange effect produced
by the drug. I had committed to paper my own experience
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consci&u&ness. 69
of the substance long before I read his account ; in fact the
actual scientific value of my own experience lay in the fact
that, up to the time of taking the Indian Hemp, I knew
none of its peculiar properties beyond the fact that it was a
species of narcotic. I had tasted some of the green extract
out of curiosity to know not the effects but the taste. The
element of imaginative expectation was therefore reduced to
a minimum. The effects, as in Dr. Marshal1's case, came on
quite suddenly.
It was on March 29th, .1900, about a quarter to four in
the afternoon, while looking through some materia medico, speci
mens, that I tasted some of the green extract. I remember
remarking its soapy taste and the difficulty of getting the
stuff from between my teeth.
I forgot all about it and nothing happened till ten minutes
past five. I had taken the five minutes to five train from
Broad Street, due at Hampstead at about 5.15. It was only
on leaving Kentish Town Station that I became conscious of
anything at all strange. Then it seemed as if I must have
been hours in the train. Between Kentish Town and Gospel
Oak time seemed so extended that I had continually to keep
watching the familiar features of the landscape—houses, etc.,
to make sure I had not gone beyond my destination.
It was between Gospel Oak and the next station that I
discovered the lucid intervals. It always seemed as the result
of an effort of will to me that I was able to procure these
lucid intervals, during which the only sensations of abnor
mality were a sense of tightness and compactness and an
exceedingly dry throat. To maintain the lucid interval soon
became an effort, and the next incident which attracted my
attention was, that on leaving the train and walking down
the platform there seemed quite an interval of time between
the placing of my foot on the ground and the realisation of
having done so. Yet the moment my attention was drawn
to this peculiarity, the phenomenon vanished and I had a
lucid interval.
On arriving home I went straight to my room, fully per
suaded what was the cause of the mischief. I remember being
much disturbed by the image of myself in the mirror. Beyond
a slight paleness there was nothing actually strange in my
70 Ernest Dunbar. [part
appearance; but I had a difficulty in realising that the form
I saw there could actually have anything to do with me.
Yet in the background of my mind there was a feeble but
sufficient grasp of the significance of the situation ; and along
with this the fear of impending death. Mitchell Bruce
mentions this fear, and had I read of this before taking the
drug I should have discounted my sensations and been less
disturbed. It seemed to me as if my consciousness were
becoming disintegrated, and the hideous extension of time
seemed only to prolong the agony.
Ringer makes a note of the fact that the individual in
this condition frequently acts rationally and is able to react
in quite a normal manner to his surroundings. A student
friend of mine told me of an acquaintance of his who, under
its influence, made an attempt to throw himself out of the
window, and after my own experience of the drug I was not
surprised at this. It seems that the person under cannabis
indica behaves either like a rational being or like a raving
maniac. Either he braves the mental uproar by sheer force
of will, or else lets himself go. We are told that in India
during the hill-fights some of the natives chew it and rush in
a frenzied condition to the conflict.
Here, again, there is an example of intelligence over-riding
the situation ; and the question is as to how far this mental
supremacy can go. It would be gratifying to know that, so
long as the individual maintains any relationship with his
environment, however trifling, his intelligence maintains its
integrity and can, by an effort of will, grasp the situation
and see things in their right light.1 At Bethnal House
Asylum I once saw a man, a melancholiac, who outgrew his
delusions almost every other day, and when questioned as to
some fleeting delusion he had harboured a few days ago,
seemed quite ashamed. He even admitted the possibility of
his being in error on the subject of the delusion he had that
day. Of course he may have been representing his feelings as
different from what they really were. He may have thought
that we were all wrong and may have been simply attempt
ing to humour us. However this may be, many cases of
1 Havelock Ellis in the Contemporary Review, 1898, emphasises this point
in connection with mezcal.
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 71
mental abnormality, whether natural or artificially produced
by drugs, suggest that it is not so much the intelligence that
is affected, as the relationship between this intelligence and
the environment (including the memory-environment). The
question merits consideration, but it is difficult to discuss it
without trespassing on the domains of metaphysics. The
nearest approach to the meaning of the word " intelligence "
in this sense would be the capacity for exercising logic. A
man might have this capacity in all its integrity, yet, if by
some unhappy physical accident he was deprived of some
part of the memory of previous environments, he would pro
bably act under some conditions like an insane person.
Thus a man with a delusion X may have that delusion
simply because there has been either a total or partial paralysis
of memory-ideas on the subject of X, but in any case he will
act up to the delusion. The victim of delirium tremens acts
as though the rats and beetles were real, and in that respect
at least he is logical. Similarly, if the lucid intervals during
the influence of cannabis indica mean anything psychologi
cally, they indicate that the intelligence is quite alive all the
time.
I believe, as Dr. Marshall suggests, that the sense of time
duration is prolonged because the memory of recent events
is impaired, and to illustrate this, I will quote an account
written before I read Dr. Marshal1's experience.
" The attempt to analyse the why and wherefore of this
resulted in the discovery that it required a great effort to
remember in detail the environment of the preceding moment,
at the present moment. It seemed as if the moment that
had gone with its myriad impressions was forgotten at once
and the moment which succeeded was hurried through and
forgotten again."
The fact that time seems to go quickly when we are
interested and slowly when we are not, as also the fact that
when the mind is very incompletely en rapport with the
outside world, as in dreams, time is extended, seem to indicate
that the relative sense of time is a product of the association
of consciousness with environment. The less this association,
the greater extension time seems to possess.
I believe that the loss of the personal sense is to be
72 Ernest Dunbar. [part
explained in the same way. Self-identity is established as a
sensation by a perpetual contrast with other objects of sensa
tion. This is recognised by all psychologists as a cardinal
factor in producing the personal sense.
The full conception of personal identity requires an entire
appreciation of the environment and a clear memory-impression
of the preceding environment up to that stage. Under Can
nabis Indica this last is missing, or at any rate very incom
plete. The memory-impression is gained by an effort of will,
and hence, during a lucid interval, the individual feels quite
normal.
There is one experiment with Indian Hemp which I have
not had the opportunity of making, viz., taking the reaction-
time. I doubt if it would yield any other than a normal
result, because, unless the subject were narcotised to a dan
gerous extent, the mere fact that his attention would be
necessary would bring about a lucid interval. Very little else
is known about the drug. In Eastern nations it is reported
to produce dreams of an emotional and erotic nature.
Ringer states that curious delusions may follow its admini
stration. The person may feel as though his brain were
boiling, or the roof of his head lifted off.
In my own experience, when some eight hours afterwards
its effects were beginning to wear off, I felt as though my
throat was an iron funnel up which came hot air from a
furnace beneath. A little thought made me recognise this as
a delusion, though the impression was realistic enough at the
time.
It seems as though the entire action of the drug can be
explained by assuming that there is a temporary paresis of
the memory, and in the delusional cases the delusion may be
simply evidence of a localised paralysis of the same faculty.
It is even possible that the tendency towards unmeaning
laughter may fall under the same explanation, for, as Sully
pointed out, the idea of the ridiculous and humorous is
founded, as a rule, on the wilful neglect of some part of a
mental picture,—the denial on purpose of some part of the
mental perspective.
Here, instead of there being a wilful negligence to see the
entire picture, there is, through impaired memory, an inability
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 73
to do so ; and hence things appear ridiculous, because there is
present a disconnected picture, which seems a jumble of
queer contradictions.
The next narcotic I have to treat as illustrating some psy
chological points is ether.
A couple of months back, my attention was drawn by one
of the members of the Society to a paper contributed to the
Proceedings some ten years ago by Sir William (then Professor)
Ramsay, and I found that his experience under ether was very
similar to what I had myself undergone. Since that time I
have come across a teacher of chemistry who seems to have
had a similar experience with the same suInstance.
The action of ether, if inhaled diluted with about sixty
per cent, of air, is fairly gradual.
The first symptoms are a sense of oppression in the head
and profuse salivation. The face feels hot, and the peripheral
arteries are dilated. This happens quite an appreciable time
before any mental symptoms appear. Next, the drama of early
alcoholic intoxication is enacted again, with this difference,
that there is seldom any staggering or difficulty in walking
about correctly ; and, since under ether the muscular sense is
diminished just as under alcohol, the conclusion is that the
staggering after alcohol is due to early affection of the cere
bellum. Next comes the sensation that the body is just as
much a part of the environment as anything else, and it is
perhaps this sensation which, together with the wide-awake
intelligence, compels the individual to adopt the standpoint of
subjective idealism ; which, in its turn, drives him to think
that a.t last the solution of the mystery is dawning upon him.
My own experiences under ether I shall never forget, and,
strange to say, I experienced nothing similar under chloroform
or ethyl bromide, though the same feeling came on and lasted
for a few minutes after inhaling ethyl iodide.
In my mind thought seemed to race like a mill-wheel.
Nothing was lost—every trifling phenomenon seemed to fall
into its place as a logical event in the universe. As in Sir
William Ramsay's experience, everything seemed so absolute.
It was either yes or no. Either this was not reality or
it was. If it was not, then it seemed to me in the
nature of things that I could never know reality. Then it
74 Ernest Dunbar. [PART
dawned upon me that the only logical position was subjective
idealism, and, therefore, my experience must be reality. Then
by degrees I began to realise that I was the One, and the
universe of which I was the principle was balancing itself
into completeness. All thought seemed struggling to a logical
conclusion ; every trifling movement in the world outside my
consciousness represented a perfectly logical step in the final
readjustment
I could hear my heart-throbs getting longer and longer.
At length I felt they would cease, and the drama of exist
ence would be over. I remember at the time feeling so strong
a repugnance to this termination that I ceased administering
any more of the stuff and got up. Things seemed objective
and tangible while I was walking about, but, on lying down
again, the same experience commenced again, with this differ
ence, that now account had to be taken of the first experience
in order to bring about the same conclusion. Just as the
psychological moment came, I moved my arm, and the same
process commenced again. I let it go on to the bitter end
this time, and as the moment of extinction arrived I felt
strangely normal, and not a bit sleepy.
These were the effects of a very small dose of ether on
me. I don't suppose I got to the end of even the first stage
of anaesthesia ; and what to me was a righteous horror at
the approaching end of the universe would correspond, in many
patients who take ether for surgical purposes, to the period
of struggling and screaming.
Under the influence of ether, there is no doubt the mind
is highly stimulated, and it is extremely difficult to see where
the cerebral depression comes in—at least in relation to the
higher faculties of thought. There is nothing essentially
illogical in the Fichtean standpoint; it is only strange that
so trifling an action as taking ether should condition the
ultimate realisation of that standpoint. Under ether this
would present no difficulty to one's mind. One would simply feel
that in a scheme where logic was the beginning and end of all
change, no such thing as a trifle could exist,—that life had led up
to the inhalation of ether, and this was to be the end of it all.
Such was the effect ether had on me, and each time the
experience has been much the same.
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 75
I have made a point of asking patients in the surgical
wards how they felt when they were being anaesthetised.
The common experience (eighty per cent, of cases) is that of
rushing into a dark tunnel. There is a singing in the ears
and a flashing of lights in the eyes. On coming round they
may pass through a struggling stage, but more usually they
feel restless and talkative.
A relative of mine had an operation five weeks ago, and
she told me afterwards that, when coming out of the anaes
thetic, she was conscious of talking at a great rate, yet felt
quite unable to stop. She only dimly remembers what she
was talking about.
The sense of time is disturbed under ether, chloroform,
and nitrous oxide. It is not changed in a recognisable way
as under Gannabis Indica, but at a certain stage of the anaesthesia
the time-sense vanishes.
This is most marked under gas, where a patient will wake
up after the tooth is drawn with a positive conviction that
the operation has not yet commenced. After chloroform or
ether the patient seldom has any conception of how long he
or she has been under.
There are no lucid intervals during the early stages induced
by these general anaesthetics, for although the activity of the
cerebrum is stimulated and depressed in turn, starting from
the highest faculties and working downwards, yet the process
is fairly extensive ; it does not apply only to special parts,
but produces a gradual depression of the entire brain.
Luchsinger has pointed out that chloroform, ether, and
carbon dioxide gas produce a marked effect on the conductivity
of nerves, and it seems probable that in addition to the action
these substances have been shown to exercise on the cerebral
cells, there is also temporary paralysis of the conductivity of
the association tracts.
With regard to the physical action of these drugs, there is
a singular fact, that I have never seen noticed, namely, that
most of the general anaesthetics possess the property of dissolving
fat and oils. Chloroform, Ether, Benzene, Ethyl Bromide, Carbon
bisulphide, Ethyl iodide, Amylene, Carbon tetrachloride, all possess
this quality. It was this physical resemblance which made
me try Benzene and Carbon tetrachloride.
76 Ernest Dunbar. [PART
The action of benzene is slower than that of chloroform,
but with the exception of the unpleasant smell and a loud
roaring in the ears, the same effects are produced in the
first stage of anaesthesia as with the latter.
With chloroform, the first inhalation produces its effect ;
even a powerful sniff from a bottle of chloroform may be
followed by a queer feeling.
As with other substances, the first effect is the feeling
of the unreality of common sensations. This is a general
experience, and anybody who smells a few drops from a
handkerchief will admit it. After this preliminary sensation
is past, I personally go through nothing resembling in the
slightest degree the effects of ether. The only wish I have
at that stage is for more chloroform, —a wish I am not conscious
of having felt with ether. I lose interest in everything. I
don't care who sees me and in what condition they see me,
I have only one desire—for more chloroform—and then even
that wish soon goes.
Three students besides myself have noticed the flashing
of stars in the visual field, synchronous with the heart-beat,
under the action of chloroform. Two of us noticed that each
bright point underwent a peculiar circular motion. The move
ment was in the path of a boomerang rather than in a true
circle. I do not know any reason for this, but it was curious
that two persons should have observed it. These stars increase
in number as the anaesthesia deepens, and on opening the eyes
they still continue to show themselves over the entire visual
field, which gradually grows darker.
Carbon tetrachloride resembles chloroform in everything
except its smell. Also it is not sweet, and it often contains a
small quantity of the disagreeable carbon bisulphide, rendering
it very unpleasant to inhale.
The effect of chloroform is in some respects very different
from that of ether. If the two are given in equal strengths,
chloroform is much the more rapid in its action, and there is
not the same tendency to excitement as with the other drug ;
further, a very much smaller quantity of chloroform is sufficient
to produce the most profound anaesthesia. The earlier stages
are therefore short, and there is scarcely time for evidence of
mental changes to show.
L.] The Action of Drugs on Consciousness. 77
I remember only one other sensation in connection with
chloroform, and as I have not met any one who had had a
similar experience, mine has no value. It seemed to me that
deep down somewhere in my consciousness voices were wrang
ling and quarrelling ; sometimes over a trifle such as the closing
of a door. The voices were perfectly distinct and generally
disagreeable. At other times they would be talking at me.
This sort of conversation would commence : " So you see we've
got you again." Then I would think, " Oh ! won't you leave
me alone ? I want to rest," and the answer would come : " We'll
have the last word " ; and with that would ensue a mutter
ing and a grumbling, which occasionally rose to a whining
complaint from these voices. I have never inhaled chloroform
without hearing these voices ; they last quite a short time
and do not usually begin until some time has elapsed.
With regard to the craving for more anaesthetic, Dr. Keith,
in a book entitled, " Fads of an Old Physician," mentions it
as having attended some of his experiments with Dr. Simpson
at the time of the introduction of chloroform.
It is exceedingly difficult to draw conclusions from many
of these facts, and it is not easy to make many experiments
of the kind, as the majority of people have a healthy re
pugnance to dosing themselves, even for scientific purposes
with substances of this nature. I think, however, that a care
ful and systematic study of the effects of drugs on the con
sciousness must of necessity yield some positive results. Sir
William Ramsay in his paper ten years ago urged that those
who had from choice or necessity gone through experiences of
this kind should record them, and the few observations I have
been able to make on the subject suggest that these strange
mental symptoms which appear so much a part of the per
sonality of the individual may be evidence of some definite
psychological law.

PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE WELSH REVIVAL:
1904-5.
By the Rev. A. T. Fhyer.
It is now twenty-three years since Edmund Gurney asked me
to join in the work of the S.P.R. My answer to his request
was that I would do so on one condition, viz., that the Society
would not attempt to prove the supernatural, by which I
meant that I was willing to assist in the examination and
classification of physical and psychical phenomena connected
with ghosts, dreams, etc., solely as terrestrial events, and with
out reference to the ends such things may subserve in the
spiritual sphere or the life beyond the grave. I maintained
then, as I do now with even greater conviction, that whatever
use individual members might make of the results of our
inquiries, whatever inferences persons might draw from the
verified stories collected by the Society, our work as a Society
would be accomplished by that verification and tabulation.
Gurney entirely assented to this view of our work, and the
history of the S.P.R. is sufficient evidence of the loyalty which
has been observed towards its first principles.
In dealing with the Welsh Revival in this paper, I desire
to maintain exactly the same line, to relate events so far as
one has been enabled to get at their truth, and to present
the evidence in a more or less classified form.
In this work two difficulties arise : (i.) the inability of most
persons to observe accurately the things passing under their very
eyes ; (ii.) the unwillingness of persons who have had abnormal
experiences either to relate them or to submit to a mild cross-
examination if they do relate them. Both difficulties are
commonly found in S.P.R. work. The first is beyond our
power to remove entirely, but as the Society's methods become
LI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 81
better known we may hope slowly to increase the now limited
number of those who can observe accurately. The power of
mental concentration so habitually exercised as to be ready at
all moments to receive and retain impressions with precision
is not common ; we can do our best to encourage its growth.
The second difficulty is the greater one, particularly in the
subject under discussion. Most of the persons whose experi
ences we desire to examine and record regard them as too
sacred for any such process, and some have more than hinted
that my inquiry is at least questionable, if not altogether pro
fane. Argument avails but little with these good people,
but my endeavour has been to suggest that as the Supreme
Mind, to Whom they attribute the operations of which they
have been the subjects, manifests in all His works law and
order, there can be no more inherent profanity in trying to
arrive at the particular laws or methods of the mental, psychi
cal, or spiritual spheres than in investigating the physical side
of His works.
Mr. Myers in his Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 298,
adopted a similar attitude. Prof. James, in Some Varieties of
Iteligious Experience, follows the same line, and I may quote
Dr. Starbnck's introduction to his Psychology of Religion where
he says that " The student in the psychological laboratory
meets with as much orderliness and sequence among the facts
of emotion or memory or reasoning as the physicist in his
laboratory. ... It is scarcely questioned at the present
time that all our mental processes follow an orderly sequence.
We go one step further, and affirm that there is no event
in the spiritual life which does not occur in accordance with
immutable laws."
I sincerely wish that my inquiry into revival phenomena
could have been as full and detailed as Dr. Starbuck's was
in his researches into Conversion, but similar thoroughness re
quired what was beyond my power to give,—many months of
patient personal examination of witnesses, a mastery of the
Welsh language, and sufficient acquaintance with the mental
habits of the people to enable one to carry on the inquisi
tion without arousing too much suspicion and distrust. I
consented to write this paper only because no one else, so
far as I know, has attempted to examine the Revival at all
82 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
in detail, from our point of view, and because even a partial
attempt of this sort may go a little way towards preventing
the growth of a revival legend. I have attended revival ser
vices, heard Evan Koberts at three of his services, read most
of the daily reports of meetings, corresponded with men and
women of all sorts and conditions in various counties, and
interviewed a fairly large number of people.
For the purpose of this paper I sent out nearly 250 copies
of a circular asking for particulars of incideuts that would
interest our members. (See (1) in the Appendix. All
numerical references hereafter are to the cases in this Appen
dix and the original documents of all the cases referred to
or quoted, containing the full names of the witnesses, are,
as usual, stored in the S.P.K. office.) Not more than half of
the stamped addressed envelopes enclosed with the circulars
have found their way back to me, and of the half that covered
replies I might have spared some for all the information they
conveyed. But I owe, and here tender thanks to several
willing correspondents for the trouble taken to answer ques
tions and suggest possible sources of information.
If the material to hand is limited in bulk, it has the
merit of being mostly original. Readers will note the strong
family likeness that exists between the recitals drawn from
persons in South and North Wales, from men and women of
different degrees of education and social habit, who were
ignorant of each other's existence, and wrote therefore without
any possibility of collusion. That we should find these simi
larities is a distinct encouragement to researchers to persevere
with such inquiries, confident that the underlying laws are not
beyond our reach.
I first heard of the Revival at the beginning of October
1904, when a vivid account was given to me viva voce (since
then written tor me, see (2) Appendix) of the outbreak of fervour
amongst some young women at New Quay, in Cardiganshire,
who had been stirred to deeper thought some months previously.
The part played by the sex whose most valuable mental en
dowment is intuition forms " a marked feature of the whole
movement, whether seen in leadership or in subordination.
These young women were in the opinion of some persons,
the initiators of the Revival in South Wales, but the move

ment soon became more prominently associated with a
young man named Evan Roberts, and it was his efforts
at his native place, Loughor, that first attracted the interest
of the newspapers. Reporters and editors saw their oppor
tunity and used it to the full. Without doubt they
fostered the Revival, and their papers suffered no diminution
of circulation in consequence. To the columns of vigorous
and fairly accurate matter provided day by day by the
two leading journals of South Wales, describing the ser
vices from November 10th onward for five months, much of
the rapid development of excitement over the Revival was
certainly due. (Reprints of these are in the S.P.R. Library.)
But if the spread of the mysterious atmosphere from village
to village and town to town was encouraged by the news
papers, it was not caused by them. Press influence is great,
but it has its limitations. No amount of sensational writing
could have enkindled the tremendous enthusiasm, with its
resulting mass of converts, which characterised the Revival in
some districts ; those who claim that it did must show why
the same influence utterly failed in other places. For one of
the curiosities of the movement has been its very unequal
operation. This is to be accounted for, as I shall presently
prove, but it has nothing to do with the newspapers.
From Loughor the Revival spread to Trecynon, near Aber-
dare, thence to the Garw and Llynfi Valleys, on to Mountain
Ash, and then to the Rhondda Valley, and elsewhere. Mean
while a series of outbreaks was taking place in Merionethshire.
This had no ostensible connection with the southern Revival,
neither had it material support from the press until the
appearance of the curious lights, to which I shall refer later,
caused remark and attracted an army of reporters and in
vestigators, much to the alarm and, in some cases, disgust of
the peaceful inhabitants.
Although Evan Roberts' name is the most prominent in
the Revival, he neither created nor sustained it for the most
part. He is the embodiment of the Spirit of the Revival, the
most striking manifestation of the force that caused it, and
to a very great extent its leader and director, but he did not
produce the Revival, nor did the Revival produce him.
Evan Roberts was born at Loughor in 1878; he is the fifth
84 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
in a family of eight, four sons and four daughters. His father
is a collier, the mother a simple, honest housewife : neither the
parents nor their forebears have been people of unusual ability
or mark. Evan attended the Church School of the upper village
until he was 12 years of age and, although diligent and regular
in school-life, showed no capacity that distinguished him from
other lads ; in ordinary work he was just the average, healthy,
play-loving boy, cheerful and willing. Between 1 1 and 1 2
years of age he had a slight accident to his face, after which
as a consequence he showed symptoms of a nervous shock. I
refer to this later on. The incident has not been related else
where and may be denied by some of his friends, but I have
good reason for thinking there is truth in the story. From
his earliest days Evan had a strong bias towards religion, but
I learn on good authority that not much reliance can be
placed on the statement which has found its way into print
to the effect that the mother destined her newly-born child
for the ministry. Most Welsh mothers desire to see at least
one son in the ministry, but there is no evidence that I
can discover of Mrs. Roberts having had an unusual desire of
this kind. Roberts spent most of his time in Bible reading,
both as a boy and as a collier, and he may almost be
described as a man of one book. At the same time, the
catalogue of his modest library, which has been read to me
by one who obtained it from Evan, shows that he paid more
than usual attention to general culture, especially in Welsh
books of reference. He wrote poetry, some of which was
published in newspapers, and is a fair performer on three or
four musical instruments. I am assured by a scholar who
has tested his knowledge that Evan Roberts has a better
literary equipment than most Welsh colliers and that is say
ing a great deal, for many of them read widely. When he
became a collier at the age of 12, and during his blacksmith
period in his 25th year, the Bible was his constant com
panion, prayer the ever-sought recreation. Every interval in
his working days and many of his night hours he spent in
earnest prayer. At the Chapel he was an active partaker in
all the various exercises and classes. The one testimony
borne by every person who came into contact with Evan in
whatever capacity, is that his life, conduct, and profession
u.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 85
were and are absolutely consistent. I have rarely found such
unanimous witness to any good man. His talk in private
for many years was on revivals, he read all he could find on
the subject, and his prayers were for a revival. The idea
possessed him night and day. A few weeks ago he told one
of my informants, a pressman who has been in close touch
with the revivalist, that on one occasion, four years before
the Revival, he had suggested to a young preacher a sermon
on 2 Chron. vii. 14. The verse seemed to him to furnish
the programme of a revival. To it he has certainly been
most loyal. I give these details because without them it is
impossible to form a proper estimate of the man or of his
position. We can easily understand from them that if the
working, active consciousness of this lad was mainly occupied
with this one absorbing idea, how richly stored his sub-con
sciousness became with the materials on which he is now
making heavy drafts.
After a year at the forge, Roberts determined to prepare for
the ministry in the Calvinistic Methodist Body, and he entered
the preparatory school at Newcastle Emlyn in the middle of
September, 1904. The head-master (see (3) Appendix) says of
him that during the few weeks he was at school he betrayed
a capacity and aptitude for work considerably above the
average. On the fifth Sunday of his residence a missioner
named Seth Joshua came to the village on a mission, and on
the following Tuesday some of the young women from New
Quay came over to help. Evan Roberts was present, much
to the regret of the head-master, as the pupil had been in
bed with a cold. On the Wednesday night the master saw
Evan in the Chapel standing up to " confess Christ," then
kneeling in prayer and going through a most agonising soul-
struggle. This however was overshadowed by what happened
next day at Blaenanerch, where, as he said, he was "bent"
(see Western. Mail reprint). After this Roberts was at New
castle Emlyn for about three weeks, but not in school. The
master, being totally unable to appreciate the mighty force
at work in one who spent all day and most of the night in
prayer and meditation, tried to get Evan to study some simple
task, but the young man declared that as soon as he touched
a book he felt the spirit crushing him, and it was only by
86 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
putting the book on one side that he could obtain relief. As
he said this a tremor ran through him, and his face and
neck were observed to quiver in a remarkable way. To most
of the people around him he was then an enigma ; only two
or three persons had any suspicion of what these paroxysms
and visions meant. On a certain Sunday night he heard a
voice bidding him go home to Loughor and speak to the
young people of his own Chapel : the following day he went.
Permission having been obtained to hold services, the work
began on October 31st; before many evenings Loughor was
"on fire" and thence the flame spread.
Evan Roberts is a mystic, and to understand his place in
humanity we must study the lives and writings of Eckhart,
Tauler, Hylton, St. John of the Cross, and especially Juliana
of Norwich, persons whose names, I suspect, were unknown to
Roberts until recently. His teaching is limited in scope, but
so far has been more in accordance with the Spanish than
with the German mystics. Is this due to racial affinity ?
Roberts is probably of Iberian stock.
The story of his visions will, I understand, be published.
Here is one and it is typical of the rest. It occurred before
he left home for the Grammar School. " One Friday night
last spring when praying by my bedside before retiring, I was
taken up into a great expanse without time or space—it was
communion with God. Before this it was a far-off God that
I had " (cp. Suso on his vision. " It was without form or
mode, but contained within itself the most entrancing delight."
Suso died in 1365). "I was frightened that night but never
since. So great was my shivering that I rocked the bed and
my brother awakened, took hold of me, thinking I was ill.
After that I was awakened every night a little after one.
This was most strange, for through the years 1 slept like a
rock and no disturbance in my room would arouse me. From
that hour I was taken up into Divine fellowship for about
four hours. What it was I cannot tell you, except that it
was Divine. About five I was allowed to sleep until nine."
Mr. Seth Joshua, before-mentioned, has said that for four
years before meeting with Roberts in Cardiganshire, he had
prayed for the raising up of a revivalist, " not from Oxford
or Cambridge, but from the plough or the coalpit." (A
LL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 87
paragraph also appeared in the South Wales Daily NCAVS,
July 1st, 1905, to the effect that a deacon eight years
ago offered a similar prayer.) Mr. Joshua was not alone in
praying for a revival : I have evidence that many in all
parts of Wales had been doing the same, and I suggest that
if our theory of telepathic influence is true, it must some day
be recognised as one at least of the elemental forces in what
is called prayer. I am not, I think, going beyond the limits
of our inquiry if I urge the examination of prayer as a
psychic force on the attention of members. If the obsession
of a particular idea in one mind is traceable to the intense
energy exerted by some other mind at a distance, with a view
to the obsession, is it contrary to reason to conclude that
something of this kind takes place in a certain class of prayers ?
I am thinking now of only one branch of prayer action, the
terrene ; but it does seem probable that if a hundred or two
hundred persons in Wales were for years desiring a particular
line of action, and spent a great deal of time in express
ing their desire, the force so generated and directed could
hardly fail to reach and move some sympathetic minds within
the same area. We are very far from understanding the laws
of telepathy, but our limited knowledge even of its facts points
in the direction I have indicated. Finding in the course of
my inquiry that the revival had "caught on" in some places,
in others had but limited success, and elsewhere failed iguo-
miniously, I tried to discover what prayer-preparation had
taken place in the several localities, and no one in Wales
will, I think, dispute my conclusion that speaking generally
the results corresponded to the preparation. In one town the
conversions in the chapels attended by Evan Roberts were fewer
than in others where he was not present, and for the same
reason,—difference in the amount of preparation.
Whether by prayer or other means, the creation of expect
ancy would seem to be necessary to success. I attended
Roberts' services at Siloam, Swansea, for a whole Sunday.
Meetings had been going on there daily for five weeks before
his arrival (beginning nearly as soon as his meetings at Loug-
hor), and I found in the packed mass of 800 or 900 people
in the Chapel, exactly that air of feverish expectancy which
made all present susceptible to the suggestion power of a man
88 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
like the revivalist. It was a new experience to me to hear
a large crowd sing over and over again for 15 or 20 minutes,
without a moment's pause, the refrain : Diolch iddo, diolch iddo,
Byth am gofio llwch y llawr (Thanks to Him : always for
remembering the dust of earth.)
One able correspondent whose name, were I allowed to give
it, would carry great weight (he is a Welshman), says that
some of the scenes witnessed are in part due to the hysterical
excitement caused by expectation. I need not detain you
with a description of a revival service : it must suffice to say
that even in the most orderly meetings confusion reigns, yet
there is no sense of confusion. Roberts generally preaches
but little, sometimes not at all. His part is to ascertain at
intervals the peculiar temperament present in the congregation
as a whole, or in its parts, and then to guide it into corre
spondence with his own standard of what it ought to be.
If you have watched a skilled workman bringing a lump of
heated metal or other material into a required form, you can
conceive what Roberts does with his meetings. One shrewd
observer, a Welshman, writes to me thus : (The account which
is given in full in the Appendix (4) is abridged here.) " The five
meetings I attended were in different places, under different
circumstances, and each meeting had a complexion entirely its
own. But I detected a uniform method. Evan Roberts tests a
meeting before he begins to speak. What provokes his hearers
seems to me the clearest explanation of his success in bringing
each meeting to a dramatic and successful climax. His apparent
indifference and immobility, before he says anything, breaks
up all the composure an audience can command. Add to this
his habit of transfixing each and every person with his homage-
compelling gaze. He reviews methodically the rows of faces ;
it is the look of a practised physician. By the time he speaks
he has made a mental census of the audience. He knows
who are ill at ease, he predicts conversions, he detects hind
rances. A man of faith, doubtless, relying on the promptings
of the Holy Spirit, but not neglectful of all the data available
by human means. He makes the audience reveal itself, and
then tells the people what they knew already, but they are
puzzled and staggered by the fact that this meteoric stranger
should know them so well. In three of his break-downs or

nervous collapses that I witnessed, I was near enough to render
first-aid if necessary, and could not believe that he was sham
ming. Twice I saw him place his hand on his neck, as if
pressing something down. There was a jerking back of the
head, such as I have noticed in persons whose nervous systems
are somewhat deranged."
My correspondent knew nothing of the accident in Roberts'
boyhood ; his idea of a physical cause for the nervous tremors
is therefore all the more noteworthy. The followers of Evan
attribute these mild tremors to Divine influence, and I think
he shares their belief, but true to our line, we must exhaust
the nearer probabilities before going elsewhere.
Roberts certainly possesses a strong power of suggestion,
is very sensitive to a certain class of telepathic influences, and
has a genius for religion, but has not, by any sign that I
can read, a trace of multiple personality in active operation.
Some account must be taken of the inner voice he claims
as his guide. We are all familiar with what Mr. Myers
wrote on Socrates and his Daemon in Human Personality, Vol.
II., sects. 812 et seqq., and the parallel between the philosopher
and the revivalist is on some points remarkably complete.
In Roberts' case the Spirit tells him when to speak and when
to be silent, to whom he may grant an audience and whom
he must refuse, what places to visit and the places he must
avoid. Without any previous warning the inner voice com
pelled him to remain silent for seven days from February
23rd to March 1st. On the 22nd he was preparing to go from
Neath to Briton Ferry when suddenly the voice said : " Don't
go." He obeyed, and remained in one room for the seven
•days without uttering a word even to the girl revivalist who
took his frugal meals to him. The few communications that
passed were made in writing. I have ascertained from the
people in whose house he was staying that they never heard
him once praying or reading aloud. The story of those seven
days is given in full in the Western Mail reprint for March 3rd,
1905, and I quote extracts from these in (5). He had one
vision during this period, a revelation of the imperfect spiritual
condition of a certain group of people. If you read the
accounts of all that he went through in public from September
1904, to February 20th. 1905, you will not be surprised that
90 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
tired nature asserted itself and demanded rest. Not all of us
have the courage to obey nature's warnings so implicitly and
immediately.
The short pithy messages that Roberts gives his friends and
audiences as from the Spirit are, so far as can be discerned,
not more remarkable than might be expected from a man
whose mind is saturated with Biblical knowledge, and who
possesses great native shrewdness and penetration. It is right
to mention that few men have more resolutely withstood the
temptation to be lionised. Whatever may happen, he will not
be the idol of the hour, and people who have crossed Con
tinents to see him iu private have had to return unsatisfied.
A great deal has been said of his power of prediction. It
appears to be exercised chiefly in pointing out where coming
converts are to be found in this or that part of a chapel
meeting. He is nearly always found to be right at the time,
and if his statement is not verified or justified immediately,
it has been afterwards. Numerous as such instances are, we
may not be disposed to attach much weight to this feature
of his work, since it is obvious that in a huge gathering of
the kind many are present who are susceptible to a " con
verting " influence. But one case of prediction deserves
notice. At Liverpool (6) on one occasion Roberts refused to
leave the building, when the service had been declared closed
by the ministers, because he said that one man in an indi
cated gallery, a Welshman, he was certain had not confessed
Christ as he ought to have done. The minister in charge of
that gallery " tested " the people and reported that every one
had confessed Christ. Roberts was not satisfied : six times
was the appeal made during the next 25 minutes and not
until the sixth test did a man come forward and admit that
he had not been sincere in professing as a convert with the
rest. Roberts directed the minister to speak to the man, and
after a short talk he too gave in. We can only assume that
Roberts' sensitiveness to deceptive, hostile, or sympathetic
thought is abnormally developed. Many public speakers are
aware of the temper or attitude of an audience before any
outward sign of it has been given.
Amongst the records in the Appendix (7) will be found
TO cases of possibly telepathic influence.
LL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 91
Evan Roberts has not escaped criticism as to his predic
tions and declarations of hostile influence. What one critic
at Dowlais and others at Liverpool said may be read in the
reprints.
I now pass on to other features of the Revival.
Some letters have appeared in the newspapers on the
wonderful eloquence displayed by unlettered persons in prayer
and speaking, and not a few men have claimed that the elo
quence is proof of direct Divine inspiration. I have inquired
into this and find that for the most part the eloquence con
sisted in a number of persons being able under the excite
ment of the moment and the contagion of crowds to express
themselves with unusual fluency, but nearly always in the
words of the Bible or hymns which they have learned and
known from infancy (8). It is not a Sais but a Celt who
writes thus—" Excite a Welshman and he is not responsible
for much that he does. If you can tell me exactly how
it is that a Welshman is more susceptible to physical
emotion than an Englishman, you have no difficulty in com
prehending the secret of the Revival. . . . My wife happened
to get a bit excited at a parish meeting two years ago and
well-nigh staggered me and others with her eloquence. Under
the impulse of the moment she spoke splendidly and made a
great impression. She had never spoken in public before and
nothing has occurred since to incite her into eloquence."
Without further discussion we may accept as the only con
clusion warranted by the facts that as the Welsh are by
nature emotional, enthusiastic, ready speakers as a rule, and
possess a language that almost of itself invites eloquence by
the stately roll , of its open vowels and musical syllables, it
is not surprising that those who are stirred to the depths of
their feelings should break out into fervent utterance of the
sonorous periods they have taken in with their mother's milk.
There are several cases reported of persons unable in ordinary
conversation to speak without stammering who spoke with
fluency and ease in prayer in public ; but such instances of
defective muscular power being made good under excitement
are not confined to the Revival and are easily explainable.
Dr. Starbuck in his Psychology of Religion discusses the
relative values of the various motives to conversion. I must
92 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
refer you to his tables and lists, but it is worth notice that
in Wales, during this Revival, the motive of fear has found
but a small place, if any at all. The burden of Evan Roberts'
teaching is love and gratitude, obedience and personal service,
and joy. In the statements made to me by many I meet
frequently with the remark—" I felt full of love and joy, I
could love everybody." And no one, whatever his views of
the movement as a whole, can regret hearing that many
reconciliations have been effected.
From two very different and widely separated districts I
have reports that a distinct change of countenance took place
in some of the persons affected. A friend (8) says that
" Young people became pale and their eyes wore a far-away
listless look. One said that for days after he had prayed
he saw people move like ghosts in the street, and he thought
there was a thick mist." Another writes—" I have been
struck by one gir1's changed appearance during these months.
Her expression has become much more gentle, her face, pre
viously coarse, has become quite refined. As a man expressed
it to me—she has a Madonna-like face."
I have met with no cases of levitation.
One of the most striking narratives received comes from
near Aberdare. The writer, a collier, gives an account of his
studies in psychology and the numerous books he had read
before the Revival. He was secretary of the local Ethical
Society and attended the Revival services purely as a critic.
He wanted to know how " the moral consciousness became
centrified into the conscience of these people." The story
and results of his investigations are given in the Appendix (9),
and it is important to note that the record is one extending
from November 14th to March 4th—within a few days of
four months. He gives instances of telepathy, of the hindrance
(o conversions through the presence of sceptics at the meet
ings, of a case of access of physical strength during religious
excitement, and of his own experience of a " voice." Taken
as a whole it is the most interesting of all the communica
tions received.
No doubt there have been many other cases of apparent
telepathy connected with the Revival. I quote two received;
if others come to hand they will be reported as usual to
Li.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival, 93
the Society. The first occurred in the Llynfi Valley. A
young man at a Revival service was suddenly seized with an
irresistible impulse to pray for his father, although he knew of
no particular reason why he should do so. The father up to
that time, living about 16 miles away, was iu good health.
The next morning the young man had a telegram to say
that his father had died suddenly. The case is given in full
in the Appendix (8).
The second happened in an adjoining valley. On Decem
ber 27th, 1904, as on other days that week, there were
long services held at a Church three times each day for the
sake of the persons who had been won in the Revival.
The wife of the layman who had charge of some of the
services objected to her husband's prolonged absence from
home, and told him that if he had pleasure in the Church
he should have none at home, so she started the weekly
wash. On going to the wash-tub, she says, " There before
me appeared the four children, and one of them spoke to me
D English saying—' Mam, come,' and then they disappeared.
I could hear the singing of the hymn, ' O Paradise,' until it
died away in the distance." The four children had died in
infancy.
The husband's report is that at the time of the vision he
was in the Church praying for his wife, but without any
thought of the children then or at any time of the day.
There was no singing in the Church at the time. His
prayer was that God would give his wife a desire to go
to the meetings. On his return she asked what was the
matter with him, as he looked confused. He saw a change in
her, and he believed that God had revealed Himself to her.
She cried, went with him to the services, but said nothing
about the vision until late that night. Clearly the case
belongs to the class of visualised mental impressions of which
we have many recorded. See Appendix (10) for the full
account.
The Vicar of Llangadfan reports that three of his parish
ioners, whose names are given, heard bells chiming during
service on Sunday morning, January 29th, 1905. The sound
was over their heads, but no one else in the congregation
heard it. Another parishioner on the previous Wednesday
94 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
heard what appeared to him as a thunder clap followed by
lovely singing in the air. On Saturday the 14th of January
a workman returning from work between 7 and 8 heard some
strange music, similar to that caused by the vibration of
telegraph wires, only much louder. The hill where he was
is far from any trees or wires of any kind. And yet
another man heard one evening iu February some lovely
singing on the road about half a mile from his house : it
frightened him very much.
The names are all given, but verification other than the
Vicar's is impossible without a personal interview. Whatever
the explanation of this series of happenings, I think the
evidence is trustworthy. Most of the persons concerned were
men. See Appendix (11).
The Vicar of a parish in Cardiganshire (12) was riding, a
few days before Christmas 1904, to visit some parishioners
who lived three miles up the hillside. As he was ascending
he heard voices singing ; he thought at first that it was pure
fancy and took little notice. Gradually the voices seemed to
increase in volume until they became overpowering. He tried
to imagine that it could be nothing outside himself, but the
harmony seemed to be borne in on him entirely from without.
It was as real to his senses as anything he ever heard and
the words were distinct, in Welsh. The refrain was started
again and again, each time with increased power. Arrived at
his destination the singing ceased suddenly. He does not
remember that he ever heard the same words sung as he
heard them that day, and it is the only experience of the
kind that he has had. Many of us know what it is to be
haunted by a tune or phrase until by a strong effort of the
will we rid ourselves of it, and that one whose mind has
been occupied with revival music should have a more vivid
experience of the kind is perhaps not very extraordinary.
Amongst the narratives deposited in the office of the
S.P.R. is a long one from a young man in Glamorgan whose
conversion attracted more than usual notice. From his story
I will only quote what belongs to this section on sounds.
One night he had spoken at a meeting but felt afterwards
that he had said something detrimental to the cause, and he
determined not to speak again. He proceeds—" I reached
I.I.] Psychological Axpecte of the Welsh Revival. 95
home at 1 1 very tired, with no appetite for supper. I laid
on the couch but instantly felt full of the Spirit and on fire.
It was so hot that I had to go outside, although the fire was
nearly out. I went to bed about 12. I was sleepy but was
not allowed to sleep. I heard a voice speaking distinctly.
The Spirit said (in Welsh)—' You said to-night that you
will not speak for Me again.' This was repeated several
times. I answered—' You know very well that I cannot
speak, that I have nothing to say.' The Spirit—' I have a
message, I want you to deliver it, and that in the most
public place.' 'What is it?' The Spirit—'Tell them that
hypocrisy is the worst sin against Me, and that there is not
a hope of a hypocrite receiving a blessing from Me.' I went
now to think over the message. The Spirit again—' You
have not said whether you will say it or not.' I promised
I would. I said—' Let me sleep now.' But I was not
allowed. ... I doubted whether it was the Holy Spirit.
He then said—' Don't you remember Me coming to you
in Trinity Chapel, and that quite plainly ? ' I was convinced
and the next night delivered the message. That night I felt
the presence of the Spirit but heard no voice. I had a
vision, it was a beautiful light, pure, and brighter than any
light I have ever seen, and clusters of something very soft
and white falling upon me gently and covering me all over.
I called them blessings." Another night he saw a stick
given to him as a help in rough places. Again he saw
down an abyss, and marks as if some one had fallen down
into it. Next morning he heard of the death of a woman
who had delayed repentance. His other dreams related need
not detain us ; they have all the same character of being
mental images formed by the reflections of the subliminal self
upon things that had occurred to him, or perhaps that were
passing through other minds possibly in telepathic contact
with his own.
In another town a young man who, through inability to accept
the Creed, and for other causes, had been an irregular attendant
at Church, was present at a Ilevival service during which he
saw a lighted candle emerge from the font and the figure of
an angel shielding it with his wing from the draught that
came from the open door. The flame was very small, and

the least breath of wind would have extinguished it but for
the protecting wing. Before the service was ended he gave
his adhesion to the Church. The imagery of a tiny flame*
as representing little faith, might well occur on such an
occasion. This case is included in Appendix (8).

December 12, 1904, was walking along the high road when
he saw a faint light playing over his head. As it came
nearer it increased in size, and thinking he was deceived he
closed his eyes, but the light continued. Opening his eyes
again he saw the light again as it were a man's body in a
shining robe. The figure had wings, it did not touch the
ground. He looked at the hand and saw the prints of
the wounds. He shouted—" O my Jesus," and the figure
ascended out of sight. He felt filled with love, and from
that time he can love every one without difference. In the
light of the vision there succeeded a view of the world as a
wild wilderness. In answer to questions this correspondent
says that never before had he had an experience like it : the
vision was in silence. His wife has had some wonderful
experiences, but the account of these is not forthcoming (13).
A young man in Glamorgan having been much influenced
by the Revival determined to do a certain thing unnamed. He
failed to fulfil his promise and then when he tried to pray
there came a reiterated vision of a large white throne empty,
but with the word " Disobedience " written across the front in
black letters. Obedience caused this vision to cease (14).
A woman at Dyffryn writes that at the beginning of the
year she was praying at midnight in a room without a light
when suddenly she found herself in a glorious place in the
midst of song and praise, but she saw no one. Thereupon a
bright light entered the room in the shape of the Ark and
Mercy Seat. It shone brilliantly, she thought there was but
a thin veil between herself and the eternal world : and all
passed away. She had a vision of Christ three years ago. I
asked whether the vision of the Ark was like any picture of
it that she had ever seen, and as her answer was " Yes," we
may place this incident amongst the cases of mental imagery,
the mind utilising stored-up impressions.
In all these instances we have to remember that according
Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival 97
as individual idiosyncrasies and mental habits vary, so do the
outcomes of suggestions and impressions. In some they are
visualised, in others auditised, and again in some the bodily
temperature is affected with no formation of an image or a
sound heard. We may suppose that the whole of the mental
and nervous apparatus within the subject is operative in these
occurrences.
Having heard that the Revival had caused an increase of
lunacy I asked the Medical Superintendent of the Glamorgan
County Asylum for his opinion. From his report (15) I
learn that the increase of insanity cannot be attributed to
the Kevival, for " in only one per cent, of the admissions was
religious excitement deemed to be a contributory factor in
the causation." This was in the last quarter of 1904 and
the same result has been found in 1905.
I now come to that part of the subject which has per
haps caused more excitement in the public mind than any
other feature of the Revival. All my readers must have heard
of the mysterious lights in Merionethshire associated with the
name of Mrs. Jones of Islawrffordd, near Dyffryn. This good
lady is, I am told, a very simple, quiet person, whose life
until recently has been passed in obscurity. Some time ago
she read Sheldon's book, In His Steps, and was much moved
by it. She determined to work for the spiritual good of her
neighbours, and she began her ministry early in December, 1904.
The story is that she is attended by lights of various kinds
wherever she goes, and, as I shall show presently, there is
more in this personal attention than might be supposed. I
am spared the necessity of giving minute details, since Mr.
Beriah G. Evans, a Carnarvon journalist, has taken care to
inform the world as to the lights, and his account of what he
and others have seen may be read in The Occult Review for
March, April, and June, 1905. The numbers are in the S.P.R.
Library. It is important to notice that the coast in the
neighbourhood of Dyffryn has been favoured or disfavoured
with lights of many shapes and sizes in former times. Pennant
in his Tour in Wales gives a full account of the appearances
of mischievous blue flames that alarmed people and did mate
rial damage near Harlech in 1694. Lights of a blue colour
appeared also in the neighbourhood of Pwllheli in 1875, and
98 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
the publication of Mr. Picton-Jones' account of what he then
saw elicited from a correspondent the relation of a similar
occurrence in 1869 or 1870. Again in 1877 lights of various
colours were seen moving over the estuary of the Dysynni.
Through the kindness of the editor of the Oswestry Advertizer
I have received the extracts from his " Bye-gones " columns,
which give the notes on lights for the three years 1869,
1876, and 1877. These are quoted in my Appendix (16).
I am not satisfied with the investigations that have taken
place, and I think now, as I did at the first, that the Society
might well employ a geological expert to go over the district
and discover, if possible, what conditions are present favour
able to the natural production of incandescent vapours. Mr.
Bernard B. Redwood (son of the well-known scientific expert,
Sir Boverton Redwood) was sent down by the Daily Mail in
February, 1905, but his report,1 which I give in the Appen
dix (17), is not to me conclusive. He planned his investigation
on the supposition of electrical disturbance, and I am not
surprised that he was disappointed at the result He says,
with more approximation to what I think is the cause of
some of the lights, that it is just possible that there may
have been some lights caused by spontaneous ignition of phos-
phuretted hydrogen generated in the marsh at Egryn and
distorted by mist. He adds that " Methane or marsh gas is
never self-ignited, and may be left out of the question." With
his personal opinion of Mrs. Jones I am not disposed to
agree ; but granting its truth, we have still to reckon with
the witnesses I shall quote as to the reality of both subjective
and objective lights. The evidence received I proceed to give,
first, however, stating my conviction that Merionethshire has
been the scene of late of a large amount of exaggeration and
misconception, and perhaps trickery. But having made all
allowance for persons who mistook meteors, brightly-shining
planets, farm lanterns, railway signals, and bodies of ignited
gases for tokens of heavenly approval of Mrs. Jones and the
Revival, there remain sufficient instances of abnormal phenoiueua
to encourage further inquiry. Evidence of misapprehensions I
have received.

A vicar in the neighbourhood has sent me the following :
" A very reliable man informed me that one morning last
week [in February, 1905] on looking out through his bedroom
window about 6 a.m. he saw some remarkable lights rising
over the marsh indicating a wave, bluish colour, and ascend
ing up into the heavens and vanishing away, but he did not
in any way connect the light with the Revival in any shape
or form."
Correspondents from whom I have managed to obtain evidence
relate various experiences. Mrs. Jones of Islawrffordd wrote
on January 16th, 1905: "I have seen [the light] every night
from the beginning of the Revival about six weeks ago.
Sometimes it appears like a motor-car lamp flashing and going
out, and injures nothing at all ; other times like two lamps
and tongues of fire all round them, going out in one place
and lighting again in another place far off sometimes ; other
times a quick flash and going out immediately, and when the
fire goes out a vapour of smoke comes in its place ; also a
rainbow of vapour and a very bright star." She said that
the lights were always seen out of doors, and at about six
o'clock in the evening. I asked if they had been seen by any
one who had not been converted, and the answer was " Yes."
A man at Dolgau says (January 25th, 1905): "We have
not seen it now for a fortnight. We saw it for eight nights
some time back at about 11 o'clock. We were afterwards a
week without seeing it, and then we saw it once more. . . .
It was very like the light of a lamp, but not so bright, and
appeared to me to move gradually. Once I saw it move
swiftly. It was in a place where there was no light to be.
It appeared very low down, along the ground, I should think."
In reply to queries he says that the colour was a weak
white light, always very much the same ; it appeared at first
accidentally, it was not expected. There is a ditch running
through a ravine near the spot.
Another correspondent says that only once did he see the
light, on January 2nd, 1905. "It was hovering above a
certain farmhouse, and it appeared to me as three lamps
about three yards apart, in the shape of a Prince of Wales's
feathers, very brilliant and dazzling, moving and jumping like
a sea-wave under the influence of the sun on a very hot day.

100 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
The light continued so for ten minutes. All my family saw
it the same time. It was 10.40 p.m. at the time." My ques
tions were treated by him as evidence of utter unbelief, and
repeated requests for further information met with refusals.
A young woman of some education wrote (February 4th,
1905): "I saw the light you refer to one night in the
beginning of January [between 10 and 10.30 p.m.]. At first
I saw two very bright lights, about half a mile away " [it was
between Dyffryn and Llanbedr], " one a big white light, the
other smaller and red in colour. The latter flashed backwards
and forwards, and finally seemed to become merged in the
other. Then all was darkness again. It did not appear iu
the same place again, but a few minutes after we saw another
light which seemed to be a few yards above the ground. It
now looked like one big flame, and all around it seemed like
one big glare of light. It flamed up and went out alternately
for about ten minutes, very much in the same way as some
lighthouses."
It is probable that the two persons whose accounts I have
just given saw the same light from different points of view.
On December 22nd, 1904, at 5.18 p.m., another deponent
saw, in company with two other persons, a large light " about
half way from the earth to the sky, ou the south side of
Capel Egryn, and in the middle of it something like [a]
bottle or black person, also some little lights scattering around
the large light in many colours. Last of all the whole thing
came to a large piece of fog, out of sight."
Another writer, whose account is given in the Appendix (18),
describes the light as a pillar of fire, quite perpendicular, about
two feet wide and three yards in height.
A correspondent whose opinion, from his position in relation
to some of the persons quoted, I am disposed to trust, says
that the prevailing view in the neighbourhood is that the
lights seen along the coast from Towyn to Portmadoc by scores
of people at divers times between 6 p.m. and midnight, and
in divers forms, are phosphorescent lights, not associated with
any person or building. The light has been seen by many,
Chapel members and non-members alike, and at the same time,
whether Mrs. Jones be at home or away. About Mrs. Jones's
own experiences he declines to express an opinion.
Xi.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 101
Lengthy communications from a husband and wife at Har-
lech, on the same coast, given in the Appendix (19), contain
similar evidence, and some account of earnest endeavours to
see the lights in Mrs. Jones's presence.
I need not refer to other communications received from the
neighbourhood of "Welshpool, save to point out that this locality
is several miles away from the other, and yet the descriptions
•of lights are to some extent similar.
On Wednesday, June 21st, 1905, I interviewed a medical
man in the Rhondda fach, who saw on May 27th, at night, a
globe of light about the size of a cheese plate, or nearly the
apparent diameter of the moon, over the chapel where Mrs.
Jones was that evening preaching. He made sure by com
paring this light with the gas lamps within sight, that it was
not an ordinary lamp. I have had a photograph taken from
the very spot where the doctor stood when he and his wife
saw the light, and have marked on it the place where the
light appeared (see Plate I.). As may be seen from this photo
graph, the background of the chapel, as viewed from the house
front, is the other side of the narrow valley, the black mark
being just over the flat roof of a house on the further side
of the street below. Now it is quite possible that some
one willing to deceive his neighbours might have perched him
self on the mountain side with a powerful lamp ; but why,
in that case, he should select a position from which the light
could only appear to be right over the chapel to a very few
persons, those in or in front of the uppermost terrace of houses,
-and why he should expose the light only for a few minutes,
are points that require explanation. The doctor is in sympathy
with Mrs. Jones, and when he informed her that he had seen
this light she declared that she had also seen it, but from
within the chapel. This case is given in full in the Appen
dix (20).
A second account of a light appearing in the same valley,
about half a mile lower down, and on the opposite side of
the valley, at a much later hour, is also given in the Appendix
(21). This light was somewhat similar to one seen in North
Wales, of which the account is given in (18),—a column of fire
about two feet wide and several feet high, of the tint of a
fiery vapour.
102 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
From the same locality two other accounts (22) have been
sent to me of lights seen about the same time by two women.
Now here are four narratives from the Rhondda fach, but
of the six persons who witnessed the lights four are known
to be North Walians, like Airs. Jones herself, and I think this
fact tends to support my theory that persons of the same
race or tribe have similar modes of mental action. The cases of
collective hallucinations quoted, so far as they are genuine, have
a strong family likeness, and as the seers are all in sympathy
with Mrs. Jones, probably her mind is the originating cause
of the appearances. In my correspondence with these light-
seers I have made a point of asking whether they had any of
them ever seen a corpse light (canwyll gorph). Not one of
them had done so, some of the witnesses had not even heard
of such a thing. The persons who see the corpse light are,
I believe, not from North Wales, but from Cardiganshire, and
possibly are Iberian in race. Professor Barrett has traced the
dowsing faculty to Somersetshire, and if the various forms of
lights seen in Wales could be properly classified we should
no doubt find that as the race-origin so the light-form.
I also suggest a connection between the naturally-caused
lights which have appeared frequently along the coast of
Tremadoc Bay, from Pwllheli round to Barmouth, and the
forms of the subjective appearances which have been described.
The traditional, collective memory of the objective lights may act
as a guide to the imagination, providing it with materials for
picture formation when it is stimulated by a sufficiently exciting
cause. Mental imagery can only employ stored-up impressions ;
however incongruous the various elements, they all may be
drawn upon when occasion serves, and the lights of Dyffryu
are sufficiently common and familiar to become the mnemonic
material of religiously excited minds. Mrs. Jones' obiter dictum,
" lamp flashing and going out and injuring nothing at all," reads
like a reflection of the sub-conscious memory upon the lights
of 1694, which did injure material objects. Of those lights and
their effects Mrs. Jones had most probably read or heard.
The motor car association would not suggest injury, because
whatever mischief motor cars may do, their brilliant lamps are
not the causes of the mischief.
There was a rumour of trickery in the Rhondda fach : some
LL] Psychological Aspects of tlie Welsh Revival. 103
said that young men had got on to the flat roof of a house,
—the only flat roof of a dwelling house that commands a view
of the chapel, Libanus—and caused a light to be projected
from it on to the chapel roof or over it. I went to the
house and the proprietor told me that he had gone on to the
flat roof to watch for the lights. He had a small lantern for
guidance, as the roof is dangerous, having no parapet, but it
would not be possible with so small a lamp to throw a beam of
light or create a disc such as the doctor and his wife saw. The
spot where the doctor stood, the flat roof, and the chapel form
a triangle with the chapel at the apex. Three other instances
of lights seen are given in the Appendix (23), (24), (25).
By way of assisting towards a solution of this matter of the
lights, I have added (26) to the letters from Wales a communi
cation from a friend who saw at a stance held by eight
persons, in a totally dark room, some years ago, five little
lights slowly gyrating near the ceiling of the room. The
hypothesis of fraud in this case he dismisses with contempt.
If we can gather accounts of any considerable number of
similar instances in experiments or stances where the mediums
may be trusted, we may arrive at the causes of Mrs. Jones's
light manifestations.
I have taken care to ask in which cases the lights seen
illuminated surrounding objects, and whether persons not dis
tinctly religious saw them. The answers prove that illumina
tion of walls, buildings, and hedges took place in some
instances, and if so we may dismiss these at once as purely
physical, not psychical. I believe a genuine psychical light
has no power of itself to illuminate distinctly any external
objects. A room may appear to be flooded with light, but I
do not find that the furniture is made more apparent.1
A complete review of the whole subject of the Revival at
this point is not desirable, even if it were possible. We need
far more inquiry, more examination of more witnesses, time
for comparison, also, of the various phenomena with themselves
and with other events in former days. But I hope enough
has been said to encourage some of our members to study
these spiritual movements without prejudice of any kind, and
1This question is discussed in the "Report on the Census of Hallucinations,"

with the certainty that no time is lost which man can devote to
the separation of truth from deception, the deliverance of reason
from passion, and the clearance of faith from superstition.
A few weeks after the above paper was written I heard
of the appearance of "lights" at Ynysybwl, a small colliery
town a few miles north of Pontypridd, Glam., and on
August 2nd, 1905, I visited the town to interview some of
the percipients. Mrs. Jones of Egryn preached at Ynysybwl
on July 4th, 5th and 6th, but there is no trustworthy evi
dence of lights being seen before July 23rd. On that evening
several persons went to Ynysyboeth to hear Mrs. Jones
once more and by all accounts they were very much affected
by the service. On their return to Ynysybwl they held an
open-air meeting, at about 10.30 p.m., in the open space
known as Robert Town Square. The religious fervour was
intense and the service lasted until 1 a.m. One correspondent
(see 27o) reports that his attention was called, during the
service, to a " ball of light about the size of the moon," with
•a slight mist over it. Then stars began to shoot out around
it, the light rose higher and grew brighter but smaller.
Another at the same gathering describes the light as a
" block of fire " rising from the mountain side and moving
along for about 200 or 300 yards. It went upwards, a star
" shot out to meet it, and they clapped together and formed
into a ball of fire." The form changed into something like
the helm of a ship. The appearance lasted about a quarter of
an hour. This deponent went home to fetch his wife to see
the light, but from his house he saw nothing, although the
house faces the same mountain side. Returning to the square
he again saw it (see 27i). A third witness says that the
light was a ball of fire, "glittering and sparkling," and it
seemed to be "bubbling over" (27c). A Mrs. J. and her
daughters saw the light at 12.30 a.m. as a ball of fire, white,
silvery, vibrating, stationary. Mrs. J. also saw two streamers
of grey mist emanating from the ball and in the space
between them a number of stars (27rf). The daughter saw
nothing of the stars, but remarks, as no one else does, that
tfie form became oval instead of round (27c). In conversation
they told me also that the ball decreased in size. Another

witness, whose account lias not been writteu, described his
vision to me as a ball of fire with 4 or 5 pillars of light on
the left of the ball, the intervening space containing no stars.
He was standing near the last-named witnesses. It will be
sufficient here to point out that whilst all the witnesses saw
a ball of fire, each saw something in connection therewith
not mentioned by the others. All agree in thinking that the
duration of the light was from 10 to 15 minutes, but whether
" vision " minutes are of the same duration as those of solar
time remains to be proved. There is no evidence that any one
consulted a watch or clock to mark the time that really elapsed.
On July 2Gth, at a meeting of the Salvation Army, in the
same square, Mr. D. D. tells me that he saw over a wood on
the mountain side a black cloud from which emerged first a
white light, then a yellow, and finally a brilliantly red
triangle. The vision lasted about 2 minutes (? vision time).
Standing on the spot whence D. D. saw the succession of
lights, I noticed that on the hoarding which fences the side
walk there were four very prominent posters well within the
circle of vision as one looked towards the wood over which
the light appeared. The posters, read from left to right, as a
book is read, gave exactly the sequence of colours as described.
The accompanying view (Plate II.) is marked so as to show
the order. But for the lateness of the hour, 10.30 p.m., we
might attribute the appearances to a transfer of visual impres
sions from the hoarding to the sky. In that case, however,
the colours seen would have been the compiementaries of those
actually witnessed. The conclusion is that the colour sequence
was mnemonic, the imagination using colour and form materials
absorbed during daylight. The triangular form of the third
light was a reminiscence either of the upper part of the red
poster or of the " Bass " advertisement on the further right.
The photograph was taken close to the spot where D. D. stood.
The suggestion of unconscious utilisation of stored impressions
will not be thought unreasonable by those who have examined
many " vision " cases.1 I have ascertained that the posters in
question were all in situ on or before July 23rd.

Subliminal Consciousness " in Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 450-54 ; also iu

106 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
In the same town on July 30th at midnight a Mrs. O.,
whom I have seen, called the attention of my friend, Mr. J.
R. J., who lives next door to her, to a ball of fire or torch
which she saw travelling over the hill side to the north of
Ynysybwl, rather more than a mile, as the crow flies, from
her house. Three relatives of Mrs. O., with her and Mr. J.
R. J., watched the light moving about in a zig-zag from the
top of the hills to the valley below, across fields and hedges,
for about 20 minutes. The night was dark; the light went
out at intervals and reappeared. It does not appear possible
that any person could have borne a powerful lamp over the
area pointed out to me, or have moved from point to point
so rapidly as the light travelled, the apparent rate being
six miles an hour. There is no evidence discoverable of bodies
of ignited gases having been seen in the locality previously,
and one of the witnesses was not in the least affected by
the Revival efforts of Mrs. Jones. There is no solution of
this incident at present. It may have been, as the Robert
Town Square appearance was, a case of collective hallucina
tion, but there was no immediate mental excitement at
work as on the night of the 23rd. Careful examination of
the appended letters can hardly fail to strengthen the idea of
collective hallucination modified or tempered by individual
idiosyncrasies, the originating mind being Mrs. Jones's, in the
case of the Robert Town vision. I have taken care not
to report other reputed light visions of which the testimony
is not considered, locally, to be worth very much, and it
may be well to note that, according to trustworthy information,
I understand that the ministers of some of the chapels are
exercising praiseworthy caution in accepting the reports of
visions. Their attitude is wholesomely sceptical.
Visiting the Garw Valley, on the western side of Mid-
Glamorgan, a few days ago, I interviewed a tradesman who
also saw a light or lights after Mrs. Jones's visit to that
valley. But his written account has not yet come to hand.
Several correspondents have expressed a desire for some
satisfactory explanation of the lights seen in Glamorganshire
and elsewhere, but, until many more authentic cases of the
kind are collected and compared, their wish must remain un
satisfied. The lights seen in July were, I believe, not any of
LI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 107
them due to extraneous physical causes. If they are called
subjective, the term must be held only to be equivalent to
an operation within the physical limits of the percipients, and
the lights must be considered in relation to the sounds and
changes of bodily temperature experienced by several persons
elsewhere, as related in this paper and Appendix. In the
ascending scale of vibrations the order is sound, heat, and light
waves. Is it probable that persons affected by such stimuli
as the Revival provided heard, felt, or saw according (1) to
the intensity of the stimulus in each case, and (2) to the
susceptibility of the percipient ? If one man's mental organs
were excited to a certain degree, he would hear a voice ; if
to a higher degree, he would experience a vision ; either opera
tion, however, being entirely within the brain of the sub
ject. I advance the theory of physical vibratory operation
with considerable hesitation, and only because I am not satis
fied with the proposal to attribute the occurrences either to
diseased imagination (if by that term is meant a species of
self-deception) or to some mental operation apart or distinct
from the organism by which the mind works. If a sharp
blow upon a certain portion of the head causes a man to
" see stars," may it not be possible for a mental stimulus from
without to act in a similar way ? When it is known how
mind can affect mind at a distance it will be possible, per
haps, to explain the operation within a man's self which
interprets stimuli now as sound, now as heat, or again in
vision. My chief concern here is to ask that the three
kinds of experiences may be examined in correlation and all
of them with due regard to the ascertained laws of vibration
and modes of energy. The theory may be put thus :
A. Agent, exercising influence and suggesting form.
B. Recipient of mental stimulus whose brain translates
the message into sound, heat, or light form accord
ing to its own capacity of motion.
In this inquiry the physical and the psychical cannot safely
be dissevered, however necessary it may be to specialise for
the sake of adequate research.

CIRCULAR USED IN THE INQUIRY.
From the Rev. A. T. Fryer, 2 Newport Road, Cardiff.
DEAR SIR,—-A great many members of the Society for Psychical
Research (abroad as well as in England), being interested in the
Revival in Wales, are desirous of having placed on record in the
Society's rooms as many authentic narratives as possible of first-hand
personal experiences of the movement.
I have been requested also to obtain trustworthy information for
the Society on those incidents and aspects of the Revival which
illustrate or are concerned with the mental and psychical, rather than
the moral and spiritual, sides of human nature, and include such
things as visions, voices, lights, foretellings, inspirations in prayer or
preaching, the sense of spiritual elevation or ecstasy, things which
may or may not have a permanent or moral effect, but that have
actually occurred.
May I ask your kind co-operation in getting such evidence t
Wherever possible, it would be better to have the narratives in the
handwriting of the persons who can relate their own experiences ;
but all narratives written by them or by any one else should be
signed and dated by the persons to whom the incidents occurred. . . .
Appended are some notes which will serve to guide those who are
good enough to help the Society in this investigation.
N.B.—No names will be published without permission.
1. Persons affected by the Revival should be asked to say how
the impulse to prayer or song first arose.
2. It is important to discover, if possible, what circumstances or
promptings led up to the Revival in various districts.
3. If eloquence in prayer on the part of unlettered persons has
been noticed, it would be well to find out whether or no the language
or phraseology was that of the Bible or any other spiritual literature.
4. The previous manner of life of persons affected (and of their
parents, if possible) should be noted.
Li.] Psychological Aspect-s of the Welsh Revival. 10!>
5. In the case of visions or voices, etc., it will be useful to learn
whether the subjects have previously had similar experiences.
6. One well-authenticated case is worth more to the Society than
many of the mere hearsay type.
7. In any case, the observations of recipients of this circular will
be of value ; if particular cases of abnormal character are not available,
general impressions may be sent.

From the Rev. I. E., Pontardulais, January 30th, 1905.
He gives here a written account of what he related to me in
October, 1904.
... I have not been there in any of the meetings, and therefore
the little knowledge I have concerning it comes from others, which
cannot be always reliable.
... I consider the present Revival, or re-awakening or any other
name that one may choose to call it, is the work of God,—an answer
to the former prayers of the faithful. No place or man can have
a claim to its beginning. . . .
However, ... I will state what I have heard. Early last year there
was a Convention at New Quay which impressed many. Some weeks
after a young girl was stirred by a sermon from the Pastor of her
chapel, and about 9 p.m. she went to the minister's house, saying : "I
want to see you particularly. I have walked about a dozen times
back and fore in front of your house this evening, afraid to come
in, yet I could not go home before seeing you. You stated in your
sermon this evening of a certain state of happiness which every
Christian could attain. I try to live a Christian life, yet I have never
attained that state yet."
Minister: "Is there anything troubling you, or are you afraid that
yon are not saved 1 "
The Girl: "No, I am not afraid of losing heaven; but what is it
to be safe alone, when so many around me are totally regardless of
their own salvation ? What I want is to do more work for Him,
to have more pleasure in His service, to attain that state you spoke
about this evening." (She was intensely earnest.)
Minister-: "Well, it can be obtained on condition—that you give
yourself entirely unto Him, and let Him do with you as He pleases."
The Girl: "Ah! but He might ask me some difficult things.
110 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
What if He asked me to go out to Africa for Him ? I could not
.lo it."
Minister: "That is the only condition—He will ask from you
difficult things ; undoubtedly He will."
The Girl: "Pray for me."
Minister : " Submit ; submit first."
Afterwards, in a week-night meeting, he asked the members to
give their spiritual experience. He beckoned to this girl. She
•cried, and prayed. Others after came to him, and said that they
were pricked by their consciences, and wanted to confess to him
their sins. He said, "Confess them to God." Then things went on
there as they are here now.
Any further information I will most gladly give. I may add that
I spent a day at Llandrindod last August in the Keswick Con
ference. A clergyman, F. B. Meyer, and Madame Penn-Lewis gave
addresses. Few attended, yet I felt the same power there—some
thing unaccountable. Next March Evan Roberts will visit this place
again.

From Mr. J. P., Headmaster of the school attended by
Evan lloberts when preparing for the ministry :
NEWCASTLE EMLYN, June '10th, 1905.
. . . Mr. Evan Roberts wrote to me from Loughor during my Easter
holidays 1904, asking for particulars about the school, and stating
that he intended coming here the following Summer term. He did
not, however, come until the middle of September, 1904—for the
commencement of session 1904-'05. During the few weeks that he
attended school he showed that he had a capacity and aptitude for
work considerably above the average. On Friday of the fourth week
and Monday of the fifth he was absent from school, being confined
to his room with a very bad cold. On the Sunday Mr. Seth Joshua
commenced a week's mission at Bethel C.M. Church, and on Tuesday
evening several young ladies from New Quay came over to help.
After coming home from the meeting on that night, I heard that
Roberts had been there too, although his cold was still very bad,
and I felt annoyed with him, especially when I learnt that he was
out without an overcoat ! I had no opportunity for " lecturing " him
on the matter, until I saw him on the Wednesday night standing up to
confess Christ at the invitation of Mr. Joshua. He also came forward
and knelt in prayer—the most agonising soul-struggle which I had

ever witnessed, although I was surprised, when I spoke to him of it
during his period of rest at this place before he went to Liverpool,
that he had not much recollection of it, owing perhaps to its having
been overshadowed by what transpired at Blaenanerch on the
following day. It was here that the turning-point came, and, as he
says, he was "bent." I should have said that Roberts was accom
panied from here by many friends, including Mr. Joshua and the
New Quay ladies, to Blaenanerch. The meetings that were held
there had for their object the deepening of spiritual life and convic
tion, and were one of a series of very successful conventions held
by the Calvinistic Methodists of South Cardiganshire in various
places—the first at New Quay some 18 months previously. After
Blaenanerch, Roberts was here for about three weeks. But I could
not get him to come to school. I was terribly anxious about him,
and liad grave fears for his condition, because at the time I was
totally unable to appreciate the mighty forces working in him. I
knew that he spent almost all his time in prayer, meditation, and
reading the Bible, but that did not make my anxiety any the less.
I thought it would be a good thing to get him out of himself, as
it were. and I used to call with him every morning at his lodgings
to entreat him to come to school. With smiles and tears inter
mingled, and genuineness writ plainly on his face, he would say that
he was very sorry, but that he was not able to do any school work,
and that it would be no use for him to come to school in that state.
He used to tell me that he loved school work (and I knew it), but
that as soon as he would lay hold of a school-book, he felt the
Spirit coming on him, crushing him, and that it was only by
I'Utting the book aside that he obtained relief. As he said this, a
tremor would run through him and his face and neck were seen to
quiver in a remarkable way. All this, however, only served to
make me more earnest than ever in trying to get him to school,
and one morning I succeeded in inducing him to come with me,
after telling him that he need not come up to classes, but might
go on with Algebra. I believe that he came to please me, being
afraid that he might appear obstinate. At least, that is my impres
sion. That was the last occasion on which he came to school. He
and Sidney Evans had been invited to a monthly meeting at
Bwkhygroes, and they went on the afternoon of that day. From
that time forward he was getting more and more of an enigma to
me and to all who took an interest in him. About this time he
besran to have visions—you have undoubtedly read descriptions of
H
112 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
these in the press—and he related them to my father and others.
While in chapel on Sunday night, he heard a voice calling him to-
go home to Loughor to speak to the young people of Moriah (his
own chapel). He came to my father's house on that night and
related to him his experience. My father at last told him that he
had better go to try. But if nobody had told him anything, no-
power would have held him back. On Monday morning he went
The rest of his history you probably know better than I can
describe.
On looking back at these strange events, I cannot help being
amused at myself and my anxiety for Roberts. It was very little I
understood how the Spirit of God was working in him for a special
purpose. It all seems so plain now.
Behind all this it is important to remember that Roberts was for
12 or 13 years living in close proximity to God, and that his prayers
during that time were fitting him for the great work to which he
has been called.
There is one point I forgot to mention : When he was here a
short time ago, I asked him why he did not come to school directly
after he had first written to me. The explanation was that as a
result of wrestling with the Spirit the way was not made clear
for him. . . .

From Mr. J. G., Nantymoel, Glam.
May, 1905.
I attended five meetings conducted by Evan Roberts ; rather, meet
ings in which he took part. The meetings were held in different
places under different circumstances. Each meeting had a complexion
and a character of its own, essentially different in that respect from
a series of Parochial Mission services. Each meeting stands forth
in my recollection like a masterpiece in art.
But I was able to detect a uniform method in the five meetings ;
rather, I was able to make out certain things, each and all indispen
sable apparently, which conditioned each meeting, leaving out of
consideration at . present the elements which make every religious
service a success.
(1) The Welsh language was indispensable. In two of the meet
ings, some well-intentioned Englishmen, evidently practised in "revival
work," nearly put out what the reporters describe as the "fire."
But fortunately Welsh in each case reasserted itself.
Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 113
(2) The meetings revealed the marvellous conformity of the popular
Christianity of Wales. It is a conformity which is shared by Welsh
Churchmen as well as Welsh Nonconformists. I refer particularly
to the
(a) Use of the same hymns and tunes.
(6) Scripture knowledge as shown by apt quotation at the impulse
of the moment.
(e) A most homogeneous body of revival divinity. No matter to
what sect the speaker belonged, he was orthodoxy itself.
(3) To this conformity in outward expression must be added the
welding power of united prayer, which in each case had preceded
Roberts' arrival.
(4) Evan Roberts tests a meeting before he begins to speak.
What is most provoking to many of his hearers seems to me the
clearest human explanation of his success in bringing each meeting
to a dramatic and sensational climax. His apparent indifference and
immobility for an hour or so before he says anything breaks up all
the composure an audience of human beings can command. Add to
this his habit of transfixing each and every person present with his,
not unpleasant, but homage-compelling gaze. For a long time he
reviews methodically the rows upon rows of faces. It is the gaze
of the practised physician. By the time he gets up to speak he
has made a mental report or census of his audience. He knows what
souls are ill at ease. He predicts conversions, and he detects hin
drances. He is doubtless a man of faith, relying on the promptings
of the Holy Spirit, but he is not a man who neglects picking up
all the data available by human means concerning the condition of
his audience. He first waits for his audience to reveal itself to him,
and then gets up and tells the people just what they knew already,
but they are puzzled and staggered by the fact that this meteoric
stranger should know them so well. The result in thousands of
cases is an impression which was the means of reclaiming the woman
of Samaria (St. John iv. 29, 39), "He told me all that ever I
did."
(5) His "break-downs," or what some of his unsympathetic critics
call "contortions," must be taken into account. In three out of five
meetings I witnessed three of his nervous collapses, and I was on
each occasion near enough to him to render "first-aid" if necessary.
I could not believe that he was " shamming." He would cry " his
heart out," his tears and sobs affecting the most callous present.
On two occasions I saw him placing one hand on his neck, as if
114 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
pressing something down, or controlling himself where he felt weakest.
There was a jerking backward of the head which, as I am not a
physician, I will not venture to describe, but I have noted the same
thing in persons whose nervous system was somewhat deranged. I
think the hand pressing on the neck may be explained in that way.
Such involuntary concomitants of the " collapse " made me feel quite
sure that it was a collapse.
But though no " shamming," the " collapse " was most effective in
evoking whatever sympathy the audience had hitherto withheld.
There was in each case a burst of prayer throughout the building
when the revivalist was in such distress. And as he had a way of
recovering suddenly, there was a burst of praise the moment he
stood up again.
I write as I observed and felt. A meeting with Evan Roberts
turns Welsh human nature inside out. I wonder if a bad man,
however clever he might be, could play so effectively with his
audience. In this case it is most fortunate that the man is thoroughly
good, and discreet with the discretion of a saint. So I believe.

Report by " Awstin," special correspondent of the Western
Mail, of interview with Mr. Evan Roberts immediately after
the seven days' silence. (Western Mail, March 3rd, 1905).
Mr. Evan Roberts said : " On the evening of last Wednesday week
I was getting ready to go to the service at Briton Ferry. I had
my overcoat on, my gloves in my hand, and my hat on my head,
when a voice said, ' Don't go.' I ought to have told you that before
that, before I came downstairs, while I was washing, a voice had
said in Welsh, 'Paid myn'd i Briton Ferry' ('Don't go to Briton
Ferry '), and then, when I got down to the passage, as I have
told you, the voice said, ' Don't go.' We were all ready then, and
Mr. Mardy Davies was here. Then I felt some pressure (a burden)
on my soul. I went back into the room, sat on a chair, and was
compelled to pray for the salvation of souls. Then came a second
outburst, a greater burden than the other, and I was com
pelled to go on my knees in great agony of soul. The voice
continued to say, ' Don't go tonight.' Then I tried to convey the
message to Mr. Mardy Davies, but I failed, so I was compelled
to write it down. About that time a voice said, 'You are to be
silent for seven days.' The sisters were here at the time, and
LI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 115
after Mr. Mardy Davies left they were asked in writing to
sing 'Lead, kindly Light.' The singing was tender and solemn,
and they cried as they sang, ' One step enough for me.' They
afterwards sang, ' I need Thee every hour,' and were deeply affected
as they sang :
Mi lyna'n dawel wrth Dy draed,
Mi ganaf am Dy werthfawr waed ;
Mi garia'r groes, mi nofia'r don,
Ond cael Dy anian dan' fy mron.
" Presently one of the sisters asked, ' What are we to do 1 '
The answer was, 'Wait until I receive an explicit message from
heaven. He has suggested (this word was doubly underlined in
the book) that one of you should go home and the other remain
with me.' After a space of time, and much prayer, the answer
came : ' Annie to remain here to wait upon me, and Mary to go
home for holidays, or to go with Maggie and Dan.' "
In the last paragraph I am quoting the memorandum-book, and
I must explain that ' Mary ' means Miss Mary Davies (Gorseinon),
' Maggie ' Miss Maggie Davies (Maesteg), and ' Dan ' Mr. Dan
Roberts.
On Thursday morning the book contained the instruction (to
Miss Annie Davies) :
" There is no person except yourself to see me for the next
seven days—not even my father and mother. I am not ill. Tell
Mary to inform Dan that he need not trouble, for it is the Lord's
will."
I may here add from my personal knowledge that Mr. Dan
Roberts received that message and acted upon it, although he took
the first opportunity available on Thursday after the silence had
been broken to see his brother.
"Tell him (continued the note) not to come, for he cannot see
me. I cannot see Mary or Maggie."
FIRST DAY.
Continuing to quote from the book, Mr. Evan Roberts read :
"On the Tuesday, at 4.22 p.m., I asked the Lord for a message
and received the answer, 'Isaiah liv. 10.' A voice spoke plainly
in English and Welsh. It was not an impression, but a voice.
There was at this time a struggle going on in my mind as to
what the people would say to this."
116 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
SECOND DAY.
On the second day it is noted :—
" Referring to the first day's silence, my experience of the first
day was Genesis i. 2—'Darkness was upon the face of the deep.
But, praise His Holy name, the Spirit of the Lord moved upon
the face of the waters. On the second day God has given a com
mand, ' Let there be light.' Let there be light ; light has come
into my soul, but this perpetual watching fills my sky with dark
clouds—hovering and weary on their way to the West—a seven
days' journey. It is always a seven days' journey to perpetual
rest. Life is only a seven days' journey.
"I cannot read my Bible properly, for while I read I may see
some wonder, and just then give a word of acclamation, and thus
rob this silence of its strength, for silence is a mighty weapon.
I would prefer being like Ezekiel, unable to speak. If I were
unable to speak there would be no need for this watching. Yet
possibly the lesson intended to be taught is to be watchful. I
must teach myself to say with my beloved Jesus, ' Thy will be
done."'
THIRD DAY.
11.30 third day—Saturday. "A wave of joy into my heart to
day about 11.30—the sound of the name of 'Jesus, Jesus,' uttered
in my ear came to me, and 1 was ready to jump for joy, and
I thought He is enough for me, enough for all men—enough for
all to all eternity. On this third day I was commanded not to
read my Bible—the day would have been easier for me otherwise."
"A caller from Australia sent in a letter," said Mr. Roberts
to me, " and this is one item of what I wrote on the back of the
letter, which I returned to him." (And he again referred me to
the book). "Send your prayers to Heaven as direct as you send
this (letter) to me, and God will answer immediately."
Upon looking at the book I noticed that, besides this item,
Mr. Roberts had written on the latter twelve questions bearing
upon prayer. On another page of the book Mr. Evan Roberts
had written—"Let my conversation be such as could be printed
and read by the public without raising a blush upon my cheek.
Live a practical life—a life of faith, so that if I leave Wales
without a penny in my pocket I shall be satisfied."
everting to the conversation with regard to the first day's silence,
LJ.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 117
Mr. Roberts said :—" On the margin of a newspaper which was
tear-stained I wrote to say that my tongue was tied, and that I
should not speak. When I was left alone the spirit said, 'Now,
watch, and don't utter a word.' I was afraid, but found out on
retiring to my room that it was not want of power to speak on
my part that prevented me speaking, so that it was evident that
it was intended to be a lesson to me in obedience."
Then, coming back to the diary, I noticed a memo, to this
sffect:—"Third lesson. Speak, Lord, in such a way that I may
differentiate Thy voice from the cunning of the Evil One."
I then asked him what this meant, and he said that it was a
thought which he had written down after meditating upon the
bare possibility of listening to the voice of the Evil One instead
of that of God.
FOURTH DAY.
A Sunday thought, which I must note in passing, was this :
"6.30 a.m. Wait not until thou goest unto Heaven before
beginning to praise the Blood. To praise the Blood in Heaven
cannot bring any one soul to accept it. To praise is worthy—
if thou canst, by singing the praise of Jesus on earth, bring but
one soul to accept Him, it will be a greater thing than all the
praise beyond the grave to eternity."
Referring again to the diary, I remarked that here was, I pre
sumed, another thought jotted down as the days wore on. "Fourth
day. I am going to be what God wants me to be." Mr. Evan
Roberts said, "Yes."
FIFTH DAY.
On the fifth day was this note, which clearly indicates the burden
which the silence entailed upon the evangelist :—" Too tired to
write." Later on were these notes :
" I have been very near to God this afternoon—so near as to make
me sweat."
"I must take great care, first, to do all that God says—com
mands—and that only. Moses lost himself here—struck the rock.
Second, to take every matter, however insignificant, to God in
prayer. Joshua lost himself here ; he made a covenant with the
Gibeonites, who pretended that they lived in a far-off country,
while they were living close at hand. Third, to give obedience to
the Holy Spirit. Fourth, to give all the glory to Him."
118 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
Mr. Evan Roberts explained to me that the underlining of the-
word "all" in the last sentence was emphatic. He had drawn
three lines under the word, and a voice told him to put a fourth.
And he put it. Then came this entry on the book : " Here am
I, an empty vessel ; take me, Lord ! "
And following this was the expression of a desire to go to
Palestine, and I give it because the same book contains a striking
sequel to it :
"I want to go to Palestine," it read. "If it is the Lord's will,
I shall go. I should like to go ere long, just to use my experi
ences afterwards to draw people to the foot of the Gross. I should
like to walk on the slopes of Calvary, and while there think of
the Blessed Saviour while He wended His way with heavy-laden
steps to its summit."
The next item in the diary was in Welsh :
"9.37. I have a mind to shout 'Three cheers for Jesus," or,
as 'Tuduo' (a noted Welsh bard) sang—
" Of Heaven and earth, the topic now I sing,
The Godlike Man of this world and the next."
SIXTH DAY.
Then come more memoranda, and among those the sequel to
the Palestine wish—" Sixth day. You remember I said I would
like to go to Palestine. Yes. Well, you know I said that I
should have no money to go. Well, a lady has written me to
day offering to give me £20 towards ' one of the delightful ' trips
to Palestine ! Diolch ! "
"6.25 a.m. A Voice: The faith of the people is being proved
as much as thine own. Did I not sustain thee during your months
on the pinnacle, in sight of the whole world ? If sustain thee I
could in public, is my power less to sustain thee in private 1 If
I sustained thee during four months, can 1 not sustain thee for
seven days?
"5.21.—Voice: Take thy pen and write:—Lo, I am the Lord,
Who hath lifteth thee up from the depth. I have sustained thee
thus far. Lift up thine eyes and look on the fields, and, behold,
they are white. Shall I suffer thee to spread a table before Mine
enemies ? As I live, saith the Lord, the windows of Heaven shall
be opened and the rain shall come down on the parched earth.
With flowers the wilderness shall yet be decked, and the meadow-
and shall be the habitation of kings. The ground shall sprout

and blossom in its fulness, and the Heaven shall look down with
laughter upon the riches of the earth, yielding glory unto God.
Open thine hand, and I will fill it with power. Open thy mouth,
and I will fill it with wisdom. Open thine heart, and I will fill
it with love. Look towards the west, and call thousands ; towards
the south, and say 'Come'; towards the north, and say, 'Draw
nigh.' Look towards the east, towards the east, towards the east,
and say, ' Let the sun arise and shed forth its warmth. Let life
spring up. Let the nations which have rejected My name live.'
To kings turn thyself and say, 'Bend.' To knights, 'Submit ye.'
To the priests, 'Deal out judgment, pity, forgiveness.' Ye islands,
seas, and kingdoms, give ear unto Me, I am the Almighty. Shall
I lift My rod over you ? Did I not swear by the prophet Isaiah :
I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth
in righteousness, and shall not return. That unto Me every knee
shall bow, every tongue shall swear ? "—Isaiah xlv. 23.
SEVENTH DAY.
'•Seventh day."—Under this heading the memorandum is:
"5.17.—At my table, tears in my eyes. Why? I have just
been opening my heart to my Master, and said that I am only
a worker in His fields, doing my best, while others working for
the same Master leave His work to come to hinder me. [This
refers, so he explained to me, to some of the critical and sarcastic
letters which he receives now and again.] I asked my dear Master
to protect me. I want to work for my Saviour. Why cannot we
have the millions for Him 1 He died to save millions. How many
can I bring to Him ? I feel much stronger now God has answered
my prayer."
BREAKING OF THE SILENCE.
Then, coming to the breaking of the silence, Mr. Evan Roberts
said that the first word uttered was not to any human being, but
to God. " I was first commanded to rise from bed (Cyfod o'r
gwely). Bend thy knees (Plyg dy liniau). Open thy lips and
pray (Agor dy enau a gweddia). The first words I uttered were :
'Derbyn fi' ('Accept me')." "Then when I got out of the room,"
continued Mr. Roberts, "I saw Mr. Jones, my host, and we greeted
each other very cordially. Then I met and spoke to Mrs. Jones,
and a little while afterwards Annie Davies arrived, and I had a few
words' conversation with her. Then you came."

Evan Roberts at C.M. Chapel, Liverpool, April, 1905.
At half-past ten the Rev. J. W. called upon the audience to recite
the Lord's Prayer to close the service. 211 had already accepted
Christ that night. After the Lord's prayer was gone through, Evan
Roberts said to the audience, "You can go home if you wish, I
cannot go from here, because the work is not finished yet. There
is a man here in the struggle now." A test was made, but no one
would surrender himself. He prayed silently in the pulpit again,
and after he finished some one in the congregation shouted, " Will
you kindly say, Mr. Roberts, in what part of the building the man
is 1 That will facilitate matters." Roberts prayed again, and said
afterwards that the man was not in the middle nor the sides of the
chapel. Now it was clear that he must have been on the gallery.
Before a test was made on the gallery, a minister asked the Rev.
J. W. to test in English as well as Welsh because that there were
some there who could not understand Welsh. E. Roberts interrupted
at once and said, " No, there is not a word of English to be now,
the man in question is a Welshman." The gallery was tested and
some were sitting in the two wings, but not one of them would
yield. Roberts prayed again and said that the man was not in
either of the wings, hence he could not be anywhere but on the
portion of the gallery the further end of the chapel. This again
was tested and all stood on their feet. He prayed again and said,
"The man must be there, for I am drawn to that direction every
time I pray." Another test was made by asking the people to raise
their right hands. All did this, and the minister who was going
round that part of the gallery said, "I cannot see one here with
his hand down." The revivalist prayed once more, and at the end
said, " The man has decided now, and he is by the door on the
left." In a few seconds a man confessed that he had deceived the
audience each time, and that it had now become too hard for him,
and that he was giving himself up.
After this, Roberts said to me and the Rev. J. W., "You can go
home if you wish, but I cannot. The work is not finished." In
a few minutes an Englishman came in from behind the pulpit
Roberts was engaged in silent prayer at the time. This man gave
himself up and Roberts said, "I can go home now, the work is
led." This Englishman related his experience afterwards in the
of the audience, and said that he was going towards

influence drawing him towards . Although he knew that all
would be carried on in Welsh there, and consequently that he would
not be able to understand a word, he found himself in the chapel
somehow and was captivated entirely by the singing. He struggled
with his feelings and went out to the nearest public house, called for
a pint of ale, made three attempts to drink it, but failed each time.
He felt his arm as if it had been paralysed each time he tried.

Accounts by "Awstin."
I.
June 26th, 1905.
At Chapel, Penydarren, Mr. Evan Roberts declared that,
if he was not mistaken, everybody present in that meeting was
going to " come to Christ " that day. I, myself, understood that to
mean during that service, and I was somewhat curious as to whether
the prediction would be fulfilled.
Presently, a young man in the gallery pointing to some one sitting
in the body of the chapel, urged him to "come now," and added,
" I know you have been blaspheming the name of Jesus Christ
before now, but come now, William," and he began to pray for the
salvation of the man (said by some to be a relative). A young
woman in the gallery also prayed for the same man and also
appealed to him, while she wept bitterly. Some of the " workers "
talked to the man referred to, and presently one of them said the
man "wanted more light." "What light does he want?" asked
Evan Roberts. There was no answer for a while, until one of the
" workers " said " He does not see his way clear." Evan Roberta's
answer was, "Pray for him," and the meeting proceeded.
Then a young woman stood up in the gallery and said, "I cannot
see my way clear to come to-day"—a voluntary public statement
of a kind I had never previously heard made, by a woman, at any
rate. Prayers were offered and the meeting proceeded again until
E. R. declared that there was some obstacle in the meeting which
needed removal. He said he did not know what it was. Then he
prayed, and agonised, the only words I could hear him utter (and
I sat immediately facing the pulpit, in the "big pew") were (in
Welsh) "0 Lord, remove it." Suddenly, he stopped and said the
122 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART

H
obstacle had been removed, but that he did not know what it was.
Some one present must know, and he hoped that person would say.
There was no answer, and the meeting was brought to a close
rather abruptly.
Rev. T. S asked me if I knew what the declaration meant.
I said I did not, but would ask Roberts. At tea I asked him, and
he said he did not know, but that it would yet be revealed—to
some one.
That night 1 and Mr. S. and Dr. M. (London Pastors' College)
went to another chapel to hear Evan Roberts.
When I met Mr. S. two days later he told me that he had had
the sequel to the mysterious declaration as to the removal of the
obstacle at the meeting. The pastor of that chapel (Mr. O.)
had told him that on the night of the declaration a service was
held at (although Roberts was at the other chapel), and
that at the "infidel" of the afternoon service had got up to
say that the " obstacle " removed during Evan Roberta's agonising
prayer was the doubt in his (the infidel-atheist's) mind ; that he
was a strong-willed man, and positively determined not to publicly
admit it when Roberts asked the person who knew to say ; that he
had gone home at the close of the afternoon meeting, but could
get no peace of mind until he now came to declare his conversion
and to explain what had taken place in the afternoon.
The young woman who could not see her way clear in the after
noon also came to the • meeting that night, and thus seemingly
fulfilled E. R.'s prediction, for all others in the afternoon had stood
up to declare themselves followers of Christ when the " tests " were
put.
II.
Travelling alone in first class carriage, and having nothing to do,
I began cogitating as to what I would say that day if I were Evan
Roberts. I wrote two pages on my note-book—making special
reference to the (then) coming Christmas, and using in one phrase
the words, "Y Crist" (The Christ). I had never heard E. R. use
that description of the Saviour, and do not know why I used it.
I saw E. R. on his arrival at Treherbert—in presence of others—
had no conversation at all with him as to what I had written
y note-book. He went to have some tea, and I went to the
:ng. He followed, later on, and to my astonishment began his
with the same words as I had written in my book, including
LL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 123
After writing two pages I had stopped, remarking to myself,
"What a ridiculous thing to write, for I am not Evan Roberts."
N'ow, however, E. R. went on further than I had written, and when
we met, later on, at the house of Mr. E. D., I showed E. R.
the notes. He said, "Very good." I asked what they were. He
ttid, " Notes of my address to-day." I asked him if he knew when
I wrote them. He said, " No." I told him they were written about
an hour and a half before he delivered them, and showed him, on
subsequent pages of the same note-book, my shorthand notes of the
actual address.

From the Rev. W. M. M., of Maesteg, S. Wales.
May 31s/, 1905.
(1) The (to me) most remarkable part of the phenomenon called
the '• Religious Revival " was the ecstatic utterance of illiterate young
men and young women. In St. Mary the Virgin's Church, Garth,
between '20 and 30 young people took part in extempore prayer
regularly at each service (or after-service) for about six weeks.
Previous to the Revival not one of these had ever attempted to
engage in public extempore prayer, and for the last two months
they have all "relapsed" into their former state of silence and
calmness of mind. Their utterances consisted for the most part of
Bible and Prayer Book expressions, so arranged and fitted together
as to form a coherent and beautifully worded prayer.
During the short period indicated above I heard dozens of
players that for piquancy of expression, richness of cadence, and
fervency of utterance would have done credit to a St. Chrysostom.
And this from the mouths of young folk whose knowledge would
hardly be level with the present-day requirements of the fourth
standard !
I asked more than one where or in what manner he had had his
prayer. The answer I invariably got was : " I didn't have it any
where, sir; it came to me at the time, and I couldn't help praying."
All the young people who took part in these services are members
of our Sunday school, and they are nearly all communicants. In
age they ranged from fifteen to twenty-five.
(2) A remarkable change took place in the countenances of these
young people when under the influence of the spiritual spell. T
observed that they became very pale, and their eyes wore a far-away
124 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
listless look. One young man told me that for some days after a
certain service in which he had prayed, he saw people move like
ghosts in the street, and thought there was a thick mist.
(3) We had one remarkable conversion. C. R. G., an irregular
member of my congregation, and an unbeliever in the divinity
of our Lord, had a vision during a revival service. He saw
a lit candle emerge from the font of St. Mary's Church, and
the figure of an angel shielding it with his wing from the draught
that came from the open door. The flame, he said, was very small,
and the least breath of air would have extinguished it, but for the
protection of the angel wing. Before the end of the service the
young man got up and publicly renounced his heresy. On Christmas
Day he was baptised by immersion in the brook Cerdin.
(4) A young man by the name of B. prayed very fervently at
one of our Sunday evening revival services for the salvation of
his father. Early on the morrow he received a telegram to say
that his father had died very suddenly on Sunday evening. It
transpired that his father passed away just at the time that he
was praying, or shortly after.
Young B. explained to me that he was moved by an irresistible
impulse to engage in prayer on behalf of his father, although as
far as he knew there was no particular reason for it. His father,
up to the hour of his death, was apparently in perfect health. The
young man had never before prayed extempore, and I don't know
that he has since. My people came to believe, as they still do, that
the prayer was inspired. It certainly was a remarkable one.
C. R. G.'s own account of the incident described by Mr. M.
is as follows:
June 20th, 1905.
I certify that on Sunday evening the 18th of December, 1904, I
did see a vision of an angel by the font of Garth Church, which
was sheltering a small candle which seemed to be standing out of
nothing, coming up out of the water in the font. There was a draught
coming in from the door, but the angel with his wings stopped the
candle from douting. It was at the time Mr. M. was speaking
of Christ. I did not believe in Christ before that He was our God
and my Saviour. I had always denied Him, but never again, for I
believed then, and I was baptised in the river Cerdin on Christmas
day.

In regard to the last incident described by Mr. M., Mr. B.
writes:
MAESTEG, 5th July, 1905.
In reply to your inquiry, I beg to state that my father died on
Monday, December 19, 1904, about 11.30 a.m. The enclosed wire
will sufficiently prove this, I think. He was apparently in perfect
health up to within about two hours of his death. He was certainly
quite well when I had last heard from home ; as also he was on
the Sunday evening which I am about to mention. On Sunday
evening, December 18, I attended a revival service at St. Mary's
Church, Garth. It was a wonderful service, and the Holy Spirit
was present. Towards the close of the service, about 9 o'clock, or
ft little after, I felt an irresistible impulse to pray for my father,
which I did. I distinctly saw his face, and heard him asking me to
pray for him. I had never engaged in public prayer in my life
before, and I regret to say I have not felt strong enough in my
spirit to do so since. But I found no difficulty in praying that
evening.
I was told at home after my father's death that a very strange
thing had happened there on the Sunday evening in question. The
children at home usually said their prayers in the bed-room, but
at my father's request that evening they said their prayers down
stairs in the drawing-room. Father and mother knelt with them
and listened to their prayers. When the children had finished my
father still knelt, and kept on kneeling for a long time, till my
mother thought there was something the matter with him, so she
went on and touched him on the shoulder. He said, "I am all
right, I was only thinking of the boy"—meaning myself. It is extra
ordinary to think that at that very time, as near as we can judge,
I was also praying for him in church.
There is no mistake about it, I distinctly saw my father in the
service. He knelt alongside of me and looked at me with a pitiful
face and said, " My dear boy, pray for me." This is the sincere
truth. I had never taken religion very seriously before, but I do
now. If you want to know more, will you be so good as to ask
the Rev. Mr. M.
The telegram enclosed in Mr. B.'s letter is dated December
19th, 1904, handed in at 11.10 a.m., received at 11.26 a.m.,
and says, " Come home immediately ; dad dying."
In reply to my inquiries, the Registrar of the district

From Mr. W. H. D., of T :
June 21s/, 1905.
I have always taken great interest in reading, and always the best
books I could get hold of. I was a member of Church,
T (Independent or Congregational Church), for years, also a
Sunday School teacher, also a member of their string band. But I
left the church 4^ years ago, because I could not agree with them
in certain dogmas. Then I took more to reading than ever. I have
read all the R.P.A. reprints as published, and I thought they were
good, because they satisfied my spirit more than anything else I
knew of. The Idea of God and the Spirit World were put aside,
and read as much as I could on the subject of Psychic Phenomena.
1 read the lessons of the American school of science, and a course
from the Psychic Research Society and the New Thought. I read
Prof. VV. James and Stout's books on Psychology ; also books on
Ethics by Mackenzie and Newman Smith. I read books on Free-
thought, Ingersoll, "Saladin," Foote, and Cohen, and some of J. S.
Mil1's books, also Paine, etc. I also attended lectures on Free-
thought. It all led me to Agnosticism and Abstractive Idealism.
I may here tell you that I kept myself from all immoral actions. I
always tried to think the best and live the noblest. I and a few
friends started an Ethical Society, and, being the secretary, took
great interest in it, and spent a year splendid together. Then the
Revival started here at T , so we discontinued the meetings
of the Ethical Society ; but I suggested to my friends that we should
continue with our meetings, and if any good was to become of this
Revival that we should take the advantage of it. But they refused,
so I attended two revival meetings with much interest, and was
astonished at the conversions of some of the most reckless men
and women I knew of. Questions arose several times to my mind,
such as, How was it to be accounted that moral consciousness were
centrified into the conscience of these people 1 Although I knew
through reading Professor W. James's book, Varieties of Religion*
Experience, that the centrif'ying of moral ideas produced great fits
of hysteria, etc. ; but I was surprised upon seeing and hearing the
testimonies of many dozens of people. Some young men of noble
t.t.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 127
character experienced great joy, because they could see that their
prayers were answered. They prayed that God should save some
particular friend or person, and these friends were coming from public-
houses, and giving themselves up to Christ and His service, bursting
into tears for their sins. I knew of some coming miles away in
answer to prayers on their behalf. I knew about Thought-transference,
and have seen it effective several times ; but I could not make out
why these men and women whom I have seen were morally changed
instantaneous, and they live better now than ever.
I attributed many of the conversions to be effected through the
psychology of emotions, imitative instinct, imaginations, etc. ; also
through ideational and conceptual process. In some of the meetings
many showed great agony in their bodies, which was unexplainable
to me. There were dozens praying the same time at some meetings,
and four to six several times I witnessed praying. Several of these
were tried to "hush up," but it was of no use at all, because many
of them lost all consciousness.
In all meetings which I attended up to the end of February I
was quite positive to all these various influences, because I practised
"auto-suggestion," and I knew it to keep me without being affected
at all.
I noticed that in many of the meetings I attended there was great
lack of enthusiasm, sometimes very quiet ; others noticed it. Among
them the Rev. J. G. J. was one who expressed this belief on the
20th of November, 1904. I was in this meeting from 7.30 to
10 o'clock, when he made this statement: "I don't know what
is the reason that this meeting and others I have noticed are so
hard. The Spirit of God does not seem to work here to-night yet,
but I know that after the sceptics and lookers-cm have gone home it
is then that the spirit works among us." So, I said to myself, I shall
see if this is correct to-night and what it is like. I went home
and had supper. Then I went back again to the lobby or porch
of the chapel, and I determined that I should not go in to disturb
anything. I opened the door quietly and peeped in. I never
witnessed such a scene or sensation. The great fervour or enthusiasm,
the agony, the joy, men and women jumping in their seats, some
praying, thanking God for answering their prayers; others praying
unto God that they should experience this mighty power in their
souls, others testifying that they had received the Holy Spirit, and
one person said, "Don't try to understand this, but throw yourself
into it. It surpasseth all understanding." But I said to myself, I
128 Rpv. A. T. Fryer. [PART
want to understand something about it first, then I will believe in
it. About 12.30 this night a schoolmaster, a splendid character and
scholar, rose up and proclaimed that he had felt something that
night which he never experienced before in his life. On seeing this,
a friend of mine, T. W., who was sitting with his wife and
another friend on the gallery, said he did not believe much in the
Revival. He wanted to know something about it, so he thought
he would go and ask a few questions to this schoolmaster, what he had
to say about it. He caught in his hat and began walking down the
staircase, when he was instantaneously knocked (as it were) unconscious.
He ran down the stair, and he then jumped five of the steps to the
floor (you will remember that I was in the porch all this time), so
I was the first that he saw. He looked like a madman, with his
eyes penetrating through me as it were. He ran to me and caught
hold in my hand, and shouted out, " Here is reality to-night. Here
is reality to-night. There is no philosophy in the universe that will
explain this, and I am going in here to say what I have felt here
to-night, and I want you to be saved, my friend." Then he ran
into the chapel, and on by the pulpit. He jumped on top of a
seat, and he threw his hat with all his might up towards the ceiling
of the church, and with a loud voice he declared that his whole
life had been full of hypocrisy and fraud, and shouted for God
and men to forgive him. Then he came out again and told me that
I ought to get his experience, and that I should pray for it. It
could not be explained. It is above all understanding, he said. He
remained partly unconscious for a fortnight. The house and every
where seemed brighter, and he saw a vision of a place beautifully
white, and a voice came to him that God would be his »refuge and
strength. There is a great difference in him now ; he is more
peaceful than ever and joyous and enthusiastic, and ready to do
service to all.
He was moved by the Spirit twice after this fortnight to uncon
sciousness. How he escaped from injury while jumping and passing
across seats was marvellous. He prayed on these occasions with
such earnestness and zeal as I never heard before ; and he received
such physical strength that he thought he could move away a
tremendous weight.
I have asked him several times if he desired anything of the kind
of experience he had had, and he said, "No, never. I could not
think of it ; but I am much happier now."
On this great night, however, I was quite cool and unmoved. A
Li.] Psychological" Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 129
few 3'oung men wanted me to believe in Christ, but I could not.
I could not see any actual value in this belief, because I believed
in Abstractive Idealism, and I thought a better conception of truth
could not be got. The Spiritual world was not a reality to me, and
an answer to prayer I knew nothing of it. I knew of the effect
of auto-suggestion upon myself, and I knew what effect a good and
healthy suggestion had on others. I wanted an evidence to prove
that the Spiritual world was a reality. They insisted that I should
believe in Christ first, then I should do what he told us to do (that
is, to pray unto God through Him, and I should find out for myself
the result). After a few months' time I decided that I should
obtain this experience if it was possible. So, on the 25th of Feb.,
I determined that I would take Christ my ideal in life. I went to
the meeting on that night. It was overcrowded. I never was in such
a meeting. The prayers in this congregation had an inspiring effect
upon me, which caused a thrill through my body, causing great
pain. I cried bitterly ; why, I don't know.
At the end of the meeting, about 11 o'clock, I went home. I
could not sleep all night. Sunday I felt great pain, and Monday as
well, and I lost all appetite for food. Monday night I went along
to a meeting about seven miles away with some friends. I addressed
the meeting and appealed unto those present to accept Christ as
a moral ideal; and, about 11.30 p.m., a person came into the chapel
with some effect of intoxicants upon him. He came to my side and
knelt down, and said a few words very effectively. "I have come
here to-night," he said. " I cannot tell you why I was forced to
come. I went out to-day for a walk, and have been drinking all
through the afternoon, and to-night I went home about 7.30 p.m.
There was nobody there waiting me, so I undressed and went to
bed, but I could not sleep at all. I used to sleep when I got drunk,
but I had to dress again and come out here" (his wife was in the
meeting praying that he should come there), and he said that he
was going to be a Christian. I was glad to see him. After coming
home I felt very painful. Tuesday and in the evening I went to
a prayer meeting. I did enjoy myself, but there was great agony
through my body. Why, I know not. But it remained through
the week, up to Saturday, March 4th, 1905. I went to this prayer
meeting, and I prayed unto God to forgive my sins and reveal unto
me Himself. I don't remember the prayer. I lost all my conscious
ness that night. Some friends had put me to sit down on a seat
(I suppose). It is there that I regained consciousness, and as I
130 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
realised where I was I felt that I perspired very much, so that I
thought that water had been thrown over me. When I felt this
I said to myself, What's the reason that I have been sweating here
to-night ? Is it that my emotion has been intensified more than
ever before 1 If that is the fact, I will deny it all again. I must
have something more real than this. I want to know the fact if the
spiritual world is a reality or not.
And while I was in this attitude of mind (it came to my mind thai
I prayed unto God to reveal something to me and to my friends, and I
remembered that I named two of them in my prayer) a voice told me
that A. B., one of those whom you are praying for, is in the
meeting to-night by the door. And I said, "No, he is not here.
He is in the Workmen's Club or Bute Arms. It is there that I
should look for him whatever." Then the voice told me the second
time exactly the same words, and I answered him back, saying,
" I shall see now if this is true."
I stood up and I saw his brother a few seats before me. I went
on and asked him if his brother was in the meeting, and he said,
"Yes; he has been in the meeting to-night sitting by the door,
and has just gone out now."
I was astonished when I found it true. Had the voice only told
me once, I would have believed that my desire had formed the
thought, but when I heard the voice the second time, I was surprised ;
but thanks be unto Him for revealing Himself.
I am happier than ever, and will for ever remember that my body
lost all its pain on that Saturday night. How and why I cannot
explain, but it is true.

From Mrs. J. M. The first account of this was sent to
me by the vicar of the parish, the Rev. H. P. J., who is
personally known to me. He writes :
February 2nd, 1905.
This afternoon 1 went up to P. expressly to see Mrs. M. regard
ing her vision. Her husband, Mr. J. M., is a collier, and is acting
Church Army Captain, and a very good man he is. ... This is
what she told me, "I was unwilling for him to be out all the while
in the services, and tried to stop him going. On Tuesday morning
I told him at breakfast, if he was going to spend all his time in
church that day I would make it very uncomfortable for him." She
began to wash, and was determined to keep the washing about all day.
LI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 131
She took dimier without him and made no effort to keep anything
warm for him. He was very late when he came, and took a little
food and went again to the afternoon meeting at the parish room.
She went on with the washing, but about 3.30 everything around
her seemed to go dark, and then she heard some sound first of all,
like the buzzing of bees. Then it became quite light again, and all
of a sudden her four little children, who had been buried, came down
and appeared before her, exactly as they were on earth, except that
they were all in white, and simultaneously with this she heard a
crowd singing "O Paradise," etc., and she was forced gently but
irresistibly out of the room into the back-yard from which she
could see church, and at that moment there were a dozen men
wending their way up the hill to the church, and she exclaimed,
"Why should 1 object to Jim going to the meetings when others
are going ' " and she fell down and prayed. She saw the children
again and Jesus Christ behind them, and the children said, "Crown
Him, Mam," and they disappeared. She finished the washing,
cleaned up the place, and was dressed up ready for the evening
service, with tea ready when he came home at 5.30, and she told
him all. Since then she has been quite a different woman and is
present in all the services.
That is exactly what she told me. I have not seen her husband
since your letter came. I may explain that on December 26th,
27th and 28th, the three holidays, our people, especially our young
people, had prayer meetings at morning, afternoon and
evening each day, and all testified they never enjoyed happier
Christmastide.
I then sent Mrs. M. a series of questions to the following
effect:
(1) Had she ever had a similar vision ':'
(2) What were the dates of the children's deaths 1
(3) Did they appear as in life, or did they seem to have grown
since death?
(4) At the second vision, were the figures seen indoors or in
the yard?
(5) Were the hymns heard in Welsh or English ? Which language
does Mrs. M. use?
(6) Did the children speak all together or one only :
(7I Did they speak in Welsh or English?
(8I To whom did Mrs. M. first relate the story, and when ?
132 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PAKT
(9) Will she write and sign her own account of what she saw 1
(10) What was Christ like in the vision 1
To these questions Mrs. M. replied as follows :
(1) None whatever.
(2) The first died July 26th, 1897, aged 11 months. The second
died February 8th, 1899, aged 7 months. The third (twin of the
second) died March 14th, 1900, aged 1 year and 8 months, and the
fourth died February 28th, 1901, aged 7 months.
(3) The children were not grown, but exactly the same as in life.
All in white.
(4) I did not see a second vision. After the children disappeared,
it seemed as if the room was full of people and singing " O Paradise."
It was all indoors.
(5) The hymns were heard in English. We speak English.
(6) One spoke and that was the eldest.
(7) She spoke in English and the tone of voice was as natural as
in life.
(8) I first related my story to my husband in bed at 12 o'clock p.m.
(9) On December 27th, as on the 26th, there were three meetings
each day held by the Church Army. My husbaud being lieutenant
for four years was carrying on the meetings, and as there were
many fresh converts he was trying to keep them out of temptations
during the holidays. I felt my husband was doing too much work
or, as the saying is, pushing his nose too much in the clergy's
work, and I wanted him to stay at home and help me in the house,
but he would not, and I told him that if he had pleasure in church
that he should have none at home. So I went to wash, but it was
very slow, I could not get on as usual. But about half-past three
I began to feel very queer, the room went all dark and it seemed
as if the room was full, or like a swarm of bees around me. I went
out to the back yard and I saw about a dozen men going into
church, so I said to myself, " Why should I be against my husband
doing good when others are going to do good'!" and turning into
the house again the kitchen was beautiful and light as if the sun
was shining there. I went back to the wash tub and there before
me appeared the four children, and one of them spoke in English
to me saying, "Mam, come," and then they disappeared. I could
hear the singing of the hymn "O Paradise" until it died away in
the distance.

The following are questions I sent to Mr. M. with his
answers appended :
(1) Was Mr. M. praying for his wife when in church?
(2) What was going on in church just at the moment when the
vision - occurred '.
(3) Is it probable that people were singing the hymns heard, at
the time they were heard ?
(4) Had Mr. M. alluded to the departed children (in conversation
with his wife) on the day of the vision, or the day before ?
Were they in his mind that day 1
(5) Will Mr. M. give his own written statement of what his
wife told him on his return from afternoon service?
(6) It is important to know what Mr. M. was thinking about
at the time of the visions.
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
(1) Yes.
(2) I was in church half-an-hour before anybody came, and I
prayed while walking around the church for my wife, but not a
thought of the children came into my mind, as far as I am aware.
I was tilled with the Spirit of God.
(3) No, there was no singing at all about that time.
(4) Not any whatever.
(5) She wanted to know what was the matter with me, as I
was looking sad and confused. Well, the fact is this, I saw such
.- wonderful change that I was there giving thanks to the Almighty
God for answering my prayer; and she (my wife) said it will be
better from now on, and that she was going to church with me
that night, and burst into crying. And I had faith that God had
spoken to her, or revealed Himself.
(6) That God would give my wife a desire to go to the Church
Army meetings, being that I was the acting lieutenant of the corps,
&nd have been for four years.

Our people still continue to see the strange lights. Two women
were going home the other evening ; one saw the light, the other
did not. Another man heard some one praying quite plain in the
field, although there was no one in the field but himself.
134 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
The following short account of the lights and sounds
heard by some of the parishioners of certain parishes in Mont
gomeryshire was sent later by Mr. J. B. J., enclosed in a letter
dated March 7th, 1905.
W. H. saw a flash of light lighting the road before him when
he and another friend were coming from a farmhouse on Satur
day, 18th February, 1905, about 10 p.m. He saw similar light
on Saturday evening, the 4th February, but not in the same place.
The light only lasted a second or two.
D. D., J. J., and R. J., during the service at the Parish Church,
heard bells chiming on 29th January. The sound was over their
heads. There were many by them, but they were the only ones,
that heard it.
E. B., on Wednesday previous, heard about four o'clock what
appeared to him to be a thunder clap, followed by lovely singing in
the air.
Mrs. R., on Saturday evening, the 14th January, saw a ball of
fire descending on the hill in front of her house, and, after rolling
some distance, disappeared.
E. E., on Saturday evening, between seven and eight, while
returning home from his work, heard some strange music, similar
to the vibration caused by telegraph wires, only much louder,
on an eminence, the hill being far from any trees and wires of any
kind, and it was more or less a still evening.
J. P. heard some lovely singing on the road, about half a
mile from his home, on Saturday evening, three weeks ago, which
frightened him very much.

From the Rev. J. N. E., Vicar of .
May 30th, 1905.
... I observed much latent earnestness and deep religious feelings
pervading a goodly number of the parishioners about October, 1904.
It manifested itself in greater earnestness at the services of the
church, and particularly in greater attendance and interest at a
Bible class which I had just started. This feeling, which could be
manifestly felt, I also shared ; it did not appear to me to be com
municated by means of any outside agency.
It is important to note that this latent feeling (or whatever it
may be called) was in existence before any publicity was given to

the Revival in the public press, and before I even heard of its exist
ence elsewhere.
Shortly afterwards, about the beginning of November, I heard
that the subdued spirit to which I have referred had actually broken
out into prayer aiid praise in a small Methodist chapel in the parish.
Believing that the root cause was similar to that which I myself
experienced, I spoke to some of the most prominent connected with
it, and made arrangements that the whole parish should unite in
the matter. The suggestion was gladly embraced, and the whole
of the parishioners practically assembled in the parish church, when
a most remarkable service was held, characterised by the deepest
earnestness . and a reality which could be felt.
That went on for months, and is being still continued ; but on
that aspect it is not my purpose to dwell at present. I will en
deavour to give some instances such as you require.
(1) A remarkable ease and fluency in prayer and public dis
courses, which was common to all. I felt this myself to a remarkable
degree. Whereas previously I often felt it a burden to speak, my
mind seemed to expand, and a new vista of truths would unfold
itself, and I could give expression to my thoughts with the greatest
ease, and also pleasure. Also, the receptiveness of the hearers was
such as I never before experienced. I have addressed these meet
ings on an average two or three times a week for the last six
months.
(2) Some almost illiterate persons have broken out in prayer in
such a way as to cause great surprise. I can mention two in par
ticular. One, a young girl, 18 years of age. She can scarcely read,
and has never had any opportunity for culture—brought up amidst
squalid surroundings, her father being a very careless and indifferent
man ; her mother died when she was a child.
This young girl gives expression to the most refined and literary
sentiments, couched in admirable phraseology. Her form of language
is partly Biblical and partly the natural mode of conversation. She
refers constantly to her mother, though she has been dead about 15-
years. I have been much struck by the girl's changed appearance
during these months. My wife has also marked it.1 The father is
now a changed man, and attends every service in church.
The other case is a labouring man about 40, who had never taken

baa now quite a refined appearance. As one expressed it to me, " She has a.
Madonna-like fuce." This feature is, I think, remarkable.

part publicly before this time. He also is extraordinarily eloquent
and choice in diction. The form of his language is largely drawn
from hymnology.
(3) A few days before Christmas, 1904, I was riding to see some
parishioners in parish. They lived about three miles up the
hillside. As I was gradually ascending I fancied I heard voices
singing. I took little notice for the moment, believing it was pure
fancy. Gradually the voices seemed to increase in volume, until at
last they became quite overpowering. I was trying to imagine it
could be nothing outside myself, as it were, but the wonderful
harmony seemed to be borne on me entirely from the outside, and
was as real to my senses as anything I have ever heard.
I could distinguish the words distinctly. They were :
" Pwy all beidio cofio am dano,
Pwy all beidio canu ei glod,
Dyma gariad na'd a'n angho,
Tra bydd uefoedd wen yn bod."
The moment the refrain would come to an end it would be re
started, the volume becoming greater and greater. To me it was
an exquisite sensation. When about arriving at my destination the
voices suddenly ceased. I have had no trace of the recurrence of
such a thing, and never had such an experience previously. I am
not given to study or dwell upon any such manifestations.
I sent the following questions to Mr. E., and his answers to
them are annexed :
(1) Can you say why the spirit of the Revival reached L and
not other places? There is a marked difference in this respect be
tween different localities. In some, desperate efforts were made,
without effect, to stir up a Revival.
(2) Had there been prayer for a Revival at all amongst your people ?
Have any of them admitted, since it began, that it was what they
had hoped for and prayed for ? Perhaps some of the older people
remembered 1859.
(3) Is it possible to get some account of the beginnings, in November,
1904, of the Revival Spirit in the Methodist Chapel in your parish f
Did it begin there in the same spontaneous fashion as in church 1
Had none of the Methodists then heard of Roberts or of the Spirit
in your church ? As you spoke to some of the prominent
Methodists about this in November, no doubt you can recollect
what they said on this point.
(4) Has the "ease and fluency" remained up to the present time? I
LI.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 137
ask this because temporary excitement might have induced the
universal ease.
(5) Were persons affected by fear or love ? This applies to the pos
sibility of fear of hell as a motive to "conversion." The
doctrinal element is of importance. So far as I can trace, fear is
not prominent.
(6) In the case of the girl affected, does her reference to her mother
mean that she is under the impression of being in contact with her now,
or is it simple recollection ? She was three years of age when her
mother died. What sort of a person was the mother? Do you
suspect hereditary influence 1
(7) Has her ordinary conversational language changed, or is the change
confined to prayer and praise ?
(8) Similar questions apply to the man of 40. Does he consider
himself helped by some outside agency ?
(9) Singing. Has any one in the parish heard similar singing ? Can
you give me the translation of the words heard ?
(10) I suppose that it is improbable that the singing came from
any house passed on the way 1
(11) Did the horse you were riding behave as if at all conscious of hear
ing any singing ? This is an important detail.
(12) Have you ever in life heard this particular verse sung as you
heard it during the ride? Was it unconscious memory?
(13) Have you ever seen a canwyll gorph, or "ghost," or had any
remarkably fulfilled dream?
(14) Have you any recollection of any ancestor or other relative who
saw or heard anything abnormal ?
(15) Has any parishioner seen a light, or a vision, or heard
voices !
Answers to Questions re Revival.
(1) The difference between different localities has also greatly
struck me, and I have wondered much at the cause. The only
explanation that I can offer as regards L is, that this
neighbourhood has for many years been blessed with a good pro
portion of earnest and religiously-minded men and women. So that
when a spirit of Revival was begotten the conditions were favour
able for its nurture and development.
(In a neighbouring parish, e.g., every effort was made to secure
a revival, without effect.)
From observation and experience, I am convinced that given
favourable conditions in any parish, i.e., a few devout people, also
138 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
one or two who are in true sympathy with a religious revival,
who can understand it on its mental and spiritual sides, and are
able to communicate their spirit to others—the movement would
overcome every obstacle, and the bulk of the population would be
affected by it.
(2) No, not in a definite sense. One man testified recently that
he had felt for some years that there was something lacking in the
Christian church. He could not say or feel what it was, but that
he daily prayed fiod to supply it, whatever it was. This man is
one of the best churchmen in the parish ; he is thoroughly sound
and sane, and above the average in intelligence. When this move
ment was felt, he was convinced that his prayers were answered.
I know of no similar case here.
Some of the people remember slightly the 1859 Revival, but
strange to say, that did not affect this neighbourhood at all, as
far as I can learn, and I have made careful inquiries.
(3) In the Methodist Chapel it broke out through the instru
mentality of one young man, one of the best I have ever known.
He had been at a service with Roberts (before the latter broke
out). What I could gather from the Methodists was that this
young man was the means of touching the hearts of those present.
(I shall try and get him to communicate with you.)
(4) Yes. One of the best and most impressive meetings we
have had was last Monday evening.
(5) Love decidedly. (The doctrines chiefly involved are the whole
cycle of the Redeemer's life's work, culminating in the atonement.
Also the bearing of the whole upon practical life and duty.)
(6) My impression is that she seems to feel her mother's unseen
influence, certainly seeing and perhaps helping her in her difficulties.
The mother was, I learn, a pious woman ; the girl cannot have
the faintest recollection of her.
I cannot say about hereditary influence—(there is none on the
father's side).
(7) No.
(8) No. He is moved by an inward influence.
(9) No.
"Who cannot but bear Him in remembrance,
Who cannot but sing His praise ;
Love such as His will not be forgotten,
As long as holy heaven exists."
It did not proceed from any house. This is certain.

From Mr. S. M. J., of T . The original narrative is
in Welsh. I give a translation of it here.
May 26/A, 1905.
... [I was] brought up in a religious family and with religion in
the parish church, where my father was parish clerk and church
warden the greater part of his life. I was confirmed between 14
and 15 years of age, and from that time forward I have been accus
tomed to speak and to perform every public duty, and to rejoice
in every religious service.
In the month of November missioners in connection with the
Revival came to the neighbourhood, and I went to the meetings,
and by seeing and hearing the effects on other people, I understood
that Jesus of Nazareth was walking through our country, but I
was unable to feel Him nor see Him to myself, and that was my
anxiety for many days, lest Jesus of Nazareth should pass by, and
I without receiving a renewing view of Him. But on the 12th
December, on a Monday night, I had this heavenly vision which
the tongue of man cannot relate or describe appropriately, nor the
unspeakable blessings which I received to myself, which things I
hid not without declaring them, and I cannot less than give them
to you in writing.
And this is the vision. On the night stated, I was travelling by
myself on the high road on a work night which was very dark,
but in the darkness overhead I beheld a faint light playing over
my bead and approaching the earth, and as it came nearer it increased
and strengthened ; and lest I was being deceived by my own ej'es,
I determined to close them, but 1 was seeing it (the light) in the
same way. Then I opened my eyes to behold the vision, and then
it came downwards and stood before me, about the size of a man's
body, and in the bright and glorious light I beheld there the face
of a man, and by looking for the body in the light a shining white
robe was covering it to its feet and it was not touching the earth,
140 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
and behind its arms there were wings appearing, and I was seeing
every feather in the wings, but they were not natural or material
feathers, but the whole was heavenly beyond description. And then
the palms of the hands were appearing, and on each hand there
were brown spots as they appeared at first. But after I had noticed
more minutely, I beheld that they were the marks of the nails, and
then I recognised Him as Jesus, and I went forward shouting, "O
my blessed Jesus" and then He ascended on His wing without
noise, moving a little further ahead, and appearing much more
bright and clear, so that the marks of the nails were so fiery and
so plain that I can say that they were square nails of the cruellest
description, and by the work of Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus
pulling Him down from the cross, the sores of His dear flesh had
come out to the palms of His hands ; and this appearance gave such
peace to my breast, so that it filled it through with love, so that
from that time forth I love every man without difference.
And in the light of this presence the old ugly world came before
me in its entirety, so that I saw its mountains, its rocks, its moors,
its rushes, its thorns, its entangled growths, its stones, and all
hindrances on my way, so that I was retreating (moving away or
aside), lest its stones should throw me over, lest its thorns and
its entangled growths should rend me. Which journey I would
think every true Christian must go through. And after He had
led me through this journey in that way, and I beseeching Him
to come with me, and when He had stayed the third time, behold
Ho ascended up and out of my sight. And then I besought His
forgiveness if poor and unworthy dust had asked too much to the
Great and Holy Being.
In answer to my questions Mr. J. wrote :
... I had neither been night-watching nor had had a dream before
I saw the vision.
None of the family experienced the same thing.
The appearance of the world I saw by means of the light was one
vision—not a light showing the earth around, because I am well
acquainted with the place—but the surface of the whole world losing
itself in the distance.
There are neither bogs nor rushes nor rocky mountains in that
district, but good and fruitful land. There are no small stones on
the main road along which I travelled. But I was not aware of
ise things as I was in the vision, not knowing for how long. It

was a vision of the world in its intricacies and difficulties, as well
as of Christ; but only one vision, the light of Jesus, showed me
the world and led me through, and not any other light showing me
the ground around, because I did not see any way under my feet
except the place described.
Not a word was uttered by Jesus, but the movements went on
silently and noiselessly.

From Mr. C. J. P., of A , Glamorganshire.
June 2nd, 1905.
The circumstances leading up to the Revival in P-
are not quickly or easily described, because there has been a leading
up for years, but the immediately preceding circumstances are these.
Hearing of what went on in other places, a week's prayer was
decided. At the close of the week a distinct change was noticeable
in the manner of the meeting. All seemed to be labouring under
a suppressed excitement. On the Saturday the minister saw Evan
Roberts, and casually remarked that he did not "feel" anything.
The reply he received was that the essential was faith, and not
feeling. The minister returned home with this message; and in the
evening, when going home from the service with my brother and
another young man, suggested an open-air meeting. Instantly they
began singing, and were joined by many others. This was about
9 o'clock. The meeting went on until about 3.30 Sunday morning.
I made an effort about 10.15 to go home. With difficulty I got
away, but felt an overpowering impulse to join the group. How
ever, I made my way along the road, and commenced climbing the
hill to my home. This necessitated a slowing down, as it were,
and when about halfway up the hill I stopped. Along the road I
heard an inward voice saying, " Go back, go back ! " whilst I felt
quite uneasy. However, I returned to the group, and remained to
the end of the meeting. The following day (Sunday) the words of
the preacher and others seemed to have a terrible force, and at
night I felt bound to do something. I rose from my seat and
spoke a few words, saying that I felt that I had not been what I
should have been. After this I often had the desire to speak or
sing or pray. I realised that there was a great power on my side,
and that I must obey that power. With regard to prayer, the
general trend was in the language of the Bible and hymns, quotations
being much used.
142 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
As regards my previous manner of life, and also that of my
parents and grandparents on both sides, it is no exaggeration to
say it has been decidedly religious. I can give one good instance
of a vision, as I suppose it would be termed. Some weeks after
my first experience I felt impelled to do a certain difficult thing.
What that is, I think, is immaterial. However, I did not do it,
and whenever I wished to pray, the thought of not having done
this one thing came to my mind ; and on one occasion I saw in
my mind's eye a large white throne, with no one sitting there, as
far as I could see. Across the front of this throne was the word
" Disobedience," in large black letters. I saw this every time I
attempted to pray, until I had done what I felt I must do. For
the past few years I have at various times felt that I should go
abroad as a missionary, but had not been able to give in to the
•desire. I have now been able to overcome the restraining influences
of home and friends. I cannot say that I have ever had previous
experiences of this sort. . . .

GLAMORGAN COUNTY ASYLUM, BRIDGEND, 23rrf June, 1905.
In my Annual Report for 1904 I stated that: " So far as figures
can show, the increase [of insanity] cannot be attributed to any
material extent to the religious revival which was such a prominent
feature of the last quarter of the year, for in only one per cent.
of the admissions was religious excitement deemed to be a con
tributory factor in the causation."
Since this was written I have seen no reason to depart from the
view expressed, and I trust that the extract will suffice for your

The following accounts of previous appearances of lights
at various places along the coast of Tremadoc Bay are taken

kindly furnished to me by the editor :

following letter, in response to the request which we made last
week for further information :
"Yoke House, Pwllheli, 2nd March, 1875.—The curious lights
appeared again on Sunday night. We saw twelve at the same time ;
two were very bright, the one of a red, the other of a blue colour.
They were inland, the same as before, but from what we could
observe they did not confine themselves to marshy ground, although
at first they seemed to rise from the ground where we knew there
were swamps. It was a very dark and foggy night, and my brother,
my son Percy, my keeper and I went out about a mile to see if
we could get near them. When we had gone about half a mile we
observed four or five behind us. We went to the farm adjoining,
and called their attention to them. Mrs. Picton-Jones and two
servants watched them for an hour and a half, and had, from their
description, a better view than we had, as we were occasionally in
hollows. On our way home from Bryntani farm we saw a bright
light at Yoke House, which we all thought was a lamp put out
to direct us home, the night being so dark and our course across
country. The other servants by this time, having come home from
church and chapel, were watching the curious antics of the lights.
I should mention that we had a lamp with us, but it was darkened,
except when we came to banks or ditches. Those at Yoke House
saw the same light, and thought it was our lamp, but were all
mistaken, as, when we got within about 200 yards of our pond,
the light turned into a deep blue colour and disappeared. In front
of the other pool there are some sheds, and one light that had
appeared before we started seemed to go in and out, round the
corner, on to the cart horse stable, round its gable end, then on
to the barn, exactly the same as if it were a human being, with
the exception of rising to such a height that even 'Tall Agrippa'
could not come up to it. Their movements and the distance which
they spread were the same as described before. Our house is about
three-quarters of a mile from the Cardigan Bay, and the pro
montory is about seven miles as the crow flies. Last night they
did not appear, but we saw several flashes of lightning.—I am, sir,
your obedient servant, G. T. PICTON-JONES." (Cambrian News).
From "£ye-Gones," March, 1875 (p. 210).

lights seen by him near Pwllheli, I beg to say that I witnessed a
very similar phenomenon on the marshy ground near Borth. Some

five or six Tears ago, owing to an accident on the Cambrian Railway,
I had to post from Machynlleth to the neighbourhood of Towyn,
where I was then residing. It would then be about 12 o'clock
p.m. when I came in sight of the low ground and sandy dunes
between Borth and the Dovey, the night being perfectly clear and
still and the stars shining, when, to my astonishment, I saw four
or five lights moving apparently on the sand hills near the farm
of Ynyslas. I called the post-boy's attention to them, and never
did I see a man so paralysed with fright : I thought he would have
fallen off the box, and the perspiration, as I could see by the
light of the lamps, fairly ran down his face. He evidently con
sidered them of supernatural origin, as he told me an incoherent
story of a boat's crew of shipwrecked foreigners having been murdered
when they came ashore there many years ago (upon further inquiry
I found there was some tradition of the sort). However, there the
lights were, moving about in a sort of aimless way until, as near
as I can remember, we reached within a mile or two of Aberdovey.
They were white, and about the size and brilliancy of the lamps
carried by railway guards and porters. There is yet another
phenomenon of which no satisfactory explanation has ever yet been
given. On the 24th of September, 1854 (I refer to my game book
of that year), a friend was shooting with me in Herefordshire. The
day was perfectly still, the sky cloudless, when sounds like dis
charges of heavy artillery came from the west, which, striking against
a range of wooded hills running north and south under which we
were shooting, made most wonderfully distinct echoes. These dis
charges, or whatever they were, continued for several hours at
regular intervals of about two minutes. Since then similar sounds
have been heard two or three times (judging from the letters to
the papers), and principally by persons living in Cardiganshire, but
their origin has never yet, so far as I can see, been discovered."
From "Bye-Gones," October, 1877 (p. 292).
"Now we have a statement from Towyn that within the last
few weeks ' lights of various colours have frequently been seen
moving over the estuary of the Dysynni river and out at sea. They
are generally in a northern direction, but sometimes they hug the
shore, and move at a very high velocity for miles towards Aber
dovey, and suddenly disappear.' Can any of our readers who are
qualified to observe natural phenomena furnish us with further
information on the subject?"

The following paragraph is taken from the Western Mail of
March 13th, 1905:
" Mysterious lights were seen in Wales before this year of revival.
Here is an old extract: 1694. Apr. 22. ' A fiery exhalation rising
out of the sea opened itself in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad and
many miles in length, burning all straw, hay, thatch, and grass,
but doing no harm to trees, timber, or any solid things, only firing
tarns or thatched houses. It left such a taint on the grasse as to
kill all the cattle that eate of it. I saw the attestations in the
hands of the sufferers. It lasted many months.' From Memoirs
of Evelyn (1819 edition). Also in the Powys-Land Papers for 1883."
Extract from Pennant's Tour in Wales, Vol. II., p. 372,
ed. 1810:
"Winter of 1694.—A pestilential vapour resembling a weak blue
flame arose during a fortnight or three weeks out of a sandy,
marshy tract called Morfa Byden, and crossed over a channel of 8
miles to Harlech. It set fire on that side to 16 ricks of hay and
2 barns, one filled with hay, the other with corn. It infected the
grass in snch a manner that cattle, etc., died, yet men eat of it
with impunity. It was easily dispelled : any great noise, sounding
of horns, discharging of guns, at once repelled it. Moved only by
night, and appeared at times, but less frequently ; after this it
disappeared."1

INVESTIGATION OF REPORTED PHENOMENAL LIGHTS IN
NORTH WALES.
February 21st, 1905.
In accordance with instructions, I proceeded to Barmouth on
Monday, February 13th, arriving there at 6.50 a.m. on Tuesday
the 14th, with the object of investigating a report that mysterious
lights had been seen on the hill sides above Egryn, which is a little
village about four miles from Barmouth. I was accompanied by an
assistant to help with the installation and working of the electrical
apparatus. This apparatus consisted of an electrical collector raised
20 feet above the ground on a pole and supported on an insulator.
Attached to this collector was a phosphor-bronze wire about 300
yards in length and carried on porcelain insulators. This wire con
stituted the positive electric lead, and in the circuit I placed a
1See Gotsiping Guide to Wales, p. 90, for similar account of 1694 lights.

galvanometer and a telephone receiver, which latter is the most
sensitive indicator of abnormal atmospheric electrical conditions. I
also placed a delicate compass between the galvanometer and the
telephone receiver where it would instantly respond to the slightest
electrical influence; the negative poles of these instruments were
well " earthed." On testing this line with a single small dry cell,
all the instruments responded.
I spent the greater part of the day of the 14th in investigating
local reports and in surveying the ground where the lights were
reported to have been seen. I visited the local telephone and
telegraph stations, and inquired if the instruments there had been
interfered with by atmospheric electricity. In no instance was this
the case, although the men in charge told me that in consequence
of the presence of a large sun spot they had received orders to pay
special attention to the working of the instruments. I then inquired
if there was a " Marconi Station " in the neighbourhood, but I
learnt that the nearest one was at Holyhead. It occurred to me
that the lights might have been due to a discharge of what is
known as "globular lightning," but this form of electrical disturb
ance is usually accompanied by an explosion, and much damage is
done in the vicinity. A careful examination of the hillside failed
to show any signs of this.
I erected my apparatus on the hillside on the spot where the
lights were reported to have been seen, and remained by it for
many hours of darkness without observing the slightest deflection
of the instruments or seeing anything abnormal, with the exception
of two brilliant flashes towards the north. These, I afterwards learnt,
were due to an attempt on the part of some newspaper correspon
dents to photograph the chapel by flashlight.
Wednesday, 15th February. On my behalf Mr. Dilnot wired Mr.
Jones of Dyfiryn to ask for the whereabouts of his wife, who was
reported to be the originator of these lights. Mrs. Jones unex
pectedly returned to Dyffryn, so I proceeded there and interviewed
her. This interview was unsatisfactory ; it is obvious to me that
the woman is a religious maniac, and that no reliance can be placed
on her statements, which were vague and indefinite. Another long
night watch resulted in nothing. I certainly saw several lights
which might have appeared to be abnormal to the overwrought
imagination, but when resolved by a powerful prismatic night field-
glass which I had with me turned out to be farm lanterns.
ThursikuI, February \6th, I returned home via Portmadoc, where

Mrs. Jones had been preaching, in order to investigate the local
report*. Here again I failed to obtain one single definite state
ment by an eye-witness.
Conclusion. \ It is just possible that there may have been some
lights caused by spontaneous ignition of phosphuretted hydrogen
generated in the marsh at Egryn and distorted by mist, although
I never saw any. Methane, or marsh gas, is never self-ignited, and
may be* left out of the question. The presence of atmospheric
electricity I think I have disproved.
In view of the fact that Mrs. Jones solemnly stated to me that
Venus, which was particularly brilliant at that period, was a new
star, had only appeared since the Revival, and was situated a short
distance above her house, I think we may dismiss these lights as
phantasies of overwrought brains.

From Mr. J. J., of D , Merionethshire. The original
account, which I received in January, 1905, is in Welsh; I
give here a translation of it :
In reference to the fire concerning which you wrote to me. There
are several here who have seen it in varying forms—sometimes near
Chapel Egryn, sometimes on the roof thereof, and sometimes some
half mile or more from the place.
When I saw it, it [was about half a mile from the chapel and
about a mile from where I stood. That was about 5 o'clock in the
evening. The first form in which it appeared to me was that of a
pillar of clear fire quite perpendicular. It was about 2 feet wide
and about 3 yards in height. Suddenly another small fire began
by its side some 2 yards distant from the first pillar. It rapidly
increased until it assumed the same measurement and form as the
first. Then another small fire suddenly arose on the other side of
the first pillar, and increased rapidly until it assumed the same size
and form as the other two columns. So there were three pillars
of the same size and form. And as I gazed upon them I saw two
arms of fire extending upwards from the top of each of the pillars.
The three pillars and their arms assumed exactly the same shape
and remained so for about a minute or two. As I looked towards
the sky I saw smoke ascending from the pillars, and immediately
they began to disappear. Their disappearance was equally swift
148 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
with their growth. It was a gradual disappearance ; the fire became
small and went out.
I thought they were natural fire, but it was a very wonderful
fire. I never saw fire the same as it in my life—three pillars or
columns of the same measure and of exactly the same shape and
equidistant from each other. I do not propose to offer any kind
of explanation. I leave that to you.

From Mr. L. M., of H .
May 30, 1905.
With regard to the lights which appear in this neighbourhood,
perhaps one instance of my experience will suffice. I have been an
eye-witness of them on more than one occasion. I happened to be
with Mr. Beriah Evans, Carnarvon, on that night, the report of
which has been given to the world by Mr. Evans himself. I can
testify to the truth of the report.
The night which I am going to relate you my experience was
Saturday evening, March 25, 1905, when Mrs. Jones, the evangelist,
of Egryn, was conducting a service in the Calvinistic Methodist
Chapel at Llanfair, a place about a mile and half from Harlech on
the main road between Harlech and Barmouth.
My wife and myself went down that night specially to see if the
light accompanied Mrs. Jones from outside Egryn. We happened
to reach Llanfair about 9.15 p.m. It was a rather dark and damp
evening. In nearing the chapel, which can be seen from a distance,
we saw balls of light, deep red, ascending from one side of the
chapel, the side which is in a field. There was nothing in this
field to cause this phenomenon—i.e. no houses, etc. After that we
walked to and fro on the main road for nearly two hours
without seeing any light except from a distance in the direction of
Llanbedr. This time it appeared brilliant, ascending high into the
sky from amongst the trees where lives the well-known Rev.
C. E. The distance between us and the light which appeared
this time was about a mile. Then about eleven o'clock, when the
service which Mrs. Jones conducted was brought to a close, two
balls of light ascended from the same place and of similar appear
ance to those we saw first. In a few minutes afterwards Mrs.
Jones was passing us home in her carriage, and in a few seconds
after she passed, on the main road, and within a yard of us, there
red a brilliant light twice, tinged with blue. In two or three
LL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 149
seconds after this disappeared, on our right hand, within 150 or
200 yards, there appeared twice very huge balls of similar appear
ance as that which appeared on the road. It was so brilliant and
powerful this time that we were dazed for a second or two. Then
immediately there appeared a brilliant light ascending from the
woods where the Rev. C. E. lives. It appeared twice this time.
On the other side of the main road, close by, there appeared, ascend
ing from a field high into the sky, three balls of light, deep red.
Two of these appeared to split up, whilst the middle one remained
unchanged. Then we left for home, having been watching these
last phenomena for a quarter of an hour.
Perhaps I ought to say that I had an intense desire to see the
light this night for a special purpose ; in fact, I prayed for it, not
as a mere curiosity, but for an higher object, which I need not
mention. Some will ridicule this idea, but I have a great faith in
prayer. . . .
In reply to questions about his experiences, Mr. M. stated
that he had never seen such lights before the Revival, nor
before he had heard of others seeing them. He could not
say how often he had seen them, but he remembered the
dates—January 31st (this was the first time, and at H ),
Feb. 1st, March 25th, and May 26th. They were seen "high
up in the sky, where no houses or anything else could lead
us to make any mistake" (i.e. to mistake ordinary lights for
them) ; they were seen both on very dark nights and also
when the moon and stars were visible. He had never been
affected in any particular way by seeing them, but had only
felt a curiosity to know their cause. Neither he nor Mrs.
M. had had hallucinations on any other occasions.
Mrs. M. writes as follows :
May 29, 1905.
My husband wants me to write of what I have seen at P
and heard when with Mrs. Jones, Egryn, March 15th. After the
evening service we had a little way to walk from the town down
to West-End, where we were staying. We both were invited to
have supper next door to where we were sleeping, so after supper
wf went up to a sitting-room on the third floor. It seems that
they were having the lights at West-End since the Revival broke
out at the commencement of the year above a little chapel of the
Methodists, so they were very curious to see the lights this night,
150 . Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
when Mrs. Jones was with them, so that they would be more
satisfied. We had no lights in the room. There were two windows
to the room : just the room to have proper sight of the light if it
would come. Anyway, in a very little while we saw two balls of
fire moving back and fro, but it was so very far we were not
satisfied with that. We were about twelve to eighteen in the
room. Eight were singing hymns, so as to pass the time in watch
ing and waiting for the lights. In a little while we had a better view,
and, nearer us, several globes of light, some very light colour, and
others deep red. We were enjoying ourselves. I am well used to
seeing that kind of light here.
My husband and I have witnessed the sight many a time here.
When we saw the light ascending high in the air, like a cross, I
felt nervous, but it descended again nearer us—a cross and two
other crosses, one each side of the middle one. The two crosses
came nearer us now and stood not far from us, and dozens of small
balls of fire dancing back and fro behind the crosses, and we heard
a voice singing.
I have heard the singing once after at H , but differently
to that at P , like a well-trained choir, and saw the cross the
same time on the sky. The two Misses G., , are witnesses
of the cross in the sky and the singing.
In regard to this last account, I sent Mrs. M. the follow
ing questions, to each of which her answers are appended :
(1) Was Mrs. Jones of Egryn one of the company that saw the
lights on March 15 at P 1 Was she sitting with you in the
same room ?—Yes.
(2) Have you ever seen any such lights before the Revival began 1
—No, never.
(3) Could you distinguish the tune or the words when the voices
were heard singing ? Was the tune familiar to you ?—No.
(4) Is it possible to tell me how often during the Revival you
have seen lights?—I have seen them so often that I can't say the
number. The dates when they were seen?—The first week in
January was the first time. How often and when was the singing
heard ?— Twice.
(5) Will Miss G. send her account of the lights ?—She wants me
to say that she heard the singing with me.
In sending these answers Mrs. M. wrote that her friends
were unwilling to give their names for fear of its doing harm
LL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 151
to Mrs. Jones ; they had seen lights since the beginning of
the Revival, but had never before had such a vision as on
the night described. Miss G. (who could not easily write
English) had asked her to write that they saw the light and
heard the singing. She continues :
The last time we have seen the lights was 26th of May. I was
going to bed. Saw two red lights outside the window after draw
ing the blind and lighting the candle. In about an hour my husband
and self saw it in the room, brilliant. Haven't seen it since.
In a letter sent to me by Mrs. M., apparently referring to
the evening of March 15th, one of the witnesses says: "We
never saw, though we have looked several times, such a light
before or after that night."
(20)
From Dr. E. J. M., of Tylorstown.
June \8th, 1905.
About 10 p.m. on Saturday night I was coming home with Mrs.
M. when she drew my attention to a bright light which could
be seen over Libanus (C.M.) Chapel, towards the side of the moun
tain. It appeared as a ball of fire about the size of a cheese plate ;
it was perfectly fixed.
As soon as I saw it I marked its position, in order to be sure
that it could not be due to some one with a light on the road
which passes over the mountain, but its position was far enough
away from the road.
I then looked towards Stanley Town—which is on the same side
of the mountain in another direction, and which is nearer to the
place I was standing—in order to compare the lights from the gas
lamps on the road. There was no comparison between the lights,
as the gas lamps were not nearly so brilliant as this light, and the
light I saw was of a more reddish colour.
It remained fixed in the same position for about three minutes,
and then disappeared instantaneously. Mrs. Jones was in the chapel
at the time holding a meeting. I may say that I was not thinking
of the light at the time.
In conversation with Dr. M. on June 21st, 1905, he told
me that afterwards he spoke to Mrs. Jones about the light,
and she declared that she had seen it inside the chapel. On
152 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [PART
morn
. «
June 27th he wrote to me that he had not had any con
versation with her about the lights before he saw the light,
which was on May 27th ; also, in answer to a question of
mine on the subject, that he belonged to North Wales, having
been born in Carnarvonshire.
A photograph of the place where this incident occurred is
reproduced above (see Plate I.).
(21)
From the Rev. E. W. E.
June 26, 1905.
Mrs. Jones of Egryn's last meeting at , being rather late
on Wednesday, May 24th, it was therefore after midnight that
Mrs. E. and myself retired upstairs to rest. After putting out the
light in our bedroom I could not go to bed. Then looked out of the
window, but could see nothing. Then I went to the back bed
room, where our two boys sleep ; and whilst I was looking out of
this window towards the Penrhys hill, my wife came behind and
put her hand on my shoulder, then asked me if I were looking for
something. I said yes, that I was looking for something strange,
because I felt very strange. Mrs. E. had just pushed the curtain
on one side when she exclaimed, " There's something ! " I said,
*' Where?" When she told me the direction I then exclaimed,
"Yes, really, there is the strange light." It appeared to us in
the form of a column of fire about two feet wide and several
feet high, quite distinct, and of the tint of a fiery vapour.
After looking at the column for a second or two, then some bright
balls of fire appeared in the column near its base, then these
brilliant balls would burst and disappear upwards. Then the column
would disappear, but in a moment would appear again in the same
form, in the very same spot, and then the balls would appear in
the column, and the balls burst and disappear upwards in the same
way. This we distinctly saw six times (6 times).
It was, as nearly as we could judge, about 12.45 on Thursday
morn, May 25, and lasted in all about three minutes.
I saw Mr. E. on June 21, 1905, and he pointed out to
the exact spot on the hillside where the light appeared
The spot in this case is on the western side of the
(lt was on the eastern in Dr. M.'s case) ; no houses
ULJ Psychological As-pects of the Welsh Revival. 153
near. There is a path by a wall, and it was at a slight break
on the top line of the wall that the light appeared to be.
I afterwards sent a series of questions to Mr. E., which I
print here with his answers, dated June 28th, 1905:
(1) Have you ever seen a corpse-light?—No.
(2) Is your birth-place in South or North Wales ?—Dowlais, Glam.
Also, my father and my mother were born at Dowlais.
(3) Have you seen much of Mrs. Jones before or during her
visit ?—Never before her coming here, and only at our meetings,
until the Saturday after I saw the strange light. Then I had, with
a few others, about two hours' semi-private conversation with Mrs.
Jones.
(4) Did you hope or expect to see any lights?—No. Neither
Mrs. E. nor myself had any desire or longing to see the light.
I feel almost certain that what Mrs. Jones said in the meetings about
the lights that appeared to her around Egryn, near Barmouth, could
have nothing to do with the form, the time, or the place of the
strange light Mrs. E. and myself saw.
Mrs. E. does not understand Welsh, so Mrs. Jones' addresses
•could have no direct influence upon her. Mrs. E.'s report of
what she saw would be similar to mine, and I believe that I sent
you as faithful and accurate a report of what we saw, and how and
when we saw it, as can be put in a few written words.
(22)
The next two accounts were given in Welsh, and are
translated here. Both Mrs. L. and Mrs. W. are North Walians.
Mrs. L., whose account I received on June 26th, 1905, de
scribes her experience as follows :
One night, when Mrs. Jones was staying in my house, we prayed
to see the light. About 1 a.m. we were standing on the door-step,
and I saw a strange light about forty or fifty yards away. It
appeared about 1^ feet from the ground. About oval in shape.
Cannot describe colour. It seemed to be moving and sparks flying
out of it. It appeared for a few minutes, and disappeared in the
form of sparks.
Mrs. W. says :
I was praying in the house one night, and afterwards went to
the door and saw on the opposite side of the valley, on the side
of the hill, a column of fire like a cloud, and I prayed for seeing
154 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
it nearer, and it appeared nearer in a round dark column, and a
light appeared underneath it. On another night I saw it appearing
in the shape of a house with three windows. Afterwards it appeared
in the shape of a chapel—very much like the chapel attended by
Mrs. Jones in North Wales.
Afterwards I saw it in the shape of an eye right in front of
me, and the eye broke in two, and the two parts fell downwards
and joined again, and appeared in the form of a man.
I prayed another night, and something came towards my mouth,
and I felt it like hot iron, and it nearly took away my breath.
Another vision appeared to me in the form of a man approaching
me with a small dish in his hand, and he said, "Take and eat"
I did not feel inclined to take it, but as I respected the person, I
took it. And after I took it, he said, "Go and preach the Gospel
to every creature."
(23)
From Mr. W. P., of D , M . The account,
which I received on February 11th, 1905, has two signa
tures, the second one being presumably that of Mr. P.'s
sister.
The only positive light I saw was a small one proceeding before
me on a quiet road on the way to chapel on a very dark night,
which I could not account for.
What my sister saw was something like a ball of light arising
from the ground to a great height, and all was light around it
everywhere. One end seemed to descend again to the ground till
it looked like the shape of a rainbow of white light and disappeared.
About the end of January the last one was seen ; what I saw was
some time before.
(24)
From Mr. W. M., of Welshpool. The account was received
on March 13th, 1905.
I personally saw no lights and heard no sounds ; but my wife
saw a bright light, as it were, reflected on the ceiling, but it was
much brighter and of a whiter hue than the reflection from any
lamp. It occurred, as nearly as I can remember, about a month
ago, but I have no idea as to the time, only that it was at night.
It was circular in shape, and a little larger than the rim of an
ordinary tea-cup, and lasted, as nearly as I can gather, about a
minute or so.

From Mr. T. J., of L , near W ; translated from
the original Welsh narrative.
March 11th, 1905.
There was a united meeting at the Wesleyan Chapel on
Saturday night, January 14th, 1905. We came out and went home
after the first meeting, but several of the young people remained to
conduct a second meeting, in which it broke out into praise through
out the place. It is impossible to say how many took part in prayer
that night. A great difficulty was had to restore order, and the
meeting was ended a little before half-past eleven. We had some
where about a mile and a half of road to go home, and that in
the direction of the east from the village where the chapel stands.
When we were about the back of some ten minutes to reach
home (we reached about 10.45 p.m.) we were coming up a small
hill. There were there another man and his wife besides myself
»nd my wife coming together. We—the two men—were coming
together, and the two women likewise were coming together after
08.
Suddenly I saw the thing most like that I can describe to that
which is called by us the falling of a star. It ran downwards, form
ing as it ran a kind of long tail, and as it approached the earth
it widened a little into small sparks, and it fell into the earth, as
it were the other side of the hedge from us, but I cannot say how
near, but it was not far.
My wife, M. J., was coming with Mrs. J. a little behind
us, as I have already said, and she saw it, a kind of light, on
the backs of us two men—some kind of light which she never
saw the like of before, and it vanished downwards in the direction
of the earth, and that is all we saw.
We heard no kind of sound whatever, and the light was all the
same colour.
(26)
From Mr. E. P. G.
June 20lh, 1905.
In the autumn of 1876 I attended a number of spiritualist seances,
nearly all without a paid medium, and chiefly with the same people
meeting at their own houses. In October or November my sister
and myself dined with Mrs. S., her daughter being there also.
We were to go on and meet Major and Mrs. 0., who were
156 Rev. A. T. Fryer. [past
entertaining the medium, Miss M. I had often sat with her
as medium, and she generally was a writing medium, either by
planchette or direct. As we were getting ready after dinner Major
O. drove up and said a servant had been taken suddenly ill,
and we must have the meeting at Mrs. S.'s. The dining-room
was cleared, and Mr. O., Miss M., and a friend of Mrs. 0-
(I think a cousin) came ; I cannot remember her name. We
sat round the dining-room table in total darkness, some gleams
of light from the street lamp having been noticed and the curtains
carefully pinned together by the Major and myself. I sat next
Mrs. S. and between her and Miss M., 0. being on the other
side of Miss M. I do not recollect how the other four—Mrs.
O., Miss S., my sister, and the cousin—sat. We sat in silence
for some time, nearly half an hour. At intervals O. asked Miss
M. if she felt the power. At last I felt twitching motions in
her arms, our hands touching, and expected the usual writing,
twitching and jerking generally preceding her writing. I looked
up, and saw five small lights moving in the air. They seemed
to be near the ceiling, but not touching it. The motion was slow
and irregular. They seemed to follow no rules. At times all close
together, then moving irregularly about in curves and circles, but
"never descending lower. So far as I could judge, they kept the
same height all the time. The room was a large high one, probably
twelve feet in height. I made no remark, and wondered if others
saw it. I must have watched for more than a minute when Miss
M. said suddenly, " The power is very strong," and then, " They
are here." My sister told me afterwards she had noticed the lights
before Miss M. spoke. I watched the lights in their movements
for some time, when 0. said, "Shall I ask!" Miss M. inter
rupted, saying, "Wait." Some time passed, and Miss M. twitched
more sharply, and I turned to her. As I did so I heard Mrs.
S. say, " Ah ! " and, looking up, found the lights had ceased.
In the dark it is difficult to estimate time accurately, but I
think it was from five to seven minutes from the time I first
saw them to their disappearance. Mrs. S. told me they grew
very faint quickly, and then disappeared. My sister said the same.
The light was that of a tiny luminous globe, very soft, but Dot
giving off any appreciable illumination. I tried to see the hook in
the ceiling from which a lamp sometimes hung, but failed to see
it. They were quite unlike the light of fire-flies, and their motion
quite different. Two were rather larger than the others.
li] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 157
I made careful notes on getting home, and next morning gave
them to my sister to correct, but she found her recollections tallied
with mine. I went to several pyrotechnists to see if there were
any substances that would produce such a light, but failed.
(27)
The following are the accounts of some of the witnesses who
saw the light at Ynysybwl on July 23rd, 1905.
(a) From Mr. M. J. P.
August 3rd, 1905.
Rs the lights seen at Ynysybwl on the 23rd of July last, I am
sending you my version of the affair, as I had the pleasure of
seeing it, which was as follows :
I went on the night of the 23rd, which was Sunday, for a
walk after supper ; although not in the habit of taking a walk,
something compelled me to go, so in company with a few friends
we went along the street for a short distance, when we were
attracted by a voice raised in prayer on the mountain side, and
we at once wended our way thither, where we had the pleasure
of joining in with the company already assembled in prayer and
praise to God, and our Maker met with us, and we received a great
blessing to each of our souls, praise God. Well, after about an
hour and a half we drew the meeting to a close, and commenced
our way homeward. By now we had got as far as what is called the
Robert Town Square, when we again commenced to praise God,
when my attention was suddenly drawn to a mysterious light which
appeared in the sky, which I had the pleasure of seeing. Firstly,
it appeared to my startled gaze to be a ball of light about the
size of the moon, with a slight mist over it. I gazed at it for
a short time and then the stars began to shoot out around it :
then it gradually rose higher in the heavens, and as it rose it
grew brighter and smaller and the smaller it got the brighter it
seemed to grow, and the last I saw of it, it was a little larger
than the evening star, and very bright. I might also say that
while the mist covered the light it would open and brighten at
intervals, so that [is] all I saw of the Mysterious Light.
Now, sir, that is the manner in which I saw the light, as also
did my brother. I might also say that I am not of an excitable
nature, therefore do not run away with the idea that what I saw
was pure imagination brought on by an excitable nature, because
if you do, you will be altogether mistaken.

(6) From Mr. R. J.
August 2nd, 1905.
Re the light seen at Ynysybwl on Sunday night, the 23rd of
July, I am sending you my version of the matter as seen by
myself, which is as follows :
I might say to commence that I as a Sunday School teacher,
with the most of my class, eleven in number, went on Sunday
evening to a place called Ynysyboeth, a distance of about five miles,
to a service conducted by Mrs. Jones, Egryn, the lady that has
been seeing all the mysterious lights. So we enjoyed ourselves
grand, and after the close of the meeting we went our way back
home to Ynysybwl ; but we arrived so far as the mountain side
that leads down to Ynysybwl, when we felt as if we were com
pelled to hold a prayer meeting there, which we did, and was in
a very short time joined by a godly company, where we met with
God in prayer and praise, and God wonderfully blessed us in our
souls, and encouraged us to press on to that mark of our calling,
which is in Christ Jesus, and also to show us that He was pleased
with us, we had a convert. Praise God for it. Now don't you
think God met with us ? We closed there in about an hour and
a half, and went down homewards ; but when we got to a place
called Robert Town Square, we again started to praise God, but
we had hardly started when the mysterious light already referred
to appeared, which as I saw it is as follows :
First of all my attention was drawn to it by a person in the
crowd, and I looked and saw a block of fire as it was rising
from the mountain side, and it followed along the mountain side
for about 200 or 300 yards, before it gradually rose to heaven.
Then a star, as it were, shot out to meet it, and they clapped
together and formed into a ball of fire. It also grew brighter as
it rose higher, and then it seemed to sway about a lot ; then it
seemed to form into something like the helm of a ship. The size
of it at this time would be about the size of the moon, but very
much brighter, and lasted about a quarter of an hour. I then
went home to call my wife to see it (which is a distance of about
300 yards), and [the] strange [thing] about it was I could not see
it from there, although my home faces the mountain side. But
when I got back to the square already mentioned it was again
quite visible. This, sir, is the manner in which I saw the light;
mind, saw it, I mean, not imagined it ; not at all.
u.] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 159
(e) From Mr. J. J. The account was received on August 6th,
1905.
la accordance with my promise to you I write you a full account
•of how I saw the "light." Eleven of us from Ynysybwl had gone
•over one Sunday evening to Ynysyboeth to a meeting at which
Mrs, Jones, Egryn, was present. We hail a grand meeting, and
two sinners gave themselves up. After the meeting was over, we
made our way homeward, singing hymns all the way to Abercynon.
After starting across the mountain, some of us felt incliued to have
a prayer meeting, but the majority were for having it on the
Ynysybwl side, and a glorious meeting it was. The heavenly powers
descended with force, and another convert was made.
We had now swelled considerably in number, and proceeded to
the square opposite the Robert Town Hotel, and while we were
singing the star appeared, like a ball of fire in the sky, glittering
and sparkling, and as it went up it seemed to be bubbling over.
This continued for about 20 minutes. . . .
(d) From Mrs. C. J. The account was received early in
August, 1905.
The manner in which the lights appeared to me at the Robert
Town Hotel Square was as follows :
Firstly, there appeared in the heavens a very large and bright
tall of fire. It was of a much more brilliant lustre than an
-ordinary star—very much the colour of a piece of iron white-heated.
It had two brilliant arms which protruded towards the earth.
"Between these arms there appeared a further light or lights
resembling a cluster of stars, which seemed to be quivering with
varying brightness. This was its form when I saw it, but others
who had seen it before me had noticed it growing from smaller
•dimensions. It lasted for ten minutes or more.
(e) From Miss A. J.
August 5th, 1905.
He the mysterious light or star which I saw on Sunday night
or rather Monday morning of the July 23rd, about 12.30 o'clock
-a.m. :
The manner it appeared to me was, firstly, a ball of misty light
in the heavens about 7 or 8 inches in diameter. It was very
misty when it appeared first to me, then it got very much brighter,
as its brilliancy became undescribable, the ball grew very much
160 . . Rev. A. T. Fryer. [part
larger, and farming an oval shape, it quivered and glittered very
much.
Then there appeared to be two great long streaks of misty light
coming from the ball forming something like the shape drawn;
those almost reached the earth.
I may say that I never saw anything so wonderful and bright,
it was most inspiring, and lasted for about ten minutes. It could
not have been any imagination, for there was not any one thinking
of any such things until very suddenly our attraction was drawn
to it.
The late Dean Howell, Dean of St. David, wrote to the Cyfaill
Egltcysig (a Welsh monthly) in December, 1902, just before his death,
a last message on the need of Wales. This letter ended, " If I
knew that this was my last message to my countrymen all over
Wales, before I am summoned to judgment and with the light
of eternity already dawning over me, this is my message, vit.
that the principal need of my country and dear nation at this
time is—spiritual revival through a special downpouring of the Holy
Spirit."
When this was first published in the Cyfaill it attracted con
siderable notice, and my friend who supplies the translation is not
alone in believing that it had much to do with the creation of
the Revival atmosphere. The republication of the message in the
Cymru, a Welsh monthly of large circulation, in November, 1904,
probably helped to extend interest in the Revival, especially
amongst persons who saw in the movement a response to the
Dean's fervent words.
Note.—In his Presidential Address (1897) \ Sir William Crookes
gave a table of the velocity of vibrations in 63 steps, and suggested
that the "X-rays" would be found to lie between the 58th and
62nd steps, and he added that, "It seems to me that in these
rays we may have a possible mode of transmitting intelligence.
. . . Let it be conceived that the brain contains a centre which
uses these rays as the vocal chords use sound vibrations and sends
them out, with the velocity of light, to impinge on the receiving
ganglion of another brain. In this way some of the phenomena
of telepathy and the transmission of intelligence from one sensitive
to another through long distances, seem to come into the domain
1 See Proceedings 8.P.R., Vol. XII., p. 338.
LL] Psychological Aspects of the Welsh Revival. 161
of law, and can be grasped. ... Is it inconceivable that intense
thought concentrated towards a sensitive with whom the thinker is in
close sympathy may induce a telepathic chain of brain-waves, along
which the message of thought can go straight to its goal without
loss of energy due to distance 1 "
I have suggested in the S.P.R. Journal (April, 1905), that the
contents of a telepathic message probably amount in volume to no
more than a word or two, as in code telegraphy, and that the
enlargement of the message into a scene or lengthy verbal com
munication is the work of the recipient mind.
Accepting the probability of a brain wave of sufficient intensity
to carry a word or sign to a mind in conscious or unconscious
-sympathy with the agent, it would appear that the operation within
the brain of the recipient, if sensitive to the message, is of a
totally different character. The mind then is not simply perceptive
but constructive. and, needless to say, works by the ordinary
machinery and vibratory methods it daily employs. The message is
realised in the form of sounds, changes of temperature, or visions, in
accordance with the mental potentiality of the percipient. Whether
the difference in mode of realisation has any relation or not to the
mental capacity and habitual thought methods of the operator in
other matters might be worth examination. At any rate, the limita
tion of the initial message to an agent's word or sign, and the
attribution of the resultant sounds or sights to the percipient, not
only goes far to explain " the clothes of ghosts " and the elabora
tion of scenic settings, the misunderstandings and erroneous
impressions, that are found in our records, but may do a little
to remove some of the objections to telepathy felt by many
scientific minds even when they are the subjects of its operation.

XENOGLOSSIE :
L'Ecriture automatique en langues étrangères}
Par M. Le Professeur Charles Richet.
Les observations, authentiques ou non, dans lesquelles des
mots ou des phrases d'une langue étrangère sont écrits par des
personnes n'ayant pu avoir par des moyens normaux quelque
notion de cette langue, ne sont pas très communes.2
Nous devons d'abord éliminer les cas dans lesquels, sur des
ardoises, par l'écriture directe, des médiums professionnels ont
donné des réponses en diverses langues inconnues d'eux ; car
toutes ces relations d'écriture directe sont assez problématiques,
et le fait d'une langue étrangère, écrite par quelqu'un qui
l'ignore, si merveilleux que soit le fait même, est peut-être
moins merveilleux encore que le fait d'un crayon qui écrit
tout seul : de sorte que le problème de l'écriture directe en
langues étrangères est en quelque sorte un double miracle,
qu'aucun témoignage, dûment et authentiquement contrôlé, ne
vient encore confirmer.
Quant aux faits de langue étrangère parlée ou écrite auto
matiquement, ils sont vraiment peu abondants. Il faut laisser
dans la pénombre des légendes l'histoire des saints qui, le
jour de la Pentecôte, ont parlé toutes les langues ; l'histoire
des religieuses de Loudun qui, possédées par des démons,
1 An incomplete English version of this article has appeared in The Annal* of
Psychical Science for June, 1905.—Editor.
2 Je me permettrais volontiers ici un néologisme; nous pourrions dire que
cette écriture en langues totalement étrangères est de la xénoglossie (So,os,
étranger, y\w<r<ra, langue).

répondaient en latin aux exorcismes du prêtre ; ou même le
récit de cette femme qui, étant malade, parlait l'hébreu, ce
qu'on attribuait à un souvenir de son enfance (elle avait été,
dans sa jeunesse, servante d'un savant qui lisait tout haut en
hébreu). L'histoire a été souvent racontée; mais on ne peut
que difficilement recourir à la source véritable.1 Citerons-nous
le français de Mme Piper, qui n'a jamais appris le français ?
11 ne dépasse pas ce qu'on peut savoir de la langue française
en lisant les journaux anglais. Reste, il est vrai, la très belle
observation, si admirablement prise par notre collègue M.
Flournoy. Hélène Smith transcrivait (avec beaucoup de
fautes), quelques mots de sanscrit, mais sans réussir à faire
des phrases ayant un sens. M. Flournoy a bien expliqué
qu' " elle a absorbé ce qu'elle savait de sanscrit en feuilletant
une grammaire ou d'autres documents écrits." {Des Indes à,
la Planète Mars, lre édit., 1900, p. 317.)
D'ailleurs, je ne veux pas faire ici une étude complète,
critique et bibliographique, de ce phénomène, car j'aurais divers
faits intéressants à citer (notamment les récits curieux de Judge
Edmunds, en Amérique, 1859); je désire seulement relater des
faits dont j'ai été témoin. L'interprétation est extrêmement
difficile, et je dois dire, en commençant, que je ne pourrai
donner d'explication adéquate. Pourtant, il est bon d'analyser
minutieusement, autant que possible, des phénomènes de cette
nature, car on ne saurait admettre à la légère les hypothèses
non rationnelles ou les affirmations téméraires ; et la dissection,
si je puis dire, de ces faits paradoxaux, veut être poussée très
loin.
Aussi m'excusera-t-on des détails dans lesquels je serai
forcé d'entrer.
Il s'agit de phrases, même de pages grecques, écrites par
une personne qui ne sait pas le grec. Nous discuterons les
conditions de ce phénomène, et les déductions qu'on peut en
donner. Il faut d'abord indiquer le fait lui-même.
II.
La personne qui a écrit ces phrases grecques, en état de
somnambulisme, ou en état de demi-conscience, est une dame
1See Journal S.P.R., Vol. XI., p. 16 (January, 1903), for the origin of thia

de 35 ans, qui n'est pas professionnellement médium, encore
qu'elle ait présenté à diverses reprises des faits remarquables
de clairvoyance. Comme son nom ne peut être donné ici, je
l'appellerai Mme X.
Je vis Mme X. à Paris pour la première fois le 7 novembre
1899. Notre ami commun, Fréd. Myers, avait disposé cette
entrevue. Quoiqu'il ne s'agît pas ce jour-là d'une séance,
dans le sens ordinaire du mot, cependant en réalité, peu de
temps après que je fus arrivé, et pendant cette visite même,
Mme X. perdit à peu près connaissance, et, dans un état de
transe, les yeux fermés, elle écrivit péniblement au crayon
la phrase suivante : 1
(i) H avdpwirivrj aod)ia oXiyov tlvoç apia cot* icai ouoevoç
aXXa yap rjStj apa aireivai.
Remarquons tout de suite qu'il y a là deux phrases dis
tinctes ; et qu'il faut mettre un point après ovSevot. De
même, il faut lire non tiStj apa airetvat, mais %Stj &pa
airievai,
M. Piddington, qui était présent, a constaté comme moi le
grand effort, presque la souffrance de Mme X., pendant qu'elle
écrivait ces lignes. C'est avec une notable lenteur, et une
sorte de tremblement convulsif que les caractères étaient tracés.
Au réveil, il ne semble pas que Mme X. en eût conservé le
souvenir.
Le sens de la première phrase est très simple : La sagesse
humaine est peu de chose, et même elle n'est rien. Le sens de
la seconde est : Voici que déjà je vais vous quitter.
D'après les renseignements précieux que m'a donnés M.
Shipley, la première phrase se trouve dans l'Apologie de
Socrate (IX. 23. A), de Platon, et la seconde aussi, à la fin
de ce même ouvrage.
Quelques jours après, étant encore dans le même état de
transe, M™° X. écrivit en ma présence ces mots :
(ii) JLaipere cyco atotjitto? ovonaTo AvTwvivoç Renouard.
XapvcrrwT to) dew.
Cette phrase se divise en deux parties. Pour la première

partie, en cherchant dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios1 (lre
édit.), à ovofm, on trouve, ainsi que me l'a fait remarquer M.
J.-B. Shipley, la phrase suivante : icâiroioç ovofiaTi 'AvTwvioç :
Un nommé Antoine. (Remarquons en passant cette coïncidence
vraiment singulière, que, en 1846, ç'a été le nom d'Antoine
qui a été pris comme exemple.) Alors il faut corriger
kotiittoç ovofiaTo, en lisant Kairoioç ovôfiaTi, et le sens de cette
première phrase devient : Salut (KalpeTe). Je suis le nommé
Antonin.
Remarquons aussi que dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios
(dans la première et non dans la seconde édition) il y a la
coupure 'AvTûvi— et à la ligne suivante oc : de sorte que la
lettre v, qui ne se trouve pas dans le texte, est, peut-être,
la transcription imparfaite du trait qui suit AvTwvi.
Quant à la seconde phrase, elle signifie : Rendez grâce à
Dieu.
Le nom d'Antoine Renouard, qui pouvait être connu de
Mme X., est le nom de mon arrière-grand-père, Antoine-Augustin
Renouard, éditeur et bibliophile, de Paris (1770-1853). A.-A.
Renouard a publié diverses éditions d'auteurs grecs : entre
autres Daphnis et Chloé, de Longus. Son nom se trouve dans
les dictionnaires bibliographiques et dans les encyclopédies.
Il fut le père de Ch. Renouard, le père de ma mère (1794-
1878).
Quelques autres communications, signées aussi de A.-A. R.,
furent données à la même époque (nov.-déc. 1899).
1 Comme j'aurai l'occasion de revenir souvent sur ce dictionnaire, je dois
en donner ici l'indication bibliographique exacte : Dictionnaire grec-français et
français-grec, par Ch.-D. Byzantius publié par André Coromélas. Edition
seconde, stéréotype. Athènes : Imprimerie d'André Coromélas, rue d'Hermès
n° 215, 1856, 1 vol. de 520, 422 et irpo\eyoiicva de la première (xi) et la
deuxième (viii) édition.
L'exemplaire qui m'a été adressé par le D' Vlavianos est la deuxième
édition. Mais, comme on le verra par la suite, tous les passages donnés par
M1" X... se retrouvent dans la première édition; et en outre il en est un
qui ne se trouve pas dans la seconde édition, et qui se trouve dans la
première, de sorte que c'est, à n'en pas douter, d'après l'image de la première
édition que les phrases grecques ont été reproduites.
J'ai trouvé à la Bibliothèque nationale de Paris cette première édition.

I.I.] Xénoglossie. 167
Ayez un peu de patience. On trouve dans le dictionnaire de
Byzantios à eoyi) : oXa virâyovv kolt evyyv (Tout vient à
souhait)}
La phrase déXeTe ev\apio-Ttj6ij se trouve aussi dans le
dictionnaire au mot ^.v^apurTw (p. 181, col. 3). De même
aussi E^ere 'o\lyriv vironoirfv au mot oXîyoç (p. 310, col. 1).
L'autre phrase, ainsi d'ailleurs que toutes celles qui précèdent,
a été écrite par Mme X. devant moi. Mais ce jour-là, Mme X.
était dans un état de grand tremblement nerveux. C'était
an mois de juin, vers 7 h. 1/2 du soir. Dans la petite
chambre où nous nous trouvions, le soleil se couchait ; et la
phrase grecque qui fut alors écrite se rapporte exactement à
cette circonstance particulière: Quand le soleil est à son déclin
ou à son lever, les ombres s'allongent.
Or cette phrase se trouve textuellement dans le dictionnaire
grec de Byzantios au mot 'E/cTe/wo (p. 139, col. 2). Signalons-
une légère erreur : eicTeu/aTat pour eicTelveTai ; la traduction
française en est donnée : Quand le soleil est à son levant ou à
son couchant, l'ombre se projette au loin.
Nous aurons l'occasion de revenir sur cette remarquable
expérience.
Pendant longtemps, aucune phrase grecque ne fut plus-
donnée. Mais en 1904 les mots suivants furent écrits:
(vii) UpurrotoKoç Ta Xpiatov Xeuica o-KXrjpwç 0a Tt/xwptjdtf
avaXeœç (et, comme à ce moment Mme X. ne pouvait plus
écrire, les lettres suivantes ont été données, sans que j'insiste
ici sur les conditions physiques du phénomène, par le moyen
des raps) o-icXtipaK Ta KpifiaTa Kvpiou afivao-oç. Le mot
Kpi/j.aTa a été corrigé trois fois : Kpifian ; icpi/iade ; icpi/xaTa.
Kupiov a été corrigé aussi trois fois, de Kupov à icvptov et
Kvpiov.
Pour le commencement de la phrase, M. Shipley suppose
que le quatrième mot est sans doute Xeywv (pour Xevica) et
à la fin de la phrase avaXoywç pour avaXewç : ce qui peut
se traduire : " Le premier né, le Christ. Celui qui parle
rudement sera puni pareillement durement."
Quant à l'autre phrase : Les jugements de Dieu sont un,

abtmt, elle se comprend et est tres correcte. Cette phrase
se trouve dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios au mot Kplna (TCI
Kpiu.ara fvplov afivavos), p. 246, col. 2.
Telle est a peu pres, brievement exposed, ce que je pourrais
appeler la premiere phase du phenomena. Nous arrivons a
la seconde phase, qui debuta par un fait remarquable.
La communication suivante en langue grecque m'a e"te"
adressee par Mme X., alors qu'elle e"tait a Paris et moi a Car-
queiranne, en octobre 1904.
Elle est ecrite sur une seule feuille de papier et est divise"e
en quatre parties d'ine"gale e"tendue. La partie que j'appellerai
A est en gros caracteres, comme aussi la seconde (B). La
troisieme partie (C), qui ne comprend que deux mots, est en
tres gros caracteres. La quatrieme partie (D) est en caracteres
tres fins.

Cette communication e"tait, ainsi que je 1'ai dit, accompagne"e
d'une lettre dans laquelle Mme X. me disait: "Je u'ai vu que
du grec, et du grec, et enfin ma main a du e"crire ce non-
sens que je vous envoie avant que j'aie pu me mettre au
travail. Ma main etait dans un e"tat d'amne"sie longtemps
apres... J'espere maintenant me retrouver... How absurd!
Ma main va me trahir de nouveau. On n'a pas d'ide"e
combien est drole cette sensation ; je lutte centre quelque
chose comme dans un r6ve ; tout semble loin, et je ne o-ais
qui va gagner." Les derniers mots de cette lettre contenaient
des caracteres grecs: o- et y pour s.
Apres avoir cherche" tant bien que mal a traduire ce grec
difficile, je fus mis sur la voie de 1'origine tres e"trange de
ces longues citations. En cherchant dans le Dictimmaire de
la langut, franfaise de Littre", au mot Damas, M. Courtier
trouva cette phrase : IIs deroulerent des magnifiques e"toffes
de soie de la Chine, des lampas decoupes k jour, des damas
d'un blanc saline"... (Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Paul et
Virginie.) II e"tait done e"vident que la premiere phrase (viii
A) etait la traduction d'un passage de Paul et Virginie.
Comme a Paris il me fut impossible de trouver une e"dition
grecqne de Paul et Virginie, je m'adressai a mon confrere le
Dr Vlavianos, d'Athenes, en lui faisant part de mon de"sir,
et du motif pour lequel je le lui temoignais. II me re"pondit
en me disant que les phrases viii A., B. et D. se trouvaient
textuellement dans le dictionnaire grec-francais et frau^.ais-
grec de Byzantios et Coromelas. Et il m'envoya ce dictionnaire,
(seconde e"dition) dont j'ignorais absolument 1'existence.
En effet, dans cet ouvrage, qui est sans doute le dictionnaire
classique qui sert aux jeunes gens grecs a apprendre le
fran^ais, il y a dans les Prole"gomenes de la premiere e"dition,
Prolegomenes qui sont e"erits en grec (pagep a, ligne 29), la
phrase XpyrOai \f^eariv 'E\\qviKais, eireiSuv Pcojuaiav irpoyeipovs
170 Professor Charles Richet. [PART
fj.iI e^uxriv. Cette phrase n'est pas traduite en franijais : c'est
la traduction d'une phrase de Cice>on donnee en latin : " Graecis
licet utare, cum voles, si te latinae forte deficiant." Ces mots
latins etaient suivis imme"diatement de la traduction grecque,
mise entre parenthese et guillemots, ("Xprjcrdai... " etc.).
On remarquera la rigoureuse exactitude du texte et des
accents, alors que, dans les e"critures pn5cedentes, il n'y avait
que tres irregulierement et rarement des accents.
A la ligne suivante du dictionnaire, le mot u^i /uoVot-
revient souvent ; en effet 1'auteur, M. Byzantios, parlant de
son dictionnaire, dont il fait naturellement 1'e"loge, dit qu'il
contient les mots, non seulement Anecdote, mais Anecdo".icr;
non seulement Mystique, mais Mysticisme ; non seulement
Phenomene, mais Phenomenal. (o%t novov Mystique, aXXa <ca)
Anecdotier, KOI Anecdotique ; o^t novov Anecdote, aXXa /cai
Mysticisme, KOO Mysticitt; ; 0x« fj.6vov Phenomene aXXa
KOI Phenomenal). Peut-etre le mot o-^i fiovov mis dans la
phrase viii A. a-t-il e"te pris pour Phdnomtnc ; mais rien ne
1'indique et ne nous autorise k supposer un contre-sens. Ce
mot veut dire : Non seulement ; et ce n'est qu'une hypothese
assez hasardee que d'admettre que, dans le document e"crit
qui m'a ete" envoye, il a e"te mis pour signifier Phttwmtne.
Cela d'autant plus que k o^t, on trouve 0x« iuovov, non
seulement.
La phrase viii C. : XOiTOy. 2,uyyaipqcrt';, semble indiquer
qu'a ce moment il y a eu fatigue (KoVov) et excuse, pardon
(2uyxwpqcris) pour cette fatigue.
II est meme probable que ce sont ces deux mots qui ont-
e"te e"erits les derniers.
Mais deux autres citations se trouvent en grec moderne
dans les Prole"gomenes du Dictionnaire de Byzantios (page e
de la 2° e"dition). Je les donne ici textuellement pour qu'on
puisse se rendre compte des minimes differences entre ce
qui est imprime" dans le Dictionnaire, et ce qui a et
par Mms X.
Voici d'abord la citation viii A. :

Voici le texte de Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, qui a e"te"
traduit en grec :
:' Us de"roulerent de magnifiques e"toffes de soie de la Chine,
des lampas de"coupe"s a jour, des damas d'un blanc sating
d'autres d'un vert de prairie, d'autres d'un rouge a e"blouir,
des taffetas roses, des satins de pleine main, des pe"kins moelleux
comme le drap, des nankins bleues et jaunes, et jusqu'a des
pagnes de Madagascar."
Les accents sont mis dans la proportion suivante. II y
en a 51 dans le texte grec. II y en a eu 28 dans le
manuscrit de Mme X., soit un peu plus de la moitie", et ils
sont correctement mis, sauf pour 'E^erv\i^av qui est e"crit
v. II n'y a d'erreur dans le texte que pour
, qui est e"crit Karaa-pcnn-ovra. De plus a
est e"ent ar'Xacrja ; et irepiCwfiara est e"crit irepi£wfj.ara, comme
si la lettre £ etait impossible k transcrire.
Quant au texte lui-me'me, il est peu interessant ; il a ete
pris par Byzantios comme exemple de la possibilite qu'il y
a de traduire en grec moderne des expressions trancjaises peu
usitees et un peu e"tranges.
La phrase viii D. est aussi une transcription d'un passage
du Dictionnaire de Byzantios. La encore 1'auteur a voulu
donner un specimen de termes franqais peu usites que 1'on
peut traduire en grec. C'est la traduction d'un passage des
Mi1steres de Paris d'Eugene Sue :

Voici le texte d'Eugène Sue :
"Joignez à cela l'été, pour perspective, les vert(e)s pro
fondeurs d'un jardin touffu, solitaire, encombré de fleurs,
peuplé d'oiseaux, arrosé d'un petit ruisseau d'eau vive, qui,
avant de se répandre sur la fraîche pelouse, tombe du haut
d'une roche noire et agreste, y brille comme un pli de gaze
d'argent, et se fond en lame nacrée dans un bassin limpide
où de beaux cygnes blancs (comme la neige ?) se jouent avec
grâce."
Les accents sont très exactement mis ; il y en a 94 dans
la copie, et 104 dans le texte grec. Même les accents re
lativement peu usités comme û>pn et Xeirrovcpriç sont cor
rectement transcrits.
Il n'y a pas de fautes de texte ; je signalerai seulement
ceci : d'abord la lettre X, est correctement transcrite à ^wvToç,
par exemple. Ensuite, le \Jr est écrit d'une manière assez
étrange qui peut à première vue faire penser qu'il y a confusion
entre le <p et le \|r. Mais ce ne serait une erreur ; car les
deux lettres sont écrites différemment. Le \|r est écrit comme
un I au milieu duquel un o a été inscrit ; ce qui donne l'appar
ence (p. Le <p au contraire est écrit tout à fait normalement.
Une curieuse erreur est à la ligne 5 du manuscrit. Le
mot /xiKpov est écrit, sans qu'il y ait de confusion possible,
HiKpav, et il n'y a pas d'accent sur le o-. Nous verrons plus
tard qu'il y a lieu d'insister sur la nature de cette erreur.
Enfin,—mais c'est peut-être là une coïncidence—il y a
comme une consonance en forme de rimes dans les deux
premières lignes ; de sorte qu'il y a au début presque deux
vers rimés, ayant chacun dix syllabes. Rien d'analogue n'existe
dans le texte grec, qui est écrit comme de la prose.
J'ai dit déjà que cette citation viii D. est écrite en caractères
beaucoup plus fins que les deux autres. Il semble que ce
soit une tout autre écriture. A la loupe, on reconnaît qu'il
y a un léger tremblement, manifeste surtout vers la fin.
La phrase viii B. se trouve dans la première édition (et non
dan3 la seconde), du livre de Byzantios ; mais avec un
changement important.
Le dictionnaire est en effet dédié au roi Louis-Philippe,
et la dédicace est en deux colonnes, une colonne pour le

Le premier alinéa (grec) est la phrase viiiB. tout entière,
avec cette différence que le mot TaXX/a, donné par Mms X.,
est, dans le texte de Byzantios et Coromélas, 'H'EXXây.
Et voici le texte français... Après avoir conquis par de
pénibles travaux son indépendance politique, la Grèce se propose
aujourd'hui un nouveau but non moins noble qut le premier :
die veut rappeler dans son sein les lumières qvi l'avaient jadis
couverte de gloire.
Je ferai remarquer que, dans l'exemplaire de la Bibliothèque
nationale, que j'ai sous les yeux, le dictionnaire français-grec
(dans lequel il n'y a d'ailleurs pas de phrases grecques citées),
n'est pas coupé, tandis que le dictionnaire grec-français est
coupé. Il n'y a d'ailleurs pas de traduction dans le dictionnaire
français-grec du mot France en TàWla ; mais au dictionnaire
grec-français est ajouté un petit lexique des noms propres
(p. 400-401 ; iriva^ Kvpiwv ovofiaTwv) où ToXXla (ij) est traduit
par France.
Les accents ont été mis dans la proportion suivante: il y
en a 44 dans le texte grec : il y en a 8 dans l'écriture de
Mme X. H n'y a pas de faute de texte ; car le k et le \
sont écrits à peu près de la même manière par Mmo X., de
sorte qu'il est difficile de savoir quand elle écrit k et quand x-
Enfin il existe entre le document viii et les autres phrases
grecques données plus haut, cette différence fondamentale que
toute l'écriture grecque (viii A., B., C, D.), m'a été envoyée
sans que j'aie vu Mm8 X. l'écrire.
Or, ces jours-ci, un nouveau phénomène s'est produit, d'une
extrême importance, car en ma présence Mme X. a écrit toute
une longue phrase semblable à celles que j'ai données plus
haut, et relevant de la même origine, le dictionnaire de
Byzantios.
J'avais annoncé à Mme X. que j'avais reçu le dictionnaire
de Byzantios ; et elle n'avait pas été médiocrement surprise
de cette découverte imprévue. Mais je ne lui avais pas
apporté le livre. Or, une ou deux semaines plus tard, le 2
mai, comme je lui allais rendre visite, et que je lui parlais
de mon dessein d'apporter le livre de Byzantios à Londres,
nn nouveau phénomène se produisit.
Ce jour-là, en effet (le 2 mai), elle me dit soudain, après
quelques mots de conversation, qu'elle se sentait incapable

de parler en anglais, et qu'elle se voyait entoure"e de caracteres
grecs ; alors, dans un etat de demi-conscience, elle prit un
stylographe, et, devant moi, debout sur son balcon, elle ecrivit
la phrase suivante :
(ix) " . . oXa TO ravrd,
puis elle barra ces trois mots et e"crivit alors sans interruption
les lignes suivantes :
" . . oXa TO Ttaftaria TOTIO . . ti^ov «oy aoX«r/ua5y . .

Pour le dire tout de suite, cette phrase est le commence
ment de la citation d'Eugene Sue donne"e plus haut, et elle
se trouve aussi, pr&edant la phrase viiiI»., dans le dictionnaire
de Byzautios. Je la donne ici telle qu'elle est dans le texte

ecrit sous mes yeux par Mme X.

avaient pour ornements des groupes de biscuit ou de terre
cuite de Clodion, et sur leurs socles de jaspe ou de breche
antique quelques precieuses copies des plus joli(e)s groupes
du Musee (apocryphe de Naples), en marbre blanc."
Je ferai d'abord quelques courtes remarques quant a la
nianiere d'ecrire de Mme X. Elle ecrivait debout ; tenant en
mains le stylographe et le cahier, et par consequent dans
des conditions d'assez difficile e"criture, qui est alors assez
tremblee et parfois peu distincte. Mme X. semblait regarder
dans le vide et copier quelque chose qu'elle voyait devant
elle. II etait 4 heures de la journee. J'e"tais tout pres d'elle,

cette e"criture faite sous mes yeux,: dans des conditions d'absolue
certitude.
Maintenant, pour la comparaison du manuscrit avec -le
text* donne" par Byzautios, quelques points . interessants
doivent e"tre developpe"s. Les points avant "..oXa" et apres
" (rTo\io-fj.ovs . ." sont exactement conformes au texte. Les
accents sont mis presque tous. II y en a 49 dans le texte,
et 39 dans le manuscrit. Les erreurs sont peu nombreuses,
an peu plus nombreuses cependant que dans la pre"ce"dente
transcription : iro\vSoirava pour iro\vSdirava ; TtofiaTta pour
irrl\oir\a(biKrjs pour irtj\oir\acrriKrjs ; tuoiTiSos pour
OiTO, dSt1v pour cnropaSqv ; aurltvira pour avr'iTvlra,
etc.
Je dois dire qu'on peut lire aamrvira et peut-etre (riropdSqv
dans le texte donne par Mme X.
Je signalerai aussi deux erreurs extre'mement interessantes,
parce qu'elles semblent nous prouver qu'il y a eu la un phe"-
noraene visuel, quelle que soit la nature essentielle de ce
phe"nom&ne.
En effet, le mot aToXjo-/xous est ecrit croX«o-/xa^y. Je ne
me pre"occupe pas du T du commencement, qui a e"te omis
dans la transcription, ce qui s'explique par ce fait que
dans la premiere e"dition a-r est e"crit y: abre"viation typo-
graphique qui est dans la premiere e"dition, et non dans la
seconde. Mais j'appelle 1'attention sur le S tinal qui remplace
le v de la fin de aroXioytoi'y. o-oXio-^a^y est un mot qui
n'est pas grec et qui n'a lue'me aucune consonance grecque ;
car presque jamais un mot grec ne se termine en ^ia^y. Seule-
ment, le i- ressemble de loin & un S, si bien que c'est comme
si les caracteres typographiques avaient e"te vus de loin et
superficiellement transcrits par quelqu'un qui ne sait pas le
grec.
De mgme, 6/u«Xoi/y, qui a e"1e" e"crit, k n'en pas douter,
Sfu\ovs, n'a guere forme grecque. Mais 6 ressemble de loin
a S, et alors la transcription visuelle a donne Sfit\avs pour

ecritures qui me furent alors donne"es par Mme X. immediate-
ment apres cette transcription du dictionnaire de Byzantios (il
est inutile de dire que je n'avais pas montre" le livre a Mme X.).
Je lui demandai de me donner en grec une explication de la
phrase e"crite, et de me parler de la prochaine communication
que je devais faire sur ce sujet ;i Londres.

de A. A. R. (Antoine Augustin Renouard), ainsi qu'aux premiers
jours, au de"but des premieres communications en grec qui
m'avaient ete" denue"es.

(Souvenez-vous-en. )
Toutes ces phrases se retrouvent dans le dictionnaire de
Byzantios. Je les transcris ici :

(Souvenez-vov.s-en) au mot 'Ei/0w/itou/ua« (p. 149, col. 3).
Si 1'on compare les accents mis dans ces diverses citations,
on en constatera 1'exactitude ; il y en a 56 dans le texte
grec, et 52 dans la transcription, ce qui vent dire en somme
que tous les accents sont mis, et mis correctement. II n'y a
d'erreur que pour (x) irapoSfy au lieu de irapoSia ; (xi) TO
avnypa(pov pour TO avriypa(pov. En somme, extre'mement
peu de chose.
L'erreur de irapoS(p pour irapoSa eat bien infce>essante, car
c'est une erreur visuelle, comme en pourrait commettre quel-
qu'un qui lit hativement et ne commit pas le grec. II n'y
a pas plus de terminaisons en oS(ft que plus haut eri fiaSy pour

Je dois aussi faire remarquer que ces phrases grecques
s'appliquent avec une certaine precision a des choses actuelles;
car j'avais demande a Mme X. de me donner une explication
sur la communication qui venait de m'e'tre faite par elle ; et
les mote (x) et (xi) s'y adaptent exactement, comme aussi
(xii) et (xiii).
Quant a la phrase (xiv), elle se rapporte a un evenement

178 Professor Charles Richet. [part
actuel, la guerre russo-japonaise, dont nous avions parlé aussi;
et enfin pour la phrase (xv), ce jour-là même Mme X. avait
fredonné à diverses reprises une vieille chanson française
(Monsieur et Madame Denis), dont le refrain est " Souvenez-
vous-en," et elle m'avait demandé si je la connaissais.
Au point de vue de la signification générale de ces phrases
grecques, sans nous occuper maintenant de leur origine, on
peut leur assigner, quant à leur finalité en quelque sorte, une
double cause.
Dans un cas, elles ont pour but de donner une preuve
matérielle, technique pour ainsi dire, de la connaissance et
compréhension du grec (citations longues—soleil et ombres
allongées—copie conforme à l'original, etc.).
Dans l'autre cas, ce sont des idées générales, un peu mystiques
à ce qu'il semble, sur la voie à suivre, sur la nécessité de
poursuivre l'étude des mystères (v), l'imperfection de la sagesse
humaine (i), etc.
De sorte que, malgré l'apparente incohérence de ces phrases,
on découvre la trame serrée d'une sorte de pensée directrice
cherchant à atteindre par deux voies différentes le même but
Tels sont donc, en somme, les faits dont je vais chercher
l'explication, avec tous les détails nécessaires. i
III.
Je dirai tout d'abord, pour simplifier, que les trois seules
hypothèses que dans l'état actuel de la science on puisse
émettre, sont : (1), une fraude consciente, astucieuse, voulue,
prolongée et habile ; (2), une mémoire inconsciente de choses
vues et oubliées ; (3), l'intelligence d'un esprit pénétrant l'intelli
gence de Mme X. Or ces trois explications me paraissent
toutes trois également absurdes .et impossibles.
Je vais les examiner librement l'une après l'autre.
(1) D'abord qu'il me soit permis de demander pardon à
Mme X. de discuter l'hypothèse de la fraude volontaire. Je
connais sa loyauté irréprochable, et je m'en porte garant
comme s'il s'agissait de moi-même. Mais c'est une dure nécessité
de ces sortes d'expériences d'exiger autre chose qu'un acte de
foi. Même s'il s'agissait de moi, je serais contraint de donner
des preuves autres que des preuves morales. Ces preuves
Li.] Xénoglossie. 179
morales, si puissantes qu'elles soient pour moi, ne suffiront pas
aux autres, et je dois, ainsi que Mme X. me l'a elle-même
instamment demandé, examiner en toute indépendance cette
question de fraude, et faire comme s'il ne s'agissait pas
d'une personne dont la sincérité est au-dessus de tout soupçon.
D'abord Mme X. ne sait pas le grec. Certes il est impossible
de prouver d'une manière absolue qu'on ne sait pas une langue.
Quoiqu'on puisse facilement prouver qu'on connaît une langue
étrangère ; il est radicalement impossible de prouver qu'on
Yignore. Pourtant, on peut arriver à établir que le grec est
une langue difficile à savoir, et qu'on ne l'apprend pas au pied
levé ; que Mme X. n'a jamais, ni dans son enfance, ni plus
tard, étudié les livres grecs ; que ni ses amis, ni moi, nous
ne l'avons jamais vue étudier le grec ; et que par conséquent,
même a priori, l'invraisemblance qu'elle a étudié et qu'elle
connaît le grec est extrême.
Il faut faire une réserve lorsqu'il est dit qu'elle n'a vu ni
ne possède de livres grecs. En effet, au mois de novembre
1899, quelques jours avant la première visite que je devais
lui faire, elle se sentit soudain envahie par le désir d'apprendre
le grec, et alors elle s'adressa à une dame de ses amies, et
la pria de lui procurer quelques livres grecs. Mme Z. acheta
alors deux petits livres classiques, d'occasion, maculés par les
écoliers qui y avaient travaillé, et portant encore les taches
et les dessins dont sont coutumiers les enfants ; ces deux livres,
M™* X. ne les regarda même pas. Il paraît qu'il lui suffit
de les avoir. Elle les mit dans un recoin de sa bibliothèque
sans les regarder davantage. Ce sont les Premiers exercices
grecs de l'abbé Ragon (12e édition, Paris, Poussielgue, 1898),
et la Chrestomathie grecque, par l'abbé Ragon (4° édition.
Paris, Poussielgue, 1897).
J'ai longuement examiné ces deux livres. Il ne s'y trouve
rien qui ressemble de près ou de loin aux phrases qui ont
été données; il n'y a même pas d'alphabet grec. Le mot
avdpunrtva, qui est dans la première phrase écrite en novembre
1899, ne se trouve ni dans l'un ni dans l'autre de ces deux
ouvrages, au petit lexique sommaire qui leur est annexé.
D'ailleurs, cette constatation était assez inutile, puisque les
livres de Ragon sont des livres de grec ancien, et qu'il s'agit
dans les manuscrits donnés par Mme X. de grec moderne.
180 Professor Charles Richet. [part
II est inutile d'ajouter que Mmo X. n'a jamais vu le
dictionnaire de Byzantios, et que la première fois qu'elle a
aperçu cet ouvrage, ç'a été quand je le lui ai apporté le 2 mai,
après que toutes les phrases grecques rapportées plus haut
avaient été écrites par elle.
Donc, en toute évidence, Mme X. ne sait pas le grec, et ce
qui vient corroborer avec une autorité irréfutable cette affirma
tion, c'est que dans ses écrits grecs il y a des fautes telles
qu'elles ne peuvent être commises par quelqu'un qui connaît
le grec, même très superficiellement. Ainsi, par exemple, tu
àvTiypadtov pour to àvTlypacpov ; èv wapôSd) pour èv irapôou ;
fiucpo-v pour fiticpov, etc. Ce sont là des fautes qu'un écolier,
deux semaines de rudiment, ne commettrait pas.
Je donnerai une autre preuve encore, tout à fait technique,
pour montrer que Mme X écrit le grec comme une personne
qui ne le connaît pas.
Mon ami J. Héricourt, dans une étude attentive faite à
propos d'un document célèbre (le fameux papier de l'affaire
Dreyfus) a démontré que l'écriture courante, vue à une très
forte loupe ou reproduite avec grossissement par la photographie,
n'était ni tremblée ni irrégulière, tandis qu'il en était autre
ment pour l'écriture imitée. Celle-là est tremblée, irrégulière,
trahissant l'hésitation dans le graphisme ; de sorte que l'on
peut, en étudiant à la loupe une écriture quelconque, recon
naître, selon qu'elle est tremblante ou non, si c'est une
écriture courante ou une écriture imitée. Or l'écriture grecque
de Mme X est très tremblée, tout à fait comme le serait celle
d'une personne qui n'écrit pas le grec couramment, mais en
le copiant, sans pouvoir l'écrire, d'après une image qu'elle a
devant les yeux.
Donc, en résumant toute cette discussion, j'arrive à considérer
comme dûment et solidement établi que Mme X. ne sait pas le
grec.
J'aborde maintenant ce qui est le fonds même de la question,
à savoir pourquoi la similitude rigoureuse, absolue, entre les
phrases grecques qui ont été écrites soit devant moi, soit en
mon absence, et les phrases que l'on trouve en divers endroits
du dictionnaire de Byzantios.
Kemarquons d'abord que l'exemplaire que je possède m'a été,
vers le 1er avril de cette année, envoyé d'Athènes, qu'il a été
LL] Xenoglossie. 181
irnprime a Athenes, et qu'il n'en existe probablement pas
beaucoup d'exemplaires & Paris. Je me suis adresse" a un
libraire de Paris qui m'a dit ne pouvoir s'en procurer qu'en
le faisant venir d'Athenes meme. L'autre exemplaire (1" e"di
tion), provient de la Bibliotheque nationale. Cela ne veut pas
dire assortment que cet ouvrage ne puisse se rencontrer quel-
que part a Paris ; mais il est tres rare, a coup sur. J'admets
fort bien qu'il en existe (ou qu'il en a existe), a Paris ; mais
c'est un livre tree rare, a coup sur; ce n'est pas un livre
de classe, car nos jeunes e"coliers n'apprennent jamais le grec
modeme ; et les dictionnaires grecs qu'on peut se procurer
oouramment sont tous, sans exception, des dictionnaires de grec
ancien.
Pourtant il est e"vident que la relation entre les phrases
ecrites par Mme X. et les phrases du dictionnaire de Byzan-
tios n'est pas fortuite. A partir de la phrase vi, jusqu'a la
phrase xv, toutes les citations, les longues et les courtes, se
trouvent dans le dictionnaire dont elles sont la transcription
rigoureuse. On peut done dire qu'apres le mois de juin 1900,
toutes les phrases grecques Ecrites par Mme X. sont des phrases
du dictionnaire grec susdit.
J'ai de"ja dit que je me refusais, pour des raisons morales,
qui me paraissent primordiales, a admettre 1'hypothese d'une
fraudf-. Mais laissons de cuu- les raisons morales, si puis-
santes a mes yeux. II est des raisons materielles, aussi
puissantes, qui concourent a rendre cette hypothese absurde.
(1) II est mate"riellement impossible, e"tant donne"es nos
connaissauces actuelles sur les limites de la me"moire humaine,
qu'il y ait une transcription exacte et complete, en une langue
inconnue, de toute une se"rie de phrases, avec ponctuation,
points et accents, comme pour les phrases, ix, x, xi, xii, xiii,
xiv, xv, qui ont e^e" e"crites devant moi, dans 1'espace d'une
henre a peine.
Cela est d'autant plus impossible qu'il s'agit d'une trans
cription visuelle, puisqu'il y a SfM\oVs pour o/wXouv ; o-oXio-/uui5y
pour a-ro\ta-ftovy ; irapoStp pour irapoSw ; ce serait done une
transcription sans nulle lecture prealable, puisque la lecture
aurait donne oiau\ow, arro\iarfJLOvii, et irapoSw. Par consequent
c'est une transcription de signes n'ayant aucun sens, puisque
aussi bien la terminologie grecque restait ignoree
182 Professor Charles Richet. [part
J'ai fait le compte, par curiosité, des lettres et accents
grecs ainsi écrits sous mes yeux, eu conformité avec les phrases
du dictionnaire. Le nombre en est de 622 (phrases ix à xv).
Les erreurs ou omissions sont au nombre de 42 ; cela fait
donc une proportion de 6,7 pour cent d'omissions ou d'erreurs.
Ainsi, 622 signes ont été écrits, avec seulement 6 pour cent
d'erreurs.
A ces 622 signes il faut en ajouter 913 qui sont dans la
lettre qui m'a été envoyée, écrite, ainsi qu'il m'a été dit,
dans les mêmes conditions; au total 1535 signes, écrits de
mémoire, sans compréhension du texte.
Supposer qu'une mémoire humaine ait cette puissance, c'est
dépasser les limites de l'invraisemblable.
('2) Voici une seconde démonstration plus nette encore. La
phrase du début " Xpijo-dai," etc. (viiiA), n'est pas donnée en
français dans le dictionnaire grec de Byzantios. Elle est
seulement donnée en latin, et dans le latin de Cicéron, assez
difficile à comprendre, quand on n'a pas fait l'étude spéciale
du latin.
Je mets en fait qu'une personne qui ne sait pas très bien
le latin ne pourra pas comprendre ces mots: Graecis licet utare,
cum voles, si te latinae forte deficiant. On arriverait donc à
cette absurdité que Mme X., tout en ne connaissant pas le
grec, connaît le latin, puisqu'elle a employé pour dire ce
qu'elle voulait dire une phrase grecque (qu'elle ne comprenait
pas), traduite d'une phrase latine (qu'elle ne pouvait pas com
prendre davantage). Il y a là une seconde manifeste absurdité.
(3) Le fait que la phrase ix a été écrite devant moi,
avec autant de perfection dans la transcription que les phrases
viii A., B., et D. rend extrêmement vraisemblable que ces
phrases ont été écrites dans les mêmes conditions que la phrase
ix. Les modalités de l'écriture sont identiques. Ainsi par
exemple le mot fiucpo-v pour nucpôv. La proportion des accents
est à peu près la même; dans un rapport de 66 pour cent
pour les phrases écrites en mon absence ; tandis que dans les
phrases écrites devant moi, le rapport a été de 86 pour cent.
Les accents ont donc été bien plus correctement et complète
ment mis dans les phrases écrites sous mes yeux que dans
les phrases écrites en mon absence.
Donc toutes les citations de la traduction de Bernardin
Li.] Xénoglossie. 183
de Saint-Pierre, et de la traduction d'Eugène Sue, ont été
données dans les mêmes conditions que la phrase ix, récem
ment écrite devant moi.
(4) Dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios, il y a un dictionnaire
français-grec et un dictionnaire grec-français. Or toutes les
phrases que je viens de citer sont puisées dans le diction
naire grec-français ; autrement dit, dans un dictionnaire dont
on ne peut se servir qu'en connaissant le grec, pour
traduire du grec en français. Car, si l'on veut traduire du
français en grec, on ne trouve dans ce dictionnaire que
le mot seul, sans qu'il soit accompagné d'une phrase
détaillée ou explicative ; de sorte que, pour exprimer une
idée (pour faire, autrement dit, un thème grec, ce qui serait
le cas), ce lexique très abrégé ne donne aucune des phrases
susdites. Donc il faut savoir le grec pour employer l'autre
dictionnaire grec-français ; autrement dit, le dictionnaire est
fait pour la version grecque et non pour le tMme grec. Cette
remarque est d'une importance majeure ; car on comprend
mal que ce qu'on veut dire puisse être dit, uniquement à
l'aide d'un dictionnaire fait pour la version. Par exemple,
supposons un écolier qui veuille dire : " L'écriture ressemble à
l'original," ou : " La copie est comme le livre " ; il trouvera à
écriture ypacp^ ; ypa(pta/xov ; à manuscrit xeipôypacpoç ; à copie
àirrlypa<pov, Ùiro/xifxtj/xa ; d'autre part à ressembler il lira
oXXaÇw ; à semblable S/xoioç, irapàfioioç ; et à impression
TVirwaiç ; à livre /3!/3Xiot> ; à original irpayroTviroç. De sorte
qu'il y aura sept à huit phrases possibles. Or justement la
phrase qui a été écrite est identique à celle qui se trouve à
SfJMioç (du dictionnaire grec-français). Il faudrait donc sup
poser, ce qui est absurde, que ce thème grec a été fait avec
un dictionnaire qui sert à des versions, et qui ne peut être
utile qu'à une personne sachant déjà le grec.
Pour toutes ces raisons d'ordre , technique, qui sont - décisives,
et qui, je le répète, ont tout autant de force que les raisons
d'ordre moral, je considère l'hypothèse d'une fraude, savante,
compliquée, prolongée, impliquant l'achat, la possession et la
méditation à diverses reprises, pendant près de six ans, du
livre de Byzantios, comme ridiculement absurde.
L'absurdité devient plus éclatante encore, si. l'on songe que
l'emploi du dictionnaire de Byzantios ne suffirait pas. Il
184 Professor Charles Richet. [part
faudrait y joindre Platon, avec l'Apologie de Socrate et le
Phèdre. On verra à l'appendice qu'il faudrait aussi supposer
le Nouveau Testament. Du moment que l'hypothèse d'une
fraude serait admise, on ne voit pas pourquoi Mme X. se serait
arrêtée en chemin. Si sa mémoire est aussi extraordinaire,
elle eût pu chaque jour me donner des citations des auteurs
les plus divers. Et il n'y a rien eu pendant quatre ans.
Que l'on nie permette ici une courte digression.
Trop souvent, lorsque l'on est en présence de faits qu'on
ne peut pas expliquer, on est tenté de les résoudre par un
simple soupçon que rien ne vient appuyer. Quelle que soit
l'honorabilité des personnes en jeu, on n'en tient plus aucun
compte. On résout tout d'un mot bref, qui explique sans
commentaires et sans preuves. On oublie que, si la mauvaise
foi est facile à établir, il est impossible de prouver la bonne
foi. Je ne sais plus qui disait jadis: "Si l'on m'accusait d'avoir
mis dans ma poche les tours de Notre-Dame de Paris, je
commencerais par me mettre à l'abri des poursuites." En
réalité, dans l'espèce, l'hypothèse d'une fraude est tout aussi
absurde que celle du vol des tours de Notre-Dame. Et il n'y
a d'autre raison pour croire à la supercherie que l'impossibilité
d'admettre un phénomène que nous ne comprenons pas ! Comme
si nous comprenions tout ce qui est dans la Nature ! Hélas !
En réalité, nous n'en avons aucune notion, même approchée.
Parler de fraude parce qu'on ne comprend pas; c'est aussi
déraisonnable que l'exclamation d'un excellent homme, acadé
micien respectable, qui, lorsqu'on vint lui montrer en 1879
le premier phonographe, déclara que c'était de la ventriloquie.
// ne comprenait pas ; et, pour ne pas admettre un phénomène
qui lui était incompris, il supposait la fraude, ce qui le dispensait
de tout effort d'intelligence.
Nous arrivons maintenant aux deux autres hypothèses,
lesquelles, je dois le dire, me paraissent tout aussi in
acceptables.
(2) L'hypothèse de la mémoire inconsciente doit être examinée
de près.
Ici en effet il n'est plus question de fraude. Car cette
hypothèse suppose que le livre en question a été vu en passant,
pour ainsi dire, pour quelques instants seulement, puisqu'il a
été oublié, et que ce souvenir s'est gravé dans la mémoire
Li.] Xénoglossie. 185
inconsciente (le subliminal self) sans que la personnalité con
sciente, réfléchie, en ait connaissance.
De tels exemples ne sont pas rares, et dans l'étude de
l'hypnotisme, on en a signalé de remarquables. Mais nous
ne croyons pas qu'il puisse en être question ici pour diverses
raisons.
Je ferai remarquer d'abord que, lorsque Mme X. donnait les
écritures en question, elle n'était nullement en état d'hypnose.
A.u début, dans les premières expériences, il y a eu transe véri
table; mais peu à peu les phénomènes se sont produits sans
aucune transe, avec la conservation complète de la personnalité
normale, consciente ; tout au plus un léger vague, une obnu
bilation passagère, que les moindres paroles extérieures dissipaient.
Peu importe, d'ailleurs ; car il n'est pas nécessaire de sup
poser l'état d'hypnose, latent ou manifeste, pour qu'il y ait
manifestation de la mémoire inconsciente.
La difficulté réside uniquement dans l'extension prodigieuse,
inouïe, invraisemblable, qui serait alors donnée à la mémoire
humaine.
Supposons que Mme X. ait, à l'étalage d'un bouquiniste ou
ailleurs, observé et feuilleté le livre de Byzantios, ce n'est pas
impossible, assurément, quoique peu probable. Mais ce qui
est impossible, c'est qu'elle ait inconsciemment lu au moins
cent pages de ce livre grec, de manière à avoir eu sous les
yeux au moins une fois des phrases s'appliquant aux situa
tions diverses où elle devait se trouver; car elle a écrit cette
phrase qui répond exactement à la question que je posais:
to àvTlypa<pov, etc. . . La copie est conforme à l'original. Il
est absurde d'admettre qu'en ouvrant le livre elle a eu juste
ment sous les yeux cette phrase pour se souvenir en temps
opportun et de la signification française, et de la forme typogra
phique grecque correspondante. Même cela ne suffit nullement,
car elle a encore vu bien d'autres phrases, dont elle aurait
inconsciemment retenu le sens, après en avoir lu les caractères.
Pourquoi aurait-elle dit : " Je ne sais plus l'anglais," en même
temps qu'elle écrivait ; Aév yÇéupco 'AyyXucâ, et fredonnait-elle :
Souvenez-vovÂ-en, en écrivant evduwo-ou to ? Cela supposerait
cette énorme absurdité qu'elle avait parcouru toiU le dictionnaire
(dans l'état d'inconscience), et qu'elle en avait retenu assez de
phrases pour pouvoir les appliquer aux diverses conditions en
186 Professor Charles Richet. [part
lesquelles elle allait se trouver. (Les pages, en effet, où se
trouvent les notes citées sont multiples : pages a et e de la
préface; pages 181, 139, 310, 246, 341, 313, 307, 113, 149.
Cela suppose au moins onze pages lues.)
On peut, à l'extrême rigueur, admettre qu'une lecture super
ficielle, conservée par la mémoire inconsciente, porte sur une
phrase ou deux, n'ayant pas de sens directement applicable
aux conditions présentes. Mais qu'il y ait ainsi plusieurs
phrases toutes très cohérentes, cela est vraiment absolument
impossible, et le fait de feuilleter un livre ne donne pas ces
souvenirs précis et multipliés.
Les considérations relatives à la durée doivent aussi entrer
en jeu. Car, d'une part, d'après le témoignage de Mmo X.,
si elle a eu l'occasion, très rare, et certainement accidentelle,
de feuilleter, en passant, de vieux livres, ç'a été à une époque
relativement lointaine; c'est-à-dire, seulement en 1899; et,
depuis cette époque, elle n'a certainement pas eu l'occasion
d'avoir sous les yeux un livre grec quelconque.
D'ailleurs, déjà en juin 1900, se trouvait une phrase identique
à celle qui est dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios (vi), et pro
bablement même le mot Sureyyevoç donné en novembre 1899,
mot qui n'appartient pas au grec ancien, mais au grec moderne,
indique que déjà à cette époque, il y avait une relation entre le
dictionnaire de Byzantios et l'écriture grecque de Mme X. De
sorte que, même en supposant, ce qui nous paraît inadmissible,
la mémoire inconsciente, il faudrait lui attribuer ce privilège
inouï, de persister pendant cinq ans sans aucune altération,
avec la reproduction graphique textuelle de tous les signes,
incompréhensibles, mais persistant dans la mémoire.
Enfin, la difficulté n'est pas moindre à supposer cette pro
digieuse aptitude (inconnue jusqu'à présent) de la mémoire à
retenir les moindres signes graphiques. Quelque crédit qu'on
accorde à la mémoire inconsciente, quoique l'on prétende en
faire une divinité souveraine qui peut tout, ce n'est pas une
explication rationnelle. Nous avons refusé tout à l'heure à la
mémoire consciente, réfléchie, un pareil pouvoir, ce n'est pas
pour en doter la mémoire inconsciente, non réfléchie, non voulue,
capable de beaucoup, mais incapable de fixer tous les détails
d'un tableau aussi complexe qu'une page de grec, quand chacun
des signes tracés est vide de sens, et que la langue est ignorée.
Li.] Xénoglosaie. 187
En outre, l'objection que je faisais plus haut, objection
fondamentale, d'extrême importance, qui est l'impossibilité, pour
celui qui ne connait pas le latin, de comprendre la phrase de
Cicéron : Graecis licet utare, cum voles, si te latinae forte depciant,
subsiste tout entière, aussi bien pour la mémoire inconsciente
que pour la mémoire réfléchie.
Nous pouvons donc résolument conclure que le fait d'écrire
ainsi, avec une exactitude graphique presque parfaite, de longues
phrases grecques, alors qu'on ignore le grec, est, dans l'état
actuel de la psychologie, absolument inexplicable, et que c'est
une tentative désespérée, pour échapper à l'inexplicable, que de
se réfugier dans l'hypothèse d'une mémoire prodigieuse.
Car jusqu'à présent, en fait de mémoire, on n'a jamais rien
vu d'analogue. Quand les calculateurs prodiges déroulent au
bout d'un quart d'heure les nombreuses séries de chiffres qu'on
a énoncés devant eux, en réalité ils parlent une langue spéciale,
qui leur est familière, et auquel un long usage, servi par un
extraordinaire appareil cérébral, les a pliés. Quand un musicien
retient toutes les parties d'orchestre d'une partition, il s'agit
encore d'une langue qu'il connaît bien. Mais ici rien de sem
blable : ce sont des signes, et rien que des signes, qui sont
reproduits avec leur délicate ponctuation dans leurs moindres
détails, et qui sont symboles d'une langue absolument incomprise.
Pourtant le fait existe. Il est indiscutable, aussi brutal
qu'un fait, et nul ne peut le nier. Il ne s'explique pas par
la mémoire. Nous venons de le prouver.
(3) Les deux hypothèses précédentes ayant été démontrées
absurdes, il est permis de recourir à une hypothèse autre. Mais
nous allons voir que l'hypothèse des esprits n'est pas davantage
recevable.
En effet, ce que nous savons ou croyons savoir sur la
réalité des esprits et sur leur puissance est tellement vague,
qu'en réalité la supposition qu'il s'agit d'esprits revient à
affirmer notre non-connaissance des choses. Les esprits sont
des IHi ex machina faciles à inventer pour suppléer à une
explication. Expliquer un phénomène incompris par des phéno
mènes plus incompréhensibles encore, c'est d'une logique très
contestable ; de même que les sauvages expliquent la grêle,
la pluie et les éclairs par l'action des génies et des diables,
de même les spirites expliquent ce qui dépasse nos connaissances
188 Professor Charles RichA. [part
humaines par des forces inconnues, imprécises, qu'ils appellent
des esprits.
Autrement dit, c'est essayer d'éclaircir l'inexpliqué au moyen
de l'inexplicable.
Cela dit, admettons un moment que la personnalité des morts
ne disparaisse pas, et qu'elle se mêle à notre vie terrestre. Dans
ce cas, la personnalité qui serait revenue serait probablement,
puisque la signature A. A. R. a été donnée, Antoine Augustin
Renouard. Mais cette supposition soulève maintes difficultés.
D'abord, Antoine Augustin Renouard n'était pas, à propre
ment parler, un helléniste. Il était imprimeur et bibliophile ;
il a imprimé Daphnis et Chloé ; mais sa connaissance du grec
n'était pas exceptionnelle, et il ne savait probablement pas le
grec moderne. Or le livre en question date de 1846. A.-A. R
est mort en 1853; et d'ailleurs depuis 1825 il avait com
plètement abandonné l'imprimerie, pour se consacrer exclusive
ment à la recherche et au culte des très vieux livres.
Je passe volontairement sous silence d'autres indications d'un
autre genre, qui sembleraient faire croire qu'il y a eu inter
vention réelle de A.-A. R., car il ne faut pas mélanger à cette
étude spéciale, envisagée au point de vue de la connaissance
des langues étrangères, les autres communications reçues, nécessi
tant, elles aussi, pour être analysées, une longue et laborieuse
discussion.
On remarquera aussi que A.-A. R. a signé Sio-eyyevoç, ce
qui ne veut pas dire arrière-grand-père mais arrière-petit-fils.
Dans le dictionnaire de Byzantios (dictionnaire français-grec),
il n'y a rien à arrière-grand-père : il y a irâiriroç à grand-père.
à bisaïeul il y a irpéirvnnroç, et Sio-eyyovoç (non Sureyyevoc)
à arrière-petit-fils.
Si les preuves sont faibles, ou pour mieux dire nulles, en
faveur de l'hypothèse qu'il s'agit de la personnalité survivante
d'A.-A. R., elles sont naturellement plus faibles encore pour
l'hypothèse de l'intervention d'une autre personnalité quelconque,
et il est inutile de s'y appesantir.
Reste encore, il est vrai, le recours à une sorte d'hypothèse
mixte, dans laquelle il y aurait eu d'une part mémoire incon
sciente, d'autre part emploi, par une intelligence étrangère, de
ces signes laissés dans la mémoire subliminale. Mais nous
Li.] Xtnoglossie. 189
nous heartens aux me'mes difficulty's que tout a 1'heure ; car
1'hypothese d'un esprit n'explique rien, et il est tout a fait
impossible, comme nous 1'avons dit, de supposer a la me"moire
inconsciente (aide"e ou non par un esprit ?) de garder cet amas
enonne de signes graphiques.
Quant a 1'hypothese d'une transmission de pense"es, si, ;'i la
rigueur extreme, on peut 1'admettre, pour les dernieres phrases
donnees, alors que j'avais deja, e"tant pres de Mme X., lu et
parcouru attentivement le dictionnaire, elle est inadmissible
pour toutes les phrases du debut, les plus nombreuses, qui
m'ont e"te" donnees, alors que j'ignorais totalement 1'existence
du livre.
Nous voici arrives au terme de cette analyse que je n'ai
pas pu rendre plus courte.
Nous avons vu qu'on peut formuler trois hypotheses, me"moire
consciente, me"moire inconsciente, influence d'un esprit ; et nous
avons montre" qu'elles sont toutes trois absurdes.
Mais, parce que les explications sont absurdes, est-ce une
raison de rejeter les faits ? Ce serait une grave erreur que de
vouloir a toute force donner aux faits qu'on ne comprend pas
une explication rationnelle. Les faits qui, dans 1'immense
Nature, depassent notre intelligence sont plus nombreux que
les autres. Avant qu'on eut connu le mouvement des astres,
pouvait-on comprendre les e"clipses ? Quelle explication pouvait
en etre fournie a ceux qui ignoraient la rotation de la lune
et de la terre autour du soleil ? Si Thales, qui a de"couvert
les prophets electriques de 1'ambre, revenait parmi nous, il ne
comprendrait rieu a la the"orie des ions. Basile Valentin, si
on lui avait parly' ex abrupto des theories de la ste>e"ochimie,
aurait a bon droit conclu a une magie quelconque. Lavoisier,
ce genial et fe"cond de"couvreur, niait qu'il existat des me"teorites,
et il etait tente" de croire au mensonge de ceux qui attirmaient
avoir vu des pierres tomber du ciel.
Or ici nous sommes en presence d'un fait certain, indeniable.
Nous ne pouvons 1'expliquer. Si nous admettons que c'est
un phenomene de me"moire, consciente ou non, nous tombous
dans une se"rie de prodigieuses invraisemblances. Nous sommes
forces de supposer a la memoire des puissances qu'elle n'a pas
de construire tout un e"chafaudage de suppositions, non con
190 Professor Charles Richet [pakt
formes aux faits, contradictoires de toute justice et de toute
vérité. N'est-il pas mieux de dire que nous sommes en
présence de l'inexpliqué ?
Et pourquoi la science aurait-elle peur de prononcer ce
mot ? Inexpliqué ne veut pas dire inexplicable On a vu
que successivement, les phénomènes ' se sont dévoilés ' en de
venant, à de longs intervalles de temps, de plus en plus nets,
sans atteindre encore le degré de précision nécessaire. Qui
sait si, en poursuivant cette étude avec patience (attendant
les phénomènes, car ils ne peuvent être provoqués), nous
n'aboutirons pas à la solution d'un problème dont j'ai posé
les termes, tout en déclarant que la solution m'en est
inconnue ?
Pour ma part, je n'ai aucune hésitation a déclarer qu'un
fait, minutieusement observé, peut demeurer inexplicable. ' C'est
un aveu que je n'hésite pas à taire, car on aurait, je peuse,
évité bien des erreurs, si l'on avait plus souvent, dans l'étude
des phénomènes de la nature, eu le courage de là modestie.
Appendice.
Cet article était écrit lorsqu'un nouveau phénomène s'est
produit. Le 26 mai, après avoir montré à Mmo X. cet article
même, comme nous avions parlé abondamment de quelques-uns
des faits qui s'y rapportaient, Mme X., dans un état de demi-
transe, écrivit devant moi les phrases suivantes que je donne
ici textuellement, dans l'ordre et la forme suivant laquelle
elles furent écrites.
Comme pour les phrases précédentes, l'écriture a été lente,
tremblée ; il semblait qu'elle fût donnée par Mme X. avec un
grand effort d'application, comme si un texte quelconque était
devant ses yeux, qu'elle cherchait à lire dans le vide. .

En faisant la même analyse technique que celle qui a été
fait plus haut, nous remarquerons la presque absolue con
formité de l'écriture donnée avec le texte grec.
Il y a eu 633 lettres, accents et points. La proportion
des erreurs y est faible. En erreurs et omissions, il n'y en a
que 54, soit à peu près 8 pour cent, ce qui est vraiment
minime.
Il s'agit presque toujours d'ailleurs soit d'accents omis, soit
d'accents mal mis, et comme fautes de texte, il n'y en a
vraiment que deux : dans la phrase 4, au lieu de èv tw ovôfmTi
nov, le t de àvô/xaTl a été omis, et il a été écrit èv tw ovô/xa i
fiov. Dans la phrase 8, il s'agit aussi d'un t qui a été omis ;
et au lieu de Iva Ttç Trjv ^vxyv, l'écriture donne tva «y Ttjv y^uy^v.
Il faut d'ailleurs faire une remarque essentielle ; c'est que,
si le texte de Byzantios est unique, et qu'il ne peut y avoir
de variantes quant aux accents et à la ponctuation, on ne peut
en dire autant de l'Evangile de saint Jean qui a eu assuré
ment de très nombreuses éditions. Mme X. dit avoir un
souvenir vague d'une édition grecque du Nouveau Testament,
assez ancienne, qui était dans sa famille. Il est à penser que
les accents ne sont pas rigoureusement identiques à ceux de
l'édition de Tauchnitz, que j'ai sous le yeux. Ce qui me fait
penser à une relation avec l'édition ancienne, c'est que toûto
est écrit t8to ; ovo/j-oti fiov est écrit àvôfiaTl fit}. D'ailleurs,
à la ligne suivante, fiov, est écrit fiov, ^v^v avTov est écrit
^u^i7i/ avTii. Plus haut, à la phrase 2, irurrevwv est écrit
iTi(evwv, ce qui semble prouver que le texte en relation avec
l'écriture est un texte d'ancienne orthographe grecque.
Le mot ovK en est écrit en deux mots à la phrase 5, et en
un mot à la phrase 6.
Le nombre des accents dans le texte grec est de 167 ;
et dans l'écriture de Mme X., pour les phrases correspondantes,
il est de 121. La proportion des omissions est donc de 27
pour cent.
Mais ce qui frappe vraiment, c'est la correction presque
absolue du texte, correction probablement bien supérieure à
celle dont seraient capables à la dictée la plupart des écoliers
de seize ans, après deux ans d'études grecques.
194 Professor Charles Richest. [part
Enfin, l'adaptation est parfaite aux idées qui veulent être
exprimées, puisque, après ces belles paroles que saint Jean
prête au Christ, il est dit: "Je ne puis en faire davantage...
J'ai achevé mon œuvre. C'est la fin." Et cela d'après un
tout autre texte, presque en une autre langue, le texte de
Byzantios et la langue Grecque texte moderne.
Il est inutile d'insister sur la variété des phrases grecques
données ainsi. Nous avons en effet, non seulement des phrases
du dictionnaire de Byzantios (Préface, Dédicace, Lexique), mais
encore des citations de Platon (Apologie de Socrate et Phèdre),
et de longues citations de l'Evangile de saint Jean. En
somme, il s'agit là de quatre ouvrages absolument différents, et
toujours la phrase donnée, ainsi que je l'ai dit à maintes
reprises, s'adapte admirablement aux conditions présentes.
Peut-être de nouveaux phénomènes se produiront-ils, pour
confirmer ces premières données, dont l'explication me paraît
aujourd'hui non pas difficile, mais impossible. Cependant,
ainsi que je le disais plus haut, l'absence d'explication
plausible ne doit pas nous faire passer sous silence un fait
rigoureusement établi.

III.
DISCUSSION OF PROFESSOR RICHET'S CASE OF
AUTOMATIC WRITING IN A LANGUAGE
UNKNOWN TO THE WRITER.
I.
BY SIR OLIVER LODGE.
I HAVE been interested in Professor Richet's paper on what
he calls Xenoglossy, and have had an opportunity of dis
cussing some of the details with him, and of gathering some
first-hand information as to its mode of occurrence.
I think it may be of some assistance if I comment on
the subject, and especially if I arrange the events in an order
more chronological than that in which he found it convenient
to describe them.
I must premise that the lady whom he calls Mme. X.
is to be thought of as one who distinctly possesses the usual,
or perhaps unusual, occult powers ; that is to say, the fact
of automatic writing, or of crystal vision, or other modes of f
automatism and response to suggestion, however that suggestion
originates, may be regarded as the expected in her case.
One of the most striking proofs of her possession of definite
power in this direction is that related by Professor Richet in
the Annals of Psychical Science, Vol. I., p. 130, February, 1905,
under the heading, " A Singular Case of Lucidity." The episode
there related cannot possibly be accounted for by fraud of
any kind : it must be due either to chance or to lucidity,
and my impression is that any one who studies it will
end by deciding that the hypothesis of chance has to be
rejected. On that occasion however other people were present,
196 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART
so it is just possible that the lucidity displayed did not
belong to Mme. X. But that is rather a forced hypothesis,
since a number of instances of ostensibly clairvoyant faculty
on the part of Madame X. when acting alone are known
to Professor Richet.
But because a medium possesses genuine power it does not
follow, as we know well, that that power may not occasionally
be eked out by something which may legitimately be called
' fraud,'—though this name is far too general and indiscriminate
to be usefully applied to all the many gradations of conscious
or subconscious or unconscious ingenuity, by means of which
normal or accustomed processes are made to do duty for the
unusual and unaccustomed processes which we are desirous of
investigating.
Accordingly this case of Xenoglossy must be studied in a
fully critical manner, and the only use that can be made of
the medium's known powers is to help towards an explanation
of the mode in which the phenomenon in question might occur,
if the fact of the phenomenon is first rigorously established.
The admitted existence of some power has one useful consequence,
in that it enables one to speak of ' visions,' and of ostensible
' control ' such as that exercised by a secondary personality or
otherwise, without circumlocution or difficulty.
With this prelude I will give a short account or summary
of the occurrences connected with the writings, as testified to
by Professor Richet ; it being understood that I am only going
over them for convenience, and that I am not giving evidence
in the case.
It appears that in November, 1899, Mme. X. had a 'vision'
of a clean-shaven old man who subsequently often appeared
to her, and who later gave his name as A. A. R., or sometimes
in full as Antoine Augustin Renouard—the name of Professor
Richet's maternal great-grandfather—concerning whom parti
culars will be found in Professor Richet's paper. He seems to
have been a more or less learned bibliophile, but not in any
special sense a scholar. With this vision she at once began
to associate the idea of the Greek language—a vague notion
which interpreted itself in her waking state as a sort of desire
to learn Greek. She accordingly applied to a lady friend for
some elementary Greek text-books, and two second-hand soiled
LI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 197
school books were bought and given her. The desire, how
ever, seems only to have been momentary, for it appears that
the books were not utilised, but were simply stowed away.
About that same time, viz. on November 7th, in the presence
of Professor Richet and Mr. Piddington (neither of whom
then really knew Mme. X.), at an interview arranged for
by Mr. Myers, she went into a trance and, with her
eyes closed, wrote in pencil her first Greek sentence, which,
as a matter of fact, consisted of two fairly simple phrases
run together. The meaning was obvious, but the source of
the two was unknown, (i.)
Later in the same month, in the presence of Professor
Richet, Mme. X., again in a state of trance, wrote a Greek
sentence which means that the name of the control is
Antoine (or Antonine) Renouard. (ii.)
In the same and following month a few other short sen
tences were written (iii and iv), and in the summer of 1900
a longer one, which was unintelligible at the time, even
to so ingenious a Greek scholar as Mr. Myers, (v.)
Some of the phrases, like (vi), are in Modern Greek, and
these are usually colloquial, often referring to the control ;
other phrases are in Classical Greek, and these appear to
contain general sentiments or dignified propositions. But in
both cases the writing was nearly without accents, and with
several errors such as might be made by an ignorant but
very painstaking copyist who had writing given him which
he was to imitate without understanding. It seems to me
probable, however, that such a copyist, unless extraordinarily
careful, would be likely to make more errors than actually
were made. To test this I asked my amanuensis, Mr. Briscoe,
to copy a few lines of Greek from the bottom of page 346
of Vol. I. of the Annals of Psychical Science. I took the paper
away before he had finished, so as to give no time for revision,
thus imitating the circumstance of the automatic writing with
fair closeness. The errors are few, but they seem to me of
the same general character as those in the automatic scripts ;
and perhaps Mrs. Verrall, to whom I sent this short piece of
writing, will include it in her detailed analysis.
So far, all the phrases were written by Mme. X. in Professor
Richet's presence, and no source was known for any of
198 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART
them ; that is to say, they all might have been original.
Those given in June, 1900, had no signature attached to
them.
Nothing more is reported until the Spring of 1904, when
a Modern Greek sentence was partly written and partly given
by raps (vii) ; and, in the Autumn of that same year, very
long and complicated paragraphs in Modern Greek were
written by Mme. X. in Paris, and sent to Professor Richet
at Carqueiranne, with a letter accompanying them saying :
" I have seen nothing but Greek, and Greek, and finally
my hand had to write this nonsense which I send you
before I could set about my work. My hand was in a state
of amnesia [meaning anaesthesia] for a long time afterwards.
... I hope now to be all right again. . . . How absurd !
My hand seems to play me false again. You have no idea
how curious this sensation is ; I struggle against something as
though in a dream ; everything seems far away. ... I do
not know who will win."
These paragraphs (viii), transmitted by post, which it may be
supposed were written more at leisure, contain errors of the
same kind as those written under supervision, and, what is
noteworthy, contain errors in about the same proportion and
of about the same kind ; but they include accents, which the
previous sentences did not. These long and complicated para
graphs, which were very difficult to translate, happened to put
Professor Richet on the right scent as to source, in a manner
which he describes in his paper. Briefly thus :—A quotation
in Littre"'s French Dictionary indicated that the meaning of
one of these sentences occurred in Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's
book Paul et Virginie. It looked therefore as if it were taken
from a Modern Greek translation of this book, but no such trans
lation was known ; so Professor Richet wrote to Dr. Vlavianos,
of Athens, asking him if there were such a thing, at the same
time explaining the reason of the request by sending the Greek
sentences. Dr. Vlavianos replied in the negative, but said that
he had found the sentences in the Preface to a dictionary,
ihed about 60 years ago, for use by Greek students
ing French. It appears that in this Preface the author
Titios), anxious to demonstrate the adaptability of Modern
proceeded to translate some complicated descriptive out
LI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 199
of-the-way French into his own language. In accordance with
this plan he chose sentences from Paul et Virginie and from
Eugene Sue's Mystbres de Paris. These are the sentences which,
with a few alterations, such as putting FuXXia instead of
'EXAay, were written by the automatist. This dictionary, we
are told by Prof. Richet, exists in the National Library of Paris ;
and the leaves of its Greek-French portion are cut.
In April Professor Richet informed Mme. X. of his
discovery, but did not show her the book. On May 2nd he
went to see her and told her of his intention to take the
Byzantios Dictionary with him when he went to London to
read his paper to the S.P.R. While he was telling her this,
she began to go into a trance again, said she " felt unable to
speak English, and saw Greek characters all around " ; then
in a state of semi-consciousness she took up a pen and,
standing beside him, wrote a long Greek phrase in a blank
note-book, writing it slowly as if she were copying something
held up in front of her eyes, while in reality she was looking
into space, and writing slowly and painfully. This paragraph,
so written, contains the same kind of errors as before—
practically no more and no less—it exhibits complete ignorance
of the language on the part of the writer ; and it also was
found in the Preface to the same dictionary, being in fact
the commencement of a quotation from Eugene Sue, a later
portion of which had already been given, (ix.)
Professor Richet then asked her thus semi-entranced to give
an explanation of the paragraph written; this she did not do,1
but wrote instead in Modern Greek, the following sentences
<x-xv) :
" Just at present I do not know English."
" The copy agrees with the original."
" I have my instructions from which it is impossible for
me to depart."
"These notes will make the volume still larger."—A. A. B.
And, a little later, she further wrote in modern Greek :
" This war interests the whole of Europe,"
[they had been mentioning the Russo-Japanese war] and
1 In Byzantios' Dictionary, the translation is opposite the text, so that, had
she got the thing up, Mme. X. could have answered his question.
200 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART
" Souvenez-vous en,"
[a song she had been humming].
But the strange thing is that all these phrases, too, are to
be found in the Greek-French Dictionary, scattered about at
different places ; not in the Preface, but as specimen phrases
illustrative of certain words. In these latter cases of writing
many of the accents were inserted : in fact nearly all of them.
The errors are few, but again they are those of a very careful
and competent copyist who did not know the language.
A few days later, Professor Richet came to London and
gave to the S.P.R. an address on these phenomena, the
substance of which appears in the preceding paper.
The meeting in London was on May llth, and after Pro
fessor Bichet's return to Paris, while he was writing his article
on the subject, viz. on May 26th, Mme. X., with whom he
was at the moment discussing the matter, went into semi-
trance again, and once more wrote a quantity of Greek,
writing as before with difficulty, and exactly as if she were
trying to decipher something held up before her eyes in
space. (See Appendix to Prof. Richet's paper.) This was
neither Classical nor Modern Greek, but proved to be a
collection of extracts from the Gospel of St. John, concluding
with the text, " But now I go my way to him that sent
me." These extracts were supplemented by a few sentences
in Modern Greek which mean :
"I can do no more."
" Have finished work."
"The End."
This writing is signed " Byzantios A. A. 11."—that is to
say, it is signed with the old signature A. A. B,, as many
times previously, but with the word " Byzantios " prefixed,
Byzantios being the name of the author of the now known
Greek-French Dictionary.
This new signature indicates that the automatist accepted
the now recognised source of the majority of the quotations.
Since then no more of this phenomenon has occurred. But
in June, 1905, Mr. Shipley, who had become interested in
the case, set himself to ascertain the sources of the Classical
Greek also. He found that each part of the double sentence
u.] D-iscussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 201
first written (i) occurred in separate passages of Plato's " Apology,"
the second half being a not inappropriate farewell sentence.
The next and more unintelligible classical phrase (ii) he found
(without the errors and verbal repetitions of course) in the
"Phaedrus," though, as it is not of a simple character, the
mistakes made by the copyist had rendered it unintelligible,
so that for all these years it had been considered only gib
berish. The concluding word of this writing is not in the
" Phaedrus," but is a Modern Greek salutation apparently added
as an adieu.
For a full discussion of the whole matter, and especially
for the kind of explanations that may or may not be reasonably
suggested, readers must study Professor Richet's paper ; and
likewise Mrs. Verral1's future comments thereon, which I am
told she is preparing.
In writing the above I have not seen this paper of Mrs.
Verral1's, because I thought it best to make my statement
independently. The explanation, in so far as it can be
called an explanation, which seems to me the only feasible
hypothesis, short of conscious and deliberate deception, is that
the entranced or semi-entranced medium sees in a vision certain
writing which she proceeds to copy; being influenced thereto
by some control, the nature of which is unknown to me.
The fact that the writing thus produced already exists in
type is of course an extremely suspicious circumstance, but if for
a moment we may make a rather wild hypothesis and assume
an intelligent control distinct from the medium's normal intelli
gence, who wished to give, as a test-phenomenon, something
markedly attractive and attention-compelling—who wished to
give, in fact, a foreign language which he himself knew, but
which the medium did not know—I ask myself, and I ask the
reader, to consider how either of us, placed in these imaginary
circumstances, would proceed.
When it is a case of conveying ideas, by some process
which we call telepathic, the ideas themselves must be thoiuIht,
and in some approximately corresponding form can perhaps
then be reproduced by the medium ; but if it were our object
to convey a foreign language, this method would be useless :
the ideas would merely reproduce themselves in a language
known to the medium. Consider therefore what method is
202 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART
available for the purpose. One plan would be to get somebody
present to call over the foreign alphabet, letter by letter, and
then by some means to give a signal at the right letter. This
is a well-known tedious process, which on one occasion, in
connection with script No. vii, seems to have been actually
made use of in this case. How else could a foreign language
be conveyed ? By speaking it slowly and distinctly ? That
would do, if the medium were intended or disposed to give
verbal utterance to what we said. But by hypothesis she is
an automatic writer, and has to write it down, not speak it.
What must we do then ? What could possibly be done except
hold up a text, either to her physical or to her mental eyes,
and constrain her to copy it letter by letter ? In other words,
we should have to influence her subconsciousness in the same
sort of way as the subconsciousness of a crystal gazer is influ
enced, one letter or one word being displayed or called up at
a time. Why it should be easier thus to convey an impression
of words when the said words are already actually written or
printed is not in the least clear to me ; but our experience in
an increasing number of cases tends to show that it is so, and
that the fact of a document being in the neighbourhood of a
clairvoyant renders the perception of the meaning contained in
that document an easier matter than it otherwise would be—
a circumstance manifestly inconvenient from the point of view
of trustworthy evidence, and open to sinister interpretation. So
if we further asked what text we should employ, it would not
be surprising if the- answer had to be, something already written
or in type. I see no other way of getting anything to copy
unless the control had the power of direct writing first. As
a text, the New Testament would naturally occur to one, but
it might be rejected in the first instance as too obvious and
easily accessible. Some classical author would next occur ; not
perhaps the too well known Republic, but some dialogue of
Plato might very likely suggest itself. A still better choice,
however, would be to employ some out-of-the-way book, such
as could hardly be accessible ; and if the text thus selected
were of an extraordinary and out-of-the-way kind, only
intelligible with considerable difficulty, and the source of it
t likely to be detected until after the lapse of a year or
, it would seem to us, I think—at any rate I think it
LI.] Discussion of Professor Ricket's Case of Xenoglossy. 203
might easily seem to me, under those hypothetical and out
landish conditions—to be an extra good proof of supernormal
occurrence
In this way I have endeavoured to give to the ostensible
and superficial appearance of the phenomenon the most favour
able chance of consideration possible, because it is eminently
desirable to look at the matter from all sides, if a supernormal
hypothesis is to be tentatively admitted at all. A working
hypothesis of this sort seems to me the only one which satisfies
the demand for a rational grasp of what occurred, short of
cheating. Admittedly the circumstances would seem puzzling
when the sources of the original text was discovered, and the
critics of the writing would go through much the same sort
of self-questioning and doubt of the medium's honesty as
they are going through now in this particular instance. Still
I think it must be regarded as not an impossible thing to
happen, given the possibility of anything akin to crystal-vision
pictures in the form of letters and words, which indeed we
know to occur ; and for myself I am not disposed altogether
to scoff even at the idea of some action or activity on the
part of some intelligence, calling himself A.A.R.—a personality
analogous to that of " Phinuit," for instance,—for I gather that
this personality has incidentally endeavoured to give proof of
identity to Professor Richet, and has succeeded in showing such
knowledge of family affairs as would to some more credulous
persons constitute a substantial proof of identity. But Professor
Richet is not convinced, and he is the best judge concerning
A.A.I.*. All that, however, is not a matter on which I wish
to express an opinion ; for one thing I have not the data
before me. Nor do I see that it much matters for the present
problem. All that I claim is that the ostensible and apparent
explanation of the phenomenon as due to an intelligent control
—subliminal or other—is not absurd, on our present knowledge,
but on the whole is the only reasonable explanation that can
be offered, provided deliberate fraud be considered out of the
question. On the whole I am inclined to reject the hypothesis
of fraudulent knowledge of Greek, coupled with considerable
memory, and the still more difficult hypothesis of abnormal
memory of form alone without any knowledge of substance.
Undoubtedly the normal hypothesis of the fraudulent cultiva-
204 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART
tion and utilisation of ordinary memory must be faced, and
some experiments carried out recently at my request by
Professor Sonnenschein, on the recollection of persons who,
knowing no Greek, had practised copying, recollecting, and after
some delay reproducing, a phrase or two in Greek writing, are
distinctly striking. I am sending the result of these experi
ments, as so far conducted, to Mrs. Verrall, who will, I hope,
refer to them in her report. But in spite of these interesting
experiments, I doubt if the script of Madame X. represents a
case of memory at all ; it seems to me more like a case of
copying—of copying something either actually before her, which
Professor Richet's evidence appears to negative, or else of type
mentally seen in a manner something analogous to a crystal
vision— where the thing seen is vivid enough to be drawn
or written down, without necessarily any understanding at
the time.

II.
BY MRS. A. W. VERRALL.
THE paper by Professor Richet on a case of Xenoglossy which
has recently come under his personal observation is of extreme
interest, and well worthy of study, whatever hypothesis is
ultimately accepted as to its cause.
For the convenience of readers, I preface my discussion of
it with a list arranged in chronological order of the items in
the automatic writing,—giving an English translation, where
necessary, and the source of each piece, so far as this has
been traced,—and the principal external events of the case.

Professor Richet discusses three possible explanations of the
case—(1) fraud, (2) unconscious memory of what has been
seen but not understood, (3) action of a discarnate spirit—and
dismisses them all as " equally absurd and impossible." The
objections urged by him to the two latter theories appear to
me conclusive ; the first it is obviously our duty to examine
carefully before considering any other hypothesis. By the
kindness of Professor Richet and Madame X., I have been able
to see the greater part of the original automatic writings, and
the copy of the second edition of the Dictionary of Byzantios,
which, as the reader will remember, contains many of the
passages given in the script. I have made a detailed ex-
•Mnination of the automatic writing, including the mistakes

which occur in it. Headers unfamiliar with Greek, and un
acquainted with the original script, may be helped towards a
solution of the problem set to us by our President, by reading
the observations and comments of one who has some experi
ence both of Greek texts and of automatic writing.
I have in this paper confined myself to the consideration
of what conclusions, if any, may be drawn from an examination
of the writings themselves, and a comparison between them
and the printed matter which is their undisputed source ; that
is, I have endeavoured to form an opinion on the internal
evidence alone, disregarding all external reasons for attaching
value to the documents, and proceeding as though the script
and the printed matter which it reproduces had been deposited,
like a foundling on the doorstep, with no claim to attention
but what it could itself convey. Professor Richet, a knowledge
of whose paper is pre-supposed on the part of my readers, has
explained the conditions under which the writing was obtained,
and the steps by which many of the passages in the script
were traced to their original source. The copy of the
Dictionary of Byzantios sent to him from Athens and seen
by me is of the second edition1; a copy of the first
edition is in the Bibliotheque Natiouale in Paris. The Dic
tionary consists of two parts ; in the Greek-French, after
each Greek word (printed in capital letters) is given the
French equivalent, followed by a selection of phrases (in small
Greek letters) and their translations ; the French-Greek part
consists of a vocabulary only, with no phrases. The phrases
introduced into the script from the Dictionary come from the
Greek-French part, except in one case2 where the script
gives consecutively two equivalent Greek expressions which
only appear in juxtaposition in the French-Greek part of the
Dictionary. Professor Richet has pointed out that where the
editions differ it is the first and not the second edition of
the work that is followed by the script. He informs us that
in the copy of the first edition in the Paris Library the leaves
of the French-Greek part are uncut.
It will -be necessary, at the risk of wearying the reader
with minutiae, to begin with a detailed commentary on the
actual writings. These consist, as shown above, of a series of

and out of the presence of Professor Richet, by a friend of
his whom he designates as Madame X. The earlier passages
are numbered i to xv in his article ; a supplementary series,
produced after the reading of his paper on May 11th, 1905,
and described in his Appendix, is numbered 1-12. I shall
keep the notation used by him, referring to the pieces of script 1
as i, ii, . . . xv, 1, 2 . . . 12.
The number of pieces of script is 31 (counting viii A, B, c, D
and ixa, b separately). Of these I have seen 23, namely
all the writing after vii, except the short sentence numbered
xv. These 23 constitute far the greater part of the script,
and contain more than 300 words. The number of words
in the earlier writings, not at present accessible to me, is 88.
My comment on the appearance of the script and its
textual errors is confined to the 23 originals which I have
examined ; in discussing questions connected with the source
and appropriateness of the extracts, I have included the
whole 31.
GENERAL REMARKS ON THE SCRIPT; ITS APPEARANCE AND FORM.
Though there is considerable variety in the general aspect
of the writings produced at different times, there is, I think,
no such difference as would lead one, in the absence of evidence
to the contrary, to suppose them to be the work of different
writers. Certain letters (a, e, r and others) are formed in
the same way throughout the script.
The chief differences among the pieces are as follows :
viii A appears to have been written with rather less
hesitation than the rest of the script ;
viiiB is remarkably deficient in accents and breathings,
and some of its letters are slightly decorative in character ;
viii D is the most cultivated hand ; very few accents or
breathings are omitted ;
Appendix, 1-12, has a different K, and is perhaps slightly
more fluent than the scripts viii B and ix to xiv. It con
tains a considerable number of strokes ', representing either

accents or breathings,1—though these also occur, but rarely, in
viii A and xi;
FORMS FOUND IN SCRIPT.
Letters, a. Throughout the Roman form of this letter is used ;
not a but a.
ft. Two forms of this are used ; /8 at the beginning of a word,
€ in the middle. Byzantios' Dictionary2 uses both forms in the
same way.8
•y. The letter somewhat resembles a y, being made not y but y ;
the Dictionary has the usual y.
3. Nothing to note.
e. The form used is not e but e, as in the Dictionary.
£. Professor Richet 4 thinks this letter does not occur in
viii A, but I take the shape g in arXd^a to be a roughly
formed £ not an y, as the top rises 5 above the line. There is
a well formed £ in viiiD, and another, though not quite so
clear, in 2.
ri- The right-hand stroke of this letter is apt to be short, so
that the letter sometimes resembles a Roman n. The Dictionary
.. is normal.
6. Nothing to note.
i. This letter is occasionally difficult to distinguish from v ;
see 1 and 2 and especially -irua-revo-rfre. In ix on four
occasions and once in viiin, where there should be an
accented iota (/), there appears a dotted i, but as the dot also
appears over an a it is probably an incomplete accent, and
not a confusion with the Roman i. In viii c a dot appears
over an unaccented i.
K. In the earlier writings this letter is represented by two
short crossed lines x ; in the Dictionary it appears x which to
any one not knowing Greek is more suggestive of x, than of
k. Written thus, x, with two cross strokes, the letter is liable

In the Appendix2 the k is throughout normal and unmis-
takeable.
X. Nothing to note.
/x. This letter occasionally has the left stroke so short as
to resemble the Roman u, e.g. twice in ix. ; note that in
fiapudpov there is hardly any distinction between fourth and
last letter.
v. This letter is normal for the most part, but peculiarly

probably been called to the similarity between the letters x and x in •l•"
script ; it is noted in Professor Richet's paper. It would be interesting to
ascertain the shape of the kappa in the copy of the New Testament which
(see Professor Richet's article) was accessible to Madame X. Probably it was
not of the somewhat unusual form of the Dictionary kappa.

occurs only in viii B, and there invariably.

o. Nothing to note.
•a-. Normal for the most part, but slightly more ornate iu
viii B (twice).
p. Normal, but slightly more decorative in viii B (cf. iT),
and apparently made in two parts ; otherwise, as normally,
without lifting the pen.
ir. The medial and terminal letters cr, y, are correctly
written, the medial being usually drawn from left to right ;
but once, viii c, from right to left, as is shown by the
thick down stroke.
T. The' downward stroke is curved, not straight ; not T
but T. This occurs throughout, except in Appendix 12, where
the T probably represents a capital T. Once, in viii A, the
upright stroke extends above the cross stroke, thus : t.
v. Twice, in viii A, the Roman u is written for u, otherwise
the form is normal.
9. Normally this is clear, but in viii D it is to a casual
glance not easy to distinguish from \p-. There is, however, no
real confusion ; psi is written in two strokes (f) ; and phi in
one stroke <p.

MISTAKES.
As any classification of mistakes involves assumptions as
to their cause, I begin by enumerating them with comments
in chronological sequence.
Mistakes1 in letters or words.
viii A. (1) Impossible accent: 'E^eruXj^av for e^erv\t^av.
(2) Wrong breathing : arXa^ta. The breathing is slightly
reversed. But there is a smooth breathing under the T, thus :
this may be a correction. On the other hand, in the Dictionary
though not in the script, immediately under the T of
is the smooth breathing of the a of ainrpa ; thus :
So the T, may be a visual and unintelligent error;2 in that
case the smooth breathing of ainrpa appears twice in the
script, as it is also represented by one of the double strokes
on aa-irpa (sic).
(3) x for K in wxi/a. See under K.
(4) £ for £ in ireptfyaijLara. See Professor Richet's comment,
p. 171 and also under £.
1The mistakes are numbered in chronological sequence for convenience of
reference.
*See, however, Note at end of paper.
218 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part
There seem to be two corrections : in TeXevTaTov the v is
written over what might be either a badly made v or a v ;
and the S of MaJa- has a superfluous stroke suggesting that
it began as an o-: but neither of these points is certain.
There is an acute accent at the end of a line, Se, possibly
suggesting intelligence,1 if it is intentional, but the direction
of the slope of accents is not to be counted on (see p. 223).
viii b. (5) v for v in <i<p' on which appears acp'ov.
(6) x f°r K> m evxXeiaç. Note that the k is given earlier
in the passage, in the same word evicXetj. See note on *;
the two letters are so much alike in the script that this may
be a mere slip.
viii c. (7) x f°r K m koitoç. See above. But here the
X ia unmistakeable ; it is not a lengthened x, though it may
represent the writer's failure to distinguish between the two
letters. But as the k appears in viii a, as a capital, it
would appear either (1) that \ here is a mistake for k, or (2)
that x and x are regarded as alternative forms for the small
letter. If that is so, it is surprising that the .confusion
between the letters is not more frequent. See under k. On
the whole I regard this as an error of the same type as
No. 5.
(8) o-uyywptjo-K. This is plainly written with two gammas,
yy, instead of y\, gamma chi. Nowhere else is there con
fusion between y and x
In the Dictionary avy^wptjo-if (in Capitals) is correctly
printed in its place, and there is nothing there to refer a
reader to any other entry. Under pardon, in the French-
Greek, are the words avyyvw/xtj, o-vy^prjaiç, both rightly
spelt. But avyyvwfxtj in the Greek-French (in Capitals) is
described as equivalent to o-vyy^wprjaiç, thus spelt (in Capitals).
The mistake is not identical with that of the script, but the
occurrence of the double 77 in Dictionary and script does
not seem likely to be fortuitous.
If there is a connexion between the mistakes in Dictionary
1 I.e. some one who knew that the final accent before a stop was ' (acute)
would be more likely to reverse an accent at the end of a line than in the
middle ; out of seven cases (see p. 223), where the accent is wrongly reversed
in the script, two are at the ends of lines.
LL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 219
and in script, we must suppose that the entry under
was seen by the writer of the script ; and, if only the Greek-
French part is used, that involves a knowledge of (Greek
Capitals, as in the Greek-French part, the word (rvyxtapricm is
not found in small type. The use of both parts of the
Dictionary, to complement one another, would involve a power
of reading Greek letters, small and capital, with intelligence.
In this connexion it is curious to note in the same word
the occurrence of the dot over the unaccented i, which the
very least knowledge of Greek would show to be impossible.
viii D. The accent on ^e, before «Y is acute and not grave ;
bat see above, p. 216.
(9) There is possibly & •% for K in aypoTi-^ov, but the letter
is only slightly longer than x should be.
(10) Under the /x of Xd/inrei, which has its accent, is a
meaningless stroke thus : Xdjiirei. In the Dictionary, though
not in the script, under the M is the accent of eireira ; thus
so that the stroke may represent the accent of the word
below. See No. 2, above.1
viiic. (11) iuuKpo-v represents niKpov. See Professor Richet's
comment, p. 172. The mistake is impossible to any one with
the least knowledge of Greek.
There is another point to notice ; o- may very well be
misread for an original 6 ; but in this case the original is o.
It therefore seems as if the original word in the Dictionary,
ftiKpov, were visualised apart from its context as ntxpov,—which
is the- way the single word would be written, and might be
visualised by any one knowing Greek ;—and then fj.iKpov is, by
the visual error of a person wholly ignorant of Greek, made
into the impossible fj.iicp(rv. Here then, as in No. 8, there
seem to be two inconsistent intelligences at work.
ix a. (1 2) Omission of word. o\a TO [Swuaria] TOVTO.
(13) Wrong accent, ravra.
ix b. (14) TiaftOTta for Swfj.aria. This suggests that the

220 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
original word has been misheard; it does not seem to be
a visual error, as r and S are not alike in either print or
script. The first attempt (see Professor Richet) omitted the
word and had oXa ra rairra.
(15) raria for ravra. So it appears at first sight; but the
word may be ravra ill written. It is thus given : TJZT£<Z>
which possibly represents ravra, the top of the T having
been put too far back on the preceding letter. Note the
curved shape of the T in the script.1 If, however, we take it
to be raria, it is one of a class of errors familiar to critics of
MSS. and due to the similarity of the preceding syllable :
-/zetTta Taria would be a likely error in u copied document.
That it is not the mistake of a person ignorant of the
language, while able to read the letters and reproduce
syllables by sound, seems to be shown by the first attempt,
ix a, which gives the word TOVTO correctly (though with a
wrong accent), but commits another common copyist's error,
namely, the omission of Saifj.dria.
(16) fo\urfj.aSs for foXiov/oi/y. A mistake of the same class
as No. 11, involving complete ignorance of Greek: -oSs is an
impossible termination, whereas v, with the grave accent, is easily
taken for S by a visual error, when no Greek is known : for
? = <rr, see double letters above, p. 215.
(17) Sfu\ovs for oAu'Xouy. The same remarks apply as
above ; 6 might be taken as S by the visual error of a person
ignorant of Greek.
(18) irq\oiT\aipiKrjs for inIXoirXuem/c^y, or rather infXoirXafw^y.
This again seems to be a visual error due to a likeness between
the letters (f1 and f in the script, f being misread and repro
duced as tp. But it is possible that there is no errof here,
but only an ill-formed letter. The double letter ?, if care
lessly written, would resemble the letter found in the script,
which is not a good (p.
(19) and (20) airaaSqv2 for- cnropaSqv. There is here clearly
a for a- ; the other error is not. so clear. The symbol after ax
may be a bad op, but it looks more like a Roman a and a
stroke. If it is an error it appears to be a visual one, op

being read as at—a quite meaningless combination in Greek.
(r and a might easily be confused in a casual reading.
(21) idoiTiSos for taanriSos gives o for a-, another visual
error.
(22) 7roXi/&r7rafa for iro\vSdiravd gives o for a.
(23) and (24) avriewa for ainiTvira is curious. We have
v for v, a very common visual error, and e for T, not a likely
visual error, unless the shape of the T of the script is remem
bered; the ordinary T could hardly be read as e, but the letter
of the script could, if the top stroke were placed too low.1
In the Dictionary, the descending stroke of the T is not straight,
but has a slight curl upwards, but the letter is plain enough
in the second edition, and could not be taken for e. The first
edition should be examined. If there is no ambiguity in the
first edition,2 this error, like No. 11, suggests to me a double
process, first the visualisation of the word in written (not
printed) character, and then its unintelligent reproduction.
(25) diroKpv(pav for cnroKpvfyov gives a for o.
(26) Mowre£oi' for Movcrelov suggests (see Professor Richet,
p. 175) that i has been misread as £.
x. (27) ev irapdS(p/ for ev irapoSia is of the same type as
Nos. 11, 16, 17,—a visual error only possible to some one com
pletely ignorant of Greek, as S(p is an impossible termination.
The iota subscript in the Dictionary appears exactly in the
middle of the letter, ft), so that it might easily be read as ip.
The stroke f after the (p in the script probably represents the
comma, which in the Dictionary appears after the phrase eV
vapoSia, given under irdpoSos.
(28) irepaa-Tiicia has no iota subscript, A curious point arises
in connexion with this word and alternative explanations are
possible. Under the heading -n-epaa-TtKoy, there is no phrase
quoted in the Dictionary, and therefore nothing to show that
when the last syllable terminates in -ia it must have the
circumflex accent. To accent it thus shoWs a considerable
knowledge of Greek, which seems irreconcilable with the
writing of irapo$(p.
On the other hand, in the French-Greek Dictionary, under
1See above, under T. "There is no such ambiguity.
222 Mrs. A. W. Verrcdl. [PART
the heading Passer, occur in juxtaposition the phrases ev
irapoSia, irepaa-TtKSx;. If this part of the Dictionary is the
source for the script, we must suppose the final r to have
been omitted, and in that case the mistake shows no knowledge
of Greek.
xi. (29) TO for TO, a visual error, see No. 25, but one
hardly likely to be made by any one knowing even a word or
two of Greek.
(30) The fifth letter of avriypafyov is more like v than y,
but that may be a mere slip.
xii. No mistakes,
xiii. No mistakes.
xiv. (31) $vo(pepei for Siaipepei. This may be an error of
sight or of hearing ; the script-forms v and i are much alike, and
o and a are confused twice (see Nos. 22 and 25).
Appendix 2. (32) vijuv for ViMV may be bad writing, but
the first and last letters are exactly alike, though over the
first is what may be a rough breathing, but is more like a
dot. The third letter is probably a circumflexed iota, but it
closely resembles a T. v and v are apt to be confused.
Appendix 3. (33) iroifj.™ for iTOW/O-CO gives ft- for r\, not a
likely mistake for a person with any acquaintance with Greek.
Appendix 4. (34) There is a superfluous stroke (accent
or breathing) over TO>; there might be an explanation in the
original text of the Gospel if we had it (see above, Nos. 2,
10).
(35) The T is omitted in oVo/ia i; the accent and
breathing seem to have been interchanged, and the mark is on
n instead of the second o.
Appendix 5. (36) The breathing comes on the ft. of vfreis
the first time, but is rightly placed the second time.
Appendix 8. (37) The r is omitted before «,.
Mistakes in accents.
ides the impossible accent on e^eru\t^av (No. 1), and
correct one on ravra (No. 13) in the cancelled first
, there are no misplaced accents. In a few cases it
u] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 223
is difficult to determine whether the accent is acute or grave ;
sometimes the accent appears to be reversed, thus :
viii A. tie (end of line in script).
viii D. Se ek „
ix. ap^aiou. The accent is grave (or possibly circum
flex); the script is not clear.
xi. irptaTOTVirov.
xii. oiroids.
App. 2. a (doubtful).
5. Si
8. ^vxflv.
There are three or four occasions where the accent is rightly
reversed before an enclitic, e.g. Appendix 5, dewpeire fj.e ;
Appendix 9, 7re/u\^arra /ue. In xii., the breathing (represented
by a stroke) and the accent seem to have been transferred
one place to the right, aSuvarov for aSwarov, the accent
being, in that case, reversed.
Mistakes in breathings.
The breathings (see p. 216) being sometimes represented by
strokes ', instead of commas, ' ', it is not possible always to
•say whether they are correct. Out of 76 which can be tested,
four only are incorrect ; one in viii A ar\dQa (mistake No. 2),
and three in the Appendix, viz. (3) av, vtie, and (5) vfiiv. In
the case of initial diphthongs the breathings are invariably
placed (correctly) over the second vowel.
On two occasions in the Appendix, there appear to be
superfluous breathings ; in No. 3, we find ev 'TU>, where the
supposed rough breathing may represent the iota subscript
(counted on p. 217 as omitted), and in No. 5, we find Oewpeire,
where the double stroke over e is quite incorrect and inexplicable.
I append an analysis of the errors contained in the tran
script by Mr. Briscoe referred to by Sir Oliver Lodge (p. 197).
The passage to be copied is part of what in the script is
numbered viii A, beginning 'E^eruXj^ai/.

v for v, - - r ; - . - - once.
word omitted (KOI), - once.
accent omitted (TqV), - once.
ambiguous letter, v or v, - - •- twice.
It should be said that the accent omitted is on the last
word, and that the omission is probably due to the removal
of the document from the copyist. All other accents and
breathings are inserted, and are correct.
The extract is very short, so that inferences from internal
evidence are naturally limited and tentative. The mistakes,
as in the script, are mainly of the usual type of copyist's error,
and correctness of accentuation is present here as in the script.
But there is a marked indication here of growing familiarity
with the appearance of the original, a feature which is con
spicuously absent in the script. It is here shown in two
ways :
(1) In the passage copied the small e occurs six times; in
Mr. Briscoe's copy on the first five occasions it is written e, in
close resemblance to the letter in the printed original. But
the sixth time it appears as £. , showing that the writer has
understood what the symbol € stands for,—has, in fact, read it
as a Greek e, and is reproducing its meaning and not merely
its appearance.
(2) A careful examination shows that the letters v and v,
not distinguished at first, are gradually differentiated by the
writer. Thus there is no appreciable difference between the
fifth and last letter of 'E^fru\i^av, but the initial letter of
v(pa(ri4ara is undoubtedly v, and the third letter of KiVay pro
bably v. A judicious ambiguity is maintained in the next two
cases, SiKTviara and Xew<ca ; the v still lacks sharpness in TWV ;
but our observant and careful copyist has by now learnt the
difference between the two letters, and the last three cases,
^t/SaSuev, Karaa-rpcnTTovra, rqv, where the v is unmistakeable,
show an appreciation of the special characteristic of the letter,
entirely lacking in its first appearances.1

between Mr. Briscoe's writing and the script of Madame X., see below,

LL] Discussion of Professor Richets Case of Xenoglossy. 225
COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT PIECES OF SCRIPT.
Before discussing the nature of the mistakes and the know
ledge or ignorance of Greek indicated by them, it will be best
to consider whether the type or number of mistakes varies
in the different pieces, and, in particular, whether the writing
produced in Professor Richet's presence differs in these respects
from the writing sent to him by Madame X., as described by
him on p. 168. The four divisions of viiiA-D were thus sent
to him, while the other writings were produced in his presence.
The writing in his presence (henceforth called P), which
I have examined, consists of the passages ix-xiv and 1-12;
the other (called NP) of viii A-D. The number of words in
NP stands to the number of words in P in the ratio of 17 to
20, i.e. NP has 85 to every 100 words of p.
Leaving out of account for the present the question of the
insertion of breathings and accents, and confining ourselves
to the mistakes enumerated in the preceding list, we see that
of the total of 37, II1 are in NP and 262 in P, that is, allowing
for the difference in length between P and NP, there are nearly
twice the number of mistakes in what was produced in Professor
Richet's presence as in what was not seen by him till after
its production.3 This is a remarkable fact, and not without
suggestiveness. But other facts must be noted before we can
form a judgment. In the first place, the comparative absence
of mistakes in NP ia mainly due to the excellence of one
passage (D), which presents (see p. 212) a much more scholarly
appearance than any other passage, and contains only 3 mis
takes (or possibly 2). Excluding this, the percentage of
mistakes in NP is 10.4 The comparatively large number of
mistakes in P, 14'3 per cent., is mainly due to the number
contained in ix b ; excluding ix b, the percentage of mistakes
in p is under 9 per cent. So that, putting aside these two
passages, viii D with a percentage of 4%3, and ix b with a

3 Percentage of mistakes to words in " is 14'3 ; in NP 7'4.
4 The method of estimating frequency of error by the ratio of mistakes to
words in a given passage is only a rough one ; the length of the words is an
important element, and there are other considerations overlooked by this
method of comparison.
226 . Mrs. A. W. Verratt. [PART
percentage of 37, we have about the same proportion of mistakes
in all the rest of the passages, whether produced in Professor
Bichet's presence or not.
Two long passages were produced in Professor Richet's
presence, on May 2nd, 1905, a passage from the Dictionary
(ixb), and on May 26th, 1905, some texts from S. John's
Gospel (Appendix 1-9). Comparing these two, we find that
the percentage of mistakes to words in the latter is only 6
per cent., so that in one of the long passages in P the
number of mistakes is below the average of mistakes in NP.
The extracts from the Gospel, however, though they contain
three times as many words as the faulty passage from the
Dictionary (ix b), produced under similar conditions, would not
be cctcris paribm so difficult to commit to memory as that
passage, for the average length of the words is considerably
less, and many of the words recur.
If now we turn to the question of the insertion of accents
and breathings in these two groups, P and NP, we find results
quite unlike those obtained from a comparison of the number
of mistakes.1 Out of 274 possible accents and breathings in
T, 214 are inserted in the script, i.e. 78'1 per cent. ; in NP,
out of a possible total of 195, we have 124, i.e. 63 per cent.,
so that the reproduction of accents and breathings is decidedly
more correct in the case of those writings produced in Professor
Richet's presence than in that of those sent to him.
Nor is it possible to say that attention drawn to the ques
tion of the insertion of these symbols is a cause of the correct
ness in the P section. For the percentage in Appendix 1-12,
produced after the paper read by Professor Richet, and communi
cated to Madame X., is no higher than in the rest of section p.
The relative deficiency in NP is mainly due to the almost
complete failure in this respect of one of the pieces sent to
Professor Richet, viz. : viii B, where out of 42 possible accents
and breathings only 7 are inserted in the script, i.e. 16'6 per
cent. In fact, here too, as in the case of the mistakes, we
seem to have wide differences as to correctness between indi
vidual passages, but not between the two groups obtained under
1I am here only dealing with the insertion or omission of these symbols;

different conditions. If we had no external knowledge as to
the conditions of production, and were to attempt a classifica
tion of the various passages upon internal evidence alone, we
should undoubtedly separate viii D from the rest of viii, as
being on the whole the most correct and scholarly production
of the script in spite of one damning mistake (No. 11); we
should also place viiiB among the more illiterate productions,
on account of its lack of accents and breathings and the general
slovenliness of the writing.
As regards the type of mistakes—as distinct from their
frequency—I have not been able to discover any differences
between the two sections P and NP. An examination of the
type of mistake is, I think, profitable, at least in suggestions,
but I have not found in the study of types any reason for
regarding the division into P and NP as fundamental,—any
reason, that is, for supposing that the presence of Professor
Richet seriously affected the nature of the automatic writings.
I have also carefully examined the script to see if any
improvement were traceable in the course of its production.
But I have found no such trace. The point is of some im
portance as bearing on the genuineness of the phenomena. A
person, wholly ignorant of Greek and deliberately producing
the script, could hardly fail to acquire in the process some
knowledge not possessed at the beginning, even if it were only
a slightly increased familiarity with the appearance of the
letters and words, or a dim perception of the intention or at
least the possible positions of such marks as accents or
breathings. Such increased familiarity might be expected to
manifest itself on a minute examination of the script. But I
have detected nothing of the sort. Individual pieces of script
vary as to apparent ease and correctness of production, but I
find no indication of general improvement.
The above was written before I had the opportunity of
examining a piece of Greek copied under known conditions
as described by Sir Oliver Lodge on p. 197. It will be seen
that in the copy of a Greek unintelligible original produced
deliberately by Mr. Briscoe there are indications of the increased
familiarity for which I looked, and looked in vain, in Madame
X.'s script. It is true that I have not seen the first seven
pieces of that script, but the unfamiliarity with Greek letters
228 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
in the earliest which I have examined, viii, is so marked
that there is plenty of room to note even an extremely slight
indication of increasing comprehension of the symbols. There
is none that I can detect ; the likeness to one another of the
Greek characters used by the script in the extracts from the
Dictionary J is strong and shows no traceable development
or modification : the general appearance of the letters in the
Appendix varies somewhat from that of the letters occurring
in the extracts from the Dictionary. But that may very
well be due to a difference in the character of the type used
in the printed copy of the New Testament known to Madame X.,
which in all probability differs considerably from that used
for the Dictionary of Byzantios.
COMMENTS ON MISTAKES.
I have not attempted a rigorous classification of mistakes, as
some may be attributed to more than one cause. But certain
types are to be observed, and I have grouped together such
as resemble one another. Thus we arrive at the following list :
A. 1. Confusion of letters, - - 19 instances.
2. Accidental slips, viz. : - - 7 „
a. Careless writing, 5.
b. Interchange of signs, 1.
c. Slip of pen, 1.
3. Copyist's errors, 2 „
4. Omissions, 3 ,,
B. Or we may divide them differently, according as the
error seems to be auditory or visual.
C. Again we may classify according to the acquaintance
with Greek indicated by the mistakes, thus :
1. Showing acquaintance, - - - 2.
2. „ unfamiliarity, - - - 1.
3. „ complete ignorance, - - 9.
Some of the mistakes2 appear under more than one head,
as the classes are not exclusive.
1It is possible that an explanation of the unusual and somewhat decorative
character of the Greek letters in viii B is to be found in some peculiarity of the
type employed in printing the Dedication of the Dictionary. The Dedication
occurs only in the first edition, which I have not been able to see.
2 All doubtful cases are included in these lists.
u.] Discussion of Professor Richtt's Case of Xenoglossy. 229
COMMENTS ON THE ABOVE CLASSIFIED MISTAKES.
A. 1. Confusion of letters, 19 instances, including 12 errors,
some recurring.
The larger number of mistakes is produced by the substitu
tion of one letter for another, thus :
a for o thrice ; o for a twice.
a „ (r once ; o „ cr once.
e „ T once ; T „ $ once.
ft „ q once ; v „ i once.
v „ v twice ; v „ v once.
£ „ £ once ; X » * four times.
The substitution of % for K (see above, p. 213) may be
due to a real confusion in the writer's mind, i.e. to a failure
to apprehend that Greek has two distinct letters ; or it may
be due to the resemblance between the form of the characters
in the earlier script. In the first case we might infer on the
part of the writer ignorance of Greek, in the second unfami-
liarity. But there is hardly enough evidence to warrant any
inference, as the four cases of error may be mere slips of the
pen.
With the exception of the substitution of /x for r\ and per
haps e for T (but see above, p. 221) the other mistakes
are of a common enough type, very familiar to proof readers.
They are probably visual errors,1 but they are considerably
more frequent than would be expected in the writing of a
person acquainted with Greek, and suggest that the letters are
at best unfamiliar to the writer of the script. The sub
stitution of ju for ri (No. 33) in the word iroo/erto seems
impossible to any one with the least knowledge of the
language, the combination /xo- being quite impossible. Nor is
the appearance of the letters ft and i/ alike, but in the
shortened forms used by the script there is a certain resem
blance 2 which might lead to confusion in the case of
the mechanical reproduction of an original using these forms.
1 Except T for S, which seems to be auditory.
2 One represents the other upside down.
280 • . Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PAST
2. a, b, c. Slips and accidental errors, 7 instances.
These errors have been described above, and need not
detain us here; little or nothing can be inferred from them
as to the writer's knowledge or habit of mind.
3. Copyist's errors, 2 instances.
The mistake (No. 15), if it be a mistake and not merely
a piece of careless writing, by which raria, instead of TCH/TO,
follows the similar word, Swfj.aria, is common enough in Greek
manuscripts, and is due to the ' influence of the immediate
context ' which ' has been a fertile source of error in transcrip
tion.' 1 The juxtaposition of several similar syllables in the open
ing words of ix, oXa TO Scand-Tia ravra, is probably responsible
for the three errors numbered 12, 14, and 15, all of which
belong to the class described by Sir R. C. Jebb as due to
the influence of the immediate context. The similarity of
-arm and ravra led first (No. 12) to the omission of a
word ; then in the recommenced transcript (ix b) to the
substitution of r, the wrongly introduced letter in the can
celled portion, for S (No. 14), and finally to the reappear
ance of the combination -aria instead of -avra (No. 15).
From this group of errors then we can only infer what we
may infer in many similar cases in Greek MSS., namely,
that the document is a copy—not an original—and that the
copyist is ignorant, or at least for the moment inattentive
and mechanical. In the case before us this inference does
not help much : whether the automatic writing reproduces
passages in a book never seen by Madame X., or passages
deliberately learnt by her, the methods of reproduction must
be those of a copyist, and of a copyist at the best unfamiliar
with the language of his original document.
4. Errors of omission, 3 instances 2 (one word ; two letters').
The first case (No. 12) has just been discussed; the other
two, Nos. 35 and 37, are of a different type, and suggest a
defective text in the original which they reproduce. It is
noticeable that in each case the letter omitted is T : the
word ovofMari, complete, occurs just before the defective ovo/ua i,
1See article on "Textual Criticism," by Professor Sir R. C. Jebb, Com
panion to Greek Studi' . p. 612.
"For No. 28, which may be an error of omission, see p. 234.
LI.] Discussion of Professor Richets Case of Xenoglossy. 231
and in the «9 which stands for T«J there is no breathing on
the vowel as there usually, but not always, is in the script
on an initial vowel. That is to say, these omissions point to
a mechanical—and certainly a non-intelligent—reproduction of
the original.
It would be very interesting, if it were possible, to ex
amine the copy of the New Testament which (see Professor
Richet's article, p. 193) Madame X. believes her family to
have possessed.
B. Division of errors into Auditory and Visual.
Professor Richet (p. 175) gives reasons for thinking that the
phenomenon in question, whatever its ultimate explanation, is
a visual one. I have examined the mistakes from this point
of view and come to the same conclusion. Naturally all the
mistakes cannot be thus classified with certainty. I have
excluded all cases of confusion of letters—though in the
majority of these the confusion is probably due to visual
error—as it is possible that they may be due to slips of the
pen in writing, not to misreading of the prototype. I have
also excluded the ' copyist's errors ' discussed above ; errors
of audition as well as of vision probably contribute to these.
There remains one ambiguous case and ten (of which three
are doubtful) of visual error.
No. 31, the ambiguous case, is a possible, though doubtful
instance of mishearing of an original. The word Suotyepei is
used for Sia(pepet, and the first two vowel sounds may have
been misheard. On the other hand, as noted on p. 213, the
letters ••' and « are much alike in the script, and the mistake
of o for a occurs elsewhere (No. 22) as well as that of a
for o (No. 29).
It is curious, though probably accidental, that the substituted
prefix Svo (for Sia) is an intelligible combination in Greek ; it
is possible to see in this error a trace of acquaintance with
Greek, but if any intelligence, and not pure chance, has gone
to the production of Svofapet it must be strictly limited, and
does not include a knowledge of the meaning of Svo, two, or
a rudimentary acquaintance with the principles of verb-
composition.
The visual errors consist of three doubtful and seven certain
232 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [PART
cases: the three doubtful are Nos. 18 and 20, which may be
slips in writing, but may also be visual confusions between
similar signs (see comment on mistakes), and No. 34, where
a superfluous stroke may represent something seen and incor
rectly reproduced.
Some such mechanical reproduction seems to explain
two of the visual errors, Nos. 2 and 10, where marks
occurring in the Dictionary are reproduced wholly without
comprehension in the script. The accuracy with which
marks in the Dictionary are reproduced is commented on by
Professor Hichet,1 and is evidence, as far as it goes, that
the reproduction is absolutely mechanical, and the process a
visual one.
The other five visual errors, fiiKpa-v, yoXjo-/ua^y, Sfj.l\ovs,
Movo-e^ow, ev irapoSfy, discussed by Professor Richet, have
been commented on above. They are also dealt with below as
bearing on the knowledge of the Greek language shown in
the script.
C. Inference from errors as to knmoledge or ignorance of
Greek.
We now come to the discussion of such mistakes as give
any evidence as to knowledge or ignorance of Greek. Only
two 2 of the mistakes show, I think, any acquaintance with
Greek, and in both cases other explanations are admissible.
In No. 31 it is possible that a dim recollection of Suo may
have helped to the corruption of Siafyepet ; in No. 15 it is
conceivable, though in my opinion highly improbable, that the
mistake, if it be a mistake, of rcma for ravra, is made by a
person able to read Greek letters and pronounce the resulting
word.
On the other hand, there are many indications in the mis
takes that Greek is wholly unknown to the writer of the
script. In No. 29 ra for TO is doubtless a visual error, or a
slip of the pen, but, as Professor Richet has pointed out, one
hardly possible to any one with the smallest acquaintance with
the language. Ignorance of the laws of accentuation is shown
by the first mistake (No. 1), where a circumflex is substituted
for an acute accent on the antepenultimate syllable. Incident-
See pp. 181-2. 2See however below, on mistakes 11, 8, and 28.
LI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 233
ally I may remark that the extraordinary correctness of
accentuation in the script—only two errors occurring among
more than 300 accents given—constitutes in my opinion a
strong reason for believing that the script is a purely
mechanical reproduction of what has been clearly visualised,
and not in the least understood. Mistakes 2 and 10, where
unmeaning strokes are reproduced, as well as the accuracy of
the punctuation throughout, not forgetting the representation
of dots marking omissions, inverted commas, a diaeresis, and so
on, confirm this view; this accuracy is to be expected in a
copy which is mechanically reproduced, either by a clear
visualising memory, or by a person too ignorant of the mean
ing of the document before him to venture to tamper with a
single dot.
Mistakes 11, 16, 17, 27, 33, and possibly 20,1 show gross
and complete ignorance of Greek ; three of them, -aSs for
-ovs, Sfj. for oft., and $(p for Sip, are easily explained as visual
errors, and another, -n&ia for -jIaw, as a confusion of letters,
all possible only to a writer ignorant of Greek. No. 11, as
I have said, is not so simply accounted for, though it shows
as complete an ignorance as the others. But I fail to see
how fjuxpov, which appears in the Dictionary, could be repro
duced as niKpfrv, unless it passed through the intermediary
of fuicpov. This it might do in the case of a person know
ing Greek, who would get from the Dictionary passage the
notion not of the collection of signs, fjuxpov, but of the group
of words of which one was the accusative of /ui/c/ooy, that is
fjuxpov. But here we are in a dilemma, for this person
could not possibly be the ignoramus who writes niKpcrv. In
fact, it seems as if two2 persons, or two personalities, were
required to explain this mistake, X1 who knows enough of
Greek to reverse this accent and to think of iuuicpov instead of
the fJUKpov of the Dictionary, and X2 who is so ignorant as to
turn fj.inpov into fjuKpcrv—in the very middle, be it noted, of
the best written, best accented, and most correct of all the

who doea not know Greek.

extracts—one too where the absence of supervision gave every
opportunity for use of the Dictionary.
It will be noticed that two of the mistakes, Nos. 8 and
28, are not included in any classification. If the double
gamma, yy, in the script is a mere slip, as it may be, for
the gamma chi, y%, of the actual word (rvyywpricris, no in
ference can be drawn : if it is a reminiscence of the misprint
in the Dictionary, double gamma chi, yyx> un(ler the head
ing (rvyyvuift.q, it shows that the writer of the script has
enough acquaintance with Greek to read Greek capitals.
The juxtaposition and appropriate position of the two
words KoVoy "ZvyxaiprIa-K suggests that their meaning was
known ; if that knowledge was obtained from the French-Greek
part, confirmation was sought—always supposing that the
double gamma is not a mere slip—in the Greek-French part
where the mis-spelling occurs.
The deliberate use of the Dictionary is not in any case
proved, even if we assume a causal and not accidental con
nexion between the misprint of the Dictionary and the error
of the script, as the writer might have obtained his knowledge
from the Greek-French part, if he had seen—normally or
supernormally—the note under a-vyyvwuq and had also seen
the word KOiTOy with its meaning. In that case this mistake-
contributes nothing to the solution of the problem beyond the
fact that the writer of the script can read Greek capitals,
as he reproduces in small letters what his prototype prints in
capitals, and, therefore, that no absolute ignoramus or purely
mechanical copyist is at work here; in fact we have X1 and
not X2.
The other unclassified mistake, No. 28, may be accounted
for in two ways ; if the origin of the word given in the
script as irepaa-Tiicio is to be found in the Greek-French part
of the Dictionary, we must admit that the writer of the
script :
(1) reads Greek Capitals ;
(2) knows enough of the laws of accentuation to alter the
acute accent on the final syllable to a circumflex, when the
vowel is lengthened ;
(3) attempts a modification of the termination to make a
construable phrase.
LI.] Discussion of Professor Jtwhfit's Case of Xenoglossy. 235
This is all, I think, extremely improbable; we may take
it as almost beyond a doubt that the origin of the word is
to be found in the French-Greek part of the Dictionary,
where under the head Passer, occur in juxtaposition, as
renderings of en passant, the phrases ev irapoSw, irepacmKUis.
The script reproduces these, with the intervening comma, but
with two mistakes, (p for « in the first word, and omission
of the final ? in the second. Accepting this explanation of
the mistake, we may infer acquaintance with the French-Greek
part of the Dictionary, but no knowledge of Greek.
The reader will observe that I here use the term acquaintance
and not -use; the case is not precisely like the preceding one,
even if we accept in both cases the connexion between the
script and the French-Greek Dictionary. Here nothing
further is required than a visual reproduction of a phrase out
of the French-Greek part, exactly of the same type as the
reproduction of phrases out of the Greek-French part, the
Introduction, and the Dedication, or out of S. John's Gospel,
and a couple of Plato's Dialogues. In fact we learn nothing
from this mistake but the provenience—to use an archaeologist's
term—of a passage in the script.
The earlier case, No. 8, is quite different ; there, if the
French-Greek Dictionary is to come in at all—a thing I am
far from maintaining—it must have been deliberately used,
for the purpose of combining the notions of ' Fatigue,' and
' Excuse.'
Having frankly set out this possible evidence for a deliberate
use of the Dictionary, in other words for fraud, as an ex
planation of the phenomena, I am bound to say that this
explanation of mistake No. 8 is an alternative only, and that
personally I believe the other alternative more probable,
namely, that its origin is to be sought in the Greek-French
part, where the mis-spelling occurs. It is quite as likely
that the word o-vyxwpq(rw should be reproduced from the
page where it appears under o-yyyvoJ/ui/ as from the page
where it is given under its own heading. In both cases,
we have to suppose on the part of the writer—or rather a
writer—of the script an acquaintance with Greek capitals ; in
fact we have to postulate the existence of X1 as well as of
the mere copyist X2.
236 Mrs. A. W. Verrali. [PART
From a consideration then of the evidence from the actual
text of the script, we are led to the apparently inconsistent
view that both knowledge and ignorance—of an irreconcilable
kind—are to be found in the writer of the script, in fact
that our unknown quantity is double, that there is an X1 who
knows Greek, and an X2 who is wholly ignorant. There is
more evidence for the existence of X2 than of X1, but before
dealing further with the general problem—which hitherto our
investigation has not simplified—let us see whether any evidence
in either direction can be obtained from a consideration of
other points than the text,—from the meaning, for instance, and
source of the quotations given in the script. For this purpose
I shall not confine my criticism to the 23 pieces of which I
have examined the originals, but shall include the whole 31
pieces described in Professor Richet's article.
SOURCES AND APPLICABILITY OF QUOTATIONS IN SCRIPT.
The sources of almost every piece have been ascertained,
and are given by Professor Richet ; but parts of iii and of
vii have not been traced. No. iii begins with some words,
not construable as they stand, though needing but little
correction. The rest of the sentence is less intelligible though
certain expressions are clear. The extract runs thus : Ewx>/ dfos
ev\oyua Kai rI\0a KOTO irpoiTK\q(Tiv TOV KIJLTO TO Sf$oyfj.eva.
Emendation is dangerous where so little is known of the nature
of the writing ; I prefer to consider the text as it stands. It
is not certain that it represents modern Greek ; the words
which it indicates are known to classical Greek—though the
form q\Oa is modern and forms of the first three words appear
in close conjunction in the Dictionary under tvxri, viz. : ei/x>/ =
ev\oyla ; and later ei/x»/ Oeov. The last phrase cannot occur iu
the Dictionary, as the ancient verb SOKUI seems to have been
replaced by $oKifj.ul£w, so that the participle SfSoyneva is not
recognised there. The phrase Kara TO SeSoyfieva is very
good ancient Greek for ' according to the doctrines,' and, at
present, I see no reason to alter it, as suggested in Professor
Richet's article, to SiSofj.eva.
No. vii also opens with a sentence not intelligible and not
traced to any source : here the form of the sentence suggests
that the language is modern Greek, but the phrases used have
LL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 237
not been found in Byzantios' Dictionary till we come to the
last four words.
With these two exceptions, the source of the quotations is
known ; the hooks drawn upon are :
Byzantios' Dictionary; at least twenty different places in the
vocabulary columns, besides the Dedication, and two
parts of the Introduction.
Plato, Apology of Socrates, two distinct places.
Plato, Phaedrus.
S. John's Gospel, chapters iv, xiv, xv, and xvi.
Speaking generally, the selection of passages from the body
of the Dictionary does not require any knowledge of Greek.
The Greek phrases in that book are followed by their French
equivalents, so that the meaning is at once apparent. The
long passages from E. Sue and Bernardin de S. Pierre (Nos.
viii A, D and ix) likewise demand no knowledge of Greek, as
their meaning is unimportant. But this is not always the
case. There are three instances (i and viii A, u,) which seem
to show some acquaintance with Greek. In viiiu the word
"FJXXay (Greece) in the dedication is replaced in the script by
the word FaXX/a (France) ; this requires at least an elementary
acquaintance with the letters, so that the right substitution
may be made.
A much stronger proof of acquaintance with Greek is in
my view to be found in the appropriate use, at the beginning
of viii A, of the phrase translated from Cicero in the Intro
duction to the Dictionary, on which Professor llichet dwells
on p. 182. It is to me quite inconceivable that this phrase
should occur where it does by chance. Let us recall the
circumstances : Professor Richet receives from a lady, who has
already produced in his presence short Greek sentences, a
long document in Greek. This document begins with the
remark that in the lack of Latin words Greek words may be
used, and then goes on to give three long Greek extracts,
concluding l with a statement (viii c), that the writer is fatigued
il have, to avoid confusion, kept to Professor Richet'a numbering of the ex-
tracto in viii, lint I do not think, nor does he assert, that his numbering
represents the chronological sequence of the script. I believe the order to be
viii A, D, B, c. An examination of the document makes this clear, I think.
A and D are written on opposite sides of the paper, the same way up ; to read

and begs to be excused, expressed by two nouns, ' Weariness,
Pardon.' Can anything be more appropriate ? The conclusion,
it is true, could be given by a writer ignorant of Greek who
had used the Dictionary, found separately the words for
Weariness and Pardon, combined them and reproduced them
with blunders. But not so the opening words. As Professor
Richet points out, the Dictionary contains no translation into
French of the phrase about using Greek, which occurs in the
Introduction side by side with its Latin original, and I think
every one will agree that it takes a considerable knowledge of
Latin to see the meaning of the quotation from Cicero, ' Graecis
licet utare, cum voles, si te latinae forte deficiant.' If our
writer knows no Greek, his Latin scholarship at any rate is
good. And be it noted that there is no reason to attribute to
Madame X. a knowledge even of elementary Latin.
The appropriateness of the shorter phrases from the Dictionary
to the circumstances of their production argues intelligence,
but not necessarily knowledge of Greek. From the instances
in the Dictionary it would be possible for an intelligent person
ignorant of Greek l to pick out phrases of sufficient general

applicability to be introduced on occasion with appropriateness,
and the extracts in question are not so distinctive or unusual
as to be limited in applicability to the precise circumstances
of their production. Remarks about a war which interests
Europe, copies resembling their original, notes which will make
a volume larger, and lengthening shadows, could without diffi
culty find appropriate places in many conversations, and these
or similar phrases could probably be acquired without much
labour by an industrious person with a good visual memory,
even without a preliminary knowledge of Greek. The use of
them shows intelligence, but not knowledge of Greek.
Nor is it necessary to see a proof of knowledge of Greek
in the introduction of the name of Professor Richet's great
grandfather by means of a phrase from the Dictionary (ii) ; it
is true that the word ovofta, name, would be likely to be a
good hunting ground for any one intending to produce a Greek
speaking personality, but the blunders both in the name
AJTCCWI/Oy—the equivalent not of Antoine but of Antonin—
and in the two preceding words /carto-roy oi/o/uaro for (cairo/oy
ovofj.aTt are not suggestive of the very slightest acquaintance
with the language. It puts no strain upon the laws of chance
to suppose that the phrase ' un nomme Antoine ' was acci
dentally noticed and fixed upon as appropriate by the intelli
gence—of whatever kind—that is responsible for the production
of the script.
So much then for the evidence as to knowledge of Greek
from the contents of the Dictionary. Nothing can be obtained
from an examination of the verses from S. John's Gospel.
The division into numbered verses and the resultant facilities,
even for one who has no Greek, of comparison between the
original and a translation places these extracts in much the
same position as the Dictionary phrases ; their selection demands
intelligence, but not Greek.
But the case is different with the extracts from Plato. I
find it hard to believe that a comparison between the Greek
case is worth noting, however, as it is not a mere visual reproduction of
a printed original, but a combination showing intelligence of the same type
aa in iii (where two nouns, separately entered in the Dictionary, are joined
by the conjunction ' and ') and iv (where a sentence is made up of three
words occurring separately in the Dictionary).

240 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part
text and a translation would enable a person who could not
read Greek to pick out from the long paragraphs of the myth
of the Phaedrus a single complete sentence intelligible without
its context and so well suited for enunciation by the mysterious
and impressive means of automatic writing, as this description
of the complete initiate (v.). An interlinear word for word
translation alone would make this likely, and I am not ac
quainted with any such except for a few books of a simple
kind adapted for the use of beginners. It appears to me
unlikely that any such edition of the Phaedrus exists in
France. Nor is the sentence likely to form one of a series
selected for scholastic purposes to illustrate points of syntax or
idiom.
The evidence for acquaintance with Greek obtainable from
passage No. i is stronger. Here we have two sentences from
Plato's account of the Defence of Socrates. The first of these,
' human wisdom is of little worth or none,' is found in the
ninth chapter of the Dialogue, and is the interpretation put
by Socrates himself on the famous answer of the Delphic
oracle that no one was wiser than Socrates. The second,
' but now the time has come for departure,' is the opening
clause of the last sentence of the Dialogue (chap. 33). The
two phrases are not in juxtaposition in the Dialogue, so
that no casual glance would have perceived them both. The
first sentence is one that might be used, out of its context,
to illustrate a point of syntax, or might be quoted in an article
on Socrates.1 But there is nothing distinctive about the second
sentence, and it is not likely to be quoted anywhere out of
its context. The conjunction of two disconnected sentences
out of the same Dialogue and the appropriate use of the
second cannot possibly be fortuitous, and would be natural
enough to a Greek scholar ; that a person unable to read
Greek should have hit upon such a combination is to my mind
outside the range of the most widely ranging Chance. But
though we have reason to see the work of X1 in the selection
of the passages, his collaborator X2 seems also to have done
his share ; apa for wpa is an unlikely slip for a reader of
Greek, and aireivai for a-n-ievai is an elementary blunder.
1 That Madame X. is interested in Socrates and his ' guide ' is within my
personal knowledge.
UL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 241
So then from a consideration of the contents of the automatic
writing as well as from that of its form, we are led irresistibly
to the paradox that the writer possesses both knowledge and
ignorance, knowledge and ignorance of an irreconcilable kind.
For what we have observed is not the alternate presence and
absence of knowledge of Greek, but the simultaneous possession
of knowledge and non-knowledge of the same thing.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE ABOVE EXAMINATION.
The reader, if any reader has followed me so far through
the wearisome technicalities of this examination, will perhaps
ask what is my general conclusion on the whole matter, or
in a concrete form, who are the X1 and the X2 into whom I
have resolved the comparatively comprehensible 'Madame X.' of
the original problem.
To this question—which I would remind the reader I am
here approaching only from the standpoint of internal evidence
of the script itself—I can give no satisfactory answer ; we
have not sufficient information to warrant a conclusion. Such
evidence as we have suggests this double source, and all we
can do at present is to register the evidence, and see what
light it throws upon existing theories. Of theories that have
been or may be advanced to explain this case of Xenoglossy
some are ruled out by the acceptance of this double source ;
the explanation by unconscious memory—that is, the repro
duction of printed matter seen but not consciously observed—
must be rejected, as it fails to account not only for the
knowledge of Greek, but also for the intelligence shown by the
writer ; moreover, as Professor Richet has pointed out, we have
no other instance of production by unconscious memory of such
a mass as is before us here, nor of matter from such various
sources.
For the spiritistic hypothesis, communication from ' Antoine
Renouard,' there is at present no evidence before us but the
unsupported ' ipse dixit ' of the script, and those who are
acquainted with automatic phenomena will know how much
weight to attach to that.
No theory which does not admit intelligence and knowledge
of Greek will fit my view of the facts, so that I should not
242 Mrs. A. W. Verratt* [PART
be able to accept a hypothesis which gave a large share to
chance as a cause. Chance might indeed account for some of
the successes, for the discovery of the name Antoine, for
instance, or perhaps for the finding of an appropriate quotation
from Plato, but not for the finding of three appropriate quota
tions from Plato, and the combination in one sentence of the
two which come from the same dialogue. Thus a combination
of Chance, Fraud, and Ignorance of Greek will not, as I believe,
explain the phenomena.
Fraud, in certain conditions, would account for the facts ;
if, for instance, we suppose two persons, X1 and X2, who
combine to make a sensational story. X1 has a knowledge of
Greek, looks out appropriate passages, consults Byzantios'
Dictionary, and passes on his information to X2, who knows
no Greek ; X2, copying blindly from transcripts (see mistake
No. 11) or from marked books, introduces the illiterate
blunders that are not infrequent. Headers must judge for
themselves of the value of other considerations—the ' moral
proofs ' of which Professor Richet speaks—which make unlikely
the hypothesis of fraud on the part of Madame X.—the X2 of
the above theory; these considerations necessarily carry more
weight with Madame X.'s friends and acquaintances than with
strangers. Fraud, being an ascertained cause of many pheno
mena, must always be admitted as a possible, even a probable,
cause. I would, however, point out that the introduction of
a second person, which I regard as a necessary deduction
from the evidence, more than doubles the risk of discovery,
and thereby increases the improbability of fraudulent action
where the producer of the fraudulent phenomena has much to
lose by discovery. I would also point out that on the theory
of fraudulent collusion between X1 and X2 we must admit that
X1 uses less intelligence than we might expect. Given an
intelligent person, who knew Greek, and was deliberately
working this business, a much better show might have been
made.
This, perhaps, suggests that the theory of fraud and the
double origin of the script are best reconciled if we suppose
X1 to be innocent, supplying material without being aware
that he is so doing to X2, who gets books and suggestions
from him. This proceeding is more comprehensible, but hardly
LL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 243
less dangerous for X2, unless it is certain that X1 will hear
nothing of the stir made by this strange case of Xenoglossy.
But the splitting or doubling of the producer of the script,
the division of X into X1 and X2, need not imply fraud. If
the phenomena are regarded as genuine, X1 and X2 will be two
manifestations or aspects of the producing cause, whatever
that producing cause may be. The phenomena, whatever their
origin, are at least presented to us by the hand of Madame X.,
who, on this theory, knows no Greek and who may thus
easily supply our X2. X1 is then to be found perhaps in her
Subliminal Consciousness, or in some external force acting upon
the Subliminal, or again in some aspect of that Personality
which we are coming to recognise as Multiplex. Is the
contrast between our X1 and our X2 stronger than that be
tween Ansel Bourne and his alias A. J. Brown I1 Does the
knowledge of Greek mark a difference deeper than is shown
in the knowledge and practice of an ethical code exhibited
by Miss Beauchamp and unknown to Sally ?2 Is the power to
read an unknown tongue more remarkable than the power of
drawing possessed by the B 1 0 personality of Dr. Wilson's
patient,3 Mary Barnes ? These are problems for the psycho
logist ; it is the business of us psychical researchers to
investigate such phenomena as bear no prima fade evidence
of fraud, to examine them in detail, to analyse the results,
to draw what inferences we may from the facts presented,
to provide established data for the future construction of
theories ; in short, to put a plain label on each particular
pigeon hole of that large receptacle of observed facts which
it is the chief duty of our Society to keep accessible and
well arranged.
Since writing the above paper, I have been able, through the
kindness of Professor Richet, to examine a copy of the first
edition of Byzantios' Dictionary. The following points may be
noticed :

edition. None of these can be traced to the first edition. In
2 and 1 0 the arrangement of the words is quite different. As to
8, the first edition has not the mis-spelling of crvyx(epri(ri<;, and in
the Greek-French part uses capital letters as initials, but not
otherwise.
On the other hand, the type of the Dedication (which is in the
first edition only) is found, as I suggested before seeing it, to
account for the peculiar forms of letters in Extract viii B. See
note on p. 228, and comment on letters v, iT, p.
It will be seen, then, that there are circumstances which would
appear prima facie to connect the script with each edition as
distinct from the other. I am not disposed at present to draw
any inference from these facts, and do not wish to suggest any.
u] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 245
III.
BY THE HON. EVERAED FEILDING AND ALICE JOHNSON.
THE problems presented by M. Richet's paper may perhaps
be stated thus. Here is a series of phenomena which can
reasonably be explained only in two ways : (1) fraud, (2)
clairvoyance of such a singular character that, as M. Richet
himself points out, no theory of which one can form any con
ception can be constructed to suit it. We have therefore to
consider which is the easier explanation, and the answer must
be fraud of one kind or another, unless there is strong evidence
against it The suspicious circumstances of the case were
of course obvious to M. Richet, and he has not hesitated to
set them forth—with the full consent, it must be noted, of
Mine- X. herself—plainly and emphatically. Yet he concludes
that the balance of evidence is against fraud. When we ask
what the arguments in support of this conclusion amount to,
there appear two answers : (1) the apparent good faith of the
medium ; (2) internal evidence resting on the characteristics of
the script itself, tending to show that it could not have been
produced by normal means.
In regard to the first, M. Richet's intimate knowledge of the
lady and the conclusions which he has been led to form from
it must of course command the greatest respect. Knowledge
of this kind may be sufficient, and in certain cases is legiti
mately sufficient, to produce conviction in the mind of him
who possesses it. It is in reliance on such kind of knowledge
that we all act with completest confidence in matters of
ordinary life, or human intercourse would be impossible. But
it is clear that in order to establish the nature of pheno
mena of such an almost unprecedented description as those
contained in his paper, evidence of more universal application
is necessary. M. Richet is, of course, himself the first to admit
this, and he therefore adduces a number of arguments tending
246 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART
to show from the script it.self that agency of some super
normal character must have been at work.
In this paper we purpose, therefore, first to consider the chief
point.s of evidence in turn in order to test their validity. The
task is not a grateful one, for we must on our side admit
that even should we succeed in meeting most of M. Richet's
arguments, the result will be purely negative, and though it
may perhaps be concluded that they are insufficient to establish
the supposed supernormal agency, it is equally certain that we
cannot establish any other.
There may, however, be certain considerations which point
to, though they cannot prove, an alternative conclusion to M.
Richet's, and it will be the second portion of our task to sum
up what these amount to, though without intending to commit
ourselves in any way to the opinion that this conclusion is
the right one.
M. Richet's argument may very shortly be summarised and
its constituent parts numbered as follows. (1) Mme. X., who
knows no Greek, writes in a shaky hand, which of itself
suggests that the writing was executed as if by a copyist,
ignorant of Greek and unaccustomed to write it, a number
of Greek sentences. While some of these were written in
his absence and may therefore have been copied from a
book, the bulk were written in his presence. (2) The quantity
of the latter sentences is so considerable, and their execution
on the whole so accurate, that it is impossible to suppose that
they could have been learnt by heart. (3) Further, the mis
takes which do occur, both in the sentences written in his
absence as well as in those written in his presence, are often
of such a character that they cannot be accounted for, on
an assumption of fraud, in any consistent way. (4) And
again, inasmuch as the mistakes in the former class of
sentences, where a text to copy from might be assumed, are
not less numerous than those in the latter class, which
were certainly written without text, it is reasonable to assume
that both were written under the same conditions, i.s.
without text. (5) The fact that the majority of sentences
are found in an extremely rare dictionary, and in the Greek-
French part of that dictionary, makes it improbable that Mme.
X. could have had access to the dictionary, or (6) since she
LL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 247
knew no Greek, could have made any practical use of it if
she had. (7) The appropriateness of many of the sentences
produced in M. Richet's presence is so remarkable that it
most follow that their production was the work of some
extraneous intelligence. (8) Although it is true that most of
the sentences found in the dictionary have French translations
alongside them, there is at least one of quite especial appro
priateness (viz. VIII. A. -^p^crdai Xe'^eo-jv, etc.), which has only a
translation in somewhat difficult Latin (also an unknown
language to Mme. X.) from which fact particularly deliberate
rational intelligence is to be assumed. (9) Finally, that such
intelligence is again revealed by the choice of the phrases
from Plato's Apology and Phsedrus and the Gospel of St.
John, which are also stated to be appropriate.
Let us then take these arguments seriatim, which for the
sake of brevity we will refer to by their respective numbers.
(1) Much of M. Richet's paper is devoted to showing that
Mme. X. knows no Greek. We admit at once thnt it is
clear she knows extremely little. We see, however, no reason
for supposing that she has not learnt the letters, a task which
any ordinarily intelligent student could master in an hour, and
which would enable her, if necessary, to look up words in a
dictionary and in any case would greatly facilitate the learning
of passages by heart. This question of ignorance we deal with
in greater detail when we come to a consideration of point (3).
(2) Assuming that Mme. X. had learnt the Greek alphabet,
and was thus able to associate in her mind the approximate
sound of the words with the printed text, is it possible to learn
a number of sentences by heart, and reproduce them with
reasonable accuracy afterwards ? We should have thought it was.
It must be remembered that Greek, like Latin, is a language
the spelling of which is absolutely phonetic. Once the sound
is mastered, the spelling follows inevitably. It is therefore
not in the reproduction, but in the original learning, that the
difficulty arises. Is it then possible to learn by heart passages
which mean nothing to the learner ? Prof. Richet maintains
that it would be " materially impossible " for any one to re
produce from memory and with so much accuracy phrases in
a language unknown to him as long as the passages IX. to
XV., which were written in his presence on a single occasion.
248 Hon. Everard Fettding and Alice Johnson. [PART
The longest and most difficult of these passages is IX., which
consists of 41 words ; the other six are short and com
paratively simple, containing 44 words altogether. It would
no doubt take a good deal of time and trouble to learn as
much of an unknown language as this by heart, but we cannot
feel that it is a feat of superhuman difficulty. We would suggest
as analogous instances a schoolboy who learns, in most cases
with hardly the ability to construe them, and certainly without
taking the trouble to do so, long passages of Greek or Latin
verse for punishment tasks ; or the still more appropriate
case of entirely uneducated Roman Catholic boys who learn
by rote, often without the slightest attempt at verbal com
prehension, long passages of Latin for the purpose of serving
at Mass or other devotional exercises.
There is nothing in the circumstances of Mme. X.'s case to
prevent the passages having been carefully studied and copied
out again and again before they were produced in M. Richet's
presence, for the Dictionary was, as he states in his paper, in
a public library where she is accustomed to read, and there can
be no difficulty in finding a Greek New Testament in Paris.
(3) The points on which we venture to differ from M. Richet
depend a good deal on our different conception of the process that
would have been employed, supposing there was fraud. Thus as
to the character of the mistakes, it must be noticed that a person
ignorant of Greek and learning it by heart might do this in two
ways : (a) by a process of mere visualisation, which would no
doubt be a very difficult task ; (6) by learning the letters suffi
ciently well to be able to associate sounds with them, and by
then learning the passages by sound like a parrot. This, as
already suggested, is the more probable and easy method.
But it is still more probable that the two methods would
have been combined, in which case, while trying to reproduce
a passage so learnt, mistakes due either to faulty visualisation,
such as ^ for w, or 6 for 6, or to faulty audition, such as
T for S, might creep in.
Following Mrs. Verral1's analysis of the mistakes, we find
at the outside only nine cases showing such complete and
gross ignorance as 6 for 6, or 0 for to, out of 372 Greek words.
This is a very small number, and after all, what evidence is
there that the script writer did not really know better ? If,
LL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 249
indeed, she had been questioned about inaccurate letters, and
was unable to see that they were wrong, this would show real
ignorance; or if she had read over the script carefully and
had not found out the mistakes, this would show at least great
carelessness. It is surely not necessary to attribute all the
mistakes specifically either to faulty visualisation or audition.
It all depends on whether the mistakes were made, so
to speak, deliberately, while the conscious attention of the
writer was directed towards the letters, or were mere slips.
We all know that educated people make extraordinary
mistakes in writing or even in speaking, which—if we did not
know they were slips—we might take as evidence of gross
ignorance. It seems not impossible, then, that these bad mis
takes of Mme. X.'s were mere slips, and if so, they do not
afford evidence of any greater ignorance than the mistakes
which Mrs. Verrall classifies as confusion of letters, accidental
slips, copyist's errors and omissions.
The fact of the second phrase in passage VII. being given
by raps—instead of in writing, like all the other passages
(see Prof. Richet's paper, p. 167) seems to involve some know
ledge of the letters on the part of the automatist.
This production of some of the sentences by raps is surely
of considerable importance, if only as tending to show the
improbability of Sir Oliver Lodge's theory of the modus
operandi of the unknown intelligence. It is difficult enough
to assume that this intelligence or control, if it is attempt
ing to induce visions, can only do so by means of a
printed text. But it is going further still to assume that
it can only rap out sentences alread}7 existing in print. If
it can rap alphabetically, the natural deduction is that it
must be able to rap out original sentences. If it cannot do
this, we can only account for its deficiency by another and an
entirely unfounded hypothesis,—that its knowledge is limited
to the understanding of written Greek, and is not extensive
enough to enable it to compose original phrases. But—and
this is a point on which we wish to lay special emphasis—the
appropriate substitution of the word TaXX/a (France) for *EXXa9
(Greece) in VIII. B, suggests at least enough familiarity with
the letters to be able to look up words in a dictionary. It
appears, then, either that the extraneous intelligence can compose
250 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART
original Greek (which for the purposes of his argument M.
Richet seems bound to assume it cannot) or Mme. X. knows
enough of the Greek alphabet and can apply her knowledge
with sufficient intelligence to make appropriate alterations in
the text given in the Dictionary.
The omission of all the accents in the first seven passages
of the script, and their sudden appearance later, is another point
that tells strongly against the theory of a purely visual and
mechanical method of production, or against Sir Oliver Lodge's
hypothesis of a psychic printed text serving as a copy.
(4) M. Richet argues (p. 182) that since passage IX., written
in his presence, shows just the same characteristics as VIII.,
written in his absence, it is almost certain that the two
passages must have been produced under the same conditions.
Mrs. Verral1's analysis, however, shows that IX. was in fact far
more inaccurate than VIII., and that VIII. D (which is the longest
of the four portions into which VIII. is divided, being made
up of 77 words, whereas the other three portions together
contain 85 words), " presents a much more scholarly appear
ance than any other passage and contains only 3 mistakes
(or possibly 2)."
This is obviously what would be expected if VIII. had
been simply copied from the Dictionary, while IX. had been
learnt by heart and written out from memory.
(5) As to the difficulty of supposing that Mme. X. could
have had access to so rare a book as the Byzantios Dictionary,
it must be remembered, assuming fraud, that it was she who
had the initiative in selecting the book. It is not unreasonable
to suppose that, if she were fraudulent, she would naturally
select a rare book in hopes of not being afterwards found out.
Besides, as M. Richet states, the book is in the library at
Paris, in which it is known that Mme. X. is in the habit of
studying, and the Greek-French part to which nearly all, if
not all, the quotations from the Dictionary have been traced,
is cut, while the French-Greek part, to which Mrs. Verrall has
apparently traced one phrase (part of X.) is not.1
1 Mi-. Verrall, however, who has since had an opportunity of seeing the
copy from the Paris Library, tella us that parts of the French-Greek section
are cut, that all the cuts are quite ancient, and that all the pages, cut or
uncut, can be easily read.
LL] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 251
(6) It is in the Greek-French part chiefly, if not exclusively,
that any phrases occur—Greek phrases being given, followed
by a translation into French. The French-Greek part consists
almost entirely of separate words, followed by their Greek
equivalents. This would certainly make it difficult for a person
ignorant of Greek to look up a given phrase in the Dictionary ;
but it would put no difficulty in the way of his making a
little miscellaneous collection of phrases out of it, by glancing
at the French phrases and learning their Greek equivalents.
Much of the script suggests such a heterogeneous collection
of phrases, and could easily be accounted for by supposing the
Dictionary to have been used in this way.
(7) Perhaps the argument on which M. Richet lays most
stress is that based on the applicability of some of the sentences
written in his presence. Some of these do show a certain
applicability to the circumstances suggestive of knowledge
and intelligence, and this no doubt has to be accounted for.
With regard to VI., X.-XV. inclusive, and Appendix 10-12
(pp. 206-9), we think with Mrs. Verrall that it would not be
difficult to learn up a number of phrases which would be at
least as appropriate as these to the circumstances of the sittings
and which could be produced with the same appearance of
spontaneity. In order to test this hypothesis, Miss Johnson,
who knows no Greek, spent about half-an-hour searching in
the Greek-French part of the Dictionary for phrases which
might apply to the known circumstances of the case—viz. (1)
to the general nature and conditions of the phenomenon, and
(2) to M. Richet's projected journey to England to read a
paper on it before a meeting of the S.P.R.
This brief and cursory search revealed a mine of material
in the way of phrases, two or three of which might easily have
been learnt at a time and brought in with effect at the next
sitting. Most of the phrases that actually occur in the script,
when appropriate at all, are, it may be noted, of such a
generally or vaguely applicable nature that no "forcing" would
have been required. But in any case, supposing phrases had
been learnt, a slight exercise of ingenuity would suffice to lead
the conversation on to some topic into which they could be
introduced, as answers to or comments upon the remarks of the
sitter. To illustrate this, we have constructed an "imaginary
252 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART
conversation " between sitter and script, in which the state
ments of the latter are composed exclusively of French phrases
given in the Dictionary with their Greek equivalents. This
should properly be conceived of as extending over the course
of several sittings, including a number of irrelevant circum
stances ; but for brevity we condense it into a single scene, com
posed of the crucial points alone and omitting the irrelevanciea.

We repeat that this conversation is not intended as a
specimen of what could be supposed to have actually occurred
but is simply given in order to show that the Dictionary con
tains a number of sentences, easily memorised, of which one or
Li.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 253
another would with any reasonable good luck prove appropriate
at one moment or another, and we think that if two or three
of the phrases suggested above had been produced, no one could
fail to be struck with the apparent intelligence shown by the
script. On the other hand, no one would complain if the
writing had no application whatever to the circumstances.
Indeed, M. Richet does not complain of the flagrant inappro-
priateness of most of it. A fraudulent medium therefore would
have everything to gain and nothing to lose by learning up
sentences that might with a little luck be appropriate. The
phrases of salutation and farewell, several times repeated (I.,
II., V., VIII. C, and Appendix 10-12) could not fail to be
appropriate.
(8) Now as to the passage 'xptja-Oai . . . etc.,' on which M.
Richet lays such stress. A series of passages, five in number,
VIII. A (two parts) to D, p. 27, were written in M. Richet's
absence. These follow one another closely in the Dictionary.
Four of them have no applicability whatever ; one of them, i.e.
the first part of VIII. A, appears to have some. If we are
to take the exhibition of intelligence as a criterion, why does
the presence of this one appropriate sentence, which possibly
only comes first because it also comes first in the Dictionary,
show intelligence, unless the presence of the other four in
appropriate ones does not equally show no-intelligence ? The
choice of the non-appropriate sentences must admittedly have
been at hap-hazard. Why is the choice of the first not equally
at hap-hazard ? Either the intelligence knew what it was
writing or it did not. If it did, why should the bulk of what
it wrote have no applicability whatever ? And if it did not,
how is it possible to attach any importance to the fact that one
of the sentences it wrote does appear to have a certain appro
priateness ? This appears to us an unanswerable dilemma.
But we would further argue that although this sentence,
"Xpija-Oai, etc.," appears to have some appropriateness, it certainly
has no meaning. What can it possibly mean to say, " You
can when you like use Greek if by chance Latin fails you,"
when the Latin of this very sentence appears on the same
line in the Dictionary, and therefore does not fail anybody ;
and when in any case the obvious choice is not between Greek
and Latin but, as indicated in the letter accompanying the
254 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART
script, between Greek and French ? We suggest that the words
' Graecis ' and ' Latinae ' indicated that the sentence had some
bearing on a choice of language, and therefore prompted the
selection of the sentence for transcription. If it did mean
something, so much the better, aud the control would, as it
has done, make a distinct score. If it did not mean anything,
it would in no way suffer, any more than it has done from
having written all the other sentences which have no meaning
either.
(9) Our argument, then, so far maintains that a number of
short passages might have been picked out—partly at random
and partly for their appropriateness—from the Dictionary and
learnt by heart, and that this could be done by a person
having the knowledge of the letters only. The same can
obviously be said of the quotations from St. John's Gospel.
Once Mme. X. had selected a French sentence from it, she need
have no difficulty in finding the Greek equivalent.
Mrs. Verrall argues that the case is different with the
extracts from Plato : (a) that it would be very difficult to find
these particular phrases in the two Dialogues supposing one
had only an ordinary translation as a guide ; and (6) that the
remarkable appropriateness of the quotations has to be
accounted for.
As to (a) we cannot help thinking that Mrs. Verrall
exaggerates the difficulty of finding the phrases by the help
of a translation. The second quotation from the Apology,
being taken from its last sentence, could, of course, as she
implicitly admits, be found easily. The others would take
much more trouble to find, since they occur in the middle
of the dialogues in question. And as to (fc), this second easily
found quotation is to our mind just the only one which is
really appropriate at all. The sentence from the "Phaedrus"
(script v., p. 206), which Mrs. Verrall considers specially appro
priate to the process of automatic writing, does not, we confess,
impress us as much as it seems to impress her. All that can be
said for it is that it. is more appropriate than the quotations from
Eugene Sue, and less so than that from Cicero. The remaining
phrase (script I., 1st sentence, p. 205), quoted from the "Apology,"
is a vague utterance of a type indifferently appropriate or
inappropriate under almost any conceivable circumstances.
li] Discussion of Professor Richets Case of Xenoglossy. 255
We think, in any case, that Mrs. Verral1's argument somewhat
confuses the issue. It is not, to our mind, a question of finding
one particular appropriate phrase, but of finding a phrase
likely to prove appropriate—obviously a far easier task.
What has to be accounted for, we repeat, in this case as in
those already dealt with, is not that these particular passages
should have been produced, but that some appropriate passages
should be written—a very different as well as an easier thing
to do, and one which demands intelligence only, and no real
knowledge of the language.
The argument against fraud, then, dwindles down to the
difficulty of learning so much Greek by heart. As to Sir
Oliver Lodge's hypothesis that the impression of the Greek
words may have come to Mme. X. in the form of a vision—
like the crystal visions with which we are familiar—abundant
analogies may of course be found for such a supposition, as
we know from records in the Proceedings alone that sensory
hallucinations, whether induced by crystal gazing or occurring
more spontaneously, may take the form of any object whatever,
as well letters or words as anything else. But the form taken
by the impression does not appear to us a matter of any real
significance. The discussion of automatic processes in Human
Personality shows that the question whether an impression
externalises itself as a sensory hallucination or as a motor
impulse, and the question of what particular sensory or
motor effect is produced, depend almost entirely on the
idiosyncrasies of the automatist. Psychologically the form of
the impression is important and interesting, but from the point
of view of psychical research, what we are concerned with
is the content alone. We have only to ask whether or not it
goes provably beyond the knowledge that the medium either
already possesses or could have acquired by normal means.
We do not of course mean to assert that—supposing there
is an external agency concerned in the production of such
phenomena—that agency may not be limited both in knowledge
and in the kind and degree of influence which it is able to
exercise on the medium. Our entire and absolute ignorance of
the matter, in fact, affords scope for any and every speculation
as to what these limitations may be, and it is possible, as Sir
Oliver Lodge suggests, that it may be easier for a control to
R
256 Hon. Everard Feilding and Alice John&on. [PART
,
make use of a printed text, though we think the evidence
for this hypothesis both scanty and dubious. But the assumption
of such an arbitrary limitation of power seems inconsistent
with some crucial features in the case—such as the sub
stitution of Gallia for Hellas, or the occasional conjunc
tion of words or phrases that occur separately in the printed
sources—which would seem to involve wide powers of dealing
and tampering with the text on the part of the control. And
supposing, as Sir Oliver Lodge suggests, that the control
chooses the text from an out-of-the-way and little known
book, so that its source is not detected for a long time, the
phenomenon might, as he says, at its first appearance seem " an
extra good proof of supernormal occurrence," but could not fail
afterwards to appear all the more suspicious. We should then
have to make a further hypothesis to explain it; we should
have to suppose either that the " control " had plotted deliber
ately to cast suspicion on the medium, or that he was so
extraordinarily stupid that he did not see how suspicious it
would look. We feel bound to say that the argument has
an unfortunate resemblance to those with which we are only
too familiar in the domain of spiritualism—the constant asser
tion that the only conditions under which spirits can work
are precisely those which either facilitate fraud or make it
practically impossible to detect it. This may, of course, be
true ; but if it is true, the sooner we leave off wasting our
time in psychical research, the better.
It seems to us, in fact, impossible to construct any con
sistent arid reasonable hypothesis to explain the peculiarities of
Mme. X.'s script on the assumption of limitations of power on
the part of the control ; while it is explained in the simplest
and most obvious manner by supposing that the limitations were
on the part of the automatist, who, being ignorant of Greek, had
access only to two or three Greek books ; who, for the main part
of the script, deliberately chose a rare book (the Byzantios
Dictionary) in hopes of the source of her knowledge escaping
discovery, and who when, notwithstanding this precaution, the
source was detected, then chose a well-known book (the New
Testament) in order to blur the effect of the detection.
e is indeed another possibility which we think should
ignored—the possibility that many of the Greek sen
LI.] Discussion of Professor Richet's Case of Xenoglossy. 257
tences were actually copied at the time from concealed scraps
of paper. It is hardly necessary to point out that it would
account at once for all the mistakes made in what was written
in M. Richet's presence, if the writer had to copy from what
she could see of a paper concealed from her visitor. It
appears, though it is not stated explicitly by M. Richet, that
the sittings were held generally in her own house, where she
would have had every opportunity of making arrangements
and concealing papers to copy from. Extremely small pieces
would clearly have been sufficient for the purpose. Or if she
was not in her own house, a paper might be hidden inside
her sleeve or some other part of her dress, and by some
movement or arrangement be made visible to herself, though
not to a bystander looking in a slightly different direction.
Obvious as this suggestion may appear, we have looked in
vain in M. Richet's paper for any indication that it ever
occurred to him or that any precautions were taken to guard
against the possibility of this or of some similar trick, and
we cannot but regard the omission as a serious evidential
flaw either in the observation or in the record of it.
There is one more general criticism that appears to us of
considerable weight, viz., the absolutely unprecedented nature
of the case. In no other instance of alleged clairvoyance
coming from sources which we have reason to trust do we
find this extraordinary combination of precision in the details
with rigid limitation in their nature.
There are two kinds of cases where analogies might be
expected to be found—cases of experimental telepathy between
the living and cases of purported communications from the
dead. In the former class we never find a series of completely
successful experiments in the least degree comparable in extent
to this Greek script. For instances of our most successful
series, see the experiments of Mr. Guthrie in the telepathic
transference of diagrams in Proceedings, Vols. I., II. and III.
(of which a summary is given in human Personality, Vol. I.,
pp. 601-614), or Mrs. Sidgwick's Brighton experiments, see
especially Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 142-3, and Vol. VIII.,
pp. 540-41 and 556-59. The reader who refers to these
will see how constantly the successes are interspersed with
failures.
258 #07?. Everard Feilding and Alice Johnson. [PART
Of trance experiences in some ways more analogous to Mme.
X.'s, when the automatic speech or writing purports to be
"controlled" by an external intelligence, perhaps the most
remarkable series ever recorded are the "G.P. communications"
of Mrs. Piper (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 295-335), but even
in this we find a considerable mixture of incorrect with correct
statements. It may be argued that the case is not strictly
analogous, since M. Richet does not give us in his paper all
the Renouard " communications," which we may suppose do
exhibit the usual admixture of incorrectness. He does, how
ever, give here all the "communications" of this particular
type—all those, that is, which were given in Greek—and they
are, we repeat, of an absolutely unprecedented kind.
Mrs. Verral1's . analysis brings this out in an even more
startling manner than M. Richet's own account; for it appears
that not only are the words of the Dictionary followed with
extraordinary precision, but even that some of the typographical
peculiarities of the first edition (which there is strong ground
for regarding as the source of most of the quotations) re-appear
in these quotations, e.g. the contracted form of irr and the
peculiar forms of the letters e and K (see above, p. 213);
whereas, in regard to the letter K, it is noteworthy that in
the quotations from the New Testament it is written in the
usual way, viz. that found in most Greek New Testaments.
Mrs. Verrall also states that the stops correspond very closely
to those used in the Dictionary, and even the marks of
omission . . . which occur three times in IX. b are " exactly
reproduced."
Is it possible to conceive of any result more widely different
from what is met with in the best authenticated cases of
trance " communications " than this rigid adherence to a
particular text ? And is it not, on the other hand, just wliat
might be expected to occur, supposing a person ignorant of
Greek desired for some reason to produce Greek writing?
Some other points brought out by Mrs. Verral1's investigations
strongly suggest the work of a careful but ignorant copyist—
viz. the use of, or approximation to, the Roman instead of the
Greek form of some of the letters. Thus the Roman a is always
for a ; the t is dotted six times (though in five cases Mrs.
11 states that the dot seems to be used instead of an
Li.] Discussion of Professor Richets Case of Xenoglossy. 259
accent); the down-stroke of the T is curved round at the bottom,
and once the upright stroke extends above the cross stroke,
turning the letter completely into a Roman t. Again, the
letters are liable to be confused with Roman letters resembling
them. Thus y is written rather like a y ; r\ sometimes with a
short right-hand stroke, like n ; fj. has sometimes a short left-
hand stroke, like u ; v throughout VIII. B is written ?•, like
one written form of r; and v is written twice as u. The kind
of ignorance here shown appears to us to point strongly to a
mundane source for its origin.
To sum up the case, it appears to us that, with the
single exception of the argument based upon Prof. Richet's
strong conviction of the medium's bona fides, there is no
evidence which of itself must compel one to a belief in the
supernormal character of the phenomena. Indeed, the facts
considered by themselves seem to point distinctly, though not,
it is true, inevitably, in the other direction.
We have, in addition to the negative arguments already
adduced, the following positive ones, most of them drawn
from M. Richet's statements :
(1) Mme. X.'s known desire to learn Greek in November,
1899.
(2) The presence of the Greek Dictionary in the library.
(3) The reproduction of some of the typographical pecul
iarities found in this Dictionary.
(4) The evidence that Mme. X. may have known a little
Greek from the substitution of Gallia for Hellas,
and from the production of one of the sentences by
raps.
(5) The evidence of progress in the accuracy of the script:
some of the first seven passages being unintelligible,
and all of them entirely without accents.
(6) The humming of the tune "Souvenez vous en" before
the production of the corresponding Greek phrase.
(7) The fact brought out by Mrs. Verral1's analysis that,
notwithstanding M. Richet's statement to the contrary,
the longest of the passages written in his absence is
much more scholarly than any other of the whole
series.

If it is necessary to assume anything abnormal in the case,
it would seem that the abnormality may consist in nothing
more than an unusually strong and vivid visual memory, the
concentration of which would be assisted by a possibly per
fectly genuine trance. And if we were obliged to suggest any
theory of the genesis of the affair, it would be the following;
that at first, possibly as a kind of jest, possibly from a semi
automatic impulse,1 Madame X. (who had evidently, judging
from the purchase of the Greek exercise books, a notion of
learning Greek and perhaps did get so far as to learn the
Greek alphabet) produced certain Greek phrases. Finding
that these excited serious interest, she kept the game up by
producing more. When to her surprise the passages were all
discovered in the Dictionary, she felt she had gone too far to
retreat, and could not bring herself to admit that she either
possessed or had had access to the Dictionary. Expecting that
tests would then be made, she resorted to a more elaborate
procedure, though even here we have to assume nothing more
than a little trouble taken to learn by heart for the next
sitting one fairly long sentence (IX.) as well as six short
ones (X.-XV.) bearing on probable subjects of conversation,
to be produced when occasion offered. It would not have
been very difficult to do this during the week or two that
elapsed after M. Richet had first mentioned the Dictionary
to her before the sitting of May 2nd. The last of the six
short sentences so selected had, perhaps, struck the medium's
fancy as being identical with the refrain of a song which she
happened to know, and, as remarked above, it looks as if she
1 Some years ago, whether before or after the commencement of the production
of this Greek script cannot, on account of the notes of the incident having
been mislaid, be remembered, Mme. X., in the presence of Mr. Piddington and
Mr. Feilding, went suddenly off into what appeared to be a genuine trance.
In this condition she made signals for paper and pencil, and wrote a short
sentence in what looked like Arabic. The script, on being sent to an Arabic
scholar, was pronounced to be intelligible, but consisted only of a conple of
very familiar words, such as would be found on Oriental carpets or embroideries,
Cairo tea trays, etc. The production of such words, though it could have
no tendency to show the operation of any extraneous Arab intelligence or
supernormal agency, and would therefore be of no ' metapsychical ' importance,
has a certain psychological interest, and would be quite consistent with
complete honesty on the part of Mme. X. It seems not impossible that the
first Greek sentence may have been produced in a similar way.

had hummed this song in M. Richet's presence with a view
to introducing the phrase with apparent appropriateness later.
In conclusion we wish to add that we feel with M.
Bichet the greatest difficulty in reconciling the above tentative
theory with the personal knowledge, slight as it is, which wo
have of Mme. X. And if we venture to put it forward, it is
only because our Society has always regarded it as an im
perative necessity to criticise freely whatever evidence for
supernormal phenomena may be put before it. It is in ac
cordance with this accepted principle that we have ventured
to examine the validity of Professor Richet's argument, our
inability to see the force of which may, after all, be purely
constitutional to ourselves. It may be assumed that our
interest in the phenomena under consideration is of itself suffi
cient to raise in us an earnest hope that the course of events
may prove us wrong, and in anticipation of that happy issue
we offer our apologies to Prof. Richet and Mme. X. for the
content.s of the above article.

RÉPONSE AUX OBSERVATIONS DE M. E. FEILDING
ET DE MLLE. ALICE JOHNSON.
Par M. le Professeur Charles Richet.
Je répondrai brièvement aux observations de M. E. Feilding
et de Madelle Alice Johnson.
Il y a d'abord un point de doctrine qui peut être résolu
en quelques mots. Il s'agit, disent mes critiques, de savoir
si leur explication est plus simple et plus facile (easier)
que la mienne. Ce n'est pas ainsi que la question se
pose : car je ne donne aucune explication. Si j'en donnais une,
je comprendrais fort bien qu'on lui opposât l'argument simple—
voire même simpliste—de la fraude. Mais je ne construis
absolument aucune théorie : de sorte que l'explication par la
fraude n'est ni plus simple, ni plus facile que la mienne;
puisque je n'en donne pas. Là où il n'y a rien, il n'y a pas
lieu de faire une comparaison. Je prétends seulement que cette
explication par la fraude—sans la mettre en balance avec les
autres explications—ne peut pas se soutenir.
Et bien entendu je laisse de côté les objections morales ; et
je ne prends que les objections techniques.
Même, dans ces objections techniques, je ne reviendrai pas sur
divers points de détail. Il est clair en effet qu'il est peu
important de savoir si le dictionnaire de Byzantios est rare ou
commun, si certaines pages sont coupées ou non coupées, et si
le dictionnaire français-grec peut servir, quand on l'étudie à
fond, à construire des phrases s'adaptant aux conditions ex
térieures. Il est évident aussi que l'écriture tremblée ne prouve
que l'inexpérience de l'écriture. Rien de moins ; rien de plus.
Ce qui est essentiel, le voici, sous forme de syllogisme
rigoureux.
(1) Mad. X. ne sait pas le grec.
(2) Les phrases qu'elle a écrites sont des phrases reproduites
par mémoire visuelle, et non par mémoire phonétique.
(3) Or il n'est pas possible de supposer que la mémoire
visuelle soit assez puissante pour fournir de longues phrases,.
Li.] Reply to the Hon. E. Feilding and A. Johnson. 263
dont le sens est incompris, et qui ne se révèlent que par de
purs signes visuels.
Je vais démontrer successivement ces trois points.
(1°) Mad. X. ne sait pas le grec. Sur ce point l'argumentation
de Mad. Verrall est décisive. MM. F. et J. sont forcés de le
reconnaître (she knows extremely little). Mais cet extrêmement
peu de grec est si peu que ce n'est rien. Les efforts que Mad.
X. a faits pour apprendre le grec se sont bornés à faire acheter
deux livres grecs scolaires par une de ses amies, et à ne pas
les regarder. Il n'y a d'ailleurs, dans ces deux livres, aucun
alphabet qui permette d'apprendre les lettres. (Je sais par
faitement qu'on peut se procurer sans peine un alphabet grec.)
Et puis, si réellement Mad. X. eût voulu me dissimuler
qu'elle avait fait emplette de ces deux livres, rien ne lui
eût été plus facile. Elle eût sans effort pu cacher ces deux
minuscules volumes ; et supprimé alors un argument qui parait
important à MM. F. et J. (1. Mad. X.'s desire to learn Greek).
(2e) Les phrases sont de l'écriture lue, et non phonétiquement
prononcée.
Le fait est capital et mérite toute notre attention.
D'abord je ne comprends pas comment MM. F. et J. peuvent
dire qu'il n'existe, dans le cas actuel, que peu d'exemples établis
sant que la reproduction s'est faite par la mémoire visuelle. En
réalité toutes les lettres ont été reproduites par mémoire visuelle.
PaT exemple, quand il y a " . . . oXa etc. . . . " et que le texte
grec porte "... 6\a etc. ..." il est évident que ces deux
points qui précèdent et ces deux points qui suivent ne répondent
à aucun phonétisme, mais seulement à un fait de représentation
visuelle. De même pour tous les accents, sans exception. Si l'on
ne peut pas citer beaucoup de mots où la représentation visuelle
se révèle avec éclat, c'est que, toutes les fois que la copie est
exacte, on ne saurait décider s'il s'agit de phonétisme ou de
visualisation. Mais alors pourquoi les accents ? Pourquoi y
a-t-il tov KAw&Woy exactement comme dans le texte, alors
que la mémoire phonétique eût pu faire écrire, par celui qui
ignore le grec, aussi bien Tôv K.\wStovoç que tov K.XwSlwvoç ?
Et pareille argumentation peut se répéter pour tous les mots
sans exception.
De sorte qu'il est évident que tout a été écrit par visualisation,
et non par phonétisme.
264 Professor Charles Richet. [part
Donc nul doute sur ce point. Ce n'est pas par phonétisme
qu'il y a eu mémoire représentative, c'est par visualisation.
Or est-il possible de concevoir une mémoire assez étendue
pour reproduire des signes visuels (et dépourvus de sens, puisque
Mad. X. ne sait pas le grec), en aussi grand nombre et avec
une telle perfection ?
Je suggérerai à MM. F. et J. une expérience simple qu'ils
pourront faire sur eux-mêmes ; c'est uniquement de prendre trois
lignes d'un livre arabe, par exemple, de faire travailler là dessus
leur mémoire pendant plusieurs heures, et en tous loisirs,
puis ensuite, le même jour, de reproduire ces signes avec assez
de précision pour qu'ils puissent être lus par un Arabe.
Quoique je sois doué d'une fort bonne mémoire, je déclare
pour ma part qu'il me serait tout à fait impossible de repro
duire de mémoire une seule ligne. Et que l'on songe alors
que Mad. X. a écrit ainsi par visualisation, le 2 Mai, toute
une série de phrases.1 Cela fait 622 signes, assez correcte
ment écrits pour qu'il soit difficile à un copiste, d'habileté
moyenne, de faire aussi peu de fautes.
Et alors je conclurai en disant : Reproduire, uniquement par
visualisation, 622 signes, cela dépasse les bornes de la mémoire
humaine. Jusqu'à ce que l'on m'ait montré un pareil prodige,
je persisterai à trouver l'hypothèse d'une mémoire extraordi-
nairement suractivée, comme dénuée de toute autorité..
D'ailleurs je trouve cet aveu dans la remarque que sont
'contraints de faire MM. F. et J. " The abnormality lies in
an unusually strong and vivid visual memory." Et à la
vérité je ne puis affirmer autre chose, en tant qu'il s'agit de
•discuter les conditions techniques. Mais on avouera qu'une
hyperacuité de la mémoire, telle qu'on n'en saurait pas citer
d'exemple, ne peut servir d'explication à un phénomène déjà
rendu invraisemblable, à priori, par l'ensemble des conditions
morales où il s'est produit.2
1 MM. F. et J. supposent avec raison que j'ai pris toutes précautions pour
•empêcher qu'il y eût une page quelconque écrite par avance, dissimulée p*r
Mad. X., et qu'il lui eût été loisible de copier devant moi.
2 Si l'on fait cette supposition d'une hyperacuité de la mémoire, il faut
ajouter sa persistance pendant un temps prolongé. Car Mad. X., qui a été
très rarement à la Bibliothèque nationale avant 1900, depuis cette époque n'y
est pas retournée, ainsi que je puis le prouver.
Les cartes délivrées par la direction de la Bibliothèque nationale de Paris
sont de deux ordres. Il y a les cartes données pour un jour, et renouvelées
Li.] Reply to the Hon. E. Feikling and A. Johnson. 265
Ainsi nous arrivons à cette conclusion qu'on est forcé, en tout
«tat de cause, d'admettre un phénomène anormal, à savoir une
mémoire visuelle d'une intensité telle qu'elle est jusqu'à
présent totalement inconnue. Mais il faut alors reconnaître
que ce n'est pas une explication rationnelle. On doit con
sidérer comme rationnel ce qui est établi par l'expérience ;
or nulle expérience n'a jusqu'ici prouvé que la mémoire visuelle
peut reproduire vingt-cinq lignes d'une langue inconnue.
Il est un autre élément d'appréciation sur lequel n'insistent
guère MM. E. F. et A. J. Mais j'y insisterai ; car il est de
majeure importance. C'est la phrase qui est traduite de
Cicéron ; et dans laquelle le texte latin et le texte grec sont
seuls donnés, de sorte que Mad. X., qui ne connait pas le latin,
a écrit la phrase grecque, sans savoir quel en était le sens.
quand on le demande. De celles-là il n'est pas tenu registre. Il y a aussi
les cartes régulières dont on tient compte et qu'on classe. D'après une lettre
que m'adresse le directeur de la Bibliothèque nationale, il n'y a pas eu de
carte régulière délivrée à Mad. X. de 1894 à 1904. Si donc elle a été à la
Bibliothèque nationale, c'a été avec une carte délivrée pour un jour.
D'autre part, en interrogeant Mad. X., j'ai appris d'elle—ce que j'avais
indiqué d'ailleurs, mais avec moins de certitude—qu'elle n'avait pas été travailler
à la Bibliothèque nationale depuis 1899.
De fait, elle m'a dit n'y avoir été qu'une fois, et elle m'a montré à cet effet
son Diary, de 1899. Le 2 Février, 1899, elle note la visite du Father X. qui
lni donne une carte d'entrée pour la Bibliothèque nationale et le 9 Février,
1899, il est noté sur son Diary qu'elle va à la Bibliothèque nationale pour
consulter " Morley on Diderot."
Le Diary est muet sur toute autre visite ultérieure à la Bibliothèque nationale
et Mad. X. dit qu'elle n'y est pas retournéo ; ce qui est confirmé par ce fait
qu'elle n'a pas demandé ni obtenu de carte régulière.
11 parait donc bien évident que, depuis le mois de Février, 1899, Mad. X.
n'a pas pu consulter à la Bibliothèque nationale le Dictionnaire de Byzantios,
de sorte que, si l'on fait cette hypothèse, toute gratuite d'ailleurs, que les
pagee du Dictionnaire français-grec ont été coupées par elle, c'a été en 1899 ;
ce qui rend plus extraordinaire encore la persistance de la mémoire visuelle
jusqu'au mois de Mai, 1905, pour toute une longue série de longues phrases.
Au fond cela n'a pas grande importance ; car, si l'on fait l'hypothèse (absurde
à mon sens) de la fraude, il est beaucoup plus simple de supposer que Mad. X.
a acheté quelque part le Dictionnaire de Byzantios, qu'elle l'a soigneusement
caché, pour pouvoir le consulter, le méditer et l'étudier à loisir ; c'est plus
simple, dis-je, que de supposer des visites à la Bibliothèque nationale.
Mais toute une série d'objections se présente alors. Pourquoi acheter ce
livre étrange, introuvable, rarissime ? Où le cacher pendant cinq ans ? Pourquoi
ne pas en donner d'autres extraits de 1900 à 1904? Et où l'Apologie de
Socrate? Et où le Phèdre? Et où l'Evangile? C'est toute une bibliothèque
secrète !
266 Professor Charles Richet. [part
Si cette phrase était insignifiante, cela ne prouverait rien ;
mais il se trouve justement que cette phrase s'applique, en toute
précision, à ce qui suit.
Comment ! Voici Mad. X. qui m'adresse un document en
écriture grecque ; et au début de ce document il est dit, en
grec : II est permis de se servir de caractères grecs quand on n'a
pas de caractères latins sous la main. Est-il possible de
soutenir que cette phrase ne s'applique pas, en toute rigueur,
à l'envoi de documents écrits en grec?1
Assurément on peut invoquer le hasard. Mais cette ex
plication, si c'en est une, est trop facile pour qu'on en fasse
usage dans une discussion scientifique.
Je me résume, et je conclus.
L'explication que proposent MM. F. et J. est fondée sur
trois propositions liées l'une à l'autre, et toutes trois nécessaires.
(a) Il y a eu fraude prolongée, astucieuse, délibérée, permanente.
Or toutes les conditions morales sont contre cette supposition,
puisque la seule et unique raison qu'on invoque pour la soutenir,
c'est l'étrangeté du phénomène produit.
(b) Il y a eu une suractivité prodigieuse de la mémoire visuelle.
Or jusqu'à présent une pareille hyperacuité de la mémoire
n'a encore été observée sur personne. C'est donc faire une
hypothèse invraisemblable que d'admettre un phénomène dont
on n'a pas encore trouvé d'exemple.
(c) Il y a eu des hasards heureux, qui ont fait rencontrer
précisément les mots et les phrases qui devaient être écrits.
Or le hasard, en fait d'explication scientifique, n'existe pas.
Plutôt que d'admettre ces trois concomitantes absurdités, fraude,
hasard, et mémoire supranaturelle, j'aime mieux tout simplement
déclarer que je ne comprends pas.
De sorte que ma conclusion, qu'il s'agit d'un phénomène
inexpliqué,—et je n'ai jamais prétendu davantage—reste absolu
ment intacte.2
1 La traduction de la phrase de Cicéron—Graecis licet utare, cum voit*, «» It
latinae forte deficiant. "You can when you like use Greek if by chance Latin
fails you "—n'est peut-être pas tout à fait exacte ; car c'est plutôt le mot
lilteris que le mot verbis qui est sous-entendu. 11 est vrai que graeeii litleri*
peut dire aussi bien des mots grecs, que des caractères grecs.

SUPPLEMENT.
The Goulstonian Lectures for 1901. Certain Mental Changes
that Accompany Visceral Disease. By HENRY HEAD, M.U.,
F.R.S. (Reprinted from Brain, Vol. XXIV., Part III., 1901.)
London: John Bale, Sons & Danielsson, Ltd. 1901.
These lectures should have received an earlier notice in the
Proceedings, for, though addressed primarily to the physician,
they have an important bearing on a subject of special
interest for our Society.
It has long been recognised, Dr. Head points out, that
grave mental changes often arise in connection with visceral
diseases. Delirium, for instance, is directly traceable to a
failing heart, the hebetude of myxoedema to a diseased con
dition of the thyroid gland, and morbid mental states follow
toxic poisoning of the blood due to disease of some excreting
organ.
But what had not been formerly recognised is that certain
well-marked and characteristic changes in consciousness may
be traced to the effects of the reflected pains of visceral
disease. To Dr. Henry Head belongs the credit of this
discovery.1
1Professor Charles Lasigue had, indeed, long before published the following
observations: — "C'est surtout dans les affections mitrales que le cauchemar
s'observe : le sommeil, dans sa periode il'etat, [i.e. between 1 and 3 a.m. : the
third and most stable period of sleep, according to Prof. Lasi'gue's ' chronology
of sleep '] est trouble par de la peur, de 1'anxi^te, de 1'augoisse non respiratoire
ft des hallucination visuelles. Ces dernieres n'ont pas analogic avec celles des
alcooliquea : 1'alcoolique voit tonjours 1'objet en mouvement et lui donne
immediatement une signification ; le cardiaque ne precise pas, il reste dans le
vague, et, malgr^ ses efforts, n'arrive pas a donner uu corps a son hallucination :
il devient alors fort anxieux." Etttde-i Mtdicalts, Le Sommeil, p. 442.
But on a passing reference of this kind could hardly be based a claim of
priority of discovery ; nor can the parenthetical observations of Prof. Lasegne,
268 J. G. Piddington. [PART
These changes in consciousness are moods of depression and
of exaltation ; a state of unreasonable suspicion ; and hallucina
tions of vision, hearing, and smell. It is with the last class
only that this review is concerned.
. Dr. Head's investigations extended over a period of some
seven or eight years. In all he had under observation 192
cases of men and women suffering from some form of visceral
disease : chiefly pulmonary, cardiac, or abdominal. The patients
were inmates of the Victoria Park Hospital for Diseases of
the Chest and of the London Hospital, and belonged to the
usual hospital class. No patient who had been insane, or
who was at the time suffering from any form of nervous
disease, or who was suspected of alcoholic excess or of here
ditary taint of insanity or epilepsy was included in the
investigation.
This was a natural and proper precaution, but Dr. Head
was not content to stop there, for he went to the length of
excluding " all Hebrews, owing to the recognised tendency of
this race to functional neuroses." I would not regard this
precaution as over-scrupulous. But Dr. Head might, without
confusing the main issue, have adopted the less drastic and
more instructive plan of dealing separately with the Jewish
cases, which could afterwards have been compared with the
results obtained with patients of other nationalities ; and then,
had any marked divergence between the two been shown to-
exist, we might have learned whether a racial tendency ta
functional neuroses renders a member of the Jewish race
more liable or less liable to hallucinations of the senses when
suffering from visceral disease. Furthermore, Dr. Head was
careful to exclude all experiences which might have had an
objective basis (i.e. illusions), and also " illusions hypnagogiqufs."
In every case Dr. Head interrogated the patients himself,
himself took the notes, and, except towards the end of the
investigation, when it was desirable to have his observations
controlled by others, he took care to question his patients in
privacy ; for they were reticent as to their experiences and
afraid of being thought madmen or liars. Psychical Researchers
who speaks of cardiac disease only and does not note the connection between
iflected pain of visceral origin and the hallucinations, be held to rank with
Head's exhaustive and systematic study.
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian lectures. 269
often have to circumvent similar reticences, though sometimes,
it must be admitted, it is rather an exuberant and irrepressible
effusiveness which makes their task a difficult one.
I will now try to state, in as brief and simple a manner
as I can, the conclusions to which his researches led Dr.
Head: conclusions which I am not competent to criticise, but
which cannot, I imagine, in View of the thoroughness which
marks his work, fail to meet with the acceptance of medical
men.
The main factor underlying the production of all the mental
changes in question, viz. moods of depression and of exalta
tion, states of unreasonable suspicion, and hallucinations of the
senses, is the presence of reflected visceral pain of considerable
intensity and duration, accompanied by superficial tenderness.
But the causes underlying each separate form of these
mental changes can be further differentiated ; and each will
be found to appear, usually if not invariably, in relation to
certain well-defined varieties of reflected visceral pain.
Thus the depressed mood is specially associated with pain
and tenderness over the abdominal areas. The sense of ex
altation or of exaggerated well-being may arise from various
causes. It may be no more than a reaction from a preceding
mood of depression,—such alternations of feeling-tone being
specially pronounced in the case of sufferers from visceral
pain—or it may be due to the patient's ignorance of the
gravity of his condition, or, in disease of the aortic valves, to
attacks of excitement of apparently vascular origin. The state
of suspicion is merely a development of the mood of depression
or of ill-being which invariably precedes or accompanies it.
We come now to the last and most important class—most
important, as affording evidence of the most obvious and
unmistakable deviation from the normal—I mean, hallucina
tions of the senses.
Hallucinations are always preceded by the appearance of
the depressed mood : but, though the same rule applies,
visual hallucinations are not necessarily contemporaneous with
an attack of depression.
Probably headache is the only necessary concomitant of the
hallucinations; for in every case where Dr. Head was able to
make a complete examination of the patient within 24 hours
270 i/. G. Piddington. [PART
of the occurrence of a hallucination, scalp tenderness of the
reflected visceral type was found to be present : and herpes
zoster ophthalmicus, a disease (not of visceral origin) involving
intense pain over the forehead, but not necessarily preceded nor
accompanied by marked depression, is liable to produce visual
hallucinations. If, in addition to headache of the reflected
visceral type, there is similar *pain and tenderness over the
trunk, the tendency to hallucination is increased.
But here the question presents itself: What determines
whether the hallucination shall be visual, auditory or olfactory ?
An analysis of the cases where a hallucination occurred
during the patient's stay in hospital has convinced Dr. Head
that no permanent error in the sense organ implicated was
responsible for the form of the hallucination, and has led him
to suggest tentatively that the sense affected depends on the
position of the headache and on the area of the accompanying
scalp tenderness. Thus, visual hallucinations are mainly
associated with tenderness over the forehead ; auditory halluci
nations with tenderness over the parietal and vertical regions ;
and olfactory hallucinations with tenderness over the temporal
area of the scalp.
My next task is to enumerate, as far as possible in Dr.
Head's own words, the main characteristic features of hallu
cinations that accompany visceral disease, and at the same
time to enquire to what extent the same features appear
in the hallucinations of the sane and healthy collected by the
S.P.B. For the purpose of this enquiry I shall but seldom
go outside the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, and I
make this large use of the Census Report partly for con
venience of reference, and partly because it comprises cases of
so widely representative a character that it rarely fails to
furnish the needed parallel or antithesis.
But as the comparison and discussion on which I am
about to embark will involve me in an amount of detail
which is likely to seem excessive and tedious, I should like,
by way of apology, to preface them by an explanation of the
motives which have led me to undertake them.
A friend, who first drew my attention to these lectures,
gave me to understand that the hallucinations of persons
suffering from visceral disease, as described by Dr. Head, showed
u.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 271
damaging points of resemblance to the hallucinations of the
supposedly sane and healthy, as represented in the Society's
collection of cases. I accordingly took up Dr. Head's lectures
in some trepidation. It is true that a hasty perusal was
sufficient to dissipate any misgivings, but others, who, like
my friend, have not made a close study of the class of
hallucinations with which our Society is specially concerned,
might not so readily detect how non-essential such resemblances
as do exist between the two really are. For their benefit
primarily I have undertaken to work out in detail the
resemblances and differences.
In the second place, it seemed to me that a comparison of
the hallucinations of the sane and healthy with those of the
sane and unhealthy was likely to prove of interest for its
own sake.
Thirdly, although Dr. A. T. Myers " carefully considered "
the 146 cases of hallucination reported in the Census Collection
in which a certain degree of ill-health was reported, and
" gave special attention to their medical aspect, so far as
this could be judged from the information given," we are
acquainted only with the results of his labours, and are not
allowed to follow step by step the process by which the
Committee, acting on his advice, rejected some and retained
others of these particular cases. As, then, the Census Report
did not provide any detailed comparison of the hallucinations
of persons in good health with those of persons in disease,
such a comparison, even though restricted, as here, to one
special—albeit a very large and comprehensive—group of
diseases, seems to me to be worth the making.
In the fourth place, at the time when the Census Report
was published the medical world did not know of (and did
not even, I believe, suspect) the association of certain changes
in consciousness, among which hallucinations occupy a prominent
place, with the reflected pains of visceral disease. Moreover,
the Committee, while rejecting 23 cases as being clearly due
to a morbid physical condition, retained 123 cases of halluci
nations experienced during a state of illness when the morbid
conditions were such as were not then known to be associated
generally with hallucination. " In 21 of them, says the
Report, the percipient was in a state of convalescence after
s
272 J. 0. Piddington. [pabt
some illness,—the nature of which is not always specified, but
which was apparently acute,—or recovering from a recent
operation, or on the verge of a severe illness. In 55 cases
the percipient was in a state of depressed health or minor
illness—e.g. ' in a nervous dyspeptic condition? ' in a very low
state of health' ' bronchitis with weakness of heart '—the con
dition being one with which hallucinations are not supposed to be
generally associated, though it may have rendered the patient
more liable to them than a person in normal health would be.
There remain 4-7 cases of still slighter indisposition than the
above, such as being ' a little below par, and somewhat nervous
and excited' where it seems very doubtful whether the physical
condition had any share in producing the hallucination." (Pro
ceedings, Vol. X., p. 160.)
Now, especially among the 55 cases mentioned above,
it seemed to me far from unlikely that there might be some
which were due to reflected pain of visceral origin : such,
for instance, as the hallucination experienced by the percipient
suffering " from bronchitis with weakness of heart."
Again, the Report states (p. 161) that "in 780 first-hand
cases (that is, 48 per cent.), no statement at all is made as
to health." The Committee, it is true, were of opinion that
" the tendency was rather to exaggerate than to overlook any
possible connection that there may have been between the
hallucination and the state of health at the time." With this
opinion I find myself so far in agreement as to have little
doubt that had a person experienced a hallucination within
a few days of an attack of, say, typhoid or scarlet fever he
would, in answering the Census questionnaire, have drawn
attention to the probable connection between the two events.
But visceral diseases are less abrupt and more insidious in
their onset, and may remain undetected and unsuspected for
many a month ; and even if already causing some degree of
discomfort or uneasiness, might easily be dismissed in all
good faith by the person affected in some such phrase as "a
little below par," or " in a very low state of health."
On this ground, then, an advocatus diaboli might argue that
many a case out of the 780 where the percipient gave no
account of his state of health, and even a few out of the
719 cases where the percipient positively affirmed his state of
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 273
health to be good, ought properly to have been rejected, as
being outside the scope of the Census, the aim of which
was to ascertain the proportion of persons who " have had
sensory hallucinations while awake, and not suffering from
delirium or insanity or any other morbid condition obviously
conducive to hallucination."
Now supposing that an examination conducted in the light
of the new facts which Dr. Head has contributed to medical
science should justify the criticism of my imaginary devi1's
advocate, what would the effect be ? It might result in a large
number of the so-called " purely subjective " cases having to be
discounted, and yet might leave the " coincidental " cases un
touched. But such a result would be improbable, for coincidental
appear to be distinguished from subjective hallucinations solely
by their greater impressiveness and by their greater liability to
affect more than one sense. These by themselves are but flimsy
differentiae ; and if in other respects many of the coincidental
hallucinations were found to show affinity to hallucinations
of the visceral type, there would be left only their "veridicality"
to explain away ; and that would not be a difficult task for
destructive criticism to achieve, once granted that the characteristic
feature-s of the hallucinations associated with visceral disease
were found to be present in coincidental cases.
(It is true that such affinity would not in itself explain away
the coincidences if they were sufficiently numerous and definite;
but it would very strongly suggest that the percipients in these
particular coincidental cases were suffering from a visceral disease,
and were therefore liable to repeated hallucinations (v. XV.,
p. 323); and that accordingly the coincidences were due to
chance and not to any telepathic action. This argument would
do no more than make the justifiable assumption that the per
cipients had forgotten or deliberately ignored the considerable
number of their hallucinations with which no coincidence had
been traced.)
One aim, therefore, of this review is to forestall any such
attack ; and a defence to be satisfactory—satisfactory, at least
to me, who, like the Sosnik in Maxim Gorky's tale, " live
on worms and like facts"—must rely not on broad denials
based on broader generalisations, but on a minute and thorough
going dissection of the evidence.
274 J. G. Piddington. [PART
For the sake of brevity I shall speak of persons suffering
from visceral diseases generally and of Dr. Head's patients
in particular as " Visceral Patients," of their hallucinations as
" Visceral Hallucinations," and of the type of their hallucina
tions as the " Visceral type " ; of persons of whose experiences
an account has been contributed to the S.P.H., and especially
to the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, as " Psychical
Percipients," and of their hallucinations as " Psychical Hallucina
tions." I do not attempt to defend these barbarous terms
on any ground whatever except that of convenience.
All references to Vol. X. of the S.P.R. Proceedings (which
contains the Report on the Census of Hallucinations) are given
thus: e.g. (232); meaning S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 232.
Each section and subsection is prefaced by a heading printed
in block type. All but three of these headings are quotations
from Dr. Head's lectures ; one is based on statements contained
in the lectures, and the remaining two explain themselves.
In these quotations printed in block type are set forth the
chief characteristics of Visceral Hallucinations ; and, as it will
be easier to follow what I have to say if these are first
grasped, I would recommend the reader to begin by studying
them without reference to the intervening matter.
Passages placed within quotation marks and printed in
italics are verbatim quotations from the Report on the Census
of Hallucinations. Passages printed in italics but not placed
within quotation marks are paraphrases of extracts from the
same Report.
Where I have not brought out in detail the differences
between a Psychical Hallucination and the Visceral type of
Hallucination, and have contented myself with stating that
no real similarity between the two exists, I have given the
reference to the former, and so enabled the reader to check
my statement in each case.
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 275
VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS.
I. " The commonest form assumed by the Hallucination in these
" i.e visual] cases is that of a figure." '
" Most visual hallucinations represent human beings." (113)
To this statement the following foot-note is appended :
"In the present collection, \ie. the S.P.R. Census Collection]
830 out 0/1112 do so. Mr. Gurney found that in his collection,
out of 302 subjective visual hallucinations, only 20 represented
objects other than human beings. (See Phantasms of the Living,
Vol. L, p. 503.)"
But of hallucinations occurring during ill-health, the Com
mittee reported : " The proportion of realistic human apparitions
(69 out of the 106 visual cases) is, however, distinctly small.
And the non-realistic apparitions include a disproportionately
large number (namely, 9), of grotesque, horrible, or monstrous
apparitions." (161)
I. (a) " Neither arms nor legs are seen."
" The limbs are never visible."
" When they [the phantoms] move, . . . the movement is almost
always such as we are accustomed to see. The phantom stands
on the ground and appears to walk along the ground." (114)
In Census cases legs are not often specifically referred
to ; but their absence is not remarked, even in cases of
" incompletely developed apparitions " ; and in one such case
it so happens that specific reference is made to the arms :
"the arms were crossed." (119-120)
I have noted only three cases among apparitions not
classed as " incompletely developed " where doubt was expressed
as to the figure possessing legs and feet.
Mr. E. Mamtchitch, describing the first of many appear
ances of a figure which he calls Palladia, writes : " Je vogais
distinctement ses epaules et sa faille, mais ne me rappelle pas
1Where, as here, the heading of a section or sub-section is immediately
followed, without explanation or comment, by a quotation in italics, it should
be understood that I am contrasting in a broad and general way the
characteristics of Visceral Hallucinations with those of Psychical Hallucinations,
as summed up respectively in Dr. Head's treatise and in the Report on the
Cennu of Hallucinationt.
276 [PART

du las de son habit, et avais-je vu les pieds ?—-pent-tire, paree
que tout le temps je lui regardais dans les yeux." (388)
And in a resv.md of the leading characteristics of the appear
ances he adds :
" Je vois distinctement son visage, sa tdte, les dpaules et Us
bras, mais je ne vois pas ses pieds, ou plutdt je n'ai pas If
temps de les examiner." (389)
But so widely do the experiences of Mr. Mamtchitch differ
in almost every other respect from those of Dr. Head's patients
that by no ingenuity could his case be forced into line with
Visceral cases : and Mr. Mamtchitch's doubts are, I incline to
think, those of an exceptionally scrupulous observer. How
often would one in a normal state, after seeiug a real live
flesh-and-blood figure of man or woman, be able to decide on
examination of one's recollections whether one had seen the legs
or feet unless something had specially drawn attention to them ]
In the second case (293-5), after a conversation with
the percipient, Mrs. Sidgwick writes :—" She did not see the
figure clearly at all below the knees." The case, a coinci
dental one, compares as follows with the Visceral type :
Resemblances.
Figure did not speak (v. I.
m).1
Percipient felt riveted.
Percipient's heart and pulses
beat unnaturally fast (but only
after disappearance of figure)
(v. V).
Apparition seen near the
door (v. I. h).
Figure " melted away" with
out movement (v. I. k).
Seen by percipient when in
bed (v. I. i).
1These and similar references enclosed in brackets allude to the various
section-headings. If the reader will turn to them he will at once aee why I
class some features as resembling, and others as differing from the characteristic
features of Visceral hallucinations. Let, for instance, the reader look up the
reference to I. m. He will there learn that the hallucinatory figures seen by
Visceral patients never speak. In the case under discussion above the figure
did not speak. Absence of speech, accordingly, is a common element, and is
classed as a 'resemblance.'
Differences.
Percipient" remarkably well ":
and "not much frightened" (v.
V.)-1
Apparition seen in a sort of
halo of light.
Face and hands clearly seen
(«. I. a).
Figure in ordinary clothes
(v. I. 6).
Figure and its sex recog
nised (v. I. e and VIII.).
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 277
In the third case (309-10) the figure was apparently entirely
visible to one percipient, but to another percipient who shared
the hallucination visible only " from the waist up."
Resemblances.
Figure's head " tied up in a
handkerchief" (v. I. b).
One percipient"horrified," the
other fainted (v. V.).
Differences.
Both percipients " in good
health and spirits."
Figure moved across room
(v. I. K).
Figure and its sex recognised
(v. I. e and VIII.).
Bisensory, tactile and visual,
in case of one percipient (v.
XVII. and XVIIL).
Collective (v. XVIIL).
Yet in spite of these exceptions there can be no doubt
that the majority of Psychical Percipients either saw the legs
of the figures or failed to notice their absence. Skirts and
trousers are mentioned specifically, and though skirts and
trousers are not legs, still as they cover the places where
legs ought to be, it would be unfair not to infer that they
hid spectral legs from view.
Arms and movements of arms are frequently mentioned.
But the point is really met by the constant insistence of
Psychical Percipients on the life-like completeness of the figures
which they saw.
A proportionately greater number of instances of limbless
figures probably exists in the specially marked class of incom
pletely developed hallucinations, with regard to which the
Committee write:—
" They are either shadowy, vague, transparent, or colourless ;
or they represent part only of the human form, the rest being
conspicuously absent {not merely apparently hidden by inter
vening objects.)"
With regard to these incompletely developed apparitions,
however, it should be borne in mind that the Committee were
careful to explain that they classed them among the " doubt
ful experiences." A certain proportion of them they excluded
from their Tables, and that they did not exclude more may
be attributed chiefly to their desire to avoid the charge of
278 J. G. Piddington. [PAKT
having unfairly reduced the number of non-coincidental halluci
nations.
I. (5). " The figure appears to be draped and not clothed.
Patients are unanimous that the figure is unlike anything that
they have ever seen and they are peculiarly definite in
describing it as ' draped,' ' wrapped in a shawl,' ' wrapped in
a sheet.' . . . The head may he covered."
" As far as the reports as to dress enable us to judge, phan
toms, both recognised and unrecognised, generally appear in
ordinary modern dress. The great majority of hallucinations
are like the sights we are accustomed to see." (113)
Again, here, as in the case of limbless figures, the few
cases of shrouded or draped figures which do occur in the
Census collection are to be found almost entirely among the
imperfectly developed class, in which, says the Report (118),
were placed " veiled and shrouded apparitions even when quite
solid looking." Yet even these cases do not necessarily con
form completely to the Visceral type. The two cases of the
kind quoted as illustrations in the Report (119-120) both
exhibit some points of divergence. In the first case a lady,
who reports herself as having been at the time in good health,
saw a "draped and shrouded figure standing near" her. The
face she could not see, because " it was shrouded " ; the head
was bent, and the figure, which did not move nor speak,
gradually faded away. But note the distinctions from the
Visceral type : the arms were seen and said to be crossed ;
it was a solitary experience, and, though a solitary experience,
no mention is made of fright (v. V.). On the contrary, the
percipient writes : " I thought it might be some one with a
message to me, and sat quietly waiting for it to speak."
(For further comments on this case, v. XIX.) In the second
case the percipient had seen a hallucinatory figure three times
in the course of two or three years. The figure " always
appeared in the same way ; that is, on getting into bed and
putting the light out, there would be a sort of movement in the
air, which gradually took the form of mist and then developed
into a dark veiled figure, which came nearer to me, and when
bending over and about to touch me, I threw my lutnds into it
and it vanished. Until it was almost touching me, my
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 279
toas so great that I could neither call my sister, . . . nor move
hand or foot." In addition to the figure being shrouded, there
are two other points of resemblance to the Visceral type,
namely, the terror and the dissipation of the figure by move
ment on the part of the percipient (v. I. h). But, per contra
the figure was not stationary (v. I. h), and the percipient says,
" I have always been in good health."
Only 19 cases of a veiled or shrouded figure are to be
found in the Census collection. A case is recorded (204-5)
where two sisters collectively felt a hallucinatory touch on the
face, while one of them thought she saw a figure, ; this joint
experience being followed a week or so later by both awaking
from sleep with a sense of some one being present in the room.
Then, again, after an interval of some days, one sister saw "a
very vague muffled form or shadow ; and lastly, on another
occasion" the other sister "saw a vague form." The figure appar
ently on each occasion took the same course, namely, appeared
standing between the two beds and then passed from one to the
other. Great terror VMS felt by both sisters. The terror (v. V.),
the vagueness of the figure, and perhaps the movement (v. I. A),
accord with the Visceral type ; but, on the other hand, the
collectivity of the tactile hallucination, and of the sense of
presence, the apparent identity of the two visual experiences,
together with the improbability of two percipients, who both
report their health at the time as good, being both in the
incipient stages of some disease of visceral origin, make it
impossible to consider their experiences as attributable to
visceral disease.
I. (c). " The face is frequently misty."
" The face is frequently not visible."
It is unnecessary to labour this point. Any one who will
take no more trouble than to scan either the Census Report or
the S.P.R. Proceedings or Journal passim will readily discover
that mistiness of the face is emphatically not a trait of S.P.R.
apparitions, and that 'Psychical Percipients again and again
insist on the distinctness of the features of the hallucinatory
figure. Only 6 cases in which the face or head of the figure
was certainly indistinct or invisible occur in the Census col
lection ; and these, again, were all placed in the class of
280 J. G. Piddington. [PART
incompletely developed apparitions. The one instance quoted
in the Report (120-1) as an example of this small group was
an experience of Mrs. Verrall; and it is to be noted that the
percipient, although at the time of seeing the figure she had
no reason to suppose herself not to be well, had had " a short
illness some two weeks earlier, due, it was thought, to over-
fatigue, after some weeks of considerable strain in other
respects." Mrs. Verrall saw the figure several times within a
period of 4 or 5 weeks, and although able to distinguish
details of its dress, and particularly of a brooch fastening a
grey knitted shawl covering the shoulders of the figure, and
although the figure always walked towards her, yet she could
never see the face : " there seemed a blank within the cap."
But the case differs markedly in several points from the
Visceral type :
(1) The appearance of the figure was twice accompanied by
the sound of footsteps (v. I. f).
(2) It was once certainly, and on other occasions probably,
seen in good light (v. IV.).
(3) It " was always in movement " (v. I. h).
(4) It was unhesitatingly recognised as a female figure
(•. I. s).
(5) It was seen neither at the moment of waking nor
when the percipient was in bed (v. I. -i.).
(6) The percipient " was neither startled nor alarmed "
(v. V.), and " knew at once that it was a hallucination."
In addition to the above the Report contains two probable
instances of invisibility of the face, both in Local Apparition
cases.
In the first case (352-6) there were seven percipients in
all, and the figure was seen collectively by two or three of
them on more than one occasion. The face was certainly not
seen by the majority, either because of the general indistinct
ness of the figure or because the head was turned away ; and
the want of precision in the evidence leaves it doubtful whether
even a single one of the percipients ever saw the face.
Similarly, in the second case (344-6), also collective and
recurrent, it remains uncertain how many of the percipients
saw the face of the figure, or rather figures, for there were
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Gouletonian Lectures. 281
two ghosts, hunting in couples. One percipient, however,
certainly did, and wrote as follows :—" The grey figure appears
to have no features. The white one has a very good profile,
but I cannot recognise it." I think it will be found that in
Local Apparition cases generally invisibility of the face is not
uncommon ; but it is sometimes explained by the relative posi
tions of the percipient and the ghost.
I. (d). [The face] "when seen is always beardless."
I have come across only four references to the beard of an
apparition in the Census collection.
The first is of little value, as it does not occur in the
account of the percipient herself, but only in that of the
percipient's sister. The latter writes :
" You said a tall gentleman, dressed in tweed, walked past
you, and went into a little inlet or creek. I think, but am
not sure, that you said he had a beard."
The other three references are, however, unimpeachable.
Mr. Heintze writes:
" Une figure humaine se forma. . . . Dans cette figure je
reconnus mon pere. M etait en frac, il avait des moustaches
fortement grises, comme de son vivant, mais outre cela une courte
barbe compUtement blanche, que je ne lui connaissais pas." (379)
The beard in this case is specially interesting, because,
quite unknown to the percipient, his father had in his last
illness grown a small and perfectly white beard.
Countess Euge"nie Kapnist writes :
" Mes yeux prirent connaissa-iux des moindres details de ce
visage, qui me sembla connu: . . . un menton tres maigre d
barbe rare et d'un blond foncd." (285)
Dr. Vladimir Solovioff writes :
" L'homme blanc approcha de mon lit. ... II se pencha
sur moi, et alors je vis distinctement les traits de sa figure.
Elle ttait tres pdle et d'un type mongol mitigd, avec une petite
barbe d'un roux clair." (202-3)
(Note the colour of the beard in these last two cases, and
v. IIL).
Still, although these are the only four references to beards
that I can find in the Census Report, there is little reason
to suppose that S.P.R. apparitions are necessarily beardless.
282 J. G. Piddington. [part
Apparitions are frequently recognised as perfect likenesses of
male relations or friends, and a beard must have been
wanted in some of these cases to make the likeness complete.
I. («). " Patients express great difficulty in deciding whether
the figure was that of a man or a woman. The face is fre
quently not visible. When seen it is always beardless, which
makes many say they think it must have been a woman."
With one exception, and that a case presenting in all other
respects the strongest possible contrast to the Visceral type
(v. 196), I can find only among the "incompletely developed"
class instances of doubt as to the sex of the apparition
(e.g. 120, 268, and 312). Out of 793 apparitions of human
figures reported at first hand 673 were classed as "realistic,"
and if a figure is realistic there can practically be no doubt
as to its sex. Of the remaining 120, although classed as
incompletely developed, it must not be assumed that the sex
was necessarily open to doubt. And even where the uncer
tainty exists, it seems to have been due, in some cases at
least (v., e.g., 268, Miss Egerton's case, "the impression dis
appeared instantaneously;" and 312, Mr. and Mrs. C.'s case
—a collective one, by the way—" the figure was too evanescent
and unrecognisable, and insufficiently defined in outline, to
identify "), as much to the momentary nature of the experi
ence as to the indefiniteness of the figure. The indis
tinctness of the hallucinations of Visceral Patients cannot be
accounted for in this way, for they seem to have usually been
anything but fleeting, and were often persistent and prolonged ;
and, even supposing that some were but momentary, the quality
of indefiniteness or haziness attaches to them all without
exception.
I. (es). " The complete flatness and absence of the usual
undulations of a woman's figure suggest that it may have been
that of a man."
This point is met by the comments on e \ unless, indeed,
the cruel suggestion be advanced that all the female figures
described as realistic, or recognised as those of female relations
or friends of Psychical Percipients, were wanting in the " usual
undulations."
Li.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 283
•L (./)• "If the figure was white, most say at once 'It
was a corpse.' Curiously, not one of my patients spoke of the
hallucination as a ghost, possibly owing to the almost entire
ignorance shown by the London-bred population of ghost stories
or fairy tales."
With regard to phantasms of the dead (232 first-hand
cases in all) the Committee reported as follows :
" Apparitions of the dead, like other apparitions, usually
appear dressed like ordinary human beings, and without symbolic
accompaniments, such as white robes or wings.
In four cases it is specially mentioned that the phantom
appeared in the clothes in which the dead person was buried.
Usually the appearance in dress or otherwise is what the
percipient was accustomed to associate with the person in life."
(364-5)
Of the four cases referred to in the Census Report where
the phantom appeared dressed in the clothes in which the
dead person had been buried, it must not be understood
that these clothes were necessarily grave-clothes : for in one
case, already referred to (v. I. d), a phantom of his father
dressed " en frac " (i.e. in evening dress clothes) was seen by
Mr. Heintze, who subsequently learned that his father " avait
ete" enten-e" en habit noir (frac)." (379)
In another of these four cases, the apparition was seen
dressed in grave-clothes (141-2); but this was a memory
image rather than a hallucination, the percipient having " shortly
before " seen the dead man lying in his coffin and " the
sight of the corpse had produced a profound impression " on
him.
Among veridical cases of phantasms of the dead I note one
instance (372) of the hallucinatory figure taking the form of
a corpse. Except for this the case shows no likeness to the
Visceral type. The hallucination was coincidental, having
occurred on the same day as the funeral of the percipient's
mother, whose death, and even illness, was unknown to her ;
and the percipient was at the moment engaged in serving
maccaroni and milk to her children ; the day was fine and
hot, the time 1.30 p.m., and consequently the light must have
been strong (v. IV.) ; and the vision was exceptionally complete
and vivid, and apparently coloured (v. III.).
284 J. G. Piddington. [PART
Dr. Head thinks it curious that his patients never spoke
of the figures as " ghosts," and attributes this to their ignorance
of ghost stories or fairy tales. But though they may not
have spoken of them as " ghosts " they may have thought of
them as such ; and that this was the case in at least one
instance would appear from the quotation which heads
Section VIII.
In view, too, of the reticence shown by Visceral Patients
(v. above, p. 268), it is not surprising if they refrained from
the use of the word " ghosts." " Hallucinations " would sound
so much better, especially when one was conversing with a
medical man, and even such expressions as " funny experience "
or " funny feelings," if less scientific, would recommend them
selves in preference to " ghosts " as likely to excite less
ridicule or less distrust.
Moreover, S.P.R. percipients do not often, even to sympathetic
ears, use the question-begging and mirth-provoking word
" ghosts " ; and so it does not surprise me that patients drawn
from a class proverbially apprehensive of ridicule did not
employ it.
Again, the fact that many of the hallucinations repeated
themselves (the recurrency being obviously not attributable
to " local " causes) and that they recurred under similar
conditions of light, time, mood, etc., may have led the
patients to feel that their experiences were not " ghosts "
of the proper traditional kind.
I. (g). "Whatever the form assumed, the figure or face is
single. I have found no instance so far in the sane where
more than one face or figure appeared if the patient's eyes
were open. I have very carefully excluded the not uncommon
condition where faces or figures seem to stream past when the
eyes are closed, though the patient is awake."
We may clear the ground for a comparison by saying that
visions of objects seen with closed eyes, and visual experiences
of the type called " illusions hypnagogiques," were likewise
excluded from the Census collection, and are not collected by
the S.P.R.
As regards the main point, the Committee reported :
u.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 285
" In the great majority of realistic cases, the apparition repre
sents a single figure only, though there are exceptions." (113)
A " very peculiar " example of the contrary, described, for
other reasons, as perhaps " the most remarkable case in our
collection of a phantasm of the dead conveying true infor
mation," is quoted in the Report (380-2):
September 14th, 1891.
" On June 5th, 1887, a Sunday evening between 11 and 12
at night, being awake, my name was called three times. I
answered twice, thinking it was my uncle, ' Come in, Uncle
George, I am awake,' but the third time I recognised the voice
as that of my mother, who had been dead 16 years. I said,
' Mamma ! ' She then came round a screen near my bedside
with two children in her arms, and placed them in my arms
and put the bedclothes over them and said, ' Lucy, promise me
to take care of them, for their mother is just dead.' I said,
' Yes, Mamma.' She repeated, ' Promise me to take care of
them.' I replied, ' Yes, I promise you,' and I added, ' Oh,
Mamma, stay and speak to me, I am so wretched.' She replied,
' Not yet, my child,' then she seemed to go round the screen
again, and I remained, feeling the children to be still in my
arms, and fell asleep. When I awoke there was nothing.
Tuesday morning, June 7th, I received the news of my sister-
in-law's death. She had given birth to a child three weeks
before, which I did not know till after her death.
" / was in bed but not asleep, and the room was lighted by
a gas-light in the street outside. 1 was out of health and in
anxiety about family troubles. My age was 42- I was yu^e
alone. I mentioned the circumstance to my uncle the next
morning. He thought I was sickening for brain fever. [/ have
had other experiences, but] only to the extent of having felt a
hand- laid on my head, and sometimes on my hands, at times
of great trouble." (380)
Professor Sidgwick, after interviewing the percipient, wrote
as follows :
" The children seemed to be with her a long time ; indeed
they seemed to be with her when the clock struck IS. The
room was usually light enough to see things in,—e.g. to get a
glass of water, etc.,—owing to the lamp in the street, but the
J. G. Piddington. [PART
distinctness with whick the vision was seen is not explicable by
the real light. The children were of ages corresponding to those
of her sister-in-law's children : i.e., they seemed to be a little
girl and a baby newly born: the sex was not distinguished. Shi
was not at all alarmed . . . She never had any experience of
the kind, or any hallucination at all, before : but since she has
occasionally felt a hand on her head in trouble."
Tactile hallucinations, it should be noted, are not mentioned
among the experiences of Visceral Patients (v. XVIII.).
For other instances of more than one figure, see
(169) Wife and child: visual only.
(195-6) Mother and child: visual and auditory (vocal).
(103) Old woman nursing a child: visual only.
(412) Ayah and child, "as if made of plaster of Paris":
visual, auditory, and recurrent.
In the last two of the above cases, however, the hallu
cinations were connected with illness. The percipient of the
old woman nursing a child himself draws attention to the
fact that he was at the time suffering from " nerves " and
insomnia, and that the hallucination was the precursor of a
" severe illness." The percipient of the ayah and child was
at the time suffering from " a long neurotic attack " which had
been preceded by an attack of bronchitis.
In five instances out of the six which I have traced in the
Census Report the second figure is that of a child : a curious
result, which can hardly be due to chance, and probably arises
from the intimate association of the idea of mother and child,
or of nurse and child.1
In the sixth case (classed as a "Vision"), the percipient
saw her uncle lying on a sofa and seemingly dying: and at
the same time saw her uncle's bearer and her aunt's ayah
passing each other in going across the room, and apparently
looking at her and sighing. The time and the details of
the vision coincided very closely with the time and circum
stances of the death of the uncle, whose illness was unknown
to the percipient.
I. (h). " In the majority of instances the figure remained
stationary at the foot or on one side or other of the bed. It
1See also Phantasms of the Living, vol. i., p. 544.
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 287
may, however, pass in front of the bed from left to right or
from right to left, and is sometimes seen in the doorway."
" In more than half of the iiisunl cases the figure is seen to move
in various ways." (110)
" When they [phantoms] move, which . . . happens more often
than not, the movement is almost always such as we are accustomed
to see." (113-14)
With regard to stationary transparent figures the Report
says : " It seems possible that in some cases in which a transparent
apparition was motionless, it may have been an illusion, rather
than a hallucination. Hut other cases of motionless transparent
apparitions seem to be clearly genuine hallucinations."
Two such are referred to : one purely subjective, the other
veridical.
In the former (103) the apparition was recurrent nightly,
and even several times a night during a period of five or six
weeks ; it was seen always in one particular spot on a
landing : it was draped, and the percipient, who was suffering
from overstrung nerves, sorrow and fatigue, speaks of the
" horror " which it caused her. So far, except for the occasion
and place of perception, the case presents considerable re
semblances to the Visceral type ; but there is one mark of
differentiation : the figure was blue (v. III.).
In the veridical case (284-6) the only point of resemblance
to the Visceral type is the absence of movement ; but this
is perhaps not remarkable, as the figure was seen seated in
a carriage which the percipient was entering ; and in two
particulars the divergence is most marked, namely, in the
distinctness of the colouring of the face and clothing (v. III.)
and in the fact of the figure having a beard : " un menton trea
maigre k barbe rare et d'un blond fonce"." (v. I. d)
In 5 cases out of 12 of transparent apparitions included
in the Census collection " the transparent figure was seen to
move in such a way as to make it almost certain that it
could not have been an illusion." (119)
I. (t). " Usually the patient wakes from sleep to see [the figure]
standing near his bed."
Out of 1062 visual hallucinations contained in the Census
collection, 129 were experienced by the percipient immediatel^

after waking, 294 when awake in bed, 438 when up and
indoors, and 201 when out of doors.
But proportionately more incompletely developed hallucina
tions occurred at the moment of waking than visual halluci
nations of any other class. Thus, once again, we find among
this special class a closer conformity than in any other to the
Visceral type of hallucination.
"In 38 per cent, of visual, 34 per cent, of auditory, and
44 per cent, of tactile cases, the percipient was in bed. Con
sidering what a small part of our lives we generally spend
awake in bed, the fact that over ^ of the hallucinations occur
under these circumstances is certainly remarkable : and the pro
portion that occurs immediately after waking—about 12 per
cent, of visual hallucinations—is still more striking." (171)
The Report then proceeds to discuss why a state of repose
is favourable to hallucinations : but into this question we
need not enter, for, striking though the proportion of hallucina
tions experienced at the moment of or shortly after waking is,
it certainly could not be asserted of Census visual hallucinations
that they " usually " occur under this condition.
I. (/)• " No sound accompanied the appearance of the hallucina
tion of vision in any case." l
" When [the figure] moved no footsteps were heard."
Whether it be true of the generality of hallucinatory figures
seen by Psychical Percipients that they " like to noiseless
phantoms flit " is a difficult question to decide, owing to the lack
of positive information in most cases. All that can be asserted
with confidence is that sound (and for the moment I am
leaving out of consideration articulate speech : for which see
Section I. m.) accompanies the appearance of Psychical phantoms
in a certain number of cases, and the absence of sound is
categorically noted in a very few cases only.
Out of the 1120 Census cases of visual hallucination
recorded at first hand, 912 were visual only, 87 visual and
•iditory (vocal), 19 visual, auditory (vocal), and tactile, 31
sual and tactile, 67 visual and auditory (non-vocal), 4
sual, auditory (non-vocal), and tactile.
1For an exception to this rule see the heading of Section XVII.
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 289
For the purposes of our comparison we can eliminate the
106 hallucinations of which a vocal sound formed an
element, because, as we shall see, the hallucinatory figures
seen by Visceral Patients do not speak (v. I. m), and also
because Visceral auditory hallucinations are never articulate
voices (v. IX.).
Confining ourselves, therefore, to non-vocal sounds, we find
that the Census Committee reports as follows regarding them :
" There are 71 cases . . . in our collection where a non-vocal
sound is heard accompanied by a visual hallucination, and in
56 of these the sound precedes the apparition."
There are therefore 15 cases in the Census collection in
which a non-vocal sound accompanies (in the strict sense of
the word) a hallucination of vision.
We may briefly compare with the Visceral type three
cases where absence of sound was noted :
" The shadow of a human form fell on the moonlit floor.
Half turning my head J saw a tall woman dressed in white,
her back to me. By the contour and the (fleam of the plaits
round her head / recognised my cousin, and deemed she had
doffed her black dress to try a white one. / addressed an
ordinary remark to her. She did not reply. . . . Then she went
out of the door down the entrance steps, and as she disappeared
/ wondered / had heard nothing of a step or tlie rustle of her
dress. / sat and puzzled over this, though without taking fright,
for a few minutes. / was . . . in robust health ; completely
awake ; untroubled." (187)
Resemblances.
Absence of sound and no
footsteps heard.
Figure does not speak (v. I. m).
Face invisible (v. I. c).
Differences.
Figure and its sex recognised
(v. I. e and VIII.).
Figure not stationary (v. I. h).
No fright (v. V.).
Perhaps colour (gleam of
plaits of hair) (v. III.).
" Out of the passage came an old woman about 5 feet in
height, wearing dark broion dress, and large black shawl fastened
across the chest, the point of it reaching nearly to the bottom of
her dress, and a small poke bonnet. She walked before us some
yards, exciting my wonder by her noisclcssness upon the grr '
290 J. G. Piddington. [PART
path, and finally by the fact that she cast no shadow. Putting
my hand upon my sister's arm, I said, ' What a funny old
woman,' but with the movement of my hand she disappeared, we
being by the blank wall in which there was neither gate nor
opening, with plenty of gas-lights. . . . I was in perfect health
and peace of mind." (194)
Here the only resemblances to the A^isceral type are the
noiselessness of the footsteps and the dissipation of the figure
by movement on the part of the percipient (v. I. /).
" / saw the figure quite distinctly ; it made no sound in
walking, which did not strike me as at all strange, as it had
only a wrapper on, and probably, as I thought, bedroom slippers."
(353-6)
The above is an extract from a local apparition case, in
which non-vocal noises were prominent. The phenomena are
attested by 7 first-hand witnesses, whose experiencss were
on several occasions collective. Although, as described in the
extract given above, one of the percipients noted that the
figure's movement was noiseless, another percipient states that
a sound of footsteps preceded the appearance of the figure,
while another unspecified non-vocal sound succeeded it :
" / heard what I thought was my grandmother walking about
the room. Just as I was going to run past the screen, the
. . . figure . . . passed me very quickly and went into the
dressing-room. My first impulse was to follow her, but I heard
such a strange noise in the dressing-room that 1 feared to enter."
I append a quotation from the Census Report bearing
specially on the question of audible footsteps :
" Non-vocal sounds, such as footsteps, which sometimes precede
the seeing of an apparition, may occasionally be real noises. . . .
But in some cases the apparition • is first seen, and then footsteps
or some other sound apparently caused by it are heard." (193)
I. (k). " After a variable interval it [the figure] disappears
without movement."
" Appearance or disappearance by an unrealistic means is
. rare. . . . Even when a phantom is stationary, it does not
ally either suddenly appear out of empty space, or similarly
•ish before the percipient's eyes, but is generally seen by the
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Gcndstonian Lectures. 291
percipient on turning his eyes that way, and vanishes, he does
not know how, or when he is looking away. There are, however,
instances of sudden appearance and disappearance in free space."
(114)
Two such instances are quoted in illustration; in one (261-2)
the percipient " simply ceased to see the figure " ; in the
other (114) the percipient writes:—"I looked at it [the figure]
for several seconds in surprise, . . . when it suddenly dis
appeared." Neither instance shows any resemblance worth
mentioning to the Visceral type, and both present very strongly
marked divergences from it.
I. (/). "On the appearance of such a hallucination [i.e.
stationary figure near bed] several male patients, before admission
to the hospital, sprang out of bed to seize the person whom they
supposed to have entered the room. The figure at once dis
appeared."
It would appear from the above that in Visceral cases
movement, or at least violent movement, on the part of the
patient dissipates the hallucination. Dr. Head records no
case where on movement having being made by a patient the
hallucination persisted. Evidence is lacking on this point in
the great majority of Psychical cases : but instances do occur both
w.here movement does dissipate and where it does not dissipate
the apparition. There are several cases where percipients touch,
follow and even run after a hallucinatory figure without their
action resulting in its immediate dissipation (v. e.g. 133, 192,
215 and 295.) In one case (118) the percipient put his hand
through the appearance, and, though no tactile sensation was felt,
his " hand went through as it would through water, . . . the clothes
kept their fold and position (as water keeps its level) making no
break. My hand with the white night-shirt sleeve was wholly
hid, and when I withdrew it there was no hole left behind."
40 or 50 seconds later the figure slowly disintegrated. There
is also a case (coincidental) where the percipient performed
precisely the same action as some of Dr. Head's patients :
namely, springing out of bed ; but the result was different.
" / lay for a few seconds and then spoke, but getting no
answer, jumped out of bed with hands outstretched towards the
figure, which, on my approach, retreated to the outer room still
292 J. G. Piddington. [PART
smiling with peculiar sweetness. I followed it, and watched it
vanish through the outer door, which was closed." (286)
In the following instance the figure disappeared on the
percipient getting out of bed and touching it. " She got out
of bed, and, walking up to the glass, laid her hand on the airFs
shoulder ; but it passed through empty air, and she found her
self looking at her own self in the glass." (359.) But apart
from the vanishing of the figure on movement by the percipient,
this case shows no resemblances to, and many clearly marked
differences from, the Visceral type.
In another case (120) (already referred to under I. b) the
figure, seen on three different occasions, always vanished when
the percipient " threw " her " hands into it." This case was
placed in the incompletely developed class ; and shows other
points of resemblance to the Visceral type, but also some
differences (v. sub. I. b.).
In another case (103) Prof. G. "saw an old woman with red
cloak, nursing a child in her arms. She sat on a boulder. . . .
Early autumn in bright sunny weather. Made several attempts
to reach her, but she always vanished before I could get close up
to the stone."
Here, except for the apparent immobility of the figure, its
dissolving on the near approach of the percipient, and that the
experience was followed by " a severe illness " (unspecified),
it will be noticed that the figure was coloured (v. III.), was
seen in bright daylight (v. IV.), and was not single (v. I. g).
I. (m). "The figure did not speak [in any case]."
In 106 out of 1120 first-hand cases of visual hallucina
tion in the Census collection the apparition seemed to speak
articulately.
Visual and auditory (vocal) cases were, it may be remarked,
also more numerous than visual and auditory (non-vocal) : the
latter numbering 71 against 106 of the former.
I. (n). [The figure] " made no gestures, and the ' grimacing '
occasionally mentioned probably refers rather to an unpleasant
expression of the face than to any mobility of the features."
Gesture is a common characteristic of S.P.R. apparitions ;
i common that it is unnecesssary to quote examples.
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 293
As to mobility of the features, it may be fairly assumed
that in at least some proportion of the visual and vocal
auditory cases the lips were seen to move, although we do
meet with one curious instance where it is definitely stated
that in spite of the lips being seen to move no audible
sound was heard (373).
The apparition is constantly said to smile, but the language
used is never precise enough to make it clear whether the
smile was one of the kind (rendered famous by a certain
advertisement) that " won't come off," or whether at a given
point the features of the phantom broke into a smile (e.g.
v. 389, 390, and 122). Once a "fixed and agonised stare"
(preceded, however, by a turning of the head, 260), is spoken
of ; " looked me full in the face," " looking straight at my face,"
" looking straight before her," " gazing fixedly," " looked
intently," "gazing wistfully," and similar expressions frequently
occur.
Grimacing is not mentioned,1 and an unpleasant expression
is very rare indeed. On the whole, though there are hardly
definite enough data from which to form an estimate, I am
inclined to think that while mobility of feature is sometimes
met with, immobility is much commoner.
II. " Sometimes . . . [the figure] may consist of a face only."
" More than one patient complained . . . of . . . ' a pair of
eyes looking through, the bars at the foot of the bed.' "
" In one case only the patient saw a hand and arm come round
the door. . . . This arm was extended on to the white counter
pane, and she sat up in bed expecting the body to appear
round the edge of the wide-opened door."
A few cases, under 30 in all, occur in the Census collec
tion of the appearance of a face or head only, and these
were all classed as " incompletely developed apparitions," though
" merely on account of their fragmentary character," and not
on account of any lack of distinctness in the percept (121).
The cases quoted in illustration are quite unlike the Visceral
type (v. 121-2, 116, 105, and 240).

294 J. G. Piddington. [PART
15 cases are ' contained in the Census collection where a
hand or hand and arm only, and 3 cases where legs only
were seen. In one case the hand and in one the legs were
recognised as belonging to a particular person. Both of the
two illustrative cases quoted diverge from the Visceral type
(v. 241 and 122).
III. "These hallucinations in all cases are white, black, or
grey. They are never, so far as my experience goes, coloured
or even normally tinted. For if the face is white, even the
lips are said to be colourless. . . . This forms a differentiating
point between these hallucinations of the sane and the usual
hallucinations of the insane."
Colour is a very common characteristic of Psychical' halluci
nations. Specific reference is often made to the colour of the
clothes or of the face of the apparition : and even where no
such reference is made, there is usually little doubt about the
vision having been coloured. In one class only, namely, the
less realistic or imperfectly developed apparitions, is absence
of colour relatively frequent. " They are either shadowy,
vague, transparent, or colourless." (50 and 119). Though
even among this class colour is not necessarily absent: v., e.g.,
a (recurrent) hallucination of the head of a " red setter dog "
(143), "a semi-transparent figure, dressed in a black hat,
surtout, and blue waistcoat" (119, footnote2), of the "head and
shoulders of a man, middle-aged, stout, with iron-grey hair
and blue eyes" (116), of the head and shoulders of a woman,
described by the percipient " as exactly like a coloured picture
of her mother" (123). And a marked example of colour iu
an incompletely developed apparition is the following (already

One apparition is described (143) as " semi-opaque, neutral

tinted, like thick smoke or cloud " : but the case does not
conform to the Visceral type, as the features were distinctly
seen, the figure took its departure by a window, carried a
basket, was recognised as female, and the details of its dress
were carefully observed.
In the very few cases where the apparition took the form
of a corpse no doubt the lips would have been colourless.
In the case of a local apparition (346-349), seen collectively
in the first instance and subsequently many times by some of
the same percipients separately, one percipient describing one
of the later experiences writes :
" The hair was very dark and smooth ; the one eye not
covered by the shawl was turned up, and the face like death.
It had the look I have seen since on the faces of the dead."
Except for the ghastliness of the face the case shows
no approximation to the Visceral type. In three cases of
apparitions coinciding with death the pallor of the halluci
natory face is spoken of (v. 223-4, 224, 235-6), but here the
pallor forms part of the true information supernormally con
veyed (see also 217), and none of these cases otherwise
conforms to the Visceral type.
For colour of hair, complexion, and eyes, v. 79 (case of
an apparition seen in the dark), 358, 352 (a recurrent case),
and 374. For colour in dress, etc., v. 369, 385, 163 (a
recurrent case), 73, 230, 359-361, and 300.
I have traced no actual reference to the lips : but apart
from the above cases, where the colour of the eyes, hair,
cheeks, etc., is positively described, the constantly reiterated
and emphatic statements of numerous percipients as to the
lifelike character of the features of the phantoms is evidence
enough that the faces and lips are not pale and bloodless like
those of the ghost of literary tradition. On the contrary,
the S.P.R. ghost seems to be quite a full-blooded animal.
IV. " Hallucinations of vision do not occur in the bright light
of day. ... In other cases the hallucination appeared in the
evening when the patient was sitting quietly in a dimly-lighted
room."
" Things seen in actually complete darkness, but with eyes open—
as the percipient believed—belong to a somewhat different category.

and- have required careful consideration. Some of them are
undoubtedly hallucinations, but in other cases there is some un
certainty. On the whole, we have decided that apparitions
which, notwithstanding the darkness, seemed to the percipient to
be seen occupying a definite place in his room—standing by his
bed, for instance—should be classed as genuine hallucinations,
and that others were to be regarded as probably pseudo-
hallucinations. The number of apparitions seen in the dark thus
included in our tables is 80.
"In 17 of the 80 cases, the figure alone appeared illuminated.
. . . In 12 other cases out of the 3£) the room appeared
illuminated, though it urns really dark." (78-9)
" Sometimes the seeing of an apparition seems to depend on
the presence of light, and this is probably due to suggestion,
. . . Thus in one case . . . the figure, seen by the light of o
lamp, disappeared when the lamp VMS turned out. In [a case
printed on pp. 385-7] the percipient first heard footsteps, and
did not see the apparition till he had struck a light. Again
in [a case printed on p. 192] the apparition vanished when
the light was put out, and was seen again on relighting it"
(191)
Apart from the above quotations, which are alone sufficient
to disprove the existence of any similarity between Visceral
and Psychical hallucinations so far as the particular condition
of perception in question is concerned, it may be noted as
further evidence of disparity that no mention of illumination of
the room, of the figure seeming to emit light, or of its being
surrounded by a luminous halo, is made in Dr. Head's
descriptions of the experiences of such of his patients as had
hallucinations of vision. I append a few quotations picked at
hazard from cases in the Census Report :
" / saw it constantly ; it used to come into my room and
stand by my bed, but I don't remember seeing it once when it
was quite dark." (348)
" / constantly saw it, nearly always by daylight ; though once
I remember seeing it exceedingly distinctly by firelight." (351)
" The hmirs of appearance have varied, but it has oftene-st
been broad daylight. . . . Its appearances . . . are much more
usual in daylight than at any other time." (352)
" The gas shone full on her [i.e. the apparition's] hair." (361)
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 297
" It appeared both by daylight and candlelight, most frequently
about 12 mid-day." (345)
" All this [i.e. a collective apparition] took place on a bright
summer afternoon." (347)
Here, again, it may be remarked, the S.P.R. ghost refuses to
subject itself to the rules laid down for ghosts in literary and
popular tradition.
V. " Almost every case felt frightened with the first hallucination
of vision, and in many cases the fear was accompanied by sweat
ing, heart beating, and ' goose-flesh.' If the hallucination is
frequently repeated men, as a rule, recover their self-control,
and ultimately come to look upon the repetition of the halluci
nation with curiosity."
The Census Report deals only indirectly with the question
of fright. So far, however, as we are concerned to compare
the emotional states that accompanied the first hallucinations of
Visceral Patients and of Psychical Percipients, no difficulty
arises, for the large majority of cases of hallucination in
the Census collection were unique experiences in the lives of
the various percipients.
Fright is often admitted, and even horror ; yet it would
be very far from the truth to say of S.P.R. cases that
" almost every case felt frightened." Not only is fright often
expressly denied, but composure or even pleasure is affirmed.
But, in any case, I cannot suppose that the presence or
absence of fright and of its accompanying physical symptoms
could ever serve as a useful differentia between one order
of hallucination and another. Its absence or presence could
do not more than exemplify differences of mental or moral
temperament, and though doubtless true that many a Psychical
Percipient when he saw an apparition
"panted hard
Like 'Hie that feels a nightmare on hia bed,"
it would no more go to prove that his hallucination was due to
visceral disease than to nightmare. Were a questionnaire
addressed to people who had been in carriage or railway acci
dents, for instance, and information asked for as to their
emotional state during and after the accident, I imagine
298 J. G. Piddington. [PART
that, while most would admit to having felt frightened and
many of them to having experienced heart-beating or sweat
ing, or even " goose-flesh " during or after the event, a
certain proportion would deny that they felt any of these
things.
From the quotations from the Census Report given below,
it would appear that Visceral hallucinations furnish no parallel
(unless, indeed, Dr. Head failed to observe or to report it)
to a rare symptom of Psychical hallucination : I mean the
" cold shudder " which is sometimes said to precede the
hallucination.
Perhaps this " cold shudder " answers more or less to
"goose-flesh," but, if so, the "cold shudder" sometimes precedes
the hallucination, whereas the " goose-flesh " of Visceral Patients
always accompanies it. If, however, it does not, then "goose-
flesh " is not reported in any Census case so far as my
knowledge goes : and sweating only once, and then only at
second hand (341): but perhaps a natural delicacy would
have prevented many from mentioning this symptom in the
absence of a direct request for information on the point.
" The first [organic] effect to be noticed is the 'feeling of
cold '—generally described as a ' chill ' or ' cold shudder '—which
is sometimes reported as accompanying or immediately preceding
hallucinations. This is so common in magazine stories of appari
tions that our readers may expect to find it a normal feature
in the narratives collected by us : it is, however, on the contrary,
quite an exceptional feature, being only reported in seven cases
—exclusive of about half-a-dozen cases in which a 'feeling of
cold breezes' is mentioned." (198)
" It will be observed that in some of these cases the chill
is reported as preceding, in others as accompanying or following,
the kaUucination. In the latter cases it would seem to be a
natural result, on certain physical temperaments, of the emotional
excitement—terror, awe, etc., caused by the unusual experience. . . .
But where the chill precedes the hallucination, it seems clear that
the sensation must be regarded as an incident of the wlu1le
nervous disturbance of which the hallucination is one effect." (200)
Elsewhere (392) the Report says that it was unusual to
d hallucinations accompanied by an abnormal physical
iition.
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 299
I adjoin a few instances of (a) the absence of fright being
noted ; (b) of some unusual physical effect unaccompanied by
fear ; (c) of feelings incompatible with fright being reported.
(a.) " / did not feel at all alarmed, but very curious and sur
prised, and I jumped out of bed, came up behind [the figure],
and was going to touch her on the shoulder." (361)
" / felt no fear, but the strain of emotion was so great that
I remember thinking, etc." (369).
" There was nothing to alarm any one in the apparition.
It teas a very gentle, mild-faced old man, and not one bit like
a story-book ghost." (351)
"/ lay for a few seconds and then spoke, but getting no
answer, jumped out of bed. ... / followed it, and watched it
vanish through the outer' door. ... I was not afraid, only
vTondering. ..." (286)
" Mr. Cass was not inclined to give details about the figure,
beyond saying that it passed through the room, that he knew it
was spiritual, but felt no alarm." (231)
" Jie n'ai pas ressenti de peur, fttais ttonnt, stuptfait, ct
plutdt enclin a croire it la presence rdelle de mon pere qu'h
une ' apparition.' Quand I'apparition disparut, fai tprouvt une
angoisse excessive, tin pressentiment, la conviction qu'il devait
arriver quelque chose & mon pere." (236)
"/ was lying asleep or nearly so, one night, when I felt a
hand laid gently on my shoulder. I was not surprised or
frightened. I thought it was my sister Alice. ... / was too
sleepy to rouse myself till I felt the hand pressing more heavily,
as if to wake me ; then I said, ' What is it, Alice ? What
do you want?' and at the same time opened my eyes. . . .
It was quite dark; but close to my bedside stood, enveloped
in light, a figure like my sister. . . . There was the golden-
brown hair, blue eyes, and fair complexion, and yet it looked
like a being from another world, standing in light unlike any
earthly light. ... / felt deep awe, but no fear." (79)
"/ was not frightened. ... / looked after [the ghost] for
a moment, crossed myself, put out the candle, and fell asleep
with the sense ofjoy which a man who has done his duty must
fed." (385)
(b.) " I felt completely rivetted, but though my heart and
pulses were beating unnaturally fast, neither much frightened
300 J. G. Piddington. [PART
nor surprised, only with a sort of impulse to get up and
go after the figure."
Mrs. Sidgwick reported after interviewing the percipient :
" The feeling of her heart beating foat was only what one
feels after anything sudden and startling. She only felt it
after the figure disappeared." (293-5)
'• / felt a strange thrill and a vague anxiety, but no fear."
(295)
" Ma premiere sensation jut un frisson dans le dos. Je fits
comme pttrifit et ma respiration fut suspendue ; mais ce
n'e'tait pas un effet cause" par la frayear ou I'excitation,—
c's^tait quelque chose d'autre." (388-9)
(c.) " Le visage d'OUg [a very young child who had just seen
an apparition simultaneously with his father, the narrator]
s"tait tout a fait tranquil et joyeux." (390)
" / plainly saw [my sister] lying dead beside me, ... /
scarcely slept at all that night, and there my sister lay
beside me, and I was glad to have her." (234)
" Her mother came and lay close beside her. . . . Her mother
spoke to her very sympathetically. . . , She assured her that
all was right at home, and in order to satisfy herself [i.e.
the percipient] that this was so, she should see her youngest
child. Accordingly she saw the child up in a corner of Hie
room near the ceiling. Her mother encouraged her to look
up wkere the child was, and assured her it would do her
no harm. When this occurred her mother had been dead
four years. . . . She has never at any other time seen or
heard anything that she would deem supernatural." (196)
VI. " The feeling-tone that accompanies the colourless white
figure varies greatly, but the dark or black hallucinations are
uniformly associated with fear or its physical manifestations."
Except possibly for a few examples among " incompletely
developed " cases, I doubt if the Census report contains any
instances of dark or black hallucinations in the sense intended
by Dr. Head. For instance, the following case could not
properly be used for purposes of comparison, for I do not
think that in spite of the grey dress, pale face, black eyes
and hair, the figure really corresponded to a dark or a
• Igure of the Visceral type ; and although the percipient
Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 301
makes no such statement I should imagine that in spite of
the paleness there must have been slight traces of colour
in the complexion, for otherwise the play of the features,
the impression of beauty, and of alternate gaiety and sadness
can hardly be explained :
" Je vis une personne, dont je ne saurais pas dire le sexe
(v. I. e), habilUe en une tres large robe grise. Elle etait tres pdle,
avec de grands yeux noirs, et de longs cheveux noirs retombant
sur les epaules, avec une rate au milieu* Je ne fus nullement
effrayee et mtme pas etonnee. . . . J'etais Men portante, gaie. . . .
Cette ombre ou vision ne m'a jamais quitUe 2 mois ou 6
semaines de suite. . . . 'L'ombre' avait une tres belle figure, tantdt
gaie, tantdt triste. . . . .Tdtais tellement habitude a cette vision
que je ne m'en inquidtais pas. C'ttait la premiere figure qw,
je vogais en me rdveillant, la derniere en m'endomiant. Elle
ne me disait jamais rien (v. I. m), mais elie me faisait
quelquefois des signes de la ttte." . . . (v. I. n)
The collector, Mme de Holstein, wrote of the percipient
as follows : " Mme R. est actuellement une femme absolument
saint ou point de vue neroeux." (196)
Of two examples of draped or veiled figures quoted in the
Report (119-120) and already referred to above (v. I. b), one
was certainly and the other probably dark or black. In the
first case, the " terror " of the percipient upon the appearance
of the " dark veiled figure " was " so great, that " she " could
neither call " her " sister . . . nor move hand or foot." In
the second case, no emotional disturbance is mentioned, and
the absence of fright may be inferred from the following
statement made by the percipient:
" / could not recognise the person ; but was so fully awake that
/ thought it might be some one with a message to me, and sat
quietly waiting for it to speak ; this it did not do."
(For a comparison of these two cases with the Visceral type
see I. b and XIV).
In another " incompletely developed " case a percipient sees
"two black legs walking towards" him (122). The percipient
is silent as to his emotional condition, but the tone of his
narrative does not suggest fright.
In a case (204-5) already referred to (sub. I. b) two
sisters experienced extreme terror—a terror so great that
302 J. G. Piddington. [PART
its effects lasted for a long time afterwards—as the result of
four successive and varied uncanny experiences. The experiences
comprised a collective tactile hallucination, a collective sense
of presence, and non-collective but apparently identical
hallucinations of "a very vague muffled form or shadow."
This form was no doubt dark, if not black, and its appearance
induced extreme terror in the percipients ; but as pointed
out below (v. I. 6) this case cannot be brought into line
with the Visceral type.
VII. "In no case do they [i.e. hallucinations of sight, hearing and
smell] appear without the depression having already made its
appearance, but hallucinations of vision are in no way necessarily
contemporaneous with an attack of depression."
" These [i.e. visual] hallucinations are not uncommonly accom
panied by the depressed mood."
The depression to which sane persons suffering from visceral
disease are liable is essentially an irrational mood : " it comes
on in paroxysms without reason," says Dr. Head, " and forces
the patient to seek some solitary place." And not only is
the mood irrational, but even . the patient himself does not
seek to attribute it to any definite cause.
Since the depression is not necessarily contemporaneous
with a visual hallucination, it is, of course, possible that if the
reports of Census Percipients had covered a period of some
days, weeks or months previous to the occurrence of their
hallucinations, some traces of the existence of such tits of senseless
depression would have been found ; though I am certain that
such traces would have been of the very rarest, both because the
characteristic traits of Psychical hallucinations differ so widely
and in so many details from those of Visceral hallucinations
and also because of the rarity of cases where depression con
temporaneous with the appearance of a Psychical hallucination
is mentioned.
The following quotations from the Census Report will help
the reader to form his own estimate of the frequency of moods
of depression contemporaneous with the appearance of a hal
lucinatory figure.
" Omitting cases where definite or permanent ill-health has been
prodiiced, the percipient states himself to have been—at the time
Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures, 303
he fjcperienced a hallucination—overworked, overstrained, extremely
tired, in a state of overwrought nerves, or in some similarly
described condition, in some %5 cases in the present collection. . .
In 8 of the 25 cases, a definite caiise of anxiety is mentioned,
and in 3 others the percipient speaks of himself as worried."
(166)
Deducting, then, these 8 cases of anxiety attributed to a
definite cause, there remain only 17 cases among which we
can look for instances of causeless depression. But even
of these 17 cases all cannot be treated as affording possible
examples of depression, for a deduction must again be made
to allow for cases of overwork and overstrain, and extreme
fatigue: expressions which could hardly have been used to
describe depression. There remain, then, only those cases
where the percipients reported themselves as " in a state of
overwrought nerves," or in some similarly described condition:
and in this small balance of cases only could we legitimately
seek for examples of contemporaneous depression. But from the
following quotation it is clear that cases of depression were
not intentionally included by the Committee under the terms
" overwrought nerves, or ... some similarly described con
dition " :
" Taking all hallucinations, whether of sight, hearing, or
touch, of which we have first-hand accounts, we find that
anxiety, more or less grave, about the illness of a relative
or friend, is stated to have been present, or appears from the
evidence to have been probably present, in about 89 cases.
In 54 other cases, we find 'mention of anxiety, or worry, or
terious trouble about other subjects than illness—or at least
not stated to have been about illness.
[Practically all these cases may be dismissed, even supposing
that " anxiety " or " worry " be held to include some cases of
depression, because a cause is assigned for the depressed state
of mind.]
Then there are about 49 cases,1 in which the percipient appears
to have been in grief, or unhappy (besides some already
counted [see above] in which he states himself to have been
in anxiety, as well as in grief) ; and if we add cases of
1 In 42 ont of these 49 cases the grief was due to the recent death of a friend.
U
304 J. G. Piddington. [PART
depression (6) and of agitation in various forms (23), we
get altogether, out of 1622 hallucinations, about 220 cases
in which emotional disturbance accompanied the hallucination.
In 437 cases a positive statement is made that no grief or
anxiety existed, and there seems to be no reason to suspect
the presence of either in the great majority of the cases where
no answer is made to tke question about emotion, nor any
information given bearing on the subject." (168)
There were then only 5 instances out of 1622 hallucinations
of all kinds, or out of 1120 visual hallucinations, where de
pression is categorically said to have been present ; and
even in these five cases it is not said that the depression
was causeless.
There are doubtless plenty of cases where depression has
followed on the seeing of an apparition, whose appearance
was taken to convey or to forebode news of a depressing nature;
but here, of course, both the time relation and the existence
of a motive distinguish such depression from the depression
that precedes or precedes and accompanies the hallucinations
of Visceral Patients.
I have not traced in the Census Report any mention
by a percipient of a fit of apparently motiveless depression
preceding a visual hallucination, but it would not surprise me
if examples of this could be found in the Proceedings and
Journal. For supposing that a message of a depressing char
acter has in some way reached the consciousness of a percipient
with sufficient intensity for its general emotional tenour to be
communicated, but with not enough intensity for the full
particulars to be externalised hallucinatorily, during the period
of incubation or development one may easily conceive that
the percipient should be seized with a feeling of vague
depression—a depression which would seem meaningless and
motiveless until explained by the appearance of the ill-boding
apparition.
I have, perhaps, laboured this point with unnecessary
prolixity : but of all the distinguishing features of Visceral
hallucinations none seems to me more outstanding than this
one ; namely, that they are always preceded by moods of
depression. Consequently I have thought it right, even at
the risk of tediousness, to enter into as full and detailed a
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 305
discussion as the evidence on this point furnished by the
narratives in the Census Report allows.
VIII. "These hallucinations are not uncommonly accompanied
by the depressed mood. ... In such cases the patient is
convinced that the appearance is a sign that some ill-fortune has
happened, or is about to happen. He believes some near rela
tive is dead or in trouble, and not infrequently says that the
figure was that of some dead relation, e.g. 'my sister.' Asked
if it resembled his sister he answered, ' Not in the least, but
I know it must have been my sister, because she is the only
one of my relations who is dead.' "
The latter part of this statement might be paraphrased as
follows : " Recognition of the figure is inferential, not instinc
tive." The large number of cases of unrecognised apparitions
—315 first-hand cases out of 830 first-hand cases of realistic
apparitions—as well as the large number of apparitions recog
nised as those of living persons—352 out of 830—shows
that there is little tendency among Psychical Percipients to
assume causelessly that apparitions represent dead or dying
persons, or subsequently to the experience to identify an
apparition which at the moment of its appearance was un
recognised. In other words, there is little tendency to
inferential recognition. Nor is there any resemblance between
the inferential identification of the hallucinatory figures seen
by Visceral Patients and the few examples of " deferred recog
nition " cited in the Census collection (v., e.g., 128-9, 142-144,
and 284). In one class of cases only—namely, cases of local
haunts—does there appear to be any tendency to read back
into the experiences resemblances which were not noted in
the first instance.
The latter part of the paragraph which heads this section
agrees with a statement made by the Census Committee :
" The most primitive, and still the most widely spread and
deeply rooted, conception of apparitions is that they repre
sent dead persons." (389) If this statement of the Com
mittee be true, it will be noticed that Census Percipients were
not unduly influenced by this widely spread and deeply rooted
conception : a strong tribute to the trustworthiness of their
evidence on this particular point of recognition of the figures.
306 J. G. Piddington. [PART
With regard to the cases of alleged death-coincidences, the
Report says :
" Have we good reason to believe that it [the figure] teas
recognised before the death was known, and not merely, having
been unrecognised at the time, assumed afterwards to have
represented the decedent became of the coincidence?" ... "Of
the . . . kind of error, by which an unrecognised figure is
afterwards remembered as a recognised one, we have no proved
instances ; nor had Mr. Gitrncy when ' Phantasms of the Living '
was written. . . . Still, it is an error respecting which we
ought to be on our guard." (210-11)
It is, of course, true that the appearance of recognised
figures is often held by Psychical Percipients to be of evil
omen : for the very good reason that the figure, by the form
it assumes, by its speech or gesture, or symbolically, seems
to convey news of death or misfortune. Sometimes a
Psychical Percipient after seeing and recognising an appari
tion, which beyond the mere fact of its appearing has
nothing about it suggestive of misfortune, does put the same
gloomy interpretation on the incident as a Visceral Patient.
But, without going into other particulars, we can always
(except, perhaps, in cases of " deferred recognition," where
we have to rely on other points of dissimilarity) draw this
clear line of distinction between the experiences of the two,
that, while the Visceral Patient only " recognises " his appari
tion as a result of subsequent reflexion, the Psychical
Percipient recognises his apparition instantaneously and
instinctively.
AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS.
IX. " Hallucinations of hearing, occurring in sane persons
suffering from visceral disease, are never articulate voices."
Neither in the Society's general collection nor in the Census
is account taken of non-vocal or inarticulate hallucinations of
ng unless they happen to form part of a bisensory
ucination, or unless they occur among a series of
cinations affecting other senses.
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 307
The hallucinations of Visceral Patients are only very rarely,
if ever, bisensory ; and we have already seen (v. I. /) that
their visual hallucinations are not accompanied by sound ;
and we now learn that their auditory hallucinations are never
articulate.
Seeing that the hallucinations of Psychical Percipients are
frequently articulate, frequently preceded and sometimes
accompanied by sound, and are often bisensory, it is clear
that very broad lines of cleavage divide the one order of
hallucinatory phenomena from the other.
It may seem, therefore, a work of supererogation to pursue
the comparison further ; but I am led to do so for the following
reasons :
The diversity between the two is brought out much more
forcibly by entering into detail than by merely contrasting, as
above, the broad features of each.
Moreover, both the Census Report and the publications of
the Society generally do contain records of isolated nou-vocal
sounds supposed to be hallucinatory, when these sounds form
part of a series of hallucinations of a different form. Instances
are to be found chiefly in cases of ' Haunted Houses.' These
isolated non-vocal hallucinations of Psychical Percipients I
propose, then, to compare with the equally isolated and equally
non-vocal hallucinations of persons suffering from visceral
disease.
My last reason is less obvious, and needs some pre
liminary explanation.
Dr. Head says in one place (v. I. j) that " no sound
accompanied the appearance of the hallucination of vision in
any case." From a subsequent passage in his treatise (v.
XVII.) it appears, however, that this statement needs qualifica
tion, though Dr. Head himself does not make the qualification
and seems to be unaware of the need of it.
The passage runs as follows : " It is uncommon to find
two hallucinations occurring together at the same moment.
One patient told me she heard tapping at an upstairs window
and, looking, saw a white face."
A few Visceral hallucinations of vision, then, are " accom
panied " by a non-vocal sound, and are at any rate primA
facie bisensory.
308 J. G. Piddington. [PART
Dr. Head quotes the above case in illustration of " two
hallucinations occurring together at the same moment." If he
was speaking advisedly, then I am justified in saying that
some Visceral hallucinations of vision are " accompanied "
by sound. But as a matter of fact it seems to me to be
more likely that in this case the sound preceded than that
it accompanied the apparition. If this really was so, then
the case resembles in this respect a considerable number
of Census cases, classed as "bisensory," where a non-vocal sound
preceded a visual hallucination. But they were put into this
class chiefly because the percipients thought the sound to be
hallucinatory, the Committee themselves thinking it probable
that in many cases the sounds were real sounds, due to
unexplained causes, and not hallucinatory at all ; and that
these real sounds provoked the subsequent hallucinations of
vision.
In the same way the tapping at the upstairs window
may have been a real sound, and may have provoked the
apparition of the white face ; for we have no proof that
Visceral Patients are not as liable to the effects of suggestion
as other people.1
In various passages throughout this review I contrast
the rarity of bisensory hallucinations among Visceral Patients
with their comparative frequency among Psychical Percipients,
and claim that herein lies a broad differentiation between
the two.
But if we find, first, that bisensory hallucinations do occur
among Visceral Patients, and, secondly, that in the only
example of them which Dr. Head quotes the auditory part of
the compound hallucination seems to have preceded the appari
tion and thus to resemble a large number of very doubtfully
bisensory cases contained in the Census, it follows that
" bisensoriness " alone, when the auditory part is non-vocal
and precedes the visual part of the hallucination, is no
longer in itself a sufficient mark of differentiation. Differences
must therefore be looked for in other directions ; and this I
propose to do in the following sections.
1In Section XVIII., however, I point out that such evidence as there is
tends to show that Visceral Patients are less susceptible to suggestion than the
ordinary run of people.
li] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 309
X. "Amongst [Dr. Head's] cases the hallucinations assumed
the form of tapping or knocking (eleven cases), the sound of one
or more bells (seven cases), a low whistling sound (one case), a
sound like treading or heavy footsteps (one case), and a sort of
breathing or inarticulate whispering (one case)."
In Census cases where an auditory hallucination immediately
preceded a visual or tactile hallucination, we find the follow
ing forms :
A percipient " was sitting at tea talking with his wife when
he heard a distinct knocking at the window. He . . . turned
round and saw his grandmother. He saw her face quite
clearly— in the bonnet and cape that she used to wear, and
saw her hand in the attitude of having just tapped at the
window. . . . It was about 5 o'clock in April—full daylight.
. . . He has never had any experience of the kind before or
since." (226)
The hallucination coincided with the death of the per
cipient's grandmother : and the figure displayed none of the
characteristics of the Visceral type ; and it will be noticed
that the percipient was engaged in conversation at the time
(v. XL).
" / was awaked by a rattling noise at the window. . . .
The rattle came again in a few minutes, and I sat up in
bed, and distinctly saw the image of one of my step-brothers
. . . pass from the window towards the door. . . . / was in
good health and spirits." (227-8)
The hallucination coincided with the death of the step
brother, whose illness was unknown to the family; and was
unique in the percipient's experience.
" I heard a knocking and turned to the door. I saw an
individual, a man who was once my master, and he said :
' Well, Agnes, how are you?' ' Oh, it's Mr. Middleton.' He
then vanished. [I was] sitting talking to my husband, in
good health. . . . My husband saw nothing, but heard the
knocking."
This percipient had " never had any other hallucinations
of sight, but a week or two after this, she and her husband
used to hear constant knockings or hammerings at night."
(370-1)
310 J. G. Piddington. [PART
The first experience took place 6 days before the wife's
confinement. The second experience, auditory (non-vocal) only
and shared by the husband, who had likewise shared in the
(non-vocal) auditory part of the first, occurred within a week
or two of the husband's sudden death. It will be noted that
in the first hallucination there was first a non-vocal and
afterwards a vocal hallucination. The apparition of the figure
preceded the percipient's reception of the news of the death
of Mr. Middleton by less than 20 hours.
" / had just put out the candle when footsteps were heard
in the adjacent room—a sound of slippers shuffling, I might
say." (385)
The visual hallucination that followed shows the following
divergences from the Visceral type :
Variety of colours in dress of figure. Percipient " not
frightened " and fell asleep with a " sense of joy." The figure
spoke and moved, and made two distinct gestures. The hallu
cination was tri-sensory—auditory (non-vocal and vocal), visual
and tactile ; and was seen by the light of a sulphur match.
The experience was not collective, but the same figure
appeared on the same night to a second person, and spoke
words of the same purport as to the first percipient.
I next give a resumt of a local apparition case where though
non-vocal sounds did precede they did not by any means
immediately precede the usual hallucination.
According to the first-hand account of the percipient she was
awakened . . . by a tremendous noise apparently in tlie nezt
suite of rooms, as if some huge iron boxes ami other heavy things
were being thrown about with great force. This continued about
half-an-hour, and was followed first by a noise as if the fire in
a room underneath were being violently poked and raked for
some minutes, and then by a most terrible and distressing cough
ing of a man. The same things went on at night during the
rest of her week's visit.
On a second visit to the haunted house a year later tfie
same percipient heard a very noisy martial footstep ascending
the stairs, and then marching quickly up and down the
corridor outside her room. Then violent coughing, and after
wards the footsteps again.
Some nights later she saw a long, very thin, very dark
Li.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 311
black figure bending over a Bible. The figure, apparently
disturbed, though not dissipated, by movement on the per
cipient's part (v. I. I), suddenly darted up, jumped off the
ivindow-ledge, on to the wash-stand, and thence to the ground,
and flitted quickly across the room, in the direction of a table
on which were a lot of bangles and rings. The percipient
then heard a slight jingle as if some one were feeling quietly
her bangles and rings (341-3).
If Dr. Head's theory that the form of the hallucinations of
Visceral Patients depends on the position of the headache be
correct, it is only to be expected (as, indeed, nearly always
seems to be the case) that a considerable interval should
elapse between the occurrence of a hallucination of hearing
and of a hallucination of vision. So we might expect
to find in such a case as this last one, where a long interval
elapsed between the first hallucination of hearing and the
subsequent hallucination of sight, to find a closer resemblance
to the Visceral type than in the foregoing cases where the
visual immediately followed the auditory hallucination. So far,
however, from there being any closer resemblance, the differences
are quite as marked, as the following considerations show.
Except for one tactile and visual hallucination some three
years previously, the percipient had experienced no other halluci
nations, and these were her only auditory hallucinations, and
they all occurred in the same house, and that a house which
she visited only at intervals. According to the percipient's
own account, the regular inmates of the house constantly
heard similar sounds. Once a similar figure had been seen,
and at least on one occasion a second person had heard the
same strange noises as herself. The auditory hallucinations
were at first unaccompanied by a visual hallucination, and
when the figure did appear it was not preceded but followed
by an auditory (non-vocal) hallucination. On the occasion
of the first manifestation of the noises the percipient expressly
states that she " did not feel a bit scared " (v. XIII.) : nor
apparently was she on subsequent occasions. The figure,
though very black, and though it did not speak (I. TO), was
anything but stationary (v. I. h) : and the experience was
simultaneously bisensory on one occasion, namely, when the
figure was seen and the jingling was heard.
312 J. G. Piddington. [PART
There are two instances only in the Census Report which
furnish a strictly parallel phenomenon to the auditory halluci
nations of Visceral Patients. The first case was not included
in the Census statistics because the sounds, though vocal,
were not articulate, and because no other sense than that
of hearing was affected : but it was printed in the Report
because " the impression was a perfectly definite one, and
unique in the experience of the percipient," and because the
evidence for a telepathic origin seemed strong.
The percipient living in Dunbar heard one evening about
10 p.m., while preparing to go to bed, some one sobbing.
After satisfying herself that the sobbing did not proceed
from any one in the house, she at once thought there must
be something the matter with her greatest friend who at the
time was living in Lincolnshire. She wrote three days later
to ask her friend if on the night in question she had been
crying.
The friend replied that she had been crying on account of
pain caused by toothache : and had thought of the percipient,
and wished intensely that she was with her. (291)
Evidentially the coincidence is well-established : and the
percipient had never had a similar experience.
The second instance crops up incidentally among informa
tion supplied by a percipient who had had already sent an
account of a coincidental articulate hallucination of hearing
which he had experienced collectively with his father and
cousin.
" Mr. Cary further informs us that he has had no other
hallucinations except the hearing of footsteps. He heard them
first in 1879 [i.e. four years after his articulate hallucination]
and his brother died shortly after. He did not then know
that such sounds were regarded as premonitory of a death.
He has heard them twice since, and on each occasion a cousin
of his died. His father also had heard them more than
once, and each time lost a brother." (316)
The evidence is of course sadly lacking in detail : but the
object of the enquiries addressed by the Committee to the
percipient was not to obtain evidence of coincidence between
non-vocal hallucinations and deaths, but to ascertain the extent
of the percipient's susceptibility to auditory hallucination.
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 313
In conclusion I quote one specimen each of cases %vhere
non-vocal hallucinations were followed and perhaps accom
panied by a hallucination of some other sense than that of
sight.
A percipient lying in bed convalescent from, an attack of
scarlet rash, unaccompanied, however, by fever or derange
ment of consciousness, felt her bed shaken under her, and
heard a gurgling noise, and a distinct cry for help. (269)
It will be noticed that unlike the cases observed by Dr.
Head the inarticulate auditory hallucination was preceded by
a tactile hallucination.
The hallucination coincided very closely in time with the
death by drowning of a cousin.
Non-vocal noises play a considerable part in the alleged
phenomena of haunted houses : but in many cases there is
very little reason to attribute them to any but ordinary
causes, even where they are followed by undoubted halluci
nations of vision (v. 180, and 340).
In one case (346-9), however, a collective visual halluci
nation (perhaps collectively auditory (non-vocal) also) preceded
by a few days a collective auditory (non-vocal) and visual
hallucination, and was later on followed by a series of
non-vocal hallucinations. The figure first seen does not con
form to the Visceral type ; for, apart from its having been
seen collectively, its sex was recognised («. I. e) ; it was
not stationary, it walked downstairs (v. I. h); its dress rustled
{I. j), and its clothes contained colour (v. III.) ; and it appeared
during " a bright summer afternoon " (v. IV.). A few days
later, during a meal, all the members of the family heard
the latch of a door lifted and saw a shadow go quickly up
the stairs. Subsequently non-articulate noises of various kinds
were heard either collectively or singly by members of the
family during a considerable period of time. They are
described as follows:
" The noises in the house were at times almost unbearable—
exactly as though half-a-ton of coals had been shot down the
stairs. Mother never act.ually saw the old woman, though she
constantly followed tlie sound of the footsteps up the stairs
to try and discover what it could be ; and once . . . she heard
it come downstairs, and made up her mind she would look ;
314 J. G. Piddington. [PART
~
but directly the door began to open she covered her face,
and distinctly heard it come all round the room and go
out leaving the door open." (346-9)
Eventually the father while suffering from " one of his
favourite bilious attacks heard some one coming, and in
walked the old woman." This was the last straw, and the
family left the house : and the next inmates are said to
have left after a short stay on account of the " awful
noises."
The collectivity of these hallucinations of hearing is alone
sufficient to distinguish them from the non-vocal auditory
hallucinations of Visceral Patients; and, as another broad dis
tinction, I note that the non-vocal sounds heard by Psychical
Percipients are much more varied in character and are also
perhaps more violent than the sounds heard by Visceral Patients.
The former frequently hear several different kinds of noises
together or in rapid succession, whereas the latter appear to
hear only one kind of noise at a time.
XI. " These hallucinations usually occur at night. But as it
is only necessary for their appearance that disturbing noises
should be absent, they may occur during the day if the patient
is in a quiet place ; for as light was found to be a disturbing
factor in the case of visual hallucinations, so external noise
seems to prevent the appearance of auditory hallucinations."
Light is emphatically not a disturbing factor in the case of
Psychical visual hallucinations, and so we might expect that
external noises would not check the development of Psychical
auditory hallucinations.
But the question is not so simple as in the case of visual
hallucinations, and a clear and categorical answer cannot be
made to it. And this for various reasons.
In the first place it is a much easier matter to distinguish
a visual hallucination from a visual illusion than it is to dis
tinguish an auditory hallucination from an auditory illusion.
In the second place, there is an absolute lack of direct
evidence with regard to the absence or presence of external
noise at the moment of the occurrence of auditory hallucina-
ions ; and in only a few cases can the acoustic conditions be
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 315
In the third place, even if direct evidence on this point
were given by percipients, it would in many cases be open to
suspicion. A person may easily be conscious of more than
one visual impression simultaneously, but unless a special
effort be made to observe accurately, I think our ordinary
experience is that though we may have been conscious at a
given moment of more than one sound, when we cross-examine
our memory afterwards one sound has survived to the exclusion
of all others ; not necessarily the loudest, but the one which
had most interest for us. The spontaneity of auditory
hallucinations makes it extremely unlikely that any one at
the moment of experiencing them would make that special
effort at accurate contemporaneous observation which I
imagine is necessary in order to ascertain if more than one
sound were audible at a given time.
These considerations lead me to question how much reliance
can be placed on Dr. Head's statement, cautiously and some
what vaguely expressed though it be, that " external noise
seems to prevent the appearance of auditory hallucinations."
I fancy that a safer, though far more awkwardly expressed,
statement might run somewhat in this fashion : If sounds,
claimed to be hallucinatory, occur under conditions when it
is known or suspected that external noises were being or
could have been simultaneously heard by the percipient, the
chances in favour of the sounds having been real sounds
misinterpreted are largely increased. Hence sounds claimed
as hallucinatory which occur at night or at other quiet times
are more likely than sounds occurring in daytime to be
accepted as hallucinatory not only by the hearer but by the
critic*
I have called Dr. Head's statement somewhat vague, for he
speaks of " external noise " without explaining whether any
degree, however small, of external noise is sufficient to prevent
an auditory hallucination, or whether its intensity matters.
Would, for instance, a Visceral Patient, whose nights were
passed within earshot of an electric-light generating station,
be preserved from auditory hallucinations by the monotonous
whirr of the engines ?
The Census Committee believed that " a state of repose
is favourable to hallucinations." " We find," they write, "...
.
316 J. G. Piddington. [PART
that in 38 per cent, of visual, 34 per cent, of auditory, and
44 P&r cent, of tactile cases, the percipient was in bed, or
(in a very few cases) had been sleeping in his chair or
elsewhere.
" Considering what a small part of our lives we generally
spend awake in bed, the fact that over $ of the hallucinations
occur under these circumstances is certainly remarkable, and
the proportion that occurs immediately after waking—about
12 per cent, of visual hallucinations—is still more striking."
(171)
If, then, we do not press Dr. Head's words " external
noise seems to prevent the appearance of auditory hallucina
tions " too closely, we may say that much the same conditions
favour the development of auditory hallucinations in the case
of Visceral Patients as in the case of Psychical Percipients ;
or rather, perhaps, a state of repose favours not so much the
development as the recognition by percipient or psychologist,
patient or physician, of certain sounds as hallucinatory.
If we turn now to the Census Report, we shall find that
neither a state of repose nor absence of external noise
necessarily prevents the hearing of hallucinatory sounds, or at
least of sounds supposed by their hearers to be hallucinatory.
For the purpose of elucidating this particular point I include
Psychical cases of articulate hallucinations of hearing ; though
it must be borne in mind that, strictly speaking, by the very
fact of their articulateness they are differentiated from the
inarticulate hallucinations of Visceral Patients.
The first case serves incidentally to illustrate the doubt
that a percipient himself may feel as to the genuinely
hallucinatory character of an experience occurring amid noises
indubitably external.
" / was a captain in the staff of the army at the siege
of Delhi, in 1857; and, among other duties, often carried
orders and messages for the general in command.
" On one occasion I was sent by the general with some
message or orders for Sir Charles Reid, who commanded all
our advanced posts along the well-known ' ridge.'
"He was not at his headquarters, but had gone towards
extreme right and most exposed part of the ridge, so,
'ng my horse under cover, I proceeded on foot along
LL] Review of Dr. Head!8 Goulstonian Lectures. 317
tlie road towards the 'right battery.' Just as I reached a
turn of the road, which was specially dangerous owing to
Us being enfiladed by Hie enemy's guns in position, I heard
my name called out, on the left hand, and, seeing a group
of officers standing by the breastwork which lined the front
of our position, I went towards them ; and, just as I left
the road, the spot was torn up by a shower of grape-shot,
which, had I been there, must have killed me ! As I approached
the officers, among whom I expected to find Sir C. Reid, one
of them remarked on the narrow escape I had just had : but,
on my asking why they had called out to me, I was told to my
utter surprise, that no one had done so ! / heard the summons,
however, which saved my life ; and whether I fancied that
some other of the many sound* in the air at the time was
my somewhat peculiar name, or whether the call to me at
that fortunate moment was a ' spirit voice,' as one, of my
friends at once pronounced it, or was altogether the product
of my own imagination : the facts remain that I heard, or
tkought I heard, an unrecognised voice summon me from
the road ; that by obeying the summons I escaped death, or
at any rate very serious wounding ; and that no human
being had so called out to me!" (337)
If this was a real hallucination, it would be difficult to
imagine stronger evidence of its having been accompanied by
external noise.
The Report refers to, but does not quote, a case where a
percipient states that she heard a voice saying, " cross the
road," just before a runaway horse came round the corner
(337). Here an obvious explanation suggests itself: namely,
that the noise made by the runaway horse was subconsciously
heard by the percipient and gave rise to the hallucination :
a phenomenon not to be confused with the misinterpretation of
an external sound. But, whatever the cause may have been,
the hallucination, if such it was, can hardly not have been
accompanied by external noise.
As regards non-vocal cases, one case of coincidental sobbing
already referred to (v. X., p. 312) illustrates the difficulty of
determining the acoustic conditions accompanying a hallucination
of hearing. The percipient was " preparing to go to bed " :
and at least two other inmates of the house were still up,
~
318 J. G. Piddington. [PART
one of whom came into the percipient's room just after she had
heard the sobs. It is conceivable, of course, that at the precise
moment when the hallucination occurred a temporary silence
may have reigned throughout the house, but it appears more
likely that external noise cannot have been wholly absent.
For other instances we must have recourse to cases of local
apparitions, of which, says the Report, " one of the most
commonly reported features ... is the frequent occurrence
of alarmmg and unaccountable noises in the house." These
noises, the Report states, " are generally, though not invari
ably, reported to be heard at night."
In a case already referred to (v. X., p. 313) a family are
seated at dinner, when apparently all and certainly most of
them heard the lifting of the latch of a door leading into the
garden, and several of them thereupon saw the door open,
and a shadow go quickly upstairs.
When a family, especially one comprising several children—
as did this one—is at dinner, it would be almost miraculous
if external noise were absent. But though other previous
and subsequent experiences in the same house were, un
doubtedly, hallucinatory, it does not necessarily follow that
the sound of the door-latch was, for it may possibly have
been a real sound, which provoked the visual hallucination
and the subsequent hallucinations of hearing ; though if it
were so, the family must have had a strong family suscepti
bility to suggestion. A similar ambiguity presents itself in
another Haunted House case, where one of the percipients
writes :
" Chief, when we were all working in the room . . . toe
distinctly heard knocking at the door, and on calling out ' come
in' there was no response." (353)
External noise must almost certainly have been going on, but
was the knocking hallucinatory, and would it have been given a
second thought except for the visual hallucinations which had
preceded and which followed it ? Still, although when taken by
itself such a phenomenon as this knocking has little chance
of being accepted as hallucinatory, when other alleged pheno
mena reported by other percipients in the same case are
taken into consideration, there seems to me to be strong
unds for regarding not only the knocking but also the
Review of Dr. Head's Gowlstonian Lectures. 319
other mysterious noises which formed a prominent feature
of the hauntings as hallucinatory. Thus the percipient quoted
above writes :
" 1 continually heard the. most real and awful groans and
•various sorts of noises, which could not be accounted for in any
•way. . . ." And again : " The apparition was generally seen in
or near Mr. S.'s bedroom and dressing room, where also
mysterious noises—whinings, voices and taps—icere often heard
by several members of the household."
I quote below the strongest evidence to be found in the
Census Report for the perception of an auditory hallucination
during the occurrence of external noise.
" 1 went with my mother into his room at about three
o'clock in the afternoon, and as we opened the wardrobe
door, we heard the most appalling noise. The only thing
I can at all compare it to is the letting loose of a quantity
of clock machinery, and yet that doesn't describe it, and it
-was more violent, while it lasted, which was about half a
minute : we clung together in terror, and then we looked
everywhere for an explanation, but could find none, and
never have. No one else in the house heard it, though it was
so loud, and we never heard it again." (353-4)
XII. (a) "The feeling-tone that accompanies these auditory
hallucinations varies greatly in intensity, but is almost invari
ably unpleasant. Two patients only described their hallucina
tions as pleasant."
The above probably holds good in Psychical cases, at least
in non-vocal hallucinations. That the feeling-tone should be
almost invariably unpleasant stands to reason, for any sound
—whether ultimately regarded as hallucinatory or not—of
which the cause remains unexplained, is much more likely
than not to give rise to an uncomfortable feeling of insecurity
or uncanniness, particularly if heard in the dark or at night.
Rare instances, however, do occur (v., e.g., Phantasms of the
Living, vol. ii., 220-3, and 639-41, and S.P.R. Journal,
vol. ix., pp. 88-90) where non-vocal hallucinatory sounds
are said to have produced an agreeable effect: or where it
may be inferred that the effect must have been pleasing,
although not directly stated to have been so: v., e.g., (162)
320 J. G. Piddington. [part
a case of an auditory hallucination of " elaborate music being
played."
(6) " The intensity of such hallucinations of hearing is very
variable. Sometimes they consist of a continuous sound suci
as a whistle, sometimes of a series of sounds of equal intensity
(knocking and tapping). Sometimes the sound begins softly and
works up to a bang, or it may even rise and fall in intensity.''
Examples of all the above varieties of sounds are to be
found among Fsychical cases of non-vocal auditory hallucina
tion.
(c) " In all cases these sounds have a curious insistent
quality. The patient is unable to listen to anything else unless
he be directly spoken to, nor can he distract his attention from
the sound as it would have been possible had it not been
hallucinatory."
On this point lack of evidence makes it impossible to
say whether similar symptoms obtain in the case of Psychical
Percipients. In 62 per cent, of Psychical visual hallucina
tions the percipient was alone, and, though no analysis was
made of auditory hallucinations in order to discover the con
dition of the percipient in respect of solitude, the Report
states that 34 per cent, of them occurred when the percipient
was in bed, and in a very large proportion of these cases it
is probable that the percipient was alone. Few opportunities
would therefore present themselves of testing whether a
Psychical Percipient is unable to " listen to anything else
unless directly spoken to," or whether he can distract his
attention from the hallucinatory sound : and rarer still would
be the occasions on which such an opportunity would be
seized ; and even if the experiment were attempted it would
remain doubtful whether the termination of the halluciua-
tion was brought about by the intrusion of nn objective
sound, or whether the termination of the one merely coin
cided with the beginning of the other. The nearest approach
to a parallel that I can find in the Census Peport occurs in
the case of Mr. Mamtchitch, whose experiences have alreadr
been referred to above. He writes: " Chaque fois, en voyant
Palladia inopineinent, je perds la parole, je sens du froid
dans le dos, je palis, je m'ecrie faiblement, et ma respira
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 321
tion s'arrete (c'est ce que me disent ceux qui par hasard
m'ont observe" pendant ce moment)." But here the hallucina
tions, which recurred frequently, were with two exceptions
visual only.
XIII. " The patient is usually frightened, and this fear is
usually associated with sweating, with ' beating ' of the heart,
and ' goose-flesh.' One very intelligent patient told me she
was much more frightened by the tapping on the wall than if
it had been real tapping."
The Psychical Percipient of a non-vocal auditory hallucina
tion is also usually frightened, though not always (v. e.g. 341),
a good deal no doubt depending on the impressionability of
his temperament and on his physical condition at the time.
His fright, too, at least in some cases, is associated with some
of the usual physical concomitants. But I do not believe
that fright or its physical concomitants are typical symptoms
of either Psychical or Visceral auditory hallucinations : and
they would be equally found to occur in a large proportion
of cases where people hear real sounds which they cannot
explain or which they suspect of being indicative of the action
or presence of some unwelcome person, animal, or thing : e.g.
of a burglar, a madman, of a rat or cat, or of a fire.
THE MENTAL CHANGES IN GENERAL.
XIV. " These mental changes are recognised by the patients
themselves, and in some cases are associated by them with
the first appearance or progress of their disease."
The Census Committee, after cutting out a certain number
(23) of experiences which occurred during diseases known to
be associated with hallucination, felt bound, in view of the
numerical comparison to be made of seemingly veridical with
purely subjective cases, to retain in their statistical tables
123 cases of hallucination experienced by persons suffering
from some form of illness with which hallucination was not
at the time known to be associated.
In 21 out of these 123 retained cases " the percipient was
in a state of convalescence after some illness—the nature of
322 J. 0. Piddington. [part
which is not specified, but which was apparently acute—or
recovering from a recent operation, or on the verge of a severe
Ulness." (160)
Of this last division (with which alone we are here
concerned) the Report contains two examples, and in each
the percipient regarded his experience as the precursory
symptom of an illness. Yet neither hallucination, as will be
seen, conforms to the Visceral type, doubtless because neither
heralded the approach of a disease of visceral origin.
Professor G. " saw an old woman with red cloak, nursing
a child in her arms." The figure was seen out of doors in
bright sunny weather. On another occasion he saw a dog
beside him. Each hallucination occurred when the percipient
was suffering from slight attacks of insomnia, due to over
work ; and he notes that in each case " a severe illness
followed." (103)
Mrs. 1). from a child was subject to hallucinations of
various kinds, visual and auditory : and she noted that there
was a distinct connection between their appearance and
trouble of some sort at the nervous centres. Most of her
experiences took place during severe attacks of " neuralgia
in the right side of the head," " acute pain in the temple,"
or " neuralgia in the hip and knee." Once, however, when
apparently not suffering from any of these attacks of pain,
she experienced a recurrent hallucination which she associated
with the oncoming of an infectious disease, and which she
thus describes :
" At a later period I was nursing a member of my
family suffering from an infectious disease, the course of
which had already taken a favourable turn, -when, on going
to the bedroom early one morning, I saw a large half-bred
black retriever sitting in an angle of the stairs. I sent a
servant down and ascertained there was no dog there, but
continued to see it; and at last it became a fear to me to
pass the landing from which I saw it, and I avoided going
down the stairs. During the visitations of the black dog, it
was always visible in the corner of the stairs ivhenever I
looked at the place. It never changed its position; and in
the end, one night, feeling very ill, I fainted on the stairs,
having sickened with the same disease. I had noted the day
Li.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 323
on which the apparition of the dog began; it was between
four and Jive days after, according to the usual calculation,
I had begun to sicken with the malady. The duration of
this hallucination distinguishes it from others which I have
had when seriously ill, and which may have been of the
nature of delirium, and which I will not, therefore, recapitu
late here." (409)
XV. Recurrence is a marked characteristic of the halluci
nations experienced by patients suffering from visceral disease.
Dr. Head does not quote statistics, but that such is the case
appears clearly, not only from several passages in the lectures,
but also from the detailed reports of cases given in the Appendix.
Dr. Head does not state whether recurrence is the more marked
in auditory or in visual cases.1
Using the term in the same sense as it is employed in the
Census Report I mean by recurrence, not that the patient is
subject to successive and miscellaneous hallucinations affecting
different senses, but to repeated hallucinations of the same
sense, the percepts, if not remaining entirely unchanged, at
least manifesting a general resemblance to each other.
Recurrent hallucinations, as will be seen from the appended
quotations, are experienced by Psychical Percipients ; but so
far as I can judge, they are nothing like so common as among
Visceral Patients. I think it would be fair to say that whereas
recurrence is the rule in Visceral cases it is the exception in
Psychical cases. It is further interesting to note, in view of
Dr. Head's observations, that the recurrence of hallucinations
was found by the Census Committee to be especially marked
in cases occurring during ill-health.
That the connection between recurrence and ill-health was
less marked in the auditory cases contained in the Census
collection may have been due to the exclusion from it of
purely non-vocal auditory hallucinations.
i Dr. Head tells me that it is a difficult matter to state the amount of
recurrence except in a very general way. The detailed record of cases contained
in the Appendix to Dr. Head's lectures had led me to suppose that in a
considerable number of cases a hallucination might recur 10 or 20 times. I
gather from a conversation with Dr. Head that this is by no means an over
estimate, and that in many cases the hallucinations could be reckoned by
the score, and even in a few cases by the hundred.
324 J. G. Piddington. [PART
" When several hallucinations are experienced by the same
percipient they are in some cases scattered throughout his
whole life, or a long period of it, and in others, even when
numerous, they are confined to a comparatively short period.
[References to specimen cases here follow. The two instances
given of recurrence confined to a short period of time both
differ from the Visceral type]. . . Again, while in most cases
the successive hallucinations are apparently quite miscel
laneous, in others they show a more or less marked tendency
to repeat themselves, the same hallucination occurring again
and again."
" We find 71 cases of this kind of recurrence in visual
hallucinations. By " recurrence " we do not mean necessarily
an exact reproduction, but that the general resemblance is
enough to make the percipient regard the successive halluci
nations as representing the same person or thing, or,
in the case of animals, the same species of animal. Thus
in [a case numbered 37'13] the percipient was wakened
by clothes falling off her bed, and saw a figure in profile,
with a lilac print dress and white apron, standing at the
other end of the room. On another occasion she was wakened
by feeling her hand clutched, and saw a figure of a woman
in a similar costume facing her. Here the general resemblance
was enough to make the percipient regard the figures as
representing the same person. [Note how the colour (v. III.)
in the first experience, and the tactile hallucination (v. XVIII.)
preceding the visual in the second, distinguish these cases
from the Visceral type.] " Again, [in a case numbered 280'20]
the percipient saw the face of his brother in a wide-awake
hat look in at the door of his room in the evening. The
same night he woke and saw the upper half of his brother
standing by his bed, looking at him. [The recognition of
the figure, and of its sex, and the hat distinguish this from
a Visceral case.] We count both these cases as recurrent, in
spite of the slight differences between the impressions on the
different occasions. In most of the recurrent cases, the various
appearances seem to have resembled one another more closely
than in these." (103)
" Auditory and tactile hallucinations appear to be repeated
much more frequently in proportion than visual hallucina

lions . . . but this seems to follow naturally from the smaller
variety of form to be found in auditory and tactile cases.
The repetition of hallucinations is—as might be expected
—especially marked in cases occurring during ill-health. If
the 106 visual cases reported to us in which the percipient
was in ill health, 16, or 15 per cent., were recurrent. It
-should be said that 7 of these are among the 19 cases which
neemed so clearly due to ill-health that we have excluded them
jrom, the tables ; but recurrence is also found in over 10
per cent, of the remainder, whereas, of all the visual cases
included in the Census, only 71, or 5'5 per cent, were recurrent.
The connection between recurrence and ill health is less
marked in the auditory and tactile cases. Of the 40 auditory
and tactile cases reported to us as occurring during HI
health, 18, or 45 per cent., were recurrent, while of all the
•auditory and tactile cases included in the Census, 181, or
-36 per cent, were recurrent." (164)
Recurrence is no doubt fairly common in "local appari
tion " cases. Fortunately the Society has made it a rule
to attach no evidential weight to alleged hauntings, unless
the phenomena are testified to by more than one percipient.
Otherwise it is far from improbable that the experiences of
persons suffering from visceral disease would have been accepted
as evidence for " local " apparitions.
It is easy to see how the hallucinations of a person attacked
by some visceral disease might easily be mistaken for a
" local apparition " case. The hallucinations may begin at
the onset of the disease, and therefore before, in the great
majority of cases, its presence is recognised : and the patient
accordingly might quite innocently report himself as being,
•or even as having been at the time, in ordinary health. Since
also the visual hallucinations occur in the dark a patient
would experience them in 19 cases out of 20 in his bedroom,
which would thus become the " Haunted Room," and the ghost
would be properly " localised." The recurrence of the pheno
menon would go to prove that it was not an illusion, and
might further be held to support the view that it was not
purely subjective. With the progress of the disease the form
of the hallucinations might change, and if they became audi
tory we should have the phenomenon of non-vocal noises
326 J. G. Piddington. [PART
so characteristic of cases of " Haunted Houses." Such a
possibility is not, I think it will be admitted, very remote.
But, as I have already said, the danger has been largely
guarded against by the Society's demand for corroborative
evidence. Not entirely guarded against, it is true, for it is-
quite possible that two or more members of the same house
hold, and especially of the same family, might be suffering
simultaneously, or might suffer successively from some form
of visceral disease : and then there might be not only two-
or more witnesses to the phenomena, but in view of the
uniformity of Visceral hallucinations, their description of their
experiences might tally to a singular degree. If a second
inmate of the same house developed a visceral disease accom
panied by hallucinations a year or two after the first patient,
we should hear of a " recrudescence " of the phenomena. But
the case for " haunted houses " does not depend for protection
against such an attack as I have suggested solely on corro
borative evidence. Let alone the points of differentiation
from Visceral hallucinations drawn from " Local Apparition "
cases contained in the Census Report, to which I have
already directed attention in this review, any one can satisfy
himself as to the want of any real resemblance between
the hallucinations of Visceral patients and those reported by
residents in haunted houses, if he will take the trouble to-
study carefully half-a-dozen " local apparition " cases picked
at random from the Proceedings or Journal.
XVI. ' ' Sex plays a considerable part in the facility with which
[these mental changes] occur. For three times as many women
as men had hallucinations during their stay in hospital, although
the total number of cases used in this research comprised 102 men
and 90 women."
" The number of men who experience sensory hallucinations
and remember them is to the number of women who do so
in the ratio of nearly 2 to 3 " . . .
" Men appear to forget their hallucinations more rapidly
than women." (152-3)
The greater liability of women to hallucinations holds good
of Psychical Percipients : though the disproportion is-
smaller.
I
Li.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 327
No addition such as was made by the Census Committee
need be made to the number of hallucinations experienced
by Dr. Head's male patients by way of allowance for forgetful-
ness : for under the particular circumstances forgetfulness cannot
have played any appreciable part. On the other hand, Dr.
Head reduced the number of hallucinations experienced by his
female patients on the ground that certain conditions peculiar
to their sex favour the appearance of hallucinations. How
large this reduction was is not stated : but I should imagine
that it amounted to at least one-sixth of the total number.
Whether or no the same cause predisposes women in
general to hallucination, and whether or no a similar reduc
tion might consequently have been made in the number of
hallucinations reported to the Census Committee by female
percipients, it remains true in any case that the excess of
hallucinations of female over those of male patients suffering
from visceral disease is very much larger than the excess
of hallucinations of female over those of male Psychical
Percipients.
But this also is clear, that even if very large allowances
be made for forgetfulness among men and predisposing causes
among women, women, whether suffering from a visceral
disease or not, are more subject to hallucinations than men.
XVII. "It is uncommon to find two hallucinations occurring
together at the same moment. One patient told me she heard
tapping at an upstairs window, and, looking, saw a white face.
But in the great majority of instances, if a patient suffers from
hallucinations of more than one kind, these hallucinations occur
on entirely separate occasions."
Or, translated into the phraseology of the Census Report, the
hallucinations of sufferers from visceral disease are only very
rarely bisensory.
But the word bisensory is used to cover two similar but
not identical phenomena, between which there seems to me
to be a not unimportant distinction. Bisensory hallucinations,
as I have observed above, are of two kinds, those which are
simultaneously and those which are successively bisensory.
It is, however, more often than not impossible to draw
the line in any one given instance ; and the case quoted
328 J. G. Piddington. [PABT
in the heading of this section is an excellent illustration of
this ambiguity. From the fact of Dr. Head preluding his
citation of the case by speaking of " two hallucinations
occurring together at the same moment" it might be inferred
that the senses of hearing and sight were really affected
" together at the same moment," but Dr. Head's account of
the incident is not sufficiently definite to establish the
real simultaneity of the double hallucination ; and we are, I
think, justified in asking : Did the auditory really overlap
the visual hallucination ? or, in other words, did not the
woman cease to hear the tapping when she saw the face ?
Had the patient been cross-examined even within a few
minutes of her experience she could not probably have given
a confident answer. This ambiguity attaches, I believe, to
the majority of bisensory hallucinations : but there are a few
cases where the two senses were beyond question affected
simultaneously. (For instances see 192; 195-196; 389-390
385-6; 252; and 295-6.)
But to revert to the one bisensory case all too briefly
mentioned by Dr. Head. Was it really bisensory ? The white
face seen by the patient was no doubt hallucinatory, but the
tapping may have been a real sound rightly perceived and
localised, or an illusion, i.e. a real sound, rightly perceived, and
wrongly localised, or wrongly perceived and rightly localised,
or both wrongly localised and wrongly perceived. If the
tapping was an illusion or a real sound, the case would then
fall into line with those cases in the Census Collection where
a noise (as the Committee was led to believe) induced a
(subsequent) visual hallucination " by creating in the hearer
a strong expectation of seeing something corresponding to it
or that may account for it." (178)
But, again, was the hearing of the tapping at the window
and the seeing of the face a hallucination of the Visceral type
at all? There is no reason why visceral disease should exempt
a patient from all liability to hallucinations except those charac
teristic of the disease. And it is quite possible that among
the 192 patients under Dr. Head's observation some few
may have experienced hallucinations for the form of which
their disease was not in any way responsible.
I regret that Dr. Head did not deal in greater detail with
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 329
these " uncommon " cases of bisensory hallucination among his
patients ; for had he done so we should have been in a
better position to judge not only whether both affections of
the senses were hallucinatory, and how far these bisensory
hallucinations conformed with typical hallucinations of Visceral
patients affecting one sense only, but also what proportion
they bore to hallucinations involving only one sense.
Contenting ourselves, however, with the statement that
they were " uncommon," let us see to what degree bisensory
hallucinations are common or uncommon among Psychical
Percipients. If cases where an auditory non-vocal hallucination
forms one part of the compound hallucination are included
(and these cases form obviously the best basis for a fair com
parison with the Visceral type) in 14 per cent, of the Census
cases more than one sense was affected.
If we omit cases where one part of the compound experience
consisted of a non-vocal sound, the proportion of bisensory
cases falls to 9'5 per cent.
In coincidental cases (i.e. coincidental for the most part with
death, illness, or crises of some kind) the proportion of bi-
and tri-sensory cases rises to 14-5 per cent.; and to 17'5
per cent, if we confine ourselves to visual death coincidences.
On the most unfavourable basis, then, Census cases show
an average of 9-5 per cent, of bisensory hallucinations,
and we only arrive at this low average by excluding from
our calculations the very type of bisensory hallucinations which
alone supplies even a superficial resemblance to the bisensory
hallucinations of visceral patients. On the most favourable
basis the average rises to 17 '5 per cent.
While it would be idle to speculate as to what exact pro
portion Dr. Head meant to indicate by the term " uncommon,"
1 have practically no doubt that he could not have so
described the bisensory cases among his patients had they
represented any such proportions as 14'5 or 17'5 per cent.
I have gone into this question with some care because of
the important part which bisensory hallucinations play in
S.P.R. coincidental or veridical cases. Except for their greater
" impressiveness " (a feature which, I must admit, does not
appear very impressive to me), the only characteristic that
distinguishes veridical from purely subjective cases lies in the
330 J. G. Piddington. [PART
marked preponderance of bi- and tri-sensory hallucinations
which figure among the veridical cases. It is particularly
satisfactory, therefore, to find that between the class of hallu
cinations which from our point of view are of the greatest
importance and the hallucinations of visceral disease lies this-
broad line of cleavage.
XVIII. CHARACTERISTICS OF S.P.R. HALLUCINATIONS
WHICH ARE NOT REPORTED AS OCCURRING IN
VISCERAL HALLUCINATIONS.
In the preceding section I have drawn attention to the
rarity of bisensory hallucinations among patients suffering from
visceral disease, and have, moreover, explained my reasons
for doubting whether in these rare cases the two elements of
the experience are simultaneous, as they unquestionably are
in some S.P.R. cases ; and I have even gone so far as to-
question whether the two elements are both hallucinatory ; in
other words, whether Visceral hallucinations are ever really
bisensory. I now proceed to point out how of certain
extremely characteristic features of S.P.R. hallucinations—
including some of those very features which have led us to
regard the phenomena as " metapsychical "—no trace is to be
found in Dr. Head's account of the hallucinations that
accompany visceral disease. And here we shall be treading on
ground firmer than in the last section, though not quite so
firm as I could wish. For the argument from silence is a
dangerous one ; and I would not draw from Dr. Head's silence
the positive conclusion that none of these features ever presents
itself in the hallucinatory experiences of Visceral Patients.
Let us take first Veridicality, i.e., coincidence between a
hallucination and an event unknown to the hcdlucint. Dr.
Head, who was treating his subject from a medical and not
from a Psychical Research point of view, does not report in
his lectures any case of real or supposed coincidence. He tells
me, however, that, as a matter of fact, some of his patients
did claim that their hallucinations were veridical ; but he did
not examine into these alleged coincidences, as this aspect of
the matter did not lie within his province.
If telepathy is, as we suppose, a vera causa, there is indeed
on the face of it no reason why a person in a morbid physical
LI.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 331
•condition should not experience a genuinely telepathic hallu
cination as much as a person in a healthy condition. The
reason why a coincidental hallucination occurring to a sick person
is less strong as evidence for telepathy than one occurring to
a healthy person is to a great extent because hallucinations
are known to be more frequent in the former case and
therefore afford more scope for chance coincidences with the
death of a friend, or some such event.
Dr. Head has, as will be seen on reference to the quotation
•which heads section VIII., noted that when visual hallucinations
were accompanied by the depressed mood his patients were
given to regard the apparition as a sign of some coming
misfortune, such, e.y., as the death of some member of their
family. In his lectures he does not say if the patients ever
•enquired whether their fears were realised. He has told me,
however, that, at least in some cases, such enquiries were
made, and resulted occasionally in a coincidence of some sort
being claimed.
Now we have seen (see footnote to XV.) that hallucinations
are extraordinarily frequent among Visceral Patients; and
accordingly some real or fancied coincidences were almost
bound to occur.
One of the strangest points about Psychical coincidental cases
is that the hallucinations of the percipients which furnish ex
amples of coincidence are, in the great majority of instances,
unique or almost unique experiences in their lives. But, it may
be objected, the hallucinations were not really unique; it was only
the coincidences which were unique, and which thus have been
remembered, while the frequent non-coincidental hallucinations
have been forgotten. Well, even if large allowance be made
for this source of error, there still remains another feature of
Psychical veridical cases to explain away, namely, their vivid
ness. A Visceral visual hallucination, consisting as it does of a
veiled figure of uncertain sex, speechless, gestureless, wearing no
distinctive clothing, armless and legless, beardless, the face misty
•or even invisible, could not furnish instances of coincidence
anything like so circumstantial as do the more vividly exter
nalised figures seen by Psychical Percipients. Coincidence, then
of a kind does, no doubt, exist between the hallucinations of
Visceral Patients and external events, but not coincidence of
332 /. G. Piddington. [PART
the definite and vivid description which characterises a large
number of the veridical cusos collected by the S.P.R.
I have spoken of coincidence or veridicality as a character
istic of Psychical hallucinations for the sake of convenience ;
for, of course, coincidence is a matter of subsequent inference,
and does not • form a part of the actual experience of the
percipients, as do other features of which I am now going to
speak.
Of these the most conspicuous by its absence from the
reported experiences of Visceral Patients is Collectivity. Here
again (and the same observation applies to " local " cases),
there is no reason why this phenomenon—or a mimicry of it
—should not present itself in Visceral cases.
This might happen in one of two ways :
The hallucinations of Visceral Patients resemble one
another very closely and show little variety, and occur under
certain well-defined conditions : auditory when the surroundings
of the patient are quiet, visual in the dark. This being so, is it
unlikely that several patients suffering from one of the forms
of visceral disease specially favourable to the appearance of
hallucinations should occupy the same ward of a hospital ;
and that two of them should have at or about the same time
(it must be remembered that many of these hallucinations are
by no means momentary) a similar visual or auditory hallucina
tion ? They might not speak of it to each other, but they
might each independently mention it to the doctor in charge
of their case.
Or, as we have no grounds for assuming that liability to
hallucinations of visceral origin renders a patient immune
from other forms of hallucination, a possible variation of the
manner suggested above in which a parody of true collectivity
might be produced suggests itself. One patient might have
a typical hallucination arising purely from his morbid physical
condition, while a second patient in the same or an adjoining
ward might at or about the same time receive a corresponding
impression telepathically.
The first supposition has, I should say, a much better
chance of being realised than the second. But anyhow it is
satisfactory that no trace of either having been realised is to
be found in Dr. Head's lectures.
IJ.] Review of Dr. HeacPa Oouhtonian Lectures. 333
Dr. Head mentions no tendency on the part of his patients
to localise their hallucinations. Clearly a patient who had
seen apparitions in his own house and then soon after entering
the hospital saw the same apparition again in a ward would,
however much inclined before to regard his apparition as a
local haunt, abandon that interpretation of the phenomenon.
But the hallucinations experienced by patients before admis
sion were not by any means always repeated after admission.
They might have visual and auditory hallucinations at home,
and only moods of depression when in hospital ; or visual
and auditory hallucinations when in hospital and not at home,
and so on. And even if hallucinations were experienced both
before and after admission, the recurrence of the hallucination in
the hospital would not necessarily immediately follow admis
sion : and during the interval one can easily understand how
a patient might be led to imagine that his change of habita
tion had rid him of his ghost. That no such tendency to
localise their hallucinations is reported of Visceral Patients is
all the more noteworthy inasmuch as the great majority
of visual hallucinations must havo appeared to a patient in the
room in which he slept.
If these patients who had visual hallucinations at home
did not really regard their bedrooms as the scene of a local
haunt, it may have been because they connected the apparition
rather with the dark than with the room ; or, to put it in
another way, they were more familiar with the popular theory
that darkness is a necessary condition for seeing a ghost than
with the theory that ghosts attach themselves to certain
localities.
One would have imagined, too, that the non-recognition of
the figures would have helped to lead them to regard their
hallucinations as local ghosts. By which I do not, of course,
mean that because a ghost is recognised he therefore loses
ipso facto all claim to be considered as " local," but a recognised
ghost could hardly be treated as " local " unless he appeared
in an appropriate locality, e.g. in a locality connected with
his earth-career.
Or, again, there may be some intimate, indefinable and
uncommunicable instinct which makes the patient recognise
that the causes of the phenomenon lie somehow in himseF
334 J. G. Piddington. [PART
and thus prevents him from sharing the conviction of most
ghost-seers of witnessing a phenomenon external to, and in no
way dependent on, themselves.
We meet with no instances of the Development of Hallu
cinations, and while it is not surprising to find no parallel to
those rare and doubtful cases that the Census Committee entitled
" Reciprocal," it is somewhat strange that Visceral Patients
are apparently free from Tactile hallucinations: for three other
of the senses—sight, smell, and hearing — were affected.
Out of 16 84 hallucinations of various kinds collected in
the Census there were 127 purely tactile, and 56 cases where
the sense of touch was affected concomitantly with another
sense.
The Census Committee expressed the opinion that to Ex
pectancy and Suggestion were due a variety of cases of halluci
nation, and especially of the development and elaboration of
hallucinations : thus, for example, a real sound might start a
visual hallucination, a hallucinatory sound might lead up to a
visual hallucination, or, the appearance of a phantasmal figure
might excite the natural expectation that the apparition had
something to say and would accordingly induce an auditory
hallucination, and so on.
Any such effects of expectancy or suggestion are markedly
absent in Visceral hallucinations. In only one case, already
mentioned (v. XVII.), do we read of a patient hearing a sound
and seeing an apparition ; and we have besides Dr. Head's
definite statement to the effect that " in the great majority of
instances, if a patient suffers from hallucinations of more
than one kind, these hallucinations occur on entirely separate
occasions."
The same absence of any elaboration or development in the
hallucinations of Visceral Patients can be inferred from the
uniformity or at least great similarity of the visual apparitions,
and particularly from the invariable silence of the hallucina
tory figures. In fact a person suffering from visceral disease
seems an extraordinarily unsuggestible person. He can
repeatedly see a ghostly figure standing by his bedside, and
yet have not enough imagination to make the figure speak :
and cannot even make it move, except, at most, within a
limited area, which is the more remarkable inasmuch as
1J.] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 335
movement would not involve the bringing of another sense
under the spell of the hallucination, but only an extension
of the hallucination of the sense already affected. He can
hear weird sounds, which others present with him cannot
hear, and hear them sometimes night after night, and yet
these strange sounds do not provoke a visual hallucination.1
Even when a woman patient forms so definite an expectation
that she remembers to report it to Dr. Head in describing
her experience, it produces no effect whatever :
" In one case . . . the patient saw a hand and arm come
round the door of the ward that stood open flush with her
bed. This arm was extended on to the white counterpane,
and she sat up in bed expecting the body to appear round the
edge of the wide-opened door." [The italics are mine.]
I take it for granted that the body did not appear, though
this is not definitely stated, but is, I think, to be inferred with
certainty from Dr. Head's silence.
XIX. 'NEURALGIA' IN CENSUS CASES.
It will be remembered that " reflected visceral pain seems to
be the one universal concomitant of " hallucinations " in
cases of visceral disease amongst sane persons " ; and that
" the main factor " in their production " is the presence of
reflected visceral pain accompanied by superficial tenderness."
The reflected visceral pain usually took the form of " head
ache," the superficial tenderness affecting various regions of
the scalp.
Now in the Census Collection I have noted one instance
where a percipient definitely describes herself as experiencing
a hallucination during a bad attack of headache.
" One Sunday I was suffering greatly from headache, to
which I was then very subject. Mrs. M placed me on the
sofa, and said she would take charge of the children, in
the hope that perfect quiet would do me good. Shortly after,
she came to me and touched me on the shoulder, saying, as
1 A Visceral Patient may, of course, experience a visual hallucination subse
quently to his having heard hallucinatory sounds, but with the one exception
noted above there seems to be no evidence to suggest that sounds lead up
to the appearance of figures.
Y
336 J. G. Piddington. [PART
/ thought, ' Take care of the children.' Knowing she wag
in delicate health, I immediately followed her out of the room,
seeing her until I reached the hatt, when I su}1posed she
passed through one of the doors leading out of the hall.
I then went to look for the children, and to my surprise
found the mother reading to them ; she asked why 1 had
disturbed myself ; my reply was, ' You called me.' She
laughed, and said : ' You have been dreaming.' Though I
kne'w I had not slept, still I should have fancied I had
done so, if I had not followed her across the room into the
hatt. Mrs. M died in less than a fortnight from that
time." (193)
Except that the auditory part of the (tri-sensory) halluci
nation took place in the absence of disturbing noise, it would
be hard even to invent a case displaying wider divergences
from the Visceral type.
We may suppose that the percipient was likewise suffering
from " headache " during the following experience :
" [I saw] afigure of a man which was perfectly transparent,
and vhich came into the room and sat down on a chair
by my side. I was in bed and had been suffering from
severe illness, which had affected my head." (119)
Details are lacking, but the transparency of the figure, its
movement across the room, and its sitting down do not seem
to accord with the appearance or behaviour of a Visceral
apparition.
We have already referred (v. I. /) to the (coincidental) halluci
nation of a percipient who was " in very weak health—suffering
intensely with neuralgia—having come through a bad confine
ment," and who describes herself as engrossed with grief for
the loss of her baby and with the pain of her neuralgia,
and have already seen how her experience differed from the
Visceral type.
Two accounts are printed in appendices (407-13) to
the Census Report of the hallucinatory experiences, extending
over several years, of two ladies, who both connect many,
though not all, of their hallucinations with " neuralgia in
the head," or " neuralgic headaches " of a severe kind.
One of them in addition to " intense neuralgic headaches "
had " an attack of bronchitis," during which " she had fre
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lecture*. 337
quent and varied optical hallucinations." But though we
might have expected in both these cases, and especially in
the latter one, to find a resemblance to the Visceral type of
hallucination, as a matter of fact we find the precise contrary.
It may be that " headache " generally,—i.e. headache of no
matter what origin—if severe enough, is conducive to halluci
nations, while headache of visceral origin determines the
particular form which the hallucinations of the patients
assume.
Of all the cases printed in the Census Report the hallu
cination which in my opinion shows the closest resemblance,
perhaps the only one which shows a really close resemblance at
all to a visual hallucination of visceral origin, was experienced
by a percipient who at the moment of seeing the apparition
was suffering from a " very acute pain in the middle of " her
" back." The percipient, it is true, reports herself as in good
health at the time, and her experience was unique, and she
makes no mention of " headache." But she does speak of
" very acute pain in the back," and this expression, vague
and unsatisfactory though it be from a medical point of view,
puts me in mind of the following sentence in Dr. Head's
treatise :
" Headache of the reflected visceral type, particularly when
accompanied by similar pain and tenderness on the trunk, is
liable to be associated with hallucinations."
It is at least curious that this mention of very acute
pain in the middle of the back should crop up in the case
which seems to me to come nearest to the Visceral type of
hallucination.

Examination of the references which I have intercalated in
the percipient's narrative will show how close is the analogy
to a typical visual hallucination of visceral origin ; and yet
(as I have pointed out above, sub I. b) the analogy is not
complete, though close ; and this want of perfect analogy may
serve to introduce the few words which I have to say by
way of conclusion.
CONCLUSION.
I do not believe that there is a single case of hallucination
printed or referred to in the Census Report which completely
falls into line with the Visceral type. Some, no doubt, approach
it more or less closely, but none absolutely corresponds. And
if this be true of the Census cases, it must, broadly speaking,
be true of the mass of cases published by the Society. I
do not, of course, go so far as to say that the thirty odd
volumes of our Proceedings and Journal do not contain a
single example of a Visceral hallucination : but, inasmuch as
there exists no difference in character between the hallucinations
of the Census Report and those reported in our other volumes,
I do maintain that, if cases of the Visceral type have crept
in, they are too few and far between to throw any appreciable
discredit on the bulk.
This conclusion, if well founded, as I firmly believe it to
be, carries with it a splendid tribute to the labours of the
Census Committee. They had to do their work in ignorance
of the facts which Dr. Head has only recently brought to
light ; and it was only their vigilant circumspection and their
wise mistrust of all mental phenomena occurring, or suspected
of occurring, under any morbid conditions that preserved them
from a trap into which less critical investigators might easily

have fallen. And if their caution thus saved them from
admitting hallucinations due to a morbid condition of the
viscera, a strong presumption is created that it equally prevented
them from mistaking for hallucinations of the sane and healthy
hallucinations due to forms of disease other than visceral.
These considerations cannot but increase our confidence in
the conclusions which the Committee drew from their material.
How important these conclusions were is, I fear, not known
to the great majority of such of our members as have joined
the Society since the issue of the Census Report : and if this
review serve no other good purpose, this purpose, at least, I
hope it will serve—namely, to draw attention to that fine
piece of work, the Report on tlie Census of Hallucinations, and
to the deductions drawn by the Committee from it—deductions
forming, I may add, the only scientific generalisation which
so far can be said to have received the official sanction of the
Council of the Society.
While, then, we have no cause to fear a comparison between
hallucinations of visceral origin and those collected by our
Society, there is no reason why we should not take a leaf out
of Dr. Head's book and in future direct special attention to
such points, among others, as the colour and movement of
apparitions; and we should also do well to interrogate percipients
closely as to the state of their health for some months before
and after their hallucinatory experiences.

POSTCRIPT.
Since the above was written, Mr. Podmore has been kind
enough to indicate one possible line of attack which I have
not met. This attack, which Mr. Podmore must not be under
stood to endorse himself, may be stated as follows :
The chief differentiae between Psychical and Visceral hallucina
tions are just the very features which a memory allowed free
play for its inventiveness during a long interval of time between
the date of an experience and the date of record, and influenced
by a dominant idea, would produce, e.g., the completeness, the
dress, the colour, the free and natural movement, the speech
and the clear recognition of the figures.
340 J. G. Piddington. [PART
In other words, the chief differentiae are precisely those sen
sational details which lapse of time would introduce into the
narratives.
You have quoted, my critic might say, the Psychical cases
on which you have drawn to illustrate the divergences from the
Visceral type of hallucinations, without discriminating between
those of recent and those of remote date.
I would meet this criticism first on general and then on
particular grounds :
First, I would remark that most of the " sensational " features
can be paralleled from other sources. Thus colour is a typical
feature of the hallucinations of the insane ; movement of the
hallucinations of inebriates and dipsomaniacs ; articulate speech
of the hallucinations of insanity and of religious ecstasy. I see
no more reason to question the existence of these characteristics
in the one case than in the others.
Again, in three points at least, the characteristics of Visceral
hallucinations are more " sensational " than those reported by
the majority of Psychical Percipients. Thus, Visceral Patients
describe the figure as " draped " or " wrapped " in a sheet,
quite after the manner of the story-book ghost ; whereas most
Psychical ghosts are dressed, as was King Arthur in the poet's
dream, "like a modern gentleman." The histrionic tendency
would rather have represented the phantom, not in common
place modern dress, but " like a country Ghoste in his white
peackled sheete."
Visceral phantoms are nearly always seen in the dark ; Psy
chical phantoms both in daylight and in the dark. Here again
a romantic-minded percipient would have inclined to make the
ghost appear in the dead of night, or in the gloaming. Besides
this, the evidence of Psychical Percipients to the appearance
of apparitions in broad daylight seems to be much too strong
to be got over by any manner of means.
The white figures seen by Visceral Patients are described as
" corpses " : a designation used very rarely indeed by Psychical
Percipients.
Secondly, I may say that I have now gone through all the
cases used in this review, through many cases printed in the
Census Report, and also through other cases recorded elsewhere
in the Proceedings, in the Journal, and in Phantasms of the
LL] Review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures. 341
laving, and I can find no warrant for the suggestion that
vivid sensational details increase in proportion as the interval
between occurrence and record increases. I believe vivid details
to be present just as much in cases recorded within a few days,
weeks or months of their occurrence, as in cases which have
not been recorded until after a lapse of 10, 20, and 30 years
or more.

REVIEWS.
Fragments of Prose and Poetry. By FREDERIC W. H. MYERS.
Edited by his wife, EVELEEN MYERS. (Longmans, Green & Co.,
London, New York and Bombay, 1904.)
"This volume contains some fragments of prose aud poetry
written by my husband during a period of many years, and on
divers subjects ; as such it cannot but appear to a certain degree
heterogeneous and disconnected. And yet the singleness of purpose
and steadfastness of endeavour which are shown throughout will, I
think, give it a sufficient unity in the eyes of those who have
sympathised with the author's aspirations or shared his hopes."
These words, the opening of Mrs. Myers's short preface, sufficiently
sum up what a reviewer has to say. The disconnectedness of the
book is patent ; yet the parts all contribute to the whole picture
of a life of such well-knit purpose and definite aim as few men can
look back upon when their time comes to review their past as
Myers has reviewed his.
The brief and confessedly somewhat incomplete " Fragments of
Inner Life "—they can hardly be called an autobiography—with
which the volume opens form unquestionably the most interesting
aud important part of it. They are suitably followed by the
obituary notices which Myers published from time to time in our
Proceedings—the longest and most personal being naturally those
on Edmund Gurney and Henry Sidgwick. The whole form a series.
Myers may almost be said to have written his own obituary notice
in the same spirit in which he wrote those of his closest friends —
a spirit of conviction not merely that the barrier between the two
worlds is permeable and only half real, but also that in some
" world-memory " all the inner life of every soul is irrevocably
recorded, and is legible to every other individual spirit, at least
when free from the trammels of the conscious self. This incentive
to truthfulness lends a quite peculiar interest to what he has to say
U-] Reviews. 343
of his own inner life, as of a man convinced that all his readers
would one day be able to judge immediately and unanswerably of
the truth of every word here set down.
His " first marked grief," his " first startling joy " strike the key
notes of the two main passions of his life—the agony of " horror
of a death without resurrection " aroused when told that a dead
mole in the road had no soul to live again; the "awe-struck joy"
at the revelation of Virgil in the line Mitsa mihi causas memora,
quo numine laeso ; these were indeed predictive of much to follow.
His worship of Virgil was, he tells us, for a time thrust into the
background by Homer, but returned about the age of sixteen, when
he gradually learnt and wrote out from memory the whole of the
Bucolics, Georgics, and Aeneid. "I have felt ever since that of all
minds known to me it is Virgi1's of which I am the most intimate
and adoring disciple" . . . "the teaching of Plato and that of Virgil
are in the main identical. Other pathways have now led me to
something like the creed which they foresaw ; but it is still, and
more than ever, the support of my life." These sentences give us
the clue to the intimate relation of the artistic and ethical sides of
Myers's mind of which I have elsewhere spoken.
For a time indeed the purely artistic sense gained, under the
stimulus of Pindar and Sappho, the upper hand—"from the age of
sixteen to twenty-three there was no influence in my life com
parable to Hellenism in the fullest sense of the word." He drank
in the air of Hellas in full draughts during a journey in 1864, only
to find that the passion of past beauty could not satisfy his aspira
tions. " The classics . . . might aid imaginative impulse and de
tachment from sordid interests, but they had no check for pride."
The Hellenic ideal vanished with " a bitter-sweet passion of regret,"
and left him cold and lonely. From this passing stage of numb
indifference he was recalled to the Christianity of his early years
by Mrs. George Butler—that remarkable woman whose influence
was strikingly felt by many of the younger intellects of that gene
ration. It was this period which gave the world "St. Paul." The
phase is a striking and interesting one—more surprising perhaps
in the sixties than it appears to-day. It gave Myers complete
satisfaction for a time, so far as his emotional and moral needs
were concerned ; but from the intellect came a gradual and painful
disillusionment, leading to a distressing phase of agnosticism, satis
fying nothing, and unmanning even the desire to help his fellow-
men. At this time the guiding influences were first those of
344 Dr. Walter Leaf. [PART
George Eliot and later of Henry Sidgwick ; in company with
Sidgwick he began about 1871 to turn his attention towards "spiri
tualism" as a possible key to the eternal problem. It was in 1873
that, in the stances, I believe, of a professional medium, he first
met phenomena which profoundly impressed him. He barely men
tions them here, and, indeed, was always very reticent about those
that most struck him, feeling strongly the gap between personal
belief and scientific evidence. But it was this period which set
him definitely on the quest—first pursued through wearisome pro
fessional stances, leading almost always to disappointment and
detection ; afterwards in the clearer air of the experiments of
the newly formed S. P. R. ; but invariably carried on with in
domitable perseverance and dauntless hope. From this point the
development of Myers's thought is open to all men to read—it is
all there in his papers in our publications and in Human Personality.
He sums up his final creed in three statements ; firstly, the fact of
man's survival of death ; secondly, the registration in the universe
of every past scene and thought; thirdly, a progressive moral
evolution, no longer truncated by physical catastrophes, but moving
continuously towards an infinitely distant goal. In this creed he
found at last complete satisfaction, though no relaxation of en
deavour.
The story is profoundly interesting, as must be the story of a
sensitive and vigorous intellect which has thus proved and rejected
in turn the chief faiths of his time, to find refuge in a new belief
of which he was largely the creator. The record is not of course
in any sense complete. In the first place it is not a contempo
raneous record—the earlier stages are described as they appeared
to a mind largely developed and changed. The few letters which
are inserted in the narrative serve only in a very slight measure
to fill the gap; and no man was more conscious than Myers of the
immense importance of the contemporaneous record. And of course
they cover only a portion of the inner life. Not even a Rousseau
—much less so impressionable a man as Myers—could publish the
whole of the circumstances which moulded his life ; and even the
poems, which form a large part of the volume, hint at emotions and
experiences that find no place in the autobiography. The fine
sonnet on p. 13fi, for instance, is an expression of what was one of
the keen disappointments of his later life, that he received no
Ojpernormal message from dying friends, however closely bound to
But one cannot entirely suppress a suspicion that Myers

himself, had he published anything, would have published more—
that the book is not so complete and outspoken a revelation as
be wished it to be. If that is so, then justice has not been done
him. Mrs. Myers half promises the future publication of a collec
tion of her husband's letters, at present too personal in character
to see the light. These will doubtless give a fuller picture of him
than any but his closest friends can now possess ; in the meantime
we must be grateful for what we are allowed to know. The
lesson of the life should be inspiring even to those who must disagree
with Myers's final creed ; it is a story of fmal success after many
failures, of peace not bought, as too often, by self-surrender in
exchange for the comfort of spiritual guidance and parental dogma,
Christian or Buddhist, but wrested by strenuous struggles of will
and thought from the riddle of life. Emotion and intellect worked
in alliance instead of civil war. To many men the final victory
means the death of one or other; with Myers they both had con
quered when peace was proclaimed.

Multiple Perfonality; An experimental investigation into the Nature
«/ Human Individuality. By BORIS SIDIS, M.A., Ph.D. and SIMON
P. GOODHART, Ph.B., M.D. (London: Sidney Appleton, 1905).
About one third of this book is occupied with the description
of the remarkable case of Mr. Hanna, a case of loss of memory
more complete than has ever before been recorded. The case is
of the greatest possible interest to the psychologist and is important
also from the point of view of the " psychical researcher." Mr.
Hanna, a well-educated, intelligent, and healthy young clergyman fell
head foremost to the ground from his carriage and was carried
by his brother in an almost lifeless condition to a neighbouring
house. He lay some two hours showing no sign of life other than
feeble movements of respiration, and then " began to move, opened
his eyes, looked around, moved his arm, then sat upright in bed,
arose, reached toward one of the physicians and attempted to
push him. Thinking the patient iu a state of delirium, and fearing
an attack, they seized him and attempted to push him back upon
the bed. Mr. Hanna resisted vigorously and a struggle ensued."
The efforts of four men were needed to overcome the struggles of
the patient, who then lay still and looked curiously about him.
It then appeared not only that " he had lost the faculty of speech,
. . . but he had also lost all power of recognition of objects, words
346 W. McDougall. [PART
and persons. He was in a state of complete mental blindness.
He was as a newly born infant opening his eyes for the first time
upon the world. . . . The world was to Mr. Hanna but a chaos
of sensations, not as yet elaborated and differentiated into a system
of distinct percepts and concepts ; neither objects, nor space, nor
time, in the form as they are presented to the developed adult
mind, existed for him. So totally obliterated from memory were
the experiences of his past life that even the requirements of the
simplest mental processes by which the appreciation of distance,
form, size, magnitude is acquired, were effaced from his mind.
Movement alone attracted his attention. He did not know the
cause and meaning of movement, but a moving object fastened his
involuntary attention and seemed to fascinate his gaze. He made
as yet no discrimination between his own movements and those of
other objects, and was as much interested in the movement of his
own limbs as in that of external things. He did not know how
to control his voluntary muscles, nor had he any idea of the possi
bility of such a control. From the more or less involuntary chance
movements made by his arms and legs, he learned the possibility
of controlling his limbs. . . . He could not co-ordinate the move
ments of his legs, hence he could not walk. Unable to discriminate
between his own activity and that of others, the world was not
yet differentiated into the objective and subjective, and he had no
idea of ego activity. . . . He did not have the least conception
of the flow of time,—seconds, minutes, hours were alike to him. . . .
The sensation of hunger, though present in all its intensity, as we
afterwards learned, could not be interpreted by him, and he certainly
did not know how to appease it. When food was offered him, he
did not understand the purpose of it ; nor when it was placed within
his mouth did he know how to masticate and swallow it. In order
to feed him, fluid nourishment had to be placed far back into the
pharynx, thus provoking reflex swallowing movements."
These passages contain the more important statements as .to the
condition of the patient on recovering consciousness. They illus
trate the chief defect of the report of this most interesting
case, namely, the confounding of the facts observed at the time
by those surrounding the patient with the statements of the
patient at a later time and with the inferences and theoretical
views of the writers of the account, who, unfortunately, did not see
the patient until some weeks after the accident. It is much to be
regretted that in a case of so much importance to psychology, the state

menu based upon these three sources were not rigidly separated in
the report. Nevertheless it seems probable that they give a fair
picture of the mental state of Mr. Hanna when he first regained
consciousness after the accident.
The further course of the case is no less interesting. Mr. Hanna
began rapidly to learn all that a child learns and to learn it in much
the same way that a child learns, the great difference being that
he learned with extreme rapidity. He rapidly acquired control of
movements and learnt to walk, to grasp objects and to distinguish
between those near at hand and those at a distance, Although
at first he had no visual perception of distance, all seen objects
appearing close to his eyes. He displayed a great interest in the
speech of others and acquired the use of language rapidly, learning
first the names of common objects, later the use of adjectives and still
later the use of pronouns and of relational and abstract terms. The
most remarkable facts in his relearning of speech were that he could
at once repeat a word or sentence heard though without understanding
the meaning, and that a word " once heard seemed indelibly impressed
upon his mind, and he never again forgot it." This rapidity of
learning was displayed not only in regard to capacities previously
acquired and lost at the time of the accident, but also in acquiring
new capacities : e.g. " Having had no familiarity with the banjo
before the accident, he acquired the skill of playing it in but a few
hours . . . with the facility of an experienced player." No indi
cation of any memory of his former experiences could be discovered
until the fifth week after the accident, when Mr. Hanna in response
to questions, described dreams of two kinds, some vague, others
vivid and clear. These vivid dream images had little meaning
for him, yet his description of them enabled his friends to conclude
that they were reproductions of sense-impressions of his former
life : e.g. he described a railroad and beside it a square house upon
which were the letters N-E-W-B-O-S-T-O-N-J-U-N-C, which
he spelled out without understanding their meaning. The next
evidence of returning memory was obtained by reading to the
patient a part of a Hebrew passage previously familiar to him.
He then repeated the whole passage, without, however, any sense
of familiarity with it and without understanding it. Attempts to
hypnotise Mr. Hanna were unsuccessful, and after six weeks spent
in rapid learning he was removed from his quiet home to New
York in order that varied and vivid impressions might stimulate
his mind.
348 W. McDougall. [PART
The first evening was spent in lively company in a large restaurant.
Early the following morning he awoke and to the joy of his brother,
who shared his room, he displayed a normal capacity of recalling
the events of his former life up to the moment of the accident,
while all his experiences since that moment seemed to be wiped
out from his mind. He did not recognise his physician, his room
was completely strange to him, and he was with difficulty brought
to admit the lapse of six weeks since the accident, six weeks which
for his memory were lacking. He remained awake in this state
some three quarters of an hour, then became sleepy, slept for some
hours and wakened again as he was on the previous evening, i.e.
with the command of that knowledge only which he had acquired
since the accident. For several days he persisted in this state in
spite of efforts to stimulate him to recognise scenes and objects
formerly familiar to him. On the fourth evening he was given a
dose of cannabis itidica which produced some exaltation, followed by
sleep. In the morning he awoke in his " primary " state again,
remembering only his life before the accident and the events of the
preceding short period of recovery. He felt weak and sluggish,
nevertheless he showed himself in conversation to have full control
of his stores of learning acquired at school and university. After
a short time he became drowsy, and in spite of all efforts his eyes
closed and he fell into a state of profound lethargy and physical
prostration from which he could not be roused. This state (named
by the authors the hypnoleptic state) continued for about one
minute, when the patient suddenly opened his eyes and was found
to be in his " secondary " state. In this state he remained until
awaking on the following morning, when he was again in the
primary state. And these two states then alternated several times,
the primary always passing into the secondary through a brief
" hypnoleptic " period, the secondary into the primary through natural
sleep. Mr. Hanna was urged in every way to resist the oncoming of
the drowsiness that heralded the passage into the secondary state,
until one day he, while in his primary state, "fell into a condition
of what appeared to be deep abstraction." He complained of a
severe headache and refused to speak or allow himself to be moved;
after about half-an-hour questions elicited responses of " Yes " and
"No," which showed that he knew directly of both primary and
secondary states. He remained in this dazed state about two
hours and then gradually recovered. He stated that while lying
on the couch he was conscious of all that had been said and done
LL] Reviews. 349
in the room, but that he was "engaged in one of the most intense
struggles he had ever experienced." The two personalities, that of
the primary and that of the secondary state, " arose simultaneously
and confronted each other." ... "It was a struggle for life between
two individualities formed in a single mind, each one endeavour
ing to gain ascendancy and to suppress, to crush the other ; and
still neither could be suppressed, because each was part ami parcel
of the other." " I was willing to take either. The struggle was
not so much to choose one as to forget the other. I was trying
to find which I might most easily forget. It seemed impossible to
forget one ; both tried to persist in consciousness. It seemed as
if each memory was stronger than my will, and still I had to
determine which to drive away." "Finally," he says, "I decided
to take both lives as mine, because of the fear and anxiety that
the struggle would be repeated again and again. ... I have now
retained both memories ; I am sure both are mine. They are
separate, and I cannot yet fit the two well together. . . . The
secondary state is stronger and brighter, but not more stable."
From this time onwards Mr. Hanna retained the power of recall
ing the experiences of both states and may be said to have recovered
completely from the effects of his accident.
This remarkable case differs from all others of similar character
hitherto reported in several respects, notably in the completeness
of the loss of all acquired facilities and knowledge, and in the
eventual recovery by the fusion of the two personalities or memory-
continua.
The authors interpret the case as one of complete "psycho-
physiological dissociation, the dissociation and disaggregations of
systems of central neural elements with their concomitant psychic
systems or moments consciousness " The authors claim that this
principle fully accounts for the facts, but to me, at least, much
remains obscure and hard to explain, perhaps because I fail to seize
the leading ideas of the authors and cannot understand what is
meant by " moments consciousness," a phrase which plays a great
part in all the speculative and explanatory discussions of this book.
The reported facts of observation (if we accept them without
icserve) seem to' justify the authors' statement that although he
(Mr. Hanna) was mentally reduced to a state of infancy, his
intelligence remained intact. In attempting to understand the con
dition the most important statements to bear in mind are that
"although Mr. Hanna was mentally blind and had lost all know
350 W. McDougall. [PART
ledge formerly possessed, both in relation to the external and
internal world ; although he was mentally reduced to a state of
infancy, strange to say, his intelligence remained intact. His
curiosity for acquiring knowledge was keener than ever, and the
use made of his acquisitions was truly astonishing. His faculty
of judgment, his power of reasoning were as sound and vigorous
as ever. The content of knowledge seemed to have been lost, but
the form of knowledge remained as active as before the accident
and was perhaps even more precise and definite."
We may try to account for this condition in terms of changes in
the nervous system, accepting some such view of the nature and
evolution of mind as is given by Herbert Spencer, and remembering
that the growth of the individual mind is, according to this view,
due to two factors,—(1) the spontaneous development of nervous
structure representing the accumulated experience of countless
ancestors, a development that continues throughout the period of
growth ; (2) the retention of the effects of individual experience
in the form of associations between brain-elements and systems of
such elements brought about in the course of conscious reactions
to the impressions received from the external world. If with Spencer
we assume that in the adult the nervous structures of the former
kind determine the forms of perception and inference, of mental
activity in general, while the latter determine the content of our
ideas and in part of our perceptions, and if we assume, as we may
do without improbability, that the latter kind of structure is less
stably organised than the former, then we may suppose that the
concussion of Mr. Hanna's brain brought about some degree of
dissolution of all associations between brain-elements acquired during
the course of his individual experience, leaving intact all those
inherited by him and representing ancestral experience. In this
way we may seek to understand the fact that Mr. Hanna's mind
seemed emptied of content while retaining its faculties or forms of
activity unimpaired ; that as regards mental content he became
as a newborn babe, while as regards the forms of activity and his
inherited dispositions and aptitudes, his instincts and reflex actions,
he suffered no appreciable loss, and remained an adult of well-
developed mental powers. But a difficulty meets us when we pursue
further this line of explanation. If we could assume that all acquired
associations were simply and completely dissolved, we could then
explain the great facility with which he acquired and retained
powers of movement and impressions and ideas of all kinds, a
LI.] Reviews. 351
facility far exceeding that of a young child, as due to the fact that
his brain contained an immense number of fully formed nerve-
elements ready to enter into associations, whereas in the brain of
the young child these elements are for the most part imperfectly
organised, and only gradually become capable of playing their part
as members of the systematically organised groups of elements.
But the fact that Mr. Hanna eventually recovered his memory of
his former life shows that the acquired associations were not destroyed,
but suffered only a temporary functional depression ; hence the
authors assume that the extreme rapidity of the reacquisition of the
power of co-ordinated movement, of the use of language, and of
ideas in general was due to the fact that associations had not to be
formed de novo, but only to be restored by use to a condition of
functional effectiveness. But the fact that Mr. Hanna acquired
with equally astonishing rapidity skill in the playing of musical
instruments with which he had before the accident no familiarity
shows that in this case the acquisition was really a new acquisition,
—not merely a reawakening of old facilities—and renders it at
least possible that the same is true of all his acquisitions in the
six weeks following the accident. This view seems to be borne out,.
too, by the fact of the formation after the accident of a completely
independent memory-continuum. If the acquisition of facilities and
ideas after the accident consisted merely in a restoration of structures
previously formed to a condition of efficiency we should expect ta
have observed a gradual reawakening of the lost memories, a
gradually improving recognition of previously familiar persons and
objects. But nothing of this sort was observed. The lost memory-
continuum was recovered suddenly and completely and the new-formed
memory-continuum persisted contemporaneously with it ; and the two,.
being discontinuous, and yet both having that character of warmth
and intimacy which belongs to the reproductions of past experiences,
seemed to constitute two past selves each claiming continuity with
the present self.
If we could accept the view that the two cerebral hemi
spheres function in large part independently, and that one
may be dormant and undeveloped, while the other becomes the
store-house of acquisitions, then we might suppose that after the
accident the former had been called into activity and had become
educated and organised. That this may occur in a very partial
degree is proved by certain cases of recovery of speech depending
upon organisation of a speech centre in the right hemisphere after

352 If. McDmigatt. [PART
•complete destruction of Broca's area in the left hemisphere. Bat
that the one hemisphere may normally be so latent as to afford a
satisfactory explanation of this remarkable case is improbable.
Perhaps we should rather look to the evidence, to which some
-authorities attach great importance, indicating that in most of us
a large proportion of the cells of the cortex of both hemispheres
remain throughout life outside the functioning systems and practi
cally unused.
The case may be interpreted in another than the purely physio
logical manner. It may be held that in the remarkable separation in
this case of the form and the content of mental process we have evidence
that, while the content depends upon the systems of associated
neural elements built up in the course of individual experience,
and is therefore liable to be temporarily or permanently abolished
by a physical shock to the brain substance, the forms of mental
activity are not dependent upon nervous organisation but purely
upon the psychical constitution of the individual, a constitution
which being immaterial is not to be destroyed by an injury to the
brain. We should then have to regard the difference between
a new-born child and Mr. Hanna after the accident as due to the
fact that the former has an insufficent mass of fully developed
neural elements to permit of the rapid organisation of complex
systems conditioning a mental content rapidly growing in volume
and complexity and giving scope and occasion for the higher forms
of mental activity, while in the brain of the latter such a supply
of neural elements was present, only awaiting the incidence of sense-
impressions to become organised de novo as the material conditions
of the new memory-continuum under the guidance of the unimpaired
psychical constitution. And in support of this interpretation one
might put to those who would adopt the former purely physiological
line of explanation, the question : " What then is that something
which watched and suffered and strove to decide the issue in that
strange contest for predominance between the two memory-continua
and which ultimately adopted them both as its own past experience '
This case of alternating personality is especially interesting from
the point of view of psychical research in that its issue in recovery
with fusion of the two personalities puts out of court the explanation
by the hypothesis of possession or " spirit-control," which has been
suggested in regard to some other cases, notably in that of Lurancy
Vannum (see Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 65 and pp. 360-68), where
•explanation was generally accepted by the persons who wit

nessed the phenomena at the time. The evidence adduced for it
would indeed seem strong, but for the fact that little, if any, pre
caution appears to have been taken to guard against the patient's
acquiring by normal means knowledge of incidents in the life of
the girl whom she was supposed to be personating. The case is
nevertheless a remarkable one, and those who regard it as one of
'•spirit-control" may naturally be inclined to extend the explanation
to all instances of alternating personality. So long as no instance of
fusion of the two or more personalities was known this remained
possible. In this case the explanation is clearly not applicable, and
therefore those who adopt it for cases of the Lurancy Vennum type
must recognise that not all cases can be brought into this class;
they must recognise two distinct and very different kinds of alter
nating personality.
Of great interest to members of the S.P.R. is the statement that
Mr. Hanna soon after the accident exhibited powers of clairvoyance,
in that " he was able to find objects hidden from him, and was
uniformly correct in guessing in which hand a small coin was held,"
and that "In like manner the straps with which he was bound
after the accident he invariably located, in spite of the fact that
his family made every effort to conceal them, since their presence
agitated him." It is significant of the attitude of men of science
towards the work of the S.P.R. that these statements are relegated
to a footnote and that the authors do not seem to have considered
them worthy of investigation, though accepting them as evidence of
the sensitiveness of the secondary personality.
The rest of the book is occupied with theoretical discussions of a
somewhat confusing character, illustrated by the citation of other
morbid cases, some of which are of great interest. The authors claim
that their successful treatment of the case of Mr. Hanna constitutes
a verification of their theoretical interpretation. But though they
certainly may claim credit for skilful treatment, it must remain
doubtful, as so often in medical practice, to what extent the treatment
played an essential part in bringing about the recovery.

RICHARD HODGSON: IN MEMORIAM.
L
BY MRS. HENRY SIDGWICK.
IK the death of Richard Hodgson, which occurred quite
suddenly and unexpectedly on the 20th of December, 1905,
the Society for Psychical Research has lost a member who
must always occupy a prominent place in its annals. He not
only took an important share in its work, but almost from
its foundation he determined to give his life to the questions
with which it is concerned, regarding this investigation as
one of the most important objects to which the human mind
and human energy could be devoted, and therefore one to
which worldly ambitions should be cheerfully sacrificed.
Richard Hodgson was born at Melbourne in Australia in
1855, was educated in the public schools there, and after
wards entered the Melbourne University where he took the
degrees of M.A. and LL.D. His intention had been to
devote himself to the Law, but he was diverted from this
apparently by the study of philosophy and the interest it
inspired, and it was probably with a view to pursuing his
philosophical studies that he came to England. He entered
the University of Cambridge as a student at St. John's
College in 1878, and read for the Moral Sciences Tripos, in
which he took honours in 1881. It was characteristic of
him that, having thus qualified for a degree, his friends had
some difficulty in persuading him to take it, because the
ceremony involved kneeling to the Vice-Chancellor, and he
did not wish to bend the knee to any man. After com
pleting his Cambridge course he studied for a time at the
University of Jena in Germany, and on returning to England
LII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 357
took part in University extension lecturing in the North of
England. As a student of the Moral Sciences he was naturally
brought into contact at Cambridge with Henry Sidgwick, who
besides lecturing made a practice of going over his pupils'
work with them individually, and thus saw a good deal of
them. The friendship and regard for each other first formed
between the two men in the relation of teacher and pupil
was a lasting one.
The philosophic writer in whom Mr. Hodgson felt most
interest, and with whom he was most disposed to agree at
this time, was Herbert Spencer, on whom he both wrote and
later lectured at Cambridge. But he was not consciously a
follower of Herbert Spencer or of any other philosopher.
Indeed he was always a man of great independence of mind,
with an almost inconvenient dislike of following others. It
was, 1 suppose, to give relief to this feeling, and as a symbol
of his desire to take an independent line, that he adopted
while at Cambridge an evening dress suit of brown cloth
instead of the ordinary black one. This becoming but eccen
tric costume he discontinued after some years, realising,
doubtless, that it is not worth while expending energy in
diverging from custom in unimportant details.
Mr. Hodgson's interest in the objects investigated by our
Society had already begun in Australia, and at Cambridge
he took an active part in an undergraduate society formed
to investigate some of them. This society had but a brief
existence, and did not obtain any satisfactory results ; but i
doubtless helped to prepare him for what was ultimately to
be his life's work, and when the Society for Psychical
Research was founded in 1882 he became one of its earliest
members.1
How early he took an active part in its work and its
councils I am not quite sure, but in 1884, when a keen
interest was being taken in England in Madame Blavatsky
and her Theosophical Society, Mr. Hodgson was co-opted as a
member of the Committee appointed to investigate the marvels
alleged to occur in connection with Theosophy. These phe
nomena were in many respects analogous to those said to occur
at spiritualistic stances—e.g. the transportation even through
1 His name appears in the first published list of members.
358 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PART
solid matter of ponderable objects. Mr. Hodgson was sent
out by. the Committee in November, 1884, to investigate the
phenomena in India, where they chiefly occurred. Before he
started considerable doubt had been thrown by revelations
of confederates and otherwise on the genuineness of Madame
Blavatsky's occult powers and on the existence of the Tibetan
Mahatmas with whom she professed to work. But this did
not detract from the merit of Mr. Hodgson's work, which
included, of course, among other things, an investigation into
the trustworthiness of the assertions made by the confederates,
and which was carried out with much care and acumen, and
with a praiseworthy thoroughness patent to all who read
his report.1 The result was that finally he had no doubt
whatever that the phenomena connected with the Theosophical
Society were part of a huge fraudulent system worked by
Madame Blavatsky with the assistance of confederates, and
that not a single genuine phenomenon could be found among
them all. And this, after receiving Mr. Hodgson's report, was
the conclusion also of the Committee, though they expressed
it in more guarded language.
During this visit to India Mr. Hodgson greatly developed,
if he did not actually acquire, the interest in all kinds of
conjuring performances and ingenious tricks and puzzles which
became so characteristic of him, and which on many occasions
served him well in enabling him to unmask trickery in con
nection with phenomena alleged to be occult. I have still
a number of puzzles which he gave me at this time, and
remember the pleasure he took in making me unravel them.
In the course, too, of his investigation into the Theosophical
phenomena he made himself an expert in handwriting,
applying his skill especially in connection with the so-called
Koot Hoomi letters, said to have been written and
mysteriously conveyed to the recipients by a Mahatma residing
in Tibet, but really for the most part written by Madame
Blavatsky herself in a disguised hand. Mr. Hodgson was
undoubtedly a man of great power of observation and acute
inference, which he combined with an unusually genial and
enthusiastic nature. I was a good deal associated with him
in the work of investigation at this time, and well remember
1 Proceeding!, S.P.R., Vol. III., pp. 207-380.
LII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 359
what an inspiriting fellow-worker these qualities, together with
his vigour and energy and keen interest, made him.
The Blavatsky investigation proved purely destructive, and
Mr. Hodgson's powers were often afterwards applied to
necessary but destructive work in exposing trickery.1 But it is
not for his destructive work that the Society owes him most
gratitude. The next important piece of work he undertook—
namely, an experimental investigation in conjunction with Mr.
S. J. Davey into the possibilities of mal-observation and lapse of
memory in connection with phenomena such as those which
occur at stances—though from one point of view destructive
is from another constructive, establishing psychological data
of great importance for the estimation of evidence in
psychical research. This investigation, of which the results
are contained in two papers in our Proceedings? is probably
Mr. Hodgson's most original work. It is certainly a contribution of
lasting value to the work of the Society, and one which cannot
be ignored by any one seriously desiring to estimate evidence
for phenomena not apparently in accordance with the known
laws of nature, and in regard to which there is any possibility
of conscious or unconscious deception. It was, however, after
he went to America that, through the work he did with Mrs.
Piper, Mr. Hodgson first added to the positive evidence for
the reality of supernormal phenomena.
In 1887 he was invited to go to the United States of
America as secretary to the American Society for Psychical
Research, and with reluctance made up his mind to leave
England and his friends here for the purpose. He held the
office till in 1890 that Society converted itself into a Branch
of the English Society, and then retained a similar position
as secretary of the Branch. He soon made friends in
America, and transferring his affections to that country came
to regard it as his home. Only once did he return to
England except for brief visits. In 1897 an effort was
1 E.g. in the case of the greater part of Eusapia Paladino's work at Cambridge
in 1895.

made to attach him more completely to the central work
of the Society. He resided in England for a year from the
autumn of 1897, and served as a member of the Council
and Editor of the Proceedings and Journal. But the attraction
of America and of the work in America was too strong.
He returned there in 1898, intending that it should be
for a time only ; but he could not tear himself away, and
when this became evident to him in 1S99 he resigned the
post of Editor. Meanwhile his constant interchange of views
with Mr. Myers resulted in a close approximation on theoretical
points between them, probably through modifications and
developments on both sides ; and after Mr. Myers died leaving
his book Human Personality only partly in print, it fell to
Mr. Hodgson, in co-operation with Miss Johnson, to complete
and edit what was unfinished.
When Mr. Hodgson went to America in 1887 he found
members of the Society there, especially Professor William
James, already interested in the trance phenomena of Mrs.
Piper. He immediately began work with her, and was soon
so much interested that the investigation became hence
forward his most absorbing work, and was only intermitted
during short intervals till his death. It was in consequence
of his and Professor James's reports that Mrs. Piper was
invited to England in 1889, but though the reports of the
English sittings were ready for publication first,1 it will be
remembered that Mr. Hodgson's report, published in 1892
(Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., pp. 1-167), contains records
of earlier work. It is, of course, only a small proportion of
the Piper evidence which seems to require the hypothesis of
communication with the dead ; for even when the trance-
personality exhibits knowledge which it is difficult to suppose
otherwise than supernormally acquired, thought-transference
between living persons will generally suffice to account for
it. It was therefore natural that Mr. Hodgson should only
gradually arrive at the momentous conclusion (expressed in
his second report on Mrs. Piper, published in 18982), that

papers on Mrs. Piper, but those of Professor W. Romaine Newbold (Proceedings
S.P.R., Vol. XIV., pp. 6-49) and of Professor Hyslop (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.
XVI.) are based on evidence obtained largely with Mr. Hodgson's assistance.
LII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 361
the chief " communicators " through Mrs. Piper were " veritably
the personalities that they claim to be, that they have
survived the change we call death, and that they have
directly communicated with us whom we call living through
Mrs. Piper's entranced organism." 1 Whether he would have
admitted any modification to this statement in later years
I do not know, but there is no doubt that to the end he
retained his belief in the broad fact that we have empirical
evidence of the survival of the dead and of their power
under certain circumstances to communicate with the living,
and that he held this belief with a strength of conviction
which probably nothing could have shaken. Some of the
evidence on which the belief was founded is set forth in
the above-mentioned report, but, as must almost always happen
in such cases, the evidence that could be published is not the
whole of what served to convince Mr. Hodgson and others who
knew the deceased persons supposed to be- communicating, nor
indeed is the whole of it capable of being put down in writing.
It is, of course, of great importance that any conclusions
that may be drawn from Mrs. Piper's trance utterances should
be supported by investigation into the automatic speaking and
writing of other sensitives, and it is to be regretted that
Mr. Hodgson did not give some of the time devoted in later
years to Mrs. Piper to looking into other cases. We must
regret, moreover, that he has left us without bringing into
order the mass of still unpublished material he had collected in
sittings with Mrs. Piper in these later years—material of which
the value 'is at present unknown. But whatever this material
when examined may reveal, and whether it can be made use
of publicly or not, it is certain that the labours of Mr. Hodgson
have given to the world an important record of developments
of trance speaking and writing observed with Mrs. Piper
through a long series of years. It is certain, too, that this
record includes a considerable amount of evidence for the
acquisition of knowledge in some supernormal manner by the
trance personality ; and, more important still, it undoubtedly
contains evidence which cannot be ignored, and which Mr.
Hodgson himself regarded as conclusive, for the possibility of
communication between the dead and the living.

' Hodgson, to woss the bar it a delightful experience."
(R.ff. "/ shall meet it -with roses and daffodils for love and spring-time.")
" That sounds natural."
(Extract from record of sitting with Mrs. Piper, held on January 28th, 1902.)
RICHARD HODGSON'S life fell roughly into three acts, the scene
of each laid in a different continent, with an interlude in a
fourth.
The first 23 years of his life were passed in Australia, the
next 9 in England, and the last 18 in America. For his
own happiness it was probably well that the middle period
was the briefest of the three, for it was only in the freer,
breezier social climates of his first and last homes, and especially
in " the large and charitable air " of America, that the real
nature of the man blossomed forth. In the conventional and
reserved atmosphere of England he must often have been ill
at ease, and was certainly not at his best, and he felt
himself, I believe, " cabin'd, cribb'd, confined."
Partly for this reason, and partly by reason of his long
absence, some engaging sides of his character were little, if
at all, known to us in England. I have recently been going
through a mass of his papers, and have been brought into
contact with his Boston friends. What I have learnt from
these two sources has thrown on Hodgson's character a light
new to me, and, as it may be new to others too, I have
attempted to set down here the impressions I have gathered.
Mrs. Sidgwick is dealing with Hodgson's work as ;\
Dljrchical researcher. Here I wish to speak only of Richard
llmlgson as a man.
Among the names of those who have devoted themselves
l.ii the study of psychical phenomena his must remain a
one. Interest, therefore, in the purely personal
LII.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 363
side of his life is natural enough ; but apart from this it is
only right that we should learn all we can of the psychology of
the psychologist; for, if, confining our attention to the mere
record of his investigations, we ignore the personal equation
of the investigator, we shall have neglected one of the vital
elements of the problem.
What manner of man, then, was Richard Hodgson ?
First and foremost he loved life ; and he played the game
of life whole-heartedly and joyously. He was a healthy animal,
with an undegenerate appetite for food and exercise and sport
and open air ; an appetite which kept its keen edge to the
last because he never blunted it by over-indulgence or by
unwholesome fare. He died playing a game, and in the circum
stance of his death there was nothing inappropriate,—I had
almost said that it was characteristic.
Some of you may have pictured him to yourselves as the
severe recluse absorbed in his metaphysical studies, careless,
if not contemptuous, of all that did not belong to the in
tellectual or to the spiritual side of life. He was nothing of
the sort. He did not
" desire in any way
To vary from the kindly race of men."
He was the most sociable of beings. In Dr. Johnson's phrase,
he was a " clubbable man," and he was fortunate enough to
find at Boston that rare thing, a clubbable club, where he
gratified this social instinct to the full. He had rooms in
which he slept and breakfasted and worked, but his real home
was the Tavern Club : which is not so much a club as a
Happy Family. He was one of the club's most constant
habitues, and, perhaps, its most popular member. If there
was any fun going on—and there is no lack of it at the Tavern
—Hodgson was sure to be, if not the centre, at least in the
centre of it. I spoke of his popularity, but a more intimate
word is needed. To the affection in which he was held by
his fellow Taverners more than one of them spoke in my
hearing, in few words indeed, as befits us Anglo-Saxons, but
in a tone of shy reserve eloquent of sincere emotion.
At the Club he could throw psychical research to the winds
with a clear conscience, for by most of his club friends his
364 J. G. Piddington. [PART
devotion to it was looked upon as an amiable weakness, a
curious streak of crankiness in an otherwise eminently sane
character, and as a fit subject for pleasantry and chaff; chaff
which Hodgson took with unruffled good humour. And it
was well in every way that he was thus almost daily led to
avoid for a few hours all reference, or all but joking reference,
to a subject from which regular relaxation is essential if sense
of proportion and sanity of judgment are to be retained.
Yet to a congenial audience or to enquirers who had or
professed a serious desire to learn Hodgson would expatiate
on his own subject with enthusiasm ; and a singularly retentive
memory enabled him to illustrate it with a wealth of apposite
and accurate detail.
Society, in the conventional sense, had no attractions for
him ; but each summer found him a delighted and a welcome
guest among a circle of intimate friends in the Adirondack
Mountains or at Bar Harbor. At Putnam's Camp in the
Adirondacks especially he could indulge to the full his pleasure
in the companionship of children. He loved children—big
and little—and they him. With them he became a boy again.
He led their games, and the first to tire was never Hodgson.
When he died the first thought of more than one parent was
not of their own loss, but " What will our children do without
him ? "
Puzzles of all and every kind, and anything akin thereto—
conjuring-tricks, conundrums, catches, riddles, anagrams, acrostics,
cryptograms, cyphers—exercised a veritable fascination over him.
All of this sort was fish that came to his net.
For poetry he had the same omnivorous appetite, as his
bookshelves testified. Though undoubtedly possessed of true
taste, he was a very glutton for anything that had the least
pretence to rime or metre. He would not only read but buy
the output of the feeblest of minor poets, rather, I fancy, than
run the risk of missing one inspired thought or phrase that
might lie lurking among a ream of rubbish.
Nor was poetry his only intellectual recreation. He had
been, if not a profound, at least no superficial student of
philosophy. He followed with interest the general progress
of science, and astronomy had a particular attraction for him.
Less orthodox—though, as the outside world might think,
L.H.] Rickard Hodgson: in Memoriam. 365
more in keeping with his chief pursuit—were a mild sympathy
with the anti-vaccinationists and an interest in the Baconian
controversy ; though the latter, I suspect, was traceable rather
to his leaning towards everything partaking of the nature of
a puzzle than to any serious doubts about the authorship of
Shakespeare's works.
As I worked my way through his papers, evidence for this
penchant for puzzles cropped up at every turn ; and I cannot
doubt that it had much to do with determining his career.
It must in any case have been one of the chief deciding factors.
Another was, I believe, an innate and abiding religious sense.
In early life an earnest and active Nonconformist, he, while
still a young man, cut himself adrift from his first religious
moorings as soon as he realised that he could no longer
conscientiously and unreservedly accept all the tenets of his
Church. Later on he became a disciple of Herbert Spencer.
Bub his soul was always athirst for the water brooks, and
it must have been with deep satisfaction and relief that
he ultimately found in the conclusions which he drew from the
investigations of this Society and chiefly from those he had
himself conducted in America an intellectual sanction for his
aspirations.
Genial and kindly though his nature was, it was not without
its roughnesses. In controversy he was apt to deal hard
blows in sledge-hammer style, and his own joy in combat
blinded him to the fact that his opponent was not necessarily
as insensitive to castigation as himself.
Once his mind was made up he became constitutionally
unable to appreciate, another point of view, and his strong
convictions were accompanied by an almost righteous indig
nation at the perversity of the other fellow. In other words,
though full of fun he was lacking in a sense of humour. He
was in deadly earnest in whatever he took up. This dis
position made him in his later years impatient of compromise
or control. He was one of those men who, averse from and
unsuited for co-operation, work best alone.
The detective faculty, which served him so well in the
solution of puzzles and usually in his psychical work, would
occasionally mislead him in the ordinary relations of life
into fits of suspiciousness, as comic in their intensity as in
366 J. G. Piddington. [PAHT
their object. On those on whom his suspicious fell he vented
his displeasure in no measured terms ; and, however groundless
his accusations might be shown to be, it was rarely, if ever,
that he would admit himself mistaken. He could pardon,
frankly and readily enough, as a rule, though sometimes
grudgingly and tardily ; but he found it hard to believe that
his flair had been at fault.
The competitive instinct, too, was unduly developed. He
hated being beaten in a game, and he would not admit
defeat in an argument. And in each case I think defeat
was distasteful for the same reason ; namely, that at bottom
he was so firmly convinced that his own side was best that
when it was worsted, or in danger of being worsted, he felt
a sense of injury because the righteous were not inheriting
the earth. The promise of this inheritance to the meek must
have been to him the hardest of Hard Sayings.
Yet if he played, or wrote, or talked for victory with
excessive zeal, I do not believe for one moment that egotism
was the cause. He knew his side was in the right, and his
plain duty was to make that side prevail : a refreshing trait
in these indifferent days when we lazily incline to hold that
there is so much to be said for any side of a question that
it matters little which gains the day.
There was something of a strain of Old Testament vin-
dictiveness in his make-up. He must, so it seems to me,
have had his moments when with the Psalmist he might
have cried : " Of thy goodness slay mine enemies : and destroy
all them that vex my soul." But, mark you, as with the
Psalmist so with him, his enemies were always the Lord s
enemies too : though, doubtless, he either was unconscious of
the coincidence, or, if he did remark it, was not disturbed
by it.
Still there was a very tender side to his character, which
perhaps came out most fully in his intercourse with those
who, raw from some recent bereavement, came for hope or
consolation to him, either simply as to one versed in the
problem of survival, or, as it were, to the keeper of an
authentic door of access to the other world, or even, indeed,
as to some Hierophant of the Mysteries of life and death.
To such as these he gave lavishly of his time, his counsel and
LIi.] Richard Hodgson: in Memoriawu. 367
his sympathy. They came to meet him half way, it is true,
but even so he won their confidence with extraordinary com
pleteness. Many of them poured out their hearts to him
without restraint ; and he, though naturally a man of deep
reserve where his innermost emotions were concerned, would,
repaying confidence with confidence, reveal to them his own most
intimate experiences and convictions, in the hope of thereby
lightening the darkness or assuaging the bitterness of their
despondency. And he won not only their confidence but
their gratitude also, and often their affection.
His failings, such as they were, were the outcome of his
intense earnestness. His virtues were those of a noble type
of man.
It was a fine life ; manly, simple, single of purpose, and—
best of all, perhaps—graced by warm and enduring friendships.

ON the twentieth of December, 1905, there died in the over-
active exercise of his body one whose life was preeminently
an exercise of the spirit. Indeed, it was as an explorer of
the spiritual realm, an adventurer beyond the bourne from
which he believed the return of travellers could be proved and
guided, that he was chiefly known to the world at large.
2
Through the last years of his life he was peculiarly identified
with the trance sittings of Mrs. Piper and the communications
from the spirit-groups of which he recognized " Phinuit " and
"Imperator" as the central figures. Though finally surrender
ing his own life to the direction of " Imperator," he sought to
retain in his work of interpretation for others the attitude
of the investigator insisting upon the best of evidence. It
was his unflagging desire to accumulate a mass of evidence
sufficient to form a reasonable hypothesis regarding the " spirit
world."
There is no lack of pathos, from one point of view, in his
having dropped this work unfinished. From another there is
the satisfaction of his having passed quickly, as he wished to
pass, from the present to the future life. More than one of
his friends recall the eagerness with which he said only last
summer, " I can hardly wait to die." A keen intellectual
curiosity regarding what awaited him was his own chief
concern about death. Then came that which he had desired ;
and neither the doubters nor his fellow-believers could wholly

To those who knew him in private his utter confidence in
the work was one of its highest justifications. To hear him
talk of that " other side " as if it were literally a room
separated from the house of life only by walls and doors of
glass, to see him year in and year out devoting to an idea
intellectual and moral powers which might well have won him
many of the rewards which men prize most,—this was to
realize in a measure the spirit which has animated the idealists
of every age, the spirit through which a man saves his life
by losing it.
The general and the personal significance of his work were
so inextricably twined together that it is hard to discuss it
at all without seeming to invade the inmost sanctities. Yet
in this company it is no sacrilege to quote from a private
letter of 1901 a passage which reveals at once the intense
conviction of Richard Hodgson's belief and the pure spiritual
faith of which it was the embodiment : " I went through toils
and turmoils and perplexities in '97 and '98 about the signifi
cance of this whole Imperator regime, but I have seemed to
get on a rock after that,—I seem to understand clearly the
reasons for incoherence and obscurity, etc., and I think that
if for the rest of my life from now I should never see
another trance or have another word from Imperator or his
group, it would make no difference to my knowledge that all
is well, that Imperator, etc., are all they claim to be and
are indeed messengers that we may call divine. Be of good
courage whatever happens, and pray continually, and let peace
come into your soul. Why should you be distraught and
worried ? Everything, absolutely everything,—from a spot of
ink to all the stars,—every faintest thought we think of to
the contemplation of the highest intelligence in the cosmos,
are all in and part of the infinite Goodness. Rest in that
Divine Love. All your trials are known better than you
know them yourself. Do you think it is an idle word that
the hairs of our heads are numbered ? Have no dismay.
Fear nothing and trust in God."
370 M. A. de Wolfe Howe. [PART
His friends and brothers here—for surely friendship and
brotherhood were almost indistinguishable in his relations with
us—care especially to remember one thing—that this idealist
did not detach himself from the most earth-bound of us all.
Though so much of his commerce was with the unseen, his feet
kept step with ours on solid earth. In the field of mental
activities, there was no one better qualified to discuss the
freshest topics of physical science, the events and tendencies
in the world of affairs, and their deeper significances. There
was no one here to whom the pleased discoverer of a new
minor poet—since the major phenomenon is so rare—could
come with such conviction that his discovery had been
anticipated. Indeed it was no unusual thing to have Dick
quote you off-hand the new singer's best verses, with all the
fervour and understanding which made him the favourite inter
preter of certain of our own poets. One cannot forget how
he entered into the reading of other men's verses. No matter
if there were twenty valentines or prize songs to be read
in a single evening, every one of them rang out in his loyal
voice as heartily as if Dick himself were the author, bent
upon bringing forth every particle of meaning or wit the
lines might contain. His intimate association with the more
serious muse will be a recurring remembrance to most of us,
when Christmas and New Year come round without the card
which brought us his poetic greeting, in which an old or a
new poet seemed merely the mouthpiece of the sender's own
thought.
Nor was this community of interest restricted by any
means to the things of the mind. The healthy Anglo-Saxon
devotion to every exhibition of physical prowess was con
spicuously characteristic of this child of the spirit. The pro
fessional ball game, the college boat race and football battle
excited his keenest interest ; and it was like him to double
his enjoyment in these sports by the companionship of one or
more of us. The cheery call for volunteers for the 2.20 boat
must remain one of the brightest memories of our summer
lunch-table, not only for those who used to join the almost
daily expeditions to Nantasket, and huddled into their clothes
while Dick's head was still a mere speck amongst the ocean
steamers and harbour islands, but for all whose paths led

inland or to other shores. In the pool-room, its dominating
figure was for the tyro the most patient and encouraging of
teachers, for the expert the most formidable of rivals, for
the box the most active inciter of tickets. Is it—by the
way—a mere coincidence that the parrot, since losing his
most devoted friend and champion, has stood in less need of
a defender than ever before ? In the squash-court Dick was
the best and gentlest of antagonists in victory or defeat.
From the gallery above it his initial inquiry, " Score ? " his
rallying shouts—" two-yard-line," " anybody's game "—put spirit
into the flagging player, and made him happily conscious of
a gallery to which it was no shame to play. Downstairs by
the fire-place and at the table above, it was generally Dick
who first taught the new member to know himself here by
his Christian name, and to feel that gray hairs and youth
might after all be contemporaries.
Just because he was the contemporary of all, the man between
whom and the rest of us the barriers were the fewest and
the lowest, he typified, perhaps more than any individual
member of the club, the spirit of the Tavern. The last
words that certain of us heard him speak are a memorable
illustration of his unique and beautiful place among us.
Eight or ten men were gathered in the lower room—one
defending an unpopular cause, which the others were hotly
denouncing. The debate was growing acrimonious. Down
from luncheon came Dick. " Go for the scoundrel," he thun
dered from the stairs. " Don't give him a chance to speak ;
down with him ! Don't let him be heard ! " The genial shout,
with its animating love of fair play as well as of peace,
drew a laugh and a response. " How can anybody be heard
when you're in the room, Dick ? " There was another laugh
—and the unpleasantness was past. A few moments later
Dick left the club. That evening his lifeless body was carried
upstairs.
A purity of nature which leaves his friends unable, even
should they try, to recall a single taint of coarseness in his
word or thought ; a sincerity like that of a true-hearted boy ;
an unselfishness and absence of egotism which made our
concerns far more often than his the topics of our personal
intercourse ; a self-respect which included in its operations a
2B

body as wholesome as the air and sea he loved ;—these must
surely be remembered in any enumeration of the qualities which,
made his personality so rare a blending of the spirit and
the flesh. Who better than our well-loved friend can remain
for us the interpretation and type of this blending ? What
man of us has lived in the flesh a life so illuminated and
controlled by the spirit that the transition from the seen to
the unseen could have seemed so short a journey as for him ?
One whose spirit, like our friend's, was clothed with the
whole armour of faith and courage has told what it is for
such a man to die : " In the hot-h't of life, a-tiptoe on the
highest point of being, he passes at a bound on to the
other side. The noise of the mallet and chisel is scarcely
quenched, the trumpets are hardly done blowing, when, trailing
with him clouds of glory, this happy-starred, full-blooded spirit
shoots into the spiritual land." l
It is much to have left behind one what Richard Hodgson
has left to us,—a memory the sweetest, the purest, the best-
beloved. When his spirit had gone on its final quest that
memory in all its freshness remained to hallow the room in
which he shared so many of our delights. There it brought
together an unexampled assemblage of the friends of him who
had come to us a stranger. For his sake the place which was
so truly his home must be, to us who like to call ourselves
his family, more than ever unlike all other places. For his
sake we shall sing without sorrow,
Meum est propositum in Taberna mori,—
for we shall sing it, remembering what it is both to live and
to die here, and rejoicing always in the sense of his continuing
fellowship.

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
Delivered on November 12th, 1906.
BY THE RIGHT HON. GERALD W. BALFOOR.
LOOKING at the list of past Presidents of our Society I
use no mere conventional form of speech when 1 say that
I am much more sensible of the honour which the Council
have done me in asking me to accept the office than of
any pretensions I possess of fitness to hold it. There is
hardly one of my distinguished predecessors who has not
taken an active and even eminent part in the work of
Psychical research. I unfortunately can make no such
claim. Although a member of the Society almost from the
year of its foundation, I must sadly confess that I have
in no way shared in its labours nor so much as contributed
a single paper to its Proceedings. While others have
written and worked, I have only been able to read and
ponder the evidence which they have accumulated, and even
that only in the intervals of a busy life otherwise employed.
In these circumstances if I venture to submit to you some
obiter cogitata of one who has hitherto been a sleeping
partner in the firm, it is to your kind indulgence that I
must trust to carry me through the task.
One of our former Presidents has recorded his opinion
that the simplest exercise of telepathic influence—the power
for instance which some people think they possess of
making others turn' round and look at them by a mere
exertion of will—would, from the purely scientific point
of view, if it were really established, be more extraordinary,
more mysterious, more worthy to excite intellectual curiosity,
374 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfowr. [PART
than the annihilation of the planet on which we live by
collision with some hitherto unknown body travelling through
space. The latter event, he argued, however dramatically
extraordinary, would involve no modification or even
extension of accepted theories regarding the laws which
govern the movements of the celestial bodies. On the other
hand the direct action of one mind on another would seem
to introduce us to a region ordered according to other laws
than those which obtain in any department of experience
which received Science has made its own.
In contrast with this statement may be set the emphatic
declaration of Professor Flournoy that if telepathy did not
exist, it would be necessary to invent it. "Direct action"
he tells us " between living beings is a thing so completely
in harmony with all we know of nature, that it would be
difficult not to assume it a priori, even in the absence of
any perceptible indication of the fact. How is it con
ceivable," he goes on to ask, " that the activity of such
complex seats of chemical phenomena as the nervous centres
should not be accompanied by the emission of various
undulations, X, Y, or Z rays, that pass through the skull
like the sun through a pane of glass and proceed to act,
no matter what the distance, on the corresponding centres
inside other skulls? The question is merely one of
intensity."
These two expressions of opinion seem at first sight in
direct conflict ; and no doubt they proceed from very
different conceptions of the real nature of telepathy and of
its modus operandi. On the subject of this difference I
shall have more to say in the sequel. In the meantime
let me point out that in a limited sense it is possible to
reconcile the two views ; for we may admit the extraordinary
and even epoch-making character of a discovery, and yet
when once it has been made, feel that it fits in with
metaphysical or scientific presuppositions in a way that
ought to have made us anticipate and look out for it
beforehand.
It is doubtless in consequence of some such presuppositions
that I have never personally felt oppressed by any sense
of antecedent improbability in the phenomena of telepathy.
LII.] Presidential Address. 375
Unlike Professor Flournoy, however, my presuppositions
have been metaphysical rather than physical or mechanical ;
and as in this respect I fancy my case is somewhat
exceptional, an attempt to approach the subject from this
standpoint may not be altogether without freshness or
interest for members of the Society.
Our ordinary conception of the world presented to us in
experience represents it as consisting of a multitude of
individual existences or things, connected together under
conditions of space and time. Enquiry into the ultimate
nature of the elements of reality, and into their relations to
each other and to the whole of which they are parts, belongs
admittedly to the realm of metaphysical speculation. But
even the simple and unelaborated description I have just
given is saturated with metaphysical ideas. The fact is,
we are all of us metaphysicians, even when we are least
aware of the fact. Common sense itself is an inveterate
metaphysician, and all that the most gifted philosophic
genius can aspire to accomplish is the transmutation of the
crude ideas of common sense into something more nearly
approaching, or perhaps 1 should rather say less hopelessly
remote from, a clear and coherent system.
I need hardly say that I have no intention this afternoon
to ask you to engage in any such enterprise. I do not propose
either to enter upon a metaphysical discussion or even to
lay down dogmatically any ideas of my own on the universe
at large. But as, in every general view of the connection
of things in a common world, we all practically start with
some presuppositions, I shall invite you, in the case of
certain presuppositions which I will briefly state, to give
them temporary admission to your minds in a purely
provisional way, and then to consider in what direction they
lead us. The ideas for which I ask this favour make no
claim to novelty, and are far from being metaphysical
paradoxes. On the contrary, they may fairly be said to
have behind them a very respectable body of philosophic
authority.
Consent then for the moment to assume with me that
the world consists of a plurality of individual existences or
real things which not only coexist in space and are subject
376 Right Hon. Gerald W. Baifour. [PART
to changes in time, but also continuously interact with each
other so as to form a connected system in which each part
at once determines and is determined by the rest, and a
change in each is ipso facto a change in all the others.
Consent further to admit that centres of psychical activity
or minds, as well as centres of physical activity constituting
the material world, are to be included among these indi
vidual existences, which accordingly fall into two kinds, in
appearance at least of disparate nature.
It is of course evident that these propositions occupy only a
fraction of the metaphysical field, and would have to be taken
as subject to modification and qualification in any attempt to
fit them into a systematic whole. Even as they stand they
will at once suggest to any student of metaphysics a legion of
difficult questions, which it is impossible for me to pursue
on this occasion. Volumes have been written upon these
questions in the past ; volumes will no doubt be written
on them in the future ; and whether mankind will be more
successful in reaching a final conclusion than were those
irrepressible metaphysicians among Milton's fallen angels,
who " found no end in wandering mazes lost," when dis
cussing similar topics, is a matter on which I should not like
to express a confident opinion.
If however this uncertainty be objected to my present
procedure, I reply with the double plea already advanced.
In the first place, thinking beings cannot really rid them
selves of metaphysical presuppositions, however much they
may deceive themselves into thinking this to be possible.
In the second place I do not ask you to accept these particular
presuppositions as either true or adequate, but only to adopt
them provisionally as working hypotheses. As such it may
perhaps be counted in their favour, that on the whole they
correspond more closely to common-sense beliefs than do
most metaphysical constructions, and further that they may
possibly be found, as we advance, to have an unexpectedly
suggestive bearing on the phenomena of telepathy with which
I am concerned in this Address.
It is to this application of them that I proceed.
\ world of reciprocal determination in which each element
is conceived as acting upon and being acted upoa
Ml.] Presidential Address. 377
by every other, must evidently, if any kind of change is
admitted into it, form a system in a continuous state of
process. Its condition as a whole at an> t,'iven moment
will be at once effect and cause ; effect of its cocdrtioL. u-
a whole in the moment immediately preceding, and cause
•of its condition as a whole in the moment immediately
following.
This principle of totality in causation must not however
be so interpreted as to exclude the possibility of distinguish
able chains of causal relation between individual elements
•or groups of elements in accordance with general laws.
This is, in fact, a necessary assumption without which the
-empirical sciences could not advance a single inch. For
the whole work of these sciences is to ascertain from
•experience the particular laws which govern the relations of
different kinds subsisting between real things, and therefore
presupposes that such laws exist and are discoverable.
Now we admit that real things fall into two kinds : on
the one side psychical existences or minds ; on the other
side the physical elements which underlie the material world.
It may be that we ought not to represent the distinction as
absolute. It may be that every element of reality unites
in itself a dual aspect, psychical and physical. On this view
there would be no mind or soul entirely without physical
activity, nor any material element wholly destitute of
psychical attributes, and the difference between them would
pass into a difference of degree. I wish not to exclude this
possibility, nor to regard it as inconsistent with our pre
supposition.
But for my present purpose it is not necessary to soften
away the distinction between mind and matter in this
fashion. I am content to accept the disparity, only insisting
that it is not to be pushed to the point of denying all
possibility of interaction between them.
Let me now carry you a step further. In a world such
as that which I have asked you to conceive, you cannot
legitimately separate existing things from the relations
between them. For those relations belong to, even though
they may not exhaust, the essence of the things. Therefore
to distinguish between kinds of things is to distinguish
378 Right Hon. Gerald W. Bcdfour. [PART
between kinds of relations. If the elements of reality
fall into two kinds, centres of psychical activity and
centres of physical activity, and if every element of reality
interacts according to general laws with every other, it
would certainly seem that there must be relations of inter
action between them of at least three kinds, according as the
interaction takes place between physical and physical, between
physical and psychical, or between psychical and psychical.
Now interaction between the physical elements of reality
is generally admitted, and the laws in accordance with which
it takes place form the subject of the various branches of
Physical Science.
Interaction between the physical and psychical elements
of reality is not so generally accepted, and the difficulty of
conceiving any causal relation between matter and mind has
been so strongly felt as to lead to theories which either deny
the reality of the one or of the other, or else ascribe the
undoubted correspondence between body and mind to a
perpetual miracle or to a pre-established harmony. According
to our view they reciprocally determine each other : but in
any case the correspondence itself is admittedly subject to
laws ; and the ascertainment of these laws belongs to that
province of psychology which is known as psycho-physics.
Under the same general head of interaction between psychical
and physical existences, a place might have to be found for
the phenomena of telaesthesia and telekinesis, should the
evidence be such as to establish the reality of those phenomena.
There remains the question of direct interaction between
psychical existences. Does such interaction really obtain?
Will a science of its laws ever come into being?
These are questions which our presuppositions drive us to
ask, and to which they seem to suggest, and even to require,
an affirmative answer. But let me once more remind you,
I have no desire to dogmatise. Even granting the reasoning
be sound, the presuppositions themselves may be erroneous.
If however I have succeeded in inducing you to follow me
thus far, you will understand why it is that speaking for
myself I am predisposed to accept the reality of telepathic
phenomena, and at least to sympathise with Professor
lournoy, if I cannot go quite the length of agreeing with
r|
LII.] Presidential Address. 379
him, when he says that telepathy would have to be invented
even if no experiential evidence in favour of it existed.
You will also understand that I have been led to this
conclusion by reasons very different from those which have
guided the distinguished Professor himself ; and indeed that
he and I mean by telepathy very different things. I mean
by it direct interaction between psychical existences or
minds. Professor Flournoy also, in the passage I have
already quoted, speaks of " direct action between living
beings " as being completely in harmony with all that is
known of nature. But action which is conceived as taking
place by means of undulations propagated through a physical
medium is not " direct " action in the sense in which I use
the term. Indeed if it is legitimate to distinguish, as we
have agreed to do, between mind and brain, the modus
operandi of action between mind and mind would be,
according to Professor Flournoy's view doubly or trebly
indirect. First the mind must act upon the nervous centres,
secondly the vibrations set up in the nervous centres must
give rise to undulations propagated through some physical
medium, next these undulations must stimulate the nerve
centres in some other brain, and lastly the stimulus applied
to the nerve centres must translate itself into consciousness
in the mind attached to that other brain. It is not how
ever necessary to press this point. Even if we cover up all
questions concerning the relations of mind and body under
the convenient term of " living being," we must still insist
that psychical action transmitted by means of physical
mechanism is a very different thing from that immediate
action between mind and mind which the presuppositions
from which we started have brought us to anticipate.
Immediate action between mind and mind may have physical
action as its invariable concomitant ; but this physical action
would not, according to the view I have put before you,
belong to the special chain of causal relation for which we
always look when we are seeking to understand a phenomenon
by referring it to general laws. In other words it would
be in the nature of a side-effect, much as noise accompanies
the discharge of a rifle but is properly not regarded as the
cause of the propulsion of the bullet. ,.-»—-
380 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
Even at the risk of being unnecessarily tedious, I do not
like to leave this topic without once more guarding myself
against a possible misconception. I am afraid I may have
produced in some of you the impression that I am trying
to give a metaphysical proof of the truth of telepathy. That
is not so. What I have done is to take certain metaphysical
presuppositions, which on general grounds seem to me worthy
of provisional acceptance, and shew, or attempt to shew,
that some direct interaction between psychical existences is
involved in the implications which they contain. It is
natural to suppose that one form at all events which such
interaction may take, will be the communication of thoughts
and feelings and impulses and inhibitions from one centre of
consciousness to another. When we find that there is a con
siderable body of evidence drawn from experience that com
munication of this nature otherwise than through the recognised
channels of sense actually occurs, the fact that this evidence
harmonises with any preconceived idea we may have formed
inevitably and legitimately tells in its favour. But no d
priori chain of reasoning can take the place of experience
in a matter of this kind. It may safely be affirmed that in
the complete absence of all evidence from experience that
such a phenomenon has ever occurred, we should, in spite
of Professor Flournoy, either not think it necessary to invent
telepathy, or if we did invent it on grounds of .a priori
probability, we should certainly not consider it worth while
to carry our speculations on the subject very far. We cannot
hope to rest the proof of telepathy on any other ground than
that of solid fact. I am prepared to go yet further, and
to admit that we must look to experience not only for proof
•of the truth of telepathic communication between mind and
mind, but also for the solution of difficult questions concerning
the true nature of the phenomenon such as those on which
I have the misfortune not to see eye to eye with Professor
Flournoy. He takes one view of the subject ; I am disposed
to take another; but we should, I think, both of us have
to confess that our difference of opinion depends more on
the presuppositions with which we start, and less upon
observed facts than either of us could desire.
we then to conclude that there is no room left for
LIi.] Presidential Address. 381
speculative consideration of the subject and that no useful
purpose can be served by it? I think that would be
to go beyond the mark, and for two reasons. In the first
place our readiness to receive evidence in support of what
is strange and unfamiliar will always depend in some degree
upon the antecedent probability or improbability which our
minds instinctively attach to it : and this again upon the
ease or difficulty which the new idea has in fitting in with
the rest of our mental furniture. I am quite conscious
that speculations of the kind in which I have indulged to-day
have had considerable weight in my own case, and it is
possible there may be some others like-minded with myself.
There is also another consideration to be taken into account.
It is true that the sciences draw their material from
•experience. But the further each science pushes the limits
of enquiry, the more it tends to pass beyond into the region
of metaphysics. Even the physical sciences have yielded to
this tendency ; it is still more marked in psychology ; it is
practically inevitable in that department of psychology which
specially interests this Society and which has been baptised,
not very happily perhaps, with the name of Metapsychics.
Let me give you two or three illustrations of this tendency
from among many that might be cited. The question of
the possibility of action at a distance has long been a
stumbling block to physicists. Most physicists deny the
possibility altogether, apparently on a priori grounds. At all
-events the denial cannot as yet claim the universal and
unequivocal support of experience even as regards the
material world. Now the question whether in any particular
case or class of cases the action of one body on another can
be shewn to be exerted by transmission through a con
tinuous medium would certainly seem to be one for physicists
to determine. But the dogma that action at a distance is
inconceivable appears to me, I confess, to involve meta
physical considerations even if confined to physical action,
and certainly involves metaphysical considerations if uni
versally applied to real existences in general.
I have given you an illustration derived from Physics.
If we want one drawn from psychology there is no need to
.go beyond a topic already touched upon in this address.
382 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
You have only to open any work on psychology which is
not content with a purely superficial treatment of the subject,
to see how difficult and almost impossible psychologists find
it to avoid raising the question of the existence and nature
of the Soul. They may make a gallant effort to eliminate
it, but it pervades and colours all their speculations
notwithstanding.
Let me cite yet another instance, taken from that region
of enquiry which more especially concerns the Society for
Psychical Research. There is probably no subject which more
keenly interests a majority of our members than that of
the rational grounds for a belief in immortality. But how
far can the investigations of the Society throw light on the
problem of immortality? Clearly only to a limited extent.
It may be possible to obtain evidence from experience
sufficient to convince us that a centre of conscious activity
carrying on memories of our corporeal existence does in
certain cases survive the dissolution of the body. But this
is by no means equivalent to proof of the immortality of
the Soul ; of which indeed it is evident from the nature of
the case we can have no experience whatever. Proof of
survival after bodily death of a conscious self retaining
memories of the living personality may, and in fact must,
have an important bearing on the larger question, especially
in the way of removing difficulties and objections. But
any rational ground of belief in the immortality of the
Soul must in the end be speculative and result from the
general view we take of the meaning and purpose of the
universe as an intelligible system.
Do not suppose that I call attention to the tendency of
the sciences to pass over into metaphysics in order to
condemn it. On the contrary, I believe it to be both
inevitable and right. It seems to be more than probable
that Metaphysics and Science are destined in the future to
draw nearer and nearer together ; that Science will find it
more and more necessary to examine its fundamental
conceptions in the light of metaphysical considerations, and
that Metaphysics on the other hand must be prepared for
continual revision of its constructions with reference to the
•"«"• accumulating stores of knowledge derived from experi

ence. Each will in this way suggest problems to the other,
and each contribute its help towards their solution.
•j
I have now laid before you my justification for the pro
cedure which I have adopted in this address. Shall I be
deemed overbold if in the remainder of the time at my
disposal I try to provide you with a practical example of
the kind of co-operation between metaphysics and science
which I have in my mind?
There are certain problems connected with telepathy, which
any one approaching the subject as I have done from the
metaphysical side is bound to face. He who proceeds step
by step in pursuit of empirical fact is not called upon to
go beyond bare affirmation of that which observation has
established. But the moment he begins to theorise, especially
if he attempts to shew grounds for anticipating that particular
phenomena will occur, something more is necessary. He
mast be prepared to shew not merely that the phenomena
do sometimes occur, but also that they occur in every case
in which their occurrence was to be anticipated in accordance
with the theory. Or if he cannot do this, at least he must
be prepared with some explanation which accounts for
apparent exceptions to the rule. The fact that communica
tions of impressions, feelings, and impulses do occur between
living beings otherwise than through the recognised channels
of sense will probably be accepted without demur in this
audience ; and perhaps I may be permitted on this occasion
to take it for granted. From my point of view, however,
that is not enough, and I am bound to ask myself the further
question : Why is the phenomenon, so far as actual experi
ence goes, a comparatively rare and exceptional one? If it
belongs to the very essence of minds that they should interact
with each other, and if telepathy is the form we should
naturally expect such interaction to take, why is it not more
frequent? Why indeed is it not universal?
The answer I am disposed to give to this question would
be that taken in the widest sense telepathy probably is
universal, and that what is rare and exceptional is only our
realisation of it. It is quite true that this cannot be proved.
But it is to be noticed that the difficulties in the way of
384 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PAKT
proof arise from the very same causes which would interfere
to prevent our recognising the universal agency of telepathy
supposing it to be universal.
The first and most obvious case is that in which the
interaction takes place but the psychical effect resulting from
it either fails to reach the level of consciousness, or at most
amounts to no more than an obscure modification of the total
psychical content, and cannot be analysed out as one of the
distinguishable and definite components of that content.
The notion of a psychical impression which does not reach
the level of consciousness may seem a strange one ; but we are
driven to it, at all events as a limiting conception, the moment
we admit degrees of distinctness and indistinctness in conscious
impressions. As regards modifications of the total psychical
content which are too vague and general to allow of particular
analysis, it must be remembered that when telepathic com
munication takes place, we are not, according to my view,
to conceive it as the passing over of an impression intact from
one mind to another. On the contrary, what we are dealing
with is an interaction between two elements, both of which
enter as essential factors into the result.
Passing next to telepathic impressions which do reach the
level of distinct consciousness and are sufficiently definite to
be separately distinguishable, it by no means follows that we
should be aware of their true origin. Let me mention in
particular two classes of such cases, in which telepathic action
may be really at work and yet remain entirely unrecognised
either by the persons affected or by an observer.
The ordinary interchange of thought between one indi
vidual and another is effected by means of signs, which are
conveyed through the senses of touch, of hearing, or of
sight. It would be extravagant indeed to suppose that in
the case of written signs telepathy plays any part in
conveying the meaning of the writer to the reader ; but
are we to assert this also in cases where the communication
is by word of mouth, by gesture, or by physical contact'.'
Surely in such cases it is not a wildly improbable conjecture
to suppose that the indirect communication by signs may
find as it were an ally and auxiliary in the direct simultaneous
interaction of mind with mind. I am far from affirming
LII.] Presidential Address. 385
positively that this is so : but some slight support for it
may perhaps be derived from observed facts. I may instance
the wonderful sway which a great orator is able to exercise
over an audience, far beyond any influence which the same
words uttered by less gifted speakers would exert ; the marked
preference which even students of dry and difficult subjects
display (though I confess I never shared it myself), for
oral over written discourse ; the striking facility exhibited
by very young children in grasping the meaning of words
which they hear for the first time ; the apparently similar
results obtained iu certain hypnotic cases, when a transition
is made from the uttered word of command to purely
mental suggestion. In the case of animals again it may be
worth while to notice in this connection the surprising
intelligence which many dogs show in interpreting the
slightest indication given by their masters ; the quickness
of the very young offspring of certain animals to understand
and obey the different notes of warning or encouragement
sounded by the parent ; the apparent simplicity of the signs
employed by members of insect communities compared with
the complexity of their social life. No doubt it may seem
fanciful to trace telepathy in all this : but even so, the
point I wish to emphasize remains, namely, that in every
case in which communication by means of sounds, gesture,
or physical contact takes place the contributory action of
telepathy is possible, and yet, even if actual, would probably
escape notice and certainly elude proof, because masked and
hidden from observation behind the more obvious role played
by the ordinary machinery of communication.
A second class of cases in which telepathic action may
form , or help to form , conscious impressions , and yet altogether
fail of recognition, is of greater importance and interest.
Our ordinary sense perceptions carry with them a direct
reference to real objects outside of us, and reflection enables
us to distinguish between our subjective impressions and the
objects which we know by means of these impressions, and
which we regard as in some sense giving rise to them. But
there are other states of consciousness which carry with them
no such external reference, and which we treat as purely
subjective states without cognitive significance. Can any o'
386 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. |>art
these states, which we are accustomed to look upon as purely
subjective, be really, in part or in whole, the expression of
the direct action of other minds upon our own?
If so, the field for undetected telepathic action is evidently
very wide indeed. For such subjective states form a large
part of the stream of consciousness in both the waking
and dreaming life of each of us. Impressions keep stream
ing through the mind apparently unsummoned by any
conscious act of will ; yet their telepathic origin , if they
had one, might remain forever concealed in the absence of
any sign which gave either an immediate assurance of the
fact or else a basis from which it might be inferred.
The truth is that for a case of spontaneous, as opposed
to experimental, telepathy to be even suspected, the first
requisite is that the impression should be of a striking
character, an incongruous intrusion into the stream of
consciousness, and for that very reason exceptional. Or if
this arresting character is absent, its place must be supplied
by a precision of coincidence such as is artificially provided
in experimental telepathy, and this again is exceptional.
I submit then that the comparative rarity of instances in
which telepathy is suspected, let alone proved, does not
justify a conclusion as to the rarity of the phenomenon itself.
It may be common, nay universal (if we include under the
name of telepathy cases in which though a real psychical
interaction may take place , its effects are too weak to rise above
the threshold of distinct consciousness), and yet it may escape
detection. After all gravitation is universal in the material
world, yet civilised mankind had lived and thought for many
hundred years in blissful unconsciousness of the fact that
any connection existed between the fall of an apple to the
ground and the majestic motion of the heavenly bodies.
If telepathy be universal there is yet another aspect of
it of which account must be taken. So far, both in experi
mental telepathy and in recorded cases of spontaneous
telepathy, the interaction has generally been confined to a
single agent and a single percipient. There are a certain
number of cases in which a telepathic impression appears
to have been received by more than one percipient simul
taneously ; and there may be a few in which the evidence
lii.] Presidential Address. 387
points to joint agency. The rapport already referred to
between great orators and their audiences may possibly be
in some degree telepathic. It is also conceivable that the
mysteriously rapid diffusion of important news over large
areas, of which strange tales come to us from the East and
elsewhere , is to be referred to a similar origin ; and the
same may be true of certain of the phenomena that often
accompany religious revivals. On the whole, however, it
is safe to say that in the clear and unmistakeable cases of
telepathic communication actually known to us, very few, and
for the most part only two, individuals have been concerned.
I should like to connect with this observation a further
one concerning the character and content of telepathic
impressions as exhibited in our evidential cases. These
impressions almost always shew a marked character of
particularity. They consist of definite sensations, impulses,
mental pictures or externalised hallucinations. Even when
they can properly be described as ideas, they are usually
ideas of a definite and concrete event or series of events ;
rarely abstract and general ideas. Some exceptions may be
found in certain cases of automatic writing, and perhaps also
in trance utterances ; but these are not sufficient to invalidate
the general rule.
Now these two characteristics of the evidential cases of
telepathy I put together because I believe there is a real
connection between them. All direct evidence of telepathic
action is based on some proved correspondence between the
contents of different minds which it is not possible either to
regard as accidental or to account for by communication
through the ordinary channels of the senses. The more
minute and detailed the coincidence, the more telling it will
be for evidential purposes. In this respect particular and
concrete impressions would appear to have an advantage over
general and abstract ideas. But is it likely that particular
and concrete impressions will arise from the telepathic inter
action of a multitude of minds? So far as I am aware, little,
if any, light has been thrown upon this question by any
experimental results to which we can appeal ; but upon broad
grounds of probability I should be disposed to answer it in
the negative, unless for some reason or another a given
2c
388 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
particular impression is already present in a considerable
proportion of the minds concerned. Accordingly, if telepathic
interaction belongs to the essence of all minds, it seems not
unreasonable to draw two further conclusions. First, that
most, if not all, evidential cases of telepathy are likely to be
cases in which a special and exceptional telepathic responsive
ness or rapport has been established—we do not yet know
how, save that a particular direction of attention and will
seem to have something to do with it—between a limited
number of individual minds ; and secondly, that if an all-
embracing psychical interaction can anywhere be traced, it
is in the region of universals that we must expect to find it.
We often speak of ideas being " in the air " ; and the
common tendency of thought in particular epochs has been
so marked as even to lead to the personification—with more
or less of conscious metaphor—of a Zeitgeist to account for
it. This is of course mere mythology. Whatever of mystery
the phenomenon in question may still present, after more
obvious explanations have been exhausted, can be more
satisfactorily explained by reciprocal telepathic action between
many contemporaneous minds. But there is a region of ideas
beyond these passing phases of opinion and sentiment. What
of the ultimate constitutive notions which lie at the foundation
of all knowledge, making a common universe for our common
reason? What of the moral ideas which bind mankind
together, and cause us to be members one of another? Is it
too wild a flight of speculative fancy to imagine that these
are in some sort sustained and ever more and more fully
realised through the direct intercommunion of all spiritual
beings, and that telepathy in its highest aspect is an actively
unifying principle leading us upwards and onwards, the
manifestation in the world of spirits of the supreme unity of
the Divine Mind?
The theme is a tempting one for the metaphysician. But
it is difficult breathing at such elevations. Let us be content
with less high matters, and direct our course again towards
earth.
Under the guidance of the presuppositions from which we
agreed to start, we have been brought to the idea of
LII.] Presidential Address. 389
telepathy as the universal form of interaction between
psychical existences, and even, it may be, the fundamental
bond of unity and principle of development within the entire
spiritual world. Let us now take up the clue once more,
and following where it leads the way, try if we cannot
discover yet another region in which telepathic agency,
though its presence there has hitherto been unsuspected, may
none the less be found to play an all-important part.
The region I refer to is that of the human personality
itself. In the monumental work which he bequeathed to
this Society and to the world Frederic Myers tells us that
he regards each man as at once " profoundly unitary and
almost infinitely composite, as inheriting from earthly
ancestors a multiplex and ' colonial ' organism—polyzoic and
perhaps polypsychic in an extreme degree ; but also as ruling
and unifying that organism by a soul or spirit absolutely
beyond our present analysis." With due reserve as to ulterior
implications, I for one accept this description so far as it
represents the real self of each of us as one and indivisible,
but nevertheless associated in our organism with other centres
of conscious activity.
Evidence has been constantly accumulating within recent
years of the contemporaneous presence of more than one
stream of consciousness in the same human being. No mere
alternations of personality, however striking, nor any change
however great that takes place in the self when it passes
from the waking to the hypnotic state, would suffice to prove
the simultaneous existence of more than one consciousness
in the organism. For these different states could still be
conceived as being what in most cases they probably are,
narrltely, successive states of the same consciousness.
This explanation cannot however be used to account for
so-called automatic actions requiring the exercise of a reason
ing faculty for their performance, yet working themselves
out without the knowledge of the waking self while the latter
is otherwise engaged : still less can it account for certain
extreme cases of disintegrated personality in which two
distinct and fully developed selves appear on the stage at
the same time. Take for instance the extraordinary case
of Miss Beauchamp, under observation for many years by
390 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
Dr. Prince of Boston, in which two of the personalities
engage in an open conflict of wills, one of them deliberately
and repeatedly produces hallucination in the other, and is able
to play the part of a sane spectator looking on at the other's
delirious dreamings.
It is true that most of these cases could be explained
by supposing a duality, not a multiplicity of conscious
activities in the single organism : but the principle once
admitted, there are many phenomena in abnormal and even
in normal psychology which are most easily accounted for
assuming an almost indefinite possibility of dissociation
among the elements that go to form the normal personality
—different groups of ideas and memories " splitting off " as
it were from the main current of consciousness and setting
up a certain independent existence of their own.
How then, on this hypothesis, are we to conceive the
relations of the central individuality to the body as a whole
and to the various subordinate activities of consciousness
associated with it, in such a way as to do justice at once
to the unitary character of the soul and the complexity of
the factors which constitute the personality as we know it?
This is the problem which Myers attacks in earlier
chapters of his great work. Of the masterly manner in which
from many points of view he has performed the task I need
not speak.
No unprejudiced person can fail to recognize the marvellous
combination of qualities which the writer has brought to his
work—the boldness, the industry, the eloquence, the rare
felicity of style and fecundity of literary illustration, the
power of co-ordination in dealing with masses of detail, the
imaginative insight, the burning enthusiasm, the unconquer
able faith in the ultimate triumph of the spiritual element.
On the other hand I must in all humility confess that I
have never yet succeeded in forming a clear idea of what Myers
means by the subliminal self, or in what relation he conceives
it to stand with the supraliminal self on the one side, and
on the other with the indwelling soul, or truly spiritual part
of us, which he identifies with the unknown real self and
believes to survive the dissolution of its earthly tabernacle.
According to Myers' view there exist in all of us " sub-
LII.] Presidential Address. 391
merged thoughts and emotions which possess the character
istics which we associate with conscious life " ; and as, in
addition to these isolated subliminal processes, " there is also
a continuous subliminal chain of memory (or more chains
than one) involving just that kind of individual and persistent
revival of old impressions, and response to new ones, which
we commonly call a Self "—I am quoting his own words -
he finds it " permissible and convenient to speak of subliminal
selves, or more briefly of a Subliminal Self." It is true that
he goes on to warn us that he does not by using this term
assume that there are two correlative and parallel selves
existing always within each of us " but rather means by
the subliminal self that part of the self which is commonly
subliminal." But this qualification seems to mean no more
than that the subliminal stream of intelligence, although
concurrent, is not habitually organised up to the point of
ranking as a second fully developed self side by side with
the supra-liminal current of consciousness which common
sense regards as our real self. As it seems to be admitted
that it can and does become so organised in exceptional cases,
the distinction appears to be only one of degree. Anyway the
various " quasi-independent trains of thought " are conceived
as " co-operating " together ; messages can pass from the
submerged to the emergent self, and " suggestions " can be
impressed by the supra-liminal self on the subliminal.
Now it is just at this point that the question I wish to
press comes in. It requires two to co-operate, as it requires
two to quarrel. In what sense are we to understand the
co-operation between distinct streams of consciousness, and
what is the meaning of these " messages " and " suggestions "
that pass between the subliminal and supra-liminal selves?
From the standpoint taken up in this address this question
admits I think of an intelligible answer. It is hardly
consistent with our presuppositions to assume that there
can be thought without a thinker. Psychology as a science
may find it convenient to speak of ideas and mnemonic
chains and states of consciousness as if these could subsist
in the void. For us however this conception must remain
an illegitimate abstraction, and we must hold that ideas and
states of consciousness are in reality only forms of the
392 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
activity of a psychical entity or mind, even though that mind
fall far short of the degree of development implied in a self-
conscious personality.
If then every distinct stream of consciousness implies a
distinct centre of psychical activity or mind, a plurality of
distinct streams of consciousness in man implies a plurality
of minds associated in the human organism. If interaction
between these minds takes place indirectly it must be through
the medium of the physical elements of the organism. If
it takes place directly there would appear to be the strongest
presumption in favour of regarding it as telepathic, telepathy
being the only form of direct action between mind and mind
which has any support from experience. It is quite possible
however that it may take place in both ways ; and if a
conjecture for which we left room some little time ago has
any foundation in the real order of things—namely that no
finite mind is entirely without physical activity, nor any
material element wholly destitute of psychical attributes—
then it is conceivable that the two ways may shade off into
each other.
Would Myers have accepted this answer? Singular as it
may appear, I am not aware that in any part of his book
he has discussed the nature of the interaction between the
supraliminal and subliminal selves. Nevertheless the idea
that this interaction may in part at least be telepathic in its
character seemed to me so natural that I could not help
feeling some surprise that it should not have occurred to an
intellect so fertile and ingenious. And in fact, after con
siderable searching I have come across one passage in which
a hint of such a possibility is given. The passage occurs
in the first chapter of the second volume, and consists
practically of a couple of sentences.
"Wherever there is hallucination," writes Myers, "whether
delusive or veridical, I hold that a message of some
sort is forcing its way upwards from one stratum of person
ality to another,—a message which may be merely dreamlike
and incoherent, or which may symbolize a fact otherwise
unreachable by the percipient personality. And the mechan-
seems much the same whether the message's path be
within one individual, or pass between two;
LJI.] Presidential Address. 393
whether A's own submerged self be signalling to his emergent
self, or B be telepathically stimulating the hidden fountains
of perception in A." Here is a distinct hint of telepathic
action between the two selves within one individual. But
the hint is not further followed up, and what is stranger
still, it seems to be confined to the case of hallucinations
produced in the supraliminal self by the action of the sub
liminal, and not to extend, or be meant to extend, to
" suggestion " proceeding from the upper to the lower stratum.
It is perhaps worth noting that Myers often seems inclined
to regard telepathy as the peculiar prerogative of the subliminal
self. This is of course quite inconsistent with the idea of
telepathic action within the organism. It has always appeared
to me a curious paradox which the evidence before us fails
to support, and I believe nothing will be lost by its definite
and explicit rejection.
On the view which I have tentatively outlined, it is
possible, I think, to frame a more definite conception of the
different factors that unite to form the individual human
being, and of the relations between them, than I, at all
events, have been able to derive from Myers' account of the
supraliminal and subliminal selves.
Every psychical centre associated with the organism would,
in accordance with this view, have to be regarded as " sub
liminal " to every other, though indeed it might be better
to drop that term altogether in describing the relation as
I conceive it. The Self of which we are each of us
conscious is neither the organism as a whole nor any
grouping of psychical centres within the organism. It is
a single mind or soul whose conscious states at any given
moment are the expression of its reaction against its entire
environment. What is its environment? In the larger
sense (and this must not be forgotten in considering the
question of survival after the dissolution of the organism),
its environment is nothing less than the whole universe other
than itself. In the narrower sense its environment is the
physical organism and every psychical centre associated
therewith. The presupposition of a plurality of real existences,
coupled with the observed facts as to the concurrent activity
of distinct streams of consciousness within a single organism
394 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
has thus inevitably brought us in sight of the idea first put
forward by Leibnitz, that the living creature is a kind of
hierarchy of monads arranged in orderly and systematic
relations with each other, each reflecting in its own way the
states of consciousness of all the rest. Only whereas
Leibnitz denied all real interaction between the monads and
sought to account for the apparent interaction by his famous
doctrine of Pre-established Harmony, we have assumed
throughout that the interaction is real, and conjectured that
in part at least it might be of essentially the same character
as that which, as between distinct living organisms, we call
telepathic.
What, then, on the psychical side, would be the purpose
served by the organism? It seems not unreasonable to
regard it as an important, perhaps even a necessary, factor
in the establishment, within a particular group of psychical
centres, of a special telepathic rapport. In a normal state
of the organism the rapport would be such as to result
in the harmonious co-operation of all the centres under
the guidance and control of the one dominant centre
which constitutes the real self of each of us. The healthy
human being would thus resemble a well-ordered community
in which each subordinate member, in silent understanding
with his fellow subjects and with the head of the state, duly
carries out the appropriate task imposed on him either by
the behests of the latter or by the laws on which the well-
being of the community itself depends.
Abnormal conditions would imply a disturbance of the
telepathic rapport, which in extreme cases may apparently
go so far as to alter the whole character and interrupt the
continuity of memory of the dominant self, or even depose
it from its headship of the community and place a rival self
in possession.
Complete and final cessation of the special telepathic
rapport within the organism I take to be the true significance
of death.
What is there in all this, you may be inclined to say, but
one more unverifiable hypothesis? Well, perhaps. But in
the territory which the Society for Psychical Research has set
itself to explore, I am afraid we shall often have to content
Lii.] Presidential Address. 395
ourselves with hypotheses that can have no other verification
than this; that they offer the framework into which, for the
moment at least, the accumulated facts of experience, together
with those certitudes of which we seem to have immediate
assurance, can be fitted most easily, and with the least violence
and stretching, into the semblance of a coherent whole.
Verification, like so much else, is in the end seen to be a
question of degree : and in this respect no hard and fast
line can be drawn between the hypotheses of metaphysics
and those of science. Moreover as regards the particular
hypothesis now in question, probably the least verifiable part
of it is that which is already contained, by implication, in
the original metaphysical presuppositions from which we
agreed to start concerning the plurality of real existences.
If you refuse me absolution for these, it would be vain to
hope that you will pardon the temerity of any other specula
tion in which I may have indulged to-day.
For those indeed who are prepared to concede these pre
suppositions, and who are also believers in telepathy and
in the poly-psychic nature of the human organism, the further
step of admitting telepathic interaction between the psychical
elements of the organism ought not to seem a long one. It
may be difficult and perhaps impossible to prove telepathic
agency in this case as in many others ; but it is equally
difficult or impossible to disprove it. If, nevertheless,
Myers appears to have turned aside from the idea, it is per
missible to conjecture that the cause lay deep down in
metaphysical preconceptions of his own. For in spite of his
admission of distinct selves or centres of consciousness within
the organism, there always seems to float before him the
conception of a Soul which should be the real unity of all
the rest in a higher sense than that of merely including them
ideally while really excluding them after the fashion of the
Leibnitzian monad.
I will not attempt to criticise this conception—which per
haps after all I have wrongly ascribed to him—further than
to say that I find it hard to reconcile with the attribution
of real existence to the subordinate psychical centres ; and
that if it is legitimate to apply it to relations between the
psychical centres within the organism, it is not easy to see
396 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [PART
why it should not be equally applicable to psychical existences
generally. I cannot help suspecting that the logical tendency
of this line of thought if followed out to the end would prove
to be in the direction of pantheism rather than of that
personal immortality for which Myers himself so strongly
craved.
This however is a subject which I must not pursue further.
Indeed I have already trespassed too long upon your patience,
and must now bring this address to a close. In the course
of it I have ventured to suggest three propositions for your
consideration. First, that direct telepathic action between
mind and mind is a phenomenon which we might reasonably
have anticipated on grounds independent of experience.
Secondly, that the comparative rarity of observed cases is
no proof that the action is not universal and continuous, as
the same grounds would lead us to expect. Thirdly, that
the human organism is poly-psychic, and that telepathy
probably plays an important part in the relations between
the controlling self or soul, and the other psychical centres
associated with it.
I put forward these suggestions in no dogmatic spirit, but
tentatively ; yet with some hope that they may not be deemed
wholly without interest or value. In the dark and mysterious
region with which the researches of our Society are concerned,
we must expect to grope our way in many directions before
the right one is found. In such circumstances it is possible
to be too chary in framing hypotheses as well as too rash,
always provided we are resolved that they shall be our
servants and not our masters. Even a faulty hypothesis is
not necessarily worthless ; for experience shows that it is
ever out of the fragments of discarded hypotheses that the
roadway to truth is ultimately built.

SUPPLEMENT.
L
MR. PETROVO-SOLOVOVO ON SPIRITISM.
BY WALTER LEAF, Litt.D.
OUR Hon. Secretary for Russia, Mr. M. Petrovo-Solovovo, of St.
Petersburg, published last year a translation into Russian of Mr
Podmore's Modern Spiritualism; and he has now added to this
work a valuable " appendix." In so describing it, however, Mr.
Solovovo is too modest. The " appendix " is a solid and original
piece of original work, of no less than 237 large and closely
printed pages—in fact, an independent book, separately published,
and clearly demanding to be treated as such. I propose to give
rather a precis than a review of the work, allowing Mr. Solovovo
as far as possible to speak for himself, especially in the purely
critical part ; for criticism of criticism of criticism is not as a rule
profitable or entertaining. I will therefore only state that I consider
Mr. Solovovo's judgments always temperate and acute, well worthy
the attention of all enquirers, but I must not be taken as always
agreeing with them.
The work consists of two parts—firstly, a criticism of Mr.
Podmore's methods (81 pages) ; secondly, a historical sketch in six
chapters of the spiritist movement in Russia (153 pages). I propose
to deal chiefly with the former, as of more immediate interest to
English readers.
Mr. Solovovo in his brief preface points out a decided change in
his views on many points since he published in 1900 his Scientific
Investigation of Physical Phenomena with Mediums^—a change in the
direction of scepticism, so that the present work must be taken
as a corrective of the former. His position lies midway between
the spiritists and the sceptics, and he expects to incur the dis
pleasure of both.
1See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 416-422.
398 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART
He agrees with Mr. Podmore, generally speaking, in the following
views : (1) the worthlessness of the large majority of reports of
" physical phenomena " as evidence for a new force ; (2) the unsatis
factory conditions under which observations have generally to be made,
with special reference to the difficulties of uninterrupted attention ;
(3) the generally low level of spiritists as scientific observers—their
neglect of obvious means of fraud, their credulous confidence in
mediums, etc. ; (4) the somewhat suspicious character of the
" Rochester " phenomena, which started the modern spiritist move
ment—though it must not be forgotten that many similar phenomena
had been recorded long before 1848, apparently with the exception
of automatic writing.
Mr. Podmore also shows that the reality of the phenomena in
question involves the existence not of one but of several new forces
capable of acting on matter, whereby the probability of deception as
the sole and sufficient cause of the phenomena is enormously increased ;
though the a priori improbability does not relate to the existence
of several forces as much as to their union in a special class of
persons. It is curious that Mr. Podmore does not mention one argu
ment which would seem to support his position, namely, the diversity
of the conditions demanded for the production of the phenomena.
For instance most mediums require darkness. Home, on the other
hand, rarely if ever sat in complete darkness, and often in a very
satisfactory light. Some mediums (e.g. the Davenports) insist on
being bound, others (e.g. Eusapia) will not permit it. Darkness is
not a universal condition even of " materialisation."
But Mr. Podmore's criticism has its weak side, and after this general
expression of agreement we must pass to this. For instance, he
lays down a principle that in the course of years a witness allows
his imagination to colour and exaggerate an episode which at first
he regards as insignificant, and cites in support of this a supposed
growth in the Wesley correspondence of the vision of a badger,
reported to have been seen by Mrs. Wesley in 1717 but not related
at first hand by her till 1726. Does Mr. Podmore mean that Mrs.
Wesley merely accepted as her own in 1726 a phenomenon which
never existed at all ? Then what was the foundation of her
husband's and daughter's statements in 1717? Questions like this
Mr. Podmore does not seem fully to face; he too often leaves us
in the dark as to what he thinks to be the real conclusion to be
drawn. As a matter of fact lapse of time seems to produce very
different effects on different personalities. Mr. Solovovo testifies that
tn.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 399
in his own case the effect is not to exaggerate, but greatly to
diminish, the impressiveness of supposed " wonders " which he has
witnessed; and he considers that this may be as usual as the
contrary.
Mr. Podmore seems to be inconsistent also in his treatment of the
" supernormal " phenomena of " animal magnetism." He rejects the
theory of a "fluid" or "effluence," but cites without criticism
experiments by Esdaile and Elliotson, which seem to support the
theory. He appears to admit the possibility of clairvoyance at a
distance, and through at least one wall ; why then is he so sceptical
as to clairvoyance when it affects objects at only a short distance,
in a closed box or behind the clairvoyant's back ? The a priori
improbability appears much greater in the former case than the latter,
and the question is quite independent of another by which Mr.
Podmore seems to be guided—the question whether the clairvoyant
receives money or no. Generally speaking, Mr. Podmore's idea seems
to be that unpaid subjects may show any supernormal faculties ; may
see events passing 30 miles away, and state facts unknown to any
person present. But where a professional medium is concerned,
everything up to about 1880 must be put down to trickery. By
the later eighties, all is changed ; in Mrs. Piper, a paid medium,
Mr. Podmore admits all the faculties he denies to her predecessors.
It is true that Mrs. Piper is the spoilt child of the S.P.R. ; but
this hardly bears upon the point. " In saying this I have no wish
to defend any professional medium—it is likely enough that Mr.
Podmore's scepticism is well founded. But I should like to see more
logical consistency."
Dealing with raps, Mr. Podmore (Vol. I., p. 187) says, "if . . .
we could find in the whole literature of Spiritualism but one case
in which, in the presence of competent observers and under con
ditions well ascertained and fully described, the raps were actually
heard, when there was good cause for believing it impossible for
any person present to have made them, we should no doubt do well
to suspend our judgment, at any rate as regards that one case."
But Mr. Podmore passes by with absolute silence, among other
cases which cannot be thus ignored, the classic case of the raps
attested by Crookes with Mrs. Marshall—raps received on a specially
prepared membrane and producing a movement recorded by a
pointer on smoked paper.
Passing over various criticisms in detail of Mr. Podmore's way of
dealing with particular cases of physical phenomena, we may note
400 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART
Mr. Solovovo's opinion that sufficient attention has not been given to
Zollner's experiments, especially to the production of prints and
moulds of " materialized " hands and feet. Nor does Mr. Podmore,
when dealing with the production of knots in endless bands,
mention the most remarkable case,—knots made in two straps cut
out of soft leather, with sealed ends, lying under Zollner's hands,
where he distinctly felt a movement at a particular moment. At
the same time it must be admitted that the conditions are not
such as to force us to regard Zollner's experiments as convincing.
His firm belief in the " fourth dimension," his complete ignorance
of conjurors' methods, the proved omissions in his descriptions, and
finally the sorry reputation of Slade, must all detract from the
value of his evidence. Mr. Aksakoff, whose own experiments with
Slade were disenchanting, believed that Zbllner's success was due
mainly to himself ; that he was either a medium or was gifted with
a "catalytic" force which reacted on Slade.
After Davey's experiments, no reliance can be placed on Slade's
slate-writing; but there are cases where writing was produced with
tin- process full in view, and these are less easily to be disposed of.
Emmette Coleman attests one where a slate on which writing was
being produced under the table was gradually brought up by the
medium, Mrs. Francis ; the pencil continued to write for some,
moments under the eyes of the company. Coleman's testimony is
important, as he is well known for his exposure of various cheating
mediums. A somewhat similar instance is recorded by "Harry
Alis," a well known French journalist, in Dr. Gibier's Analyse ties
Choscs. But, after all, it must be said that Davey's experiments
have reduced the evidence for psychography almost to nil.
Mr. Solovovo agrees with Mr. Podmore that it is practically on D. D.
Home that the "to be or not to be" of spiritualism turns. While
giving full weight to Mr. Merrifield's unfavourable evidence (Journal
S.P.R., May, 1903), he holds that there are many phenomena of too
simple and definite a nature to be explained by conjuring or malobser-
vation—phenomena which can be accounted for on normal lines by
no hypothesis short of hallucination. He specifies the appearance
of spirit hands, attested by many good witnesses, notably Crookes;
und lays especial stress on various cases where these hands actually
molted away while firmly grasped by the sitters (which circumstance
Mr. Podmore does not mention at all). He remarks that this pheno
menon obviously suggests hallucination, and is surprised that Mr.
Pod more does not quote it in his chapter on hallucinations. This
LIi.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 401
explanation, however, is not so easy in view of the actual displacement
of solid objects by the spirit hands. Still less will it account for the
materialisation of an entire human body as described by Lady
Oookes (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. IX., pp. 309-10), and Lord Dunraven
(D. D. Home, His Life and Mission, p. 291).
Mr. Podmore's attempt to explain the behaviour of small objects
by the supposition that they were secretly attached to threads under
Home's control is difficult enough even when applied to the simpler
cases of objects lying on a sloping table ; it is quite hopeless as an
explanation of such complicated movements as are described by
Crookes in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 119-121. In the case of
the classical experiment with the beam and balance such a deceit is not
capable of absolute disproof, but we must remember that the well-
known conjuror, "Professor" Hoffmann, regarded this experiment as
particularly convincing (Jcurnal S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 120). Generally
speaking, Mr. Podmore would have been on safer ground had he
confined himself to general criticisms such as those of Lehmann in his
History of Superstition and Magic • as, for instance, that Crookes's earlier
reports are too meagre in their descriptions of surroundings ; that he
" evidently did not in 1871 suspect the importance of many details
which he omits to mention . and that in some cases he appears to
have been misled by the personal influence of " Katie King."
Mr. Podmore has still to leave such phenomena as levitation to his
chapter on Hallucinations ; though he seems to explain them rather
as illusions—mistaken interpretations upon a basis of fact. This
is a decided advance on the older theory of an "electro-biological"
influence exerted by the medium by which any hallucination could
be imposed upon his circle ; a theory which cut at the root of all
investigation not confirmed by photographic or similar automatic
evidence. But Mr. Podmore often leaves us in doubt as to his views
in particular cases. In one famous case Lord Adair, Lord Lindsay,
and Captain Wynne attested (1) that Home was in a certain room ;
(2) that he left it; (3) that he returned to it floating through the
window. Does Mr. Podmore think that Home never left the room,
but imposed a collective hallucination coverfng the whole phenomenon ?
Or that he left and returned by the door, and that the flight
through the window was a collective illusion ? Or has he some
alternative explanation) Any such supposition is difficult, and
Mr. Podmore should not leave us in such doubt. Passing to the
"fire ordeal," Mr. Solovovo proceeds to quote numerous cases from
Mrs. Home's D. D. Home, His Life and Mission, and The Gift of
402 Walter Leaf, LiM.D. [PART
D. D. Home, where it was not Home himself but his sitters who
remained unaffected by the action of the fire — which cases Mr.
Podmore apparently makes no mention of.
Mr. Solovovo, after objecting in various points of secondary import
ance to Mr. Podmore's criticism of the Stainton Moses phenomena,
passes on to Mrs. Piper. Here any difference of opinion with Mr.
Podmore ceases, and Mr. Solovovo gives his own criticism. He regrets
that all observers have not shown the same reserve as Mr. Podmore.
Hyslop's " monumental " report on his sittings is of little value ; the
author's colossal industry is coupled with an equally colossal simplicity
and unconscious preconception. Some of the devices by which he in
terprets "communications" so as to make them veridical are beyond
criticism ; one can only hold up one's hands in amazement. The
strange thing is that Hodgson himself seems to have been so com
pletely hypnotized by Mrs. Piper that he utters no protest against
Hyslop's methods.
Following Mrs. Sidgwick (Proceulings S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 16-38),
Mr. Solovovo lays stress on the many egregious blunders in the
communications as strong evidence against the spiritistic theory.
Surnames and dates are consistently avoided. Yet these are what
"spirits" should give to prove their identity, not trivial matters, such
as that Prof. Hyslop's father used to read the paper sitting in his
armchair before the fire, or that he carried a penknife with a yellow
handle in his waistcoat pocket, or that he wrote with a goose quill, or
wore a skull cap—all mixed up with similar details which did not
correspond with reality.
Even some of the most remarkable cases of Mrs. Piper's correct
ness are such as naturally lead us to nothing beyond mere co
incidence. Take, for instance, Prof. Lodge's evidence about " Uncle
Jerry." Some of the statements made by Uncle Jerry were (1)
that when a boy he and some others fell into the river; (2) that
one of his brothers killed a cat; (3) that he had a gun and once
got wet through while shooting ; (4) that he had a walking stick ;
(5) that he fought and beat a boy named Rodney, and that the
boy's father threatened to thrash him. In confirmation it appeared
that a third brother killed a cat (the details given were not con
firmed) ; that Uncle Jerry had a stick, but the description was
wrong; that he once fought a boy ("What an exceptional fact!"
Mr. Solovovo says), but the boy's name was not ascertained ; and that
he actually fell into the river. Surely such incidents are too
frequent in early life to allow us to attach any weight to them.
Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 403
We notice that we are rarely told if the medium held the sitter's
hand. Of course there is much which cannot be explained by
•"thought reading" «i la Bishop; but valuable indications may have
been obtained in this way, for instance, when the medium had to
•choose between affirmation and negation. It is particularly curious
that Hodgson's reports, usually so exact, are in this respect
•deficient.
Another fundamental difficulty is that too much reliance has to
be placed on Mrs. Piper's honesty. While fully admitting that she
•could not have carried out systematic enquiries as to her sitters,
And that the care taken in most cases to preserve their incognito
at a first sitting was conclusive for that sitting, we cannot but feel
that as soon as the identity of the sitter came out, as it did, for
instance, in Hyslop's series at the second sitting, there was such an
opening for collection of information as must compel us to take the
medium's honesty into consideration. For instance, her announcement
on May 4, 1895, of "John Hart's" death in Naples two days before
is valueless, unless we rely on her good faith as assurance that she
had not read of it on the 3rd, as she might have done, in the
Boston papers (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 353-7). On the
•other hand, there are many incidents, notably in the "G.P." series,
which cannot be explained as deception—unless at least we assume
•collusion on the part of others ; but these have to be set off
Against others where under completely similar conditions similar
assertions (e.g. as to what was being done at the time by persons
At a distance) were wholly incorrect.
What, we must ask,1 would be the position of the S.P.R., or of
ite leading members, if Mrs. Piper should ever be convicted of
fraud, such, for instance, as obtaining previous information regarding
a sitter, and producing it as a spirit communication ? The rule of
the Society has always been in such a case to reject the whole
evidence of the fraudulent medium without exception. While such
a possibility exists, even in theory, the entire fabric of these
trance communications must be regarded as hanging on a thread.
If we follow Mr. Podmore in supposing none the less that Mrs.
Piper sometimes displays supernormal powers in trance, we do so
firimarily on two grounds. The first of these is the character and
known ability of the investigators who have been convinced by
her—some of them having shown conspicuous ability in detecting
1 In thia and the three following paragraphs it will be understood that Mr.
Solovovo is speaking in his own words, somewhat abbreviated.
2D
404 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART
fraud. And secondly, we must give due weight to the repeated
assurances found in the records, that the evidence most convincing
to the sitters was too personal for publication. It is regrettable,
and it might be thought unjustifiable, that so much evidence of this
sort should have been suppressed by sitters favoured with it, but
it must be added that a strong impression is produced by such
episodes as that between "G.P." and Mr. Howard, related by
Hodgson in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 321-2.
Our conclusion is that in the mass of data with regard to Mrs.
Piper, some must be referred to a " supernormal " power ; but that
these are drowned in an ocean of insignificant and often silly
rubbish; and that the importance of her trance utterances and
writings is enormously exaggerated by her ardent followers. Then
there is still another objection. In the case of Adele Maginot
Mr. Podmore shows convincingly that her errors in messages pur
porting to come from the living prevent us from believing that any
reliance can be placed on those purporting to come from the dead ;
we need only a single hypothesis to explain all. But in the pre
cisely analogous case of Mrs. Piper we are called upon to assume
several inconsistent hypotheses. At one time she must speak or
write under the influence of the "departed"; at another time her
utterances will represent the thoughts of her sitter; in the vast
majority of cases we have to deal only with the products of
her own brain, working under abnormal conditions. What chaos !
What complication of the problem is introduced by this supposed
multiplicity of causes !
Yet such is our conviction of the hopelessness of a priori con
siderations in a region where experiment must have the last word,
that we do not attribute any decisive importance in the negative
sense to this last consideration. We will even say that in the
literature of spiritism there are to be found facts undoubtedly
pointing to the activity of independent intelligences. But this can
only be proved by incontrovertible evidence ; no approximate proof
can convince. Such evidence might be supplied by the communica
tion after death of the contents of a sealed letter written for the
purpose during life ; but an attempt by the S.P.R. to obtain this
has, it is known, completely failed. One such failure proves
nothing; but if the experiment should be often repeated and
never succeed, it would be difficult to avoid a decision definitely
unfavourable to the spiritist claim.
LII.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 405
With the latter part of Mr. Solovovo's book, "Sketches from the
History of Spiritism in Russia," I must deal very briefly.
The first chapter deals with a controversy carried on in the
monthly reviews of St. Petersburg and Moscow in 1875 and 1876.
It was opened by Professor Wagner, who had been induced by his
friend Professor Butleroff, already a spiritualist, to attend some
seances with D. D. Home, whose physical phenomena completely
convinced him. Then he followed up with equally convincing
materialisation stances with Bre"dif, a French medium, and published
his results in the Vyestnik Evropy (Messenger of Europe). The
article, in virtue of its author's reputation, produced a sensation,
and called forth replies in other reviews from persons of more or
less authority. Professor Wagner replied with a preliminary account
of American spiritualism—Katie King, the Eddys, Olcott, etc.—and
a development of his general theory. Professor Butleroff, an
eminent chemist, joined in the fray, and gave an account of the
experiments, extending over some years, which had made him a
spiritualist. The most important of these were carried on in the
family of his relative, Mr. A. K. Aksakoff, whose wife acted as
medium. The whole story was a remarkable one, as coming from
a man of such scientific eminence. With an equally elaborate and
unfinished reply from Prof. Shklyarevski the controversy dropped.
The arguments brought forward by the disputants need not
concern us; but the interest aroused led to the appointment by the
Physical Society of the St. Petersburg University, on the proposition
of no less a person than Prof. Mendelyeff, of a Committee to enquire
into the asserted facts, and report which of the phenomena were to
be referred to known natural laws, which to hallucination, which
to fraud ; and whether there were any which involved unrecognized
laws of nature. Mendel^eff himself was a member. The Committee
put themselves in communication with Messrs. Butleroff, Wagner
and Aksakoff, the latter of whom came to England to find mediums—
none were obtainable in Russia. He brought the brothers Petty
from Newcastle, but no success was obtained in a series of sittings
at the end of 1875, and they made an unfavourable impression.
At sittings with Mrs. Marshall (" Clayer ") in January 1876 raps
were obtained and the table was lifted from the floor; but the
Committee had grounds for suspecting fraud, and demanded tests
which were refused. Ultimately Messrs. Aksakoff, Wagner and
Butleroff withdrew from co-operation, and the Committee decided
to close the enquiry, publishing in March 1876 a report entirely
406 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART
unfavourable to the claims of spiritism. Mendele"eff followed this
up with a bulky volume, attacking spiritists in general and Aksakoff
in particular. Aksakoff retorted in another book, and we are not
surprised to hear from Mr. Solovovo that the controversy became
mainly personal, the real issues being lost in a cloud of recrimina
tion. Doubtless the scientific men were prejudiced and hasty in
their generalisations from too few experiments, the spiritists were
impatient of the necessary tests. That is the usual course of things.
Mr. Solovovo's next chapter contains a full sketch of Mr. AksakofTs
life, which, as members of the S.P.R. know, was ungrudgingly given
to spiritist enquiry. We may the less reluctantly pass over this
as an obituary notice of Mr. Aksakoff from the same pen appeared
in our Journal, Vol. XI.
The accounts of Professor Butleroff and Professor Wagner, and of
their work on psychical phenomena after 1876 are both well done,
but too long for reproduction here. It should be mentioned that some
extracts given by Mr. Solovovo from Prof. Wagner's account of his
experiments do certainly show that these experiments might have
been carried out in a more scientific temper—to put it very mildly.
There follows an account of the Russian Society for Experimental
Psychology, founded in 1891, with Prof. Wagner as president. It
is interesting to hear that "the Society was from the first confined
within very narrow limits by the Medical Council of the Ministry
for Home Affairs." The Medical Council narrowed the original
constitution of the Society, "closing the meetings to the public, and
in a special minute extending this prohibition even to subjects for
experiment." The Society began with an enquiry into a case of
clairvoyance brought before them by Dr. Khovrin of Tamboff, who
stated that one of his hospital patients had shewn power of reading
closed letters. The Society sent a letter, drawn by lot from nine,
written by different members, so that no one knew the contents.
The letter was placed in an envelope, secured against opening by
ingenious test provisions. The medium ultimately gave the exact
contents of the letter, but the conditions were not absolutely con
vincing, and the Society only decided that clairvoyance was
extremely probable, and that further tests were very desirable.
These, however, could not for various reasons be carried out.
lu 1893 a series of stances were held with a medium named
Nikolaeff. The minutes of the sitting of April 27 tell a story
which, as Mr. Solovovo justly says, can hardly be paralleled even
by Home's manifestations. The medium was first entirely stripped,
LII.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 407
and dressed in a garment provided by the observers, which con
tained nothing white of any kind. He was put into a chair in a
side room behind a portiere (both rooms being first thoroughly
searched) in front of which the observers sat, armed with opera
glasses for better vision. The room was lighted by an electric
lamp under a shade ; the medium could be well seen, his features
and the position of his fingers being visible as soon as the portiere
was drawn back. Under these circumstances luminous clouds were
seen beside him, gradually becoming more definite, to an accom
paniment of noisy blows on furniture in all parts of the room.
As the blows became weaker the luminosity formed itself into a
hand which moved in various directions, passing behind his chair
to the wall, on which it made a loud and rapid knocking. The
sounds of another invisible hand were heard at the same time
in another part of the room. Presently another luminous hand
appeared in the air by the hanging lamp.
The medium now asked for a few minutes' interval. When the
curtain was again withdrawn, a luminous hand was again seen
close to the lamp, striking hard blows upon the glass shade. It
suddenly pulled off the silk fringe, and threw it through the
opening in the curtain with such force towards Dr. Leshchinsky
that he involuntarily ducked. Soon a second luminous hand'
appeared to the medium's left. Both appeared to proceed from the
medium's sides, being separated from his body by a small dark
space, his own hands being also visible. They moved to his head
and his toes, before him and behind, rapping on his chair and the
sofa. The blows on the sofa were heard three rooms off. At
times the hands extended further, and rapped on the floor, the
walls, the ceiling, and sideboard. Subsequently the right luminous
hand reached to a heavy settee and pushed it towards the spec
tators with a force and speed hardly attainable by an ordinary
man. At the same time the left hand went to the medium's chair
and moved it forward with the sleeping medium on it. After some
deafening clappings of the hands in the air, the stance closed.
The minutes are signed by six doctors, Fischer,1 Stepanoff,
1 Mr. Solovovo informs ua that of these six persons Dr. Elis^eff and Dr.
Kraevsky are now dead and that Messrs. Stepanoff and Leshchinsky failed
to answer letters of inquiry he sent them, Dr. Korchagin's address being
unknown to him. On the other hand, Mr. Solovovo interviewed Dr. Fischer
and obtained from him full confirmation. The account of the stance was, we
believe, drawn up by Dr. Eliseeff.
408 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [PART
Korchagin, Leshchinsky, Kraevsky, and Elisteff. It is difficult to
imagine any fraudulent means of producing such impressive pheno
mena as described ; criticism can hardly attack anything but the
good faith or intelligence of the witnesses, some of whom were
already convinced spiritualists. Nikolaeff never seems to have had
even approximately similar success on any other occasion, and after
a year or so of disappointing stances he disappeared from the scene.
Mr. Solovovo remarks that the Society never tried any experi
ments with Sambor, and failed to take advantage of Eusapia
Paladino's visit to St. Petersburg in 1898. In 1900 it was re
organized as the "Russian Society of Normal and Pathological
Psychology," and confined itself to purely orthodox research.
Mr. Solovovo's last chapter is devoted to " Sambor and one of
his rivals." For an account of Sambor himself reference may be
made to Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV., p. 418. He died in 1902.
Mr. Solovovo regards him as still an unsolved problem. He no
longer considers the "Zollner's knots" on closed loops of string or
leather as convincing ; nor does he lay much stress on the materiali
sation stances, of which he had no personal experience. He is,
hovVever, inclined to see importance in the repeated cases of " passage
of matter through matter," exemplified chiefly by the hanging of
chair backs over the arms of the medium and a spectator—on one
occasion on the arms of two spectators—while hands were being
held. He notes, however, that the phenomenon could not be obtained
when a string was passed through the sleeves of Sambor and his
two neighbours, and the ends held by other members of the circle ;
so that the importance of the phenomenon depends entirely on the
assertion of Sambor's neighbours that they had not let go his
hands. A curious case is quoted at length where writing and an
"apport" were obtained inside an iron vessel with a carefully riveted
lid ; but the evidential value of this is discounted by the fact that
the vessel was left for some weeks lying in a room to which
Sambor might have had access, and that the experiment failed when
repeated under better conditions. Mr. Solovovo sums up as follows :
" To me personally he was very sympathetic ; though rather devoid
of intelligence and culture, he produced on me the impression of an
essentially good man, not without a touch of cunning. An original
trait was his attitude towards spiritualists, at whom he pretty often
laughed. It must in fairness be added that he often complained of
his sceptical opponents for their excessive suspicion and exigence—
perhaps not always without foundation."
LII.] Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo on Spiritism. 4.09
Sambor's "rival," one Yau Guzik, a Pole, needs no particular
mention, as Mr. Solovovo regards his manifestations as exceedingly
suspicious, and he has been repeatedly detected in cheating. His
.case is instructive rather as shewing what kind of evidence can
satisfy spiritists. We can only take leave of Mr. Solovovo's book
with hearty thanks to its author for the conscientious and careful
collection of material which will be of value in the future, and for
Jthe transparent honesty and scientific sagacity of his criticism.

THE CASE OF SALLY BEAUCHAMP.1
BY W. M'DOUGALL, M.Sc., M.B.
In his book on The Dissociation of a Personality, Dr. Morton
Prince gives us a clearly written, detailed account of the
remarkable case of Miss Beauchamp, of which he has previously
published brief and incomplete descriptions.2 The case seems
to be in many ways the most extraordinary and, from the point
of view of the 8.P.R., if not also from every point of view,
the most important of all the cases of multiple personality that
have been carefully studied and described. A summary state
ment of the principal features of the case must precede
any discussion of it, though nothing short of the reading
of the whole book can give an adequate impression of its
very strange character and of the care and thoroughness with
which it has been studied by Dr. Prince. " Miss Beauchamp,
the subject of this study, is a person in whom several
personalities have become developed ; that is to say, she may
change her personality from time to time, often from hour
to hour, and with each change her character becomes trans
formed and her memories altered. In addition to the real,
original or normal self, the self that was born and which she
was intended by nature to be, she may be any one of three
different persons. I say three different, because, although making
use of the same body, each, nevertheless, has a distinctly
different character; a difference manifested by different trains

of thought, by different views, beliefs, ideals, and temperament,
and by different acquisitions, tastes, habits, experiences, and
memories. Each varies in these respects from the other two,
and from the original Miss B. Two of these personalities have
no knowledge of each other and of the third, excepting such
information as may be obtained by inference or second hand,
so that in the memory of each of these two there are blanks
which correspond to the times when the others are in the flesh.
Of a sudden one or other wakes up to find herself, she knows
not where, and ignorant of what she has said or done a moment
before. Ouly one of the three has knowledge (i.e. apparently
immediate knowledge) of the lives of the others, and this one
presents such a bizarre character, so far removed from the others
in individuality, that the transformation from one of the other
personalities to herself is one of the most striking and dramatic
features of the case. The personalities come and go in
kaleidoscopic succession, many changes often being made in the
course of twenty-four hours."
To these three abnormal phases or personalities Dr. Prince
gives the names B i., B in. (or Sally), and B iv. in the order
of their discovery, B n. being merely B i. in the hypnotic state.
When the patient first came under Dr. Prince's care she
was a serious, refined, and reserved college-student showing
neurasthenic symptoms, due apparently to the influence of a
series of moral shocks and of excessive study upon a constitution
congenitally somewhat unstable. This was the personality that
became known as B i., and which seems to have been dominant
for some years previous to this time, although a history of
occasional trance-like states of brief duration suggests that during
these years B i. may have occasionally been supplanted by B in.
or iv. or some other abnormal phase. Other remedies having
failed, treatment by hypnotic suggestion was undertaken. The
patient passed easily into a well-marked hypnosis of a not
unusual kind, in which she was passive, but could converse
intelligently and knew of her waking life, although on waking
she remembered nothing of the hypnotic period. Very soon,
however, traces of what proved to be a very different personality
appeared. This was Bin. or Sally, by far the most interesting
member of this strange group. At times during hypnosis the
patient spoke of the waking Miss B. as " she," and claimed to
be a different person, "Because 'she' does not know the same
412 W. M'Dougall. [PART
things that I do." Dr. Prince assures us that, being led to
suspect the development of an abnormal personality, he now
made every effort to suppress this tendency, but in vain. B m.
continued to alternate with B n. in the hypnotic periods, and
soon claimed the name Sally Beauchamp. Although B in.
seemed to know all about B i. and B n. (e.g. could remember
their conversation), they knew nothing of her, and were kept
in ignorance of her for some time, and eventually only learnt
•of her indirectly. " One of the most interesting features when
the change to B in. took place was the sudden alteration of
character, which was almost dramatic. It was amazing to see
the sad, anxious, passive B n. suddenly become transformed
into a new personality, stuttering abominably, and exhibiting a
lively vivacity, boldness, and saucy deviltry, difficult to describe.
No longer sad, but gay and reckless, she resented any attempt
to control her." B in. soon began to provide indications that
she continued to have a conscious existence while B i. was
dominant. It has already been said that B in. shewed extensive
knowledge of B i.'s life and thoughts, and now sometimes Bi.
executed certain actions quite involuntarily, e.g. threw down
the book she was reading, much to her own annoyance, and
B in. claimed to have produced these actions, because Dr.
Prince had told her that B i. must not read too much. (p. 37.)
"It is worth while noting how sharply differentiated were the
volitions of the two personalities at this early date. Later, I
personally witnessed similar phenomena on numerous occasions."
This, in fact, was an early stage of a prolonged struggle for
mastery between the two personalities B i. and B in. " From
almost the very first her (B ni.'s) language implied a concomitant
existence for herself, a double mental life for Miss Beauchamp.
She always spoke as if she had her own thoughts and perceptions
and will during the time while Miss Beauchamp was in existence."
B in., i.e. Sally, being questioned as to her knowledge of what
B i. had read, " her answer implied co-existence and parallelism
of thought, for she explained certain lapses of knowledge by
asserting that ordinarily, as she herself was not fond of books, she
did not pay attention while Miss B. was reading; but that when
she did so, which was only when interested, she could understand
and remember the text; that she liked different books from
B i. liked, and that she understood some things B i. did
and vice versa."
•, and vtce vet

It became apparent also that while B i. had good command of
the French language and of shorthand, Sally knew neither.
(p. 47.) Nevertheless, Sally " claimed, in her own peculiar
language, to be always present as a subconsciousness." Dr.
Prince, who rejects as grossly fallacious the doctrine that an
independent subconsciousuess is a normal feature of human
personality, or that the hypnotic self usually persists as such a
subconsciousness during waking life, was very sceptical of the
truth of this claim of Sally's, but was soon compelled by over
whelmingly strong evidence to admit it. B i. began to be
troubled by an increasing variety of uncontrollable involuntary
impulses. Among other things she told lies, and talked dis
respectful nonsense to her friends, much to her own distress. A
series of experiments in crystal-gazing seemed to prove, " first, the
distinctiveness of the two co-existent conscious selves, as far at
least as concerns the separateness of the simultaneous perceptions ;
and second, the greater completeness of the memories of Sally
for a certain class of facts." (p. 85.)
About two months after Sally's appearance as a phase of
hypnotic personality and a sub- or co-consciousness, she made a
great step towards a fuller control of the organism. Both B n.
and Sally in hypnosis had frequently rubbed their eyes, and this
Sally declared was due to her efforts to get her eyes open, a thing
not hitherto allowed to either hypnotic phase. At last Sally
succeeded in rubbing and opening B i.'s eyes, whereupon " B i.
disappeared and ' Sally ' came, mistress of herself, and, for the
first time, able to see." (p. 95.)
From this time on Sally frequently had possession of the whole
organism for considerable periods, during which B i. seemed to
be entirely unconscious, and she began to play all sorts of tricks
for the annoyance of B i. when she should have her turn of
conscious life, among other things writing abusive letters to B i . ,
and leaving them to be found and read by her on returning to
consciousness. In this way B i . learnt of the existence of Sally,
and concluded she was possessed of devils.
When B i. was fatigued and in poor health Sally dominated
and excluded her frequently, and the better B i.'s health the
more difficult did Sally find it to get the upper hand,—she felt
herself "squeezed," as she said, and for periods of some months
of exceptionally good health B i. was free from Sally's interven
tions. But on the whole Sally gained upon B i., and succeeded
414 W. M'Dougatt. [PART
in supplanting B i. in the control of the body with increasing
frequency. During one period B i. fell into a delirium, and then
Sally alternated with her at short intervals, appearing perfectly
sane. This was but one instance of the fact that Sally's health
and spirits were always much better than B i.'s. Sally, in fact,
did not know fatigue and lassitude, so frequent with B i.
This absence of all fatigue in Sally must be connected with the
fact that she, i.e. the patient, during the periods of Sally's
dominance had " a peculiar form of anaesthesia. With her eyes
closed she can feel nothing. The tactile, pain, thermic, and
muscular senses are involved. You may stroke, prick, or burn
any part of her skin, and she does not feel it. You may place a
limb in any posture without her being able to recognise the
position which has been assumed. But let her open her eyes
and look at what you are doing, let her join the visual sense
with the tactile or other senses, and the lost sensations at once
return. . . . The same is true of auditory perceptions. If Sally
hears a sound associated with an object, she can feel the object."
" Sensation may also be restored by suggestion. But the restora
tion is only temporary, lasting for a few hours or for the day."
" Sally's anaesthesia extends to the somatic feelings. She is
never hungry or thirsty." (p. 149.)
After about a year of this sort of life appeared a third
distinct personality, B iv., " who seemed quite as much a real
person as did the Miss Beauchamp whom we all knew (i.e.
B i.)." B iv. knew nothing of recent events in the patient's
life, nothing of B i. and of Sally, and did not recognise
Dr. Prince or other friends of the patient. She seemed a
normally intelligent person suddenly set among scenes and
persons hitherto unknown to her. She soon set herself to find
out all she could of her environment, concealing her ignorance
as far as possible with considerable skill. In character and
temperament she was quite unlike both B i. and Sally, being less
reserved than Bi., and far more combative and determined, and
having nothing of Sally's childish and impish delight in fun, in
breaches of decorum, and practical jokes. B iv. now alternated
frequently with B i. and Sally. Sally's relation to B iv. was
curiously different from her relation to B i. Sally was aware not
only of all Bi.'s actions, but also apparently of all her thoughts
and emotions; but as regards B iv., Sally knew only her actions,
and nothing directly of her conscious states, but like any other
Lli.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 415
•constant spectator, could infer much of B iv.'s mental processes
from her actions and expressions.
As B iv. began to realise her strange relations to B i. and to
Sally, she conceived a violent dislike of Sally, which was recipro
cated, and for B i. she had contemptuous indifference. Unlike
Sally, B iv. shared most of B i.'s accomplishments, e.g. a knowledge
of the French language. Dr. Prince was soon able to discover
that B iv.'s memory was a blank as regards the life of the patient
during the six years preceding her appearance, a period initiated
by a moral shock. Events antecedent to that incident she
remembered in normal fashion. The amnesia was, however, not
•quite complete. B iv. had momentary dream-like memories of
incidents in the life of B i., and by inducing her to fix her mind
upon these visions and to describe them Dr. Prince was able
to obtain an account of the episodes that seemed to have been
the immediate cause of the patient's strange condition, and to
arrive at the following conclusions : ' ' Putting together all the
facts thus far learned which bear upon the development of B i.
and B iv., we are able to make the following historical summary,
for which the evidence is conclusive : Miss Beauchamp was distinct
as a unity, a single consciousness, up to the summer of 1893.
At that time there occurred a psychical catastrophe, which pro
duced a disintegration of consciousness, by which her personality
•changed and she developed into B i. B i. retained all the
memories of her youth, as well as of the accident which led to
her development ; and also, of course, of her whole life (that is,
•exclusive of Sally's entrances) during the six years succeeding
the accident of 1893, that is, up to June 7, 1899. She also
retained a memory of those periodical times when she had been
in existence since the latter date. She differs from her original
state in certain bodily characteristics known as neurasthenia, and
in certain mental characteristics —instability and suggestibility—
and, above all, in certain alterations of character. B i. therefore
remained the sole personality in existence for six years—to June 7,
1899—when owing to some cause thus far unknown, a hitherto
unobserved personality was awakened, which in associations of
memory reverted to a past period of life, namely, that which
antedated and ended with the aforesaid catastrophe of 1893."
" This personality (B iv.) apparently belonged to that earlier
period, and remembered the events of her life up to a certain
namely, that just preceding the incident which caused the
416 W. M'Dougatt. [PART
psychical shock, at which time her memory ceased. From that
eventful moment this new personality had absolutely no memory
of anything that occurred during the following six years, ending
June 7, 1899. Since this last date she knows and remembers
only the events that have happened during those interrupted
periods when she herself has been in existence. Since her appear
ance she has been constantly alternating with B i. and with
Bm." (p. 224.)
It is to be noted that in this passage Dr. Prince ignores the
evidence of Sally's (B ni.'s) existence before she made herself
known to him, and writes only of B i. and B iv.
The further discovery was shortly made that the appearance
of B iv. was due to a communication to B i., which strongly
revived the memory of the event of six years ago with all its
agitating emotions. Dr. Prince then set himself to find out
whether B iv. could properly be regarded as the original Miss
B., and for some time was strongly of that opinion, and there
fore did all he could to suppress Sally and B i., but without
success, although the situation was explained fully to Biv.,
and her co-operation invited and willingly given. The next
important step was the discovery that B iv. hypnotised seemed
in all respects identical with B i. hypnotised ; either one on
being hypnotised remembered all the experiences of both,
and spoke of both as "I" and "myself." This hypnotic
phase common to B i. and B iv. was henceforth known as B n.
B n. had no direct knowledge of, or memory of, Sally's experi
ence. An attempt was made to waken up B n., and make her
retain in the waking state the character and complete memory
(save for the Sally periods) of B n. The attempt failed
repeatedly, for B n. on awaking became B iv. Then began a
contest for predominance between B iv. and Sally, B iv. being
determined to suppress Sally, and Sally resisting with all her
resources. They exchanged quarrelsome notes, and Sally seemed
to be able partially to control B iv.'s movements, either forcing
"automatic" movement, such as writing, or suppressing her
voluntary movements, as when she made her dumb (p. 284) : she
also produced certain forms of systematised anaesthesia and of
hallucination, and seems actually to have hypnotised B iv. by
writing her a note suggesting sleep. (p. 320.)
Next it was found that B i. and B iv. seemed to become one
in sleep, for both remembered the same dreams; and further.
LH.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 417
that Sally seemed to be awake while B i. and B iv. slept, and to
be directly aware of their dreams.
Sally was now induced to write her autobiography, and pro
duced a most interesting document, partly written while she
herself was in control or possession of the body, partly by way
of automatic writing while B iv. was in possession.
Repeated attempts to give permanence to B u., who seemed
to be a synthesis of B i. and B iv., were frustrated by the active
opposition of both B iv. and Sally,—by B iv. because she disliked
and despised the meek character of B i., by Sally because she felt
that the success of this operation would mean that she would be
suppressed or permanently " squeezed," as she described her state
when incapable of securing control of the body and banishing her
rivals. -, .. ,.
For two yeard the patient continued this strange existence
without any important new development. Then somehow, in a way
which is apparently not understood by Dr. Prince, but is briefly
described as an ingenious artifice (p. 436), Sally became aware of
B iv.'s thoughts and feelings much as she had always known
B i.'s, and now carried on her contest with B iv. at a greater
advantage. Being aware of B iv.'s determination to suppress her,
Sally countered her efforts by inducing in B iv. terrifying
hallucinations, and by a great variety of annoying tricks, going
so far as to scratch and bruise severely their common body.
(p. 456.) In this way B iv.'s resolution was broken down by
Sally and her plans frustrated. But Sally herself was now
somewhat discouraged and depressed, and in this mood accepted
B iv.'s proposal of a modus vivendi. Their plan was to set out
on a holiday trip to Europe and to remain there, each agreeing
to allow the other control of the body for half the time, and to
suppress B i. completely. Their plan was discovered and frus
trated by Dr. Prince.
After some more months of troubled existence, a restoration
of the normal Miss B. seems to have been effected by wakening
B n., the hypnotised state of B i. and B iv. which combined the
memories and characteristics of both B i. and B iv. Dr. Prince
had often before attempted to bring about this result by wakening
B n., but always without success, and the ultimate success seems
to have been due to Sally, for it was not achieved until she had
confessed that it was she who had prevented the success of the
earlier attempts, and had promised not to interfere any longer.
It is not made clear that Sally had any new motive for this more
418 W. M'Dougatt. [PART
accommodating behaviour, and one is left with the impression
that she had grown a little tired of her games. Whatever this
new attitude of Sally may have been due to, it seems to have
rendered possible the desired result. B n. on being wakened
appeared as a normal person, who in character was a fusion of
B i. and B iv., and consequently superior to both, who remem
bered the experiences of both B i. and B iv., as also the patient's
life of the period previous to the disintegrating shock, and who
seemed to enjoy much better health than either B i. or B iv.
This personality Dr. Prince regards as the real Miss Beauchamp.
She has suffered a few relapses into B i., B iv., and Bin., but
has remained continuously unchanged for periods as long as six
months. Sally in these periods gives no sign of her existence ;
to use her own expression, she seems to have gone back whence
she came !
Although this brief summary necessarily omits many interesting
features of this strange case, enough has been said to shew that
it surpasses all previously recorded cases in many respects. So
strange and wildly improbable does the story seem, that any one
may well hesitate to accept it, and indeed it would be incredible
were it not that in recent years similar, though less extreme,
•cases have been reported by a number of independent observers,
whose care, capacity, and good faith are above suspicion. These
analogous cases, taken in conjunction with the author's high
standing in his profession and with the internal evidence of his
strictly scientific attitude, his caution, patience, sincerity, and
deep interest in the case, warrant us in accepting the facts as
•observed and reported by him. Dr. Prince does not give us in
this volume a full discussion of the theoretical interpretation of
this case, but promises to do so in a later volume, and since his
•earlier work on The Nature of Mind and Human Automatism
shews him to be well qualified for the task, this supplementary
volume should be one of great interest. In the meantime I am
bidden to discuss it, and, summoning all my resolution, proceed
to make the attempt.
In face of this strange case, it is necessary to admit fully our
complete ignorance of the conditions of psychical individuality.
The field is completely open to speculation. Hitherto neither
science nor philosophy has been able to establish any certain
conclusions.
If for the moment we put aside Sally, the case appears com
The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 419
paratively simple, and comparable in almost all important respects
to several other well-known cases, namely, the cases of Mr. Hanna,
of Ansel Bourne, of Mary Reynolds, of Leonie B., Felida X.,
and others. It appears to be a case of disintegration of a person
ality, or psychical individual, into two alternating personalities,
each of which is conscious and controls the body for a period
during which the other seems to have a merely potential existence.
This view, that alternating personalities are the products of the
disintegration of the normal personality, is very generally accepted.
Some authors, e.g. Prof. Pierre Janet, are content to state the
view in terms of psychical process only ; they assume that any
state -of consciousness of a normal person is literally a synthesis
of a great number of elementary psychical elements or entities,
sensations, images, and feelings, and that in these abnormal states
these become synthesised in two (or more) groups or complex
systems instead of one. This does not constitute in any sense an
•explanation of these cases; it is merely a hypothetical descrip
tion. For any explanatory hypothesis must set out from some
definite view or assumption as to the conditions of unity of the
consciousness of the normal individual.
In respect to this great problem there are two, and strictly
speaking, only two rival views. (1) The one assumes that struc
tural and functional continuity of the elements of the brain is the
condition of the unity of consciousness or of the psychical
individuality of normal persons. This is the assumption explicitly
made by many modern authors, most clearly and explicitly
perhaps by Ed. von Hartmann, the philosopher of the Uncon
scious, and by G. T. Fechner, the father of psycho-physics, and
implicitly by many others. All who accept materialism or the
•epiphenomenalism of Huxley and Tyndall, or the doctrine of
psycho-physical parallelism, or the dual-aspect theory of mind
and body, including H. Spencer, Bain, Stout, Paulsen, Miinster-
berg, Wundt, Ebbinghaus, and the majority of psychologists of
the present time,—all, in fact, who adopt one or other form of
the monistic view of mind and body are logically committed to
this assumption.
(2) The other doctrine, radically opposed to the former, is dual-
istic and maintains that whatever view we may take of matter, even
if we regard it as essentially of the same nature as mind, we must
assume that each normal human mind or personality results from
the functional association of, and interaction between, the body
2E
420 W. M'Dougatt. [PART
and a unitary psychic being, the ego or soul, or psyche, and
that the latter is the ground of psychical individuality, of the
unity of normal individual consciousness. This is not merely
a popular view, but has been maintained in recent years by a
number of psychologists of the first rank, e.g. by Lotze, Ward,
Bradley, Stumpf, Kiilpe and James. Unfortunately most of
those who adopt this view have been very reticent as to the
nature and the scope of the functions of the psychic being.
Two principal varieties of this view may be distinguished.
According to the one, all that we mean by memory or retention
of experience and knowledge, is conditioned by the persistence
in the nervous system of modifications of its structure, induced
during each experience that leaves its mark upon the mind.
Our conscious mental life is then, according to this view, the
reaction of the psychic being upon the brain processes, according
to its own nature and faculties ; but the constitution of the nervous
system and sense organs, and the processes excited in them,
determine the character of the content of consciousness, and
provide the occasions for the exercise by the psychic being of its
intrinsic powers, powers of feeling, of judgment, of reasoning, of
volition. 'This form of the dualistic doctrine thus separates the
forms of mental activity from the content of the mind, the systems
of ideas and beliefs acquired through experience, assigning the
former to the psychic being, the latter to the nervous system.
According to the other form of the dualistic doctrine, it 'is the
psychic being that retains those impressions in virtue of which
each experience plays its part in determining future experience,
or, in more popular language, the psychic being is regarded as
capable of memory independently of traces left in the nervous
system. This view, then, ascribes both form and content of mental
process to the psychic being, and regards the nervous system as
merely an apparatus, through the mediation of which the things of
the physical world are enabled to act upon the psychic being, and
through which the psychic being in turn is able to act upon them,
—as a merely receptive and executive mechanism, in fact.
This latter view alone is compatible with any belief in the
continued existence of the personality after the death of the
body, using personality to mean the mental individual as
developed by his intercourse with his physical and social
environment. For the developed personality is the product
of a long process of growth, of accumulation of habit and
LIL] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 421
effects of experience of all kinds; and if the retention of these
effects is, or is dependent upon, persistent modifications of the
structure of the nervous system, this retention can persist only
so long as the nervous system is intact. The former variety of
the dualistic doctrine is therefore compatible only with a belief
in impersonal immortality.
Let us for convenience of discussion denote by the letter C
this last view of the relation of mind and body, let us denote
the other variety of the dualistic view by the letter B, and the
monistic view by the letter A, and further, let us call the kind
of psychic being assumed by the doctrine of B, the " psyche." and
that assumed by doctrine (7, the soul ; for the latter alone
corresponds to the conception of the soul generally entertained
and usually implied by the word.
Cases of multiple personality derive their great importance
from the fact that it seems probable they may throw light upon
this great problem, and in this respect the case under review is
second to none.
It must be admitted that in so far as cases of multiple person
ality are capable of being regarded as resulting from division
of the normal personality, they lend themselves readily to explana
tion in terms of the monistic hypothesis, A . We may suppose that
in such cases the elements of the nervous system, which normally
constitute a single functional group, have become divided into two
or more such groups, and that the functioning of each group is
then accompanied by its own stream of consciousness, a synthesis
of the elementary psychical processes accompanying the elementary
nervous processes of that group. This is the explanation of
these cases most generally accepted. There are cases which seem
clearly to involve this kind of functional splitting of the nervous
system and a corresponding splitting of the conscious personality.
These are the cases of hysterical anaesthesia so well studied by
Janet. There seems good reason to suppose that in these cases
certain sensori-motor areas of the brain (e.g. the area with which
an anaesthetic limb is directly connected by afferent and efferent
projection fibres), together with more or less of the regions
of higher function, become functionally dissociated from the rest of
the brain, and that the functioning of such a dissociated group
of nervous elements is accompanied by its independent stream
of consciousness.
Many of the anaesthesias and paralyses produced by hypnotic
suggestion fall readily into the same class.
422 . W. M'Dougall. [PART
But it is, I think, very doubtfully legitimate to extend this
kind of explanation to all cases of multiple personality and to
regard them all as of this one type. It is true that we seem
to be able to set all these cases in a series ranging from the
simple types of the kind just mentioned to the most complex, such
as Miss Beauchamp ; and it is this seeming ease with which they
may be thus arranged in a series of progressive complexity that
gives the extension of this type of explanation to all cases its
best claim for acceptance. It is, however, very possible that this
appearance is deceptive, and that we really have to deal with
cases of two radically different types, of which the simpler alone
fall under the above type of explanation, while for the explana
tion of the others some very different hypothesis must be found.
Still putting aside Sally, the case of Miss Beauchamp may fairly
be claimed as a case of multiple personality resulting from
division of the normal personality, and it is of the relatively
intelligible type in which the resultant personalities are alter
nately and never simultaneously conscious. There was a sharply
cut division of all mental content acquired after a given date
between the alternating personalities B i. and Biv., and yet
the mental content acquired before that date was common to
both of them. Further, they appear to have become eventually
recombined or synthesised, so that the two systems of mental
content, the two memory-continua, were fused to a single one.
That B i. and B iv. were the products of a division of the
personality of Miss B. we seem justified in believing. But if we
accept this view we are not thereby logically compelled to accept
doctrine A.
If we assume B to be the true doctrine, then we must believe
that there was a functional splitting of the patient's nervous
system, for the mental content was divided between B i. and
B iv., and we may suppose either that Miss B.'s " psyche " was
in interaction with the two parts of the nervous system alternately,
or that a second " psyche" entered into functional relations with
one part., while Miss B.'s " psyche " maintained its relations
with the other part. Of these alternatives the latter seems the
less improbable. If we are to discuss these strange cases with any
hope of profit, we must give rein to speculation, and, as was said
-u-—. there are no established facts that set certain limits to
•sis. Now if we accept doctrine B, it must be admitted that
c nothing of the conditions which determine the functional

association of any " psyche " with any nervous system. It may be
that, as Mr. H. G. Wells has suggested in one of his weird
stories, disembodied souls are crowding thickly about us, each
striving to occupy some nervous system and so to become restored
to a full life of sense and motion and human fellowship. Or it
may be that with each organism is associated an indefinitely
large number of psychic beings, each capable, on fitting oppor
tunity, of playing its part as the dominant ' ' psyche " in
interaction with the whole nervous system ; although, in the
case of the normally constituted brain, only one such can play
this part, while all the rest remain suppressed and latent, or
playing subordinate parts in association with subordinate nervous
centres. And we may suppose that, as soon as the brain
becomes functionally split, a second ' ' psyche " finds its oppor
tunity and has its faculties, its capacities for sensation, for
feeling, emotion, judgment and volition called into play by the
influence of that part of the nervous system which has fallen out
of touch with the originally dominant " psyche." It may be,
e.g., that the personality B iv. resulted from this kind of change,
that Miss B.'s original " psyche" was for a period of seven years
thrown out of touch with all those nervous dispositions that
became newly organised under the influence of "psyche" Biv.,
but was later brought into functional relation with these, with
the consequent exclusion of B iv., or its repression to its original
subordinate status and restricted activity. The extremely
different characters of Bi. and of B iv., and the determined
antagonism of B iv. to B i., the strong opposition of her will
to every attempt to restore B i. to her normal condition seem to
countenance this view.
On the other hand, if we regard, as apparently we must, this case
(Sally excluded) and other cases of multiple personality as cases of
divided personality, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
reconcile this view with doctrine C', and the conception of a soul in
thesfull sense of the words as the bearer of both form and content of
the mind, as being in itself the full personality independently of
any nervous system. This task was, of course, attempted by the
late F. W. H. Myers in his work on Human Personality, but, as I
have argued at length elsewhere,1 his attempt cannot be regarded as
so successful as to compel our acceptance of his doctrine or to
1 Mind, October, 1903, vol. xii.
424 W. M'VougaU. [PART
render unnecessary the search for a more satisfactory explanation,
and, as I shall point out below, Myers' doctrine gives us no help
when we attempt to solve the perplexing problem of Sally.
When we turn to consider the personality B in., or Sally,
our difficulties increase. Dr. Prince in many passages (e.g. p. 18,
p. 234) confidently assumes that Sally also is the product of the
division of the original Miss B., and that the restoration of the
normal personality involves the reabsorption or synthesis of Sally
with B i. and B iv. No doubt Dr. Prince will seek to justify
this view in the promised volume of theoretical discussions, but
the confidence with which he puts forward this opinion in the
present volume is difficult to understand or to justify. No
argument is adduced in favour of it, and no single fact recorded
implies (so far as I can see) that Sally arose by a splitting-off
from the original personality, or that she became reabsorbed or
synthesised with the personalities B i. and B iv. in the process
of restoration of Miss B. to her original self. The evidence,
in fact, points all the other way. If we may accept unreservedly
Dr. Prince's description of Sally, then I think we may say with
confidence that Sally was not merely a split-off part of Miss B . , and
that still less can she be accounted for by the monistic doctrine
A and the assumption that the nervous system of Miss B. became
dissociated to form three principal functional systems of elements.
That Sally was a personality capable of being fully conscious,
capable of ideas, of reasoning, of emotion and of strong volition
simultaneously with the conscious existence of B i. seems estab
lished by Dr. Prince's careful studies, and seems to be fully
accepted by Dr. Prince himself. Such a consciousness of a
hidden personality existing contemporaneously with that of
another personality which is in control of the bodily organs,
Dr. Prince calls a sub-consciousness, and this is, I think,
the most appropriate usage of this term which has been used
so loosely and with so many different meanings by different
authors. Sally claimed, and supported with strong evidence
the claim, that she had existed as a sub-consciousness (in
this sense of the word) from the earliest years of Miss
B.'s life; i.e. long before the date of the psychic shock which
changed Miss B. into B i. ; and there seems no good reason
to deny the validity of this claim, although, of course, the
evidence of Sally's existence as a personality during these early
years is less good than that for her continued existence
Hi.] The Case of Satty Beauchamp. 425
as a sub-consciousness in the period of Dr. Prince's observation
of the case.
Again, there is no evidence to shew that when B i. and B iv.
became synthesised to form the apparently normal Miss B. Sally
was in any sense or degree included in this synthesis ; the evidence
rather shews that she was not; the restored personality Miss B.
seems to have had no memory of Sally's experiences, as she had
of those of both B i. and B iv. (see pp. 272 and 525), and no direct
awareness of Sally's existence. Again, Sally cannot be regarded
as merely a group of ideas and memories dissociated from the
original personality, " some sort of a dissociated group of
conscious states," if only because of the fullness of her person
ality, the very distinctive and strong traits of character and
emotional disposition, her developed self-consciousness and strong
will, her acute intelligence and comprehensive memory. I would
refer the reader to the following passages for statements bearing
on the mental capacities of Sally (p. 238): "Sally became for
the moment serious and earnest, showing great intelligence and
perspicacity in her analysis of the psychological and other facts.
She discussed them with intelligence and interest, went over the
history of the past year, explained many facts which were obscure,
and recalled others which I had overlooked. Reference to my
notebook showed that Sally's memory was correct." Notice that
these correct memories were not merely evoked by appropriate
questioning by Dr. Prince, they were appositely and spontaneously
brought forward by Sally in order to bear out the comprehensive
scheme or ideal construction which she evolved to account for
the peculiarities of the case. On pp. 267, 268, again Sally is
revealed as keenly reasoning and reflecting upon the case, and
giving Dr. Prince valuable suggestions, often in long and care
fully reasoned letters, such as no child and no person not of more
than average intellectual power could produce. On p. 278 Sally's
description of her early life seems to shew her to have had a
separate mental life from the time that Miss B. learnt to walk,
with very different emotions and some scorn for the personality
controlling the body, to whom she felt herself superior in
energy of character. This is further borne out by Sally's auto
biography (chap. xxiii.), a very remarkable account of childish
experifiK-es, revealing an intelligence and memory which would
be exceptional in any autobiographical account by an adult of
the years of childhood. In fact, as regards fullness and
426 W. M'Dougall. [PART
accuracy of memory and voluntary and appropriate recollection,
Sally seems to have been superior to any normal individual, for
her memory comprised not only almost all the waking experiences
of the original Miss B. and of B i., and of her own periods of
dominance over the body, but also all B i.'s dream life and
her own periods of subconscious existence, and, later, B iv.'s
experiences also. As regards Sally's volition, many examples of
her determined and successful opposition to B i., B iv., and to
Dr. Prince might be quoted. (See especially pp. 284 and 285.)
She would render B i. or B iv. dumb, or force them while
dominant to speak, write, or act in ways quite opposed to their
intentions and wishes, and she seemed at times to be capable of
shifting the scenes almost at will, causing herself or one or other
of her rivals to control the body. It must be noted that these
effects exerted by Sally were by no means due to the working of
mere blind impulses, but in most cases were apparently truly
volitional, the outcome of well-reasoned, self-conscious delibera
tion in resolute pursuance of a well-conceived purpose. So acute
was Sally, and so well informed, so resolute in the pursuit of
her ends, that for more than two years she was able to defy and
bring to nought the combined efforts of Dr. Prince, Bi., and
B iv. to suppress her, and, as was said above, the eventual
restoration of Miss B. by the reunion of B i. and B iv. seems
to have become possible only because Sally, for some unknown
- reason, ceased to offer active opposition to Dr. Prince's efforts
to bring about this change. Beside all this evidence of the fullness
of Sally's mental life and of the independence and completeness of
her personality, we must put the following facts: (1) That B u.
(the hypnotic state of the complete Miss B. comprising B i. and
B iv.), while recognising both B i. and B iv. and herself as
essentially the same person, repudiated with horror the suggestion
that Sally might be identified in any way with herself, (p. 448.)
(2) That when B i. and B iv. became synthesised to form the
person whom Dr. Prince, seemingly with good reason, regards
as the real, original and complete Miss B., Sally continued to
exist as a subconsciousness, aware of all Miss B.'s thoughts; and
that this restored Miss B. could remember the events of all
periods save those in which Sally had controlled the body to
the exclusion of the other personalities, (p. 516.) The relation
of Sally to the personality regarded by Dr. Prince himself as
the complete Miss B. is thus different in every respect from the
LII.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 427
relation of B i. and B iv. to Miss B. For neither of these was
aware of or could remember Miss B.'s experiences, while she
remembers theirs. But we are told of Sally that when, after the
restoration of Miss B. she " appeared again as an alternating
personality, her language implied a persistent existence as a sub-
consciousness like that of her early youth, and as described in the
autobiography " (p. 524), i.e. she had become aware of and could
remember Miss B.'s experiences.
In face of all these facts it is, I think, impossible to agree
with Dr. Prince in regarding Sally as a group of states of
consciousness dissociated or split off from the normal personality.
Dr. Prince's own statements are incompatible with this view,
and further, they are inconsistent with one another, as when he
tells us that the synthesis of B i. and B iv. restored the complete
Miss B., and yet in other passages speaks of the production of
Sally by dissociation, and also of "the synthesising of B iv.'s
consciousness with that of the subconsciousness (Sally) " without,
however, offering us a particle of evidence that either one of
these latter processes ever took place.
Dr. Prince seems, in fact, to have set out with the conviction
that every case of multiple personality is to be regarded as
resulting from dissociation of a normal personality, and to have
allowed this prejudice to limit the range of his search for
hypotheses, and to blind him to the unmistakable implications
of his own descriptions. In short, to assert, as Dr. Prince does,
that Sally is a split-off fragment of Miss B. is to maintain that
the part may be greater than the whole.
If, then, Sally is not merely a fragment of Miss B., the product
of mental disintegration, she is not to be explained in terms of the
monistic doctrine A, for that doctrine can only give account of
multiple personalities resulting from disintegration. What, then,
is she? Can she be explained in terms of either form, B or C, of
the dualistic doctrine? We may state the alternatives more fully
thus : If one of the essential conditions of Sally's conscious life
is a psychic being or entity distinct from that of the normal
Miss B., must we ascribe both form and content of her mind
to this psychic being (doctrine C), or can we suppose that the
content of her mind (her systems of ideas and memories) is
determined by some part of Miss B.'s brain that has become
dissociated from the rest and entered into functional relations
with this second and superfluous psychic being ?
428 W. M'Dougall. [PART
The latter alternative seems hardly tenable, for two reasons
chiefly : (1) We can hardly suppose that there could be in Miss
B.'s brain sufficient nervous matter to serve as the physical basis
for the very full memories of Sally, in addition to those of B i .
and B iv., for since Sally can remember so much of Miss B.'s
experiences as well as B i.'s and her own, the content of her
mind must be regarded as at least as abundant as that of all
the other personalities together; the whole content of the mind
is as it were duplicated. If, then, the content of Sally's mind
has a physical basis in the brain of Miss B., that brain has to
serve as the physical basis for at least two minds fully furnished
with memories of all sorts. This would seem to imply that of
the brain of a normal individual but one-half the nervous
substance may be concerned in mental processes, the other half
lying dormant ; this implication, whether in the form that
one hemisphere alone normally functions or in any other form,
seems in the last degree improbable. For it is impossible to
understand how this great mass of extremely expensive, but
superfluous, nervous tissue could have been evolved as a normal
feature of the human brain. (2) More important perhaps is
the consideration of the peculiar relation of Sally to B i. and to
Miss B. Sally seems to have become aware of all B i.'s and
Miss B.'s perceptions, ideas, feelings in an immediate fashion.
But it was not that these states of consciousness were simply
duplicated, forming two similar and parallel streams. Sally was
aware of these states of Miss B.'s consciousness as Miss B.'s;
she did not regard them as her own, but knew them for Miss
B.'s ; she did not simply have the same perceptions, ideas, and
feelings as Miss B. or B i., but she knew of them in an intimate
fashion, and had her own thoughts and feelings and volitions in
regard to them. How was this knowledge acquired by, or con
veyed to, Sally ? There seems no alternative to the view
suggested by our President in his recent address to the Society,
namely, that the process is telepathic, i.e. an immediate influencing
of one mind by another, a telepathic communication between
Sally and B i. or Miss B.
There are three ways in which the telepathic communication
between separate persons may be conceived. (1) It may be a
purely physical interaction, an influence exerted by one brain
upon another through some physical medium. This is the
natural view for those who adopt doctrine A. (2) It may be
LII.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp. 429
a psycho-physical interaction, an influence directly exerted by
the brain of one person upon the psychic being of another. This
is the view of telepathy which would be naturally taken by those
who hold by doctrine B. If direct interaction between " psyche"
and body of each person is the rule, it must be admitted that
we know nothing of the conditions of the alliance of any " psyche "
with any body, and therefore nothing which necessitates the
assumption commonly made, that this psycho-physical interaction
is of an exclusive character. Why should not my brain, under
certain unknown favourable conditions, act upon your " psyche,''
or any other, as well as upon my own ? (3) The third view,
adopted by the President in his address, is that the telepathic
interaction is purely psychical, an immediate action of one soul
upon another. This is the view of telepathic action which is most
naturally taken by those who hold doctrine C'.
I submit that the relation of Sally to the other personalities
can only be explained by applying the telepathic hypothesis in
the third form distinguished above.
Adopting for the moment doctrine B and the second form of
the telepathic hypothesis, we may suppose that the neural
processes of the one brain affect the " psyche " of Sally as well as
that of Miss B., each responding according to its own nature.
But there are insuperable difficulties in the way of any such
attempt to explain Sally and Miss B. as two psychic beings having
in common one brain which is the physical basis of the memories
of both. If this were the case, all memories should be common
to both Sally and Miss B., but this is not so. Miss B. knows
nothing of Sally's experiences, and Sally seems to know only
those of Miss B. in which she takes an interest, e.g. she knows
nothing of Miss B.'s highly specialised learning, such as her com
mand of the French language. It would seem, in fact, that the
retained traces of Sally's experience, or her memory in the widest
sense of the word, is independent of Miss B.'s, and that she
becomes aware of Miss B.'s mental processes only through the
exertion of an attentive and selective activity. We seem driven
therefore to accept the third form of the telepathic hypothesis,
which implies immediate interaction between souls in the full
sense of the word, psychic beings whose constitutions determine
both form and content of the mind in so far as content is not
determined by present sensory impressions, but by past experi
ence, souls which are capable of retention independently of the
physical basis.
430 W. M'Dougall. [PART
My conclusion is, then, that if we accept Dr. Prince's description
of Sally Beauchamp, we can only account for her by adopting
that view of the relation of mind and body which I have called
in this review the C doctrine,—the view that the normal person
ality consists of body and soul in interaction, the soul being not
dependent upon the brain or other physical basis for its memory,
but having the faculty of retaining and remembering among its
other faculties. I confess that this conclusion, involving the
rejection of the physical basis of memory, is inconsistent with a
very large mass of evidence which I have hitherto considered as
almost, if not quite, proving the dependence of all memory
and, therefore, of all developed personality on the persistence of
the physical basis, of the physical changes produced in the brain
in the course of each moment of experience.1 This great mass of
evidence is not to be lightly set aside in view of any one case, but
if a number of cases of the type of Sally Beauchamp, as described
by Dr. Prince, were to be described by other equally careful and
credible observers, I think the weight of their testimony would
be irresistible. This conclusion would give very strong support
to the spiritistic explanation of such cases as Mrs. Piper, and
would go far to justify the belief in the survival of human
personality after the death of the body. It is for this reason
that Sally Beauchamp seems to me of so great interest to this
Society.
On summing up my discussion of this case, I am compelled
to admit the unsatisfactory character of my conclusions, for I
have argued that the disintegration of Miss B. into B i. and
B iv., and especially the restoration of Miss B. by the synthesis
of B i. and B iv. is incompatible with the dualistic doctrine in
the second form C, which assumes the soul in the full sense of
the word ; but on the other hand, I have argued that this
doctrine alone is adequate to account for Sally. It is, of course,
impossible to accept both these opposed doctrines, and one has
to recognise three possible flaws in the argument. (1) The
premises may be false, i.e. the facts of the case may have been
incorrectly reported. (2) The argument may have been illogically
conducted. (3) The conceptions used may have been hopelessly
inadequate to the realities. The third possibility, as in the case
1 1 believe that the great weight of this evidence is not appreciated by many
members of this Society. It was almost completely ignored by the author
of Human Permnalily.
MI.] The Case of Sally Beauchamp.
of most philosophical argument, probably represents the actual
state of affairs. Recognising this probability, one is bound to
look round for any other conception that has been formulated to
deal with facts of this order, and Myers' conception of the
subliminal self naturally claims consideration.
I will conclude, then, by asking—-Does Myers' doctrine of the
subliminal self help us to understand this case ? I cannot see
that it does. Myers' doctrine is, of course, a variety of the C
doctrine, the doctrine of the soul, not merely in the full sense
of the word, but in a greatly extended sense.
I take the essence of this doctrine to be that the soul has a far
richer store of faculties, memories, and ideas than it is capable of
manifesting in the mental processes of normal waking life, and
that the restricted character of these manifestations is due to the
imperfections of the nervous system. How can we apply this
•conception to explain the manifestation through the one body of
the two personalities, Miss B. and Sally, each having her full
•complement of faculties, memories, and ideas ? If we ascribe this
duality to the soul, we are assuming two souls, and that we can
do equally well without making the additional vast assumptions
of the doctrine of the " subliminal self." If we ascribe the duality
to the body, to a functional division of the nervous system, we
ascribe to it an importance and an extent of influence upon the
mental life which is compatible only with the monistic doctrine A,
and not at all with a thoroughgoing dualistic doctrine. For one
who holds by the conception of the soul in the full sense in which
it is implied by the doctrine of the subliminal self, to suppose that
the soul can simultaneously will in two opposed senses, because
its instrument, the nervous, is functionally divided, would be as
reasonable as to expect a man to be able to walk in two opposite
directions at one moment, because he has two legs. I venture
to think that the phrase "the subliminal self" may prove detri
mental to the efficiency of our Society if we do not steruly resist
the tendency to use it as a mere cloak for our ignorance whenever
we are confronted by the inexplicable events with which we have
to attempt to grapple. This remarkable case is just of that
baffling kind which tempts us to soothe our perplexities, " to lay
our intellects to rest on a pillow of obscure ideas," by the
utterance of that seductive phrase the "subliminal self."

REVIEWS.
Henry Sidyunck : a Memoir. By A. S. and E. M. S. (London :
Macmillan & -Co., Limited. New York : The Macmillan Company.
1906.)
This book is practically an autobiography : that is, it consists of
excerpts from diaries and letters, with just sufficient connective
tissue of narrative to bind the parts together. Following this
example, I have selected from the book passages of Sidgwick's own
writing to illustrate his attitude towards the problems with which
Psychical Research is concerned, his connection with the Society,
and the stage which he finally reached.
Henry Sidgwick was born on the 31st of May, 1838. He entered
Trinity College, Cambridge, in October, 1855, in his eighteenth
year, and, after a brilliant career as an undergraduate, he was
elected to a Fellowship and appointed Assistant Tutor four years
later, when a little over twenty-one years of age. At Cambridge
he remained, as tutor, lecturer or Professor, until his death in 1900.
Brought up as a member of the Church of England, it was some
years before Sidgwick definitely seceded from that faith. But the
deepest bent of his nature, as he says himself, was "towards the
life of thought—thought exercised on the central problems of human
life," and the leisure of the years which followed the taking of
his degree was largely devoted to philosophical and theological
enquiry. He began with a systematic study of the philosophy of
J. S. Mill, then at the height of his influence ; but soon found it
unsatisfying :
" The nature of his philosophy—the attitude it took up
towards the fundamental questions as to the nature of man
and his relation to God and the universe—was not such as to
encourage me to expect from philosophy decisive, positive answers
to these questions, and I was by no means then disposed to
LIL] Review. 433
acquiesce iu negative or agnostic answers. In fact I had not in
any way broken with the orthodox Christianity in which I had
been brought up, though I had become sceptical with regard to
many of its conclusions, and generally with regard to its methods
of proof. Thus for several years the time that I devoted to the
study of the questions of most serious concern was divided in
a fitful and varying way between philosophy and theology, my most
vital interest seeming to lie sometimes in the one study, sometimes
in the other."
Of his attitude towards Christianity in these early years he writes
in a letter to a nephew :
" As regards theology, those with whom I sympathised had no
close agreement in conclusions, their views varied from pure posi
tivism to the ' Neochristianity ' of the Essayists and Reviewers :
and my own opinions were for many years unsettled and widely
fluctuating. What was fixed and unalterable and accepted by us
all was the necessity and duty of examining the evidence for his
torical Christianity with strict scientific impartiality ; placing our
selves as far as possible outside traditional sentiments and opinions,
and endeavouring to weigh the pros and cans on all theological
questions as a duly instructed rational being from another planet
—or let us say from China—would naturally weigh them. . . ." 1
(p. 40).
With a view to acquiring more insight into the historical origins
of Christianity Sidgwick devoted his leisure for about three years to-
the study of Arabic and Hebrew, and made considerable progress in
both languages. Ultimately he abandoned these studies as involving
too much labour in proportion to any help likely to be derived
from them in solving the problems which he had set before him.
In 1869 he found himself so far removed from the standpoint of
orthodox Christianity that he resolved upon resigning his Fellow
ship. This of course was before the University Tests Act, at a
time when the tenure of a Fellowship carried with it the obligation
of accepting the formularies of the Church. This decisive step was
the outcome of a long mental struggle, extending over many years.
The resignation was not, however, a protest against Church doctrines
or an explicit declaration of agnosticism. Writing immediately after
the step had been taken to E. W. Benson, he says, " I do not, as
at present advised, intend to secede from the Church of England."
He adds that he had stated the case to Lightfoot, explaining that
lLife of Archbishop Benson, Vol. I., pp. '249, 250.
43* Frank Pod-more. [PART
" as far as sympathy and goodwill " went he did not wish to secede,
but that he could not accept the dogmatic obligations of the
Apostles' Creed ; and that Lightfoot had held that subscription to
the Creed was not obligatory on lay members of the Church. The
resignation was in fact intended as a vindication of his own honesty,
and a protest against the prevailing laxness, which allowed men to
regard subscription to the dogmas of the Church as a mere formality.
He writes shortly after the resignation to a friend :
"Personally, I feel no doubt that I have done right. For long
I have had no doubt except what arose from the fact that most
of the persons whose opinion I most regard think differently "
(p. 200). . . . "I feel very strongly the importance of 1 pro
viding things honest in the sight of all men.' It is surely a great
good that one's moral position should be one that simple-minded
people can understand. I happen to care very little what men in
general think of me individually : but I care very much about
what they think of human nature. I dread ' doing anything to
support the plausible suspicion that men in general, even those
who profess lofty aspirations, are secretly swayed by material
interests.
" After all, it is odd to be finding subtle reasons for an act of
mere honesty : but I am reduced to that by the refusal of my
friends to recognise it as such" (p. 201).
And to another friend at about the same date :
" Just now I am much depressed, with no particle of regret for
what I have done, but depressed at the thought of being so different
from my friends.
Why should a man desire iit any way
To vary from the kindly race of men?
There is nothing in me of prophet or apostle. The great vital,
productive, joy-giving qualities that I admire in others I cannot
attain to : I can only lay on the altar of humanity as an offering
this miserable bit of legal observance" (p. 199).
But he felt constantly the need of doing some practically useful
work in the world, and one characteristic effect of his resignation
and of the mental struggle which had preceded it was that he gave
a large part of his time and energies for many years after this
date to furthering the higher education of women—as a positive
offering to lay on " the altar of humanity."
But whilst Sidgwick was unable for his own part to find an
ill.] Review. 435
assured hope in the acceptance of the Christian faith, he was pro
foundly impressed with the importance of such a hope for the world
at large. Thus he writes in 1881, "In fact, the reason why I keep
strict silence now for many years with regard to theology is that,
while I cannot myself discover adequate rational basis for the
Christian hope of happy immortality, it seems to me that the
general loss of such a hope, from the minds of average human
beings as now constituted, would be an evil of which I cannot
pretend- to measure the extent. I am not prepared to say that
the dissolution of the existing social order would follow, but I
think the danger of such dissolution would be seriously increased,
and that the evil would certainly be very great" (p. 357). Again, in
1887 he writes, " Some fifteen years ago, when I was writing my
book on Ethics, I was inclined to hold with Kant that we must
postulate the continued existence of the soul, in order to effect that
harmony of Duty with Happiness which seemed to me indispensable
to rational moral life. At any rate I thought I might provisionally
postulate it, while setting out on the serious search for empirical
evidence" (p. 467).
But while he thus remained convinced of the importance, alike
for morality and for happiness, of the belief in a future life, as
years went on Sidgwick found less and less support for the belief
in either philosophy or religion. And already, leaving tradition and
intuition, he had set himself seriously, as indicated in the passage
last quoted, to search for empirical evidence of immortality. There
is a passage in a letter written to F. W. H. Myers in 1872 which
illustrates his attitude towards the problem :
"I sometimes feel with somewhat of a profound hope and enthu
siasm that the function of the English mind, with its uncompromising
matter-of-fact-ness, will be to put the final question to the Universe
with a solid, passionate determination to be answered which must
come to something " (p. 259).
Here we have the key to Sidgwick's life-long interest in the
problems of psychical research. It was in fact a life-long interest ;
for whilst an undergraduate he had joined the Ghost Society at
Cambridge which Archbishop Benson had helped to found, and o
which Dr. Westcott (afterwards Bishop of Durham) had acted as
Secretary. Throughout his correspondence from 1859 onwards there
are constant references to his interest in ghost stories, and in 1863
we find him owning that he is "pretty well read in Pneumatological
Literature." His first introduction to a Spiritualistic seance was in
2F
436 Frank Podmore.
July, I860, when he was in his twenty-second year. A few weeks
later he writes to his sister :
"I gained nothing from my spirit-rapping but experience in the
lower forms of human nature : the woman was a complete humbug.
This does not in the least shake my (qualified) belief in apirit-
rapping, as I hold that where there is flame there must also be
smoke. She accomplished, however, some very remarkable liftings
of the table, which I am almost compelled to attribute to a con
cealed machine, as they must have required more strength than she
was possessed of, however great her sleight of hand may have been.
Some remarkable dents were afterwards discovered under the foot of
the table, which tend to confirm this theory "(p. 55).
In 1864 he was greatly interested in some experiments in auto
matic writing carried on by his friend Cowell, of which a full
description is given in the article by Myers on "Automatic Writing"
in Proceedings, Vol. III., pp. 25-27. In the course of these experi
ments, raps were also heard by himself and Cowell which always
remained a puzzle to him. He refers to them in letters to Mr. H.
G. Dakyns as follows: (March, 1864) "Spiritualism progresses but
slowly : I am not quite in the same phase, as I (fancy I) have
actually heard the raps (produced by C.), so that your 'dreaming
awake' theory will require a further development. However I have
no kind of evidence to come before a jury. So keep it still dark
till I blaze forth" (p. 104).
Later, on April 5th, 1864, he writes again to the same corre
spondent : " As to Spiritualism, do not speak yet ; I have not pro
gressed, but am in painful doubt. Still, I have some personal
experience and much testimony, and I find it hard to believe that
I shall not discover some unknown laws, psychological or other ;
but I do not yet wish even to expound, except vivd wee when
interrogated. The raps were perceived by the sensoria of myself
and Cowell, sitting at a small table, certainly not in consequence of
any physical force exercised by us on the table. You will ticket it
as a case of the 'ide"e fixe'" (p. 106).
Though pressure of other work prevented a continuous and syste
matic investigation into Spiritualism, Sidgwick's interest in the
subject persisted. Thus in 1867 he writes: "I certainly thought I
should have got further towards explaining Spiritualism, one way
or the other; however, it gives life an additional interest having
a problem of such magnitude still to solve" (p. 171). Again in
1873 he writes to F. W. H. Myers: "As for Spirit-Rapping, I am
LII.] Review. 437
exactly in the same mind towards it as towards Religion. I believe
there is something in it : don't know what : have tried hard to
discover, and find that I always paralyse the phenomena ; my taste
is strongly affected by the obvious humbug mixed with it, which,
at the same time, my reason does not overestimate. ' John King '
is an old friend, but as he always came in the dark and talked at
random, our friendship refrigerated. Still I shall be glad to accom
pany you on any favourable opportunity " (pp. 284-85).
A few months later, in the spring of 1874, Myers proposed a
co-operative and more systematic investigation of the subject.
Sidgwick agreed to join, and Mr. A. J. Balfour and Lord Rayleigh
were also amongst those who took part in the enquiry. But
Edmund Gurney, it is interesting to note, could in the first instance
promise nothing more than his warmest sympathies.1 This more
systematic investigation, however, proved in Sidgwick's opinion as
unfruitful as those which had preceded it ; though Myers took a
somewhat more favourable view of the results. At the end of 1875
we find Sidgwick writing to Myers :
"I confess I do not quite like what you tell me of Mrs. Fay (a
medium). Why does she keep changing her ground? ... It
becomes less and less possible to narrate her behaviour to me in
such a way as to make it seem unsuspicious to outsiders. So I
feel that I must for the present drop both her and Mrs. Jencken
out of my 'case for Spiritualism,' and am vexed at being thrown
back in this way.
" What induces me—not to abandon but—to restrict my spiritual
istic investigations is not their disagreeableness (they have never
been other than disagreeable as far as paid mediums are concerned),
but their persistent and singular frustration. However, I find my
interest in the subject is still too intense to allow me to suspend
operations just yet, so I mean to have some more seances with
Herne in December, and will join with you in the negotiations
with Newcastle " (p. 294). •
In the following year he went several times to the notorious slate-
writing medium, Dr. Slade, and writes : " as far as my own experience
goes, I should unhesitatingly pronounce against him."
The most important investigations in which Sidgwick took part
daring this period are described in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper on " Results

of a Personal Investigation into the 'Physical Phenomena' of
Spiritualism" in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., pp. 45-74, and his
general views on the subject may be gathered from his discussion
with Mr. Massey which follows that paper in the same volume.
For the next four or five years Sidgwick's investigations into
Spiritualism appear to have been intermitted. The next reference
to the subject is in September, 1881, when he writes to J. A.
Symonds that "my interest in Spiritualism has been revived."
This revival of interest was mainly due to the successful experi
ments in thought-transference carried on by Professor Barrett In
January of the following year, 1882, a conference was held in
London, at Professor Barrett's invitation, to consider the question
of forming a Society for the systematic investigation of Spiritualism
and kindred subjects. The Conference met in the rooms of the
British National Association of Spiritualists, at 38 Great Russell
Street, and most of those present were members of that body.
Sidgwick himself did not attend : but Myers and Gumey were both
present, and I can well remember the impression produced by their
speeches, and by the intimation made by Myers that if the new
Society was constituted on a sufficiently broad basis, Sidgwick would
probably consent to act as president. A few weeks later the Society
was formally constituted under his presidency.
For the next few years Sidgwick devoted a large part of his
energies to psychical research. It was not that he found much
interest of a sensational kind in the work; indeed he confesses "the
great inferiority of real ghost stories to sham ones . . . whether
for entertainment or for edification." Another time we find him
remarking : " Politics [i.e. the Science of Politics] an agreeable
change from Psychics." Nor was he conscious of being specially
fitted for the work of investigation. He probably lacked some of
the physical qualifications necessary for experimental work. And
his wide sympathies were still too narrow to enable him adequately
to realise the mental and moral processes of physical mediums,
clairvoyants, and irresponsible narrators of ghost stories. But he
gave generously, especially in the early years, both of time and
money to the investigation. In the first three or four years of the
Society's existence we accumulated an enormous mass of evidence—
some thousands of cases—of ghost stories, apparitions, dreams, pro
phetic visions, and the like. The aim of the Society, it will be
recalled, the conception which marked out its investigation from
all previous investigations of the subject, was that it should be
LII.] Review. 489
collective—that the task of appraising the evidence should depend
upon no single judgment. For a committee of five or six persons
to read through in manuscript and pass judgment on each of these
thousands of cases would have been an almost impossible task.
Sidgwick, in this difficulty, came forward and defrayed the cost of
having the entire collection—which mounted up week by week to
almost incredible totals—printed on separate slips, with wide margins
for comments and the insertion of additional evidence. In this way
it was possible for each member of the Literary Committee to form
his or her independent judgment on a case before discussing it in
full conclave. In all the committee's deliberations Sidgwick took a
leading part. He also took a considerable share of the necessary
work of personally interviewing our informants in all parts of the
kingdom ; and with the assistance of Mrs. Sidgwick edited the Proceed
ings and Journal from 1888 to 1897. In most other branches of the
investigation he took an active part. He was on the Committee
appointed to investigate phenomena connected with the Theosophical
Society, whose report was published in Proceedings, Vol. III. He
joined in many of the earlier experiments in thought-transference. In
particular, in conjunction with Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. G. A. Smith, he
conducted an important series of experiments in thought-transference
at Brighton in 1889, which were carried on further by Mrs. Sidgwick
in 1890 and 1891. It was Sidgwick again who was largely respon
sible for initiating one of the most important tasks undertaken by
the Society—the Census of Hallucinations. This was taken up by
the first International Congress of Experimental Psychology (held at
Paris in 1889), and entrusted to his direction. The whole work
was carried out under his guidance, and with his active co
operation at every stage, both in Committee and in the more
tedious work, carried on outside the Committee, of preparing and
classifying the results ; and a report of it was presented to the
second Congress, which met in London under his presidency in
1892. He attended several stances with Eusapia Paladino at Pro
fessor Richet's house in the He Roubaud in 1894, and took a leading
part in the sittings held at Cambridge in 1895, which resulted in
her exposure.
He had a number of sittings with Mrs. Piper during her visit to
England in 1889-90, and always retained the keenest interest in her
trance phenomena, especially after Hodgson's report of the later
sittings, including the "G.P." series, in Proceedings, Vol. XIII. In
short, there was no part of the Society's work which did not claim
440 Frank Podmore. [PART
his attention and sympathy, and in the more important lines of
research he took an active share. The following extract from a
Journal written in 1884 defines his general attitude to the subject
at that time :
"There has been nothing to write about except my work . . .
and Psychical Research, which I feel ought to be my work more
than it is. One effect of growing older is that I cannot really give
my mind to more than one thing at once ; and though I think
Psychical Research profoundly important to mankind, whereas sound
views on the evolution of political ideas are a luxury easily dispensed
with, I am ashamed to find how much more interested I am in
the latter than in the former. The reason is that I feel as if I
had the kind of mind adapted for seeing things—relations—for
myself in the history of Thought : when I read what other people
say, I seem to see that they have not got it quite right; and then,
after an effort, what seems to be the truth comes to me. This is
as near the sense of original production as I ever get, and only
intellectual work that gives me this experience really takes hold
on me. Now in Psychical Research the only faculty that I seem
able to exercise is the judicial; I fee.l equal to classifying and to
some extent weighing the evidence—so far as it depends on general
conclusions—but I do not feel the least gift for making a legitimate
hypothesis as to the causes of the phenomena, and I am too un
observant and unimaginative about physical events generally to be
at all good at evaluating particular bits of evidence. For to tell
whether a 'psychical' experiment or narrative is good or not
evidentially requires one to imagine with adequate accuracy and
exhaustiveness the various possibilities of ' natural ' causation of the
phenomenon, and judge the degree of improbability of each "
(pp. 387-88).
Again, in the previous year, on the occasion of a vacancy in the
Professorship of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge, he had written :
"I have decided to stand for the Professorship ... I do not
quite see who else is to have it, and I find that the Psychical
Researchers think it better for the cause—at least this is Myers's
view. Also it is not yet clear that Psychical Research can occupy
a great deal of one's time ; it depends on our finding ' subjects '
(p. 368).
Again, in 1892, when the Society was firmly established, and no
longer in such urgent need of his help, he is prepared, if Mrs.
Sidgwick's engagements as Principal of Newnham College should
Lil.] . Review. 441
prevent her from devoting much time to psychical research, to give
up his own plans :
"If it turns out that she must sacrifice some of this work, I shall
have to take her place; but my intellect will be an inferior
substitute for this work, and I shall give up with reluctance the
plans of literary work for which I am better fitted. Still, if it
must be so, I shall give them up without hesitation, just as I should
give them up to fight for my country if it was invaded (by the
way, though, I believe I am too old for that)" (pp. 522-23).
But if Sidgwick was not in all respects an ideal investigator,
there was probably no one but himself who could have brought
the Society so triumphantly through its many difficulties in those
early years. That the term " psychical research " is not even now
a bye-word and a reproach is due mainly to Sidgwick's character,
his unquestioned sincerity, and his practical wisdom. And there
is one other quality which belongs so much to the essence
of Sidgwick's nature that in writing about him one is liable to
forget that any description of it is needed. I mean his extraordinary
power of holding his judgment in suspense. Most men when
confronted with an unresolved problem will plunge to one or
another premature solution, or lose their interest in the question.
Sidgwick could maintain his balance on the top of the fence
indefinitely, and resist the temptation to jump down to terra firma,
until it was clear to him on which side lay the truth. As Prof.
Maitland said about him in the Independent Review (June, 1906), if
he had not been what he was, "he might, as others often do, have
forgotten the exact point where proof ended and only hope remained."
And yet he never lost or allowed others to lose interest in the
problem. With this power of holding his judgment in suspense
there was joined a remarkable fairness and sympathetic tolerance of
all opinions differing from his own. Other men as able and as
sincere as Sidgwick might yet have failed to do what Sidgwick did
in guiding the Society. For in those early days our ranks included
many Spiritualists and mystics of all kinds. Most men of his
academic culture and intellectual standing would have been tempted
to pursue a policy which would have alienated many of the
members and would certainly have narrowed the basis of the
Society and impaired its usefulness. We should have lost much if
we had missed the cordial co-operation at the outset of our Spiritualist
friends. But it was no easy matter to hold the balance even. The
first Council included some members who were not wise, as the
442 Frank Podmme. [PART
Universities count wisdom. Sidgwick suffered them, if not always
gladly, at any rate with admirable patience and fairness. At one
of the early meetings at Willis's Rooms there arose a discussion as
to the colour of the aura which, according to certain mystics, radiates
as a visible effluence from the human body. Some of the disputants
maintained that a properly constituted soul would display a blue
radiance ; to others it was patent that pink was the colour of the
perfect soul, and that the popular phrase which assigned blue to
spirits of an undesirable character was justified by the facts. Sidg
wick sat quietly in the Presidential chair during the discussion. To
him, as to most of us, the whole thing must have seemed nonsense,
and pernicious nonsense, since the debate was no doubt seriously
damaging to the reputation of the infant Society. But his sense
of fairness, I think, would not allow him to closure a discussion of
this kind on matters of which he had no personal experience. Nor
was he ever moved to impatience or anger by anything except
unfair dealing and disloyalty. One such occasion I can recall.
In the early days of the Society it was the custom that every
paper to be read at a meeting should first be submitted to the
Council or a Committee of the Council. A paper prepared by one
of our early members, who has long since left us, was so submitted.
For sufficient reasons the Committee unanimously decided that
certain passages ought to be omitted ; the reasons for this decision
were fully explained to the author of the paper, and he was
courteously requested to take the necessary steps. At the meeting,
nevertheless, he read the whole paper, including the offending
passages. It was not the affront to himself, nor even the damage
done to the Society's nascent reputation for common sense, but the
disloyalty of the act which moved Sidgwick on this occasion to
righteous anger.
Under Sidgwick's guidance the Society as we know happily lived
through the perils of infancy. But to him personally the results of
the investigation were no doubt somewhat disappointing. In his
later years, indeed, though he retained to the last a keen interest
in the work of the Society, its doings do not figure largely in
the correspondence here quoted. No fresh evidence of value had
been obtained for the physical phenomena of Spiritualism. In 1894,
indeed, the accounts which F. W. H. Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge
sent of the experiments with Eusapia in the He Roubaud inspired
fresh hope of definite conclusions being attained. And when Sidg
wick witnessed the phenomena for himself, he was at the time
Review. 443
"almost convinced of their genuineness." But this almost conviction
yielded in the following summer to the proof of practised and
systematic fraud : and he came, I understand, finally to the con
clusion that further research in this direction would be likely to
remain unprofitable. But we gather that he attained more or less
conviction of the reality of thought-transference. Thus on March
30, 1887, he writes:
"We had interesting experiments yesterday evening in Thought-
transference with Miss Relph ; not guile enough success to impress
the public decisively, but the conditions unexceptionable, and the
results such as leave no doubt in my mind that I witnessed the
real phenomenon. It certainly is a great fact; I feel a transient
glow of scientific enthusiasm, and find life worth living merely to
prosecute this discovery. If only I could form the least conception
of the modus transferendi / and if only we could find some percipient
whose time we could control a little more" (p. 473).
Again on 3rd Jan., 1886, he writes:
"Came up to London yesterday to meeting of S.P.R. It has
now 600 members and associates, and I shall now let it run alone
without any more nursing. I think it has done good work, as I
do not doubt that Thought-transference is genuine, and hope it
will soon be established beyond cavil ; but I see no prospect of
making way in the far more interesting investigation of Spiritualism.1
I fear our experience shows that evidence available for scientific
purposes is not likely to be forthcoming ; still, having put our
hands to plough this bog, it would be feeble to look back so soon"
(pp. 435-6).
There are passages in the correspondence quoted in this book
which might lead one to suppose that in his later years Sidgwick
lost almost if not altogether the hope which had encouraged him at
the beginning of the Society's work—the hope of obtaining empirical
evidence of a future life. In March, 1887, he writes:
" But at present the recognised failure of my efforts to obtain
evidence of immortality affects me not as a Man but as a Moralist.
1 Ethics,' says J. A. S., ' can take care of themselves.' I think I
agree with what is meant, but should word it differently. I should
say ' morality can take [care] of itself,' or rather the principle of
life in human society can take care of morality. But howl

the average man, who must live content with Common Sense.
Perhaps he will always
Fix perfect homes in the unsubstantial sky,
And say what is not will be by and by.
At any rate, somehow or other, morality will get on ; I do not
feel particularly anxious about that. But my special business is
not to maintain morality somehow, but to establish it logically as a
reasoned system ; and I have declared and published that this can
not be done, if we are limited to merely mundane sanctions, owing
to the inevitable divergence, in this imperfect world, between the
individua1's Duty and his Happiness. I said in 1874 that without
some datum beyond experience ' the Cosmos of Duty is reduced to
a Chaos.' Am I to recant this conviction and answer my own
arguments—which no one of my numerous antagonists has yet even
tried to answer? Or am I to use my position—and draw my
salary—for teaching that Morality is a chaos, from the point of
view of Practical Reason ; adding cheerfully that, as man is not
after all a rational being, there is no real fear that morality won't
be kept up somehow" (p. 472).
Again, after reading carefully through T. H. Green's Prolegomena
to Ethics, he writes that he finds himself "unable to resist the con
viction that my intellect could not put it together into a coherent
whole—in fact, that it would not do— and yet that probably it was
better that young men should be believers in it than in anything
I can teach them. This is a conviction adapted to make a Pro
fessor cynical" (p. 380).
But these passages were probably written in moods of depression,
and do not, 1 am given to understand, fairly represent his final
attitude towards the question of survival after death. Both of the
passages just quoted, indeed, were written before the publication of
the Piper documents—by far the most important evidence as yet
brought forward for the belief. And that evidence produced a
strong impression upon his mind, and did much to revive his
hopes that empirical proof of a future existence might ultimately
be obtained. In fact he remained to the last of opinion that
however dubious the result of the quest, it was our duty to
pursue it.
His later views on the great problems of religious belief may be

"My attitude towards Christianity is briefly this. • (1) I think
Optimism in some form is an indispensable creed—not for every
one, but for progressive humanity as a whole. (2) I .think
Optimism in a Theistic form—I mean the belief that there is a
sympathetic soul of the Universe that intends the welfare of each
particular human being and is guiding all the events of his life
for his good—is, for the great majority of human beings, not only
the most attractive form of optimism, but the most easily accept
able, being not more unproven than any other form of optimism,
and certainly more satisfying to the deepest human needs. (3) I
think that no form of Optimism has an adequate rational basis ;
therefore, if Theism is to be maintained—and I am inclined to
predict the needs of the human heart will maintain it—it must be,
for Europeans, by virtue of the support that it still obtains from
the traditional belief in historical Christianity.
"Well, I myself have taken service with Reason, and I have
no intention of deserting. At the same time I do not think that
loyalty to my standard requires me to feign a satisfaction in the
service which I do not really feel " (p. 508).
. "It seems to me, then, that if we are led to accept Theism as
being, more than any other view of the Universe, consistent with,
and calculated to impart a clear consistency to, the whole body of
what we commonly agree to take for knowledge—including know
ledge of right and wrong—we accept it on grounds analogous to
those on which important scientific conclusions have been accepted ;
and that, even though we are unable to add the increase of
certitude derivable from verified predictions, we may still attain
a sufficient strength of reasoned conviction to justify us in calling
our conclusions a ' working philosophy ' " (p. 559).
So far I have followed the authors of the Life, and have allowed
Henry Sidgwick to tell his own story. Nor is it perhaps necessary
to add anything. The whole character of the man stands revealed
in these extracts from his own writings. With perhaps one
exception. It is not easy to infer from Sidgwick's own utterances
the existence of qualities which he, almost paradoxically, possessed
in a high degree : his administrative capacity, his sound judgment
in affairs, his practical wisdom. These qualities were proved, of
course, not only in the guidance of the Society for Psychical
Research, but omnium consensu on a more conspicuous scale in his
work at the University and at Newnham College. I should wish,
446 Frank Podm&re. [PART
nevertheless, to add a few words on my own account on some aspects
of his character. I was one of those —and they were, I believe,
many,—who received from Sidgwick advice and help in literary work.
It was given without stint. One of my earliest essays—an article
written for one of the monthly reviews in answer to an attack on
the evidence published in Phantasms of the Living—was in its first
draft a sufficiently crude affair. Sidgwick corrected it—I was going
to write as a master might correct a schoolboy's theme—but that
would be to give an altogether false account of his method and
attitude. He did not correct as a master, he offered suggestions
and advice as a fellow student. And the recipient of his advice
was conscious not of the humiliation of one who has his faults
pointed out to him, but only of the illumination which conies from
an insight recognised as deeper and truer than his own. At a
later date Sidgwick read through before publication the whole of
my first two books on psychical research. He found time also in
the year before his death to read much of the typescript of the
first volume of my Modern Spiritualism. It would be difficult to
overestimate what I gained from his criticism. There lie before
me as I write several pages of notes and suggestions, written in
his exquisitely clear handwriting, on the book last mentioned.
Earely indeed did I venture to disregard his suggestions—not
because they were his, but because they carried with them con
viction. It was by no means only in the handling of the evidence
that his advice was of value. I found that it was no less helpful
in the literary treatment of the subject. For no doubt in literature,
as in science or philosophy, it is the single eye which is needed.
Sidgwick, I should suppose, did not consciously aim at literary effect.
But he achieved it, and taught others to achieve it, by virtue of
seeing things truly. He would point out where the loose-fitting
conventional phrase misrepresented the facts, or where a piece of
slovenly thinking marred the argument : and in correcting these
faults one found with surprise that one had improved the manner
of the writing no less than the matter.
And this naturally leads to another point. No one who knew
Sidgwick only from his most important philosophical works could
foVm any fair idea of the man. Ordinary reviewers were apt to
find his writing heavy and dull. He himself, referring to the
reception of one of his books, expressed the hope that he might
yet write literature before he died. But he wrote under a deep
sense of responsibility. Perhaps for good literature there is needed
LIL] Review. 447
a certain indirectness of treatment, a certain play of personality
which he would have felt to be out of place in dealing with the
ultimate problems of philosophy. Certainly the literary grace and
the humour which are lacking in his more serious works abounded
in his letters and in some of his earlier essays. His treatment of
Matthew Arnold in the essay on "The Prophet of Culture" is not
more admirable for the justice of the criticism than for the genial
satire employed. His presidential addresses to our Society in the
early days are wonderfully effective. And the letters included in
this volume fascinate equally by their wide sympathies as by the
grace of their style and by their abounding humour.
And what is true of his letters was, of course, equally true of his
conversation. His talk was always alive with sympathy and with
humour. Humour is a perishable flower, very difficult to transplant
fiom its native soil. But one illustration may be quoted from the
book before us. Sidgwick had read a paper on Green's philosophy
before an Oxford Society. The burden of his criticism, in Mr.
Schiller's words, was " that there existed a fundamental incoherence
in Green's thinking. When he had finished, the disciples of Green
got up oiie after the other—and admitted it ! Only they thought
that it might be cured by going on from Green in various directions
to Hegel, to natural science, etc. Finally a prominent Hegelian
made the inevitable suggestion that such fundamental incoherence
merely indicated that the region of the ultimate difficulties of thought
had been reached, and inferred that both sides of the contradiction
should be sustained. This gave Sidgwick his opportunity. After
replying to the other criticisms, he went on to say that 'as for the
remarks of the last speaker, he had never been able to make out
from the school to which he evident1y belonged how they managed
to distinguish the contradictions which they took to be evidence of
error from those which they regarded as intimations of higher
truth. ' "
But there was one special quality, which all who met Sidgwick
must have recognised in him, which gave him, indeed, a unique
position in his generation. The most appropriate name for this
quality—a name soiled of recent years by much ignoble use—is,
I suppose, humility. This humility was no doubt native to him.
But it must have been fostered and developed by the circumstances
of his life. To most men who set out on the search for truth
there comes, no doubt, a time when they are content to find rest
in some half-way house. To Sidgwick no halting place was possible,
'448 Frank Podmore. [PART
short of the goal ; and the goal he never reached. A man who is
able to accept such an experience—to acknowledge defeat and still
to pursue—must certainly have learnt humility. And this quality
is shewn in his whole attitude towards psychical research. Most
men of Sidgwick's intellectual standing "sniffed"—as Sidgwick says
of T. H. Green—at the very idea of looking for instruction in ghost
stories and table-turning. But to Sidgwick nothing was common
or unclean. And just as no fact was to him too insignificant to be
worthy of study, so no person was so foolish but that something
might be learned from him. Thus he writes to Mrs. Sidgwick—
" I am sorry you are plagued with the correspondence with . . . ;
at the same time I cannot help thinking that you may derive
instruction from this, and from the criticisms in Light, if you can
get yourself into the state of mind of taking a large amount of
misunderstanding and misrepresentation as inevitable, and merely
endeavour to extract the grains of useful suggestion. At least, I
myself have always learnt from criticism when I could get into
this state of mind about it" (p. 395).
And none of us who ever talked with Sidgwick or sat with him
in Council can have failed to be struck by the attention—an atten
tion amounting almost to deference—with which he would listen
to the opinions of the youngest and least considerable of those
present. There are many testimonies in the book to this quality
of Sidgwick's mind. Thus a former pupil, Miss Gardner, writes
of his teaching, "he treated our remarks as respectfully as if they
had been made by some eminent critic. One felt that, however
wide the difference between one's own mind and his might be, he
regarded each one of us as, in a sense, a fellow-seeker after truth
and clearness; and the feeling brought stimulus and hope" (p. 312).
And Leslie Stephen testifies to the same effect :
"He was not only perfectly frank but. glad to gain enlightenment
even from comparatively commonplace minds. Johnson commended
a talker who would fairly put his mind to yours. That marks one
of Sidgwick's merits. He would take up any topic ; made no pre
tension to superiority, and was as willing to admit ignorance or
error as he was always fertile in new lights" (p. 315).
Sidgwick aptly expresses his own position thus :
"I do not think I was made to be a teacher of age and dignity:
I like talking to young men, but I like talking to them as an
equal ..." (p. 488).
And if he gained profit by this singular openness of mind, we
Lii.] . .Review. 449
who were honoured by his attention gained more. It was impossible
for the most diffident to feel otherwise than at ease in his presence.
But it was not an ease which conduced to sloth. His conversation
acted as a moral and intellectual stimulant. His sincerity evoked
a like sincerity in those with whom he conversed. One would have
felt ashamed in Sidgwick's presence to express any opinion that was
slovenly or superficial, or to advocate a course inspired by any
ignoble motive.
The end of his life was of a piece with all the rest. Indeed, the
mere suggestion that it could have been otherwise would seem an
impertinence to his memory. Early in May, 1900, he learnt that
he was suffering from internal cancer, and that an immediate oper
ation was necessary. For the rest of the month he went about his
work, feeling that after the operation there might be no further
opportunity for work. He put his papers in order as far as the
time permitted, prepared an address on the philosophy of T. H.
Green for the Oxford Philosophical Society, attended a meeting of
the Newnham Council, and fulfilled other engagements. For a fort
night or so he had kept the news from all his friends. But as the
time for the operation approached he found it necessary to speak.
He wrote to F. W. H. Myers on the 24th May to tell him, adding:
" Life is very strange now, very terrible, but I try to meet it like
a man, my beloved wife aiding me. I hold on—or try to hold
on—to duty and love, and through love to touch the larger hope.
I wish now I had told you before, as this may be farewell. Your
friendship has had a great place in my life, and as I walk through
the Valley of the Shadow of Death I feel your affection. Pray for
me" (p. 587).
He took leave of his friends in Cambridge, and came up to London
on the day before the operation, which took place on the 31st. During
the weeks of convalescence he saw and talked with many friends.
He sent me a message asking me to visit him, and I gladly went.
At that time he knew, I think, that he had at most a year or two
to live, and the end actually came before the summer was over.
But he seemed unchanged in his outlook on life, with his interest
in all things as fresh as ever. I remember his telling me about
some novels which he had just read, being at that time, I suppose,
too weak to undertake more serious reading, and asking me if I
could recommend him any more. He talked about the affairs of the
S.P.R. and other matters with the same bright and sympathetic
interest which he had always shewn. At my second visit he
450 Frank Podmore. [PART
had just returned from a drive to Regent's Park, where he had
rather overtaxed his strength in attempting to walk. But though
obviously tired he would not send me away, but asked me to come
in, and conversed for a few minutes with his habitual cheerfulness
and humour. I never saw him again, and the end came a few weeks
later, on the 28th August.
Mr. Haldane, in his recent address to the University of Edinburgh,
has described what should be the function of a University in the
national life : that the best minds should there receive their training
for the highest service to the state. I do not know where there
could be found a finer example than that exhibited by Henry
Sidgwick of the " dedicated life " which Mr. Haldane describes—a
life dedicated, however, not to the state, but to humanity—a life
wholly given to the strenuous search for Truth, and finding in that
search its sole and sufficient reward. Nearly all lives—our own or
others—as we look back on them must seem desultory and incomplete.
But Henry Sidgwick's had a unity and completeness beyond that
of most men. I do not mean that it was complete if measured by
the results, for of the results we are scarcely yet able to judge. But
if we consider not the achievement but the purpose, we shall find
that Sidgwick's life presented more than others a symmetrical whole.
Its symmetry was marred by no infirmity of endeavour, by no self-
seeking, by no petty personal aims. His years were continuously
spent from youth upwards in the one high impersonal quest. In
looking back on such a life we can see " age approve of youth, and
death complete the same."
One of his friends writes that on May 27th, a few days before the
operation, Sidgwick recited some stanzas from Swinburne's "Super
Flumina Babylonis." I well remember some years ago to have
heard him recite the same lines, lines which may appropriately
furnish his own epitaph :
" Unto each man his handiwork, unto each his crown
The Just Fate gives;
Whoso takes the world's life on him, and bis own lays down,
He, dying so, lives."

Although these three books were published in precisely the reverse
order of that here given, I shall here review the books in th&
present order, for the reason that that is the order in which they
should have been published,—if we were to look at the question
from the psychical researcher's, and not the publisher's, point of
view. The three, taken together, form a very handy reference
library on all things 'psychic' for the average person who has neither
the time nor the patience to wade through the complete Reports
in the Society's Proceedings. I shall first of all give a rapid
rtsnmt of the contents of eacli volume ;—the detailed discussions
and cases are doubtless known to members of the S.P.R., since it
is from the Proceedings and Journals of the Society that most of the
facts are drawn.
Dr. Hyslop begins the Borderland with chapters on " Sense
Perception," " Interpreting and Associating Functions of the Mind,"
" Memory and Dissociation and Obliviscence "—all of which are
much needed (in this country, at least, where so much pseudo-
scientific research is carried on), in order to give the public a
good general view of the way the mind works in health, and to-
present clearly the position and the theories of the scientific world
in relation to these questions. It is fair to state that the vast
majority of persons have ' no objection ' to the theory of a future
life, simply because they do not realize the arguments against it
which are urged by the scientific world, nor the strength of the
materialistic position ; and it is a good thing that these objections
should be made clear to the public mind. When this has been
done, the position and the importance of the phenomena dealt with
by psychical research will be better understood.
Next follow two most interesting chapters on " Illusions " and
" Hallucinations "—giving a clear idea of the theories held to-day
with regard to the nature and initiation of these mental states, and
much more discussion which we cannot stop to consider. The next
chapter, " Pseudo-Spiritistic Phenomena," is very fine indeed, and

brings us into the field of psychic phenomena proper. It is mostly
•destructive in character, however, as the title might lead us to
suppose, and deals with the fraud connected with the subject
•(especially with the Physical Phenomena) containing, among other
things, a very detailed and excellent discussion of the Slade-Zollner
investigation. Besides the objections urged by Mrs. Sidgwick, iu
her discussion of the evidence in this case (Proceedings, Vol. IV.),
Dr. Hyslop points out eleven sources of error, or defects in the
evidence,—every one of which is highly important. The discussion
•of slate-writing phenomena, ballot-tests, etc., is also interesting,
and the whole chapter is well worth reading by any one interested
in these problems ; and certainly should be read by all those who
are too ready to credit the physical phenomena as genuine.
The next chapter, " Subconscious Action and Secondary Person
ality," summarizes—after some interesting preliminary discussion—
the Morton Prince ' Sally Beauchamp ' Case ; Janet's ' Leonie ' Case ;
the Ansel Bourne Case ; Flournoy's ' Mile. Smith ' Case ; a Case of
his own, closely resembling the last mentioned, and others. The
'material is mostly familiar to readers of the Proceedings, but should
prove most useful to the average reader, in helping to make clear
to his mind this perplexing question of double and multiplex
personality. The man-in-the-street is inclined to regard every
intelligence foreign to the normal consciousness as a " spirit " ; and
it is a useful piece of work to make clear the fact that this need
•not be the explanation of it.
A chapter on " Mind and Body '> follows—this being divided into
two portions; first, a discussion of the theories of the inter-relations
•of mind and body from the philosophic standpoint ; and, secondly,
a discussion of the influence of the mind upon the body,—as
instanced in various cures, the cases of "miraculous healing," etc.
This brings us naturally to the next chapter, "Hypnotism and
Therapeutics," the contents of which need not be discussed at any
length here. Following this is perhaps the most interesting chapter
in the book,—that on "Reincarnation." Professor Hyslop evidently
does not think much of the theory from any point of view—
•contending that it is not the most rational theory, from a purely
philosophical point of view, and that it has no real evidence in its
favour. The cases of " Memory of past lives "—so often referred to
by believers in this theory—Dr. Hyslop considers to be due to illusions
and hallucinations of memory, or to the eruption into consciousness
of forgotten dreams or subconsciously noted impressions, or te
LII.] Review. 453
impressions noted before the age of four, when the personality is
in process of formation, and when no consecutive mental record of
the life is kept, only isolated incidents remembered. Dr. Hyslop
urges that scenes and incidents noted or remembered in any of
these states—at any such times—would have a tendency to emerge
into consciousness as new impressions, since they were not previously
associated with the normal waking personality ; and yet such an
impression, owing to the fact that it had actually been experienced
before, would have a tendency to be associated with some past
event in the mental life, because of its feeling of 'familiarity.' As
it does not belong to the conscious life of the individual, it may be
relegated by him to some past ' incarnation.'
" Reservations and Morals " is the title of the last chapter, and
its title sufficiently explains its contents.
The second book, "Enigmas of Psychical Research," I must
summarize even more briefly than the first book, for the reason
that the contents are doubtless more familiar to the reader of the
Society's Proceedings than those of the other work. It contains
chapters on " Crystal Gazing," " Telepathy," " Dreams," " Appari
tions," "Clairvoyance," "Premonitions," " Mediumistic Phenomena,"
and " The Residues of Science "—all of which titles sufficiently
indicate the character of the contents in each case. There is a
chapter on " Ancient Oracles," which is highly interesting,—as is the
final chapter, " Retrospect and Vaticination." Dr. Hyslop has an
ingenious theory to account for premonitions, which is all the
more welcome because of the scarcity of hypotheses put forward to
explain them. In the chapter on " Mediumistic Phenomena," Dr.
Hyslop has devoted several pages to his ' Smead Case '—which bids
fair to parallel Mrs. Piper's, if sufficient means can be raised to
carry on the investigation as systematically as has been done in the
latter case.
The third volume, " Science and a Future Life," deals almost
entirely with the ' Piper Case,' and is by far the most interesting
of the three. One can see that the writer's heart is in this volume
—while purely intellectual belief and interest prompted the others.
The first chapter, " Origin of Psychic Research," traces back the
investigations into these fields in a most interesting manner; while
the second chapter, " General Problems and Results," summarizes
the work of the S.P.R. to date. Then comes the chapter on "The
Problem of a Future Life," and this places before the reader the
real problems at issue in a terse and excellent manner. What the
202
454 Hereward Carrington. [PART
" real problems " are is made clear, as well as the methods that
should be adopted in order to reach any sound conclusions. Here,
again, there is much misunderstanding in the public mind, which
hopelessly mixes up physical phenomena, predictions, and what-not,
with the real question at issue—the persistence of, and possibility of
communication with, an individual consciousness, after the death of
the physical body. All other arguments are purely subsidiary to this
one: can consciousness continue to function in the absence of the
oerve-tissue, with which it is invariably bound up in this life)
Obviously the only way to prove that it can do so, is to prove that
it actually does so, and that is a question of scientific fact, a question
of evidence. "Philosophy," says our author, "is useless and worthless"
in settling this question of a future life. The whole question is one
of evidence—of proof, of fact. That is the attitude in which to
approach this problem ; and the Piper case is so important because
it has supplied us (apparently) with these facts.
The rest of the book, accordingly, is written around this case—
the following chapters being the " History of the Piper Case,"
" Incidents from the English Report," " Dr. Hodgson's First Eeport,"
" Dr. Hodgson's Second Report," " Personal Experiments and
Results," " The Telepathic Hypothesis," " The Spiritistic Hypothesis,"
and " Difficulties and Objections "—all being practically a summary
of the Reports mentioned, and the arguments contained therein.
In the final chapter, " Ethical Meaning and Results," Dr. Hyslop
has emphasized most strongly the importance of the phenomena,
because of the tremendous consequences that are involved in their
proof or their disproof; for it may almost be said that on the Piper
Case hinges a materialistic or a spiritualistic outlook upon the
universe.
Dr. Hyslop devotes a whole chapter to a consideration of the
"Conditions affecting the 'Communicators'"—this being virtually
an extension and further defence of the arguments brought forward
in his Report. The spiritistic theory is presented in so fascinating
a manner that it seems almost impossible to resist accepting it as
at least a " working hypothesis."
One or two quotations will show the fairness and impartiality of
the book. Speaking of the objection to the spiritistic theory based
upon the triviality of the facts obtained through the medium, the
author says : " If the facts make the spiritistic theory the only
rational supposition possible to explain them, it has to be accepted
whether desirable or not. Our business as scientists is not with the
Lii.j Review. 455
desirability of a next life, but with the fact of it. We have to
accept the life to come, if it be a fact, without any ability to escape
it, and its degenerated nature would not affect the evidence for the
fact of it. Its being a madhouse or an asylum for idiots would
not weaken the evidence for its existence. We should have to bear
with it stoically, and perhaps, if our moral lives were what they
ought to be, that degenerate condition, if it be the natural consequence
of action when living, might not follow. In any case, however, the
desirability or undesirability of a future existence has nothing to do
with the scientific question whether it is a fact" (pp. 299-300).
And again on p. 364 we read :
" If a future life is a fact we cannot disprove it by laughing at
phenomena that we do not like. Our aesthetics have no more to
do with the fact than they have with the eclipse of the sun or
with the existence of disease. Emotional contempt of the facts is
no more legitimate than the condemned emotional interest in a
future life, and if it be a fact, we shall not escape it by cultivating
indifference to its truth."
It is to be hoped that the publication of these three books will
hasten the day when psychical research will become, not only a
' respectable ' study, but an actual and vital science.
HEREWARD CARRINGTON.
The Subconscious. BY JOSEPH JASTROW, Professor of Psychology
in the University of Wisconsin. (London, Archibald Constable
& Co., Ltd. ; Boston and New York, Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,
1906.)
Professor Jastrow's book offers a comprehensive and sober-
minded survey of the manifestations of the subconscious, alike
in normal and in abnormal conditions, and a cautious attempt
to explain them in accordance with the general principles of
biological evolution.
There is little new material in the book. There are indeed
a few cases of dreams and of reverie and abstraction in normal
life, from the author's own experience, or that of his pupils.
But all the more striking illustrations are taken from published
sources—our own Proceedings, the works of William James,
Flournoy, Morton Prince, Boris Sidis, Janet, and others. One
irritating defect in the presentation of the illustrative cases is
that references are rarely given to the original publication.
456 frank Podmore. [PABT
Material, for instance, which originally appeared in our
Proceedings is laid under contribution, but I can find but one
solitary reference to the source. It can hardly be supposed that
Professor Jastrow is willing to borrow from us, but afraid to
imperil his reputation for scientific orthodoxy by acknowledging
the debt. The omission is, I prefer to think, to be attributed
to his general indifference to detail of this kind. His citations
are commonly introduced by some such phrase as ' ' Mr. Galton
has recorded," or "Sir William Ramsay's experience"—and we
look in vain for the footnote which should tell us where the
original is to be found. Akin to this omission of references is
another defect. There is nowhere any clear summary of the
argument : the so-called ' ' Table of Contents " is but a list of
the titles of the chapters. This makes the argument unnecessarily
difficult to follow ; and throws upon the reader, or reviewer,
much labour which should, I venture to think, have been under
taken by the author.
But these defects apart, the book is a valuable one, as con
taining a sober statement of the rationalist position. An
essential part of the thesis is that personality—the conscious
self—is to be regarded less as a growth than as an achievement,
something won by labour and retained only by constant vigilance ;
and as liable, during any intermission of that vigilance, to
continual encroachments from lower phases of consciousness :
" Personality has been set forth not as an inevitable datum,
but as an achievement,—truly a normal issue furthered by the
ordinary vicissitudes of life, yet one whose establishment may
involve struggle and compromise, relinquishment, and concen
trated as well as sustained purpose. The manner by which such
an issue arises, and the essential contribution thereto of the
lower registers of consciousness, indicate that failure in this
respect must proceed from a comprehensive disordering of all
the constituent phases of the mind's progressions." (pp. 518-9.)
Normally, the part of the subconscious is mainly to act as
an auxiliary—to enrich and supplement, not to guide or supplant.
But Professor Jastrow is by no means inclined to depreciate
the importance of the function assigned to the subconscious
" The comment (by Mr. Leland), that the ' man who built a
Romanesque cathedral worked by the suggestion of minds which
went before him,' may be extended to all notable forms of human
endeavour. Styles, schools, creeds, philosophies come and go;
LIL] Review. 457
and the allegiances which they command flourish by the traditions
that they embody, that give sympathy of aim as well as con
cordance of expression to the brotherhood of disciples. '
" In all these cultural sequences of human destiny the great
momentum of subconsciously absorbed and subconsciously trans
mitted traditions vivifies the onward movement, and leaves its
indelible impress upon the history and upon the quality of the
race. It does so by compensating the advances that result from
the penetration born of reasoned concepts, the practical mastery
that is the reward of an expert rationality, with the intuitive
insight, that, though subject to waywardness and lame in defence,
is keen-witted for the true, devoted with strenuous conviction
to the right, delicately sensitive to the beautiful. Without the
cumulative inheritance of tradition, as also without the bold
flights of imagination, reason would proceed at a snai1's pace ;
for all art requires alike, critical acumen and skilled, deeply
ingrained proficiency. The scientific spirit—the most finished
expression of conscious activity—finds its saving balance in the
impressible imagination, —the richest quarry of the subconscious.
In all character, as in all achievement, there are talents more
efficient than those consciously exercised, powers deeper than those
we wittingly command, that enable us to do better than we know
how. This recognition has ever been present in the conception
of genius, picturing its incomprehensibility as an unquestioning
response to an inspiration, as a surrender to the natural forces
that seethe within, thougfc reinforced by experience ; as in its
labours indifferent to means, oblivious to the why and wherefore,
but firmly possessed with the imperative importance of its
message, and leaving lowlier tasks to lesser minds that are con
strained with painful deliberation to marshal in simple order
the limited resources at their command. In this appraisement
of the constituents of character, of the service of ideals in shaping
culture, as of the quality of talents that further mental achieve
ment, do the traditional wisdom of the ages and the analyses of
psychology find common issue." (pp. 158-9.)
The latter part of the book is devoted to showing the analogies
between the extremest forms of dissociated and impaired con
sciousness, and the deviations from full consciousness found in
perfectly normal persons. Thus, the man who hunts for the
spectacles which are actually fixed on his forehead, or cuts into
the leg of mutton and then, in view of the gaping wound,
458 Frank Podmvre. [PART
believes that he has dined, shows a momentary anaesthesia com
parable to that of the poor hysterical patient, who loses her
legs in bed. In both cases the sum of conscious attention is not
enough to go round :
" For the pronounced hysterical temperament, wide or well-
maintained alertness of mind is difficult : two activities, though
of slight import, can no longer be maintained at once ; to give
attention to a small area of experience involves the momentary
loss of the rest. The spread of the search-light of attention is
much reduced, while also its power of illumination is enfeebled.
The mental blinders—though peculiarly selective in what they
admit and exclude—are worn more and more continuously ; the
contracted habit of consciousness is formed. Systematic gaps in
perception and in the control of the expressive agencies of the
intellect are at first tolerated, then resignedly or stolidly accepted.
The patient forgets to include her arm within her conscious
concern ; and it remains neglected, possibly in a permanently
contracted attitude." (p. 316.)
Here again is an explanation on rationalist principles of the
feats of arithmetic performed by calculating boys :
" Arithmetical prodigies, along with painters, poets, and
writers, are apt to project a situation in a brilliant visual image,
as remarkable for the scope and complexity of details as for its
accuracy and ready command. They see as on imaginary black
boards, or like the fleeting exposure of a picture thrown upon
the screen, the partial resultant of their complex calculations.
With closed eyes and a strained inner vision, they build up their
constructions with large inclusive spans of procedure, so sup-
pressedly reasoned that results seem to follow upon premises by
some prompted insight, and equations yield their solutions as in
a flash. By extensive and intimately familiarized material held
ever ready for service ; by passionate and incessant devotion to
figures; by ceaseless rumination over primes and squares and
roots and products ; by facile devising of short-cut procedures
that bring result close to premise, there is acquired a great mass
of ' understudied ' material, mental tables of predigested results,
in the manipulation of which formulated procedures come to play
a decreasing part. The planning and the sectional construction
are, in the main, consciously directed and consummated, and are
supported at every stage by the minor operations facilitated to
the point of mechanical automatism, and filling in the niches of
LII.] Review. 459
the construction as fast as they arise. Moreover, effort accom
panies the task, and in some fair proportion to its unfamiliarity
and intrinsic difficulty ; in brief, the result, however notable,
maintains an intelligible relation to the normal type of ante
cedents, and may thus be included within the instances of
exalted facilitation dependent alike upon temperament and
cultivation." (pp. 468-9.)
These quotations will serve to illustrate the scope of the book.
The qualities especially distinguishing the work are sobriety of
judgment and clearness of analysis. The style is picturesque and
often forcible and illuminating. But as a whole it suffers from
a Teutonic habit of thought ; the sentences are often like
portmanteaus packed too full. Take these two as illustrations.
The author desires to put the question whether the dreams that
we remember adequately represent our dream life as a whole, and
this is how he phrases it :
" Is the position warranted that accepts the testimony of
memory, controlled by the usual experimental precautions (in
this instance, the recognition of the many dreams that occur,
but are forgotten), as worthy of the same regard as attaches to
the careful introspective account of any of our mental pro
cedures?" (pp. 176-7.) Or again, take this sentence:
" From an experimental approach, it has been determined that
if one persists in judging the comparative brightness of two tints
long after these have been so equalized that the eye has lost all
difference between them, the judgments thus accumulated without
confidence and seemingly by guesswork prove that the judging
mechanism, in spite of its low introspective rating, reports in
slight favor of the actually brighter tint. Its preferences in
this distrusted region remain consistently placed ; and the balance
in favor of the really brighter stimulus decreases as the actual
difference in tint itself grows less." (p. 417.)
It seems to me an unfair tax upon a reader's patience to
present him with conundrums of this kind.
It should be added that the name of F. W. H. Myers does not
appear in the Index of the book, though a few pages of the final
chapter are devoted to a criticism, mainly on the ground of its
inconsistency with the progress of evolution, of the theory of the
subconscious of which Myers was the most eminent exponent.
In the following passage in the preface Professor Jastrow defines
his general attitude:
460 Frank Podmore. [PART mj
" Only a few, and in the main slight, general surveys of the
field have been published. The one notable exception is the
work of the late Mr. Frederic W. H. Myers (Human Personality,
2 vols., 1903). In respect to that, I record with pleasure my
appreciation of the ability and devotion of the author, as well
as of the skill of his presentations; and I record with regret,
that in spite of a 'common interest in the same ranges of pheno
mena, and a fair measure of agreement in the interpretation of
the more objective and verifiable data, I yet find my point of
view so little in accord with his, that I have been able to profit
but slightly by his discerning labors."
