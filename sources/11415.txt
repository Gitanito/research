  		              		Experience Description   

    My near-death experience happened 30 years ago, but I still can remember it  as if it happened only yesterday.
  
  At the time I was 14 years old. I had bad bronchitis and hadn't been  to school in days. The day I had the near-death experience was on mother's day and my grandparents, with whom I had a very close relationship,  came to visit.
  
  I was lying down in my bed and in my room. I felt very sluggish from the bronchitis and was very apathetic. I can still  remember  looking at the ceiling when  I felt a state of weightlessness. Then I realized that I was floating towards the ceiling. From above, I looked down and saw my body lying in bed. I did not feel afraid; it felt so normal and easy. I felt like I was  held,  safe, and loved. Then everything around me became very luminously bright and a warm light pervaded everything. I saw a brightly shining circle whose edges dissolved into soft, yellowish-red colors. In my head I heard a voice. It told me that I could decide if I wanted to stay forever up here in the light or if I wanted to go back to my body.
  
  A I thought about  what I wanted to do, I noticed that below myself the door of my room opened. I saw my beloved grandma  peeking through  to check on  me. I suddenly felt that I wanted my heart back in my body because I loved my family so much.

  Again, I heard the voice in my head. It said, 'When you are back in your body you have to tell your grandma that you need to get quickly to a hospital, otherwise you will not survive.' Then everything happened very fast. I left the warm, bright, and safe light and found myself back in my body. To my grandma I said that I needed to go very fast to the hospital because  I felt so  bad.

  I still can remember that my father carried me down the stairs. I collapsed and woke up  at the hospital, connected to tubes and a respirator. The doctors said that the bronchitis had developed into a life-threatening  pneumonia. I had only 5% oxygen left in my blood. Later on they said, had I arrived only 15 minutes later at the hospital I would have died.

  Since this experience, my grandma and I had  an even deeper connection. When she died at almost 90 years of age, a very psychic lady from my relationships got in touch with me. She told me that in the night when my grandma died, she appeared at her place with a message to tell me. She wanted me to know that  where she is now, she is fine. That she is happy to be with grandpa and that she loves me very deeply.

  Since the experience of my near-death I'm dealing very much with the soul, with death and near-death experiences of other people. It opened a spiritual way for me, that I'm very grateful about. I have lost the fear of dying.
