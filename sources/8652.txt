  Experience  description:   &nbsp;&nbsp;   </b>

  I   can not remember everything. I was asleep. I could feel that I had &quot;pulled&quot;   myself out again and I was somewhere. I can't remember the order of events. I   remember &quot;buzzing&quot; or &quot;floating&quot; around and I saw a being that I knew and felt   close to...it felt like it was another time. I loved &quot;her&quot; and somehow I knew   she was me and I could tell that she looked differently than what I do now and   she was younger. I &quot;buzzed&quot; around and saw what I thought was her family and I   loved them too. &nbsp;

  I   then found myself somewhere else, and that's when the main &quot;thing&quot; happened.   &quot;He&quot; ran to me, he didn't have a face that I could see but he had a lean   athletic form. &quot;He&quot; ran into me and we became one and then I felt something I   have never felt before...strong vibrations...I didn't want for it to stop. I   loved him and I didn't want for him to leave. My entire body vibrated and I can   not ever explain the feeling to anyone. I do not know how to explain. He then   went away. I felt myself go back into my body. Then I left again. I started to   chase a form &amp; I &quot;heard&quot; or understood a voice that told me not to follow him. I   remember some time during this I felt very scared. I was going back into my body   &amp; that is when I saw my face. I saw my face like I was another person looking at   me and I went back into my body. I then felt the strong vibrations again. I can   not explain how they felt...there are no words...I know I felt peace. &nbsp;

    Was the kind of experience difficult to express in words?&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The   feelings and how I &quot;felt&quot; more than I could see

  At   the time of this experience, was there an associated life threatening event?&nbsp;   No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, describe. &nbsp;

    What was your level of consciousness and alertness during the experience?&nbsp; I&nbsp;was   asleep at first.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the experience dream like in any way? No. &nbsp;

    Was there any medical evidence of cessation of breathing or heart function? No. &nbsp;

    Did you experience a separation of your consciousness from your body?&nbsp;Yes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If   yes, describe your appearance or form apart from your body. - I felt a strong   vibration. I could think and feel but I did not have a physical solid body...if   that makes any sense at all. &nbsp;

    Did you meet or see any other beings?&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, describe. I saw a being I   believed to be myself somewhere else. I also saw another person,&nbsp;a male&nbsp;but no   face, just&nbsp;body form.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;What   was communicated? There was no communication

  Is   there anything else you would like to add concerning the experience or any   aspect of the circumstances surrounding it?&nbsp; I have read about &quot;soulmates&quot; &amp; I   always believed that this meant some type of love relationship with your &quot;twin   spirit&quot;. I no longer think this. I think that the the &quot;twin flame&quot; or spirit is   something that may not be able to be explained that &quot;we&quot;, while on earth can   understand.     </body>
