PREFACE.
AFTER a lapse of 188 years since the first pub-
lication, in 1647, of Lilly's Introduction to Astro-
logy, there would be no necessity for an apology
for its re-appearance, were it.not for the prevailing
fashion of the day, which is to rail at and vitupe-
rate that science, and all who dare to say a word,
not in its favour, but in favour of examining into
its merits, with a view to ascertain what were the
grounds on which our honest ancestors believed,
and strictly followed, that which we conceive only
:fit for ridicule. As I have long outlived the days
'!Vhen I, like many others, thought myself at liberty
to laugh at, and condemn, what I did not under-
stand ; the world will forgive me if I be bold
enough to advise·those who value truth, to spend a
· few days (and but a few days will be necessary)
in examining the principles laid down in this work,
and applying them to their own individual cases,
before they join the herd of learned and unlearned
in pledging their words to a false assertion, viz.
that Astrology is an unfounded science. If any
man will take the trouble to examine for himself,
and should find that the prejudices of his education
against the science of foreseeing the future, and

many other matters which it teaches, are in reality
well-founded, and that it has no claims to truth,
then will he have the proud satisfaction of knowing,
that his opinions on a matter of some consequence
are based on experiment, and are the result of his
own conviction, not of another person's assertion.
On the other hand, if he find truth flash with light-
ning force upon his mind, and convince him that
Astrology, notwithstanding prejudice and abuse,
is founded in nature, and is indeed a noble science,
given by a benevolent Creator to enlighten man in
his wanderings, and enable him to shun the vice
and folly which his passions throw in his path; then
will he, if a spark of piety exist within his breast,
offer thanks to that Creator for the blessing he has
discovered. In either case, he must admit that I
do him a service in putting forth' this plain and
simple means of discovering the truth.
This is cc the age of enquiry ; " and yet pr~judice
continues to press down her leaden foot upon the
neck of examination in this matter. I can only
attribute the pitiable fact to the circumstance of
there being no recent publications on those parts
of Astrology which are the most easily acquired.
The art of Nativities requires many years of
patient experimenting before it can be well under-
stood, and practised with certainty and satisfaction.
The art of Atmospherical Astrology, and also that
of Mundane Astrology, alike demand much time to
penetrate their arcana, and a good education to

follow lh~ir practice. Hence we may account for
their comparatively confined study: few have either
the abilities or the opportunity to wrestle with their
diffic~lties.
But Hormy Astrology, the chief subject in this
work, may be speedily learned by any person of
even moderate abilities; and may, as far as regards
its elementary difficulties, be mastered in a few
days' study. It may be well understood, and re-
duced to constant practice in less than a quarter of
a year, and no one will find himself at a loss for
occasions to test its reality or its utility ; for his
own avocations, and the affairs of his friends, will
offer these almost daily. If a proposition of any
nature be made to any individual, about the result
of which he is anxious, and therefore uncertain
whether to accede to it or not, let him but note the
hour and minute when it was first made, and erect
a figure of the heavens, as herein taught, and
his doubts will be instantly resolved. He may
thus, in five minutes, learn infallibly whether the
affair \viii succeed or not; and, consequently, whe:..
ther it is prudent to adopt the offer made or not.
If he examine the sign on the lst house of the
figure, the planet therein, or the planet ruling the
sign, will exactlydescribe the partymaking the o.D'er,
both in person and character; and this may at once
convince the inquirer for truth of the reality of the
principles of the science.

Moreover, the descending sign, &c., will describe
kis own person and character; a farther proof of the
truth of the science, if he require it, Here, then,
is a ready test of the truth of Astrology. Will its
adversaries dare to make its application ? It would,
methinks, be betterthan relaxing the broad muscles,
which ever denote ignorance and surprise, the feel~
ings which, combined~ are the undoubted source of
laughter; the only argument of the idiot, the ready
.resource of the ignorant.
In editing this work, my chief object has been to
render it useful to the student in Astrology, and so,
by forwarding the science, to promote the genet-al
interests of humanity.
· With this view I have re~written those parts of
the work which modem discoveries in Astronomy
and Astrology have rendered obsolete. The tables
have been omitted, as being no longer applicable to
the present obliquity of t}le ecliptic. The student
will be able to obtain those he may require at a low
price, which I published last year, to be used with
The Grammar ofAstrologJJ*. That work will com-
plete whatever may be wanting in the present; and
the student who possesses them both, will have no
difficulty in going as far into the science as he may
desire.
As regards the deviations I have made from the
• "Tables to be used in calculating Nativities." Loudon, Sher~
wood and Co. Price 2s. 6d.

rules of the author, they are few, and founded on
much experience. The chapters he has written on
nativities I have been compelled to omit, as I wished
to avoid making too large a book; and I believe,
also, that in that part of the science he was less
perfect than in any other; the reason being that
he relied on essential dignities, which are, by my
experience, of little, if any, avail in nativities. The
rules for calculating arcs of direction will be fo_
und
in the Grammar; and it being unlikely that those
who wish to practise that part of Astrology will be
without it, I thought it better to omit them in this
work.
In conclusion, I have no desire to offend any
class of men by putting forth this work : I do not
know whether I should not respect even prejudice,
for the sake of peace, were it not that I cannot con-
scientiously consent to abandon truth in the effort.
I am callous to the puny efforts of critics who may
desire to pour on me the waters of vituperation or
ridicule, having already passed through a Hood.
After many years' experience, I ·have found the
laws of Astrology unfailing; and as I can discover
no prohibition of its practice in the Word of God,
I am prepare.d to defend it against all the foolish
attacks of those who falsely declare that it upholds
fatality, or is opposed to the providence o~ the reve-
lation of the Deity. And I am contented, with
God's blessing, to give up the ghost in the firm

persuasion, that, in maintaining what I believe is the
truth in this respect, I shall meet, hereafter, through
the goodness of God and the merits of my Saviour,
with a merciful judgment.
I am, reader, your devoted friend and well-wisher
in all science which may honour God and benefit
mankind,
ZADKIEL.

LIFE OF WILLIAM LILLY.
IN offering an abstract ofthe most valuable ofthis clever
astrologer's works to the notice of the public, I consider
myselfcalled upon to make some mention of his personal
history. And it. fortunately happens that this is not made
up of imaginary ideas, founded on a few known facts, and
a multiplicity of supposi~ions; for what we know of this
man of ~xtraordinary talent rests on the best evidence.
He undertook, in his sixty-sixth year, to write a history
of his own life to his " worthy friend," Elias Ashmole,
Esq., afterwards Sir Elias Ashmole, the founder of the
celebrated museum which bears his name. Mr. Ashmole
made marginal notes therein, which testify his high opinior.
ofour Author; and, fortunately for the cause of Astrology, .
this gentleman verified the correctness of the Figures of
Heaven, which are given in the subsequent pages; for we
find the following note at the foot of page 131 :-" I de-
vised tlu! [01·ms andfashions ofthe ,,everal schemes, E. A."
This note was made after these observations of Lilly.
·,;The desire I had to benefit posterity and my country at
last overcame all difficulties; so that what I could not do in
one year, I perfected early the next year, 1647; and then in
that year, viz.1647, I finished the third book of nativities;
during the composing whereof, for seven whole weeks, I

under such awful circumstances, with a dreadful death
immediately before his eyes, with the pestilence ravaging
his own household, might, with unprejudiced rmn, have
been taken as a proof that the writer was sincere. in what
he wrote; and really believed in the truth of that which
he taught to others as truth under the solemn appeal to
Almighty God, which is so beautifully worded in his in-
troductory epistle. Modern critics, however, can see no
force in this argument, but unhesitatingly condemn William
Lilly "as an accomplished impostor, and a knavish
fortune-teller•. Such, reader, is the force of prejudice.
It will not aJJow men to examine before they condemn ; for
if it did, then would the literary wm·ld speedily acknow-
ledge the reality of those doctrines which our Author has
so ably set forth in the following pages.
William Lilly was born of an honest yeoman family, in
the town of'' Diseworth, seven miles south ·of the town of
Derby, on the first day of May, 1602." At eleven years
old he was sent to Ashby de Ia Zouch, to be instructed
by one Mr. John Brindley. Here he says he learned the
following authors, viz. Sententite Pueriles, Cato, Corderius,
.JEsop's Fables, Tul~y's Offices, Ovid de Tristibus; lastly,
Virgil, then Horace; as also Camden's Greek Grammar,
Tkeog11is, and Homer's Iliads; and entered Udall's Hebrew
Grammar. In the eighteenth year of his age his master
.. was enforced from keeping school, being persecuted by
the Bishop's officers;" and our Author was ''enforced to
leave school." He then kept school himself for ''one
quarter of a year." On Monday, April 3d, 1620, he left
Diseworth and came to London, where he was compelled to
accept the humble situation of a footboy, his father being
then, "in Leicester gaol for debt," and, of course, inca-
pable of doing much for his son. He had only seven shil-

lings and sixpence left when he arrived at London, having
.. footed it all along" with the carrier. In 1624 his mis-
tress died, having given him '' five pounds in old gold."
After which he lived "most comfortably," his master
having a great affection for him. In 1626 his master married
again, having first settled on our Author twenty pounds
a year, which he enjoyed all ·through life. In October
1627 he was made free of the Salters' Company. And on
the ''eighth day of September, 1627," married his master's
widow, this same lady; and they " lived very lovingly"
until her death, October 1633.
In the year 1632 he began to study Astrology, being in-
structed in the rudiments by one Evans, a Welshman, of
indifferent abilities. Lilly tells us that he applied himsel(
to these interesting studies," many times, twelve, or fifteen,
or eighteen hours, day and night;'' adding, " I was cu-
rious to discover whether there was any verity in the art
or not." By this his first wife he acquired a fortune of
" very near to one thousand pounds., In the year 1634.
he purchased the moiety of thirteen houses in the Strand,
for which he gave £530. The figure ofthe heavens erected
on this occasion will be found in the following pages.
November the 18th, 1634, he married again, and had £500
portion with th11t wife. '' She was of the natut·e of Mars,"
and he lived not very lovingly with her, as seems by his
observations at her death. He appears to have now prac-
tised horary astrology with success, and to have instructed
numerous individuals in the art; among others he taught
.John Humphreys, in the year 1640, for which service he
received forty pounds. He also wrote, in the year 1639,
a Treatise on the Eclipse of the Sun, May 22J, 1639; and
appears, about that period, to have turned his attention
much to Mundane Astrology. He says•," I did carefully,

in 1642 and 164.1, take notice of every grand action which
happened betwixt king and parliament; and did first then
incline to believe, that, as all sublunary affairs did depend
upon superior causes, so there was a possibility of dis-
covering them by the configurations of the superior bodies ;
in which way making some essays in those two y~ars, I
found encouragement to proceed further, which I did : I
perused the writings of the ancients, but therein they were
silent, or gave no satisfaction ; at last, I framed unto my-
self that method which then and since I follow, which I
hope, in time, may be more perfected by a more penetrating
person than myself."
He appears to have dabbled a little in magic also, but
be soon "grew weary of such employment," and burned
his books. Lilly's better sense led him to perceive which
of these studies was worthy of an honest and intelligent
man's pursuit, and which not.
About April 1644, be first published Merlinus .Anglicus
Junior. This work contained some of his most remarkable
predictions, and was continued for many years. It at-
tracted much attention, and was the means of adding
greatly to the fame of our Author as an Astrologer. In·
that year be printed the White King's Prophecy,'' ofwhich
were sold, in three days, eighteen hundred;" and some
other works of like nature, the P1·ophetical Merlin, &c.
In 1645 he was twice had before a Committee of the
Parliament for some observations in his Starrg Messenger;
but he escaped, partly by means of his numet·ous friends,
and partly by his own ingenuity.
In 1647, when be published the present work, he was
introduced to General Fairfax, who paid him and his art
some compliments. In this year he was consulted by King
Charles I as to a safe place to conceal his royal person;
but the King, unfortunately for himself, neglected Lilly's

advice,_
and was accordingly ruined. Again, in 1648 the
King consulted Lilly ; but though he promised to take the
Astrologer's advice, and come up to London with the Com-
missioners, he did not, however, keep his.word, and again
lost a good opportunity of escaping from his evil destiny.
"In this year," says Lilly, "for very great considera-
tions, the council ofstate gave me in money fifty pounds,and
a pension of one hundred pounds per annum, which for
two years I received, but no more." In January 1649 he
was present at the tl'ial of King Charles, " who spoke,"
says he, " excellently well."
In 1651 he published Monarchy or No Monarchy, which
contained several hieroglyphics; among others those of the
great plague and fire of London, which the reader will find
a copy of in this work.
These celebrated predictions were made by means of the
motions of the fixed stars, as is evident by the words ofLilly;
who says, "the asterisms and signs and constellations give
greatest light thereunto." The Bulfs North Horn, a star
which, Ptolemy says, is ''like Mars," was, in the year 1666,
when the fire occurred, in u 17° 54', which is the exact as-
cendant of London• .It was, no doubt, by this means Lilly
judged the city would suffer by fire; for in his Almanac for
1666 he states, that the 19th degree of u is London's horo-
scope. Our Author was not very nice in his calculations; and
it may be observed, that though it may be called the 19th
degree, being within 6 minutes of it, yet, in reality, u
1 7 54' is the true ascendant of London. It was that
which ascended at the moment of driving thefirst pile of
the new London Bridge.

it gives the year when that evil star was crossing the
ascending sign of London. And as it is of the fteNJ nature
of Mars, we need not be surprised that it produced such
terrific results. The celebrated Nostradamus bad predicted
the same event in that year, about 111 years previously, as
follows:- ~
" Le sang du juste aLondres fera faute
Bruslez par feu, de vingt et trois, lea six.''
The blood of the just, which has been spilt in London,
requires it to be burned with fire in sixty-six. He states
that he made this prediction by "Astronomical Affections."
In 1651 Lilly was again had before the Parliament, on
account of his predictions, and was thirteen days in the
custody of the Serjeant at Arms. But the prediction which
gave offence, viz. that the'' Parliament. stood upon a totter-
ing foundation, and that the commonalty and soldiery would
join together against them," was amply fulfilled by the
members being turned out of doors by Oliver Cromwell.
In February 1654 his second wife died; and in October
following he mat·tied a third, signified. in his nativity, "by
Jupite1· in Libra; and," says be, "she is so totally in her
conditions, to my great comfort."
In 1655 he was indicted at Hicks's Hall by a half-
witted young woman. The cause of the indictment was,
that he had given judgment upon stolen goods, and received
two shillings and sixpence ; contmry to an act made in
King James's time.
" I owned," says he, "the taking of half-a-crown for

my judgment of the theft, but said, that I gave no other
judgment but that the goods would not be recovered, ·being
that was all which was required of me. I spoke for my-
self, and introduced my own Introduction into court, saying,
that I had some years before emitted that book for the
benefit of this and other nations ; that it was allowed by
authority, and had found good acceptance in both Universi-
ties; that the study of Astrology was lawful, and not con-
tradicted by any scripture; that I neither had, or ever did,
use any charms, sot·ceries, or inchantments related in the
bill of indictment, &c.· The jury, who went not from the
bar, brought in, No true BilL"
" In 1666 happened,'' says our Author, "that miracu-
lous conflagration in the city of London, whereby, in four
days,·the most part thereof was consumed by fire." He
then gives an account of his being brought before the House
of Commons by the following summons :-
MONDAY, 22d OCTOBER, 1666.
'' At the Committee appointed to enquire after the causes
of the late fires :-
.. ORDERED,
'' That M1·. Lilly do attend this Committee on Friday
next, being the 25th of October, 1666, at two of the clock
in the afternoon, in the Speaker.,s chamber, to answer such
questions as shall be then and there asked him.
" RoBERT BRooKE."
In remarking on the circumstance he says, " I conceive
there was never more civility used unto any than unto my
self; and you know there was no small number of parlia-
ment men appeared, when they heard I was to be there."

" Sir Robert Brooke spoke to this purpose:-
''-' Mr. Lilly, this Committee thought fit to summon you
to appear before them this day, to know, if you can say
any thing as to the cause of the late fire, or whether there
might be any design therein. ·You are called the rather
hither, because, in a book of your's long since printed, you
hinted some such thing by one of youl' hieroglyphics.' Unto
which I replied,
'' May it please your lionours,
u After the beheading of the late King, considering that
in the . three subsequent years -the parliatnent acted
nothing which concerned the settlement of the nation's
peace, and seeing the generality of the people dissatil\fied,
the citizens of London discontented, the soldiery prone to
mutiny, I was desirous, according to the best knowledge
God had given me, to make enquiry by the art I studied,
what might, from that time, happen unto the parliament
ond nation in general. At last, having satisfied myself as
well as I could, and perfected my judgment therein, I
thought it most convenient to aignify my intentions and
conceptions thereof in fot·ms, ~ohapes, types, hierogly-
phicks, &c., without any commentary, that so my judgment
might be concealed from the vulgar, and made manifest
only unto the wise; I herein imitating the examples of many
wise philosophel's who had done the like. Having found,
Sir, that the city of london should be sadly afBicted with
a great plague, and not long after with an exhorbitant fire,
I.framed these two hieroglyphicks, as represented in the
book, which, in effect, have pt'oved very true."
"Did you foresee the year?" said one.-" I did not,"
said I, u or was desirous; of that I made no scrutiny."
"I proceeded:-' Now, Sir, whether there was any design
of burf!ing the city, or any employed to that put'pose,

LU'E OJ:o' WII.LIAl\1 LILLY. 9
I must deal ingenuously with you ; that, since the fire,
I have taken much pains inthe search thereof, but cannot
or could not give myself any the least satisfaction therein.
I conclude that it was the finger of God only; but what
instruments he used thereunto I am ignorant.'
"The Committee seemed well pleased with what I spoke,
and dismissed me with great civility."
After this nothing very remarkable happened to our
Author. He left London, having acquired an independ-
ence, and settled at Hersham-, in the year of the great
plague, 1665. He then applied himself diligently to the
study of physic, and on the 11th October, 1670, here-
ceived a licence to practise as a physician. He continued
to practise with much success, no doubt by applying his
astrological science thereto; and he gave his advice and
prescriptions freely· without money. His skill and his
charity gained him extraordinary credit and estimation.
He continued generally in good health till August 1674;
but his health and his eyesight remained very weak after-
wards. He still continued to write his monthly observa-
tions and astrological judgments, though latterly by aid of
an amanuensis (Mr. Henry Colley, who succeeded him as
an a&trologer), even until the year 1682.
In the beginning of 1681 he was seized with a flux,
which he recovered from, but then became totally blind.
The 30th of 1\'lay of that year he was seized with a dead
palsy ; and, after some days of severe suffering, he died
about three o'clock on the morning of the 9th of June,
1681, " without any shew of trouble or pangs." .
He was b.uried in the chancel of Walton Church, his
friend, Sir Elias Ashmole, assisting.at the laying him in his
grave,. which was " on the left side of the communion
table."

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
CHAPTER I.
THERE are in the heavens several bodies which appea1·
to shed their light directly on this Earth; and also some
others which, having no light of themselves, serve to reflect
that of the Sun, and thereby become visible to our organs
of sight. The former are termed Fixed Stars, because they
appear to retain the same situation, or to be fixed in the
. same place; but the latter, being observed to wander, are
termed Planets. Thenumber and distance of the former
are so extensive, that I shall take no further notice of them
here, than to observe, that they are not much used in that
portion of Astrology which is denominated Horary, and
that those persons who desire to make use of them in nati-
vities will find their right ascensions and declinations
given with great accuracy in the Nautical Almanac for
each year. In the Appendix to this work I shall give rules
to ascertain their latitude and longitude by trigonometry,
for the benefit ofsuch persons as may be curious to make ex·
periments as to their influence; though I do not, in gene-
ral, pay much attention to them when judging a nativity.

Egypt. But as the object of this work is practical utility,
no more need be said on the subject.
The Signs of the Zodiac.
They are twelve, each containing 30 degrees, thus mak-
ing 360 degrees, into which every great circle is divided.
The first six are,
Northern Signs.
¥ Aries, ts Taurus, n Gemini, 28 Cancer, .n.. Leo,
t1Jt Virgo.
Southern Signs.
A Libra, nt Scorpio, t Sa:gittary, l:f Capricorn, :::
Aquarius, )( Pisces.
The first sign, 'Y', commences the zodiac, its beginning
being that spot in the heavens where the Sun is when
crossing the equator in spring; and the latter sign, )(,
finishes the circle of the zodiac, the latter end of it being
that spot in the heavens where the Sun is when be has
gone his round, and is again about t9 enter 'Y'.
By referring to the annexed diagram, the student will
perceive, that when the Sun enters ¥ (about the 21st of
March) he proceeds northward, and increases in declinatioll
until he reaches the tropic of 2;; Cancer (about the 21st of
June), when he speedily begins to return to the south; and
when he reaches A, he again crosses the equator (about
the 23d of September), where, having no declination, he
causca equal day and night all over the world. He then
declilles awag to the south ; shortening our days in the
northern hemisphere, until he reaches the southern tropic
l:f, Capricorn ; at length he returns towards the equator,
and crosses it by entering the sign ~ (about the 21st of
March), where again he has no declination, and gives
equal days and nights.

The student must become well acquainted with the above
particulars ; but especially s~ with the northern and
southern signs,. the former being opposite to the latter.
By attending to this he will readily come to understand
the figure of the heaven11, and the relative situations of the
planets.
N. B. The moveable, common, and fixed signs are
always in square aspect to each other, three signs apart;
and the fiery, earthy, airy, and watery signs are always in
trine aspect to each other, four signs apart.
THE DRAGON:s HEAl). AND TAIL.
The Moon's north node is known by the character Q,
termed the Dragon's Head ; and her south node by this ~,
termed the Dragon's Tail. The former of these in horary
quest.ions denotes good, and is considered of the character
of U, and increases the good qualities of a benefic, with
which it may be found; and diminishes the evil of a malefic
planet. The latter is of the nature of l;> , and does the
reverse. In nativities these characters have no avail, and
are not to be considered except with regard to the Moon,
who is found to produce good or evil when she reaches ·
them by direction •.

This is that spot in the heavens which is equally dis-
tant from the degree ascending that the Moon is from the
Sun. It is found by the following rule:-
To find the (EB) Part of Fvrtune in a Nativity.
Add 90° to the right ascension of the meridian, and it
will give the oblique ascension of the ascendant. From
the oblique ascension of the ascendant subtract the oblique
ascension ofthe Sun (having first added 360° to the former
if necessary) ; to the remainder add the right ascension of
the Moon : the sum will be the right ascension of EB·
The (9 is always under the horizon before the full Moon,
and above the horizon after the full Moon. Having found
its right ascension, take it from that of the meridian above

In horary astrology $ is merely a symbol, and has
much to do with all questions regarding property, loss or

follows:-
Add together the longitude of the ascendant and the

of the opposite signs of the zodiac; the 7th being opposite
to the 1st, the 8th to the 2d, &c. If the student look for
s ()0 0' on the lOth house in the table of houses for London,
he will find the longitude of the six eastern houses, as here
noted •; and, of course, the six opposite or u'estern houses
have the same degrees of the opposite signs on their cusps.
OF EREC'TING A FIGURE OF"THE HEAVENS.
Tn1sis merely a map to represent the heavens at any par-
ticular moment, such as when a child is born, or a question
asked, &c. In the first place, draw three circles, as in
figure 1; and then draw lines to represent the horizon,
and others, at right angles with them, to represent the
meriaian : thus will be shewn, the natural divisions formed
by the rising and setting of the Sun, and by his passing
the meridian at noon and midnight. Each ofthese quarters
or quadmnts is to be again divided into three equal parts,
forming
The Twelve Houses.
These are marked from No. 1 to No. 12; and it will Le
observed, that the double lines Land 7, which represent the
eastern and western horizons, and those marked 4 and 10,
which represent themeridians below and above the Earth, are
the cusps or commencements ofthe angles. Those lines num-
bered 2, 5, 8, and 11, are the cuspsofthe succeedents, so called
because they follow or succeed to the angles. These houses
are next in power to the angles. Those lines marked 3, 6,
9, and 12 are the cusps or beginnings of the cade11t houses ;
so called because they are cadent, that is, falling fmm the
angles: these are the weakest of all the houses.
Thus the student will perceive, that if a planet, &c. he
in one of the angles, it is powerful; if in a succeedent house,
it is less powerful; and if in a cadent house, it is weak and
incapable of effecting much either good or evil.

Rule to erect the Figure ofthe Heavens at ang Time.
I. Learn in an ephemeris • for the year what was the
right ascension of 0 at the noon previous to the required
time, in hours, minutes, and seconds. To this right ascen-
sion add the number of hours and minutes which have
elapsed since that noon t : the sum will be the right ascen-
sion in time of the meridian above the Earth (the mid-
heaven) at the required time.
2. Find the longitude answering to this ri~ht ascen.
sion, in the column,marked lOth house in the Table of
Houses, which longitude is to be marked over the line
which denotes the mid-heaven or lOth house.
3. In a line with this will be found the longitude on the
cusps of the 11th, 12th, 1st, 2d, and 3d houses; which
copy out from the table, and enter over the lines which
denote those respective houses.
4. Having thus completed the six eastern houses, find the
signs and degrees exactly opposite to each of them, and
enter it over the cusps of the opposite or western houses,
in the following order :
lOth house

5. Having thus completed the figure, as far as regards
the signs of the zodiac, it now remains to place in the
planets as they may be situated. The most distant from
the 0 is fA, whose longitude is generally given in the
ephemeris fot• each ten days, and if the time of the figure

longitude is found, write it in the figure, thus, Jot 13° 19',
just by the cusp of the house, which falls in the same
sign in which JA is found. If the cusp be farther on than
the planet in the sign, place the planet outside the cusp ;
but if the planet be the farthest advanced in the sign,
place it inside the cusp. After having entered W

find the exact longitude of these seven, which is usually

the proportional part for the time after the previous noon,
and add it to, (or if the planet be retrograde subtract it
fi·om), the planet's longitude for the previous noon.
6. Find the longitude of Q in the same manner, and
enter it accordingly, and place ~ in the sign and degree
and minute exactly opposite thereto.
7. If it be a horary question, calculate the place of $,
and enter it accordingly; when the figure of heaven will
be complete. But if it be a nativity, you must calculate
the e according to the rule given, first having prepared a
Speculum, or Table of Data, as taught in Chap. 9 of the
Grammar of Astrology'*'.
CHAPTER III.
OF THE ASPECTS.
Tu E figure of the heavens being erected, it now remains to
observe how the planets are situated as regards each
other; or, in other words, how they are aspected. And,
first,

Of Zodiacal Aspects.
These are as follow :-
Semi *, a Semi-sextile, or 30 -degrees.
Semi o, a Semi-square, or 45 degrees.
*,a Sextile, or 60 degrees.
A Quintile, or distance of 72 degrees.
0 a Square, or quartile, 90 degrees.
A a Trine, or distance of 120 degrees.
A Sesquiquadrate, or square and a half, 135 degrees.
A Biquintile, or double quintile, 144 degrees.
8 an Opposition, 180 degrees.
Good aspects are the semi-sextile, sextile, quintile,
trine, and biquintile.
Evil aspects are the semi-square, square, sesquiquad-
rate, and opposition.-N. B. The conjunction, marked
thus .S , is when two planets are in the same degree and
minute of the zodiac : when it is exact, it is very powerful,
and is called a partile 0 ; but if within the planets' orb~,
it is called a platic conjunction, and is less powerful. To
know whether it should be considered at all, the orbs of
the two planets should be added together, and one-half the
sum taken ; if the planets be beyond that distance, they
are not even in platic 0 . The same holds good with re•
gard to other aspects.
The orbs of the cusps of the houses are 50, so that if a
planet be one-half its orb and 50 more distant from a
house, it is not in aspect to that house; the same if the
aspect of the planet fall beyond that distance from the
cusp of any other bouse.

ne Aspects.
These are formed by the houses in horary astrology,
and by the semi-arcs of the planets in nativities. Thus,
a semi * is 1 house ; a semi 0 , ll; a *,2 houses ; a
:1, 3 . houses; a 6, 4 houses; a sesqui o, 4l houses;
and an 8 , 6 houses.
The i of a semi-arc is a semi * ; the l of a semi-arc is
a semi o ; the i of a semi-arc is a * ; the whole semi-
arc is a o ; and t less than the semi-arc is a quintile ;
the whole semi-arc and i more is a l:l. ; the whole semi-
arc and l more is a sesqui 0 ; the n part of a semi-arc
added to a sesqui o, is a biquintile.-N. B. The entil·e
arc of a planet, or double the semi-arc, will not give the
measure of its distance from the opposite point of its place ;
but if the two semi-arcs of a planet, both diurnal and noc-
turnal, be added together, they make 18(}0, an opposition
aspect.
Of Parallels.
The Zodiacal Parallel is when two planets have the
same amount of declination from the equator. It is the
most powerful of all aspects, but is not generally used in
horary astrology.
The Mundane Parallel is an equal distance from the
meridian. It is used by some horary astrologers. When
any of the above aspects are formed between the planets,
they are found to have a mutual influence or action on
each other, according to the nature of 'the aspect. For
example: if the 0 be 60 degrees (a*) from ~ in any
figure, it denotes that the person signified by the Sun is
under the benefic influence of the benevolent ~ ; and shews
success according to the nature of the question. In nati-
vities it causes good health and good fortune in life. But
if 0 be !10 de~rees (a o) from ~, it shews discredit, a

failure of hopes, &c. in a question; and in anativity it
produces much sickness to the native, and also misfortunes
to his father. This was verified in the nativity of Napoleon
Bonaparte's son, ~ho was hom at 9h. 15m. A.M.
20th March, 1811, when 0 was in 280 5-3' of)(, and }]
was in 2()0 28' of t ; just 920 25' distant from each other.
This very close 0 aspect of 0 and }] caused great trouble
to the native, through his father's misfortunes ; and, as 0
was the hyleg, produced a consumptive disease, and
early death. It is remarkable, that his father's troubles
began immediately after his bitth ; and it will always he
found in the nativity of a child, that the fortune of its
parents may be ascertained thereby until the birth of ano-
ther child. If, for example, the child have evil planets in
the fourth house, its father will be more or less unfortunate
until the birth of another child; when, if that other have
1f. and ~ in the fourth house, the father's affairs will
become more fortunate : so very beautifully do the nativities
of parents and their children sympathize together.
CHAPTER IV.
OF THE TWELVE HOUSES, THEIR NATURE AND
SIGNIFICATION.
As before we have said there are twelve signs, and also
twelve houses of heaven ; so now we are come to relate the
nature of these twelve houses, the exact knowledge of
which is so requisite, that he who learns the nature of the
planets and signs without exact judgment of the houses,
is like an improvident man, that furnishes himself with a
variety of household stuff, having no place wherein to be-
stow them. There is nothing appertaining to the life of

INTlWDUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. Z'/
man in this world which, in one way or other, hath no re-
lation to one of the twelve houses of heaven; and as the
twelve signs are appropriate to the particular members of
man's body, so also do the twelve houses represent, not
only the several parts of man, but his actions, quality of
life, and living. And the curiosity and judgment of our
forefathers in astrology was such, that they have allotted
to every house a particular signification; and so distin-
guished human accidents • throughout the whole twelve
houses. He that understands the questions appertaining
to each of them, shall not want sufficient grounds whereon
to judge or give a rational answer upon any contingent
accident, and success thereof.
Of tht> FmsT House, and its Signification t.
The first house contains all that part of heaven- from the
line where the figure 1 stands unto the figure 2, where
the second house begins : it is one-third of the distance
between the horizon and meridian below the earth. It
has signification of the life of man, of the stature, colour,
complexion, form, and shape of him that propounds the
question, or is hom ; in eclipses and great conjunctions,
and upon the Sun his annual ingress into cr ; it signifies
the common people, or general state of that kingdom
where the figure is erected. And as it is the first house,
it represents the head and face of man ; so that if either
~ or ~ be in this house, either at the time of a question
or at the time of birth, you may observe some•blemish in
the facet. or in that member appropriated to the sign that
• The term accident1 here signifies the events of life generally.

is then upon the cusp of the house ; as, if ¥ be in the as..
cendant, the mark, mole, or scar is, without fail, in the head
or face; and if few degrees of the sign ascend, the mark is
in the u~per part of the head; if the middle of the sign be
on the cusp, the mole, mark, or scar is in the middle of the
face, or near it; if the latter degrees.ascend, the face is
blemished near the chin, towards the neck; this I have
found true in hundreds of examples. Of colours, it hath
the white; that is, if a planet be in this bouse that has
s.ignification of white, the complexion of the party is more
pale or wan; or, if you inquire after the colour of the
clothes of any man, if his significator be in the first house,
and in a sign corresponding, the party's apparel is white or
grey' or somewhat near that colour : so also if the question
be regarding cattle, when their significators are found in
this house, it denotes them to be of that colour, or near it:
the house is masculine. The consignificators of this house
are ·ryoand ~ :for as this bouse is thefirst house, so is ¥ the
first sign, and~ the first of the planets; and therefore, when
~ is but moderately well-fortified in this house, and in any
benevolent a!>pect of ~, !i , 0, or D, it promises a good
sober constitution of body, and usually long life; ~ doth
also joy in this house, because it represents the head, and
he the tongue, fancy, and memory: when he is well digm-
fied and posited in this house, he produces good orators •:
it is called the Ascendant, because when the 0 and planets
come to the cusp of this house, they ascend, or then arise,
and are visible in our horizon.
Questions concerning the SECOND House.
From this house is required judgment concerning the
estate or fortune of him that asks the question, of his

born with ~ just rising.

wealth or property, of all moveable goods, money lent, of
profit or gain, loss or damage; in suits of law, it signifies
a man's friends or assistants; in private duels, the querents
second; in an eclipse or great conjunction, the poverty or
wealth of the people; in the Sun .his entrance,into <'f', it
represents the ammunition, allies, and support the com-
monwealth shall have: it imports their magazines. It re-
presents, in man, the neck and hinder part of it towards the
shoulders; of colours, the green. It is a feminine house,
and succeedent.
It has consignificators, 'lf. and ~ ; for if 'lf. be placed in
this house, or be lord hereof, it is an argument of an estate
Ol' fortune ; 0 and ~ are never well placed in this house:
either of them shew dispersion of substance, according to
the capacity llnd quality of him that is either born or asks
the question •.
The THIRD House
Has signification of brethren, sisters, cousins, or kin-
dred, neighbours, small journeys, or inland journeys, often
removing from one place to ~nother; epistles, letters, ru-
mours, messengers : ·it rules the shoulders, arms, hands,
and fingers. Of colours, it governs the red and yellow,
or sorrel colour; it has consignificators, n and ~ , which
is one reason why ~ in this house, unless joined with ll ,
is not very unfortunate : it is a cadent house, and is the joy
of the ]) ; for if she be posited therein, especially in a move-
able sign, it is an arg'ument of much travel, trotting, and
trudging, or of being seldom quiet: the house is masculine. '

profit or loss got thereby ; sickness, its quality and cause ;
the principal humour offending, curable or not curable ;
whether the disease be short or long; day-labourers, tenants,
farmers, shepherds, hogherds, neatherds, warreners, and it
signifies uncles, or the father's brothers and sisters. It
rules the inferior part of the belly and intestines, even to
the rectum. This house is a feminine and cadent house,
unfortunate as having no aspect to the ascendant. Of

The EIGHTH House.
The estate of men deceased; d~ath, its quality and
nature ; the wills, legacies, and testaments of men deceased;
dowry of the wife, portion of the maid, whether much or
little, easy to be obtained or with difficulty. In duels, it
represents the adversary's second ; in law suits, the

it signifies fear and anguish of mind • ; also who shall be
heir to the deceased. It rules the privy parts. Of colours,
the green and black. Of signs, it has nt for consignifica-
tor and ~ . The hemorrhoids, the stone, strangury, and
bladder, are ruled by this house, also poisons; it is a succee-
dent house, and feminine.
The NINTH House.
By this house we give judgment of· voyages or long
journies beyond seas, of religious men, or clergy ofany kind,
whether bishops or ~nferior ministers; dreams, visions,
foreign countries, books, learning, church livings or bene-
fices, and of the kindred of one's wife or husband. Of
colours, it has the green and white; of man's body, it
rules the fundament, the hips, and thighs ; 1f. and ~ are
consignificators of this house ; for if 1f. be herein placed, it
naturally signifies a devout man in his religion, or one

The TENTH House.
Commonly it personates kings, princes, dukes, earls,
judges, prime officers, commanders-in-chief, whether in

thority, also mothers; honour, preferment, dignity, office,
lawyers, professions or trade; it also signifies kingdoms,

science, nativities, in which the planets are crtuaea (under God) of
events, and hurary questions, in which they are only signs or the
events, has been the chief means of !>ringing this sublime science into
disrepute. This error appears to have arisen from the low state and
condition of astronomy in the middle ages, when, even as late as the
days of Charles IT, Dr. Goad, his physician, assures us that the astro-
nomers could not calculate an opposition of the planets 1f. and J,
nearer than a week. How, then, can it be expected thnt thejudgmenta

allies ; ·theia· mo~ey, exchequer or treasure ; in war, ammu-
nition and soldiery, it represents courtiers, &.c. In a com-
monwealth, governed by a few of the nobles and com-
mons, it personates their assistance in council ; as, in
London, the tenth house represents the lord mayor; the
eleventh, the common council, the ascendant the generality
of the commoners ofthe said city. Of members, it rules the
legs to the ancles; of colours, saffron or yellow. It has 0
and ::: for consignificators : 'lf. especially rejoices in this
house. It is a succeedent house, and masculine, and in
virtue is nearly equivalent either to the seventh or fourth
house.
The TWEI.FTH House.
It has signification of private enemies, great cattle, or
horses, oxen, elephants, &c.; sorrow, tribulation, imprison-
ment, all manner of affiiction, self-undoing, &c; and of
such men as maliciously undermine their neighbours, or
inform secretly against them. It has consignificators )(

is naturally the author of mischief. It rules, in man's
body, the feet. In colour it represents the green. It is a
cadent house, and feminine.
This is the tl'Ue character of the several houses, accord-
ing to the Ptolomeian doctl'ine, and the experience I have
had myself for many years. I must confess the Arabians
have made several other divisions of the houses; but I
could never, in my practice, find any verity in them;

CHAPTER V.
OF SATURN, AND HIS SIGNIFICATION.
IIE is the supremest oa·highest of all the planets•, and
is placed between Jupiter and the firmament ; he is not very
bright or glorious, nor does he twinkle or sparkle, but is
of a pale or wan ashy colour ; slow in motion, finishing his
course through the twelve signs of the zodiac in 29 years
167 days and 5 hours, or thereabouts. His mean motion
is two minutes and one second ; his diurnal motion some-
times is three, tour, five, or six minutes, seldom more; his
greatest north latitude from the ecliptic is 2 degrees 48 mi-
nutes; his greatest south latitude is 2 degrees 49 minutes.
In the zodiac he has t-wo of the twelve signs for his
houses ; viz. Capricorn J:f, his night house; Aquarius :::
his day house. He is exalted in ~, recciyes his fall in cr,
and rejoices in the sign Aquarius, :::. He governs the
airy triplicity by day, which is composed of a, ~. :::.
If in any question he be in any degree wherein he has .a
term, he cannot be said tQ be peregrine, or void of essential
dignities; o1· if he he in any of those degrees allotted him
for his face or decanate, he cannot then be said to be pere-
grine : understand this in all the other planetst.
He continues retrograde 140 days ; is five days in his
first stage bt:fOI-e retrogradation, and so many in his second
station before becoming direct. He is cold and· dry
(being far removed from the Sun); melancholy, earthy,
masculine; and the greater infortune, author of solitari-
ness, malevolent, &.c.
,. This was true, all far all the author knew; the planet Herschel
not having been then discovered.

ing desire to rule and sway wherever he comes. Prudent,
and of incomparable judgment; of great majesty and state-
liness, industrious to acquire honour and a large patrimony,
yet as willing to spend it again. The solar man usually
speaks with gravity, but not many words, and these with
great confidence and command of his own feelings ; full of
thought, secret, trusty, speaks deliberately, and, notwith-
standing his great heart, he is affable, tractable, and very
humane to all people; one loving sumptuousness and mag-
nificence, and whatever is honourable ; no sordid thoughts

of good heart; healthful constitution ; very humane, yet
sufficiently spirited, and not loquacious.

CHAPTER X.
OF MERCURY, AND HIS SIGNIFICATION, NATURE, AND
PROPERTY.
MERCURY is the least of all the planets, never distant
from the Sun above 28 degrees; by which reason he is
seldom visible to our sight.
Colour and Motion.-He is of a dusky silver colour;
his mean motion is 59 minutes and 8 seconds, but he is
sometimes so swift, that he moves above 1 degree and 40
minutes in one day. He is stationary one day, retrograde
twenty-four days. His year is 87 days and 23 hours.
Lalitude.-His greatest south latitude is 3 degrees 35
minutes, greatest north latitude 3 degrees 33 minutes.
Nature.- We may not call him either masculine or
feminine, for he is either the one or the other as joined to
any planet ; for if in cS with a masculine planet, he becomes
masculine •; if with a feminine, then feminine; but of his
own nature he is cold and dry, and therefore melancholy :
with the good he is good, with the evil planets, ill ; he is
author of subtlety, tricks, devices, perjury, &c•
.Manners when welt diguijied.-Being well dignified, he
represents a man of a subtle and political brain and intellect,
an excellent disputant or logician, arguing with learning
and discretion, and using much eloquence in his speech; a
searcher into all kinds ofmysteries and learning, sharp and
witty, learning almost any thing without a teacher; am-
bitious of being exquisite in every science, desirous na-
turally to travel and see foreign parts; a man of an un-
wearied fancy, cUJious in the search ofany occult knowledge,
able by his own genius to produce wonders, given to divi-
nation and the more secret knowledge. If he turn merchant,
"This applies to aspectti also; but, of course, only in horary questions.
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 4!)
no man exceeds him in way of trade, or invention of new
ways whereby to obtain wealth.
Manners when ill dignified.-A troublesome wit, a kind
of phrenetic man, his tongue and pen against every man ;
wholly bent to fool his estate and time in loquacity and
trying nice conclusions to no'purpose, a great lial', boaster,
prattler, busybody; false; a tale-carrier, addicted to wicked
arts, as necromancy, and such like ungodly knowledges;
easy of belief, an ass or very idiot, constant in no place or
opinion, cheating and thieving everywhere; a newsmonger,
pretending all manner ofknowledge, but void oftrue or solid
learning; a trifler, a mere frantil} fellow : if he prove a divine,
then a mere verbal fellow, frothy, of no judgment, easily
perverted, constant in nothing but idle words and bragging.
Corporature.- Generally he denotes one of an high
stature, and straight, thin, spare body; a high forehead
and somewhat narrow long face,long nose, fair eyes, neither
perfectly black nor grey, thin lips and nose, little hair on
the chin, but much on his head, and ofa sad brown inclin-
ing to blackness; long arms, fingers, and hands; his com-
plexion li~e an olive or chesnut colour. You must observe
~ more than all the planets; for having any aspect to a
planet, he partakes more of the influence of that planet
than any other does: if with J,, then heavy; with 'J.l., more
temperate; with ~ , more rash ; with 0, more genteel ;
with ~ , more jesting; with ]) , more changeable.
01'iental.-When he is oriental, his complexion is honey
colour, or like one sunburnt; in the stature o{ his body
not very high, but welljointed; small eyes, not much hair;
in very truth, acc01·ding to the height of body, very well
composed, but still a defect in the complexion, swarthy
brown, and in the tongue all for his own interest.
Occidental.-When occidental, a tawny visage, lank

17 minutes. Her greatest south latitude 5 degrees and 12

chanic, the mim learns many occupations, and frequently

CHAPTER XII.
The Head ofthe Dragon.-The Head of the Dragon is
masculine, of the nature of 'lf. and ~ , and of himself a
fortune t.
• Generally all persons who are connected with liquids in their oc-
cupation.
t These points are of no consequence in nativities, except as regards
the 1\foon, wbo brings benefits when she reaches the Q in the zodiac
by directional motion, and evil when she reaches the ~.

INTRODUCTION TO ASTltoLOGY. 53
The Tail of the Dragon.-The Tail of the Dragon by
nature is quite contrary to the Head, for he is evil. I ever
found the Q equivalent to eithe1· of the fortunes, and, when
joined with the evil planets, to lessen their malevolent sig-
nification ; when joined with the good, to increase the good
promised by them. The Tail of the Dragon, I always, in
my practice, found, when he was joined with the evil
planets, their malice or the evil intended thereby was
doubled and trebled, or extremely augmented, &c.;. and
when he chanced to be in conjunction with any of the for-
tunes who were significators in the question, though the
matter by the principal significator was fairly promised and
likely to be perfected in a small time, yet did there ever
fall out many rubs and disturbances, much wrangling and
controversy, that the business was many times given over
for desperate before a perfect conclusion could be had ; and
unless the principal significators were angular, and well
fortified with essential dignities, many times unexpectedly
the whole matter came to nothing.
CHAPTER XIII.
ANOTHER BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ~HE- SHAPES AND
FORMS OF THE PLANETS.
Herachel.-Tu1s is the most distant planet from the Sun;
his motion is very slow, as he takes 83 years 151 days to
go through the twelve signs. The nature of \1 is extremely
evil. · If he ascend or be with the chief significator in any
figure, he denotes an eccentric person, far from fortunate,
always abrupt and often violent in his manners. If well
aspected, he gives sudden and unexpected benefits; and if
affiicted, he will cause remarkable and uulooked-for losses

54 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
and misfortunes. He is not so powerful as Saturn or Mars,
yet can do much evil. Persons under his influence are partial
to antiquity, astrology, &c., and all uncommon studies,
especially if Mercury and the Moon be in aspect to him.
They are likely to strike out novelties, and to be remarkable
for an inventive faculty. They are generally unfortunate
in marriage, especially if he affiict ~ , the ]) , or the seventh
house, either in nativities ot· questions.
Saturn-Signifies one of a swarthy colour, palish like
lead, or of a black earthly brown ; one of rough skin, thick
and very hairy on the body, small eyes; many times his
complexion is between black and yellow, or as if he had au
affection of the black or yellow jaundice; he is lean,
crooked, or beetle-browed ; a thin weak beard; great lips,
like negroes; he looks to the ground •, is slow in motion,
either is bow-legged or hits one leg or knee against another ;
most part a disagreeable breath, seldom free from a cough;
he is crafty for his own interest, seducing people to his
opinion ; full of revenge and malice, little caring for religion ;
is a foul, nasty, slovenly knave, or a harlot, a great eater
and glutton, a brawling fellow; has broad, great shoulders;
is covetous, and yet seldom rich, &ct.
Jupiter.-We must describe 1{. and a jovialist to be one
of a comely stature, full faced, full eyed, a sanguine com-
plexion, or mixture of white and red ; a large space be-
tween his eyebrows; usually his beard is of a flaxen or
sandy-flaxen colour; sometimes also, when 1{. is combust,
very sad or black ; his hair thick, his eyes not black ; good
broad, well-set teeth, but usually some r.nark of difference
in the two fore teeth, either by their standing awry, or
• Thi& downward look, keeping the eyes on the earth, is one of the
most remarkable circumstances in the character of the persons de-
scribed by Saturn, or who have him in the ast·endant at birth.
t These evil qualities when Saturn is weak and afflicted.

some blackness or imperfection in them; his hair gently
curls (if he be in a fiery sign); a man well spoken, reli-
gious, or at least a good moral honest man ; a person
comely, and somewhat fat· (if 1t be in moist signs), fleshy;
if in airy signs, large and strong ; if in earthly signs, a
man usually well descended; but if he be significator, if
an ordinary clown,_ as sometimes he may be, then is he of
more humanity than usual in such kind of men.
Mars.-A martial man is many times· (ull-faced, with
a lively, high colour, like sun-burnt, or like ·raw tanned
leather; a fierce countenance, his eyes being sparkling or
shnrp and darting, and of yellow colour; his hair, both of
head and beard, being reddish, (but herein you must vary
according to the 'sign). In fiery signs, ahd airy, where ~
falls to be with fixed stars of his own nature, there shews
a deep sandy red colour; but in watery signs, being with
fixed stars of his own nature, he is of a flaxen or whitish
bright hair; if in earthy signs, the hair is like a sad brown,
or of a chesnut colour. He has a mark or scar on his face;
is broad-shouldered, a sturdy, strong body, being bold and
proud, given to mockery and scorn, to quarrel, drink, game,
and wench; which you may easily know by the sign he is
in : if in the house of ~ , he wenches ; in that of ~ , he
steals; but if he be in his own house, he quarrels ; in that
of T,, is dogged; in the 0 's, is lordly ; in the }) 's, is
adrunkard.
1'ke Sun.-The Sun generally denotes one of an obscure
white colour, mixed with red; a round face, and short
chin, a fair stature, and one of a comely body; his colour
sometimes between yellow and black, but for the most part
more sanguine than otherwise; a bold man, and resolute ;
his hair curling; he has a white and tender skin; one de-
sirous of praise, fame, and estimation among men; he has
a clear voice, and great head; his teeth somewhat distorted

or obliquely set; of slow speech, but of a composed judg-
ment; using outwardly a great decorum in his actions, but
privately be is lascivious and prone to many vices.
Venus.-Whoever is signified by Venus, whether man or
woman, has a good and fair round visage, a full eye, usu-
ally we say goggle-eyed; red ruddy lips, the nether more
thick or longer than the upper ; the eyelids black, yet
lovely and graceful ; the hair of lovely colour, (but most
part according to the sign as before repeated); in some it
is coal black, in others a light brown; a soft smooth hair;
and the body extremely well shaped, even rather inclining
to shortness than tallness•.
Mercury.-We describe Mercury to be a man neither
black nor white, but between both, of a sad brown or dark
yellow colour ; long visaged, high forehead, black or grey
eyes, a thin, long, sharp nose ; thin spare beard, (many
times none at all) of an auburn sad colour, next to black;
slender of body, small legs; a prattling, busy fellow; and
in walking he goes nimbly, and always would be thought
to be full of action.
The Moon.-She, by reason of her S\!iftness, varies her
shape very often, but, in general, she personates one having
a round visage and full face, in whose complexion you may
perceive a mixture of white and red, but paleness over-
comes: if she be in fiery signs, the man or woman speaks
hastily ; in watery signs, he or she has some freckles in hi~
or her face, or is blub-cheeked, not a handsome body, but a
muddling creature ; and unless very well <jignified, she
ever signifies an ordinary vulgar persont.
• We have·always observed that Venus causes dimple1 and a smil-
ing face.
t We have given these descriptions in addition to the former, as it
is most material for the student to be able to describe the person in-
quired of well; as, by that means, the character being known, his
runduct may he more llCCurately foreseen.

IF one demand of the artist, what condition, quality, or
stature the person inquired of is, then observe the sign of
that house whereby he is signified, and the planet in it,
the sign wherein the lord of that house is, and wherein the
Moon is; mix one with another, and by the greater testi-
monies judge; for if the sign be humane, viz. n, t!Jt, :::,

judge the body to be handsome, and the conditions of the

the ascendant or descending in the sixth house, you may
judge he has something in his disease of the nature of¥,
but what it is, you must know by the concurrence of the
other siguificators.
Ifa person has lost or missed any cattle, or any material
thing, let him observe what sign the significator of the thing
is in; if in ¥, and it be a beast strayed, or the like, let
him see what manner of places that sign directs into, and
let him repair thith~r to seareh, considering the quarter of
heaven the sign signifies ; if it be a piece of goods that
without hands cannot be removed, then let him look into
such parts of or about his house, as ¥ signifies.
If one asks concerning travel, whether such a country,
city, or kingdom will be healthful or prosperous unto him,
see in the figure what sign the lord of the ascendant
is in: if the significator be fortunate in ¥, or if 11- or
~ be therein, he may safely travel or sojourn in such
cities or countries as the sign ¥ represents; which you
may easily perceive in the above-named catalogue. Those
countries subject to the sign wherein the infortunes are
posited, unless they themselves be significators, are ever
unfortunate. Remember, that a gentleman inquires, usually,
if he shall have his health and live jocundly in such or
such a country or city ; the merchant wholly aims at trade,
and the increase of his stock-; therefore in the merchant's
figure, you must consider the country or city subject to
the sign of the second house, or where the part of fortune.
or lord of the second house is, and which is most fortified,
and thither let him trade •.
• This implies, that you must judge by the sign on the hQuse which
rules the particular subject of inquiry ; as, if it be, where he may
gain a good wife, look to the seventh house.

CHAPTER XVII.
OF THE ESSENTIAL DIGNITIES OF THE PLANETS.
TnE exact way of judicature in astrology is, first, by
being perfect in the nature of the planets and signs ;
secondly, by knowing the strength, fortitude, or debility of
the significators, and well poising of them, and their as-
pects and several mixtures, in your juC.gment; thirdly,
by rightly applying the influence of the figure of heaven
erected, and the planets' aspects to one another at the time
of the question, according to natural and not enfot·ced
maxims of art; for by how much you endeavour to strain
a judgment beyond nature, by so much the mare you
augment your error. A planet is then ·said to be really
strong when he has many essential dignities•, which are
known by his being either in his house, exaltation, tri-
plicity, term, or face, at the time of erecting the figure.
As, for example, in any scheme of heaven, if you find a
planet in any of those signs we call his house, he is then ·
essentially strong; as T, in 11', or 1,l. in t, &c.
Es&ential Dignity by House.-In judgment, when a
planet or significator is in his own house, it represents a
man in such a condition, as that he is lord of his own
house, estate, and fortune; or a man wanting very little of
the goods of this world ; or it tells you the man is in a very
happy state or condition: this will be true, unless the sig-
nificator be retrograde, or combust, or atB.icted by any
other malevolent planet or aspect.
Eraltation.-lf he be in that sign wherein he is eralted,
you may consider him essentially strong; whether he be
* These apply not to nativities where the angular position and
good aspects r~ceived by a planet constitute its ~trength.-ZAD.

70 INTRODUCTION 1'0 ASTROLOGY.
near the very degree of his exaltation, or not ; as ~ in J:f,
Ol' 11- in !!D.
If the significator be in his exaltation, and no ways im-
pedited, but angular, it represents a person of haughty
condition, arrogant, assuming more to himself than his due;
fo•· it is observed, the planets in some part of the ~odiac
do more evidently declare their effects than in others.
Triplicity.-If he be in any of those signs which are
allotted him for his triplicil!J, he is also strong, but in ·a
less degree.
A planet in his triplicit!J shews a man modestly endued
with the goods and fortune of this world; one well de-
scended, and thecondition of his life, at present time of the
question, to be good; but not so much so as if in either of
the two former dignities.
Term.-If any planet be in those degrees we assign for
his terms, we allow him to be slightly dignified.
A planet fortified, only as being in his own terms,
rather shews a man more of the corporature and temper of
the planet, than any extraordinary abundance in fortune,
or eminence in the commonwealth.
Face.- If any planet be in his decanate, or face, he has.
the least possible essential dignity; but being in his own
decanate or face, he cannot then be called peregrine.
A planet being in his decanate orface, describes a man
ready to be turned out of doors, having much to do to
maintain himself in credit and reputation ; and in genealo-
gies it represents a family at the last gasp, even as good
as quite decayed, hardly able to support itself.
The planets may be strong in another way ; viz. acci-
dentally; as when direct, swift in motion, angular, in A or
* aspect with 11- or ~ , &c., o•· in 6 with certain notable
fixed stars, as shall hereafter be related. Here follows a
table of essential dignities : by only casting your eye there-

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 71
on, you may perceive what essential dignity or imbecility
any planet has.
There has been much difference between the Greeks,
Arabians, and Indians, concerning the essential dignities of
the planets : I mean, how to dispose the several degrees of
the signs suitably to any planet. After many ages had
passed, and until the time of Ptolemy, the astrologians
were not resolved hereof; but since Ptolemy's time, the
Grecians unanimously followed the method he left, which
the other christians of Europe to this day since retain as
most rational : but the Moors of Barbary at present, and
those astrologians of their nation who lived in Spain do
somewhat vary from us to this very day: however, I pre-
sent thee with a table according to Ptolemy.

EXPLANATION OF THE TABLE.
Every planet has two signs for his HOUSES, except Sol
and Luna ; they but one each. ~ has J1> and ::: ; and 1f.
has t and )( ; t has ¥' and nt ; ~ has ~ and ~ ; ~
has u and 11]l. One of these houses· is called diurnal,
noted in the second column by the letter D; the other is
nocturnal, noted by the letter N. The planets have their
EXALTATIONs, as the third column points out: thus 0
in 19 ¥' ; 1> in 3 ~ ; &l in 3 degrees u, &c. are exalted.
These twelve signs are divided into FOUR TRIPLICITIES.
The fourth column tells you which planet or planets, both
night and day, governs each triplicity; as over against !!D,
nt, )(, you ~nd t , who governs by day and night in that
triplicity; and over against <V', .st, t, you find 0 and 1f.,
viz. that 0 has domination by day, and 1f. by night, in
that triplicity: the first six degrees of ¥ are the TERMS
of 1f., from six to fourteen, the TERMS of ~ , &c. &c. Over
against ¥', in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth columns,
you find t 10, 0 20, ~ 30 ; viz. the first ten degrees
of¥' are the FACE of t ; from ten to twenty, the FACB
of 0 ; from twenty to thirty, the FACE of ~,&c.
In the thirteenth column, over against ¥', you find ~
DETRIMENT, viz. ~ being in ¥, is in a sign opposite to
one of bet• own houses, and so is said to be in her n E-
TRIMENT. In the 14th column, over against¥, you find
~,over his head FALL, that is, ~ when he is in ¥' is op-
posite to his exaltation, and so is unfortunate, &c. Though
these things are expressed in the nature of the planets
already, yet this table makes it appear more evident to the
eye, and is useful for reference.

CHAPTER XIX.
CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE JUDGMENT.
ALL the ancients that have w1i_tten of questions do give
warning to the astrologer, that before be delivers judg-
ment he well consider whether the figure is radical• and
capable of judgment: the question then shall not be taken
for radical: 1st, when either the first or second degrees of a
sign ascend, (especially in signs ofshort ascensions, viz. ~,
:=, )(, <'f', ~ , n ). You may not then adventure judgment,
unless the querent be very young, and his corporator~
complexion, and moles or scars of his body, agree with the
quality of the signs ascending. 2d, If Z7 or more degrees of
any sign ascend, it is not safe to give judgment, except the
querent be in years corresponding to the number of degrees
ascending, or unless the figure be set upon a time certain,
viz. any event happening, such as a man went away or fled
at such a time precisely; to learn the result : here you may
judge, because it is no propounded question. 3d, It is not
safe to judge when the » is in the later degrees of a·sign,
especially in n, nt, or ~ ; or, as some say, when she is in
via comhusta, which is, when she is in the last 15 degrees
of .a., or the first 15 degrees of nt·
All manner of matters go hardly on (except the principal
significators be very strong) when the » is void of course;
yet sometimes she performs it void of course, if in ~ , !!D,
t, or )(. You must also be wary, when in any questio11
propounded you find the cusp of the seventh bouse afflicted,
or the lord of the house retrograde or impedited, and the

matter at that time not concerning the seventh house, but
belonging to any other house: it is an argument that the
judgment of the astrologer will give little content, or
nothing please the querent, for the seventh house generally
has signification of the artist. The Arabians, as Alkindus
and others, do deliver the following rules, as very fit to be
considered before a question be judged :-viz. if 'F} be in
the ascendant, especially retrograde, the matter of that
question seldom or never comes to good: 'F} in the seventh
either corrupts the judgment of the astrologer, or is a sign
the matter propounded will come from one misfortune to
another. If the lord of the ascendant be combust, neither
question propounded will take, nor the querent be regulated.
The lord of the seventh unfortunate, or in his fall, or terms
of the infortunes, the artist shall scarce give a solid judg-
ment.
When the testimonies of fortunes and infortunes are
equal, defer judgment: it is not possible to know which
way the balance will turn; however, defer your opinion till
another question better inform you.
CHAPTER XX.
WHAT SIGNlFICATOR, QUERENT, AND QUESITED, ARE;
AND AN INTRODUCTION TO THE JUDGMENT OF A
QUESTION.
THE querent is he or she that propounds the question
and desires resolution ; the quesited is he or she, or the
thing sought and inquired after.
The significator is no more than that planet which rules
the house that signifies the person or thing demanded ; as
if ¥ is ascending, 8 being lord of ¥, shall be significator
Digitized by Google
76 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
of the querent, viz. the sign ascending shall in part signify
his cotporature, body, or stature: the lord of the ascendant,
according to the sign he is in, the b and planet in the
ascendant, equally mixed together, shall shew his quality
or conditions; so that let any sign ascend, what planet is
lord of that sign shall be called lord of the house, or signi-
ficator of the person inquiring, 8tc.
So that, in the first place, when any question is pro-
pounded, the sign ascending ar.d his lord are always given
unto him or her that asks the question.
Secondly : You must then consider the matter pro-
pounded, and see to which of the twelve houses it does pro-
perly belong: when you have found the house, consider
the sign and lord of that sign, how, and in what sign and
wbat part of heaven he is placed, how dignified, what as-
pect he has to the lord of the ascendant, who impedites
your significator, who is a friend unto him, viz. what planet
it is, and what house he.is lord of, or in what bouse posited;
from such a man or woman signified by that planet shall
you be aided or hindered, or by one of such relation unto
you as that planet signifies ; if lord of such a house, such
an enemy; if lord of a house that signifies enemies, then
an enemy verily; if of a friendly house, a friend.
The whole natural key of astrology rests in the words pre-
ceding, rightly understood. By the examples following, I
shall make all things more plain ; for I do not desire or will
reserve any thing whereby the learner may be kept in sus-
pense of understanding what is useful for him, and most fit
to be known. In every question we do give the b as a con-
significator with the querent or lord of the ascendant.
Having well considered the several applications and separa-
tion of the lords of those houses signifying your questions,
as also the b , her situation and quality ofthe aspects she has
and each significator has to each, you may begin to judge
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROI.OGY. 77
and consider whether the thing demanded will come to
pass, yea or nay; by what or whose means, the time when,
and whether it will be good for the querent to proceed fur-
ther in his demands, yea or nay.
CHAPTER XXI.
TO KNOW WHETHER A THING DEMANDED WILL BE
BROUGHT TO PERFECTION, YEA OR NAY.
Tu E ancients have delivered unto us, that there are four
ways or means which discover whether a person's question
demanded shall be accomplished, yea or nay.
Conjunction.-First, by conjunction: when therefore you
find the lord of the ascendant, and the lord of that house
which signifies the thing demanded, hastening to a cS, and
in the first house, or in any angle, and the significators
meet with no prohibition or refranation, before they come
to perfect cS , you may then judge t~at the thing sought
after shall be brought to pass without any manner of let
or impediment; the sooner, if the significators be swift in
motion, and essentiallyor accidentally strong; but if this cS
of the significators be in a succeedent house, it will be per-
fected, but not so soon; if in cadent houses, with infinite
loss of time, some difficulty, and much struggling.
Aspects of* or A.-Things are also effected, when the
principal signifiers apply by * or A aspect out of good
houses and places where they are essentially well dignified,
and meet with no malevolent aspect to intervene ere they
come to be in perfect * or A.
Aspects of o and 8 .-Things are also produced to per-
fection when the significators apply by 0 aspect, pro-
vided each planet have dignity in the degrees wherein they
Digitized by Google
78 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
are, and apply out of proper and good houses ; otherwise
not. Sometimes it happens that a matter is effected
when the significators apply by 8 , but it is when there is
mutual reception by house, and out of friendly houses, and
the b separating from the significator of the thing de- -
manded, and applying presently to the lord of the ascend-
ant. I have seldom seen any thing brought to perfection
by this way of opposition, but the querent had been
better the thing had been undone ; for, if the question was
concerning marriage, the parties seldom agreed, but were
ever wrangling and disputing, each party repining at his
evil choice, laying the blame upon their covetous parents,
as having no mind to it themselves; and if the question
was about portion or monies, the querent did, it is true, re-
cover his money or portion promised, but it cost him more
to procure it in suit Qf law than the debt was worth; and
so have I seen it happen in many other things, &c.
1'ranslation.-Things are brought to perfection by trans-
lation of light and nature, in this manner :-When the sig·
nificators both of querent and quesited are separating from
cS , or *, or L:.. aspects of each other, and some other
planet separates himself from one of the significators, of
whom he is received, either by house, triplicity, or term •,
and then this planet applies to the other significator by cS
or aspect, before he meets with the cS or aspect of any
other planets; he thus translates the force, influence, and
virtue of the first significator to the other, and then this
intervening planet, (or such a man or woman as is signified
by that planet), shall bring the matter in hand to perfec-
tion.
Consider what house the planet interposing or translating
the nature and light of the two planets is lord of, and de-
• This means being in these dignities of that si,gnificator.

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 79
scribe him or her; and say to the querent, that such a party
shall do good in the business of, &c. ; viz. if lord of the
second, a good purse effects the matter ; if lord of the
third, a kinsman or neighbour ; and so of all the rest of
the houses; of which more hereafter.
Collection.-Matters are also brought to perfection,
when the two principal significators do not behold one
another, but both cast their several aspects to a more
weighty planet than themselves, and they both rec-eive him
in some of their essential dignities ; then shall that planet,
who thus collects both their lights, bring the thing demanded
to perfection ; which signifies that a person somewhat in-
terested in both parties, and described and signified by
that planet, shall perform the thing which otherwise could
not be perfected : as many times you see two fall at va-
riance, and ofthemselveR cannot think ofany way ofaccom-
modation, when suddenly a neighbour or friend accidentally
reconciles all differences, to the content of both parties; and
this is called a collection.
In all questions, you are generally to observe this method
following :-The ascendant represents the person of the
querent, and the second his estate, the third his kindred,
the foutth his father, the fifth his children, the sixth his
servant or sickness, the seventh his wife, the eighth the
manner of his death, the ninth his religion or journeys, the
tenth his estimation or honour, mother, trade, &c.; the
eleventh his friends, the twelfth his secret enemies: also un-
derstand, that when one asks concerning a woman, or any
party signified by the seventh house and the lord thereof,
that then the seventh house shall be her ascendant, and sig-
nify her person ; the eighth house shall signify her estate,
and be hersecond; theninth house shall signify her brethren
and kindred ; the tenth shallrepresent herfather; theeleventh
bel' children, or whether apt to have children ; the twelfth

80 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
her sickness and servants : the first house her sweetheart;
the second house her death ; the third her journey ; the
fourth her mother, or trade, &c. ; the fifth her friends; the
sixth her sorrow, care, and private enemies. Let the question
be of or concerning a churchman, minister, or the brother of
the wife or sweetheart, the ninth house shall represent each
of these ; but the tenth house shall be significator of !tis
substance ; the eleventh house of his brethren; and so in
order: and so in all manner of questions, the house signify-
ing the party quesited shall be his ascendant or first house,
the next his second house, and so continuing round about
the whole heavens of twelve houses. If a question be
· made of a king or nobleman, the tenth is his first house, the
eleventh his second, &c.; but in nativities, the ascendant
always influences the party born, whether. king or beggar.
These things preceding being w.ell understood, you may
proceed to judgment; not that it is necessary you have all
that is written in your memory exactly, but, that you be
able to know when you are in error, when not; when to
judge a· question, when not.
Ofthe true Time oferecting a Figure.
The proper time is that when you feel most anxiousabout
any matter, and first form the resolution to erect a figure
on the subject: if you find the figure radical, and lay aside
all self-love and prejudice, you may safely judge a figure
erected for that instant oftime.
If a person apply to an astrologer, the figure must be
taken for the exact time he first speaks on the subject; or,
if it be by letter, when it is first read and understood by
the artist. If it be not a question, but an event suddenly
happening, then the moment of its commencement will
shew, by a figure, its result~ &c. ; as the first setting off
on a journey, beginning a letter, or any business, &c.; or.
Digitized by Coogle
INTRODUCTION TO ASTU.OI.OGY. 81
when you first i:liscover the loss of any article, or hear of
any event happening: in all these cases, the first impression
on your mind is the true moment for the figure.
Of the Planet or Planets whiclt hinder or impedite the Thing
demanded in ang Question.
In all questions consider caa·efully what planet it is which
obstructs or hinders the perfection of the thing desired.
We receive judgment herein ft'Om that planet with whom
the lord of the ascendant be joined, (whether by bodily 6
or by aspect), or the significator of the thing inquired
after, whether it he the ) herself, or that she be partaker
with the lord of the ascendant or not, or signify the thing
demanded.
Carefully observe the planet to which the querent's sig-
nificator is joined, or the ]) ; and observe how'that planet
is disposed, and unto whom he is joined ; for if the lord of
the ascendant, }) , or significator of tJte thing propounded,
be joined to an evil planet, evilly disposed, without recep-
tion, or if he be not evilly disposed, but be joined to an in-
fortune, and that infortune receive him not, it denotes the
destruction of the thing demanded.
A planet is ill disposed when he is peregrine, retrograde,
combu1t; also if cadent and behold not the lord of the house
or the cusp of the house of the thing demanded. The
aspect to the cusp is better than to the lord of the house.
Ifthe significator, as above, be joined to an unfortunate
planet, viz. one retrograde, combust, or cadent ; then
observe whether mutual reception intervene ; which shews
the perfection of the matter, though with much labour and
solicitation. If there be no reception, the affair will come
to nothing, though there may have been much probability
ofits performance. .

demanded, or the planet who receives any of them, be free
from affliction, though without mutual reception, it perfects
the matter with facility.
If a_ny one of them be free from the infortunes, and joined
with any benevolent planet, who is himself aspected by a
malevolent, without mutual reception, the matter will be
brought to a good conclusion.
Consider carefully whether planets in aspect be without
reception, for when they are in reception, things are ever
brought to pass; though, if the aspect be eyil, with degree
oftrouble, delay, &.c.
Consider also, whether any other planet prohibit before
the significatorsjoin in perfect cS with an evil planet; if so,
it hinders the thing from happening : but if no such pro-
hibition ot· cutting off the light of the infortune occur, by
which its malevolence may be taken off, the thing will be
effected.
Ifan infortune collect the light of other planets, or if
light be translated to an infortune, the matter will not be
effected unless there be reception ; viz. that the infortune
be received hy,ordisposed of, or ruled by, (which is all one
thing), the significators.

and in what sign either of them are; and for each degree
allow one week in a moveable sign, one month in a common
sign, and one year in a fixed sign : this is only for exam-
ple ; for the measure of time must be limited according to
the other significators concurring in judgment herein.
Secondly. Consider also how many degrees D is from
any infortune, or the lords of the 6th or 8th, according to
the signs and houses in which they are found, and their
nature and quality.
Thirdly. If there be an infortune in the ascendant, see
how many degrees the cusp of the 1st house wants of the
place of the evil planet; or, if he be in the 7th house, how
far it is from the cusp of that house, and compute the time
of death, sickness, or misfortune, by the degrees, as they
may be in fixed, commo_n, or moveable signs.
If the lord of the ascendant be most afflicted by the lord
of the 6th, and in the 6th, or come to combustion in the
6th, the querent will have very many and tedious sicknesses,
which will scarce leave him till his death. This will be
more certain if the lords of the ascendant, 8th bouse, and
D, be all placed in the 6th.
If the D, lord of the ascendant, or sign ascending, be
most afflicted by the lord of the 8th, or by a planet situated
in the 8th, judge that the sickness which now afflicts him,
or shortly will, will end fatally, and that death is approach- •
ing. But if the D and other significators are chiefly
afflicted by the lords of other houses, judge the misfor-
tune from the nature of the house or houses of which the
afflicting planf'.ts are lords ; and the fil'st origin thereof
from some person or thing belonging to that house, wherein
you find the afflicting planet posited. Judge thereby a
misfortune, but not death.
If there be any fixed star, of much power, near the D,
lord of the ascendant or the degree ascending, or with the

C(lution.
Avoid rash judgments ; especially of death. This should
never be judged by one single testimony, however strong.
And though the lord of the ascendant be going to combus-
tion in the house of death, observe whether the ]) , 1+, or ~
(or ~ if well aspected and strong), throw any good aspect
to the lord of the ascendant, before he come to perfect ~
with 0 ; for then either medicine or natural strength will
contradict that malignant influence, or take off part of that
misfortune. When two or more of. the rules aforesaid
occur, you may be more bold ; yet concerning the absolute
time of death, I -have found it best to be wary. Though
you may safely judge that the querent will not be long
lived, or else subject to many calamities ; and this I know
by many verified examples. This knowledge will be useful
to those who will use theit· reason to avoid those casualties
their nature or inclinations would run them into•.

is the south-east quarter. The 1st, is due east; the 12th,
is about two points south of east ; the middle of the 11th,
is south eal't; the cusp of the 11th, is about two point~
east of south; and the lOth, is due south. In like manner,
from the lOLh to the 7th house is the south-west quarter;
and from the 7th to the 4th is the north-west quarter;
and, lastly, from the 4th .to the ascendant is the north-east
quarter. In that quartet· wherein you find 1l., ~ , D, or $,
or most of them, direct the querent to proceed in that
direction, especially if $ and D be free from combustion ·
and be strong. If 1J. or ~ be lords of the 8th, 12th, or
6th houses, you must avoid them; and avoid that quarter
wherein the evil planets arc, unless they be essentially
strong, and lords of the 1st, 2d, lOth, or 11th houses,
when they may prove friendly•.
1f the querent desire to live where he may most enjoy
ltealth, look to the quarter of the lord of the ascendant, or
D; and whichever is strongest, or casts the best aspect to
the degree ascending, to that quarter repair for health.
If an increase of wealth be considered, see where the lord
of the 2<1, the $, and its dispositor, or any two of them,
be, and thither repair for that end. Of this I shall speak
in other judgments.
What Part of LIFE is like to be best'?
See in what angle or quarter of heaven the fortunate
and promising planets are; for in this way of judging we
usually give to every house five years, more or less, as the
significators promise life or death. Begin with the 12th,
then the 11th, then the lOth, &c., and so round to the
ascendant. If 1l. or ~ be in the 11th or lOth, judge the

querent to have lived happily from the 5th to the 15th
year of age; if they be in the 8th or 7th, he will or hath
lived contented from fifteen to thirty; if 1f., &c. be in the
6th, 5th, or 4th,house, say that after his middle age, from
30 to 45, he may do well ; but if the benefics be in the last
quarter, his greatest happiness will be in his last days, or
after 45. If you find the significators very strong, you may
add a year to each house. Lastly, the aspects the ]) and
lord of the ascendant are separated from shew what and what
manner of accidents have preceded the question; their
next application what may be next expected. If you con-
sider the house or houses the planets they separated from
are lords of, it acquaints you with the matter, nature,
person, and quality of the things already happened-evil if
the aspects were evil, and good if they were good. Also if
you note the quality of the next aspect by application, and
the well or ill-being and position of the planets applied to#
it shews the character of the next succeeding accidents and
events, their nature, proportion, &c., and the time when
they will happen.

tunes angular and more potent than the infortunes; I con-
cluded that, according to natural causes, he might live many
years; that nature was strong, and he subject to few dis·
eases. This has hitherto proved true; he being yet alive

2d Qu tRY .-1'o what part of tke world he were best

0 lord of the ascendant near the cusp of the 9th, (and
the sign thereof moveable), the house of long journeys ; I
intimated that he was resolving suddenly upon a journeg
south east: south, because the quarter of heaven wherein
the lord ofthe ascendant is iR south ; east, because the sign
where <;> is is east, (this h.e confessed); and as 0 was but
20 10' ·distant from the cusp of the 9th, he went away
within two montl_ls.
I judged those countries subject to 'V' might bepropitious.
Had his resolution been to stay in England, it might have
been good for him, for England is subject to 'V' : I would
have advised him to steer towards Kent, Essex, Sussex or
Suffolk ; for they lie south-east from London. But if
sometimes you find a city, town or kingdom, subject to the
sign which promises good, stands not in the direction the
sign oa· quarter of heaven points out as above, observe this
rule-that if enforced to live in that country, city, &c.
thE;n direct your actions or employment to those parb of
that country, &c. which lie east, west, &.c., as in the figure
is directed.
As the ]) applied strongly to the A of 'll., and be and

Ireland would agree with his constitution, and that be

Ireland, and there performed good service, and obtained a
notable victory against the rebels.

3d QuERY.- What part ofhis LIFE would be best?
Considering the two fortunes were placed in the lOth,
and Q and 0 in the 9th, I judged his younger years would
be the most pleasant; and ~ being in the 8th, which comes
to about the 24th, 25th, or 26th years of his age, I judged
about that time many crosses, and that his afflictions first
began. And seeing no fortunate planet either in the 7th,
6th, 5th, 4th, OJ' 3d houses, I said the remainder of his life,
for many years, would be little comfortable, and full of
labour and trouble. Yet I judged those calamities should
not suddenly come upon him, because 1> applied to A of
'1f., and wanted almost 3° of coming to a perfect aspect.
Therefore I conceived by means of some person in autho-
rity represented by '1f. , he should be supported or assisted
in his affairs for almost three years after the question.
Had '1f. been essentially dignified, I should have judged
him a more durable fortune.
4th QuERY.- What genera/ ACCIDENTS had happened
already?
Although it is not usual to be so inquisitive, yet, seeing
the figure so radical, I considered from what planets .0,
lord of the ascendant, had last separated. The 0 had
lately been in 6 ~, then 0 l}, then * '1f.. Now as ~ is
lord of the 4th house, signifying lands, &c., and was now
in the 8th, which signifies the substauce ofwomen, I judged
he had been molested of late concerning some lands, or the
jointure or portion of his wife, or a woman ; wherein I was
confirmed the more, as ]) applies to 8 ~ in the 8th
house; she being in the querent's house of property, which
shewed that the quarrel or strife should be concerning
money or things signified by that house. (All this was very
t1·ue.)
As 0 had lately been in 0 l} , significator of the que-
rent's wife, I told him that his wife and he had been at

92 IN'fRODUCTIO.N TO ASTROLOGY.
great variance; and because her significator 1i did dispose
of his Ea, I judged that she had no mind that he should
have any of her estate or manage it, hut kept it to her own
use. For f). is rett·ograde in a fiery sign, and the sign of
the 7th fixed, all which shews her to be a woman not will-
ing to be curbed or to submit. (This was confessed.)
Lastly, as 0 was lately in * to ~.and ~ in the lOth,
I told him that some great lawyer or courtier • had endea-
voured to reconcile the differences between them; and as
0 and 1i did now apply to fl. aspect, there seemed, at
present, a willingness in both parties to be reconciled. Nor
did I see any obstruction in the matter, except ~ , who is
in 0 aspect to 1i, did impedite it. I judged ~,in gene-
ral, to signify some lawyer, attorney, or writings; but, as
he was lord of the querent's 2d, it might be because
the querent would not consent to allow her such a sum of
money as might be asked ; or that, };tis purse being weak.
he had not wherewithal to solicit his cause ; or ~ being
lord of the 11th, some pretended friend would advise the
contrary, or some of her lawyers; or, as the 11th is the 5th
from the 7th, a cllild of the querent's wife might be the oc-
casion of continuing the breach. (I believe every particu-
lar herein proved true; however, this was the way to find
the thing which disturbed tlteir unitg.)
0 bserve, that as !i , lady of the lOth, doth dispose of ~,
lord of the 8th, viz. the wife's fortune, so she had entrusted
her estate to a great nobleman.
5th QuERY.- What ACCIDENTS, in future, Tte might
expect.
In this query, I first considered 0 ,lord of the ascendant,
no ways unfortunate or in ill aspect with any planet; but,
on the contrary, excellently fortified: I judged he had
the wide world to ramble in, (for a planet strong, and in no

aspect with others, shews a man at liberty to do what he
will); and; for many years he might, (quoad capax), live in
a prosperous condition, and traverse much ground, or see
many countries. For <'f', the sign which 0 is in, is move-
able and on the cusp of the 9th, the house of long journeys;
which denoted many changes and variety of action in
sundry parts. ·
2dly: I observed ]) in his house of substance, applying
to 11. in the lOth, and 'lf. lord of the 5th and 8th; the
former the house of children; the latter that of the wife's
substance. Hence I gathered, that the querent was desi-
rous to treat with some nobleman, ('lf. being in the lOth),
about the education of his children; and that there might
be a salary payable out of the wift;:'s jointure. (Such a
thing he did settle before he left England.)
3dly: I found )) in fiJI. peregrine.
4tbly: ~ lord of hil]l 2d,68ignifying his estate in )(, his
detrime11t; yet, in his own terms, afBicted by t , and hav-
ing lately had the 8 of ]) . Hence I judged that he had
been in great want of money a little before the question
was asked. And if we note the distance between the 8 of
)) and· ~, we find 60 21', shewing that he had been in
want of money about six months and somewhat more, pre-
viously to asking the question. (This was coTifessed.)
5thly : Seeing )) was applying to tl. of 11. , and then, be-
fore she got out of the sign fiJI., did occur the 8 of t, I
acquainted the querent that, after some years of pleasure,
he would be in great danger of losing his life, goods, lands,
and fortune. His life, because t is in the 8th ; his estate,
because ]) is in the 2d; and his lamls or inheritance, be-
cause t is lord of the 4th and situated in the 8th house ;
for the 4th house denotes lands, &c.
6th QuERY.-The time when?
In this query, I considered the applieation of ]) to fl. 'lf.;

which wanting about 3 degrees, J judged that he might
live pleasantly for about three years to come.
2dly : Seeing that 0 lord of the ascendant, during his
motion through ¥,did not meet any malevolent aspect, and
had got 26 degrees to run through the sign, I gave this
nature ofjudgment: I told him that for about 26 months,
or until over two years to come, I judged he should live in
a free condition, in those parts in which he intended his
journey, &c.
Lastly : I considered how many degrees » wanted of the

This difference, if I proportion into time, and neither give
years, because the sig11ijicators are in common signs and
not in fixed; nor months, because the signs signify some-
what more; but proportion a mea7l between both: the time
limited in this way will amount to about three years and
three quarters ere the 8 of ~ to ~ should take effect.
But as this query was general, I might have allowed for
every degree one year •. After, or about which time, he
was in several actions, both dangerous to his person and
f01tune ; and since that time till the present, he has had
his intervals of good and ill, but is now under the frown of
fortune, &c.
As the 0 at the time of the question was strong, he did
overcome all manner of difficulties for many years, and has,
in our unlucky differences, bad honourable employment on
his Majesty's part. But as Dt is in 8 to ~ , so it was

not without the general outcry and exclamations of the
people; nor was it his fortune, though in great command,
ever to do his Majesty any notable piece of service. And
he is now for ever, by just sentence of the Parliament,
deprived of the happiness of ending his days in England ;
which might, iu some measure, have been foreseen by the
8 of ]) to ~ , he being lord of the 4th, the end of all
things•.
N. B. All young beginners should at first write down
their judgments on each figure at full length, and after-
wards contract their opinions into a narrow compass;
by this means they will soon acquire experience. It is
well to enter every figure in a book for farther reference,
and to remark and register such things as have occurred
according to their predictions or otherwise; by which they
will be able to correct their future judgments.

If you find the lord of the ascendant apply to the que-
sited's perfect aspect the same day you intend to visit him,
you may be assured either to meet him going to his house,
or hear of him by the way; or, if any planet separate from
the lord of the quesited's house, and transfer his light to the
lord of the ascendant, you will learn where he is by a per-
son signified by that planet. Describe the planet, and it
personates the individual ; and the nature of the planet,
sign, and quarter of heaven it is in, will, by the plurality of
testimonies, shew whether it be male or female.

Erect your figure of heaven at the exact time of any

sider who is lord of the ascendant, and which planet dis-
poses of 0 and ]) ; and see if either of these be in the
ascendant, and, if more than one, take the most powerful;
and let his position be well considered. If he be in good
aspect with 0, 'lt, or ~ , there will no evil arise from the
accident, rumour, or whatever the event may be; but if
you find that planet weak in the scheme, combust, or in
evil aspect to \f , ~ , a, or t! , there will be some evil
occur. If you consider the afflicting planet and his nature
and position, you may learn the nature of the misfortune.
If it be the lord of the 3d, it will come through some kins-
man or neighbour, or by some short journey; if the lord of

QuERY.~ What Mark, Mole, or Scar has the Querent on

tion is radical, and to satisfy sceptics n.f the trut/1 of tlte
science.
When you have, upon any demand, erected the querent's
figure, observe what member of man's body the ascending
sign represents; for upon that part of his body will the
querent have a mole, mark, or scar; as, if the ascendant
be <'f', the same will be on the head ; if l:S , it will be on
the neck; i( n, on the arms or shoulders, &c •. And also
in the part ruled by the sign in which the lord ofthe ascend-
ant is, will there be another mark.
The signs on the cusp of the 6th house, and that in
which the lord of the 6th is, will give other marks on the
parts they rule. Also the sign in which D is found will

Ifthe sign or planet signifying the mark or mole be much
afflicted, the mark, &.c. will be more obvious and eminent.
If the sign or planet be masculine, the mark is on the
right side of the body; but if they be feminine, on the lift
side. And if the significator of the mole, &c. be above the
horizon, the mark or mole will be on the fore part, or visi-
ble to the eye, or on the outside of the member, &c.; but
if the planet be below the earth, it will be found on the in-
side, or !tinder part, or not visible. If few degrees are on
the cusp of the house, or the planet signifying the mole, &c.
be in few degrees of the sign, the mark, mole, &c., will be
in the upper part oflhe member. If they be in the middle
of the sign, it will be in the middle of the member or part
ruled by the sign. But if the latter degrees ascend, or are
on the 6th, or their lords, or }) be in the latter degrees of a
sign, then will the mark, mole, or scar be near the lower
part of the member. If your question be radical, and the
time rightly taken, the above rules will always exactly hold
good. And so will they (mutatis mutandis) upon the body
of the quesited; for if a person inquire concerning his wife,
then the sign on the 7th and its lord will shew the woman's
marks; and the sign on theJ2th, (the 6th from the 7th),
and its lord will shew two other marks. .
Many times, if the }) be in cS or 8 0, the querent has
some blemish in or ncar his ~yes ; and this is ever true,

Whether one absent be dead or alive ?
If the quesited have no relation to the querent, then the
ascendant, its lord, and ]),shall signify the absent person •.
But if the party inquired afte1· be a relation, then take the
house and its lord which signifies that relation; as the 3d
for a brother or sister, the 4th for a father, the 6th for a
paternal uncle or aunt, the lOth for a mother, &c.
In judging this question, see whether the quesited's lord
of the 1st and 8th be joined corporally together in the 8th,
or be in 8 from the 6th or 8th. These are tokens ofhis being
sick or near to death. See if there be any translation oflight
between the lord of his ascendant and the 8th, or if the lord
of the 8th being in his ascendant, the lord of his ascendant
be also in the 8th; or the lord of the 8th in the 4th, and
the lord of the 4th in the 8th ; these arc all tokens that the
party is dead ; especially if his significator be much af-
flicted by ill aspects, and the evil planets be angular, and
the good ones cadent.
If the lord of his ascendant be separating from ill aspect
of the lord of the 6th, the absent party has been lately
sick; if from the lord of the 8th, he has been near death,
but is not dead, without other striking testimonies, as
above, concur. If frorn the lord of the 12th, he has been
figures; but defecta, such as protrusion of the breast bone, or a humped
back, &c. (to persons born with S!D or Q, rising), may sometimes be
found in lieu of moles or scars. For example, the Princess Victoria
having f.? in )(, which rules the feet, and situated near the cusp of the
12th niJuae, at her birth, she has a rceakne11 in her feet. Had one tes-
timony only existed, and f.? been in )( elsewhere, she wopld have
merely had a mole on her foot.
• We should always take the ascendant, &c. for the querent, antl the
ith and its lord for the quesited. But if the figure be erected by an
artitit at his own suggestion, let the ascendant, &c. shew the absent
person.

troubled with anxiety about arrests or fear of imprisonment;
and if his significator be in the 12th, he is in much trouble
by means of a p1ivate enemy; and if in a fixed sign, and
other testimonies of trouble agree, he is in prison. If he
separate from the lord of the 2d by ill aspect, he is now suf-
fering by want of money. If from the lord of the 7th, he
has had some quarrel or contention. If the 9th, ti:ouble on
journeys or by law, &.c. ; and so ofthe other houses. I have
everfound that ifthe lord ofhis ascendant be in the9th,10th,
or 11th, though reported dead, he was alive. If you find
him alive, and would know when you will hear from or St!e
him, observe in the Ephemeris when the lord of the que-
rent's Lith and the quesited's ascendant come to * or A
aspect: about that time news of him will arrive. If the )
apply to * or A of his significator, then allow a day,
week, or month, for each degree she be distant, according
as the significators may be placed in angles, succeedent or
cadent houses, and the signs be moveable, common, or
fixed •.
• The most difficult thing in all questions is to judge oftime with ac-
curacy. I should advise the young student to be cautious of giving
any judgment on this head, unless 'where it is the chief point desired
to be kn!'wn. In this case, and-if the figure be very radical, and if
the planet rchich ;, '1pplying to the other be taken, the following rule •

* of " 1 lord of the 4th, the significator of the querent's
dwelling: I judged that she would find him there at her
coming home: which ehe did. Now, had I found 'lf., lord
of the 5th, in the lOth, which house signifies the master;
or had ]) separated from '11- 1 the youth's significator, and
then applied to 0, the ]) being in an angle, I would
have judged him at his master's house. I considered fur-
ther, that the 25th of July following at 2 P.M. the signi-'
ficators of the mother and son ('11- and ~ ) came to t:. as-
pect; and therefore I judged that she should see him at
that time : whicli she did. For usually about that day
when the significators come to * or t:. aspect (which may
be seen in the Ephemeris), it is very probable that news of
or a letter from the quesited will arrive, if the distance will
permit; But if the quercnt and quesited be not far asun-
der, without question they meet on that very day.
. Had the party inquired for been a stranger, he would
have been denoted by t lord of the 7th ; and being in the
2d, a succeedent house, I should have said he is not at
home, but yet not far from home. And as the sign t is
eastern, and the 2d house is north east, I should judge him
in that direction ; and as t governs fields, hills, or high
grounds, I should direct a messenger, if sent for him, to go
in that direction, and look for him in such places; but if •
it were in a town, as t governs stables, fire-places, &c., I
should cause him to be sought near a stable, smith's or
butcher's shop, &c., as t delights in such places.
2d QuERY .-A Thing s'Ndtknly happening, whether Good
or Ill is about to follow?
The 0 is here lord of the sign he is in; '1f. is lord of )(,
where ]) is; ~ is lady of the ascendant, and is casting
a i:::J. to the ascendant, and is in t:. to '1f. and he in the
ascendant; from all which we might safely have judged,
had this been the time ofa sudden accident, or thin~ done,
that it could not have redounded to the querent's injury.

But had ~ been nearer to 8 of 8, he being in the 2d, I
should have judged that the querent would have received
some loss of money shortly, and so of the rest •.
3d QuERY.-What Moles or Marks the Querent has?
I find 250 of rl!= ascending and 11- in the ascendant,
which signifies the face. This querent had a wart or mole
on the right side of her face, near he1· mouth ; for 1f. and .a:
are masculine. And as the latter degrees of .or ascend, so
the querent confessed a mole on the lower part of her ~eins
towards the haunches. 'V' being the sign of the 6th,
shewed she had one on the forehead, near the hah·, for the
cusp of the house is but 4 degrees. 8 lord of the 6th,
being in t .a masculine sign and under the earth, shewed a
mole on the right thigh, towards the middle of it, on the
back part, or that part which is not visible. The ]) in
27th degree of )( a feminine sign, under the earth, I told
her she had one mole under and towards the extl'emity of
her left foot.
The quesited being her son, had )( for his ascendarrt,
which denoted a mole on the left side of his cheek; and as
)( signifies the foot, so he had one on the left foot a little
below the ancle, as few degrees ascend. The 6th from the
5th is the lOth in the figure, which .having 4° .Q, shewed
• We consider that our author bas been rather briefon this point,for
numerous occaaions occur where the mind is desirous of knowing the
result when events happen. If ~ had been within orbs of 8 oppo-
sition, that is, half the di1tance of their unitf'd orb1, or'/"; we should
have judged loss of money by a party shewn by ~, and her situation
considered with the houses she governs. As, for example, ~ ruling
the 12th, some private female enemy, among the relations of the wife
o~ husband; because ~ is in the 3d from the 7th house. And as 8 is
8to$, we should predict a loss by a servant, (since 8 rules the 6th);
and as $ is in the 8th, it might be by one who comes to char or go
messages; if $ had been in a watery sign, a washerwoman. But the
general testimonies being good, we abould say the evil will be but tri-
lling. Experience will teach the student the,;e points.

that near his right side, below his breast, he had some scar,
mole, or mark. In this way follow the directions of the
rule.
4th Quuv.- Whether one absent be dead or alive?
In the aforesaid figure, the ascendant ~ . therein and i
its ruler, as also D, are the significators ofthe party absent.
The ascending sign and 1J therein describe his person •;
and D and ~ shew his condition.
Th~ ]) and ~ are free from any evil aspect of the lord of
the 8th, and a benefic is in the ascendant, and ~ in the
9th ; I should therefore pronounce the absent in health.
But t having been recently in 8 to 8 lord of the 2d and
6th, he had been lately in trouble about money, and also
inclined to a feverish state. But by '11- in the ascendant, and
in A to t , I should say that medicine, or such a person
as is described by ~, had relieved him. And as .~ lord of
the 11th applies to a 0 of '1f., (both of them in signs of
long ascension, which is equivalent to a A )t, I should
judge the querent to have news of the absent about ten
weeks from the time of the question, because ~ wants ten
degrees of the 0 of ~. If the absent be known to be at a
short.distance from the qucsited, I should have judged that
in ten days they should hear of him, because the signs are
moveable i· -
• If no planet be in the ascendant of the party, look to the lord of
the ascendant for a deacription of his person, according to the :~ign it
is in, and judge by that and the sign ascending; but if the lord of the
ascendant be much oj/licted, the }), according to the sign she is in,
muat be taken.
t This doctrine of the signs of long ascension, causing a'* to be
equal to a 0, and a 0 to a A, and the reverse in signs of short ascen-
sion, can only be rereived in horary and mundane astrology; and
not in nativities.
t We should, in this latter case, preferlooking to the Ephemeris for
the day when ~ formed a A of '1f. for hearing news, and when ~ and
Cf came to ofor his return.

CHAPTER XXIV.
OF A SHIP, AND HER SAFETY OR DESTRUCTION.
THE ascendant and the ]) signify the ship and cargo;
the lord of the ascendant, those that sail in her. If you
find a malevolent, having dignities in the 8th, placed in
the ascendant, or the lord of the ascendant in the 8th in ill
· configuration with the lords of the 8th, 12th, 4th, or 6th,
or if the ]) be combust, and under the earth, you may judge
that the ship is lost, and the men drowned. But if you
find reception between the significators at the same time,
the ship was wrecked, but some of the crew escaped: if
all the preceding 'significators be free from a1Biction, then
both ship and cargo are safe; and if there be reception, the
more so. If the ascendant and ]) be' unfortunate, and the
lord of the ascendant fortunate, the ship is lost, but the men
saved. ·
But when the querent demand, of any ship setting forth,
and the state of the ship ere she return, and what may be
hoped of the voyage; then, behold the angles of the figure,
and see if the fortunes are therein, and the infortunes re-
mote from angles, cadent, combust, or under the 0 beams,
then you may judj:!;e the ship will go safe with all her lad-
ing: But if you find the infortunes in angles, or succeed-
ing houses, there will chance some hinderance unto the
ship. If the infortune be T, , the vessel will strike
ground. If 8, and he be in an earthy sign, he will signify
the same, or very great danger and damage. Butif the for-
tunes cast their benevolent rays to the place of T, or 8 ,
and the lords of the angles and of the dispositor of the ])
be free, then the ship shall labour hard, and suffer damage,
yet the greater part of the crew and cargo shall be pre-
served. If t afBict the lords of the angles, and dispositor

106 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
of D, the crew will be in danger by enemies or pirates ;
any if there be any additional evil configurations among
these significators, there will be quarrels on board, thieving,
and purloining, &c. with bloodshed : 'f1 causes thefts only,
if so situated, but no bloodshed. '
If the signs afflicted by 'f1, t, ~ (and W, if he be ill
aspected), be those that signify the vessel's bottom, or parts
under water, she springs a leak; if the signs be unfortu-
nate in the midheaven, fiery signs, and t therein, there is
danger of lightning or fire ; if airy signs and ~ afilict,
damage by high winds. If t be in the 4th, and afllicted,
it denotes fire beneath ; and if \1 be with him, spontaneous
combustion. If the sign be u, ~.or :::, she may be set
on fire by an enemy.
If 'f1 be in the midheaven, and shew damage, it will be
by rotten sails or gear, and bad weather, foul winds, &c.
An infortune in the ascendant shews damage to the fore
part of the vessel ; and if the lord of the ascendant be re-
trograde, it denotes that she will put into some harbour ;
and if he be in a moveable sign, she returns to the very
port she sailed from. If the lord of the 8th afilict the lord
of the Lst, and he in the 8th, the ship will be injured
according to the nature of the planet affiicting. If he im-
pedite the l> 's dispositor, the lord of the ascendant and
]) , it shews the death of the master, and probably of his
mate. If it be e which is affiicted, it foreshews evil to the
cargo or a bad market; but if 11., ~ , or Q be in the second,
or assist its lord, or the lord of E9, it shews good profit,
which will be according to their strength.
If the lords of the ascendant, of the ]) and their dispo-
sitors be slow in motion, the voyage will be long; if they
be swift, the ship will return quickly. If there be ill as-
pects between the lord of the 1st and the dispositor of ])
without reception, there will be discord among the seamen,

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 107
and with them and the owner. If the lord of the ascendant
be strongest, the seamen will prevail ; but if the lord of the
house where » is, then the owner. If the dispositor of
E9 be not with ~t. or the lord of the 2d be weak, there will
_be scarcity of provisions, and, if they be' in watery signs, of
fresh water.

AN ExAMPLE OF A SHIP AT SEA.
In December 1644, a merchant, in London, having sent
a ship to the coast of Spain to trade, had several times news
that his ship was wrecked. He would have given £60 per
cent. to insure her, but no insurance company would med-
dle, no, not upon any terms. A friend of the merchant
asked, What I thought of tlu ship, if sunk or living 1 I
gave my opinion, that the sh'ip was not lost, but did live,
and though of late in some danger, !Jet was now recovered.
My judgment was founded on the considerations in act
following ::.._
In thelfirst place, the ascending degrees of Cancer shewed
the _bulk or.body of the ship. I find 11 casts his o from a
cardinal sigo, out of the 11th house, very near to the

·ascendant. After his 0 I find ]) in her exaltation, casting
a * to the ascendant, interposing her * between the 8
aspects of tf and 0 in the 7th, which otherwise had been
dangerous, for all 8 aspects to the ascendant in this judg-
ment are dangerous. From the ascendant affiicted by 0 of
'J,, and presence of fixed stars of his nature, I judged the
ship was of J, 's nature, sluggish, heavy, and not very sound.
And I!ZI being a weakly sign, made me judge the ship was
of such nature; (and it was so confessed). From hence,
and 5 in the 9th, I judged that the ship had been in some
distress in her voyage, occasioned by such casualties as 'fl
signifies, viz. some leak or damage in or near her breast,
as ¥, the sign 'fl is in; represents that part.
But as )) , lady of the ascendant, is in the 11th in her
exaltation, in no way impedited, and by a benevolent h.
aspect applying to 0 and tf, and is so near the body of 11-,
and as all the significators are above the earth, and no in-
fortunes in angles; I judged the ship, sailors, and officers,
were safe, and in good condition. The next QuERY was-

News would come of her?
Herein I cons~dered the ]) was fixed, and in the 11th
house; ~ is a southern sign, but in an east quarter of
heaven, verging to the south ; her application is to h. of tf ,
and he in ".f a south sign and we11t angle; all this made me
judge that the ship was south-'west from London, and upon
our own coasts, or near those which lie between Ireland and
Wales. I judged her at that time to be in some harbour,
because~ , where ]) is, is fixed, and in the 11th, or bouse
of comfort and relief,- and that she was put in to repair.
(It proved that she was in a harbour in the west.)
Because ]) applied to h. of V and 0 , and they in an
angle, and all three very swift in motion, and did want but
a few minutes of a perfect h., I judged there would be

news, or a certain discovery of the ship in a very short
time. The significators being so near a perfect aspect, I
said, either that night, or within two days the news would
arrive. (And so it proved.) And,obsei'Ve, that it gave me
good encouragement when I saw E9 disposed of by 8 , and
that ~ , to whom ]) applied, was in reception with 8 ; also,
that ]) did so well apply to 0, lord of the 2d, or house of
substance; a sign that the merchant should gain by that
adventure.
Besides, usually when ]) applies to a good aspect of a
retrograde planet, it brings the matter to an issue one way
or other speedily, and when least expected; and it is a
general maxim. that if » apply to the fortunes, or by good
aspect to any planet or planets in angles, it is reason that

nies, I judged he would lose much, if not aiJ, in this ship;

was a sure s~gn of the ship sinking.
CHAPTER XXV.
JUDGMENTS CONCERNING THE SECOND HOUSE.
Whether the Querent shall be rich? or have a competent
Fortune? Bg "!hat Means attain it? Tlte Time whm?
and ifit shall continue ?
WuoEVEit intenogates, the lord of the ascendant and .
the ) are invariably his significators.
Consider the sign on the 2d, its.lord, and the planets
therein, or aspecting the cusp or its lord; also the e.
If you find the planets all angular or even succeedent, if
direct and swift in motion, it is a good sign. If in good
houses, direct, and moderately well dignified, it is also a
good sign. Those two rules are general.
If the lord .of the 1st, the ) 1 and lord of the 2d, be
joined together, or if they have good aspect to the lord of
the 2d, or if '1f. ·or i cast a good aspect to EB, or if the
lord of the 2d or ) be in the ascendant, Ol' lord of the lst
in the 2d, or benefics do ascend or be found unafllicted in
the 2d, or &l be·there, all these are testimonies that the que-
rent need fear no poverty. As the si~nificators may be

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 113
strong, and the testimonies numerous, the querent shall be
in proportion rich. Always remember to judge according
to his condition in life; for, quoad capax, it shall happen to
the interrogator.
B!J what Means attain it !
If the lord of the 2d be in the ascendant, -he may gain a
fortune unexpectedly, (especially if well aspected by Ill, and
this planet be strong), or gain it without much labour. lf
the lord of the 2d or the Moon promise substance by any
mutual aspect, observe from what bouse the aspect is, or
what house ]) rules; if neither of these promise substance,
see what house $ and its dispositor be in.
If the planet assisting be in the ascendant, the querent
will gain by his own industry, and, if he be a mechanic, by
his own labour, care, or invention. But if the assisting
planet be not lord of the 2d, be will gain by well managing
his own affairs, estate, &c.; or by such things as are of the
nature of that planet, the sign he is in being also con-
sidered.
If the lord of the 2d be in the 2d, he shall profit by his
own industry. If the lord of the 3d benefit the lord of the
2d, Ea, or other significators of wealth, he will be assisted
by his neighbours, brethren, or kindred; or by ren,1oving to
that quarter from whence the lord of the 3d throws the
aspect.
The lord of the 4th gives wealth by means of his father,
or some aged person ; or by taking lands, or purchasing
houses, &c.; or by well managing money lent him by his
kindred or neighbours; or property left him by his ances-
tors.
The lord of the 5th promises gain by cards or other
gambling; or stock-jobbing; or by holdmg office as an

ambassador or messenger. If a man oflow quality ask, by
keeping an inn, &c. or being porter to some institution,
or connected with theatres, &c. and such things as the 5th
house denotes.· It may be by well managing his father's
estate, or receiving something thereout.
The lord of the 6th gives gain by servants, dealing in
small cattle, &c., or by turning surgeon, &c. ifcapable.
The lord of the 7th gives gain by means of a wife, by the
sword or warfare, by contracting bargains in his way of
business, or by gaining some lawsuit, &c.
The lord ofthe 8th or planet therein denotes legacies, 'or
a wife's portion, which may be unexpected at the time,
(especially if Jol assist), or he may suddenly go and settle in
some country wherein he shall thrive and grow rich.
The lord of the 9th, &c. gives property by the wife's re-
lations, or some neighbour of her's when he did marry; or
some clergyman or lawyer shall befriend him ; or if !!D or
)( be in the 9th, he may thrive by a distant sea voyage.
But if an earthy sign be there, he may gain by removing to
the part signified by that sign, and by dealing in the com-
modities belonging to that country, &c.
The lord of the lOth, &c. promises gain by the service of
the king or some great man, holding office, &c. If the
querent be young and of small fortune, let him learn some
trade or business that may be shewn by the sign and planet
in the lOth.
The 11th and its lord denote unexpected benefit by
friends, or the employment ofsome king, nobleman or other
great person.
If the fortunate aspect be cast from the 12th or by its
lord, the querent will advance his f0rtune by great cattle or
horse-races; or if the sign be human, that is, n or·=, by
means of prisons, &c., such as being governor or turnkey

IN'l'ItODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 116
of a jail, a sheriff's officer, &c. If the sign be 'Y', t1, or }1',
by cattle; if 11)1., by corn. Herein mix your judgment with
reason.
The most assured testimonies of riches are if the lords of
the 1st, 2d, and 1f. be joined in the 2d, 1st, lOth, 7th, 4th,
or 11th houses ; or if not in o,if they apply by * or A
and be in mutual reception. If they apply by 0 or 8 , yet
have reception, the querent will gain wealth, though with
much labour and pains.
Signs ofPoverty, and its Cause.
If you find that the querent will not be rich, and he de..
sire to know why, that he may the better order his affairs
and be wary of snch difficulties as may threaten, then care.
fully observe as follows. . The planet affiicting most the
lords of the 2d and 1st, the }) , $, or their dispositors, or
the cusp of the 2d or planet therein, shews the cause. If
the lord of the lst, then the querent himself is the cause,
and the house in which he is found may shew how. The
lord of the 2d shews want of money or sufficient capital to
set up with. The lord ofthe 3d shews that his kindred or
neighbours will oppose him much or undersell him, &c.
And in this way you may go through the twelve houses,
• judging the reverse of what you were instructed when the
aspects, &c. were good.
Caution.-lf the lord of the 2d or the dispositor of$ be
infortunes, yet be strong and well aspected, they may de-
note gain as well as 1f. or ~ , though with less satisfaction
and more painstaking. Also 1f. or ~ being affiicted, may
obstruct as well as any other; for every planet must do the
work for which he is by Providence assigned. Again,
wherever 5 may be found, he denotes evil by that house1
as if in the 6th, by evil servants, sickness, &c.

The 7th and its lord denote the person of whom he means
to ask the money, and the 8th and its lord, &c., his pro-
perty. Observe whether the lord of the ascendant or ])
be joined with the significator of the quesited's property,
or be in good aspect with such significator. If this be so,
and that significator be a fortune or very strong, he shall
assuredly receive the money. If he be an infortune, and
there be reception between him and the querent's signifi-
cator, the querent will also receive his money, &c.; but if
the quesited's significator be an evil planet, and there be
no reception, he will hardly ever gain his desire, or with so
much delay and difficulty, he would rather wish the thing
undone.
In like manner if the lord of the 8th be in the 2d with
reception, it is a sign he shall gain his money, &c. But if
the lord of the 7th or 8th be in the 1st or 2d without recep-
tion with the querent's significators or lord of the 2d, be
shall not have his desire, but may rather expect prejudice
in the thing demanded.
Ifthe lord of the 1st and ]) be joined to a fortune that •
has dignity in the sign ascending or intercepted in the
ascel/dant, the matter will be ·effected; or if joined to an
infortune having such dignity, with reception, the business
will be dispatched. Or, if the significators be joined to a
fortune in the lOth or lith, though without reception, the
matter shall be perfected.
• When any planets arc found in a house signifying anything, they
may be taken as well as the lord of the house.

If one sltall acquire Gain, or Profit, Salary, 8;c. from
the Government, or any Nobleman, or Person of high
Rank, 8;c. ?
This question will serve for any other of the like nature,
where the querent is much inferior in rank to the person
he looks to for accomplishing his desires.
The ascendant, its lord and the ]) , represent the querent
as usual, and the lOth and its lord the quesited. The 2d
is the house of property for the querent, and the 11th for
the person inquired about.
If you find the lord of the 1st or the ]) joined to the
lord of the lith, or to any fortune· in the 11th, not affiicted,
you may affirm that the querent shall obtain his money,
salary, or debt, &c. Or if it happen that the ]) and lord
of the ascendant be joined to an evil planet with reception,
he may expect to succeed, but not without much solicita-
tion, and many weary efforts. If there be any evil aspect
between the significators, one being an infortune and without
• reception, the querent ,will never gain what he desires.
In this question be very careful to observe the planets'
true essential dignities, and their mutual receptions, and by
which of their mutual dignities they receive each other •.
Of tlte 'l'ime when tlte aforesaid Events treated of ill this
Chapter mag happen.
Herein diligently note to what planet the lord of the
ascendant or ]) applies, by &. or aspect. Consider how
many degrees are wanting of the perfect aspect or 6, and
say that it shall be as many days as there are degrees, if
they be butlt ill cadent houses; if both in succeedent houses,
so many weeks; if both in angles, so many months. But

if the matter cannot possibly be effected in days or weeks,
but requires much time, instead of months· say years, and
of weeks say months, and of days say weeks, &c. And
if one planet be in an angle, .and the other in a succe~~ent
house, they shall signify months ; one succeedent, and the
other cadent, they denote weeks ; and when one be angu-
lar and the other cadent, months •.
Some of the ancients have said, that if, at the time of a
question, the planet which signifies the pertection of the
thing demanded be in the same sign with the lord of the
ascendant, the matter shall be brought to conclusion \'/hen
they come to bodily conjunction; if the lord of the ascen-
dant be the heavier planet, and whether there he reception
or not. But if the lord of the ascendant be the lighter
planet, not without reception, unless they be in an angle
when the conjunction shall be effected, or that the other
planet be in one of his own houses, especially that which
is termed his joy t.
I have observed that reception by house, though the
aspect were a o,or even 8 , brings things to perfection; but
that other receptions avail not in this case.
As regards the time when; I find that if a fortune, or the
]) , or lord of the thing quesited, be in the ascendant, and
have any essential dignities therein, the number of degrees
between the planet and the cusp of the ascendant denote
the time ; days, if a movea~le sign, and the business capa-
ble of being quickly perfected; months, or years, accord-
ing to the sign and quality of the business.
• There appears a species of confusion in this arrangement, which
is the reverse of the usual system, of allowing angles to produce
events quicker than cadents. We should advise the student to be care-
ful in bis experiments before he adopt it.

lady of the ascendant, was near Cor Leonis, a star of great
virtu~ and influence ; ]) increasing in light, '1{. almost
culminating. Hence I formed this general judgment, that
he should live in good rank and quality among his neigh-
bours, &.c. (quoad capax) according to his calling. Secondly,
whether he should be rich or not 1 I considered that the
lord ofthe 2d is in the ascendant, and being also lord of e,
is near SpicaVirgina, in 18° ~·. Then '1{. (a generalsigni-
ficator ofwealth) was in his exaltation and angular, casting
his o to the cusp of the ascendant, which o in signs of
long ascension we usually repute a At. Also, that })
separated from a * of 3, lord of the 2d, &c. significator
of the thing demanded, and 6 of ~ , and applied to
6 -~ , the querent's significator; transferring the light and
virtue of both 3 and ~ to the proper significator of. the
qucrent. The dispositor of }) is 0, and he strong and
powerful, the e in a fixed sign, and in the terms of 3 ;
from all which I judged that the querent would acquire an
estate, and have a compete~t fortune; but as it is signified
by an infortune, that he would attain it by labour and care.
(And so to this day !te hath.) And as 3 , lord of the 7th
(the house ofmarriage), has the most material signification
of the thing demanded, viz. wealth, I advised him to
marry, and said, that without. marriage he should not so ,
well subsist.
2d QuERY.-By what Meana he should tittait£ Riches?

lord of the e and the second house; and placed in the

· ascendant, signifies property got by the querent's own indus-
try. And as 8 is lord of the 7th, I said, he would marry
a woman who would produce him a good fortune ; and it
more than he could well look for, and of a settled nature;
which I judged by $!,lady of his wife's house of property,
being so well fortified. And as )) was lady of the lOth,
(house of trade), and was transferring the light of Vand 8
to ~_his significator, I advised him to be diligent in his pro-
fession, and that he would thereby gain a good estate. (He
has since had a good jo1·tune with his wije, money a11d land,
and been very successful in trade.) Jupiter, so strong in
the lOth, was an infallible sign (according to natural causes)
of plenty of trade, or a gainful profession.
3d QuERv.-The Time when?
All the significators oriental, and five planets swift in
motion, promise property in a short time after the question;
and 8, the chief significator of the thing inquired after,
being swift in motion, argues the same. The distance from
the ascendant to 8 being about two degrees, signified about
two years, at which time he had a portion with his wife.
The )) wanted 60 27' of her 6 with $! ; hence I concluded
that about 1640 he should have very great trading, and live
in excellent repute; and as ~ is seated on the cusp of the
11th, (or house of friends), that he should have many good
friends, &.c. by whom he shoulq increase his estate.
4th QuERv.-.if the Querent should continue rich 1
This I resolved by the cusp of the 2d, which being a
fixed sign and E9 therein, and 'll- in his exaltation and an-
gular, and ~,the dispositor of 8, being in .Q, a fixed sign,
as also the )) in st, all implied that he should continue in
a plentiful estate, and that the riches God should bless him
with would be permanent, and that he should never be
reduced to want or povet'ty.
There was only one thing arising out of the figure, of

which I cautioned him. The 0, lord of the 11th, beholds
$ by o , as also the cusp of the 2d ; and as 0 here sig-
nifies friends, I exhorted him to avoid confiding in solar men,
though of much friendship with him. Jn all such cases de-
scribe the planet affiicting, and you give caution sufficient•.
CHAPTER XXVI.
OF THE THIRD HOUSE, VIZ. OF BRETHREN, SISTERS,
KINDRED, NEWS, SHORT JOURNEYS, &c.
THE chief, but not the only, questions regarding this house
are those conc.erning brethren, cousins, or neighbours, and
short journeys.
QuF.nv.-Shall the Querent agree well with his Brother
or Neighbour '#
The querent has the usual · significators ; the quesited is
shewn by the lord of the 3d, the cusp of the 3d, and the
planets therein. If the lord of the 3d be a benevolent
planet or be in the ascendant, or there be a fortune in
the 3d, or the respective lords be in good aspect or mutual
reception, or the lord of the ascendant throw a good as-
pect to the cusp of the 3d, no doubt unity will endure
between the parties. If the evil planets, or ~, be found
in the 3d, unless very well dignified and aspected, it de-
notes discord, and the querent may expect little good from
the quesited. If there be evil aspects between their signi-
ficators, the same judgment holds ; and if the significators
are affiicted by being peregrine, retrograde, or combust, it
shews hatred or untoward conduct.
T, or ~ in the 3d, shews the neighbours are ill-mannered
and the kindred selfish ; if 8 be there, the neighbours are
* The description of 0 in .st would herein answer the exact kind
of persons who might injure the querent's property.

dishonest, and the relations treacheraus. If they be out of
their dignities, these evils are increased ; and if ill planets
be in the ascendant, or ~ be there, the querent is himself
ill conducted.
Of an absent Brother?
The 1st, and its lord and ]) , are for the querent; the 3d
for the quesited ; and the 4th, his house of substance, &c.
Consider in what condition the lord of the 3d is, in what
house, and how aspected. If he be in the 3d, free from
evil aspects of the infortunes, you may judge that the ab-
sent brother is in health. If he be in his own house, but
afBicted by the evil planets, without reception, judge that
he is in health, but in great perplexity and sorrow; but if
they so aspect him with reception, say, that he is in distress,
but that he will shortly evade it, and rid himself of his
troubles. If the fortunes aspect him by * or A without
reception, or by o or 8 with reception, you may judge him
to be in health, and well contented ; and if they aspect
him by *or A, and there be reception, you may tell the
querent that his brother is healthy and happy, and wants
nothing in this world.
If the lord of the 3d be in the 4th, without aspects of
the malefics, he is endeavouring to get property in the
country where he then lives. If he be in the 5th, and
joined by 0 , or good aspect to the lord of the 5th, if the
latter be not much afBicted, he is healthy, jocund, and
merry, and likes the society he is in. If it be a fortune,
and there be a reception between the lords of the two
houses, the 3d and 5th (his 3d), you are assured of his
happy condition. Yet if it be a malefic, or he be in evil aspect
with a malefic in the 5th, without reception, or if he be
void of course while in the 5th, you may judge that he is
restless, and discontented in his present abode. Generally,
Digitized by Google
124 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
if he be afflicted in any but the 6th, 8th, or 12th houses,
he is not very comfortable, yet not in ill health.
If he be in the 8th, and well aspected by a fortune, he is
not in danger, yet he is indisposed. If he be joined to evil
planets by bad aspects out of the 6th,- he is in an infirm
and dangerous state. The same, if the lord of his 6th be
in the 3d, unless he have dignities therein. If, in this
case, the lord of the 3d be cS with the lord of his 8th, or
entering combustion at the same time, with other testimO-
nies of his being ill, there is reaslln to fear that he will die.
If you find his significator in the 7th, he is still in the
country he went to, and indifferently well.
If the lord of the 3d be in the 8th, he apprehends that
he shall die; and there is great fear of his death if his sig-
nificator be combust, in cS with the lord of the 8th, or
afflicted by evif planets.
If his significator be in the 9th, he is gone to some
country further off than where he first went, m· is forming
some clerical, legal, or scientific connexion, or is employed
travelling.
If he be in the lOth, and well aspected by the fortunes,
especially if with reception, he has got some good employ-
ment, or office, in the country to which he is gone. If com-
bust and afflicted, there is fe11r that he is dead.
If he be in the 11th, and joined to the lord of the lith,
it denotes he is well situated, with his friends, and happy ;
though if evil planets afflict him, he is not so well pleased
with his present condition.
If he be in the 12th, and well aspected, he is engaged
with horses or cattle, &c. keeping an inn, or is turned gl'a·
zier, &c. If ill aspected in this or the 2d house, he is in
trouble, and if in a fixed sign, probably in prison; yet, if
his significator be retrograde, he will manage to escape. If
Digitized by Coogle
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 125
in the ascendant, he is very pleasantly situated ; and, unless
ill aspected, he is much respected.
If any other person than a brother be inquired of, his
condition may be known by applying the foregoing rules to
that person's significator. As, for example, if the quesited
be the querent's father, let the lord of the 5th (the 2d
from the 4th) be considered for his substance. And if the
quesited be a f1·iend, let the 11th house represent him, and
then the 12th will be his 2d, or house of property ; the 8th
will be his lOth, or house of honour, &c. ; and so all round
the 12 houses. But understand that, though every house
has its 6th, 8th and 12th, yet of every person inquired after,
the 6th house of the figure shall signify his sickness, the
8th his death, the 12th his imprisonment.
Of Reports, News, Rumours, ~c. whether true or false?
and whether importi11g Good or Evil?
That which I found true by experience (in our late sad
times of war) was this : if I found l> in the ascendant,
lOth, lith, or 3d house, separating by benevolent aspect
from any planet, and then applying by good aspect to the
lord of the 1st ; I say, I found the report or rumour true,
but always tending to th~ good of the parliament, let the
report be good or ill. But if l> applied to the lord of the
7th by any good aspect, I was sure we had the worst, and
our enemies the victory. If the l> was void of course, the
news proved of no moment, usually vain and false, and
soon contl'adicted. If the l> and ~ were in ::s or 8, with-
out receptiqn, and neither casting a g~d aspect to the de-
gree ascending, the news was false, and reported purposely
to alarm us.
The time of erecting,the figure was ever the hour when
I first heard the rumour ; but, if another propounded it,
then that ve•·y minute when it was first proposed.

126 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
If, on hearing of any matter, you desire to know whether
it will be prejudicial to you or not, observe whether '1f. or
~ be in the ascendant, or }) or ~ in any of their essential
dignities, in * or A to the lord of the 11th; you may
then judge that the party inquiring shall receive no damage
thereoy. But if the lord of the 6th, 8th, or 12th, be in the
ascendant, or in evil aspect to the lord of the ascendant,
or a malefic retrograde in the ascendant, or affiicting its
lord, or the degree as~endiug, then the querent will be
prejudiced by the matter. But if it concern the public,
some damage has happened to their ministers or friends. In
this case, if T, denote the evil, he shews plundering, loss of
corn, or cattle, &c. ; ~ causes straggling parties to be cut
off, and military violence, bloodshed, &c. ; ~ the miscar-
riage of letters, or evil to the literary community, messen-
gers, &c.; 0 causes distress to the king, or some chief or
leader ; ~ causes ill to some gentlemen Ol' their friends.
The }) denotes violence by mobs, and, if she be afBicted,
injuries are done to the people.
If Rumours be true or false, according to the ANcJ ENTS.
If the lord of the ascendant, the moon, or her dispo-
sitor, be in an angle or a fixed sign, and in good aspect to
the fortunes, or the 0, you may judge the rumour is true.
If they be in moveable signs, cadent, and ill aspected by
the infortunes, judge the reverse; and consider the majo-
rity of the testimonies. When the angles of the figure, the
I> , and ~ , are in fixed signs, and these latter separate from
infortuneR and apply to fortunes, the rumour is true. Evil
rumours hold true, or will be in some way verified, if the
angles of the 4th and lOth are fixed, and the }) therein.
If you have evil news, yet if either fortune be in the ascen-
dant, or the I> fortunate, it is a strong argument - that
the rumours are false, and that they will turn rather to good
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 127
than evil. Mercury, or the planet to whom he or }) ap-
plies, being retrograde or afBicted, or if either of those two
be lord of the ascendant, it signifies that the rumour shall
vanish to nothing, or shall be converted to good. If the
lord of the ascendant be under the beams of 0 •, the mat-
ter is kept secret, and few shall ever know the truth.
Of Counsel or Advice given by a Neighbour, or Relation,
Friend, ~c.
Erect the figure when first the party begins to break
their mind, and you shall know whether they really wish
you well or not, and whether it be good to follow their
advice.
If there be in the lOth house either G, 'lf., i , or Q , or
.if 1> apply by good aspect to the lord of the ascendant,
judge they come with an honest heart, and the advice is
intended for your good. If fA'· T,, 3 , or, ~ be there, or
if }) apply by evil aspect, they intend deceitfully. Haly
affirms, that if the sign ascending be moveable, and the })
and lord' of the ascendant are both in moveab_le signs, the
party comes to deceive t.
Of short Journeys, whether good to go or not~
By a short journey, I mean such distances as a person
may go and come back in a day or two. Considet· the lord
of the ascendant, and whether he be swift in motion, ancl in
the 3d, or in any of the dignities of the lord of that house;
or in good aspect with its lord, or a planet tberein; or if
the ) apply to such aspect, or be in the 3d, or cast her *
* This signifies within a distance of 12 degrees of 0· Modern
authors say 17 degrees.
t If the advice be intended for your benefit, yet it may not be
weU to follow it. This may be seen by the lord of the 4th, and
planets therein ; for if malefics be there, or the lord of the 4th af-
tlict the lord of the ascendant, it will end ill : if good planets be
there, it ends well.~ZAD.

or l:l. to the degree ascending, or be swift in motion; all
these are arguments that the party shall go his short jour-
ney, and have success. The part of heaven in which the
place lies to which he would go is known by the situation
of J), the sign on the cusp of the 3d, or its lord, whichever
may be strongest in .essential dignities. If the chief signi•
ficator be in a northern sign, he goes north, and so of the
rest.

into the west of England, and no news being heard of him
for many weeks, his brother, with great importunity, movid

I judged the absent brother was alive, and bad bad no
manner of accident, but was in good health.
2d QuERv.-When he should hear of him'?
~ lady of the 3d applies to a friendly A of }] , lord of
the ascendant, and }] , being retrograde, applies also to the
aspect of ~ ; a very good argument that the querent should
hear news of his brother very suddenly. And if you look
into the Ephemeris for 7th November, 1645, you will find
that, about four o'clock on that very day, the A a~pect
between ~ and }] was formed. I therefore advised the
querent to go to the carriers of those countries where he
knew his brother bad been, and ask ,when they saw the
quesited ; for I told him that it was probable that he
should hear of him that very day. (He has since co'!fi-
dentl}j affirmed, that about the very moment of time, viz.
about four, a carrier came casually where he was, and in-
formed him that his brother was living, and in health.)
Where he was ?
His journey was into the west. At time of the question
I find~, his significator, leaving t, a north-east sign, and
entering J-J>, a south sign; whereon I judged he was in the
south-east part of the county unto which he went. And
as ~ was not far out of the ascendant, and was in the
oriental quarter of heaven, that he was not above one or
two days' journey from London; and as ~ was leaving t ,
and entering a sign in which she has dignities by triplicitg

and term, I judged the man was leaving the .country
where he had no possession or habitation, and was
coming to his own house in London, where he had good
property. As ~ wanted one degree of getting out of
the sign, I judged he would be at home in less than one
week, for t is a common sign, and one degree therein in
this question might well denote one week. He came home
on the following Tuesday, when »came to 6 ~,she being

In 1643, his Majesty's army being then rampant, several
reports were given out that his Majesty had taken Cam-
bridge, &c. : a well-affected person inquired of me If the
news were true or false 1 whereupon I erected this figure,
and gave judgment:-" All that we heard was untruth, and
that the town neither was or should be taken by him or his
forces."

'Secondly, the ) was cadent, and in n, a sign wherein
she is very weak : a second such argument.
Thirdly, the &3 on the cusp of the ascendant was a
sign of good to the Parliament, for the first house signified
that honourable society. ~ , lady of the ascendant, was in
her exaltation, but 3 , lord of the 7th, our enemies, in his
fall, viz. $;, and afBicted by o of T, • The D separating
from 'lf. in the 7th, and transferring his light to ~ , gave
reason to expect that there would come good to our side by
this report or rumour, and no benefit to tlie enemy. The
o of T, and 8 assured me that our enemies were so full
of division and treason, and so thwarting one the other's
designs, that no good should come unto them by this re-
port. And so,·in short, I judged that Cambridge was not
taken, and that what we heard was false •.

the lord of the 3d is found, is fruitful, and the ) applies
to ~ : signs that the querent might expect both, but chiefly
sisters, as the signs are mostly feminine.

CHAPTER XXVII.
OF THE FOURTH HOUSE, AND JUDGMENTS DEPENDING
THEREON.
This is the House of Parents, .Lands, Tenements, Cities,
Towns, Villages, Farms, Castles, Treasure found, $rc., or of
any Thing hidden i11 the G1'ound; also of the Grave.
RuLE.-To Find a Thing hidden or mislaid.
BE careful to consider to whom the thing hidden, &c.
may belong : if the goods did belong to the querent, take
the lord of the 2d ; but if to his brother or sister, regard
the lord of the 4th; if to his father, the lord of the 5th;
if to his mother, the lord of the 11th, and so of other per-
sons; if to a stranger to thfl querent, or one who is no rela-
tion, take the lord of the 8th. If you find the lord of the
house of property is in any angle, ju~ge the thing missing
is within the house of him who is the owner. And
if the lord of the propet'ty is in the ascendant, or dis-
posed of by the lord of the ascendant, by house, or in
the same sign with him, say it is in that part of the
house wherein he most frequents, or lays up his go.ods, or
such things as he most delights in. But if the lord of the
quesited's property be in the lOth, it is then in his shop, if
he keep one, or, if he be a gentleman, in his dining-room ;
if he be a farmer, it is in the common room of the resi-
dence, or first room after you enter the house. If the lord
of the property be in the 7th, it is then in that part where
the quesited's wife or his maid-servants have most to do.
If in the 4th, it i.9 where the most aged of the house lodges,
or formerly did most frequent; or in the middle of the
house, or in the most ancient part, or where his father or
some elderly man lodged. The nature and quality of the
place are known by the signs the significators are in ; for if
the sign of tl-.e second be airy, or the 11:reater part of the

significators, including the sign where $ is, be the same,
the thing is hid in the eaves, or the uppel' part of·the room
where it is, or on high from the ground ; and if the thing
be in an orchard or garden, it is higher than the ground, or
upon some tree, line, &.c., or is on the highest hill or part
of £he ground. If the said significators be strong, and in
watery signs, it is in the dairy, or washhouse, brewhouse,
or near water. If they be in fiery signs, it is near the
chimney, or the walls of the house, or where iron is found.
If in earthy signs, the thing is on th~ ground or earth, or
near some pavement or floor; and if the thing lost be
out of the house, it will be found near the bridge, stile, or
gate, where people com~ into the grounds.
If the significator be going out of one sign into another,
the thing is behind something, or fallen between two
rooms, or near the threshold ; and it is higher or lower ac-
cording to the sign being airy, &.c.
If a thing be lost; and not stolen, consider the follow-
ing points :-
1. The sign ascending, its nature, and the quarter of
heaven it denotes.
2. The sign the lord of the ascendant is in.
3. The sign of the 4th house.
4. The sign the lord of the 4th is in.
5. The sign the ) is in.
6. The sign of the 2d house.
7. The sign the lord of the 2d is in.
8. The sign (B is in.
Then examine the greater number of testimonies to di~
cover what quarter of heaven the thing is in, as regards the
parts of the house. Having found the bearing, or point of
the compass, observe the nature of the sign, viz. airy signs,
above ground; fiery, near a wall, or partition; earthy, on
the floor; watery, near a moist place in the room, &.c.

Of Buging and Selling Lands, Houses, Farms, !fc.
The ascendant, its lord, and the ) , are for the buyer, and
the 'ith, its lord, and planets therein, for the seller. The
4th, its lord, and planets therein, signify the land, or house,
&c. And the lOth house, its·lord, and planets therein, sig-
nify the price; that is, whether it will be sold cheap or dear.
If you find the lords of the 1st and 7th in good aspect,
and the lord of the 7th apply by good aspect (or if by evil
aspect with reception) to the lord of the ascendant, you
may judge the seller has good will to the buyer ; and if
they are at all dignified, the purchase will be effected ; but
if the aspect be evil, there will be much bargaining and
dispute before all be settled.
If the lord of the ascendant, or ) , apply to the lord of
the 4th, or this planet apply to them, or if they be in each
other's placeM, viz. the lord of the 1st, or 1> in the 4th, or
the lord of the 4th in the ascendant, and there be any re-
ceptioA, the purchase will be effected.
But if there be no dwelling in houses as above, yet the
D transfer the light of the lord of the 4th to the lord of
the ascendant, the bargain will be concluded, though by
brokers or agents, rather than by the principals.
If none of the above rules hold, there will be no bargain
made.
Of the Qualitg of tlte Land or Houses, !fc.
If you find the infortunes in the 4th, especially if they
be peregrine, or the lord of the 4th retrograde or afllicted,
it will never continue long with the buyer's posterity, or
benefit him.

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 137
But if 1f., i , or Q , be in the 4th, or the lord of the 4th
be strong and well aspected, the purchaser may expect
good success with the property; and if a fixed sign be in
the 4th, it will continue in the family of the purchaser.
If an infortune possess the ascendan~. the tenants or
occupiers are evil and deceitful, and will give trouble. If
a fortune be there, or Q, judge the •·ever~e. In the former
case, if the evil planet be retrograde, the tenants will de-
camp without paying their rent, or will throw up their
leases.
If in the lOth house there be a fortune, and it direct, the
timber will be profitable, or the house will let well. If it
be:retrograde, there are many trees, but they not profitable.
If there be an infortune direct, there are few trees, or the
house will not let well ; and if he be retrograde, the tim-
ber will be stolen, or the rent will be either stolen after
payment, or no payment be well and truly made. If
there be no planet in the lOth, consider the lord of the
house, and, as he may be strong or weak, judge the result
of the profits, whether by timber, &c. or by lt:tting the
house, &c. But the angle of the 7th must be considered
in like manner, to judge the quality of the grass, com, or
herbage, &c. As regards the description of the ground,
look to the 4th house; and if you find a fiery sign on its
cusp, the ground is in general hilly, dry, and hard; the
more so, if the lord of the 4th be in a fiery sign, viz. t'f',
.n, t. If there be an earthy sign on the cusp, ,the ground
is plain, level, and good pasture land, or for tillage. If
there be an airy sign thereon, the ground is of a mixed
nature, part hilly and part plain, partly good and partly
bad. .If the sign be watery, then there is plenty of water,
a brook, or rivulet, &c. thereon. And if an info~tune
be in the 4th, and retrograde or peregrine, the land will
partake greatly of the nature of that infortune ; as if 1tJ.

full of rushes; if he be afflicted, so much worse is the land.
And if the land lie near the sea, you may fear an overflow,
or that the banks are damaged, &c. If q be in the 4th in
a fiery sign, the land is barren, and wants water; if he be
afflicted, it is utterly stony and worthless. If q be there
in an airy sign, the land is defective; and if he be afflicted,
especially in II, the management of it has been bad and
unthrifty. If he be there in an earthy sign, the land is
tolerably good, but heavy, clay land; and _if he be afflict-
ed, the farmers are dull, and too poor to manage it well.
In like way judge of the standing of a house or build-
ing: if it be a watery sign, there will be much damp ; and
if q be there in 1fl, it is overrun with rats.
Ofthe Cheapness or Dearness oftl1e Land or Houses, ~c.
This is known by the lord of the lOth ; for if he be angu-
lar and strong, the price will be high, and the seller will
stand upon his terms ; but if he be weak, cadent, afflicted,·
&c., the price will not rise high.
If it be good for ~he Querent to take or lease the House,
Farm, or Land, 8)c.
The lOth house, &c., will herein shew the profit or ad-
vantage to be made by the undertaking, having regard also
to the usual significators of property, viz. the lord of the 2d,

to the degree on the cusp and not afHicted, the querent
will take the house or farm, &c., and find it a good
bargain.

perty; or if he have already taken it, he has no mind to it,
and will quickly put it off to another party.

If you find the lord of the 7th in the 7th, or casting a
good aspect to its cusp, or there be benetics therein, the
man will keep his word in the bargain, but he will profit
by it more than the querent.
If an infortune be in the 7th and not lord of the 7th,
have great care of the covenants or agreements between
you; for the landlord will be too hard for you, as he minds
nothing but his own ends in the matter.
Consider the lOth house ; and if a fortune be there or
behold its cusp by good aspect,1 the parties, notwithstand-
ing some rubs, will proceed in their bargain, and the land,
&c. wiJl be let to the querent.
If you find an infortune in or in evil aspect to the lOth,
the bargain will be broken off. If it be land, they differ
about the timber, &c., or upon the erecting of some new
buildings; and if the thing be a house, &c., they differ
about the repairs.
As to the end of the matter, see to the 4th house. If
fortunes be there, or the lol'd of the 4th behold the cusp
favourably, it will end well, and both parties will be pleased;
but if an infortune be there, or the lord ofthe house aspect
it by c or 8, the whole matter will end. ill, and will please
neither party.
QuERY.-Sha/l tlte Querent enjo!J the Estate of his
Father?
Ifin this question you find the lords of the 2d and 5th in
reception and in each other's houses, there is no doubt that
the querent shall have a competent .fortune out of his
father's estate. But if the lonl of the father's property be
retrograde or afflicted, then some part ofthe estate intended
for the querent will be wasted or otherwise disposed of.
If you would know why or how, see what planet impe-
dites the lord of the 5th, and what house he is lord of. If
it be the lord of the 6th, it may be one of the father's bro-

thers, or sisters, or neighbours shall prevail on the father to
alter his intentions towards the querent. If it be the lord
of the 7th, it may be some female, or his wife, or some per-
son with whom the querent has quarrelled, that will cause
his father to alter his mind. If it be the lord of the 12th,
it is some one of the mother's kindred, or it may be, (espe-
cially if ~),some minister or clergyman. Now, if, upon
describing the party, the querent is well informed of who
it is, and is desirous to gain the person's good will, and so
to diminish their malice, let him do as follows : on the ap-
proach of any *,1::J., or cS between the planet signifying
that party and the lord of the ascendant, let the day be
observed in the Ephemeris when the )) separates from one
and applies to the other, (by good aspect if possible), and on
that day endeavour a reco!lcilement; and it is not to be
doubted that he may obtain his desire, as I have found
many times by good experience •.
If the lord of the 5th dispose of the $, and be in the
ascer.dant or 2d, the querent shall gain his desires~ ~ or
~ in the 5th, casting a *or A to any planet in the 2d,

If )) separate from the lord of the 5th, and go imme-
diately to *or 1::J. of the lord of the 2d m· of the ascendant,
it shews assured hopes of acquiring the property of the
father.
Ifyou find an infortune ill dignified in the 4th, the father
has no inclination to part with his money ; nor will it be
well to move him much thereto, until that unfortunate planet
be transited out of the sign. But if you cannot stay so
long, obset·ve when that planet is direct, swift in motion,
oriental, in * or t::J. with ~ or ~ or the lord ofthe ascend-

observing those influences will not compel the ·father's
mind, but will cause more benevolent intentions.
If the lords of the 2d and 5th apply to any good aspect
by retrogradation, the querent will receive some pt·operty
from his father suddenly, before he thinks of it: Ifthere
be any good aspect, reception, &c., between the lord of the
4th and any other planet, stronger than there is between
th~ lord of the 4th and the lord of the ascendant, the father
regards the party signified by that other planet better than
the querent: ifit be the lord of the 3d, or any planet in the
3d, then it is one of the querent's brothers, &c.
Of removingfrom one House or Place to another.
Observe the ascendant, the 4th and 7th houses, and their
lords, planets therein, &c.
If the lprd of the 4th be in the 7th, and he a good planet,
and the lords of the 1st and 7th be good also and sti'Ong,
it is then better to remain where you are. But if the lord
of the 7th be with a good planet, and the lord of the 4th
with an evil one, it is then not well to remain. Ifthe 1> or
lord of the ascendant separate from ill aspects of the infor-
tunes, and they lords of the 4th or 7th, or from the lords of
the 6th, 8th, or 12th ; or if an evil planet be in the ascend-
ant or 4th; or if the lord of the 2d be weak, I advise the
querent to remove. And if the lord of the 6th be in the as-
cendant, or afflict its lord or the )) , I have found that the
querent has ill health wht>l'e he is, or is troubled by evil ser-
vants. Ifthe lord of the 12th be the afflicting planet, he has
backbiting, treacherous neighbours. And ifthe E9 was in the
6th, 8th, or 12th, or the lord of the 2d was in ill aspect to the
lord of the ascendant, I have found that he went back in the
world, &c. If the lord of the lOth affi.ict, I judged that
he was unfortunate in trade, or had lost his credit. If the

house, &c. The lord of the 7th shews injury by an oppo-
- site neighbour, who undersells him, &c.
In giving advice which way to steer his course in hopes
of better success, I observe what planet in the scheme is
strongest, and has the best aspect to the lords of the ascend-
ant or 2d ; and according to the quarter of heaven the sign
that planet is in signifies, I advise the querent to remove.
I do not remember that any ever repented the following
my advice, though many have afterwards returned me both
thanks and rewards •.
If l> separate from a fortunate planet, stay; if she sepa-
rate from an infortune, remove. An infortune in the ascend-
ant, or a fortune in the 7th, remove; but a fortune in the
ascendant, or infortune in the 7th, remain.
OJ Treasure, Mines, !\"c . concealed in the Ground.
To discover mines or any other thing supposed to be
concealed in any place, the querent must observe whether
there be any planet strongly dignified in the 4th house;
and the nature of the treasure, mine, &c. may be judged
of by that planet, if he have any affinity with the 7th
house. The nature of the mine, &c. will depend on the
nature of the planet. If l] be lord of the 7th and in the
4th dignified, he signifies good coal mines ; or if the ques-
tion were of stone, then there is a good quarry. And so
judge of the others according to their nature and strength
-in essential dignities.

I had a desire to know if I should deal with the seller, and
procure money in convenient time to pay for the purchase,
my own money being in such hands that I could not call it
in under six months' notice. Being desirous, I say, to
purchase the said houses, and fully resolved upon it, I took
my own question myself, at the time I found my mind
most perplexed and solicitous about it. The time of the
query to myself fell out according to the position of heaven
following.

there but the 0, this signified that there was no other
purchaser about it at present but myself. The 0 so exalted
and angular, denoted that the seller was high in his de-
mands, (aud so he was), nor was he necessitated to part
with it. Finding my significator received of 0 and so near
the cusp of the 7th, was an argument that I should pro-
ceed in the business, notwithstanding the many debilities
of ~ . For as 0 was lord of the 7th, so also was he lord of
the 11th; signifying that my hopes should not be faustrated.
And ~ also was applying to A of 1,, lord of the 4th, viz.
the houses inquired after, and had no frustration, &c., be-
fore the perfect aspect ; a strong argument that I should
buy the houses. Both significators applied to the a~pect,
1, being retrograde, I also considered that 0 was in A to
1, , the 0 being lord of my 11th and 1, of the 4th; and
as 1, beholds the ascendant and has dignities therein, he,
therefore, had signification of myself. Now, whether you
consider him as having dignities in the ascendant or as lord
of the 4th, the lord of the 11th and he applying by a A,
argued assuredly that I should proceed and in the end
conclude for the houses. The }) in the next place trans-
lating the influence of 3 , lord of the 7th, to 1, , having
virtue in the ascendant, though by a o out of signs oflong
ascension, did much facilitate the matter ; but argued my
contracting leisurely and slowly, because of the o aspect.
And as )) is affiicted and ~ unfortunate, so I had much
trouble and many meetings about it; the seller not abating
one penny of £530, being the fir~~t money he demanded.
As 0 is near to a *of ~, so did a jovial man endeavour

Ioper to intervene, though some offered fair to hinder me.
As I, lord ofmy 2d, was retrograde, it denoted that I should
get none of my own money to supply my occasions. '1l-,
lord of $ ,in * to 0, no ways impedited, but by being in
detriment, in platic * with the lady ofthe ascendant, gave
me such hopes, that I doubted not of procuring money
when he entered !!D, his exaltation, and t became direct;
which he did twelve days after, when a friend lent me
£500.
The qualities of the houses are shewn by ~, the sign on
the 4th, and by l} , lord thereof, who having no material de-
bilities, (except being t·etrograde and cadent), and being also
in A to 0, the houses were really old, but strong and able
to stand many years. When i and 0 came to & in ~
(25th April), I bargained; and on the }) to & i , (May
17th), I paid in £530, and my conveyance was sealed. As
i wanted 6 degrees of being & with 0, so was it six
weeks and some days from the time of the question until I
perfected what the figure promised.
As to the moles and scars on my body, it exactly agrees:
for as i is in rr, which represents the face, so have I a
mole on my cheek, about the middle of it; and as .a.
ascends, I have one on the reins of my back. The ) in
"Jt, afflicted by t, I have a red mole below the navel. 'll.,
lord of the 6th in n, a masculine sign, I have a mole near
my right hand, visible on the outside; so have I one on the
left foot, as )(, the sign on the 6th, signifies.
I had a hard bargain, as the figure every way considered
manifests ; and shalt never live to see many of the leases
yet in being expire. And as i is in rr, the sign opposite
her own house, so did I do myself injury by the bargain;
I mean in matter of money : but the love I bore to the
house I now live in, wherein I lived happily with a good
master full seven years, and therein obtained my first wife,

God, do I repent it, finding God's blessing in a plentiful
measure upon my labours.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
OF THE FIFTH HOUSE, AND ITS QUESTIONS.
If one shall have Children, yea or nay?
HEREIN generally consider whether the signs ascending
and on the 5th house be fruitful • ; whether the lord of the
ascendant or the )) be in aspect with the lord of the 5th,
and if so, whether the lord of the 5th be strong, and also
the planet or planets in the 5th or in aspect with its lord.
These are signs the querent shall have children before they
die. Also if the lord of the 5th be in the ascendant, or the
lord of the ascendant be in the 5th, it is a strong argument
of children. If there be translation of light or collection
between the significators, you may still judge that there
will be children, but not so speedily as if it had been fore-
seen by the form~r manner of judgment.
Ifa Woman ask, whether she may ltave a Child?
If a married woman ask, consider whether the lord of
the ascendant be in the 5th or 7th, or the lord of the 5th
be in the ascendant or 7th, or lord of the 7th in the 5th, or
the )> with him, or good planets in the ascendant, or with
the lord of the 5th or in the angles: she may then conceive.
But if none of these testimonies concur, and you find bar-
ren signs and planets in the aforesaid situations, (especially

if infortunes be angular and fortunes cadent), she neither
hasconceived at present nor will hereafter. If good and
evil planets be mixed, she may have children, but they will
not live. If n, Q., or IIJI., be on the ascendant or 5th, and
JA, T, , 3 , or 0 in the 5th, it is a strong sign of barrenness.
But 0 rather causes the death of children than prevents
their birth.
Whether a Man shalllwve Cltildren by his Wife, or !tis in-
tended Wije? Or, whether a Woman may by her Hus-
hand,·~c.
Observe the ascendant, its lord, and the }) ; and if the
lord of the ascendimt or }) be joined to the lord of the 5th,
they shall have issue by the party inquired of. If this be
not, observe whether translation or collection of light occur
between the significators, or whether ll or lord of the
ascendant be in the 5th, or the lord of the 5th in the
ascendant. These are all testimonies in the affirmative.
If 11. or i be in the 5th no way afflicted, a child will be
very speedily born ; and if they, or either of them, be in
the ascendant or lith, there will be children, but not so
speedily. But· if the fortunes be afflicted while in those
places, there is danger of the child being born dead, or
dying shortly after birth. If there be signs of children,
yet i be afBicted by T, or 3 , there is danger of some
accident, &c. to the mother before the birth.
If T,, or 3, or ~, (and JA, if afflicted), be in the 5th,_or
the two former cast their 8 to its cusp, the woman i~ not
with child, nor will be. The o of the infortunes to the
cusp of the bth denotes no conception, unless they be
strong and there be other good testimonies. The lord of
the 5th, weak, &c., denotes ·a sickly child.

She is not with ckild, if ~ or ~ be affiicted. If ~ be
joined to T, or 3, (or to W, if he be ill aspected), and
they be combust, retrograde, or in st, nJt, or J'J. If 'f1 or
3 be in the 5th, in o , or 8 , to its lord, they denote no
conception; but if other testimonies be more powerful, and
denote conception, they shew danger of abortion.
The lord of the ascendant joined to a retrograde planet,
or to one in a cadent house, or received by a retrograde or
combust planet, or if no aspect or translation of light be
between the lords of the 1st and 5th, are all signs of no
conception; but judge by the majority of testimonies.
Is the Child Male or Female?
The lords of the ascendant, the 5th, and the ~, and the
signs on the ascendant and 5th being masculine, denote a
male; if they be, on the contrary, feminine, thP. child will
be a female.-N. B. Unless this be a part of the question,
do not attempt to give a judgment; nor then either, unless
there be a great majority of testimonies on one or the other
side. The sign the dispositor of the J) is in may also be
considered.
Whether the Child shall live or die ?
The lord of the 5th retrograde, combust, or cadent, or
being in his fall or detriment, and affiicted by the lord of
the 8th of the figure, or the 8th from the 5th, (which is the
12th), are signs oftleath. Or if the lord of.the 5th, being
weak, be affiicted by an evil planet in the 8th or 12th,
unless some opposite testimonies occur, it may be expected
the child will speedily die. If the lord of the ascendant
be in tbe 5th, and be affiicted as above, or if ¥ , T, , 3 , or
~, be in the 5th, especially if retrograde, they.denote the
same.
Whether there shall be Twins?
If suspicion be of twins, and you find, upon that ques-
tion, the ascending sign be double-bodied, and a fortune

llSO INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
therein, or the same of the 5th house, and 0 and ]) be in
double-bodied signs, and the lords of tbe ascendant and
5th be the same, you may judge twins. But unless all, or
nearly all, these testimonies concur, it is not safe so to judge.
-N. B. The dispositor of the 1> , that is the planet in whose
house she is; may also be considered. Moreover, if the
Q be with either 11-, i , or the 1> , or that all these be in
either n, t!Jt, t, or )(, it is a farther testimony of the
woman bearing twins.
How long tlte Woman has been pregnant?
Observe the lord of the ascendant, the 5th, or the ) ;
see which is nearest from any aspect which is past, and
then judge according to the nature of the aspect. If the
s~pa:ratiun be from a Ll., say she is in the 5th month of her
conception, or the 3d ; if it be a *, she is in the 2d
or 6th month ; if a o, sh~ is in the 4th month ; an 8,
gives the 7th month ; and if it be a cS , then she has been
pregnant only one month.
Of the 1'ime whm the Birth shall take place?
Observe when 8 or 0 are in cS with the lord of the
5th, or there be a cS of the lord of the 5th with the lord of
the ascendant in the 5th house; about that time the birth
may be expected. Observe, also, when the lord of the
ascendant goes out of one sign into another ; that also is a
probable period for the birth. See, also, bow far the lord
of the 5th is from the cusp of the 5th, and give to every
sign o~e month. Judge according to the majority of these
testimonies •.
• This is rather a difficult point to decide; and unless the querent
have great anxiety on the subject, which in some ~ascs may happen,
we advise the $tudent to avoid giving judgment, or at least till he has
well oatisficd himself, by experience, of the right method. We be-
lieve it will generally be found, that at the time of the birth the 0 is
passing some aspect of the cusp of the 5th, or its lord.

OF AMBASSADORS OR MESSENGERS.
The lord of the 5th and the ]) may be considered to
represent the ambassador or messenger. The planet to
whom either of them apply shall shew the cause and nature
of the message.
If you find the application be from a fortune by o , 8 ,
or 0 , and there be reception between them, or collection
or translation, and that planet be in the lOth, or lord
thereof, the embassy is on some high _
and important matter
of a political nature. If the planet who is received, or
translates, or collects, be lord of the 11th, he comes to
renew leagues of friendship. If the lord of the 5th be
afflicted or weak in the 7th, and the lord of the ascendant
and he be in evil aspect, and ~ aspect either of them
evilly, there is no sign ofany peace or permanent benefit aris-
ing from this embassy or message. According as the lord of
the 5th and ]) be well affected to the ascendant, its lord, and
planets therein, you may predict advantage to the querent
or his nation, according as it be respecting a public or
private matter.
Of a Message sent for Money.
The message is shewn by the 11 , the meBBenger by the
lord of the 5th : the other significators as usual.
If the lord of the 5th separate from the lord of the 7th,
and apply to the lord of the ascendant, you may judge the
messenger has effected the thing he went for, and is re-
turning home. If the lord of the 5th separate from the
lord of the 2d, he brings money. The answer the messen-
ger brings is of the nature of that house from whose lord
the lord of the 5th separates, and also of the nature of the
planet himself. Therefore, if he separate from a good
planet, it gives hopes of a good answer; the contrary, when

he separates from evil planets. If the lord of the 5th ap-
ply by o , or 8 , to an infortune, before he is separated
from the lord of the 7th, the messenger has had some im-
pediment in effecting his business by the party to whom he
was sent, and bas also sustained some hinderance on his
journey before he arrived at the place. But if .this appli-
cation to an infortune happen qfter the lord of the 5th was
separated from the lord of the 7th, the messenger will have
delays and misfortunes on his return. If you find an
infortune (especially 1) in the 9th, he will hardly travel
safe for thieves; but if a fortune be there, his going and
returning will be safe.
If there be reception, (though they apply by o or 8 )
between the lords of the 5th and 7th, the messenger will
be well received ; but the evil aspect shews some delay or
excuse framed by the party to whom the messenger is sent.
As to the messenger's return; when the lord of the 5th
comes to a *or 6. of the lord of the ascendant, that day,
or near it, the messenger is heard of; or when ) separates
from the lord of the 5th, and applies to the lord of the
ascendant, the querent shall have intelligence of his mes-
senger. The application of the significator to a ponderous
planet shews more certainly the day. Use discretion in
judging the nature of the journey, its length, &c. And,
according to the natut·e of the signs and houses in which
the applying planet may be found, expect the return to be
in days, weeks, months~ &c.

QUERY.-IF THE PERSON ASKING THE QUESTION

Judgment upon the preceding Figure.
The ascendant is here tr.Jt, a barren sign; the sign of the
5th is "'J', an indifferent sign in this question, but rather
barren, as being the house of J,. The lord of the 5th, J,,
is retrograde in t ; and the lord of the ascendant, ~ , is in
n, both signs more barren than fruitful. The ) is in
the terms of 3 , and in o to J,·, lord of the 5th. ~ , lord of

of barrenness; and I therefore delivered the following judg-
ment, viz., that the querent neither had been, nor ever
would be, pregnant, being naturally barren; for finding the
chief angles afBicted by malefics, it was certain that the
evil which prevented her from conceiving had been long
upon her, and would continue. I found no one promising
testimony; so I declared, positively, that she never would
have any children, according to the rules of the science.
The }) being in o to T:1 , and ~ , lord of the 1st, apply-
ing to his 8, the querent was very sickly, afflicted with
wind and cholic ; f7 in the ascendant, shewed great pain
in the head; and ~ in n, shewed the same •.
The querent's moles, &c. agreed exactly with the figure,
viz. one mole close by the navel; one upon the right ancle;
one towards the right knee, on the inner side of the thigh;
one near the member shewn by the ) in t1J1. ; and one on
the outside of the right arm.

IN the first place, we ought to take the figure for the
exact moment of the person falling sick, or rather of being
obliged to take to his bed •.
Secondly, if that cannot be had, accept of that time
when fii'St any person spoke to a physician, &c. regarding
the patient. And if it was with his consent, the ascendant
will signify him ; but if unknown to him, the ascendant ·
will denote the querent; and the house describing his
relation to the person speaking of the sickness will de-
scribe the patient. (This is, supposing the physician to
be an astrologer, which they formerly were; but if the
patient's friend speak to an astrologer, the same rule holds.)
Thirdly, or let the physician note the time of his own first
speaking with the patientt, and let a figure be erected for
that moment.
• If the illness be produced by an accident, then take the time at
which it occurred.
t Our author adds, " or when first the urine was brought to him."
This makes it evident that the water doctors, as they were termed,
even until a very recent period, ha~ recourse to astrology to ascertaill
the nature and result of their patients' diseases. We are quite sure,
from long experience, that. these may be accurately leamed by the
science; and we believe that many medical men call it to their aid
even now. The day is coming when this will be generally the case.

Then consider carefully, first, the ascendant and planets
therein; secondly, the 6th house, and planets therein;
thirdly, the sign and house wherein the Moon is; fourthly,
how she is affected or aBlicted, by what planet, in what
house that planet is, and of what house he is lord.
What Part cif the Body is afflicted f
If the ascendant be aBlicted by an evil planet, and he
retrograde, combust, peregrine, slow in motion, or in 0 or
8 to the lord of the 4th, 6th, 8th, or 12th, the disease is
then ill the head, or in that part or parts of the body which
the plan~t or planets signify in the sign then ascending.
For example ; if ~ ascend, and J, therein, the sick
party is aBlicted in the head, because the ascendant signi-
fies the head ; and also has some disorder in the bowels,
reins, or secrets, because J, in !Zi5 signifies those parts; or
else with some rotten cough, as J, denotes coughs, and S!l5
rules the breast. If the lord of the ascendant, j) , or lord
of the 6th, be in a sign signifying the same member or
parts as J, , or if the sign on the 6th rept·esent the same,
your judgment will be more cet'tain; I may say, infalli-
ble•. ·
I also would observe, in like manner, the 6th house, its
sign, lord, and planet in it. Also observe carefully the
sign and house where J) is, her separation and applica-
tion. And you may then venture safely to give judgment
as to what part of the body of the sick person is grieved,
and of the nature and quality of the sickness.
• In all cases where the J) is afflicted by either J, or t, we should
regard the rules for that situation as of the chief importance ; we
bave never known them fail.

Whether the Disease will be long or short.
Have regard to the time of year, and consider that dis-
eases commencing in the winter are ·usually longer, and
those in summer shorter.
Diseases which proceed from I, are more permanent,
and are generally regulated much by the motion of the 0.
Those of a hot and dry nature, which are influenced by ~
and 0, are short, and regulated by the motion of ]) • I,
causes long chronic complaints, falls, bruises, blows, &c.;
'lf. and 0 shorter; ~ short, violent, and quick, such as
cuts, bleedings, &c. ~ a mean between both, and such
as proceed from intemperance; ~ various and changeable,
' such ns fits, &c. ; ]) such as return at. periods, as the fall-
ing sickn(lss or epilepsy, giddiness, swimming in the head,
gout, periodical illness in females, &.c•.
Signs ofa short Disease.
When the cusp of the 6th, the ) , and the lords of the
1st and 6th, be in moveable signs, or the lord of the ascend-
ant swift in motion, or going out ofhis own house into an-
other, so that it be not the sign of the 6th or 12th, ot· if a
fortune be in the 6th, you may judge that the disease will
soon terminate.
Signs ofa long Disease.
The lord of the 6th evil or afBicted, and placed in the
6th, fixed signs on its cusp, or the significators, especially
the )\ , in fixed signs, are testimonies of a long and durable
disease: and if I, be lord of the 6th and in a fixed sign,
or retro12:rade and slow in motion, he extremely prolongs
the disease ; but if he be in a moveable sign, or in any of

his own terms, or be swift in motion, he is not then so
unfortunate.
General Signs.
The disease continues but a short time if )( be on the
cusp of the 6th. If the ) apply by ill aspect to the lord
of the ascendant, the disease will increase. If ) be in the
6th in ill aspect to ~ , the disease is brought on by intem-
perance, either evil diet or surfeit; and if ~ be in 1ft, there
is evidence of a scandalous disease. But if the patient be
a female, it may be the whites or other diseases of the
matrix.
The last degrees of any sign being on the cusp of the 6th,
denotes that the disease is almost at an end. If the lord of
the 6th apply by ill aspect to the lord of the ascendant,
it is a token of the disease increasing; the same, if the lord
of the 6th be in the 8th or 12th house. If the lord of the
ascendant be in the 6th, and the lord of the 6th in the
ascendant, the disea~:~e has been of long continuance, and
will continue until one of the significators leaves the sign
where he is. And if, at the time of transiting out ofthe
sign, he meet the evil aspects of the infortunes or lords of
the 4th or 8th, and they slow in motion, and it be from
signs evilly aspecting one another, it is a strong sign that
the sick person will then depart this life. The lord of the
6th affiicted by the 0 or 8 of the lord of the ascendant,
the disease is grievous and hard to cure. If the lord of the
6th be in the ascendant, the disease will continue, but the
pain at times is small. If he be in a cadent house, the dis-
ease is not important, nor will it endure. Good planets in the
6th promise a good end to the disease ; evil, the contrary.
The lord of the 6th affiicted in the 6th, 8th, or 12th; or an
infortune in the 6th, denotes a disease not easily curable.
The lord of the ascendant and ) free from ill aspects, both

12th, is a fair testimony of recovery and health. The lord
of the 1st in the 4th or 8th, if not afflicted, denotes not
death ; but if unfortunate, it shews great difficulty ere the
party be cured. If, however, he be unfortunate by retro-
gradation, being combust, &c., he may possibly be cured,
but will afterwards relapse. If he be in evil aspect with
)) , there is danger; but, above all, if J, be lord ofthe ascend-
ant, ar.d be slow or retrograde, there is reason to fear a
long and tedious sickness. If r, be strong and well quali-
fied, the reverse.
When the lord of the ascendant is angular, strong, and
unafBicted, the quercnt is in no danger. The )) slow in
motion and in any aspect with him, it prolongs the infir-
mity, though there be at present hopes of a cure. If she
be swift in motion when aspecting the lord of the ascend-
ant, the cure will be effected in a little time. The ]) de-
creasing in light, and coming to cS , 0, or 8 of J,, unless
the disease be already leaving the patient, is very danger-
ous. The ]) in cS with an oriental planet, who is swift in
motion and direct, denotes a brief sickness; if joined to a
retrograde and occidental planet, the contrary.
If nt ascend, the patient has been the cause of his own
sickness by folly, anger, peevishness, or the like; especi-
ally if ~ be therein. Both lights cadent and their dis-
positors unfortunate, the sickness will be severe; but if
the fortunes assist, though the disease will be of long con-
tinuance, the party will recover beyond all expectation :
the stronger the fortunes are, the more confident you may
be in your judgment. If ~ be lord of the ascendant and
in the 6th, but in good aspect to ~ , there is no danger; if
even in 0 or 8 , not much.
The lord of the 6th combust, retrograde, in his fall or
detriment, and in the 8th, in cS , o , or 8 of J, or ~ , you
may fear that the diseal'le will never leave the patient till

death. If the ) also be applying to the same aspects of
the lord of the 8th, your judgment will be certain. The )
or lord of the 1st, in cS , 0 , or 8 to a benevolent planet,
but he retrograde, the patient will recover, but not spee-
dily, for it denotes relapsing out of one disease into an-
other. When ]) leaves 8 of 0, and is swiftly applying to
the o or 8 of t, it threatens a fatal end to the disease;
but if she receive a * or ~ of 11. or i , the sick shall re-
cover. Ifthe ]) be in the ascendant, and in cS , 0, or 8
to T, or t , or any other evil planet, it is a token of severe
illness and danger, unless she be in mutual reception with
the planet afBicting.
Testimonies of Recove1'!J.
The ]) applying to a fortune, powerful, denotes that the
party will be restored to his former health. If reception
be between the lords of the ascendant and 8th by house or
triplicity, the fortunes assisting the degree ascending, or
that on the 6th, or the ]) by cS, *,or ~.the sick will
perfectly recover. The lord of the ascendant, being a bene-
fic planet, or any fortune in an angle and no ill aspects cast
thereto, signifies health. A certain sign of recovery is,
when 0, 11., i , or ) be in the ascendant, and no ways
afBicted by the lord of the 6th or 8th house ; the more so
if in the houses of the lights or benefics. The ]) in her
own house, or the houses of 11. or !j! , and in any aspect to
those benefics, and no way afBicted by Ja1 , T, , or t , de-
notes health and life. Whenever ) cS 11. occurs, it de-
notes recovery, but if in "'J', less than in any other sign.
If )) apply to the lord ofthe ascendant by good aspect, and
be unafBicted, (by the lord of the 8th or 6th especially),
recovery is promised.
When, at the first falling sick of the party, ]) is void of

course, and at her next crisis meets a *or t:.. of 11. or ~ in
the exact degree which forms the perfect critical aspect, the
patient will undoubtedly recover, be he never so ill at time
of asking the question. If at the commencement of a dis-
ease, 0, ]) , and the lord ofthe ascendant, are free from ill
aspects of the infortunes or lord of the 8th, there are
assured hopes of life.
Arguments cif Death.
The lord of the ascendant and ]) in cS with the lord of
the 8th, without interposing aspects offortunes.
The lord of the ascendant cadent, and the lord of the 8th
in an angle, especially if the latter be an infortune. The ))
applying to a planet in the 8th, and afBicted; and the lord
of the ascendant applying to the lord of the 8th or to evil
planets therein, are ve1-y dangerous. The ]) transferring the
light of the lord of the 8th to the lord of the ascendant,
usually denotes death. So when the lord of the 8th is in
the ascendant, the lord of the ascendant and )) both being

of the ascendant under the Earth, and in ill aspect to the
lord of the 8th in the 8th, or if the two lords be in cS in the

very evil. The lord of the 8th retrograde and conjoined

of the ascendant in ~t or ;:;: , and evilly affected by the
lords of the 6th or 12th, shews little hopes of recovery ;

Algol, or other violent fixed stars, is also evil. And if
both lights be afflicted by ~ in an angle, it is testimony
ofa tedious, long illness.
The ]) in the 4th with t , or the 0 with ~ ,are testi-
monies of death ; also the ]) near the cusp of the ascend-
ant in 0 of t from the 4th. The ]) combust in the 8th,
or if lady of the 6th and combust in the ascendant ot•
4th, the same ; and especially if the lord of the 8th be
afflicted.
The cS of ]) with 0 is a very ill sign, espec!ally when
she has not yet passed 0 ; however, when the cS is in CV'
or Q. '· it is not quite so evil •.
In all cases the multiplicity of testimonies must be ob-
served, the strength of the afflicting planets, and the
absence of assistance to neutralize the evil influence, before
you predict death.
To know whether the Querent be really ill or not.
If the ascendant be not afflicted, nor its lord out of all
his essential dignities, nor afflicted by ~ , t , or the lord
of the 6th, he is not. Or if no planet afflict the 6th house
by its presence, or the ]) be not afflicted in the 8th or
12th, or if you find ~, or ~ , or Q in the ascendant, or 0
in the 6th, or the ]) a'nd lord of the ascendant in good
aspect, or 11-· or ~ casting a * or A to the cusp of the
ascendant or 6th, the party is not really sick, but at the
utmost some slight indispollition has occurred, which will
shortly be rectified.
JY'hetl1er th(Disease be in the Body or Mind, o1· both.
If the ascendant, 0, and ]) be all afBicted, the disease
is then through the whole body; but if the planets which
• We should say, if it be in IZD, where ]) disposes of 0, it is not so
evil.

dispose of 0 and ]) , or if the lord of the ascendant, or
two of them, be-afBicted, the disease is more in the mind.
Ifthe ascendant, the ]) , and lord of the 0 are all, or two
of them, afflicted, and the lord of the ascendant and the
dispositor of the ]) free, the affection is in the mind and
not in the body.
If 'f) afBict the ]) , he shews trouble in the mind, vex-
ation and care ; but if ·1;1- be the planet afBicting the ]) ,
the contrary; for he never oppresses the mind, but always
the body.
If the lord of the house in which ]) is, and the lord of
the ascendant are afBicted by 0, or combust, or under the
beams of Q, the distemper is bodily. But if the ruler of
)) and the ruler of the lord of the ascendant be much
afflicted, the grief is more mental than bodily. Also if the
degree ascending and that degree where )) is be more
afflicted than the lords of those signs, the_disease is more
in the mind; but if the lords be more afBicteJ, the re-
verse.
When the dispositors of the lights are very much
afBicted and very weak, and the degree ascending have a
0 of ]) but no ill aspect of 'f) or t ' the person is much
tormented in mind. In these cases 0 causes the mind to
be troubled by pride, self-conceit, haughtiness, &c. ~ ar-
gues luxury, or a lasciviousness which disturbs both body
and mind. ~ shews foolish fancies and fearful imagi-
nations.
Of the Crises, or of Critical Days.
lf the disease be not chronic, you will find great alter- ·
ation in the patient near those times when )) arrives at a
distance from her first place, when the patient was taken
ill, of .45, 90, or 135 degrees. To learn whether these
crises will be good or evil, see how she is aspeeted at those

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 167
times. If she be in good aspect with a benevolent planet,
it promises ease and an improved condition ; but if she
there meet with evil aspects of malevolent planets or the
lords of the 6th or 8th, he will be worse, nod the medicines
do little good. I have always observed that, when the ])
came at the crises to cS , o, or 8 of that planet which did
afilict the ascendant, ]) , or lord of the ascendant, or when
she came to such aspect of the lord of the 6th or planets
placed in the 6th, the patient suffered much, the disease
ran high, and medicines given about that time worked
little or no good. When she came, however, to * or t::.
of the lords of the ascendant, 9th, lOth, or lith houses, I
observed some interval of ease or amendment. So when
the lord of the ascendant came to any good aspect of the
Q, (if he had not power or dominion in the disease), I
found the patient's mind much relieved.
How lo11g it may be before Recovery.
When there is reason to believe that, by God's blessing,
the sick person shall recover, and it be desired to know
when, observe which planet is lord of the ascendant, and
what benevolent planet he is in aspect with; then see
what house they are in, (that is the one which applies to
the other's aspect), whether angles, &c., and what signs
they possess, whether moveable, &c. Then according to
discretion and quality of the disease, so frame the measure
of time. In general, I judge in so many days as the aspect
wants degrees of being perfect, if the sign be moveable
and the planet angular ; but if swift in motion, I am the
more certain that the patient will begin to amend in so
many days. If the sign be common, in which the appli-
cation is, I neither judge days, weeks, nor months, but use
discretion, having first observed the nature of the disease.

It is well to observe, also, the quick or slow motion of
the D, the sign she is in, and her situation aa to angles, &c.
I often find that when the lord of the ascendant quits the
sign he is in, and enters a sign in which he has dignities,
the patient recovers at that time, or feels an alteration for
the better. If a common sign be on the 6th, 280 or more,
I say, that the disease will vary in two weeks.

the body inflated, lungs oppressed, ulcerated, &c. If the

within 14 days.
Tlte ]) in n in cS ~ , ~c.-The disease has its origin
in the mind, by too much care, or a multiplicity of busi-
ness, or otherwise by fatigue in travelling or over exercise.
There is danger of a small fever; the pain is dispersed over
all the body, but chiefly in the joints. The vitals are
afBicted, the pulse rare, and weak; there are frequent per-
spirations, symptoms of spleen and consumption. If 3 also
afBict, without assistance, the patient will hardly live 10
days; but if 'lf. or ~ assist, the sick person may recover
after a long period.

lord of the ascendant has just separated from a 0 of T,,
being at that time in m;, which signifies and rules over the
breast and stomach. From all these testimonies I con-
cluded that the parts of the body grieved were the head,
breast, heart, and stomach ; and that there was lodged in
the breast or stomach some obstruction, which caused all
his disease and suffering.
From what Cause the Sickness was.
The principal significator being }] , and he in his own
terms, and D disposed of by him and applying to him,
shewed such diseases as he causes, and which might exist
in the head and breast. 3 , lord of the ascendant, was
also in the terms of T,, and applied to 0 of 0, who was
in the terms of 3. So that dry, melancholy diseases were
shewn by T,, and heat or fever by 3. And, indeed, when
I came to speak to him, he was suffering great pain and
rumbling in his head, was very silent, dull, and melancholy;
he slept very little, had a very dry cough, and complained
of great weakness and pain in his breast and at his heart.
His complexion was between black and yellow, as if in-
clined to jaundice; and he had also a lingering consump-
tion and great weariness all over him, with pains in his
joints, shewn by }) in an airy sign. The ascendant is 1T(.,
which signifies the secrets, stone in the bladder, &c.; so the
}) in ::: shews the secrets and diseases therein, &c. Hence
he had great difficulty in making water, voided red gravel,
and suffered great pain in those parts.
Whetlter the Disease would be curable or not?
The author of the disease being T,, shewed it would be
ofsome continuance, for he is a slow ponderous planet; be-
sides, the angles of the figure are all fixed, and the lord of
the ascendant, 0, and }) , are all in fixed signs. The lights

sign : all these shewed a long disease. The ]) being in the

who has dignities in the 6th, and the lord of the 4th in the

strong for his death : he died the 14th Augvstfollowing.

we must learn the cause and nature of the disease, and part
afflicted. A fixed sign ::: is on the 6th, affiicted by ts ,and
T, , lord of the 6th, is in ~ , an earthy sign, of the same
nature as 11)t, the ascendant. The b , a general signifi-
cator in all diseases, is also in 1IJt in cS with 3 • All these
shewed the patient to be greatly affiicted with the spleen,
cholic, and obstructions in his bowels, small fever, flatu
lence, and a failing weak pulse. And as the » and 8 are
in the ascendant, the patient was perplexed with distem
pers in the head, slept unquietly, &c. (All wllick was
true.)
Will the Patient live or die?
All the significators·promised death.
1st. 0, light of time, was in close o to .'fJ , lord of the 6th,
in fixed signs.
2d. The ascendant was extremely affiicted by presence of
8 ' he being lord' of nearly all the 8th house.
3d. · The }) was affiicted by 8 in the house of life.
4th. The }) separated from the * of 11! , lord of the ascend-
ant, in signs of long ascension, and did transfer his
light to 'lf., lord of the 4th and 8th houses, denoting
death and the grave.
N.B. The patient died the 28th ofthe month, when 11! came
to the 0 of 'fJ and cS of 0 in the figure. The }) came
then to 8 0, and had transited the cusp of the 6th house

CHAPTER XXX.
THE SEVENTH HOUSE, AND ITS QUESTIONS.
. This House signifies Marriage, Love Questions, Lawsuits
and Controversies, Contracts, Wars, Duels, open ·Ene-
mies, Bargains, Thej~s, Fugitives, andall matters regard-
ing Strangers.
THE questions to be judged by this house being more
difficult than those of any other bouse, I have been more
lengthy in delivering the opinions of the ancients as well
as moderns thereon; and have written several aphorisms
concerning its questions.
APHORISMS AND CONSIDERATIONS
FOR THE BETTER JUDGING ANY HORARY QUESTION, ESPECIALLY
THOSE OF THE 7th HOUSE.
1. See the question be radical and fit to bejudged.
2. Be not confident of the judgment if either the first or
• This table is taken from the old Arab writers on astrology, who
flourished many centuries back : they used many terms inconsistent
with the modern nomenclature of diseases; but as the human frame
is s'ill the same, so are its diseases, though called by different names.

last degrees of a sign ~nd. If few degrees
ascend, the matter is not yet ripe for judgment: if
the latter degrees, the matter of the question is
elapsed, or the querent bas been tampering with
other artists, or despairs of success. Meddle got
with it at that time.
3. If 1i , 3 , or 5 be in the lOth house unfortunate, it will
end in the discredit of the artist. ·
4. Judge not upon every trivial motion or light question,
or when the querent bas not wit to know what be
would demand.
5. Observe well the strength and condition of l>; for it is
far better that the lord of the ascendant be. unfor-
tunate than the ]),
6. The evil planets shew tardiness and difficulty in every
question, unless l> and they receive each other in the
signification.
7. The benefics, 1f. and ~ , never import evil but when
ruling evil houses; and if they be significators with-
out reception, even then they putforward the matter.
8. If l> be void of course, there is no great hope of the
question, unless she be in £ZJ, ij , t, or )(.
9. Observe from what planet l> last separated; for it will
shew what has already happened: if from a fortune, _
good ; but from a malefic, evil ; according to the na-
ture of the house the planet rules and is in.
10. The application of l> shews the present condition of
the matter, and what may be expected. If l> apply
to a planet in his fall, it denotes trouble and delays.
11. If evil planets promise good, it will be imperfect or less
than is expected, and come with much effort; and
if they foreshew evil, it will be greater than may be
feared.
12. If malefics threaten evil, observe whether 0, l{., or ~

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROI.OGY. 187
cast any good aspect to them, for -then the evil will
be mitigated.
13. If the fortunes promise good, but are weak, or behold
not the ascendant, they perform but little without
reception.
14. A planet peregrine, viz. having no essential dignities at
all, is very malicious.
15. Confide not too much in a fortune unless be be in his
essential dignities.
16. In a figure where both fortunes and infortunes are
equally weak and ill placed, venture not a judg-
ment, but defer the party for another time.
17. In all questions where the significator of the thing is
combust, or in 8 to0, he can bring nothing to perfec-
tion.
18. If one infortune be joined to another, the good they
promise will come to nothing; but the evil they
threaten will be more violent.
19. The lord of the ascendant out of his dignities, cadent,
&.c. shews thequerent out of all hopes in the business.
20. A planet under the beams of 0, (viz. within 12 de-
grees), bas no fortitude •; if withi~ 1ixteen minutes
of 0, he is in cazimi or heart of 0 and then he is
very strong.
21. If the dispositor ofthe significator be oriental, and he
either 'f1 , 11-, or 8 , the matter is sooner performed;
but if ¥ or ~ , later: the reverse, if they be occi-
delltal.
2"2. If the significator of the thing desired be in a fixed
sign, it denotes stability, and that the thing shall
continue, whether it be begun OJ' is to be begun; if
• We should judge that, if the planet dispose of 0 by house, this
rule does not hold. We have no faith in the doctrine of Cazimi.

he be in common signs, it shews the probability of
the matter, but not its conclusion ; and if in move-
able signs, a sudden resolution or concluding the
matter one way or ·other. Hence we. begin the
foundations of buildings when the significators are
fixed; short journeys when moveable; but things
wherein a mediocrity is desirable, when they are in
moveable signs.
23. The l> or lord of the ascendant, with e9, brings damage,
according to the house they are in. The Q is in
like manner beneficial.
24. If in any question you find l> afflicted, there is seldom
any good comes of the matter.
25. If l> or lord of the ascendant'be in their fall, the que-
rent despairs of the matter, nor does he much care
whether it be performed or not.
26. Consider diligently the planet afBicting the significator
of the thing demanded, and what house he is lord ·
of, and where placed ; from .the nature of those
houses require the cause obstructing.
Zi. The most powerful afBiction to the~ is when she is
combust, and if she applies to 0 it is the worst.
28. If an infortune aspect your significator, and they be
both peregrine or retrograde, you may judge that
· the mischief threatened is almost inevitable.
29. Take especial notice whether any frustration or prohi-
bition ,be before the perfect aspect of the signifi-
cators: the planet which frustrates hinders the thing
demanded.
30. In all questions of gain, look well to E9 : the querent
will get by persons or things connected with the
bouse it is in ; but if it be afBicted, he loses in the
same way.

.
31. In questions of marriage, an evil planet in the 7th
shews ill agreement in the married state.
32. If the l01·d of the 8th be unfortunate in the 8th, the
querent will suffer by the death of some female ;
or, concerning debts due to him, by 4ead men.
33. In what house you find 1f. or ~ well dignified, expect
benefits by men or things signified by that house :
as if in the 3d, by kindred ; in the 4th, by your
father or lands, &c.; in the 5th, by play, pleasure,
&c. ; and so of the others. And beware of slander
or damage through that house where ~ falls.
QUESTIONS CONCERNING MARRIAGE.
WhetIter a Man shall Marry 'I
If a man ask this question, let the lord of the as~endant,
}), and i , also planets in the ascendant, be his significators.
Then if}) aspect favourably 0, i, or lord of the 7th, or
the lord of the let aspect the lord of the 7th, Ol' be in the
7th, or the lord of the 7th be in the ascendant, or if most
of these significators be in fruitful signs, or disposed of by
~ , the man·shall marry.
Wlttlher a Woman shall Marry.~
Follow the same rules as above, but, instead of}) and i ,
substitute 0 and 3>. If ~- have no aspect or familiarity
with 0, it is a strong testimony of the negative.
The Time of Marriage.
The degree of the application of }) to 0 or ~ , or of (!)
to ~ , or the lords of the let and 7th to good aspect, or to
0 or 8, if with strong mutual reception, or of the lord of
the ascendant to the cusp of the ascendant, or the lord
of the 7th to the cusp of the ascendant, must be noticed.
And if the significators be swift, and the testimonies of
marriage strong and numerous, moveable signs give days,

weeks, or months, as the applying planet be angular, IIUC-
cedent, or cadent; and common signs, in like way, give
weeks, months, or years; and fixed signs give, in like man-
ner, months or years.
Of Marriage with any particular Person who may he
desired.
If the lord of the ascendant or]) (or if the querent be a
woman, the 0) be joined to the lord ofthe 7th in any of his
dignities in the ascendant, lOth, or 11th, the querent shall
obtain the party desired.
If both signific~tors behold each other by ,jc or a out
of the ascendant and Lith, or out of t.he 7th and 9th, or
7th and 5th, and no frustration or retrogradation of the
chief significators happen before the good aspect be com-
pleted, the match wilf be perfected, if the querent please.
For we always suppose a FREEDOM oF WILL to do or not
to do. And if there be a o or 8 between the significators,
without reception, the matter will come to nothing.
A o aspect with reception will perfect the matter, but
with some difficulty. If no reception be, there may be
hopes, but no grounds to judge favourably.
When the lord of the ascendant is in the 7th, the que-
rent loves best; and when the lord of the 7th is in the
ascendant, the quesited loves best.
The match may be brought about, though there be no
aspect between the significators, if there be any good trans-
lation of light; more especially if the planet who tran"lates
·be a fortune, ot·.be not retrograde, combust, or unfortunate,
or atBicted by J, or ~. . The .person signified may be
known by the description of the planet, according to the
sign he is in, and the way he is aspected ; and the quality
of the person, from the house he is lord of. A .lnasculine
diurnal planet shews a man, and a feminine nocturnaL
planet a female, or an effeminate man, and vice versa.

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 191
Testimonies that the Marriage shall be hiudered.
Observe the planet who receives the light of the signi-
ficators. If he be a heavy planet, and have the 0 or 8
of a malefic, or be cadent, the intended match shall be
broken off, though at present never so feasible.
Remark which party's significator is strongest; that
party shall first marry after this dissolution.
If the significators apply by an evil aspect without re-
ception, or if there be no good aspect between the lumi-
naries, there will be no marriage ; unless the lords of the
ascendant and 7th be placed in each other's houses, and
the other signs be very decided for the match.
If the evil f? be in the ascendant, he renders the querent
cool, and but little inclined to marriage ; unless he be very
strong or well aspected. Jf he be in the 7th, he has the
same effect on the quesited. He is generally an enemy to
marriage, whereas i assists marriage, and inclines the par-
ties thereto.
What shall be the Cause of the Marriage being prevented?
Consider the evil planet who intercepts his rays between
the significators, and hinders the marriage ; and observe
what house he is lord of, and where he is situated. If he
be lord of the 2d, want of money will be objected to the
querent, or he may fear to marry from lack of means.
The lord of the 3d denotes that it will be caused by the
querent's kindred or neighbours, or by means of some short
joumey.
The lord of the 4th shews that his father will not agree,
or it may (especially if a feminine planet) be the mother of
the quesited ; or it may be for want of some settlement of
houses or lands, &.c.
The lord of the 5th causes obstacles by means of child-
ren, or by the querent having a character for loose living, &c.
Digitized by Google
19-2 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
The 6th denotes sickness in the querent, or opposition by
some relation of his father, or by means of servants, or some
, private enemy of the quesited•
.The lord of the 7th, or a planet therein, denotes a public
enemy of the querent, or a lawsuit, or a rival.
- The 8th denotes a lack of money on the part of the que-
sited; or, if other testimonies concur, it may be that the
querent's death may intervene to prevent the match.
The 9th, in like manner, shews opposition by the relations
of the quesited, or the interference of some lawyer or priest,
or that the querent may go a long journey or voyage, and
so the match be hindered.
The lOth and its lord shew the father of the quesited, or
the mother of the querent, or some person having authority
over the querent.
Jf it be the lith house or its lord, t.ben the friends of
both parties dislike the match ; or those who first intro-
duced the parties, or endeavoured to bring it about, will now
try to dissolve the connexion.
If it be by the lord of the 12th, or by a planet therein,
there is some under-hand dealing or secret enmity to the
querent. The affair shall be much retarded; but the que-
rent shall never know by whom; or some private scandal
will do much wrong, and quite break off the matter.
In. the same manner that you may thus learn who will
oppose the querent, you may ascertain who will assist him in
his desires. And by varying the houses, you may know the
persons who will aid or hinder the quesited.
To describe the Person and Qualities ofthe future Wife or
Husband.
For the man, observe the planet the ')) is nearest in
aspect with and applying; as if with ~ , say she i11 fair,
slender, and pleasant. And according as that planet is
Digitized by Google
.JNTRODUCTION TO ASl'ROI.OGY. 193
found in any of the 12 signs, describe her person; and as it
is aspected and dignified, her qualities-; observing also the
sign on the 7th house. And if there be any planets in the
7th, take that planet nearest the cusp; unless J) aspect a
planet there, then take that planet. For a woman, judge
by the planet 0 applies to, in like manner; as if 0 be in
* or a to f7, he is grave and laborious; if 1J., honest; if
t , violent; if ~ , fond of pleasure and agreeable; if ~ ,
active and industrious; and if I.!J , strange and eccentric.
If 0 and J) are applying to 0 or 8 , there will be conten-
tion and discord. ·
Whether thefuture Wife or Husband shall be rich. or not 'I
Observe the lord of the 8th and planets therein. If J)
apply by good aspect to the lord of the 8th, or good planets
be there, or the lord of the 8th have a good aspect to the
querent's e' or other significators of property, the future
wife or husband will be rich. If evil planets be in the 8th,
or its lord afilict the J) or$, the querent will gain little by
marriage. And if f7 and t be both in the 8th, he gains
nothing; and though the party may have property, the que-
rent will be cheated of it, or lose it in some manner, The
persons or means by which the property will be injured,
may be discovered by observing what houses the afflicting
planets are lords of for the persons, and what houses they
are placed in for the means ; as ~ , lord of the 8th, being
in the 9th, and throwing a 0 to e' might denote a law-
suit respecting the future wife or husband's property.
Whether the Marriage be legitimate or not?
If'the significators of either party be affiicted by ~ or
t , or joined to ~, it denotes some dispute about the mar-
riage; and if other testimonies agree, a lawsuit may be the
consequence.

How the Parties shall agree after !ffarriage?
If the figure promise marriage, observe whether the lords
of the ascendant and 7th are in good aspect; or if the }) be-
hold with good aspect the planet disposing of her by house
or exaltation, and the luminaries be in good aspect, they
will agree.
· If the lords of the ascendant and 7th be in 0 or 8 , or
the }) be affticted, and behold the ascendant by ill aspect,
or J, , ~ , or ~, be in the ascendant, or 7th, they will
live unhappily. If the ill planets, or ~, be in the
1st, the querent is to blame; and if it be ~, is given to
quarrel, or be loose in conduct, according to the sign;
and if they be in the 7th, it is the quesited. And judge
the same way according as the significator of the 1st or
7th be afHicted. The )) in her fall, or 0 or 8 of 'f1 or
~ , or any retrograde planet, and at the same time throwing
any aspect to the ascendant, it is the man who brings on
disputes, &c. If the 0 do the same, under the same
circumstances, it is the woman.
The lord of the. 7th angular, and the more weighty
planet, the quesited will strive for mastery ; and if neither
the lord of the ascendant nor 7th be in angles, then note
the weightier planet, for he points out the party who will
rule. If ~ be atBicted, it is worse for the man; and if
0, for the woman. The l> atBicted, is evil for both.
The lights in evil aspect shew discord.
Tl~.e Cause of Co11tentio1l.
If the atBicting planet be lord of the 3d, and be in the
1st or 7th, he denotes quarrels, or injuries by neighbours
or kindred. If it be an irifortune who afHicts, and he be
in the lOth, it shews continual brawls. If he be in the
4th, a divorce or willingness thereto ; or some hinderance
in the dowry or fortune of the female. Evil planets in the
lOth or 4th lead also to contention by means of the parents
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 195
of the parties. If }) behold the ascendant, and be unfor-
tunate, it denotes brawling, separation, or dishonest living.
And if there be no application between the planet the ])
separates from and that one to which she applies, there
will be continual contention. If l> aspect evilly, or be in tS
with f7 or I, one of them shall die shortly, or have some
misfortune; if in the 8th or 12th, (and she void of course),
they meet troubles, grief and sickness; and if in angles,
long disagreements ; and probably separation if in a fixed
sign. If this be in the lOth, and a masculine sign, the man
is the chief sufferer ; if in the 4th, and a feminine sign, the
woman.
'l'he Cause of Happiness.
The l> in *or t:. of good planets, shews gifts or bene-
fits by friends; if in 0, by the dead. If J) be in tS with
good planets, by their own conduct or industry.
Arabic Aphorisms not to he trusted to, unless other Testi-
monies concur.
The woman who departs from or loses her husband
when l> is in the last 130 of t, shall never return or
marry.
The man who shall engage to marry when ) is in the
first 120 of J;>, shall lose his betrothed before maniage, or
die within six months, or live in discord with her.
From 1ohat Part a Person shall Marr!J?
If the lord of the 7th be in the 9th, the querent shall
marry a stranger. H the lords of the 1st and 7th be in
one quarter of heaven, or in one house or sign, the person
will marry one near to their own residence. Consider the
sign of the 7th, the sign and quarter of heaven the lord of

If the lord of the ascendant be angular, and the lord of
the 7th succeedent, the querent is best counected ; and
vice versa. In like manner you may judge of any two
individuals. A more assured way is, by observing which
of the two significators is the most powerful in dignities.
You may combine the two systems.
Whether a Lady have a Lover besides the Quermt?
If there be any planet in the 7th, (if it be not lord of
the 7th), she has one of the description of that planet. The
lord of 7th, or 0 joined to 3 , she has a lover with whom
she is familiar; but, (unless other and very evil testimonies
accord), not improperly. The lord of the 7th void of course,
or with Q, or if no planet be in the 7th, judge that she
has none : and if the lord of the 7th aspect only the lord
of the ascendant, judge the same.
If either the lord of the 7th, or the 0 be joined to the lord
of the triplicity then ascending, and 0 separate from the
lord of the ascendant, it seems that she has some friend
that she loves besides the querent.
The lord of the 7th, or the 0. or both, separating from
any other planet but the lord of the ascendant, and he not
separated above three degrees, the lady did love another,
but she has now left him. If the lord of the 7th be with
Q , she is blameless ; unless there be another planet in cS
with them, and then she is not. And if it be ~ '· she is
faulty in her desires and affections; and if evil testimo-
nies concur, such as aspects of 3 , or the cS be in l11., it
may be feared in acts also.
If the 0. ot· lord of the 7th, be in cS with 3 , and Q

INTRODUCTION TO .ASTROLOGY. 197
be there, she loves a martial man, yet he cannot prevail on
her entirely. If~ be there, she is sore pressed to comply.
If they be near, or within very few degrees, the gentleman
resides near her house ; and if in the same degree, he is in
the house, if it be a fixed sign ; or frequently visits the
bouse, if it be a moveable or common sign.
If 0. or lord of the 7th, separate from I, she had for-
merly a lover, but now they have forsaken each other. If 0
be lord of the 7th, and be in cS with I or 'lf. in any sign
whatever, the lady has loved or does love a person described
by 1 or 'lf. ; and he has rank as an officer, gentleman, or
clergyman. And if there be mutual reception, they still
Jove one another, and many acts of kindness pass between
them.
If the 0 or lord of the 7th be joined to ~ , the lover is
a young clerk or merchant; lawyer or writer; a witty, nim-
ble fellow. His age may be judged by the number of de-
grees ~ is in the sign.
If the lord of the 7th be joined to ~ with reception, (and
it be a female who is inquired of), then she cares little for
the men; but is fond of female society, is rather free in her
language, but not naturally vicious. If it be a male who is
the quesited, he is found much in female company, and is
partial to such an one as ~ may describe, according to the
sign she is in. If the aspect be * or t::.. and with mutual
reception, the lady is partial to him; but if the )) or lord
of the 7th dispose not of~ , she cares not for him, unless the
aspect be.very close and in angles. And if the aspect be
evil, there is no mutual regard, without there be very strong
reception.
The lord of the 7th joined to f?, she loves, (or did love
if they separate), an elderly person, or farmer, &.c.
The lord of the 7th joined to 0, she loves some person
of consequence, according to her rank in life ; and if

with mutual reception, he may do w~at he please with her.
If they separate, or there be no reception, the feeling is
passed away or was never mutual.
If other planets aspect 0 and the lord of the 7th, espe-
cially 'f1 or ~, she has other admirers, &c.
If the lord of the 7th aspect ]) , or the »be in the 7th,
especially if they be then in aspect, or ~ be in aspect with
~,she is given to change and acts discreditably, yielding
up her affections upon slight solicitation.
Generally, you may consider that if ~ be in the 7th,
unless he be in his own house, the lady has a lover. If 'f1,
she loves one, but there is no familiarity between them; if
'lf. be there, she is honest; if ~ , she is giddy and merry,
and is thought to be wanton, but is not; if ~, she bad a
friend, but has not now; and if l>, she has not yet, but
will have more than one. If 0 or Q be there, she is vir-
tuous and honourable, and has no lover other than the que-
rent. e3 denotes discreditable desires at least.
Whether a Gentlemau have a Lnver besides the Querent '?
You may judge this question exactly by the rules for
judging of a lady, ifyou substitute the }) for the 0 and ~
for ~. You may in like way judge of friends by taking
the 11th for the 7th.
Whether a Damsel be virtuous or not '?
Behold the lord of the 7th, the cusp of the 7th, and the
0; and if they be in fixed signs and well aspected, you
may judge that she is correct. If ~ be in n and nt de-
scend, she is suspected, but yet is honest. If nt descend
and ~ the1·ein, it is suspicious; and if there be a moveable
sign on the 7th, or the 0 and ~ be in common or move-
able signs, and be ill asp~cted ; and if ~ and ~ be in ill
aspect, or the 0 or l> behold ~ , and the evil stars aspect
them from fixed signs, there is great reason to doubt. Yet

INTRODUC'flO.N TO ASTROLOGY. 199
if there be any good aapect to either the 7th or its lord, ~ ,
or 0, it is not safe to judge the lady to be unchaste,
though she may have been much tempted. The student
will do well to avoid a positive judgment unfavourable on
this head, unless all the testimonies are decided.
If there be great reason to doubt, then observe whether
]) be in the last face of n, or in a moveable sign, and in
the 5th house, and the lord of the 5th in the ascendant or
7th, and in a moveable sign, and either of them in aspect
to ~ ; or the lords of the 5th and 7th in cS in one sign. If
all these, or nearly all, concur, you may be more confident
that the lady is faulty.
Whether tile Chiltj conceived is the Child of him who ia the
reputed Father'?
Obsel've the lord of the ascendant, and the ]) , who sig-
nify the querent; then observe the sign of the 11th, and
its lord, which signify the issue in conception. If these
significators behold one another by* or 6., with reception
or not, the conception is legitimate, viz. the child of its
supposed father. If they aspect each other by 0 or 8
with reception, and perfect aspect; or the lord of the as-
cendant or ]) be in the 5th, or the lord of the 5th in the
ascendant, without the evil aspect of the infortunes, or if
one of the fortunes behold the cusp of the 5th or its lord,
then also is the child begotten by its reputed father. But if
none of these things be, and ~, ~ , or ~ , behold the 5th or
lord thereof, there may be just suspicion that the child is
conceived in adultery, or is not the child of the querent.

200 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
If the woman herself propose the question, consider the
lord of the 7th, (for the 7th is ever given to the banished or
expelled party); and if the lord of the 7th behold the as-
cendant with a perfect aspect, and the lord of the ascend-
ant behol~ the 7th, or its lord, without doubt she shall
again come into favour. If the lord of the 7th do not
behold the ascendant, but another planet, who is not af-
flicted, behold the ascendant, the woman shall be received
again through some person who shall interpose his friendship
with the husband 6r friend. If none of these things be,
observe ) and 8 ; and if ]) be above the earth, and 1
behold the ascendant with *or ~, she shall return quietly,
and without much trouble.
If ]) be under the earth and 8 above, and behold the
ascendant with * or b., she shall·retum, but with trouble
and delays, and with much publicity. If ) aspect the
ascendant favourably, and be not atBicted, she shall return,
but with solicitation. If ~ decrease in light, but be not
near the beams of 0, and behold the ascendant, she will
return easily and speedily.
If 8 be retrograde, and hasten to aspect with ]) , she
will of her own accord return ; but if 8 and ) , or the lorda
of the 1st and 7th, separate from good aspect, they have
no mutual desire to return, nor will the lady much respect
the gentleman for the future.
OF RUNAWAY SERVANTS, CATTLE STRAYED, AND
THINGS LOST.
The significatur of the thing missing is the ]) ; where-
fore if you find ]) applying to the lord of the ascendant, or
to the lord of the 12th, (being herself in the ascendant),
or to the lord of the house of the )) , the thing missing
shall be found again. But if ) apply to none of these,
nor be in the ascendant or 2d, the thing lost shall not be

found •. If the lord of the house of ]) be in the 3d, or in
* to the ascendant, there is some hope of finding the
thing again during that aspect with the degree ascend-
ing. Also, if he separate from the lord of the 6th, 8th, or
l:.!th, and apply by any aspect to the cusp of the 2d, or
behold the ]) , you may hope to find it. But if there be
contrary indications between these, judge the reverse.
1f the J) be aspected well by both fortunes, the thing
lost is in the hands of some trusty person ; and if ]) or
one of the fortunes behold th-e ascendant, he will restore it
to the owner.
The Place where the Thing lost is.
This is shewn by J) , according to the sign she is in ; for if
the sign be eastern, it is east; and if west, it is western, &c.
Observe also the place of J> in the figure; for ifshe be in the
ascendant, it is east, &c., but prefer the sign. If the lord of
the house of J) be in human signs, ( n, 19t, :::,or the first
half of t ), it is in a place where men frequent. If in signs
of small cattle, as 'Y' or ~, it is where they are found. If
]) be in a fiery sign, it is where fire i'! ; if in a watery
sign, where water is, &c. If ]) be in the same quartea· as
the lord of the ascendant, and there be not more tha~ 3C)O
between them, the thing lost is in the house of the owner,
or about it; if they be above 300 and less than 700 apart,
it is in the town where he resides; but if they be not in
one quarter, it is far from the owner.
How the Thing was lost.
Observe from what planet the lord of the ascendant last
separated. If from. 'f1, it was through forgetfulness of the
owner; or through cold or illness which afflicted the loser,
especially if 'f1 be retrograde. If from 11-, it was through

some abstinence, or ordering of laws, or by excess of care
in managing affairs, orputting too much trust in the person
by whom it was carried away or mislaid. If from ~ , or
the lord of the ascendant be in the house of ~ , it was lost
through fear or some sudden passion, provoking the loser
to anger; or by fire, or by enmity, or upon some quarrel.
If from e, by means of the king or some gentleman, or
the master ofthe family, or by hunting or pastime. If from
~, or in her house, by drinking, cards, &c., or making
merry in a tav~m, &c., or by singing or dallying with
women. If from ~ , by writing, letters, messages or going
a message, &c. If from l>, by too frequent use, or shew-
ing the thing lost, or' making it too common ; or some
messenger, widow, or servant lost the same.
If it be an A11imal, and .1JOU would know whether it be
stolen or not ?
If you find the lord of the house of l> separating from
any planet, say that it went away of its own accord. If
that lord be not separating, but another planet be separating
from him, say that some person took it away. If the lord
of the house of ]) be in neither of these cases, look to the
lord of the 2d house, and judge by him in the same way.
And if you find no sepat'8.tion of either of these two lords,
say that the animal is still in or near its place, and is not
gone away.
Whether it be dead?
Observe the ]) ; and if you find her in application to the
lord of the 8th house from her, say it is dead. But if you
find no such testimony, observe her dispositor; and if you
find him applying to the lord of the 8th house from the
Moon, say likewise that it is dead, or will shortly die; but
if in neither of these you find application, take the lord of

J> nor her dispositor apply to it, then the animal is not
dead.
Whether ·the Thing missing be stolen ?

in the ascendant, or disposing of the D, or J> disposing of
him, or the lord of the ascendant be disposed of by him or

1st or 2d, or Ea, or its lord by cS, o, or 8, or some planet
be in the ascendant, and be in ::::1 or 8 to the significator
of the thief, the thing is not stole·n. Generally any ill
aspect of any evil planet, or the lord of the 7th to the ascend-
ant or 2d house or their lords, or D or E&, or their lords,
denote that the thing is stolen.
Whether a Thing lost shall befound'!
Jf D apply to the lords of the ascendant or 2d, or to

sitor of l> separating from the lord of the 6th, 8th or 12th,

mony of his return.
OF THEFfS.
The ascendant is for the querent, and its lord for him
that has lost the goods ; and it signifies the place from
whence they were taken.
The 7th house and its lord, or the peregrine planet in.an
angle, signify the thief.
The 2d house, its lord, and the l'J , signify the things
lost or stolen; and the 4th house, and its lord, shew the
place where they are ·conveyed to, and then are.
The aspects of 0 and l'J , the lords of the 1st and 2d,
and the dispositor of the )) , by application to each other,
shall shew whether they will be had again or not.
If the lord of the 2d and the l'J be in the 7th, aml the
lord of the 7th behold them both by *or A, (though the
aspect be several degrees distant), then are the goods taken
away by some one, and not merely lost.
If ]) be lady of the 2d, and going to cS of the lord of
the 7th, then has the party mislain it; and the thing is
neither lost nor stolen. ·
If ]) be Jady of the ascendant, and in the 4th, and the-
lol'd of the 2d be in the 7th or 8th in * or A of !J , the
thing is not stolen, but taken away in jest.
If l'J be lady of the ascendant, and be in it, and 0 lord
of 2d in the lOth, with the lord of the 7th, and the lord of
the 7th 0 l'J, then are the goods stolen and taken away.
If l'J be in the 3d, and in 0 to the lord of the 7th, and
the lord of the 2d be in the 7th, it was first taken in jest,
but is now stolen, and will be hard to recover, unless 0
and ) aspect the ascendant.
If l'J be lady of the 5th, and in J;>, and i lady of the
2d in the lOth, and ]) in 8 to the lord of the 7th, then
has the party lost the goods as he went by the way, or left

them in some place. If ]) be in !ZZi in the 8th, and the
lord of the 2d in the 5th, and neither of them behold the
lord of the 7th, and he be in the 7th, the goods are taken
away in jest by the master of the house, and he will deny
it. If ]) be in the 4th in 8 to its lord, and the lord of the
2d in the 12th in * to the lord of the 7th, then has some-
body taken away the things in jest. If ) be in the house
of the lord of the 7th, and be in the 12th, not beholding
the lord of the 7th, and the lord of the 2d be in the 6th,
then are the goods removed in jest; and if, in this case, the
lord of the 2d did last separate from the ruler of the J>,
they will scarcely be had again. If the J> separate from the
lord of the 2d by 0, they are taken away and stolen; and
· the same, ifthe }) , being lady of the 2d, separate from the
lord of the house wherein she is.
If the lord of the ascendant separate from '1#., (he not
being lord of the 7th, or peregrine in an angle), or from the
lord of the 2d, the querent has lain it down and forgotten it,
and so it was lost: but, when both the lords of the 1st and
2d separate from 1f., this is surer. If(in such case) the lord
ofthe 2d, or'll., separate from the lord of the ascendant, then
did the partylose the goods by the way as he went,or in some
place where he was, or they fell out of his pocket acci-
dentally, and they are neither found nor stolen. But if
there be none of these separations, see if the peregrine
planet, or lord of the 7th apply to 1f., or the lord of the 2d ;
then, if they.do, the goods are absolutely stolen. Ifthe
lord of the 2d, or 1f., apply to the significator of the thief,
he came easily by them, and did not come with intent to
steal; but, seeing the thing unprotected, he was tempted to
steal.
If the significator of the thief aspect the lord of the lst
or 2d, or the cusp of the 2d, or EB, or ) , or theirdispositor,
or the planet in whose term ) is, or if he be in the ascend-

208 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROI.OGY.
ant, it is stolen ; but, if there be no evil aspect to any of
thest-, it is not stolen.
Of the Age ofthe Thief.
Guido Bonatus says, that if the thiers significator be
V, he is very young; if i, rather older, but yet a young
female ; ~ shews him of full age; 1l- of middle age, and
11, elderly. If the 0 be his significator, and be between .
the ascendant and lOth, he is young, and so increasing in
age until he come to the angle of the earth. If the ])
shew the thief, his age will correspond to her age: and in
all cases judge also by the position the thiers significator·
has reached in the sign where he is found. If he be just
entered the sign, quite young; if in the middle of the
sign, of middle age; and if towards the end of the sign,
elderly: and if 11 aspect him any way, it adds to his age.
Oriental planets denote also younger persons, and occi-
dental planets elderly persons. You must consider all the
testimonies before you judge the thiers age.
Whether the Thief be Male or Female?
The significator of the thief being masculine, and in a
masculine sign, and the ) in a masculine sign, it is a male;
et e contra. The angles of the figure masculine shew a
man ; and if feminine, a woman. If i or the ) be the
significator, or V, when aspecting them, it is a female:
11, 'll., ~, 0, and V aspecting them, a male.
Whether one Thief or more't
If the siguificator be in a fixed sign, it denotes one only;
if he be in double-bodied signs, it denotes more than one,
especially if there be more than one planet in the sign, and
they peregrine. , Also, when 0 and ]) are in angles, and
in c aspect, it shews more than one. If the 11ignificator
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 209
be in czo, ht., 01· )(, it is a testimony of there being more
than one: the angles being moveable, the same. The )
in the ascendant, and in a double bodied sign, shews more
than one. And if the significator be in aspect with more
than one planet, unless he be in a fixed sign, it shews
plurality.
. Of the Colour oftlte Thiefa Clothes.
This must be judged in a general manner; and by the
colours of the signs and houses of the significator, and the
planets ruling them. Thus, 11 is black ; 11- green, spotted,
or ash ; ~ red; 0 tawny, or saffron, or sandy ; an<_l if
you mix the colours according to the signs and planets, &c.,
you will judge very nearly the general colour of the thiers
clothes. Thus, 11 and 11-, mixed, give dark green, or green·
spotted with black ; 11 and ~ , a dark reddish brown, Ol'
tawny; 11 and 0, a blackish orange, and shining; 11 and
i , a whitish grey ; 11 and ~ , a black blue ; 11 and }) , a
deep russet, or grey; 11- and ~, a tawny, light spotted;
11- and 0, a deep, shining red; '1l. and ~, a greenish
grey ; 11- and ~ , a spotted green ; 11- and }) , a high co-
loured green ; ~ and 0, a deep red, or scarlet ; ~ and i ,
light red, or crimson; ~ and ~ , a tawny red, or brick
colour; ~ and l>, a light red, glistening.
You must observe, that if the signifier be 11, in his own
house, l1', and not in close aspect with any other planet,
the thief will be dressed all in black; because both sign
and planet rule that colour. But if he were in the 1st
house, which rules white, he would have some wltite about
his person. Also, if it were ~ , who rules red, and he were
found in lfl, which rules brown, he would denote a rusty,
dirty, reddish brown; but if he were in .Q, which rules red
artd green, and 11- were in aspect, there would be much
greeu, as well as red, about the dress; and so oC the others.

1'he relation the Thief bears to the Owner.
The lord of the 7th, or significator of the thief, being in

who frequents his house; and is in no way suspected.
If the significator of the thief be in the 2d, it is one of
the household, or an acquaintance; but if in a feminine
sign, it may be the querent's wife ot· maid-servant; and it
is in the loser's power, and may be recovered by money.
If he be in the 3d, it is one of his near kindred or neigh-
bours; or some messenger, or other person, often in his
sight.
If in the 4th, it is his father, or some elderly person, or
one who resides in the house, &c., of his father; or he is a
labourer or farm-servant.
If in the fifth, it is his son or daughter, or one of the
near relations of his brother or sister, or near neighbour;
or one of the household of his father, or his kept mistress,
or some one connected with taverns, theatres, &c.
If he be in the 6th, it is a servant, or the querent's fa-
ther's relation; or it is some person in bad health.
If he be in the 7th, it may be his own wife or lover, or
some female who bas been suspected of having connexion
with the querent: or it is some person with whom he deals
publicly, or one who is his open enemy.
If in the 8th, it is a stranger ; yet it is likely to be one
who is, or has been, at times employed about the house;
such as an occasional gardener, or charwoman, washer-
woman, &c.
If in the 9th, it is some traveller or vagrant, or some
person employed about churches, &c. ; or a person in con-
nexion with some jailor, or master of a workhouse, &.c.
If in the lOth, it is a person of respectable circum-
stances, or some master tradesman, &c.; one not necessitated

to turn thief; and, generally, a person who lodged in the
house, or visited it frequently when the thing was taken.
If in the 11th, a friend, or one who is trusted, and baa
done the querent some service; or one connected with a
neighboming clergyman, or the household of the querent'a
mother.
If in the 12th house, it is a strange1·, or some poor, com~
mon thief or beggar; a person in miserable circumstances,
who partly lives by thieving or thief taking.
Other Particulars of the Thiej:
If the thief's significator be in the end of a sign, or
applying to a planet in the 3d or 9th, he is going off; and
if it be a superior planet, and leaving a sign, he is un.
doubtedly leaving his house or lodgings, &c.
If his significator be in an angle, he is still in the town ;
if succeedent, he is not far off; but if cadent, he is far
gone.
If it be in an angle, he is in a house; and if ) be in an
angle, in his own house, &c.; if in a succeedent, in a field or
enclosure; and if )) be succeedent, it is his own, or where
he resides ; and if in a cadent house, he is on a common
'Or open place, and if ) be cadent, it belongs to the town,
&c. where he lives.
If the lord of the ascendant and the significator of
the thief be together, the thief is with the querent. And
if the thief's significator·be in the ascendant, the thief will
be at the querent's house before the querent. But if the
significator be in the 7th, he is hid at home, and dare not
be seen. The direction in which the thief lives may be
judged by the sign and quarter in which the significator is.
The ]) denotes alio the door of the thief's house. If
she be in a fixed sign, the house has but one door; if in
a moveable sign, the door is high above the earth, and

street; if she increase, and is near 0. it is low down, and
there is a step to deRcend in entering. But if }> be in a
moveable sign, there are steps up to it.
Whether the Goods are it~ the Hands of the Thief:
If the thief's significator be in aspect to, and disposed
of by another planet, they are not in his hands; otherwise
they are.
1'he Place where the Goods are.
The nature of the place is judged by the lord of the 4th
house. If he be in a moveable sign, it is in a place high
above.the ground;, in a fixed sign, in the earth ; and in a
common sign, it is under the eaves of a bouse, &c. • And
you must judge also by the quality of the sign ; as 'Y' shews
a place where small cattle are, as sheep, hogs, &c. Q. shews
a place of animals that bite, as dogs, foxes, &c. ; t a place
of animals that are ridden, as horses, mules, &c., and their

In what Part of a House Things lost, stolen, or con·
cealed may be.
If the thing lost be in the house, (whether stolen or not),
behold the lord of the 4th, (or, if a planet be in the 4th,
take him in preference).
It it be T, , it is in a dark or secret place ; and if he

Generally, if there be a diminution of their light and

covered.

Of tl1e Thief's Person.
In addition to the planet's general description in the
sign be is in, observe the aspects be bas, and-take all these
into consideration. Moreover, if the significator be orien-
tal, and in st., "Jl, or t, the person is large; if occidental,
and in !!D, h'J., or )(, the body is smaller. If the planet
have south latitude, he is nimble : if in north latitude, slow
in his motions. If going out of one sign into another, be
is weak and feeble•.
• J, shews one of a pale, swarthy, dark complexion; bard, rough
skin ; hairy body; small, leering eyes; jaundiced look ; lean, crook-

legged, or one who knocks his kneel! or ancles one against the other,
and shuffles in his gait. He bas a down look, his eyes always on the
earth ; is seldom free from cough and bad breath. He is crafty, re-
vengeful, and malicious; dirty, a great eater, covetous, and seldom
rich.
1/. denotes a full face, white and red mixed ; full eyes; good
make, light beard, but this depends chiefly on the &ign; thick hair,
good teeth, but ~orne defect in the two front teeth; moderately curl-
ing hair. If in a watery sign, fat and plump; in an earthy sign, large

character.
8 denotes a full face, red or sunburnt; a sharp, fierce counte-
nance ; eyes fiery and ferocious, with rather a yellow tinge ; hair and
beard reddish ; but this depends on the sign, unless be be with fixed
stars of his own nature, such as Aldebaran, the Lion's Heart, etc.
In earthy signs it is a sad brown; in watery, lighter or flaxen; in
airy, curling or crisping; in fiery, strong and wiry. He is strong,
broad shouldered, proud, scornful, drunken, and debauched ; with a
mark or scar, generally in the face.

house, its lord and planets therein, for the adversary. Be-
hold whose significators are most angular, best dignified
and aspected, and expect victory for that party. If evil
plant:ts be in the ascendant, and fortunes in the ith, the
adversary shall overcome, and vice versa: also the lord of
the 7th, in the ascendant, betokens victory to the querent,
and vice versa.
Whether on9 one shall return safe from War, or all!J
dangerous Vo9age, ~c.
The lord of the ascendant, strong, well aspected, and his
dispositor a good planet; good planets in the ascendant,
or aspecting its cusp, are all good testimonies ; and the
reverse are evil. If the lord of the 7th, and the 7th house,
be fortunate, (though the first be not), the party returns,
though not without great crosses and hinderances : et e
contra. Observe how }) is disposed; for her application to
the good planets is fortunate ; and the contrar,y. Evil
planets in the 8th are signs of fear and death ; J, shews
bruises and hurts by falls, &c., and losses; 3 denotes
wounds by weapons; ~, injuries and disgrace.
If an evil planet be with the lord of the ascendant, and
a good one in the ascendant, he will sufter great loss or be
sorely wounded, but not die.
J, In the 1st, or with its lord, shews loss to the querent
by one whom be will meet ; J, in the 1st, and an evil
planet with its lord, he shall be wounded by wood or stone;
3 shews wounds by fire or iron, and if ~ be in the ascend-
ant, and 3 affiict its lord, he shall receive a wound, and
be nearly killed. It is evil if 0 be with the lord of the
7th, or be in the 8th.
The lord of the ascendant in the 8th, or with its lord, or
the lord of the 8th in the ascendant, denotes the querent's

death. And the lord of the 7th in the second, or with its
lord, shews the death of the adversary.
If the lord of the 7th be strong, and have good aspects ·
from the 10th, or its lord, the querent will gain honour.
And if the cusp of the 2d and its lord, and EB or its lord,
be fortunate, then he gains money by the war, &c.
In the same manner as the 8th house and its lord shew
death, the 12th and its lord denote imprisonment.
And if the question concern the general result of a war or
expedition, it must be judged on the same principles.
Of Partnership.
If good planets be in the Lst and 7th, the partnership
shall be and do well. And if the lord of the 7th be
strong, and in fixed signs, it shall endure. If the two
lords agree in aspects, and by mutual reception, the part-
ners will accord well togethet·. But if they disagree, the
fault will be with that party who has \1, ~ , 3 , or " in their
house.
The significators of substance will shew the means of
each party ; and as they may be about to receiYe good or
ill aspects, will they thrive or lose by the concern. The
8th, its lord, and planets there, are for the quesited's pro-
perty.
If l> separate from one fortune, and apply to the other,
they will neitJter of them gain much by the concem. If
she leave a good planet and apply to an ill, they begin
well but end ill : and if she separate from one evil planet,
and apply to another, they begin with complaini~g, con-
tinue with jealousy, and end with lawsuits. An evil
planet, or " in the 2d, the querent gains but little, will be
cheated, or get into debt: if they be in the 8th, judge this
of the quesited. And if the lord of the 7th or 8th, c or

8 E9, the querent may hope but little gain from his part-
ner, who will embezzle the common stock, &.c.
Of removi11g from Place to Place.
The lord of the ascendant and planets therein stronger
than the 7th, and planets there, it is better to remain. If
there be a benefic in the 7th or Q, and especially if l> se-
parate from an infortune, remove; an evil planet there, or
the lord of the 1st or }) leaving a benefic, remain.
The ~th house shews the property of the querent in' the
place he desires to remove to : if evil planets be there, it is
better to remain. (See also p.l41)
Of Lawsuits, and their Success.
The lord of the ascendant or }) joined to the lord of the
7th, or in * or l::., with reception mutual, the parties will
easily agree together, and make up the quarrel. But if
one dispose of the other, and the reception be not mutual,
they will agree without a lawsuit, but not without the in-
terceding of friends. If they be in good aspect without, or
in evil aspect with, reception, they will accord, after one
effort at law. That party shall be most ready to agree
whose significatot· is disposed of by the other. If they
hasten to a mutual good aspect, and the lord of the 9th or
lOth interpose an evil aspect, they will be led to dispute by
a lawyer or by the judge. If th~re be any translation of
light by the l>, or other planet, between the two significa-
tors, it denotes that they will be reconciled by a third per-
son, described by that planet.
Observe whether the lord of the ascendant or 7th be
strongest or most powerful, and best aspected ; for that one
shall gain the day. If they compound, the first motion
thereto comes from the lighter planet, who is disposed of

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 221
by the other. If the lord of the ascendant be in the 7th,
the adversary will overcome, and vice versa. If eithet·
lord of tht> 1st or 7th be retrograde, he shews that the party
does not believe that be has right on his side ; nor will he
stand to it very stoutly.
If the lord of the lOth, which denotes the judge, be
direct, he will proceed fairly, and endeavour to settle the
cause speedily. But if he be retrograde, the judge will
not act fairly according to law, nor strive to terminate the
cause. If the lord of the lOth throw an evil aspect to
either significator, the judge will be against that party.
If 0 or D be in the ascendant, or aspect its lord, or be
in either of his houses, it is a good testimony for the
querent; and if, on the contrary, the lord of the 7th be so
situated, it is in favour of the quesited. If the lord of the
lOth receive both significators, the judge will settle the
matter before it comes to full trial.
If the lord of the lOth be in the lOth, in his own house,
the judge will do justice, and decide the case with honour
to himself, unless the lord of the lOth be T,. If the lord
of the lOth be only in his own term, or triplicity, the
judge will determine the cause, but he is indifferent about
it. If a planet having no dignities, or not in reception with
the lord of the lOth, be in the lOth, the parties will not
be satisfied with that judge or court. If T, be judge, he
will not decide aright; and if 11-, i , 0, ~ , or Dbe in any
aspect to him but 8 , there will be an ill report against him,
of which he will clear himself; but if it be 8 , he will
have a hard report against him, wh~ch will long continue.
And if t 8 to T,, the judge will be sorely defamed; and
if also 0 o T, , he may be disgraced.
In deciding as to the result, observe well the lord of the
4th, and how he aspects the significators, or the lords of
their substance; also the application of the l>. If both

aignificators aspect one planet, some person will intercede
between them. If the ascendant and 7th be in fixed signs,
both parties are resolutely bent on the suit ; if common
signs, they will continue it long also, and remove the cause
out of one court into another ; and if moveable signs, they
are not very determined, and will soon bring it to an end.
That party who is weakest, and most amicted by the
infortunes, shall receive most prejudice by the contention.
Of makiug Purcltases or Sales.
If l> be joined with the lord of the 7th, the querent may
make the purchase. The lighter planet of the two houses
(1st and 7th) will be the occasion of the sale. Judge the
nature of the commodity by the bouse by which it is go-
verned ; as the 4th for a house, the 12th for large cattle,
the 9th for books, &c., the lOth for merchandize.
If infortunes be in the 7th, be cautious of the seller; be
will try to trick the purchaser. The 4th house will shew
the final result ; but if l> be void of course, there may be
many meetings, &c., but scarcely any bargain concluded.
Whether a City, Town, Castle, ~c. besieged, shall be taken
or not.
The ascendant and its lord are for the querent and for
the besiegers ; the 4th signifies the place besieged or to
be besieged, and the lord of the 4th the governor ; the 5th
and planets therein the ammunition, soldiers, &c. in the
place.
If you find the lord of the first strong and fortunate, or
joined to the lord of the 4th in the ascendant, or with the
) or lord of the lOth, or any where but in the 6th, 8th, or
12th, and the lord of the 1st dispose of the lord of the
4th ; or if 1> dispose him, and be not disposed of by him,
it is an argument that the place shall be taken. Or if the

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 223
lord of the 4th be in such houses as behold not the 4th,
and be with infortunes, and weak, it wi11 be taken, and the
governor may be wounded. If infortunes be in the 4th,
without some strong aspect of the fortunes, it will be taken.
If ~ be in the 4th, it will be taken, and some parties will
try to betray it, or some principal work or fort therein: the
sign will shew which part of the town, &c. In this case
the governor does not expect to preserve it.
If the lord of the 4th be in the 4th, strong and not afllict-
ed, neither retrograde nor combust, nor besieged of the in-
fortunes, or if the lord of the 7th be there, free from all im-
pediments, or if '11., i , or Q be therein, and no reception
between the lords of the 1st and 4th, then shall not the
city, &c. be taken; and if there he both a fortune and in-
fortune in the 4th, it shall not be taken, if the fortune be
the nearest to the cusp, or first transit that degree; and this
more certainly, if the lord of the ascendant be weak or un-
fortunate, especially if a light planet. But if the_lord of
the ascendant be strong, or fortune therein, and the ]) be-
bold the cusp of the 4th, it shall be surprised or surrendered.
An infortune in the 2d, or its lord, &c. afllicted, the querent

Of Commanders in Armies; and whether the!J shall be

If there be an infortune in the ascendant, it shews that
the querent has no great justice on his part, or cause of
quarrel. And if an infortune 0 the ascendant, the party
shewn by it (viz. that for which the querent asks) will not
manage their affairs well or discreetly. If a good planet be
in the ascendant1 or aspect it by *or l:J., it shews a good
cause, and that it will be well managed.
An evil star in the 2d, and having no dignities therein,

there will be no war, or that the querent will gain nothing
by it : a benefic testifies the reverse. If 1/. (or 8 well
dignified) be in the 3d, the querent's party will have good
warlike stores, &c., and will consist of good, brave soldiers;
but if 8 be there, ill dignified, they will be bad characters,
and i1l disciplined.
If an infortune be in the 4th, the campaign will be
held in a difficult country. If the sign describe a hilly
country, it will offer obstacJes by woods and bad roads;
and if it shew a moist country, it will be unfit for military
occupations, by reason of rivers, marshes, &c.; and so the

If 8 be in the 5th, well dignified, or a fortune aspect
it, the army on the querent's side will be good soldiers, and
well behaved ; but ~ there, or ts, denoies the contrary.
If a fortune or Q be in the 6th, the ammunition train,
artillery, &c. will be good ; if 8 be there, the horses will
be fierce, wild, and unbroken. If ~ be there (without
dignities), they will be unserviceable, slow, and-worn out.
A fortune in the 7th, the arms and instruments of war
will be plentiful and serviceable. If an infortune be there,
or afllicting it by evil aspect, they will be the reverse. . In
the former case, the enemy will be brave, and no fool, and
will fight fair ; in the latter case, the enemy will fight
rather by craft and treachery, than fair manhood.
A fortune in the 8th, shews that there will not be many
men slain on the querent's side; nor any very important
battle be fought. If ~be there, there will be much plunder-
ing and ~estruction, and many prisoners be taken ; also
much death by sick/)ess and want, &c. If 8 be there,
then expect much bloodshed.

he is politic. If an infortune, he will wear himself out by

and if a fortune be in the 3d at the same time, the querent's
side will gain by this conduct of the enemy.
A fortune in the lOth, or aspecting its cusp by * or 6.,
shews that the commanding officer is expert and capable.
But if 17, ", or t, (unfortunate), be there, or afBict
the lOth house by o, the commander on the querent's side
will be extremely incapable and unworthy, and meet only
disgrace. _
A fortune or g in the 11th, shews the officers are clever,
and understand their duty, and will well support the com-
mander; but an infortune or " , the reverse.
lfa fortune (orct well dignified) be in the12th, it denotes
that the enemy is well prepared, and will defend themselveS
well. An infortune there, shews that they are weak and
will disagree among themselves, and fear their own forces.
If U be in the 12th, the querent may expect treachery;
and if the lord of the 12th be there, and have any dignities
in the ascendant, the querent's side will suffer by desertion.

look to the 12th house. If it be as to some individual
enemy, see whether the lord of the 7th, or planet therein,
throw a [J or 8 to the lord of the ascendant, or }) ; this de-
notes that the quesited is envious or inimical. If the
aspect apply, the enmity will increase; and if the enemy's
significator dispose of the querent's without reception
mutual, the querent will suffer by him : the manner how
may be learned by the house he is in. If the aspect be
past, the injury is done, and the enmity is dying away,
unless the querent's significator, or I>, be about to receive
another ill aspect.
If the quesited's significator be placed in the 12th, or in
any good aspect with any planet which is in c or 8 to
the I>, or lord of the ascendant, without reception, there is
enmity to the querent.
If the question be general, the lord of the 12th and
planets therein must be taken; and they shew private
enemies to the querent, unless a benefic planet be in the
12th, and throw a*, or A, to the querent's significators.
If there be many planets in the 7th, it shews many open
enemies ; and if in the 12th, many secret foes. The [J
shews envy and malice, which may be reconciled; the 8,
if without reception, denotes irreconcilable enemies. If an
evil planet in the 12th throw a good aspect to the querent's
significator, it shews that there is some person who under
pretence of friendship wishes to injure the querent• . The
same if the lord of the 11th be in the 12th. The house the
lord of the 12th is in, will describe what person wm injure

State of the Querent's case.-A gentleman had been a
long time an earnest suitor unto her for marriage ; but she
had continually slighted, and at last had given him a posi-
tive denial; after which she sorely repented -her conduct,
and wished she had her former opportunity. She was in
this state when she propounded her question to me.
The ascendant and 0 are for the querent; ~, lord of

eyes, light brown hair, occasioned by 0, lord of the

ascendant, being in the terms of 1 , and she was of cheerful
modest countenance, comely, and well spoken.
Finding f1, in the south angle, in cS with 1 in H , a
fixed, earthy sign, I judged the quesited to be of middle
stature, not tall, nor handsome ; a long face, not well com-
posed ; a wan, pale complexion; hair dark, or of a sad
chesnut colour, curling and crisp ; his eyes fixed, always
down-looking, musing, stooping forward with his head,
some impediment in his walking, as treading awry, &c.
(All this was confessed.)
Finding l1 so elevated, and in cS I , I judged that he
was gloomy and angry, discontented, scorning his former
slights, (as all saturnine people do); and I judged him
much incensed by a relation, a gentleman of respectability,
shewn by 1, lord of his 3d and lOth, and that this gentle-
man and he lived either in one house, or near each other;
this being shewn by the significator's being in his 4th angle
and fixed; (and so it was.)
I said the gentleman had no inclination for her, as the
l> was void of course, and applied to 8 of 0, lord of the
ascendant, which shewed that she herself was her own
enemy. She then confessed the truth, and implored my
advice how, consistent with honour, she might, if possible,
bring it on again ; and she appearing in great distress, I
began to consider what hopes she had in the figure. I
found 0 applying to * of l1 ; this argued her desire and
affection towards the quesited : but as there was no recep-
tion it gave little hopes. Finding reception between
']f. and l>, and 0 and l>, and also that l> disposed of
f1 in her exaltation, and 'lf. in her house, and that ']f.
was very near a * of l1, applying, and not separat-
ing; and also that 'lf. was in his exaltation, be being a
fortune, and ever assisting nature and the .afflicted, and
that he was able to take off the malice of l1; I was confi-

dent, from the exactness of the aspect, that the qucsited
was intimately acquainted with a person of rank and worth,
(such as ~ represented), whom I exactly described, and
the lady very well knew. I directed her to apply to him.
and acquaint him with the full extent of her folly, and I
assured her that in him she would find all honour and se-
crecy ; and I doubted notbut, by God's blessing, he would
again revive the business, and bring her to her heart's con-
tent. But finding that 0 and ~ came to * aspect on
the 27th of the month, I advised to hasten all before that
aspect was over; and as on the 19th of June ~ and 'll-
came to a *,I told her that the gentleman should first
move the quesited on that day near noon. My counsel was
followed, and by that gentleman's means the match was
brought on again, and completed within twenty days, to
the content of the sorrowful (but to me unthankful)
lady, &c. .
I acquainted this lady, that shortly before her lover had
been offered a match, and that the lady was well descended,
of good fortune, and described by ~ ; but that she need
not fear his marrying her, as some officer or gentleman,
who had been in the army, shewn by 8, would prevent
that. She well knew both the parties, and confessed that
such a matter had been.
Had the query been, who should live lo11gest? I should have
judged the female,because0 is going to cS ~,and 8 affiicts ~.
If, whether the quesited were rich' I should say be bad
a good estate, as ~'lord of his 2d, was direct, swift, and
in his exaltation, &c.
If, would the!f agree1 I should say they would, as 0
and ~ are applying to .*; yet 'f1 with 3 shews a man
who looks to have authority, one choleric as well as melan-
choly, jealous without a cause, &c.; yet the * of 1l- miti-
gates his ill manners by means of education.

JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE QUESTION.
The querent was of tall stature, ruddy complexion, so-
ber, discreet, and well spoken, &c. The quesited was very
tall, slender, lean, and of a long visage, with black hair.
His tallness I attribute to 11. being in the terms of ~ , and
the cusp of the 7th being also in his terms. Indeed, a

party from his natural constitution ; so that he will retain a
tincture from that planet, according as he is dignified•.
The darkness of his hair I attribute to the aspect of f1 to
'lJ, and }) being in the term of 'lJ.
~ is here the querent's significator; and being retro-
grade, and under the beams of 0, shewed that she was in
distreas and fear that the quesited would not have her.
And she bad some reason for it ; for 'lf. was in his exalta-
tion, and near the * of ~ , an argument that the man stood
upon high terms, and had been tampering with another:
yet, as both significators were in semi-sextile aspect, and in
good houses, I gathered hope that there were some mutual
sparks of love. And when I found )) separating from o
of 'lJ, and hastening to ~ of ~ , thus conveying the light
of the quesited's significator to the lord of the ascendant,
which he received willingly by his retrograde movement,
I was confident that the match would be suddenly brought
about by a pea'Son described by )) ; who did, indeed,
though with a little difficulty, produce the marriage to the
content of both parties.

JUDGMENT UPON THE ABOVE FIGURE,
The ascendant, ~ in :::, and 8 in a, taken together,
signified and described the querent, (the se"ant's master).
He was short of stature, corpulent, ofgood complexion, and
ruddy, fresh colour. His fatness I attribute to the north
latitude of ~ , which was one degree; also the ascendant
was in the terms of 8 , and face of 0, who was in pa1tile

I observed that he went away from his master the pre-
ceding Sunday, wheu }) was in u , a western sign, where
1 now was ; and that ~ , the common significator of
servants, was in =, a western sign, but south quarter of
heaven.
I judged, therefore, that he went westward at first, and
that at the time of the question he was west from the que-
rent's house; and this I judged, because 1 was angular,
otherwise I should have judged by )) • As 1 and ~ ,
lord of the ascendant, were hastening to a A out of angles,
I judged that in a day or two he should have his servant

Upon the Friday following he came home, and said he

nearly west, but a little south; and near a great water,

A Dog mloaing ; where
he may be found ?
JUDGMENT UPON THE ABOVE FIGURE.
The queries to me were, What part of the citg theg
should search? and, should he befound?
The querent was described by the sign ascending, and
Cauda ( ~) therein: and, indeed, he was 1aturnine, and vi-
tiated both in body and mind ; that is, he was a little de-
formed in body, of small stature, and extremely covetous in
disposition, &c. The sign of the 6th signifies a dog, as it
would have done a sheep, hog, &c., or any small cattle.
The sign n is west and by south, the quarter of heaven
westerly; ~, the dog's significator, is in ~, a western
sign, and is in a south-western quarter of heaven; the ])

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 235
is in I!Jt, a south-west sign, verging to the west angle.
The plurality of testimonies shewed that the dog ought to
be west from where the owner lived, which was atTemple-
bar; therefore I judged that the dog was about Long
.Acre, or upper part of Drury-lane. As ~ was in a sign
of the same triplicity with n, which signifies London, and
applied to A of the cusp of the 6th, I judged that the dog
was not out of the lines of communication, but in the same
quarter; of which I was more satisfied by the A of 0 to
'f1. ~ being in an airy sign, I said the dog was in some
garret or upper room; and as ]) was under the beams of
0 , and ~ , ]) , and G were in the 8th house, that he was
kept privately, or in great secrecy. But as 0, on the fol-
lowing Monday, formed a A to 1}, lord of the ascendant,
and ]) formed a A to 8 , who has dignities in the ascend-
ant, I intimated that be should then have news of his
dog: and this proved true; for a gentleman of the que-
rent's acquaintance, coming accidentally to see a friend in
Long Acre, found the dog chained up under a table, and,
knowing him to belong to the querent, sent him home
about ten o'clock on the Monday morning, to my very great
credit.
Usually I find that all fugitives go by the l>; and as she
varies her sign, they waver and shift their flight, declining
more to east, west, north, or south. But you must judge
by the.significator or the "»,according to which is strongest;
or ifboth be equally strong, take that which best describes
the fugitive, with regard also to that one which is nearest
in aspect to the cusp of the house from whence significa-
tion is taken. That is, if the fugitive be a servant or small
animal, the 6th ; if a large animal, the 12th ; if a son or
daughter, the 5th; and if a wife, the 7th, &c.

Here nt. ascends, and partly describes the querent's per-

shewed him ill-conditi~ned, arrogant, proud, wasteful, &.c.
As 1 is in 25°:¥ of~' he has entered his own terms, and is
in his own face, I therefore refused, him for the thief's
significator. In the next place, 11, though in the west
angle, (the house of theft), is in his own term and face;
I also passed him by. But finding V in an angle, having
no essential dignity, and in partite cS of 11 , and o of I ,
I took him to signify the- thief. But whether he described
a male or female was the question. The angles are part
masculine, part feminine; no certainjudgment could, there-

fore, be formed from thence. The I> was in a masculine
sign, applying to a masculine planet, ( 8 ), and ~ was in
cS with l}, and 0 to 8, both masculine planets; I judged,
therefore, that the sex was male.
As ~ ever signifies youth, and as I> was so near the 0,
separating, I said be was a youth, of some 15 or 16. I
described him of reasonable stature, thin visaged, hanging
eyebrows, with some scar or blemish in his face, because 8
casts his c to ~ ; bad eyesight, as ~ is with evil fixed
stars, (the Pleiades), of the nature of 8 and I>; dark hair,
because of his closeness to l1; a scurvy countenance, and
one formerly accused of theft and knavery.
The youth's significator being in cS with l1, lord of the
3d and 4th houses, I judged him the child of some neigh-
bour ; and as }) is in n , and ~ in ts in the 7th, I said
he dwelt either opposite to the querent, or a little south-
west. The E9 being in the ascendant, and disposed of by
8 , lord of the ascendant in the lOth, and as ll applied to
his *,and was within about four degrees of the aspect, I
judged be should not only hear of, but have his money
again within four days. He believed not one word I said,
but would need persuade me that a wo~an servant, shewn
by 8 , .was one thief, and l} another ; but I stood firm to the
art, and would not consent to this, as both l} and 8 were
essentially dignified. The event proved me right, both as
to the person and the return of the money, which was
within three days after.

ExPLANATION oF THE ABOVE FIGURE.
Living in the countly in 1637, I had bought at London
.some fish for my provision in Lent; it came down by the
barge to Walton. On Saturday, the lOth February, one of
the watermen, instead of bringing my fish home, acquainted
me that their warehouse was robbed last night, and my
fish stolen. I took the exact time I first heard the report,
and erected this figure accordingly; endeavouring to give
myself satisfaction as to what became of my goods, and,
if possible, to recover part or all of them.

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. - 239
Judgment.
I first observed that there was no peregrine planet in an
angle but 1f., whom I found on the cusp of the 7th house.
I considered the signification of 1f. in nt. a moist sign, and
the significator of my goods, ~ in )(, a moist sign ; and
that Ea was in !!ZI, a moist sign. Discretion, together with
art, led me to think he who had my goods must be n per-
son whose profession, or calling, was to live upon the
water; and that they were in some low room, in a moist
place, because Ea was in !ZB, and l> was in ~ , an earthy
sign, and under the earth.
I was confident I should hear of my goods again, as ~ ,
lord of the 2d, was applied to by* of )) , who was lady of
(B, and yet without hope of recovering them, as ~ was in
his fall, and detriment; but as be was in his own terms,
and had a t:.. to EB, there were hopes of regaining some of
my goods.
There being no waterman in Walton described by 1f. in
nt., I examined what fisherman there was of that com-
plexion ; and as t, lord of the 7th, was leaving nt., his
own sign, and entering another, I inquired if any fisherman
of the nature of t and 11. bad lately sold any land, or was
leaving his own house and going to another : such a one I
discovered, who lived near the Thames side, a mere fisher-
man, but a jovial fellow, though much suspected ofthievery.
He was of good stature, thick, and full-bodied, fair com-
plexion, and red or yellowish hair.
I procured a warrant from a justice of peace, andre-
se"ed it privately until Sunday, the 18th of the month;
and then, with a constable and the bargeman, I searched
only that one house of the suspected fisherman. I found
part of my fish in water, part eaten, part not consumed : all
confessed. I asked the woman for seven Portugal onions

which I had lost also ; but she, not knowing what they
were, had made pottage with them. I freely remitted the
remainder of my fish, though the hireling priest of Walton
affirmed that I had satisfaction for it. But he never hurt
himself with a lie.
Thus you see, that the peregrine planet in an angle de-
scribes the thief; and that either 0 or }) in the ascendant
gives assured hopes of discovering who it was. The )
applying to the lord of the 2d, argues recovery : if they
both be essentially dignified, complete; but if accidentally
fortified, partial. If both be peregrine, and they apply,
there will be a discovery, but no recovery.

The ascendant is for our army, the D, 1f., and ~, for
our generals, viz. Sir William Waller, and Major-General
Browne. a valiant and prudent citizen of London, wl10 may
justly claim a large share of honour in that day's service.

There are only 8 and t7 in the 9th; so it appears that
Sir Ralph had no supplies ready to attend that day's sue-
cess, &.e. From lhe l> , having principal signification of
us and our army, bein5r: in her exaltation with 'lf., I con-
cluded all was and would be well on our side, and that the
victory would be ours. From her separation from 'lf., I
said, I verily conceived that we had already taken some
ammunition from them, or performed some service against
them. This I was confirmed in by 0, lord of our sub-
stance and assistants, being posited in the lOth house, in
the very degree of his exaltation; (the 19th). And though
I thought by the proximity of J, to 0 we should not gain
the whole, or have a perfect victory, without diminution of
some part of it; yet I was confident we should obtain a
considerable proportion of their ammunition, and have a
victory, the only thing inquired after; for the l> applied
to ~,and then to a * of ~,he being angular. I told the
querent that within eleven or twelve hours after the ques-
tion we should have perfect news, and it satisfactory. For,
considering that the fight was within 50 miles of London,
I ordered my time with discretion, not allowing da_ys for
the time, but hours ; and this because l> is distant from ~
11°, but is withal swift in motion, and increasing in light.
These were also signs of onr success, and the enemies' de-
feat. It appeared, by a letter from the army on that same
Ftiday, that our generals took on the previous day 120
commande..s and gentlemen, 560 common soldiers, and
much ammunition. Thus the enemy was worsted, as ap-
peared by J,, (the Lord Hopton's significator), being sub
radiis, in his fall in no .aspect to any planet, wholly pe-
regrine, and unfortunate, and aspecting the cusp of the
7th by 0 • All this argued that he would bring loss to
his army, and dishonour to himself by the fight, &c.

and affiicted in no way but by being in his fall. This
figure manifests that it is of great importance in questions
of warfare to l1ave ~ friendly to the querent. The J) se-
parated from nothi71g, and was void ofcourse; and, indeed,
there was little hope of its being gained in the time it was.
She applied to * of 3 from signs of long ascension, which
was .equivalent to a o; which argued that his Excellency
would have much difficulty and some fighting ere he could
get it. But as ~ and ) were in reception, viz. 3 in her
house, and she in his terms and face, and near Cor n, and
in the house of honour, I judged that his Excellency would
obtain and take Reading, ~nd gain honour thereby. Find-
ing 0, his Majesty's significator, in the 7th in a fixed
sign, I said that he would send forcE:s to relieve the town,
and oppose all he could; but that he would not prevail, as
~ was better fortified than c:>. The King did come in per-
son, and was beaten back at Causham Bridge.
Finding that ::: was not affiicted, I judged the town
strong, and able to hold out; and ~ being in the 5th, that
they wanted not ammunition. Having well weighed all
thillgs, and that '17, lord of the 4th, signifying the Gover-
nor, was in his fa11 with G, and that ~ and U were not
far from ~:S, I said, (and sent somebody word), that the
most certain way, and which would assuredly occasion the
surrender of the town, was to set division among the prin-
cipal officers, and incense them against their chief officer,
and that about eight days from the time of the question his
Excellency would be master of the town ; yet rather by
composition than by blood. This because 0 and 8 were
separated from their * aspect, and ~ was also separated
from the o of 17 ; as also because the l> applied so di-
rectly to * of the lord of the ascendant, without any frus-
tration, &c.

the time the French troops opened ground, (or began the
siege), before the citadel of Antwerp. By it the student
will perceive that the rules laid down by our author, being
founded in truth and nature, are infallible ; and that they
bold equally true in the 19th as they did in the 17th cen-
tury. They must eventually put the sceptic to silence, and
convince the world of the truth of planetary inftuence.
The ascendant and its lady, the ) , are for the besiegers,
the 7th and its lord for the besieged, the 4th is for the town,
and its lord for the governor. The lOth is the house of
honour for the besiegers, and we find 11- potent therein,
denoting decidedly that they should gain honour by the
siege. The Q in the ascendant shewed success to the
French, and ~ in the 7th the reverse to their enemies.
The lord of the 4th, ~, is in his detriment, cadent, and in
exact o to the evil Q, denoting disgrace to the governor,
who is thereby shewn to be extremely obstinate, as, indeed,
he was. The malefic in the 4th denoted that the place
should be taken, and, as ]) was in close o to 8, it would
be by much loss of men and bloodshed on the part of the
besiegers. The ]) is in the terms of 8 , and be in her exal-
tatio~t and triplicity, which reception denotes courageous
conduct on the part of the besiegers ; and although the ])
is in o to 8, yet, there being mutual reception, it shews
success in a martial exploit; but with much difficulty, be-
cause of the o aspect. The garrison were denoted by the
5th, and its tuler ~; and as ~ is in the 6th, (the 12th
from the enemies' ascendant), it shewed that all the ene-
mies· party would be made prisoners, which wa(the case.
The citadel capitulated when a breach bad been effected ;
and they surrendered to the French on the 23d December
following; when the ]) , the besiegers' significator, crossed
the cusp of the 7th house; thus entering the 7th just as
the besiegers entered the place itself. It deserves notice

INTRODUCTION '1'0 ASTROLOGY. 247
that on the day ~ fell retrograde, and ) crossed the cusp
of the 5th (Dec. 15th), the besiegers carried the horn
work.
The student will observe, that the lord of the 7th was
peregrine, having no esHential dignity whatever; and that
the ) , besides her aspect and her mutual reception with 8- ,
the chief significator of warfare, is in her own face, and dis-
poses of J, by triplicity. Hence the besiegers are de-
cidedly the strongest party, and should, by the rules of the
science, certainly prevail.
The student may rely that the figure of the heavens at
the first moment of commencing any enterprize whatever,
will infallibly point out, to those who really understand
astrology, its final result.
CHAPTER XXXI.
OF THE EIGHTH HOUSE, AND ITS QUESTIONS:
THESE ARE DEATH, DowRY, THE WIPE's
SuBsTANCE, &c.
QuERY.- Whether an absent Person be dead ur alive~
TAKE care to learn whether the quesited be any relation to
the querent: if so, look to the house signifying that rela-
tion; and if not, look to the 7th for the quesited's 'signifi-
cator. If the lord of the quesited's ascendant be in the 4th
or 8th, either from his own house or in the figure, it is one
argument that the party is dead. If, also, his significator
be in the 12th, or his own 12th in o or 8 to a malefic, or
if ]) or 0 be unfortunate in like way, you have strong
testimony that he is deceased.
If the significator of the absent be strong, and in a good
hou~e, and separated from a fortune, he is not dead. If he

be a8lieted, and was lately in 8 or 0 of an evil planet, I
judge that be bas been in trouble or misfortune, according
to the nature of the bouae from whence a8lieted ; but not
dead, unless the lord of the 8th a8liet him aiAO, and the
lights be afilieted.
Of tile Death of tAe Quem&/ ?
If any one ask concerning the probable length of his
life, or when he may probably die, observe the ascendant,
ita lord, and ) ; also, the lord of the 8th, an unfortunate
planet iu the 8th, and that planet to whom the lord of the
1st or ]) be joined by cS , 0, or 8 ; and you may de-
termine the death of the querent, according to the num-
ber of degrees between the significator and the aspect of
the a8licting plauet. If the lord of the ascendant be in
cS with the lord of the 8th in an angle, it notes so many
years ; for in this question angles do not accelerate death,
but shew that life and nature are strong. If in a suceeed-
ent house, months; though if the sign be fixed, it gives
half years, half months. In a cadent house: weeks. But
you must always consider whether the significators are
extremely a8licted ; if not, the querent may live longer, and
only be near death at the time threatened. The lord of the
ascendant is more to be considered in this case than the
) ; and, therefore, his cS with the lord of the Sth or 0 is
to be most feared.
Observe that the }) being strong even, yet if the lord of
the ascendant be affiicted extremely, she does not denote
health or life, but only success in his affairs, &c. Aspects
by separation are not to be considered, but only those by
application •.
• If the f11tal cS or aspect fllll in the term of 11- or ~, or exactly
in their *or 6, there is much less fear of death.

IN'.fRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 249
What manner lif Death the Querent shall die ?
This judgment is chiefly shewn by the lord of the 8th,
if in the 8th, or any planet therein or nearest to its cusp,
and having dignities in the 8th house ; or from the planet
which afflicts the lord of the ascendant, and has dignities iri
the 8th. Ifit be either 11. or i , or that they be in the 8th
house, or aspect its cusp by *or 4, they shew a natural
death by such diseases as they shew in the sign they are in,
and the part of man's body it governs. If evil planets be
there, they shew violent deaths, or fevers, and long and
painful illnesses ; and if the figure be violent, it may be
by accidents, &.c. The ~ with the significator of death
is very evil; and if it be ~, (and~ assist by her 0, &.c.),
it shews fear of poison. The lord of the 1st and 8th being
the same planet, shews that the querent b1·ings on his own
death by imprudence, &.c.
Whetlter the Wife's Fortune will be great, or easilg obtained,
or whether the Person inquired of be t·ich or not?
The cusp of the 8th, in terms of 1f. or ~ , giveR good
hopes of wealth, or if 1f. or i be therein. If they be
essentially strong, and free from combustion, &.c., they de-
note much wealth ; but though well dignified, if they be
combust, slow, or retrograde, they shew trouble in pro-
curing the fortune, &.c. The lord of the 8th in the 8th, and
strong, and no way afBicted, gives good hopes of some
estate or legacy to fall to the quesited ; this is more sure if
either the lord of the 4th or lOth be in good aspect with
the lord of the 8th from angles. If$ be in the 8th, and
in .s1.., or :::, or any of the houses of 1f. or ~ , or they in
good aspect to E9, the quesited's fortune is good. The dis-
positor of E9 in good aspect to it, or 1f. and i , shew the
same thing. If all these happen, the quesited is very
rich.

~ IN'lRO»UCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
If 'f1 or 1 be in the 8th and peregrine, the party is poor.
or there will be contention about the property. The lord
of the 8th combust, shews slow performance, and little
ability of what ie promised; and if e be in the 8th, and
no planet there, fraud is intended, or more will be promised
than can be performed.
The lord of Lhe 8th in the 2d, or in * or 4 to its lord,
the querent shall have what is promised: in 0 1 with diffi-
culty ; in 8 , with much wrangling ; if without reception,
never. But weigh well what the particular figure promises
besides these general rules.
Whether the Querent shall suffer by a particular Thing of
which he is in fear?
If you find the ) afBicted, or the lord of the ascendant
unfortunate and falling from an angle, or especially if he
be in the 12th, and the ) with him, there is ground for
his fear; and he may expect to be accused, &c. of much
of which be is not guilty. If the lord of the 1st ascends
into the 11th or lOth, or be joined to a fortune, he shall not
be injured. If he apply to infortunes, the thing threatened
is true ; but if to a fortune, and not at the same time to an
infortune, it is false or ungrounded. The ]) in 6. to 0
discovers all suddenly. The ]) cadent, and applying to a
cadent planet, the supposed danger will be nothing, or come
to nothing in the end.

Ifthere be good planets in the 9th, or its cusp be well
aspected, OI' the lord of the ascendant or lOth be there, and
well affected, it is good. But if 1.!,1, ~, t , or ~ be there,
it is always evil. If the lord of the 9th be with an evil planet,
he shall not speed well. ~ shews losses and sickness ; t
shews danger by thieves or pirates; and ~ much the same
as t , but more of cozening and cheating. The house of
substance from the 9th is the lOth. Fortunes there shew
wealth ; infortunes loss. If benefics be in the 9th, a good
voyage; if malefics, many hardships, &c.

The lord of the ascendant with good planets, and they

journey; if it be in the lOth, then he will have success on
the journey ; if in the 7th, at the place to which he goes;
and if in the 4th, it will be on his return, and when he is
come home. In this case 'lf. gives benefits by clerical pe•·-
sons, judges, magistrates, or gentlemen, according to the

nobleman, or person in power; if T, , it will be by old peo-
ple, or ancient matters, or farmers, &c. Let him apply to
such a person in his affairs as 11 describes, according to the
sign he is in and the aspects he receives. If it be ~ , it
will be by women, pleasure, sport, &c. ; or by dealing in
linen, silks, jewels, spices, &c. If ~,by writing or mer-
chandize, letters of introduction, &c. If )) , by some fe-
male, probably a widow, or by a sailor, or by carrying news,
&c., or by play.
Of the ·Length ofthe Journey, S;c.
The lord of the 9th, or planet therein, or j) in moveable
signs, swift and oriental, shew a short time absent. 1£
they be in fixed signs, slow and occidental, it shews a long
and tedious journey and absence. If they be in common
signs, they shew change of mind, and a varying of his jour-
ney, going to other places, &c. According as the )> is
assisted or affiicted, judge results to happen. As, for ex-
ample, if J> be in the 6th, or in 8 to its lord, it shews
sickness or impediments from servants. The lord of the
4th, and the 4th house, denote the final issue.
Of the Return, S;c., of a Person who ia gone a long Journey.
The lord of the ascendant in the ascendant or midhea-
ven, or aspected by planets therein, shews that he is think-
ing of returning. But if he be in the 7th or 4th, his return

2M lNTJtoDUCTlON TO ASTUOLOGY.
is prolonged ; and he is not thinking of leaving the place
he went to. The lord of the ascendant in the 3d or 9th,
applying to a planet in the ascendant, he is on his j~urney
homeward. The same may be judged if he be in the 8th or
2d, and apply to a planet in the lOth ; but in this case ob-
serve also the ]) , and whether she aspect the ascendant, or
a planet therein. If the lord of the ascendant or ]) apply
to a retrograde planet, or the lord of the ascendant be him-
self a·etrograde, and behold the ascendant, he is coming;
but if his significator be afBicted, it shews some hinderance
which makes him tarry. The dispositor of the ]) afBicted,
shews hinderance also.
If you find ~ or the ]) in the ascendant or midheaven,
judge that letters or some news shall come shortly from the
party; for ~ is the significator of letters, and the ]) of
news. If they separate from a fortune, it denotes good
news ; and if from an infortune, the contrary.
The planet from whom the lord of the ascendant of the
qnesited is separated, is the significatgr of the state and
condition in which he lately was; the planet to whom he
applies, of the state in which he now is; and the planet to
whom he afterwards applies is the significator of him to
whom he intends to come.
If the quesited's significator be going out of one sign
into another, judge that he went out of the place he was in,
and entered another, or that he has undertaken another
journey. Observe in which of those signs he was stronger,
better aspected and received, &c.; and so judge of his cor-
responding condition.
Observe, that combustion in all questions of one absent,
shews some great evil ; such as imprisonment, &c.; and if
it be in the house of death, or <:> be lord of the house of
death, it generally denotes death.
Ever consider for whom the question is asked, and take

his proper significator. The lord of the 7th for a husband
(or for any one who is no relation), the lord of the 3d a
ba·other, 5th a son, &c.; and note bow the fortunes are
placed; if strong in the figure, well aspecting the signifi-
cator of the quesited, or in his house, judge health and
prosperity ; and the reverse by infortunes.
OF PRoFIT nY, oR PROFICIENCY IN, ANY SciENCE, &c.
The ascendant, its lord, and the )) , are for the querent;
and the 9th, its lord, or planet therein, (if more than one.
the nearest to the cusp), for the science.
See whether the lord of the 9th be fortunate or not,
oriental, anguli\r, &c.; and whether he behold the lord of
the ascendant with * or A. If be be a fortune, and
aspect the lord of the ascendant, the man has scientific
knowledge, and will gain thereby ; the more so if there be
reception. If the aspect be o or 8, the man has talent,
but shall do no good by it. If an infortune aspect either
the lord of the ascendant or 9th, the man has wearied him-
self, but to no purpose, f~>r he will never attain the know-
ledge he desires. If infortunes be in the $Jth, or its load
afBicted, the party has but little scientific knowledge.
The ) must also be observed with the lord of the 9th ;
for if they both apply to fortunes, the man is scientific; if
to infortunes, the contrary.
If the question be put regarding another person, you
must in this case give the ascendant for the quesited •.

The editor being·in company with two other artists, a
general desire was expressed to know the future destiny of
astrology, and the following figure was erected.

What will be the Destiny
of Astrology ?

JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE fiGURE.
The first thing to be observed in this figure is that ~ ,
the.natural significator of science, is lord of the 9th, and
is, therefore, the significator of the science of astrology.
He is found cadent, and almost peregrine, having no
essential dignity but his term, by which may be seen the
present enfeebled state of the science ; but as ~ has passed
through four degrees of his term in a fixed sign, this points
out, that for four years it has been in some measure more
in credit than previously. And this is the case, as it is
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 257
about four years since the Editor's publications began to
call attention to the science. And as ~ has just passed a
*of 'lf., who describes the person asking the question, it
is shewn that the science has been much benefited by such
a person, about nine months before, because ~ is past the
*of 1f. by 43', which shews' about nine months, taking
a degree for a year. And the fact is, that the Grammar
of Astrology was published about nine months before the
time of the question.
The ~ in the ascendant shews the difficulties the Editor
has had to encounter, and the contumely he has had to
meet in bringing the science forward again.
The presence of l} in the 9th, denotes the discredit in
'which the science is generally held; and being in 0 ·with
~, it. shews that injury has been done to it by elderly
females, who pretend to practise divining, &c., but who are
held in great contempt by the public, as may be seen by
the )) , (the general significator of the public), being in 8
to both ~ and l} , from the bouse of enemies to the
sc1ence.
The next aspect formed by ~ , is the *of 8 , who being
lord of the 11th house of the figure, and placed on the
cusp of the 11th from the 9th, denotes friends. This
shews, that in about four years from the time of the ques-
tion, the science will gain many friends among persons de-
noted by 8 in u, such as writers of public spirit, book-
sellers, &c. ; and there is no doubt that about that time it
will suddenly and rapidly gain ground in public opinion.
The next aspect formed by ~ , is the 8 of fA, from which
he is distant 14°; this may shew that some sudden mis-
chief may be done to the interests of the science by means
of female agents, as ~ is in exact sesquiquadrate aspect to
11 . But as fa( is retrograde, and not angular, this will not
be very important. The 0 is in the 12th from the 9th, and
s

258 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
denotes secret enmity to the science by men in poller. the
0 being in ~ ; and as he disposes of ~ , it shews that the
hand of power at present keeps it down. As ~ is ISO
from 0, I judge that, about tile year 18b2, some important
honour will be done the science; probably by the present
penal laws being repealed, which forbid the acceptance of
any remuneration for practising it. As ~ has 2()0 to pass
before he reaches 11Jt, his own dignities, and as J, will
then have entered n, and be disposed of by ~ , I judge
that about 20 years hence the science will be publicly
honoured ; and as V has afterwards ISO to pass in a com-
mon sign, (signifying months), I conceive that about 18
months after that, when f crosses the ctisp of the 9th
house in this figure, (about the year 1856), the science .
will rapidly rise in public estimation, and be publicly
studied in colleges, &.c.
The 0 enters 11Jt ~fter two years, as he is two degrees
off, which will cause the ruling powers to relax something
of their severity against the science ; and as. he then has
18°, (equal to 18 months, being in a common sign), to go
before he passes the cusp, there will be some person of rank
who will assist the science at that time; viz. three years
and a-half from the time of the question, or the year 1838.
The )) must now be considered ; she is hastening to 8
of two planets in the 9th, which shews that there is yet
much opposition to be expected to the science by the public,
and especially by rash and violent people, which ) in the
house of~ always denotes. But after the influence of the 8
of J, and~ is passed away, the]) meets nothing but favour-
able aspects. It is very rmoa1·kable that the }) is aspected by
every one of the pl~nets before she pas~es through'Y'. The
fil'o:~t aspect she forms after 8 of J, and ~ is *of 1f., which
denotes popularity for the works of the Editor, connected
with the science. The next is A of ~ , which shews an
Digitized by Google
I
f
I
INTRODUCTION TO .ASTROLOGY. 259
increase of stndents, and public discussion. The next is
* of 1, denoting increase of powerful friends, who will
boldly advocate the cause of the science. The * of fA is
of little import ; but the A of 0 being the last aspect she
forms before leaving the sign, decidedly shews that at last
the science will receive the highest patronage, and be pub-
licly honoured; and as 0 is in st., a fixed sign, this will be
permanent. Finally, the cusp of the 4th is in the term as
well as house of I, and is ruled by 0, by triplicity, and
face ; and0 casts a A thereto ; 1 , lord of the 4th, is in
cS with 1L in * to ~ and D, and A to T, and i ; and
he rules the ]) by house and face, and the 0 by face. All
these are decided testimonies, that in the end the cause of
truth shall triumph, and the reality and utility of thescience
be permanently established. ~ in a fixed sign, and so power- ·
fully aspected by T, , ~, 1 , (lord of the 4th, the house
denoting the end of the matter) i and ]) , is another strong
evidence that ASTROLOGY IS DESTINED TO FLOURJSH
WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES!
N. B. It is remarkable that ~ had just passed the *of
~, lady of the 2d, (or house of property), from the 9th,
and lady also of the lOth in the figure, ar.d 9th (bouse of
law) from the 9th. This shewed the recent benefit to
astrology, by the repeal of the law which taxed Almanacs,
and which greatly injured the science. It is also remarka-
ble, that 1(. will be exactly passing over the 2d degree of u ,
the cusp of the lOth (bouse of honour) from the 9th, about
the 7th February, 1835, when the last sheet of this work
will go through the press ; and at the same time T, will be
in .o. 230 !f, having just quitted the 9th house, where be
has injured the interests of the science.

south-east. And as 1(. was no way affticted and swift in
motion, as well as angular, I judged the man was alive and
in health. But as ~ , who disposes of 1(., is lord of his
8th, (viz. the 2d house), and as]) is so exceedingly aftlicted
by ~ and '& , I said he bad been in much danger and peril
of his life by treachery and plots of his adversaries; for If
is lord of the 7th from his ascendant, and }) of his 12th.
Moreover, 1(. is accidentally but not essentially fortified,
and is in his detriment, and near Oculus ts , a violent fixed
star; intimating that the man had endured many sudden
and violent chances.
Finding 1(. more fortified than )) , she almost entering
ts , a southern sign, and 1(. in u, a western sign, and south
quarter, I judged that the quesited was in the south-west
of England, in some barbour, as 1(. was angular.
When She should hear of Him, or see Him?
The }) separates from T, , and applies to If , the que-
rent's significator; shewing that after much expectation,
&c., she should bear of him, and in about three days, as
]) is so near If, and in a moveable sign, (and so she did).
But as If is in a moveable sign, and }) aftlicted by him and
lJ , the news she beard was false, for she beard that he was
in town; but it was not so. Considering that ~ and 1(.
hastened to a cS in u , " being therein very potent, and
that this was about the 5th May following, I judged that
she would about that time have certain news of her bus-
band, if he did not then come home. The second week in
May she did hear from him, but be did not come home till
July. He had been several voyages in the west, was taken
prisoner by the kiog's forces, and, at the time of the ques-
tion, was in Barnstaple.

we shall form our judgment, THAT POSTERITY KAY SEE
THAT THERE IS SOME VERITY IN AsTROLOGY.
The position of T, in the 9th, who is naturally of a se-
vere, surly, rigid, and harsh temper, may argue that Pres-
bytery will be too strict, sullen, and dogged for tbe English
constitutions; little gentle or compliant with the nature of
the community. And that there shall spring up among
themselves. many strange opinions and disti-nctions even,
concerning this very Presbytery ; that they shall grow ex-
cessively covetous, contentious, and desirous of more than
belongs to them; worldly, envious, and malicious one
against the other; that among them some juniors, repre-
sented by ~ •, shall be light in judgment, wavering, and
decline the strictness of their discipline; and that the
elders, represented by T, , shall not be respected on account
of their excessive rigidness, nor shall their orthodox opi•
nions be consented to.
Observe, that T, is peregrine, and supported by no fa-
vourable aspect of either fortune ; there is reception be-
tween ]) and him, but no aspect: ~ , lord of the lOth, sig-
nifying authority, is fast separating from T,, as if the gen-
try or 11upreme of the kingdom do already decline from the

severity of the austere Presbyterian clergy, fearing thraldom
rather than freedom to ensue from their power. ·
Three.whole years from hence shall not pass, ere autho-
rity itself, or some Divine Providence, will inform our judg-
ment with a way in discipline or government either nearer
to the former purity of the primitive times, or better beloved
of the whole kingdom of England; or authority shall in
this space of time moderate many things now strongly de-
sired. · For some time we shall not discover what shall be
established, but all shall be even as when there was no
king in Israel; a confusion among us shall yet awhile re-
main. The soldiery then, or some men of fiery spirits, will
arise, and keep back their contribution from the clergy,
and will deny obedience or submission to this thing called
Presbytery. It will then come to be handled by the ma-
gistracy, and the grand authority of the kingdom. Also,
by the plurality of the clergy, or men of sound judgment,
it will be contradicted, disputed against, disapproved; and
these shall make it manifest that this very Presbytery, now
maintained, is not the same that the commonwealth of
England will entertain as a standing rule to live under.
From what I find by this figure, I conclude tltat Pre8h!J-
tery shall not stand here in Engla11d•.
. • We have given this judgment at great length, as its complete
fulfilment, by the re-establishment of the Episcopal church, being a
matter of history, is a decisive proof of the truth of the science, and
of its ability to decide the most important questions hoth public and
private. The student will readily perceive that the prediction of the
downfall of the Presbyterian church, as far as regards England, is
made according to the strictest rules of the doctrines laid down by
our author.

would wholly destroy the querent'a hopes ; and that mer-
curial men, viz. scholars or divines, would be his enemies :
and as I found i in ~. opposing the ascendant, I judged
that some female would inform against him, or prejudice
him in his suit.
From all this I persuaded him against proceeding any
farther in the matter ; but the parson, being covetous,
would proceed, and did : and when he thought to have
success, behold a scurvy letter, revealing some unpleasant
truths concerning a female, dashed the good man'11 hopes,

The querent was T, and ~ exactly, had wit and volubi-
lity of tongue; and as ~ and ) were in 8 , he under the
earth, she in the 12th, he could never disco\'er which of his
neighbours it was that thus injured him; nor would he
ask me. If be had, it must have been T,, lord of the 12th,
viz., some farmer or dealer in cattle, a sickly, repining cha-
racter, living north-east, about fifteen furlongs, from him.

deavours.
Or if none of the significators be joined to the lord of

the lOth, yet if the lord of the ascendant or )) be in the
lOth, unaffiicted, he shall gain it; and also, if the lord of
the lOth be in the ascendant; and very easily, if the two
lords be going to a good aspect.
The lord of the lOth joined to 1t or ~ , an~ in the as-
cendant, he gains the office, &c., easily ; if joined to 11 or
I , and either of them in the ascendant, but well dignified,
it will be gained, but with difficulty.
The lord of the lOth receiving l> , or the lord of the 1st,
denotes success. And if there be translation of light from
the lord of the ascendant to the lord of the lOth, it denotes
that it will be gained by means of such a person as the
planet translating the light describes.
If the lord of the ascendant apply to cS of the lord of the
lOth, and there happen no previous abscission by any other
planet before the cS be complete, the querent will gain ~his
desire, but he must labour bard for it.
If any planets be in * or A to the lord of the lOth, or
the 0, let the querent make application to such persons as
they describe; for they may greatly bef1iend the querent
by means oftheir influence.
If the promising planet in any case be in an angle, the
matter will be readily completed; if in a succeedent, but
slowly; and if in a cadent, the affair goes backward at
times; but may, at last, be performed, if the planet be
otherwise well dignified.
If an evil planet behold )) or the ascendant by o or 8 ,
without reception mutual, he hinders the querent by means
of that person who is to solicit the cause, &c. for him.
The best sign of all is, when the two lords be joined to-
gether, and the ) separate from the lord of the lOth, and
apply to the lord of the ascendant ; but if she apply to
either, it is good.

268 INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY.
If the lord of the ascendant apply to good aspect of the
lord of the 4th, it denotes success ; but if the lord of the
4th be joined also to the lord of the lOth, the matter shall
be effected, but only after much delay and vexation.
Whether a Person shall remain in the Office he holds,
or not?
Observe whether the lords of the 1st and lOth be in tS ,
or any aspect; and note whether the more ponderous
planet of the two be in any angle but the 4th ; if so, he
shall not be removed. But if the heavy planet be in the
4th, or approaching it from the 5th, he will leave his office.
Yet, if there be reception between the two lords, he shall
recover it again ; and ifthe reception be mutual, be returns
speedily, and with more honour than before.
You may judge the same if the lord of the ascendant be
joined to a planet in the 3d or 9th, or to their lords, and
after separation be joined to a planet in. any angle, except
the 4th.
But if the two lords (of the 1st and lOth) separate from
each other, then be returns no more to his office, but loses
it entirely.
If the lord of the ascendant, or lOth, or the », are dis-
posed of by any planet in an angle, (except the 4th), and
that planet be slow in motion, be shall not be removed until
that planet be combust or retrograde, or leave the sign be
is in ; but much about that time be will be removed, un-
less some powerful aspects intervene.
If the }) be joined to the lord of the lOth, and be in the
lOth, the officer or governor, &c., shall not be removed.
If the lord of the ascendant, or », be joined to the lord
of the lOth, and he more weighty than either of them, and
in the lOth, 11th, or 5th houses, free from impediment,

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 269
though he behold not the lOth, the officer shall be trans-
ferred to some other place or office ; but if he behold the
lOth, he shall remain where he is.
Ifthe l> be joined to any planet not in his essential dig-
nities, though with reception, (unless it be 1{. or ~ by *
or ll. ), the querent shall leave his employment, office, &c.
If either the lord of the 4th, or l> , be in the 4th, and cv>,
!!Zi, <6, or Tf:f, be on its cusp, he will leave it; and this is
more certain if l> be then joined to the lord of the 4th, and
he peregrine. The same may be feared if ) be in Tf:f, and
affiicted, or if she be void of course, and the lord of the
ascendant be afBicted.
Whether a King expelled his Kingdom, or an Officer having
lost· his Place, shall he restored?
The ascendant and its lord are for the querent, be he
king, duke, or gentleman, &c. Observe, that if the lord of
the 1st be in tS with the lord of the lOth, and the mo.y
ponderous planet behold the lOth house, then the king or
ruler, &c., shall be restored.
If the planet do not behold the lOth house, observe whe-
ther ]) be joined to any planet in the ascendant, or lOth•
which also will denote his restoration. If ]) be in cv>, e,
6, or 1f:f, he returns the sooner. If the lord of the lOth
be joined to a planet in the lOth, or the 0, (but not by tS
to 0 ), it denotes the same. The lord of the lOth a lighter
planet than the lord of the 4th, and separated from him,
argues the same.
If the lord of the lOth be lighter than the lord of the
ascendant, and be joined to him, he shall return to his
office, &c. So also, if ]) be joined to the lord of the lOth,
and behold the lOth house, unless disposed of by a pere-
grine planet under the earth.

Consider the lords of the ascendant and lOth, and the

employment. Observe which of the two ( 3 or i) is the
most powerful, and note the sign be may be in; also con-
sider the four angles, and any planet in them. If they be
in fiery signs, or the majority of them, (viz. 3, i, the
planet in an angle, and the cusps of anglet~, especially the
lOth), and 3 have any dignity in the place of the lord of
the lOth, or the 0, say the querent will make a good
tradesman, &c. in any business where fire is used, or of its
nature; and if the lord of the lOth be in his exaltation, be
will do well in serving the king, or any high nobleman, &e.
Ifthe significator of the employment, (usually the lord of
the lOth, or a planet, especially 3 or i, in the lOth, near
the cusp), be in ¥, weak, he will make a good cattle-dealer,

cattle, in a respectable way.
If the significator be in M, then husbandry will best
suit him ; or gardening, com-dealing, grazing, &c. ; or if
~ be the significator, such things as appertain to women's
affail·s, a soap-boiler, fuller of cloth, scowerer, &c.
If the significator be in n, he will make a writer, clerk,
bailiff, &c., or a surveyor, painter, astro'nomer, astrologer,
geometer, schoolmaster, &c.
If he be in 2D, be will be fitted for a variety of occupa-
tions; but he will be likely to go to sea, or to deal in liquids,
such as wines, beer, &c. ; and he will be fond of political
distinction.
Ifhe be in &t, be will make a good horse-jockey orcoach-
man; a smith, watchmaker, glassblower, huntsman, or
cow-doctor; or to do with any trade which uses fire.
If in "..t, he will make a good secretary to a person in
.power, a schoolmaster, accountant, stationer, printer; he
will be an excellent politician, or be a good astrologer, &c.
If in 6, he will be a good poet or orator; singer, or

The lord of the 11th in an angle, received by the lord
of .the ascendant, you may judge in the affirmative.
If the receiver of the » be in a common sign, judge
that he shall have but part of the thing hoped for. If in
a moveable sign, he shall have but a little, a mere sign of
the thing; but if the receiver be in a fixed sign, he shall
have the whole or complete thing. Yet, if the receiver of
) be unfortunate, the matter shall get some injury or burt,
&c. after he is in possession of it.
If there be mutual reception between the receiver of the

he looked for. And if the lord of the ascendant be also
received, he shall obtain whatsoever be hoped for, that is
feasible or possible.
If the querent's signi6cator' or J> apply to a fortune, not

Good planets in the 11th, or Q there, or good aspects
between the lords of the 11th and ascendant, denote the
friends of the querent to be sincere ; and if they throw
good aspects to the cusp of the 2d house, its lord, or $,
it denotes gain thereby. Evil planets, and evil aspects in
like manner, denote false friends and losses. The lord of
the 12th in the 11th, denotes a secret enemy under the
. guise of f1·iendship. ~ in the 11th, shews wavering, un-
steady friends, unless he be in a fixed sign.

OF THE TWELFTH HOUSE, AND ITS QUESTIONS, VIZ.
OF IMPRISONMENT, GREAT CATTLE, PRIVATE ENE-
MIES, BANISHED MEN, &c.
IF a question be asked regarding secret enemies, who
are not named, observe the lord of the 12th, and planets
therein, how they aspect the lord of the ascendant, and
from what houses, &c. If the lord of the 12th behold the
lord of the ascer.dant from the 6th, 8th, or 12th, or from
the 4th, 7th, or lOth, then there are some who privately
wish ill to the querent.
1'o know who a private Enemg is.
Observe how the lord of the 12th is affected, and
whether he be with good or evil planets, and how he be-
hold the lord of the ascendant. If he be in the 6th, or
joined to its lord, it shews the secret enemy is afflicted
with some secret disease or malady ; if the lord ofthe 6th
be in the 12th, he is also sickly. If the lord of the 12th
be in the 10th, or with its lord, he is in favour with the
king or some person of rank ; and if he be strong, it will
not be well for the querent to meddle with him, especially
if he aspect the lord of the ascendant or » by 0 or 8 • If
the lord of the 12th be with the lord of the 4th or 8th, or
in those houses, he is sickly or near dying, or is repining,
and very miserable. Consider and judge farther, as in
former cases directed.
Whether a Person committed to Prison sl1all be discharged?

relation the quesited hears to the querent. If ]) be swift in

.A. yoa judge by D. judge also by the lord of the aaeeod-
ant. Bat these aspects most be by application. I
The lords of the angles being in angles, is an ill testi-
mony ; and so much the worse if the lord of the ascend-
ant be in the 4th, or if either be or the lord of the 12th
dispose of each other. It is still worse if the lord of the
ascendant be disposed of by a planet in an angle, especially
a malefic ; and worst of all if that malefic be in the 4th ;
and if be be the lord of the 8th, he may expect to die in
prison. The ) disposed of by the lord of the 12th, or
any malefic, is a sign of a long stay ; and it is still worse,
if her dispositor be in an angle, and especially in the 4th.
If, however, the disposing planet be in a moveable sign, or
swift in motion, it shortens the time ; but a retrograde
planet shews a long detention. If the lord of the ascend-
ant, or ) , be combust, it shews a long imprisonment.
The )) and f in moveable signs, when If is lord of the
ascendant, shews speedy eolargement, especially if they
aspect a fortune. If 1f. ascend, or be in 6 with ) , or ~
be in the aacendant in cS with ) , or f be in 6 with 1f.,
and aspect tbe ) , or ) apply to 1f. or ~ 1 he will be dis-

same.

INTRODUCTION TO ASTROLOGY. 2'/7
If at the time of being taken, or of the question, a fixed
sign ascend, or the }), or lord of the ascendant, be in a
fixed sign, or in )(, it denotes long imprisonment. The
same if a fixed sign be on the 12th, or its lord be angular,
and in a fixed sign. The }), or lord of the 1st, in ~ or n.,
and in 8 to 1, shews danger of being slain by the sword,
or by quarrelling; if in 8 to f7 , it shews irons or severe
punishments. (If it be an ordinary prisoner, these may
shew eickness, want, and ill-treatment, or accident, &.c.)
An infortune in =, shews a long imprisonment. If the
lord of the ascendant be in his fall or detriment, and the ])
in =, the same ; also the )) , or lord of the 1st, in the 8th
or 12th. If ) apply to a fortune, and the lord of the
ascendant and the cusp of the ascendant be fortunate,
it denotes liberation.
Note.- i is better than '1{. in this question, especially
if in aspect to ~ or }). If }) be with f7 , and '1{. behold
them by o , and I by A, it denotes that, after a long con-
finement and suffering, he shall break prison and escape.

the ascendant, he shall escape, (the ancients declare),
within a month; if ~ , within 40 days ; if ~ , he has long
imprisonment; if ]) , his state will depend on and change
according as she has applications with other planets; if f7 ,

wherein we find }) •
All of them considered, they signify, unanimously, that
the prisoner would go eastward, or full east, (and so he
did). The closeness of ]) to the ascendant shewed that he
~ was not yet out of town, or, at least, that he could not be
far from town. And as 1f. was in the 8th, I judged that
he lay obscure for awhile, viz. a night; but that then he
would go away, (which lte did).

I confidently affirmed, that he should be taken again by
some man of authority; for J> separated from 4 of 'lf., his
significator, and applied to 8 of(!), both in angles. It
never fails, but that if the ]) , or the significator of a
fugitive, be afBicted by an unfortunate planet in the 7th
house, that fugitive, or prisoner, is again taken. In the
next place, I found 'lf. and ~ in *, ~ in his own house,

much to do with his qualities, being lord of )(, an inter-
cepted sign in the ascendant.
I first considered that the }) separated from a A of l} ,
and applied to a 0 of 3, lord of his house of substance,
assistants, &c., and also of the 9th, his house of journeys.
This intimated he should have but slender success. and
lose much by his present march. Finding rJ in the ascend-
ant, I judged that he would be betrayed in bis councils ;
and seeing J, , lord of his ascendant, peregrine, and in his
fall in the 2d, the }) in her detriment. and E9 disposed of by
~, lord of his 7th, signifying his enemies, and that 'lf., the
general sigoificator of wealth, casts a 0 to the ascending
degree, I gave this judgment :-that his Excellency must
expect no success from this employment; that he would
have no honour by the journey; that be would be extremely
crossed by men of great power here at London, who pre-
tended great friendship to him ; ( 'lf., lord of the lOth and
llth, being in 0 to his ascendant), that he would be be-
trayed wholly, and be in danger to lose all; that, in short,
I was extremely sorry he had chosen so unlucky a time to
set forth, &c. &c.
The issue was thus, (for I write to posterity): he prosper-
ed in the beginning, and daily men of good quality and
authority jeered at me, and derided my prediction. I was
quite content to be abused, provided that he might have
had success. But observe, that, on the 8th September
following, came sad news, that on the 2d of September
this wort~y man had surrendered all his ammunition to his
majesty, having only quarter for his soldiers; with some
other articles, which were dishonourably performed, to the
eternal shame of the royal party.

Here we find J, peregrine, and retrograde in the ascend-
ant, a decided testimony of ill success ; the ~ is also
ascending, a sign of evil and treachery to the King. His
second house is afflicted by 8 , who is in his detriment, and
disposed of by ~,the significator of his adversaries. The
King's EB is afBicted by & of 8, and by o of ~, having
only the *of~, who is retrograde, and in 8 to 0, the joint
significator of his foes. Then we find the ascendant in 8
to ~ , the significator of the enemy; and also the »in o
to the 0, cadent and peregrine. Each one of his signifi-
cators is afflicted, and '11., the lord of the 11th, his house
of hopes, and of the lOth, the house of honour, and dis-
positor of l> , is afflicted by the 8 of 0, by being retro-
grade, and by being within orbs of a & of f. , lord of the
12th, the house of disgrace and misfortune.
Now as regards the adversary, we find 0 and ~ both
ruling the 7th, and placed therein in mutual reception, 0
being in the house of ~ , and t1 in the house of 0 . The
g is also in the 7th, and ~ lady of their 2d, or house of
substance and means, assistants, &c., is strong in her own
house .a:, angular, and no way afflicted.
The general significator of war, 8, is in his detriment,
and is disposed of by ~, a benefic in the 7th. The lord
of the adversaries lOth, or house of honour, is ~ , and he
is in reception mutual with the G, angular, and no way
impedited, except being retrograde ; and he is in the term I
of ~, and 8 is in his term; another mutual reception. c

All these things were decided testimonies that his Majesty
should fail in all his endeavours, and eventually be ruined.

the c11,use of hid misfortunes. The lord of the 12th, (house
of imprisonment) being in the ascendant, shewed that he
should be imprisoned ; the more so from his being in )(.
And history tells us how truly the " signs of heaven"
spoke on this occasion ; for " all the remainder of his life,
after this August 22<1, 1642, was a mere labyainth of sor-
row ; a continued and daily misfortune."
The student will perceive that his death was plainly
foreshewn by the }I applying to * of ~,lady of the 8th,
or house of death, from signs of long ascension; in which a
*, it is said, has the same effect as a 0 in other signs.
The ) moreover is with Antares, a violent fixed stnr, (now
in about 7° 30' t ) which is said to denote a violent death;
which is farther shewn by the 0 of ]) to 0, the latter be-
ing in an angle. The lord ot the 4th being in 8 to the
ascendant, was also a token of his death ; and perhaps lfl
being in the 8th, and ~ , its ruler, approaching Caput Al-
gol, which is said to denote beheading, might intimate
that; but all such minute points must be left to posterity
to decide, when the science will be better understood.
The hour of the King's death was 4h..4m. P . M., 30th
January, 1648-9, when the heavens were as represented in
the following figure. The student will see that T, , lord of
the ascendant in this figure, had exactly gained the 0
aspect of the 0 at that time, being in n 90 25'; and that
0 was just transiting the ascendant of this figure; and
that the cusp of the lOth (which denoted the King) is there
the place of T, in this figure. The ]) is in the 29th de-
gree of "'.f, a 0 aspect to the cusp ofthe 8th, in this also;
and 'lf., part lord of the ascendant here, is in cS with the
place of ~ , lady of the 8th. All these coincidences must
be considered by the genuine searcher after truth as strong
evidences of the truth of planetary influence, as evinced in

the mad attempt of this unhappy King to make war upon
the nation were here plainly depicted ; and it is for the
opponents of astrology to shew, that these things are
merely accidental coincidence, or the fruit of cha11ce, the
deity they so fondly worship.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE ABOY£ FIGURE.
King Charles I was born at Dumfernline, in Scotland,
about fifteen miles from Edinburgh, on the 19th Novem-
ber, 1600; at which time 0 was in 90 of t. Hence, at
the period of his death, 1i was exactly in 8 to the place
of 0 at his birth, and ~ nearly in 0 to that place.

INTRODUC'fiON TO ASTROI.OGY. 287
The 8 of J, to 0 will ever be found to bring trouble,
sorrow, disgrace, and often death, to the native. It will
be seen that at the time of the King's setting.up his stand-
ard at Nottingham, the 0 was exactly transitting the 0
of his own place at birth ; a decided cause of failure, dis-
credit, &c. But although we mention these circumstances,
we would remind the student that such transits can have
but little effect unless evil directions be operating at the
time ; which, there can be no doubt, was the case in the
nativity of the unfortunate and ill-advised King Charles
the First.
If we regard this figure as that of the exact commence-
ment of the CoMMONWEALTH, we shall find that it will
point out the result of that change in the government, as it
would of any otlrer thing which might then have co_m-
menced.
The }) is lady of the aaceodant, and she is in her detri-
ment and peregrine; hence the Commonwealth was not
successful : her being in a moveable sign, and moveable
signs on the ascendant and 7th, and such signs intercepted
in the other two angles, shewed that it would not be per-
manent. The lord of the 4th being also lord of the 12th,
shewed that it would come to an end by means of the exer-
tions of its secret enemies ; and as J, is also lord of the
7th, and rules the ) , it shewed that its enemies would over-
throw it at length. The end of it was clearly pointed out
to be when ) came to cS of the lord of the 4th, ~ , and to
the 6. in signs of short ascension of the lord of the 8th, J, ,
who is very powerful, as being in reception with ~, and

Q • lf we calculate from the place of the }) to the 6. of
J, , we shall find eleven degrees and a quarter, which would
be equivalent to elevetl years and a quarter; which, it is
well known, was THE EXACT DURATION OF THE CoM-

APHORISMS, BY ZADKIEL.
1st, In all cases of hearing rumours or reports, receiving
letters or messages, &c., if you erect a figure for the
exact minute of bearing or reading the news, &c., the
lord ofthe 3d in good aspect with the cusp of the ith, or
a planet in the 7th, shews that the news is true, and that
you are not deceived: if he be in evil aspect, either
semi-square, o. sesquiquadrate, or 8 , the news is false.
2d, Whenever any person applies to another on any busi-
ness whatever, .either by letter, message, or personally,
the 1st house represents him who is the first mover in the
matter, who either goes or sends to the other, and the
7th represents the person applied to. Therefore~ when
a person reads a report in a newspaper, or elsewhere, the
7th shews that person, because the report, &c. comes, as
it were, to him.
3d, If you apply to a person for goods of any kind, anc.l
they are promised, the application of the lord of the 2d
· to the lord of the 8th, or a planet therein, shews the time
when they will be received.
4th, If you receive a bill of exchange,. the figure for that
time will shew whether it will be paid. If ED receive a
good aspect of the lord of the 1st, it will be paid; but if
ED receive any evil aspect of the lord of the 1st, it will not
be paid. Prohatum est.
5th, The ~ always denotes moneg, whether in cash or
bills; but propertg, whether in goods or lands, houses,
&c., is always shewn by the lord of the 2d, or a planet
therein.

APPENDIX.
EXPLANATION OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS.
Tn E first of.these curious cuts, which have been exactly
copied from our author's tract, entitled '' Monarch!/ or
no Monarch!/ in England," is intended to represent a great
mortality, in which the vast number of deaths should so
far exceed the supply of coffins, that the dead must needs
be buried in their shrouds, or merely stitched up in sheets,
&c., as therein rudely represented.-The second cut is an
Astrological Hieroglyphic, as may be understood by the
horoscope being introduced therein ; and the two children
or twins are intended to represent the sign Gemini, which,
in astrology, is known to rule London; and the twins are,
therefore, intended to denote that city. Their fallir.g head-
long into the fire, describes the extensive injury to be done
to London by that element fifteen years afterwards. The
manner in which this was foreseen by the author bas been
explained in our remarks on his life.
These two Hieroglyphics, even if there bad been only
these, whereas there were several others equally pointing
out future events, published with them, would ever remain
undeniable monuments of our author's skill, and of the
substantial truth of the science of astrology.

If}? be significator, the querent is extremely unfortunate,
and generally sickly and unhappy, dejected, and oppressed
by men in power. He is rash and violent, subject to burns
and scalds, and has frequently some defect in the eyes;
and if the cS happen near the Hyades, PLeiades, or Prttspe,
he is likely to be nearly blind. If the J> be applying, he is
in danger of death, especially if it happen in the 8th house,

~ o or 8 ]) .
If ~ be significator, it no doubt gives some abilities, but
such persons are too unsettled to apply very closely to any
subject; they are continually shifting their situations, (espe-
cially if ~ be in a moveable sign), nor are they very sin-
cere in their professions of friendship, nor very scrupulous
in the method by which they may attain their ends.
If }) be significator, they have a defect in their utter-
ance, have but little ability, except a kind of low cunning,
which they apply to dishonest purposes. But as ~ is
acted on by every planet having an aspect to him, it will be
necessary to observe each aspect, and allow for its influ-
ence ; for if ~ have a b of '1f., the o of ~ to ) will not
be near so evil, though the person will be far from sensible,
notwithstanding that .they are tolerably honest and well-
meaning.
0BsERVATION.-The student must always remember,
that the true character and condition of the person signified
can only be correctly learned by noticing all the aspects the
significator may receive, as well as observing the nature of
the sign and house it is in, and the degree of strength or
weakness it possesses, as well as those planets which
aspect it. Thus, if the significator be 8 , and he receive
the 8 of 0, yet if 0 be weak, and 8 have also a 6. of
'lf., this benefic planet being strong, he may judge that the
querent will suffer by the evil infl-
uence of 0, by receiving
asevere wound in a duel, or in honourable warfare; whereas
• -if, instead of the 6. of '1f., the o of ~ occurred, there
would be little doubt that he would be killed by police offi-
cers, or die by the hand of the public executioner; the latter
especially, if0 was in the lOth house.

1st, If the right ascension be less than 1800, it is north;
and if it be more than 1800, it is south.
2d, To the logarithm co-ta11gent of the declination add
the logarithm sim of the right ascension, measured from
¥ or ~ ; but if measured from 2D or ";f·, the logarithm co-
sine: the sum, (minus 10 in the Index), will be the !Cig•.
tangent of the angle A.
3d, If the right ascension and declination be both north,
or both south, add 23° 28' to angle A,· and it will give
angle B.
4th, If the right ascension and declination be one north
and the other south, the difference between 230 28' and
angle A will give angle B.
Note.-If angle B exceed 000, the latitude will be of the
contrary name to the declination; but if angle B be less
than 90°, the latitude will be of the same name as the de-
clination.

A.spect.-The being placed at certain distances from a
planet, or the cusp of a house : as, if 11- be 60 degrees
from ) , then they are both said to be in sertile aspect

former are when any planet is in its own house, exalta-
tion, triplicity, term or'face; the latter are, when any
planet is in an angle, and well aspected, not afllicted,
swift in motion, increasing in light, &c. The reverse
of dignities are debilities.
Direct.-When any planet moves on in the regular order
of the signs, from ¥ towards ~ , &c• .
Direction.-The calculating the arc between two heavenly
bodies, &c. It is a term chiefly used in nativities.
Dispose, Dispositor.-A planet disposes of any other which
may be found in its essential dignities. Thus, if 0 be
in ¥, the house of ~ , then ~ disposes of 0, and is
said to rule, receive, or govem him. When the disposi-
tor of the planet signifying the thing asked after is
himself disposed by the lord of the ascendant, it is a
good sign. To dispose by house is the most powerful
testimony; then by exaltation, then triplicity, then term,
and lastly, face, which is a very weak reception.

houl!e.

note that the match would take place; but if ~ were to
form an 8 of 8 before ~ reached her L:l. of that
planet, it would be a frustration ; and would shew that
the hopes of the querent would be cnt off; and if ~

and the figure of the heavens for that tilne is taken to
judge the result. The word hora appears to be derived
from the Egyptian name for the Sun, which Herodotus
informs us was Horus or Orus; the Hebrew or, lux,
light, or day, and oriens, eastern, all appear to have had
,the same origin. The Budhists call the Sun Hint,
which, with its Braminical name also, appears equally to
have been derived from Egypt, the first cradle of astro-
logy.

it is more generally a term for the figure of the heavens
used by astrologers for predicting by nativities, mundane
astrology, and horary questions.
