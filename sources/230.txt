  The original idea of a Union Spirite was raised in December 1882 at the suggestion of P.G. Leymarie, and had as its journal the Revue scientifique et morale du spiritisme under the editorship of Gabriel Delanne.  The Union was revived after World War One by Leon Chevreuil and Jean Meyer and started the Bulletin in 1921, not as a competitor of the Revue scientifique et morale and of the Revue Spirite and the other French journals of the time, but as an attempt at a non-partisan clearing house of information on Kardec's spiritism around France and internationally. The Union Spirite sought to associate in its work the various other spiritist and psychical research groups, mainly French, and reported monthly on the meetings of the Union in an effort to unify the scattered spiritist groups by demonstrating a rational way of organizing, to bring to members' attention noteworthy relevant publications and works around the world, and to teach methods of developing mediumship that the Union had proved and found worthwhile.  The initial governing committee of the Union included Delanne, Meyer, Leon Denis, and other notable French spiritists.  From 1929, the Bulletin had a Supplement au Bulletin de l'USF, beginning in April/May 1929.
