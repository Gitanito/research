Inspiration
Summarizing its Qualifications
and Precepts.
Herein lies the requirements for inspiration, sum
marizing of its qualifications.
A soul pure and free from transgressions of divine
law.
A character spotless and undefiled —with charity
and justice for all. Untainted by prejudice, jealousy
or malice. Then a soul is free to travel out into
space, there to contact master minds in the universal
and to gather the fruits of Divine Inspiration, and
illumination.
Thy feet will be planted upon the rock of Gibraltar
and Thy soul free to glean knowledge and wisdom
from the Seers and Sages of all ages.
Becoming Thy own preceptor, to glean, to inspire,
to shout the glad Hosanna and place Thy arms of love
around the world; this is living as the angels live.
Then the light that shines from Thy face, will be as
no earthly light of the sun ; but the light of righteous
ness, through a Christ developed consciousness, the
great white light of God. Supreme then is Thy joy,
and Divine is this awakening.
HOPE
Anticipation is cherishing a desire for good and in
citing into action, the Divine inflow of inspiration,
for it lures one onward to fuller realization of the
great source of supply that lies within, waiting for
expression. It requires this dynamic force, to keep
inspired to hope on and keep the ardor of the mind
keen for the desire to live, be and do, for when hope
is dead, life is a shallow mockery.

8 INSPIRATION
Should the fires of hope burn low, the vibrations
are necessarily lowered also. It cannot be otherwise,
for life energy is at a low ebb.
Keep faith with your God and the finer forces sur
rounding you.
Trust and obey, this unlocks the reservoir of spirit
ual activities and permits the flood-gates of wisdom to
flow. This is spiritual reality. It keeps hope and
courage fanned into a bright yellow glow. It inspireo
one onward in daily life; to vision the beauties that
are theirs. Then does one vision as through glasses
clear and sparkling, all nature with its secrets revealed,
keeping a soul IN-AT-ONE-MENT with the cosmic
life forces of energizing and utilizing power.
Cosmic energy acts according to the quality and
power in which one is conscious. We cannot deny
this simplification of TRUTH in God's divine power,
for its elevating, harmonizing and strengthning vibra
tions keeps the mind clarified. Then one can re
ceive inspiration from higher intelligences from
out the great realms of souls in the universal. For
this power manifests and inspires to the exact propor
tion and quality of ones mental pattern, or power to
conceive truth. Guiding the disciple's steps on nature's
path through soul culture and the esoteric laws of life.
When a mind is renewed and lifted to the realms of
the spiritual and true, the outer affairs and relations
with others will adjust themselves accordingly.
Emerson says great men are they, who see that
spiritual is stronger than any material force, that
thought rules the world. . . .
WHAT IS INSPIRATION?
Inspiration may mean high or low, good or evil, the
ascending or decending in rates of vibration.
Inspiration comes from the latin "inspiro," mean
ing to inbreathe, or draw in. It is the faculty of be:

ing able to do great things in life and to speak, or
■write inspirationally.
One draws inspiration from the great all pervading
cosmic power by trust and faith. Being keyed to plains
of vibratory activity in quality to ones own great soul
development and becoming absolutely receptive to
God's great light that never faileth, those who are
willing to walk in this light forever.
Jesus said seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven and
its righteousness and all things will be added unto you.
The author in a previous volume (ON THE PATH)
has explained to you, where you discover this Heaven,
and what you are obliged to do to keep it constantly
near. For all the way to Heaven is Heaven, when we
manifest God in our outer life, for then we are in tune
and in touch with universal supply which means suc
cess.
In this affirmation Jesus said all things will be
added, He places no side issues—stipulations nor limi
tations upon the supply.
BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF POWER
First become conscious of Thy own great power;
this must act in harmony with Divine law. Recognize
the soul center that lies within. Awaken it to greater
consciousness. Enter a sacred shrine of silence, for
silence is the gate way to divine consciousness. For
meditation, concentrate upon peace and poiver, draw
ing through the magnetic law of attraction, a greater
supply of energy and force. Building a more master
ful and holy sanctuary for Thy great spirit, for
through meditation a student of truth is able to
form higher ideals on all three planes of life, physi
cally, mentally and spiritually. Then does one recog
nize the inspiration and touch of the higher forces
of power, infilling them with INSPIRATION and faith.
For Divine power is then acting in co-operation and

harmony with the power within. For as we seek we
find—knock and the door shall be opened unto you
revealing to the mystic student the Kingdom of
Heaven.
Make practical demonstrations of this principle by
assisting humanity, praying constantly for still deeper
enlightenment and greater truth to surround them.
Keeping in this attitude of mind one can touch the
universal wellspring of power and your own will come
to you.
This great hidden power, and force can be compared
to a great ocean liner, it's motion is slow, steady and
rythmic, Gradually it gathers force and power, as it
gets farther away from shallow water, out into deeper
waters of the great ocean, until it reaches the outer
harbor, then it sails forth under its own power, in its
majestic grandeur over bounding billows and swelling
tides undisturbed. Conquered by the mighty power
and force within the hull yet all unseen, does the hid
den power carry it on its journey. Just as an awaken
ed soul when working in conformity with divine law
can master conditions and circumstances. Sailing out
on life's stormy sea, with their own safe pilot; their
own great developed soul attuned to God's love and
wisdom.
How true then these lines of Ella Wheeler Wilcox,
where one can trace different modes and grades of
inspiration.
"One ship sails east, and one sails west, by the self-same
wind that blows."
"It's the set of the sail and not the gale, that determines
the way it goes."
"Like the winds of the sea, are the ways of life, as we
journey on through life. It's the set of the soul, that determines
the goal and not the stress nor the strife."
It depends upon the vibrations surrounding the soul ;
how deep and Pure the Inspiration, how marvelous the
revelations of light. If buffeted about by seeming
fate (but is only the workings of Divine Law) the in

spiration is at a low ebb. If the Watchman is in the
tower room, nothing can enter but enobling thoughts
and high ideals. In Divine consciousness listen, for
God is speaking the Kingdom of Heaven is within.
This is the Golden Key that opens Freedom's Door.
SET OF THE SAILS
The set of the sails will guide the destiny of each
soul into pastures green, where verdure fruitage of the
spirit will be their Divine heritage.
When one finally determines to follow through calm
placid waters, the soul's higher and by far richer ideals
of communication, then they with versatility sense
the ever growing fruits of Divine Inspiration bubbling
forth from their developed soul, well attuned and
equipped with implements of service. Thus prepared
with sails firmly set, careing not which way the wind
of fate may blow. To go forth into God's illustrious
vineyard1, to enjoy the fruitage of the spirit, lead and
guided by His loving messengers of service, into the
temple of Divine Wisdom.
SEEKING THE KINGDOM
For he that would love life, and see good days, let
him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they
speak no guile, and let him turn away from evil—and
do good. Let him seek peace and pursue it, for the all-
seeing eye of God, is upon the righteous. —1 Peter
3:10-11.
When seeking this Kingdom of Heaven within, you
touch the artists of the spiritual spheres, in music,
song, art, speaking, writing and act, but to contact
this force, remember to first prepare thy self, by going
into silent meditation for inner introspection of the
mental, closing out all material thoughts, there to look
within, asking for strength and Divine Power to guide
you. For there are many pitfalls and! temptations, it

is for the soul to learn to discriminate, as they evolve
on the path. They will know when developed in Divine
consciousness.
Go alone into thy closet for the power within, to
contact the power without, be not conceited with the
idea that you and you alone are doing all the work, for
you alone do nothing. There is always some force,
may we call it a good angel with you to help and to
inspire you onward for good and the reverse, if one's
vibration is low enough for the reverse to contact you.
This is where one needs to pray for Divine Light, wis
dom and self mastery, constantly and for strength to
be over-comers.
Ask and ye shall receive. Seek for the highest, live
your life thoroughly and well, if desirous of obtaining
best results, with success on all planes of life. Sail on
nothing daunted with mental house-cleaning, often
useing the Christ vacuum of power and you will keep
happy and sweet. Here you can demonstrate God's
Divine healing power, when the mental is sailing on
a smooth sea, with poise and rhythm of body and mind.
God then is in the watch tower and the vibrations
are filled with chemicalized thoughts of purity with
mental color waves, becoming impervious to mental
attacks of outside forces, then our thoughts can cre
ate noble aspirations and be inspired and clothed in
divine love with Him who gives us life.
STEPPING STONES TO THE CHRIST
The soul's vague longings are gratified when touched
by Divine Inspiration. There is no finality known in
Inspiration for it is manifested through all forms of
conscious life. Through music, poetry, religions, sci
ences of moral justice and through all forms of art,
there is inter-woven the Inspiration of seers and sages
of the ages past.
When one is touched by Divine Inspiration, it takes
the inspired soul up to the Mount of Transfiguration.

INSPIRATION 13
In this state of realization the windows of the soul are
clarified, then it is a natural consequence that Inspir
ation becomes obedient through the law of attraction.
ALONE WITH GOD
Jesus gained his greatest power and Inspiration
alone with God. Sometimes upon Mount Olive, or in
a beautiful valley. As all great thinkers of today,
realize the need of solitude, when in need of all their
mental powers. Although they may be ignorant of
nature's laws, yet are they conscious of receiving in
spiration and strength through this stilling of the
storms of the outer life.
In hours of abstraction and contemplation, one is fill
ed with gracious and beautiful thoughts, that take
one from the world of sense, into the Heavenly king
dom of peace and at-one-ment of the Divine Father.
Only those who have touched this well-spring of
inspiration, have wintessed the exhiliration that
comes from this Divine contact.
Under this inspired consciousness one is able to
observe the defects in their own character, likewise
define it in the lives of other mortals. The faculties
are keyed or attuned, to the higher and immortalized
forces of nature. Touching these divine forces it
arouses and kindles into greater action the hidden
powers of our being. Thus one feels in these exalted
moments of thought, a calm inward hallowedness and
in-breathing from the magnanimous and rhythmic
beatings of the soul of nature.
ONENESS WITH GOD
This is where one comes into the realization of their
oneness with God. For then all nature is so hallowed
and sacred, one catches glimpses of immortal truth.
This is illumination where we touch the power behind
the throne realizing that God is everywhere present

and / am one with this all omnipresent consciousness
of God and cosmic life.
One cannot at all times receive the highest inspira
tion for they are not always in tune with the infinite,
though there are certain times, when one is attuned
to spiritual things. Then they vibrate upward in
celestial sphere where one sees, thinks and feels in
the vibration of harmonious at-one-ment with God
and man.
Here the inflow of Divine thoughts reach the soul
and one can then receive the arts of the Heavenly
spheres as they rise into the atmosphere of Christ
consciousness, where virture, love and faith become
largely significant and magnified. Where one speaks
in the language of angels and the breezes of their love
are wafted forth, in exchange to the outer world.
What comfort and consolation, to forget in these
moments the atmosphere and vibration of our present
earthly surroundings and live for even a short
space of time in the glory of Divine and Heavenly
bliss, of etheric vibration that needs no verbal utter
ance ; yet at times the great overflow of the soul's clar
ified vision commands the words of knowledge and
wisdom to flow.
INSPIRED ARTISTS
Beethoven and Mozart, these great musical geniuses
poured forth their strains of music without effort or
previous thought, through inspiration.
In speaking of the great painter of wisdom —like
Raphael and his wonderful paintings, we discover he
was fully conscious of his power of inspiration in his
gifted work for he tells us his "whole work is accomp
lished as if he were in a pleasant dream."
Then others failing to realize their great ambition in
their waking moments, oft-times obtain their greatest
ideals and inspirations through impressions in sleep
or in dreams.

INSPIRATION 15
Mozart told of his great gifts and how he received in
inspirational moments, tells us when the melodies fell
unbidden upon his soul, "That all his feelings and com
positions would go on with-in him as a lively and
delightful dream."
Then Beethoven, who is claimed the greatest of all
musicians, whose soul was tuned to musical ecstasy,
confessed "to an over-mastering power" the rhythmic
harmonies of angels. In his inspired language, he
says, "I must live with myself alone. I well know
God! and the angels are nearer to me in my art than the
others. I commune with them without dread."
TRUTH INSPIRES
Today people are beginning to realize more forcibly
than ever before where their inspiration comes from.
For God constantly inspires in various forms, souls
who are attuned' to the highest standard of Divine
Living in the material world, for one is constantly
sensing either high or low vibrations, for the latter
can bring a very low grade of inspiration; this is a
deplorable fact but let our conjecture be only of
the Diviner sort.
It is a true saying—no star continually courses in
the same orbit. A soul is constantly changing. As
the vibrations change up or down the scale, the soul
is drawn by the currents of harmony or inharmony.
In moments when one is touched by deep and pure
inspiration, at this time one is filled with love for the
world, we care not where it comes from, we only care
to know it is renewing our being and causing night
to turn into day and Heaven to shine in our midst.
Jesus scourged the money changers "compared them
to swine, to thieves and robbers." Was it not the
gentle Jesus who blessed the little ones and' said to
the woman, "Neither do I condemn Thee, go and sin
no more." His vibrations were entirely changed.

16 INSPIRATION
The Diviner nature was quickened. Feeling the one
ness with the Father in Heaven.
When seeing the money changers, corrupting the
holy temple, His soul was torn asunder. For a moment
He rebelled at the injustice of man, against the laws
of God and His precepts.
"When desiring to receive the higher form of in-
spiriaion, it is necessary to raise the consciousness
upon higher plains of thought. The scales of our be
ing must be brought up into perfect balance, aspiring
to attain the highest in spiritual vibrations. This is
reached only through discarding all negative thinking,
closing out material conditions, then shut the door of
the mind, then with love in the soul and Divine at-
one-ment with the Father, the well-spring of power is
touched. Where one can sense the great spirit of
truth, the source of all wisdom, love and illumination."
SILENT SHRINE
Take time, at least a few seconds daily to visit the
silene shrine. For there is found the strength to mas
ter difficult problems and daily trials. Here the
heighth of power is reached with strength and courage
to wrestle with life's daily battles, The force of the
lower spheres, cannot reach one whose feet are plant
ed on this higher plane of life.
When one permits himself to drop in vibration, on a
level with discontent and inharmony, he is no longer
master. For here discord, sickness and various in-
harmonies can disturb one's peace of mind. Thus
manifesting on different planes, in agreement as one
vibrates in soul consciousness.
MASTER CIRCUMSTANCES

vibration. Depending upon the mode of soul growth.

Dropping into a slough, where apparently he is
swamped by conditions, and on a level with the trials
and sorrows of earth. "Don't do it." Arise above it,
say positively, "/ am master of this and every con
dition and every other vibration that tries to down
me." For nothing can hurt you unless you permit
it to do so.
Hold fast to the master consciousness, this keeps
you in touch constantly with the great source of sup
ply and universal power that means success ; which all
possess when becoming conscious of its source. It
leads one through the depths out into the sunlight of
God's rich promises. Thus becoming the captain of
thy ship, the master of thy soul.
HISTORY TELLS OF CHRIST
History tells us of Christ and how he demonstrated
supply and his marvelous success as a teacher and
healer in His day! Where did He get His divine in
spiration? He was also successful in inspiring others ;
for each good soul when filled with God's love and
universal power is constantly inspiring others on the
path.
History also tells of how He was tempted and would
go away to get into greater at-one-ment with the
Father —this was in the silence—for here is the safety
value—the channel of potver for every one. Then go into
thy closet the (silent shrine) and shut the door, He
that heareth in secret shall reward Thee openly.
Inspirational speakers and writers, and all arts that
take concentration, shut this door of the mind, barring
out all material conditions; dwelling for the time in
spirit; inhibiting all lower thought, where the forces
and master minds who are attuned to the finer vibra
tions, and understand the laws of life eternal, and in
all probability have had centuries of development,

can touch the mindls of the dwellers here. Thus do
they ascend upward in vibration, contacting these
higher developed minds and universal power of God.
Prayer is a great furtherance and source of power
towards keeping this safety valve on tap. Although
prayer without works is dead.
Through the darkness of night as the cold winds
and icy blasts of dissapointments, discouragements
and apparent failures, blow upon us use the safety
valve, the silent shrine for comfort, poise and strength.
Here one touches the well-spring of Divine wisdom.
You hear the voice of the silence speak, with that
soundless word like symphonies from the spheres above,
sounding its enchanting music on angels harps.
RATES OF VIBRATIONS
There has been no limit found to rates of vibrations ;
although observation teaches that one vibrates many
degrees higher and faster rates when receiving in
spiration; for the power from the spiritual planes of
consciousness is poured upon the mind at such a fast
rate of speed, it is almost impossible at times to re
tain all of the inspired message .
Many have discovered it very true that inspiration
is not wholly divine by any means; for it comes
through a lower source many times. When this
occurs, pity those who are in reach of this lower
vibrations ; for it can cause great injury and deep sor
row through its bitter fangs.
Keep thy soul swinging high in thy Heaven, there
in you discover lofty rates of vibrations.
Study good books, think pure wholesome thoughts.
Psychology teaches there is good in all souls even the
lowest criminal has that spark of the divine smoulder
ing within ; although many would contradict this state
ment, it is never-the-less true.
Through this discovery, one knows there is work
to be done on all planes of life. There is no excuse

Fan it into greater work by usage; then the inspira
tion from the great universal mind in this glorious
universe and teachers beyond our sphere of vision can
impress your consciousness with their awakened wis
dom and knowledge of a greater life yet to come.
Live the Christ life, that you may keep in harmon
ious relationship with this power continually; for
constancy reaps a rich harvest.
Thus is the mind prepared for the imprint upon
its sensitive plate of the picture or message to be con
veyed. Here is the great open avenue of light, where
by one gathers his energy and power.
Here is called forth the best that is within self,
thus calling forth the best in others. For no one
should ever try to live by self alone ; if he attempts the
experiment he will discover himself bankrupt. Thus
many poor miserable souls are without friends or com
panions.
WHERE DOES INSPIRATION COME FROM?
There are many conceptions as to where inspiration
really comes from. Some contend it comes from the
universal —or from God—others will say from unseen
forces —while others say it comes from the super-con
scious or sub-conscious mind.
If all are a part of the divine mind and power of
God (and we know this is true) then one need not
bother whether it comes from minds in spirit in
the universal —or divine mind; providing one lives
to be an inspiration and help to others and to inspire
and spur them onward to do the best that within
them lies. These efforts for others are stepping-stones
to the Christ. The pattern He left to trace out and
conscientiously follow.
Every one is a part of God's universe and its won
drous plan. It takes the whole of the universe to

make up the great final; you, I, all others. Then
live—let live—and help others to live. Constantly
pray for daily guidance, heed that intuitive voice; it
may be the Master speaking; this all leads to the
Ascension.
Take no detour from the uneducated in divine
truths, but rather pray to be directed to instructors
of highly developed power; these are able to plant
thy feet upon the path of light; but you are obliged
to walk thereon alone.
Those who have been long in the service of truth
are those who can guide thy footsteps from the pit

possibly do it for you. The illumination and Christ
unfoldment comes through polishing Thy own soul's
window; the burnisher used is service.
KEEP IN AT-ONE-MENT
By living in at-one-ment with the spiritual forces
of nature one is constantly prepared to touch the well-
spring of inspired minds of spirit, who know our
every need, for there is always some one near. Our
prayer is known before uttered. Out on the ether
waves of thought coming and going are messengers
from the spheres. So live that the Masters of light
will be your inspiration, coming more powerful at
times, owing to conditions.
If one is not entirely in tune with the Infinite, there
will be trouble in getting the direct message across.
A very good definition to call this failure is static.
The vibrations are distributed. Static not caused from
out the spirit spheres, but rather some cause or con
dition of the mediator between the two worlds.

INSPIRATION 21
The instrument may be properly attuned, or keyed
to catch over the etheric waves the thoughts of those
outside. One who is sensitive to etheric or spiritual
vibrations, should constantly be on the watch and con
stantly prayerful that their souls may be keyed to
receive only the best from out the etheric vibrations
such as impressions or spirit messages photographed
upon the sensative plate of the mind. You ask, can
all receive these messages? The majority can if they
prepare themselves. Then ask or invite the spirit
vision or listen in silencing the outer world of sense,
becoming keyed to the soul sense, and if one is in high
rate vibrations, he is in tune with the spirit station
or spirit radio and the message comes clearer and di
rect. If something disturbs the vibrations around the
mediator, it is then the message cannot so readily
reach the receiver. Then the loved one waiting out
side the door (of the mind) so impatient for a worn,
to convey through this avenue, the truth of their pres
ence and the fact of communication between the seen
and unseen worlds is disappointed, even a tiny rap
is many times heard, to inform one of a presence near.
Dr. J. M. Peebles "In Immortality" says a tiny rap
is a wave of love from the sea of eternal life, and
a throb of the physical form they once inhabited to take
up their life, where they left off here.
PREPARE THY SELF ALSO THE ROOM OF
SACRED SILENCE
Prepare thy sanctuary, by prayer and fasting is the
best method, previous to communion for best results.
This lifts the consciousness above the sordid con
ditions and vibrations of earth, thus one is then in
rapport with higher forces and in tune with the in-
finit. This is conducive to peace and harmony, also a
protection from any undesirable force who may
chance to be near.

22 INSPIRATION
How can another direct you along a road they have
never traveled ? Those who can guide your feet safely
through the rough places are those who's own feet
have been torn and bleeding from the sharp boulders
and cutting blasts of earthly conditions and experi
ences. These can best steer your ship of life into
safer channels, around the sand bars and seaweeds
of life's entanglements.
The great inspired minds of spirit who in turn in
spire us with such splendid service and proclaiming
the truth, have years ago in life, gone through their
Gethsemane and carried their cross to Calvary.
Now they come to inspire others with the thoughts
to build for the future, and to direct their feet to the
safest resting place, that all may have a solid founda
tion, with love of truth for their altar.
When the opportunity comes take it and light an
other's path. Keep it aglow (by a purified soul) in
readiness, for every emergency.
A DOUBTING THOMAS
A boubting Thomas gets no where. Do not ques
tion if the seeds of truth appear to fall on barren soil.
The Father of all will take care of that. It is for you
to sow, the reaping time will come later. You may not
see the results now in this life's existence, but in the
final summing up, you will see the golden harvested
result of the seeds sown and the reward of your labor.
In this manner one is constantly sending forth ma
terial that goes toward building one's house in the real
City of the Angels.
SEARCH FOR KERNELS OF TRUTH
Knowledge is something which no earthly thing can
take away after once possessed. Unless willing to
give to another. Read and study the wisdom of the
masters. Then permit others to light their torch by

it. One will soon develop discernment, then their own
intutitive soul will be their guide, to know when and
how to give.
Take down the bars of fear and trembling : place up
the bars of courage. "I can and I will." Doubt not
nor falter ; know thy pathway leads to the safety zone,
"The Father of Light." The Heaven of peace and
glories of everlasting life.
Thy way henceforth will be glorified. Know you
are capable of doing great and noble things, through
your own magnetic power of perception. Thus you
grope no longer in the dark. For you have found the
rich Kernels of truth "the many purposes of God's
wisdom."
Be not content to have some one person tell you
how to get the best results. Live your life well. Learn
your lessons with fortitude. Go out on your own ob
servation train with a brave heart and sunny smile,
searching out for every angle God's universal truths.
Upon this journey of introspection is found "all the
way to Heaven is Heaven" or the reverse, just as one
lives in agreement to the law.
On this journey one is given their various lessons.
It depends entirely upon themselves, how much they
receive or what profit gained therefrom, or what they
do with the harvested results. One will gain greater
benefit from knowledge of truth when passing it on to
others for the give and take plan is the growing plan.
Then Thy kingdom is come, Thy will is done. Send
out from this holy sanctury, joy and healing peace
vibrations to the world. Touching and inspiring those
who seem yet asleep to the real truth. There are
worlds and worlds of knowledge waiting in the es
oteric room of their being if they will invite its perus
al. Never forget your safety valve (the silence) this
is your place of non attachment in other words—let-
go—this is spiritual freedom.

24 INSPIRATION
THE COMFORTABLE MEDITATION HOUR
On this occasion one collects energy and power.
Let there be light and there was light; for the true
mystic must know the secret of opening his own
mystic door of light and wisdom. Here is discovered
the kingdom of Heaven —Here is the power behind the
great throne —The foundation of divine supply— The
inspiration of seers and sages.
One is obliged to arise out from the earthly con
ditions and seek the touch of the masters of light who
are attuned in the finer etheric vibrations, who have
learned the laws of life through centuries of thought
and who now reach out to you with their great un-
foldment of power. Meet them half way, by cultivat
ing the silence, by opening the door and inviting their
assistance. They are ready and willing to help direct
your feet on the path of safety toward the diviner
things of life. This means liberation where inspira
tion flows in Christ understanding.
To always keep in this place of safety would indeed
be Heaven. Try it—if one never tries how can one
know what they can do or how much they can receive.
PRAYER A SAFETY VALVE
With Mental Exercise
For healing affirmations and prayer are an aid and
power toward keeping this saftey valve on tap, for
like a blacksmiths bellows, it keeps fanned into flame
by its force, for prayerful thoughts and concentration
of forces, draw to one numerous heart desires. A
visualization as it were, though prayer without works
amounts to nothing—God helps those who help them
selves, use the great law of visualization, for through
this process of thinking, the law works almost mirac
ulously, for it gradually draws ones desired possession
closer and closer through the power of thought until
it materializes.

INSPIRATION 25
The deeper, finer truths are found through high and
lofty vibrations, keyed and attuned to the Divine order
of life.
The vibration one is daily living in, is usually that
of coarser and more material, impregnated with earth
ly conditions. In reaching finer vibrations the door
of the mind must be closed to the outer world; that
means enter the silence "the world within." "Relax
the physical, close out earthly thoughts, and seek in
conscious realization to touch the great universal
reservoir of power, the God power within. Concentra
tion and the silence assists nature in her work.
THE HOLY GRAIL
Love and desire must constantly fill the heart for
humanity, praying for wisdom and Divine guidance,
if hoping to successfully aid others to clear the cup of
all dregs ; then hope to touch thy own lips to the holy
grail.
Christ was successful in demonstrating and inspir
ing others through his own great soul unfoldment and
knowledge of trwth. He said these things I do ye can
do, and greater, for I go to the Father.
Many have a marvelous gift of healing, if they will
but permit love to enter their soul as well as other
wonderful things, God has permitted us to have. It
is for us to explore and find these dormant possibili
ties then use them.
History tells us, Jesus studied and received inspira
tion from others in spirit, before he went forth in the
vineyard to gather and glean. He also was tempted
and would go alone in the silence to get into greater
at-one-ment with the loving Father and there to gath
er strength and power from God's Universal world of
souls.
If only attempting this experiment once, one will
discover a wonderful feeling of upliftment and peace.

26 INSPIRATION
It gives one greater strength to go forth and battle
with life's various problems, calming and! soothing
the tired care-worn soul.
THE DIVINE WELL-SPRING
Through this Divine well-spring of inspiring silence,
one contacts the power where they realize the om-
nicient, omnipotent, and omnipresent One. This is
the remedy that heals the discouraged souls with heart
longings; they can sense the inspired minds of spirit
agencies, transmitting down through the chain of
spheres, the message of unspoken comfort and peace.
This is the meaning of the words, "He speaks though
he were silent."
Those who are filled with this divine inspiration,
know the truth and live it, can be with the sorrow
ful and discouraged, and without a spoken word,
strengthen and heal their souls. Some more readily
than others, yes—for some are more responsive or
already nearer the throne of safety, and can more
readily be touched, needing only the warmth of love
from a master consciousness to awaken in them a
responsive cord.
LOOK WITHIN
Keep looking within: there is the central fountain
of life. Nestle close to the divine Father, be in con
stant at-one-ment with Him—at all times have the
master key ready to turn in the lock, baring out the
undesirable thought forces of others. The golden
key to thy own observation car is—/ am master of self.

through the body to the feet.
This may seem complicated at first, but a little prac
tice is all that is needed. Carry any thought for your
own needs, in the exercise, and repeat seven times if
possible. Then let go of every atom of the physical
doby. Then let go mentally. This will be hard to
do at first, but practise until it becomes easy; it will
be the most profitable medicine ever taken, for the
nervous system. For when nature is not burdened
with your mind, it can do the work, can re-construct
which means to heal.
The inhibiting of thought is the hardest for the
unruly children of the brain are hard to master.
Practice until you are able to breathe with ease from
the solar plexus. This will relax and ease the muscles
—for lack of ease is disease.
This exercise will not only give body freedom,
but the mind also will sense a clearness and freedom.
The inspiration will flow to you and never mind where
it comes from, so it is that something that helps you
to live and be a better man or woman. Just be grate
ful for it. "This is where one discovers the kingdom
of Heaven and all things added unto you."
What a haven for a tired weary soul, to find this
inner sanctuary of soul to soul communion, in the
still soundless sound.
BE A TORCH BEARER OF DIVINE TRUTHS
Go forth in the Father's vineyard uplifting human
souls everywhere. Carry your torch light of love
and understanding to the hearts of humanity, teach
ing them to draw the curtain on malice, hatred and
envy, and that whatever one throws out in vibration
it returns.
Do not fail to turn your search light into the dark

there daily. There are those who are constantly
seeking your rays of light, give it ungrudgingly.
The desire is what is needed and it comes —when
the soul is flooded with God's love then the oppor
tunity is plentiful enough. Where're you go in the
crowded cities or where tropic breezes blow, they are
there waiting, for the harvest is ripe waiting for you
to garner and glean.
GIVE
Place not a cynic band around Thy heart,
Nor blind Thy eyes to all that is beautiful,
Nor doubt the honored and the true.
Keep a song in Thy heart for those who
Brave the storms of life to
Make it better, safer for you.
If inspired with truths received, pass it on that
others may receive benefit as well. For inspiration
is not alone for self, the supposition is Divine truth
is not to either be bought or sold for material gain.
When one can grow in knowledge and wisdom of
love and giving, where Jesus the Christ stood in truth,
giving without the thought of always receiving, these
will truly grow in Divine wisdom. It will flow to
them freely, for they become an open channel for
Divine law in giving. "The law of compensation is
the law of justice."
Nature speaks daily of this law. If observing on
every hand nature will be found a bounteous giver
—giving everything so freely to all. Live for a time
in God's great out-of-doors, study it, one will return
if observing at all filled with the thought of God's
manifold goodness all so freely bestowed upon His
children.
Yet it is sad to say, but is nevertheless true, if it
were possible some would harness the very air we
breathe and compel one to pay a price for it.

INSPIRATION 29
Do not permit this mercenary spirit of "get as get
can" take possession of you. Shun it as a viper for
it is as poisoious and deadly as a serpent.
Many will preach from their platforms the spirit
of giving, yet will be wondering how much is in the
collection plate for them. Do not be blind to these
teachers, sift the wheat from the chaff. This is not
the real Christ method but a mercenary spirit only.
THE TRUTH BEAUTIFUL
"Keep the windows of the soul polished through
justice and loving service, this aids purification and
lights thy pathway on to supernal heights, where
the truth sets Vou free."
Long has the real truth been too much commer
cialized. Try the Christ plan of giving for a time;
then watch the beautiful truth of God's inspiration
flow. This is bound to come, if one has the real metal
within him. With your feet planted upon wisdom's
mountain and face Heavenward, Christ walketh by
thy side to guide thee on.
Cast thy bread upon the waters, it will return unto
you. Watch this law work, it will come not just when
you expect perhaps, but more likely when needing it
most.
A servant is worthy of his hire ; the Bible tells one
this. Yet not more than he is worth. One is obliged
to live this is true. There will be other ways and
means to provide for one when in constant rapport
with Divine law.
THY CUP RUNNETH OVER
When one learns to give, as Christ has planned,
their cup will run over in good returns. One is oblig
ed to empty the cup often by the law of giving, which
is the law of service.

In this manner they ascend the steps to the holy
fountain and drink of the all-wise inspiration. Then
give from this cup of knowledge, for the world is
greviously needing
it,
to quiet the troubled waters
and storms of life, permitting the sun to shine upon
other souls. Prom the seed' of truth sown, thous
ands may reap

In its fruitfulness, the ripe luxurious substance
will penetrate the atmosphere and vibrate the truth
and its wisdom outward to the external confines of
the earth. Reaching those who are searching for the
real truth and like the kernel of wheat in its mission,
is
the staff of life for physical man. The laws of
eternal life are God's great precepts giving spiritual
food.
LAW OF ATTRACTION
Seek for Divine inspiration. (Ask and ye shall re
ceive.) One must be desirous and also deserving
of these good things of life if they hope to attract them.
There
is
a law of attraction (as a magnet attracts
the steel) so humanity
is
a magnet of power. Like
attracts like.
One cannot help attracting their friends to them
any more than they can prevent day and night. When
sensing this magnet attraction, give to them of your
friendship and love, you will soon know why they are
attracted to you and what
is
best for them. When
they have received their lesson from you and appar
ently drift away be not grieved. Just know the
obligation has been met and watch for other souls to
help. Send forth a blessing with them. This
is
the
Christ principle of truth and the phychology of divine
attraction.

INSPIRATION 31
GIVING INSPIRES
Joy is gained by giving,
The best your life contains.
Happiness is not in getting,
It is in the privilege of giving
What you've gained.
The truth you have given, or some joy you have
shared, bring its own reward of merit, inspiration to
do the will of God. When a soul is pure and holy, one
can easily tap the fountain of at-one-ment, that springs
forth as sparkling waters of Divine Truth. These are
the messengers of God to those who are seeking to
know something more than what has been previously
taught from orthodox platforms for centuries.
These many hundreds of years they have heard, to
walk in the straight and narrow path, that leads them
to salvation through the Vicarious attonement of Jesus
Christ.
Listen, Oh Children, of the all wise Providence, and
remember —never can one hope to be saved so easily
from sin, through the crucifiction of Jesus the shedding
of His blood.
All are required to work out their own salvation,
through service, through righteousness, living unself
ishly, sharing with those less fortunate than them
selves —and as the light of wisdom is revealed, pass it
along, that there may be an unbroken chain of good
deeds and loving service, all along the path the soul is
obliged to travel. Thus will the spiritual lamp be kept
continually filled with the purified oil of loving service.
That alone pays the price for each soul. Stepping out
from error to truth—from ignorance to knowledge —
from superstition to hope and faith in your own abili
ty to work out your own salvation. Becoming illumin
ed through Divine Inspiration given through the great
forces of nature.

32 INSPIRATION
BROADCAST THE TRUTH
One forgets self and his own trials when constantly
busy uplifting others for one becomes a sacred channel
of power. It becomes a joy helping souls less fortun
ate and who are down lower on the ladder of spiritual
progress. When one becomes purified and holy he be
comes a disciple for righteousness, for all souls are
constantly climbing, some above you, some below. The
2'ruitage of the soul only gives forth its radiant beauty
and sweetness through cultivation and growth.
Have no fear in trying to lift others up that they
may break away your own grasp or present standing,
for it gives one a firmer grip—a greater lease —a
stronger hold. Your soul window will reflect your hid
den light. This is the psychology of life, you must
empty your pitcher to have it refilled. Then lift and
boost, "look up and lift up" is the motto, when one
has gained a substantial footing himself. It then
opens the gates to the mystic path of light, the holy
city of the New Jerusalem.
An understanding of the climbing process belongs
to those souls who gave as they received of nature's
laws. Unless they follow this law they will neces
sarily slip back from where they feel so secure.
STEPPING STONES TO CHRIST
CONSCIOUSNESS
The give and take plan is the only sure stepping
stone toward a firm foundation to safely build Thy
future upon and one's soul must be awakened through
readjustment before they can give their greatest light.
Then know as Emerson tells us—"We are escorted on
every hand through life by spiritual agencies, and a
beneficient purpose lies in wait for us."

many times a day, for if one is in a vibration of peace
and harmony, desiring to send out a telepathic mes
sage to some country or place—to a body of people—
or one individual soul, that thought is on its way safely
journeying onward and will reach its destination.
On every hand one is discovering this great law of
vibratory thought waves or telepathy. They follow
the great law of the universe, for they bring back in
kind to you and in proportion of good or evil, whatever
you sent forth on the vibration.
Psychologists having the truth awaken, you know
thoughts are living things. Get busy with your inspir
ation, use the radio activity of power, broadcast it
over the earth. To those who have been asleep at the
switch so long, tell them of their essential duty they
owe to God and man, of the service they must render.
Remember nothing is impossible, perfectly applied
psychology is the fulfilling of the great and stupendous
laws of God.
ALIVE TO TRUTH
When alive to the great psychology of life, the things
that now annoy, will become seeming trivial and com
monplace compared to the greater things discovered,
for when a soul becomes awake to the universal laws
of God they find their thoughts have been the principle
cause of the past effect received and the cause for their
present daily material grind. Obeying the natural
laws of life with constantcy and by proper thoughts
in eating, breathing, exercises, concentration and medi
tation, poise and etc., etc., they thus build a new con
sciousness. The whole of the little world you live in,
which previously seemed such confusion will all pass,
bringing a new psychology of power, a new world will
be your possession. A new day will be born for you.
Why? because by living in obedience to Divine Law,
you get in rhythm and in tune with the universe, thus
in harmony with all life. Universal light and higher

soul consciousness, constantly reflecting through the
soul mirror, the unfolding Christ power.
This thought I wish to leave with those new in the
realms of scientific investigation of truth. First find
your self—or as the old philosopher said, "Man know
thy self." Get yourself centered, become poised, at
ease, in harmony with your own soul first. Then can
one see with a clearer, broader vision; with a clearer
insight into the things needing readjustment in your
own and in the lives of others.
KEEPING YOUR TROLLEY ON THE WIRE
Do not forget the safety valve I've been telling you
of, the silence, where the storms of life are calmed.
Here is the inner sanctuary of poise and power where
one finds his real self and his ability to do.
Then when for some reason their trolley gets off
the line of union with its great source of supply, it is
hoisted again into place. The power you so much neea
to keep your mental machinery going will be supplied
through the contact with the universal power —God.
Keep your trolley where it belongs, by going into
this sanctuary of the most high—the silence. I hear
some say I have no time. Oh, yes you have! When
you begin to demand things for your own good or the
good of others, the ways and means through divine
law will find you the time and place.
THE FINDING
In searching in strange path-ways and windings,
For truths that would lead me to God,
But farther away seemed the finding
With every new path-way I trod.
I searched for wisdom and knowledge
They fled me the farther I sought,
For teacher and text books and college
Gave only confusion of thought.

One can enter into the silence, although in crowded
places. Can be with the crowd but not of them, by
concentration of thought force. Look within—here is
your power-house. Here is the silence—here is where
you hear Him speak though He were silent. This
means to let go. It unlocks the door to the inner
sacred silence.
If you never fail to take care of this safety valve,
you will be on the high road toward success and mast
ership where inspiration will come floating in on the
etheric waves as music from the higher spheres of
Heaven. Here is discovered the meridian of a new
day, a new consciousness is born. This is the new
birth. The growing pains of this new child may have
been many and severe, but through this concentration
of thought forces you become a conceiver of the truth,
you have gained the final victory of conscious life, all
through first learning the fundamental principles of
the law, then living in union with the universal law
of life and of God. For life is law. When this is dis
covered, the inner side of every cloud will be bright
and shining.
THROUGH INSPIRATION AND VISUALIZATION
IS FOUND THE ROAD TO SUCCESS
We often meditate and also speak of doing things
worth while, but if one observes closely, he will dis
cover that the inspiration to do these things, must first
be aroused through the inner awakening or marshall

tration and visualization.
This alone gives one the incentive to go forward
blazing the trail for greater achievement and successful
ventures all through life.
"Go first within, if you hope to
Go Out and get what You Want."
HOW TO DRAMATIZE FUTURE
Begin to dramatize the future. Mentally see in the
coming tomorrow all you hope to be.
Use your intelligence and try to measure up to all
you ought to be. Visualize and use imagination, under-
stand natural laws. Through this comes a realization
of your ability to adjust yourself to Divine Principles.
Image the great things you want to be, then ask
yourself the question, can / measure up to my ideal
ism?
You gradually become inspired to gc on dramatizing
your vocational life. If you have been following your
weakest moral self, it is time to begin studying self-
mastery.
Keep before the vision beautiful pictures of moral
achievements, through the relation of proper scientific
thought.
Jesus did not proclaim any supernatural religion
or personal power, although it is very true his life was
exemplification of Divine Truth. Only through follow
ing in His Steps can one reach the acme of spiritual
perfection and success through loving service, right
eous living, and seeking evermore to be Christ like.
LEARN TO DO YOUR OWN THINKING
Have an open mind, become interested in the race,
for selfishness contains the germs of dissolution.

thing. Believe you shall receive and Ye shall receive.
Pray to create mental desire, then thank God you
can visualize and put into realization the great things
of life. This inspires one on to success on all planes
of life. It helps to keep one on the job, to go forth to
do and to be.
Hold your ideals—your realisms and make them
come true, this is a sure road to success. Then you
will discover greater opportunities in your world and
that you have become a creator of power, and are need
ed in larger fields of endeavor.
You have drawn to your self that measure of mag
netic force and power whereby you become a charged
dynamo, daily creating worth-while things.
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE RESERVOIR
OF POWER
It is very necessary to learn of, and keep in close
touch with, not only this great force and foundation
of power within self but it is indispensable to your
growth and development, to keep in touch with others
also, for through other minds of power, one gathers
fresh inspiration and strength. All this is an aid to
ward advancement in all great endeavors, for it is well
known one cannot grow by self alone. Keep the scales
of thought well balanced where the fires of love from
high and lofty spheres can broadcast to you revelations
from the infinite store-house of wisdom.
THE SUB-CONSCIOUS MIND— THE
STORE HOUSE
Many wonder why this sub-conscious mind is able
to recall for us so forceably things that transpired in
years past. While things thought and enacted in later
years slip by often forgotten, or perhaps unnoticed.

jective mind to be tapped at a moment's notice that
becomes our greatest subservient teacher, assisting
one in our present daily activities. For these exeri-
ences and impressions are so indelibly planted upon
the inner sensitive plate of our brain that their recur
rence is not necessary, for these lessons (for such they
are) once acquired' and thoroughly imbedded through
past experiences —and many times harrowing experi
ences and impressions, are never forgotten, therefore
need no repeating.
Thus do we get the inspiration to press forward into
greater ventures that gradually builds for larger and
better things of life, gradually rounding out the soul,
building a concrete and noble character that is to carry
one onward into successful ventures through endless
eternity.
Is this not worth more than all the silver or gold?
Yet we all know it, too, is very necessary for material
needs and pleasures, not alone for self but the good
that may be done to help others. Yet does this satisfy
only temporal needs and passing fancies. The former
everlasting.
HIDDEN RESERVOIR
Those who have not already become conscious of the
great hidden reservoir of force and power within, can
by concentration and will-power discover it is never
too late to attach themselves to this fountain of at-one-
ment that produces eternal supply.
This is the key that opens the great padlock of that
indwelling mind that opens the door to inspiration and
success and closes it to adversities, bringing to one suc
cess on all planes of life, for it builds a sound mind, a
healthy body, surrounds one with desirable friends and
business associates, inspires one with a greater desire
to do, not only for self but fills one with inspiration to
be of service to other human souls less fortunate.

INSPIRATION 39
With this incentive paramount, does one ever live on
the threshold of this great knowledge of "the give and
take plan ;" knowing that their greatest ambition and
the things they anticipate coming to pass will be some
time realized. "One should never forget they are for
ever being weighed on the scales through divine jus
tice."
HOLD THIS MODEL OF SUCCESS
God wants every one to succeed and be happy. Hold
the model before you of success. Think constantly
that your undertakings are being more and more pros
perous. Have faith in your own power to create a bet
ter condition; for your thoughts are the machinery,
make them do the work. Shakespeare in Hamlet says,
"There is nothing good or bad in life, but thinking
makes it so." The dominating power is thought, this
scientifically applied will bring all things into sub
mission. Never think you cannot succeed, for success
depends upon the right application of thought.
Emerson once said, "Thoughts takes man out of
servitude into freedom." They can certainly take one
upon the mountain-top of success, or drag down into
the debths of poverty and shame. Then is it not very
necessary to live constantly in the vibration where har
mony and peace are our daily companions? Then it
becomes much easier to have love and consideration to
ward others less fortunate, giving assistance to them
by lifting them out of their servitude into freedom, for
service is power and power is freedom.
MAKE OF MAN THE STATUE
Make of MAN the statue, the priceless piece of art;
All that Greece has given,
All that time has striven for ages to impart;
Weld it in his sinews, mold it in his thought,
Till the humblest scavenger is gloriously wrought.

40 INSPIRATION
Shame upon the galleries, filled with treasures fine,
While the work of Heaven —MAN, who is divine,
Shivers in the hallway, shuffles through the street,
Shambles down the ally, with weak and ragged feet.
Make of MAN the statue, make of MAN the building.
What avails the guilding, of altar or of dome ?
What the gorgeous tapestries blooming in the home?
What avails the splendor where stately mansions stand,
If men who make the mansions are homeless in the land ?
Shame upon the church spires towering to the sky,
While the drudging millions suffer, starve and die.
—Angela Morgan in "Hearst's."
And God said, "Let us make man in our image after
our likeness, and let them have dominion."—Genesis
1:26.
Every one has implanted within him that spark of
spiritual power. But like the fire that is covered for
future use, when stirrel up it becomes fanned into a
bright glow of warmth and beauty. When this power
is applied to, it is possible for it to give light and su
preme dominion over every thought, action, desire or
sensation in mind and body. Neither will they lack
strength, nor lack will to do, nor to carry their burdens,
thus working out their own salvation, their own
destiny.
CONCENTRATION
When burdens may seem to press, go into Thy
sacred silent sanctuary and lay them all on the altar
at the Master's feet. There to be ciphered out with no
characterizing by haste but in God's own time find
all things according to truth adjusted through divine
law, then with renewed strength can Thy shoulders
take them up one by one and carry them onward and
across the seeming abyss. Flor each soul is given
strength for its various burdens. Thy destiny must be

the many points relative to the soul's voyage.
Silent meditation and concentration of thought
forces draw to one deeper inspiration and power.
Power, the great magnet that draws from God's great
universal supply, strength to forge ahead to success
and final victory. Thus does a student of truth realize
and discover through applied psychology that he is a
world within himself; where the thought forces can be
harnessed to work for him, through this same law of
concentration, visualization, plus realization. Here is
found success —then why stay in bondage when you
can unlock the chains that bind and evolve, answering
to freedom's call.
DO YOUR OWN THINKING
Many may try to do your thinking for you; when
they themselves are an absolute failure. Unless you
do think for yourself, you will be a failure in all lines
of endeavor. Dwell in the true Christ consciousness,
this is the wonderful key to those who are path-finders
on evolutions train.
Develope your own great God-given power, He in

independence and freedom whereby you become a cre
ator and a success both material and spiritually. This
is all yours for the taking. The universe is governed
by law. You are forever reaping the effect of cause.
Learn to reap a golden harvest.

This will be because you have applied the magic
key that unlocks the reservoir to success, happiness,
health and wealth. Then on rendering an account of
your assets at the final, your conscience will be free

this magic key is only found through attainment and
applicable through Christ understanding. All this will
be the reward of merit, of a life lived well; through
believing in yourself and your own power to create.
WILL POWER
When your will becomes thoroughly developed, it is
then one becomes in a comparative degree a master of
circumstances, a power in the world, you discover the
method by which happiness, prosperity and success are
obtained.
The uneducated in the science of psychology are the
ones who usually stumble through life unsuccessful;
for those who are blind to the immutable laws of God,
discover all the stumbling blocks, for they have failed
to grasp the basic principles of the laws of life. There
fore are slaves to circumstances, while the former
press forward toward a successful goal, discovering
inspiration, poise, power and self-confidence.
Cultivate the will, then you discover what you are
really made of ; for mental culture is gained from the
experiences gleaned from the past, although it may
have been largely filled with trials. (Which is the
karma that all are obliged to work out and from which
none ever escapes).
THY THOUGHTS BUILD YOUR FUTURE
"Live that thy thoughts will build for you a promis
ing future, one that will be intermingled with success
and happiness along the path of progression, which
means a little bit of heaven here, as well as at some
future time."
A very grave mistake that the majority of human
ity and so-called Christians make is the fact that they
become so absorbed in preparing for a future heaven
they hope to find, they lose sight entirely of their

God1 wishes all to enjoy themselves and get the most
out of life while they are here ; so long as it is done in
a good wholesome and honorable way. Then all the
way to heaven is heaven when lived to enjoy and to
help others find the Aladdian lamp.
"This is to discover their own power to conceive and
create, to get a firm grip upon self, to compel ulti
mately the best to come to the front, through a deter

ures are only steppinlg-stones to greater achievements,
and when barriers are burned away, the reflected
light of thy soul's evolution will shine in lucid trans
parency for thee, accordingly to rates of vibration thy
soul's consciousness, in evolution has made.
Always keep the old maxim before you "If at first
you don't succeed, try, try again" never acknowledge
failure, keeping a firm grip upon all adversities and
circumstances through developed will.
Through experience, the greatest of teachers, one
gradually is taught his lessons. Then one goes forth
in the Father's vineyard, holding the torch of divine
truth that proclaims the dawn of a new day. The
morning dawns and the golden glow of the Son of
Glory shines upon the earth.
From God's great lighthouse is constantly flashed
rays of divine truth. Out of the fog comes the destress
signals from the great sea of humanity.
These Rays of truth are yours to give, toss to them
their life-saver. There is nothing belongs to yourself
alone. You are co-partner with God in every thing.
It is His wish, you divide and sub-divide with others.

SIGNIFICANCE OF LIFE
The fatherhood of God is living in loving service,
this is the pathway that leads toward the true brother
hood of man.
Permit Thy constant prayer and every inspirational
thought to be an aspiration that leads gradually to the
great threshold of Divine light—God-ward.
"The greatest study of all mankind is man. Loving
service is the fulfillment of the law according to the
real work done, the real life lived, to the thoughts
evolved. Real service given is the achievement of the
Christ consciousness.
The future is before you yet unborn and humanity
is daily creating it. It can be molded into happiness
and success by thought creation becoming related to
the Universal mind which is the great life principle of
every atom in existence, all of which is obtained
through corrective thought forces.
We are sowing today for a future harvest. It takes
time for seeds sown to root and send up their hidden,
shoots. All comes in due season, as in due time through
hidden desire, accompanied with ivill power, comes the
manifestation of life's manifold achievements.
The true significance of life is hidden, waiting to be
brought into full expression by cultivation, thus bring
ing harmonious and desirable conditions through the
laws of growth—into the objective world comes your
desired possessions.
Go slow, study, think, the ability to think is ability to
act, develope your mentality and gradually the seeds

but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the work."
