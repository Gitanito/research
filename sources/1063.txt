MEMORY IN ITS RELATION TO PSYCHICAL RESEARCH ^
By Professor Hans Driesch
So-called “ explanations ” of empirical facts are wont to be of
two different forms.
The first form of “ explaining ” consists of the demonstration that
a fact which at first glance seems to be new is only apparently so ; or in other words, that it is nothing but a new case of a known class
of cases, differing from the known cases only in particulars. In
this way the law of gravitation as established by Newton “ explains ” the movement of the moon and “ explains ” Kepler’s laws
of the planetary movements. Very many explanations in the
sphere of physics and chemistry are of this type.
The second form of “ explaining ” may be called hypothetic
invention. There is no class of known cases with regard to which
the new fact is nothing but a modification, no class into which, so
to say, it may be inserted ; the class-concept itself has to be established as an idtimate principle. This is the case in the sphere of
biology, for instance, as soon as you have broken with the mechanistic theory of life and have accepted so-called vitalism in any of
its various forms. It has also been the case in physics and chemistry
whenever these sciences encountered radically new discoveries, as,
e.g., in the sphere of electro-dynamics about a hundred years ago.
We are accustomed to say that we “ understand ” a fact as soon
as it is explained. But this is not quite correct. For we never understand any fact in the sphere of Reality in the deepest sense of
' This paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on 24th October,
1934.
A 1
2 Professor Hans Driesch [partthe word “ understanding Understanding of this sort is onlypossible in the sphere of the theory of pure meaning, i.e. in the sphereof pure logic and mathematics. We may say, however, that“ explaining ” in the sense described gives us something we can call “ secondary imderstanding ”, for in any case explanations aresimjilification guided by the principle of the economy of thinking.But we never imderstand the explaining principles in the deepestsense of the word. They can be acknowledged qua ultimate principlesof empirical Reality, but we never miderstand that they must bewhat they are.
I said at the beginnuig that explanations are wont to be of twodifferent kinds. Please notice the words “ are wont ”. Their purposeis to leave open the possibility that there might perhaps be still athird kind of so-called explaining, and it is of this third form thatI shall speak to you to-day with regard to a particular problem.
Exjilanations of the first kind start, as I have said, from a groupof known cases, which we shall call the “ normal ” ones, and tryto show that a new fact which at first appears to be “ abnormal ”is nothing but a modification of normality. But may it not happenthat facts which are very common and very “ normal ”, nay evencommonplace, may receive some light from facts which are veryrare, very abnormal or even “ paranormal ” ? It seems to me that this may be the case with regard tomemory.
Let me first speak of so-called memory as being a fact withinthe sphere of Reality ; we shall soon be able to see that this “ fact ”
implies very many problems of a very enigmatic character, and it
is to the enigmatic character of these problems that my hypotheticstatement will refer. Psychical research should throw some light on at least one of these problems.
We must make a sharp distmction between remembrance orrecollection on the one hand and memory on the other. By thefirst word (in German Erinnerung, in French souvenir) we describe a particular type of immediate conscious experience, by the seconda something that is generally called a potency or faculty of theso-called mmd. This distinction is connected with another one,
namely with that between the conscious Ego and the somethingwhich is “ unconscious ” and yet does not belong to the world ofmatter, in short the “ unconscious-psychical ”. We have to start from remembrance, for this is immediately experienced, whilst
memory may be said to be a theoretical construction.
What, then, is remembrance or recollection ? What do I experi- ence whenever I remember ? In any case, remembrance is a form
139 ] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 3
of my immediate experience, i.e. tliat whicli I consciously possess
or “ have ” in an immediate way. There are many other forms
or types : images, e.g., and wishes and thoughts and feelings, etc.,
belong here. What, then, is the very essence of remembrances,
that which distinguishes them from other experiences ? The
particular essence of remembrance is established by a certain
accent, as I should like to call it, which is absent in all the other
forms of immediate experiences. And this accent is denoted by
the word “ before ” or by the words “ this has already been ”. In
other words, we call immediate experiences, which carry on them
the accent “ before ”, “ remembrances ”. The accent of “ before ” may be attached to all other classes of
experiences. I can “ remember ” that I have had this image, or
this wish, or this thought, etc. Is not this accent of “ before ”, i.e. my possessing remembrances,
a very strange thing, a real enigma ? Think of the fact that I have
a remembrance always in a particular present moment of time or, in short, in a “ now ”—but it means a
“ before ”. In rememberiug
the past becomes present.
But certain distinctions in the field of remembrances are now
necessary and will be of great importance for what is to follow.
In the first place, it is necessary to distinguish between a mere idea
in the most general sense and a remembrance proper. If the image
of Westminster Abbey is standing before my conscious Ego, this
is not yet a remembrance ; it only becomes a remembrance when
the accent of “ before ” is added to the content of that idea, i.e. when I say “ This image of Westminster Abbey has already been
the content of one or of many of my experiences in former times ”.
This, of course, does not tell you anything new. But less obvious, though not less important, is another necessary
distinction in the field of remembrances : the distinction between
dated and non-dated recollections. I have been m Great Britain,
having crossed the Channel on the way to it, a dozen times : and
I can remember each of my visits separately. Here the time accent
which is attached to my conscious content is not only the general
accent of “ before ”, but is a particular “ before ” in each case. And each of these particular “ before ” accents stands in a very
strange relation to the others, namely, in a relation which is ex- pressed by the words “ earher ” and “ later ”, and this in quite a deternuned way ; in my case, for example, connected with the years
1889, 1890, 1896, 1907, etc. This, then, is a dated remembrance.
Not only the past in general becomes present here, but the particular
past in the course of time.
4 Professor Hans Driesdi [partSo much about remembrance as an immediate form of experiencein general ; so much, in other terms, about what may be called thedescriptive psychology or, to use the modern word, the “ phenomenology ” of remembranced
So far we have faced a fact not a problem, but a problem, a veryimportant problem, comes upon the scene as soon as we are inclinedto ask the question—and all of us are inclined to “ ask ” it in thisform—What are the reasons for the genesis of my remembrancesin the course of my conscious life or, in popular terms, from wheredo they come ? For that my remembrances are standing withinthe temporal sequence of my conscious experiences, each of themin its particular jdace, whether dated or not, is a fact. Here the analytical study of our problem has to begin, for nowthere is a problem before us, namely, as in the sphere of all sciences,
the problem of discovering order within a totality of facts. Butto try to discover order means to be in search of the relations in
which a particular fact, which for this very reason is called a problem,stands with respect to other problems, and in particular withregard to the question of its temporal genesis. Let us then try tofind out the genetic relations of the facts of remembrance.
I discover the first of these relations as soon as I compare myremembrances with the sum total of all my other experiences inthe past. And here I discover the relation of similarity or evenidentity. For remembering means that I experience a certaincontent which has l)een already experienced at a former moment.Apart from the accent of “ before ” which is a constituent of theremembrance exclusively, the quality of the content of the remembrance is the same, or at least almost the same, as the quality ofthe content of a former experience.
And this proves that there has been 'preserved a somethmg duringthe course of my conscious life, that it has been preserved in anon-conscious state, and is yet able to become conscious again ; that it is permanent in a certain sense. But where is it preserved ? Certainly not within the Ego, for quite apart from the fact that theEgo is not a sort of pot in which there might be a something, theEgo quite certainly does not possess the content in question aslong as it does not remember it. Are we allowed to say that “ themind ” is the place of preservation, that ever}fihing that has beenan object for the conscious Ego leaves its “ engram ” or a trace, or a vestige, or whatever we may call it, in the Unconscious Mind ?
^ A very profound analysis of the phenomenon remembrance will be foundin J. B. Baillie’s book, Studies m Hummi Nature, chap, iv, “ The Nature ofMemory Knowledge ” (pp. 105-132).
139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 5
This may be, and certain psychologists have thought so, as e.g. Beneke in the beginnuig of the nineteenth century. But it seems
to me that it would be a little rash to accept this hypothesis, which, once for all, would attribute to mind “ memory ” in the sense of
a faculty of preserving, and regard this statement as a definite
solution of our problem. In the first place it seems to me it would
not tell us very much simjily to reduce the actual phenomena of
remembrance to “ memory ” as a sort of faculty or potency. For
such a statement merely says that remembrance comes from the
faculty of remembering—think of the “ Virtus dormitiva ” of the
opium in Moliere’s Malade hnaginaire. And besides, we know
about certain relations of the phenomenon of remembrance to other
facts which must in any case be discussed before a definite answer
is possible.
It may be that in some sense we shall come back to the concept
of “ memory ” as a primordial faculty of the mind. But it may also
be that things will appear to be much more complicated.
Man is a dualistic creature, a psycho-physical being, whose
physical part is called body. I cannot develop here before you the
psycho-physical problem in its totality.^ Let me only say that
the doctrine of so-called “ psycho-physical parallelism ” in its usual form, namely the doctrine that conscious life is “ the same
”
as the mechanics of the brain “ seen from the other side ”, seems
to me to be absolutely absurd. This theory, in fact, should definitely
get its place in the antiquity museum of scientific theories.
But some sort of relation between conscious life and states of
the body, and particularly of the brain, does certainly exist, of
whatever kind it may be, and it has a reference to that form of our immediate conscious experiences which we call remembrance.
It is a well-known fact that lesions of the brain, whether they are the consequence of an ojjeration or of an accident, are very often,
though not always, followed by disturbances of the conscious life, and in particular of the faculty of remembrance. The defects of
memory may either reveal themselves in the impossibility of
rememljering something that normally would be remembered with
certainty, or in gaps in the sphere of recognition : objects which
in the state of normality would be recognised as what they are, are not recognised if a lesion of the brain has taken place.
This is a fact. Another fact, however, is that in very many
cases such defects of remembering or recognising disappear after
1 Compare my books Mind and Body (English translation by Tli. Bester- man) and The Crisis of Psychology (Princeton University Press). Also the
second edition of the German book Grundprohleme der Psychologic.
6 Professor Hans Driesch [parta certain time, to the great benefit of the patient. You may saythat for this very reason the defects of memory have not been of afundamental character. But in any case they have been present fora certain time after the lesion ; and this fact is sufficient to provethat a certain relation between remembering and the state of thebody, in particular the brain, does exist. It is just here that adeeper analysis of what happens will have to be made later on, ananalysis which is to give us important results.
But the phenomenon of remembering does not only stand inrelation to other |)henomena of the conscious life itself and to statesof the lu’ain ; it also stands in a relation of dependence in respectto something else, that we may shortly call the modifications of the
state of mind, where the word “ mind ” is taken in the rather vagueand general sense in which I have used it, namely, as signifyingthe unconscious substructure of conscious life. In the state of hypnosis the faculty of remembering is alwaysgreater than in the waking stage, very often in cpiite a curiousdegree. Former experiences which long since have been completelyforgotten, and which could inider no circumstances be reproducedin waking, are reproduced in hypnosis. The hypnotised person,when woken from the hypnotic state, may not remember what hehas reproduced during that state. But in any case he must havereproduced these things during h}q)nosis, otherwise he would notliave been able to speak about them when in that state. This, then, is the third kind of relation in which rememberingstands ; the faculty of remembering depends on the states of themind in the sense defined.
And now we are prepared to enter into theoretical considerations.I shall ])egin by shortly explaining to you in the form of sketcheswhat may be called the usual and, so to say, “ official ” hypothesesabout the genesis of the phenomenon of remembering, aj^art fromthe impossible theory of parallelism. These hypotheses, of course,do not touch psychical research, for they are “ olficial ”. We have already shortly mentioned the hypothesis of mentalengrammata. This is a purely psychological theory ; it is insuffi-cient, as it does not account for the dependence of remembering onthe condition of the brain, a dependence which, as we know, cer-taiidy exists, and the relation l)etween the degree of memory andthe various mental states also remains miexplained. The matteris certainly not so siniple.
Let us, then, argue as follows ; There are vestiges m the braincorresponding with everything which the person in question hasexperienced during his life. These vestiges or engrammata are of
139 ] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 7
a purely material nature—miknown in detail. The unconscious
Mind, taken as an entity in itself, has also received vestiges during
life and preserves them all in the form of memory. But this memory
on the part of the mind does not greatly help the remetnbering on
the part of the conscious Ego, which is regarded here as being a
particular part or side of the Mind. Under certain circumstances,
however, the Mind wishes to give to the Ego a conscious experience
of the forms of a remembrance, and in order to do this it activates a particular one of the mental vestiges of the brain—reading in a book of these vestiges, as it were—and then the Ego remembers.
So far we have regarded the Ego as being a part or side of the
Mind. Another modification of the theory is, however, possible.
We may call it the Aristotelian modification, for it takes Mind and
Ego as two separate entities, corresponding to the Aristotelian
concepts of iffvxy and vovs, whilst hitherto we have regarded Mind
and Ego as being one entity at the bottom. From the Aristotelian
point of view we might now say that the entity which we have
called Ego is stimulated by certain states of the entity Mind to
“ read ” in the book of material engrammata of the brain—and
then it remembers. Mental engrammata would not play any role
in the sphere of this hypothesis.
Both theories are rather fantastic constructions. They are
necessary, however, in one form or another, as soon as you reject
parallelism but are not at the same time prepared to leave the
sphere of official psychology.
There is one particular difficulty common to both theories. This
difficulty, however, may be overcome.
I am thinking of the fact that both theories employ the concept
of material engrammata in the sense of particular material states
of the brain. Now all that is material exists at once ; it always is what it is at the present moment, but never what it has been.
Material states, in other words, qua “ material ” states never carry
their past history with and on themselves. How, then, may what
we have called a
“ reading ” in the book of engrammata reveal
the particularly dated past to the reading Ego—whether we take
it as a part or side of the imconscious mind or as a particular entity 1 In fact, a grave difficulty seems to come upon the scene here, i^d
yet this difficulty is not so grave as it might seem at the first glance.
For the reading Ego might behave lilve a detective in a “ shocker
Certainly the engrammata are all present at once. But might they
not possess a different degree of freshness, just as foot-prints in
sand may show a corresponding difference 1 Then this degree of
freshness of the impressions would be a symbol of their relative
8 Professor Hans Driesch [partage. And the “ detective ”, i.e. the Ego, would be able to inferthe relative age from the relative freshness.
The simultaneous presence of all mental engrammata in the brain,therefore, would not be a fundamental difficulty for the officialtheories.
And yet the official theories of the genesis of remembrances arenot only fantastic, as we have said before, but insufficient, for theygive no account of our second and third t}^)es of relations betweenremembering and something else, namely, the dependence ofremembering on states of the brain and on states of the 'mind.
Let us, then, in the first place, enter into a more detailedanalysis of the relations between remembrance and conditionsof the brain.
The disturbances of the faculty of remembering by lesions ofthe brain are of a very peculiar type. They do not allow us to saythat the content of every particular former experience is representedby a specially localised impression or “ engram ” in the brain.For facts do not prove that particular former experiences areeliminated from the sphere of possible reproduction in consequenceof a lesion of the brain ; the defects of memory consequent oncertain lesions are of a very different type : personal names are thefirst thing that can no longer be remembered, and then come nounsin general, and finally verbs, i.e. all words related with events.This rule was first formulated by Ribot. His statements are mostdecidedly opposed to the view that there is something like a particularseat of each particular former experience.
And further : In very many cases the possibility of rememberingis restored after a certain time, even if the loss of brain-substancehas been very considerable. This fact also tells very clearly againstthe theory of engrammata as far as these are regarded as specifically
localised material structures.
Rut, on the other hand, whenever we accept the concept ofengrammata or material vestiges at all, these engrammata must belocalised in one form or the other. It is impossible to assume thatthey are not, as long as they are taken as particular material states or conditions. For every state or condition which is material is also localised in some way.
What shall we do in the face of these facts ? Let me repeat : The defects of memory in consequence of alesion of the brain are, firstly, of a very j^eculiar type, as describedby Ribot and others, and are, secondly, iii very many cases
restorable, even if the loss of bram substances has been veryconsiderable.
139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 9
For these reasons engrammata cannot be localised ; but if they
are not localised, they cannot be material states and conditions in
the proper sense. And yet lesions of the brain do affect memory.
What, then, may this role of the brain turn out to be ?
It is at this point of our discussion that our hypothetic considerations will enter the field of psychical research. Let me state
the hypothesis at once. It seems to me possible to assume hypothetically that, with regard to remembering, the brain plays the
role of a so-called fsyclmnetrised object of rapport.
All my readers know what the word “ psychometry ” means, and
all, I am convinced, are also aware that this word is not approjiriate
when taken literally. For nothing is “ measured ”. But it is of no use, as it seems to me, to introduce new technical terms if the
old ones are universally understood. The words “ physics ” and
“ physiology ” are likewise names which theoretically might be
abolished, for both of them mean the same literally, though they
are used for very different sciences. Let us, then, use the word
“ psychometry ”. The centre of the concept of psychometry is the psychometrised
object of rapport. This is any object whatever which has belonged
to a human person, present or absent, living or deceased, and which,
when touched or merely seen by a sensitive, enables him or her to
tell us something about the former proprietor of the object. The
psychometrical object, then, reveals the past, reveals history.
But not, at least most probably not, the history of the object as
such, but the history of the former proprietor of the object. All
cases we know tend in this direction, and there are very many very
good cases in various volumes of our Proceedings as well as in the
works of Wasielewski, Pagenstecher, Osty and others.
That which seems to be at work here, I should like to call retrospective mind reading. I should not like to call it “ clairvoyance ”,
though certain writers have done so. For “ clairvoyance ” in the
proper sense of the word means the paranormal awareness of an
objective situation within the sphere of Reality. Now all the facts
the sensitive is aware of in the case of psychometry relate to the
past. But past situations qua objective situations do not exist
any more in the present. Past contents of consciousness, however,
do exist in the present, in the form of contents of memory of certain
persons, or may at least be assumed to exist in this form hypothetically—either in the memory of deceased persons, if you are
inclined to accept spiritualism, or in the world-consciousziess as advocated by James and Osty. I might even say that the hypotheses of spiritualism and of the “ conscience universelle ” have
10 Professor Hans Driesch [part
been invented in order to avoid such a strange thing as real retro- spective clairvoyance.
There exists, as you know, also the hypothesis of so-called “ mind
travel ” or “ excursus This has been put forward in order to
give a siifficient reason for clairvoyance proper, as it is so often
connected with a telepathic stimulus. But this hypothesis can only
explain a clairvoyant awareness of a 'present objective situation, never a paranormal experience of a situation in the past. For
you cannot “ travel ” in the past.
But let us now go back to our problems of remembrance. Mytheory, then, is that the brain is a psychometrical object of rapport,
and that the Ego of the bearer or proprietor of the brain is the one who used this rapport object, namely, his own brain, in order to
get information about his own past history : this would be just
what we call “ remembrance ”. You may object here that it seems very strange to explain
phenomena which are so common and normal, as remembrance is, by suljstituting this very strange phenomenon, psychometry.
And you may tell me that I myself on another occasion have
called psychometry the most enigmatic of all j^arapsychical
phenomena.^
Admittedly it is ; and yet a certain theoretical simplification
may be gained l)y introducing this concept, for there are certain
facts in connection with the phenomenon of remembrance which
will now become understandable, at least to a certain degree. These
facts, moreover, are just those which have made it impossible for us
to accept any of the current and “ official ” theories of memory.
Thinlv of what I have said about certain kinds of relations in
which the phenomenon of remembering stands with regard to other
well-established facts. The first of these relations was concerned with the body, the
brain in particular. The effects of lesions of the brain-matter were
foimd to be of such a kind that the hypothetic assumption of
material engrammata qua “ material ” impressions appeared to
be impossible : the so-called engrammata cannot be localised, and,
besides, the effects of a lesion, of a very grave lesion, disappear
after a certain time in very many cases. The second kind of a relation to something else in which the
phenomenon of remembrance stands is its relation to what wehave called “ states of the mind ” : the faculty of remembering is enormously increased duruig the hypnotic state.
1 Compare my “ Parapsychologie ”, 1932 : English translation by Th.
Besterman, Psychical Research, 1933.
139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 11
Now it is just these two kinds of relations wliich we should expect
to exist in the foundation of our psychometrical hypothesis ! As
to the dependence of remembermg on the brain, we know that the
something which a psychometrical object of rapport has “ on
”
itself, so to say, is certainly not a material modification qua material
;
for this reason it must not necessarily be regarded as being specifically localised and may easily be taken as restorable after disturbances. And secondly : in the state of trance the psychometrical
faculty of a sensitive is generally very much increased. Now the
hypnotic state is very similar to the state of trance, and thus we
are able to understand the great increase of the faculty of remembering in the hypnotic.
We may also add still another feature that is common both to
psychometrical experience and remembering : it is a well-known
fact that we remember past events of our life with particular
clearness whenever they carry an emotional accent. Now emotion
seems to play a corresponding part in psychometry. In most
cases, at least, the sensitive who is in touch with an object of rapport
is especially aware of those past events relating to the former owner
of the object in which emotion has played a predominant role. So we have acquired at least a certain understanding of thi'ee
peculiarities of the phenomenon of remembrance, which without
our hypothesis would remain completely imintelligible.
I am well aware that this kind of understanding is very preliminary and very defective. And yet it seems to me that the
psychometrical hypothesis, as applied to the fact of remembering,
means a little more than merely the substitution of a “ y
” for an “ X
In any case there is a certain feature that is common to both : to the psychometrical object in the ordinary sense and to the
brain in its relation to remembering. This feature or character is luiknown in detail at present, no doubt. We only know of it, that
it consists in the necessity of the actual presence of a particular
material object with a particular history, the peculiarity of which,
however, does not refer to material particulars qun “ material ”
ones. Some such’ object must exist, in ordinary psychometry as
well as with regard to the brain in its relation to remembering.
And this statement implies in any case a theoretical simplification.
It is hardly necessary to emphasise that the hypothesis of the
psychometrical role of the brain does not by any means imply that
this role is the only part played by the cerebrum. Such an assumption would be very far from truth.
We know that the brain has a structure of enormous complexity.
12 Professor Hans Driesch [partIn this respect it serves the purpose of the realisation of correlated
movement, i.e. “ action ”, connecting almost every part of theorganism with almost every other. Here it is the brain’s particular
material structures, taken qua “ material ” ones, that are of importance ; the brain in this respect is an apparatus of enormouscomplexity, used by the mind for its purposes.
As far, however, as its psychometrical role is in question, thebrain counts only as one Unity with a particular history, just as any inanimate psychometrical object does, say a watch given into
the hands of a sensitive person. The watch too does not counthere as a particular material structure serving the indication oftime, but as one Unity with a particular history. And so doesthe brain.
1 do not, of course, at all believe that my psychometrical hypothesis ex])lains the conscious life in its totality. It does not evenex|dain everything that is connected with remembering, thoughit may explain certain characteristics of this fact. If we call “ memory ” a certain faculty of the mind which enables the mindto preserve, so to speak, past experiences, we are forced to attribute
to the mind the faculty of pure preserving : i.e. niemory as anelemental faculty apart from the psychometrical faculty which weattribute to it. In other words, nmnory as an elemental faculty
becomes by no means superfluous in the face of our hyjDothesis.
But we burden the mind with the faculty of preserving mereideas, i.e. mere contents of former experiences exclusively, not,
however, with the faculty of preserving particular “ remembrances ”. And this means that we attribute to the mind, under the name of“ memory ”, nothing but the faculty of preserving the past in the
form of a mere material for its working, whether this be thinking,
willing or whatever else. To give an example ; The image of
W estminster Abbey is preserved by the mind in the general memorialform. Not, however, the fact that I have experienced W'^estminster
Abbey before, that is to say, not the content “ Westminster Al^bey ”
with the accent “ before ”. Remembrance proper, i.e. my consciously possessing a something ivitlt that accent, be it dated or not dated,
is that feature of conscious life which calls our psychometrical
hypothesis upon the scene. With regard to remembrance proper,
the general preserving faculty of the mind, which is called memory,does not, in my opinion, suffice. For this very reason I rejected the
“ official ” theories of memory in the beginning of this paper.
I thus made a sharjo distinction between the conscious possession
of mere ideas or contents, which of course also come from past
experiences, and the possession of the past as such, be it dated or not.
139] Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research 13
It might be possible, perhaps, to draw the sharp line of distinction,
not between mere ideas and remembrances proper, but between
dated and undated remembrances. In that case, memory would
be the mind’s faculty for preserving mere ideas and non-dated
remembrances, whilst only with regard to dated remembrances
would the psychometrical faculty of the mind be at work. Memory
would be concerned not merely with my possessing mere contents
of former experiences without any 6e/ore-accent, but also with my
possessing “ before ” accents in general, though not particularly
dated ones. But ^lersonally I should prefer the other alternative.
The problem we have just now discussed is not without importance for those who are inclined to accept the so-called spiritualistic hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis of personal survival. If the
presence of the bram is necessary only for dated remembrances,
the disembodied spirit would not be able to possess such remembrances after death, though he might possess all mere contents
that were acquired by him during his embodied life, and also the
general “ before ” accent. This means to say that he might be able
to remember : “I have experienced this or that, when I was
living ”, but not “ this was earlier than that ”. On the hy|3othesis
that all remembering, dated and non-dated, depends on the brain
taken as a psychometrical object, the deceased spirit would, of
course, be only in possession of mere ideas or contents without
remembering any kind of “ before ”. A few words may, finally, still be devoted to the concept of the
psychometrical rapport object in general, with particular reference,
however, to the brain.
Whilst speakmg from the platform of some of the usual and,
so to say, “ official ” theories of memory, i.e. of those hypotheses
which though rejectuig parallelism are not concerned with the
results of psychical research, we regarded the brain as if it were
a book in which engrammata of a symbolic kind were inscribed,
and we attributed to the Ego the faculty of “ reading ” m this
book and of interpreting what it has read. The engrammata were
taken here as being of a strictly material, i.e. of a physico-chemical,
nature in the narrow sense of this word. But it then turned out
that, for various reasons, the engrammata cannot be localised
material states or conditions of the brain. And yet the brain does
play a role in remembering. Thus we were led to our psychometrical
h}^q)othesis, no other theoretical possibility being left. But what does it ultimately mean to regard the brain as an
object of rapport, revealing to its bearer his own past history ? An object of rapport carries on itself the complete past at once,
14 Memory in its Relation to Psychical Research, [part 139though not in the form of material localised impressions, as the“ official ” theories of remembering were forced to assume. How,then, may particulars with regard to the past be revealed here,
how may it be inferred that one past event has been earlier orlater than the other ? You will be aware that we are here in face of the great problemof psychometry in general : What does the object of rapport have “ on ” itself ? Certainlynothing of a material nature. But what ? May we say, perhaps,that it has nothing “ on ” itself in the proper sense of the word,but that it stands “ in relation to ” something else ? This, then,
is in fact the view of those workers who have deeply thought aboutthe problem of psychometry—let me only mention Mattiesen andBozzano. And it did appear inevitable to these thinkers to introduce here the hy|3othesis of an universal world consciousness, evenif you are inclined to accejjt the spiritualistic hyj^othesis. Forthe two great parapsychical hypotheses do not necessarily contradictone another ; both of them may be true. But it is not my task here to discuss problems of psychicalresearch in general. My theme has been a limited one : memoryin relation to psychical research.
Within this limited field I have tried to develop before you a hypothesis which is probably a new one—I, at least, do not knowof a predecessor here. I dehver this hypothesis to criticism, fully aware that it is a hyj3othesis. But hypotheses—so it seems to mein spite of the great Nevdon’s “ hypotheses non fingo ”—hypotheses do not do any damage to science, as long as they are regardedas hypotheses.
NOTES ON “ WALTEK ” THUMBPRINTS OF THE
“ MARGERY ” SEANCES
By Harold Cummins
Introductory Note by W. H. Salter
As many of our members may not have followed closely the con- troversy regarding the genuineness of the “ Walter” thumbprints,
produced at seances given by “ Margery ” (Mrs Crandon), they may
be glad to have a brief explanation of the nature of Professor
Cummins’s subjoined report and of how he came to make it. Those
who wish to follow the controversy in detail may do so in the
publications of the American Society for Psychical Research and
of the Boston Society for Psychic Research ; {See in particular
Proceedings, vol. xxii, of the former Society and Bulletins XVIII
and XXII of the latter Society). It is well known that the publications of the American Society for Psychical Research have, since
the issue in 1928 of the first number of Psychic Research, been
largely devoted to accoimts of sittings with “ Margery ” at which
her Control “ Walter ” is said to have produced impressions of his
thumbs in “ Kerr ” dental wax, and that numerous photographs
of the impressions said to have been so produced illustrated the
articles describing the sittmgs. A member of the American Society
for Psychical Research, Mr Dudley, took a prominent part, both
in supervising the sittings and in presenting the reports of them to
the public.
The controversy began when, in Bulletin XVIII of the Boston
Society, Mr Dudley made statements which may be summarised
as follows ;
(1) Shortly before the first sitting (30 July 1926) when “ Walter ”
thumbprints were produced, Mrs Crandon visited her dentist
(“ Kerwin ”, pseudonym) who made for her impressions of his own
thumbs in “ Kerr ” wax, and gave these impressions to her, together
with spare pieces of wax.
(2) In 1932 he (Mr Dudley) was obtaining for purposes of record
finger-prints of all who had attended “ Margery ” sittings ; and
as “ Kerwin ” had attended some of the earher sittings, he asked
to be allowed to obtain his prints ; “ Kerwin ” consented, and on
15
294977
16 " Harold' {JvMimins : Notes on [partcomparison it. was eyir’ent that liis thumbprints corresponded soclosely with txi any thumb impressions reproduced in Psychic Researchas “ Walter's ” as to make it certain that the impressions derived(directly or indirectly) from the same pair of thumbs.
The reply to Mr Dudley is to be found in vol. xxii of the Proceedings of the American Society. In this volume the statementsset out in the last paragraph are not challenged but further state-ments are made, which suggest inferences different from those thatmight naturally be drawn from Mr Dudley’s statements. Thesefurther statements, so far as they relate to impressions of theright thumb (which is all that Professor Cummins’s report dealswith) are as follows :
(1) “ Kerwin ” made his impressions on the afternoon beforethe sitting of 30 July 1926 ; they were shown by “ Margery ” toMr Dudley that evening and taken away by him.
(2) While the “ Kerwin ” prints and the impressions illustratedin Psychic Research, exactly correspond, the real “ Walter ” impressions do not ; there is a resemblance in some respects, but,among other differences, the true “ Walter ” thumbprints show a“ staple core ”, while the “ Kerwin ” jnints and the impressionstallying with them show a
“ rod core ”. For an explanation ofthese terms, see Professor Cummins’s report.
Mr Dudley’s rejoinder (Boston Bulletin XXII) is a flat denialof having ever seen the “ Kerwin ” impressions in 1926, as alleged.
While various points in the controversy almost irresistibly invitecomment, there is only one point with which the S.P.K. is concernedand to that point I shall confine my observations.
In Deceml)er 1929 the Council of the S.P.R. lent the Society’sseance room to Dr Crandon who wished to give demonstrations ofsittings with “ Margery ”. Dr Woolley, then Hon. ResearchOfficer, and Mrs Brackenbury, his Assistant, were present asobservers. xWter one of these sittings a piece of wax was foundbearing an impression of one of “ Margery’s ” fingers. This incidentis reported and commented on by Dr Woolley and Mrs Brackenburyin vol. xxxix of S.P.R. Proceedings (pp. 358-368). At the sittingof the 7 December 1929 “ Walter ” produced two impressions ofhis right thumb, one of these was presented by “ Walter ” to DrWoolley and the other to Mr Harry Price {See Psychic Research,vol. xxiv). Dr Woolley put the impression given to him in a cardboard box inscribed (in Mrs Brackenbury’s writing), “ ‘ Walter ’
impression obtained at seance held at S.P.R. 7 December 1929.
Medium. Margery Crandon.” The box was placed in a lockedcabinet, the only key of which was in Dr Woolley’s custody.
139] “ Walter ” Tlmmbprints of the “ Margery ” Seances 17
On Dr Woolley’s resignation in December 1931, the cabinet and
key came under the control of Miss Newton. The box remained
there untouched until the 31 January 1934, when Miss Newton
found it and opened it in the presence of Mr Besterman and myself.
She then initialled and dated the wax, and also the liox, for the
purposes of identification. As this impression had been produced
before the present controversy began, and had been in the Society’s
possession under lock and key ever since, the question whether it conformed to the “ Kerwin ” type with a
“ rod core ” or to the
“ staple core ” type was obviously of the first importance to any
one wishing to form an opinion as to the merits of the dispute.
In August 1934 Professor Harold Cummins of the Department
of Anatomy, Tulane University of Louisiana, was visiting London
to attend a Congress. Professor Cummins is a recognised authority on “ dermatoglyphics ”, and in that capacity had in December
1932 been invited by the American Society to report as to whether
two sets of prints sent him were identical. He was a quite independent expert, not having previously been connected in any way
with the “ Margery ” mediumship. When he made his reports
(printed on pp. 201-208 of vol. xxii of the American S.P.E.
Proceedings) he knew nothing about the origin of the two sets of
prints submitted to him.
Professor Cummins wished to take the opjjortunity of his visit
to England to inspect the impression in the possession of the S.P.R.,
and any other impressions in England that might be open to inspection. He met Miss Newton and myself at the Society’s Rooms on
the 1st August 1934. There was also present Mr Stanley de Brath,
who brought with him a “ Walter ” impression belonging to the
British College of Psychic Science. Professor Cummins, in the
presence of Miss Newton, Mr de Brath and myself, carefully exa- mined four impressions : (1) the impression given to Dr Woolley
on the 7 December 1929, (2) two impressions given by “Walter”
to Lord Charles Hope, and by him sent to the S.P.R. for the pur|)ose
of Professor Cummins’s inspection, and (3) the impression brought
by Mr de Brath. He kindly promised to give me a written report,
and this is the report printed below.
No good photographs of the impression in the possession of the
S.P.R. existed so far as I knew ; a not very satisfactory photograph
sent by Dr Woolley to the American Society is reproduced as Fig. 7
to the Boston Bulletin XXII. Accordingly it seemed to me desirable
that the S.P.R. should have good photographs taken of the impression. Major Rampling Rose, a photographic expert, who is a member of the Society, kindly gave me an introduction to an
18 Harold Cummins : Notes on [partimportant firm of photographic manufacturers, to whom I tookthe impression for reproduction. A negative was taken and developed in my presence, and a print is here reproduced (Fig. A, p. 20).
Unfortunately when a second exposure was being taken, the waxdid not prove hard enough to stand the heat of the projectorswhile the focus and illumination were being adjusted, and theimpression became distorted in consequence.
W. H. S.
Foreword
Those who have followed the history of the “ Margery ” mediumship are akeady familiar with the controversy centring about thethumb-print phenomena. The present note concerns the results
of a recent examination of eight “ Walter ” thumb-prints (negativeimpressions in a dental compound) produced under this mediumship, the examples being severally in the possession of individualsand societies in England.^ The findings have an important bearingon two crucial issues of the controversy : (1) Is the right thumbprint ascribed to “ Walter ” identical with that of the living man,“ Kerwin ”?
(2) Is it justified to maintain, as do writers in vol. xxii of theProc. A.S.P.R., that impressions displaying such identity aresubstitutions, and not authentic seance prints ? The jResent note aims to deal with these prints purely objectively, as evidences pointing the answers to the two questions. A full presentation of finger-print evidence is necessarily technical, butsince this account is merely a supplement to the writer’s previoustechnical contributions,^ its subject matter may be presented quitebriefly and simply. It is desirable, however, to provide a resumeof pertinent developments which have been previously recorded,
in so far as these concern the isolated question of identification.
1. Thumb-prints were first produced 30 July 1926 ; these andnumerous prints of a right thumb made thereafter, over a period^ It is a pleasure to mention here the generous and helpful spirit with which
possessors or custodians of the tablets have so freely placed the specimens
at my disposal for insjjcction. I wish, therefore, to acknowledge the co- operation of the following : S.P.R., L.S.A., Mr W. H. Salter, Mr Stanley
De Brath, Mr Harry Price, Lord Charles Hope, Sir Ernest Bennett, and Prof. F. C. S. Schiller.
2 (o) Proc. A.S.P.R., vol. xxii. pp. 201-208, 1933 (embodying two reports on
prints and photographs submitted by Thorogood for technical examination, with
testimony that the right thumbs of “ Walter ” and “ Kerwin ” are identical).
{b) Bull., B.S.P.R., xxii. pp. 1-26, 1934 (contesting Thorogood’s alleged
evidences of the non-identity of the “ Walter ” and “ Kerwin ” thumbs).
139] “ Walter ” Thumbprints of the “ Ma;rgery ” Seances 19
of several years, proved to be identical, and were considered to be
the thumb of “ Walter Four prints of a left thumb, also regarded
by the investigating group as that of “ Walter ”, were rendered in
1927. It is important to note that this attribution of identity was
not based on comparison 'with known prints of “ Walter ”, such
records not being available. The “ only evidence is the declaration
of the ‘ Walter ’ voice ” {Proc. A.S.P.R., xxii, p. 4). 2. Dudley reported in 1932 (Bull. XVIII, B.S.P.K.) that these
right and left thumbs, impressions of which had been accepted since
1926 as physical manifestations of the dead “ Walter ”, are identical
with the corresponding digits of the medium’s dentist, “ Kerwin ”.
3. An entire volume of Proc. A.S.P.R. (xxii, 1933) is professedly devoted to a reply to Dudley’s identification. With regard
to the right thumb, which is the only item considered here, it is contended by Thorogood in this volume that the thumbs of “ Walter ” and “ Kerwin ” are not identical. The present writer’s findings
to the contrary (see 1(a), p. 2) are cast aside, though published in
the report, while Dudley’s identification is dismissed with the claim
that the examples considered by him may be substituted prints
of “ Kerwin ”. Thorogood discusses at length the recently produced
(1932) whole hand prints of “ Walter ”. These right hand impressions, curiously enough, have the “ Walter ” = “ Kerwin ” thumb,
though they are unlike the right hand of “ Kerwin ” in other
particulars. (The left hand prints bear a thumb quite unlilve the
earher independent left thumbprints, and here again the explanation is advanced that the specimens used by Dudley are not authentic seance productions.)
4. In Bull. XXII, B.S.P.R., the present writer reviews the
identification, proving point by point that the items detailed by
Thorogood as supposed evidences of non-identity of these right
thumbs (allegedly representing “ Walter ” as opposed to “ Kerwin ”) are as a matter of fact only mechanical differences in the impressions,
or in some instances frank errors of determination. He discusses
certain patent evidences of artificiality in some of the “ Walter ”
prints and emphasizes : “ It is a simple process to make with dies
impressions such as these attributed to ‘ Walter ’, and any critical
evaluation of the finger-print and hand-print evidences must weigh
the possibilities of this operation agamst seance records offered in
proof of supernormal production of the prints ”. In August 1934, a visit in England afforded the writer an opportumty to examine the “ Walter ” prints which are here reported.
Of particular importance are the two examples made in 1929 at a
seance held in London, and these will be first discussed.
20 Harold Cummins : Notes on [partThe London Sitting of 7 December 1929 ^
The tablet from this seance first to be presented, in the possessionof Mr Harry Price, was examined on 3 August 1934, in the presenceof Mr Price and his secretary. At a later conference (7 August1934) Mr Price very generously permitted me to retain the wax ona long-time loan, so that I have been able since to make furtherexaminations with the facilities of my own laboratory, as well asto photograph it. Mr Price attests to the authenticity of the waxas the specimen which he obtained at the sitting, and the writeris confident that he will vouch further for the fact that the specimenas returned to him is the unaltered original and that the accom-panymg photographs are of this specimen, which is now again inhis own hands. The wax originally bore no inscription, being onlymarked at the seance by cutting notches at opposite edges ; at myrequest Mr Price made a notation (Plarry Price 7/8/’34) on thereverse surface, so that he might the more readily validate thespecimen on its return.
Figure 1 illustrates the obverse of the wax tablet, a whole slabof the Kerr impression compound with a single negative imprintof “ Walter’s ” right thumb ; the identifying notches are on theupper and lower edges, toward the right. Figures 2 and 3 are moreenlarged views of the imprint, photographed with different illuminations so as to bring out the delicate reliefs in contrasting appearances.Figure 2 rej)resents the more favourable view in depicting the truereliefs of this negative impression, while in Figure 3 the effects ofa different illumination are such as to lend a likeness to the reliefs of a positive. Because of this appearance Figure 3 is the moreinstructive for comparison with published reference prints of “ Kerwin ”. Fifteen representative details are indexed, using the numbersemployed by Dudley {Bull B.S.P.E., XVIII, Fig. 4 ; XXII, Fig. 6)
;
by comparison with Dudley’s illustrations the identity of these andadditional details will be apparent, and in the wax itself it is ofcourse possible to extend the comparison still further. Specialmention should be made of the fact that the core of this jmttern is a rod' (for discussion of the point see the summary).
It will be readily apparent that this “ Walter ” print is identicalwith the right thiimb of “ Kerwin ”. (Though the remaining sevenprints are not illustrated or discussed in detail, it should be made^ For reports of this sitting see : Crandon, Psychic Research, June 1930 ; Woolley and Brackehbury, Proc.

clear that their identification as “ Kerwin ” prints is based upon
exactly the same procedure of comparing details.)
The other tablet from this seance is in the custody of the S.P.R.,
where, as explained to the writer by Mr W. H. Salter, it has re- mained under conditions which guarantee the authenticity of the
specimen. It was inspected in the Society’s rooms on 1 August 1934,
in the presence of Messrs Salter and De Brath. The print is illustrated in Fig. 7, Bull. XXII, B.S.P.R., wherein Goadby
remarks (p. 72) that three experts of the Xew York Police Department certify to its identity with the right thumb of “ Kerwin ”
after examination of the photograph. Inscribed on the back of
the tablet, in pencil, is the notation : 7-12-29 in 34 31 (these letters
and figures following the date are not readily legible, and my
deciphering may be incorrect).^ The print itself is a clean-cut
impression, definitely a
“ Kerwm ” right thumb. The impression
has an mtact core, a rod.
The Hope Tablets ^
For my convenience the two tablets next to be mentioned were
deposited by the owner. Lord Charles Hope, in the S.P.R. rooms,
where they were examined on 1 August 1934, in the presence of
Messrs Salter and De Brath.
One tablet is inscribed : 10-3-29 2. It bears a typical “ Kerwin ”
print with a rod core. The second specimen, marked 10-3-29 3, bears two prints, a larger impression which is a typical “ Kerwin ” print with a
rod core, and a smaller which is smoothed and defaced in the central
pattern area (this one not being subjected to a critical analysis in
the absence of requisite technical aids).
The Baggallay Tablet ^
This impression, now in the custody of L.S.A., was brought to
the S.P.R. rooms by Mr De Brath, where it was examined on
1 August 1934, in his presence and that of Mr Salter. The tablet

^ The datings of these tablets are in error : the seance at which they were
obtained was that of 4 October 1929, instead of 3 October {Jour. A.S.P.R.,

the two pieces mounted in the frame. The obverse of the tablet
is inscribed : 5-11-29. It bears a single “ Kerwin ” print with arod core.
The Schiller Tablets ^
Three tablets in the possession of Prof. F. C. S. Schiller wereexamined at his home in Surrey, and in his presence, on 5 August1934:. Prof. Schiller recognises the identifying marks which hehad placed on the slabs prior to the sittmgs.
One tablet bears the incised marks : 9-9-29 4. It carries
two imprints. One imprint is a clearly defined “ Kerwin ” right
thumb, with a rod core. The second is an irregular impression,
beset with upraisings as if there had been sticking of the digit or
die in imprinting ; this pattern was not analysed in detail, thoughit is evidently a
“ Kerwin ” print.
A second tablet, inscribed 9-10-29, also carries two impressions.
One is a
“ Kerwin ” right thumb, its core showing the “ routing ”
defect which characterises the “ standard ” of Thorogood (for
explanation of this point see summary). The second impression
is of a juvenile digit (a loop), made, according to Schiller, after his
request (voiced at the previous sitting of 9-9-29) for the print of a child.
The thh'd tablet is marked : 9-11-29 7. This slab again
carries two prints. One prmt is a “ Kerwin ” right thumb. Its core is a rod and the impression shows no artifact characteristic
of Thorogood’s “ standard ”. The other imprint is that of a child, a loop which is definitely a different pattern from that of the
juvenile print of the preceding slab.
Summary
1. The eight “ Walter ” prints listed above, like other right
thumb prints ascribed to “ Walter ”, are identical with “ Kerwin’s ”
right thumb.
2. Examples obtained in the London sitting are of further
significance in showing that this identity cannot be explained awayon the theory (of Thorogood and others) that Dudley had confused
materials in his charge, madvertently or wilfully substituting knownSee Psychic Research, December 1929, and Psychic Science, April 1930.
139] “ Walter ” Thumbprints of the “ Margery ” Seances 23
“ Kerwiii ” prints for the seance productions. Mr Dudley did not
attend the London sitting, nor has he even seen the impressions
there produced ; these London prints are of authenticated seance
origin—and as noted, the prints are identical with the equally
authentic reference prints of “ Kerwin
3. Thorogood places much emphasis on the core structure of
what he terms the “ standard ” right thumb of “ Walter ”
; he
asserts that it is not a rod, the rod core being a feature of the
“ Kerwin ” right thumb. Among the eight “ Walter ” prints now
reported seven display this rod structure clearly and unquestionably,
while the exception (Schiller’s second tablet) bears a core corres- ponding to the “ standard ” of Thorogood. The distinction of
this “ standard ”, however, is merely a mechanical defect in the
print (as earher shown independently by Dudley and the present
writer) ; when the core in these impressions does not appear as a definite rod the area at the core head presents a depression in
the negative imprint, as from the effect of routing. Prof. Schiller’s
three tablets may be further mentioned in this connection. The
seance origin of these impressions being seemingly clearly established,
it is interesting to note that on three successive days “ Walter ”
produced prints m this order ; rod core—core with “ routing
defect ”—rod core. The occurrence of a single imprint with such
a
“ routing defect ” might be interpreted as due to some technical
mischance in printing, but since Schiller’s example is but one of
many “ Walter ” prints displaying precisely the same defect there seems to be just ground for suspecting the use of artificial dies (see
Bull. B.S.P.R., XXII). A die marked by such a defect would
obviously reproduce its imperfection in each printing, just as a
perfect die with an intact rod core would uniformly imprint that
feature.
4. It is not within the j^rovince of this account to discuss imphcations of the identity of the “ Walter ” prints. Dingwall ^ has
recently stated the situation ; “ The present controversy is not
so much on the supernormahty of the thumbprints as on then
nature. The material is ah-eady in existence. The prints are here ”. The prints speak for themselves in establishing the identification ; a sober view of the case must grant that this is a simple, concrete
issue, and one that cannot be evaded or obscured by fatuous
argument.

REVIEW
DR RHINE’S RECENT EXPERIMENTS ON TELEPATHYAND CLAIRVOYANCE AND A RECONSIDERATION OFJ. E. COOVER’S CONCLUSIONS ON TELEPATHY i
By Robert H. Thouless, Dept, of Psychology, Glasgow
University
Dr Rhine’s investigation on telepathy and clairvoyance possesses
several distinctive features.^ One of the most startling of his results
is the very large number of successes he had amongst his subjects.
Most of those who believed in the possibility of extra-sensory perception had supjrosed that it was rather a rare capacity. Byretesting his most successful cases, Dr Rhine has obtained so manypositive results that he has comjiletely got rid of the difficulty whichhas often been the bugbear of this kind of investigation, the possibility that a small preponderance of successful results might be
due to chance. He has evolved new experimental techniques for
the separate measurement of clairvoyance and telepathy. Mostimportant of all is the fact that his methods are so simple andhis results so clear that his experiments can easily be repeated,
and it will be possible without difficulty for other experimentalists to convince themselves whether Rhine’s conclusions are
valid or whether they are due to some flaw m his experimental
methods.
Dr Rhine himself is inclined to protest against the idea that
every new investigator in this field must set himself afresh the task
of proving the reality of extra-sensory perception, instead of being
allowed to consider that the matter has already been proved bypast researches. It must be remembered, however, that even
if the possibility of extra-sensory perception has already been
demonstrated, (which, whether rightly or wrongly, is by no
1 Read at a private Meeting of the Society, 30 January 1935.

[part 139] Review 25
means universally admitted) yet past experimentation seems to
indicate that the capacity is rather rare, so that any particular case of extra-sensory perception is still improbable and must
be examined very critically before it is admitted. This is particularly the case when we bear in mind how often flaws of
experimental technique have led to mistakes in this field in
the past. In any case, such a novel claim as that of measurable
telepathic and clairvoyant capacity in as many as one in three
or four persons must be regarded as intrmsically very improbable, by no means to be rejected if it is scientifically proved,
but as making necessary a very critical examination of the
procedure by which it is claimed to be proved and its careful
verification by other workers. If Dr Rhine’s results were established, it would make a revolutionary change in our attitude
towards this subject, bringing us near to S. G. Hall’s ideal
that telepathic phenomena should be reproducible at will at any
time in any laboratory.
Dr Rhine gives a summary of previous work in supjDort of his
contention that extra-sensory perception has been already proved.
Amongst other investigations he quotes that of Coover ^ as providing
positive evidence of extra-sensory perception. Since it is a common
opinion that Coover’s results were entirely negative and show
nothing but chance distribution, I have thought it worth while to
re-examine Coover’s figures and will discuss these before proceedmg
with Rhine’s own work.
Rhine is undoubtedly right in saying that Coover’s results
actually show strong evidence against chance. There seem to have
been two reasons why Coover himself drew the opposite conclusion :
first, he adopted an absurdly high limit for the deviation from
mean expectation which might be attributed to chance, and,
secondly, he did not consider the possibility that clairvoyance
might be active where telepathy was impossible.
In what follows I am considering only the results that he obtained
with 10,000 guesses by 100 students of 40 playing cards (a pack
without court cards) in wRich alone there w^ere sufficient observations for statistically valid conclusions to be drawn. These were
divided into two approximately equal groups : one in which the
card drawn had not been seen by the experimenter when the subject
guessed, and one in which it had. Coover, looking only for effects
of telepathy and not for those of clairvoyance, treated the first group as a control group in which the effect looked for was not

present and in which, therefore, chance factors alone were operating.
The following are Coover’s results :
Card. Colour. Number. Suit. Card not seen Observed 141 2,491 488 1,252
Total 4,865 Expected 12U 2,4321 4861 1,216
Difference + 19| + 581 + U + 36
Card seen Observed 153 2,556 538 1,344
Total 5,135 Expected 1281 2,5671 5131 1,284
Difference + 241 -iH + 241 + 60
The general tendency of both of these series is clearly to exceed
mean chance expectation, and in approximately equal amormts.
Coover concludes that since the factor of telepathy cannot be
present in the first series, the approximate equality of the two
groups is due to the fact that the deviations of both are due to
chance. A safer conclusion would seem to be that if any factors are present causing deviation from expectation, these are operating in
approximately equal amounts in the two conditions of experimentation. At any rate, we shall be justified in lumping the two
groups together for statistical consideration. For the remainder
of the discussion of these results, I shall do this since it will give us
the advantage of the higher significance to be obtained by larger
numbers.
The result of throwing the two groups together is as follows :
Card. Colour. Number. Suit. Total 10,000 Observed 294 5,047 1,026 2,596
Expected 250 5,000 1,000 2,500
Difference + 44 + 47 + 26 + 96
Probability of chance occur- rence of difference •005 •4 •4 •025
In statistical enquiry, chance is generally regarded as sufficiently
excluded if the odds against the chance occurrence of a result are
fifty to one. If the odds against chance are greater than this we
can conclude that the residt is indicated with sufficient probability
for rational acceptance, although of course our degree of conviction
will be greater if the odds against chance are heavier. If, however,
the conclusion to be established is a negative one, we shall not
consider the absence of an effect sufficiently indicated unless the
observed result would follow from chance alone at least once in
ten times. If the odds against chance lie between 10 to 1 and
50 to 1, the results are to be regarded as inconclusive and must be
repeated until there is a definite indication one way or the other.
139] Revmv 27
The difference between observation and mean chance expectation
of the number of cards guessed altogether right by Coover’s subjects
shows a probability of chance occurrence very much below this
limit, being 200 to 1 agaiust. The existence of some factor favouring
correct guessing of the cards is strongly indicated. It might be
objected that any form of extra-sensory cognition is a priori so improbable that we shall be right to insist on a much more severe
criterion of significance than we should need, let us say, if we were
tryiug to investigate the difference in fertihty of manured and
unmanured fields. To this objection, there are two replies. First,
the question at issue is not, at the moment, whether or not extrasensory cognition occurred amongst Coover’s subjects but whether
there was a factor in his experiments favouring correct guessing
(such a factor might be some unnoticed error of method). There seem to be no grounds for regarding the presence of such a factor as very improbable. A much more important consideration,
however, is that if we are convinced of the a priori improbability
of extra-sensory cognition, that will be a sound reason for accepting
the indications of a 200 to 1 odds against chance with less conviction
than we should otherwise feel ; it is no reason at all for regardmg
heavy odds against chance as evidence in favour of the operation
of chance.
Coover’s conclusion is, however, not a verdict of “ not proven ”. His conclusions are definitely negative : “ That various statistical
treatments of the data fail to reveal any cause beyond chance
operating for R cases (p. 123). . . . That no trace of an objective
thought-transference is foimd either as a capacity shared in a low
degree by our normal reagents ... or as a capacity enjoyed in
perceptible measure by any of the individual normal reagents
(p. 124).” These uncompromisingly negative conclusions are most
certainly not warranted by Coover’s data. It is true that he considered only the evidence from the cards seen by the experimenter since
these alone provided evidence for telepathy, but the odds against
chance for correct guessing of the whole card in these experiments
alone was about 30 to 1, which also cannot reasonably be regarded
as evidence in favour of the chance explanation.
Coover does, however, also submit his result to statistical analysis
but makes the excessive requirement that a result shall only be
deemed valid if the probabihty of it not occurrmg by chance exceeds
0-9999779, i.e. the odds against chance are about 50,000 to 1. For this, as Coover calculates, it would have been necessary to
have had 316 successes in the 100,000 trials instead of the 294
actually observed. If the same ratio of success had been main-
28 Review [part
tained, the required level of significance would have been reached
if the number of tests had been rather more than doubled. Coover’s
failure to go on is remarkable ; particularly his failure to make
further tests with those subjects scoring most highly above chance
expectation. His negative conclusion is indefensible on his own
evidence. How can one conclude from a probability of 200 to 1 against a chance explanation of the observed deviations that “ no
trace of an objective thought-transference is found ” ?
I have dealt only with those guesses in Cfiover’s results which
were completely right—in colour, number and suit—since these
alone show a high significance. That there is a lower degree of
significance discernible in the results calculated separately for colour,
number and suit is of no importance since we find that this is simply
due to the fact that if we eliminate those cases in which the card
was guessed completely right, the remaining cases for colour,
number and suit, show only chance distribution.^ That is, whatever
capacity the subjects had for guessing right, when it operated at
all, led to complete knowledge of the card and at other times all characters of the card were merely guessed at random. This is what the modern ex]3erimental psychologist would expect. Wedo not supj^ose that the recognition of a card involves separate
acts of perception involving colour, number and suit whose simultaneous activity gives comjjlete knowledge of the card, but rather
that total recognition of the card is a unitary process.
This leads to a principle of experimentation which it is well to
bear in mind. The general prmciple suggested is that whatever
character is used in this sort of experimentation, should have a mean chance expectation not so large that the exj:)ected chance
deviations from it will be big enough to swamp the deviations due

and 1/40 of the remainder guessed right by chance ; x will then be 45, the mean chance expectation from the remaining 9,955 being 249 (to the nearest whole number). The 45 known altogether correctly wiU, of course, be right
in colour, number and suit. Of the remaining 9,955, the following are the
number of right guesses of these characters observed and expected :
Colour. Number. Suit. No. expected - - 1,977^ 9954 2,489
No. observed - 5,002 981 2,551
Deviation - + 244 -144 + 62
Prob. of dev. - •6 •6 •15
In no case is the jjrobability of the deviation occurring by chance less than
one-tenth, so the results are consistent with all the observed successes (other
than the 45 completely right) being due to chance.
139] Revietv 29
to the cause under investigation. 50 successes above expectation
in 10,000 would, for example, be clearly significant in a character
whose mean chance expectation was 250, b\it would be quite
insignificant in one whose mean chance expectation was 50,000.
This means also that it is inadvisable to try to calculate a single
index (as has sometimes been done) taking into account successes
in different characters with different mean chance expectation, since
this may result in the swamping of real successes by chance deviations.
Rhine mentions that those subjects of Coover’s who did well in
the telepathy experiments also did well in the others (clairvoyance
conditions). If there were a significant relationship, this certainly
would be an important finding. It does not appear, however, that
the relationshi]) is any greater than might result from chance.
It is true that the one individual who did best in one set of experiments also did best in the other set, but if we work out a correlation
for the whole group or for the best eleven subjects, the correlation
is found to be -1 in both cases, and is quite insignificant.
Rhine says that most of the correct guesses in Coover’s experiments were made by a small number of people and that, if the answers of this small number are considered separately, they
become enormously significant. It is, however, clearly illegitimate
to select the best answers and then treat them by a method of
calculation appropriate to an imselected sample. We can, however,
compare the individual sets of guesses in which 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., are
right and compare it with the frequencies with which these would
be expected on the hy]3othesis of chance distribution. This will
be a more sensitive method of detecting a tendency to guess right
which is found in only a few individuals, than will be the method
which uses the mean obtained from the whole group.

30 Review [part
There is a clear tendency for some individuals to guess right
more often than is to be expected by chance. Also it is to be noticed
that the improbability of a chance explanation is seen to be greater
by this method of examining the results. One individual, for
example, has 11 right and the odds against this one case alone
occurring by chance amongst 200 subjects are more than 200
to 1. This table of frequencies suggests that about six of Coover’s
hundred subjects had measurable power of exceeding chance
exf^ectation in the guessing of playing cards. If extra-sensory
cognition is at work here, the number is greater, I think, than would
be commonly supposed although much below the number indicated
in Rhine’s exj:>eriments. There is some indication that whatever
power is measured may be widely diffused to a small extent, since
it is to be noticed that not only are there individuals guessing far
more right than is to be expected on the hypothesis of chance, but
also that the number guessing none right and one right is considerably less than to be expected from chance. The observed distribution is below expectation at the low end as well as above expectation at the high end. This is not merely the result of the fact that
the total number distributed on the curve of chance is decreased by
the few that have the power of guessing right to a marked degree,
since this number appears to be about six, and if the chance distribution were calculated for the remainder, it would mean only
that each of the “ expected ” values was reduced by 6 per cent,
which would still leave the zero end of the observed curve below
expectation. Unfortunately, however, the number of cases is not
large enough for it to be certain that this lowering of the zero end
is significant. We can only say that the curve as it stands suggests
a fairly wide distribution of a tendency to guess correctly in addition
to a well marked tendency in a small number of subjects.
The observed distribution is definitely not consistent with an
approximate equality of the tendency amongst all subjects, since
if we calculate the expected distribution about the observed mean
of 2-94, there are still significantly more high values than would
be ex]3ected (the odds against the occurrence of the one case of 11
would, for example, stiU be fifty to one on this assumption).
What is definitely proved, therefore, is that some subjects are guessing more often right than is to be expected on the hypothesis
of chance. The indication is that the number possessing to a marked
degree this ability (whatever it may be) is about six. There is also a possibility that the same ability may be present to a smaller
degree amongst a larger number of the subjects.
130] Eeview 31
Coover’s results, then, do not show chance distribution. Do they
contribute positive evidence for extra-sensory cognition ? The
results may be due to this or to some uncontrolled error in Coover’s
experimental conditions. If he had not been misled by the use of a too severe criterion of significance, he would presumably have
scrutinised and stiffened up his conditions to see whether the
effect would disappear. Presumably also he would have gone on
with the experiment imtil the probability against chance was
even greater than it is. If we think that the existence of extrasensory perception is probable on other grounds, we may regard
this as the most likely explanation of Coover’s results ; as independent evidence they are not of much value. Certainly they leave the
field open for a reinvestigation of the possibility of demonstrating
telepathy amongst normal people by card-guessing experiments.
One of the most important changes that Ehine makes in method
is the abandonment of playing cards as material and the substitution
of a set of five kinds of cards suggested by Dr Zener showing respectively a star, a circle, a rectangle, a cross and two parallel wavy
lines. A pack is composed of five of each of these, 25 cards altogether. There is a possibility that the greater ease with which he
got positive results than other experimenters using playing cards
is due to the superiority of these cards for this purpose. They are, for example, much more easily imaged than playing cards. Also,
instead of relyhig on average results for the large group of miselected
subjects, he selected those subjects for further investigation who
did well in preliminary tests. This method would, I think, be used
by any reasonable investigator who wanted to give extra-sensory
perception the best opportunity of demonstrating its existence.
Also he has devised methods for demonstrating telepathy and
clairvoyance either together or separately. If the experimenter
looks at a card, the subject may be guessing it correctly either by
clairvoyance or telepathy. If neither experimenter nor subject looks
at the face of the card, the subject is presumed to be getting it by
clairvoyance. If the experimenter thinks of a card and the subject
guesses it, it is presumed to be guessed by telepathy. The only
doubtful point here seems to be the demonstration of pure clair- voyance. If a card can be guessed correctly without either experimenter or subject having seen its face, obviously somebody must
be clairvoyant, but why the subject ? Is it not possible that the
experimenter knows it by clairvoyance and the subject gets it from him by telepathy ? This is a serious consideration when the
attempt is made to demonstrate pure clairvoyance at a great
distance. It seems more probable that the sidjject will be able to
32 Review [part
establish the necessary rapport with a mind many miles away than
with a pack of cards, and if the experimenter is present with the pack
of cards, his clairvoyance seems more likely than the subject’s.
We can best illustrate the kind of results obtained by taking a few typical results. The following are the results obtained with
the subject Pearce up to
Clairvoyance (removing

The first and third of these experiments were done by the methods
described above, the second by a particularly striking method in
which the whole pack was called through by the subject without
any cards being removed until the calling was complete (the D.T.
method). The last column shows the ratio of the deviation from
mean chance expectation to its own probable error, and is thus a measure of significance. The smallest of these ratios (9-5) means
odds against chance of over 1,000,000,000 to 1 ; the others even
higher. Chance, at any rate, is effectively eliminated.
Dr Rhine used an amusing variant of the usual method of experimenting when he asked his subjects to give the cards wrongly
instead of correctly. Extra-sensory perception was then of course
indicated by a score below instead of above mean chance expectation. An interesting point not noticed by Dr Rhhie is that an
examination of the results obtained by this method indicates a
falling below mean chance expectation greater than might be
expected from the positive scores of the same subject.
Let us suppose that the subject is able by some means (such as E.S.P.) to know 5 of the 25 cards. These he will name correctly,
and of the remaining 20 he will get 4 right by chance, so that his
total number right will be 9. Now suppose that he is trying to
name the cards wrongly. On the assumption that he will only be
certain of naming wrongly the same number of cards as he was
previously certain of getting right, and that his other answers will
be right or wrong l)y chance, the number he now gets right will be
four. Expressing this generally, if he knows m cards and his other answers are random, he will get m-}-(25 — m)/5 correct when he is trying to guess right and (25-m)/5 correct when he is trying to
guess wrong.
Now Pearce is said (p. 40) to have averaged about 10 correct
139] Review 33
when trying to guess right and about 2 when trying to guess wrong.
This gives a much higher value for m in the guessing wrong series
than hi the guessing right, 15 when guessing wrong and only a little over 6 when guessing right. We must conclude that whereas some
cards are well enough cognised to be correctly named, a much
larger number are less completely cognised and although the subject
cannot name them correctly, he can perform the easier task of
naming one of the four kinds that they are not. This is an interesting
point although, of course, it has no bearing on the main question
of the mode of cognition.
A curious result reported by Rhine is that forcing a subject to
go on when discouraged by failure seemed to make him score
significantly below mean chance expectation. This is odd since
it is, of course, necessary that the subject should have knowledge
of the cards in order to guess below mean chance expectation as
it is to guess above. He is no doubt right to speak of an inhibition
here. The first experiments reported on p. 62 are not conclusive
since Rhine made the curious mistake of not cutting the cards
between trials, apparently supposing that this would favour correct
scoring. Actually it would favour repetition of previous scores whether high or low,^ and makes the estimate of significance entirely
imreliable. Apparently, however, the later evidence was obtained
imder satisfactory conditions.
On page 86, a distance experiment is reported with Pearce in
another building over 100 yards away. In a clairvoyance, experiment with the cards removed from the pack for each guess the
following results were obtained in 12 runs : 3, 8, 5, 9, 10, 12, 11, 12,
11, 13, 13, 12. An average of 9-9 per 25. Dev./P.E. is here 12-1
and the odds are many billions against chance. There is also
reported a successful experiment over a distance of 250 miles by
two of Rhine’s collaborators. It is not clear, however, whether
this was properly checked by independent witnesses. Other very
long distance experiments were unsuccessful.
One last result may be mentioned. Pearce on one occasion had
25 successive right guesses in pure clairvoyance. The odds against
this occurring by chance are about 600 billion to 1 . This of course
is no better evidence than what has gone l)efore, but to some it may appear more impressive. Several other subjects gave results
which do not quite come up to Pearce’s standard but are also entirely
inexplicable on any chance hypothesis.
^ That is, on the hypothesis that there is a correlation between successive
series of calls by the same subject. In my own experiments I have found
that this is not uncommonly the case, c
34 Review [part
We need say no more abont the possibility of these results being
due to chance than that it is altogether excluded. Odds of a billion
to one against chance are really no better than odds of a million
to one. This is generally recognised by Rhine himself, although he
occasionally uses phrases which might lead to misinterpretation by
those not familiar with the limited purpose of statistical tests for
significance. For example, on page 67 he says : “ This makes the
odds in favour of the E.S.P. factor and against chance away up
beyond the trillions again and well into the zone of entire safety.”
It must be remembered that all that a statistical calculation of
significance can do is to measure the importance of one and only one
source of error—the possibility of wrongly concluding that a genuine
effect is ]jresent from a numerical deviation which is merely due
to the chances of samphng. The number of experiments must be
increased until this source of error is negligibly small compared
with all other possible sources of error. Beyond that point there
is no further gain in increasing results under identical conditions.
It would be a very optimistic view of any set of scientific experiments
to suppose that when the chance of being misled by a sampling
error was reduced to, let us say, 1 in 1,000, it was not negligibly
small compared with other sources of error. Yet Dr Rhine went
on accumulating results under identical conditions when this source of error was below one in billions. This unfortunate concentration on fantastic anti-chance ])robabilities seems to have
led him into paying quite insufficient attention to reporting the
precautions taken against other possible sources of error. When we ask whether the experimental conditions were suffi- ciently carefully controlled, we are met with the difficulty that it
is generally quite impossible to discover for any particular experiment what the experimental conditions were. Very commonlythe subject’s guesses were checked after each five guesses. Apparently this means that the subject was told what the correct figure
was on each of the previous five cards.
This procedure is oj^en to the objection that the subject’s knowledge of what cards have already been drawn gives him information
as to the changed probabilities of future drawings. Rhine makesthe curious mistake of supposing that this would only be effective
for the last five and only if they were all of the same suit. Actually
it coidd be effective any time after the first five were checked,
hlxcept in the very improbable case of all of the first five cards
l)eing different (the odds against which are about 15 to 1), it is theoretically ])ossible for the subject to raise his expectation of
chance success by being guided l>y what has already turned up.
139] Review 35
Let us suppose, for example, that one or two diagrams have not
appeared in the first five. If he consistently guesses these dining
the next twenty, his exjiectation of success during that twenty
will be five ; this added to the one chance success to be exjiected
during the first five exposure brings the total number to be expected
liy chance up to six. This, however, is on the supjiosition that
the suliject is guided by the first hve cards only. In fact, with this
method of experimenting, he has additional information from each
sulisequent five, and his expectation of chance success is increased
above six if he is guided in this way to an amount that is not known.
Dr Rhine has other replies to this possible criticism besides the
mistaken one already given. In grajih No. 3 (p. 137), the ratio of
successes by Pearce is shown separately for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.,
card in the whole series of 25 taken from a total of 1,375 trials by
this method. This graph shows clearly that even for the first five
cards, no less significant positive results were obtained than for
the others. Similar curves are shown for some of the other subjects.
This shows that this factor was not imjjortant for these subjects.
There remains the possibility that it may have been present for
others. Unfortunately it is not clearly indicated what series were
given by this method, so that for a considerable pro^iortion of the
subjects tested, there may have been an uncontrolled factor present
which might give a spurious indication of E.S.P. It is no doubt
necessary to keep subjects informed of their success, but it would seem to be a less objectionable way of doing this, simply to tell them when they have made right guesses without informing them
of what the cards were when they guessed wrong.
This, however, is a less serious objection to the method of checking
by fives than the fact that this seems to be an ideal way of teaching
subjects to recognise some of the cards from their liacks. This
last possibility is probably the most serious source of error in Dr
Rhine’s experiments. It might lie overcome by having a sufficiently
large number of packs and making successive tests of the same
subject with different packs. Dr Rhine apparently did have more
than one pack, Init it is not clear how often he took the precaution
of making successive tests of any one subject with different packs.
It is no answer to this criticism that successful results were obtained
with some subjects under conditions in which knowledge of their
backs would have been of no service to them (as, for example,
Pearce in the D.T. experiments). This proves that, at lea.st, a few
of his subjects were not succes.sful by this method. Indeed, there seems no reasonable doubt that if the D.T. experiments were
carried out exactly as described, with adequately shuttled cards
36 Review [partno other explanation than that of clairvoyance is possible. Wehave, however, plenty of other evidence in favour of the view that
extra-sensory perce])tion is to be found as a very exceptional
mental power. The novelty of Dr Rhine’s results lies in his apparent
demonstration that this power is not uncommon and it is here
unfortunately that his evidence is quite inadequately stated.
The conclusions as to frequency of the capacity from the data
reported in the present book are summed up as follows in a later
article.^ “ The best results are contributed by eight major subjects
who showed both clairvoyant and telepathic alhlity, at approximately similar rates of scoring for the two conditions. In addition
to these eight major subjects there were at least ten more minor
subjects who scored signihcantly high in clairvoyance or tele])athy.
Then there were others, (a majority) among the remaining fifty-nine
subjects tested who scored at a good rate, but over far too short a
series to be evaluated. There were only seven failures among those
who were tried out to the extent of 1,000 trials. ... It is safe to
conclude that extra-sensory perception is not so rare as has been
supposed, and on the basis of the proportions mentioned above
ought clearly to be found in at least one in every four persons, with
a higher ratio most probable.”
This is an extremely important conclusion. It is a pity that the
evidence for it is so inadequately reported that it is quite impossible
to get any idea as to whether the experiments on all of these subjects were carried out under critical conditions. If all or any
considerable ju’oportion of them were carried out with packs of
which the same suljjects had had previous experience by the method
of checking after each five, the conclusion would rest on a very
uncertain basis.
If Dr Rhine is to carry general conviction of the truth of his
finding as to the commonness of extra-sensory perception, it is absolutely necessary that he should state clearly how many of his
18 subjects showing extra-sensory capacity were tested under
critical experimental conditions. The minimum requirement for a critical experiment would seem to be : (A) that an experiment
in which the card is visible to the subject should never be carried
out by means of a ])ack of which the subject has previously seen the back of each card and been informed as to what was on its face ; (B) the sidqect should not be informed as to what cards have
))een drawn until the whole ])ack is completed ; and (C) the back
of the cards should not be visible to the subject at all unless it is
^ “ Telepathy and Clairvoyance in the normal and trance states of a
‘ Medium ’ ”, J. B. Rhine, Character and Personality, 1934, vol. iii. 94.
139] Review 37
absolutely certain that the hgure on the face has made no perceptible
modification of the surface of the back. It is quite impossible to
discover from Dr Rhine’s book how much of his evidence is derived
from experiments of this kind and it is entirely possible that even though one or two of his subjects had genuine extra-sensory power,
the others were getting successes through inadequate control of
the experimental conditions.
Another important conclusion is that the subjects who are good
at telepathy are also good at clanwoyance to about the same amount.
The evidence is shown in Table XLI on p. 148. Unfortunately the
evidence is not very good. The table shows results for seven
subjects (one of the major subjects being omitted) with a correlation
of -75 (calculated by the rank-difference method). Plainly no
conclusion can be drawn from a correlation between 7 subjects.
The data presented are no more than an indication of a conclusion
which may be established by examining a larger number of subjects.
It will be gathered that Dr Rhine’s procedure is by no means
free from objection, and that his presentation is open to the much
graver objection that the experimental methods are quite inadequately reported. This is a pity, since a little more care in reporting
and more careful discrimination between experiments obtained
under perfect and under imperfect conditions would have made
this work very much more convincing. It may be that all that
Dr Rhine reports is true, but much of his report will not carry much
conviction to those inchned to be sceptical. At least we may say
that Dr Rhine has shifted the burden of proof on to those who
deny that extra-sensory perception is a fairly common capacity.
If his results are to be tested it can only be by repetition of his
experiments. He has developed an easily applied technique, and
those who are not convinced may try the matter out for themselves.
It is to be hoped that there will be many carefully planned repetitions
of these experiments and that the results (positive or negative) will

ILXPERIMENTS IN EXTRA-8EN80RY PERCEPTION
A (iLANCE at Plianlasnis of the Living or tlie earlier Volumes ofProceedings will shew that the Society in its early clays devotedmuch attentioji to experiments in telepathy both wdth assessablematerial, such as hgures and ])laying cards, and with “ free ”material, in which the relation of success to chance probabilitycould not be exactly evaluated. During the greater part, however,of the Society's existence it seems to have been considered that theC[ualitative analysis applicable in experiments with “ free ” materialhad advantages outweighing the lack of quantitative precision. Infact the bulk of the experiments recorded between the early daysand the B.B.C. experiment of 1927 (Proc., vol. xxxviii) were with“ free ” material, as the B. B.C. experiment itself in part was. The results of these “ free ” experiments were interesting andinstructive, but there are undoid)tedly many persons who are not
impressed by ex])eriments unless the results are both measurable,
and also obtained under strict test conditions. A return, therefore,
to experiments with assessable material became desirable, andbetween October 1927 and July 1928 Mr S. G. Soal conducted a
carefully planned series of experiments with a large number of
percipients : see his pa])er on “ Experiments in (Supernormal Perception at a Distance ” in Proc., vol. xl. About the same time Miss
Jephson was conducting experiments in clairvoyance with playing
cards.
The results in both cases were mainly, if not wholly, negative, and
suggested a choice between three possible inferences : (1) supernormal ])erce])tion does not occur ; (2) it occurs, but percipients are
so rare that even Mr Soaks widely cast net failed to secure a specimen ; (3) it occurs, but is not amenable to the technique of assessal)le experiments under stilct conditions. The high percentage of success ol)tained by !)] Rhine in the exjxu'iments on which DrThouless comments, suggests that these three possil)le inferences maynot perhaps cover the whole field, and the results obtained in London
[part 139] An Appmlfor Co-operation in Further Experiments 39
by Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, an experienced investigator, and recorded
in the Society’s Journal for April 1935, point in the same direction.
The CoTincil consider it im])ortant that there should be further
experiments («) with assessal)le material, [b] under strict conditions,
and (c) in such a form as to distingui.sh between the different types
of extra-sensory perception. The Council have requested Mr Tyrrell
to conduct the new experiments, in which specially designed
apparatus will be employed. They hope that many readers of
Proceedings will consent to have their own supernormal faculties
tested, and invite any of them willing to co-operate in this way to
write to the Secretary of the Society.

A STUDY OP THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF
MRS. WILLETT’S MEDIUMSHIP, AND OF THE
STATEMENTS OP THE COMMUNICATORS CONCERNING PROCESS.
By Gerald William Earl or Balfofr, P.C., LL.D.
PART I
INTRODUCTORY
The lady whose identity is concealed beneath the name of Mrs
Willett is already known to readers of the Society’s Proceedings
as an autoniatist with remarkable powers. I need only refer
here to the important papers by Sir Ohver Lodge and Mrs
Verrall in volume xxv. of the Proceedings on Mrs Willett’s
“ Lethe Scripts ”, and to two papers of my own in volumes
xxvii. and xxix. respectively entitled, “ Some Recent Scripts
affording Evidence of Personal Survival ”, and “ The Ear of
Dionysius ”. The bulk of Mrs Willett’s automatic output is too private for pubhcation. The four papers above mentioned
relate, how’ever, to matters in the natm’e of episodes, separable
from the main themes of the scripts. To a very considerable
extent tliis also apphes to the subject of the present paper,
though there must still remain withheld from publicity a good
many passages which I would willingly have quoted by way of
illustration had it been open to me to do so. The materials for the account here presented of the jisychological aspects of IMi-s Willett’s mediumship have been derived
from three different sources of information. These are ;
( 1 ) Observation of the phenomena ab extra by the small group
of investigators, especially by those of them who have had
frequent sittings with the automatist.
(2) Mrs Willett’s own statements concerning the nature of
her experiences in the exercise of her faculty, whether such
statements were made during the actual course of automatic
43
44 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett: s Mediumship [part
production, or volunteered at other times when there could be
no doubt about her being in an absolutely normal condition.
(3) Dogmatic statements, for which the scripts alone are responsible, respecting methods and processes of communication.
Tt is upon the first and second of these sources of information
that I shall mainly, though not exclusively, rely in Part I. of
tlie present paper. The third will occupy our attention later.
The material here collected is not put forward either to provethe possession of supernormal powers by Mrs Willett or as
evidence of survival and of spirit communication. The possession of supernormal powers I take for granted, nor do I think
anyone will care to dispute it who has read the papers relating
to her scripts that have been already published in our Proceedings. Survival and the possibility and reality of spirit
communication are far more debatable questions. My personalbelief, arrived at after much study and reflection, leans strongly
in favoui' of an affirmative answer, and I have argued in this
sense in both the above-mentioned contributions to Proceedings
.
But 1 wish to make it clear from the outset that to establish
the reality of such communication is not the object of the present paper. All I ask is that its possibility should for the timebeing be treated as an open question.
It may be charged against me that in the pages which follow
the language used is not always consistent with leaving the
question open. No doubt for purposes of exposition and theljulk of what I have to say will be descriptive and expository
it is difficult to avoid adopting the dramatic standpoint ofscripts themselves, and speaking of tlie communicators as if they really were the departed sjjirits they profess to be. Sofar as the narrative is concerned, it would be impossible in anyother way to present a faithful picture of the observed andrecorded facts. If elsewhere the language employed seemssometimes to pi'ejudge the issue and undidy to favour thespiritistic interpretation, I can onlj^ say that this was notdone with intention. Convenience and simplicity of expressionmust be my excuse, and I must leave it to the reader to supplywhatever qualifications and reservations he may deem to benecessary.
It must be remembered that I am not undertaking to produce
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship 45
a treatise on mediumship in general, but only a study of the
psychological aspects of mediumship as exemplified in one
particular case. It would be impossible to do justice to the
argument in favour of spirit communication on the basis of
the Willett phenomena without violating confidences which
I am bound to respect. That is one consideration that weighs
with me in leaving this controversy on one side so far as may
be practicable, but it is not the only one. It seems to me that
an inquiry into the evidence for spirit communication must of
necessity carry one beyond the province of psychology proper ; and further I hold the view that our ideas concerning “ process
”
and the modus operandi of communication need not be seriously
modified howsoever the controversy be decided. What I mean
by this will be made clearer presently.
From the psychological standpoint it is now very generally
admitted that some sort of mental cleavage exists even in the
normal individual. In the phenomena of mediumship this
cleavage becomes pronounced. “ Supraliminal ” and “ subliminal ”, the conscious and the subconscious self, are terms
which have now passed into ordinary usage. They are generally
conceived of as being different levels, or strata, or phases, of one and the same personality. I do not think such descriptions
carry us very far. What these different elements of personality
really are, either in themselves or in their relation to each other,
remains a problem as obscure as it is deeply interesting. The
study of mediumistic phenomena is no less important for the
elucidation of the problem than is the study of dreams, hypnosis,
hysteria, hallucination, and multiple personality.
The type of mediumship which has attracted most attention
is that of which Mrs Piper is the most conspicuous example.
The medium lapses into a state of unconsciousness in which
all sense of her own personality is apparently lost, and her
conscious self is replaced by what claims to be an invading
personahty from the world of spu’it. Mrs WiUett is perhaps the
most remarkable instance on record of a difierent type, which,
although it has been on the whole less studied, seems to me to
be of at least equal or even greater interest. The characteristic
feature in her case is that, unlike Mrs Piper, the automatist
retains a consciousness of self during the whole process of
automatic production. Orthodox psychology may dismiss her
46 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [partalleged “ communications ” as merely subjective in the sense that all the factors producing them are to be found within thepersonality of the medium. To dismiss them as subjective in
any other sense than this is to leave altogether unexplainedthe kind of objectivity that belongs to them by virtue of their
appearing to the medium as communications—i.e. as having their
origin in something not herself. Any hypothesis that providesan adecpiate explanation of the sense of objectivity thataccompanies these communications must, I think, go at least so far as to ascribe them to the activity of some intelligence
sulficiently dissociated from the self that receives them to
produce in that self the impression that an alien agency is at
work, even though the two “ selves ” may normally be unitedto form a single personality.
I believe that interaction between dissociated selves belongingto the same bodily organism does, in fact, go a considerable waytowards explaining the phenomena of Mrs Willett’s mediumship. In some cases it may be the whole explanation. Observe,however, that it does not exclude, but is quite compatible with,
the rival explanation which regards the communicators as
distinct individual minds, ^ wholly independent of the mediumand unconnected with her bochly organism, but interactingwith her mind telepathically.
My own view is that there is truth in both explanations,
that communications may be received in some cases from adissociated self, in other cases from an external agent, in others,
again, from both agencies acting in co-operation.
The distinction between independent minds and temporarilydissociated intelligences or “ selves ” must, of course, be ofgreat importance from many points of view, and of vast andvital importance if the independent minds are held to be dis-
' Tlie expression “ distinct individual minds ” covers both incarnate anddiscarnate minds. But so far as Mrs Willett’s automatic jiroductions are concerned it is to all intents and purposes the discarnate that I have here in view. Instances in which it is reasonable to conjecture that her scripts oweanything to information supemormally imparted by or acquired from either the sitter or any other mcamate mind are in my opinion so rare as to be
practically negligible. I believe, however, that they do occasionally occiu- ; and the possibility should never be lost sight of. The existence of telepathic
communication between Mrs Willett and Miss Alice Johnson is the subject of the tranco-.script of May 11, 1912, parts of which are quoted on 102 below.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumshiji 47
carnate spirits. But must distinctions which hold good between
chfferent classes of communicators necessarily imply corre- sponchng chlferences in the modus operandi of communication ? Let A and B be chssociated selves connected with the same
physical organism, and let C be an independent mind, whether
incarnate or chscarnate. If A or B receive a message from G
otherwise than through the recognised channels of sense we call
the communication telepathic. If A receive a communication
from B otherwise than through the recognised channels of sense which appears to A to come from a source other than himself,
by what process is the communication conveyed ? I do not
think Myers ever sufficiently faced this question. My answer
would be that here also the process is telepathic ; and that if telepathy be, as I believe it to be, a direct interaction of mind
with mind, it matters little qua process, whether the communicator be an independent external mind or a dissociated self of the
mechuni. It is this conception of “ process ” that constitutes
my justification for suggesting that, as regards the psychological aspects of mediumistic phenomena, at all events in Mrs
Willett’s case,i the question of the reality of spirit communication may, without detriment to the inquiry, be left an open one. In my Presidential Address to the S.P.R. for the year 1906 ^
I put forward the idea that the human individual is an ordered
association of psychic units, or centres of consciousness, telepathically interconnected. I cannot pretend that the idea has
met with any general acceptance. It has, however, received
the powerful support of Professor William McDougall, who
adopted it in his Presidential Address to the Society for the
year 1920,^ and has once more emphatically maintained it in
his Outline of Abnormcd Psychology

I still look upon it as a
^ The case of Mrs Piper and other mediums of a similar tyjDe raises considerations of a somewhat different order, although here also I see no reason to suppose that there is any essential distinction, so far as process is concerned,
between “ possession ” of the organism by an invading spirit—if such a thing can really take place—and “ possession ” by a dissociated self ; or that in either case the modus operandi is different from that of the familiar but wholly
mysterious control exercised over the organism by the normal self.

simplifying and unifying hypothesis which may help to explain
much that is mysterious and perplexing in the region of
Psychical Research. To what extent it is either confirmed or invalidated by the accoimt of Mrs Willett’s mediumship given
in the following pages it will be for the reader to judge.
F'or the rest the Willett scripts will be found to provide a
fidler and more ambitious attempt to explain the modusoperandi of communication in her own case than any automatic
productions with which I am acquainted. Whatever view wetake of the “ communicators ”, and whatever value we mayattach to their statements, I shall be disappointed if students
of the subject fail to find in some part of the matter now for the
first time submitted to them much that is both ilhiminating and
suggestive.
In concludiiTig these introductory remarks, let me say that
1 make no attempt in what follows to approach the subject of
my j)aper from any other than the purely mental standpoint.
For this 1 offer no apology. I do not contend that the interaction of mind and body has no bearing upon the questions to
be discussed. But the phenomena with which I am specially
concerned relate not to the interaction of mind with body, but
to that of mind with mind, and I do not believe that much light
is likely to be thrown upon them by attempts to correlate
thought with brain function. The doctrine of psycho-physical
parallelism 1 am unable to accept in any form.
CHAPTER I
STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
In her early girlhood Mrs. Willett discovered that she possessed
the power of automatic writing, but, having no one to guide or advise her, she soon gave up the practice of it. In the second
half of 1908 circumstances into which I need not enter led to a renewal of her interest in the subject. A correspondence with
Mrs Verrall ensued, and in August and September of that year
she read the then recently published Report by Miss Johnson
on Mrs Holland’s script, and felt an impulse to try for scri]A
herself. Of her first essays she gives an interesting account in a
letter to Mrs Verrall dated October 8, 1908 ;
After a few feeble attempts [she writes] the script seemed to
come very rapidly, but it is too definite, and therefore I distru.st
its being from an external source. There are, however, one or two curious points in it (I have torn it all up). What worried
me was the words seemed to form in my brain before the pen set them down, just before, as if tripping on the written word—
a
sort of hair’s-breadth beforeness.^ Most are signed Myers or
F. W. H. M., but I can’t say I think them of value. . . .
The first recorded script dates from October 9, and from that
time records were regularly kept. We may therefore say that in
the case of Mrs Willett, as in that of Mrs Verrall, Mrs “ Holland ”,
Mrs Salter, Mrs Wilson and Mrs ‘ ‘ King ’
’ (Dame Edith Lyttelton)
,
we have a practically complete history of her mediumship from
its inception onwards. The history of Mrs Willett’s automatic
activities has, however, a peculiar interest arising from the fact
that it exhibits a marked course of development not found, or at
least not found in equal degree, in the scripts of the other five
I have mentioned. The different stages of this development I
will now try to describe.
^ Compare the experience of a friend of Henry Sidgwick, recorded in Human
rersonality, v'ol. ii., p. 123. 49
50 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'’ s Mediumship [partDuring the first stage the communications reach the automatist when she is alone, and in a condition normal or hardlyto be distinguished from the normal. They take the form ofautomatic script in a hand different from Mrs Willett’s ordinaryhand-writing.^ Biit it does not appear that the act of writingis fully automatic in the sense that the hand seems to be movedfor her by some external influence and without her co-operation—though something of the kind did apparently occur on oneunique occasion (see pp. 123-4 below). According to her ownaccount the words seem to form in her brain “ a hair’s-breadth ”before she sets them down ; biit this does not mean that hermind anticipates the sense of what is coming, but only eachindividual word as it comes. As to her recollection, when thescript is finished, of what she has written, it is not easy to formany ])recise estimate, and probably the extent of it varies considerably. I have no doubt, however, that she remembersmuch more than Mrs Verrall was able to do of her own script(see p. 68 below).
The second stage begins early in January 1909. Mrs Willetthad been anxious about her son’s health.
I was at dinner, she records, when I felt strong impression ofF. W. H. M. scolding me. I can’t explain—but I felt disapprobation and felt it coming from him, and that he was wishing me toknow that there was no need for any anxiety. I had the impression that he was conveying to me that if I doubted the impression I was receiving I was to try for script after dinner. I wasquite normal. I was silent, I suppose, for a few minutes, but I continued my dinner and later—8.40—did try for script, whenthe following came ; “ Myers yes write now no cause for any anxiety noneyes let him go back to school no anxiety.”
In this incident rve have the first attempt to convey a message otherwise than by automatic writing. A more deliberateattempt followed a few weeks later :

Gurney yes
{Here I left off writing and held a sort of imaginary conversation
with E. O. . . . I ivas perfectly riormal.)
A fortnight later Myers ^ writes (Feb. 14, 1909) :
... I am trying experiments with you to make you hear without writing therefore as it is I Myers who do this deliberately
do not fear or wince when words enter your consciousness or subsequently when such words are in the script. On the con- trary it will be the success of my purpose if you recognise in yr. script phrases you have found in your consciousness. 1 know
this must be for a while disconcerting and be filled with the fear
of that eternal S.S. [subliminal self"\ which I hope we have suc- ceeded in dethroning to some extent. Therefore be agreeing to
be disconcerted and do not analyse whence these impressions
which I shall in future I’efer to as Daylight Impressions,—come
from, they are parts of a psychic education framed by me for
you. . . .
Mentally received communications of this kind, that are consciously apprehended, and either noted down at the time or subsequently remembered and recorded, I shall describe as
Silent B.I.s {D.I. being the abbreviation habitually used by the
communicators for Daylight Im/pression)
,
in order to distinguish
them from Spoken D.I.s, in which the messages as they come
are repeated aloud by the automatist in the presence of a sitter.
Some confusion has arisen from the use of the term D.I. to
describe both silent D.I.s and spoken D.I.s. The silent D.I.
doubtless served to prepare the way for the spoken D.I., but
^ Compare with this the First Holland Report, Proc., vol. xxi., pp. 186, 232,
which Mrs Willett had seen. Mrs King habitually records in this way when she is not dictating to a sitter.
^ I give to the communicators the names they claim, and have not thought
it necessary to add the cautionary suffixes and describe them as Myers w, Gurney anti so on. The reader will understand that I am not thereby
assuming the rightfulness of the claim.
52 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mednimship [pabt
the spoken D.I. belongs, as we shall see, to a later stage of
development.
The term silent D.I. might be used to cover every kind of
impression presumably telepathic but not contemporaneously
externalised either in automatic writing or in automatic speech.
In practice, however, I shall confine it to definitely worded
messages, or at least to cases where such messages form part of
the experience. Impressions of a vaguer character, of which
there are many varieties ranging from the sense of a “ presence
” down to a mere unexplained impulse to action of some kind, are not included under this heading.
Mrs Willett’s own account of her experience in two instances
makes clear the nature of the phenomenon :
{Extract from a letter to Mrs Verrall dated February 18, 1909)
Last night ... I was sitting idly wondering at it all . . . when
I became aware so suddenly and strangely of F. W. H. M.’s
presence that I said “ Oh ! ” as if I had run into someone
unexpectedly. During what followed I was absolutely normal.
I heard nothing with my ears, but the words came from outside
into my mind as they do when one is reading a book to oneself.
I do not remember exact words, but the first sentence was “ Can
you hear what I am saying ? ”—I replied in my mind “ Yes
Again in a letter received by Mi-s Verrall on September 27, 1909,
with reference to a previous silent D.I. Mrs Willett writes :
I got no impression of appearance, only character, and in
some way voice or pronunciation (though this doesn’t mean
that my ears hear, you know !). That is always so in D.I.
[i.e. in silent D.I.]. I don’t feel a sense of “ seeing ”, but an
intense sense of personality, like a blind person perhaps might
have—and of inflections, such as amusement or emotion on the
part of the speaker. If you asked me how I know when E. G.
is speaking and not F. W. H. M., I can’t exactly define, except
that to me it would be impossible to be in doubt one instant
and with E. G. I often know he is there a second or two before
he sj:)eaks. ... I then sometimes speak first. ... To me, by
now, there isn’t anything strange in D.I.s except when I try
to explain anything about them ; then I realise suddenly they
are unusual ! But otherwise it gives me no more sense of odd-
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 53
ness to be talking to these invisible people than it does to be
talking to my son for instance. But I don’t think I mentally
visualise any sort of “ appearance ” with regard to them—it
is as “ minds ” and “ characters ” that they are to me, and yet
not at all intangible or not-solid realities. . . .
It should be noted that these early methods of communication, namely by means of lone scripts or silent D.I.s, have never
fallen into disuse. The further development which we have to
trace consists in the addition of other and supplementary
methods.
The next new departure dates from the time when Mrs
Willett, at the special request of the communicators, consented
to “ sit ” with another person present—in the first instance with
Mrs VerraU, and a little later with Sir Oliver Lodge. At these
sittings both script and D.I.s were produced, but from the nature
of the case spoken D.I.s took the place of silent D.I.s, the
automatist repeating the message out loud and the sitter either
taking notes or recording verbatim. As a rule a short introductory script preceded speech, but this ride was not observed on
the occasion of the first “ sitter-sitting ” and has been departed
from once or twice since. During the period of which I am now
speaking script written in the presence of a sitter and not
followed by a D.I. was also rare, though at a later time it became fairly common.
Throughout the remainder of this paper the term “ D.I.”
unaccompanied by an adjective is to be taken as meaning
spoken D.I. Where silent D.I. is meant it will always be
expressly so described. The use of the term “ script ” to apply
both to “ lone script ” and to script produced in the jmesence
of a sitter is not likely to give rise to confusion. But I must
bespeak the indulgence of my readers if I often employ the con- venient phrase “ the scripts ” to cover the whole automatic
output, and not merely that part of it which takes the form of
writing.
Even more important than the introduction of a sitter, and
closely connected with it, was a gradually increasing tendency
on the part of the sensitive to pass into a condition of “ daze ”
or partial unconsciousness.^ She had sometinies experienced
^ The comiruinieators claim to have power to induce varying degrees of daze
in the automatist.
54 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part
a feeling of daze even when alone and had, with an effort, pulled
herself together in order to avoid “ going off.” Failure to
retain normal consciousness would probably make the continu- ance even of script impossible for any length of time, unless
someone were there to look after the supply and disposition of
WTiting materials. For the recording of a spoken D.I. the
presence of a sitter is obviously indispensable. I do not suppose
that Ml’S Willett sitting entirely alone could ever have become a
trance -medium. This consideration was, 1 believe, the motive
of the communicators in lU’ging her to agree to sittings with an
“ experimenter in charge ”. At all events, whatever the
influences which led to the new departure, they certainly did
not have their source in Mrs Willett’s normal inchnations. She
was far from welcoming the experiment of sitting even with a
friend like Mrs Verrall, still less with Sir Oliver Lodge, whomshe met for the first time on May 17, 1909. Any idea that she
might lose consciousness in the process would have made her
still more reluctant.
The first suggestion of a D.I. in the presence of a sitter (Sir
O. J. L. was mentioned by name) came in a script from Myers
of April 13, 1909, and the exj^eriment was first actually tried
on May 21, about five weeks later. The sitter was Mrs Verrall,
and this is her contemporary record of the ?nise en scene : On May 19, 1909, I called on Mrs Willett . . . and had some
general talk. It was arranged that I should see her again on
the morning of May 21. When I arrived on May 21, she said
almost at once that F. W. H. M. wanted to speak to me, and
thereupon I was witness of the first “ D.I.” in which Mrs Willett
repeated aloud the impression she received. I had made no
preparations and could only take very brief notes. . . . Mrs
Willett sat at some little distance from me near a table. . . . She
rested her elbows on the table and her face in her hands for a few moments ; then lifted her head, keeping her eyes shut, and
spoke as if in answer to someone, saying that she could hear
and would repeat. She then spoke slowly aloud, without the
“ He says ” which is characteristic hr later developments, and
with very much less freedom than I have observed since.
There is nothing either in this account or in the record of the
D.I. itself to suggest that Mi’s Willett was in anything approach-
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'' s Mediumshi]} 55
ing a state of trance, though some abnormality may fairly be
suspected.
Next day a message came in script from Myers to say that he
was satisfied with the results obtained, but did not intend to
repeat the experiment for some time to come. Accordingly no
further attempt at a spoken D.I. was made until January 1910.
On the 27th and 28th of that month, and again on April the 5th,
sittings took place with Mrs Verrall as recorder. No loss of
normal consciousness is noted by the sitter on any of these
occasions, but towards the end of the first sitting the communicator, addressing the sensitive, says to her, “ You are getting
dazed. Don’t be agitated.” Some of the phrases used in the
course of the sitting were remembered by Mrs Willett after it was over—a sure indication, in my opinion, that the “ dazed ”
condition still fell far short of anything hke deep trance.
The communicators had several times indicated a desire for a
D.I. with Sir Ohver Lodge. Opportunity was found to satisfy
the desire in May 1910, when a series of three sittings took place
in his presence (May 1, 6, and 21). In the second and third of
these an undoubted departure from normality occurred, and
probably this was the case in the first also, though to a less
degree. In the second of the series the D.I. is opened by
Gurney saying, “ Tell Lodge I don’t want tins to develop into
trance. You have got that, we are doing something new. Then
he says telepathy ” ; and the sitting closes with the following
exphcit statement : “You can tell Lodge that you are not
unconscious or too dazed to know who you are, what you are, and, as each word comes, what you say. That’s aU. Good-bye.”
I beheve this remark of Gurney’s, though it has only the
authority of the communicator to vouch for its truth, does
fairly represent the mental condition of the automatist at the
time. It was a condition of partial trance. And this is con- firmed by what follows. The recorder notes that after the word
“ Good-bye ” was spoken, “ for about a minute Mrs Willett
continued wfith her eyes shut. Presently she said, speaking to
herself, ‘ Pull yourself together and open your eyes and wake
yourself up ’. She then came to, and looked about her.” Sir
Ohver apparently took this injunction as having been addressed
by the automatist to herself. I think she is only repeating the
words of Gurney, who retmns, as it were, for a moment in order
5() Psychological Aspects of Airs Willetfs Alediumship [partto bring her back to normal consciousness. Probably we maysee in this incident the rudiments of a waking stage.
Trance is, of course, a difficult term to define, nor is it easy inany given case to determine the point at which partial hasmerged into deep trance. When, however, the communicatorstell us that they do not desire trance in Mrs Willett’s case, wemust recognise that they are using the term in a very narrowand restricted sense. By “ trance ” they mean trance d laPiper ; and, as vdll appear in the sequel, they are emphatic indistinguishing between Willett phenomena and Piper phenomena. The distinction, as they see it, is so carefully observedthat I doubt whether in the whole of the scripts it would bepossible to find more than one example of the use of the wordtrance to describe the Willett phenomena. I am bound to saythat such a limitation of the term seems to me both inconvenient and misleading. From 1911 onwards I have witnessedmany D.I.s, and I certainly should not hesitate to accept themas belonging to the order of genuine trance.
W’liat 1 have described as the third stage in Mrs Willett’smediumistic development is essentially a period of transition.It begins with the first introduction of a sitter, in May 1909.Its course is a progress towards deeper and deeper trance. It is perhaps rash to try to determine with precision the point atwhich really deep trance makes its first appearance. But ifI were pressed to fix a date I should be inclined to nameSeptember 25, 1910. There had been two long sittings forscript followed by D.I., one on September 22 and another onSeptember 24, with Sir Oliver in charge, at both of which theautoniatist had been in a state far removed from normal. Itwas contrary to the rule laid down by the communicators toattempt D.I. on two days in succession, and the original intention seems to have been that the sitting on the 25th should, inspite of the presence of a recorder, be for script only—probablyfor script unattended by any change of consciousness. At theoutset the autoniatist appeared to be quite normal, but thescript had not proceeded far when signs of trance began to benoticeable. The sitter’s attention was called to what washappening by the communicator himself—in this instance
UO] PsychohyicaJ Aspect’'^ of Mrs Willett's Mediumship o7
Gurney. The account of what ensued I quote from Sir Oliver’s
record :
[Script]. She is very dazed Look (0. J. L. looked and saw her
apparently slightly entranced, so he said, “ Ought I to wake her
up ? ”)
^
[Script]. I will I don’t want her to develop into a second
Piper
{The way in which the hand imndered over the paper was no^v
reminiscent of Piper conditions. O. J. L. said, “ No, I know
you consider we have had that and that now you are arranging
something different ”.)
[Script]. New.
{Then Mrs W. ivoke up, or rather went through a quite brief “ linking stage ”, saying, “ He said that’s all now, I’ve
arranged it all with Lodge ” {waking up more). “ Have you
had a D.I. ? ”)
{O.J.L. No, only script.)
Why do I feel as if I had had a D.I. ?
{0. J. L. I suppose because you were a little more dazed than
usual ; you have done quite a fair amount of script.)
{Mrs W. was now normal. On te.sting her slightly it appeared
that she remembered none of the script after the early portion.)
It will be observed that this contemporary record uses language implying that the automatist was only “ slightly
entranced ”, “ a little more dazed than usual ”. I suspect that
Sir Oliver was misled by his knowledge that the communicators
did not want “ trance Failing—as I think all the investigators at that time failed—to realise that the “ trance ” which
they deprecated was hmited to the strictly Piperian variety, he
would naturally be slow to recognise that, in the wider and more
usual sense of the term, the automatist was deeply entranced
already. “ Slightly entranced ” seems a very inadequate
description of a sensitive who wakes up in the belief that she
had had a D.I. when nothing of the kind had happened.
I give for what it is worth the conclusion to which a close
study of the Willett scripts has led me. The communicators
more than once claim that they are putting Mxs Willett through
a systematic training in mediumship. I believe that, far from
not desiring trance in the wider acceptation of the term, they
E
58 Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willett’s Alediumship [part
were bent from the outset on ediicating her to become a trancemedium, but a trance-medium of a new kind. The training
process had to be gradual, and the word trance was avoided,
pai'tly perhaps from fear of alarming her and provoking a
resistance which might frustrate their plans, but also to markthe im])ortance which the communicators attached to the
contrast between Piper phenomena and the new variety of
mediumship which they aimed at developing.
Let me at this point briefly recapitiilate. In the first period
of Mrs Willett’s mediumship lone scripts were the sole methodof communication. The second period is marked by the introduction of the silent D.I. As a ride no obvious disturbance of
normal consciousness accomj^anied either of these processes.
In the third period silent D.I.s and lone scripts continue as before ; but a combination of script and spoken D.I. with a
recorder XR’esent comes into prominence as something new. In
the course of these sittings the autoniatist develops a tendency
towards trance, liardly noticeable at first but becoming progressively more and more marked as time went on. As we have seen, a conchtion of deeji trance was jDrobably
reached for the first time on Sejitember 25, 1910, but only
towards the end of the scrijit, and no D.I. followed. Betweenthat date and May 24, 1911, only one “ sitter -sitting ” took
])lace. It resulted in the usual type of combined script and D.I.;
but so far as can be judged the automatist was not deeply
entranced and there was no waking stage. A condition of deep
trance maintained tlu’ough both stages of a sitting was not, in
my opinion, reached until May 24, 1911.
With the jiossibility of trance communication now firmly
established the fourth and final period is entered. After nearly
three years of training Mi-s Willett’s mediumship has reached
matui'ity so far as form is concerned. From now onwards no
new dejiarture of primary imjiortance remains to be noted,
though there was considerable variety of practice in the emjiloyment of the different forms of communication at chfferent times.
The combination of trance-script followed by D.I. as initial andsecondary stages of the same sitting is freely resorted to up to
July 1912. An interval of u])wards of eighteen months ensued
during wliich no spoken D.I. was attemjDted. Regard for the
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medivmship 59
health of the medium was probably the determinmg consideration ; for the greater strain on the vitality of the medium
involved in spoken D.I. as compared with script is fully recognised by the communicators. To compensate for the temporary
loss of spoken D.I., scripts written in the presence of a sitter
become comparatively common. The condition of the automatist during some of these sitter-sittings tends to pass into
trance of varying depth. The writing is sometimes interrupted,
and the sitter requested to take down a passage from dictation.
A return was made to the regular combination of script and
D.I. (but with occasional interpolation of written passages in
the D.I.) in February 1914, and use continued to lie made of
this type of sitting up to August 19, 1915. Since that date there
has been only one example of it, and its place seems to have
been taken by trance -scripts in the presence of a sitter not
followed by D.I. I do not think that this change carries with it any important significance. Probably the D.I. condition
implies, on the whole, a deeper trance than is often reached in the
trance-script ; but the same ends are served in both, namely (1)
to get rid of the checks and inliibitions of the normal consciousness, and (2) to enable messages to be conveyed to the sitter of
which the automatist is to be kept ignorant. I may here add
that, where these objects are not in view, communications
made by way of lone scripts do not seem in quality and interest
to fall short of those conveyed in trance.
Some Compaeisons
No account even of the external characteristics of Mrs
Willett’s mediumship would be complete which failed to note
certain features that differentiate it from that of mediums of
the type of Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard. Some of these will
engage our attention more closely when I come to deal with the
phenomena in the light of statements made by the communicators themselves. For the present our concern is rather with
such contrasts as are apparent to the observer from outside.
One obvious point of difference is that Mrs Piper and Mrs
Leonard are essentially trance-mediums, whereas Mi’s Willett’s
automatic faculty is active in every phase of consciousness
from normahty to deep trance. But the most striking
fiO P.si/chological Aspects of Mrs WiUetf's Mediuniship [part
point of difference is the absence in Mrs Willett’s case of
anything corresponding to the Phinuii, or the Rector, of MrsPiper, to Ml’S Thompson’s Nelly, or to the Feda of Mrs Leonard.
Mrs Willett always appears to be in direct touch with her trancepersonalities, though occasionally one of them may be found
helping or speaking for another who is represented as less
exjierienced or as having less aptitude for communication. It is true that certain of the trance-personalities of Mrs Piper or Mrs
Leonard, like “ G. P.” or “ A. V. B.”, or the father and the sister
of Mr Drayton Thomas, also purport to communicate directly
without the intervention of a Phinuit or a Feda respectively.
But here again there is an important distinction. It is Mrs
Willett herself, in propria persona, who is in touch with the
communicator. Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard when in trance
seem to lose all sense of their personal identity, whereas, so far as the observer can judge, this is never the case with Mrs
Willett. Her trance sittings abound with remarks describing
her own experiences at the moment, and occasionally she will
make comments, not always complimentary, on the messages
she is asked to transmit. The communicator often addresses
her directly, and she him. Even when the communicator,
speaking in the first person, refers to the automatist as “ she ”
or “ her ”, interspersed phrases like “ He says ” reveal that she
is all the time conscious of herself and of her part as a reporter.
iSid^tle questions may no doubt be raised concerning the exact
relation of the “ I ” of the Willett scripts to the normal “ I ” of
the sensitive ; but any distinction between the two “ I’s ”
discernible to the observer leaves them still both identified with
the same personality. IVL’s Willett’s trance sittings generally
end in a “ waking stage ” like Mrs Piper’s. In the waking
stage Mrs Piper regains her consciousness of self, and this, even
apart from any change from writing to speech, clearly marks
it off from the stage which precedes it. Mrs Willett, on the other
hand, retains a sense of personality throughout, and in the case
of trance D.I.s, where no change from writing to speech helps to
mark the transition, it is sometimes hard to say just where the
D.I. ends and the waldng stage begins.
Another point of contrast between Mi’s Willett and professional mediums like Mrs Piper and IVIrs Leonard lies in the
widely different conditions under which they work. Sitters
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 61
with Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard have been, from the nature of
the case, many and miscellaneous ; and the comnnmicators,
purporting for the most part to be deceased relations and
friends of the sitters, have been correspondingly many and
miscellaneous. Mrs Willett’s scripts—using that term in its widest meaning to include all her automatic records—have been
produced in a wholly dissimilar atmosphere. Those who have
actually had sittings with her are very few in number—some half
dozen or so—and, speaking generally, their object has been a
purely disinterested study of what the scripts have to say. In
this they have been assisted by another and equally small grouj)
of investigators to whom the scripts have been shown. All of
these are intimately known to the automatist and pledged to
respect her anonymity, and to treat the records as private and
confidential except so far as she may decide otherwise. A considerable proportion of her automatic output she has never seen
herself, for records of her trance sittings have been in the past
systematically withheld from her. Her consent was, of course,
required for the publication of the present paper, and many of
the passages from the scripts quoted or referred to in it have
never until now come within her conscious knowledge.
As the number of sitters with Mrs WiUett has been strictly
limited, so also the personahties professing to communicate
through her form a very smaU group. Myers and Gurney were
the earliest, and for a considerable time the only communicators,
but certain others have been added since, including Henry
Sidgwick, S. H. Butcher, A. W. Verrall, and one whose real
name is concealed from her but whom she knows as the Dark
Young Man. Some at least of my readers will have no difiiculty
in identifying him. Indeed I should be surprised if ]\Irs
WiUett herself, to whom the first draft of my paper was shown,
has not now realized who he is, though she has not volunteered
any statement to me on the subject. Another important figure
among the dramatis personae is that of a lady who died in early
youth more than fifty years ago. She will be referred to in this
paper as “ the young lady in the old-fashioned dress ”. Her
family name never appears in the scripts, and the normal Mrs
Willett has probably never heard of her existence. These all play their part, not as isolated individuals but as members of a band working together with a common pm’pose. Theii’ co-
02 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'’ s Mediumship [partoperation gives to the Willett scripts a unity which it would beidle to look for in the automatic utterances of Mrs Piper andMl’S Leonard, but which, we are not without ground for behoving, embraces also the scripts of Mrs Verrall, Mrs “ Holland ”,
Mrs Salter, the “ Macs ”, Mrs “ King ” and Mrs Wilsond
Combination of Script and D.I. in the same Sitting
The combination in which D.I. is regularly preceded byscript in the same sitting is pecuhar, so far as I am aware, to
Mrs Willett. The presence of a recorder or “ experimenter in
charge ” is, of course, a necessary conchtion of the spoken D.I.
But why should the spoken D.I. be so constantly preceded byscript, and script, when a recorder is present, have been—at
least during several years—so constantly followed by D.I. ? The combination is not, indeed, absolutely invariable. Thevery first “ sitter-sitting ”, of May 21, 1909 (see ante, p. 54),
produced a D.I. without preliminary script ; and there havebeen one or two instances of the same thing since. Of scripts in
the presence of an investigator in charge and not followed byD.I. there were three cases, and only three, ^ up to dime 1913.
The first of these was the script written in the presence of 0. J. L.
and quoted on p. 57 above ; in the second case D.I. was not
attempted because on that occasion the medium was judged to
be physically unequal to the strain ; the tliird case was a
deliberate experiment in which the automatist was expressly
instructed to try for a script in my presence without going into
trance.^ It is true that from June 1913 onwards the rule was so
far relaxed as to admit of sitter-sittings, which resulted in script
without D.I., although mixed, it might be, with occasional
passages of dictation. But why was the combination of script
first and then D.I. so long and, on the whole, so consistently
maintained ? What purpose, if any, did it serve ? That the communicators attached some importance to the
^ To this list may be added Mr and Mrs Kenneth Richmond, from whom
scripts have been received from time to tune since 1919.
^ I do not here include two earlier scripts written in the presence of the
automatist’s jnother, and one wi’itten in the presence of her husbaml on December 24, 1911. For this last see below, p. 75.
® See below, p. 75.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’’ s Alediumship 68
rule during the earlier years of Mrs Willett’s mediumship is proved not merely by the strictness with which it was observed,
but by sundry passages in the scripts themselves. Thus on
March 10, 1910, Gurney writes : “ Tell Mi’s Verrall I want her
to try another D.I. with me some day via you of course to open
with script Again on May 1, 1910, at a sitting with Sir
0. J. L. present, Myers writes : “ Try for a D.I. and come back
to Sc if I tell you ”. But the most explicit statement on the
subject is contained in a lone script of July 22, 1911 :
Tell Gerald I want to experiment upon one pomt I want to
find the proper balance between Sc. and D.I. proper what I mean is I want to find out the connection—not the word I want
but let it stand between the state [sic] of Sc— I am speaking
of the Sc which is the initial stage of I) I proper—and by D I proper I mean the spoken words—the stage of Sc and the stage
of D I It may be said that in one case the impression externalises itself by the hand and in the other case by the voice
But that is not the way it looks to me from here I want to
speak of this later My present point is to note that I must
experiment to find the balance What amount of Sc facilitates
the emerging into the secondary stage viz D I—and what
amount of Sc—at what point does the continuance of Sc make
that emerging difficult or delayed the relation which the
proportion of Sc bears to the secondary stage Say that that is nearer it Without experiment nothing can be learnt I want
to experiment in several directions and this is one of them.
It is evident from this extract that the experiments in which
the communicators were engaged were experiments relating to
method. No doubt is cast on the utility of the combination.
But the initial step, that of script, is treated as subordinate to
the second stage, that of D.I. The centre of interest is the D.I.
as an instrument of communication. From the point of view of
method the chief use of preliminary script is to lead up to D.I.

to “ facilitate its emergence ”. The thing of real value is the
D.I. itself. That this was the view actually held by the communicators
up to the date of the extract is confirmed by an examination of
the previous sitter-sittings, whether we consider the relative
length of the two stages or the matter contained in them. In
()4 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Alediumship [part
every case save one the scrij)t-stage had hitherto been relatively
short and the D.l. stage relatively long—often as much as ten
times as long as the other. In the one exceptional case (of
February 9, 1911) when the sittings opened with a fairly long
and interesting script, the D.l. seems to have suffered, for it was short and comparatively unimportant.
Similarly as regards content ; the short preliminary scripts
had in almost every case been concerned with matters of secon- dary importance—brief conversations with the sitters, instructions with respect to future sittings, the dates at which they were to be held, the length of time which they were to last, and
so forth. Communications of sidistance were for the most part
reserved for D.L, and with the change from writing to speech
there iisually came a change of subject also.
I think the evidence leads to the conclusion that so long as the trance condition even in the D.L was imperfect, in the
preliminary script it was lighter still. 1 suggest two possibilities : ( 1 ) that the lighter stage may have been used in order to
induce the deeper stage ; (2) that it may have been intended to serve the further purjDose of helping to keep Mrs Willett’s
trance within the limits aimed at by the communicators, and
secure it from any danger of passing into the Piperian variety
in which the normal consciousness is entirely submerged and its place taken by what purports to be a wholly different personality.
If these conjectures are well founded, the utility of the
method may have continued even after the achievement of
deep trance in both stages, of which I count the sitting of May
24, 1911, to be the first example. But not long after that date,
and possibly as a result of the experiments referred to in the
extract quoted above, the stage of jDreliminary script began to
assume greater importance and extend to greater length. It is more and more used for the conveyance of messages of a kind
formerly reserved for the D.l. stage, and the distinction of
subject-matter as between the two stages becomes less frequent.
Ultimately, as we have already remarked, this general
tendency developed into a real change of practice. The rule of
“ No D.L without preliminary script ” continued to be observed,
(hi the other hand sitter-sittings at which script alone, or a mixture of script and dictation, was produced became common.
140] Psychological As^jects of Mrs Willett's Alediimiship 65
In some of these sittings the autoniatist was practically normal
throughout, in others she seemed to pass gradually into trance ; in others again the trance, so far as one can judge, was fully
established from the outset. Nevertheless the combination
of script and D.I. has never been definitely abandoned,
though it became very rare as the years went on. It represents,
I believe, for the communicators the high-water mark of
successful method in communication. Throughout what I have
called the fourth period of Mrs Willett’s mediumship a deep
form of trance is its invariable characteristic.^ There are indications that it was the method preferred by the communicators for all messages which it was desired to withhold from the
normal consciousness of the autoniatist. On the other hand
the strain imposed upon the autoniatist by D.I. in the presence
of a sitter is admittedly greater than that involved in other
processes. 2 It was this consideration, I suspect, coupled with
a growing experience of trance-script not followed by D.I., and
the realisation by the group on the other side that it might be
made to serve their purposes almost as well as D.I. itself, that
led in the end to the nearly complete disuse of the combination.
^ In making this statement 1 do not count the sitting of December 17,
a.s falling imder the description of combined script and D.I. The long dictated
passage in that case is altogether sui generia. It does not seem to have been
regarded as a D.I. by the communicators themselves. See below, j:). 69.
- There was a wide gap in the production of D.l.s, extending from July 6, 1912, to February 28, 1914, which is probably to be accounted for by reasons connected with the health of the medium at the time. It was certainly not
caused by lack of ojjportunities, for there were seven or eight sitter-present
sittings held during the same interval.
CHAPTER II
CPvITERIA OF THE DIFFEPvENT STATES OF
CONSCIOUSNESS
( a) Memory of Message received
( b ) Indications from HANDMMtiTiNG
(c) Externalisation of Presences
( d) Indications from the Waking Stage
My paper on The Ear of Dionysius contains a brief statement
concerning the different psychical conditions in which the
Willett scripts are produced. This statement is not exactly
what I should make to-day in the light of fuller experience and
further study of the subject. I then wrote : “ Many of these
[scripts] are written when the antoniatist is alone, awake, and
fully aware of her surroundings. The remainder, produced in
the presence of a ‘ sitter ’, fall mainly into two classes. Either
the antoniatist is in a normal or nearly normal state of consciousness, much as when she writes scripts by herself, or else
she is in a condition of trance. There have been a few intermediate cases, when it is hard to say whether the sensitive is in
trance or not. But these are a very small number : in general
there is no difficulty whatever in distinguishing.”
Apart from the fact that in this statement I do not distinguish between script proper and D.I.—the distinction being
irrelevant to my purpose at the moment

I should not now say
that the intermediate cases are very few in number, or that in
general there is no difficulty in determining how any given
script should be classified. The modifications of consciousness
exemplified in Mi’s Willett’s jihenomena range over the whole
scale from practical normality through partial trance to deep
trance. Her automatic productions may be conveniently
arranged into classes corresponding to these three descriptions
of mental conchtion. But it must be reahsed that no clear line
of demarcation separates them : the first shades into the second
66
[part 140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’ s Mediumship 67
and the second into the third. Extreme cases at either end of
the scale can, of course, be readily classified. Silent D.I.s and
lone scripts may all be placed in the nearly normal class.
Similarly it is, in my opinion, safe to say that all D.I. sittings
subsequent to that of May 24, 1911, are of the deep trance
order. On the other hand D.I. sittings before that date, and
sitter-sittings without D.I. of a subsequent period, are often
not easy to place, and even in the course of the same sitting
there may be changes from one state to another. The line is often hard to draw, and I have to confess that in several cases
I have felt constrained to draw it differently at different times.
Where the question is of just a little more or a little less, clearcut conclusions are best avoided. One has to be content with
general impressions and a considerable margin of uncertainty.
Good indications may be gathered from the external demeanour
and appearance of the medium when at work, especially by noting
the expression of her face, whether she keeps her eyes open or
shut, and how far she requires assistance from the sitter in the
management of pencil and paper. But there are other signs and
tokens which have a psychological interest of their own ; and
in what follows I propose to examine certain of these at some
length, choosing my illustrations as far as possible from records
which may at the same time help to give an idea of the more
striking characteristics of Mrs Willett’s mediumistic activities.
(a) Memory of the Message received
Silent D.I.s, unless they are written down at the actual
moment of reception, which hardly ever occurs in Mrs Willett’s
case, can, hke ordinary dreams, only be recorded from memory.
In scripts and spoken D.I.s, on the other hand, we have a con- temporaneous record which can afterwards be compared with
the recollections, if any, of the content of the messages con- veyed. Power to recall such content, or any part of it, after the
sitting is over is an important test of the state of consciousness
of the automatist during the sitting. It definitely rules out the
condition of deep trance. But even complete amnesia of the
content of messages caimot, in my opinion, be taken as proof
positive of deep trance. In Mrs Willett’s case it probably
always imphes some degree of trance, but this is not true of ail
68 Psychological As'pects of Mrs Willett's MediumsMp [part
automatists. IVIrs VerraU’s automatic writing, for instance,
clearly belongs to the nearly normal type. Yet so far as her
experience in script-production is concerned this is how she
describes her first successful attemifis : ^ “I was writing in the
dark and could not see what I wrote ; the words came to me as
single things, and I was so much occupied in recording each as
it came that I had not any general notion of what the meaning
was. I could never remember the last word ; it seemed to
vanish completely as soon as 1 had written it.” And again : “ After the first two or three times of writing I never read what
had been written till the end, and though I continued to be
aware of the particular word, or perhaps two words, that I was
writing, I still retained no recollection of what I had just
written and no general notion as to the meaning of the whole.”
Obviously IVIrs Verrall, when she sat for script, was aware
that she was writing, was aware of her sensations during the
process, and conscious of what was happening round her. All
this she remembered. The failure of memory applies only to
the content of her script. Even this degree of amnesia, limited
as it is, does not seem to be experienced to anything like the
same extent by Mrs Willett in the production of her lone
scripts, though I would not go so far as to say that it never
occurs. But in her sitter-sittings the case is rfifferent. Thus in
an early D.I. (May 6, 1910) we have the assurance of Gurney,
already cpioted, to the effect that the medium is not unconscious, nor too dazed to know who she is, and, as each word
comes, what she says. The same assurance is repeated in a D.I.
of August 10, 1910, where we are told that she “ is not unconscious—she is fuUy conscious of each word as it comes, but the
last word is effaced, wiped away ”. In the light of Mrs Verrall’s
experience we need not hesitate to accept this as a true
account of the facts—so far, at least, as the normal self is concerned.
Both these early D.I.s I count as examples of partial trance ; for though the amnesia, so far as regards the content of the
message, is similar to that experienced bj^ Mi'S Verrall, I judge
from other indications that in these sittings Mrs Willett’s state
was very decidedly fui’ther removed from the normal than was
ever the case with IVIi's Verrall herself.

140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WiJleAfs MeAinmship 69
I now proceed to quote in extenso the record of a sitter-sitting
of considerably later date (December 17, 1913). I do so not
because it was a typical sitting—on the contrary it was in some
respects singular if not unique—but because it illustrates in an
interesting way some of the topics dealt with in the present
chapter. If we regard this record from the jDoint of view of form
alone, we might suppose that we had before us an example of the
famihar combination of preliminary script and following D.I.,
except that the sitting ends with a reversion to script after an
untimely interruption caused by noise outside the room. But
in character the clictated portion is wholly unlike any D.I. in the
entire collection. I have never regarded it, nor do I now regard
it, as a D.I. proper. There is good evidence to show that
neither did the communicators themselves reckon it as such.^
The allusions in the short prehminary script are obscure even
to the investigators. I do not advise the reader to trouble
himself with tr\dng to understand them, but he should note the
abrupt change of style which marks the transition from writing
to dictation.

^ If we exclude the sitting in question, no D.I.s are recorded between July U, 1912, and Febiuary 28, 1914, an interval of over eighteen months. It is to
this long interval that Gumey must be referring when, at the opening of the

first retumings to D.I. need very careful handling and some confusion may
appear in the matter transmitted ”. He could hardly have spoken thus liad he counted the dictated portion of the comparatively recent sitting of December
17, 1913, as a D.I.

Marble pillars everywhere—a most heavenly scene. A com- pany of men—small company, discussing everything in heaven
and earth, and really reaching the heights of reason—almost
unconscious of their visible surroundings. It is a sort of parable
of life. There was such intercourse of the hiiman mind going on in
that room, and I know it so well I almost fancy I must have
been there, though it happened a long time ago.
Fred uses an expression somewhere—a small company of
like-minded men. ^ That’s how those men were ; and, you know,
they never die [Here I asked for the dictation to be a little

Oh, how I wish I could tell what I know. You know, to
ordinary people those men who sat talking there long ago are
just historical figures, interesting from a hundred points of view,
but dead men. Do you know, there’s nothing dead in greatness,
because thei'e can’t be, because all greatness is an emanation
from the changeless Absolute. That’s why I know those people
as if they were alive to-day. I know them much better than
many of the people I live with—especially the older man, the
Master. He had disciples, you know, and whenever—WhatI said about that Matthew Arnold poem was becaiise I wanted
to say that what was true of Christ is true of that man I’m
speaking about.
Oh, do you know that Knowledge isn’t the greatest faculty of

Wliat a long way IVe got from my picture that I like to look
at, or rather from my room where I choose to walk. The meal
is for the most part over, and there’s a sort of hush of the spirit ; because in that quick interchange of thought new ideas have
arisen, and the man that they all look up to, he’s borne very
far aloft on the wings of the Spirit. And suddenly on the quiet
of it all there bursts the sound of revelling coming nearer and
nearer—flute players ! {ecstatically) Oh ! is it Bacchus and
his crew ? ^ Anyhow, there’s something rather Bacchanahan
about it. They’re getting nearer and nearer, and they’re
hammering on the door, and then in they come. My people
are all disturbed, and there’s great toasting. They take it all
in very good part, and they revel away. There are wreaths of
flowers, and cups passing, loud jokes. And then, do you know,
by degrees some of the crowd melt away, and some of the
people go to sleep. And then the whole thing ends up with such
a majestic thing, I think ; just that one figure, when the interruption is over, he stays there, like some great beacon shining
out above the clouds, walking on the heights of thought ; and
the absolute silence reigns, and there he sits. Do you know that man’s as real to me as if I could touch
him ! He’s an ugly man, oifly I feel he’s sublimely great. You
know I’ve not got to be tied up always to myself. I can get
up and walk about in other worlds ; and I very often like to
walk through the room where that scene took place.
Have you ever seen the shadow of the Parthenon 1 ^ Oh ! [pause) It’s all very beautiful there. Do you know Edmund

to the neighbouring door, and loud voices of men were heard. This
visibly disturbed Mrs Willett, and quite threw her off the track.)

.During the greater jjart of this sitting Mrs Willett, althoughnot in a condition of trance, was certainly further removed thanusual from a normal state of consciousness. On my showingher, about an hour later, the part which I had taken down fromdictation, she said, “ I haven’t the faintest recollection of all this, nor do I know what it means ”. I then told her that it described a famous scene in Plato’s Symposium, to whichallusion had already been made in another script of hers, nearlythree years ago (January 3, 1911). The word Syfnposium.,however, seemed to convey no meaning to her, though I re- minded her that she must have seen it in Mrs Verrall’s account(in vol. XX. of the Proceedings) of the attempt to reproduce* Burke, Speech at Bristol : “ What shadows we are and what shadows wepursue ” : quoted in a Holland script of February 9, 1910, which Mrs Willett
had seen.

Myers’s posthumous message. She has certainly read this, and
she remembered something about Diotima. The name of
Alcibiades amused her, but recalled no memories. I think we
must assume that her conscious knowledge of the Symposium
and its contents was in all probability greater at one time than
at the date of this sitting.
It will be seen that in spite of her complete faihu’e to recall
the content of the script,^ my contemporaneous judgment was
that Mrs Willett was “ not in a condition of trance ”, although
“ certainly further removed than usual from a normal state of
consciousness ”. No doubt I formed this judgment largely on
what I noticed of the external behaviour of the automatist, as contrasted with what I was familiar with in undoubted cases of
deep trance. I believe I was right in not taking the failure of
memory as a proof of deep trance ; but I should not now hesitate to describe the sitting as one of partial trance.
Incidentally, I may call attention to three other points of
interest
:
(1) The change of style when dictation begins seems to
indicate a new communicator. Who is this new communicator ? No hint is given in any part of the dictated passage that it is a message conveyed by any member of the communicating group.
The automatist mentions both Myers and Gurney, but refers to
them, as it were, independently and on her own account.
(2) When, on my asking that the dictation should be a little slower, she rephes, “ Oh, I wish I could say it quickly because
it’s all floating past me ” ; and again when she says, “ There’s a deeper faculty, deriving its—something or other—I missed
that—^through a more central zone ”, the “ I
” seems to be the
self to whom the description is given and who at times has a
difficulty in giving it out. The exclamation “ Oh, is it Bacchus
and his crew? ” uttered “ ecstatically ” should also, I think, be
attributed to the recording “ I ”. The “ I ” who is responsible
for the description, and seems to be relating its own experiences,
must, on this interpretation, be an “ I ” different from, or at
least distinguishable from, the first. If it is not one of the communicating group this second “I” would seem to be a dis-

automatist been interrogated as soon as the sitting was ended, instead of after an hour’s interval. F

The question here raisedwill call for consideration more at length hereafter.
(.4) If that portion of the script which follows the interruption by noise had been spoken instead of being written, it mighteasily be mistaken for a waking stage, since the first fewsentences have a curious resemblance to a waking stage inpoint of style. But apart from the fact that a written wakingstage woidd be of extreme rarity, if not altogether unique, thesu])position is further negatived by the change, to which attention is called in the record, from the autoniatist’s “ script hand ”to her natural wiiting. For that change, as we are about to see, denotes not an awakening or progress towards normality, buta movement in the reverse direction to something nearer acondition of trance.
[h) Indication.s from Handwriting
Very little, if any, attempt is made in Willett script toimitate the known handwriting of the several communicators.It is true that in the notes which the autoniatist is in the habitof appending to her lone scripts, when forwarding them to thecare of the investigators, she occasionally uses language implying a distinction between the Myers script and the Gurneyscript ; but this seems to refer to the rajiidity and vigour of thewriting, and to the size of the letters, rather than to anycharacteristic form of the writing itself. On the other hand herscripts exhibit two well-marked styles of handwriting which,though they bear no relation to any jiarticular communicator,do appear to have a direct connection with her state of consciousness at the time of writing. An examjile of the transition fromone to the other has already been noticed in the iumiechatelypreceding paragraph.
Mrs Willett herself became aware, for the first time, of thesetwo distinct styles of handwriting in circumstances recorded byherself when sending me the script which brought the distinction to her notice. It must be remembered that she had neverbeen shown the scripts written by her when in a condition ofdeep trance. Her account is as follows:
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'’s Mediumship 75
Script of December 24, 1911, icith Mr Willett present.
Note by Mrs W
.
Mr Willett having frequently expressed a wish
to see script coming, I had for some time been making up m_y
mind to try for script in his presence. ... I had not expected his
presence to make any difference in script, if any came. I did
think it might probably prevent any script coming. But what
did happen was this : after the first two sheets of script I found
I was going off into unconsciousness, was, in fact, going into
D.I. The writing ... is for some sheets not in my script hand,
but in something which is almost my ordinary handwriting,
except that the f’s are not crossed nor the i’s dotted. There
are also punctuation marks in the script, which my script never has. My eyes were shut, and it was only by a great and
continued effort that I got out of the D.I.ey state. I succeeded,
but I felt dazed and heavy.
I may supplement this account by some observations of my
own, recorded immediately after the sitting of April 18, 1912,
to w'hich they relate. It was in February 1911 that my acquaintance with Mrs Willett began. My first sitting with her was on
June 4 of the same year, and from that date onwards it had
fallen to me to be the principal “ experimenter in charge ”. Between June 4, 1911, and April 18, 1912, I had witnessed a good many sittings of the combined script and D.I. type, in all of which the automatist had been deeply entranced, but I had
not until the latter date seen her produce a script in a normal
or quasi -normal state of consciousness.
Note ivritten by G. IT. B. immediately after the Sitting of
April 18, 1912 ; ^
The day before this script was produced Mrs Willett had
arranged for a sitting with me, at whicli it was proposed to try
for script and D.I. in the usual trance conditions. Next day,
however, she told me she had had a “ flash D.I.” [silent D.I.]
instructing her to try for script in my presence, but without
going into trance. The instruction was duly followed, and the
present script re.sulted.
I was glad to have this new experience, never having seen the
modus operand! of Mrs Willett’s automatic writing except in
1 This was one of the three exceptional sittings with an investigator in charge, mentioned on p. 62 above, that were not followed by D.I.
7T) Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willett's 31erUu7nshij) [parttrance conditions. It will be remembered that she once tried
for script in Mr Willett’s presence, and on that occasion had thegreatest difficulty in resisting a disposition to pass over into
unconsciousness. No such difficulty was observable on thepresent occasion. She sat with the block on her knee, holdingtwo or three primroses in her left hand (taken from a bowKulwhich had been sent us from Whittinghame), and managed theturning over of the leaves without assistance from me. Sometimes she looked at the page as she wrote, biit for the most partseemed to be gazing out vacantly into space. Occasionally sheclosed her eyes altogether. Pauses were not infrequent, butthe writing when it came was usually rapid, and sometimesextremely rapid. The character of the handwriting varied.
Mrs Willett’s “ trance-script ” is always, I think, written in herown natural hand, and often punctuated. The script whichshe gets when she is alone, so far as I have seen it, is very differ- ent—the letters longer and more regular, the words runnmgmore continuously into each other, and stops conspicuous bytheir absence. When she wrote in Mr Willett’s presence andhad to struggle to retain consciousness, she noticed a tendencyto pass over into the trance style of handwriting, i.e. into
something more like her own natural hand with stops inserted.
There are few or no stops in the present script, but the handwriting changes a good deal ; and I am inchned to think that
the more closely it resembles her normal style, the further
removed she has become from the completely normal consciousness.
Since the above note was written I have had many opportunities of observing the correspondence between the handwriting of the automatist in script and her psychical condition.
There can be no doubt that, broadly speaking, the nearer she is to dee]) trance the more closely does her script approximate to
her ordinary handwriting. Punctuation marks are also a sign,
though not an infallible one, that she is deeply “ under
Another distinguisliing mark of script written in trance or
partial trance is the use of erasure to correct errors in writing.
In ordinary lone script any faulty or superfluous words whichit is desired to alter or omit are left standing. The script just
flows on and provides a corrected version without crossing out
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediiimship 77
what has been wrongly written. I do not think a single erasure
is to be found in the scripts, numbering two hundred or more,
written before May 24, 1911, the date of the first deep-trance
combination of script and D.I. This is the more curious inasmuch as the underhning of particular words in order to
emphasise them is freely resorted to. After that date erasures become fairly common, but they are almost entirely confined to
sitter-present scripts in which, on other grounds, a conchtion of
at least partial trance may be reasonably inferred.
An interesting example of erasure which occurred on May 1 1
,
1912, may be cited here because it fimnshes at the same time
an ilhxstration of the distinctions in handwriting. The sitting
was for script and D.I. and it opens thus :
Gurney I cant attempt much today the need for repose
and peace, which she has not had, that is wanted for definite
The above had been written, filling one page, when the whole
was crossed out and a fresh page begun. The opening words
were then repeated in a slightly different form :
Gurney G. I can’t do much here to-day, she needs solitude
and rest, and the life of confused and jarring elements in which
she has been breathing is a bar
The “ Gurney ” in the first page is in the handwriting
characteristic of lone script : then the style gradually changes,
and by the time the second page is begun the transition to the
trance-script hand (similar to Mrs W.’s ordinary writing) is complete. Possibly the communicator did not wish to proceed
until he was satisfied that the automatist was fully entranced.
The return to the natural way of writing in proportion as the
normal condition of consciousness gives place to trance is not
what one might have expected a priori, but is, I think, capable
of explanation. Mrs Willett sits for script with the point of the
pencil resting on the paper, and lifts it as little as possible.
Hence the continuity of line which is the most characteristic
feature of the writing. Tins is the method recommended by the
communicators themselves, presumably as that best suited for
automatic expression through the hand. Why is it abandoned
when the medium is presumably not less but more under their
control ? The explanation I suggest is that the artificial
78 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medmmsliip [part
character of the handwriting when the automatist is quite
conscious of what she is doing depends upon her giving attention to this rule of practice, and that, when the normal consciousness is lulled, attention to the rule is weakened andordinary habit reasserts irself. Save in a single exceptional
case I do not think Mi’s Willett has ever experienced the feeling
that her hand was being moved for her by some influence
external to herself. Her script-writing is not automatic in that
sense.
(c) Extjernalisation of Presences
Mrs Willett’s perception of her communicators (I use the
word perception deliberately) ranges fi'om bare awareness of a
“ presence ” void of all sensory content to complete sensory
hallucination. There is an intermediate form in which whatmay be called a psycho-sensory element is involved, and in
which bare awareness merges into less or more vivid visualisation. But both the bare awareness and the awareness re- inforced by mental visualisation dift'er from ordinary ideas,
memory images, and fancy pictures, in being independent of
the percipient’s volition. They are, as it were, inqjosed uponher from something not herself, and create a sense of the
objectivity and reality of that which is perceived, not indeed
identical with, yet not wholly unlike, that which is associated
with ordinary sense perception of external objects.
To this intermediate form of externalisation the term“ pseudo-hallucination ” has been applied. The term may notbe altogether free from ol^jection ; but I shall continue to use
it as a convenient class name enij)hasising the essentially
conij)elling and involuntary character which the phenomenonshares with true sensory hallucination.

^ Conijiare William James, Principles of Psychology, vol. ii., jjjj. 115 ff., and Proc. S.P.R., vol. x., pp. 86-87. The imjjortance of pseiulo-hallucination was not suffleiently recognised when
Gurney wrote his chapter on hallucination in Phantasms of the Living.
The sense of objectivity which characterises both bare imjjressions of presences
and so-called pseudo-hallucinations raises cjuestions of the greatest theoretical
interest. These will occupy oin attention later on. In the present chapter
I am inore concerned to describe the experiences themselves than to suggest
any theory in explanation of them.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Aledmmship 79
Some connection undoubtedly exists in Mrs Willett’s case between the ascencbng scale of externalisation and the different
states of consciousness—ranging from all-but-normality to deep
trance—which characterise her mediumistic experiences. 1 should hesitate to affirm that the correlation is regular and
invariable, but it is sufficiently marked to be of some psychological interest.
I have already quoted (pp. 52-53 above) two descriptions
given by Mrs Willett herself in the early days of her mediumship
of the way in which, in silent D.I., she becomes aware of the
presence of a communicator and of the message which he wishes
to convey to her. My object then was to give a general idea of
the characteristics of these silent D.I.s. It will be convenient
to repeat the descriptions here with a somewhat different
puiq^ose in view.
Extract from a letter to Mrs Verrall dated February 18, 1909.
Last night ... I was sitting idly wondering at it all . . . when
I became aware so suddenly and strangely of F.’s presence that
I said “ Oh ! ” as if I had run into someone unexpectedly.
During what followed I was absolutely normal. I heard nothing
with my ears, but the words came from outside into my mind
as they do when one is reading a book to oneself. I do not
remember exact words but the first sentence was “ Can you
hear what I am saying ? ”—I replied in my mind “ Yes ”...
Extract from a letter received by Mrs Verrall on September '21,
1909.
I got no impression of appearance, only character, and in some
way voice or pronunciation (though this doesn’t mean that my
ears hear, you know !). That is always so in D.I. [i.e. w silent
D.I.f I don’t feel a sense of “ seeing ”, but an intense sense
of personality, like a blind person perhaps might have—and of
inflection, such as amusement or emotion on the part of the
speaker. If you asked me how I know when E. G. is speakmg
and not F., I can’t exactly define, except that to me it would
be impossible to be in doubt one instant—and with E. G. I often
know he is there a second or two before he speaks. ... I then
sometimes speak first. ... To me, by now, there isn’t anything even strange in D.I.s except when I try to explain anything
80 Fdychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Alediumship [partabout them ; then I realise snddenly they are unusual ! Butotherwise h gives me no more sense of oddness to be talking tothese invisible people than it does to be talking to my son forinstance. lint I don’t think I mentally visualise any sort of“ appearance ” with regard to them—it is as “ minds ” and“ characters ” that they are to me, and yet not at all intangibleOf not-solid realities.
The first sentence in this extract refers to a silent D.I. ofsome months earlier (May 8, 1909), one of the very rare occasions when the “ presence ” was that of an unrecognisedstranger. Mi’s Willett’s contemporaneous record was as follows : Got impression of a young man, fashionable, conventional,sporting, very nice, a thorough gentleman, cheerful ”. At alater date Mrs Verrall, having formed a guess as to the possibleidentity of the stranger, asked Mi’s Willett for further particulars.The letter quoted al)ove was written in answer to this inquiry.
Such experiences are no doubt difficult to define and expressin langiiage, and one may be in danger of attributing to MrsWillett’s statements on the subject a precision beyond what it woidd be fair to look for in them. The two accounts I havequoted relate to different occasions. Both may be accurate.But some interest attaches to a jjoint of difference betweenthem respecting the way in which the words of the communicator reach the automatist. No hearing with the ears is admittedin either case. But whereas the first account compares thecoming of the words from outside into her mind to the experi-ence of reading a book to oneself, the second account suggests amental impression not only of meaning, but of the peculiaritiesof voice and pronunciation. If to this kind of mental hearingthere was a corresponding mental seeing, there should byanalogy residt some kind of image or rei:>resentation of externalappearance. IVli’s Mdllett, however, denies having any suchrepresentation in the typical silent D.I. “I don’t thinkI mentally visualise any sort of ‘ appearance ’ with regard to[the communicators]—it is as ‘ minds ’ and ‘ characters ’ thatthey are to me, and yet not at all intangible or not-solid realities.”This last phrase I take to be an attempt to express the senseof objectivity which the experience brings with it. To thepercipient the communicator is an iiidependent reality—“ a
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumskip 81
presence not to be put by It is possible that some faint and
vague idea of appearance is not so wholly absent from her mind
as her description seems to imply. But this much, at all events,
is clear, that no distinctly visualised picture forms part of the
phenomenon, much less any such full-blooded phantasms as most of us are famihar with in our dreams.
The bare awareness of presence may be regarded as the
minimum degree in the scale of externalisation. But there is evidently a tendency to develop a higher degree in the scale by
the addition of what I have called a psycho-sensory element.
Even in the early days of Mi’s Willett’s mediumship she records a case of silent D.I. in which she was conscious of a presence
commg toivards her, though she was unable to describe how.
This at least implies definite localisation in space, which seems
to be a first approach to mental visualisation.
Definite localisation in space ajDparently without visualisation is well illustrated in the following case :
Writing from the Lake of Geneva on September 17, 1922,
Mrs Willett records

I had a strange experience to-day—seemingly meaningless,
and yet it made such a deep impression on me that I send it on
to you. I was so tired this morning . . . that I decided to go
by the early boat to Thonon and back—fresh air and rest. It was a radiant morning—haze on the mountains—but coming
back, as I was leaving Nyon, I saw a great white mass—so high
I took it at first to be cloud. As we steamed towards Geneva
it came more fully into view, and I suddenly realised it must be
Mont Blanc—longed for but not seen by me since my arrival.
Seen across the intense blue of the lake, and over a range of
lower mountains, it was wonderfully beautiful.
I sat down and gazed—then suddenly I heard the words
“ the Dark Young Man ’’—not with my ears but inside my
mind—as if someone had said it to me in a world where thoughts
pass without speech—I hadn’t thought of the Dark Young Man
for more than a year I am sure—and have been thinking and
reading about nothing likely to revive the thought of him.
Someone said, “ He’s helping you ”, and quite suddenly
I seemed to tumble into a pool of knowledge—“ Of course he’s
been helping you all the time ”.
82 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part
I got no sense of who was the speaker, but the Dark Young
Man in the flash of a moment was there—quite close to me. . . . We stood there side by side looking at Mont Blanc and the lake
and the colour of it all—but especially at the great tower of
snow—All sorts of things kept passing through my mind too
quickly to seize—a
precious moment of human companionship —I don’t know how long it lasted—It was like a day-dream yet
more real than any reality of waking life. Why he came or how or where he went I know not.
When cross-examined by me at a later date concerning this
incident Mrs Willett assured me in the most positive way that
visualisation, or seeing with the mind’s eye, formed no part of
the experience. Yet her habitual description of this particular
communicator as “ the Dark Young Man ” suggests that at
times she must have visualised his presence in a pseudohallucinatory form.
In the silent D.I. next to be quoted something of visualised
appearance seems to be implied in the descriptive phrase “ a
piercing glance ”. But there is an ambiguity even about this
as if somehow it were possible to be aware of appearance
without “ seeing ” even with the eye of the mind. For the rest
the impression of personality is for the most jjart of things
impalpable.
January 21, 1911. {Silent D.I. recorded on the following day.)
Last night after I had blown out my candle and was just
going to sleep I became aware of the presence of a man, a
stranger, and—almost at the same moment—knew it was Henry
Butcher. I felt his personality, very living, clear, strong,
sweetness and strength combined. A piercing glance. He made
no introduction but said nothing. So I said to him, “ Are you
Henry Butcher ? ” He said, “ No, I am Henry Butcher’s
ghost ”. I was rather shocked at his saying this, and said, “ Oh, very well, I am not at all afraid of ghosts or of the dead ”. He said, “Ask Verrall (or A. W., or Dr Verrall, I can’t remember which, but I think it was ‘ Verrall ’ tout court) if he remembers
our last conversation (or meeting) and say the word to him.
Ek e tee.”
He said it several times. I said “ Very well ”. He seemed
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 83
only to want to give that message and then he went in a hurry.
I never heard tlie word Ek e tee in my life and don’t know what
it means, but record this. He was alone, to the best of my knowledge. I never felt a greater sense of vitality and strength than
that which seemed to flow from him.
P.S.—I hadn’t been thinking about him at all.
Concerning this experience Mrs Willett, on January 23, 1911,
wrote to Mrs Verrall as follows :
“ Will you let me know whether the following word (if it be one !) has any meaning or associations for your husband.^
I only heard it spoken (D.I.), so don’t know how to write it, but the sound is Ek e tee. First syllable ek to rhyme with peck.
Next one e short as one would say a if saying quickly ‘ I saw a man ’
; in fact perhaps ‘ Ek a ti ’ would be nearer. Tee or ti to
rhyme with tea, and long.”
Both the preceding incidents occurred when the percipient
believed herself to be normal and fully conscious of her sur- roundings. In this, of course, she may have been mistaken.
Not improbably there was some departure from normality, just
as there seem to have been in both cases signs of a transition
from the bare awareness of a presence to the stage of pseudohallucination.
In the next examples the departure from normality is more
clearly evidenced, and is recognised by the automatist herself.
She is in a state approaching trance, but not so far entranced as
to be unable to recall the experience which she describes. In
these experiences the psycho-sensory element has become more
pronounced. They are, in fact, typical visual pseudo-hallucinations.
Script of Sep)tem,ber 8, 1913. . {Present, Mrs Verrall)
Mrs Willett notes : “ When this script was ended, I felt I did

Sitting of October 16, 1929. [Present, G. W. B. and another.)
The circumstances of this case were peculiar, and in some
respects unique. I have called it a “ sitting ”, but there had
been no idea or intention of obtaining a script or communication of any kind. Mrs Willett and I were seated side by side,
hstening to the great Beethoven trio in B flat, which was being
played on the gramophone outside the open door. Another
person was in the room, lying on a couch, also hstening to the
music and paying no attention to us. He was the same who
had sat with Mrs Willett on the occasion last mentioned, when
the script of October 1, 1926, was obtained. Presently, to my
siu’prise, ]\Irs Willett shut her eyes and wliispered to me, “ This
room is full of presences ”. She proceeded to describe to me,
still in whispers, what she was seeing, or, rather, mentally
sensing—for though she spoke as if she was seeing a phantasm,
she explained that it was with her mind’s eye only that she saw. Her whole attention was concentrated on a single flgure—that
of a lady in an old-fashioned chess, young, and with thick and
beautiful hair. She was standing beside the couch, a brilliant
light streaming round or from her whole figure. . . . Towards the end of the slow movement of the trio Mrs Willett
remarked that she had been almost in trance, and only with
much effort had succeeded in retaining consciousness.
It was impossible to make an absolutely contemporaneous
record, but the above account is taken from a statement
written down by me on the following morning. I can vouch for
its substantial accuracy, and it was independently corroborated
by Mrs Willett’s own recollections of what happened.
The experiences described in these cases go beyond bare awareness of a presence, and beyond the definite localisation of
a jjresence in space. The element of visuahsation is so prominent that one might be tempted to class them as fully developed
hallucinatory phantasms. But that is not how they appear to
the automatist herself. In the course of preparing this paper
I have endeavoured to elicit her views on this question, and find
that she draws an absolute distinction between sensory phantasms (apparitions) and mentally visuahsed personalities. Every
one of the five cases I have just cited she unhesitatingly assigned
to the second of these categories. In fact it is possible to say
8(1 Psychological Aspects of M7'S Willett's Mednimship [partthat in the whole coiirse of her mediiimistic experience MrsWillett has never had a genuine visual hallucination which sheurns afterivards able to re^»,e?«6er a7id describe.
Mrs Willett assures me that in her normal state she is a very])oor visualise!’. It seems probal)le that her powers in thisdirection are markedly increased as she passes towards a stateof trance. But any visions which she can recall on returning tonormal consciousness have invariably for her the character ofmental pictures. They are pseudodiallucinations, not hallucinations. And the difference is of kind, not merely of degree.Like presences these visions have an objectivity of their own,but not exactly the objectivity associated with sense perception.It is qiiite jjossible that when in partial trance Mrs Willettmay have visions of her communicators which she does notremember, and that these also may take a pseudo-hallucinatoryform. In forming a judgment upon this point, however, wehave to fall back u])on the records themselves, since theautomatist cannot afterwards comment on, or be cross-examined on, experiences of which she has no recollection.
In forming a judgment on the nature of her experiences indeep trance we are under a yet greater disability in this respect
;
for whereas the visions of her light trance are occasionallyrecalled, of what has hapjjened in deep trance she never seemsto remember anything. I think, however, that there can belittle doubt that when in deep trance she is in a kind of dreamland, and that the personalities of her trance have the genuinehallucinatory character of the personages in vivid dreams.^
It may be difficidt to furnish conclusive proof of this fromthe records ; but certainly that is the impression which thestudy of them produces, and which is forced even more clearlyupon the experienced sitter. When she is in deep trance MrsWillett seems to lose all consciousness of her actual surroundings—always with the very important exception that she remainsin touch with the sitter—and to live for the time being in aworld of her own in which her communicators appear to her aspalpable and life-like human beings, of whose features and dressshe can take note, whose touch she can perceive, and in whosepresence she feels “ at home ”, as in a company of friends.Something has been added to mere mental visualisation—some1 Mrs Willett tells me that her owti dreams are of this realistic character.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mecliuw,ship 87
thing different in kind. No doubt this difference is physiologically conditioned ; but into this region of inquiry I am not
competent to adventure.
In support of the view here taken of the apparently sensory
objectivity of the personalities of her deep trance I refer the
reader to the D.I.s quoted in “The Ear of Dionysius ”, and generally to the many other passages from D.I.s cited in this paper.
The following example of a waking stage is also not without
interest as bearing on the question : Waking Stage folloiving Trance-script of September 8, 1918.
Present, 0. J. L.
I see a young man I don’t know. He’s standing near a very
tall man, with a moustache, the man has. The tall man has
got his hand on his shoulder. I’ve seen that tall man before in a dream. He’s got gloves with gauntlets and fur inside them.
The other young man said to me, “ I haven’t worn my brass
hat lately ”. He hasn’t got much voice, he doesn’t seem to
know how to speak very well

[Pause).
They’re so icily cold. As I look at them I feel as if my forehead were resting on a solid block of ice. It’s like a freezing
wind blowing from them to me. [Pause.)
This room’s full of ghosts. There are three there, two there,
and one over there. Men, all of them. Three of them are young.
I can’t see them, but I know they are there. I can even tell the places where they are. One of them seems to have been
mixed up with rivers. . . . My power is getting dimmer. One
of them seems connected with a band, a military band. I don’t
mean that he played in it, but in his mind just at present is that
thought. I don’t know what music it is I hear, loud and
delicious. He seemed to think about it a propos of nothing very
much
.
The waking stage is, as the term implies, a transition from
trance to normal consciousness. In the above example we find a corresponding transition from what I take to be hallucinatory
phantasms to presences located in the room in which the sitting
took place, but apparently not otherwise externalised. It is not absolutely clear that the one transition is causally connected
with the other. But I think some connection between them
may be inferred with a high degree of probability.
88 Psycliologicnl Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partA striking passage occurs in the Avaking stage following theD.I. of March 5, 1912. {Present, G. W. B.)
. . . Good bye : thank you
Oh ! what a heavenly thing a world of souls is. Oh ! They’regoing—They’ve gone—Seem[ed] like minds only, just as theywere going. Tliey were solid before ; then they got transparent
;
then they got dim, and I got so heavy . . .
The transition in this case also may correspond to a transitionfrom trance to comparative normality, but as the waking stagecontinued for a short time after the utterance quoted, the morenatAiral interpretation may be that the change represents theeffect of a diminution of rapport between the communicatorsand the medium. It is not so much that her condition alters, asthat the communicators are, so to speak, taking their departure.Enough has perhaps now been said to justify the statement,made at the beginning of this section, that a correlation canbe traced in Mrs Willett’s case between the different states ofconsciousness in which her mediumistic phenomena are produced and the different degrees in which her communicatorsappear to her to be externalised. That her psychical conditionis an important element in determining the degree of externalisation seems to me fairly well established. Probably it is the most important, though not the only one.
{d) Indications from Waking Stage
All trance-sittings must end in a return to normal consciousness. It is only when the transition is accompanied by acontinuance of utterances bearing some affinity to tranceutterances, yet distinguishable from them, that we apply to it the term “ waking stage ”. A study of the Willett scripts leads to the conclusion thatsittings during which, judging from other indications, themeflium has been practically entranced are sometimes followedby a waking stage, and sometimes not. Hence while theoccurrence of a waking stage necessarily implies some degreeof trance in the preceding part of the sitting, absence of awaking stage cannot be taken as proof of normahty. Again,while deep trance is jirobably always followed by a waking
140] Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willeff\s 3Ierlimnship SO
stage, the occurrence of a waking stage is not of itself sulhcient
to distinguish deep trance from partial trance.
In these circumstances it is impossible to attach high importance to the waking stage taken by itself as an indication
of the psychic state of the medium during the i^receding part
of the sitting. Nevertheless it would be a mistake to ignore it altogether. Both the fact of its occurrence, and the length to
which it extends in any given case, may be of real help in forming
an opinion when considered in conjunction with other criteria.
CHAPTER III
TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS
( ) Impressions of “ Presences ”, and the more or
LESS VIVID EXTERNALISATION OF THESE
() Mental Images
(c) Feelings and Emotions
(d) Impulses and Inhibitions
(e) Verbally conveyed Messages
The characteristic form of the communications exemplified in
the Willett phenomena is that of mental impressions that
a]ipear to the sensitive to have their origin in an agency whichshe distinguishes from her conscious self. The communicatorsdeclare that these impressions are telepathically conveyed, andthis account of them I think we are entitled to accept, unless
another and a better can be found.
The impressions in Mrs Willett’s case may he conveniently
divided into the classes enumerated below :
(a) Impressions of “ presences ”, together with the more or
less vivid externalisations of these.
(h) Mental images.
(c) Feelings and emotions.
(d) Impidses and inhibitions.
(e) Verlially conveyed messages.
(a) Impressions of “ Presences ”, and the more
OR less vivid EXTERNALISATION OF THESE
The subject of “ presences ” and their externalisation has
been dealt with at some length in the preceding chapter, but
there are one or two further observations which it may be
worth while to make.
A presence pure and simple represents, as we have seen, the
lowest grade of externalisation ; and the impression of such a
90
\vAB,T ^‘^(^']Psycholor|icnl Aspects of j\Irs Willetfs MedinmsMp D1
presence may l>e described, for tlie purpose of this chapter, as a mental percept of an individual intelligence or self, more or
less defiiiitely located in space relatively to the percipient, but
otherwise void of all sensory or psycho-sensory element.
Here it may be well to repeat the warning already given in the
introduction to this paper. Where I use language appropriate
to the standpoint of the scripts, and write as if I assumed the
impressions of the autoniatist to Ire due, in accordance with their
face claim, to the agency of independent discarnate minds, I have
neither the intention nor the desire, whatever my own views
may be, to exclude any other hypothesis which can adequately
account for the sense of objectivity which the impressions carry
with them. In particular the possible effects of interaction
between chssociated and independent, or quasi-independent,
“ selves ” within the personality of the medium slioidd never be
lost sight of. Objection may perhaps be taken, even from the standpoint
of the scripts, to applying the word comnvimication in connection with the bare awareness of a presence. A presence may
suggest a potential communicator, but can the mere fact of its being perceived entitle us to treat the impression as an actual
communication ? “ Communication ” would seem to imply
purjDOsive agency ; can the bare awareness of a presence carry
with it the impression of a pm-posive agency—or, indeed, of
agency of any kind beyond that which a material object may
be supposed to exercise as a factor in producing the perception
of which it is the object ? It is true that in IVIi’s Willett’s case the impression is seldom,
if ever, that of a perfectly indeterminate entity in some sense external to herself. It is as “ minds and characters ” that
presences are apprehended by her. Yet even so a doubt
remains concerning the parts respectively played in the experi- ence by what we usually call agent and percipient. Are these
impressions of “ mind and character ” to be regarded as communications intentionally conveyed by the personality concerned, or is the activity really on the side of the percipient
alone ? Or is the phenomenon in some way a l)lend of both ?
^
1 The question here propounded is of more importance tlian miglit at first sight appear. For it cannot be confined to the mere perception of “ jDresenees ”. Similar doubts may be raised in coimection with more developed forms of
92 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's 31ediumsJiip [part
Another point to be noticed is this : Mrs Willett claims to
be able to distinguish between one communicator and another
without any kind of visualisation, and sometimes independently
of the reception of any verbal message. Writing to MrsVerrall on Sej)tember 27, 1909 (see p. 52 above), she says, “ I don’t feel a sense of ‘ seeing but an intense sense of personality like a blind person perhaps might have—and of inflections, such as amusement or emotion on the part of the
speaker. If you ask me lioio I know that E. G. is speaking andnot F., I can’t exactly define, except that to me it would be
impossible to doubt one instant—and with E. G. I often knowhe is there a second or two before he speaks.”
Now if the means of identifying the communicator is already
given in the mental apprehension of a “ presence ”, the question
at once suggests itself whether its externalisation either as a mental picture {i.e. a pseudo-hallucination) or as a sensory
phantasm really adds an3rthing that is at once new and objective. Is the externalised form a something contributed bythe communicator, or is it due to the subjective activity of the
percipient building by association of ideas on the objective
foundation provided by the mental percept, much as, in the
case of ordinary perception, we build subjectively on the data
immediately provided by sensation ? Readers of Phantasms of the Living will recollect the elaborate
discussion which Giirney devotes to this question in connection
with veridical apparitions. The conclusion he arrives at is that
a veridical apparition is the hallucinatory shape in which a
telepathic impulse from the mind of a distant person is embodied for the percipient. As such it is subjective. All that is veridical in it is packed into the telepathic impulse in the form
of “ a nucleus of a transferred impression ” ; the embodimenttelepathy—doubts involving the distinction between what may be described
as active thought-communication by one mind to another, and active thoughtacquisition by one mind from another. We shall find, when v/e come to deal
in Part II of this paper with statements made by the commimicators themselves, that great emphasis is laid upon the distinction in tlie Willett scripts.
A fuller consideration of the subject will then be called for. In the meantime
I shall assume that the commimications, of which typical examjjles are given
in the jiresent chapter, are communications in the strict sense of the term—that
is to say, mental impressions felt by the sensitive to proceed from an intelligent
agency disthiet from herself.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 93
is the percipient’s own creation. In the main I do not dissent
from this view. It is obvious, however, that in cases where the
apparition is recognised the telepatliic nucleus must at least
contain some element that makes for identification. And this
element must be psychical.
I suggest that the “ telepathic nucleus ” is something analog- ous to the impression received by JVIi’S WiUett of “ mind,
character, and personahty ” in connection with her impressions
of “ presences ”. This would not, I think, be incompatible with Gurney’s view,
though I do not say it was the view he would actually have
accepted had he been acquainted with the Willett phenomena.
Concerning the nature of the “ telepathic impulse ” and the
“ nucleus of a transferred impression ” he is studiously indefinite. But he is obviously unwilling to admit that it can be
anything hke an idea or mental picture of the living agent
formed in the consciousness of that agent, and transmitted
from his mind to that of the percipient. He points out that
in experimental telepathy the image transferred resembles the
precise object thought of, and not anything not consciously
occupyhig the agent’s mind, whereas his own personal appear- ance is certainly not what we shoidd expect to be consciously
occupying the agent’s mind in moments of crisis or of death.
There is force in Gurney’s argument, though less, I think,
when apphed to what we are assuming to be disembodied
spirits than when apphed to telepathy from the hving. For
disembodied spuits, if such exist and can communicate, are presumably free to choose their own times and seasons, and
may have good reasons for consciously and deliberately using a recollection of their personal appearance when in the body
as a means of identification by the percipient. I do not think
we can exclude this possibihty, although, for my own part,
I inchne to the view that all visualisations of communicators,
and a fortiori all fully developed hallucinatory phantasms, are to be regarded as siibjective constructions—symbolic, it may be,
of some objective reahty, but stiU subjective constructions

except in so far as there is evidence for attributing to a communicator a definite intention to transmit a pictorial image of himselfd
^ It must be admitted, however, that some spontaneous cases, especially of apparitions about the time of death, in which veridical details of personal
94 Psychological Asiiccts of Mrs Willeffs Mediumshij) [partIt must he remembered that the communicators who form the
elective dramatis personce of Mi’s Willett’s automatic experi- ences are very few in nunibei', that of these few she had knownMyers and A. W. Verrall while still living, and that she had seen photographs of Edmund Gurney, Henry Sidgwick, and also ofthe Dark Young Man and of the “ lady in an old-fashioned
th-ess ”, though in the case of these last two she has neveridentified them as persons of whose existence and history she
had any normal knowledge. The material for a subjective
externalisation was thus ready at hand for her to draw upon.
It must be admitted, however, that in the case of the DarkYoung Man the externalisation did not slavishly follow the
automatist’s recollection of the photograph of him which she
had seen. More than once in trance-sittings has she commentedupon the photograph as being in certain details an incorrect
copy of the original as known to her from direct observation.
It is open to us to conjecture that something more than jjurely
subjective construction was here at work.
(6) Mental Images
Cases in which the scripts give evidence of a deliberate
attempt on the part of a communicator to recall his ownpersonal appearance when in the body, and to transmit animpression of it to the medium, are very rare ; but there are at
least two instances of it. The record of the earlier and morestriking of these is worth reproducing at some length. Thepassage in cpiestion is taken from a sitting with Sir Oliver Lodgeon September 24, 1910, which combined script with D.I. in the
manner usual at that date. I judge the autoniatist to havebeen in a state of light trance.
The preliminary script ends with an intimation from Myersthat “ Gurney wants to give some data bearing on the telepathic
impact ”. D.I. follows, and the passage I am about to quote
takes the form of a conversation d trois, Mrs Willett repeating
out loud what Gurney says to her and interposmg her ownobservations. To assist the reader I have indicated in square

known to or guessed by the jjcrcipient, are diiticnlt to explain either as ini- [jrossions tclc()athically Iransniittetl or as [mrely .subjective elaborations.

Evidently what we have here is an attempt to illustrate thetelepathic transmission of a memory-image from the communicator to the percijDient. The impression is without doubtmeant to be understood as a deliberately communicated imju’ession involving not only intention on the part of the agentbut effort. The case seems to stand on a widely different footingfrom the more ordinary examples of visualisation of a jjresence
which it is possible to attribute to the jiurely subjective activity
of the percipient.
I pass to what pui'port to be transferred mental pictures otherthan visions of the communicators themselves. Such pictures occur much more sparingly in Mrs Willett’s mediumisticexperience than, for instance, in that of Mis King or MrsWilson, and rarely except when she is in trance. This may bedue to her comparative lack of visualising jiower when in a state
of waking consciousness, for neither Mrs King nor Mrs Wilson,with whom this method of communication is abundantlyemployed, is a trance -medium. Sometimes the pictures are accompanied by explanatory verbal comments ; sometimes it
is left to the unaided ingenuity of the investigators to discovera signiffcance in them. Significance of some kind I thin k theyalways possess—that is to say, they are invariably symbolic ofsomething beyond the scenes immediately reiiresented. Forthe most part this inner meaning is hidden from the autoniatist,
and intended to be so. Indeed it is- probably with this veryintention that the symbolic form is adopted.

the communicator, to identify the literary source from which
the scene impressed upon her mental vision is derived. She
also reahses that the vision is concerned with a death, and that
a contrast is intended ; —the mournful ch’aperies of the barge
that received the dying King Artluu’, and the wailing of the

by cases in which the automatist apjDcars to “ see ” something,
and ch’aws a copy of what she is “ seeing I do not say that
wherever a drawing occurs in her scripts we are to infer that the
thought of the communicator has been impressed upon her in
pictorial form. But there is good evidence that this sometimes
happens, and it is of specially frequent occurrence when the
object drawn is a symbol approjjriate to one of the communicating group and is used for the piu’pose of identification.
There is an interesting variant of this type in which the
communicator, endeavouring to transmit a difficult word, seems
to the automatist to spell it out letter by letter to her in visible
form. Thus in the D.I. of October 8, 1911, of which I was in
charge, after a reference to the “transcendental self”, the
record continues as follows :
Oh, he says, back of that again Ues somethuig I dimly reach
after and you [i.e. the sitter'] would call, he says, the Absalom

not Absalom—I’ll spell it you, he says : A B S 0 L and he says
O M and rubs O M ovit and puts instead U T E . . .
In this case the medium apparently sees the letters written
iqj, as it were, on a black board.
The next example is taken from a trance-sitting of June 19,
1916. It was a sitting for script, not for D.I., but in the extract
here given spoken remarks are interpolated by the automatist
on her own account, or else as repeating what the communicator
says to her.
[Spoken] A man holds up before me letters ... I have never known him, but I call him the Dark Yomig Man.
(Sitter) What sort of letters ? [Spoken] Big square letters—would you like me to copy
what he showed me ? [Written] OX OXFORD
[Spoken] He holds another letter up.
[Written] Lux Mundi (here follows a drawing of a lighted
candle).
100 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [part[Spoken] I say this belongs and candlestick He laughs andsays G. W. B. will explain. . . .
The “ I ” in the last spoken words I take to be the DarkYoung Man, whose remark is repeated in the first person. Indrawing a candle the automatist is probably copying what shesees, just as in the case of the letters. Candle and candlestickare among the identification symbols referred to above.
The extract next to be quoted combines the characteristicsboth of drawings and of letter-spellings in the form of a monogram. It is further noteworthy as affording an instance of adistinctly visualised mental picture “ seen ” by the automatistwhile in a state of normal or nearly normal consciousness. Forthe script from which it is taken is a lone script, and the recordshows conclusively that Mrs Willett was throughout awake amiaware of her surroundings.
From the Lone Script of Segdember 26, 1922.
There are two who are m all this Both young a man & awoman and hers the influence you feel Hers is the influence
of which you feel the pressure A young and very gracious
lady ... I hear the word Perseus & she draws for me thelettei's
that is a J , not a T.
This is only foi' the jmrjjose of identifying her . . .
Ml'S Willett jii'obably recognises that the allusion in this
passage is to Bmne Jones and the Perseus series of picturespainted by him, but she does not know, supraliminally at least,
who the lady is, or how the allusion can serve “ the purpose ofidentifying her ”. The identification is not for her benefit, butfor that of the interpreters. The foregoing are examples ofvisuahsed pictures which, when the medium is in deep trance,
probably tend to take for her the form of fully developedsensory hallucinations.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 101
Communications which are primarily dependent for their
significance on impressions of sounds (other than verbal sounds,
which form a class apart), of scents, and of physical pain are
rarely found in Willett script, but do occasionally occur. In
these cases also the impressions may take a hallucinatory form
in deep-trance sittings.
The subjoined passages, relating to the sense of sound and
the sense of smell respectively, are of some interest. They are both taken from the deep-trance D.I. of February 28, 1914, and
have ah-eady been published in my paper on “The Ear of
Dionysius ”, together with other extracts from the same sitting
belonging to the literary puzzle there described. This puzzle,
as my readers may remember, purports to have been devised
by Henry Butcher and A. W. Verrall in the spirit world, and
consists in bringing together by gradual instalments a number
of apparently disconnected topics whose inner connection is only revealed when the final instalment provides the key to the
whole. Among the various topics is the siege of Syracuse by
the Athenians, and the fate of the unfortunate captives imprisoned and set to work in the stone quarries after the defeat
of the besiegers. The normal ]\Irs Willett, be it noted, was
entirely ignorant of any part of the story.
. . . Lots of wars—A siege I hear the sound of chijjping
(Strikes the fiyigers of one hand repeatedly against the palm of the
other) It’s on stone.
The sound in this case is not an unmeaning noise. It possesses a distinctive quality which the automatist proceeds to associate
with the chipping on stone by hammer and chisel. No doubt
the interpretation of the sound, as well as the idea of the sound
itself, must have been in the mind of the communicator, and
may have formed an integral part of the message he wished to
transmit. But the record as it stands suggests to me that for
the automatist the sound is primarjq and the interpretation of it an immediate inference ch'awn by herself.
Having regard to the fact that Mrs Willett was deeply
entranced throughout the sitting, I think it probable that the
case was one of genuine auditory hallucination. She hears the
sound as with her bodily ears, and not merely as with the
“ inward ear ” of the mind. But it does not follow that the
102 Psj/cJwloffiral Aspects of 3Tr,<t Willeff's Medivmship [partmessage was received by the percipient in the first instance in
the form of a sensation of sound—still less, of course, that it wasin the form of a sensation of sound that it existed in the mindof the communicator. Rather, I think, should we conceive it as both sent and received in the form of an idea of sound, thoughat once transmuted, in the case of the percipient, into sensationby a psycho-physical process such as operates in dreams.
Much the same observations apply also to the second of thetwo passages referred to, which concerns the sense of smell.
. . . Somebody said something about Father Cam walkingarm in arm with the Canongate. What does that mean ? Oh !
(sniffs) What a delicious scent ! No rosebud yet by dewempeaiied . . .
“ Father Cam ” and “ the Canongate ” walking arm in armsymbolises the co-operation of the two friends Verrall andButcher. 1 The automatist is wondering what the meaning canpossibly be, when suddenly she stops and sniffs. She is smellingsomething, declares it to be “ delicious ”, and finally recognisesit as the scent of roses.

The case follows in every way the analogy of the previousone. In the mind of the commimicatior the idea of roses musthave accompanied the idea of the smell. But for the automatistthe smell appears to be prior to the interpretation of it. It is recognised as “ delicious ” before it is recognised as the smellof roses. Again, the experience seems to be clearly one ofsensation—hallucinatory, doubtless, but still of sensation andnot of imagined sensation. The “ sniffing ” alone makes it difficult to draw any other conclusion. One does not sniff anidea. But this does not compel us to suppose that the messageof the communicator started with, or even inclnded, an actualsensation experienced by himself.
I know of no cases in the Willett records in which a definite
claim is made to the sympathetic transference from the communicator to the percipient of a sensation, or rather of the idea1 For explanation see my jjaper on “ I'lie Ear of Dionysius ” (Proceedings,
vol. xxix., p. 211).

140] Psychological As'jyects of Mrs Willetfs Medmmship 103
of sensation, of physical pain.^ There have been, however, two
occasions when it seems probable that this is what we are meant
to infer. If I am right in my interpretation the same incident
is referred to on both occasions, namely the accident by which
the Dark Young Man lost his life when climbing in the high
Alps.
Waking Stage of D.I. of May 11, 1912. {Present, G. W. B.)
OH, oh, if I could only rememljer you when you’re gone
away. I always forget you. I can’t make out how I ever came
to know you, and why you will never tell me your name, and
why you’re so kind to me. That’s the man—that’s my new
friend. He’s young and—he’s got people belonging to him . . . Oh ! I fell down, I fell down. Oh ! my head, my head, my
head. Oh, oh, oh. {Groans) Oh, oh, oh, I bumped my head.
Oh, it’s all here {putting her hands to her head below and behind
the ears).
{Pause : heavy breathing) Oh, I wish my head would get
empty . . . My contemporary note is as follows : “ All this was so dramatically uttered that for the moment I thought Mrs W.
had really hurt her head. Apparently, however, it is only the
idea of the Dark Young Man’s fall, and consequent injury,
passing into a sympathetic feeling so strong that the automatist
imagines it to have happened to herself.”
What I take to be a second reference to the same incident
occurred in the D.T. of February 28, 1914, from which I have
already had several occasions to quote. The D.I. had been
occupied with the “ Dionysius puzzle ” when the subject was
abruptly broken off, and the automatist burst out on her own
account ;
Oh, oh, it’s like frightful explosions going on all round me.
[There was no sound otdside to account for this exclamation.)
Oh, you’ve come back. I was frightened for a minute.
{Pause) Why didn’t you ever speak ?
^ The phenomenon is often met with in Piper and Thomjjson records.
Cf. also H.P., vol. ii., p. 220, where Myers speaks of it as suggesting “ incipient
possession ”. It is interesting therefore to note that Mrs Willett’s communicators absolutely deny possession in her case. See Part II., Chapter I., p. 169
below.
104 PsyrhoJoqical A fipects of Mrs Willett's Mejlhmishvp [partOh dear ! oh, my head, oh, my head [same words repeated five or six times). Stamp, stamp, thump, thump—Oh, it makes meshudder.
Why didn’t you ever speak to me through all those long hourswhen you stood there taking care of me ? .
It is to be observed ( 1 ) that on neither of these two occasionsis any explicit suggestion made that the pain in the head had atelepathic origin of any kind, still less that it had its source in
the mind of the Dark Young Man ; (2) that on the first occasionMrs Willett had already in the course of the sitting complainedof her head being “ fidl to painfidness ”, and again, just beforethe end of the waking stage, exclaimed that she wished “ herhead would get empty Similarly on the second occasion,
after the sitting was over, and she had returned to normality,she comjjlained of an uncomfortable feeling in her head “ as if the inside of it had been knocked about
In these circumstances it is impossible to be quite sure thatthe experiences described had not a purely physical origin.
Nevertheless I have a strong conviction that underlying themthere was a telepathic communication of some sort, althoughit must be admitted that the automatist gives no sign ofrealising it as such. The peculiar nature of the pain, the association of it with a “ fall ” or a “ thump ”, the introduction into
both contexts of the Dark Young Man, and the completeabsence of any external disturbing cause certainly make for
this conclusion.
If the interpretation I have put upon the above incidents is correct, the Dark Young Man’s contribution to the experiencemust have been the idea of pain as it presented itself in con- nection with the mental picture of the accident. It waspresumably received as idea in the mind of the percipient andat once transmuted into actual sensation. If this be so, nothing could more clearly illustrate the nature of sensoryhallucination. The pain felt by the automatist was real enough.We call it hallucinatory solely with reference to its origin. It
was mentally initiated, instead of having as its starting point the
condition of the bodily part apparently affected. If and in so
' Tliis refer.? to a time when Mrs Willett was seriously ill and was conscious
of the presence of the Dark Young Man watching over her.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medvumshvp 105
far as it reproduced an idea in the mind of the communicator
it was a veridical hallucination.
(c) Feelings and Emotions
Mrs Willett, as we have already seen, claims that her impressions of presences commonly include not only a sense of
personality and character, but also of “ inflections such as amusement or emotion on the part of the speaker Waiving
the question raised a while back (p. 91) of the parts respectively
played in these experiences by the communicator and the
automatist, I proceed under the 2iresent heading to give a few'
speciflc instances in illustration of the claim.
Her first experience of the kind (of date January 7, 1909) has
already been quoted (p. 50) as the earliest example of a silent
D.I. Mrs Willett had been anxious about her son’s health.
I was at dinner, she records, when I felt a strong impression
of F. W. H. M. scolding me. I can’t explain—but I felt disapprobation and felt it coming from him, and that he was wishing
me to know that there was no need for any anxiety. I had the
impression that he was conveying to me that if I doubted the
impression I was receiving I was to try for script after dinner.
I was quite normal. I was silent, I suppose, for a few minutes,
but I continued my diimer and later—8.40—did try for script ; when the following came : Myers yes write now no cause for any anxiety none yes
let him go back to school no anxiety.
The above record is of additional interest as furnishing an
example of a thought conveyed without the assistance of verbal
or pictorial exjiression. It is not until the automatist tries for
script that the message takes a definitely verbal form.
Silent D.I . of February 18, 1909. (E.vtract from Mrs WilletFs
record.)
About 11.30 to-day (February 18) I began to feel that very
restless feeling ... At 11.45 I sat down, close to a cheerful
window, with a feeling of “ heavy ” impression that F. was
waiting. I felt as if it were somebody else’s impatience.
The first words that came into my mind were ; “ Myers yes

July 15, 1915. {Ijone Script at .) E.rtract from Note byMrs Willett, written after the Script was finished :
I reached the house about 11.40 and was taken to the
Room, where jomed me. After a few muiutes conversation she left me alone in the room. I wandered about it at first and looked at the pictures, and then I seemed to pass beyond
140] Psychological As’pecfs of Mrs Willeft's Medivmship 107
them, as it were, into the spirit of the room—full of remembered
peace and happiness and rest—a strange sense of familiarity
and homelikeness.
The room seemed full of unseen presences and of their blessing ; it was as if barriers were swept away and I and they
became one. I had no sense of personality in the unseen
element—it was jiist there and utterly satisfying . . .
I can’t explain at all why the place moves me so deeply with,
as I have said, that feeling of coming back after long absence
to loved and remembered surroundings. I have only been in
the room once before when I tried for script some time in April
or May.
All the above examples of communication of feelings and
emotions rest upon statements made by the automatist when
awake and normal, and are concerned with impressions ex- perienced by her when in a state of practically normal consciousness. In the case of her unreniembered trance-experiences, we
no longer have her waking comments to help us and have to
fall back on the records themselves. It is worthy of note that
I can find only one example in the trance -records that is at all closely comparable with the examples ah’eady given. The
emotion in this case is that aroused in a husband when re- calling the grief into which he had been plunged by the early
loss of a much-loved wife. The husband himself had by this
time passed over, and the grief had become a far off memory,
but a memory vivid enough, it would seem, to act telepathically on the automatist.
Extract from D.I. of April 12, 1914. {Present, G. W. B.)
. . . Oh, how my heart aches—Oh, I’m in where there’s been
such awful grief, and I can feel the old pain streaming all ovei' me. It’s someone else’s pain. It’s just heart-breaking. Oli,
Che faro senza Euridice ...
In this, as in the previous examples, the automatist feels the
emotion as pure emotion, and at the same time is conscious of
it as somebody else’s emotion. In other trance-sittings the
communicated emotion always seems to take some symbolic
external form. For instance in the following examples, in
which the communicator is presumably visualised in bodily

{d) Imfulse.s and Inhibitions
An impulse to try for script is not uncommonly felt byautomatists, and at times has been experienced by Mrs Willettwith almost irresistible force, even when the circumstancesmade it awkward or unpleasant to yield to it. Thus early in
the morning of December 8, 1908, while she was still in bed, astrong impulse came uj)on her to get up and write. She notesin a contemporary record : “ Room cold and I very sleepy
resisted and tried to settle off—no good. At last got up.
Writing began almost before pen touched paper.” ^

Again on August 23, 1911 ; “About 8.30 a.ni. I felt so strong an impulse for Sc. that I sent downstairs for note -block
and pencil. I cannot remember a single occasion on which 1
have had Sc. at such a time, viz. whilst I was still in bed.”
A iiote appended to her lone scrij^t of June 12, 1913, is of
some interest from other points of view as well.
[The script] was quite unexpected by me. I was just going
to begin to dress for dinner, but thought I had time to write my
diary . . . As 1 was closing my diary, I suddenly felt an over- whelming rush of script coming. 1 looked at the watch lying on the table in front of me and thouglit there was no time ; but
I had to sit there and let it come. It just poured out, and was what I call a very “ happy ” script, coming easily and without
effort. It conveys nothing to me, but in one part it interested
me, as an exciting incident in a book one is reading interests one. I had that sense of lookmg on at somebody else’s experi- ences and of reading rather than writing the words. I have
marked the passage with two asterisks. ... I did not read the
script (at the moment) and had only a vague idea of what was
in it.
One of the strongest expressions of urgency occurs in a statement accompanying the lone script of February 6, 1920 : Heavy with Sc. all day— & finding no uninterrupted time
(because of letters, workmen & so on) until 9.30 p.m. when
I felt an absolute rush as if someone were hterally dragging me
. . . my bad arm making writing a trial . . . Imt the Sc. came,
often slowly, often with pauses.

Impulses directed to action other than that of trying for
script are comparatively infrequent, probably because it was
easier and simpler for the communicators to obtain what they

Mrs. Willett of the strange experiences preceding the production of the

110 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mecliumship [partwanted by means of verbal instructions given through script orsilent D.I. The following incident, however, provides a casein point, besides being in other ways instructive. The autoniatist’s account of what happened is contained in a letterwritten on March 23, 1910, to Sir Oliver Lodge, part of whichhas already been published in Mrs Verrall’s paper entitled“ Notes on Mrs Willett’s Scripts ”, in Proceedings, vol. xxv.,pp. 215-16. I reprodiice it here in full :
This is not a case of Sc. or D.I. I was sitting quietly afterdinner, alone, when I realised that I was beginning to feel dizzy—rather light-headed and generally “ queer ”—somewhat thesensation that the first few breaths of laughing-gas give one.I could not iniderstand it, for I was quite well. I wonderedvaguely what I had eaten for dinner ! I tried to throw it off
;
then my hands seemed to feel rather odd, and I suddenlyremembered I had felt like that when the “ Dorr ” Sc. waswritten. Hoping I might get rid of the feeling I at once triedfor Sc. The words were instantly written. “ Myers no scriptto-mght do not be alarmed.” Having read the Sc. I tore itup, there seeming to me to be no reason for keepmg such ameamngless sentence.
I then began to somehow “ feel ” that it was something elsewanted of me, though I did not know what.
I felt an impulse to get Mrs V.’s Oct./06 “ Report ” [Proceedings, vol. XX.] and I turned over the leaves “ trymg ” variousplaces, but felt I had not got “ it ”, whatever “ it ” might be, andyet I felt I was on the right track. At last the word “ Syringa ”struck me (p. 310). I read the page ; it conveyed nothing muchto me, though the word “ Asphodel ” which occurs on the samepage did ; but I somehow felt satished that I didn’t need to lookanywhere : the word was Syringa. Then I felt there was more,but not in that book. After a little time I fetched Mr Piddington’s “ Report ” (Oct. 1908) [Proceedings, vol. xxii.]. It is agood long time (months) since I had looked at it. I keep it ina drawer where I also keep Miss Johnson’s “ Report ” (June,1908)—I took both books out and went and sat down.
Something in me rejected Miss Johnson’s, so I took up MrPiddington’s. I wondered if more about Syringa was to befound there ; I looked the word up in the index ; it was not
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 111
there. I then thought I had better turn the pages carelessly
and see if I
“ felt ”, as I did over Syringa, that I had got “ it

I can’t explam) was wanted ; —p. 268 in big print,—“ The

River of Lethe).
To sum up : my two—I don’t know what to call them

the words) were

Syringa.
(Note : The combination of Dante's Lethe with Syringa has
a meaning for the interpreters, though it had none for the
automatist.)
The above account suggests to me that Myers was here
making an experiment in a special type of telepathic communication in order to see whether a sensitive could be impelled to
look up a particular passage in a particular book without being
directed thereto by definite verbal instructions. The experiment seems to have been successful, but, so far as I am aware,
was never repeated. On the several other occasions when the
automatist was “ sent ” to a literary passage, the volume containing the passage and sometimes even the page on which it occms were previously indicated in silent D.I.
Her instinctive recognition that the wanted jjassage had been
found may very well rest on a feeling of satisfied assent transmitted to her from the communicator. “I ‘ knew ’ she
writes on one of these occasions, “ at once—like a divining rod
over the water ; something in me gave the unmistakable sign
that ‘ it ’ had been reached ”.
Inhibition, in the sphere of action, may be regarded as a
negative impulse. Socrates, in the Theages of Plato, describes
his “ daemon ” as a voice which, whenever it occurred, warned
him to abstain from doing something that he was about to do,
but never took the initiative in urging him to action. The
Willett records contain a striking experience in which this kind
of negative push (not, however, in the form of a voice) was
presently followed by a positive pixsh acting—so it seemed to her
112 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WUleiVs Mediumship [part —not through the mind but directly upon the physical organism.
The case throws so much light upon certain aspects of Mrs
Willett’s medinmship, as well as upon her own attitude with
regard to the whole inquiry, that I make no apology for reproducing in full the long letter of October 30, 1913, to Sir Oliver
Lodge, in which she describes the incident :
October 30, 1913 {Impression). Statement by Airs Willett,
October 30, 1913.
I am usually called at 8.15 a.m. To-day it was rather later. The housemaid placed my letters on a table in my bedroom ; and a few minutes later I got up. I did not look at my letters
then, as I had only just time to do that part of my dressing
which 1 do before my breakfast if 1 was to be ready for it at
8.30, at which time it is brought to my bedroom.
It was only after my breakfast had been brought and I had
eaten a few mouthfuls that 1 began to open my letters. I opened
one or two which I found contained receipted bills and letters
from shops. 1 then saw a larger envelope beneath the little
])ile and, taking it up, saw it was addressed to me in Mr Briscoe’s^
handwriting and had “ Birmingham ” postmark. I at once opened it, as I had been correspoufling with Sir 0. J. L. about
his coming or not coming to .
I found the envelope contained some largish papers and a
letter. I took out only the letter, which was smaller than the
papers and dropped out on the tray.
After reading it through (I did this rather hurriedly, and amnot able to say what the whole of its contents were about),
I picked up the envelope to take out the enclosures when
I suddenly felt a thundering sort of knock-down-blow conviction
that I must not do so.
I looked at Sir O. J. L.’s letter again, and I now (2 p.m.)
remember of it this much : that he sent me a copy of a script
of mine (I believe August 13), having been directed by Mr G. W.
Balfour to do so. I think he said I was to compare it with the
original.
But still I felt that not to be conquered “ push ” not to take
out of the envelope the enclo.sures.
Then an odd thing happened. I did not know clearly what

envelope and walked me tlown a flight of stairs and up another
flight. Mind No. 2 looked on and wondered. But when
I reached the outside of Mr Willett’s door the two minds flashed
together, and I at once knew, somehow, what I was to do.
1 went in and handed him the envelope, made him fetch a
pencil and write down the time and date and what 1 told him

viz. : that I had read a letter it, the envelope, contained but
not the enclosures.
He asked me why I did this, f said, after a pause, that
I didn’t feel I was to read the enclosures. I then in silence
hunted about in my mind to find a reason, and then I got hold
of it ; —I thought that accidentally Mr G. W. B.’s notes on my
script might have been included by Sir 0. J. L., and that they
might not be intended for my perusal.
So I told Mr Willett this. He said, “ Your giving me this
envelope and my writing this on it proves nothing—it does not
prove you have not read all the enclosures ”.
I saw the force of this, but I said, “ I can’t help that. Keep
the envelope and I will tell you later what to do with it.’’
I then went back to my own room and fimshed my breakfast.
The impulse not to read the enclosures in Sir 0. J. L.’s
envelope got stronger as the morning wore away, and I have
now decided to ask Mr WiUett to send the envelope with its contents to Mrs Sidgwick in order that she may see whether
there is any of Mr G. W. Balfour’s notes included in the copy
of the script. I very much hope that it may prove this is not so, because
I see that there is no evidence, other than my word, that the
contents of the envelope were not read l)y me during the 10
minutes it remained in my bedroom.
114 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partI expect I am making a fuss about nothing, because MissJohnson definitely arranged with Sir O. J. L. by letter that all copies of S.P.R. papers or scripts intended for me were to goto her in the first instance, that she might go over them before
sending them on to me.
I remember she asked that Mr Briscoe might receive definite
instructions to this effect, and I wrote to Mrs Sidgwick aboutthis point only a short time ago.
In any case, to avoid a repetition of these kinds of “ pushes ”
or impulses, I should like in future that the arrangement abovereferred to should be carried out. I am sending this to MrsSidgwick, on the same day as Mr Willett sends her Sir 0. J. L.’s
letter.
I lately (the latter part of September) had an exactly similar
feeling of having two minds, one of which moved my body aboutwhilst “ I ” looked on, and in that case very grave results
would have happened if I had not acted on the impulse, as
I was thereby saved a serious danger. This makes me feel that I am right in not asking Mr Willett for the return of Sir
O. J. L.’s letter, though I quite see that I cannot prove that I havenot read the enclosures it contains.
I do not like to ask Mr Willett to look and see if Mr Balfour’s
notes are there, so that it seems best to have the things sent byhim direct to Mrs Sidgwick.
Note by Mrs Sidgwick. Nov. 1, 1913.
On October 31. 1913, by second post 1 received from MrWillett the following note dated October 30th, 1913 : “ My wife has asked me to send you the enclosed, which she
gave me at 8.35 a.m. this morning—since which time neither
she nor any other person has had access to it. It has remainedin my custody under lock and key.”
The enclosure consisted of an open envelope containing twotype-script copies and her own MS. copy of her script of August13th, 1913, with her own notes thereon. To each was also
appended a note by 0. J. L. giving information and clues whichit was not desired that Mrs Willett should at present possess.
This I cut off' from each copy before returmng them to her.

Extract from Letter written by 0. J. L. to E. M. 8.
The incident of inhibition is certainly interesting, and if by
hypothesis we attribute it to “ them ” I should like more clearly
to understand their reasons. It might be (a) that the bargain
about sending through A. J. had not been adhered to ; but in
that case it would be probably Mrs W. herself, not even her
subliminal ; or it might be (6) that “ they ” feared that something connected with * * had been put in and wanted to make
sure ; or (c) that “ they ” were somehow aware of my note and
perceived some reason why it shoidd not be read.
The last hypothesis is the most interesting, because it would
show a curious amount of knowledge about things done quite
apart from and oiit of the neighbourhood of Mrs W.—things
with no particular feeling or emotion behind them. But I confess I incline to hypothesis (a), which is practically a normal one.
I cannot altogether agree with Sir Oliver’s diagnosis. It seems to me that we have here a clear case of dissociation, and
that the immediate “ inhibitor ” was a dissociated self which
normally would form a subconscious factor of the medium’s
personality. Quite possibly it may have been acting entirely
on its own account. But while there does not appear to be any
necessity to invoke the intervention of the group on the other
side, and no claim of the kind is made, there does seem to be
some ground for supposing the motive of the inhibition to have
been a knowledge supernornially acquired of the contents of
the envelope. The question would then arise. By whom, or through whom, was this knowledge obtained ? Was it obtained
directly by the dissociated self, or was the dissociated self
prompted by some external agency ? There is no doubt that
Sir Oliver’s notes did convey information which, from the
point of view of the investigators, should not have been allowed
to reach the automatist.
(e) Verbally conveyed Messages
It is held by some that thought and language are inseparable.
I do not think so extreme a view is tenable. So far as I am able
to examine my own experience I seem to be clear that thought
is possible not only without the assistance of verbal or other
conventional symbohsm, but without even that of mental
imagery. No doubt all such thought is vague, shadowy, ill
no Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’ s Medimnshi2
) [part 140]
determined, and elusive : any attempt to hold it fast and fix
it tends to convert it at once into words.
Of course if thought without language or mental images were
impossible the telepathic transmission of such thought wouldbe more impossible still. I do not believe it to be impossible.
Flashes of meaning may reach the automatist unclothed in
symbols of any kind. Probable examples of an experience of
this natiire will be found on ]>p. 105 and 100 above. But in all cases the meaning mnst be given verlial expression if it is to be
condensed into a specific message. Whatever the theoretical
interest of this type of communication may be, its practical
importance in our records is almost Jiil.
( )ji the other hand verbally expressed messages far exceed in
bulk and importance all other ty])es of communication puttogether. In Mrs Willett’s case, as in that of other mediums,they constitute the characteristic form of the phenomena,whether uttered through script-writing or speech or apprehended l)y the inner ear and subsequently recorded. Thedifferences referred to are ])robably connected with differences
in the process of communication, but language is the essential
instrument of communication in all. Moreover as it is in verbal
form that the messages are given out, so it is fair, I think, to
assume that it is in verbal form that they are sent, unless there
is evidence to the contrary. The assumption may not in every
case be justified. We can imagine, for instance, a communication sent in the form of a mental picture being automatically
translated by the recipient into a verbally expressed meaning ; and there are actually one or two cases in which the communicator complains that a “ sound ”, i.e. a word or a collocation of
words, has emerged as a “ form-symbol ”. But the evident
surprise and interest which he exhibits on noting the change
show that he regards it as something quite exceptional in his
experience. I need not say that, besides the possibility of a
radical transformation of this kind, allowance must be made for
what the communicators call “ sophistication ” of the message
by misunderstandings, confusions, omissions, additions, andeven rejections on the part of the automatist. The numerousrecords quoted in this pajaer will, I hope, illustrate these andother shortcomings sufficiently to render their further elaboration in the present chapter unnecessary.
CHAPTER IV
THE DOUBLE TASK OF GRASPING AND GIVING
OUT MESSAGES
(a) General Conditions oe Seccessfdl Transmission
( b ) Difficulties of Reception
(c) Difficulties of Emission
(a) General Conditions of Successful Transmission
The gift of mecliumship is a natural endowment possessed in a
noticeable degree by comparatively few persons. It is capable
of improvement by practice, and likely, in the opinion at
least of the communicators, to become more wide-spread and
more developed as time goes on. Successful communication,
however, would seem to depend as much upon the communicator as upon the recipient of the message. Among the hmited
number of personahties who play a part on the Willett stage
there are some who appear unable to communicate without help
from others, or only able to do so with the greatest difficulty.
Indeed if we are to accept a hint given in one of the sittings,
there is a mediumistic faculty on the other side analogous to
that of mediums here. The passage is somewhat cryptic, but
it clearly imphes that there are inequalities of natural aptitude
on the communicating side as well as on the receiving.
Given natural aptitude there are certain conditions favourable to communication which are probably common to all sensitives of Mrs Willett’s type, and which are repeatedly
insisted upon in her scripts. The chief of them seem to be
absence of disturbing noise, a sense of security from interruption, a good state of health, serenity of mind, and freedom from
fatigue and worry. Apart from these general conditions, and
from faith in the reality of the communicators, the mental
attitude requisite in Mrs WiUett’s case for the successful discharge of the double task of grasping and giving out seems to
117
IIS Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetth Mediuniship [partvary with tlie style and subject-matter of the communicationitself. Sometimes a concentrated effort of attention on herpart is called for ; at other times she is instructed deliberately
to relax and “ let the pen run free The minimixm of effort
is apparently required in scripts of an allusive and disjointed
type, which are not intended to convey any connected meaningto her, and which largely consist of fragmentary material lying
ready in the mind of the sensitive, and brought, as it were, to the
surface by telepathic action from the comnnmicators.^ Inother scripts, and especially in spoken D.I.s, the degree of effort
required seems to depend very much on the difficulty of the
subject-matter, and to reach a maximum when the subjectmatter is highly abstract and beyond the automatist’s ordinarypowers of comprehension.
In a sitting of June 4, 1911—the first of a series of sittings
with me largely occupied with expositions of “ process ”—the
severity of the effort demanded of her, and of the strain resulting
from it, becomes almost pathetically apparent. A passage
towards the end of this record may be taken as a characteristic
though perhaps extreme illustration. The communicator is Gurney.
Oh he says, now say this for me. He says you want to foster
ill sensitives a sort of dual attitude—belief in their capacity
Oh ! say it slowly—I’m so tired, I’m so tired—oh I’m climbing.
Oh ! I’m climbing—belief. Oh I will say it, I will say it—behef
in their capacity to have access to the mind of the communicator, together with a wholesome sense of discrimination in regard
to the expressions—not right—regard to something to which
that access leads—productions.
Oh, he says, you mayn’t know it, there’s a natural bent to
extreme scepticism heie. Oh he says, there are such a lot of
things I want to tell you, and there's the longing to know whenone has struggled how far one has succeeded in making oneself —Oh he says, I mustn’t go much further now. Oh he says, don’t give me up, Gerald—help me—and help her.
Oh I can’t go on, I’m so tired.
Oh he says, only one more thing—only one more thing for
him. He says it over and over. I’m tiymg (almost sobs)

Being is antecedent to—Oh he says, You’ve not got the word
I want, but say it—it’ll suggest—Yes, that’s it, action.
Oh ! that’s done. (^4 pause, after which the waking stage
follows.) ^
Tn this sitting the automatist exhausts herself in the effort
to repeat words conveying a consecutive train of ideas. She
feels they have a meaning, and though she has no interest in the
subject on her own account, she strains her attention in an
endeavour to understand what nevertheless continually escapes
her. Effort of this kind may end in defeating its own object ; and it is worth noting that on a later occasion the communicator,
after a thoroughly mystifying discourse, advises her to try
“ going bhndly which I take to imply that she will do better
if she ignores the meaning and concentrates upon the mechanical repetition of each word as it comes. If the reader will
take the trouble to refer to the very striking passage which
thereupon follows (see p. 298 below), I think he will agree that
the advice was on that occasion justified by results.
The specific difficulties of mediumship with which I propose
to deal in the present chapter fall, as the title of the chapter
implies, under two headings—difficulties of reception and
difficulties of emission.
Let us consider these in the order named.
(b) Difficulties of Reception
It has often been noticed that mediums find it hard to grasp
proper names. In language the sign and its meaning tend to
merge into a unity so complete that we no longer think of them
separately. But this ceases to be true of an unfamiliar sign in
proportion to its unfamiliarity. Words sjioken in an unknown
tongue convey no meaning whatever. They are mere sounds,
not signs. Single unlmown words in a sentence may, of course,
gain a kind of significance from their context. Thus even an
unfamiliar proper name occm’ring in a sentence will probably
be immechately recognised for what it is, namely a proper name.
But in distinguishing one unfamiliar proper name from another

120 Psychological Aspects of 3Irs Willett's Mediumship [partwe have ultimately only the sound (or the corresponding writtensymbol) to fall back upon. In verbally expressed messagesfrom a communicator to the medium it must, I think, be as-sumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that it is asound-image, apprehended by the “ inner ear ”, that reachesher. If, as seems probable in Mrs Willett’s case, the soundimage gets transmuted when she is in deep trance into somethingindistinguishable by her from sound heard, this must be setdown (according to my view) as a subjective psycho-physicalefPect. Most people experience a similar effect in vividdreams. They seem to hear as they would hear with their earswhen awake. But I see no reason to suppose that the difficultyof catching a sound-image telepathically conveyed differs in anyessential respect from the difficulty of catching a sound heardin the course of orchnary speech or dictation. In fact thefailures experienced by Mrs Willett in catching unfamiharwords such as strange proper names, Latin or Greek phrases,^and technical terms are just such as the analogy of dictationwould suggest.
The subjoined illustrations of methods employed by thecommunicators to get over the difficulties thus caused presentvarious points of interest. A lone script of August 25, 1912,ends with the following passage : Now another thought

In a note appended to this script Mrs Willett writes :
This part of the script was very odd. Though there was
a great deal of effort about it, it was extremely interesting in
the same sort of way that it is interesting to get a Patience
out. It was written rather like this, as near as words can
describe it : After “ now I want another thought ” there was a pause, then “ Doocalon ” written slowly and very
deliberately, then “ No no ” written impatiently but goodtemperedly. This leads me to suppo.se that it was not Fred
who was writing, because I get a sense of irritability and
grumpiness when I am trying to catch a word in this sort of
way and he is writing. “ Try again ”—this seemed to me
encouragingly written. “ Dewacorn ", this word started off quite gaily up to about the c, when the next three letters
:iemed to be beginning to go into scrawls. It ended in a
scrawl and a complete stop. Underneath was written again
quite plainly " Dewacorn ”, but whether meant to be in two
words or one is not clear to me. I have never heard the ex- pression “ dew acorn ”. After this, on a new line, was wi'itten an emphatic NO : then a word was written in very big letters
which appear to me to be DEUCALION ; however, I send
a tracing of it in case it may be anything else. [Not reproduced here, as it is clearly Deucalion—m large letters, though
not in capitals.'] The script then went on about the sound
of the word. “ DEW ” I read as rhyming with pew ; “ K
”
as rhyming with pay ; “ LION ” as the animal. That did
not seem right, as the script wrote “ not Lion ”.
^ Deucalion is the Noah of Greek Mythology. There is probably an allusion to the legend of Deucalion and Pyrrha in the words “ the stones of the
earth shall praise thee^”
122 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part
Mrs Willett further states that the word “ Deucalion ” is unknown to her, though she supposes it to be Greek or Latin.
She appears not even to recognise it as a proper name—the
context in this instance giving no indication one way or the
other. In order to ensure the correct recording of the word the
communicator adopts the expedient of stressing the pronunciation syllable by syllable, though whether this is done
directly through sound-images, or indirectly by means of
visualised words whose pronunciation is known to the automatist—Dew, K (the letter) and Lion—or by an indeterminate
combination of both methods, is perhaps open to question.
That recourse is sometimes had to the visual representation
of a word of which the automatist has failed to catch the soundis beyond doubt. A good example of this has already been
given on p. 99 above, where the word “ Absolute ” is heard in a spoken D.I. as “ Absalom ”, and the communicator corrects
the mistake by writing up ABSOLOM letter by letter, as it were, upon a black board, then rubbing out the last two letters
and substituting for them the letters UTE.
A somewhat similar example is provided by a passage in the
D.I. of June 4, 1911. The communicator is explaining that a message may lie dormant in the mind of the automatist for
some time before it emerges in script.
Often there is a fairly long period of—don’t get that word
it contains a g and an s and a t and an a [G. IT. B. suggests
“ gestation ”, hut no notice is taken of this) Say incubation he
says—and then comes the uprush.
“ Don’t get that word—it contains a g and an s and a t andan a ” is clearly a remark made by the automatist on her ownaccount. The word in the mind of the communicator wasevidently “.gestation ”. As it conveys no meaning to the automatist, he siipplements the thought of it as pronounced bythe thought of the characters as written. When even this
fails he substitutes another word of similar import in its place.
In another case, which I quote from the D.I. of January 21,
1912, the wanted word is supplemented by a mental representation of the thing signified. The waking stage had begun, andhad proceeded for some minutes in the usual way, when the
140] PsychoJogicnl Aspects of Mrs Wilhites Medivrnship 123
communicator seemed to return, and the following was uttered : He says to me, Write : only that. The shield, the mother.
Oh, he says, on the shield there were different scenes, but there was one scene round the centre—and he says, say the word
Knob, if you like, it’s not the proper word—that’s what I want
an allusion to—round the extreme centre. Oh, he says, what
an expression, extreme ! He says, Please remember, my
thought of the central pomt comes out through her as the
extreme centre !
“ The shield, the mother ” is almost certainly a reference to
the description in the Aeneid {Aen. viii., 607 seq.) of the shield
forged by Vulcan for Aeneas at the request of his mother, Venus.
On the shield was represented a series of scenes from famous
episodes in Roman history, with the battle of Actium as a
centre-piece. The word wanted is apparently “ Boss ” : but
either the communicator failed to get hold of the right word
himself or he failed to impress it on the autoinatist. Faute de
mieux he offers “ Knob ” instead ; but (if I understand the
passage rightly) supplements it with a mental picture of the
central point of the shield. “ The extreme centre ” is the
automatist’s interpretation of the mental picture, and does not
represent words spoken by the communicator, who indeed
disavows the expression with some indignation.
Perhaps the most suiq^rising expedient resorted to by the
communicators in order to get a proper name recorded was the
production in script of the name Dorr by operating on the automatist telergically instead of telepathically.^ At least that is the
account of their procedure given subsequently by themselves,
as is shown by the following extracts : From the D.I. of May 6, 1910. {Present, 0. J. L.)

The quotation in question , “ There was a door to whichI found no key ”, had been given in the first “ Lethe script ” onFebruary 4, 1910. The Dorr scried followed on the next day.
Ml'S Willett’s own description of her experiences on theoccasion of the j^roduction of the Dorr script will be found inProceedings, vol. xxv., p. 125. It is not inconsistent with theaccount given by Gurney and Myers, though naturally it doesnot use the same terms. There can be no doubt that the wordDorr is written in a hand utterly unlike either the ordinaryscript-hand or Mrs Willett’s normal handwriting. The experi-ence was a unique one up to the time of its occurrence, andI lielieve it has never been repeated.
1 remarked above that the expedient employed by the communicators on this occasion was a surprising one. How sur-prising will be more fully realised when we come to deal inPart II with their own explanations of the modus operandi usedby them in communicating through Mrs Willett, and with thesharj) distinction, founded on this very difference of telepathy^ 7.e. That was a case of telergy. In a serij^t of August 20, 1909, theword “telergical” liad been spelt “ tellergical.”

from telergy, which they draw between her mediumsliip and that
of Mrs Piper. It is quite true, as Sir Oliver Lodge has said, that
the appearance in the script of the name Dorr at this precise
juncture was of high evidential value ; but it is very strange
that they should have been unable to secure this otherwise than
by a complete abandonment of their avowed methods.
I conclude this series of examples by quoting in extenso a
short script, written in my presence but not in trance conditions,
which may serve to illustrate more than one of the points
already touched upon, besides showing that the difficulty
experienced in grasping unfamiliar words may also be felt in
relation to phrases and quotations, even when these are normally known to the automatist.

Enough
This script is wholly taken up with a message to Mrs Verrall
on the occasion of the anniversary of her husband’s death,
which occurred on June 18 of the previous year. The communicator is S. H. Butcher. He is not named, but his identity is indicated at the outset by allusions to Demosthenes and to
Ireland. (Butcher was an Irishman, and he was engaged uponan edition of Demosthenes at the time of his death.) Thescript proceeds with its “ message of remembrance and hope ”,
and concludes with further allusions to Demosthenes—this time
to his death in the temple of Poseidon on the island of Calauria,
where he had taken sanctuary. The opening words of the
script, which refer to the story of Demosthenes j)i‘actising the

art of oratory by declaiming on the seashore with pebbles in
his mouth, give the “ prologue ” to his career, the allusion to
his famous speech De Corona represents its culminating
triumph, his suicide in the “ island temple ” the “ epilogue
So much it is necessary to say by way of explanation in
order to make the script intelligible. Our present concern,
however, is with the difficulties experienced by the automatist
in getting the phrase “ the wearing o’ the green ”, the text from
Psalm cxxi., the words “ Prologue ”, “ Epilogue ”, and
“ Sanctuary ”, and the final message in Latin.
The failure over the Latin calls for no comment except so far as the distinction insisted on between “ corona ” and “ coro- nat ” suggests that the word must have reached her—whether
as an auditory or as a visual image—in a quite definite form,
for I do not think she had the least idea of what the script was
driving at. As regards “ the wearing o’ the green ” the rough drawing
representing a shamrock leaf is probably the reproduction of a
picture impressed on the mental vision of the automatist. The
communicator may have tried to give the word shamrock
without success, and afterwards attempted to convey the
meaning by the help of a visual image of the thing signified
and the description of it as “a small green plant ”. The
transition to “ the wearing o’ the green ” is then effected by an
association of ideas ready provided in the mind of the automatist.
Association of ideas is again made use of to enable her by a roundabout way to arrive at the quotation from Psalm cxxi —“ He watching over Israel slumbereth not nor sleepeth
Why there should have been so much difficulty in getting “ the
wearing o’ the green ” or the biblical quotation is something of a puzzle, especially as both one and the other had appeared in
earlier Willett script. Indeed “ He that watcheth over Israel
slumbereth not nor sleepeth ” had affeady been sent as a message
to Mrs Verrall in a script of May 13, 1912, about a month before

Dr Verrall died. I'here was no difiiculty about its reception on

occasion Butcher was himself the communicator, and some
allowance should perhaps be made for his comparative inex-
])crience. It is also possible that quotations, as such, really are hard to get through ; and it is certainly noteworthy that
neither in Mrs Willett’s script (which abounds in quotations)
nor, I believe, in that of any other automatist of our group, can any quotation—as apart from a literary reference—be found
which there is good reason to think had never been known to
their normal selves. Nevertheless such explanations seem
unconvincing where, as in the present case, not only was the
quotation a very familiar one, but no less than four other
quotations—“ When God of old ”, Our fathers have told us ”, “ the Syrian blue ”, and “ Israel [Abraham] and his seed
for ever
” —are pressed into the service before the required one
is achieved.
There remains the difficidty of getting the words “ Prologue ”, “ Epilogue ”, and ” Sanctuary ”. “ I can see the thoughts ”,
Mrs Willett says, “ but it is so difficult to get the words ”. The
experience of feeling after a word which seems just out of reaeh
is familiar to everyone. It is not a case of thought without
language, Imt a failure to recall a particular conventional sign
the recovery of which does not add to the thought or make it really clearer than before. Is the aidmnatist’s difficulty in this case simply that of which we all have experience ? If so, in
what form had the thought come to her, if it truly conveyed a message from the communicator ? Had the communicator
himself failed to find the appro] )riate Avord, and had he transmitted his thought by means of a periphrasis, leaving it to the
automatist to lill in the blank ? Or had he used the correct
word but failed to inqjress it on the mental hearing of the
automatist ? I leave these questions unanswered, but it seems
to me they are not withoAit bearing on the process of communication.
The difficulties we have been considering so far are such as
arise from the unfamiliarity of jjarticular words and phrases.
Another, and, from the ]»oint of Anew of the perfection or imperfection of the records, probably more important souree of
140] Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Meiliuviship I2i)
trouble and confusion, is inability on the part of the autoniatist
to follow and grasp the too-rapid flow of the communicators’
thoughts.
Here are a few passages which indicate the nature of the
difficulty :
Lone Script of November 13, 1910. {Alyers communicating.)
Let thoughts flit past you. Cease [seize] what you can. Make records that others may delve . . . thoughts escape me
and you get them confused . . .
Lone Script of December 3, 1911. {Myers communicating.)
In my eagerness . . . the thoughts come so quickly that
they slip past you and you do not grasp any one quite clearly
Resist that sense of general understandmg as of an onlooker
watching and come here and grasp my words.
D.I. of March 13, 1912

Waking Stage. {Present, 0. J. L.)
It’s so very tiresome to have lots of thmgs you can’t catch
running through your mind, lots of isolated words . . . no, it’s no use.
Script of June 26, 1913. {Present, G. W. B.)
Such a flow of words flitting past me try to seize some . . . [“ Try to seize some ” is, of course, a request by the communicator.]
D.I. of February 28, 1914. {Present, G. IT. B.)
... I am so confused. I’m all with things flitting past me.
I don’t seem to catch them . . . That one eye has got something to do with the one ear. That’s what they wanted me to
say. There’s such a mass of thmgs, you see, rurming through
my mind that I can’t catch anything.
Trance-Script of February 28, 1914. {Present, G. IT. B.)
So many thoughts and none caught.
It is evident that for omissions and imperfections in the
records arising from a rapidity in the flow of ideas that exceeds
the receiving capacity of the autoniatist, a share, and perhaps
the larger share, of responsibihty must rest with the communi-
130 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willettis Mediumship [partcator. Sometimes the automatist begs the communicator tospeak more slowly. But it seems that this is not always easyfor him to do. Myers would appear to he the greatest sinnerin this respect. On one occasion (in the D.I. of March 15, 1912)he is represented as saying that he cannot get a series ofquotations through “ because they jostle each another, andI stand speechless and impotent from the very force of mylonging to utter ”. On this Gurney comments, “ Myers doesn’tmanage things as well as I do. He takes more out of her. Hedoesn’t shield off from her sufficiently ; he let’s the whole blazecome out in his impatience ”.
(c) Difficulties of Emission
A message must be grasped before it can be given out, andtherefore in a sense every impediment to effective reception is also an impediment to effective emission. It would seem,however, {a) that the power to receive does not, in the view ofthe communicators, carry with it the power to give out, unlesscertain conditions are fulfilled ; and (6) that even where thepower to give out is actually in operation, special causes maybe at work to hinder or prevent particular parts of a messagefrom duly emerging.
The clearest exposition furnished by the communicators ofthe general conditions to which the giving-out power is subjectis contained in a lone script of April 16, 1911 :
[Myers communicating^ . . . The point we have to study is to find the line where the incarn^e spirit is sufficiently over theBorder to be m a state to receive and yet sufficiently controUmgby its own power its own supraliminal and therefore able totransmit We don’t therefore desire the kind of trance that is of Piper essence though we could and sometimes have inducedmuch the same thing ^ Get this clear We want the operatorto be so linked with its mechanism as to control that mechanismherself We want her also to be so linked with us as to be ableto receive definite telepathic write the word radiation Thereis one glory of the sun and another of the stars there is themediumistic gift of emitting and the other gift of receiving . . .
‘ This can hardly refer to the Dorr sc ript (see ji. 1 24 above), since the mediuniwas not in trance on that occasion.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 131
According to this statement the twofold gift of mediumship
depends for its successful exercise in Mrs Willett’s case upon a maintenance of rapport on the one hand between the communicators and “ the incarnate spirit ”, on the other hand between
“ the incarnate spirit ” and “ its own supraliminal It is through control of its suprahminal that the spirit of the medium
is linked with its mechanism of utterance, whether by speech
or by writing. To lose that control is to lose the power to record.
The above account of one aspect of “ process ” rests, from
the nature of the case, almost wholly on the authority of the
communicators, and the fixller treatment of the subject of which
it forms part must be reserved for Part II., to which it properly
belongs. But it could not well be passed over without mention
in the present chapter.
The most striking instance of an alleged failure to record,
ascribed by the communicators to a break-down of the conditions affirmed by them to be essential to success, occurs in a
D.I. of March 13, 1912, when Sir Oliver Lodge was “ in charge ”. Somewhat earher in the sitting Myers had worked himself up
into a state of passionate eagerness. “ He’s trembhng ”, says
the automatist, “ I see him trembling ”. A pause follows, and
then an interval during which other communicators take their
share of speaking. Presently Gurney says :
Lodge, did you notice just now she was so completely over
the border [that] though in those instants things swept into
her consciousness, she couldn’t pass them back ; he says I want
Gerald to be fully told of this because he says it throws hght
upon the method.
{0. J. L. All will be told him.)
She projected herself in a rush of sjrmpathy.
(O. J. L. I saw her do it.) And I must use symbols, he says, m describing what occurred,
but the blaze of light and the revelation was so tremendous in
its force and effect that the lesser thing, the power to commimicate thought, lessens the—the power of acquiring it.^ Thought
^ There is obvious confusion here. What is meant is that the lesser thing,
the power to communicate the knowledge acquired, suffers from the very fact that the power of acquiiing it has been increased. Tlie word “ communicate ”
in this passage is employed in the unusual sense of " utter ” or " pass on foi' the benefit of the sitter ”.
132 Psycholo(jic(d As'pects of Mrs Willetfs Medi'umsJdp [part
is not tile right word, but you can let it stand ; put the Primacy
of the knowing faculty, and the secondariness of the transmitting, the communicating, faculty ; the soul’s instinctive
recognition of truth far out-leaping the possibility of the
condensation of it to that point where it can be grasped and
framed in language. That’s what happened then. We have
to keep her at the point where both sides can be touched, but
then she let go on your side and by the power of, not to be
measured in words, of (to frame a clumsy expression) recognitive
sympathy she broke away and passed, and knew, but could not
utter.
In the main the explanation here given by Gmney accords
with the more general exposition quoted above from the script
of April 16, 1911.1 An overwhelming rush of sympathy has
swept the incarnate spirit so completely “ over the border ”,
and into such close rapport with the communicator, that for
the time being it loses its control over the supraliminal. Withthat loss goes also loss of the faculty of emission, while the
facidty of acquiring knowledge is actually enhanced. Compare
also the opening passage of the
1 I say that the explanation accords in the main with that previously quoted,
because the words “ Thought is not the right word ” and the statement that
“ the soul’s instinctive recognition of truth far outleaps the possibility of the
condensation of it to that point where it can be grasped and framed in language ” show that what is here in question is not the reception of a telepathic
message, but the acquisition of knowledge by telcesthesia in the very peculiar sense of that term adopted in the Willett scripts. Compare the statement in the D.I. of October 8, 1911 : “ Oh, he says, telepathy’s one thing—that’s thought communication : telsesthesia is knowledge, not thought, acquired by
the subliminal when operating normally in the metetherial ”. For a full discussion of this important subject I refer the reader to chapter 3 of Part II. I may fm'ther note that faihu’e to record tlmough inability to control the
mechanism of utterance is one tiling ; failure to record because the knowledge
acquired camiot be condensed into language is another. Are we to understand
that in tliis instance there were two groimds of failure, the second being
additional to the fii'st and independent of it ? A third explanation differing from both the others is given by Ginney in a
script of October 26, 1926. “ The real truth ”, he says, “ is that the intense
emotion of the communicator blends witli the intense emotion in a sensitive receiver—so that notliing is done but the setting up of a violent vibration
in which concrete ideas disappear ”,
140] Psychological Aspects of My's Willett's Medmmship 133
Script of Jnly 22, 1917. {Present, G. W. B.)
There is a difficulty of margui—To-day one touch would draw
you so deeply within our influence that the result would be
nil for others you would be unable to record or carry back
only one touch & we unite & I want them to understand that
I purposely hold you away—at arms length as it were so that
you may record.
Turning now to the cases where there is no general suspension
of the power to give out, but where nevertheless the emergence
of particular messages or parts of a message appears to be
inhibited, we have first of all to remark that Mrs Willett herself
claims to exercise a conscious discretion in the matter of what
she records and what she rejects.
In a note written by her on February 10, 1923, with reference
to a script produced on the preceding day she says :
I was very much interested when last night spoke of
Memory—because it ties on to my Sc. of earlier in the day.
I had rejected several times this sentence
“ Memory, a wreathed shell ” “
with the impres.sion of a quotation & a hesitation as to “ Keats ”. My Sc. was so full of effort & muddle to me that I didn’t put
down everything that came to me. ... I was hesitating,
rejecting and accepting all the time
Another Memory point I rejected was “ The stream of
Memory ”—Neither of these points seemed to come clear to me. The first one recurred more than once, the other I only
received—or half-caught—once. A conversation with Mrs Willett which took place on September 22, 192.5, and was recorded by Mr Piddington from
notes taken while she was speaking, bears upon the same
question.
* Browning, In Three Days : “ Feel where my life broke off from thine,
How fresh the splinters keep and fine,

Only one touch and we combine ! ”
^ Oscar Wilde, The Burden of Itys : “ O Memory, cast down thy wreathed shell ”.
134 PsycJiologiral Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partIn the course of conversation [writes Mr P.] I referred to the
fact (already known to Mrs Willett) that Mrs Salter for a year
or two past goes into trance ; and I said that her trance
phenomena show how many of the impressions she receives
fail to get expressed. Mrs Willett asked if Mrs Salter rejected
much of what she received ; and after I had made a brief reply
to this question, she went on to say that she herself often
rejected impressions that came to her as useless or uninteresting.
She gave as an example an impression she had had at some time
between 3 and 6 p.m. on the preceding day, September 21, 1925,
and which she described to me in more or less the following
terms : “ The first sentence was ‘ The Sanctuary ’. The next sent- ence was a reference to the Lamp hanging in the Sanctuary ; and the third sentence was a reference to the Flame in the
Lamp hanging in the Sanctuary ”. (Here she said something about the thing being rather hkethe House that Jack built.) “ And then I saw this lovely Flame. My conscious instinct
was to reject as useless ; but the impression conveyed to mewas that it came to me from someone who thought it good.
If anyone had said ‘ You’re quite wrong, and the person con- veying this message is right ’, I should have got oceans of
script
Conscious and deliberate rejection of impressions dulyreceived may, one can well believe, be the cause of a good manygaps and incoherences in the scripts. But there is a class of
cases which it will not cover, namely where there is an obvious
desire and even effort to give out, accompanied by a strange
and almost mysterious inability to do so. Such expressions as “ I can hear the words, but I can’t makemy lips say them—they won’t say them ” (D.T. of July 16, 1911)
imply an inhibition which mere selective preference of one itemof a communication over another is insufficient to account for.
^ The impression here recorded seems to have been an experience on the
border-line between a silent D.I. and a lone script. I do not gather that
Mrs Willett was sitting for script at the time, but had she proceeded to do so
I have little doubt that a script would have resulted. As a matter of fact, the
main ideas conveyed in the imjjression did actually emerge in a script produced
on the following day (September 23, 1926) in my presence.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsli ip 135
The following D.I. illustrates the point, and has besides an
interest of its own which I trust may be held to excuse my
quoting it at considerable length.
I should explain that the evening before this sitting I had
been reading a paper to the Cambridge Branch of the S.P.R.
on Parallelism and. Telepathy. “ Epiphenomenalism ” was also
touched on incidentally, and, of course, in any discussion of
these two doctrines, the third psycho-physical doctrine—that
of “ Interactionism —must be implicitly referred to, though
I do not think the word was actually used. I had, however,
dealt with all three in a paper contributed to the Hibbert Journal
(April, 1910) ; and it is possible that Mrs Willett may have
seen this paper, though I do not think she had. There are some
numbers of the Hibbert Jotirnal in her country house, and
I asked her to give me a list of them. The one containing my
article was not among the number. It is, of course, also
possible that she may have read about Epiphenomenalism,
Parallelism, and Interactionism elsewhere : references to all of these had occurred previously in scripts and D.I.s.
Mrs Willett was not present at the meeting of the Cambridge S.P.R. the night before the sitting ; but she knew about
it, and some hint of the subject of the paper had probably been
given in her presence.

140] Psychological Aspecf-<^ of Mrs Willetths Medinmship 139
I have no obvious explanation to offer of the difficulty of
emission exemplified in this D.I., hut I suspect it to be connected
in some way or other with a lack of harmonious co-operation
between the different elements in the personality of the medium,
whether we call these elements the subliminal and the siipraliminal or regard them as distinct centres of consciousness
whose relation to each other varies from all but complete
independence to at least an appearance of complete unity.
The communicators declare that a general suspension of the
giving-out power results from the “ incarnate spirit ” losing
control of “ its own supraliminal ”, and therewith the control
of the medium’s mechanism of utterance. The supraliminal
ceases to record because it ceases to receive from the subliminal.
I suggest as one possible explanation of the incapacity to give
out particular parts of a message that it may be due to active
resistance on the part of the supraliminal. It receives, but is unwilhng to transmit. Why it should be unwilhng in any given
instance may be difficult to say. In the case before us the
reluctance might arise from sheer irritation and disgust at being
called upon to play a part in the exposition of a subject in winch
it takes no interest, and the technical terms of which it does
not understand. Readers of “ The Ear of Dionysius ” will re- member the passage in which the automatist gives vent to her
annoyance at the task imposed upon her ; “Oh, Edmund says
powder first and jam afterwards. You see it seems a long time
since I was here with them—and I want to talk and enjoy
myself {spoken querulously). And I’ve all the time to keep on
working, and seeing and listening to siich boring old—Oh ' Ugh ! ” A more frequent cause (it may fairly be conjectured) of
unwillingness to record is the fear whicli often, especially in
the early days of her medinmship, used to assail the automatist,
that the message which reaches her comes not from the ostensible communicators but from something in herself. The communicators are, in fact, well aware of this sceptical attitude,
and more than once complain of the obstacles which it places
in their way.
Another possible explanation would be to suppose that the
rapport between the subliminal and the suprahminal, though
not wholly destroyed as in the case of the complete suspension
140 Psycliolnriical Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medinmship [part 140]
of the giving-out power, is nevertheless at times too imperfectto permit of the subliminal effectively impressing iipon thesupraliminal those j;)arts of a message the reception of whichmight in any case have been expected to prove difficult. Someapprehension of the general sense might be imparted, but notthe expression of it in precise terms. The remedy would thenbe to make the rapp)ort more perfect ; and the intervention ofL , described in the D.I. we have been considering, wouldbe directed to this end, just as, on the other supposition, its object would be to overcome the reluctance of the supraliminal.Perplexing doid^ts may easily be raised with respect to bothexplanations ; but these are of a kind that are bound toconfront us so soon as we try to face the fundamental questionthat has been haunting the background of our inquiry all thetime—Who or what is the “ I ” of the scripts ?
CHAPTER V
DISSOCIATION
When describing the coniiiiuiiications characteristic of Willett
phenomena as mental impressions which ajjpear to the autoniatist to have their origin in an agency w'hich she distinguishes
from her conscious self, I was careful to leave room for the
hypothesis which would ascribe such impressions to the action
of one dissociated element of the personality upon another.
That this hypothesis will suffice to cover the whole of the
phenomena of mediumship I do not believe. But if by dissociation we mean no more than that in certain circumstances
a plurality of conscioiisnesses manifests itself where previously
there had been at least an appearance of unity, the evidence
for it is overwhelming ^
; and I am far from denying that interaction of the dissociated elements may be the complete explanation of some mediumistic experiences, and may enter as a
factor into many more. There is undoubtedly something of a paradox in describing
communications as impressions which appear to the aiitomatist
to have their origin in an agency other than herself, and then
including in the scope of the term impressions which have their
origin in a part of herself. Can there be a part of herself which
is not her very self, yet may in some sense claim to be herself
in virtue of being a co-conscious element in the make iip of her
total personality ? Two consciousnesses, each with the attri-
^ “ Di.ssociation ” natui'ally suggests a precedent condition of association ; but it would be unsafe to assume as certain tliat Ijefore dissociatioir (or after
it) the dissociated elements of a j^ersonality are in closer relation than during
dissociation. During dissociation, and while commimication is going on, they
at least interact. It is conceivable—though this is not my own view—that in the normal state preceding and following dissociation their relation may be
that of mutual indifference and latency, and the sole bond of connection the
fact of their being asssociatod witli the same bodily organism. It is jjossible to question even the very existence of secondary selves when not in process
of manifestation.
141
142 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [partbutes of a self, are manifested during dissociation. Has oneof them a better title than the other to be regarded as the trueself of the automatist ? If so, is the true self of the automatistthe consciousness which impresses, or the consciousness whichreceives the impression, the agent or the percipient ? Or shouldwe reserve the name of true self to the unduplicated normalconsciousness which the ordinary man habitually identifieswith himself ? What, in any case, is the relation of the dissociated selves to the normal consciousness before and afterdissociation ? These are difticidt questions, and to ask themis to start other questions no less difficult. The whole subjectbelongs to a region of mystery, and any attempt to unravel its
complexities must probably be for a long time to come provisional and speculative. I am fully aware that any suggestions1 may be able to offer are necessarily of this character ; butI am not without hope that a careful study of Willett phenomenamay at least add a few stones to the foundations on which asatisfactory theory of human personality may eventually bebuilt.
In the Willett records the great majority of communicationspurport to come from the spirit world. There are a few cases,however, in winch no claim of this kind is made, and which wemay prima facie assume to be cases of impressions produced inone dissociated element of the personality by the agency of another. The lengthy passages cited on pp. 69-74 and pp. 112 ff. are instances in point. I am afraid I must ask the reader to re-read these with some care with a view to their bearing on thesubject of the present chapter. Let us designate the passagesin question by the letters A and B respectively.
In A, if my interpretation is right, which I admit is by nomeans certain, two “ I’s ” are in evidence, an “ I ” that communicates certain of its experiences past and present, and an“ I ” that receives the communication and is responsible forreproducing it vocally. To the receiving “I ” it would appearthat the communication was being conveyed to it by an agencyother than itself. Yet the experiences described seem certainlyto be presented in a form which suggests that they are to betaken as experiences of the automatist herself, while we havealso to identify with the automatist herself the “ I ” whichreceives and utters.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willettis Meclmmship 143
On the whole I am inclined to regard the “ I ” who tells the
tale of her vision in this script as a secondary self whose communication is repeated verbatim in the first person by the
receiving and recording self. Repetition in the first person of
the remarks of a communicator is a frequent occurrence in the
case of messages purporting to come from Gurney or Myers ; and if my interpretation is right it would tend to confirm my
idea that the modus op>erandi is the same whether the communicator be a secondary self or an independent spirit. I should add that throughout the spoken portion of the
sitting I judge Mrs Willett to have been in a state of partial,
but not profound, trance.
During the experience described in B she was clearly wide
awake and fully aware of her surroundings. The drama so vividly related by Mrs Willett begins with the self in what
I suppose we may assume to be its normal nndnplicated condition. Dissociation first shows itself in a “ knock-down ”
conviction that an action contemplated by the norznal self
must not be carried out. This inhibitory impression we are
entitled to treat as a form of “communication ”. In the next phase the dissociation is carried a step further.
Two contrasted “ minds ” appear on the stage together. (3ne
of these (called by Mrs W. Mind No. 1), which I take to be the
source of the inhibition, proceeds to cause certain movements
of the body and limbs which, from its own point of view, are evidently purposeful. Mind No. 2 (described by Mrs Willett as “ me as I know myself ”) plays no part in the production of the
movements, does not understand their object, and looks on at
them with wonder and incomprehension. Finally, the two
minds seem to “ flash together ” ; normality is restored, and
“ I at once knew ”, says Mrs Willett, “ what I was to do ”. This very remarkable experience contains several points of
special interest.
One of the questions which I mooted at the beginning of the
present chapter was whether the true self of the automatist was
to be identified (1) with the consciousness which impresses, or
(2) with the consciousness that receives the impression, or (3)
with the unduplicated normal consciousness which precedes
and follows dissociation. Mi’s Willett’s experience described
above suggests a part answer to this question by identifying the
144 Psychological Aspecis of Mrs Willetfs Alediimiship [partmind receiving the impression (Mind No. 2) with “ me as I knowmyself ”—that is to say, with the normal consciousness. Forher these two I’s are one and the same self. If that view beaccepted—and for my part I am ready to accept and to adoptit as my own—the position is considerably simplified. Thethree selves with which we started as possible competitors in
the claim to be regarded as the true self of the automatist havebeen reduced to two. It is possible, no doubt, to draw a distinction between the normal self in normal conchtions and thesame self as modified during dissociation. There may even besome convenience in using the term “ primary self” to signify
the normal self as thus modified—provided always we are onour guard against the mistake of treating the normal and theprimary self as distinct jisychical entities. They are the sameself—the same Ego or centre of consciousness—only withdifferent environment and a changed content of consciousness.
They are not two Egos, but successive states of one. Mrs Willett’s identification of Mind No. 2 with her normalself stands in strong contrast with the sharp distinction whichshe draws between Mind No. 2 and Mind No. 1. Note that shedoes not actually use the expression “ me ” or “ I ” of MindNo. 1 at all. It might even be contended that Mind No. 1 is not really a dissociated self, but an independent entity outside
the personality altogether. Nevertheless this was clearly notthe view of it held by Mrs Willett, nor do I believe it to be thetrue view. Her own instinctive conception is implied in the
words “ The two minds flashed together, and I at once knewwhat I was to do ”. She pictures to herself the two mindsjoining together so as to form one mind. But the one mind is
still Mind No. 2. It is Mind No. 1 that has ceased to be in
evidence. This account of the phenomenon may not be its
correct interpretation ; but it is clear evidence that she
regarded Mind No. 1 as part other own personality, and not as an intrxider from outside.
Another point of interest is provided by the automaticphysical movements caused by Mind No. 1. If Mind No. 1 andMind No. 2 are to be regarded as roughly equivalent to thesubliminal and the supraliminal of the scripts it would seem to
follow that the subliminal is able to produce intelligent movements of the body quite independently of the su|)raliminal,
140] Psychological Asjjects of Mrs WillettA Mediumship 145
and perhaps even against its will. On the other hand, in the
passage quoted on p. 130 above we are given by the communicators to understand that the externalisation of messages
through voice or hand is only possible in Mrs Willett’s case to
the subliminal acting through the supraliminal. Are the two
views consistent with each other ? They do not seem easy to
reconcile. But the action of the mental on the physical is so mysterious, and so little light is really thrown upon it by the
Willett phenomena or by the statements of the communicators
respecting “ process ”, that I prefer to leave the question
unanswered.^ So far as I recollect, the only other automatic
movements recorded among Willett phenomena which the
automatist is not only not conscious of producing, but is conscious of not producing—are those which occurred in connection with the Dorr script.- But in that case the movements
were claimed by the communicators as a telergic effect brought
about by themselves. It is very difficult to get from automatists
any precise account of the sense in which they feel their scripts
to be automatic ; but I believe the cases in which they appear
to themselves to be looking on while the hand is being moved
by an apparently independent agency are rare. In the Willett
records the Dorr script seems to be the only clear example.
But an experience of December 8, 1908, may be w'orth noting,
when the automatist tried for script in obedience to a strong
impulse, and records that “ writing began almost before pen
touched paper ”.
I have next to call attention, but rather by way of contrast
than of resemblance, to another Willett record, as remarkable
in its way as either of those which we have just been considering.
The incident described occmrred towards the end of the waking
stage following the trance D.I. of May 13, 1912.
The automatist had already remarked that the communicators were “ aU gone ”, and after a pause had opened her eyes
and looked round her, though she failed at first to recognise the
room in which we were sitting. She was still in a condition of

The account of what ensued is taken from a note ch’awnup by me within two days of the sitting. I had supposed thewaking stage to be coming to an end when

Mrs Willett proceeded to talk m what might, save for twopecuharities, have been taken to be a cpiite normal manner.The two peculiarities were : (1) that, instead of looking at me,she seemed to be for the most part deliberately looking in
another direction, or, when she did occasionally turn her eyes
straight towards me, to be focussing them on somethingbeyond and not on me at all ; (2) that, although the conversation was carried on between us in the ordinary way, and lasted
at least ten minutes, she never during that time seemed to
realise who 1 was, oi’ to take any trouble to do so. At onemoment I asked her point-blank to look at me and say if sheknew me. Upon that she turned towards me and answeredthat she did not, but thought she might be able to make outwho I was, if she tried sufficiently hard ; adding that she did
not wish to try just then, becau.se she wanted to go on talking
about Henry Sidgwick. In effect, the conversation was chiefly
upon H. S., though in the course of it she remarked that sheseemed to see me between two others, and thereupon took upthe pencil and drew the figure given below.

I The middle circle, she said, was me, and the two outer onesthe others with whom I was connected. I asked whether either or both of “ the others ” had already “ passed over ”. “ I make the division there ”, she said, drawing the vertical
line. “ This one ” (pointing to the circle on the left), “ is onthe other side ; you and the other are still here ”. Her remarks about H. S. were qiiite interesting, but I madeno attempt to take thenr down in writing, as the conversationbetween us was too rapid. She described the impression whichshe had gathered from her suiDernormal experience of him.Among other things she said she thought he was rather deficient
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumshi'p 147
in a feeling for things of beauty in his surromidings ; and
pointing to the tiles of the fireplace of the drawing-room at
Grange Terrace, Cambridge, where we were sitting, she said “ For instance, he would not mind those, whereas they would
be impossible for me She called the house Hemy Sidgwick’s
house, and on my saying it was Mrs Sidgwick’s house, insisted
that it was his, not hers, that his books were there and that he
frequently came and looked at them ! She said H. S. often put questions to her on philosophical
subjects expressed in simple language in order to find ont how
a particular view was likely to strilm the ordinary commonsense mind. His attitude as a thinker when in the body had
been much misunderstood. He believed it woidd be many
ages before humanity reached anj'thing like a basis of certainty,
and in the mean time vast assumptions must be made. But
he did not Idte making assumptions, and often objected to the
assumptions made by Myers.
A good deal more was said, which I do not remember with
sufficient clearness to record. But the point is, that it was all quite coherent, and that, apart from the peculiarities I have
mentioned, there was nothing to make one suspect that she
w’as not in a perfectly normal condition. No waking stage
within my experience has at all closely resemided this one ; but some of its features appear in those of March 13th and 15th,
1912, when 0. J. L. was in charge. These cases show a similar
coherence of thought, so much so that when I first read O. J. L.’s
account I wondered whether he had not set down a good deal
that Avas uttered after Mrs Willett had become completely
normal again. In the light of what I have now myself AAutnessed,
I am more doubtful about this. It is worth noting that during
the waking stage of March 13th, 1912, Mrs Willett, although
she does recognise 0. J. L., hesitates a little, and seems not
quite confident that she is right.
The case here recorded (let us designate it by the letter C)
has one marked featime in common with both A and B. It is not suggested in any of the three that a communicator from
outside is taking any active part in the proceedings. On the
other hand, whereas in both A and B two dissociated selves
manifest themselves simultaneously, we have apparently one
148 Psychological Asjjects of Mrs WilleWs Medium,shvp [partspeaker, and one speaker only, on the stage in C. In otherwords A and B are cases of co-conscious intelligences interacting
with each other, whereas C presents the appearance of a single
intelligence chscoursing upon its own past and present experiences. Does the intelligence manifesting itself in C correspondto Mind No. 2 in B, i.e. to “ me as I know myself ”, or to MindNo. 1 from which Mind No. 2 expressly distinguishes itself ? Myown view is that it corresponds to Mind No. 2, but to Mind No. 2
in a state of gradual transition to normality. The communicators—in this case claiming to be the spirits of deceased persons
are said to have “ gone ”. If, instead of being what they claimedto be, they were in reality dissociated secondary selves belongingto the personality of the automatist, we might describe thesituation by saying that, dissociation having come to an end,the secondary selves have vanished from ken, leaving the})ercipient or “ primary ” self in solitary j^ossession. But this
percipient or primary self is none other than the normal self
in an abnormal phase. The identity of the “ I ” is maintainedthroughout the waking stage, at the end of which it is unmistakably Mrs Willett’s normal self. In the transition tonormality a change has undoubtedly taken place. I hold thatthis must be regarded as a change in the content of conscious-ness of a single self, not a change from one self to another.Probably the present case is but an outstanding example ofsomething that occurs in a more or less pronounced form in
every waking stage, especially when the automatist has beendeeply entranced. Even after dissociation has completelyceased the single self may still retain some memory of its experiences during dissociation—a memory which tends to fadeaway like a dream as consciousness of its normal surroundingsreturns.
To return to A and B : up to this point we have treateddissociation as being a division of the personality into twocomponents, roughly corresponding to the supraliminal and thesubliminal of Myers. What warrant have we for limiting thenumber of components to two ? Myers himself^ regardedhuman personality as in some sense “ polypsychic ”, andconsidered it “ permissible and convenient ” to treat “ asiddiminal self” and “ siddiminal selves ” as interchangeable' Human Personulilt/, vol. i., sect. 112.

terms. His conception of the different “ selves ” as so many
layers or strata of a single psychical entity is, as I have said, one which I cannot accept. Bnt on the question of multiplicity versus duality I think he was right. Certain passages
from Willett records, in which the antomatist, speaking in the
first person, describes her experiences at the moment, either
during trance or in the course of emerging from trance, may be
quoted in support of this view ; and we shall come across it again
later in statements attributed to the communicators themselves.

150 Psyclioloqical Aspects of Mrs WiUeti' s MeclivAnsliip [part
[t is hard to say how far we should attach literal credence to
these statements, but J am strongly inclined to believe that they
represent at least a symbolic adumbration of the truth. Theconception, to which they clearly point, is that of a personality
consisting of a multiplicity of selves normally co-operating so as to ])roduce the appearance of a single self, but capable of
dissociation into more or less independently-acting psychic
elements. To some such conception I think we are almost
driven ; but the nature of the selves and of their mutualrelations remains a very obscure proldem.
A chain of mo's is represented in the first extract as connecting
with another apparently analogous chain of spirit communicators ; and in the second extract a message from the communicators is said to be handed on from one me to another with
possible loss in the process of transmission.
The idea of a chain of me's may not be fundamentally incompatible with Myers’s conception of a unitary soul differentiated
into distinguishable strata, but nevertheless essentially one. This is the doctrine expounded, though not, I think, withperfect consistency, in Human Personality ; and it is also, as we shall see in Part II., the doctrine expounded by the groupwho piu’port to communicate through Mi’S Willett’s medium
ship. It does not, however, appear to me to be the mostnatural interpretation of Mrs Willett’s own experiences as described by her in the passages I have quoted. Such phrasesas “ a number of me’s whirling round and joining to make oneme ” seem to apply much more aptly to individual psychic
units than to “ strata ” of a unitary consciousness. Moreover,the description of a chain of me’s continuous with a chain ofspirit communicators surely points to a relation between theme’s similar to the relation assumed to exist between the spirit
communicators and the medium, and between the spirit
communicators themselves—in other words, to a relation
between distinct psychic entities. The validity of this inference
does not depend on the assumption that the communicatorsreally are the spirits they purport to be, but rests on theundoubted fact that that is what they are taken to be by the
auto7natist. The argument would still hold good even if wechoose to regard tfie communicators as so many adchtional me’smasquerading as spirits.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs WIedimnship 151
Incidentally I may remark that if the relation between the
units in any place in the combined chain is telepathic, there is good reason for supposing that it is telepathic throughout.
Whatever may he the method of communication between
the different me'
s
which form links in the chain, the chain itself
is represented as terminating in a me which observes the other
m,e's, and is the ultimate recipient of the message that is being
conveyed through them. It continues to observe the other
me's on the breaking up of the chain in the early stages of a
return to normality ; and when the automatist uses the first person to describe her own experiences it is always the observing
me that speaks. I have no hesitation in treating it as a phase
of the automatist’s normal self—in fact as the me to which, in
discussing the experience described in B, I have applied the
term “ primary self ”. The primary seif, I once more repeat, is the same self as the normal self ; but by reason of dissociation
the environment is different, and therewith the mental content
likewise.
The reader wiU not be surprised when I add that for me this
same self is also the automatist’s true self. Myers, however,
thought otherwise, holchng that the true self is to be found in
the subhminal ; a doctrine that appears to be accepted by the
communicators in Willett scripts. The subject is one that calls
for further examination, but I prefer to leave it alone for the
present with the intention of retmaiing to it in a later chapter.
The question may be asked, Does the control of the bodily
organism during chssociation remain throughout with the
primary me, or does it on occasion pass either to a secondary me
or to a genuinely external communicator ? Whatever may be
the case with sensitives of the Piper type, my impression about
Mrs Willett is that even in trance her primary self is never
cUsplaced from general command of the organism, though some
partial chsplacement appears to have occurred in the exceptional instances described on p. 145 above. It is to be noted
that in both of these exceptional instances the automatist was
awake and aware of her surrounchngs.
The degree of departure from normality exhibited by the
primary self during dissociation varies widely in different cases. Broadly speaking, it is greatest when the automatist is deeply
entranced. It is reduced almost to the vanishing point in
1")2 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WillefPs Medimnship [partsilent D.I.s and lone scripts. Here an interesting questionarises. If communications are accepted as coming from a sourcewithin the sensitive some degree of dissociation must needs bepresumed in order to account for the fact that they appear toreach her from an independent agency. But now let us supposethat the communications are really what they purport to be,
namely, messages from a genuinely external source. In thatcase I see no absolute necessity for postulating any degree ofdissociation however slight. An external communicator impressing his message on the normal self should be at least as
effective in creating a sense of alien origin as a secondary self
communicating with a primary self. Myers, indeed, took it for
granted that a telepathic message from an external source canonly reach the supraliminal through the subhminal as intermediary. This would make dissociation an invariable factor in
the process of communication from whatever source. I canwell believe that it is a frequent factor in the process, but wherethe possibility of an external communicator is admitted I see no reason for sxipposing that it is a necessary one.^
That the passage from normality through dissociation to
restored normality is a passage from at least apparent unity to
duality or plurahty and so back again is not likely to be disputed. But the nature of the unity, and the relation of the
dissociated elements to the normal self before and after dissociation, offer a wide field for doubt and speculation. If myidentification of the primary self with the normal self is accepted,
the problem is really concerned only with the secondary self
(or selves). When Mrs Willett in Extract B describes the
“ flashing together ” of the two minds, and in the D.I. ofJanuary 21, 1912, speaks of a number of mPs whirling roundand joining to make one me, what is the true interpretation of
her experience ? Is it that, when combined, the various me’s
will have lost their individual identity and collapsed into a
single unitary self ? Or are we to suppose that, although theycontinue to exist as individual psychic units and to interact
with the primary self, consciousness of that interaction has
ceased at least so far as the primary self is concerned ? Or,
again, should we carry tliis idea still further, and suppose that,
when the sensitive.retmms to a normal condition, the interaction
1 See pp. 276 ff. below.
140] Psi/rJinlofiiral Aspects of Mr-'f Willett's MeAiumship 153
between the primary and the secondary me's conies to an end al
together, leaving the primary me in sole occupation of the field ? I doubt whether we are yet in a position definitely to answer
these questions, or to feel confident that even the formulation
of them is not inadequate and misleading. All three hypotheses
may be wide of the mark. But if we are to choose between them,
my own view, for what it is worth, inclines strongly to the
second as at least likely to be nearer the truth than either of
the others.
If we consider the various types of mediumistic communications as distinguished from the content in any given case, are we driven to regard any of them as beyond the competence of a
dissociated self to produce by its own unassisted agency ? I do
not think we are. The wide range of phenomena extending from
simple dream experiences and ordinary automatic writing to
the hallucinations imposed on iVIiss Beauchamp by “ Sally ” in
the famous case described by Dr Morton Prince, seems to point
to the activity of a dissociated self as the sufficient explanation
of every type of message. True, we have still to account for the
curiously persistent claim—on that sup]3osition, fraudulent—-of communicators to be discarnate spirits. But it is the supernormal element in the cotitent of communications,^ coupled with
the general evidence in favour of telepathy, that chiefly throws
doubt on the all-sufficiency of the explanation.
Its insufficiency would be partly remedied if it were legitimate
to assume the existence of dissociated selves endowed with
powers of “ independent clairvoyance ”. An entity so endowed
might, out of its own resources, and without the co-operation
of any other mind, become a communicator of knowledge
supernormally acquired. I would not venture to pronounce an
explanation on these lines of certain mediumistic phenomena to
be impossible, though it could not be stretched to cover the
whole ground. But it involves an incursion into the marvellous
at least as great as the hypothesis of telepathy. The evidence
for it is insufficient in quantity and quality : in Mrs Willett’s
1 Cf. H.P., vol. ii., pp. 198-9.

Perception, which certainly establishes a prima facie case in favour of “ pure
”
clairvoyance.
154 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WilletPs Mediumshig) [partcase it is, in my opinion, wholly wanting. Certainly there is nomanifestation in her records of knowledge supernormallyobtained that could not be more easily and simply accountedfor by telepathic interaction with another mind.
Short of crediting a dissociated self with the faculty ofclairvoyantly acquiring knowledge on its own account, it is possible to sxippose that in certain cases and in certain directionsit may possess exceptional capacities exceeding those exhibitedby the normal self. Much automatic utterance is of so feeble acharacter as to suggest that the intelligence responsible for it
is inferior in capacity to the normal self. If we could be surethat this inferiority is invariable, we should have to seek elsewhere for the source of any automatic product that clearlysurpassed the limits of the automatist’s normal capacity. Theredoes not seem, however, to be any good reason for assumingthat dissociated selves are necessarily either inferior or superior,mentally or morally, to the normal self. As Myers says, “ Hidden in the depths of our being is a rubbish-heap as well as atreasure-house ”. The most notable instance that I know of in the history ofpsychical research, not even excepting the famous case ofHelene Smith, of a mediuniistic product exceeding what weshould expect from the known intellectixal abilities and mentalequipment of the axitomatist, is that presented by the case ofMrs Curran, now' Mrs Rogers, an American lady who, withoutgoing into trance, dictates in rapid and apparently unpremeditated flow long novels and pieces of poetry of literary merit veryfar beyond the recognised capacities of the normal self. In thecase of Helene Smith, Myers himself attributes the automaticproduct to the activity of a secondary self.^ In the case of MrsCurran, the ostensible communicator is a discarnate spirit
calling itself Patience Worth, and claiming to have lived its
earthly life in England in the latter half of the seventeenthcentury. Here also an exjxlanation has been sought in purelysubliminal insjxiration ; and though in this particular instancethe explanation bristles with difficulties, the question of origin
mxist still be regarded as an open one. I express no opinion oneway or the other and am content to follow Dr Walter Prince,
who has devoted a whole volume to the case, and who sums up1 HeeH.P., vol. ii., p. ].33.
140] Psychological Aspecffi of M7's Willeffs Medivmship 155
his conclusions as follows : “ Either our concept of what we
call the subconscious must be radically altered, so as to inelude
potencies of which we have hitherto had no knowledge, or else
some cause operating through but not originating in the subconsciousness of Mi’S Curran must be aeknowledged If we
reject the second alternative it only remains to accept Mrs
Curran as a truly remarkable example of “ genius ” assuming
the most pronouncedly mediumistic form.
I have cited the Patience Worth case here because it seems
to me that we shall have just the same alternatives to ehoose
between when we eome to deal in the second part of this paper
with statements made in Willett scripts respecting the modus
operandi and the processes of communication. These statements, and also certain philosophical disquisitions, of which a specimen will be found in the Appendix to tliis paper, whatever
else we may think of them, show a power of thought on difficult
and abstruse subjects which, knowing Mi’s Willett as intimately
as I do, I eertainly should not have expected from her normal
self. The contrast between product and normal capacity is not
so striking in Mds Willett’s case as in that of Mrs Curran, for
Mrs Willett is a well-read and exceptionally intelligent lady,
and if she gave her mind to the subjects in question eould
doiibtless sueceed in gaining a more or less adequate grasp of
them. But, as a matter of fact, though she possesses a copy of
the abridged edition of Human Personality, and must be presumed to have read it, and is besides aequainted with the
contributions made by Mrs Verrall, Mr Piddington, Miss
Johnson, and Sir Oliver Lodge to vols. xx., xxi., xxii., xxiv., and
XXV. of the Proceedings of the S.P.R., the psychological aspects
of psychical research have singularly little interest for her.
They have seldom been mentioned between us ; and judging
from remarks that have fallen from her from time to time,
I should say that her normal understanding of them is very
much below the level reached in the treatment of them in her
scripts. If I had before me only those Willett scripts to which
I have been referring, I franldy admit that I should have been
at a loss whether to attribute them to subliminal activity or to a source entirely outside the personality of the medium.
Probably, like Dr Walter Prince, I should be content to suspend
judgment. But having before me the whole of the Willett
156 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willeft's Mecliumship [partscripts, and being in a ]iositinn to com]iare them with the scripts
of other antomatists of onr gronj) and with facts known to meInxt not known to Mrs Willett herself, I am personally of opinionthat they contain evidence of supernornially acquired knowledgewhich no mere subliminal mentation will suffice to account for.
My readers are not in this position, and for reasons stated in theintroduction to this paper T cannot put them in possession ofthe considerations that have chiefly weighed with me. All theyhave to go upon in the way of evidence of supernormal communications is that provided by the papers already publishedin the Proceedings of the Society and mentioned in the introduction. I cannot complain if they do what I should probablydo in their place, and suspend Judgment. And that, indeed, is
all I ask them to do.
I conclude this chapter with some brief reflections arising outof a comparison of mediumship with genius—the latter termbeing here used in the sense given to it by Myers, which makesits essential characteristic to consist in the interaction of supraliminal with svdiliminal mentation.^ Myers’s definition deliberately excludes from the scope of genius inspiration directly
proceeding from a spiritual source ^
; and in this respect it is
])lain that mediumship extends to a wider field than genius,
for it includes all communications that seem to the automatistto proceed from some independent source, irrespective of thequestion whether that source be genuinely external or whatMyers calls subliminal.
From my point of view—that is to say, in relation to thenature of the process—this limitation of the field of genius seemsarbitrary, and even irrelevant. 1 am unwilling to regardinspiration proceeding from a mental source within the personality as essentially different in kind from inspiration proceeding from a mind external to it. Biit apart from thelimitation in question, what, if any, is the distinction betweengenius as understood by Myers and mediumship ? There are cases on record where genius takes a purely mediumistic form.1 Of. H.P., vol. i., 25. 71.
2 Incidentally I may remark that it also involves a refusal to admit that
the sui^raiiminal consciousness is ca23able on its own account of producing a work of genius—a Ihnitation which I cannot but regard as arbitrary andunsupported by evidence.

“ On ne travaille pas ”, wi’ites De Musset, “ on ecoute, c’est

be phenomena of the same order. A distinction between genius
and mediumship is evidently not to be looked for where dissociation is as clearly manifested as it was in the case of De
Musset. It is where there is no manifest evidence of dissociation
that genius, conceived as successful co-operation of subliminal
with supraliminal elements, parts company with mediumshij).
When a medium’s apprehension of a
“ message ” as proceeding
from an agency other than herself comes to an end the niediuniistic activity as such ceases with it. It is otherwise with the
activity of genius. If genius consists, as Myers holds, in the
interaction of subhminal with supraliminal mentation, we must
recognise that in the majority of cases that interaction goes on
subconsciously so far as the normal self is concerned. The
thoughts resulting from it in the conscious mind wiU then
appear to that mind to be its own thoughts, not thoughts
impressed on it from elsewhere. I am far from denying that
there may be truth in this conception. But it is obvious that
it must be a matter of inference. I do not see how we can have
direct evidence of it.

PART II
INTRODUCTORY
In Part I. of this paj)er I have considered the phenomena ofMrs Willett’s inediumship mainly in the light thi’own uponthem by the observation of the investigators, and by thecomments and descriptions of her experiences provided by thesensitive herself either in retrospect or during the actual courseof the sittings. My next task will be to extract from the recordsand set forth as clearly as I can the statements pm’porting tocome from the communicators, and to express their views uponthe psychology of inediumship and the methods and processesof communication.
These statements, as might have been anticipated, fromwhatever som’ce they really proceed, show general conformitywith the opinions held by Myers and expounded in his greatwork on Human Personality. But the conformity is by no meanscomplete ; the differences wiU, I think, be foimd of no less
interest than the resemblances. Moreover, in the descriptionof the modus operandi in certain cases the scripts present uswith an elaboration of detail to which nothing in HumanPersonality, or, so far as I know, an3rwhere else in the hteratureof the subject can fairly be said to correspond.
Though the communicators usually speak as with theauthority of an insight claiming to be superior to ours, it is interesting to note how repeatedly and emphatically they insist
upon the hmitations of them knowledge, and on the need for
continued research and experiment on their own side as well as on ours. The following extracts illustrate this point.

CHAPTER I
TELEPATHY, TELEPvGY, POSSESSION
As we ah'eady had occasion to notice, there is nothing in Mi-sWillett’s medinmship corresponding to the “ control ” whichforms such a characteristic feature in that of Mrs Piper, Mi’s
Leonard, and other trance -mediums. Whatever may be its truenature, the control represents itself as the surviving spirit ofsomebody once in the flesh, which for the time being supplantsthe spirit of the medium in the use of the physical organism,whether to express its own ideas or to transmit messages fromother spirits. In the latter case it is these other spirits who arespoken of as “ communicators ”, and the process by which theycommunicate with the control is jJi'esuniably assumed to betelepathic, though I do not think this is always made clear.
Sometimes, however, the control itself gives place to a communicator, who is then said to be in “ direct communication ”
; i.e. the relation of the direct communicator to the medium is in noessential respect different from that of the regular control whenthe regular control is expressing its own ideas and not transmitting messages from others. Direct communication is, in fact,
equivalent to control ; and certain of Mrs Piper’s trancepersonalities, who began as communicators, ended by themselves taking on the j)art of regular controls, transmittingmessages from other spirits and generally assuming charge ofthe organism of the medium. In control and direct communication so conceived there does not seem to be any room fortelepathy in the commonly accepted apjflication of the term,which limits it to interaction between one mind and another.The process is telergical, not telepathic. The self of the mediumis off the stage altogether, and what we are left with is thecontrolling spirit using the physical organism of the medium toconvey its message to the sitter.
In communications of the Willett type, on the other hand,the self of the medium is never oil the stage, and telepathy104
[part 140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsh ip 165
would seem to be of the essence of the process. The difference
is important, and great stress is laid upon it in the Willett
scripts by the communicators themselves.
Let us now see what they have to say on the subject.

other is the blending of incarnate and excarnate spirits there
is nothing telergic it is a form of telepathy the point we have
to study is to find the line where the incarnate spirit is suffi- ciently over the border to be in a state to receive and yet
sufficiently controlling by its own power its own supraliminal
and therefore able to transmit.

These pronouncements leave no donbt concerning the viewsof the communicators on the essentially mental character ofMrs Willett’s mediumship. According to them not only is themessage tele])athically conveyed to the subliminal of thesensitive, but in certain cases, if not in all, it passes from hersubliminal to her suynaliniinal by what can only be conceivedas a mental process before it is externalised in the form ofspeech or writing. The actual externalisation seems to berepresented as the work of the snj)raliminal. As we shall seelater the communicators do not admit the passage of thoughtfrom s\d)liminal to supraliminal to be telepathic. But if it is not telc])athic, what is it ? To this point we shall have occasionto return hereafter.
The extracts collected above raise another question to whichno clear answer seems to be provided in the scripts themselves.The communicators more than once deprecate trance in MrsWillett’s case, yet the course of development of her mediumshipis clearly in the direction of trance. Her earUer communicationscame to her when she was in a state practically indistinguishable from normality—when, indeed, any suspicion of abnormality rested entirely on the mere fact of communications being
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's 31ediumship 171
received.^ Nor has the method of communication by lone
scripts and silent D.I.s ceased at any period to be employed,
though it has been supplemented by automatic writing and
utterance obtained in the presence of a sitter and showing a continuous progress through light trance to deeper trance,
ultimately culminating in a state in which the sensitive loses all consciousness of her surroundings except of the presence of the
sitter, and on awaking retains no memory of what has happened
during the sitting.
How is this consistent with the distinct statements made by
the communicators that they “ do not want this to develop
into trance ”, or with the instruction given to Mrs Verrall at
the sitting of August 25, 1910, to check any appearance of
trance ? I have already given in Chapter I. of Part I. what I hope may
be accepted as a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty (see
p. 56 above). The communicators were putting Mrs Willett
through a course of gradual training in mediumship. They were
aiming at something new, and by something new they meant
something different from the Piper trance—namely a condition
in which, though the sensitive lost consciousness of her sur- roundings and memory of what happened during the sitting, she
nevertheless, unlike IVIi’s Piper, retained consciousness of her
own personality throughout. To refuse to apply the term
“ trance ” to such a condition seems to me misleading, and
I have not thought it desirable in this matter to follow the
example of the communicators and depart from established
usage. In the early days of her mediumship the idea of passing
into trance was repugnant to Mrs Willett. The communicators
may have avoided the word partly from fear of alarming her,
but chiefly, I think, they did so in order to emphasise the
novelty of the type of mediumsliip at which they were aiming.
They certainly have avoided the word most successfully. In
the whole series of scripts I can only And one clear instance of
its being used to describe Willett conditions. Elsewhere it always means trance d la Piper.
^ The mere fact of communications being received would not of itself be a valid ground for inferring abnormabty if we could be sme that they were
derived from an extraneous source and not from a dissociated self. See on
this point my remarks on p. 152 above.
172 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medimnship [partThe novelty, then, consists in this, that even in deep tranceMrs Willett retains a consciousness of self, whereas Mrs Piperloses all sense of her own personality^
Why is so much importance attached to this difference ? Itis because it involves the whole difference that separatestelepathy from telergy, and telepathic communication from“ possession So long as the self of the medium is in evidencethe natural presumption is that any commimication from outside must be between mind and mind ; but if the self is whollyeliminated the externalisation of the message must be effectedby direct action on the physical organism of the medium bythe outside agency itself. Concerning the phenomena of the Piper trance the viewsexpressed or implied in Willett script are, broadly speaking, thesame that we find in Human Personality. The Myers of thescripts and the author of Human Personality are at one intreating the essential feature in Mrs Piper’s case to be “ possession ”, by which is meant that the spirit of the mediumquits the body and that its place is taken by an invadingextraneous spirit. No attempt is made either in HumanPersonality or in the scripts to elucidate the process by whichthe invading spirit controls the physical organism, but it is practically taken for granted—and I do not see what otherhypothesis is open to us—that “ the extraneous spirit acts on aman’s organism in very much the same way as the man’s ownspirit habitually acts upon it Possession, in short, in the wider sense of the term, is simplythat relation of a mind to a body which enables it to interactwith and control the body. From the point of view of processit does not seem to matter whether the control be exercised byan invachng spirit or by the mind normally associated with thebody.^ Of comse, the question remains whether such invasion^ Whether t]ie coinmiinicators are justified iu describing tiie peculiarityas new I cannot say with confidence, though I do not think any case quitelike Mrs Willett’s is to be found in Human Personality.

ever actually takes place, and in particular whether the
“ regular controls ”—Phinuit and the Imperator Band—are
entitled to be regarded as extraneous spirits.
The Myers of Human Persoyiality ended by accepting as independent excarnate spirits not only the communicators

some of whom purport to take on occasion the place of the
regular controls and “ possess ” the vacated body of the
medium—but also the regular controls themselves, in spite of
the very strong arguments for regarding these, at least, as dissociated elements of the mechum’s own personality. The
independent status of the regular controls is not disputed in
Willett script, but neither is it so unambiguously affirmed as to
constitute a definite pronoimcement. Phinuit is never referred
to in the scripts, the Imperator Band only once, and that in
reply to a direct question put by Sir 0. J. L. The answer then
given was so vague and evasive—a thing rare in Willett script —that one is tempted to read into it a desire to avoid any
expression of opinion on the subject.
The contrast drawn in Willett scripts between the WiUett
phenomena and those of the Piper trance rests, as I have said,
upon the distinction between telepathy and telergy, telergical
action being the modus operandi of a spirit in possession of the
medium’s physical orgamsm.
Once, and apparently only once, in the case of IVIrs WiUett
are we given to understand that telergical methods were employed in place of telepathic. This was when the name Dorr
was telergicaUy written, after attemjDts to get it written by
telepathic communication had failed. Yet even on this occasion
we have to note a fundamental divergence from the Piper type
of possession. In the Piper trance, we are told, there is “ complete or all but complete withdrawal of the spirit ”, and an
extraneous invading spirit takes its place. When the name
Dorr was written, on the other hand, there was not even an
approach to trance : the automatist was awake and aware of
it by the term control, and to reserve the term possession for possession by
an extraneous spirit. He admits, however, that to discriminate one from the
other may be a very difficult task, and that in forming a judgment we have
to fall back on the content of the commrmications received—that is to say, on inferences drawn from other than psychological considerations. (See
H.P., vol. ii., p. 198 ; also p. 153 above.)
174 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'' s Mediumship [pabtwhat was going on. If the Dorr incident was really a case of“ possession ”, it was a case of possession shared between theinvading spirit and the spirit of the medium. Instances of theshared possession of the organs of speech and of voice by twodistinct controls have occurred in the history of Mrs Piper’smediumship, but the controls in such cases have alwayspurported to be invading spirits. A closer parallel is providedby the experience of Mrs Willett recorded on pp. 112-113 above,when Mind No. 1 seemed to control the body while Mind No. 2looked on and wondered ; but there was no question there ofeither “ mind ” being other than a dissociated element of thesensitive’s own personality.
The Myers of the Willett scripts and the Myers of HumanPersonality agree, as we have seen, in the descriptions whichthey give of the nature of the Piper trance -phenomena. Butas soon as we pass from mere description to consider the comparative significance to be attached to the two methods ofcommunication—the telergic and the telepathic—the agreement ceases. To the Myers of Human Personality “ possession ”I’epresented the culminating point of perfection in the methodsof communication with the spirit world. ^ He also reached theparadoxical conclusion that tele2Dathy, carried to its highest1 Cf. H.P., vol. ii., j3p. 189-90. “ On the whole, I did not then [he. in 1888]
anticipate that the theory of possession could be presented as more than aplausible .speculation, or as a supplement to other lines of proof of man’ssurvival of death. The position of things, as the reader of the S.P.R. Proceedings knows, has in the last decade undergone a complete change. Thetrance j^henomena of Mrs Piper—so long and so carefully watched by DrHodgson and others—formed, I think, by far the most remarkable mass of psychical evidence till then adduced in any quarter. And more recentlyother series of trance phenomena with other ‘ mediums ’ —though still incomplete—have added materially to the evidence obtained tlrrough MrsPiper. The result broadly is that these phenomena of possession are nowthe most amply attested, as well as intrinsically the most advanced, in ourwhole repertory. “ Nor again is the mere increment of direct evidence, important though thatis, the sole factor m the changed situation. Not only has direct evidencegrown, but indirect evidence, so to say, has moved to meet it. The notionof personality—of the control of organism by spirit—has gradually been so modified that possession, which passed till the other day as a mere survival
of savage thought, is now seen to be the consummation, the furthest development, of many lines of exi^eriment, observation, reflection, which the precedingchapters have opened to our view,”
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'' s Mediumship 175
degree, passes into possession. “ In the incursion of the
possessing spirit ”, he writes, “ we have telepathic invasion
achieving its completest victory In other words telepathy
from an extraneous spirit achieves its completest victory when
it ceases to be telepathy and becomes telergy.
It is from a similar standpoint that, in his “ Scheme of Vital
Faculty ” f he places “ possession ” higher in the scale than
“ ideation inspired by spirits Mrs Willett is an example of
the latter, Mrs Piper of the former.
The Willett scripts, on the contrary, seem to assign a higher
place to telepathy than to possession. See especially the lone
script of June 10, 1909, quoted in the above collection of
extracts : The response to some extent—how large an extent I do not
yet exactly know—the response conditions the power of
transmission. All telergic phenomena is clumsy and creaking
in comparison with telepathic medium. It is to telepathy that
I look for the nearest approach to perfect intercommunication
between Met Etherial and terrene Strata and I sum up one aspect
in those words Thought leaps out to wed with thought.
If the Myers of Humayi Personality and the Myers of the
scripts are one and the same, this statement reads like a retractation of the opinion expressed in his book.
Is it possible to effect a rapprochement between the two
types of phenomena ? What seems to be required for this
purpose is some kind of “ telepathic possession ”. Suggestions
of this are to be found in Human Personality, and something more than suggestions in the Willett scripts. When
Myers tells us that “ in the incursion of the possessing spirit we
have telepathic invasion achieving its completest victory ”, his
idea seems to be that the telepathic invader actively displaces
the spirit of the sensitive, and only when that displacement is complete, or all but complete, does true possession

i.e. telergic
possession—ensue. “If ”, he writes, “ we analyse our observations of possession, we find two main factors—the central
operation, which is the control by a spirit of the sensitive’s
organism ; and the indispensable pre-requisite, which is the
partial and temporary desertion of that organism by the

My real difference from Myers is this, that whereas for himtelepathic invasion is a stage on the way to telergical control bythe invader, I prefer to think of it as continuing to be a mentalphenomenon however far it is carried. It is still a relationbetweeji two minds, even if the telepathic interaction betweenthem is such that they almost seem to fuse together and mergeinto one. Even in so extreme a case the spirit of the sensitivehas not been eliminated, and may continue to be that elementin the blended whole which acts iipon the physical organism.'I"his does not amount to saying that there is no such thing astclergic control by an invading spirit. On that point I amexpressing no opinion. But what passes for true possessionmay sometimes—perhaps always—be what I have called tele-])athic possession ; and, in any case, it can hardly be correctto regard telergic control as the final term in a telepathic series.We have next to consider certain passages in Willett scriptwhich bear upon the same subject. One of these in particular,from a trance -sitting of February 7, 1915, will, I think, be foundof such real interest as to be worth reproducing at some length.On the night of September 29-30, 1914, Mi’s Willett had avery vivid cheam which she had a strong impulse to record,though it had no special meaning for her. The opening incidentsof the dream were recalled later on in the trance-sitting justreferred to. 1 give them liere in her own words.
In my dream I found myself standing on the crest of amountain (alp) with a high wall of snow before me whichprevented me from seeing the view which I somehow knew wasspread out beyond. Beside me was standing a man—I knownothing of his appearance & he was not anyone I knew—I onlygot an inpnession of strength & gentleness. We spoke to^ H.J\, vol. ii., ]). 192.
140 ] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'’ s Mediumship 177
each other, but what we said I can’t now remember. Then he
put his foot in the wall of snow & beat down a place about
half way up it into which I could place my feet. When it was
firm (from the down-trodden snow which he had stamped into a sort of flat pigeon-hole) I put one foot up & dug my nails
into the snow trying to heave myself up, but I could not. Then
he lifted me in his arms & somehow hfted me right over the
top of the wall of snow & held me over the edge. . . . The dream-record continues with much detail of description
that does not concern us here. More than four months passed
without any reference to the dream in the scripts. But on
February 7, 1915, in a D.I. with myself as recorder, the communicator—evidently the Dark Young Man, although he is not mentioned by that name—returned to the subject as follows :
D.I. of February 7, 1915. {Present, G. IF. B.)
Oh, oh ! {Pause)
He reminded me of how he had taken me up to a very high
place. The stillness of that Alpine height ! He says something
about—oh, it’s so extraordinarily difficult that I can never make them understand. I’ll try. It’s something like this

{G. ir. B. It means striking.)
Then he says, repercussion. What is that ?
{G. W. B. Striking and rebounding.)
He says, the extraordinary sensation of feeling the grip of the
foot on the snow, with that unforgettable sound of scrunching.
And then he says. This is the way telepathy comes in. I

[pause]
transmutation of memories

{indignantly) how can one get such
words ? First there’s the telepathy from me to her, the impression sinking and recovered by her in sleep, and in and
through that recovery making tangible and objective for me
those physical memories which demand cognition in a physical —in a physical something—in order to be grasped by me again, a memory ; and then he says the word stimulus—that’s where
the repercussion thing comes in—a re-experienced sensation
telepathically—not apprehended, isn’t quite right—-through the
experience of an embodied personahty, which experience was
due to telexjathic stimulus. He says this has a great bearing on

the word great bearing) an important bearing. Oh, and then he
says a German word, Doppel.

thing Paul spoke about—about his not knowing himself, only
Christ in him, or something like that.^ And of course you see the point in its relation to all mystical experience, don’t you ? that—he says what he wants to emphasise is not his poweroutwards into the material world, but its effect—oh, howfrightfully difficidt it is ! —on himself.
[G. W.B. Reciprocal action ?) Wait a minute, he says. He says that’s not what he wants.
He does not deny that it’s appropriate, but it’s not the thing
he’s wanting to say. It’s the effect on himself in giving himsuch an extension and enhancement of memory as to amount to
the re-experience of the remembered sensation.
Thank heaven. I’ve finished with that ! ^ What makes this [touchmg her own arm) so rare a—he says
he does hate the word instrument, because anything less mechanical was never made in heaven or earth—Oh ! [this exclamation was uttered in a tone of disgust and impatience) He thinks
perhaps if you say so rare an entity for us, is that hypersensitiveness of mind and body—I’ve got it ! —which not only
enables the initial stimulus to be so vividly and freshly appre-

140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumship 179
hended, but returns it to us re-enlianced and re-valued—read
from “ hypersensitive ” {G. W. B. does so)—and as it were leaving behind it the driving power of a something added to it which
springs out of herself and yet which is the response to something
received. That’s where the difference between the Verrall
phenomena comes in. The difference hes in the degree to which
the stimulus is perceived, to a large degree ; but the vital
difference is in that secondary process. Do you see ?
(G. W. B. Yes.)
And that’s where the difference about conditions comes in. H. V. especially is a sort of “ one-process ” automatist—do you
know ? M. V. is less so, but still there’s gulfs between her and
this. But for the working of that secondary step in this there
must be rest and peace. Do you know that time about which
I spoke in the beginning ?
{G. IT. B. Yes.)
The vividness of her sensation then was compounded of not
only the initial stimulus but of the answering one that sprang
from me—now that’s where it’s so difficult to say it—on the
receipt of the enhanced and heightened reflection of what I’d
already given . . .
At this point the communicator passed to a fresh topic.
When he had apparently finished what he had to say, I inquired
if I might ask a question. No notice was taken : presently the
automatist opened her eyes, and the waking stage began. After
it had proceeded for a short while, Mrs Wfillett noted the
departure of the communicator, and a curious episode ensued :
I’ve seen this room before, but I can’t remember where it is. {Points to a water-colour picture representing the Firth of Forth,
and the coast of East Lothiayi, seen from, some pomt in Fife.) I’m
not accustomed to the view from that side, I generally see it from the other side. Why has that man painted it from behind
to fore, so to speak 1 Do you see what I mean ? He’s stood m
the wrong place—stupid idiot ! You see, why I like my view
best is because I’m accustomed to it, and I’ve seen it all my
life from the other side. It makes me quite giddy seeing it the
wrong way about. You can’t reverse pictures so that they
stay right, can you ? I’m looking at where I generally stand ; and that’s what’s bothermg me, you see. {Gets up and goes to
180 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfls Mednmiship [part
the fireplace.) That’s where I used to stand—just about thered
(Points withfinger to the spot.)
I leave tliis striking D.I. to speak for itself, only adding, with
regard to the passage quoted from the waking stage, that
whereas the words “ I’ve seen this room before, but I can’t
remember where it is ” seem to be uttered by the automatist on
her own account, what follows is probably to be understood as spoken by the Dark Young Man. He may have returned after
it was stated that he had gone away, and the automatist maybe merely repeating, as so often happens in D.I., the ipsissima
verba of an orchnary telepathic communication. Nevertheless,
the incident is so peculiar that I am inclined to see in it something more than this. The personality of the automatist
appears to merge so completely into that of the communicator
as to lead one to suspect the latter of a desire to give a practical
illustration of that reciprocal interweaving of two minds which
he had described earlier in the D.I., and which, without being
“ possession ” in the full sense of the term, may yet reproduce
some of the characteristics of “ possession ”. I regard it, in
fact, as an illustration of what I call telepathic possession.
Examples of telepathic communication approaching, or passing into, telepathic possession are not very common in Mrs
Willett’s experiences. I am tempted, however, to count as such
the two instances of a transferred idea of pain described in
Chapter III. of Part I. (pp. 103-4 above). There also, if myinterpretation is right, the communicator is the Dark YoungMan. In the case of the second of the two incidents there
seemed to be a brief recurrence, in the waking stage, of the pain
in the head which had been felt in the trance itself ; and this
was followed by words implying that the automatist was
puzzled about her own identity.
Oh, I feel so giddy. I’m tumbling down. (Bests her head on
the table.) I can’t remember who I am. I know I’m somebody ; and I’m coming together, you know, and the bits don’t fit. Compare also a ch'eam -experience of the night of October 30,
^ The point indicated was on the southern side of the Firth of Forth, and
might quite well represent the position of the Dark Young Man’s Scottish
home. The automatist herself had no personal knowledge of the neighbourhood.

1908. In a lone script written on the day following Myers
claimed that he had tried and succeeded “ in getting into your
mentality In a contemporary note Mi's Willett explains :
I had had other confused dreams the previous night, as well
as an intensely vivid impression of Fred’s presence. I can only
describe it by saying I felt myself so blendmg with him as almost to seem to be becommg him.’^
In addition to the above I may refer to another note by Mrs
Willett (already cited on pp. 106-107 above), in which she
describes her experiences on being left alone to try for script in a room at . The room seemed full of unseen presences and of their
blessing ; it was as if barriers were swept away and I and they
became one. I had no sense of personality in the imseen
element—it was just there and utterly satisfying.
Further illustrations of the way in which at times the sensitive seems partially to identify herself with the communicator
will be found in Part I., Chapter III, section (c). But perhaps
the most striking example is provided by the waking stage of a
trance-script written in the presence of Sir Ohver Lodge, April
19, 1918. The script had ended with the signature F., and the
record continues :
{The instant “ F ” had been written 3Irs W. raised her head
and dropped the pencil. I thought she was going to speak, but she
^ It is interesting to compare this with the experiences of Professor Flournoy’s medium Helene Smith. I quote from the account given in Human
Personality, vol. ii., 133. “ When the seance begins, the main actor is Helene’s guide Leopold (a pseudonym for Cagliostro) who speaks and writes
through her, and is, in fact, either her leading spirit control or (much more
probably) her most developed form of secondary jDersonality. Helene,
indeed, has sometimes the impression of becoming Leopold for a moment.
Professor Flournoy compares this sensation with the experience of IVIr Hill Tout {Proceedings, S.P.R., vol. xi., p. 309), who feels hhnself becoming Ids own father, who is manifestmg through lum.”
Myers Idmself does not dispute the jii'obability that these are cases of incipient possession by secondary personalities. As the reader is aware,
I draw no distinction—nor indeed did Myers (see H.P., vol. ii., p. 197)—so
far as process is concerned, between possession by a dissociated self and
possession by an extraneous spirit. And the same would, of course, hold
good of telepathic possession, of wldch I coimt the experiences both of Helene
and of Mr Tout to be examples.

yoii’re loosed or they’re entered, and you all of a sudden knoweverything that ever was. You understand everything. It’s
like every single thing and time and thought and everything
brought down to one point. ^ . . .
The importance of reciprocity as between the communicatorand the percipient—and especially its importance to the communicator—is insisted on not only in the long D.I. quoted above
but also elsewhere in Willett scrijit.- This, I take it, is what is meant when w^e are told (in a passage already twice quoted) that
“ the response conditions the power of transmission ”, and that
this aspect of communication may be summed up in the words,
“ Thought leaps out to wed with thought Power is conditioned by response ; hence belief in the personality of the
communicators is “ an absolutely vital part of the conditions
which make it easy for us to work ” (script of May 26, 1910).
Indeed, in two remarkable passages the communicator seems
to imply that his own realisation of self when communicating
depends on the recognition of his reality by the sensitive :

all round like that (here Airs IF. moved her hands as if turning
something over) and conceive of the possibility of there being

recognition of my reahty.^ . . .
The German word beginning with Welt is evidently Weltgeist,
and the general substance of the extract is strongly reminiscent
of a well-known passage from the Preface to Hegel’s Phdnomenologie des Geistes. Speaking of the various forms in which
individuals have been organised into communities, Hegel says : “ The world spirit had the patience to traverse these forms, and
to undertake the tremendous labour of world-history . . . and
he did so because by no less a labour could he attain to a
consciousness of his own nature ”. The passage has often been
quoted or at least phrases from it : the version here given is taken from Seth’s Hegelianism and Perso7iality. The script does
not reproduce it with verbal exactness ; but the underlying idea
is clearly the same, and it is difficult to believe that the passage
itself was unknown to whatever intelligence was responsible for
the communication.
2
^ According to the view here expressed, the Weltgeist, or Absolute Sjairit, attains to self-realisation only in relation to the multiplicity of finite spirits. “ Turn this round ”, says the communicator, i.e. look at the question from
the point of view of the finite spirit. May it not be that the attainment
of self-consciousness by a finite spirit A requires not only A’s consciousness
of B’s reality, but also B’s recognition of A’s reality, and similarly with B ?
^ The last sentence in Chapter IX of Human Personality may also be compared : “ Our struggle is the stmggle of the Universe itself ; and the very
Godhead finds fulfilment through our upward -striving souls.”
184 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett' s Medimnship [part 140]
The extract has obvious points of affinity with the D.I. ofFebruary 7, 1915. It is not difficult to understand that reciprocity may be a condition of all successful communication, andan essential factor in any approach to telepathic possession.
But taken by itself it hardly seems sufficient to account for
the special characteristics suggestive of possession, even of thetelepathic order—characteristics which must certainly include
some kind of ascendancy or domination of the possessing mindover the possessed. Something beyond reciprocity seems to beinvolved ; but what that something is, and what are the conditions favourable to its coming into play, are questions to whichI do not think any clear answer has been furnished by thescripts.
I hazard the conjecture that normal mentality in the individual may involve an element of telepathic possession by theprimary self of the other psychical units in the group that enterinto the constitution of the personality as a whole.
CHAPTER II
TELEPATHY, TELA^STHESIA, EXCURSUS
I PREFACE this chapter and the two that follow it with an
admission of the difficulties I have found at times in trying to
give clear and coherent expression to the statements of the
communicators concerning the siibject-matter with which they
deal. I have done my best to throw light on obscurities, to
fill up gaps in exposition and to reconcile or explain aj^parent, or perhaps real, inconsistencies ; but I must crave the indulgence of the reader if I occasionally content myself with putting
together the relevant passages, leaving him to draw his own
conclusions.
Telepathy, we are repeatedly told, is an interaction between
mind and mind. It is fully recognised that it may, and does,
take place between one incarnate mind and another incarnate
mind ; ^ but the telepathy with which the scripts deal has
special reference to interaction between the incarnate mind of
the sensitive and what purport to be discarnate minds belonging
to the world of spirits. The process is sometimes described as a
“ blending ” of the minds concerned—a neutral term which
does not of itself raise any questions regarding the nature or importance of the respective contribixtion which each makes to
the total result.
It is with questions of this kind that the present chapter will
be mainly occupied. Granted the probability of some degree of
reciprocity in the transaction, is it yet correct to speak of the
relation as if it were always one of active communicator to
comparatively passive recipient, or may it also happen that
the activity is rather on the side of the perceiving mind, which
reads, as it were, and appropriates the content of the other
mind with little, if any, co-operation on the part of the latter ?
^ See p. 162 above. Interaction between supraliminal and subliminal in the same individual is also fully accepted as fact, although (wrongly, I think)
it is not allowed by the communicators to count as telepathic.
N 1S.5
ISO Psychological Aspects oj Mrs Willett’s MedninisJiip [partThe distinction here drawn is not merely the familiar oneIjetween agent and percipient. It is also, as we shall see, adistinction between two kinds of activity—the activity whichimpresses thought upon another mind, and the activity whichmakes the content of another mind its own. Both processesare in ordinary parlance included in the term telepathy. Bothappear, from explanations furnished by the communicators, toI)e used at one stage or another of the more complicatedmethods of communication Avhich we shall have to consider ina later chapter. I see no difficulty in supposing that bothactivities may be, perhaps iji some degree always are, concurrently operative without either of them losing its distinctivecharacter. Be that as it may, in the Willett scripts they areshar])ly contrasted, and in the important joassage I am about toquote the distinction is stressed to the point of confining theterm telepathy to the communicating actiAuty alone.
If the reader Avill refer back to the long extract given on pp.95-lK) above, he Avill note that the communicator (in thisinstance Gurney) is there deliberately trying to illustrate thenature of telepathy by impressing on the automatist a mentalimage of Avhat he remembered himself to be like when in thebody. What he Avishes to shoAV by this example is that telepathy implies vohmtary action on the part of a communicatingagent.

[E. Q.] Yes.
[0. J. L.] And that you got William James through, and
then a word that perhaps she does not know, Hyslop. Does
she know it ?
[E. G.] Oh yes, she’s read it, but she doesn’t know why I say
it, nor do you, in that juxtaposition. Let me know when the
meaning that is there is seen by you. There may be a little time to pass first, but when the meaning is plain, say so.
[0. J. L.] About telepathy, you mean it has to be purposed,
that the thought cannot be picked up from stray people, that
it has to be injected ?
[E. G.] What you say about telepathy isn’t altogether right.
It’s not one thing and one process, but there are degrees of it, and it depends on the instrument partly and upon the familiarity of the agent. There must be practice on both sides.
Here’s what appears to be a complete contradiction of what
I’ve said, and yet both are facts. Through my carelessness she
will sometimes see telepathically ^ what I hadn’t intended her
to know. There are three more - things that I can speak of. [Understood by 0. J. L. to mean three processes of telepathy.)
There’s the direct—directing—conscious—intended—what’s
the word ?

[E. G.) No, no, that’s the other end—propulsion.
more particularly, to the effort involved in summoning iqo, and impressing on the sensitive, the memory-image of himself when in the body. Cf. Holland
script of November 21, 1903 (published in Proceedings, vol. xxi., and seen by Mrs Willett) ;
. . . “ It was a tremendous effort to him [i.e. Myers] to appear in your mind’s eye the way that he did a fortnight ago, and it has
weakened the messages ever since ”.
^ The word “ telepathically ” seems to be used here, and very occasionally'
elsewhere, of activity on the side of the percipient. But possibly the phrase
“ see telepathically ” is loosely used where “ receive as a telejjathically
transmitted message ” would have more accurately represented what the
communicator wished to convey.
^ The word “ more ” here seems to be a mistake. Only tliree proceess
in all are described.

[E. (?.] My [^ivord illegible in notes] way of putting it is lettingdown a shutter. If I am what you would call very “ close ” toher, I could shut oft' certain impressions and then I can switchthem on.

\0. J . L.] Yes, that is quite clear. [E. G.] In my record there’s a case in point, that Mrs Verrallhas, of a leak which called out corresponding thought in themind which was the very last I would have desired to stimulate . . .
The three kinds of telej^athic communication here enumeratedhave this iu common, that they imply voluntary action on thepart of the communicator. Where they differ is in the mannerand degree in which voluntary action plays a part in the result.The first kind, metaphorically comparable to the deliberateaiming of a jn’ojectile at a particular object, may be taken asthe most direct and typical form. The second and third kindsare not very clearly defined, and it is possible that errors have^ See Proceedings, vol. ii., p. 201 ff., for an accomrt of experiments byE. G. where the “ subject ” was placed behurd a screen.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's 31ecliumship 189
crept into the record of what the speaker is represented as
saying. He compares the process to the letting down {i.e. the
opening) of a shutter, whereby his thoughts are able telepathically to affect another mind. When the shutter is let down one
of two things may happen :
(a) When the communicator is very “ close ” to the sensitive
he can “ shut off certain impressions and then switch them on ”.
I understand the suggestion to be that the effect of the shutting
off and switching on is to break the continiiity of the message,
and so give rise to “ the theory of unconscious mentality in the
discarnate—the coma business, ch’eam business ”. But I do
not feel confident that this explanation is the true one. Or, {b) “ there may be a leak without deliberate switching—
a
general as against a specialised impact may take place ”.
The difference between the two cases I take to be this. In
both the mind of the communicator is consciously active, biit
in {a) a particular impression is dehberately “ switched on
” and specially directed to the percipient ; whereas in (6) it reaches her independently of the commimicator’s will, and even,
it may be, contrary to his intention.
It is to this third kind that Gurney had already alluded when
he says, “ Through my carelessness she will sometimes see telepathically what I hadn’t intended her to know ”. He
admits that such a case may appear to be “ a complete contracbction ” of his previous statement that “ telepathy isn’t
involuntary ”, but he in no way withdraws or qualifies the
statement. It is evident, however, that there may be great
difficulty in deciding whether such a case is primarily one of
thought-communication or thought-perception.
If a definition of telepathy which excludes thought-perception
as opposed to thought-communication is to be accepted as representing the considered doctrine of the Willett scripts, what
term, if any, is employed in them to describe the spirit activity
of the perceiving mind ? The answer to this question is not so simple as might be supposed. The expression mind-reading
does not, I think, occur in the scripts. The nearest equivalent
appears to be telcesthesia, employed in a sense strangely different
from that which it bears in Human Personality.
The relation between telepathy and telsesthesia as it was
understood by Myers on the one hand, and as it seems to be
190 Psychologiml Aspects of Mrs Willett’ s Mediumship [partconceived in the Willett scripts on the other hand, furnishespoints of much interest.
In the Glossary prefixed to Human Personality Myers hasprovided us with what is evidently a carefully thought-outdefinition of the two terms, comparing them in respect both ofresemblance and of difference. I quote it here in extenso.
Telepathy and Telcesthesia.—It has become possible, I think,to discriminate between these two words somewhat moresharply than when I first suggested them in 1882. Telepathymay still be defined as “ the communication of impressions ofany kind from one mind to another independently of therecognised channels of sense ”. The distaiice between agent andpercipient which the derivation of tlie word—“ feeling at adistance ”— implies, need, in fact, only be such as to preventthe operation of whatever known modes of perception are notexcluded by the other conditions of the case. Telepathy maythus exist between two men in the same room as truly asbetween one man in England and another in Australia, orl)etween one man still living on earth and another man longsince departed. Telcesthesia—perception at a distance—mayconveniently be interpreted in a similar way, as implying anydirect sensation or perception of objects or conditions indepemlently of the recogmsed channels of sense, and also undersuch circumstances that no known mind external to thepercipient’s can be suggested as the source of the knowledgethus gained.
The above may be usefully supplemented by fiu’ther remarkswhich I quote from the Glossary under the heading of Clairvoyance. Clairvoyance Myers defines as “ the faculty or act ofperceiving, as though visually, with some coincidental truth,some distant scene ” ; and he goes on to say :
“ I have preferred to use the term telcesthesia for distantpei'ception. For the faculty has seldom any close analogy withan extension of sight ; the perception of distant scenes beingoften more or less symbolical and in other ways out of accordmth what actual sight would show in the locality of the vision.
On the other hand, telcesthesia merges into telepathy, sincewe caimot say how far the perception of a distant scene may
140] PsycJiologiad Aspects of Mrs WiUettA Mecliumship 191
in essential be the perception of the content of a distant
mirul ”d
The characteristic marks of telsesthesia in Myers’s sense of
the term (apart from the quality of supernormality which it has in common with telepathy) may be re-stated thus :
(1) The knowledge acquired by it is a knowledge of “ objects
and conditions ”, whereas telepathy extends to “ the transference of impressions of any kind from one mind to another ” ;
(2) The knowledge must come to the percipient independently of telepathy from any other mind that can be suggested
as its source. Clairvoyance that can plausil)ly be referred
to thought transference is not telaesthesia in the Myersian
sense. The first of these characteristics I leave over for comment
later on. As regards the second, the condition laid down “ that
no mind external to the percipient’s can be suggested as the sonrce of the knowledge gained ”, may serve a useful purpose in
assisting the provisional classification of individual cases, but
is, I think, open to criticism from the scientific point of view.
It embodies no definite principle, but only a rule of convenience
founded on the ignorance of the investigator. He may b(^ unable to suggest any known mind as a source of the supernormally acquired knowledge. But his ignorance does not
contradict the possibility of there being a mind unknown to
him, yet capable of providing such a source, nor alter the fact if
it be a fact. The statement quoted above from the Glossary to
Human Personality under the heading of Clairvoyance, that we
cannot say how far the perception of a distant scene may in
essential be the perception of the contents of a distant mind,
lends additional force to this criticism. It would have been
more logical, in my view, to have provided a definition of
telfesthesia that would have identified it outright with independent clairvoyance, leaving open the question whether such a
faculty is really found in man, or whether every form of
clairvoyance should not rather be explained as a variety <jf
telepathy. Of course, the effect would be to relegate to the
hmbo of doubt cases that Myers would have classified as telsesthetic. There is also the possibility to be considered that l)otli

192 Psychological Aspects oj Mrs Willett's Alediumship [partprocesses might be in operation concurrently without being“ merged ” in the sense of l^ecoming indistinguishable.
I pass to the consideration of the very dift'erent significance
attached to the word telcesthesia in Willett script.
It is clear from what precedes that, in comparing telepathywith telaesthesia, Myers takes little or no note of the distinctionbetween the activity of thoiight-communication and theactivity of thought-perception. Telepathy for him includesboth. In the Willett scripts, on the other hand, this distinction
assumes capital importance. Telepathy is defined so as toexclude mind-reading ; and telaesthesia is treated as incluchngmind-reading, if not actually identified with it.
I believe the distinction to be an important one, and aminclined to think that it has been unduly neglected in HumanPersonality. But this novel use of familiar terms is aj)t to leadto confusion, and in the ensuing discussion, in order to conduceto clearness and at the same time to avoid clumsy periphrases,
I propose to use the syndjol “ telaesthesia (M) ” and “ telepathy(M) ” in contradistinction to “ telaesthesia (W) ” and “ telepathy (W) ” to denote the different meanings which the wordsbear in Human Personality and in the Willett scripts respectively. I further projiose to retain the word clairvoycmce as aterm of general significance (not, of course, confined to the senseof vision), and to employ it, contrary to modern usage, to coverboth the “ independent clairvoyance ” which corresponds mostnearly to Myers’s definition of telaesthesia, and the “ telepathic
clairvoyance ” which that definition if carried to its logical
conclusion would exclude.
In order to make intelligible what follows I must begin byexplaining the meaning of a term which, so far as I know, is peculiar to Mrs Willett, namely Mutual Selection. “ Mutualselection ” is described as part of a process preliminary to theproduction of certain kinds of scripts. Success in the productionof these scripts requires (we are told) on the part of the sensitive “ a capacity for Excursus allied to a capacity for definite
selection ” ; and by “ excursus ” is meant the passing, as it were, outside herself and entering into communion with thespiritual world. The communicator and the sensitive arerepresented as “ mutually selecting ” from each other’s minds

I40j Psychological Aspecis of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship 193
the communicator from the contents of “ the conscious and
imconscious self” of the sensitive, the sensitive from “such
part of the mind of the communicating spirit as she can have
access to The part of the communicator’s mind to which
she can have access is limited (we are told) to that which can
naturally link on to human incarnate thought, but, subject to
that limitation, includes the “ potential ” as well as the
“ actual ” content of his mind.^
As the result of this mutual selection there now lies in the
“ whole self ” of the automatist the original matter from which
the communicator’s selection is made plus the matter she has
acquired by selection from him. The material so provided may
remain unused and dormant in the mind of the automatist
until the moment comes for it to emerge under the guiding
influence of telepathy from the communicator.
The foregoing explanation will, I hope, assist the reader to
follow the line of thought contained in the extract from the
D.I. of October 8, 1911, to which I have next to call attention.^

place them there ; I found and selected them : and the eight
other elements—or objects—seen in the room remain dormant
and never externahse themselves perhaps. The spiritistic
agency decides what element appropriate to its own activity
shall emerge alongside and intertwmed with matter placed in
position by direct telepathic impact.
Oh he says, give the next question quickIj^ . . .
There is much in tliis extract relating to processes of communication that I must pass over for the moment, though I shall
have a good deal to say about it in the next chapter. For the
present I am concerned mainly with its bearing upon the sense
in which the term telcesthesia is used in Willett scripts.
The statements that telmstliesia is “a power of acquiring
knowledge dii’ect without the intervention of discarnate mind ”,
and that the knowledge so gained has to do with “ objects ”,
not with “ thoughts ”, may seem, at first sight, to suggest the
characteristic features of telaesthesia as defined in Human
Personalityd But a brief consideration shows that tins would
be an entirely wrong conclusion. The whole tenor of the extract and the intimate connection which it establishes between
telaesthesia and mutual selection prove decisively that what the
communicator is thinking of is not a relation between a mind
and “ things ”, but betw^een one mind and another. When he
speaks of knowledge acquired direct “ without the intervention
of discarnate mind ”, I cannot doubt that he means “ without
the active intervention of discarnate mind ”. The language
employed might with advantage have been more ]
3recise, but
any other interpretation would make utter havoc of the entire
passage. The phrase “ without the intervention of discarnate
mind ” is misleading in another respect also. “ Without the
active intervention of a mind external to the percijiient’s,
whether incarnate or discarnate ”, would, I think, have more
acciuately represented the commiuucator’s conception of
telaesthesia in general, although what he has immediately in
view is the relation of the sensitive with disembodied spii’its.
1 kSee H.P., vol. i., p. 136, where the phrase “without another mind’s
intervention ’’ is used.
196 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s 31edinmship [part
Telaesthesia (M) and telaesthesia (W) have this in common,
that both are activities of a perceiving mind. Indeed the
definition given by Myers, if carried to its logical conclusion,
would eliminate the idea of an agent altogether, and for agent
and percipient would substitute percipient and object perceived.
This would not be equally true of telsesthesia (W), but activity
on the part of the percipient still remains its most essential
characteristic. “ I take her into a room [says Gurney],
“ and I screen off any action of my own mind on hers : her
subliminal with its useful cojiious pinch of the salt of Eve’s
curiosity takes stock of the contents of the room. Normal
consciousness is later regained, and lying in the subliminal is knowledge of certain objects perceived, not as the result of the
action of any mind, but as the result of telaesthetic faculty.”
We start, then, from this, that both teleesthesia (M) and
teleesthesia (W) are essentially activities of perception. The
difference between them becomes apparent when we ask the
question. What do these activities enable vis to perceive ? or, to put the same thing in another form. What is at once the
source and the subject-matter of the knowledge acquired by
their exercise 1 Consider first the case of telaesthesia (M). It is defined as “ a direct sensation or percejvtion of objects or conditions ”
independently of the recognised channels of sense, and independently also of “ any known mind that can be suggested as the source of the knowledge gained ”. Perception of objects or
conditio7is is a somewhat vague phrase, but I take it to meanmuch the same as the more precise expression employed by
Mrs Sidgwick in her paper on “ The Evidence for Clairvoyance ”
in vol. vii. of Proceedings—” Knowledge of facts such as we
normally acquire by the use of our senses ”. More explicitly
still, telaesthesia (M) may be described as immediate knowledge,
supernormally acquired, of facts relating to the world of
physical reality.
Telaesthesia (W), on the other hand, even if it were possible
to find a formula for it which would include immediate knowledge of this kind, is represented as having a different field of
’ By the words “ I take her into a room ” Gurney means “ T pre.sent material
to her to select from whicli is aj>propriate to a theme or topic chosen by me ”. See below, pp. 240 li.
140] Psychological Asjiecls of Mrs Willett's Mecliumship 197
operation, namely the content of another ?nind. This claim
it is that constitutes the true centre of interest and novelty in
the position taken up in the Willett scripts, and that we must
try, if possible, to understand.
In so far as telaesthesia (W) is the perception of the contents
of another mind, it clearly cannot be—hke teleesthesia (M)
direct perception of facts relating to external reality. It may,
however, be indirect perception of such facts, or what is known
as telepathic clairvoyance. Such cases are rare in the records of
Mrs Willett’s experiences ; but there is at least one example
which may properly come under this heading. She had on
various occasions spoken to me of an oft-recurring dream in
which she seemed to herself to visit a certain house, and to take
delight in wandering through its rooms and passages. She
called it her dream house, but always identified it in her mind
with a real house, of the existence of which she was aware,
though she had never been there. When, at a later time, she
actually visited the real house, and was able to compare the
details she was familiar with in her dream, with what she now
saw with her eyes, it was found that in many respects the dream
house corresponded much more closely with the internal arrangements of the house as it was fifty or sixty years ago than with
contemporary fact. When asked to explain this she replied
that she could not exactly say, but that she connected her dream
house in some way with children who had lived in it. Her own
impression was that her experience was in some sense dependent
on the recollections of other minds. If not due to telepathic
impact from those minds, which would bring it under the
head of telepathy (W), this would be a case of telaesthesia (W).
Probably Myers himself would have classed it as a case of
telaesthesia (M).
Clairvoyance of the kind illustrated by Mi-s Willett’s dream
house experience is what would be most reathly suggested by
the general description given of telaesthesia (Wj in the D.I. of
October 8, 1911—“Knowledge, not thought, acquired by the
subliminal when operating normally in the metetherial ’’. It
would, moreover, be knowledge open to verification by comparison with what the senses can tell us, in the same way as knowledge gained by independent clairvoyance, dift'ering from
the latter only in respect of its having been indirectly acquired
198 Psychological Aspects of M7's Willett's Mediimship [paktthrough the mediation of other minds, instead of by directsupernormal perception.
But in order to understand what the scripts are reallydi'iving at we have to consider not merely general descriptions,but the actual examples of tlie process which are provided forour enlightenment. When we do this it becomes clear thattelaesthesia (W) goes far beyond the scope even of telepathicclairvoyance itself. Let us now go back to the passage in the D.I. of October 8,
1911 (p. 194 above), beginning with the words “ Say I wroteof horses ”. I paraphrase it according to my notion of its purport, though, of course, my interpretation is to be taken forwhat it is worth. The communicator is evidently referring tothe production of cross -correspondences between two or moreautomatists. He sripposes himself to have taken as the centraltheme of a cross-corresjrondence the subject of horses. Bytelepathic impact he gets in a Verrall script allusions, say, toPegasus and to chariot races. (Note that both these topics arespoken of as ideas.) He “ trumps ” them, so to speak, in
Willett script with two “ cards ”, or “ objects ”, alreadytelsestlietically acquired l)y her by selection from the content ofhis own mind

horse-shoe, let us say, or the Steeds of Dawn : in
other words he in his turn selects these from the content of thesensitive’s mind to which they now belong, anrl by active
telepatliic influence causes them to emerge in their appropriatecontext.
Whatever the ground or justification may be for treating thetelepathically impressed Pegasus as an idea, and the telsesthetically acquired Steeds of Daivn as an “ object ”, it is evidentthat both one and the other might be housed in the same“ mythical room ”, and that neither has any title to be re- garded as pertaining to the world of external reality.^ It is clear also that any “ evidential ” value they may possess in a
resulting script must be tested, if it can be tested at all, bymethods quite other than an appeal to the evidence of the
senses. We have passed clean away from the province of telepathic clairvoyance.
' On a later occasion tlie “ objects ” or “ elements ” which are exjDres.sly
singled out as having been “ mutually selected ” are ajjjjosite literary
quotations. See below, p. 255.

Reference has already been made to statements in the scripts
concerning the sources of information [i.e. the minds) upon
which, in mutual selection, the selectors respectively draw. A
closer examination of these statements may help to throw hght
on the questions we have been discussing. The following are the passages on which we have mainly to rely, apart, of cour.se, from the two extracts already quoted.

Well then I look over the available factors—oh, and see what
will serve. Oh he says, it isn’t only I who select. Oh he says,
now you’ve got it. There’s another field for selection—and it’s such part of my mind, I, Gurney, as she can have access to. Oh he says. What part ? Why—oh, I’ve missed a word—something something limited to—then I’ve skipped something, but
I hear him say thoughts potential!}’. Oh he says. Put it another
way. Having access to my mmd her selection is chiefly limited
to that which can naturally link on to human incarnate thought.

I’m not saying it’s limited to the actual but to the potential

202 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partto have access to the “ whole self ” of the sensitive—that is tosay, to her conscious and unconscious self ; and her consciousand unconscious self are identilied with her siipraliminal andsubliminal self. The sensitive, on the other hand, has access to that part onlyof the discarnate communicator’s mind the content of whichcan link on to human incarnate thought. Between that partof his mind and the part to which she has no access the relationis, roughly speaking, similar to that between the supraliminaland the subliminal of the incarnate—using the term subliminalhere to denote what is highest and best in the human mind.The suggestion seems to be that the subliminal of the discarnateuses categories which are beyond the reach of incarnate mind,much as the categories employed by the human mind areIjeyond the comprehension of the mind of animals. Thus whilethe field of selection open to the discarnate communicator is the“ whole self ” of the sensitive, the field open to the sensitive is confined to what may be described, with some approximation totruth, as the supraliminal of the discarnate.
There is no great chflficulty in following the thought up to thispoint, whatever vahie we may be disposed to attach to it. Buta further (hstinction is made between the actual and thepotential content of that part of the discarnate mind to whichthe sensitive has access. The words potential and actual,applied to the content of a mind, must mean potential or actualin relation to that mind, not in relation to another mind.“ Potential ”, therefore, cannot be interpreted to mean “ possible of apprehension by the sensitive ”. It must signifysomething which is now latent but in certain conditions canbecome actual in one and the same mind. What is this something ? In the D.I. of June 4, 1911, Gurney expresses the wish thathe “ could get that word potential rightly used ”. It is themore strange that his own statements on the subject should nothave been more explicit. The potential content, we are told,lies beyond the actual, and the sensitive has access to both inher selection from the mind of the discarnate. But for furtherinformation we have to be content for the most part withnegatives. Actual and potential thoughts are not the same asconscious and unconscious thoughts ; the distinction between
140] Psychological As'pecfs of Mrs Willeifs Mediumship 203
the conscious and unconscious mind of the sensitive does not
correspond to the distinction between the actual and potential
content of the discarnate mind ; “ unconscious ” is not an
equivalent for “potential”. There is the further statement
that “ potential ” means “ possible to be apprehended of mind
as it exists in the parts—using the word ‘ parts ’ in contradistinction to the word ‘ whole ’ ” : but this, I must confess,
appears to me to be a case of obscurum per obscurius. In the
end the student of the scripts is thrown back upon his own
resources for an interpretation of the term. Does it relate to
something characteristic of the discarnate mind as such 1 or does it apply to incarnate mind as well ? We are not definitely
told that in mutual selection the mind of the sensitive to which
the communicator has access comprises a potential as well as an
actual element. Assuming, however, as I think we reasonably
may, that the distinction between potential and actual content
is to be understood as applying to nfinds in general, whether
incarnate or discarnate, I suggest that by “ potential content ”
is meant the store of past impressions which have become and
remain latent unless called up into present consciousness and
made actual by an exercise of memory. It is something like the
“ preconscious ” of Freud.
This is not the place to consider the problems presented by
the phenomena of memory, or to discuss on its merits the claim
that one mind may be able to approjiriate the latent memorycontent of another, not indeed as memories of its own, but as so many more or less detached ideas and images. All I am
concerned with at present is to interpret to the best of my ability
the statements made in the scripts respecting telsesthesia and
telepathy and their relations to each other.
Let us return once more to the statement in the D.I. of
October 8, 1911, that telepathy is communication of thought,
telaesthesia the acquisition of knowledge. The distinction
between an activity of commumcation and an activity of
acquisition is clear enough. The distinction between thought
and knowledge is less easy to grasp. By “ thought ” in this
connection I understand every kind of idea, image, emotion,
etc., forming the conscious content of the mind of the communicator at the moment of commiufication. It is, in fact, that
“ actual content ” of his mind, to which, we are told, as well as
204 Psychological As])ecis of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partto the potential content, the sensitive has telsesthetic access in
mutual selection.
What, then, is the nature of the “ knowledge ” wliich is to be| distinguished from “ thought ” ? My answer would be that the knowledge differs from the
thought only in being knowledge actively acquired by one mindof the thought in another mind. What is “ thought ” from the
standpoint of the thinker becomes an object of knowledge fromthe standpoint of the percipient. The thought is what it is has an objectivity of its own—irrespective of the questionwhether it is correctly apprehended.
Similarly with respect to potential content. Let us supposewe are right in assuming that by the potential content of a mindis meant its latent memories. Then, so far as telaesthesia is perception of the latent memories of another person, the know-|ledge thus acquired must be determined by the nature of the[memory-content of the mind from which the percipient mind'ch-aws its information. The latent memories of that mind (say,
for example, “ horse-shoe ” or “ the steeds of dawn ”) havebecome, when telsesthetically apprehended, so many “ objectsperceived ”—mental objects, no doubt, but still “ objects ”
independent of the percipient, the real significance of whichremains the same even if it has been misapprehended or distorted in the process.
It is important to notice that no attempt is made in thescripts to bring independent clairvoyance within the scope of:telaesthesia (W). Indeed, it is possible to go further, and saythat the very existence of such a faculty is ignored by thecommunicators. They neither affirtn nor reject it, but simplyipass the subject over in silence. Considering the prominence.given to it in Human Personality, this strikes me as not a little
remarkable. Whether it was an attitude deliberately adopted,or whether the omission was accidental, I am unable to say.No example of independent clairvoyance can, in my opinion,be found in the records of the Willett phenomena.
^ j1 The experience of her dream house might probably have been reckonedby Myers as a case of telsesthesia (M) on the groimd tliat “ no known mindexternal to the percipient’s can be suggested as tlie source of the Imowledgegained ”. But Mrs Willett herself, as we have seen, was inclined to attributeit to the recollections of persons who had lived there as children in days gone
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Medmmship 205
In any case, if there be such a thing as independent clairvoyance, so deep a chasm separates it from mind-reading that
to apply the same class-name to both seems to me more likely
to mislead than to enhghten.
The discussion of the subject in the present paper has been
comphcated, first by the ambiguity in Myers’s definition of
telaesthesia to which I have aheady called attention, and
secondly by the absence of any pronouncement in the scripts
for or against telaesthetic apjirehension of external reality
without the intervention of another mind. The result has been
that teleesthesia (M) has seemed to leave a loophole for the
admission of telepathic clairvoyance, and telaesthesia (W) to
leave a loophole for the admission of independent clairvoyance.
If we make up our minds to get rid of these loopholes, and
boldly identify telsesthesia (M) with independent clairvoyance,
and telsesthesia (W) with mind-reading, I do not consider that
we shall have departed from the spirit of Human Personality
in the one case, or from that of the scripts in the other, and I am
sure we shall have made a useful contribution to the cause of
clear thinking.
An ideahstic theory of the universe may resolve matter into
the content of some cosmic mind. There is a passage in Human
Personality in which Myers toys with this Berkeleian doctrine.^
But as long as we treat the distinction between matter and mind
by, and to me, at least, tins explanation is far preferable to that of inde- pendent clairvoyance. There is an element of retro-cognition in the dream
house experience ; and I find it hard to believe that retro-cognitive telsesthesia could ever be independent of the memories of some mind or other.
1 “ It was needful [in connection with the meaning of so-called ‘ travelling
clairvoyance ’] to consider how far there was a continuous transition between
these excursions and director transferences between mind and mind,

between telsesthesia and telepathy. It now seems to me that such a contmuous
transition may well exist, and that there is no absolute gulf between the
supernormal percejation of ideas as existmg in other minds, and the super- normal perception of what we know as matter. All matter may, for aught we
know, exist as an idea in some cosmic mind, with which mind each individual
spirit may be in relation, as fully as with individual minds. The difference perhaps lies rather in the fact that there may be generally a summons from
a cognate mind which starts the so-called agent’s mind into action ; his invasion may be in some way invited ; while a spiritual excursion among
inanimate objects only may often lack an impulse to start it ”. {H.P.,
vol. i., p. 278.)
206 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [partas fundamental—and we can hardly do otherwise withoutdeserting the jjrovince of psychology for that of metaphysics
so long shall we be under the necessity of treating the distinctionbetween telsesthesia (M) ( = independent clairvoyance) andteliesthesia (W) ( = thought-perception) as fundamental also.The idealistic hypothesis would not even provide, as Myersseems to think, a continuous transition between the two. Itseffect would rather he to do away with the conception of independent clairvoyance altogether, and leave teleesthesia (W)alone in possession of the field. Occasional hints are to be found in Human Personality of adisposition to extend teleesthesia (M) so as to include intuitionsof the spiritual world. Consider, for instance, the followingI^assages : A vague but genuine consciousness of the spiritual environment ; that (it seems) is the degree of revelation which artisticor philosophic genius is capable of conferring. Subliminaluprushes, in other words, so far as they are intellectual, tendto become telcesthetic. They bring with them indefinite intimations of what I hold to be the great truth that the human spiritis essentially capable of a deeper than sensorial perception, ofa direct knowledge of facts of the universe outside the range ofany specialised organ or any planetary view {H.P. , vol. i., p. 111).We are already familiar with “ travelling clairvoyance ”, aspirit’s change of centre of perception among the scenes of thematerial world. May there not be an extension of travellingclairvoyance to the spiritual world ? a spontaneous transfer ofthe centi’e of perception into that region from whence discarnatespirits seem now able, on their side, to communicate withgrowing freedom ? (H.P., vol. ii., p. 259.)
Genius, as has been already said, is a kind of exalted butundeveloped clairvoyance. The subliminal uprush whichinspires the poet or the musician, presents to him a deep butvague perception of that world unseen, through which the seeror the sensitive projects a narrower but exacter gaze. {H.P.,vol. ii., p. 282.)
Such suggestions are really incompatible with Myers’sdefinition of telsesthesia, and they seem to he rather halfheartedly advanced. Had they been definitely accepted and
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 207
consistently thought out, I think they would have led Myers to
revise his definition, perhaps on lines more in accord with the
views expressed in the Willett scripts.
The reader who has had the perseverance to accompany me
thus far through the somewhat wearisome chsquisitions of the
present chapter may, I fear, in the end lose patience and begin
to ask whether any useful purpose is served by lengthy discussion of points of difference possibly verbal rather than real.
Granted, he may say, that the terms telepathy and telsesthesia are used in a sense other than that which they bear in Human
Personality, do the new meanings give a juster insight into
the facts, or merely rearrange and rename them ? Much is obviously lost by giving new meanings to terms of art already
familiar. Has any compensating advantage been gained in the
present case ?
I do not consider these doubts wholly unjustified. The
limitation of the word telepathy to the active transmission of
thought by one mind to another, although it has hitherto been
generally employed to include mind-reachng as well, is not an
innovation to be welcomed. A word is wanted to cover both
activities of mental interaction. Telepathy had hitherto served
this purpose well, and the terminology of the scripts provides no
convenient substitute. It would simely have been better to have
retained telepathy as a generic term to include thought-commmiication and thought-perception as suborchnate species.
The new meaning given to teleesthesia has more to justify it, because in this case the effect is to extend the scope of the tei-m,
not to restrict it. Moreover, mind-reading, as an activity of
perception, has an etymological claim to the title, and the
communicators might fairly argue that this aspect of it would
not be sufficiently emphasised except by giving it a name which
would clearly indicate affinity with the other fortn of supernormal perception. If the scripts had employed telaesthesia as a generic term to include, as suborchnate species, (1) independent clairvoyance, or supernormal perception of physical
objects, and (2) mind-reading, or supernormal perception of
mental objects, something could be urged in favour of such a
classification. But actually they have so treated the subject as to ignore independent clairvoyance, and to all intents and
208 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [pabtpurposes appropriate the word telsesthesia to describe whatMyers’s definition was certainly meant to exclude. This hasnot tended to clearness, and it has greatly increased the
difficulties of exposition. I am not satisfied with the definition
of telaesthesia in Human Personality. It does not unambiguously exclude telepathic clairvoyance, as, in my view, it logically
should do. But here again I think it woxdd have been better to
let the old term stand as practically equivalent to independentclairvoyance, and leave the supernormal perception of mentalobjects to rank as a form of telepathy.
When, however, we truai from questions of terminology to
questions of substance, the sharp division of what is ordinarily
called telepathy into two contrasted activities, an activity ofcommunication and an activity of perception, possesses, in myopinion, a high degree of interest. The chstinction itself is, ofcourse, not strictly speaking new. It has always been recognisedthat the terms agent and percipient might, in certain cases,
convey a misleachng idea of the true nature of the relation, andthat when a thought in A’s mind becomes telepatIdeally sharedby B, the dynamic factor in the process may be on the side of Brather than of A. But, so far as I am aware, very little attempthad been made, up to the time when the Willett scripts quotedin this section were produced, to follow up the idea whether in
its general implication or in its bearing on particular cases.

In these circumstances the positive assertion in the scripts
that one mind may be able to perceive and apprehend the
contents, actual and potential, of another mind without thatother’s active intervention does, in effect, open up new avenuesfor thought, and if true, represents a real advance in ourknowledge of the subject. It no doubt suggests as manydifficult questions as it answers. But to expect from a single
automatist anything in the nature of a complete exposition ofthe methods and processes of communication would hardly bereasonable.
One question inevitably forced on our attention by the
1 Since writing tliis chajjter I notice that Professor Driesch, in his book on
Psychical Research (translated by Th. Besternian, 1933) lays great stress on
the distinction between thought-coininmiication and thought-reading, and,
like the coinniunieators in the Willett scripts, confines the term telepathy
exclusively to the former.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett' s AIediumship 209
Willett scripts is this : What is the relation to each other of the
two kinds of activity ? Are they in any circumstances mutually
independent, or does the exercise of the one activity necessarily
call the other into operation ?
I find it difficult to believe that the activity of communication (telepathy (W)) can ever be effective without some re- sponding activity of apprehension (telaesthesia (W)). Conscious
reception must imply activity. It is easier to conceive the
activity of apprehension as being effective without calling into
play a responding activity of communication, at all events if the object apprehended is, as the scripts affirm it may be, the
potential content of another mind. But without going so far as to deny the possibility of extreme cases in which one activity
may be in operation to the complete exclusion of the other,
I can scarcely doubt that in general both factors contribute in
varying measme to the total result. From this point of view,
instead of asking which of the parties concerned is the agent and
which is the percipient, we should rather inquire which of the
two activities forms the starting-point of the process, and use
this test as a basis for classifying any given case as an example
of communication (telepathic emission), or as an example of
mind-reading (telepathic perception).
It may not always be easy, or even possible, to answer this
question. In experimental telepathy, for instance, can we say
with confidence which of the two activities is the initiating
factor in the result of the experiment ? Both agent and percipient are consciously exerting themselves, the agent to impress an idea on the mind of the percipient and the percipient
to read the mind of the agent. In such a case the two activities
may well be independent and concurrent factors in the process.
Consider, on the other hand, those automatic productions of
a sensitive like Mrs Willett which take the form of lengthy
verbal messages appearing to her to proceed from a source other
than herself. Whatever that soiu’ce may be, whether a discarnate spirit or a dissociated self, it would surely be paradoxical
to regard these as anything else than communications in respect
of which the apprehending activity plays the secondary part
of a listener in relation to a speaker.
Yet I certainly should not be prepared to say that all mediumistic phenomena belong to this class. We have it on
210 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [parttlie authority of the Willett scripts themselves that the sensitivecan, and does, draw upon the content of another mind withoutthe active intervention of the latter. I refrain from dogmatising on the subject, but I suspect that the remarkable supernormal insight of many professional mediums into the privateaffairs of their sitters originates rather in mind-reading than inany activity of comnnmication either from the subliminal of thesitter or from some independent mind whether incarnate ordiscarnate. Here, as elsewhere, however, the problem is comphcated by the possibility of interaction between thesubliminal and the supraliminal of the medium herself. It maybe that her subliminal acts in a double capacity, as a mindreader in relation to the sitter, and as a communicator to that])art of herself which records whether by speech or in writing.
Very interesting are the reciprocal cases described in the last
chapter (pp. 177 ff.). In these telepathy (W) and telaesthesia(W) are both in operation together, but the agent becomes thepercipient and the percipient the agent in rapid alternation.“ Thought leaps out to wed with thought ”, and “ Responseconditions the power of transmission ” in such wise that theprocess may be conceived as continuing ad infinitum “
until wetwain be one ”. If complete oneness were ever actuallyachieved, this would presumably mean not that the twoactivities had ceased to be distinguishable, but that they hadceased as such to exist.
If the reader will take the trouble to glance back at ChapterIII. of Part I. on Types of Comrmmications he will probablycome to the conclusion that some of the experiences theretreated as communications might with almost equal plausibilitybe classed as cases of thought-perception. Indeed I raised thisvery question myself with regard to the awareness of “ pre-sences ” unattended by any impression of a more definitecharacter. Should bare awareness of a “ presence ” count asa communication in the technical sense of the term ? Theformal answer according to my view would be, Yes, if it arisesfrom a telepathic impact directed by another mind ; No, if it originates in the exercise of an independent perceptive activityby the sensitive. But I do not pretend that this answer wouldcarry us much further.
How are we to determine which of the two activities is
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumship 211
primary and which is secondary ? Might not both be operative
simultaneously and in equal measure ? A passage in the D.I.
of March 13, 1912 (see p. 215 below), refers to “ the unseen
companions, the presences known by that unexplored facidty,
intuition Intuition is associated in the scripts with activity
of perception, but it is not necessary to accept this statement
as definitely settling the question.
The more elaborate and comphcated processes of communication (described in the extracts quoted on pji. 192-195
above), in wiaich the material utihsed in the scripts is said to be
derived from the products of “ mutual selection ” supplemented and guided by direct telepathic impulse, must be
reserved for separate treatment in the next chapter.
I have still, however, something to say in the present chapter
upon the psychical experience, to which the scripts apj:)ly the
term “ excursus ”. The reader will remember that in the D.I. of June 4, 1911,
which was mainly devoted to the tojiic of “ mutual selection ”, a capacity for excmsus on the part of the sensitive was laid
down by Gurney as one of the conditions of successful production of a certain type of script. Capacity for excursus I interpreted to mean a power of going in some sense outside oneself
in order to enter into communion with the spiritual world.
This brief description sufficed for the moment, but the subject
deserves more detailed examination.
Let me begin by putting together in chronological order the
more important passages ^ that relate to it, only ju’emising that
in WiUett scripts excursus and ecstasy are used as practically
synonymous terms.

line ” seems on first reading both obscure and irrelevant ; but comjrarison
with other jjassages m Willett’s scrijit shows that the reference here is to poets whose jreculiar genius has given them “ some sense of insight or entrance
into a supernal world ” {H.P., vol. i., ja. 109). The poets jjarticularly alluded
to are Tennyson, Virgil (indirectly through Tennyson’s “ To Virgil ”), Browning
(“ Home Thoughts from Abroad ”), and Wordsworth—“ the unbroken line ”
being the “ Daffodils ” “ in never ending line ”, seen often since by “ that inward
eye which is the bliss of solitude ”. The names of Tennyson, Browning, and
Wordswortii all apjsear on the same page that contains the quotation just
given from the chapter on Genius in Human PersonaliUj, which makes
this inter|-)retation jiractically certain. Compare also H.P., vol. ii., p. 261 : ” V’e need not deny the transcendental ecstasy to any of the strong souls who have claimed to feel it ; —to Elijah or to Isaiah, to Plato or to Plotinus,
to St. John or to St. Paul, to Buddha or to Mahomet, to Virgil or Dante,
to St. Theresa or to Joan of Arc, to Kant or to Swedenborg, to Wordsworth
or to Tennyson.”
^ “ Spiritual initiates ” is probably equivalent to “ ecstatics ”.

of successful mediumship enumerated in the extract from the
D.I. of June 4, 1911, namely “ the possession as it were of

. . . Everybody gone ! What is the meaning of the word excursus ?
[G. W. B. Excursus is the going out to meet something else.
It’s the opposite to invasion.)
Well, that’s the way I do these things.
A^ote.—The sitting had opened with a comnumication inwriting from an unidentified source—perhaps the Dark YoungMan. This was followed by a dictated passage, in which theautomatist described, as if on her own account and from herown present observation, a scene in which certain members ofthe group on the other side, including the Dark Young Man,were taking jDart. She was evidently visualising them in theform in which they might have appeared during life. After apause the record proceeded as above.
ITie foregoing extracts make it clear that the term excursusis used in Willett scripts to denote an act by which the incarnatespirit seeks to place itself in conscious relation with a spiritualenvironment. Tliis spiritual environment—the metetherial asit is often called—is declared to be the soul’s true nativeelement. The passing into it, which is the effect of excursus, is variously described as “ the crossing of a border ”, “ thefreeing of that wliicli is capable of intuitional visions of fardistant worlds “ the falling of barriers “ the delocahsationof the soul testifying to the existence of a whole “ the escape^ “ Either you’re loosed or they’re entered ” I take to mean that the case
is one either of excursus or of incursion, and that the bewildered sensitive hardly knows which. “ To be somebody else ” and to “ feel somebody else’s mmd inside yorn- mind ” points to incursion, and what I have called “tele- pathic possession ” (see pp. 175 ff. above) : on the other hand the sense
of tunelessness and of omniscience suggest excursus and communion withthe “ Central Unity linking all experience ”.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett'’ s Medium,ship 221
from the limits of self ”, “ the escape of the smaller into the
larger
The occasional footnotes appended to the several extracts
may be usefully supplemented by a few observations of a more
general character intended to throw light on some doubtful and
difficult points, though I fear others will remain of which I cannot hope to give a thoroughly satisfactory explanation.
I have interpreted excursus as involving an “ act ” on the
part of the sensitive ; and by “ act ” I mean something that
implies conscious purpose and effort. In liis chapter on “ Trance,
Possession and Ecstasy,” Myers remarks : “ Die Geisterwelt ist nicht verschlossen : these sensitives [i.e. the favoured individuals
possessing the natural capacity] have but to sink into a deep
recueillement, a guarded slumber, and that gate stands manifestly ajar. It is rather on the other side of the gidf that
difficulties and perplexities come thick and fast ”.^ Excursus,
however, in the Willett scripts, means more than mere passivity.
The Myers of the scripts teUs us (in the script of May 11, 1911,
quoted below) that, “ Ecstasy springs from meditation ” ; and
he draws an emphatic distinction between meditation and
lethargy or torpor. The very term “ excursus ” suggests an
active process ; and the language employed by the sensitive
herself, in such phrases as “ I want to get out of myself, I’m so
tired of myself, I want to be enlarged ”, carries a similar
implication. Compare also the striking statement in the waking
stage of the sitting of June 8, 1930, in which she informs us that excursus is “ the way I do these things ”, meaning that it is by
excursus that she acquires knowledge of happenings in the
world of spirits.
Nevertheless, I do not think the act of excursus constitutes
in itself an achieved communion with the spiritual world. From
the side of the sensitive it is rather a kind of reaching out
towards the unseen—“ a hstening in silence, knowing that the
silence is an unforgoable prelude to the spoken word ”, to
borrow an expression from a script not included in the collection
of extracts.2 The attitude of expectation favours telepathic
interaction, but another factor is indispensable. Not until the
mind of the sensitive has passed into a relation more or less
definite with discarnate mind does excursus actually become in
^ H.P., vol. ii., p. 251. ^ From the script of May 20, 1915.
222 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [partthe full sense co-operation and communion between the living
and the dead, though “ the vague but genuine consciousness ofthe spiritual environment ”, which Myers claims in certain casesfor artistic or philosophic genius, is recognised as a kind ofrudimentary communion with the spiritual world d
Communion led up to by excursus may (I conceive) takeeither of the two forms the consideration of which has occupiedso much of our attention in the present section, ft may takethe form in which telepathic communication is the primaryactivity and telepathic perception plays only a secondary part ; or it may take the form in which the primary activity is thetelepathic perception of the contents of another mind, anyactive response of that mind being of secondary significance, if not entirely absent. There seems to be no reason to supposethat the sensitive cannot telepathically impress discarnateminds : in fact, something of the kind would seem to occur in
those reciprocal cases of which the D.I. of February 7, 1915(see pp. 177 If. above), furnishes so interesting an example.But on the whole it may be said that, so far as the Willettrecords are concerned, activity of communication is almostentirely on the side of the discarnate, whereas the power, insome measiu’e, of reading each other’s mind is claimed for bothsides as an important factor in the production of a certain typeof scripts. Indeed, this power in the sensitive is repeatedlydeclared to be the prerogative of the subliminal acting normallyin the metetherial ; knowledge thereby acquired is supernormally acquired only from the point of view of the supraliminal.In the script of November 10, 1912, “ the excursive power ofthe mind ” is opposed to “ the invasion into the sphere of timeof those elements which, erstwhile bound in its shackles, nowhave passed into a state of emancipation ”. And again in thescript of December 14, 1913, we read : “ I will build mytabernacle in the hearts of men, the altar not of stone, but ofthe tablets of the heart. That gives the idea of incursion, theforce which seeks to penetrate. Now give the other—to enterinto the great calm, the waveless heights. So shall that whichis in appearance twain be onei), and these are God and thouthyself ai’t they ”.
CI. H . l ’., vol. i., pp. 11 1 and 218.
140] Psychological As-pects of Mrs Willett's 31eclimnship 223
If these passages stood alone one might be tempted to
interpret them as identifying “ invasion ” or “ incursion ” with
the activity of communication, and excursus with the activity
of perception. I do not think this would be entirely correct.
I prefer to regard excursus as a kind of preparatory stage,
facilitating the exercise of either activity whether by the
sensitive or by a chscarnate spirit. But that excursus is in a
special degree associated in the scripts with telepathic perception by the sensitive, and particularly with telepathic perception
independent of the active intervention of the mind whose
content is perceived, seems to me beyond doubt. This independent activity of perception, constituting what 1 may call
the most characteristic form of telsesthesia (W), is sometimes
described in the scripts by the term intuition.
In this connection the record of the sitting of December 17,
1913, quoted in full on pp. 69 If., and again referred to on p.
218 above, is, I venture to think, very instructive. If my
understanchng of the dictated part of the record is correct, the
communicator is not one of the group on the other side, but the
“ subhminal self ” of the sensitive dictating to her supraliminal.
Speaking apparently in projyria persona, she describes in considerable detail, and almost as if it were a contemporaneons
experience of her own, the scene immortalised in the Symposium
of Plato. It presents itself to her first as a picture—
a
picture
that I often love and see. Marble pillars everywhere—a most
heavenly scene. A company of men—small company discussing everything in heaven and earth. . . . There was such intercoui’se of the human mind going on in that room, and I know it so well I almost fancy I must have been there, tliongh it happened a long time ago ”. In the sequel “ my picture that I like
to look at ” becomes “ my room where I choose to walk ”, and
various incidents in the story, including the irruption of Alcibiades and his riotous friends, are described as if they were
being enacted before her very eyes. Finally, she ends up (see
p. 219 above) by saying, “ You know I’ve not got to be tied np
always to myself. I can get up and walk aboxit in other worlds ; and I very often like to walk through the room where that scene took place ”.
It is possible that we have here an ordinary case of ci‘3q)toninesia. But it is also possible that the scene thus vividly
224 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partdescribed may be intended as an illustration of excnrsus leading
up to independent telepathic perception of the memory contentof some other mind or minds. If that be a true account of the
experience, the next question will he, From what other mind or minds was the knowledge acquired ? The answer that mostreachly suggests itself is. The mind or minds of one or more ofthe group on the other side, whom the sensitive describes as having been present and recognised by her, although not as actually communicating. Nevertheless, I cannot help suspecting that this is not what we are meant to understand. I invite
carefid attention to the remark at the end of the sitting ; “ Hownothing time is ! All human experience is one ”
; and beg the
reader to compare it with the waking stage of the immediatelypreceding sitting of December 14, 1913, especially with its concluding sentences : “ Don’t you ever walk out of yourself ? Aren’t you tired of being always yourself ? It’s so heavenly to
be out of myself, when I’m everything, you know, and everything else is me ”. Compare again a jjassage from the script ofMarch 22, 1913 : “ Oh how superficial has been the grasp ofman iq)on the truths of the sohdarity of the human race, theinconceivable oneness of Souls. . . What links is the eternalseqiience of human emotions, hopes and fears, and joys andsorrows. There is a great centre into which is gathered up all the indivichial experiences ”. From these passages ^ it is perhaps not overbold to conjectiu'c
that the mind from whose memories we are to understand thevision of the Sy7nposiuin to be derived is this same great centre,
conceived as in some sense a unity in multiplicity, or collective
unity, of all individual souls, in which time vanishes into aneternal now.^ At this point, however, we enter upon a region
‘ The extract from the sitting of April 19, 1918 (p. 219 above) should also be considered, although i/rima facie the exjjeriences described in it by the
sensitive would apjjear to be a ease of “ telepathic possession ” by another
individual consciousness, mtlier tlian of communion with universal mind.
1 susjject thei’e is confusion in the j^assage.
“ Compare H.P., vol. i., p. 31 . “ The Imowledge of the past which automatic
communications manifest is in most cases apparently referable to the actual
memory of persons still existing beyond the tomb. It reaches us telepathically, as from a mind in which remote scenes are still imprinted. But there are
certain scenes which are not easily assigned to the individual memory of any
given spiiit. And if it be jiossible for us to learn of present facts by telsesthesia
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mecliumship 225
of speculative mysticism into which I will not attempt to
penetrate further.
The extracts relating to the subject of excursus contain a good many allusions to opinions expressed in Human Personality,
and even to particular passages in that work. References to
some of these have been given in footnotes to the extracts
themselves. Speaking generally, I should say that the meaning
of excursus and ecstasy in the Willett scripts does not differ
widely from that of the corresponding terms ^ in Human
Personality
.
Nevertheless there are differences, and not unimportant ones ; and to these I must now advert.
The definition of ecstasy given in the Glossary to Human
Personality runs as follows :
Ecstasy.—A trance during which the spirit of the automatist
partially quits his body, entering into a state in which the
spiritual world is more or less open to its perception, and in
which it so far ceases to occupy its organism as to leave room
for an invading spirit to use it in somewhat the same fashion
as its owner is accustomed to use it.
If my interpretation of ecstasy as understood by the Willett
communicators is correct, they would accept that part of this
definition which describes ecstasy as a state in which the
spiritual world is more or less oi^en to the perception of the
as well as by telepathy ; —by some dii-eet supernormal percipieiice without
the intervention of any other mind to which the facts are already known,

may there not be also a retro-cognitive telaesthesia by which we may attain a direct knowledge of facts in the past ? “ Some conception of tliis kmd may possibly come nearest to the truth. It may even be that some World Soul is perennially conscious of all its past ; and that individual souls, as they enter into deeper consciousness, enter
into something which is at once reminiscence and actuality ”. . . . Cf. also H.P., vol. ii., p. 76.
1 The corresponding terms in Human Personality are ecstasy and exciu'sioii. For excursion the scripts substitute excursus ; but I do not think there is any
significance in the changed form of the word. Ecstasy and excui-sus are synonymous terms in the scripts. Between ecstasy and excursion in H.P.
the difference is hardly one of substance. Cf. H.P., vol. ii., p. 210, “No
line of absolute separation can be drawn between the brief psycliical excursions
previously described, and those more prolonged excursions of the spirit which
I would group under the name of ecstasy
226 Psychological As2)ects of Mrs Willett's Medinmshij) [partspirit of the automatist, but would not accept, as conditions ofits entei'ing that state, either that the automatist must beentranced, or that his spirit should j^artially quit the body ; nor would they admit any necessary connection betweenecstasy and possession. To admit the latter would indeed beeqixivalent to denying that Mrs Willett was ever in a state ofecstasy, for they emphatically deny that in her case possessionever takes place.
It is right to add that when, in his chapter on Trance,Possession, and Ecstasy, Myers comes to treat of the subject in
detail, the terms of the definition of ecstasy given in theGlossary are not rigidly insisted on. The subjoined passagefrom that chapter ^ may be taken, 1 think, as expressing his
more considered views : Among the cases of trance [he writes] discussed in this
chapter Ave have found intimately interwoven with the phenomena of possession many instances of its correlative,—ecstasy.
Mrs Piper’s fragmentary utterances and visions during herpassage from trance to waking life,—utterances and visions thatfade away and leave no remembrance in lier wakmg self ; Moses’ occasional visions, his journeys in the “ spirit world ”
which he recorded on returning to his ordmary consciousness ; Home’s entrancement and converse with the various controls
whose messages he gave ; —all these suggest actual excursionsof the incarnate spiiit from its organism. The theoretical
importance of these spiritual excursions is, of course, very great.
It is, indeed, so great that most men will hesitate to accept athesis which carries us straight into the inmost sanctuary of
mysticism ; which preaches “ a precursory entrance into themost holy place, as by divine transportation ”. Yet I think that this belief, although extreme, is not, at the
point to which our evidence has carried us, in any real wayimprobable. To put the matter luiefly, if a spirit from outside can enter the organism, the spirit from inside can go out, canchange its centre of perception and action, in a way less complete and irrevocable than the change of death. Ecstasy wouldthus be simply the complementary or correlative aspect of
spirit-control. Such a change need not be a S'patial change,
U.F., vol. ii., p. 269.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’ s 31ecKumship 227
any more than there need be any spatial change for the spirit
which invades the deserted organism. Nay, further, if the
incarnate spirit can in this manner change its centre of perception in response (so to say) to a discarnate spirit’s invasion of
the organism, there is no obvious reason why it should not do so on other occasions as well. We are already familiar with
“ travelling clairvoyance ”, a spirit’s change of centre of perception among the scenes of the material world. May there
not be an extension of travelling clairvoyance to the spiritual
world ? a spontaneous transfer of the centre of perception into
that region from whence discarnate spirits seem now to be able, on their side, to communicate with growing freedom ?
I gather from this passage :
(1) That complete trance, in which the spirit of the automatist so far ceases to occupy its organism as to leave room for
an invading sj)irit to use that organism telergically, is no longer
regarded as a necessary condition of ecstasy, inasmuch as ecstasy
as not denied to Mrs Piper’s waking stage, when she is represented as having “ retmiied to her body ”, and as sj)eaking ozi her own account in the first person.
(2) That though the jihenomena recorded of IMi’s Piper, of
Stainton Moses, and of Home, “ suggest actual excursions of
the incarnate spirit from its organism ”, this “ change in its centre of perception ”, “ need not be a spatial change any more
than there need be any spatial change for the spirit which
invades the deserted organism ”.
(3) That even if ecstasy be a condition of possession, possession is not necessarily a conchtion of ecstasy. If the incarnate
spirit can “ change its centre of perception in response (so to
say) to a discarnate spirit’s invasion of the organism ”, there
is no obvious reason why it should not do so on other occasions
as well ”.
I do not think it will be disputed that the important passages
which I have quoted show signs of a movement of thought in a
chrection favourable to the conception of exciu’sus or ecstasy
presented in the Willett scripts.
Nevertheless I find it difficult to resist the impression that
for the Myers of Human Personality ecstasy implied actual
locomotion in space, and that any more subtle interpretation
228 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part 140]
of the phenomena did not really commend itself to him.^ On
the other hand I know of nothing in Willett script leading us
to suppose that her descriptions of excursus in terms of motion
in space are meant to be literally interpreted. When she speaks
of ‘
‘ walking out of herself ”
, of “ walking about in other worlds ’ ’
,
of becoming “ enlarged ”, it is manifest that these expressions
are metaphorical and figurative, or, at most, are to be taken as representing the dreamlike construction subjectively superimposed by the sensitive upon the experience of a change of
environment from the “ etherial ” to the “ metetherial
Here as elsewhere, in so far as the Willett scripts indicate a departure from the teachings of Hximan Personality, the
tendency appears to be towards a more consistently idealistic
standpoint.^

CHAPTER III
HOW SOME SCRIPTS ARE PRODUCED
Mrs Willett’s automatic productions are of two well-marked
types. To one type belong those which are consecutive,
coherent, and for the most part readily intelligible ; to the
other those which are scrappy, disjointed, allusive, and often
difficult of interpretation. A similar distinction apphes also to
the scripts of other members of the group—Mrs Verrall, Mrs
Salter, Mrs “ Holland ”, Dame Edith Lyttelton (Mrs “ King”),
Mrs Wilson, Mr and Mrs Kenneth Richmond—but in their case the disjointed scripts greatly outnumber the continuous
ones, and, so far as I am able to judge, also outweigh them in
importance. The Willett scripts, on the other hand, contain
abundance of noteworthy examples of both types ; and the
main advantage to the communicators in resorting to the disjointed and allusive type seems to be, in her case (and probably
in that of other members of the group), a resulting obscurity
which conceals from the automatist the inner meaning of what
she is writing or speaking, and is therefore well adapted for the
production of cross-correspondences. The work of interpretation is deliberately reserved to the investigators. Thus in the
lone script of dime 10, 1910, we read ; “ Myers to-day I want
only allusions which others will sift ... let the pen run let the
hand he limp so shall the word come that is not understanded
of many what I say now you understand not but you shall
know hereafter ”. And again on November 13, 1910 : “ Let
thoughts flit past you cease [seize] what you can make
records that others may delve . . . Let the words come to you
a blank but of others understandable ”. Doubtless much the
same purpose is served by the employment of trance conditions
for messages which the communicators do not wish the sensitive
to remember after the sitting is over. In the early days of IVIrs WiUett’s mediumship the scripts were practically all of the consecutive type, and were largely
229
230 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsliip [part
occupied with messages personal to herself. The disjointed andallusive type first appears in the so-called “ Lethe scripts ” of
February 4 and February 10, 1910, for which see Proceedings
,
vol. XXV., pp. 122-4, and pp. 148-50.
After this disjointed scripts become fairly common, andoccasionally passages with the characteristics of each type
succeed one another in the same script. When the communicator means to embark on chsjointed script he frequently begins
with the words, “ Let the pen run ”, or some equivalent phrase.
This I take to be an injunction to let production be as effortless
and as automatic as possible.
The strong contrast between the two types of script naturally
began to attract the attention of the investigators, and its significance to be a subject of discussion among us. Finally, onFebruary 9, 1911, Sir Oliver Lodge j)ut a direct question to
Gurney.
Extract from the Script of Felmiary 9, 1911. {Present, 0. J. L.)
(0. J. L. ... There is another question I want to ask. Wehave had lately long lists of quotations, so many and so widely
supplied that it would appear as if cross-correspondence mustoccasionally occur by accident. Some of the group feel that.
They want to know whether you are sending these of set purpose.)
Yes, who says so ?
(0. J. L. Well, we have been talking it over lately with
G. W. B. and J. G. P. and Mrs S.)
Do they suggest shorter scripts ?
{O. J. L. No, they do not want to suggest anything definite,
only to find out whether the scripts which are arriving are considered on your side quite wise and satisfactory.)
Do you mean the M. V. case or W. ?
(0. J. L. Oh, I do not mean W. only ; I mean Verrall andHolland also. We think that sceptics will claim that the cross- correspondences are accidental ; also that the meaning is so obscure that we may miss it, for we assume that besides cross- correspondence you wish to convey a definite meaning too.)
They were allusive. You must get through a good bulk of
matter to get in what you want said from our standpoint. Theyare not without threads of comiexion. But hsten. Those
140] Psychological Asjjects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumslivp 231
threads extend also in subliminal of antomatist. Thus if I would say fire I Gurney might make allusion to Phoel^us or to
Zoroaster Her subliminal may conceivably go one better and
shove in Salamander
(0. J. L. Yes, well, that is what we rather suspected, that
subliminal activity was mixed with your intention.)
What ?
{0. J. L. repeated.)
Who ? Woven strands Pick out the gold thread . . . The above passage gave the first clear hint that there was
something peculiar about the process by which disjointed
scripts were produced. It was not until some months later that
the subject was resumed. In the interval Gurney had been
expressing a strong desire to be placed in direct communication
with me ; but Mxs Willett herself, whom I had met for the first time only a few days before the date of the script just quoted,
had felt a very natural reluctance to add a comparative stranger
to the number of her “ sitters ”, hitherto confined to Mrs
Verrall and Sir Oliver Lodge. Gurney, however, insisted (he
and I had been close friends in days gone by), and it was
ultimately arranged that I should have a sitting on June 4,
1911. It is evident from the subjoined script that Gurney was
anxious to explain to me certain aspects of the jjrocess of
communication.
Lone Scrigjt of May 21, 1911.
Gurney I wish I could get you to understand why I wanted
to speak to Gerald What I wanted to say was for his information and not yours that is why I refused to put it into script.
You don’t understand his point of view But it is completely
intelligible to me He is interested in the process as distinct
from the product. And it was about the process that I wanted
to speak And the less you know of the process the better . . . because the recipient is best left in ignorance of the method.
But it does not follow that the investigator need be . . .
I now come to the sitting of June 4, 1911, the first at which
I was present. After a short prehminary script, D.I. followed
in accordance with the customary routine already described.
The sensitive was fully entranced. I have already had occasion
to quote more than one passage from this D.I. in connection

left off—about the mind.
Mind, he says, was the last word.^ He says. Remember I am
distinctly ruling out the thoughts suggested by the words
telepathy and inspiration. Oh he says. Well then I look over
the available factors—oh, and see what will serve. Oh he says,
it isn’t only I who select. Oh he says, now you’ve got it. There’s another field for selection—and it’s such part of my
mmd, I, Gurney, as she can have access to. Oh he says. What
part ? Why ? Oh, I’ve missed a word—something something
limited to—then I’ve skipped something, but I hear him say
thoughts potentially.
Oh he says, put it another way. Having access to my mind
her selection is chiefly limited to that which can naturally link on to human incarnate thought. Oh he says, I wish I could get
that word potential rightly used. I’m not saying it’s limited to
the actual but to the potential content.^
^ I think “ Oh I see iiim so plainly ” is a remark made by the automatist on her own account. “ Him ” = Gurney.

to the actual content of my mmd ; it includes the potential content as well See footnote on p. 199 above ; and for the meaning of “ potential ” in this connection, see pp. 202-3. Q

[G pause ; after ivhich wakmg stage follows.)
There can be no doubt, I think, that in this D.I. Gurney is referring to the class of scripts that I have described as “ chsjointed ”. He tells us expressly that what he is going to say
is not to be taken as applying to D.I. “ when the communication is more cUrect and simpler ”, nor as applying “ to all sensitives, or even to all phenomena of any given sensitive ”,
and that all he is attempting is to show “ how in some cases some scripts are produced ”. On the part of the communicator
the production of this special class of scripts involves, in addition
to the use of telepathy and inspiration (later on explained as a
variety of telepathic action), a third activity, namely selection
from the contents, subliminal and suprahminal, of the mind of
the sensitive. On the part of the medium there is required—(1)
the faculty of excursus, (2) the capacity for definite selection
from the contents of the mind of the communicator, and (3) the
power of externalising by writing or otherwise the knowledge
^ Cf. “ the capacity for definite selection ” which is included in the
“ partial definition of what constitutes mediumship ” given in the earlier part of the sitting.
^ This remark is an anticipation of statements made in later scripts, but
I do not understand its relevance here. Cf. the lone script of August 20,
1911, given in the a^jpendix to this paper. Action and Truth which is dependant which is primary.”
236 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [pabt
thereby acquired. The power of externalisation is, of course,
an indispensahle condition of mediumship in any form ; and
this may also be true in some measure of the faculty of excursus. The role played by telepathy and inspiration in the production of disjointed scripts is left over for later consideration ; and similarly, on the side of the sensitive, nothing more is said
about excursus or about the faculty of mediumistic “ emission ”.
Instead the script concentrates upon selection, and especially
on the fact of its mutual exercise by both the parties concerned.
It is hardly necessary to dwell here on those passages in the
D.I. that relate to the somrces of information upon which, in
mutual selection, the selectors are said respectively to draw
namely the conscious and unconscious mind of the sensitive,
and the content, actual and potential, of the mind of the
communicator. This aspect of the subject has already been
sufficiently dealt with in the preceding section. What I am nowconcerned with is the process employed in the production of
scripts of the special class which the communicator has in view,
and the part which mutual selection is said to play in it. The class in question I have assumed to be that of disjointed
scripts ; and one purpose of these scripts—already suspected
by the investigators—is clearly brought out in the words “ Saythat after deliberation a certain theme is selected. ^ Then he
says something in German

ynotif—to be got through various
channels.” Evidently the object aimed at is a cross-corres- pondence with other automatists of the group, which shall
centre upon and serve to develop the chosen theme. What is wanted is not a mere simple and superficial correspondence of
detached words or phrases appearing in the scripts of chfferent
automatists. In order to achieve the purpose of the communicator the correspondences must be relevant to some non- obvious whole to which the automatists are contributing without
being aware of the inner meaning of what they write. AsGurney explains on another occasion, “ The reason, for selection
' Note that tlie selection of a theme or subject of a C.G. is not to be confused
witli tlie “ mutual selection ” which is the main topic of the D.I. The use
of the same word in both connections is perhaps unfortvmate, but should
not give rise to any misunderstanding.
Gurney does not say who “ deliberates ”, or who decides upon the theme
to be chosen. On this point see p. 243 below.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetts Mediumship 237
of subjects of C.C. is then demonstrated when the thread the
central thread is picked out.” ^
It would seem that for the production of disjointed scripts
the accumulation beforehand of suitable material is, if not
necessary, at least advantageous, and that herein lies the special
function of the selection which the sensitive makes from the
contents of the mind of the communicator. That selection is clearly preparatory : it is not made at the time of the production of the script. Is the selection by the communicator
preparatory like that of the sensitive, or does it come into
operation only at the very end of the process, when the moment
has come for actual externalisation ? Selection by the communicator must certainly be supposed
to occm: in the final stage of the process, but may it not operate
at an earlier stage also ? The very phrase “ mutual selection ”
seems rather to suggest that selection by the sensitive and at
least some selection by the communicator belong to the same
stage in the process. That this is so, and that the stage in
question is a preparatory one, is a natural inference from the
form of words used by Gmaiey when he says : “ Now then
\i.e. apparently after mutual selection has taken place] you have
present in the whole self the matter from which I selected plus
the matter supernormally acquired from me. Now comes the
weaving.”
Without attempting to pass a final judgment on this point,
we may summarise the process described in the D.I. of June 4,
1911, as including four successive stages :
(1) the choice of a theme ;
(2) the selection of material relevant to the theme, by the
sensitive from the mind of the communicator, and
probably also by the communicator from the mind of
the sensitive ;
(3) a period of “ incubation ”, often a long one, during which
there comes into play an operation described as “ weaving ”, and consisting in some kind of subliminal activity;
(4) actual production of script, involving selection by the
communicator from the “ available factors ” in the
mind of the sensitive, and the bringing in of telepathy
as a “ guiding influence ”.
^ Trance-script preceding D.I. of September 10, 1911. (Present, G. W. B.)
238 Psychological Aspecis of Mrs Willett’s Mediumshij) [part
Tlie first, third, and fourth stages are l)ut briefly indicated
in the D.I. we are now considering, but further light is thrownupon tliem in later sittings, to which I shall presently have to
call attention.
The D.I. of June 4, 1911, may fairly be said to mark a fresh
departure in the Willett communications relating to process.
It is the first of a series of deliverances of an essentially dogmatic character, containing statements which, if accepted at
aU, must be accepted on the authority of the communicators.The deliberate choice of a theme, and the partial dependence of
the communicator nj)on selection from material already in the
minds of the antomatists, might indeed be plausibly inferred
from observed facts ; but selection by the sensitive from the
mind of the communicator and detailed descriptions of anypart of the process are matters which must be taken on trust.
1 am far from dismissing them on that account as void of
interest. But my part in dealing with them will be that of
interpreter rather than critic, except so far as I may find it impossible to reconcile one statement in the scripts with another.
Next in the series in order of date, to the D.I. of June 4, 1911,
conies a long ami important passage from the D.I. of October 8
of the same year. It has already been quoted in. extenso in the
preceding chapter (jip. 193-5). My purpose on that occasion
was to throw light on the meaning of the term telcesthesia in
Willett scrijits. But the passage has an equally importantbearing on the subject of the present chapter and I am afraid
I must troulile the reader to look back and study it from this
new point of view.
It begins with a question I had already asked, and to whicha partial answer had been returned, in the preliminary stage ofthe sitting. I now, at the request of the communicator, re- jieated the question : “ In mutual selection you say that the
sensitive can select from such jiart of your mind as she can haveaccess to. What part is this ? ” Instead of attempting to
anqilify his former reply the communicator says he would like
to suggest something which will “ open another window ”. Dropping all reference to the source—the actual and potential
content of his mind- from which the sensitive is said to acquire
information, he lays stress iq)on the nature of the activity by
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediiimship 239
which the acquisition is made. To this activity he applies the
term telcesthesia—the first appearance of the term in Willett
script—and expressly distinguishes it from telepathy. “ Telepathy ”, he says, “ is one thing—that’s thought communication ; telsesthesia is knowledge, not thought, acquired by the
subliminal when operating normally in the metetherial Of
course “ mind-reading ” ( = telaesthesia (W)) had always been
assumed as the basis and presupposition of “ selection ”
; but
never, I think, so emphatically as now, or in such sharp distinction from telepathy. I have already gone so fully in the
preceding chapter into the peculiar meaning attached to the
terms telepathy and telaesthesia in Willett scrijits that it would
be waste of time to travel over the same ground again. The
implication, however, that telsesthesia is a normal activity of
the subliminal “ when operating in the metetherial ” i calls for a passing comment. In the D.I. of June 4 Gurney had spoken
of the knowledge present in the ” whole self ” of the sensitive as including matter supernormally acquired from his own mind.
The apparent inconsistency is probably to be explained on the
view that knowledge normally acquired by the subliminal may
properly be regarded as supernormally acquired by the supraliminal when passed on to the latter by the subliminal. In any
case the exercise of telaesthetic faculty by the subliminal when
operating “ in the metetherial ” is not once only, but repeatedly
affirmed to be normal and natural to it. The communicator now returns^to the risk he had previously
hinted at in the D.I. on June 4, of a false infei’ence being drawn
from what he is about to say. If the materials out of which
cross-correspondences are produced are provided ready-made
in the minds of the automatists, is it necessary to postulate an
external intelligence, and that a discarnate one, to account for
them ? The D.I. of October 8, 1911, suggests a triple answer to
this question. In the first place paid of the material from which
the final product is selected has been previously acquired (as
explained in the D.I. of June 4) from the mind of the communicator himself, and to that extent must be regarded as fresh
material not already contained in the mind of the automatist.
In the second place, it must not be forgotten that the message
1 “ Wlien operating normally in the metetherial ” is equivalent, 1 think,
to " during excursus ”.
240 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [partas finally externalised may include “ elements received bydirect telepathic impact Lastly, and this is the most important consideration of all, evidence of spiritistic intervention
is to be sought in the choice of topics resulting from the selection
itself and their relation to a central idea known to the communicators, but not known to the antomatists concerned in a
cross-correspondence.
Oh, he says, What I’m saying may be used to cut at the
spiritistic hypothesis, but it doesn’t. Again, who selects whatof the total of telsesthetically acquired knowledge shall externalise itself—shall blend itself with those elements received bydirect telepathic impact ? . . . Who applies the stimulus under
which certain ideas—use that word, not what I wanted—-
emerge, blended, which upon study will be found to be relevant
to the total aim of that particular piece of automatism ? By “ relevant to the total aim of that particular piece ofautomatism ” Gurney means relevant to what in the D.I. of
dune 4 he had spoken of as a
“ theme ” or “ motif ”, commonto a number of cryptic allusions scattered among various
antomatists.
The rest of the paragraph, of which I have just quoted the
first and last sentences, provides an imaginary account of whatmay be supposed to happen in the second of the four stages, into
which the process as a whole may be divided :
Oh, he says, Supposing T take her into a room, and I screen
off any action of my own mind on hers ; her subliminal with
its useful copious pinch of the salt of Eve’s curiosity takes
stock of the contents of the room. Normal consciousness is later regained, and lying in the subliminal is knowledge of
certain objects perceived, not as the residt of the action of mymind, but as the result of telsesthetic faculty. Oh, he says,
Here come I on script intent. Here be arrows for my quiver.
There are several points in this passage that call for notice.
First of all, what is meant by a “ room ” ? It cannot be
identified outright with the “ theme ”
: yet it is obviously
connected with the theme. We shall not go far wrong if in this
place we take it to signify a collection of materials appropriate
to the theme.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willettis Alediumship 241
Next, observe that Gurney claims to be the agent in the
taking of the sensitive into the “ room This would seem to
imply that he brings telepathic influence to bear on her,
whereby she is made acquainted with the general character of
the contents of the room ; and not till after that is done does
he screen off any action of his own mind on her and leave her
to acquire “ telsesthetically ” a knowledge of the individual
“ objects ” contained in it. This account will have to be considered in the light of later statements.
Finally, it is made quite clear that this second stage is one
of preparation, during which materials are being accumulated
for future use. It is followed by the third stage, described in
the D.I. of June 4 as a period of “ incubation ”. I think it is to this third stage that the next paragraph of the extract refers ; though it is difficult to say whether “ the loss ” of which it speaks is represented as occurring before the process of externalisation or during it :
Oh, he says, of all the contents of that mythical room say
she carries back a rough and partial knowledge—not partial
to the subliminal but reaching the point of externalisation
much as Browning’s London moon did—in the process of
externalisation, there it is where the loss occurs. Oh, he says,
of those ten say two emerge—to me how interesting. I see the work of my hand, the double process.
According to the D.I. of June 4 there occurs in the third stage
what the communicator calls a “ weaving ”. It is in the weaving, he tells us, that “ subliminal activity comes in. Oh, he
says, it’s a dangerous weapon, yet we cannot do without it.”
The “ danger ” referred to I take to be, in part at least, that of
the loss incurred in the passing of the more perfect knowledge
acquired by the subhminal into the rough and partial knowledge
which is all that survives by the time the “ point of externalisation ” is reached. Thus of the ten ^ original items perhaps
only two ultimately emerge. Further discussion of the third
stage must await my comments on the next script.
The “ double process ” I understand to mean the process of
mutual selection.
The last paragraph of the extract undoubtedly relates to the

By way of illustration the communicator supposes the production of a cross-correspondence to be in progress, with horsesas its central theme.

The appearance in Verrallscript of Pegasus and kindred ideas, and in Willett script ofhorse-shoe and Steeds of Dawn, would constitute a cross-corres-})ondence, doubtless of a very crude and elementary kind, butclaimed as illustrating the use of different methods in commimication—one of them employing telepathy pure and simple andthe other telepathy as a stimulating and guiding influenceoperating oir material acquired by telsesthesia.

The next extract to be cited is from the D.I. of January 21,1912. It is in many respects a remai'kable and impressivepassage, but it is also a difficult one both in itself and in relationto previous statements. I think I shall best consult the con-venience of the reader by following up the text of the recordwith a paraphrase which will convey my own interpretationof it.
Extract from D.I. of January 21, 1912. {Present, G. W. B.){G. Ik. B. You referred at a former sitting to telaesthesia asa process by which the mind of the sensitive acquired knowledgeon its own account. The subject came up in connection withwhat you call mutual selection. You spoke of taking thesensitive into a “ room ” and screening off any action of yourown mind on hers ; whereupon her subliminal proceeds to takestock of the contents of the room. Do you rneaii a real room,or only a room existing in your mind ?)
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s 31ediumship 243
I’ll throw something at you, and you must make what you
can of it.
I’ll take that portion of her which can emerge in uprush,
and I, as it were, link it on with that deeper subliminal which
can be in touch with what I want to get known ; so that there
is that portion of her which can normally accpiire telfesthetically
in its own deep profound plane passing on the knowledge to
that plane from which an uprush can come. Oh, he says, what
I’m going to say to you now makes Sidgwick tear his hair,
because it’s meaning the Ocean in a child’s bucket.
I’m going to call that deepest portion, nearer to the transcendental self—I’m going to call it—anything you like, any
symbol, say H. Well, the H-self and I agree on what we want —what I want—to get transmitted, and which the H-self
normally, in its own H-ness, through its own cognitive faculties, can know. And here is the “ bucket ” process, it’s here where
just because it’s the most difficult I shall fail worst in trying to
get near the thought. The H-self will touch the uprushable
self just the grade below the uprushable, and the uprushable
and the grade below will receive the knowledge from the H.
But in putting it into the uprushable focus, as it were, it will know that a sort of crystallisation, often through symbolism,
must be arrived at ; and we will imagine, if you like, that that
having been foreseen both by me and the H-self, we determined
upon what sort of crystals to aim at, so that the uprushable
self has, as it were, presented to it what I called a “ room ”,
the knowledge which the H-self is informing to the point where
it becomes uprushable. Just below that uprushable point
there’s a sort of dim moment where both modes enter into
cognition—I mean, where a knowledge of the thing as it is in
the H-stage is united to a knowledge of the crystals which,
the emblem which, can best express that which in its H-ness
cannot, or rarely, uprush—for all these states are variable and
the success variable. Then comes that moment of binding
when the self that lies in juxtaposition to the uprushable
absorbs the knowledge from H, and passes it on to the uprushable point in such a state as makes uprush possible. It then
rushes out as word spoken or written, or dreams, or never-tobe-denied moments of prescience, precognition of supernormal
knowledge. But that supernorinal will contain within it the
244 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [part
normally acquired knowledge of H—that element of normality
will be there. Oh, he says, that isn’t the invariable method,
only one of them ; and he says. The telepathic impact is another . . .
Paraphrase of the above.
In answer to my question about the “ room ” Gurney distinguishes between different grades of the subliminal self. There is a deeper self which can telsesthetically acquire knowledge chrect from the communicating spirit of that which hewants to get known. There is another self on a less profoundplane to which the knowledge so acquired can be passed on, andthrough whose action it can emerge in uprusli
.
There is also aself—“ the self in juxtaposition to the uprushable ”—which is intermediate between the other two. Let H stand for thedeeper self ; for the intermediate self ; and H2 for the selfwhich is immediately responsible for the emergence of themessage in written or spoken word. The communicator and Hagree upon what they want to get transmitted, H havingacquired knowledge of this through the faculty of telsesthetic
cognition which is native to it in virtue of its H-ness. Whathappens next is admittedly difficult to explain, but it is something of this kind. Contact is effected in the first place betweenH and Hj, and later, through the mediation of Hi, between Hand Hj. The knowledge which H has acquired from the communicator is thus passed on to both and Ho, but not in theform in which it has been acquired by H. In that form it would be all but impossible for it to emerge. Some change musttake place analogous to crystallisation out of a state of fluidity.The individual crystals should be symbolic or emblematic of theknowledge acquired by H, but they are not the chrect expressionof that knowledge. Now it is possible for the necessary crystallisation to be brought about by concerted action between thecommunicator and H. They can decide what type of “ crystals ” are appropriate in the particular case. The crystallisation itself is effected in Hi,i with the result that H2 has presentedto it what had been called a “ room ”—that is to say, a collection1 The paraphrase somewliat outruns the text at this point ; but what1 have added seemS to me a not unfair inference from other statements in
the record.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetf’s Mediumship 245
of “ crystals ” of a kind best fitted to express the knowledge
acquired by H in a form in which it can he externalised. There
is a dim moment when the original knowledge and its crystalhsed expression both enter into cognition together.

Finally comes the “ binding ”, when, under the influence of
the communicator,^ H, H^, and H^ are linked up one with another.
Hi absorbs the knowledge from H and passes it on to Hg in
crystaUised form. It is then automatically externalised, and
may convey veridical messages, supernormal from the standpoint of the suprahminal self but embodying knowledge
normally acquired by H through the exercise of its teleesthetic
faculty.
This is only one among several methods ; chrect telepathic
emission is another.
Before commenting on the substance of the statements in the
extract quoted and paraphrased above, I should like to call
attention to a pecuharity of style in it which I do not think can
be matched in any didactic pronouncement of similar length
uttered through the voice in the whole of Mrs Willett’s automatic productions. The writing stage that preceded the D.T.
had been comparatively short, but the sitting as a whole was
an unusually long one, lasting nearly two hours. The passage
we are now considering came at the very end of it, and was
preceded by discussions of a decidedly abstruse character which
seem to have bewildered the sensitive and put a severe strain
upon her attention. The record of these discussions abounds in
the familiar interjected phrases “ He says “ Oh he says ”,
whereas the long answer to my question aboiit the “ room ” is uniquely free from them. Just before I asked it Gurney had
addressed a word of encouragement to the sensitive : “ He says,
you’ve got it now, and he says. No bones broken—and he says
to me. You know, dear, I feel sometimes I must appear to you
like the Devil when he said Cast thyself down, but he says if only you’ll go bhndly there’ll be no pieces to pick up ”. I suggest that the advice to “go blindly ” was acted upon by the
sensitive, and that the almost complete absence of the usual
interjections was due to her simply repeating each word as it came and not attempting to grasp the meaning sentence by
sentence.

246 Psyclwlofjiral Aspects of Airs Willett's ATediumship [part
As regards the substance of the extract, the first question to
be asked is, Does it describe the same process as that to whichthe D.I.s of June 4 and October 8 refer, or a different one ? Theoccasion of Gurney’s statement was my request to him to
explain the meaning of the term “ room ”, which he had used
in the D. I . of October 8. His reply, couched in carefully chosen
langiiage, acknowledged his previous use of the term (“ what I called a room ”) ; and one would naturally suppose that in
explaining it he would have in mind the same process as that in
connection with which it had originally been employed. And in
some respects the process which he goes on to expound does
present the same family features which the two earlier descriptions of “ how some scripts are ])roduced ” had already madefamiliar. There is the choice of a theme, the telaesthetic acquisition of knowledge by the sensitive from the mind of the communicator, the period of incid^ation and subliminal activity, andfinally the automatic outpouring by writing or by voice. Butcloser examination reveals points of chft'erence which cannot be
regarded either as unessential details or as mere elaboration of
something previously indicated in outline.
4’he greater complexity of the process as a whole, arising
from the recognition of tlii’ee distinct “ grades ” in the subliminal of the antomatist and of the interaction between them,
might, indeed, be brought under the latter head ; for it may be
plausibly contended that this very interaction constitutes the
“ weaving ” spoken of in the D.I. of June 4 as a dangerous but
necessary operation. Similarly with respect to the so-called
“ room ” common to both accounts : so long as we confine our
attention to what is in the room there does not seem to be anyreal distinction between the appropriate “ objects ” of the
earlier description and the a|)propriate “ symbols ” or “ emblems ” of the later. Gurney might with reason claim that in
the later account my question about the nature of the room wassufficiently answered. It is when we consider not the nature of
the room but (1) its relation to the actors concerned, and (2) the
faculty Ijy which its contents are apprehended, that we begin
to realise how im])ossible it is to reconcile the two accounts
except by treating them as applying to processes which, thoughkin to one another, are not identical.
In the D.I. of October 8 we are told that the communicator
140] Psychological Asgjects of Mrs Willeffs Mediumship 247
takes the sensitive into the “ room ” and screens off tlie action
of his own mind iipon hers. Her telsesthetic faculty thereupon
comes into play ; she takes stock of the room on her own
account, and makes her selection from the “ objects ” she
perceives in it. Briefly, the room exists in the mind of the
communicator and the sensitive acquires knowledge of its contents by telsesthesia.
According to the D.I. of January 21, 1912, the general
character of the symbolic contents of the room is determined
by agreement between the communicator and H, the deepest
subliminal self of the sensitive. But the room itself and the
items it contains come into existence in a second subliminal
self (H^), and through it are “ j^resented ” to a third (H,). By
what process the knowledge possessed by one self passes to
another we are not told ; but other passages in the scripts leave
no doubt that the process is not to be understood as either
telaesthetic or telepathic. The part played by telsesthesia is confined to the initial stage of the whole operation, and in a
later script (see p. 253 below) the suggestion of telepathy
between the supraliminal and subliminal selves is emphatically
negatived. In the view of the communicators telepathy—and
we may safely assume telaesthesia also—is confined to interaction between minds of individuals external to each other.
But this is a subject which will engage our attention in the
next chapter.
On the whole I am forced to the conclusion that in the D.I.
of January 21, 1912, Giumey is expounding a variant of the
process previously described, and doing this deliberately. Why
ne should have omitted to make this clear I cannot say ; but
it is only fair to remember that in the D.I. of June 4 he warns
us that the process he is there describing is only one of a great
variety, and that he himself has much to learn. “ We must
experiment, he says ; so much is unmapped.”
Among other noteworthy points in the D.I. of January 21 is Gurney’s frank confession of probable failure in his attempt to
explain how the telresthetically acquired knowledge of the
H-self becomes transmuted into a form in which it can be
externalised. Whether the difficulty arises from a sense of
imperfect understanding on his own part, or from an inherent
inadequacy of language to express recondite psychic operations.
24.S Psychological Asi'>ecfs of Mrs Willett's Meduimship [parthe does not say. The interpreter is, of course, bound to give asclear cut a rendering as he can of dark sayings in the scripts ; but it should not be forgotten that in attempting precision ofstatement he may end by being further from the real intentionof the communicator than if he had been content to observe ajudicious vagueness.
In the previous expositions of “ how some scripts are produced ” Gurney spoke of the subliminal as if it were a singleunsubdivided self, while chstinguishing it from the suprahminalor normal consciousness of the sensitive. It would be wrong tosay that different “ levels ” or “ strata ” of the subhminalitself were recognised for the first time in the present passage.Indeed the difficulty of conceiving the self as at once one andmany had afieady been raised by me, and had been a subject ofdiscussion in the earlier portion of this very sitting. To thatquestion I shall have to return in the next chapter. But toascribe the process of “ crystalhsation ” to the interaction ofthe different grades of the subliminal is, I think, new. Possibly,however, it is not so much new as now for the first time clearlystated.
I have suggested above that the interaction of the differentgrades of the subhminal corresponds to the third stage in theprocess described in the D.I. of June 4—namely that of “ weaving ” and “ sidjliminal activity ”. It is arguable that “ weaving ” and “ subliminal activity ” in that passage refer to interaction of the different grades within the subliminal, though it is also possible that the communicator is thinking of interactionbetween the subliminal as one whole and the supraliminal.The distinction is a real, but hardly a fundamental one. Weare elsewhere told that the supraliminal is, “ as it were, theupper crust of the subliminal ”, and that “ the interactionbetween the two is continuous ”, though “ the supraliminalconsciousness of the interaction varies ”.^ If the symbols H,Hj^, and be taken as representing three grades of the subliminal no very serious objection would seem to lie againstadding H3 to the series to represent the supraliminal, andextending the interpretation of “ weaving ” and “ subliminalactivity ” so as to include the interaction of all four grades ofthe self. This way of looking at the matter may helj3 to har-‘ See pp. 291-2 below.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 249
monise the accounts of the third stage in the process (that which
immechately precedes the uprush) given in the two D.I.s
respectively, though it would not remove the difficulties presented by the problem of the “ room
If the two accounts of this stage are really in essentials at one
with each other it follows that the result of the “ weaving ”,
like that of the crystallisation, must be to reduce to symbols
and allusions the knowledge teleesthetically acquired by the
deeper subliminal self. Confirmation of this is furnished by a
hint casually dropped in the sitting of May 24, 1911. “ T wish ”, says the commiuiicator, “ I could get you to understand
the thought that underlies the word ‘ weaving ’. Symbolism is a dangerous weapon ”. Compare this with the statement in
the D.I. of June 4, about a fortnight later : “ He says, That’s
where the gamble comes in. How will it be used, the knowledge
supernormally gained ? Now then you have present in the
whole self the matter from which I selected plus the matter
supernormally acquired from me. Now comes the weaving.
Oh, he says, that’s where subliminal activity conies in. Oh, he
says. It’s a dangerous weapon, yet we can’t do without it ”. The inevitable conclusion from a comparison of these two
passages is that weaving results in symbolism, and that the
operation is at once necessary and dangerous.
Why necessary, and why dangerous ? The answer to the
first question is supplied by the D.I. of January 21, 1912.
Symbolism is necessary because otherwise the message “ cannot —or but rarely—uprush ” and be externalised. The obstacle
presumably lies in the supraliminal, which, if it understood the
inner meaning of the message, might refuse to transmit it. But
this is one of many points on which more light would be wel- come. I think we have good ground for believing that in
certain cases the communicators themselves do not desire the
inner meaning to be understood save by the investigators, who
have all the scripts before them and can piece the mosaic
together
.
On the other hand one can hardly donbt that conversion into
symbolic form is declared to be dangerous because it threatens
the integrity of the message. If a message received by direct
telepathic impact is liable to “ sophistication ”, how much
greater will be the risk in the case of a message which can only
250 Psychological Aspects of 31rs Willetfs Mediumship [part
emerge and reach its ultimate destination broken up into
isolated parts and disguised as a collection of symbols andallusions. The necessity for symbolism we have to take on
trust ; its dangers are obvious.
If the process with which we have been lately deahng shows
some divergences from the type originally described, it is to
this earlier type that the statements contained in the twoscripts next to be considered seem more properly to apply. Thescri])ts in qiiestion are both trance-productions, consecutive in
point of date, and linked together by interesting connections
of matter. What is new in them relates mainly to the final
stage of the process—that of externalisation. But both scripts
have something to say on the sid^ject of mutual selection, and
the second of the two gives illustrations of “ selected ” items
l)y means of actual examples drawn from a recent lone script of
the disjointed type. The reader may be glad to have before him
an extract from this lone script by way of preparation for the
communicators’ subsequent references to it, and also because
the script itself may serve as a fairly representative specimen
of its class.

to us. He says. In telepathy there is the mind that makes the
emission of the idea, and the mind which receives the impact
of it ; and it’s often very definite, he says. And he says it’s not the whole truth to say that inspiration is more general,
but it’s the half truth to say that inspiration is the stimulation
of something already contained in the subhminal which, under
pressure of inspiration, forces its way to the threshold. Oh,
he says. Inspiration may be from within as well as from without.

in their rough way, that a mutual selection is made—mutually
from her mind and mine. It’s possible for me to suggest to
her subliminal that at a given time such and such an idea
shall, as it were, be recovered—one might almost say, recovered
out of the sediment—and come to the top. Or I may use another process. I may hit a particular atom in the sediment
that I want by telepathic impact or stimulation, and make
it come to the surface that way. But that particular process
of telepathy I should designate as “ inspirational ” telepathy,
because it’s affecting that which is already withm the mind.

* * =!: For purposes of general comment it will be convenient to
take the two expository extracts (of March 5 and 13) as forminga single whole. My C£uestion about telepathy, insjDiration, andmutual selection refers back to the D.I. of June 4, 1911, in
which telepathy, inspiration, and selection were described as a
“ descending chain ” in the production of scripts of a certain
class. As the D.I. proceeded, the “ thoughts suggested bytelepathy and inspiration ” were deliberately “ ruled out ” for
the time being, though telepathy was later on briefly aUuded to
as a “ guiding influence ” in the final stage of the process. The1 Conteinjiorary note by O. J. L. : “ ‘ is ’ is underlined in the script, but
tlie intention evidently was to erase it ”.

bulk of the D.I. was devoted to the subject of selection, with
special insistence on its mutual character—the communicator
selecting from the mind of the sensitive, and the sensitive from
the mind of the communicator.
The extracts now before us are cliiefly concerned with the
topics passed over in the D.I. of June 4. Comparatively little
is said in them about mutual selection, thoiigh the script of
March 1 3 purports to contain actual examples both of selection
by the communicator and of selection by the sensitive.
Gm-ney opens his exposition by teUing us that telepathy
shades off into inspiration, and inspiration into mutual selection.
But he immediately qualifies this statement by describing it as a piece of bosh which he commends to the attention of Miss
Johnson. I suppose he means by tliis that the statement,
though containing a measure of truth, is not reaUy illuminating.
Why he drags Miss Johnson in there is nothing to show, but
I vaguely suspect that there is a reference here to her “ Third
Report on Mrs HoUancTs Script ”, in Proceedings, vol. xxv.,
which contained a section on “ The Principle of Selection in the
Production of Scripts ”. This paper had been sent to Mrs
Willett on July 1, 1911.
Gurney had been challenged by my question to say what he
meant by a “ descending chain ”. Telepathy shading off into
inspiration, and inspiration shading off into mutual selection, is,
I tliink, intended as his answer—but it is an answer which he
does not press, and to which he seems to attach no particular
importance.
The statements that follow are somewhat confusing. When
Gurney lays it down that “ in telepathy there is the mind that
makes the emission of the idea, and the mind which receives
the impact of it, and it’s often very definite ”, he is clearly
thinking of a chrect telepathic communication from an emitting
mind to a receiving mind of something that was not in the
receiving mind before. The appearance of the word Flaccus in
the disjointed script of February 16, 1912, is later on cited as an
illustration of telepathy in this sense. On the other hand the
characteristic note of inspiration is said to be that it operates
on material already contained in the subliminal and forces it to
emerge. It becomes evident, however, as we proceed, that
certain forms of inspiration involve telepathy as an essential
258 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partfactor in the process. One of these forms Gurney actuallydesignates as a “ process of telepathy ”, adding, however, that“ that particular process of telepathy I should designate asinspirational telepathy, because it’s affecting what is akeady inthe mind The same process he refers to in another passageas “ inspiration

i.e. stimulation by telepathic means of thatalready normally contained in the mind of the sensitive
At first reading there may seem to be a serious inconsistencyin these various statements, telepathy being at one momentsharply distinguished from inspiration, while at another thetwo are so far identified that it appears to be a matter ofindifference whether we speak of inspirational telepathy ortelepathic inspiration. But I doubt whether the inconsistencyis more than superficial. It must be remembered that Gurneyhad begun by remarking that there are as many varieties oftelepathy as there are of Imman beings. The variety oftelepathy which consists in the emission of a definite idea byone mind, and its reception by another which had not previouslycontained it, may be regarded as the most chstinctive andcharacteristic form of telepathy, hut it is not the only form.The telepathy which stimulates an idea already pre-existing inanother mind to emerge and externalise itself is a differentvariety ; and when the process takes this form it may be properly classed as inspiration. In passing from telepathy pureand simple to inspiration, we may be said to pass from a highervariety of telepathy to a lower. In passing from inspiration tomutual selection, we leave telepathy altogether and enter theprovince of telaesthesia—using both of these terms in thepeculiar sense given to them in Willett scripts. It is thisaspect of the case, I think, that Gurney has in view when hetalks of telepathy shading off into inspiration, and inspirationshading off into mutual selection.
Let us now consider somewhat more closely the statementsmade concerning inspiration.
Inspiration, it ai^pears, may either proceed from without,or, in other words, have its ultimate source in the communicator ; or it may proceed from within, in which case theinspiring agent is either the STibliminal operating on the supraliminal or one grade of the subliminal operating on another.Whether it proceed from without or from within, the material
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship 259
on wliich it works may be the normally existing content of the
mind of the sensitive, or such additional knowledge as she may
have acquired by selection.^
I take first the case of inspiration from without. Two forms
of this are specified, and it may be convenient that I should
quote once more the important passage which describes and
distinguishes them : He says. Inspiration may be from within, but it may be
from without. Oh he says. Every moment I gave to the study
of hypnotic states and post-hypnotic states I feel was among
the best spent of all my time. Oh, he says. It’s not only what
I learnt then, but what I’ve been able to apply here. For
instance ; Say, using the words in their rough way, that a mutual selection is made—mutually from her mind and mine.
It’s possible for me to suggest to her subliminal that at a given
time such and such an idea shall, as it were, be recovered—one might almost say, recovered out of the sediment and come to
the top. Or I may use another process. I may hit a particular
atom in the sediment that I want by telepathic impact or
stimulation, and make it come to the surface that way. But
that pai’ticular process of telepathy I should designate as
inspirational telepathy, because it’s affectmg that which is already within the mind.
The first of the two forms of “ inspiration from without ”
here described possesses a special interest, because no mention
of it—certainly no explicit mention of it—has been made before,
and the account now given of it may help to explain a difficulty
to which I called attention earlier in this chapter. When
discussing the subject of mutual selection in my comments on
the D.I. of June 4, 1911, 1 raised a question respecting the stage
at which selection by the commimicator from the mind of the
^ In the extract from the trance-sitting of March 5, 1912, two examples
are cited of selection by the communicator from the mind of the sensitive
(“ Who shall praise thee the grave, etc.”, and ” Blair, drawing by Blake ”)
and three examples of selection by the sensitive from the mind of the communicator (“ Pleasant is the sim, etc.”, “ put on immortality ”, and “ Light
that never was, etc.”). These examples must be accepted for what he repre- sents them to be : at all events we are hardly in a position to criticise. But
all five are at the same time examples of hispii'ation, the fu'st two of ins23U'a- tion from without and the last three presumably of inspiration from witliin.
260 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [paetsensitive comes into play. “ Selection by the communicator ”,
I wrote, “ must certainly be supposed to occur in the final stageof the process, but may it not operate at an earher stage also ? ” ^ This seemed a natural inference from the language of the D.I.,
but it was not easy to see what effective purpose selection bythe commimicator could serve at a preparatory stage, unless, insome way left unexplained, the eventual emergence of theselected items was thereby promoted.
The passage I have just quoted appears to provide an answerto this difficulty. Selection by the communicator at a preparatory stage may be something more than selection. It may beselection plus the kind of suggestion which the hypnotisermakes to the hypnotised subject, and which the subject, afterwaking, automatically carries out. The two cases are not quiteon aU fours, for the hypnotiser uses normal methods of con-veying his suggestion whereas we must suppose the communicator to convey his suggestion telepathically. But in eithercase an appeal is made to the subhminal by an external agencyto bring about a certain effect not at the moment but after anagreed interval. Inspiration of this type belongs to what I havecalled the second stage of the process. We might describe it assuggestive inspiration.
The other form of inspiration from without is that for whichprevious scripts have already prepared us. The D.I. of June 4,
1911, calls it “ telepathy as a guiding influence ” ; the D.I. ofOctober 8, 1911, speaks of it as a “ stimulus ” apphed by thecommmiicator whereby knowledge telaesthetically acquired bythe sensitive can be “ shepherded and guided up to the threshold of normal consciousness ”. These descriptions areobviously anticipations of the inspirational telepathy and telepathic inspiration of the trance -sittings of March 5 and March13, 1911.
Inspiration from without of this second type belongs to thefourth or final stage of the process—that which immediatelyleads to externalisation. It should be clearly understood,however, that both types involve the employment of telepathyas an operative influence, though the mode of applying it
differs in the two cases. Indeed the very phrase “ inspiration^ See p. 237 above.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WilleWs Mediumship 2G1
from ivithout ” seems hardly consistent with any other interpretation.
Is telepathy equally involved in inspiration from within ? Inspiration from within is inspiration by the subhminal, or by
some stratum of the subhminal, which plays the part corres- ponding to that of the commimicator in inspiration from
without. Analogy suggests that here also telepathy enters as an essential element in the process. I was about to ask a
question on the subject, which is one that has long had an
interest for me, when I was anticipated by Giumey. “ You
can’t speak ”, he says, “ of telepathy between the suprahminal
and the subliminal ”. This peremptory statement raises
issues of great interest, about which I shall have more to say in
the next chapter. But the reader will readily see that it has an
intimate connection vdth a fundamental difference of view
between the communicators and myself respecting the nature
of the subliminal and suprahminal selves and their relations to
each other, to which he makes a humorous allusion towards the
end of the trance-script of March 13 :
. . . The telepathic impact has given to the larger self the
correct soutid Flaccus—the conscious self half cognises it and
dreamily sees Tlaccus, but not until after it has been externalised, and externalised correctly. “ Tlaccus ” dreams the smaller
self No that is wrong replies the larger self (yet they are not
2 but 1 —, put in for G.’s benefit this He tried to get me on
to the horns of a duality which would amount almost amount
to a conception of the selves as separated in such a way as to
amount to 2 entities But I was not to be impaled)
.
Here also further discussion must be postjDoned until the next
chapter. What we have immediately to consider is not the
natirre of the subhminal and suprahminal selves, but the part
played by inspiration from within in the process of automatic
production. Inspiration from within, whatever interpretation
be placed upon it, is at aU events a form of subliminal activity.
It is not, however, to be identified ^vith the subliminal activity
associated with the third stage of the process described in the
D.I. of June 4, 1911. That activity, if I have understood the
scripts rightly, was of a preparatory character, resulting in the
“ weaving ” of material to be used in the fourth and final stage
262 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part 140] —the stage of externalisation. It is to this final stage that the
activity manifested in inspiration from within belongs. Weare forbidden to call it telepathic—that term being held to be
applicable only to inspiration from without. But if we look
merely to effects, and to the part played in automatic production
by the two activities respectively, it is likely to be difficult, or even impossible, for the investigator to distinguish one from
the other.
I may here refer back to a passage from the script of February9, 1911, already quoted on pp. 230-1 above.
Tliey [be. the scripts in question] were allusive. You must
get through a good bulk of matter to get in what you want
said from our standpoint. They are not witlioiit threads of
connection. But listen. Those threads extend also in subliminal of autornatist. Thus if I would say fire I Gurney
might make an allusion to Phoebus or Zoroaster Her subliminal
may conceivably go one better and shove in Salamander
(0. J. L. Yes, well, that is what we rather expected, that
subliminal activity was mixed with your intention.)
. . . Woven strands Pick out the gold thread.
In the supposed case “ Salamander ” would be a contribution
inspired from within, though a harmless one and in consonance
with the general tenor of the message inspired from without, or conveyed by direct telepathic impact from tlie communicator.But the injunction to “ pick out the gold thread ” is an admission that the subliminal activity which inspires from withiii
may on occasion be not harmless but misleachng. I am afraid
we must go even further and frankly concede that the wholeof any given production may be the work of subliminal activity,
unless the contents of the message are sitch as to afford satisfactory evidence of an external origin. But on this subject
I have already said enough in Chapter V. of Part I. (see p. 153
above).
CHAPTER IV
SUPRALIMINAL AND SUBLIMINAL, AND MYERS’S
DOCTRINE OF THE SOUL
The supraliminal ” and “ the subliminal ” are terms so engrained in the literature of psychical research that it would
be impossible to dispense with them in any discussion of
mediumistic productions. Most of all would this be impossible
in the case of a study of communications professing to come
from Myers and Gurney, and rejoroducing—though, as we have
seen, with considerable modifications—the teachings of Human
Personality
.
At the same time, as the reader is aware, I am not
satisfied with the doctrine of the subliminal and supraliminal
selves set forth in that monumental work and cannot but feel
that Myers’s treatment of the subject has tended to make a
perplexing problem more perplexing still. He extends the
meaning of the term “ subliminal ”, which was originally
purely adjectival, to denote a substantive psychic entity
capable of interacting with the supraliminal ; and yet this same
supraliminal (man’s normal consciousness) he ends by treating
as notlung more than a “ phase ” of the subliminal, or even a
faculty exercised by it. I do not hide from myself that the
constant use of Myers’s terminology throughout this paper,
while aU the time my conception of the structure of human
personality differed from his, has greatly increased the difficulties
of exposition, and also, I fear, the difficulties of the reader in
following the argument.
If ten intelligent persons were severally set to give an account
of the doctrines of Human Personality concerning “ the supraliminal ”, “ the subliminal ”. and the “ soul ”, which Myers
held to be the persisting and immortal element in man, I doubt
whether any two of them would be found to agree in all their
conclusions. But as part of my present task is to compare the
teaching of Human Personality regarding these subjects with
the statements contained in Willett scripts, I must do my best
263
264 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Alediumship [partto provide a version of Myers’s views adequate for my purpose,and expressed, as far as possible, in his own words. This will beaccompanied by a running commentary designed to mark thedivergence between what I understand to be Myers’s ideas andmy own.
I regard each man, [writes Myers ^], as at once profoundlyunitary and almost infinitely composite, as inheriting fromearthly ancestors a multiplex and “ colonial ” organism—polyzoic and perhaps polypsychic in an extreme degree ; but also as ruling and unifying that organism by a soul or spirit absolutelybeyond our present analysis—a soul which has originated in a spiritual or metetherial environment, which even whileembodied subsists in that environment ; and which will still subsist therein after the body’s decay.
Apart from the somewhat hesitating phrase “ polyzoic andperhaps polypsychic ” this passage might be regarded as beingconcerned wholly with the problem of the relation of mind tobody. So conceived Myers treats the problem as unsolved andperhaps insoluble.
It is, of course, impossible for us, [he continues], to picture
to ourselves the way in which the individual life of each cell of the body is reconciled with the unity of the central life which controls the body as a whole. But this difficulty is notcreated or intensified by the hypothesis of a separate andpersistent soul. On no hypothesis can we really understandthe collaboration and the subordination of the cell-lives of anymulticellular animal. It is as mysterious in the star-fish as
it is in Plato.
Consistently with these views the problem of mind and bodyoccupies in Human Personality a comparatively subordinateplace. Myers’s doctrine is, indeed, essentially interactional,leaving no room for the rival doctrines of parallelism andepiphenomenaUsm ; and this is also the standpoint of theWillett scripts, explicitly maintained in the D.I. of May 11,
1912—the one and only sitting devoted to the subject—alreadyquoted in an earlier chapter.- But this was not the questionthat mainly interested him, and to the problem of mind and^ 4/.P., vol. i., p. 34. ^ See p. 135 above.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Meduimship 265
body I shall not need, save incidentally, to refer again. The
real centre of interest, alike in Human Personality and in the
Willett scripts, lies in the domain of mind.
No writer has insisted more strongly than Myers on the co- existence of diverse apparently independent streams of consciousness in the make-up of each man’s personality. It was
with reference to these independent streams of consciousness,
and not to the relation of mind to body, that he gave a new
significance to the term subliminal. The passage in which this
new significance is explained is so important that I feel hound
to quote it in fulfil
The idea of a threshold {limen, Schwelle) of consciousness ;

of a level above which sensation or thought must rise before
it can enter into our conscious life ; —is a simple and familiar
one. The word subliminal, —meamng “ beneath that threshold ”, has already been used to define those sensations which
are too feeble to be individually recognised. I propose to
extend the meaning of the term, so as to make it cover all that
takes place beneath the ordinary threshold, or say, if preferred,
outside the ordinary margin of consciousness ; —not only those
faint stimulations whose very faintness keeps them submerged,
but much else which psychology as yet scarcely recognises ; sensations, thoughts, emotions, which may be strong, definite,
and independent, but which, by the original constitution of our being, seldom emerge into that supraliminal current of
consciousness which we habitually identify with ourselves.
Perceiving (as this book will try to show) that these submerged
thoughts and emotions possess the characteristics which we
associate with conscious life, I feel bound to speak of a subliminal
or ultra-marginal consciousness,—a consciousness which we
shall see, for instance, uttering or writing sentences quite as complex and coherent as the supraliminal consciousness could
make them. Perceiving further that this conscious life beneath
the threshold or beyond the margin seems to be no discontinuous
or intermittent thhig ; that not only are these isolated subliminal processes comparable with isolated supraliminal processes
(as when a problem is solved by some unknown procedure in a dream), but that there also is a continuous subliminal chain

260 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willetts Alediimiship [partof inemoiy (or inore chains than one) involving just that kindof individual and ]iersistent revival of old impressions, andresponse to new ones, which we commonly call a self,—I findit permissible and convenient to speak of subliminal selves, ormore briefly of a subliminal self. I do not indeed by using thisterm assume that there are two correlative and parallel selvesexisting always within each of us. Rather I mean by thesubliminal self that part of the self which is commonly subliminal ; and I conceive that there may be,—not only co-operations between these quasi- independent trains of thought,
hut also upli^avals and alternations of personality of manykinds, so that what was once l)elow the surface may for a time,or permanently, rise above it. And I conceive also that noself of which we can here have cognisance is in reahty morethan a fi'agment of a larger self,—revealed in a fashion at onceshifting and limited through an organism not so framed as toafford it full manifestation.
The idea of a number of selves associated simultaneouslywith the same organism, appears at first sight so difficult toreconcile with any unitary view of the nature of personality,that I can well believe that Myers must have hesitated longbefore definitely committing himself to it. In the end heaccepted it whole-heartedly as one of the foundation-stones ofhis sjiecrdation. The ])ossibility of sejjarate and independentInit contem])oraneous streams of memory and perception in oneand the same individual became with him a
“ root-conception
which he has pculiaps done more than any other man to makefamiliar. The series of masterly chapters in which he worksout the application of the conception to the phenomena ofgenius, slee]), hypnosis, sensory and motor automatism, andmediumship, will be for ever memorable in the history of thesidpect.
But another fundamental conviction to which Myers tenaciously clings is that man’s personality not only appears to be,but truly is, in some sense, unitary. The question is, In whatsense ? The two extreme views concerning the nature of the selfMyers illustrates by cpiotations from the writings of Reid andof Ribot respectively.^ According to Reid “it is impossible1 H.P., vol. i., p. 249. 2 H.P., vol. i., p. 10.
140] Pftycholoqical Asi^ects of Mrs WiJletfsMecU'imisJdp 267
that a person should be in part the same and in part different,
because a person is a monad and is not divisible into parts
”
According to Ribot “ the self is a co-ordination. It oscillates
between two extremes, at each of which it ceases to exist ; absolute unity and absolute incoherence
The problem which Myers set himself is “ the reconcilement
of the two opposing systems in a profounder synthesis It
was a notable attempt. But to me, at least, the solution he
offers us is untenable, and cannot be made to cover all the
phenomena which he sets out to explain and harmonise.
Our psychical unity [he tells us is federative and unstable ;
it has arisen from irregular accretions in the remote past ; it consists even now only in the hmited collaboration of multiple
groups. These discontinuities and incoherences in the ego the
older psychologists managed to ignore. Yet infancy, idiocy,
sleep, insanity, decay—these breaks and stagnancies in the
conscious stream were always present to show us, even more
forcibly than delicate analyses show us now, that the first obvious conception of man’s continuous and unitary personality was wholly insecure ; and that if indeed a soul inspired the
body, that soul must be sought for far beneath those bodily
conditions by which its self-manifestation was clouded and
obscured.
I venture to think that the “ breaks and stagnancies in the
conscious stream ” were no less obvious to “ the older psychologists ” than to Myers liimself. They would have regarded
them as successive changes in the content of the ego ; and so long as the sense of identity was maintained notwithstanding
the changes, they would have found no insuperable difficulty in
fitting them into their conception of the ego as a “ monad
They would also have recognised that these changes were
intimately connected with bodily conditions ; and so far as the
relations of mind and body were concerned, some of them, at
least, might have been ready to accept Myers’s conception of
an immortal soul ruling and unifying the organism with which
it is associated.
What never occurred to these earlier thinkers was the
possibility that there might be co-existent and contemporaneous
- H.P., vol. i., p. 16.
268 Psychological Aspects of Mrs WiUettis Mediumship [partstreams of consciousness in the same person, each with thecharacteristics of a “self”, and so far independent of eachother as to he xmconscious of each other’s action, or even toengage in a conflict of wills and in acts of mutual hostility. Hadthey become convinced by evidence that this state of thingswas not merely a possibility but a fact, it would still have beenopen to them to cling to their conception of a monadic ego, evenwhile driven to admit that there might be more than one egoassociated with the same organism. Myers recognises theexistence of co -conscious selves associated with the sameorganism, but does not deem this incompatible with a truepsychical unity, of which these selves are aspects or phases.
To those passages in the extracts ah’eady quoted which bearupon this question I will add yet one inore : ^
In favour of the partisans of the unity of the ego, the effectof the new evidence is to raise their claim to a far higherground, and to substantiate it for the first time with thestrongest presixmptive proof which can be imagined for it ;
a jxroof, namely, that the ego can and does survive—not onlythe minor disintegrations which affect it during earth-life—butthe crowning disintegration of bodily death. In view of thisimhoped-for ratification of their highest dream, they may bemore than content to surrender as untenable the far narrowerconception of the unitary self which was all that “ commonsense philosophies ” had ventured to claim. The “ consciousself ” of each of us, as we call it,—the empirical, the supraliminal self, as I should prefer to say—does not comprise thewhole of the consciousness or of the faculty within us. Thereexists a yet more comprehensive consciousness, a profounderfaculty, which for the most part remains potential only so faras regards the life of earth, but from which the consciousnessand the faculty of earth-life are mere selections, and whichreasserts itself in its plenitude after the liberating change ofdeath.
Let me now try to sum up in a series of propositions thevarious statements concerning the nature of the soul made inthe foregoing passages.
(1) The soul is a spiritual entity which existed before its' H.F., vo\. i., pp. 11, 12.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Medimnship 269
association with the body, and will continue to exist
after that association has been dissolved by bodily
death.
(2) In its hberated condition the soul is unanalysable by us,
but is in communion with the spiritual or metetherial
world. Even in its embodied life commimion with the
spiritual world, though hampered and limited, is not
wholly lost.
(3) The soul is essentially distinct from the bodily organism
which it rules and unifies. How it rules and unifies the
bodily organism is wholly unknown to us.
(4) As regards the diverse streams of consciousness sufficiently
independent of each other to merit the description of
“ selves ”, which experience shows can exist contemporaneoUsly in the individual man, the soul is not a mere agent of unification of these lesser selves, but is
itself their unity. It is the whole of which they are
parts.
If we seek to place a definite meaning upon the last of these
propositions, it is evidently essential to come to a clear understanding of what we mean by a
“ self ”. Strange to say, Myers
never seems to have undertaken a systematic examination into
the question here raised. When he speaks of the soul as a
self, and when he applies the same term to “ the continuous
subhminal chain of memory (or more chains than one) involving
just that persistent revival of old impressions, and response to
new ones, which we commonly call a ‘ self’ ”, is he using the
term in the same sense in both cases ? If he is, then he ought
to regard the independent streams of consciousness as self- conscious egos, aware of their continuing identity, and of their
distinction from other self-conscious egos, and from the bodily
organism with which they are associated. If, on the other hand,
he is using the term self in different senses in the two cases, this
should have been made abundantly clear and the nature of the
differenee carefully defined. As a matter of fact he seems to me
to waver between two incompatible points of view. Sometimes
he appears to regard the independent currents of consciousness
as genuine psychic entities with all the attribirtes of a self- conseious being ; at other times as merely different activities or states of such a being. The two conceptions remain unre-
270 Psycliological Asjyects of Mrs WUleti's Mecliumship [partconciled ; and 1 doubt whether Myers ever sufficiently recognised the incongruity between them. Yet the distinction is surely fundamental. Except in a metaphorical sense the different activities of a self-conscious being have no more right to thetitle of “ selves ” than have the unattended “ thoughts withouta thinker ” of a very different school of psychologists.
If the “ selves ” referred to in proposition (4) are to be takenas real psychical entities or egos, the doctrine of the soldenunciated in it would bear a strong family resemblance toFechner’s theory of the compounding of consciousness. In theform of the theory maintained by Fechner the unity resultingfrom the comjiounding of consciousness is nothing but thecomponents themselves, although nevertheless each componentretains its separate individuality inside the unity. The theoryof the compounding of consciousnesses presents formidablelogical difficulties ; for how can co-conscious egos be at thesame time one and the same ego ? Notwithstanding thesedifficulties Fechner’s idea had a strong attraction for no less athinker than William James ; and it is interesting to note thatJames himself has called attention to the connection betweenthe Fechnerian doctrine and the phenomena studied bypsychical research.^ But if at any time Myers’s speculations onthe structure of human ])ersonality lieckoned him in the direction of a mystic interpretation on the lines of a comjiounchng ofconsciousnesses, such an interpretation certainly did not represent his fully considered views.
I do not think any of the statements concerning the soul madein the introductory chapter to Human Personality carry usmuch beyond the four propositions enumerated above. Butin Chapter VI. a new development of the doctrine introducesus to that part of it which is most characteristic of its author.“ The subliminal ”, which hitherto has been treated as only apart or fragment of a larger whole, is now identihed with thatwhole itself ; in other words, with the soul.
Myers himself is fully alive to the signilicance of the steji thustaken, as the opening words of Chapter VI. bear witness ; ^
We have now reached [he writes] a central node in ourcomplex argument. Several lines of evidence, already pursued,^ Lectures on a Pluralistic Universe, p. 315. ^ H.F., vol. i., p. 220.

converge liere to form the starting-point for a new departure.
Our view of the subliminal self must pass in this chapter
through a profound transition. The glimpses which we have
till now obtained of it have shown it as something incidental,
subordinate, fragmentary. But henceforth it will gradually assume the character of something persistent, principal,
unitary ; appearing at last as the deepest and most permanent
representative of man’s true being.
To the forir previous propositions, therefoi’e, we can now add
a fifth :
(5) The soul and the subliminal are one.’^ Again, a couple of pages later we read : By ordinary psychology, supraliminal life is accepted as representing the normal or substantive personahty, of which
subliminal life is the semi-conscious substratum, or halfilluminated fringe, or the morbid excrescence. I, on the other
hand, regard supraliminal life merely as a privileged case of
personality ; a special phase of our personality, which is easiest
for us to study, because it is simplified for us by our ready
consciousness of what is going on in it ; yet which is by no means necessarily either central or prepotent, could we see our whole being in comprehensive view.
Now if we regard the whole supraliminal personality as a
special case of something much more extensive, it follows that
we must similarly regard all human faculty, and each sense
severally, as mere special or privileged cases of some more
general power.
All human terrene faculty will be in this view simply a
selection from faculty existing in the metetherial world ; such
part of that antecedent, even if not individualised, faculty as may be expressible through each several human organism.
1 If all the five propositions be read together it would seem to result that
the subliminal is at once a part of the whole, and also the whole itself. I cannot
recall that Myers has anywhere given a clear and authoritative explanation
of this apparent paradox. ]More than one exjilanation might perhaps be
attempted. Nevertheless I suspect there is confusion of thought here. The
difficulty is, I think, only the old one of conceiving how co-conscious selves can at the same time be one and the same self. Fechner’s solution I can
only describe as frankly mystical. Myers seems to me to end V)y ignoring
the problem, and to be hardly aware that any difficulty exists.
272 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumshi'p [partThese passages seem definitely to negative the idea of personality as comprising independent co-conscious streams ofmentality, each with the characteristic of a true self. The“ selves ”, although still called selves, have become “ phases ”of a single self. In coming down so distinctly on the Unitarianside of the controversy, it was more than ever incumbent onMyers to explain how the independent currents of consciousnesscan appear to have the characteristics of selves without beingtrue selves. This he has not done. I cannot but hold that inneglecting to deal with this difficulty he has failed to give usthat “ profounder synthesis ” of conflicting views which he set
out to provide. The problem of reconciling unity and pluralityis not solved by practically denying plurality, or by disguisingit in the form of layers or strata of a single unitary self. Whatis more, the conception of a plurality of selves within the personality persistently refuses to be suppressed or ignored. It
continues to assert itself all through the book, and is, I believe,
forced upon us by much of the very evidence which Myershimself has so laboriously collected. Let me cite one passageout of the many that would equally serve to illustrate the jDoint ; ^
These splits of personality seem occasionally to destroy all sympathy between the normal individual and a divergent
fraction. No great sympathy was felt by Leonie II. for Leonie I. And Dr Morton Prince’s case shows us in the deepest and ablest
of the personalities of his “ Miss Beauchamp ” positively spiteful
in its relation to her main identity.
Bizarre though a house thus divided against itself may seem,
the moral dissidence is merely an exaggeration of the moral
discontinuity already observable in the typical case of MrsNewnham. There the secondary intelligence was merely tricky,
not malevolent. But its trickiness was wholly alien from MrsNewnham’s character,—was something, indeed, which she
would have energetically repudiated.
It seems, therefore,—and the analogy of dreams points in
this direction also,—that our moral nature is as easily split
up as our intellectual nature, and that we camiot be any moi'e
certain that the minor current of personality which is diverted
into some new channel will retain inoral than that it will retain
intellectual coherence.
' See H.P., vol. ii., p. l‘J9.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willeff's Medimnship 273
In spite of the disparaging remarks which Myers in this
passage bestows on the secondary personahties in the cases of
Miss Beauchamp and of Mrs Newnham, it is nevertheless of the
essence of the “ new departime ” to exalt the sidjliminal at the
expense of the supraliminal consciousness.
There are times when the doctrine which identifies the true
self of a man with the subliminal seems in Myers’s hands to
imply no more than a broad claim that the capacity of the
human mind is manifested at its highest and best in communion
with the spiritual world. But at other times his language goes
far beyond this, and presents us with the picture of a mind
divided, as it were, into compartments each with a distinct
consciousness and memory of its own. Intercourse with the
world of the senses is assigned to the supraliminal compartment,
intercourse with the metetherial to the subliminal. Based upon
a conception of this kind the identification of man’s true self
with his subliminal self appears to me as a paradox which even
Myers’s literary skill and fervour of conviction have failed to
make plausible. It coidd not for a moment be maintained if the separate currents of mentality were interpreted as being
genuinely distinct selves. The true self of a man could not in
that case be other than the self of which he has direct and
immediate knowledge. But even when I do my best to place
myself at Myers’s point of view, and try to conceive co-conscious
intelligences as “ phases ” of a single self-conscious ego, I altogether fail to see why this single self-conscious ego is to be
identified with the subliminal self (or selves) rather than with
the supraliminal self which both common sense and orthodox
psychology treat as the true self of a man. We are asked to
believe that our true self is a self the very existence of which the
vast majority of mankind have never even suspected. The
main evidence for its existence is derived from the phenomena
of abnormal psychology, and in particular from the comparatively rare occasions when the subliminal ceases to be subliminal,
and “ messages ” pass from it, in some way which we shall
presently have to consider, into supraliminal consciousness.
When this happens what takes place ? If the subliminal
“ phase ” of a man’s consciousness represented his true self, we
might actually expect that, on ceasing to be subliminal, it would absorb into itself the supralimina] phase, and the two
274 Psychological Aspects of M7's Willett's Mediumship [partjjhases would be as one self. But the facts point quite the otherway.
When the subliminal ceases to be subliminal and manifestsitself to the supraliminal, we have what is called dissociation ofthe personality. Dissociation implies at least duality wherepreviously there has been every appearance of unity. Whatmay be the relation of the dissociated elements before and afterdissociation is a very obsciire problem which offers a wide field
to conjecture and speculation. The continued existence of thesidjliminal, at times when it is subliminal, may be a plausibleinference from the observed phenomena, but ex vi termini thesupraliminal can have no direct experience of it. All we canaffirm with certainty is that at such times the supraliminalconsciousness appears to itself to be in solitary possession.Dining dissociation, on the other hand, the supraliminalrecognises the presence of an agency which it distinguishes fromitself ; but it does not lose its sense of personal identity overand against that agency. The sense of personal identity persists alike through the normal and the abnormal state. ^ It is true that in extreme cases of alternations of personality thenormal consciousness may seem to be dispossessed altogether.But this is not, in my view at least, to be interpreted as amerging into unity of one phase of consciousness in another, butrather as the temporary replacement in control of the organismof one self by another self. In an earlier chapter ^ on dissociation of the personahty I have given an account of an interesting experience that befelMrs Willett in which her normal self seemed to develop into aduality of independent selves, or “ minds ” as she calls them,
one of the two minds being “ me as I know myself”, and theother a mind which she somehow connects with herself, but at^ Tlie jihenomenon of cli.ssociation may also be considered from tlie other
.side, that is to say, from the side of tlie hitherto subliminal self which has
now, by reason of dissociation, ceased to be subliminal in the adjectival sense, and is ajiprehendcd by the supraliminal as an independent communicatingagency. Does the subliminal self, when thus made manifest to the supraliminal consciousness, claim identity with that consciousness ? On the contrary, we find the secondary self insisting on its separate individuality, evento the j)oint of claiming—falsely, if it is in truth only a secondary self—to
l)e a genuinely external communicator.
^ See pp. 143 If.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediimisliip 275
the same time distinguishes from the “ me as I know myself
Presently the two minds seemed to “ hash into one, and I at once knew what I was to do ”, The meaning of this I take to
be that what the other mind willed her to do had now become
part of her own will. But whatever interpretation we place
upon the two minds “ flashing into one ”, it is clear that in the
result it is the supraliminal that remains in possession of the
fleld, while the subliminal subsides into subliminality.
My own instinctive conviction is that my true self is the
“ me as I know myself ”, and that it will be as this me, with its formed character and stored memories, that I shall survive, if survival there be. Other selves co-conscious with “ me as I know myself” may also survive. If so, it is permissible to
hazard a guess that as they have ajjparently co-operated when
in the body, so they, or some of them, may continue to co- operate when no longer in the body, and that each of us may
And himself in the “ metetherial ” world the member of a group
of selves with which he has already, when in the body, been
associated in closer relation than with the rest of his environment. But here we enter a region where no verification is possible.
I do not propose to dwell at length on the objections that may
be urged against Myers’s theory in connection with the separate
memories of the minor selves (or self-like elements) within the
personahty ^
; nor, again, on the difficulties inevitably suggested
by his frank admission that the subliminal is a rubbish heap as
1 To overcome the difficulties arising out of the separateness of tlie memory
chains of the minor selves it would be necessary to assume that the subliminal,
as identified with the soul, not merely has access to the memories of the
supraliminal, but appropriates them as memories of its own : otherwise it would not be the “ I as I know myself ” that sui'vives, but another personality
altogether. This is hard to reconcile with Myers’s “ root-conception ” (see
p. 266 above) of the dissociability of the self as “ the possibility that different fractions of the personality can act so far independently of each other that
the one is not conscious of the other’s action ”. It is also, I think, inconsistent
with the observed facts in certain cases of multiple personality. See on this subject McDougall’s Outline of Abnormal Psychology, p. .542 : “ We find repeatedly that, when one iDersonality obtains command of the memoi'ies of another, he distinguishes between his own memories and those of that other. And when a co-consoious personality is aware of the thoughts and feelings
of the other, it is not that for the time being the two personalities become
merged in one common stream of thinking. Rather the co-conscious per-
276 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediiimship [partwell as a treasure house. ^ These objections and difficulties I do,
indeed, regard as fatal to his peculiar conception of the subliminal as representing the true unitary self in man, and the
persisting element in him which survives the dissolution of the
body. But I pass them by and proceed to enquire why, in the
face of so many obvious considerations, Myers still adheres to
that conception, and makes it in fact the central feature of his
whole system.
The explanation is not, I think, far to seek. It lies in Myers’s
firm conviction, ah’eady referred to, that direct (i.e. telepathic)
communion between individual minds represents the highest
activity of which the soul is capable, and that the exercise of
that activity is strictly the prerogative of the subhminal. I maysay at once that I should hold the latter view to be unproved,
even on his own hypothesis of a unitary soul divided into
supraliminal and subliminal compartments. Yet it is notaltogether surprising that Myers should have been attracted to
it. There could be no doubt that many of the most remarkablecases of supernormal phenomena recorded in Proceedings of the
S.P.R. have been accompanied by dissociation. Might not
dissociation, and the subliminal activity implied in dissociation,
be the indispensable condition of such phenomena, and not
merely incidental concomitants of their occurrence ? It is true that supernormal manifestations occur also when the
percipient is to all appearance in a perfectly normal condition.
But it is always possible to suppose that in these cases too there
has been some measure of dissociation, even though so slight as to pass unnoticed. On that assumption may we not further
suppose that the actual recipient of the telepathic message is the subliminal self, and that it is through the subliminal self,
and not directly, that the supraliminal self becomes aware of
it ? One step farther and we reach the position definitely taken
up by Myers that supernormal powers are the exclusive prerogative of the subliminal, and that the subliminal alone is
sonality reports the exjDeriences of the other as something of whicli he becomes
aware as experiences foreign to himself ; he knows wliat the other thinks
and feels, but he has also his own thoughts and feelings about the same
object or topic ”.
1 H.P., vol. i., p. 72i It was to this feature in Myers’s conception of the
subliminal that William .Tames took the strongest exception. See his review
of Human Personality in Proceedings, vol. xviii., p. 32.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Alediumship 277
equipped to share in the free eommunion with a spiritual world
which awaits the surviving soul.
I cannot, of course, say that it was iJrecisely by these steps
that Myers arrived at his conclusion. But he ended by formulating it quite exphcitly. In the Scheme of Vital Faculty,
which forms an Appendix to Chapter IX. in vol. ii. of Human
Personality, he distinguishes between
I. The supraliminal, or empirical, consciousness ; aware only
of the material world through sensory impressions ; II. The subliminal consciousness ; obscurely aware of the
transcendental world through telepatliic and telsesthetic impressions ; III. The subliminal consciousness, discerning and influenced
by disembodied spirits in a spiritual world.
The distinction between II. and III. is unimportant in the
present connection : the really important dividing hne is between the supraliminal and the subliminal—that is to say,
between I. on the one side and II. and III. taken together on
the other. It is to be noted that the principle on which the
chviding line is here drawn rests upon the possession or nonpossession of supernormal powers. Where, however, the
possession or non-possession of such powers by the supraliminal
is the very point at issue, it is clear that a deflnition of this kind
gives no help towards deciding the question of fact. A disputed
definition is not an argument.
I do not suppose that Myers himself would claim to have
produced proof that the suprahminal, the ‘‘ I as I know myself ”
is incapable of acting or being acted on telepathically. He
seems to take this for granted, as something almost self- evident. ^ Self-evident it certainly is not. I can discover no
^ See, however, H.P., vol. i., p. 97 : “ One characteristic of the subliminal
in my view is that it is in closer relation than the supraliminal to the spiritual
world ”. This would seem to be a tacit admission that the supraliminal may
be to some extent in relation with the spiritual world. Cf. also vol. ii., p. 237,
where, in comparing the case of Mrs Piper with that of Stainton Moses or Hiune he represents one of the points of difference as consisting in the fact that her supraliminal self shows no traces of any supernormal faculty whatever . Tills ought to mean that some trace of supernormal faculty was
discernible in the case of the other two. But this was not his usual attitude. Thus in vol. ii., p. 124, he speaks of “ that region of supernormal knowledge
which for the supraliminal is so definitely closed ”,

)i'iori connection between subliniinality and supranormalfaculty, (iiven the fact of telepathic intercourse between onemind and another, 1 shmdd have thought it simpler and saferto start by assuming that whatever partakes of the nature ofmind is likely to ])artake in some degree, however slight, oftele])athic sensibility. If any difference in this respect is foundin practice between the two selves, it would seem easy toascribe it to the greater freedom from sensory impressions whichthe subliminal may in general be supposed to enjoy in comparison with the supraliminal.^
Direct proof of the capacity of the supraliminal to receivetelepathic impressions is, I admit, not easy, perhaps notpossible, to secure. The successful results which have beenobtained in telepathic experiments with subjects apparently in a normal condition, though not without weight as prima facieevidence, are not conclusive, because the alternative explanation, which attributes them to subliminal receptivity in thefirst instance, cannot be summarily dismissed. The messagesreceived by Mrs Willett in her silent D.I.s and lone scripts, evenif we acce])t them as coming from sources outside herself, fall short of proof for the same reason. Yet it may fairly be contended, and is indeed obvious, thatthis alternative explanation itself affords presinnptive evidencethat the supraliminal is at least not restricted to sensoryimpressions, but can receive mental impressions also, albeit
only through the mediation of the siibliminal.^ Nay, more :
^ Note, liowever, that Myers does not liesitate on occasion to ascribe keener
sensory percejjtion to the subliminal than to the supraliminal. See, for instance, H.F., vol. ii., p. 10.5.-
- Cf. H.P., vol. ii., p. 5.50. " Even as the .subliminal self can present visual
or auditory phantasms for supraliminal observation ; even as the humanagent, acting telepathically, can present—still tlmough subliminal agency
his own ])hantasmal aj)2)earance for the jjercijjient to recognise, so can the
.sjjirit ”. . . . “ The .spirit is here acting concui’rently with the suju'aliminal
intelligence, just as the subliminal intelligence has already done ”. The
last sentence might seem to imjjly that the departed sjjirit, when producing
a jihantasmal aj^jjearauce of itself, acts directly on the supraliminal. If so,
it must be taken as an unguarded statement, which does not represent Myers’s
real view. What I imagine he meant is that, in the case sujjjjosed, two
consciousnesses are concurrently active, that of the spirit and that of the
supraliminal self which continues to be aware of its normal environment.
His theory requhes, in order to account for the ijhenomenon, the addition
140] Psijchological Aspects of Airs Willett's Mediumship 279
have we any good ground for placing the process of coinnninication between the subliminal and the supraliminal on a
different footing, qua process, from that which in admitted cases of supernormal communication between individuals we describe as telepathic ? Both jirocesses are mental ; can we make
any valid distinction between them so far as the modus operandi
is concerned 1 Whatever answer be given to this question, it is common
ground to both sides of the controversy that “ messages ” can
pass from one mental element of the personality—whatever
interpretation we give to the term “ element ”—to another.
Further, it is common ground that it is often exceedingly
difficult, in fact impossible, to distinguish between messages
passing from a subliminal to a supraliminal mental element and
messages passing supernormally from the mind of one man to
that of another, or from a discarnate to an incarnate mind.^
Where the effects are indistinguishable there is a presumption, though of course no certainty, that the causes also are
similar in other words, that if the process is telepathic in one
case, it is also telepathic in the other.
This, as the reader knows, is the view that commends itself
of a third consciousness, namely tliat of the subliminal self, which receives
the message from the spirit telepathically, and passes it on to the supraliminal by some process which is assumed to be ?iot telepathic, although
its nature is otherwise very obscurely indicated.
1 Cf. H.P., vol. 11 ., p. 88, where, with references to the automatisms which
he classes together as “ message-bearing or nunciative automatisms ”, Myers
remarks, “ I do not, of course, mean that they all of them bring messages
from sources external to the automatist’s o^vn mind. In some eases they
probably do this ; but as a rule the so-called messages seem more probably
to originate within the automatist’s own personality. Why, then, it may be
asked, do I call them messages ? We do not usually speak of a man as sending
a message to himself. The answer to tliis question involves, as we shah
presently see, the profoundest conception of these automatisms to which we can as yet attain. They present themselves to us as messages communicated from one stratum to another stratum of the same jiersonality ”. Compare also the important statement in H.P., vol. ii., p. 198, which,
although primarily applying to possession, must be held to be no less applicable
to the case of “ nunciative ” automatisms. It must be borne in mind that,
in Myers’s view, an organism can be “ possessed ” by its own subliminah
and that he regards possession by an external spirit to be telepathy carried
to the pomt where it ceases to be telepathy and becomes direct control of the organism. See pp. 174-5 above.
280 Psychological Aspects of Airs Willett's Alediumship [partto me. Once, at least, in Human Personality Myers himselfseems to come near it. In vol. ii., pp. 5-6, he writes :
Wherever there is hallucination, whether delusive or veridical,
I hold that a message of some sort is forcing its way upwardsfrom one stratum of personality to another,—a message whichmay be merely dreamlike and incoherent, or which may symbohse a fact otherwise unreachalile by the percipient personality.
And the mechanism seems much the same whether the message’s
path be continued withhi one individual or pass between two ; whether A’s owm submerged self be signalling to his emergentself, or B be telepathically stimulating the hidden fountains of
perception in A.
When quoting this passage in my presidential address in
1906 I expressed some surprise that the hint contained in it oftelepathic action between the two selves within one individualwas not further followed up by Myers. Closer study of thewhole subject has, however, convinced me that, without thesurrender of some of liis most cherished doctrines, it would havebeen impossible for him to accept telepathy as a true accountof the process by which messages are conveyed from one mentalelement within the personality to another.
In order to avoid the use of clumsy periphrases let us describe
communication which passes from one mental element withinthe personality to another by the term interior, and communication which passes supernormally from one individual to
another by the term exterior. “ Exterior ” communication bycommon consent we describe as telepathic. Is “ interior ” communication also telepathic, and if not, what is the natureof the process by which it takes place ? Interior telepathy, if accepted as a fact, would, of comse, be
in flat contradiction to the doctrine that telepatliic faculty is confined to the subliminal. But its implications do not endthere. Telepathy is so clearly identified in Human Personality
with the process of communication between distinct psychicalentities that to accept the idea of interior telepathy would bein effect equivalent to recognising the mental elements associated together in the individual man as being such distinct
psychical entities. We are thus once more brought up before
the old question concerning the selfhood of the independent
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Merliutnship 2Sl
ciirrents of consciousness that are somehow combined in one and the same individual human being. Are these independent
currents true selves, or are they phases, fragments, layers, strata,
of one and the same unitary self ? Interior telepathy interpreted as a process of communication
between distinct psychical entities or true selves is incompatible
with Myers’s doctrine of the soul as the all-embracing unity of
the mental elements of the personality. It is incompatible with
the conception of the mental elements themselves as merely
different manifestations or aspects of the soul’s activity. It is equally incompatible, I think, with the doctrine that identifies
man’s true self with his subliminal self. The idea of interior
telepathy must surely have occurred to Myers. I have little doubt that his rejection of it was deliberate, and that he himself
must have felt it to be inconsistent vdth other parts of his
teaching.
Myers recognises interior communication as a mental process,
but treats it as a mental process of a different kind from telepathy. This is clearly brought out in a footnote to a passage
immediately following the one just quoted :
Some word is much needed to express communication
between one state and another, e.g. between the somnambulic
and the waking .state, or, in hypnotism, the cataleptic and the
somnambulic, etc. The word “ methectic ” (//ede/cr(/fo?) seems
to me the mo.st suitable, especially since nede^i<; happens to
be the word u.sed by Plato {Farm., 132 b) for participation
between ideas and concrete objects. Or the word “ inter-state ”
might be pressed into this new duty.
In this footnote Myers proposes the term methexis for what
I have called above interior communication. Interior communication is, in his view, always methectic, never telepathic. If
I am asked whether, in my view, interior communication is always telepathic, my answer must be, Yes, if the selves between,
ivhom communication takes place are true selves. But at this
point the controversy once more resolves itself into the original
difference of opinion concerning the nature of the mental
elements between which the interaction takes place. Those
who hold the mental elements to be true selves will inevitably
take the further step and treat communication between them as
282 PsychoJogiral Asjoecfs of Mrs Willett's Medmmship [parttelepathic. Those who hold them to be phases, strata, or
“ states ” of a single unitary self will naturally and rightly seek
for some other term to describe the passage of thought fromone to the other. But if thus stripped of the attributes of true
selfhood, can the mental elements continue to furnish the key to
the obscure phenomena of abnormal psychology which Myersbelieved himself to possess in his conception of supraliminal andsidjliminal selves ? My own reply to this qiiestion can only bein the negative.
There is one further observation which I should like to add.
Accepting the reality both of interior and of exterior communication, I have noted the practical difficulty—fully admitted byMyers himself—of deciding to which of the two classes a givencase should properly be assigned. Assume now, for the sake ofargument, what I believe is still the doctrine of “ orthodox ”
psychology, that there is no such thing as exterior communication ; that is to say that there is no telepathic communication either between living individuals or between incarnate anddiscarnate spirits, and that the jihenomena which have led to
the hv])othesis of such communication are in fact to be explaineil as cases of interior communication. With this assumption we shall have altogether banished telepathy in the sense in
which Myers uses the term. But the problem of the apparentlyindependent origin of the “ messages ” has thereby become notless blit more insistent than before. For the readiest explanation of some, at all events, of these messages is to attribute
them to the activity of external agents incarnate or discarnate.
If this explanation is summarily excluded—if all “ nunciativeautomatisms ” are, in Myers’s phrase, messages “ sent by a man to himself ”—the hypothesis that would ascribe them to
interaction between different phases or states of a imitary soul
would surely be strained to the breaking point. From this
])oint of view I think the idea of a plurality of selves or centres
of conscio\isness associated together in the same body, cajDable
of interacting with each other in such a way as to constitute the
reahty and not merely the appearance of indej^endent agency,
is one which should lie seriously considered even by orthodoxpsychology. It is right, however, to point out that, with this
new conception, telepathy, or something barely to be distinguished from it, would be reinstated in the form of interior
140] Psychological Asjiecfs of 3Irs Willeti' s Medmmsliip 283
communication although rejected in the form of exterior
communication
.
Although there is a good deal in my presidential address of
1906 which I should wish to modify, or at least to express in
other words, if I were writing to-day, I nevertheless venture to
quote one passage from it that gives an outline sketch of the
structure of human personality as I conceive it, which, in spite
of gaps left unfilled and problems left unsolved, I stiU prefer
to the picture drawn by Myers ; On the view which I have tentatively outhned it is possible,
I think, to frame a more definite conception of the different
factors that unite to form the individual human being, and of
the relations between them, than I, at all events, have been
able to derive from Myers’s account of the supraliminal and
subliminal selves.
Every psychical centre associated with the organism would,
in accordance with this view, have to be regarded as “ subliminal ” ^ to every other, though indeed it might be better to
drop that term altogether in describing the relation as I conceive
it. The self of which we are each of us conscious is neither the
organism as a whole nor any grouping of psychical centres
within the organism. It is a single mind or soul whose conscious
states at any given moment are the expression of its reaction
against its entire environment. What is its environment ? In the larger sense (and this must not be forgotten in considering the question of siirvival after the dissolution of the
organism), its environment is nothing less than the whole umverse other than itself. In the narrower sense its environment is the physical orgamsm and every psychical centre
associated therewith. The presupposition of a plurality of real
existences, coupled with the observed facts as to the concurrent
activity of different streams of consciousness withm a single
organism, has thus inevitably brought us in sight of the idea
first put forward by Leibnitz, that the living creature is a kind
of hierarchy of monads arranged in orderly and systematic
relations with each other, each reflecting in its own way the
' I.e. in the sense in which Myers uses the word when he tells us that by
the subliminal self he means “ that part of the self which is commonly
subliminal See the passage from H.P., quoted on p. 266 above.
284 Psycholofiical As'pecfs of Mrs Willett' s Meclinmship [partstates of consciousness of all the rest. Only whereas Leibnitzdenied all real interaction between the monads and sought to
accoimt for the apparent interaction by his famous doctrine of
pre-established harmony, we have assumed throughout thatthe interaction is real, and conjectured that in part at least it might be of essentially the same character as that which, as between distinct living organisms, we call telepathic.
Any further observations I have to make concerning theinteraction of the mental elements which contribute to thepersonahty of the individual man may with advantage bedeferred until the reader has been placed in a position to compare the statements in Willett scripts relating to the subjectsdealt with in the present chapter with the summary I haveattempted to give of Myers’s teaching on the same subject in
Human Personality.
A good many of the extracts which follow have ah’eady beenquoted in various preceding chapters. Here, as elsewhere, for reasons already explained on p. 211 above, I have not hesitatedto repeat quotations where it seemed to me that the convenienceof the reader would best be consulted by doing so. The extractsin the present case have been arranged with due regard tochronological order, but not too rigidly to permit of departurefrom that order for the sake of bringing related passages intojuxtaposition, or for other good cause.
I will begin with two passages which conform closely toMyers’s doctrine of the soul, representing it as a spiritual entitythat existed before its association with the body, and will
survive bochly destruction, but which, even during its embodiedlife, can be in touch with its original native element, namely themetetherial world as ojDjiosed to the world of matter.

following extracts show :

The reason why you get messages at times upon subjects that
you have been pondering on is that you have so pondered by

In these passages the difficiilty of distinguishing betweenmessages which have their source in the subhininal and messages which proceed from minds external to the percipient’s is
frankly recognised ; but it is not made clear whether messagesfrom independent minds can reach the supraliminal direct, orwhether the intervention of the subliminal is to be regarded asan inchspensable condition of their passing into normal consciousness. The latter, as we have seen, is the doctrine ofHuman Personality ; and I think it must also be accepted asthe doctrine of the Willett scripts.
In Mrs Willett’s case the two stages in the process by whichmessages from an independent mind are received and externahsed are represented as being either gradual and extendingover a period of time, or practically simultaneous and issuingin an immediate effect.

vital influence at work on tlie percipient’s subliminal self ”. The two accounts,
however, are not identical ; for liere tlie tardiness is ascribed to the nature
of the impact on tlie subliminal, whereas according to the statement in the

1 Tlie Willetl comimmicator.s repeatedly claim tliat they can throw the
sensitive into lighter or deeper trance at their pleasure. If the jrrocess consists
in “ submerging the supraliminal ”, how is this effected ? If by direct tele- patliie action, telejiathie sensitivity on the jrart of tlie supraliminal wouldseem to be conceded, though elsewhere denied. Are we to understand that
here also the communicatoi' only acts on the supraliminal indirectly, i.e. mediately througli the agency of the subliminal ?
140] Psyclioloyical Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediurnship 289
1911, that the sensitive “ remains the totality of herself I impress her by thoughts It is she who uses the nerve ”, should
be carefully noted. Hitherto the structure of the self as at once
unitary and composite had been quietly assumed, and no suggestion had been made that this conception presents any kind
of difficulty or problem. The emphatic assurance now given
that throughout the process the sensitive remains the totahty
of herself, and that “ herself ” includes both subliminal and
supraliminal, gives perhaps for the first time in the scripts, a
hint of the possibility that this assumption is open to question.
Up to this point the statements made by the communicators
call for little general comment. They suggest no substantial
deviations from the teachings contained in Human Personality.
In the important series of trance -scripts and D.I.s starting from
the sitting of June 4, 1911, and mainly devoted to the subject
of process, the question of the structure of the personality is brought more explicitly to the front and several new ideas are introduced which seem to be something more than mere amphfications of Myers’s teaching, and even, at least in the use of
certain technical terms, to be inconsistent with it. In the two preceding chapters I have dealt with the topic of
telepathy, interpreted as the active communication of thought ; with teleesthesia, interpreted as mind-reacUng ; with “ mutual
selection ”, presupposing a kind of reciprocal teleesthesia ; with
subhminal “ weaving ”, involving, at least in certain cases, the
dividing up of the subliminal into a plurality of “ selves ”
interacting with each other and with the supraliminal. All
these topics have some connection, and the last of them a very
direct connection, with the subject-matter of the present
chapter. I shall, however, take it for granted that the reader
is acquainted with the general contents of Chapters II. and III.
and for my present purpose will concentrate upon the three
trance-sittings of October 8, 1911, January 21, 1912, and
March 5, 1912—the only sittings at which the more controversial points at issue are brought into conspicuous prominence.
At all these sittings I was present as investigator in charge.
The relevant passages in them are here quoted practically in
extenso. This will entail the inclusion of several more or less
lengthy extracts, with which the reader has already been made
acquainted ; but I think he will agree with me that in the
290 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [paetpresent instance, at all events, the advantages of repetitionoutweigh the drawbacks.

She has access to. It is difficult to get it clear. Let me go slowly and feel if need be for my meaning in a round-about way.

(G. IF. B. One more question. Myers in his book on Human
Personality speaks of the siiprahminal and the subliminal
sometimes in language which seems to characterise them as separate though closely associated selves, but more generally
as if they were merely different strata of one and the same
individual consciousness. How are these two views to be
reconciled ?) I want several of these questions read to me again, but let me get her into D.I. secondary stage first.

(G. W. B. ivas about to speak but E. G. went on.)
Don’t interrupt me—but the supraliminal consciousness ofthat interaction varies. He says, in that direction evolutionaryprinciples should be recognised.
Oh he says, putting it at its lowest, the suprahminal willfind that it pays to attend to subhminal impulse and intuition—and he says, the supraliminal as it now is is largely the resultof attention to what pays. Oh he says, value for life as it hasbeen in the past, and he says, you might call the suprahminala group of paying activities—not the word I want, but it will do.And he says, the subliminal is rivetted ^ on to the transcendental self—the ulterior pre-existing pre-subliminal, in something of the same sense as the subhminal is pre-supraliminal.He says. Pass now to the discarnate. The persisting elementscontain, in largest proportions, elements of the subconsciousself. This is obscure. Oh he says, the persistible self contains—the largest element is subhminal.
He says, the largest proportion of the persisting whole is that summed up in the words subliminal-self element, togetherwith an admixture—and a very vital admixture—of thesuprahminal.
Oh he says, the suprahminal and the subhminal are partsof one whole. They may act apparently so discomiectedlyas to lead one from the incarnate standpoint to think of them asseparate. Oh he says, think of the subhminal as a principlenormally operating in the metetherial, and in—oh, Edmund,it’s so difficult—oh hold tight of me, I’m shpping—Oh he says,read me from where I said

[G. W. B. reads from “ think of the subhminal ” down to “ metetherial ”.)
And in the best conditions—in the achieved—when that is achieved which is aimed at, the subhminal informs and guidesthe suprahminal as the transcendental self forms and guides thesubhminal. Oh he says, that is the incarnate—Oh he says,I’ve got a muddle here somewhere. What I’ve been speakingof refers to the incarnate ; and with regal'd to the discarnate* The tei'in “ rivetteil ” here is meant, 1 think, to carry on tlie metaphorof links of a chain.

All.
{O. W. B. The first question is : In mutvial selection you
say that the sensitive can select from such part of your mind
as she can have access to. What part is this ?) He says, I want to suggest something which, while not
contradicting your question, will open another window. Oh
if I could oifiy not drop like that. Oh hold me tight. And he
says, she can select—he says a word to me—telaesthesia—oh
he says, you none of you make enough allowance for what that
implies, and the results of that can be shepherded and guided
up to the threshold of normal consciousness.
Oh he says, telsesthesia is a bed-rock truth, a power of
acquiring knowledge direct without the intervention of discarnate mind.
Oh he says, telepathy’s one thing—that’s thought communication ; telaesthesia is knowledge, not thought, acquii-ed by
the subliminal when operatmg normally in the metetherial.^

{Question is repeated.)
It’s One : and an enhghtening pomt of view—I think it is

is to conceive of it as allied and distinguishable—I missed a word—and then grouped round one nucleus. He says. Your
interpretation of centres of consciousness may not be mine

and he says. How far have I got through information in answer ? {G. W. B. Perhaps it might help to put it in this way. You
spoke of a continuous interaction between the sublimmal and
the suprahminal. Are the centres of consciousness of the subliminal related to each other in a manner analogous to the
relation of the siibliminal to the supraliminal ?) Wait. Something about centres of cognition. He says.
Tentacles of the star-fish. Interaction, he says, is right. The
supraliminal and the subliminal ebb and flow ; and he says
^ In tlie important passage already quoted on p. 265 above Myers defines
liis use of the term “ subliminal ” as covering “ all that takes place beneath
the ordinary threshold of consciousness ”. When the communicator identifies the miconscious mind of the sensitive witli her subliminal, it is presumably
in this sense that he uses the word. But the adjective “ imconseious ” in this connection is apt to be misleading. It is not the subliminal which is unconscious, but the supraliminal in regard to tlie subliminal. The subliminal
is conceived as comprising all mental process which does not reach the level
of consciousness in the supraliyninal. Neither the Myers of Human Personality nor the communicators in the Willett scripts mean to represent the subliminal
self as unconscious on its own account. On the contrary it is common ground
for both that in the subliminal the highest manifestation of mind is to be
found.
The interpretation of the passage which follows, down to “ tentacles of the star-fish ”, is far from clear. By “ centres of consciousness ” I had meant
“selves ” ; but Gurney’s answer seems to refer to the relation between mind
and body, and even to identify “ centres of consciousness ” with the organs
of sense. Are the centres of consciousness which are described as “ grouped
round one nucleus ”, from which they are distmguishable, the same as the
“ centres of cognition ” wliich are compared to the tentacles of a star-fish,
and also the same as the centres of sub-conscious7iess which are said, a little lower dowm, to inform a central whole ? I think there has been misunderstanding between Gurney and myself,
and that more confusion has resulted than I can successfully attempt to um’avel.

And he says, Sidgwick is alwayspointing out the liability to misinterpretation which the useof analogies and terms proper to one department of knowledgebeing imported into unmapped, ill-mapped, regions—But, hesays, when the thing works properly, all the links—the links are continuous, he says. And he says the point where thetranscendental merges into the subliminal

merges may bringa number of associations for you which may not be in the least

“ I do not pretend to undenstand the statements liero made.
^ Tlie comparison witli number is perhaps not altogether felicitous. In number the element of discreteness is usxially conceived to be the prominentone. On the other hand in abstract number the element of continuity is also present in so far as the units com250sing any given number, as number,make one whole without any gap between them.

{G. W. B. You speak of a continuous interaction between
the transcendental and the subliminal and the supraliminal.
Does not interaction imply duality or multiplicity ? In a
sense, individual human beings are parts of one whole—that
is, they are all rooted, as it were, in the Absolute. Are suprahminal and subliminal separate in a manner analogous to the
separateness of different human beings ?) BOSH! [very loud and emphatic) different aspects of the same thing.
[G. W. B. But some think that individuals are different
aspects of the Absolute.)
He says to me. Come on. He says. One. and he says. Really
there’s some sense in these words, for purposes of convenience

individuals—and he says. You would put the thresholds of
different individuals in different places. The cubes make one
pattern.
[G. W. B. I’m not putting forward a doctrine, but only
asking a question. How the same thing can be both one and
many has always given rise to difficulties. What I wished to
know was whether supraliminal and subliminal are distinct
in a manner analogous to the distinctness of different human
beings.)
Not in that sense. He says that’s extremely important.
I’ve got your thought, G. My answer is. No, not in that sense.
It’s very difficult, but he says, what is the relation between the
human being and the Absolute ? He says. Answer me that.
{G. W. B. That is the most difficidt question in philosophy.)
He says. It’s the Absolute on its way to self-consciousness.
Oh, he says, if I could get the right words, while there’s no
analogy as I’ve made clear,^ there is an analogy between the
supraliminal and the subliminal, and the individual rooted in
the Absolute and the Absolute. And he says. You’ve got it now, and he says. No bones broken—and he says to me. You

{G. W. B. Oh, I see. You want me to ask another question
You referred at a former sitting to telaesthesia as a process
by which the mind of the sensitive acquired knowledge on its own account. The subject came up in connection with whatyou called mutual selection. You spoke of taking the sensitive
into “ a room ” and screening off any action of your own mindon hers ; whereupon her subliminal proceeds to take stock of
the contents of the room. Do you mean a real room, or onlya room existing in your mind ?)
I’ll throw something at you, and you must make what youcan of it.^
I’ll take that portion of her which can emerge in uprush,and I, as it were, link it on with that deeper subliminal whichcan be in touch with what I want to get known ; so that there ;is that portion of her which can normally acquire telaestheticaUy in its own deep profound plane passing on the knowledge to (that plane from which an uprush can come. Oh he says, ,what I’m going to say to you now makes Sidgwick tear his
jhair, because it’s meaning the ocean in a child’s bucket. I’m going to call that deepest portion, nearer to the trans- •cendental self—I’m going to call it—anything you like, anysymbol, say H. Well, the H-self and I agree on what we want—what I want—to get transmitted, and which the H-self normally, in its own H-ness, through its own cognitive faculites, can know. And here is the “ bucket ” process, it’s here wherejust because it’s the most difficult I shall fail worst in tryingto get near the thought. The H-self will touch the uprushable1 See p. 245 above.

self just the grade below the uprxishable, and the uprushable
and the grade below will receive the knowledge from the H.
But in getting it into the uprushable focus as it were, it will
know that a sort of crystalhsation, often through symbolism
must be arrived at : and we will imagine, if you like, that that
having been foreseen both by me and the H-self, we determined
upon what sort of crystals to aim at, so that the uprushable
self has as it were presented to it what I called a “ room ”, the
knowledge which the H-self is informing to the point where
it becomes uprushable. Just below that uprushable point
there’s a sort of dim moment where both modes enter into
cognition—I mean, where a knowledge of the thing as it is in
the H-stage is united to a knowledge of the crystals which,
the emblem which, can best express that which in its H-ness
cannot, or rarely, uprush—for all these states are variable and
the success variable. Then comes that moment of bin din g
when the self that lies in juxtaposition to the uprushable
absorbs the knowledge from H, and passes it on to the uprushable point in such a state as makes uprush possible. It then
rushes out as word spoken or written, or dreams, or never-tobe-denied moments of prescience, pre-cognition of supernormal
knowledge. But that supernormal will contain within it the
normally acquired knowledge of H—that element of normality
will be there. Oh, he says, that isn’t the invariable method,
only one of them ; and he says. The telepathic impact is another. He says the normal powers—Oh he says, I must
let her go.
Extract from the D.I. of March 5, 1912. ^ {Present, G. W. B.)
Telepathy, inspiration, mutual selection—he says they mark
different stages of the soul’s commerce, it sounds like. He
says it’s very difficult to get it, dear, but it’s best for me to get
some rough definition down . . . He says. In telepathy there is the mind that makes the
emission of the idea, and the mind that receives the impact
of it ; and it’s often very definite, he says. And he says it’s not
the whole truth to say that inspiration is more general, but
it’s the half truth to say that inspiration is the stimulation of
something already contained in the subliminal which, under

pressure of inspiration forces its way to the threshiod. Oh he
says, Inspiration may be from within as well as from without.
But he says you can’t speak of telepathy between the supraliminal and the subliminal

{G. IF. B. Ah ! I was going to ask that very question.)
but you can speak of inspiration by the subliminal ; you
can also speak of inspiration by the subliminal of matter— . . . The matter which is inspired up to the threshold may be matter
acquired by selection.
He says, Inspiration may be from within, but it may be from
without. Oh he says. Every moment I gave to the study of
hypnotic states and post-hypnotic states I feel was among the
best spent of all my time.
{G. IF. B. Yes, Gurney, those were splemlid papers of yours.)
Oh he says. It’s not only what I learnt then, but what I’ve
been able to apply here. For instance : Say, using the words
in their rough way, that a mutual selection is made—mutually
from her mind and mine. It’s possible for me to suggest to
her sidjliminal that at a given time such and such an idea shall as it were be recovered—one might almost say, recovered out
of the sediment—and come to the top. Or I may use another
process. I may hit a particular atom in the sediment that I
want by telepathic impact or stimulation, and make it cometo the surface that way. But that particular process of tele- pathy I should designate as “ inspirational ” telepathy, because
it’s affecting that which is already within the mind.
Oh, he says, I think I have done enough for to-day.
Though in parts obscure and occasionally (I suspect) confused, the scripts just quoted—to whatever source w^e attribute
them—must surely count among the most remarkable automatic utterances on abstract questions that we possess. On this
aspect of the sidjject I r efer back to what I have already said in
Chapter V. of Part 1. (see p. 155 above). If the scripts in
question are the product, not of inspiration from an external
inteUigence, but of subliminal mentation, I am driven to the
conclusion that the subliminal in this instance has exhibited a
subtlety of speculative thought very decidedly beyond anything I believe the Mr-s Willett with whom I am intimately
acquainted to be capable of. Mrs Willett herself, to whoirr the
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumsliip 301
trance-productions have now been shown for the first time,
assures me that they are “ so much Greek to her, and leave
her utterly bewildered and bored.
It is not, however, with the source of these scripts that I am
here concerned, but with their content. The statements made
in them, so far as they relate to the sid^ject matter of the
present chapter, can be usefully disentangled so as to fall under
two headings :
( 1 ) Statements regarchng the supraliminal and the subliminal
in the incarnate ;
(2) Statements regarding the transcendental self, and the
relation of the soul to the Absolute.
The matters treated of under the second heachng may be
conveniently taken first. They are really of an order so purely
speciilative as hardly to come within the scope of the present
paper. Nevertheless, a brief reference to them is desirable here,
partly because comparison with corresponcUng ideas in Human
Personality has an interest for us ; partly because the account
given of the soul in its relation to the Absolute throws some
light on the cpiestion which more propeily concerns us, namely
the conception to be found in the scripts of the relation of
supraliminal and subliminal in the incarnate personality.
The term “ transcendental ” is repeatedly used in the fragments pieced together by the editors of Human Personality ^ to
form the concluding portion of Chapter IX. of that work, and,
so far as my observation goes, nowhere else in the body of the
book. The use of the term in Willett automatic productions is practically confined to the scripts of October 8, 1911, and
January 21, 1912, and even there it occurs only in the combination, “ The transcendental self This phrase is common both
to the scripts in question and to the concluding portion of
Chapter IX., and provides a link between them which is perhaps
not without significance.
If Mrs Willett had read the concluding portion of Chapter
IX., it would be reasonable to infer that her scripts of October 1,
1911, and January 21, 1912, owe something of their content to
that eircumstance. But her acquaintanee with Human Per-

vol. ii., chapter ix., here referred to, begins on p. 259.
302 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [part
sonality is entirely derived from the abridged version edited byMr Leopold Myers. She assures me that to the best of her
knowledge she has never so much as held a copy of the larger
work in her hand. Now in the abridged version the concludingportion of Chapter IX. is so severely cut down that the seven- teen or eighteen pages which it occupies in the original are reduced to less than three, and in those three pages the word“ transcendental ” does not once appear. It does, however,once occur in the Syriopsis of a Scheme of Vital Faculty,
which forms Appendix A to Chapter IX., and which is includedin the abridged version. Even there there is no mention of the“transcendental self”, only of the “transcendental world”.On the other hand, it is just in the concluding sections of Chapter IX. that Myers gives the freest rein to his speculation, andthey must certainly be held to express his most fully developedideas on the subject with which they deal. If the Willett
scripts are messages from an external somce, and that sourceMyers himself (or Gurney speaking for the pair there wouldbe nothing surprising in his employment, when communicating,of a term which he had already begun to use in his latest
writings.
In Human Personality “ the transcendental self ” is contrastedwith “the empirical self” ; and this conjunction recalls thedistinction between the transcendental ego and the empiricalego, with which we are famihar in Kantian phraseology. Thesimilarity, however, is only verbal. For Kant the transcendental ego has a significance purely epistemological. It is theidentical self as the necessary conchtion of experience, whereasthe empirical self is the self with its serial content or successionof mental states.
In Human Personality, on the other hand, the adjective“ transcendental ” is synonymous with “ spiritual ” or “ metetherial ”, as in the phrase, “ transcendental world ”, “ transcendental mode of perception ”, “ transcendental faculty ”,
^ Cf. lone script of January 5, 1911, “ This is all one message from 2 men.Sometimes the signature is F that means that I am here But rarely without
him ” {i.e. Gurney.) Whether the actual communicator is Gurney or Myersseems to depend mainly on the sitter. With O. J. L. as sitter, it is usually
Myers ; with me as sitter, it is almost invariably Gurney. This is dramatically
appropriate, since I knew Gurney much better than I did Myers.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship 303
“ transcendental environment ” ; and the transcendental self as opposed to the empirical self is simply the subliminal as opposed to the supraliminal.
We have already seen, in the ehapter dealing with telepathy
and telaesthesia, an example of the way in which the Willett
scripts, while adopting the language of Human Personality,
have introduced considerable changes in the meaning of the
technical terms employed. One’s first impression is that something of the same kind has happened in the case of the transcendental self ; and in a measure this is true.
The transcendental self of the scripts is not the same as the
transcendental self of Human Personality. The latter, as I have
said, is the subliminal as opposed to the suprahminal in the
incarnate. The former “ is the ulterior pre-existing pre-subhminal in something of the same sense as the subhminal is presupraliminal ”. As such it may fairly be described as the
subhminal in the discarnate, and “ the subliminal of the subhminal ” in the incarnate.
It is clear that what we are offered in the scripts is an analysis
of the soul into grades or degrees of spirituahty.
In the incarnate these grades are
(1) the suprahminal ;
(2) the subhminal ;
(3) the transcendental self.
In the discarnate all three grades are stiU present, but some
elements characteristic of the suprahminal consciousness in the
incarnate have, if my interpretation is correct, disappeared,
while the remainder have become “ blended ” with what was
the incarnate subhminal to form what we may, if we please,
regard as a discarnate suprahminal. The transcendental self
will then, by analogy, represent the discarnate subhminal.
This account of the transcendental self cannot be whohy
reconciled with the use of the term in Human Personality, but
the discrepancy does not appear to me to be fundamental. It
* A “ vital percentage ” of supraliminal elements (see D.I. of October 8th,
1911) is presumably held to be retained by the discarnate spirit in order to accoimt for the memories which it continues to possess of its earthly life, and
also, perhaps, for some power of perceiving material tilings. But there is no
distinct statement to this effect in the scripts.
304 Psychologiml Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship [pahtmust be remem})erecl that Myers himself treats the subliminalas consisting of strata, or layers, of chfferent depths, and in this
he is followed by the scripts. “ Ranges of different depths ” is the description of it in the D.I., January 21, 1912, and in thesame D.I. Ginney refers to “ the profundities of the subliminalwhich grade right up and merge into what I’ve spoken of as thetranscendental self”. It might be plausibly contended thatthe transcendental self of the scripts is merely a special namefor the deepest of a number of strata in the subliminal, and thatthe transcendental self of Human Personality includes thisstratum as j^art of itself. I think, however, that the differencebetween the two goes somewhat beyond this. In distinguishingthe transcendental self from the subliminal the scripts certainlymean to imply a difference of degree that has passed into adifference of kind, analogous to the difference between subliminal and supraliminal.^ In what does the chfference of kindconsist ? No clear answer is provided in the scripts. Butmaterial for an answer is, I think, to be found in the Synopsisprefixed to the “ Scheme of Vital Faculty ” (H.P., vol. ii.,
p. 505), to which I have already had occasion to refer earlier inthe present chapter (see p. 277 above). We are there presentedwith a threefold division of consciousness into (1) the supraliminal or empirical consciousness aware only of the materialworld through sensory impressions ; (2) the subliminal consciousness obscurely aware of the transcendental world throughtelepathic and teleesthetic impressions ; and (3) the subliminalconsciousness discerning and influenced by disembodied spiritsin a spiritual world. When I had this triple division previouslyunder consideration I passed over the distinction (2) and (3) asiinimportant in connection with the subject under discussion atthe moment. What I have now to suggest is that the “ s\ibliminal consciousness discerning and influenced by disembodiedspirits in a spiritual world ” at once corresponds to and explainsthe transcendental self of the scripts. It is the name that is new rather than the distinction. But this new name, or, to bemore accurate, this specialised application of a name alreadyused by Myers in a looser and more general sense, is quite in1 Note that in the D.I. of January 21, 1912, the “ H-self ” is representedas that portion of the subliminal which is nearest to the transcendental self, but is at the same time distinguished from it. See p. 298 above.
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's MecUumship 305
consonance with his teaching, and might well have been
accepted by him as an improvement in terminology.
The synopsis of the “ Scheme of Vital Faculty ”, though not
the scheme itself in detail, is included, as we have seen, in Mr
Leopold Myers’s abridged version of Human Personality, and
Mrs Willett must be presumed to have read it.
The account given in the D.I. of January 21, 1912, of the
relation between the soul and “the Absolute ” raises questions
which one could not even begin to discuss without jilunging into
metaphysics. Noteworthy among these is the remarkable
doctrine which attributes the origin of the individual soul to the
process of the Absolute “ on its way to self-consciousness
So far as I can recollect nothing quite like this is to be found in
Human Personality? It seems to me to bear the mark of derivation from post-Kantian ideahstic speculation, of which,
curiously enough, a good many traces crop up in the scripts.

Here, again, if the scripts are the work of the automatist’s
subliminal self, from what source were the ideas expressed in
them obtained ? The normal IVIrs ^Villett is unable to throw
any light upon this question.
Of greater interest, because it has some bearing on the main
subject of the present chapter, is the ascending scale which is represented as extending beyond the transcendental self and
reaching towards the Absolute. No attempt is made to define
the further stages in the scale. The communicator himself
adrmts that even to the emancipated spirit the region that lies beyond the transcendental self is a region of conjecture. “ There
are seas to be explored ”, says Gurney, “ and I can only sail a
little way out and come back with a report that the sea stretches
infinitely vast beyond them ”. What he has in mind seems to be
a progress by stages through w'hich the individual ego passes in
Earlier in the same D.I. statements are made which seem to imply that
the transcendental self, like the Absolute, achieves self-consciousness by hemming off , i.e. by self-limitation. But the script is so obscure at this point that I feel very rmcertain of the true interpretation.
^ See, however, the last sentence in chapter ix. of Human Personality,
quoted in the footnote (2) on p. 183.
See, for instance, the reference to Hegel’s Phdnomenologie des Geistes in the D.I. of May 24, 1911 (p. 183 above).
306 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [part
its upward course, the relation between the stages being conceived as analogous to the relation between the suprahminal
and subliminal “ selves
We have now to revert to the first of our two headings, and
examine the account given in the scripts of the nature of this
relation in the incarnate human being.
Let us begin by noting the important admission that while
“ the supraliminal and the subliminal are parts of one whole,
they may act apparently so disconnectedly as to lead one from
the incarnate standpoint to think of them as separate
How is this possible ? I do not think it would be unfair to Myers to say that he
accepted the paradox as a true description of the nature of the
soul. The soul is at once a unitary self, or ego, and a self
distinguishable into parts sufficiently independent of each other
to deserve on their own account to be described as “ selves
In essentials this is also the doctrine of the scripts. At the
same time I think I see signs that the communicators realised
more fully than the Myers of Human Personality appears to
have done the difficulties inherent in his solution of the problem.
On two points there is a noticeable change of attitude. On the
one hand there is a tendency to emphasise the unity by blmring
the lines of division between the ‘
‘ selves ” so as to resolve them
into a continuous whole. On the other hand, there seems to be
a disposition to soften the paradox of the independence of the
parts by setting aside as irrelevant certain observed phenomena
which are on the face of them hard to reconcile with the
doctrine.
The question I put to Gurney in the sitting of October 8, 1911,
was this : “ Myers in his book speaks of the suprahminal and
the subliminal sometimes as if they were separate though
closely associated selves, but more commonly as if they were
different strata of one and the same individual consciousness.
How are these two views to be reconciled ? ”
In reply Gurney says that in the individual consciousness
there are many gradations, and he compares it to an ascending
chain, i.e. a chain of which the successive links represent ascending degrees of spirituality. He proceeds to tell us something of
the nature of the relation of the links with special reference to
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs WilleWs Mediumship 307
the case of the supraliminal and the subliminal. “ Normal
suprahminal consciousness ”, we are informed, “ varies in
depth, and is, as it were, the upper crust of the subliminal. . . . The interaction between the two is continuous ^ . . . but the
supraliminal consciousness of that interaction varies ”. We
have here two statements, each of them interesting, though
I am doubtful how far they are consistent. The natural
meaning of the first would seem to be that the suprahminal
varies in content, and at times includes a content which is usually confined to the subliminal. This would imply an
enlarged range of supraliminal activity, and supraliminal and
subhminal, regarded as parts of our whole, would appear to be
either overlapping each other or advancing and receding
respectively as the case may be. On the other hand, the
second of the two statements rather suggests that the additional
content is derived from the subliminal by a process of interaction—we are not allowed to call it telepathic interaction—and
that the “ variation in depth ” attributed to the supraliminal
may be merely a variation in its threshold of consciousness.
Another possible intei’pretation would be that a kind of
blending of the parts may take place so as to produce a
“ blended consciousness ” similar to that which the communicator describes as forming the supraliminal of the discarnate.
Whatever interpretation we adopt it is evident the “ chain of
finks ” is a very inadequate symbol to express the kind of unity
in difference of which we are in search.
In the D.I. of January 21, 1912, the subject is resumed.
Following upon a difficult passage which I take to be concerned
with another subject altogether, namely the relation between
mind and body, the statements made in the earlier sitting are
in effect repeated.
Interaction, he says, is right. The supraliminal and the
subliminal ebb and flow. . . . But if you’re going to confuse
any of this with the whole question of secondary and tertiary
personalities and their respective memories of each other, you’ll
be making a mistake. Those are cases of dislocation, imperfect
and often pathological. Oh ! he says, it’s the creaking of the
machine that . . . But, he says, when the thing works properly
* “ Continuous ” here = unceasing, perpetual.
308 Psychological AsjJects of Mrs Willett's Medmmship [partall the links are continuous, he says, and the point where thetranscendental merges with the subliminal

merges may bringa number of associations for you which may not be in the least
applicable—he says, between that point and the point whichhas been mapped out with the word supraliminal there’s nocomplete break : it’s like number.
Here I intervened with a remark that was intended to bringthe discussion to a definite issue : “ Yoia speak of a continuousinteraction between the transcendental, the subbminal and thesupraliminal. Does not interaction imply duality or multiplicity ? In a sense individual human beings are parts of onewhole—that is, they are all rooted, as it were, in the absolute.Are supraliminal and s\d)liminal separate in a manner analogousto the separation of different human beings ? ” The real drift of my previous qiiestions seems now to flash
into Gurney’s mind for the first time. The effect was dramatic.“ BOSH ”, he almost shouted—at least the word was utteredby the automatist in a tone of voice so loud and startling thatfor the moment 1 was fairly taken aback. “ Bosh ! differentaspects of the same thing
No doidit it is to this incident that Gurney is referring when,in a later script (quoted on p. 256 above), he charges me withhaving tried to get him “ on the horns of a duality which woiildalmost amount to a concei)tion of the selves as separated in sucha way as to amount to 2 entities ”. Yet even now it is clearthat he has not fully grasped the nature of the cblemma as it presents itself to me. If supraliminal and subliminal are to beregarded as aspects of a unitary self, 1 should have nothing tosay in deprecation of his contemptuous outburst. That aspectsof a self cannot be selves on their own account is, in fact, one ofthe very points for which 1 have been contending throughoutthe present chapter. If they are aspects of a self they cannot beseparate selves : if they are not separate selves, how can theybe used in satisfactory explanation of those phenomena ofabnormal psychology for the imderstanding of which separateselves seem to be imperatively demanded—such, for instance, as secondary personalities of the Sally Beauchamp type, or those “ nunciative automatisms ” which Myers himself admitsto be indistinguishable in form and circumstance from tele-
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship 309
pathic messages accepted by him as proceeding from independent entities whether spirits of the dead or other human beings ? Neither in Human Personality nor in the Willett scripts do I find
any plausible answer to this question. Indeed, one might go
further and suggest that the sci’ipts now under consideration
show a distinct disposition to shirk it. We are expressly
warned not to confuse the relation of suimaliminal to subliminal
“ with the whole question of secondary and tertiary personalities and their respective memories of each other. . . . Those
are cases of dislocation, imperfect and often pathological, the
creak of the machine ”. In other words, explanation of them
is to be sought in organic disturbances. That they are often
connected with organic disturbances may readily be conceded ; but the Myers of Human Personality would have frankly
admitted, and indeed strenuously contended, that the splitting
of the personality into at least quasi -independent selves occurs
in persons to all appearance perfectly healthy, and calls for
explanation in terms of mind.
Of course, if you sweep on one side all phenomena that seem
hard to reconcile with your theory, you simplify the problem ; but you do so at the expense of leaving it unsolved.
The same tendency to avoid facing crucial cases is discernible,
I think, in what I may call the Flaccus-Tlaccus incident. This
incident provides the only case claimed by the scripts as a
definite example of a “ message ” sent by the subliminal selfon its own account, and not merely as transmitter of messages
from a communicating spirit—to the supraliminal.
The automatist, who was not in trance, records a name
received by her as “ Flaccus ”. This was correct ; but it was
followed by the remark, “ No, that is wrong ”. In a note,
written after the sitting was over, she adds—evidently with
reference to the correcting words—that what she had recorded
as “ Flaccus ” might have been “ Tlaccus ”. In a later script
(see pp. 255-6 above) Gurney interprets the words, “ No, that is wrong ”, not as forming part of the communicator’s message,
but as being a remark addressed by the automatist’s subliminal
self to her supraliminal, and as applying, not to the correctly
recorded Flaccus , but to an erroneous impression on the
part of the suprahminal that perhaps what should have been
written was “ Tlaccus ”.
310 Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett's Mediumship [partLeft to my own resources I should have supposed that theautomatist herself took the words “no, that is wrong ”, to
come from the communicator ; and that afterwards, on readingover the script, had applied them to the name “ Flaccus ”, andremembered that she had doubted at the time whether this
might not have been “ Tlaccus ”. The interpretation of thewords as addressed by the subliminal to the supraliminal, andreferring to an unexpressed thought, rests upon the authorityof Gurney alone. Let us assume he was right, at least to this
extent, that the words were no part of the communicator’smessage, but represent the emergence of a doubt in IVIrs Willett’s
own mind. It seems quite unnecessary to invoke the machinery of a supraliminal ami a subliminal self in order to explain so familiar a psychic experience. It would certainly never haveoccurred to me to regard it as evidence of an interaction betweentwo independent entities associated together in the sameorganism.
There are, of course, plenty of mental experiences which arecapable of being described in figurative language that impliessome sort of diipfication of mind ; as, for instance, when someone, hesitating what course of action he shall adopt, says, “ I was in two minds about it ”. In such a case nobody wouldseriously suggest that an interaction between two distinct
selves is involved. The duality is in the thought, not in thethinker, who holds the alternatives together and comparesthem. I should imhesitatingly assign the Flaccus-Tlaccusincident to this type of experience, if, with Gurney, we ascribethe correcting words to the automatist herself. But the question remains, is it possible to reduce to this type the cases inwhich, to quote Gurney’s own words, the selves “ act apparently so disconnectedly as to lead one to think of them asseparate ” ? Here the Flaccus-Tlaccus incident is not illuminating.
It is important to make as clear as possible the distinction, as I see it, between phases of a self and separate selves. Forme phases of a self are successive states of ego ; they signifychanges in the contents of consciousness of an ego. Separateselves, on the other hand, are co-conscious egos ; that is to say,
egos which bear the characteristic marks of self-hood contem-
140] Psychological Aspects of Mrs Willett’s Mediumship 311
poraneouslyd Successive states of an ego may, I am quite ready
to grant, present such contrasts as to produce marked alterations of personality. 2 I am further ready to grant that even in cases where memory of experience in state A seems to be completely lost in state B, nevertheless fragmentary recollection of
those experiences may occasionally rise to the surface and
mingle in a puzzHng manner with the contents of state B—though I certainly should not describe the intrusive memories as messages from an A self to a B self. What I am not prepared to believe is that successive states
of an ego can ever be equivalent to a plurality of co-conscious
egos capable of interaction with each other. To speak of
successive states of an ego as “ selves ” in any sense is, in my
view, misleading : to confuse them with co-conscious selves is to commit a serious error. I cannot but think that Myers was guilty of this error when
he tried to make his theory of the subliminal and the supraliminal do double duty, and provide him with an account of the
structure of human personality which satisfied the claims at once of unity and of plurality. Both the unity and the plurality
have suffered in the process. When he wishes to emphasise the
unity, the element of plurality is whittled down to a difference
of aspects, or phases, or even faculties of a unitary self. When
the claim of plurahty is uppermost he does not hesitate to use language the natural meaning of which is that the self as such
is divisible into fragmentary parts.
My own ideas I will once more try to sum up in baldest
outline.
The self which we all habitually recognise as being ourself is one and indivisible, but it is associated in the personality as a
whole, not only with an organism, but with a number of
centres of consciousness each of which is to be regarded as similarly one and indivisible, that is to say, as a self or monad.
Among these other selves it occupies a position of primacy, and m normal conditions is in supreme control of the organism.
^ For illustrations in Mrs Willett’s case of the distinction between co- conscious egos and successive states of the same ego, see pp. 147-8 above.
2 1 doubt, however, whether extreme cases of alternating personalities are to be explamed in this way. I refer the reader to my remarks on this subject on p. 274.
312 Psychological Asjjects of Mrs Willetfs Mediumship [part
This conception of human personality is avowedly based on
the observed phenomena of abnormal psychology. We have
no direct evidence of the existence of these other, or secondary,
selves, except when they reveal themselves as dissociated
intelligences capable of acting on the primary self and being
acted on by it. Nevertheless the continuing existence of the
dissociated selves after and before dissociation is at least a
plausible assumption ; and, if they continue to exist, it is a
further plausible assumption that they may continue to interact
with the primary self and influence its conscious or subconscious
content, even though the influence is no longer recognised by
the primary self as proceeding from an independent source.
Finally, in order to complete my hypothesis, I have to
generalise, and to assume that this composite psychical constitution, of which there is evidence in exceptional cases (and
perhaps in dreaming), is not conflned to such cases, but is a common characteristic of all human personality. If this be so, interaction with the subordinate selves may be continually at
work modifying the thought-content of the primary self of all of us ; but unless the modification appears to the primary self
to be impressed upon it from without by something other than
itself, its thoiights will be /or it its own thoughts, and will carry
with them no objective ^ significance.
Interaction within the group of selves I conceive to be telepathic ; and I by no means exclude the possibility—or even
the probability—of a similar interaction between them and a
spiritual environment external to them.
I make no attempt to carry my analysis further or to try to
imagine in detail how the cbfferent factors in human personality
work together to produce unity and order. Any such attempt
would involve an enqiiiry not only into the relation of mind to
mind, but of mind to body, with the metaphysical problem of
the relation of mind and matter looming in the background.
In this paper I have conflned myself all but entirely to the

miration, and regard Pha ntasms of the Ijiving and Human
Personality as the greatest contributions yet made to the study
of the subjects with which jisychical research deals. Although
in the present chapter prominence has inevitably lieen given to
points on which 1 differ from him rather than to points of
agreement, it is far from my wish to stress the dift’erences
unduly. 1 do not indeed look upon them as unimportant from
the theoretical standpoint. But if regard be had to the conclusion at which Myers arrived on the matters wiiich lie had
most at heart, I do not think the acceptance of my view's need
substantially affect his position one way or the other. Myers
considered that he had proved three things ^
; in the first place,
that survival is a reality ; in the second place, that betw'een the
spiritual and the material w'orlds an avenue of communication
does, in fact, exist ; in the third place, that the surviving sjiirit
retains, at least in some measure, the memories and loves of
earth. With these conclusions 1 am in S3'mpathy, though
Myers was surely oversanguine in holding them to lie proved.
Evidence is slowlv accumulating, but even to-dav, more than a generation after his death, I cannot sax’ that it amounts to
proof.
On the other hand the case for survival does not rest on
Myers s anal^'sis of lunnan personality, and would in no wav
suffer by a change in our conception of it that would substitute a group of suliorrlinate selves interacting with a dominant self,
and in normal conditions subliminal thereto, for a single self
mysteriously divisible into layers or strata that interact with
each other as if thev were independent co-conscious selves.
The difference between the two conceptions may affect om-

ideas concerning the process of communication. But forevidence to enable us to distinguish between what I havecalled “ interior ” and “ exterior ” communication, and, again,between communication from minds incarnate and communication from minds discarnate, we must look to content of thecommunications themselves. Sidelights upon this mostdifficult line of incpiiry may be found here and there in theforegoing pages, but the inquiry itself lies outside the subjectproper of tliis paper.

Scientific discovery is like the fitting together of the pieces of a great
jig-saw puzzle. . . . One day we ask the scientist how he is getting on ; he replies, “ Finely. 1 have very nearly finished this piece of blue sky.”
Another day you ask how the sky is progressing and are told, “ I have
added a lot more, but it was sea, not sky ; there’s a boat floating on the tog of it . . . ” Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World.
Part I
1 Since the period covered by my first paper on this subject,^ I have
completely revised and considerably extended the work therem re- ported. Certain modifications have been introduced into the
analytical technique, while much additional material has become
Proc. S.P.R., Part 1.36, vol. xlii, pp. 173-240 ; hereinafter referred to as Q.S.T.P., I. Y 319

'
data published by Mr Hereward Carringtond
Broadly speaking, the upshot is, first, that difference in reaction
time or reproduction is not, as I had originally supposed, in itself evidence that the personalities concerned are independent ; second,
that Controls (“ Feda,” “ Uvani ”) are related to the normal personalities of their mediums in an inverse fashion, which seems explicable only by supposing them to be secondary personalities, probably formed round a nucleus of repressed material. Communicators (“ John,” “ Etta,” “ Dora ”) are not so related, and there is some reason for supposing that in the formation of the first and last
of these two different factors are at work, while the second showssigns of a more developed autonomy.
References to the mathematical treatment are inevitable in the
course of the discussion ; but readers who are distressed by these imay conveniently omit sections 2 and 12 to 16 inclusive.
2 '
'Thanks to the continued kindness of Professor Fisher, to whom I am again heavily indebted throughout, the original method of
analysis has been improved and extended in the following respects :
{a) The difficulties arising from the occasional occurrence of (excessively and meaninglessly long reaction times (or, mutatis \m.utandis, psycho-galvanic reflexes have been dealt with by a |process of “ scaling ” the raw material to a standard form. This
consists in re])lacing the actual observed time (or deflexion) by oneJof the numbers 1 to 10, according to whether it is (1) less than 25%iof the median of the aggregate (sitting) to which it belongs, or 1(2) not less than 25% Init less than 50%, or (3) not less than 50%,'il)ut less than 75% . . . etc. up to (10) not less than 225% of the
|median.^
This procedure prevents the results being unduly influenced by a few freakish values and greatly lightens the arithmetic. On this score alone it amply repays the not very serious labour involved in
the process of scaling.

“ In dealing with psycho-galvanic reflexes I have found it better to use classes Jof 50% steps instead of 25%. This conforms to the higher “ resolving power

{h) Corrections have been applied for the effects of fatigue or other
causes tending to produce steady changes in the reactions observed,
e.g. reduction of PGR or lengthening of RT towards the end of the
sittingd
(c) In addition to the tests for Similarity (S) and Difference (D)
used in Q.S.T.P., I, and explained in Appendix II thereof, I have
calculated a third quantity, which I term Covariance (C), for most of
the pairs of personalities compared. This is a measure of the extent
to which the personalities concerned vary together from occasion to
occasion in respect of the various words ; it is relevant to such questions as whether the effect of a hot day, for example, would be to
make both react more quickly to ice, say, than to fire.
Using the the notation of Q.S.T.P., I, this quantity is given by
2=1 log, (OW/OWP)
where the letters stand for the mean squares. The value of is
1 / 7(w-l) (»'-l)
where n is the number of words in the list and n' the number of
sittings.
The term Covariance seems appropriate as suggesting the property
of varying together under changing influences and is not hkely, in
this context, to conflict with existing usage. The tendency to co- vary seems, however, to be slight, so that the quantity has not proved
particularly informative.
(d) For each personality considered I have also calculated a
quantity which I am calling Individuality (I) for short, though some
such term as “ differentiational consistency ” might be more exact.
It is a measure of the extent to which the reactions to different words
are consistently different for the personality concerned ; it is relevant
to the question of whether, and to what extent, the personality
always gives a longer time to goat, say, than to pig and to pig than
to CAT, during the jieriod covered by the tests. It is given by
J
l„g, (W/OW)
where W and OW are given the obvious interpretations ajipropriate
to a single personality. The value of is
Jn'l2{n- 1) {n' - 1)
This quantity has proved distinctly illuminating in certain cases, as will be seen below.
^ I shall henceforward use the abbreviations PGR, RT and RPN for Psychogalvanic Reflex(es), Reaction Time(s) and (disturbance in) Reproduction(s),
respectively, whenever convenient. A Glossary of technical terms is given on

The results actually obtained are given in detail in Tables I, II and III at the end of this paper. In these Tables, z is the magnitude
calculated, and may be taken, broadly speakuig, as a measure of the
degree of Similarity, Difference, etc., present, while P is the probability of such a result being due to chance, given the observed
variabihty of the data.
The results are numbered as follows : Each estimate of Individuality has its own number ; but a single number is used, as will
be seen, to refer to the total process of comparing any pair of personalities, and this may contaui tests of Similarity, Difference and
Covariance. For purposes of reference these wdll be distinguished in
the text by the suffixes -1, -2, -3 respectively ; thus RN 73-1 refers
to the result of testing Normal Leonard and John for Similarity (RT)
in the first Thomas experiment, RN 79-3 to that of testing Feda and
Etta for Covariance, and so on.^

The mass of material thus obtained is of considerable complexity,
for we are concerned with five “ mediums ” (counting Mrs Salter and
Mr Gatty in this category), twenty-one “ personalities,” three
methods of testing (PGR, RT and RPN), four kinds of estimate
(I, S, D, C) and three lists of words.
It is accordingly impracticable to deal with the facts by the continuous development of any single theme. In the circiimstances I have thought it best to concentrate somewhat arbitrarily on certain
major features of the results and the conclusions which it seems
legitimate to draw from them, and to relegate a number of minor
issues to the discursive notes of sections 34 to 40 in Part IV.
J^ART II The Resterman-Gatty Experiment
8
During the period covered by this paper, the first noteworthy
event in point of time, and one of the most important in its implications, was the Besterman-Gatty experiment of June 1934.
This was undertaken in order to test the view originally held by
me and expounded in Q.S.T.P., I, to the effect that if two personalities possess a common subconscious they could not, apart from
deliberate cheating, produce significantly different sets of reaction
times or disturbances in reproduction ; with the corollary that
where such differences are observed they constitute strong evidence
of the autonomy of the personalities concerned.
Mr Gatty, who acted as subject, had led, for a considerable part of
his career, a kind of double life—in the entirely innocent sense that
his activities had alternated between scientific research work at
Oxford and the ordinary sporting and similar avocations of a country
gentleman in Hampshire. These two contexts, as I may call them,
formed the bases of the two “ poses ” or “ orientations of mind ”
which he assumed alternately in the two conditions—known as Gatty(O) and Gatty(H) respectively—in which he was tested.
In addition he adopted attitudes and volitions as indicated by the
following extracts from a letter to myself : Pose (0) : “I merely visualised myself in the Balliol Quad, looked
for scientific associations, and imagined an uneventful life with a somewhat auditory memory. I supposed myself bashful aliout an
unsuccessful love-affair, tried to be slow in my responses and flat in
reflexes. Being at lower tone I managed to mishear some words and
32(j Whately Carmgton, 31.A., M.Sc. [partconfused pond and bond, bread and red deliberately. Aimed atbeing a complex ]ierson who faiUd at his reproduction test.”
Pose (H) : “ Here I merely lived in Hampshire and Scotland.Was fond of games, travel, shooting and hunting. Quite spontaneous about a great girl friend (fictitious) . . . aimed at quick responses,and big refiexes by conjuring up vivid pictures in my mind, and avisual memory.”
He adds, “ beyond trying for bigger reflexes in personality (H) Idid not try for detailed faking.” By this is meant that there was nopreliminary planning as regards trying to give specially long (orshort) times or specially large (or small) reflexes in response to particidar words. But he continues, “ I believe I could do this ” (fakein detail) “ in another set of experiments, but not to a great extent.”The necessity, however, does not arise, for Mr Hatty’s generalisedefforts were attended by a large measure of success and effectivelyanswer the question which the work was designed to investigate.
9
In the first place the reaction times are unmistakably longer, asmtended, in the 0 state than the H ; and the reflexes bigger as Hthan as 0. Details are given m Table C below, which shows themean RT in fifths of a second and mean scale deflexion corrected forsensitivity, for 0 and H personalities, at the six sittmgs employed.Table C

141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 327
As regards IIT it is remarkal)le, first, that in the whole 1,200
reactions not one was more than doul)le the median of the sitting
to which it belonged ; second, that despite this relatively low variahility the Individualisation in each pose (RN 146, 147) was significantly high. But note how the deliberate slowing of response has
produced a much lower value of I in the 0 state (RN 146) than in
the H (RN 147).
The effect on the reflexes is very curioiis. In each case (RN 139,
140) an insignificant (negative) value of I is obtained ; that is to say,
the deflexions behave as if they were no more than chance determined,
and this is confirmed by the comparisons for S and D (RN 158‘1,
158'2). In other words, the nett outcome of Mr Gatty’s efforts in
this resj)ect has merely been to confuse the issue and render the
results nnintelligihle.
As regards reproduction, the difference t)etween 0 and H is well
marked, as might be expected from the expressed intention cpioted
above. The figures for successful attempts in 600 trials are
Gatty (0) - - 448 167-1 „ (H) - - 505 167-2
Thus we have
Right Wrong
Gatty (0) - - 448 152
„ (H) - - 505 95
Applying the usual method of Contingency ^ we obtain
y2 = l6-56. P=<-000,1 167-3
The difference is clearly significant, though irrelevant to our enquiry, since it is not on the absolute number of failures in reproduction, but on the distribution of these among the words, that our judgments are based.
10
When we turn to the comparisons between 0 and H we find results
of the utmost interest and importance.
The reflexes, it is true, speak with a quite uncertain voice, but
both reaction times (RN 161-2) and reproductions (RN 163‘2) show
a significant difference between the two states. Since there can be no doubt that Gatty (0) and Gatty (H) equally
are Gatty, and possess a common subconscious, these results effec- tively knock the bottom out of my original view that such differences
cannot be produced by a single individual and therefore indicate,

328 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [partwhen ol)served, that the personalities concerned are autonomous andindependent.
For this erroneous opinion there was, I think, some justificationat the time that it was formed. The work of Prince and Petersenstrongly indicated that secondary personalities of pathological typecould be relied upon to give the same reflexes as their primaries,while my earlier work ^ had shown a strong connection between reflex and reaction time, for the correlation between the two observables taken over an average of fifty subjects on a list of 100 words isr=-4fi 168which is highly significant. The argument from these facts that theconclusion that the same woiild obtain for reaction times (and re-])roductions) as obtained for reflexes was evidently in the nature ofan illegitimate transference, aided by the emphasis that Jung andHleuler had laid on the unconscious or subconscious determinationof reaction time and disturbance in reproduction.
To these factors must be added the effect of my own prepossessionsin favour of coming to a “ positive ” conclusion. Any man whodeclares that he is without bias in this subject occupies, it seems tome, the position of a watchmaker who declares that he has made aclock of perfect accuracy which neither gains nor loses ; that is tosay, he is either a wilful deceiver or he does not know his job. Themost one can do is to determuie the sense and if possible the approximate virulence of one’s jjrejudices and discoiuit one’s less rigid arguments accordingly, just as the watchmaker determines the “ rate
”of his chronometer and applies an appropriate correction.
11
lie this as it may, I wish to make it perfectly clear that myoriginal view was quite evidently wrong and that this experimentshows clearly that significant differences in RT and RPN can be produced by a generalised, non-fraudulent “ pose ” or change in mentalorientation having nothing to do with any deliberate picking andchoosuig among the words of the list. It follows that the discoveryof such differences between a normal and a trance personality offersno justification at all (except in a purely permissive sense) for supposmg that the latter is independent of the former and does notshare a common subconscious with it. Additional experiments on these lines are, of course, highly desirable, but more for the purpose of investigating the scope andlimitations of such ])Oses than of confirmiug the scarcely dubitableconclusion drawn.

I hope I need hardly add that this enforced revision of opmion
leaves my withers quite unwrung. Facts are holy and sacred, but no
right-minded man should resent his interpretations being overset.
On the contrary, if every experiment yields results conforming to
expectation, the prudent investigator will suspect that there is something amiss somewhere ; but if he succeeds in showing that he was
wrong, he may be tolerably certain that real progress is bemg made.
Part III
“ Controls ” v. “ Communicators ”
12
The conclusions reached hi this part are best approached somewhat
circuitously by way of a general survey of certain features of the
results as a whole.
We may first note that, so far as the mathematics of the analysis
are concerned, there is no a priori reason why any value of z for
I. S. D or C should be positive rather than negative. In fact, if we
were to obtain our data by drawing numbers out of a hat we should
expect to find positive and negative results occurrmg with equal
frequency.
On the other hand, inasmuch as we are dealmg throughout with
human beings in one guise or another, we should expect them, m the
absence of error, to exhibit some measure of consistency {ptace the
cynics) m their response to words, some measure of resemblance to
each other, some difference, and some tendency to react alike to
differences between the occasions on which they are tested. On this
score, we should expect all results to be positive.
But error is by no means absent, and while it will tend to inflate some results it will dimmish others, to the point perhaps, if there lie no more than this “ common humanity ” at work, of pushing some
of them over the borderfine into negativity. Error alone, however,
cannot be expected to do this to any significant extent.
The comparative plenitude of results available enables us to deal
in what might be termed statistics of the second degree—that is, in
statistics of statistics—and we may begin by examining the actual
distribution of positive and negative results as displayed in
Table D.^

{N.B. The totals do not all agree with those of Tables A and Bbecause certain pairs of resnlts, viz. B,N 1 and 2, 5 and G, 19 and 20,deal with the same material by different methods, as indicated inthe Notes on Eesults ; they can accordingly only be connted as oneeach here.)
We may note at once that onr expectation of a heavy preponder-ance of positive resnlts, based on the “ common humanity ” factor,is, on the whole, well fulfilled. If the data were chance determinedthroughout, we should expect 14G positive and 146 negative results ; we actually obtain 233 and 59 respectively. Applying the usualmethod to ascertain the probability of this being accidental, we have= 103-68. P much less than 10~® 169(N.B. No good ])urpose is served by evaluatmg P beyond thisvalue, which is the lowest given in Fisher’s Tables.)
We conclude that potent factors other than chance are at workand are producing on the whole the kind of results we should expect.As agahist this the number of negative results actually obtained,namely 59, or 21%, is far from negligible, and it will be instructive toenquire whether these are to be attributed solely to error, or whetherthere are causes definitely tending to give negative values. If so, we shall want to know where these are located, how they operate, andhow they are to be interpreted.
14
We may next remark that the highest ])ercentage of negative re- sults (36%) is found among the figures for Covariance. This 1 thiidv
is to be expected, since to ask })ersonalities to co-vary Irom occasion
141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 331
to occasion is trying the linkage between them a good deal higher,
so to s])eak, than is required for a general similarity for which all
occasions are pooled and minor variations averaged out.
If we apply to these figures the same process that we used for the
totals, we have
x2 = 3-92. P = -05v.n 170
so that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether Covariance is, in
general, a genuine phenomenon at all. On the other hand, it is re- markable that the two states of both Mr Gatty and Mrs Salter co- vary significantly (RN 163-3, 164-3) on RPN, although the former
are negligibly similar (RN 163-1). This very curious result must, I
think, be put into cold storage for the time being, though I shall
allude to its possible significance below.
In any event we may safely ascribe the negative results in the Covariance figures to chance ; for apart from the antecedent likelihood
of this, more detailed examination shows that they are not distributed among personalities, or otherwise, in any significant or even
suggestive fashion.
I conclude that the tendency to co-vary is so feeble, as a general
rule, that the effect of error is almost as likely as not to produce a
negative as a positive result.
15
We may also summarily dismiss as of no importance those negative results which appear among the figures for I and D. In the first
place, there are very few of them ; in the second, it would, I think,
be almost impossible to assign any mtelligible interpretation to them
if there were not—certainly we need not strain our ingenuity in such
a way before we are required to do so. For the sake of completeness we use the same procedure as before.
obtaining for Individualities
X^ = 39-06. P less than 10"® 171
and for Difference
X^ = 49-00. P less than 10"® 172
It is clear that there is, on the whole, a highly significant tendency —as we should expect—for personalities to be positively individualised and to differ from each other.
16
Viewing the data from a somewhat different angle, we may note
the very small pro|)ortion (8 in 101 ) of negative results found under
332 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Se. [parttlip heading of RErRODUCTioNS. These figures, treated as before,
give
X^ = 7l-ryi. P much less than 10“® 173-1
wliicli is very remarkable when we consider that 7 negative Covariances are included. Not a smgle negative value appears among thefigures for I or for S and only one among those for D.
If we compare the figures for RPN (93 positive, 8 negative) withthose for all the other results taken together (140 positive, 51 negative) we obtain
X“= 14-45. P = -001 v.n 173-2
The reproduction test is, in other words, significantly less liable
than the others (RT or PGR) to yield negative results.
17
By this slightly unsystematic process of examination we havenarrowed our study of the incidence of negative results down to the
point at which it is clear that their interesting occurrence, if any, is chiefly among Similarities for RT and PGR.
Extracting the appropriate figures from the Table and rewriting
for the sake of clearness, we have
PGR RT Total
Positive - - 11 28 39
Negative - 5 20 25
Total - - 16 48 64
At first sight this looks as if the tendency to give negative results were apjneciably greater for RT than for PGR ; but this is not the
case, for on testing we obtain only
x2 = 0-55. P = -23v.n 174
which is quite insignificant.
If we compare the figures for PGR and RT (39 positive, 25 negative) with all others taken together, we have
x2-“ 18-08. P= <-000,1 175-1
For PGR oidy, not including RT in the remainder,
X^ = 2-98. P = -04v.n 175-2
and for RT only, not including PGR in the remamder,
X^= 18-04. P= <-000,1 175-3
It is clear the RT Similarities are especially liable to yield negative
results, while there is a reasonably strong suspicion that this applies
to PGR Similarities also.
141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 333
Thus even this most general treatment of the data provides us with coercive evidence to tlie effect that there exists between the
members of many pairs of })ersonalities a strange and almost sinister
relationship—a relationship of inverse likeness ; as it might be of a shadow—but reversed ; of a doppelgdnyer—but facing backwards !
18
It is very important to realise that a negative similarity, or a negative correlation, implies just as close a connection between the
two entities compared as does a positive result of the same statistical significance. The two ends of a see-saw are not the less parts
of a single mechanism because one goes up when the other goes
down.
My own feeling, indeed, though I should be sorry to have to justify
it rigidly, is that a negative result gives a greater assurance of inti- mate connection than a positive. I can more or less understand two
sets of reactions being similar, despite the true independence—in the
ordinary psychological sense—of the personalities concerned ; but I really cannot imagine their being countersimd&v (to adopt a convenient term) except by supposing that one is really m some sense the
counterpart of the other, as it might be the inside and the outside of
a repomse plaque.
Again, we may think of a projecting lantern in which two slides are
inserted together. It is easy to imagine that the slide with the
stronger pattern may obscure the image of the other, by superposition, to the point of extinction ; but however far this may be carried,
imagination boggles at the idea that the stronger should superimpose
its own image reversed !
19
Reverting to the main thread of the discussion, we may enquire
whether this tendency to “ countersimilarity,” as I shall henceforward term it, is to be found equally among all personalities, or types
of personality, or whether it is appreciably localised in this respect.
Only a slight inspection of the Tables, in which negative results are additionally distinguished by the sirffixing of an asterisk, will be
needed to show that the former hypothesis is incorrect.
In Table II, particularly, it will be seen that RT Similarities in- volving Feda have almost a monopoly of negative values. These are formd in RN 72, 79, 101, 104, 105, 114, 116 and 118, while only those
for 75 and 78 are positive.
On the other hand, among comparisons not involving Feda, we
334 Wlmtely Oai'ingfon, 31. A., 71/.*%. [partfind a negative Similarity only at RN 103, while RN 71, 73, 74, 76,77, 80, 102, lOG, 1 13, 1 15 and 117 are positive.^

In order to asccrtaiii the chajrce of this inequality of distribution4being accidental, we work as usual and obtam
_X“ = ll-59. P= <-000,5 176In other words, the odds are more than two thousand to one injfavour of the supposition that countersimilarity is associated with|| Feda rather than with other personalities.^
||I think there can be no reasonable doubt whatever about the| genuineness of this effect. Not only does Feda show countersimi-I larity in eight cases out of ten, but she does so m respect of five different personalities (at one time or another), with two different;experimenters, and with three different lists of words. Moreover,| one of her countersimilarities (RN 116) is intrinsically significant,whereas her highest positive similarity (RN 75) is no more than71417 with -10 chance of being accidental.^
;
|20
If we turn to the Garrett Group (Table I) we find the same kindtof tendency in Uvani as we have just studied in Feda, though herethe effect is not nearly so marked.^
* For the purposes of this discussion, I do not include RN 81 to 85 or 119I to 122, which are comparisons of Mr Drayton Thomas and Mr Irving respec- i tively, with the personalities of the Leonard group. The question of whether| these gentlemen are secondary personalities or discarnate entities has happily; not yet arisen, while it would be fantastic to suggest that either of them is at mere modification of Mrs Leonard. !
^ Strictly, we should say that the odds are more than two thousand to one] against the hypothesis that countersimilarity is no more likely to occur in
[ comparisons which involve Feda than in those which do not.
j ^ It is interesting to note that of the three anomahes, or exceptions to the'
rule that Feda is countersimilar in comparison while other personalities are not, i two (RN 75 and 103) are comparisons with P (Prepared Leonard). This per- sonahty is extremely erratic, as is indicated by the very low values which she; (gives for I. This relative imreliability may also contribute to the abnormalI (value of RN 116. ! ,^ In what follows I uniformly exclude the personality known as “ Abdulatif ”
(A) from consideration. He is described as a
“ secondary control ” of Mrsp
141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 335
Among the RT Similarities iiivolvmg Uvaui we find four negative
values (RN 30, 31, 32, 33) and one positive (RN 34) ; while for comparisons into which Uvani does not enter we have three positive
(RN 37, 38, 39) and one negative (RN 36). Application of the usual
treatment gives
X^ = 2-72. P = -05v.n 177
This result as it stands is far from coercive, but it is m the same
sense as that obtamed for Feda, and the difference m significance
corresponds well with that in the quantity of data used (c/. Table
B)d
I think there is very little doubt that what is true here for Feda is true for Uvani also ; at any rate there seems nothing to be gained by
disputing the indications.
If we care to regard Feda and Uvani as constituting a class of
Controls—using the word, as is more or less customary in psychical
research, to denote personalities specifically associated with the
medium, as opposed to Communicators associated with particular
sitters—and to combine the figures, we have
Positive Negative Total
F and U Similarities - 3 12 15
Other >> 14 2 16
Totals 17 14 31
whence
y2= 14-24. P = -000,1 v.n
The results obtained in this and the preceding section may he taken as establishing beyond any reasonable doubt the fact that it is [except by
rare accident) uniquely characteristic of Controls, as represent^ by
Feda and Uvani, to be countersimilar to the other personalities of
the psychological manifold to which they belong. Conversely, it is only
to Controls that other hinds of personality are [except by rare accident)
countersimilar. More mtelligibly, if less accurately, countersimilarity is a property of Controls but not of normal personalities or of
Communicators.
21
It will be worth while digressing briefly to reconsider the nature
of the test for Similarity, in order that we may be clear in our minds
Garrett, but it is not clear whether he should be regarded as a Control or as a Communicator, in the sense in which I use the terms [vide infra), and, in either event, he behaves inconsistently.
‘More accurately than the Table indicates, the results just obtained for Feda are based on about 5,000 observations and those for Uvani on about 1 ,800.
330 Whafely Caringfon, M.A., M.8c. [partas to what is actually involved. Mathematically speaking, a negative similaTity is precisely equivalent to a negative correlation (indeed, intra-class correlation is only a particular example of theAnalysis of Variance. Cf. Fisher, loc. cit., section 40).
In ordinary language, it indicates a tendency for one of the pair ofpersonalities compared to give relatively long reaction times (orlarge reflexes) in responding to words on which the other gives relatively short times (or small reflexes) ; and ime versa. The figures employed are the totals ^ for the various words, for allsittings, the data being “ scaled ” and corrected for fatigue, as in-dicated above. Thus day-to-day variations are to a great extentaveraged out and the result refers to the effect of the words on thewhole.
It is not suggested, of course, that every word giving a total (oraverage) time, say, greater than the mean in the case of one person-jality, will give a time less than the mean in the case of the other—' many words will, in general, agree in being above or below the mean1for both ; but the obtaining of a negative result for the whole list'
does imply that the words which are dissimilar in this sense outweigh*those that are alike. I22
The question of the psychological interpretation to be placed on, this jflienomenon of the countersimilarity of Controls is naturallyone of the very greatest importance, and I may say at once that inmy judgment the facts are only to be understood by supposing thatFeda and Uvani are secondary personalities of Mrs Leonard and Mrs' Garrett respectively, probably formed, round nuclei of repressedmaterial.^
| On this hypothesis, the curious phenomenon of countersimilaritybecomes instantly intelligible.
We will suppose that a quantity of psychological material has be-; come repressed, in the ordinary psychoanalytic sense, with respectf|to the normal consciousness. This material, consi.sting of “ideas,”j“ tendencies,” etc., not j)roperly integrated into the personality, willidseek relief with a vigour depending on their extent and the intensityof their repression. It is entirely concordant with establishedJ]>sychological knowledge to suppose that this rehef may take thej^ Tlie use of totals is merely to economise arithmetical labour ; precisely the
" same results would be obtained by using mean (average) times or reflexes.
^ Various indications, not yet fully studied, suggest that the antithesis which countersimilarity reveals may be more generalised than is suggested byItlie word “ nucleus.”
141] The QvantitaUve Sfnrh/ of Trance Perffovalitieff 337
form of the intermittent apjiearance of a .secondary [)er.sonality,
which represent,s in a dramatised ami S3anbolic form the tendencies,
etc., repressed.
Now suppose that a, stimulus word is given to the normal personality such that the most natural association to it is in turn connected
with the repressed material. To reply with this naturally associated
word would have the effect of bringing nearer to the forefront of
consciousness, so to speak, just those thoughts which, ex hypofhesi, are least accejitable to it. The threatened conflict can only be avoided
by rejecting this first word and substitutmg another which, while still associated with the first, is relatively innocent of eridogenic (conflictproducing) connotations.
This process, which may equally well be described in terms of
neurological blockage,” etc., will involve a certain delay ; so that
words of this kind will tend to show longer reaction times than those
whose comrection with the repressed material is negligible.
But if the same word be given to the secondary personality, the
very core of whose being is constituted by the repressed matter, the
foregoing considerations will not apply. The immediately suggested
word will be accepted without demur and the reaction time will be
correspondingly short.
It is easy to see that this process affords a basis for the countersimilarity observed, particularly if we suppose it to be reversible,
so that certam words associated with unrepressed material give
relatively long times for the secondary personality and relatively
short for the normal. This seems reasonable because the relation of
incompatibility assumed to exist between the repre.ssed and unrepressed elements is clearly symmetrical.
In any event, of course, the observed phenomenon stands as a fact on its merits and necessarily implies that certain words having long
times for one personality have short for the other, and vice versa}
23
It .should be noted that the conclusion reached is in no way
invalidated liy the fact that countensimilarity is not observed in the
reproduction test. There is admittedly a .strong association, in most
cases, between prolongation of RT and disturbance in RPN ; but, on
the other hand, it is clear that there must be considerable difference.s
^ Potential critics should note that the procedure of computation is precisely
the same for all comparisons, so that fortuitous errors, if any, would operate
in pairs not involving Peda in just the same way as on those of which she orms a member, and would be as likely to affect one type of comparison as he other.
33S Whatphj Carington, M.A., M.Se. [partIjetween tlie process of finding a word in tlie first instance and that ofsubsequently remembering what word was found.
In any event, no amount of failure to find an effect by one methodcan offset the fact that it is actually found by another.
24
I must here anticipate a criticism which might reasonably beraised in somewhat the following form : “ Conceding that Countersimilarity between A and B indicates that one is a secondary personality of the other, why should Feda, who is coimtersimilar toJohn, Etta and Dora, as well as to the two Leonard forms, be re- garded as essentially a secondary of Normal Leonard ? ”
The answer, I think, lies in the fact that there are only two alternatives open to us (apart from rejecting the evidence altogether), ofwhich we must select the less improbable.
We might, of course, suppose that Feda is “ really ” the primaryor normal personality of which N, P, J, E and D are secondaries.This seems to me altogether fantastic, but some people might notthink the worse of it on that account. The other alternative is tosuppose that Normal Leonard is the primary personality, Feda thesecoirdary—countersimilar thereto—and that the countersimilaritybetween Feda and the others arises, by reflection, as it were, fromthe resemblance of these to Normal Leonard.
If this second view be correct, it is clear, I think, that the com-mon countersimilarity to Feda of N, P, J, E and U must arise fromreactions to words with respect to which these agree, rather thanfrom those with respect to which they differ. In other words, it must arise from what I have termed the “ common humanity
factor. If this is true, and l)earing in mind the account of the process propounded in section 22 above, we should expect to And acertain tendency for words which yield short times when applied toFeda to give, regularly, long times when applied to the other personalities concerned. That is to say, if we make a list of the wordswhich give the shortest times for Feda and note opposite eachwhether it gives a long or a short time for N, P, J and E, say, weshould expect to And a tendency for the “ longs ” to group themselvesinto rows, rather than to be randomly distributed.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to apply this test. Three different lists of words are involved, and two of these (Irving experiment and first Thomas experiment) were carefully chosen so as tocontain a minimum of words of universal interest. {Cf. Q.S.f.P., I,
P- 184.)
In the case of the second Thomas experiment, where a stronger
ItI'BftI(1II' *(illIifjlllllfJIti|{|»toEliiiItlitfi;'klllioiAll'Kp('If
141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 339
list was intentionally used (to which fact may presumably be
attributed the well-marked coimtersimilarities observed despite the
relatively small number of observations) the personality P is evidently unreliable as regards reaction time (KN 45), while no data were collected from Normal Leonard. We are accordingly left with
J and E, constituting a somewhat slender foundation for a test. I
find, however, a tendency to grouping in the expected sense rej^resented by the figure
2= -5027. P=:-03 179
which may be regarded, in the circumstances, as tolerably good
evidence in support of the hypothesis adopted,
I need hardly say that I should not care to press the pomt, although
the fact here noted seemed just worth mentioning as a kind of makeweight. There seems, however, no particular difficulty m the way of
supposhig that the countersimilarity of Feda to personalities other
than Normal Leonard arises in the manner suggested.
25
I must also add a few lines on the subject of the response words
given by Feda and Uvani.
Mr Drayton Thomas, who has made a special study of this aspect
of all the personalities concerned in the experiments which he conI ducted, contends that Feda’s replies have “ a strong Oriental
( flavour.” This is true enough, though I find nothing that cannot
I reasonably be attributed to the vague knowledge of Indian life and
customs that any tolerably well read person can hardly fail to
; acquire ; I find nothing, in fact, that cannot plausibly be ascribed
I to Mrs Leonard’s own conscious or subconscious knowledge.
I On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the very few nonI Enghsh words appearing among Feda’s replies include Samisen,
I which is Japanese ; Amah, which is Chinese, and Yashmak, which is
. Arabic.
In fact, so far as her Orientahsms are concerned, Feda appears to
* desert the trite oidy to achieve the inappropriate.
! Similar considerations apply to Uvani, who can produce nothing
, better than Burnous, Mosque, Mirage, Karma (not a Moslem concep-
.i tion, I think). Shekel and Papyri among the data collected for myI self, to which may be added Akaska (? Akasha ?) and Mazurka (in
reply to Woman and Bride ! !) from Mr Hereward Carrington’s
experiments.
Anyone who finds these convincing may be regarded as beyond
hope, while, on the other hand, there is a strong tendency to a stilted
340 Whately Garington, M.A., M.Sc. [partpretentiousness of response (exemplified by such words as Affirmation, Beneficence, Jeojxmlise. Endeavour, Introspective, Exhilaration,etc.) which seem to me singularly out of character for an Arab whopurports to know no English.
In short, no attempt to sujjport the autonomy of either Feda orUvani by an appeal to the Indian or Arabian character of theirreplies would appear to have a chance of standhig for a momentagainst intelhgent criticism.
26
The question naturally arises as to whether what is true of reac-tion time is true also of the psycho-galvanic reflex. The available evidence, which will be found m Table I, is far fromconclusive, but, so far as it goes, it uidicates that this is the case. Inthis (Garrett) group we hnd ^ for PGR Similarities

whence we have
X“ = M0. P = -15 180a result which is in the same sense as those for RT, but a long wayfrom significance.
As against this, it should be noted that one result (RN 19-1) showsa dehnitely significant comitersimilarity. It is true that the materialis poor (H. C.’s data for 1932) and contams a large number of negative deflexions, but there is no reason why this should affect the issueone way rather than the other. Moreover, the effect is greater(RN 19T) when the more reasonable of the two methods of treatmentis apphed (see Notes on Results).
On the whole the evidence may be said to be pretty strongly inIhvour of countersimilarity in PGR on the part of Uvani.
The obstacles in the way of accepting these indications at thenface value are, first, the work of Prince and Petersen cited m Q.S.T.P.,I, p. 176, and, second, the diliiculty of supposing that so very “physiological ” a phenomenon as the reflex can undergo so curious aninversion or reversal as the result of an essentially “ psychological ”change.
The latter difficulty seems to me more apparent than real, and toproceed mainly from an illegitimate and somewhat question-begging^Neglecting “Abdulatif” as before and remembering that RN 19'1 and2(J'l can only count as one negative result.
141] The Quantitative Study of Trance Tersonalitieis 341
assumption to the effect that a verbal response is in some sense more
“ mental ” and less neurological than a p-g reflex. This is probably
nonsensical, while in any event we know—as Professor Fisher has
kindly remmded me—that in the expression of emotional attitudes,
etc., of opposite kinds very extensive reversals of imiervation take
place. Thus, as Darwin pomted out in his Expression of the Emotions
in Man and Anhnals, muscles which are contracted in aggressive
moods are relaxed in friendly, and vice versa ; and it does not seem
altogether irrational to suppose either that this “ principle of antithesis ” may extend to the hmervational mechanisms of the p-g
reflex, or that the normal and secondary personalities are antithetic
in a relevant sense. As regards the results obtained by Prince and Petersen, I see no
reason for attempting to discount these and can only offer at present
the very tentative conjecture that countersimilarity may be a re- latively superflcial phenomenon observable m respect of material
at levels above that down to which the process of dissociation has
been carried, but not ajjplicable to elements of so profound an emotional significance as to be located, so to speak, m the subconscious
common to both. It seems likely also that countersimilarity would
not occur in respect of very superficial material of small affective
import, so that I would not be surprised if a thorough investigation were not to reveal it as appearmg for words producmg a moderate
effect, but not so those of which the effect is either very slight or very great.
But for our immediate purpose the point is one of academic
hiterest only, and I am well content to leave it in abeyance, pending
further evidence, and to base my judgment that Feda and Uvani are secondary personalities on the coimtersimilarity of the reaction
times alone.
27
That this judgment is correct receives strong collateral support
from an experiment by Dr T. W. Mitchell, which he kindly allows me
to describe.
In the course of a sitting with Mrs Leonard, Dr Mitchell instructed
Feda that whenever during the immediately subsequent conversation, etc., Mrs Leonard being then in her normal condition, he should
lay special stress on the word you hi addressing her (Mrs Leonard) —as by askmg “ What do you think about it ” or the like—she (Feda) was to acknowledge the signal by touching {i.e. causing Mrs Leonard
to touch) a brooch she was wearing at the time. This duly occurred
and the formal identity of the procedure with that of the familiar
type of “ post-hypnotic ” experiment is evident enough. It is clear
342 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [partthat there is an intimate connection between Feda and NormalLeonartl which is not dissolved by the cessation of trance ; further,this connection is such that Feda may be aware of what happens toMrs Leonard hr her normal state and may participate importantlyin her actions.
This constitutes a weighty confirmation of the conclusion inferredfrom Countersimilarity, and the two taken together must, in myjudgment, be considered as settling the question of Feda’s status as asecondary personality beyond any possibility of reasonable doubt.
28
This conclusion, in the formation of which the quahtative indications of one method are supplemented by the quantitative results ofanother, constitutes, I venture to believe, an important advancein positive knowledge.
Ihit not less important is the fact that the evidence from Countersimilarity, which unmistakably proclaims that Feda and Uvani aresecondary personalities, assures us with equal emphasis that John,Etta and Dora are not—or at least that these, if secondaries at all,are of a demonstrably different type.
Controls, as the term is used hi psychical research—those “ slavesof the lam]),” as it were, who habitually take charge as the medium’snormal consciousness is superseded by the trance state—are characterised by the property of coimtersirnilarity ; Communicators,jjurporthig to be discarnate entities particularly associated withindividual sitters, are not so characterised. Moreover, shice thephenomenon of countersimilarity seems to be the natural consequenceof that process of repression to which the formation of secondaryjjersonalities may confidently be ascribed, its absence m the case ofCommunicators leads us to suppose that some other mechanism is responsible for their development.
This again is in accordance with general psychological considerations ; for it would be straining the psycho-analytic conception ofre])ression very far to postulate for every Communicator purportingto manifest through Mrs Leonard a nucleus of repressed material notonly different from the others but a])pro])riate to the impersonationrequired.
1 accortlingly conclude that Communicators, if and in so far as theyare not what they purport to be, are more in the nature of “ histrionic po.ses ” than secondary personalities in the ordinary sense oftliiit term.

29
Unfortunately our only knowledge of “ poses ” is that derived
from the Besterman-Gatty experiment, and this affords too narrow
a basis for any assured generahsation.
The following considerations, on the other hand, do seem to indicate fairly strongly that Communicators constitute a class of personality sui generis, possessiug properties which it is difficult to re- concile with their representing any plausible modification of the
medium’s consciousness.
The tendency for disturbance hi reproduction to be associated with
prolongation of reaction time was first noticed, I believe, by Jung
in his early work on the word-association test. This was confirmed
by my own experiments of 1920-21 ; for example, a group of 518
words gave the followmg distribution as regards long and short RT
and success and failure hi RPN :
Long Short Total
Successes - - 149 221 370
Failures 74 74 148
Totals - 223 295 518
whence we have
X“ = 4-08. B = -02 181
which may be regarded as significant.
In the present instance I have comjiuted the degree of association
between prolongation of reaction time and disturbance hi reproduction for each of the twenty personalities, or varieties thereof, for which
appropriate data were available. The results are shown in Table E.

for the chance that this bias in the distribution is accidental.
30
The matter is, however, rather more complicated than this suggests.
We may reasonably attribute the three exceptions (RN 190, 193,
194) to the rule among non-commmiicators to chance. P is unre- hable at the best of times and in this case (First Thomas experiment)
neither her reaction times nor her reproductions are properly
organised (RN 44, 59). The same is true of Feda m the second
Thomas experiment (RN 48, 63), which yet contrives to give a value
of P = -02 ; but RN 193 must, I thinli:, be attributed to the fortune of
war.But we cannot take this line with Etta’s result from the first Thomas experiment and must regard her as m some way genuinely
different from John and Dora. I will discuss this when I have dealt
with these two.
The point I wish to make in this connection is this : Whenever we
find a significant association between RT and RPN—as is usually
the case—we must conclude that a smgle mind, or undivided part
thereof, is at work ; i.e. that both reaction times and reproductions
are, as it were, drawn from the same source. But if no significant
association is found and yet the two sets of data are well individualised, we camiot ignore—even if we are not prepared unreservedly
to accept—the strong imphcation that they come from different sources and are derived from two different minds.
In the light of these remarks, consider the contributions which go
to make up RN 197. The reaction times are fairly well individualised
(RN 50) ; but they are significantly similar to those of Normal
Leonard (RN 73), and we must conclude that they are, in effect.
346 Whaiely Carington, M.A., 31. 8c. [PABTcontributed by her. The reproductions are signihcaiitly well
organised (RN 65), but it is titty to one agamst their being those of
Normal Leonard (RN 88-2), and the strong suggestion is that theyare not contributed by her.
Again, consider the results given hi this context by Dora. Bothher reaction times (RN 54) and her reproductions (RN 69) are verysignificantly organised and cannot possibly be regarded as randomlydistributed. Her reproductions are mdubitably those of NormalLeonard (RN 125T) ; but even more emphatically (RN 115-2) her
reaction times are not. We camiot possibly attribute these latter to
chance and I find it very difficult to resist the conclusion that, hi this
case, two different minds are at work in the same prima facie personality, one of them being Mrs Leonard and the other someoneelse—jiossibly the late Mrs W. S. Irving.
The same, of course, ap])lies to John with a slightly lesser emphasiscorresponduig to the relative weakness, numerically speaking, of the
Thomas as compared with the Irvhig results.
31
In order to fit Etta (RN 199) into the scheme of things, wc must, I think, make one of two suppositions : we must either say that Ettais not a true Communicator within the meanuig of the act, and oughtto be placed in the other group ; or we must suppose that she hasbrought the art of communication, or whatever corresponds to this
in non-spiritistic terms, to an appreciably higher pitch of perfection
than has either John or Dora, with the result that whereas each ofthese last is significantly infiuenced by the medium hi respect ofeither RT or RPN, she (Etta) is uidependent in respect of both.
The first of these alternatives seems to me to be frankly preposterous ; the second involves only a slight straining of the figures.
There is no question of Etta’s reproductions being identical withthose of Leonard (RN 89-1)—they are, on the contrary, very significantly different (RN 89-2)—so that on the “ two contributors
”
theory advanced in the cases of John and Dora, we should expect to
find her reaction times significantly similar to Normal Leonard’s,which they are not (RN 74-1), and this is also contrary to RN 199.
On the theory that Etta is emancipated hi both respects, we shouldexpect to find her reaction times significantly different from those ofNormal Leonard, but agaui (RN 74-2) this is not true. We must con-clude that one part or other of RN 74 is in error, in the sense thatchance cttcumstances have conspned to conceal either a similarity or a difference. But the strong association found between RT andRPN (RN 197 already cited) practically compels the supposition that
14]] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 847
a single mind is at work, so that the minimum of distortion is in- volved in sup2)osing that RN 74-2 “ ought ” to show a significant
difference.
The view that Etta is somewhat more skilled at controlling the
medium than either John or Dora is also concordant with the history
other development, the amount of practice she has had and (so far as the former is concerned) with various indications derived by Mr
Drayton Thomas from a study of the responses given. I accordingly
adopt it provisionally pending further evidence.
32
We may summarise the outcome of the work to date as follows :
1 . The Besterman-Gatty experiment shows clearly that significant
difference between two personalities in respect of either RT or RPN,
or both, is not of itself—as I had first supposed—any evidence of their
autonomy.
2. The phenomenon of Countersimilarity is significantly associated
with Controls, but not with Communicators or with other types of
personality ; it implies a connection between the Controls and such
elements as are common to the personalities with which they are compared, which can most reasonably be explained by supposing that
the former are secondary ])ersonalities of the mediums with whom
they are associated.
3. As a general and very extensive rule, whenever we are dealing
with an evidently single ])ersonality, whether primary, secondary or a pose, we find a significant association between prolongation of
reaction time and disturbance in reproduction. In the cases of John
and Dora this is not found, although neither contribution can be
regarded as randomly determined. In each case one of the contributions is clearly made by the medium’s normal mind ; there is accordingly a strong suggestion that the other contribution comes from some extraneous source.
33
So small a list of conclusions drawn so laboriously from so great a mass of work suggests the extraction of radium from pitch-blende,
where some ten tons or so of material must l)e treated to produce a
milligram of the pure salt ; but it is to be hoped that they may be
correspondmgly efiicacious in strilving a few sparks of light from the
dull screen of our ignorance.
I have said that I regard the establishment (for so I consider it) of the status of Feda and Uvani as secondary personalities as a notable advance in positive knowledge. I will add that I think it an
348 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [partiin]>orta.iit ste]> toward sliowing (if it be a fact) that Coraimmicators«uch as John, Etta and Dora are, in some respect at least, what theypurport to be. It is never any use saying “ That was not a monkey because it hadnot got a tail,” unless you have established the possession of tails as a characteristic pro])erty of monkeys, and it is no use arguing thata Communicator is not a secondary personality, because it does notbehave like one, until yo\i have found out how secondary personalities do in fact behave.
I think we are now in a position to say firmly, “ John, Etta andDora are not secondary personahties because they do not show theproperty of countersimilarity to the other members of their group.”We could not do this before, because we knew of no property characteristic of secondary personalities by which to judge them. Thusthe decision that Feda and Uvani are secondaries is an essential preliminary to reasoned contention on these lines that John, Etta andDora are not. Spiritists will please note.
And in response to the very proper suggestion that the commmiicators are histrionic poses, we may plausibly enquire why it is thatthey do not in general show the association of reaction time and re- ]:>roduction which seems to Ije—as indeed we should expect—thehall-mark of a single and undivided personality, and is actuallyshown by the two Gatty poses ? ^ The last thing I wish is to be dogmatic here, for if there is onething that is quite certain it is that the whole story is enormouslymore complicated than I at first imagined. Still, I feel strongly thatthe facts just referred to deserve to be taken very seriously indeed byall who have not hopelessly prejudged the issues involved by decidmgthat discarnate influence is “ impossible.”
My own attitude is best indicated by continuing the quotationwith which this paper began : “ I have added a lot more, hut it was sea, not shy ; there’s a boat
floativg on the top of it.” Perhajos next time it will have turned out to he a parasol u'pside down. . . . The scientist has his guesses as to hoiv the
finished picture will work out ; he dejyends largely on these in his search
for other pieces to fit ; hut his guesses are modified from time to time by
unexpected develognnents as the fitting proceeds. . . . Those who look over his shoidder and iise the present partially developed pichirefor purposes outside science, do so at their own risk.
^ Possibly, also, the strong covariance shown by these (RN 16.3‘.3) may prove an additional distinguishing criterion.

recalculated throughout oii the lines indicated in section 2 ahove
and now include Individualities and Covariances in addition to the
Similarities and Differences originally given.
It will be remembered that the second of the original sittings was
partially unsuccessful, inasmuch as the attempt to obtain 100 reactions from each personality exhausted the “ power ” before reproductions could be obtained from J, or any reactions from E. Additional material was later obtained with a view to making good this
deficiency ; but in the interests of strict comparability I have
thought it best to use the data from sittings I and III to VI only for
computing S, D and C in all cases, though I have utilised—rather
arbitrarily perhaps—the additional material in working I for reaction
time throughout and for N, P and F in the case of reproductions.
Comparison with the figures given in Q.S.T.P., 1, which are now
superseded, will reveal various discrepancies. These are mainly due
to the modifications of treatment described in section 2 above, but a few actual errors were detected and remedied. These, however, do
not mvolve any reinterpretation and accordingly need not be further
particularised.
35
The Irving Experiment. This consisted of five sittings conducted
by Mr Irving on September 13, 15, 17, 18 and 20, 1934, at which data were collected from “Prepared Leonard,” “Feda,”and “Dora.” Mrs
Leonard in her fully normal state had previously been tested on August 13, 18, 20, 23 and 27 by Mr W. H. Wilson, to whom I am
again much indebted for his help in this matter.
A list of 100 words was used throughout. In this list no word was
used which appeared in the original list used for the Garrett and first Thomas Experiments, but it was derived from this by substituting
for each word some other which seemed likely to lie fairly closely
associated with it. For examjile : Old List New List

[partI hoped ill tliis way to lie aide to ensure comparability by restricting the field of ojierations to approximately the same groups of ideas,while avoiding the effects of “ staleness ” due to too frequent a re-petition of the list. I rather expected to find a fair measure of similarity between thereactions to the two lists for the same personality ; but in this I wasdisappomted, as reference to RN 129 to 134 will show. The point,however, is of academic interest only and not relevant to the mamissues which interest us here.
The results obtained were extraorduiarily good—far superior inprecision and “ clear-cutness ” to those of the first Thomas experiment, with which they may most fairly be compared.
This is evident by inspection of the relevant portions of Table II,but it is interesting to note that significant results (takmg P = -01 asthe criterion) are significantly more frequent in the Irving than in thefirst Thomas experiment. Thus we have

The inqirovement may be partly due to greater familiarity withthe technique on the part of N, P and F, but I think it must beascribed mainly to the relatively small intervals between sittings—apoint worth bearing in mind for future guidance.

Note on Rudi and OJga. In Q.S.T.P., I, p. 189, 1 commented some-what unfavourably onRudi’s tendency to react with words apparentlydetermined not by the stimulus word j ust given but by that immediately preceding it or removed by only one or two places in the hst.I think I ought in fairness to say that the same tendency is to beobserved in Prepared Leonard (a fact which I had not previouslyremarked), while Rudi’s very low values of I for reaction time(RN 1 43, 144 and compare 44, 45, 46) support the view that althoughostensibly normal he was actually in the lightly dissociated statewhich seems to be characteristic of P,
On the other hand, I see no reason for supposing and much fordoubting that Olga is even a Control, still less a Communicator, hi thesense in which the terms are used here. On the whole, it seems to meprobable that Olga represents a kind of semi-dream state of which
141] The. Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 351
Rudi may retain vague and fragmentary memories. This view,
which would more or less imply a condition of doubt on Rudi’s part
as to what happened in the trance state and who was resj)onsible for
it, would account for his evident apprehensiveness on the subject of
fraud and exposure without requiring us to postulate deliberate nmla
fdes in the ordinary sense.
37
The Psycho-galvanic Reflex. This phenomenon, of which, on the
basis of earlier experience, I expected great things when I started
this work, has proved definitely disappointing as an instrument of
research. It has been found almost impossible to obtain from any
subject (except Rudi and Olga) a compact and gapless block of
readings of reasonable size such as is required for statistical analysis.
This involves resorting to a variety of expedients and artifices, such
as the use of “ 1 or 0 ” methods, which seriously reduce the value of
the results obtained.
At first I thought that physico-physiological causes, such as
polarisation at the electrodes, were to blame, but it now seems fairly
clear that purely psychological factors—notably boredxnn—are
chiefly responsible. Mr Glatty came to substantially this conclusion —largely, I gather, on introspective grounds ; while it is shared, I understand, by Mr J. C. Maby, who has done much work with the
reflex under a variety of conditions.
The view is perhaps a trifle difficult to reconcile with the almost
uniform success of my experiments in 1920-21, though the differ- ences in the type of person examined may be an important factor
here ; on the other hand, it receives a certain support from the behaviour of Rudi and Olga, whose relatively high performance may be
attributed to their being kept well keyed up, as it were, by the
periodical stimulation of the “ suspicion words.”
Further work on the reflex is clearly desirable, with special refer- ence to the question of whether countersimilarity is shown by it, and
it seems likely that this can better be studied by using short lists of
words on numerous occasions and at short intervals rather than by a few experiments with long lists.
38
Influence of the Sitter. We hear so much m the literature of
psychical research about “ telepathy from the sitter ” that it seemed worth while attempting to ascertain whether there was any
appreciable similarity between the reactions given by Mr Drayton
2a
352 Whatehj Garhigton, M.A., M.Sc. [pabtTliomas ami Mr Irving and those obtained from the personalitieswhom they tested.
This did not occur to me till after the first series of experimentshad been completed ; consequently Mr Drayton Thomas’s reactionswere not collected until he himself had repeated the lists ad nauseamin the course of collecting data. Mr Irving, on the other hand, wastested not only Ijefore he conducted his experiments, but before hehad seen the test words at all. This was done by Mr J. W. Harrison,of Newent, to whom I am greatly obliged for the trouble taken inthe matter.
It will be seen by reference to Table II (RN 81 to 85 ; 96 to 100 ; 119 to 122), that there is no appreciable similarity whatever betweenMr Irving and Dora, or between Mr Drayton Thomas and John andEtta.
I do not know what effects telepathy (assuming this to be a factat all) may produce in other contexts, but there is certainly no excusefor attributing to it the phenomena described in this paper ; whileone cannot help feelmg that, if it were so potent a cause as is oftenclaimed in other connections, some reasonable measure of similaritywould have been found here.
But ardent spiritists should note that any construing of this re-mark into the sense of “ telepathy hypothesis disproved,” or the lilm,would constitute a gross and unwarrantable perversion of what Ihave said.
39
Computation of Mr Hereward Carrington’s Data. It seemed to meunfortunate that the nvimerous flowers of fact so laboriously gatheredby Mr and Mrs Carrmgton should Ije allowed to waste their sweetnesson the desert air when a little instructed distillation would ensuretheir jjerfume being preserved for posterity. I accordingly decidedto a])ply ap])ropriate methods to as much as possible of the publishedmaterial.
As it ha])pens, Mr Carrington’s data proved, in a way, pecidiarlysuitable for this purpose, because, although they were of so fragmentary a character that few yielded an intrinsically reliable result,yet the net had Ijeen so widely spread that a relatively large numberof results (54 in all) could be calculated of which the sign was observable. From these, as explauied in section 20 above, it is possible toconclude with reasonable assurance that countersimilarity occurswith Uvani as well as with Feda.
Mr Carrington’s observations have thus provided an invaluablecontribution to the material available for analysis.

Experiment with Mrs Salter. This constitutes a kind of digression
from the main course of the work, and was imdertaken mainly be- cause it was felt that it would be interesting, on general grounds, to
see whether the method was capable of showing appreciable differences between the normal state and that in which automatic
writing, as opposed to full-blooded mediumship, occurs. The results obtained (Table III, RN 141, 142, 148, 149, 159, 162) are chiefly remarkable for the fact that they are unique among those
hitherto collected in showing significant similarity and significant
difference in respect of both reaction time and reproduction. This,
of course, is what “ ought ” to be observed in every case in which any
considerable change takes place yet leaves the roots of the mdividual
imimpaired. Usually, however, instabihty and restlessness introduce
so much error that the effects are obscured ; whereas Mrs Salter is so constant in either state as to constitute a veritable model of statistical
propriety.
The psychological status of the “ automatic ” condition is not easy
to assess precisely in the existing state of our knowledge. It shows
no trace of countersimilarity, and there is a strong association between reaction time and reproduction (RN 187), while generally
speaking—and especially in the strong covariance in reproduction

the relationship between the two states seems to resemble that between the two Gatty poses more closely than anything else available
for comparison.
Very tentatively, I should regard it as a kind of “ fantasy ” condition—midway, perhaps, between a pose and a dream—rather than as a Control or Communicator m embryo.
Part V
Interim Note : Apparent Autonomy of John and Etta
Since writing the above, I have had the opportunity of comparing
certain data obtained by Mr Drayton Thomas in sittings with Mrs
Sharplin with the figures of the original Leonard sittings.
At these Sharphn sittmgs, John and Etta purported to take
control and were tested on three occasions each with the first fifty
words of my first list. Mrs Sharplin herself was similarly tested on two occasions only. The experiment is accordingly on a small scale
and not to be regarded as more than exploratory. None the less the
results are very remarkable.
354 Whately Caringtnn, M.A., M.Se. [PAETThe vital question here, of course, is whether the J and E manifesting through Mrs Shar])lin show any signs of a non-chancercsemhlance to tlie J and manifesting through Mrs Leonard.
The actual similarities are :
Reaction Times Reproductions
z P ?• JJ - -0845 -275 -0843
EE - -1892 -095 -1832
z P r •0965 -250 -0962
•1997 -080 -1973
Here z is the familiar “ similarity z ” and P, as usual, the probability of obtaining a value of this magnitude and sign by chancealone, while r is the corresponding correlation coefficient obtainedfrom z by Professor Fisher’s transformation
r = (e23_ l)/(e2« +1).
There is naturally no reason, a priori, why the two J’s or the twoE’s should show a positive rather than a negative correlation in
respect of either RT or RPN and the fact that all four coefficientsare positive indicates fairly strongly that a non-chance cause is atwork.
We naturally suspect similarity between the mediums, sincepersonalities similar to similar personalities would be likely to besimilar to each other.
The similarity between Normal Leonard and Sharplin is, in fact,
distinctly high, for we have
Reaction Times Reproductions
z P )• z P r LS - -2972 -020 -2888 -2262 -055 -2225
I think we can eliminate the effect of this similarity by the methodof partial correlation. Writing, in each case, 1 for the Leonardversion of the communicator concerned, 2 for the Sharplin version,
3 for Leonard and 4 for Sharplin, we apply the usual formula
^ ab ^ac^bc
' ab-C
in which stands for “ the coefficient of correlation between aand 1) after eliminating the influence of c ” and calculate successivelyrj 2

. From these, by again using the same formula,we obtain rj 2

eliminating the influence of the similarity between Leonard andSharplin.

the P’s being calculated from the correspondmg values of z' with
two fewer degrees of freedom to allow for the two variables eliminated.
As is to be expected, all these values of r' are somewhat less than
the original values of r ; but all are positive and, from the statistical
point of view, the personalities and tests appear to be independent.
It accordmgly seems legitimate to take the continued product of the
values of P as giving the overall chance of the observed similarities
of J with J and E with E in the two tests being fortuitous.
This product is -0014, so that the chance of fortuitous occurrence
is no more than about one in 714.
It is interesting to note that Etta is again distinctly the better
performer (cf. section 31 above).
If the procedure be admitted valid, I see no escape (or, strictly,
only one in 714) from the conclusion that non-chance, non-Leonard,
non-Sharplin factors are at work behind the scene, and from this it
is but a trifling step to supposing that these factors are what they
claim to be—namely “ John ” m the one case and “ Etta ” in the
other—or just possibly a kind of joint personality combining the two.
The only alternative would be to suppose that Mrs Sharplin has
contrived to impersonate the Leonard Communicators, not as regards words and behaviour (where the resemblance, I understand,
was definitely poor) but in hesitations on particular words and
failures to reproduce particular replies. Personally, I should regard
this as far more fantastic than the straight paranormal interpretation, and I have httle doubt that most others would do so too. On the other hand, while I pubhsh these results as a matter of the
utmost general uiterest, I do so with very great reserve. I must
confess to some surprise at obtaining so well-marked an mdication
so easily, and although I can detect no flaw in the argument at
present, I should not be too surprised if one were to be discovered,
or if the more extended experiments now planned were to fail to
confirm the result.
So I venture to uisist that nothing I have said here is to be used
in evidence agamst me later, pending confirmation or the reverse. At the same time, if there is no hidden pitfall in the work, it would
appear to constitute the strongest objective evidence in favour of
the autonomy of communicators that has yet been obtained.

GLOSSARY
Psycho-galvanic Reflex (PGR)—The change in the apparent electrical resistance of the subject’s skin which accompanies the act ofreplymg to a stimulus word. Measured with a Wheatstone bridgeand galvanometer.
Reaction Time (RT)—The time which elapses between the experimenter calling out the stimulus word and the subject replying.Measured with a stop-watch in fifths of a second.
Rejjrodmtion Test (RPN)- - When the list has been called through,the experimenter repeats it, asking the subject to give the samereplies as before, if possible. Failure to do so, or great delay, constitutes a “ disturbance in reproduction.”
Similarity (S)—The degree of likeness between the reactions givenby any two personalities obtamed, by a process equivalent tocorrelation, from the total reaction times, etc., for the various wordsof the list on all occasions. The z of this procedure can be transformed into the r of correlation by the formula
2 = Mlog( 1 -f r) - log(l - r)}.
Difference (D)—The differences between the total times, etc.,given by the two personalities in response to the different words arecompared with their error, as shown by their occasion-to-occasionvariability to see whether it is attributable to chance.
Covariance (C)—The extent to which the personalities varysimilarly, from occasion to occasion, m respect of each word, is compared with the corresponding error and the results pooled for allwords. Cf. p. 321.
Individuality (I) —The differences between the total reactiontimes, etc., for a smgle personality, in response to the various words,are coni])ared with the occasion-to-occasion variability to see whetherthe consistency of such differences is greater than the error.

NOTE ON ME CAEINGTON’S INVESTIGATION
By J. Cecil Maby, B.Sc., A.E.C.S.
Having studied with the greatest interest Mr Whately Carington’stwo papers on the Quantitative Analysis of Trance Personalities, aswell as having been so fortunate as to correspond with Mr Caringtonand Mr Drayton Thomas (as chief observer in the Leonard sittings),and to be permitted to examine some of the word-response and re-action-time sheets, I should like to make a few friendly queries andsuggestions regarding the actual data and experimental techniqueemployed in this work. Nor am I, it appears, alone in this matter,judging from discussions that I have had with several other gentlemen in a position fairly to evaluate the experimental aspect of theinvestigation.
It was at once evident that such an enquiry would both attractgeneral psychological attention and carry considerable weight. Itwas equally evident, however, that, no matter how infalhbly andscrupulously the data were manipulated mathematically, there werebound to exist certain problematical issues, upon both the psychoanalytical and experimental sides, that would require very carefulconsideration before final deductions might quite safely be made byquantitative analyses. Such a consideration is the aim of the presentnote.
It so ha|)pened that I, myself, had for several years been engagedin psychoanalytical problems and experimental methods nearlycoincident with those here in question, but employing “ normal ”everyday subjects, picked at random—of various ages and both sexes—rather than trance personalities. On the publication of Mr Carington’s first paper, therefore, I decided at once to repeat his wordassociation tests, with reaction times and psychogalvanic reflexes,on several suph normal subjects. The results of these experimentscannot—as space is limited—be given here, but I may say that theysufficed to confirm certain doubts that I felt already as to the possiblevalue of the emphical data used by Mr Carington in his analyses ofthe trance personalities. His reassurance on these heads wouldtherefore be welcome.
(1) In order to exclude telepathy—a highly probable affair underthe circumstances—between the operator and the subject, thestimulus words should preferably be printed on white cards,362
[part 141 ] Note on Mr Carinrjtov's Investigation 363
shuffled (face down) by the operator, and presented one at a time to
the view of the subject, in a standardised manner, so that the operator
himself is unaware of the word under presentation d The subject’s
reply would then be unbiased by any idea in the operator’s mind, unless, indeed, the operator were also a good clairvoyant—which, I believe, he was not in the present case, especially under the foreconscious preoccupation of the tests. In the present instance the subject’s eyes were closed, so that some
other mechanical method would have to be adopted. Nevertheless,
the point is a most important one.
(2) Mr Carington was not, I gather, himself present or acting as operator at the various sittings ; the actual observations having
been made by Messrs Besterman, Drayton Thomas, and others.
Whatever the reason for this procedure, and no matter how expert
and scrupulous the actual operators may have been, one feels that
Mr Carington would have further benefited, as regards detailed
knowledge of the circumstances attending each sitting and the
individual reactions, by himself being present at the tests. Experience with far less complex cases has long taught me this vital
necessity.
(3) The psychogalvanic reflex is fraught with great difficulties ; and, granted -a smoothly working apparatus, a steady and also re- sponsive ^ subject, an experienced operator (who must also interpret
and sift the data as they accumulate), this reflex still remains insufficiently understood in all its complex significance to be employed
in any routine tests, and upon such difficult psychological subjects.
I say this with all deference to Mr Carington’s own long experience
of the psychogalvanic reflex, in view of general and personal experi- ence of the reaction. Mr Carington himself has also admitted, in
correspondence, that this approach is a difficult and unreliable one. Even the most responsive subjects rapidly become “ bored,” emotionally speaking, so that their reflexes tend to fall off progressively,
both throughout a single recitation of a word Ust (or other series of
monotonous stimuli) and also from sitting to sitting—even if separated by days or weeks. ^ The effect is greatest at first and
^ It is easy to make a mechaiiical device for doing this, which can be clamped
on the front edge of the operator’s table or desk. Stop-watch timing is done as
usual.
^ As a rule, the more responsive the less steady the subject is, and conversely.
Hence the practical impossibility of rehable routine observations on a suitably
sensitive subject.
® By taking the mean galvanic reflex or mean reaction time in verbal re- sponse for a given word list, a very perfect “ mental facilitation ” curve may
be obtained. The writer hopes, shortly, to pubUsh an account of such tests in a psychologicalj ournal
.
364 J. Cecil Maby, B.Sc., A.R.C.S. [partrapidly declines in a given sitting. Wechsler and Jones (see pp. 223-4of W. W. C.’s first paper) appear to be justified in their statement,that position in a serial list is of considerable importance. There isno cut and dried “ starting effect.” Thus, sooner or later, one is leftwith no reflexes at all, or, if present, they can be shown to be theresult almost entirely of the mere neuro-muscular effort of articulated word response, and are hence quite small, and all almostequal in magnitude ; while all emotional or “ meaning ” content islacking, except in connection with one or two words only from sucha list. The few values for p.g. reflexes given by Mr Carington for MrsGarrett and Herr Rudi Schneider strongly suggest, by theirsmallness, that such reflexes were mainly due to articulationand not to emotional significance. If the former, they wouldhave occurred some 2 secs, after the spoken response (not thestimulus word), and would have ceased if the spoken response weresuppressed.
Personally I always mistrust and discount such small reflexeswhen working at high instrumental sensitivity.
(4) A change of mood in the operator, a change of operator, oreven an accidental change of tone, clarity or sharpness in theenunciation of a given stimulus word would (I find from actual tests)considerably modify the resultant reaction times or p.g. reflexes.Since all these variable factors clearly entered into the presenttests, the numerical values obtained will undoubtedly be disturbedaccordingly, and hence rendered of questionable value. Such a stateof affairs is suggested by the variability of the actual values in con-nection with any given word. {See below.)
In so far as these changes are apt to modify the reaction valuessteadily in one direction or the other (in normal subjects), statisticalanalysis of the data should not mask the effects ; it can also minimise errors about a mean. But although such a method permits usto draw such conclusions as are quantitatively possible, systematicerror will not be evaded. As I suggested with regard to the possibletelepathic factor, it would be desirable to make such valuableinvestigations as criticism-proof as possible : —and it is only for suchreasons that the present Note has been submitted, I need hardlyremark.
(5) Brief study of the word reaction times for the Leonard groupof personalities showed the followmg important points, to which Ido not recollect Mr Carington having called attention :
(a) The trance personalities gave reaction times too high fornormality or reliability, as compared with any of my ordinary subjects, tested on the same word list.
365 141] Note on Mr CaringtoNs Investigation
E.g. these approx, values : Ln - l"-2—2"-8 (mean l"-75)
Lp - 2"-l—7"-l (mean 3"-95)
F - 2"-5—7"-8 (mean 4"-20)
Cf. my normal subjects, who gave between 0"-5 and 3"-0 (mean
l"-2). Note the resemblance between Lp and F, and great difference
from Ln—as also indicated by my actual word analyses [see below)
and Mr Carington’s quantitative investigation. Note also that Ln
gave the most normal reaction times, and most normally distrilmted.
{b) The reaction times in connection with any particular stimulus
word were extremely variable—far too much so for normal straightforward response, which is generally under 3" at hmit—or else no
answer at all—and relatively constant from sitting to sitting with
respect to each given word.
Either (1) Special retardation owing to the trance state,
(2) Wandering of thought from the natural reflex replies, or
(3) Conscious dehberation of a suitable answer is here implied, I think.
(c) The mean reaction time (for all words) on any given occasion
often varied markedly frotn one personality to another, but was
reasonably consistent for each personality individually, it seemed.
These divergences were far greater than for any normal subject
in a variety of moods, states and conditions, and often varied m a
rather extreme manner as compared with 20-30% changes under
extreme circumstances for a normal subject, according to my data.
This mutually distinctive character (as to mean time) between the
various personalities ^ would appear to be a signiflcant point
physiologically incomprehensible, unless the whole organism of the
medium be supposed to change with each assumed personality.
Mr Carington, in the process of his statistical method, by taking
the mean of the lot for each personality, and then subtracting each
individual word-value from that mean, etc., would surely eliminate
such detailed inter-personal distinction—reducing them all to a common basic level. This is one of the points that Mr Dra}don
Thomas wished, I believe, to make after the reading of Mr Carington’s second paper, but which was not quite clearly understood at
the time. Perhaps Mr Carington will kindly elucidate the point.
Such are the chief points upon which I personally—and I believe
others amongst his readers—would value a further explanation from
^ The resemblance as to mean time between Lp and F, noted above, is due
to averaging out the values for all sittings, en masse, and does not controvert
the distmction here noted.

!
Mr Carington, and which I do not doubt that he will be in a positionto supply. ' For the rest, I shoidd add that an unbiased examination of theactual word responses and reaction times of the Leonard groupisuggested to me, as to Mr Drayton Thomas, that the several per-\sonalities behaved in a remarkably self-distinctive manner. But a; |psychoanalysis of the reaction words (results and figures held over‘
for the time) certainly hinted—as Mr Carington now concludes
that Feda might be a secondary sub-personality of Mrs Leonardherself. Otherwise, Messrs Carington’s and Drayton Thomas’smitial results were, in general, confirmed, so far as I could arrive atany fair conclusions by that rather micertam method.
REPLY TO MR MARY’S NOTE
Mr Maby does not indicate a single numerical result or interpretative
conclusion with which he disagrees, so I take it that he just wants
to tell us how much better it would have been if I had done it all differently.
The only thing he seems sure about is that my data are of imperfect relrabihty. He is perfectly right ; but he does not seem to
realise that the whole purpose of statistical treatment is to enable one to draw, if and in so far as it is possible, reliable conclusions
from data which are individually susceptible to error ; while the
tests of significance freely used ui this work, without which statistics are practically worthless, tell us precisely how far we have succeeded
and just how reliable our result is. I have given, I think, three hundred and thirty-six numerical
results of one kind and another in the Tables and text of Q.S.T.P. II and every single one of these has a probability attached to it, telling
the reader just what the chance is of its being due to the unreliability {alias “
error ”) which Mr Maby postulates. I can do no
more. That is my total answer to the whole “ unreliability ” story ; and
if it is considerably my misfortmie, it is in no degree my fault, if Mr Maby (or others) are insufficiently acquainted with modern
statistical theory and practice to appreciate it. But I shall always
be most willing to learn from those who know the subject.
As regards specific points :
1. Telepathy
:
Who is supposed to have telepathed what to
whom ? What feature of which result is due to this, and how did the
telepathing cause it ? Until I am told this, I cannot reply ; meanwhile, the available
evidence {Q.S.T.P. II 38) suggests that telepathy was absent.
2. My own absence from sittitigs : I do not agree. The experiments are behaviouristic, not psycho-analytical, and one of their
chief aims has been to secure objectivity by eliminating personal
judgments.
Is it suggested {a) that if I had been present I would have recorded
times, words or reproductions other than those actually given, or
(b) that Mr Drayton Thomas, Mr Besterman or Mr Irving did so, or (c) that I would have faked the calculations into conformity
with my impressions ? 2 B 367
368 Whaiely Carington, 31.A., 31. Sc. [part3. Psycho-galvanic reflex : Tliis has admittedly been disappointing{Q.S.T.P. II, 37) so I have dejjended on it very little. Mr Maby ignores totally the figures given by me in my commenton Wechsler and Jones {loc. cit.) and is necessarily unaware that I have applied a correction in all cases to deal with the effect hementions. (Q.S.T.P. II, "lb.) In the case of Rudi and Olga, statistically significant similarities were obtained (RN 154, 155) which shows that the data were prettygood—as inspection indicated. (Cf. Q.S.T.P. I, 15.)
My only other conclusion, namely that countersimilarity probablyextends to the reflex, is quite tentative. (Q.S.T.P. II, 26.)
With which of these conclusions does Mr Maby disagree ? Ifwith the first, how does he explain the significant residt, in spite ofthe correction for “ fatigue ” ? If with the second, would he ratherdraw a tentative conclusion opposed to the evidence than one in
accordance with it, as I do ?
4. Variability of operator, etc., etc. : The beauty of the techniqueknown as the Analysis of Variance, which I used in this work, lies in
the fact that—as its name implies—it permits one to analyse thetotal variability of the data into its component parts and to ascribeto each of the headings under which the material is classified its proper share of this. Whatever is not so ascribable constitutesError—which may, indeed, be defined, for statistical purposes, asthe results of all causes which we cannot identify or in which we arenot interested.
Thus, in so far as the factors mentioned by Mr Maby are constantfor a given word, personality or occasion, they enter (as is proper)into the calculated quantities concerned with these ; but in so faras they are not constant they enter into the quantity OWP (see myfirst paper. Appendix II) which constitutes Error and is used as a“ yard stick ” to test whether observed differences are significant ornot. The obtaining of a significant difference is automatically aguarantee that the error (howsoever occasioned) is statistically smallcompared with the difference observed. 3Iutatis mutandis, similarconsiderations apply to similarities, etc. The latter part of this section (“ In so far as . . . not be evaded.”)almost completely defeats me, but I think it is covered by what I have just said. In so far as “ these changes . . . modify the . . . values . . . steadily ” they will be sorted out by the analysis undertheir proper headings and eliminated ; in so far as they do sounsteadily they will automatically appear as Error—which is justwhat one wants.
The technique employed is, I fear, a little more advanced thanminimising “ errors about a mean ”
; but the drawing of “ such
141 ] Beply to Mr Mahy’’f< Note 3cn
conclusions as are quantitatively possible ” is, of course, exactly
what it claims to do- -neither more nor less—except for adding a statement of their value.
As regards the “ systematic error ” : Does Mr Maby suggest that
the experimenter has contrived to vary his “ tone, clarity or sharpness,” etc., systematically with respect to a combination of personality and word ; and, if so, what reason has he for supposing
this ? If not, I fear I must baldly assert that every other sort of
systematic error ivill be eliminated ; those who doubt this must
study the technique for themselves.
Similar considerations apply to most of Mr Maby’s section 6,
throughout which—as in the last—he seeks to override calculation
by inspection.
I am only too pleased, of course, to concede the obvious point that
trance personalities and Prepared Leonard are much slower in re- sponse than normal persons (or even Normal Leonard—herself,
perhaps, a trifle slow). This is of some general interest but irrele- vant to the question of identity. But to say that the times are too
long “ for reliability ” is demonstrably false. I must repeat

ad
nauseam, I fear—that if the data were “ unreliable ” thev could not
yield significant results, except by the inclusion of freak values which
the process of “ scaling ” removes. (Q.S.T.P. II, 2a.) Direct evidence on the point is added by the figures for “ Individuality ” in my
second paper (notably RN 42 to 70), which are obtained by comparing
the inter-word differences for the various personalities with their
sitting-to-sitting variations. These flatly refute Mr Maby’s contention.
{N.B. Prepared Leonard is admittedly not reliable—as noted in
the text—but the other personalities are satisfactory, with rare exceptions.)
As regards 5a : It would be mildly interesting if it could be shown
that Etta, say, gave consistently (to a non-chance extent) longer
times than Feda or John, and that this could not be ascribed to
fatigue {cf. my first paper, p. 236, note 37). Unfortunately, we are not so situated, and a whole new series of experiments would be
necessary to clear up the point. At best, however, it would be rather
like trying to identify individuals by their weight alone to the
exclusion of all other anthropometrical data. The possible existence
of detailed inter-personal distinctions is, of course, the whole motive
for analysing with respect to the different words. I strongly suspect
that Mr Maby has not merely missed this point, but completely
failed to understand the nature of the quantities calculated.
As a matter of interest, I have just made an ad hoc test to see whether there is any indication that the mean time for Feda is
370 Wha.tely Carington, M.A., M.Se. [part 141]
significantly greater than tliat for Etta, using the figures given in
the above-cited note. The chance of these figures differing fortuitously to the extent they do, having regard to the observed variation
from occasion to occasion, is about -275. In other words, the dif- ference is very far from significant, even if we ignore the effect offatigue, which the figures so strongly suggest.
There is accordingly no justification (since this difference is thelargest observed between trance personalities in this experiment)for claiming that the overall mean time is in any way distinctively
characteristic of the (trance) personality, though slow response is clearly a characteristic of the trance state as such.
In conclusion : There is any amomit of error in the data ; thatis the reason, and the only reason, why we use statistical methodsat all. These would be altogether unnecessary if the errors ofmeasurement were known to be small compared with the quantities
in which we are interested—as, usually, in weighing cheese for
mouse-traps. But statistical methods may be worse than useless
unless they not only give us the best estimate obtainable from thedata of the quantities which concern us but also tell us what theseestimates are worth, i.e. what is the chance that they have beenspuriously generated by the error in question.
Thanks to the ingenuity of professional statisticians, this is exactly what is done by the methods here employed ; they give usthe best available estimate and add a measure of its reliability basedon the amount of error actually found in the data used. Anyone whoimagines that any process whatsoever, statistical or otherwise, cando more than this cherishes an illusion ; in fact, any process oftreating measurements which does not include a test of significance
necessarily does less. The matter is one on which the enquirer may reasonably bereferred to text-books on statistics rather than to the Proceedings ofthis Society, and I certainly do not feel called upon to demonstrateit stej) by step—apart from the fact that I am very doubtfullycapable of doing so. But as regards the validity of the results I have])ublished the position is very simple : To the question “ Are your data reliable ? ” I reply “Not altogether,” and if asked, “ To what extent does the unreliability vitiate
your results ? ” I answer “ Precisely to the extent indicated by thevalue of P which I have carefully attached to each of them. Idcirco
genueram.”

THE WOKD ASSOCIATION EXPERIMENT WITH
MRS OSBORNE LEONARD
By C. Drayton Thomas
The Response Words, showing characteristic reactions of Feda,
John, Etta, Leonard.
The Responses Considered Numerically : Similarities and Differences.
What the Figures Indicate.
In a recent paper entitled The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities {Proc. S.P.R., July 1934) and in a second paper printed above,
Mr Whately Carington describes and discusses a series of experiments in the association of words, some of which I conducted under
his guidance and at his suggestion with Mrs Osborne Leonard in the
winter of 1933-34.
Those papers deal with figures. I am about to discuss the actual
reply words given by the various personalities.
The course of the experiment was as follows : A list of 75 words prepared by Mr Carington was used at each of
six sittings. At each sitting I first read the list to Mrs Leonard before
she went into trance and wrote down her response to each successive
word. When the fist was ended I immediately went through it again,
making a note whenever Mrs Leonard gave a reply identical with
that given previously. I ignored all other replies that she made.
This second reading of the fist is termed the Reproduction Test.
Mrs Leonard’s replies at this stage are shown as the responses of
Lp (Leonard prepared), because Mrs Leonard’s mind may have been
in some manner affected by her preparations for the sittuig.
Having completed this, I waited until Mrs Leonard was in trance
and then repeated the above procedure with Feda. On finishing
with Feda I did the same with John and then with Etta as they in
turn took personal control. The exact time for each reaction was
taken by stop-watch. Those reaction times do not affect the questions here to be considered and they are fully dealt with by Mr
Carington.
When the above six sittings were over I arranged with Mrs
Leonard that she should allow me to go through the 76 words with
her at a time removed by hours, or by days, from my sittings. This was for the purpose of ascertaining whether there would be any
371
372 C. Drayton Thomas [partmarked difference between her reactions when she was about to give a sitting and those taken when she was in the midst of householdoccupations and therefore, presumably, in a state of mind entirely
normal. Her replies on these six later occasions are shown as the
responses of Ln (Leonard normal). In addition to the 75 wordssix times repeated, we tried a short list of 50 further words and the
present study of reaction words is based on replies to both lists. When later in this paper I come to the counting of similarities anddifferences the longer list alone will be used.
A long experience with Mrs Leonard led me to expect results of
value and I was curious to see how far the personalities would retain
their individual characteristics when bombarded with stimulus
words, each of which was virtually an inquiry into their experience,
memory and predilections. It had long been my wish to discover
some means of ascertaining the extent to which a communicator’s
conversation was influenced by its passage through the medium’smind, or, to express it differently, to ascertain what proportion of a medium’s mentality mingled with that of the communicator during
a sitting. It had always seemed to me that while the communicator supplied
the thought, the form of its expression depended largely upon the
verbal furnishing of the medium’s mind. Was the result two-thirds
communicator and one-third medium, or, if the proportion varied
according to circumstances, what was the average infiltration from
3Irs Leonard while my communicators were sjieaking ? The j3roposed experiment might perhaps show statistically to
what extent communicators are able to remain isolated from the
medium, and, conversely, what degree of mental osmosis takes place
during a sitting. It will be observed that I assume the reality of communication
with departed friends. Yet, although this may have made my part
in the experiment more easy, it neither influences my presentation of
the results nor lessens the force of the emerging facts.

A glance at the above gives a fair impression of what was taking
place through the whole experiment. There is a small duplication
of the same reaction word by two personalities, but much greater
is the repetition by the same personality of a word previously given.
The number of these duplications and repetitions will be given in the
second part of this paper.
The effect of Feda’s reactions, given with her usual animation, was
heightened by asides and explanations. Unfortunately pressure of
time compelled me to discourage these. They certainly added to the
picturesqueness of the reactions, the Oriental atmosphere of which
will be noticed in the following examples :

Here are some of the asides made by Feda on giving her reactions : Drive-Purdah : “ When you are in purdah you wants to go for a
drive and you can’t.”
Bet-Anna : “I don’t like bets, and you don’t want to use more than
one anna, that’s quite enough for a bet.”
Sleep-Heavy : “ Pipes, you know, when you smoke pipes.”
Land : “I have not got a word for that. It doesn’t interest Feda.
Gladys is always thinking of it. You see, I doesn’t like land,
much land isn’t interesting.”
376 G. Drayton Thomas [partMrs Leonard had lately bought land at Tankerton and wasbuilding there.
Door-Curtain : “ Nicer than a door.”
Bring-kSalver : Not understanding this owing to unusual pronunciation, I asked Feda to repeat. She gave the same word. I thenasked what it meant. She replied thus, “We brings it ; beatencopper or brass or silver. Beaten silver is nicest. We hadbeaten brass most. When a slave brings you a letter he bringsit on a salver.”
Wicked- Gaekwar ; Not being sure I heard aright, I asked its meaning.Feda said, “ A man. He was a naughty man.”
Yellow-Roof : “ Near where I lived there was one with a bright goldroof.”
Noise-Drums ; “You would never forget them if you had heardthem as Feda has.”
Broud-Warrior : “ He is proud, yes he is very proud.”
Fray-Mat ; “ That is what you always have to pray on, a nice little mat.”
Bath-Jade ; “ Princes has them.”
Hill-Himalaya : “ The only hill I ever knew.”
Town-Simla : “ Yes, I was born there, when I was young I heard alot about it. I don’t know the town but a place near there.”
Call-Eunuch : (Claps hands) “ You clap and they have got to come.”Kiss-Noses : (Why do yon say that, Feda ?) “ Because I have heardof somebody that does it. Black people does it, we do not do it, we aren’t coloured people, we are only brown.”
Pool-Drown : “ That’s better than drowning people in the wells ! ”Veil-Yashmak : “ It is what you puts in front of your face.”
Sing-Samisen : “It is what you sings to. When you sings you playsa samisen, and yon go tinka, tinlva, tink—like that.”
Dead-Pyre : “ We should not be put on it now. It was stupid.Some of the widows that was put on the pyre was nicer than theman who died. But they didn’t want to go—some of themdidn’t.”
Book-Tablet ; “ They used to make books of tablets. We used tohave some kind of stuff like ivory.”
Bmy-Serf : “ You buries them and not bother about them much.”Wicked-Hyderabad : “ He was a very nasty man. Poisoned.”
As I was uncertain about some things implied in the foregoing, I questioned an Indian student and also an Fnglishman long residentin India. Their replies are hero given.
Eunuch. “ In wealthy Mohamedan houses eunuchs used to beemployed about a hundred years ago. I have seen some of them
141 ] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 377
going about, but do not know wbat they do. They are generally
considered by the average man as objects of pity.”
Slaves. “ The idea of slaves came to India with the Mohaniedan
invasion. Even when slaves were being used, only the rich Mohaniedans used to have them. Slaves were never common in India.”
Drums. “ Drums are played on practically every occasion among
the lower middle class people, in marriages or special festivities and
sometimes before a funeral procession.”
Tablets for writing. “ I do not know if, or when, paper superseded
tablets. Bark was used in early centuries, and palm leaves are still written upon in the villages.”
Mud buildings. “ Even now a good many houses in small villages are built of mud ; a brick house with tiles is a luxury except in fairly
large towns.”
Prayer Mats. “ Among Mohamedans the mat consists of an ordinary cloth. The Hindus use either a mat or sometimes a skin.”
Blessing water. “ Yes, there is a custom of blessing water.”
Mule. “ The mule is used for carrying loads only and so is kept in
the stables of rich people. I have rarely seen it. Ordinary people
employ horses or bullocks.”
Painting fingers and toes. “ This is a common custom in India
and has been for ages.”
Salver. “ A tray, not necessarily large, is commonly used in great
houses by servants to bring letters or visiting cards. But this
custom is observed only in very rich houses, especially among the
Mohamedans.”
I asked whether there was in India anything corresponding to the
African Witch Doctor, and if so, whether the terms would be interchangeable among country folk. “Yes, but in very remote parts and smallest villages. He is not
so important as in Africa. The Witch Doctor and Black Magician
are almost interchangeable terms among the country folks.”
Samisen. The meaning of this word is unknown to me. Feda ex- plained that it was an instrument to which one sang. According to
the dictionary is seems to have one, two or three strings, a sort of
primitive banjo used in the East, especially Japan and China. Long
after the experiment I introduced the word in conversation with
Mrs Leonard. She appeared to be unfamiliar with it and said that it suggested nothing but the title of some old song.
Gaekwar. This is the family name of the rulers of Baroda, and has,
by the English, been converted into a dynastic title. Since Baroda
is some five hundred miles from Simla, which Feda claims as her
native district, it might be asked whether she would be likely to have
378 C. Drayton Thomas [partheard the term in her lifetime. One cannot say, yet it is not improbable ; for the dynasty was foimded by a succession of warriors duringthe first half of the eighteenth century, and news of such an eventwould spread throughout northern India. Here I may quote fromthe Enc. Brit. : “ The princes of Baroda were one of the chiefbranches of the Mahratta confederacy, which in the eighteenthcentury spread devastation and terror over India. . . . During thelast thirty-two years of the century the house fell a prey to one ofthose bitter and unappeasable family feuds which are the ruin ofgreat Indian families.”
These events happened shortly before the period which Fedaindicates as that of her earth life, and may possibly explaiu why shenow associates Gaekwar and the Prince with the stimulus word“ wicked.”
It is true that the title Gaekwar is familiar to English people, butFeda used it in an entirely appropriate connection. It is to be notedthat she did not use the word Maharajah, which is equally well knownand which is particularly familiar to Mrs Leonard because a Maharajah and his wife were at one time regular visitors.
2. John
My father, John Drayton Thomas, was a Methodist minister forforty years before he retired from active work, but he continued totake services up to the day before his death in 1903. When I beganto study mediumship in 1917, the most regular and skilled of thecommunicators identified himself with my father and proceeded togive evidence which I consider to be logically compelling. Duringthe mtervenmg seventeen years he has continued to speak with me,principally through Mrs Leonard, both by using her control, Feda,and by taking personal control himself.
He expressed the utmost willingness to take part in the wordassociation experiment and I now give a selection of his reactions.
A glance at the fist of reaction words shows a number which relateto the work of the ministry, among them the following :
Bible. Scripture. Testament. Ministry. Missionary. Mission.Chapel. Vestry. Aisle. Choir. Sermon. Preach. Visits. Class.Preaching. Truth. Evil. Hymn. Psalm. Communion. Collection.
Build : CHAPEL, mission. Mission.
Young : class, minister, assistant, missionary.
Speak : Sermon, carefully, audibly, carry.
To the last he added that he always felt the importance ofmaking the voice carry.
141
] Word AssociaMon Experiment with, Mrs 0. Leonard. 379
Black : suit. suit. coat. coat.
My father dressed in black throughout the whole of his
ministerial life, and was very jiarticular about it. Wine : Supper. Bread. Communion.
Book : Bible. Bible, scriptures, moppat.
My father admired the outstanding missionaries, and especially Moffat. He once gave me a book on Moffat’s work.
Sing : Hymn. Psalm, mission. Choir.
Window ; Chapel, vestry.
Read ; Testament, testament.
Travel : Circuit. Circuit.
Go : Circuit. Circuit. Circuit.
Each Methodist minister is sent to work in a locality which
is termed his Circuit. At the expiration of a few years he must
go to a different Circuit. Ministers who thus move aliout are termed “ travelling preachers,” and the term “ to travel ” is used in that sense. A minister is said to have “ travelled
”
such-and-such a number of years, i.e. the period dtuing which
he has been in the ministry.
Walk : Long. long. Long.
Long : Walk. Sermon.
Although such associations as these are too trite to be evidential, it is worth noting how jieculiarly they ap]dy to my
father. He certainly preached long sermons and he delighted
in long walks. For many years he constantly walked long
distances to fulfil preaching appointments ; he was jiroud of
his speed and endurance. After his death I found a detailed
record of the miles he had walked in the forty years of his
ministry.
The following are strongly reminiscent of my father’s character,
teaching and practices :
Bet ; Silly, never. Say : truth, sermon. Preach. Truth.
Love : obey. Teaching, honour, neighbour.
Life : bright, busy. Habits, routine.
Silly : Foolish.
He then added, “ Foolish ” was more my word than “ silly.”
This I remember was so. Beer : Bad. Stupid.
My father was a strongly convinced total abstainer.
3 so C. Drayton Thomas [partThe following I>il)lical associations are too well known to require(‘luciclation : Lamp : Wise.
Bread : Stone.
Rich : NEEPLE. Needle. Camel.
Tree : Bay.
We now come to reactions suggestive of particular memories.
Town : bath. Newport, taunton. bath.
My father was educated at Bath. He married from Newportand I was born at Taunton.
Street : Newport, row. Our residence in my early childhood was at Yarmouth, whereour house was close to some of the famous Rows. These arenarrow alleys connecting wider streets. Village : Island.
Only once in his forty years’ ministry did my father reside in avillage, and that was in the Isle of Wight. At all other timeshe was in towns or cities.
Girl : HETTFE. ETTA. ETTA.
My sister’s name was Henrietta ; she was always called eitherHettie or Etta.
Brother : Alfred. John. Alfred.
Alfred was my father’s favourite l)rother. John was an elderbrother who died in infancy and, as my father was the nextmale child, he was also called .lohn.
Brown : circuit.
The Rev B. Browne worked with my father in the same cir- cuit, and there was an unusually close intimacy between them.Cook : COPPY.
Colloquial name for Co])p, a cook who was in our family forsome thirty years.
Friend : Johnson.
A common name and therefore likely to fit several friendshipsin the course of a long life ; this cannot therefore weigh asevidence. Yet it is peculiarly apposite here, for the Johnsonfamily were among our closest friends, Mrs Johnson presidingat my sister’s birth. It is a name which would live in myfather’s memory.
Pay : Stipend. Tin. quarter.
Many stipends besides those of Methodist ministers are paidquarterly and the above reactions would have been without
14-1] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 381
significance had it not l)een for the inclusion of “ tin.” I am
aware that the word is vulgarly used as synonymous with
money, but that does not deter me from giving a much more
satisfying explanation. My father once invested a considerable
sum of money in tin mines and the money was finally lost. The
incident made a great impression upon my father and he often
spoke of it ; while “ tin mines ” became a family term for ri.sky
speculation.
Month : January. January. January. January. January.
His aside was, “ An anniversary, you know.” “ January

there is an anniversary—Mother’s.” My mother’s birthday is in January.
Needle : Bag.
Carry : Bag.
I place these together for convenience of comment. After
making the latter reaction John asked me, “ You remember my
coat with the cape ? ” I replied that I did. He continued, “ I carried a bag and wore a coat with a cape. Cannot you see me
so now ? ” I remember that coat with its Inverness cape, and I
still have the bag which my father always carried when leaving
home for week-end appointments. In that bag he took needle
and thread, explaining that he might have occasion to sew on
loose buttons.
Box : Tools, long.
No one familiar with our home in my father’s time could fail to be struck with this combination of words. His tools, as far
back as I can remember, were always kept in a very long narrow box and he rather prided himself upon his skill with its contents.
Tool-box is obviously a commonplace association, but it is doubtful if the word “ long ” woidd be ordinarily associated with
“ tool-box.”
Window : Plants.
He added, “ You remember ? ” I certainly do remember that
my father for many years always had a stand of plants in his
study window, as well as hanging plants in the windows of the
dining room. Paper : Methodist. Methodist.
My father’s favourite church paper was The Methodist
Recorder.
Chair : red. Reading. Red.
On giving the first reaction John added, “ You remember it, don’t you, Charlie ? ” But for that cpiestion I should have
noticed nothing relevant in this association of “ red ” with
382 C. Drayton Thomas [part“ chair.” Biit I then recollected that, when furni shing hisstudy on retirement from the itinerancy, he bought at a sale aneasy chair. It was specifically his in a sense applying to no otherchair in the house.
For years this chair has been covered and I had to make aninspection after this sitting in order to ascertain its originalcolour. I found it was red morocco ! I had never thought of it as a
“ readiirg chair,” but always asan “ easy chair ” ; nor was I aware that its colour had originallybeen red. The red is still visible where the leather has beenprotected from fading.
Finger : numb.
He added, “ You remember ? ” On repetition the medium’sfingers gave a snap as the word was spoken.
This is peculiarly interesting. My father’s fingers, when hewashed in cold weather, would often turn whitish and feel numb.My mother used to remark upon the change of colour. Thequestion, “ You remember ? ” together with the snapping offingers during repetition of the word “ numb,” was eloquentof a personal recollection.
3. Etta
My sister Etta was an ideal mother and housewife. Her chiefrecreation was painting. For long years she suffered ill health andpain, and her passing followed upon a severe operation which wassuddenly found to be necessary.
Among the reactions of E we find the following ; Get well. Strong. 111. lUness. Anxiety. Ambulance. Operation. Instruments. Nurses. Dressing. Nursing. Anaesthetics.Sick. Surgeon. Pain. Hospital. Medicine. Suffering.
Interest in sketching and painting is indicated in other reactions :
Painting. Sketching. Paints. Ochre. Lines. Sky. Picture.Drawing. Canvas. Distance.
Household associations are common to many women, but theyare strongest in the mind of a good mother and house manager, suchas was my sister. In the reactions of Etta we find many such : Accounts. Meals. Child. Dinner. Work. Beds. Order.Garden. Lawn. Tidy. Home. Darn. School. Fireside. Jam.Meal. Eggs. Carpet. Pudding. Sheets. Linen. Table. Apron.Breakfast. Economy. Firewood. Chimney. Babies. Mother.
141] Word Association Experiment tvith 3Irs 0. Leonard 383
Family. Christening. Grate. Rug. Slippers. Houses. Sash.
Flannel. Daughter. Bathroom. Tub.
The following suggest my sister’s personal memories and characteristics :
Nasty ; pain, medicine. Pain. Medicine, medicine, medicine.
Doctor : Sudden, operation, hurry.
Bed : Nursing. Anaesthetic.
Knife : operation. Table, operation.
Proud : mother, family.
Name : Joy. christening. (Joy is the name of Etta’s only
daughter.)
Love : CHILDREN. Stuart. Family. (Stuart is Etta’s younger son.)
Kiss : CHILD. Stuart, children, children.
Girl : JOA’. Daughter.
Pain : operation. (Etta’s operation was preceded by a period of
intense pain.)
Child : JOY. joy.
Dead : arisen. Operation. Arise.
Etta’s asides. Comments upon reaction words
Finger : sore. sore.
^\^len giving the reaction “ sore ” Etta added, “ Clara’s
finger.” This conclusively showed knowledge of the following fact : my wife, Clara, while strugghng to draw reluctant
curtains, rasped her index finger so severely that the skin was
deeply wounded beneath the second joint. In this position the
wound was slow to heal and caused much inconvenience. During the first few days I fixed the bandage, but afterwards scarcely
gave the incident any further thought. The finger was hurt
nine days before this sitting, and was still sore and stiff, as I ascertained by inquiry on reaching home. My wife was not at
the sitting and the medium could not have been aware of the
incident.
The allusion can scarcely be attributed to chance coincidence.
I do not recollect my wife having ever hurt a finger before. If
Etta noticed on this occasion a small happening in our home, it was no more than she had done scores of times before. Many of
her allusions to home events I can recognise at once, but others
have not been within my knowledge and were only verified by
inquiry of others in the house.
Mountain : Island.
The only mountain Etta climbed was one in the Isle of Man.
384 C. Drayton Thomas [past
Green : Carpet.
Etta bought a green carpet when furnishing her first home. She was rather proud of the selection, and it was in use
during all her married life. Ked : Grimm’s.
Etta added, “ For the children, dear.” I learn on inqmrythat her children had Grimm’s Fairy Tales. This may be com-mon enough to-day, but we never read them in our childhood.
Foot : ARCH.
She added, “ I was thinking of something that happenedlong ago. It was an important matter and I am glad we put it
right at the time.” This looks like a recollection of what was agreat trouble to her during the childhood of her younger boy ; he developed flat-feet and was pronounced incurable by severaldoctors. Finally a bonesetter put him right and there was norecurrence of the weakness.
Hill: ROCHESTER.
Etta lived at Star Hill, Kochester, for three years. It wason a steep rise.
Ball : TENNIS. TENNIS. TENNIS.
Etta was very fond of lawn tennis and apart from cycling it was her only sport.
Box : Trunk.
She added, “ Do you remember I had a box which Iused instead of a trunk and sometimes people used to laugh ? ”Yes, she had a rather out-sized box which we jocularly termed“ The Ark.”
Head : Sunbonnet. sunbonnet.
Hat: SUNBONNET. sunbonnet. sunbonnet. sunbonnet. sun-bonnet. SUNBONNET.
This reaction was evidently a clear-cut association. I gaveEtta a sunbonnet under exceptional circumstances during aholiday shortly before the war, and she often alluded to it.
Cook : HANNAH. HANNAH. ^ The name of a maid who lived with us during Etta s childhood.
Town : leek. Newport, leek. Newport.
Etta was born at Leek and later stayed there with friends.Newport was regularly visited, as grandparents resided thereand we regarded it as our second home.
Bil'd: HURT. HURT. HURT.
i ,• i Our nickname for a friend of Etta’s childhood was ‘ The littlehurt bird.” This was once made the subject of a strikingly
141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 385
successful identity test in Leonard sttings. See Chapter V in my
book Life Beyoi^ Death with Evidence.
Lamp ; tipping, tilt. tilt. tilt. tilt. tilt.
This is reminiscent of an accident our mother once had with an oil lamp which tilted over and fell to the floor. We were much
concerned lest the accident should happen again with more
serious results, and were relieved when our parents removed to a house with gas lighting.
Month : june. april. apeil. april. april.
Etta’s honeymoon was in June. April was the month of her
death.
Box : PAINTS. PAINTS. PAINTS. Work ; painting. Sketching.
Paint : Sketching, pictures. Canvas, pictures, pictures.
FLOWERS.
The above three stimulus words brought out references to
Etta’s favourite recreation, which was painting ; her favourite
subjects were flowers.
Brother: you. one. in-law. albert.
The word you refers to me ; I was Etta’s only brother. Her
only brother-in-law was Albert.
Knife: operation. Table, operation.
Doctor : Sudden, operation, hurry.
Both the above are reminiscent of the circumstances attending Etta’s death.
The above reactions were peculiar to E alone, but the following
three were also given by J : Blue : J. Ribbon.
E. Ribbon. Identical reactions but given on different days.
Dog : J. SOMETIMES. BLACK. COLLIE.
E. COLLIE. COLLIE. Both give “ Collie ” but on different
days.
Town : J. Newport.
E. NEWPORT. NEWPORT. Identical reactions but Oil different
days.
The reaction “ ribbon ” may be reminiscent of the time when both
my father and my sister wore “ the blue ribbon,” at that period a popular badge of total abstinence. In an aside following the reac- tion “ sometimes,” J said it meant that he kept a dog sometimes but
not always. That was the case in my father’s household ; his first dog was “ black,” but this was before my sister’s birth and I doulit
386 C. Drayton Thomas [partif she ever heard of it. In later years they kept a
“ collie,” as Ettawould well remember. Their only other dog had belonged to Ettaand she took it away when she married. Newport has many associations for our family. Thus all reactions were consistent with the
memories of my father and sister. With the above exceptions no personally evidential reaction wasshared by two personalities.
As to conmionplace duplications, it was inevitable that these shouldoccur in response to lists containing so many words having conventional associations ; but every such duplication will be counted in
the second part of this paper.
Although it has no bearing upon our examination of the reactionwords, it may be of interest to quote Feda’s remark upon her condition during these tests.
[Feda. Do you know what I does ? C.D.T. No.
Feda. I have not got to get messages or evidence, so I bees myself.|It is very nice. Look, when I ordinary give sittings I doesinot be myself, because if I did the sitters and communicatorswould think me a nuisance. So I have to be a kind of machineifor taking messages from communicators, mostly from Eng-|lish people which are very dense. So I have to keep sayingwhat they say and think.
But now I can be myself, and I can think myself back as Iwas on earth. It is beautiful.
Etta and Mr John say that they become very personal andIthink just only of the words and what they suggest. The above, given in Feda’s own pecuhar grammar, harmonises withwhat may be termed the watertightness of the several commuiiicators. Feda gives words indicating an interest in the East, quiteconsistent with her claim to be a native of India. John s repliescontain many Scriptural, ministerial and personal allusions, whileEtta’s list is rich in references to home life, family interests, sketchingand illness. From any point of view it is noteworthy that these several interestsdid not overlap, but were strictly confined to the personalities towhom they were appropriate. Feda shows no interest in ministerial life or in family matters, while neither John nor Etta revealsany acquaintance with the East.
4. Mrs Leonard
We have three sets of Mrs Leonard’s reactions—two (of which oneis for Lp, the other for Ln) of seventy-five words on each of six
141] Word Association Experiment ivith 3Irs 0. Leonard 387
occasions, and one (for Ln) of fifty words on each of four occasions.
This gives a total of 1,100 stimulus words. The reactions may be described as commonplace and non-identifying. I have known Mrs
Leonard for seventeen years and am famihar with her interests and
history. Yet a survey of her reactions rarely shows anything distinctive of either. They might be given by anybody or by everybody ; there is nothing to indicate Mrs Leonard—or almost nothing.
The following are the only exceptions I can find ; Lamp : shade, glass, shade, glass, shade, shade.
Build : HALL. Hall. hall. hall.
During the period in which these experiments were proceeding Mrs Leonard was building a hall suitable for meetings. She was having the hall fitted for electric fighting and discussed with
me the best kind of glass shade to select. Land ; Lease, price, price.
Previous to building the hall she had built her present house.
Naturally the question of lease or freehold and of price had been
prominent in her mind on both occasions.
Ball : PLAY. Play.
For some years Mrs Leonard took exercise m a game which
consisted in keeping a ball on the bounce as long as possible.
Book : TEST. TEST. TEST.
As Mrs Leonard will have been aware, her sittings have produced a remarkable number of highly interesting book tests which were once made the subject of a paper by Mrs Sidgwick
in Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxi, p. 241.
Beat : time. time. time. time.
This might possibly be a memory of the period during which
iirs Leonard was training for the concert platform before an
attack of diphtheria impaired her singing voice.
Doctor ; hector.
Hector is the Christian name of Mrs Leonard’s doctor.
Home : Haven.
Mrs Leonard’s present house is named The Haven.
Wild : Alcohol.
Wicked : cruel. Trap.
These reactions might relate to Mrs Leonard’s interest in total
abstinence, and in the prevention of cruelty to animals.
The above fist includes everything indicative of Mrs Leonard’s
identity. Had she been a communicator, instead of the visible
medium, I should have had grave doubts about the performance,
and should certainly have refused to accept it as emanating from the
388 C. Drayton Thomas [part
]Mrs Leonard I had known ! And this notwithstanding the advan-
|tage she had in giving 450 more reactions than either of the others.
THE RESPONSES CONSIDERED NUMERICALLY
Primary Associations and Reproduction Test
Let ns now deal with all reactions to the seventy-five Stimulus
Words used at six sittings. I first examined the responses for any similarities to be formd between them. We need to know how many reactions of each pair of
Personalities were identical. The result was as follows ; JE 38
LnE 37
LpE 37
LnLp 36
LnJ 24
LpJ 19
FJ 18
FE 17
LnF 15
LpF 12
These figures represent identical reactions to the same StimulusWord. Each occasionally responded with some word which anotherpersonality gave in answer to a different Stimulus Word, but that canbe disregarded ; for our interest is with identical responses to oneand the same Stimulus Word.
Perhaps allowance should be made for the fact that Mrs Leonardmust have grown familiar with the list of seventy-five StimulusWords before the Ln reactions were taken. She had responded six
times to the list as Lp ; and while in trance she may have had someconsciousness of the list being called over to F, J and E, six timeseach ; there had been also the Reproduction Test. The list hadactually been called over forty-seven times before the first Lnreactions were taken.
From personal experience I know that it becomes easier to respondwith identical words the more frequently one hears the list ofStimulus Words, whether it be called over for one’s own reactions orfor those of another. This may be the explanation of the fact thatLn gave more identical reactions with J and F than did Lp.
Why did LnE, LpE, JE, LnLp give more identical replies thanany of the other pairs ? That Ln and Lp, being aspects of the sameindividual, should show a likeness needs no explanation. As to theothers, I hazard the opinion that E exerted some degree of influenceover Ln and Lp and that the likeness between J and E is due to theirearth-life relationship. It is of course possible that this supposedinfluence was exerted by Ln and Lp upon E, rather than vice versa
y
but we shall, I think, find reasons for concluding that it was not so.Be that as it may, we note that Leonard and Etta show some
141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs O. Leonard 389
similarity, as also do John and Etta ; while Feda is markedly less like the others.
I have been asked whether the similarity between J and E, and in a
lesser degree between them and L, might not have been produced by
telepathy from me. It is difficult to see why, if that had been the
case, the same telepathy did not act with F also.
^ It is to be noted that L, J and E might be expected to show some
similarity in view of their sharing English birth and education, while
F s asserted Indian origin would explain the preference for words of
another type.
It has been suggested that Feda elected to play the part of an
Indian and chose her reactions accordingly ; in support of this
hypothesis reference is made to the facility with which some
hypnotised subjects can sustain the part they are commanded to
play. As against this I would point to the highly persistent and
impressive way in which Feda repeated her Eastern responses at
sittings separated from each other by intervals of weeks.
The Eeproduction Test
After taking the reactions to the seventy-five words I immediately
went through the list a second time with the same personality, asking
that rephes should be as quick as possible. A reproduction of the
previously given reaction word indicates perhaps a retentive
memory, but more probably a definite mental association. Especially is it likely to be the latter when the identical word is reproduced
at a sitting or sittings several weeks after the first. For example,
Etta gave “ Sunbonnet ” as her reaction to the word “ Hat,” and

Ln cannot be classed, as her whole set was done after the conclusionof the first experiment. It should be noted that Lp always had firstturn, Feda always the second ; E came before J in four sittings.
Despite the disadvantage of following the other two, E and J headthe list
:
J 40 L 27
E 35 F 11
J heads his pair three times, whereas the others head their pairs butonce each.
These results seem to indicate the predominating influence of Jand E over L.
This is undoubtedly significant. Mr Carington found that J had ahigh average likeness to the other personalities, and it therefore became of interest to inquire whether this was due to his bemg in-fluenced by the others or vice versa. In the above figures we get anindication that J exerted the dominating influence. That this shouldbe so is entirely in accord with his mentality as known to me duringhis lifetime. He was accustomed to positions of authority in whichhe had to take the lead ; moreover he was naturally strong mindedand held his opinions with great firmness.
The figures indicate a close connection between J and E, and re-veal the dominance of the JE combination. This agrees with whatone would have expected ; for my sister Etta shared, to some degree,my father’s strength of character. They inevitably had much incommon, for they were living in the same environment and mentalatmosphere up to the time of my sister’s marriage.
Difference
We may here inquire whether our estimate of similarity can be supported by a consideration of differences. We wiU try to ascertain

whether the observable unlikeness does, or does not, suggest the
action of varying aspects of the same mind.

It is interesting to find, by the above method, the dominatinginfluence of E, because Mr Carington reaches the same conclusion
l)y quite a dilferent method, viz. by comparing and contrasting time
reactions and the Reproduction Test.
While we need have no doubt about F, E and J, I think that the
figures for Ln were lessened m value by the fact that Mrs Leonardgave these reactions after the first set of six sittings was completed.
As previously stated, she had heard the list twelve times when she
was not in trance, and it had been read over no fewer than thirty-five
times while she was in the trance state. This may well have familiarised her mind, conscious and subconscious, not only with the Stimulus
Words but with many of the reactions given by the other personalities. This lessens the value of all Ln computations in this paper.
They are included for the sake of completeness, but no strong argument can be based upon them.
The following remarks were given some years ago, but would seem
141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 393
to bear upon our experiment and the attempt to apportion the in- fluence on each other of medium and the controlling personality.
Feda : Your father says that he refrains from saying many things
which he wishes to give lest they should come through in a
distorted form. Feda feels that also ; for she does not
always make the Medium’s voice speak as intended. Feda
touches something which wakes the Medium’s mind and
then it goes off on its own account.
C.D.T. : Feda, can you hear the words spoken by the Medium ? Feda : Yes, but cannot stop her speakmg if what she says is wrong.
Often Feda camiot get the power to check the words.
Your father says that over-pressure taps the subconscious
mind of the Medium and then something escapes before
Feda can stop it. Even after hearing those escapes and
inaccuracies Feda cannot always so control the Medium’s
mind as to put things right. As each thought is given it is fixed on the co-operative mind which is created partly by
the Medium and partly by Feda. Once it is registered there
a counter-suggestion is not easily put through. Your
father says that Feda thinks she works directly on the
Medium’s brain, but he does not consider that this is entirely accurate. He says that Feda really works upon the
Medium’s mind-essence, which, in its turn, works the brain.
This mind-essence belongs to the Medium’s organism.
The above explanation of a composite mmd, created partly by the
controlling personality and partly by the medium, is of special
interest hi view of the varying degrees of similarity which we find
between the medium and the personalities.
We have seen that any similarity existhig between the reactions of
the personalities and those of the medium varied with the personality
controlling. We also found these variations appearuig in the character of the words peculiar to each, and in the degree of divergence
from the reactions of the medium. Indeed, all that we found seems
to favour the supposition that with change of control there comes
into operation a differently composed mind and memory.
WHAT THE FIGURES INDICATE
The figures indicate a small common element in the reactions of
L with both J and E, and very much less so with F.
Does the common element indicate that L influenced J and E, or was their influence exerted upon L ? Evidently it is the influence of
394 C. Drayton Thomas [part
J and E which is the stronger ; for they are more frequent than L in
first giving the word which one or other of them duplicates with L.
E first 21 times and Lp 15
J „ 10 „ „ Lp 5
Inquiring whether it is J or E who most influences L, we find that
E has most influence ; not only was E first 21 times as shown above,
but EL stand only second to EJ for identical reactions.
This result is supplemented by calculation of difference. LpJhave 795 words different from each other, LpE have 747. This
indicates a closer affinity between L and E than between L and J. Continuing the examination of “ difference,” we find that F (519)
is again isolated from the other personalities by a wide margin.
Next in order comes E (468), and L is la.st (Lp 371, Ln 343).
It is noteworthy that F should be at one extreme and L at the
other. One might have expected a rather close likeness between
iMedium and Control, but Feda’s isolation reveals itself in various
ways throughout the whole experiment.
Written plain over all the figures is the close connection of J and
E. The figures for F isolate themselves, almost as much as did
Feda’s reaction words, with their strong Oriental flavour, which none
else shared. It is surprising, considering the long years in which
they have been associated as Control and Medium, that no strong
similarity should have grown up between her and I\Irs Leonard.
The influence of both J and E over L is much greater than that of
F over L. This is the more surprising seeing that J and E are only
occasional Controls, while F is controlling at every sittmg. Taking
this fact m conjimction with the general colourlessness of the L re- actions, and the almost entire absence of personally characteristic or evidential responses by L, we may conclude that Mrs Leonard is peculiarly happy in being able to keep her mind in the “ clean slate ”
condition. I am av>-are that she has practised this for many years,
fearing that if she thinks of anything particularly interesting just
before a sitting it will interfere with its success. Doubtless this habit
has had much to do with her success in mediumship, and accounts for
the influence she exerts upon Communicators being almost nil. Yet it does not follow from this that the Communicators are able
to express all they wish ; the medium’s influence may be, and I think is, a strongly limiting one. I constantly notice this limiting
influence in my sittings, although rarely, if ever, can I detect anything to suggest that the L influence is overriding that of my communicators. The passage of thought through the L organism seems
subject to some degree of check, but not to any serious distortion.
Mr Carington’s examination, being based on reaction times andw
141] Word Association Experiment with Mrs 0. Leonard 395
reproduction tests, might be expected to show relationships or dif- ferences of a character other than those based on examination of
response words. Nevertheless there are similarities in our conclusions which strongly support each other. Prominent among these
stand out
:
(i) The close relationship of John and Etta.
(ii) Their tendency to dominate the medium.
Had time permitted my communicators to expand their replies
they would probably have explained several response words of which
I failed to see the significance. As it was they explained some which
I should not otherwise have understood.
This leads me to remark that the method of free association might
be used with advantage when communicators find difficulty in ex- pressing their ideas, a difficulty which seems to be increased when
one puts direct questions. Direct questions seem to create a condition of strain which defeats their object. My father explains it thus : “ To put anything m a specific form is most difficult of all. I have
to dodge a machine. You see, there is the medium’s brain, and Feda
manipulating that brain, and I have to dodge both. I find I can get
thmgs through most easily when I take Feda off her guard, when she
is not looking for a word or name. MJien there is a great effort, and
Feda is aware that I am trying, she holds the brain m a strained
condition. Suppose you are about to play a game, or something of
that kind, say to shoot at a target ; if you know you must hit the
bull’s-eye or not make the attempt, you will have less chance of
success than if you think it does not matter whether you do it or not.
Anyone anxiously w^aiting to see you hit the bull’s-eye makes for
you a shghtly strained condition ; this strained condition is not with
me but with Feda.”
MTien, as in these experiments, the communicator is in personal
control of the medium, the above-mentioned strain would, of course,
be felt by himself. This strained condition is evaded by the method
of free association. Skilfully used, it might be effective in eliciting
information which direct interrogation would have blocked.
We have discussed differences and similarities between personalities
making use of the same physical body. WTiether four ordinary
people thus tested might prove less alike in their reactions than do
the personalities under inspection in this paper I do not know, for I have not made a control experiment.
We have, however, discovered something significant in the fact
that these four maintain certain relationships consistently, always
showing the same or similar relations whether we consider their
reaction words, their likenesses or their dissimilarities in response.
396 C. Drayton Thomas [part 141]
The two closest are J and E ; the most widely separated are F andL. It remains for others to interpret these facts.
Jlefore commencing this experiment at Mr Carington’s suggestion
I had no idea as to its probable result. MTiether my Communicatorswould be able to respond at will without being confused by the action
of the medium’s mind, I could not guess. During the progress of the
experiment I refrained from any attempt to study the accumulatingmaterial. By previous arrangement the word lists were not retained
in my possession.
When this material was finally returned to me for examination its character afforded some surprises. I had, of course, noticed someindications of personal memory in the responses of my communicators, but had not realised that this method of free association wasproviding data by which various degrees of reciprocal influence between the different personalities wonld be indicated. Mr Caringtonis to be congratulated upon the insight and enterprise to which so illuminating an experiment is entirely due.

PART 142
NORMAL COGNITION, CLAIRVOYANCE, AND TELEPATHY ^
By Peofessor C. D. Broad, Litt.D.
Introduction
When the Society did me the honour of making me their President
they chose, presumably with their eyes open, a professional philosopher with very little first-hand experience of Psychical Research.
I think I shall be most likely to be of use to the Society in my presidential address if I stick to my last and speak as a philosopher.
All of us are aware that our subject differs from most others in
the following important respect. It is much harder for us than for
workers in other experimental fields to get any empirical facts or
first-order generahsations estabhshed and universally admitted.
No one doubts, e.g., that hght is sometimes reflected and sometimes
refracted ; so the physicist can go on at once to seek for the laws of
reflexion and refraction and the conditions under which such events
take place. But contrast our position in respect of supernormal
cognition. For my own part I have no doubt that telepathy among
normal human bemgs happens from time to time. And it is quite
clear to me that, in order to account for the information which is sometimes conveyed by good trance-mediums and automatic
writers, a very extensive and peculiar telepathy among the living
is the very least that must be postulated. Probably most, if not
all, of those here would agree with me. But we know quite well that
most scientists and the bulk of the general public would not admit
this for an instant. And we know that this is not because they have

398 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partloolced into the evidence and found it faulty or have suggested'
plausible alternative exj)lanations. They would no more thinlv oflooking into the evidence for telepathy than a pious Christian thinksof looking into the evidence for Mahometanism, or a pious Mahome-j tan of looking into the evidence for Christianity. When we leavetele])athy and pass to other forms of supernormal cognition thereis no agi-eement even among ourselves. Many of us would say that'
non-inferential foreknowledge of an event is plainly impossible,and that no evidence could convince us of it. And many of usi would feel that the modus ojoerandi of pure clairvoyance or of non-i inferential cognition of past events by a person who never witnessedthem is so difficult to conceive that we could hardly be persuaded ofthe occurrence of such cognition.
Of course each of us is influenced to some extent by psychologicalcauses, which are logically irrelevant, when he accepts or rejects analleged fact or a suggested theory on the strength of evidence submitted to him. But an important logical principle is involved too.The degree of belief which it is reasonable to attach to an alleged]fact or a proposed theory depends jointly on two factors, viz. : (a) its antecedent probability or improbability, and (b) the trustj worthiness of the evidence and the extent to which it seems toIexclude all alternatives except the one suggested. On preciselysimilar evidence it would be reasonalde to believe much more stronglythat an accused man had cheated at cards if one knew him to be aibookmaker than it would be if one knew him to be an Anglicanlbishoji, l)ecause the antecedent probability of the alleged event is i'much greater in the former case than in the latter. Now antecedentprobability depends very largely on analogy or coherence of thesuggested proposition with what is already known or reasonablybelieved about the sul>ject-matter with which it is concerned.Antecedent improbalulity depends very largely on lack of analogyor jiositive discordance with what is already known or reasonablybelieved.
The application of this to our sid)ject is obvious. People have atthe back of their minds a certain system of knowledge and beliefabout the nature and conditions of normal cognition. They suspectthat the various kinds of supernormal cognition which have beenalleged to happen would be utterly different in nature and wouldpresu])])ose an entirely different kind of causation. They thereforeregard the occurrence of supernormal cognition as antecedentlyvery unlikely, and they demand for it evidence of such amount andsuch quality as they would not think of requiring for alleged facts ofa normal kind. This attitude is, up to a point, perfectly reasonable,and it is impossible to say just where it ceases to be so. It seems to
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 399
me that the whole situation would be very much clarified if the
two following requests coidd be fulfilled. Tu the first place, we should
like to have a clear and explicit statement of what may reasonably
be regarded as well-established facts about the nature and conditions
' of normal cognition. Secondly, we should like to get from psychical
researchers a moderately clear statement of what they understand
by “ clairvoyance,” “ telepathy,” “ pre-cognition,” etc., and some
suggestions about the possible modus operandi of these forms of
cognition if they do occur. If such statements were forthcoming, we
might be able to see where precisely there is analogy or lack of
analogy, coherence or discordance, between alleged supernormal
cognition and admitted normal cognition. This would be a great
advance on the present vague impression of oddity and upsettingness. Now a professional philosopher, interested in Psychical Research,
ought to be of some use in this connexion. He ought at least to be
able to make a moderately coherent answer to the first request, and
he might be able to make a few suggestions towards answering the
second. I propose to devote the rest of my address to these topics.
The forms of supernormal cognition which have been alleged to
1 occur may be roughly classified as follows. We may divide them
first into supernormal cognitions of contemporary events or of
the contemporary states of things or persons, and supernormal cognitions of past or futiire events or the past or future states of things
or persons. Under the first headmg would come Clairvoyance and
Telepathy. Under the second heading woidd come such knowledge
of the past as was claimed by Miss Jourdain and Miss Moberley in
their book An Adventure, and such foreknowledge as is claimed by
Mr Dunne in his book An Experiment with Time. We will call these
“ Supernormal Postcognition ” and “ Supernormal Precognition ”
respectively. Smce Clairvoyance, if it happened, would involve no
complications about other minds than that of the cogniser or other
times than that at which he has his cognition, I shall begin with it. I shall then consider Telepathy. I shall not attempt to deal with
Supernormal Postcognition or Precognition in this paper.
Clairvoyance
Suppose that a person correctly guesses the number and suit of a
card in a new pack which he has never touched, and which has been
mechanically shuffled so that no one else has the information in his
mind at the time. If this were to happen often under test conditions, there would be a jwinia facie case for postulating pure clair- voyance. It would then be reasonable to raise the following ques-
400 Professor G. D. Broad, Litt.D. [parttion : “ Supposing that pure clairvoyance does occur, how far, if atj all, is it analogous to ordinary sense-perception ? ” This is thec|uestion which I am now going to discuss. I
Normal Sense-perception
Plainly we cannot hope to answer this question until we havestated clearly what happens in normal sense-perception. I shalltherefore begin by giving what seems to me to be, on the whole, themost reasonable account of this in view of all the known facts. Weshall have to consider it in its psychological, its physiological, andits physical aspects. The subject is very complex and highly controversial, and I shall have to be rather dogmatic in order to bereasonably brief.
} I think that the first point to be made is that there are severalforms of sense-perception which are, prima facie, fundamentallydifferent in nature. Philosophers have too often confined themselves|to a certain one of them, viz., visual perception, in discussing thesubject. It is essential that we should not make this mistake if we!are seeking for analogies between clairvoyance and normal sense-1perception. I begin, therefore, by dividing sense-perception intoi “ extra-somatic ” and “ intra-somatic.” In the former the percijpient seems to himself to be perceiving foreign bodies and events ;
: in the latter he seems to himself to be perceiving the inside of his’own body and processes going on in it. Now there are at least threeimportant forms of extra-somatic sense-perception, viz., hearing,sight, and touch, which seem, primafacie, to be unlike each other incertain fundamental respects.
Sight and hearing agree with each other and differ from touch inthat they seem to reveal to us things and events which are located|at various distances out from our bodies. But hearing differs from(sight in the following important way. When I say that I hear ajbell I should admit that this is an elliptical expression. Strictly( speaking, I hear a noise of a rhythmic booming kind which seems tobe emanating from a distant place and coming to me in a certainidirection. I take it that this place contains a bell, and that a certainjrhythmic process in it is causing it to make the noise. On this point;there would be no difference in principle between the account whichian unscientific percipient would give of the experience as it seems tohim and the account which a scientist would give of it from thestandpomt of physics. But, when I say that I see a bell, I do not!readily admit that I am using an elliptical expression, as I shouldjadmit that “ I hear a bell ” is short for “ I hear a bell tolling.” I
jseem to myself to be directly and intuitively apprehending a remote
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 401
coloured area which I take to be part of the surface of an independent
foreign body. I may learn from the scientists that the situation,
in its physical aspect, is very much like that which exists when I
hear the bell. I may learn that certain rhythmic processes are
going on in the place where the bell is, that these cause a disturbance
to be emitted in all directions from this centre, and that this disturbance eventually travels to my body and produces a visual sensation. But, even if I accept this as proved, it remains a fact that the
situation does not present itself to me in that way when I am having
the experience. I continue to seem to myself to be directly apprehending the surface of a remote extended object and to be actively
exploring it with my eyes. In this respect visual perception resembles tactual perception, except that the objects are perceived
as remote from the percipient’s body in the one case and in contact
with it in the other.
We may sum up these likenesses and unlikenesses as follows. VV e may say that hearing is projective in its epistemological aspect, and
is emanative in its physical aspect. We may say that sight is ostensibly prehensive and not projective in its epistemological aspect, but
is emanative in its physical aspect. And we may say that touch is
ostensibly prehensive in its epistemological aspect, and is nonemanative in its physical aspect.
Now the question at once arises whether sight and touch are really
,
as well as ostensibly, prehensive. We will now consider the two
kinds of perception in turn. The mere fact that sight is physically
emanative does not, as some people have thought, suffice to prove
that it cannot be epistemologically prehensive. It is logically
possible that the function of the light-waves which emanate from a
distant object, strike the percipient’s eye, and thus eventually
affect his visual brain-centres, should be purely that of evoking and
directing a cognitive act and not in the least that of producing or
modifying a cognisable object. In fact the disturbance hi the percipient’s brain, produced by the light-waves, might simply cause his
mind to apprehend dhectly the coloured surface of the remote
object from which the waves emanated. If so, visual perception
would really be prehensive. But, although this is logically possible,
I think it may quite safely be dismissed as inconsistent with the
facts taken as a whole. The argument for this conclusion is cumulative. Each kind of fact which seems to conflict with the view that
visual perception is prehensive can, perhaps, be squared with it if we choose to make a complicated and ingenious enough supplementary ad hoc hypothesis. But these various supplementary h}qiotheses are logically independent of each other ; and, when one takes
them all together, the prehensive view becomes as complex and
402 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partartificial and incredible as the Ptolemaic system of astronomy hadbecome just before it expired.
I shall content myself with mentioning one jiarticularly obviousdifficulty. Light travels with a finite velocity. It is thereforepossible that, when the light which started from a distant starreaches my eye, the star should have moved away from its originalposition, changed its original colour, or blown up completely. Ifsight were really prehensive the result of the light now striking myeye and affecting my brain would be that I now directly apprehendthe surface of the star as it was when the light left it perhaps athousand years ago. My act of direct acquaintance would thus haveto bridge a temporal gap of a thousand years between the date of its own occurrence and the date of existence of its own immediateobject. Yet the object which I see is most certainly perceived byme as simultaneous with my act of seeing it. I conclude that visual percejition, though ostoisihly prehensive ofexternal objects, is not really so. All the facts conspire to support thefollowing conclusion. W hen I have a visual j^ercejition I seem to myself to be directly apprehending an area of a certain size and shape,coloured in a certain way, and forming part of the surface of a certain
material thing at a certain position outside my body. Put the shapeand size and position which I perceive it as having, and the colourwhich I perceive as pervading it, are completely and finally determined, on the physical side, by certain jirocesses which are going onat the time m a certain part of my brain. Provided that these
processes are going on in this jiart of my brain, and that my mindis functioning normally, I shall have exactly this kind of visual
experience no matter how the brain-process may have been set iqi,
and no matter whether there is or is not an external body such as I seem to myself to lie directly apprehending. If the brain-process
has been set iqi by light which has travelled fi’om an external source through a homogeneous medium to my eye, the visual perception
will be as nearly veridical as it is ])ossil)le for a visual perception to
be. If it has been set up by light which has travelled from anexternal source but has undergone reflexions or refractions before
reaching my eye, the visual perception may be highly misleading
hi many respects, Imt it will not be utterly delusive. If it has been
set up liy events in my own body, as in dreams or delirium, or bysuch abnormal causes as the suggestions of a hy|jnotist, the visual
perception will be utterly delusive. Thus, even in the most favourable case, where there is or has been an external source and where
the visual perception gives the ])crcipient correct inlbrmation aliout
its shape, jiosition, and physical state, the connexion between the
act of perceiving and the external source is extremely remote. Even
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 403
in this case the source and the processes going on in it are at most a
remote causal ancestor of the visual perception and are never the immediate object of it. Thus there is always a certain element of
delusiveness in even the most normal and veridical visual perception.
For the percipient always seems to himself to be directly a'pjnehending the surface of a remote object as it now is, whilst at best he is only cognising very indirectly certain facts about an emitting source
as it forfnerly was. Owing to the very great velocity of light the
time-error is practically unimportant except when the source is at an astronomical distance from the observer. But ostensible prehensiveness, like original sm, is a taint which equally and systematically
infects all visual perceptions, good, bad, or indifferent.
One important consequence of this is the following. Consider
the statement ; “ You and I are seeing the same part of the surface
of the table.” There is no reason to doubt that such statements
often record facts, and that they do this quite efficiently for most of
the practical purposes of daily life. Nevertheless there is a suygestio
falsi about them. They suggest that there is a certain part of the
surface of a certain external body which you and I are both directly
apprehending. But the fact which they record, when they ilo record
a fact, is much more complex and of a very different kind. It would
be more accurately expressed by the statement : “ This visual
ex]ierience of mine and that visual experience of yours, though they
are not prehensions of a common object, have a common causal
ancestor in an emittmg source outside our bodies.”
We can now turn our attention to tactual perception. As I have
said, this is ostensibly prehensive in its epistemological aspect, and
is non-emanative in its physical aspect. In tactual perception we
must distinguish three factors, (i) Awareness of various sensible
qualities, such as hotness and coldness, roughness and smoothness,
etc. This may be compared with awareness of auditory qualities in
hearing and of colours in seeing, (ii) Awareness of shape and extent.
This may be compared with the corresponding factor in visual ])erception. There is, I think, nothing like it in hearing, (iii) The
experience of actively pulling and pushing foreign bodies which are
in contact with one’s own and making them move in spite of their
varying degrees of resistance to one’s efforts ; the experience of
trying to move them and failing because the resistance which they
offer is too great ; and the experience of being forcetl to move, in
spite of resisting to one’s utmost, by the thrust and pressure of other
bodies on one’s own. I will call this dynamic experience. I know of
nothing analogous to it in any other form of perception.
It is this dynamical factor in tactual perception, and the systematic way in which variations in it are correlated with variations in
404 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthe non-dynamical factors, which makes it difficult even for the mostsceptical to doidjt that tactual perception is really prehensive of external objects. We may admit at once that there is not here, as in thecase of visual ])erception, a large coherent mass of facts which it isdilHcult or impossil)le to reconcile with the prehensive view. It mighteven be argued with some plausibility that, unless we realhj are di-rectly acquainted with foreign bodies in the experience of active manipulation, we should never have seemed to ourselves to be dhectly ac-quainted with them in visual perception. But we must not let ourselves be rushed into accepting the prehensive view of tactual perception until we have noted one important fact which may bear inthe opposite direction.
Tactual perception shares with sight and hearing a characteristicwhich we have not yet mentioned. It is transmissive m its physiological aspect, i.e., it depends on the existence and functioning ofnerves which connect the periphery of the body to the bram andconvey disturbances at a finite rate hiwards and outwards. Now it IS certain that the occurrence of a characteristic kind of disturbancein my brain is a necessary condition without which I shall not havea perception of myself as touching and interacting with a foreignbody. The question is whether the occurrence of such a process inmy brain is also the sufficient physical condition of my having suchan experience. If it is sufficient I should have exactly the sametactual experience, provided that this process in my brain were tooccur and that my mind were workmg properly, even if there wereno foreign body in contact with my skin. If this were so, my tactualperceptions could not be jirehensive. It is difficult to settle this
question conclusively, because it is doubtful whether precisely thatkind of brain-state which occurs when I am actually manipulatingand struggling wfith a foreign body ever does arise from purelyinternal causes. But the fact that I can dream that I am strugglingwith a foreign body, though I am in fact doing nothing of the kind,
certainly suggests that even the experience of active tactual manipulation may not be really prehensive.
My own tentative view is that tactual perception is probably notprehensive of external objects, but that, in spite of this, it justifies us
in being practically certain that there are foreign bodies and that theydo interact with our own bodies. It seems to me just conceivable,
though extremely uidilmly, that I might have had the kinds of ex- perience which I describe as “ seeing ” or “ hearing ” foreign bodies even if there had been no foreign bodies or if they had never emitted
light-waves or sound-waves to my body. But I find it almost impossible to believe that I could ever have had the kind of experience
which I describe as “ pushing ” or “ pulling ” or “ struggling with
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 405
” foreign bodies unless there bad been foreign bodies and they had
quite often interacted dynamically with my own body through contact. Granted that this has quite often happened, it is not hard to
explain how occasionally, m dreams or delirium, I may have a close
imitation of this experience although no foreign body is then interacting dynamically \vith mhie.
There is one important point on which I want to insist before
leaving the topic of extra-somatic perception. I have argued that,
when we have the experience of hearing, seeing, or touching something, we are not in fact apprehendmg directly the foreign body, if
such there be, which we say we are hearing, seeing, or touching.
Now at this stage there is a risk of making a serious mistake. It might be thought that, because hearing, seeing, and touching are
indirect and mediate, in the sense of being non-prehensive, they
must be indhect and mediate m the sense that they involve inference. This would be a profound mistake. Even in the case of hearing I do not argue, from the fact that I am hearing a booming recurrent noise and from certain general principles of physical causation, that there is probably a bell tolling in a certam place outside
my body. The fact is that my auditory experiences have been
closely correlated with certain of my visual and tactual experiences
in the past, and this correlation has established a persistent system
of traces and dispositions in my mind. When I now hear a booming
recurrent noise a certain part of this dispositional system is excited,
and the auditory sensation is at once invested with an aura of
acquired meaning in terms of a remote visible and tangible source.
It is still more obvious that there is no element of inference in the
experience which I call “ seeing this ” or touching that. I doubt whether we can account psychologically for the ostensible
prehensiveness of visual and tactual perception by any process of
acquirement of meaning through association in our early years. I think we must assume that visual and tactual experiences are taken
by us, from the very first, as revelations of an external material
world. No donbt all the later detailed development of this primitive
vague conviction depends on the actual course of our experience
and on the particular associations which are established m our early
years.
So much for the purely psychological pomt. There is a logical
point closely connected with it. Behefs which were not reached by
inference may be capable of being supported or refuted by inference.
Now, in my opinion, something like the commonsense behef in a world of extended movable interacting bodies can be shown to be
highly probable, on the basis of our auditory, visual, and tactual
perceptions and their correlations, if and only if the following premise
406 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part.
'is granted. Our primitive uncritical conviction that our visual and'
tactual perceptions are manifestations of an external material world,i ,and that distinctions and variations in them are signs of distinctionsand variations in it, must be allowed to have an appreciable ante-! cedent probability. There is no way of proving this indispensablepremise. Some people may find it self-evident and count it as an! axiom. I am content to take it as a postulate. We will call it thePostulate of Perceptual Transcendence.
Finally we must consider intra-somatic perception, i.e., the perce})tion which each of us has of his own body, and of no other body,| by means of organic sensations. Each of us is almost always awarei of a general somatic background or field, which is vaguely extended' and fairly homogeneous in quality throughout its extent. It is fairly constant in general character, though its specific tone variesfrom time to time. Such variations are recorded by expressions like :
| “ I am feeling tired,” “ I am feeling well,” “ I am feeling sick,” andso on. No doubt the general character changes very slowly as weget older, and it may undergo profound and fairly sudden modifications in illness or at certain periods of normal life such as puberty. ; Against this fixirly homogeneous and constant background therehappen from time to time outstanding localised feelings which are i independent of one’s volition, e.g., a sudden twinge of toothache, a prolonged and voluminous stomach-ache, and so on. We might compare the general somatic field to the visual field ofwhich one would be aware if one lay on one’s back and looked up at
the sky when there is not much movement among the clouds. Andwe might compare the occasional localised outstanding toothaches,
stomach-aches, etc., to the visual sensa which we should sense if there were occasional flashes of lightning, dark masses of cloud, andso on, in the sky.
Lastly, we must notice that, whenever we deliberately act uponor react against a foreign body, there are characteristic localised
changes in the somatic field, connected with the pressures, tensions,
and movements of our muscles and joints.
The following points are of special importance for us to notice.
(i) Intra-somatic perception, like all other normal perception, is transmissive in its physiological as])ect. If I am to have the kind
of ex])erience which I record by saying “ I am feeling a pain in mytoe,” it is not sufficmit that there should be a process of a certain
kind going on in my toe. It is necessary that a certain process should
l)e going on in my brain. Moreover, we are told on good authority
that persons who have had a limb amputated may yet have experi- ences of the kind which they would record by saying “ I have a pain
where my amputated limb used to be.” It therefore looks as if the
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 407
occurrence of a certain process in the brain were the final and sufficient physical condition of the occurrence of this kind of experience. If so, intra-somatic perception cannot be really prehensive of one’s own
body, however much it may seem to be so to the percipient, (ii) There
is, however, no reason to doubt that the brain-process, which is the
final and sufficient physical condition of an intra-somatic perception,
generally arises from and corresponds in structure with a certain
process in a certain other part of the percipient’s body, such as his
stomach or a tooth or a toe. Thus, although intra-somatic perception is probably not prehensive, there is no reason to doubt that it
is generally veridical in outline if not in detail, (iii) One’s awareness of one’s somatic field as extended, and one’s awareness of this or that outstanding bodily feeling as happening in this or that part
of it, are, I think, psychologically quite primitive experiences. But
the identification of this extended somatic field with the region
occupied by one’s body as a visible and tangible object, and the
correlation of each part of the former with a certain part of the latter, are, I am sure, products of early experience and association.
Before I leave the topic of normal perception I want to point out
a certain analogy between sight and intra-somatic perception which
seems to me interesting and important. So long as it is light and
one’s eyes are open, one really is directly apprehending something,
though it is not what one uncritically takes it to be. This something
is an extended, spatially continuous, variously coloured and shaded
field, which is presented as a finite but unljoiinded whole. Outstanding coloured patches are presented as differentiations of this
whole, not as independent elements, like bricks, out of which it is built. The mistake which each of us makes is to identify this
directly apprehended field and its differentiations with something
public, neutral, and independent of him, viz., the ground, the sky,
the surfaces of houses and trees, and so on. There really is a con- nexion between the two, but it is much more remote than we uncritically take it to be. 1 am going to sum up these facts about
visual perception by calling it synojyic and macrocosmic. Now
intra-somatic perception may be described as synoptic and microcosmic. It is synoptic because the somatic field is presented as a whole,
and the outstanding bodily feelings are presented as localised differ- entiations of this whole. It is microcosmic because, in apprehending
it, one does not seem to oneself to be apprehendmg a public neutral
world of independent objects. On the contrary, one seems to
oneself to be ap])rehending in a uniquely intimate way a certain
particular object which is uniquely associated with oneself.
Touch, in contrast with sight and intra-somatic perception, gives us information piecemeal about foreign bodies and the surfaces of
408 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partour own bodies. And, as we have seen, it makes us aware of bodies’
as dynamically interacting substances. Thus sight, touch, and intrasomatic jjerception severally supply their own characteristic con-' tributions to our knowledge of ourselves and of foreign bodies. And,
it is only through their co-existence and their intimate co-operationthat w'e acquire the general world-schema which is the commonbackground of daily life and of natural science.
Clairvoyance and Sense-Perception
Let us now turn from normal perception and consider an allegedcase of clairvoyance. It is essential to take something quite concreteand not to talk vaguely. I will suppose that a special pack of cardshas been made on the following plan. Every card has for its face awhite background on which are either squares or circles, but notboth. Every card has black pips or red pips, but no card has amixture of both. There are thus four suits, which we can call RedSquares, Black Squares, Red Circles, and Black Circles. Lastly, in
each suit there are ten cards in sequence from ace to ten. Thebacks of all the cards are uniformly brown. Let us suppose that thepercipient correctly guesses that the sixth card from the top of anew and mechanically shuffled pack of this kmd is the eight of redsquares. And let us suppose that such guesses of his have so oftenbeen right that we cannot ascribe his success to chance. Could wesuppose that anything analogous to normal sense-perception is taking place ? To assert that a certaui card is the eight of red squares is to assertthree independent propositions, viz., that there are eight outstandingpatches on the surface, that these are square in outline, and that theyare red in colour. Now all these propositions could be known bysight to a person who could look directly at the front of the card inwhite light. This implies that there are eight square patches onthe card, which differ physically from the background in such a waythat they selectively reflect the red-stimulating light-waves whilstthe background reflects equally hght of all wave-lengths in theordinary spectrum. Let us try to suppose that the clairvoyantgets his information by some mode of perception analogous to sightor hearing.
We shall have to suppose that the percipient’s body is beingstimulated by some kind of emanation from the front of the sixthcard in the pack, although the back of the card is towards him.We shall have to suppose that the five cards which are on top of theselected one are transparent to this emanation, though they are nottransparent to light. We shall presumably have to suppose that
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 409
the five cards which are on top of this one and the thirty-four which
are beneath it are all equally emitting radiation of this kind.
^ Thus
the emanation from the selected card will reach the percipient’s body
mixed up with the emanations from all the other cards in the pack.
Next we shall have to assume that, although the emanation is not
light, yet there is a characteristic difference between the emanation
from the pips and the emanation from the background, correlated
with the difference between red-stimulating and white-stimulating
light-waves. Without this there is no hope of explaining how the
clairvoyant can tell that there are pips and a background and judge
the number of pips. Still less could we explain how he can tell the
colour of the pips on the selected card. When we look more carefully into the last mentioned assumption we find that it is equivalent
to the following supposition. We are, in effect, supposmg that the
physical difference between the pips and the background, which
makes the former selectively refiect red-stimulating light-waves and
the latter indifferently refiect a whole mixture of light-waves, is
correlated with another physical difference which is concerned with
another and unknown kind of emanation. This is certainly not
very plausible. ^ We have not yet attempted to deal with the clairvoyant s knowledge that the pips on the sixth card from the top are square in
outline. No assumption that we have so far made will account for
this. If the face of the card were being looked at directly in white
light, the light reflected from its surface would travel in straight
lines to the percipient’s eye. There it would pass through the pupil
and be focussed by the lens on the retina. There it would excite
different parts of a certam area in various ways. The area as a
whole, and the distribution of the excitement over it, would be geometrically a projection of the surface from which the light came. From this excited area, through the optic nerve, a corresponding
pattern of excitement would be transmitted to the brain. At this
stage the percipient would directly apprehend an outstanding oblong
patch in his visual field, with a white background and eight red
squares scattered about it. This he would automatically and uncritically, but erroneously, take to be the surface of the card. In
order to have any analogy with all this we should have to assume
that the emanation travels in straight lines through the medium
between the card and the percipient’s body, and that there is in his
body some organ for collecting it and focussing it on a sensitive
surface. I need hardly say that we know of no part of our bodies
which could plausibly be regarded as such an organ. Moreover, the
fact that we have had to assume that ordinary matter is transparent
to this emanation makes it difficult to see how a material organ
410 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partcould collect and focus it. It is like being asked to construct acamera, or a telescope, or a microscope when the only materialprovided is clear transparent glass.
I have now dealt with the physical and physiological assumjDtionswhich would be involved in supposing that clairvoyant cognition is analogous to sight or hearing. It remains to consider the psychological as]‘)ects of this supposition. In the first place, we should haveto assume that the ultimate result of this emanation being receivedby the appropriate organs, and of the disturbance being transmittedto the appropriate part of the Ijrain, is that the clairvoyant directly
apprehends a total sense-field of a characteristic kind. This experi- ence must be analogous to the normal man’s apprehension of his
visual or his auditory field. So far as I know, there is no introspective evidence for the occurrence of any such experience in personswho claim to be clairvoyant. We should therefore have to assumethat this peculiar kmd of sensory experience belongs to a part oftheir mind which they cannot introspect in normal waking life. Next we must assume that this peculiar sense-field is differentiated, and differentiated in a very special way. There must be in
it an outstanding sensum which in fact corresponds to the sixth
card from the top of the ])ack, and there must be in this sensumeight outstanding differentiations which in fact correspond to the
eight pips on the face of this card. Moreover, there must be acertain determinate sensible quality in these eight outstanding differ- entiations which in fact corresponds to the visible squareness of thepips as they would appear to sight. There must also be a certain
other determinate sensible quality in these eight outstanding differ- entiations which in fact corresponds to the visible redness of the pips
as they would appear to sight. Although emanations are coming in on top of each other from all the cards in the pack, and presumablyfrom the table and the walls too, we must assume that the sensumspecially connected with the emanation from any particular card is distinct enough to be discriminated from the rest of the sense-field
I)y the percipient if he pays enough attention. We must also assumethat such a sensum has enough discriminable detail to display those
features in the card which would appear to sight as a certain numberof pips of a certain shape and a certain colour.
It must be admitted that this involves a very heavy draft on the
I)ank of possibility. I think that the nearest known analogy is provided I)y hearing. The waves from a number of simultaneously
sounding sources, such as the instruments in an orchestra, do comein on top of each other. Yet it is possible with practice and attention
to discriminate the noise which in fact comes from one instrument
from the noise which in fact comes from another. It is also possible
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 411
to distinguish overtones, if one has an acute ear, in the noise which
conies from a certain instrument. This analogy, thougli it is not
to be despised, does not carry us very far. The noise which in fact comes from a certahi mstrument has no auditory quality which is invariably correlated with the shape or the colour which that instrument manifests to sight. The analogy would be a little closer if, when we looked at the various instruments, they appeared to be
visibly vibrating at various rates and with various amplitudes.
Then there really would be a systematic correlation between the
auditory qualities of the noise which comes from a certain instrument
and certain visible characteristics in the appearance which that in- strument would present to sight.
We are not yet at the end of the psychological assumptions which
we should have to make. It is not enough that there should be in
the clahvoyant’s peculiar sense-field a certahi discriminable sensum
which in fact corresponds to the sixth card from the top of the pack.
If he is to answer our question : “ What is the sixth card from the
top ? ” he must knoiv or have reason to believe, with regard to a
certahi discriminable sensum in his field, that it corresponds to the
sixth card from the top. Again, it is not enough that this sensum
should have eight ditferentiations which in fact correspond to the
eight differentiated areas on the card which ajipear to sight as
eight red squares. If he is to answer our question, he must hmtv or have reason to believe that the eight differentiations in this sensum
correspond to eight differentiated areas on the card which would
appear to sight as eight red squares. He must therefore know or have reason to believe, with regard to a certain sensible quality of
these differentiations in this sensum, that it corresponds to visible
squareness. And he must know or have reason to believe, with
regard to a certain other sensible quality of these differentiations,
that it corresponds to visible redness. Unless the clairvoyant knew
these facts he would be in much the same ])osition as a man born
blind who had acquired plenty of tactual experience and was then
suddenly enabled to see. In the visual field of such a man there
would be outstanding coloured patches which are in fact visual
appearances of various things from which he has already received
tactual sensations. And the visible shape of these visual sensa would in fact correspond to the tangible shape of the corresponding
tactual sensa. But the newly cured blind man would not know these
facts or have any reason to suspect them. So, if we were to ask him
a question about an object which he has touched in the past and
is no longer touching but is seeing for the first time, his visual
experience would not help him in the least to answer it. It is not
until his experiences of sight and touch have become correlated and
412 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partassociated, so that a certain kind of visual appearance has come torepresent for him a certain kind of tactual apjiearance, that his newly'acquired power of visual perception will enable him to answer ourquestions about external objects.
How could the clairvoyant acquire such knowledge or belief aswe have had to assign to him ? The extremely intimate associationbetween sight and touch, which is established in infancy in all normalpeople, seems to provide the only helpful analogy. Here we mustsubstitute for it an intimate association between sight and thepeculiar kind of sense-experience which we have assumed the clair- voyant to possess. We shall have to suppose that all or most thingswhich are visible also emit the peculiar emanation which gives rise
to this peculiar kuid of sense-experience when it reaches the clair- voyant’s body. And we mxist suppose that every variation in thelight reflected from bodies is correlated with a corresponding variation in this emanation. On this assumption, the clairvoyant will
from infancy have been apprehending two co-existing and intimatelycorrelated sense-flelds, viz., the normal visual held and the peculiarsense-field connected with the emanation. This may be comparedwith the case of the plain man who apprehends from infancy avisual and a tactual field which are intimately correlated with eachother. The difference is that the normal man is constantly awareof apprehending both the visual and the tactual field, whilst theclairvoyant in ordinary waking life is not aware of apprehending thepecuhar sense-field connected with the emanation. In consequenceof this constant and detailed correlation between the contents ofthe visual sense-field and those of the peculiar sense-field, in theclairvoyant’s case, an intimate association will be established in his
mind between the two, just as an intimate association is established
in the case of the normal man between his visual and his tactual
sense-fields.
When a normal man in the dark has a tactual sensation of a certamfamiliar kind, which has become associated through frequent past
ex]:)erience in the light with a certain kind of visual appearance, heis able to describe in visual terms the object which he is at present
only touching and not seeing. Similarly, when the clairvoyant hasa familiar sensation of his own peculiar kind, which has becomeassociated through frequent past experience with a certam kind of
visual appearance, he will be able to describe in visual terms the object which is evoking this sensation by its emanation but is at present hidden from his view.
It seems at first sight most unplausible to postulate in the clair- voyant’s mind a whole special group of sensations of which he is totally unaware, and then to postulate that they are intimately
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 413
correlated with, his ordinary visual sensations and eventnally become
associated with the latter. Yet it must, I thinlc, be confessed that
a very similar postulate is unblushmgly made by the most orthodox
psychologists in trying to explain normal visual perception of
distance and solidity. We are told a great deal by these scientists
in this connexion about sensations of accommodation and sensations
of convergence. We are told that these become so intimately associated with purely visual sensations that the minutest variation in
the one represents to the percipient a corresponding variation in the
other. But the fact remams that most of us at most times are quite unaware of these constantly occurring and continually varying
sensations of accommodation and convergence. If we focus our
eyes for a long time on a very small and very near object, we may
begin to notice sensations of accommodation. If we indulge in
elaborate and deliberate squinting, we may notice sensations of
convergence. But it is only in these exceptional circumstances that
such sensations are noticed or noticeable by the person who, presumably, is in fact never free from them. So orthodox psychologists
are not in a position to cast stones at the postulates which would
have to be made about the clairvoyant’s special sense-field.
I have now enumerated and explained the various assumptions,
physical, physiological, and psychological, which would have to be
made if clairvoyance is to be regarded as a peculiar kind of senseperception, emissive ui its physical aspect, like sight or hearing. It must be confessed that they make a formidable list. But it is better
to set them out fully and to face them squarely than to talk vaguely
of analogies to wireless and television and “ the marvels of
modern science.” Many people will be mclined, when faced with
this hst of necessary assumptions, to conclude that the attempt
to make clairvoyance analogous to sight or hearing must be
dropped.
Now, unless clairvoyance be analogous to a physically emissive
form of sense-perception, like sight or hearing, it can hardly be
analogous to any form of normal sense-perception. If we tried to
compare it with touch, we should have to suppose that the clair- voyant’s body is provided with invisible and intangible organs,
supplied with sensitive spots on their surface and with conducting
nerves. W^e should have to suppose that he can tlmust these out
and poke them between two cards which are, and remain throughout
the experiment, visibly in continuous contact with each other. And
we should have to suppose that the square areas ou the card which
differ from the background by selectively reflecting red-stimulating
light-waves also differ from the background by giving a special kind
of stimulus to the sensitive spots on this quasi-tactile organ. It 2e
414 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partscorns liardly woi tli wliile to linger over these fantastic sii])positions,or to consider wliat others might lie needed in addition to them.
Perha])S some ]isychical researchers will welcome these conclusions.They will remind us that they have always insisted that clairvoyancecannot he analogous to any form of sense-perception, and they willfeel that I have only lieen underlining the obvious. I cannot sharetheir satisfaction. Have those who believe that clairvoyance occurs,and deny that it is analogous to any form of sense-perce})tion, anypositive notion of its ])sychological nature or its modus ojjerandi ? If they have, it is most desirable that they should expound it. Ifthey have not, they are just postulating what Locke would havecalled “ a something, I know not what.” Since their postulate willthen have no discernible analogy or connexion with anything thatis already known and admitted to be a fact, it will be impossible toassign a degree of antecedent probability or improbability to it. In that case we shall be unable to come to any rationally justifieddegree of belief or dislielief when they produce their empiricalevidence, however impressive it may be.
Cdairvoyance as Non-sensuous Prehension of Physical Objects
The only intelligible positive interjiretation which I can put onthis view of clairvoyance is the following. Those who deny thatclairvoyance is analogous to any form of sense-perception mightsu])pose that the clairvoyant really does directly apprehend remote])hysical objects, as the ordinary man seems to Inmself to do in sightand touch. This supposition is, I think, prima facie intelligible. AsI have said in discussing normal sense-jierception, each of us reallydoes directly ajiprchend something when he is seeing, hearing, etc. In seeing, e.g., one is directly apprehending an extended continuousvariegated coloured field ; though one uncritically mistakes it forsomething else, of a rpiite different nature, which one does not directlyap])rehend. So we can understand, in general outline at any rate,what we are being asked to suppose in the case of the clairvoyant.But, as soon as we begin to consider the suggestion in detail, it becomes less and less intelligible. The card called the “ eight of redsquares ” is a physical object which, when suitably illuminated, reflects light-waves. If these reach the eye of a normal human observer, they stimulate it in a characteristic way, and at a certainstage in the jiroccss a characteristic kind of disturbance is set up in
his optic centres. If and only if all this should happen, the card will
1 )e represented in the observer’s visual field by an outstanding whiteoblong sensum with eight outstanding square spots on it. There is not the faintest reason to believe that the card itself, which is the
142] Normal Cognition,, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 415
locus of a remote causal ancestor in this long and variegated chain
of events, has literally and intrinsically any colour whatever. That
which corresponds in a physical object to the colour which it is perceived as having is presumably some special configuration or some rhythmic motion of its minute constituents, which causes it to reflect certain kinds of light-waves and to absorb others. If, then,
the clairvoyant directly apjirehends the card, as it intrinsically and
independently is, he will not apprehend it as a thing with a white
continuous surface on which there are eight square red spots ; for
it is almost certainly nothing of the kind. He might, perhaps, apprehend it as a swarm of very small colourless electric charges in very
rapid rhythmic motion ; for, according to the best information
available at present to those of us who are not clairvoyants, this or something like this is what the card most probably is. Now, if clairvoyants do directly ajtprehend physical objects as having those characteristics which scientists laboriously infer that
they must have, they show no sign of being aware of their own
knowledge. If they were, they could presumably put it, at least
roughly and in outline, into words. They would then be invaluable
helpers in all physical laboratories ; for their information, artlessly
expressed but “ straight from the horse’s mouth,” would suffice to
head scientists off from plausible but false theories and to suggest
fruitful lines of experiment and speculation. We shall have to
assume, then, that the clairvoyant’s direct apprehension of physical
objects, as they intrinsically are, occurs in a part of his mind which
is cut off from his ordinary waking experience.
The clairvoyant describes the unseen card in terms of colours,
visible shapes, etc., and not in terms of electric charges, waves, and
rhythmic motions. We shall therefore have to explain how he
translates his direct apprehension of the unseen card, as it intrinsically is, into the colours, visible sha])es, etc., which it would appear
to have if it were being seen by a normal human being in daylight.
It will be renrembered that there is a rather similar problem for
those who regard clairvoyance as a peculiar form of sense-x^erception.
The suggestion which I made in that connexion might, qjerhaxjs, be
modified to deal with the present problem. We shall have to suppose
that the clairvoyant has, from infancy, been continuously though
unconsciously apx)rehending directly all those objects which he has
also been cognising indirectly through sight and touch. Then we
can suppose that an association woidd be set up between, e.g., the
conscious exj^erience of seeing an object as red and the unconscious
experience of directly apprehending it as having that intrinsic
characteristic which makes it selectively reflect red-stimulating
light-waves. Suppose that, on some future occasion, such an object.
416 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthough no lo]iger visible, is still being directly Init unconsciouslya])j)rehended by the clairvoyant. He will still apjjrehend it ashaving that intrinsic characteristic, whatever it may be, which hasnow become associated in his mind with the visual appearance ofredness. Consecpiently the idea of it as a red-looking object willarise automatically in his mind, and he will announce that the \mseen object is red.
I have now stated and tried to work out in some detail two alternative views of what clairvoyance would be if it took place. Neitherof them is in the least attractive or plausible, but I know of no otheralternative that is even intelligible. I hope that some of those whothink that there is adequate evidence for clairvoyance will be ins])ired to suggest some other view of it which will be equally intelligil)le and much more ]ilausible. Though I can offer no hint of asolution, I may possildy have given them some help by setting outelements of the ])robleni in a clear and orderly way.
Telepathy
Teleqxithic Interaction
It is comnronly assumed that one embodied mind can affectanother only in an extremely roundabout way. It must first affectits own body ; then this change in its own body must set iip a seriesof physical changes which eventually affect another ensouled body; and, finally, this change in the other ensouled body must produce achange in the mind which animates it. Thus the process involves apsycho] )hysiological transaction at one end, a physiologico-psychicaltransaction at the other end, and a purely physical causal seriesbetween the two. A further restriction is commonly imposed on thisgeneral scheme. It is usually assumed that the process set up withinthe one ensouled body must issue in some overt macroscopic changeof it, such as emitting a sound, making a gesture, or assuming a newfacial expression ; and it is assumed that this must affect the otherensouled body by sight, hearing, touch, or some such form of normalsensory stimulus. The wider assumption may be summed up in thefollowing general principle : “ The only thing, other than itself,
with which an embodied mind can directly interact is the brain andnervous system of the body which it animates.” If this be granted,the rest follows.
We can now imagine various stages in which the commonsenseassum])tion might be given up. (i) We might keep the general principle, but drop the further restriction which is commonly put on it. We might supj)Ose that, in certain cases, the disturbance set up inA’s brain by an event in his mind mitiates a physical process of an
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 417
emanative kind whick travels out in all directions ; that this may
set up a disturbance in B’s brain, if it reaches the latter ; and that
this disturbance in B’s brain may affect his mind. On this view
there need be no overt macroscopic change in A’s body, such as emitting a noise, makmg a gesture, etc. And B’s brain need not be
stimulated through any of the ordinary sense-organs by what is happening in A’s body. Yet the general prmcij)le about interaction
will remain intact.
(ii) The next stage would be to drop one half of the general principle and to keep the other half. This would give two possible alter- natives. (a) We might continue to assmne that A’s mind can directly
affect only A’s bram, and that B’s mind can directly affect only
B’s bram. But we might now suppose that A’s mind can, in some
cases, be directly affected by disturbances in B’s brain ; and that
B’s mind can, m some cases, be directly affected by disturbances in
A’s bram. (6) We might contmue to assume that A’s mind can be
directly affected only by A’s bram, and that B’s mmd can be
directly affected only by B’s brain. But we might now suppose that
A’s mind can, in some cases, directly produce disturbances in B’s
brain ; and that B’s mmd can, in some cases, directly produce disturbances in A’s brain.
(in) Lastly, we might drop the general jninciple altogether. We
might suppose that, in certain cases, one embodied mind can affect or be affected by another embodied mmd directly, without any
physiological or physical mediation. I propose to call the first alternative the “ Brain-wave Theory,” and the third alternative the
“ Theory of Direct Intermental Transaction.” Theories of the
second kind might be called “ Theories of Extended Psychophysiological Interaction.” I camiot pretend that this is a “snappy ”
title, but I think it is accurately descriptive.
If either of these three suppositions were ever reahsed in j>ractice
we should say that there had been a case of “ Telepathic Interaction.” If it were an instance of the Brain-wave Theory it would
involve no supernormal interaction between mind and matter or between mind and mhid. It would involve nothing but an miusual
transaction between two brams and an intervening physical medium.
If it were an mstance of either form of the Theory of Extended
Psycho-physiological Interaction it would mvolve supernormal
interaction between mind and matter, but no direct interaction
between mind and mind. The supernormality of the transaction
would consist in the fact that an event in one man’s mind directly
affects or is directly affected by an event m another man’s brain. If
it were an instance of the Theory of Direct Intermental Transaction
it would involve supernormal interaction between two embodied
418 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part1
minds, but it would not necessarily involve any supernormal interaction between mind and matter. *
If the Brain-wave Theory would fit the empirical facts, it wouldjbe preferable to the other two in respect of antecedent probability.IBut the general opinion of those who have studied the facts seemsto be definitely adverse to this theory. ;In favour of the Theory of Extended Psycho-physiological Interaction it may be said that we do know that each embodied minddirectly affects and is directly affected by at least one brain and ner-vous system, though this kind of transaction has to be accepted as acompletely mysterious brute fact. This one brain and nervoussystem is, of course, that of the one material system to which thismind stands in the peculiar relation of “ animating.” Now thetheory under discussion is that this direct interaction between mindsand brains, which is admitted to occur, is not necessarily or iavariably restricted within these limits. Either the range within whichdirect interaction between a mind and a body is possible extendsbeyond the limits marked out by the relation of animation, or therelation of animation extends more widely than commonsenserecognises. The latter suggestion amounts to supposing that anembodied human mind may animate a material system whichincludes, in addition to one human body, parts of another humanbody which is animated by another human mind. This relationmight be mutual as between two human individuals A and B. A’smind might animate a material system which includes, beside whatwe call “ A’s body,” a part of what we call “ B’s body ”
; and B’smind might animate a material system which includes, beside whatwe call “ B’s body,” a part of what we eall “ A’s body.” In somecases of multiple personality it looks as if there were two mindssimidtaneously animating either the whole of a eommon brain andnervous system, or, at any rate, animating two parts of it whichoverlap each other. This at least supplies empirical support forthe general conclusion that the relation of animation between mindsand bodies is not always one-to-one. If two minds can animateone body, it may not be unreasonable to contemplate the possibilitythat one mind may animate one body and a bit of another body.
These speculations are, I know, very wild ; but I make no apologyfor them on that account. The admitted relation of animationbetween the mind and the body of a normal human individual, andthe admitted interactions between the two, are so mysterious thatwe are left with a wide field for legitimate conjectures. The situationis very different from that which faced us when we were consideringnormal sense-perception and alleged clairvoyance. We have a greatdeal of positive knowledge about normal sense-perception, in its
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 419
physical, its physiological, and its epistemological aspects ; so the
field for legitimate conjecture is there much narrower. Passing finally to the Theory of Direct Intermental Transaction,
we must, I think , assign to it the lowest antecedent probability of
the three typical theories. So far as I am aware, it is supported by
no known analog}’ with admitted facts. We should, therefore,
hesitate to resort to it unless the evidence rules out all theories of
the other two types.
Telepathic Cognition
We have so far considered the possible causal relations between
two embodied minds ; we must now turn our attention to what
primarily concerns us in this paper, viz., the possible cognitive relations between them. It is important to be quite clear that these are
different problems, for the word “ Telepathy ” seems often to be
carelessly used to cover both supernormal causal influence of one embodied mind on another and supernormal cognition of one embodied mind by another. We have given the name “ Telepathic
Interaction ” to the former, and we will call the latter “ Telepathic
Cognition.” Probably telepathic cognition would be impossible
without telepathic interaction, but there is not the least reason why there should not be telepathic interaction without telepathic
cognition. Cognising or being cognised, on the one hand, and
affecting causally or being affected causally, on the other, are utterly
different relations. If either of them can be analysed, which is
doubtful, it is certain that neither of them forms any part of the
analysis of the other. So there can be no logical impossibility in
two terms being related by one of them and not by the other. And,
if it be granted that two minds could influence each other telepathically at all, it is quite easy to imagme that two minds which
remained completely ignorant of each other might yet be ui fact
influencing each other frequently and profoundly by telepathic
interaction.
Having made this distinction clear, we can now turn our attention
to the cognition by one mind of another mmd and its experiences.
I shall begin by stating and explaining two principles which are commonly, if tacitly, assumed to apply to embodied human minds
and their normal cognitions. The first is that one and the same
experience cannot be owned by more than one mind. I do not think
that anyone would question this. It is true that we sometimes use
expressions which, if hterally interpreted, would imply that one and the same experience is owned by several minds. \\ e might, e.g., say of two people who both beheve that Francis wrote the Letters of
Junius that they both have the same behef about the authorship of
420 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthe Junius letters. But we all recognise at once that such state-ments are not to be taken hterally. One belief that Francis wrotethese letters occurs in A’s mind and not in B’s ; another belief thatFrancis wrote these letters occurs in B’s mind and not in A’s. Whenwe tall-: of the same behef occurring in two minds we mean that twobeliefs, which stand in a common relation to one and the same fact,viz., the actual but unknown authorship of the Junius letters, areoccurring, and that one belongs to one mind and the other belongsto the other mind. A similar interpretation would have to be puton any statement that seemed to conflict wfth our jjrinciple. Wewill call this the “ Principle of Unique Ownership of Experiences.”W e come now to the second principle. It may be stated as follows.Any particular existent which can be directly apprehended by anembodied mind can be dii’ectly apprehended only by one such mind.Let us consider what kinds of jjarticular existents a given embodiedmind M can directly apprehend. They are (i) M itself, perhaps ; (ii) some, if not all, of M’s experiences ; (iii) certain mental images ; (iv) somatic sensa connected with the jJi’Ocesses in M’s body ; and(v) certain visual, tactual, auditory, and other kinds of extrasomatic sensa. Of course the plain man would have included m thislist something which we have not included, viz., the surfaces ofcertain foreign bodies and of his own body, and certain kinds ofevents happening from time to time in such bodies. And he wouldnot have mentioned certani items which W’e have included, viz.,
various kinds of sensa. The cause of both these differences is thesame, viz., the fact that the plain man mistakes what he directlyapprehends in sense-perception for parts of physical objects andevents in such objects. We have seen that he does not directlyapprehend such particidar existents, and so we have had to excludethem from our list. But we have also seen that he really is apprehending particular existents of some kind in sense-perception, andso we have had to introduce them into our list under the technicalname of “ sensa.”
Now let us go through the list, and we shall see that, if it is ex- haustive, it proves our principle, (i) Everyone would agree thatnormally no embodied mmd but M could directly apprehend M.(ii) Everyone would agree that normally no embodied mind butM could directly apprehend any of M’s experiences, (iii) Everyonewould agree that normally no embodied mind but M could directly
aj)prehend any mental image that M can directly apprehend,(iv) Everyone would agree that normally no embodied mind but Mcould directly apprehend the aches and pains and pressure-data andso on which arise in connexion with processes in M’s body, (v) Asregards extra-somatic sensa a difference of opinion might arise, but
142 ] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 421
it would certainly be due to verbal confusion. A person might say : “ A noise is an extra-somatic sensum. Now we all know that M and
N may both hear the same noise. So N can directly apprehend an
extra-somatic sensum which is also being directly apprehended by
M.” There is nothing in this argument. When M and N are
correctly said to be “ hearmg the same noise ” each is directly apprehenduig a different auditory sensum. But these two auditory sensa
are related in a certain characteristic way to each other, and they
are manifestations of a common physical event at a remote common
source. When the fact that normal sense-perception is not really
prehensive ofexternal obj ects is clearly understood and firmly grasped,
and when the various verbal confusions which have arisen from its
being ostensibly prehensive have been removed, we see that there is
not the least reason to believe that, in normal life, N can ever directly
apprehend any sensum which M can directly apprehend, or vice versa. Now I thhik that, with the explanations which I have just given,
it will be admitted that the above list includes all the various kinds
of particular existents which any embodied muid, under normal
conditions, could directly apprehend. And we have now seen, with
regard to each of these classes of particulars, that any member of it which can be directly apprehended by any one embodied mind
M cannot, under normal conditions, be directly apprehended by any
other embodied mind. And so we reach our second general principle .
“ Any particular existent which can be directly apprehended by an
embodied mind can be directly apprehended only by one such mmd.”
I will call this the “ Principle of the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars.”
Before gomg further I will make some remarks on these two principles. (i) The Unique Ownership of Experiences is ui a much
stronger position than the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars. Many
people would say that it is self-evidently impossible that one and
the same experience should literally be an experience of two mmds,
no matter whether the minds were embodied or disembodied, in a normal or an abnormal condition, or what not. Without committing myself to this view, I must admit that it is highly plausible.
Now the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars, as a general principle,
is not in the least self-evident. We reached it simply by a process of
enumeration and inspection, and there is no apparent absurdity in
supposing that there might be exceptions to it. As we have seen commonsense does unhesitatingly take for granted that, in normal
visual perception, one and the same particular can be, and often is,
directly apprehended by several embodied minds. We rejected this,
not m the least because it seemed intrinsically absurd or impossible,
but because it was impossible to reconcile it with the relevant em-
422 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partpirical facts taken as a whole. The outcome of this comparisonbetween the two principles is that an alleged exception to the Privacyof Prehensible Particulars has an appreciable antecedent probability, whilst an alleged exception to the Unique Ownership ofExperiences has far less, if any at all.
(ii) Some people have held that images and sensa are themselvesexperiences. Many others, who have not gone so far as this, havetaken a view which may be roughly expressed as follows. Theyhave held that a mental image can exist only as a logically inseparable factor in someone’s experience of imaging it, and that a sensumcan exist only as a logically inseparable factor in someone’s experi-ence of sensing it. If either of these views were accepted, we couldreplace the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars by the followingprinciple ; “No embodied mind can directly apprehend anythingbut itself, its own experiences, and objects which are logically in-separable factors in its own experiences.” This principle does notseem to me to have any better claim to l)e self-evident than thePrivacy of Prehensible Particulars. And I am not convinced thateither of these two views about sensa and images is true. So 1prefer to keep the second principle in the form in which I originallystated it.
(iii) Some people have held that, whenever a mind has an experience, it directly apprehends that experience. Others have held that,whenever a mind has had. an experience, it could have directly apprehendcd that experience if it had attended, though it may not in facthave done so. If we accept either of these views, and combine it with the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars, the Unique Ownershipof Experiences follows as a logical consequence. For suppose, ifjmssible, that two minds, M and N, both owned a certain experienceE. According to the view under discussion M could or would directlyapprehend E, since E is an experience of M’s. Similarly, on theview under discussion, N coidd or would directly apprehend E,since E is also an experience of N’s. Therefore E could be directlyapprehended by two different minds, which is contrary to the Privacy of Prehensible particulars. So the supposition that E couldbe owned by two minds must be rejected if the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars is to be retamed and the view under discussion is to be accepted.
This result seems to me to be of logical interest rather than ofpractical importance. In the first place, the view that, whenever amind has an experience, it directly apprehends that experience, seems to me obviously false. And the view that, whenever a mmdhas had an experience, it could have directly apprehended thatexperience if it had attended, seems to me quite imcertain. Put,
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 423
even if one or other of these doctrines were indubitable, it would
still be a logical perversion to base the Unique Ownership of Experiences on it and the Privacy of Prehensible Objects. For, as we have
seen, the Unique Ownership of Experiences has some claim to be
self-evident, whilst the Privacy of Prehensible Objects has no such
claim. We should therefore be basing the stronger of two propositions on the weaker. I conclude then that the two principles are
best regarded as independent propositions.
(a) Telepathic Prehension
We have now stated, explained, and commented on the two principles which are assumed by commonsense to govern the region with
which we are at present concerned. We can look upon telepathic
cognition as mvolving a real or apparent breach of one or other of
these principles. Any breach of the Privacy of Prehensible Objects
would, ipso facto, be an instance of telepathic cognition. To be more
precise, it would be an mstance of what I will call “ Telepathic Prehension.” Under this heading would come the followmg five
possible cases, (i) One mind directly apprehendmg another mirid
as a unit, (ii) One mind directly apprehending an experience which
is occurring in another mind, (iii) One mind directly apprehending
a mental image which is being imaged by another mhid. (iv) One
mind directly apprehending a somatic sensum which is being sensed
by another mind and is the manifestation of a process going on in
the body which that other mmd animates, (v) One mind directly
apprehendmg a visual, tactual, or auditory sensum which is being
sensed by another mind in seeing, touching, or hearing an external
object. Telepathic prehension of the first kind seems to be clahned
for Mrs. Willett (see Lord Balfour’s paper, Proc. S.P.R., Part 140,
pp. 90-94). There are plenty of cases which look, prinia facie, as if they were instances of the four remaming kinds. Are they really so ? In considering this question the first point to notice is the following. A breach of the Unique Ownership of Experiences would not
be ipso facto an instance of telepathic prehension, for in itself it would not be an instance of cognition at all. It would best be
described as an instance of “ Intermental Confluence.” But, it intermental confluence were to take place, telepathic prehension
would almost certainly follow as an immediate consequence of it. Suppose, e.g., that, through mental confluence, N’s experience of
sensing a certain sensum or of imaging a certaui mental image were
also an experience of M’s. Then M woidd be sensing or imaging the
very same sensum or image which N is sensmg or imaging. Now
sensing and imagmg are instances of directly apprehendmg. So
M would be directly apprehending a sensum which N is sensing or
424 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partan image which N is imaging. And, of course, the converse wouldalso be true. So, if there were hitermental confluence of this kindbetween M and N, there would necessarily be telepathic prehensionof sensa or images by both M and N. This particular example canat once be generalised. If any experience which is a direct apprehension of a jiarticular were, through mental confluence, owned byboth M and N, M would be directly apprehending something whichN is directly ap>prehending, and conversely.
We have seen, however, that intermental confluence would beruled out by many people as self-evidently impossible. So we maynow put the following question. Supposing that we rule out intermental confluence, is there any need to assume that telepathic prehension occurs 1 It seems to me quite unnecessary to assume this inorder to account for successful experimental results in which oneperson conveys supernormally to another figures which he sees ordraws, images which he calls up and fixes, or bodily feelings whichhe is experiencing. All that we need to suppose here is a particularform of telepathic interaction. It is enough to suppose that theoccurrence ol a certain sensation or unagination or bodily feeling in
M s mind causally determines in N’s mind the occurrence of a sensation with a similar sensum, or of an imagination with a similarimage, or of a bodily feeling with a similar quahty and feeling-tone.
In experiments it may generally be assumed that N knows that it
is M, and no one else, who is trying to convey an impression to him.And it may generally be assumed that he knows roughly at what timeM is going to try the experiment. Suppose that, at about the agreedtime, N suddenly has a sensation or bodily feeling or becomes awareof an image. Suppose that there is no noticeable feature in N’ssurroundhigs at the time, or in his immediately previous train ofthought, which would supply an obvious normal explanation for theoccurrence of just this experience at just this moment. Then hewill naturally suspect that the experience is caused by M, whomhe knows to be experimenting at the time. So there is no needwhatever to assume that N has any telepathic prehension of
M or of M’s experiences, however successful such experimentsmay be.
So far as I can see, it is quite possible that each of us may be
often, or even continuously, influenced telepathically by other
minds, and yet this fact might always have escaped notice. Supposethat an event in M’s mind does in fact determine telepathically anevent in N’s mmd. N will have no reason to regard this as aninstance of telepathic interaction unless all the followmg conditions
are tulfilled. (i) The effect on N must take the form of an experience
which he can and does notice. Now the effect might equally well
142 ] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 425
be a change in his mental dispositions, or be an experience which
he does not or cannot notice.
(ii) Tills experience must be so discontinuous with his other con- temporary and immediately past experiences and with his usual
trains of association that he is surprised by it and is led to suspect
that it is not caused normally. Now this condition would seldom
be fulfilled. Very often I suddenly image an image, visual or auditory, which seems quite disconnected with my other contemporary
and immediately past experiences and with my usual trains of
association. But even I, who am professionally interested in such
things, tend to dismiss it as just one more unexplained oddity in
the workings of my mind. Most people are occupied for most of
their lives in practical dealings with other people and things ; so an experience of theirs would have to be very odd indeed before they
would seriously raise the question whether it was or was not caused
normally. Moreover, if an experience in N’s mind be telepathically
caused by an event in M’s mind, the event in M’s mind would never be the complete immediate cause of it. It would at most be one of the
immediate necessary conditions. Another, and equally necessary,
factor in the total immediate cause of this experience of N’s would
be the permanent dispositions, the acquired associations, and the
contemporary or immediately past experiences of N himself. There
is therefore no reason to beheve that most telepathically caused
experiences would be so outstanding and discontinuous as to attract
the special attention of the experient.
(iii) Even if N notices this experience with surprise, and is led
to wonder whether it may not be telepathically caused, he can get no further unless he can discover that, at about the same time, a
certain other person was having an experience which was specially
closely related to his own. Now this condition could not be fulfilled
unless all the followmg conditions were also fulfilled, (a) M, the
person who is in fact the telepathic agent in this transaction, would
need to be known to N, the telepathic patient, or they would need
to have common friends. Now it is obvious that M and N might be
complete strangers. (6) The event in M’s mind which telepathically
determined this exjjerience in N’s mind would have to be an experi- ence which M noticed and could describe to N or to their mutual
friends. Now the event might not have been an experience at all
;
it might have been a change in the dispositional structure of M s mind. Or the event might have been an experience which M did not
or could not notice, (c) There would have to be some specially inti- mate observable relation between M’s experience and N’s experience,
which would make it reasonable to single out the former as a factor
in the total cause of the latter. The only two relations that I can
426 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partthink of in this connexion are likeness and the relation of fulfilmentto intention. The first would hold if the two experiences were alikein quality or if they were jirehensions of similar objects. Thesecond would hold if M’s experience were that of intending to produce in N an experience of a certain kind, and if N’s contemporaryexjierience were in fact of the kind intended. Plainly there is notthe least reason to su])pose that either of these very sjjecial relationswould hold as a rule between the telepathic cause-factor and theexperience which it co-operates in producing. An effect may beextremely unlike every one of the factors in its immediate totalcause. And most telepathic interaction may be entirely unintentional.
The upshot of the above discussion is this. If telepathic interaction takes place at all, it may well be a very common occurrence.Put it will be noticeable only when a large number of independentand rather special conditions are simultaneously fulfilled. And,when these conditions are fulfilled, so that it does become noticeable,the experience which is telepathically produced in N will be veryliable to be mistaken for a telepathic prehension by N of that experi-ence of M’s which is its telepathic causal determinant. It is easy tofind analogies in the physical sciences to the situation which I havejust shown to be possible about telepathy. Consider, e.g., ordinarymagnetic forces, and the history of our knowledge of them. Suchforces occur whenever electric charges are moving or electric forcesare varying, and they pervade all space at all times and are profoundly important factors in the physical world. Yet they wouldhardly have been discovered had it not been for the happy accidentsthat the earth contains a good deal of the one element, viz., iron,
which is very strongly siisceptible to magnetic forces ; that it contains natural magnets, viz., lodestones ; and that it is itself a naturalmagnet. For centuries magnetism seemed to be a freak of naturewhich occurred exclusively in connexion with certain very specialkinds of matter. Yet in fact it was all the time operating everywhere. And the very sj^ecial characteristics which it displays inconnexion with iron and with permanent magnets, masked its realnature almost as much as they revealed it. I have now said all that seems necessary in support of my contention that experiments in telepathy, however successful they may be,would prove only telepathic interaction, of one or other of the threekinds which we distinguished as theoretically possible. They wouldnot force us to abandon the Privacy of Prehensible Particulars andto ])ostulate telepathic prehension. It remains to consider two otherkinds of ostensibly telejjathic phenomena, for which there is ampleevidence, some of which is of excellent quality. The first is spon-
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 427
I taneous telepathy, such as is reported iu Phantasms of the Living.
I The second is the supernormal knowledge which mediums often
display with regard to facts known to the sitter or to some other
: living person.
A good many cases of spontaneous telepathy can be regarded
as similar in princijrle to the cases of experimental telepathy which
I we have already considered. Suppose that M, sitting in his diningroom in a mood of intense depression, eventually takes poison,
suffers great bodily pain, and dies. Suppose that there arise in N’s
ij mind, through telepathic interaction, visual sensations or visual
|| imaginations very much like those which M is experiencing through
li normal visual perception of his surroundings. If N is familiar with
I M’s dining-room, his telepathically induced visual experiences will
!' naturally make him think of that room and of M. Suppose next
that there arises in N’s mind, through telepathic interaction, a
feeling of intense depression very much like that which M is experiencing because of illness, financial trouble, or some other normal
cause. It will be natural for N to connect together these two simultaneous abnormal experiences, and to suspect that there is some-
: thing seriously wrong with M. Suppose finally that there arises in N’s
mmd, through telepathic interaction, a sensation of intense bodily
pain very much like that which M is experiencing in consequence of
i the action of the poison on his body. It will be natural for N to
i assume that M must be very ill and perhaps dying. If N shoidd be
asleep or in a dreamy state when the telepathic interaction takes
place, it is extremely likely that the data supplied, and the normal
associations which they excite, will be supplemented by a great
deal of imagery. The whole thing may then be worked iip into a
vivid dream or waking hallucination, with the gaps filled in and the
inconsistencies smoothed out correctly or incorrectly. No kind of
telepathic prehension needs to be postulated here. Nothing need
be assumed except the special kind of telepathic interaction, which
we postulated to explain the experimental results, together with
the normal workings of pre-formed associations in N’s mind.
(6) Telepathic Discursive Cognition
1 It is doubtful whether all well-attested cases of spontaneous tele-
! pathy can be dealt with on these lines. And it is fairly certain that
this cannot be a right explanation of the supernormal knowledge
which mediums often display with regard to facts known only to
the sitter or to some other living person. We may best approach
the subject in the following way. There are at least two fundamentally different, though intimately connected, kinds of normal cognition, viz., prehensive and discursive. So far we have considered
428 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partonly the possibility of telepathic prehension, and we have found nodirect evidence for it. Now it looks as if the mediuniistic cases, andsome of the spontaneous telepathy cases, might involve telepathicdiscursive cognition. I will now explain these statements and consider whether there is reason to postulate such cognition.
The distinction between prehensive and discursive cognition is roughly identical with the familiar distinction between “ directlyapprehending ” and “ thinking about.” It is illustrated, e.g., by thedifference between actually hearing a set of noises which form a tuneand knowing or believing that this tune consists of a series of noisesof certain pitches and durations following each other in a certainorder. We may, of course, have discursive cognition about a particular which we are also directly apprehending ; and the ground ofour discursive cognition about it may be what is manifested to usin our prehension of it. But we can have discursive cognition aboutobjects which we are not at the time prehending, aboxit objectswhich we never have prehended, and about objects which we nevercould prehend. We can also have an experience which woidd properly be described as “ thinking of an x,” e.g., a dragon, or “ thinking of the y,” e.g., the King of the Fairies, although there may be nothing answering to the description “an x ” or the description “ they.” But it would be impossible to have an experience which wouldproperly be described as “ directly apprehending an x ” or “ directlya])prehending the y
” unless there were something answering to thedescription “ an x ” or to the description “ the y,” respectively.
Discursive cognition consists in either hnowing a fact or taking upone of a number of alternative cognitive attitudes towards a proposition which may be either true or false. Among these cognitive atti- tudes are included believing, disbelieving, opining, uncriticallyaccepting, supposing, and probably many others. All such cognitive attitudes towards a proposition equally presiippose a more fundamental cognitive experience which may be called “ entertaining ”the proposition. One and the same person may entertain the sameproposition on many different occasions, and he may take towardsit the same or different cognitive attitudes on different occasions.At one time he may doubt it, at another he may believe it, and so on.Again, several ])eople may entertain one and the same propositionon the same occasion, and they may take various cognitive attitudestowards it. Smith and Jones may both believe it, whilst Browndoubts it and Robinson disbelieves it. (In saying these things I donot mean to imply that there is a ])eculiar class of entities called“ propositions.” I thiidv it most likely that all the statements whichI have just been making could be restated without introducing theword “proposition” or any synonym for it. But the translations
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 429
would be extremely complicated and verbose. Tbe use of the word
“ proposition ” enables me to express in a reasonably simple verbal
form what everyone admits to be facts about discursive cognition.
No further excuse is needed for continuing to use it.) There is one other general fact of very great importance which we
must mention before we can profitably consider telepathic discursive
cognition. At any moment far the greater part of any man’s
“ knowledge ” or “ beliefs ” or “ opmions ” certainly does not take
the form of experiences of knowmg such and such facts or believing
or opining such and such propositions. The truth about him is that
he would have these experiences if he chose to direct his attention in a certain way, or if he were to be suitably stimulated. We may
express this by saying that, at every moment of our lives, much
the greater part of our knowledge, beliefs, and opinions consists of
relatively permanent dispositions to know certain facts or to believe
or opine certain propositions. It is always assumed that, to every
such relatively permanent cognitive disposition, there must corre- spond some relatively permanent actual existent. This is generally
supposed to be some actual modification of the structure of our minds or our brains, or to be some actual persistent unobservable
process in our minds or our brams.
It is as well to recognise that we know nothing at all about the
intrinsic nature of the actual existents which are supposed to corre- spond to our cognitive dispositions. We do not kiiow whether they
are persistent structural features or persistent Tinobservable processes. And we do not know whether they are modifications of our minds or our brains or of both or of neither. All that we know of
them is that they are produced and modified by our actual experiences, and that they are important factors in producing and modifying our experiences. There is very good reason to believe that the
actual existents which correspond to the various dispositions of
various kinds of nmiter are special peculiarities in the spatial arrangement and the motions of the ultra-microscopic particles of which
bodies are composed. But, unless we assume that the actual existents
which correspond to mental dispositions are themselves purely material, we cannot suppose that they are spatial arrangements or modes of
motion of ultra-microscopic particles. Now it is extremely difficult
to form any positive conception of purely mental structures or of nonintrospectible mental processes which could plausibly be supposed
to correspond to our mental dispositions. So we are between the
horns of the following dilemma. If we put the correlates of all mental dispositions into the bram, we get a theory which is famihar
and intelligible m outline but incredible when we come to consider
detail. If, on the other hand, we postulate mental structures and
430 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part
non-introspectible mental processes as the actual correlates of our mental dispositions, we have no clear idea of what we are postulating
and we run the risk of paying ourselves with words.
We are now in readiness to consider telepathic discursive cognition.
Suppose that M knows the fact F or entertains the proposition P.
The only normal way in which M’s knowledge of F or his entertaining
of P can cause another mind N to think of this fact or to entertain
this proposition is the following. ]\1 must express the fact or the
propiosition by uttering or writing a sentence which expresses it in
accordance with some conventional system of symbolisation. Nmust hear or see or in some other way perceive with his senses
either this spoken or vnitten sentence itself or some reproduction
of it, e.g., on a gramophone-record or in a book. Of course profound
physical transformations may take ])lace during the process which
intervenes between M’s utterance and the occurrence of the reproduction of it which N perceives ; but a fundamental identity of
structure must l)e preserved throughout, though it may be realised
in verv different media at different stages. This is well illustrated
by telephonic or wireless transmission of speech. Next, the sentence
which N eventually perceives must mean for him, in accordance
with some system of conventional symbolisation with which he is familiar, the same fact or proposition which M expressed by his
original sentence. If N perceives M’s sentence itself, it is essential
that he should lie familiar with the system of symbolic conventions
which M uses. If N perceives only a reproduction of M’s original
sentence, this condition need not be fulfilled, but another will have
to be substituted for it. M might express himself in French ; andN, who knows no French, might still l)e caused to entertain the proposition which M was entertaining provided that N perceives a
sentence which is an English translation of M’s sentence. But, in
that case, it is essential that there should have been a third person
T, familiar with both M’s and N’s systems of conventional symbolisation, who made a translation from one set of symbols to the other.
The following remarks are worth making at this stage, (i) M’s
knowledge of F or his entertainment of P may be an essential factor
hi causing N to think of F or to entertain P ; and yet N may have
no knowledge or thought of M or of M’s cognitions. If N perceives
and understands a sentence, and if he cares to reflect on the matter,
he will indeed recognise that some mind or other must have entertained the proposition which this sentence means and must have
expressed it in a sentence. And he will recognise that this event in
another mind must be a causal ancestor of his own entertainment
of this proposition. But N need not know or believe anything moredefinite about this other mind, (ii) Suppose that N perceives and
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 431
understands a certain sentence, and also knows that it was uttered
by M or is a reproduction of one of M’s utterances. N will then know,
or have very strong reason to believe, that the proposition which
he has been led to entertain has also been entertained by M. But
he may know nothing about M’s cognitive attitude towards this
proposition. If N has any beliefs on this subject, they may well be
mistaken ; as is abundantly proved by the occurrence of successful
lies and political propaganda, which are taken by the duped hearer
to express the knowledge or the beliefs of the lying speaker.
It is now easy to dehne the phrase “ Telepathically Induced
Discursive Cognition.” Suppose that a certain mind N thinks of a
fact F or entertains a proposition P at a certain moment. Suppose
that N would not have done this unless a certain other contemporary
mind M were knowing this fact or entertaining this proposition.
Lastly, suppose that M’s knowledge of F or his entertainmg of P
does not bring about N’s thought of F or his entertainment of P
by the normal process which we have just described Either M
never expresses the fact or the proposition in a sentence, or N never
perceives the sentence or any reproduction of it, or N cannot understand the sentence or the reproduction of it which he perceives. If
these conditions, positive and negative, were fulfilled, we should
say that N was having telepathically induced discursive cognition
of this fact or this proposition. And we should say that he was deriving this cognition telepathically from M’s mind. Now it looks
as if telepathically induced discursive cognition, m the sense just
defined, were involved in some cases of spontaneous telepathy between normal people and in many cases of trance-mediumship. Can
we say anything further about it ?
(i) I suspect that some people have at the back of their minds a
certain tacit assumption about the modus operandi of telepathically
induced discursive cognition. It may be stated as follows. Suppose
that N is cognismg a fact or a proposition, and that this cognition of
N’s is derived telepathically from M’s mind. Then, it is assumed,
N must be telepathically j^rehending M’s cognition of this fact or proposition. And in so doing, it is further assumed, N will ipso facto
be himself cognismg the fact or ^proposition which M is cogmsmg.
To sum up the theory in a sentence : “ N’s telepathically induced
cognition of what M discursively cognises depends upon N’s telepathic prehension of M’s experience of cognising.”
I should very much hesitate to accept this theory. In the first place, we have so far foimd no reason to admit the occurrence of
prehensive cognition by one mmd of exjperiences belonging to another
mind. Secondly, I would question the assumption that, if N
directly apprehended M’s experience of knowing the fact F or
432 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [partcognising the proposition P, he would ipso facto be himself cognisingF or P. It is, no doubt, true that a person could not directly apprehend his own experience of knowing a fact F or cognising a proposition P unless he were knowing F or cognising P. For, unless hewere knowing F or cognising P, there would be nothing answeringto the descri]hion “ his experience of knowing F or cognising P.”And, unless there were an experience answering to this description,he could not directly apprehend such an experience. But this argument will not lead to the desired conclusion if we apply it to N’sprehension of M’s cognitive ex])eriences. The only conclusion towhich it leads in this case is quite trivial. The conclusion is merelythat, if N directly apprehends M’s experience of knowing F orcognising P, then M must be knowing F or cognising P. The desiredconclusion is that N must be thinking of F or entertaining P. Andthis certainly does not follow.
Now, if the fallacy which I have just indicated is avoided, thereseems to be no reason to accept the assumption under discussion.
Why should not N directly apprehend an event, which is in factM’s experience of knowing F or cognising P, wdthout realising thatthe event which he is apprehending answers to this description ? And, if this is possible, why should N ipso facto think of F or entertain P ? It might be plausible to maintain that N could not directly apprehend an experience of M’s without ipso facto being aware of its psychological quality, e.g., without apprehending it as an experienceof knowing or as one of believing or as one of doubting, as the case might be. But it is not plausible to maintain that N could notdirectly apprehend an experience of M’s without ipso facto beingaware of its epistemological object, i.e., of the fact of which it is aknowing or of the proposition of which it is a believing or a doubting.
Yet, when telepathy takes place from M to N, the result is usually
that N cognises a fact or proposition which M is cognising, butremains unaware of the psychological quality of M’s cognitive
experience. So there seems to be very little to be said in favour of
the theory which we have been discussing.
Before we leave this theory there is one more remark to be madeabout it. If it were acceptable on other grounds, it could be applied
to explain the apparently telepathic prehension by N of images
which M is imaging or of sensa which M is sensing. The explanation
would, of course, take the following form. N, it would be said, tele- pathically prebends M’s experience of imaging the image I or sensing the sensum S. In doing this, it would be assumed, Nipso facto prebends the image I or the sensum S which is the object
of M’s experience. The general principle assumed is that, in pre-
142] Normal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 433
hending any experience which is itself a prehension of an object, one w’ould be ipso facto prehending its object. I see no reason to
accept this principle ; and I have already tried to show that the
results of experimental telepathy can be interpreted in quite a
different way, which involves telepathic interaction but does not
involve telepathic cognition.
(ii) I think that certain cases of telepathically induced discursive
cognition could be explained on the same lines as the simple cases of
experimental telepathy. Suppose that M knows the fact F or
cognises the proposition P. Although he does not utter or w'rite a
sentence which would express F or P in his own language, he may
image a series of auditory or visual images corresponding to such
a sentence. Certainly when I am thinking I often find myself doing
this. Suppose now that a series of visual or auditory images, similar
to these, were produced by telepathic interaction and imaged by
another mind N. If N knew’ the language in which these imagesentences are composed, he would automatically entertain the proposition or think of the fact which they express in that language.
He w’ould thus have been telepathically induced to entertain the
proposition which M is cognising or to think of the fact which M is knowing.
It must be noticed that this theory presupposes that N know’s the
language in which M would express himself if he were to speak
or to write. It therefore could not explain how an Englishman could
telepathically induce in a Frenchman, who knew no English, a
cognition of a fact w’hich the Englishman knows or a proposition
which he cognises. I do not know whether there is good evidence of
telepathically induced discursive cognition in such cases. It would
be a very important subject for experimental investigation.
(iii) Even if the explanation just proposed should be true of some
cases of telepathically induced discursive cognition, I do not thuik
that it could possibly cover all or most of them. In most cases it seems certain that the person from whom the cognition was tele- pathically derived was not thinking at the time of the fact or proposition concerned. And, if he was not thinkhig of it, he w’as a
fortiori not imaging a set of spoken or written words which would
express it in his ow’ii language. When N derives telepathically from
]\I a cognition of a fact w’hich i\I knows or a proposition which M
believes, it is not usually the case that M is actually having an
experience of knowing the fact or believing the proposition. Usually
IM’s knowledge or belief is at the time purely dispositional, as most
of our knowdedge and our beliefs are at every moment. It is possible,
of course, to evade this contention by saying that M must have been
“ unconsciously having an actual experience of know’ing the fact
434 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. PARTor of believing the proposition at the time when the cognition is telepathically induced in N. This, however, would be a whollygratuitous assumption, for which there is no independent evidence,and I shall ignore it. The position, then, seems to be this. Suppose that N telepathically derives from M a cognition of a fact F, which M knows, or of aproposition P, which M believes. Then the operative factor on M’sside will not as a nde be any actual cognitive experience which Mis having at the time. The operative factor on M’s side will usuallybe what we may call his “ potentiality of knowing F ” or his “ potentiality of believing P.” By M’s “ potentiality of knowing F ” I mean that persistent modification of structure or process, whateverit may be, which ensures that, whenever M is suitably stimulated bya reminder, he will have an actual experience of knowing F. ByM’s “ potentiality of believing P ” I mean that persistent modification of structure or process, whatever it may be, which ensures that,
whenever M is suitably stimulated by a reminder, he 'ftfill have anactual experience of believing P. I have already said that wn knownothing whatever about the intrinsic nature or location of these
assumed persistent modifications. We know them only as relatively
permanent after-effects of actual experiences, and as relatively
permanent cause-factors in producing and modifying subsequent
experiences. Let us call them “ Experientially Initiated Potentialities of Experience.”
Now the normal rule is this. Any such potentiality which is a
cause-factor in producing or modifying M’s later experiences has been
acquired from 31’s earlier experiences. I wish to point out that this
is merely an empirical ride based on normal experience. Since weknow nothing about the intrinsic nature or location of experientially
initiated potentialities of experience, we cannot possibly see any kind
of necessity in this or any other rule about them. It is logically
possible that a potentiality which is an after-effect of M’s past
experiences should be a cause-factor in producing or modifying, not
only M’s future exjieriences, but also those of N. Many cases of
telepathically induced discursive cognition seem to suggest that this
logical jjossilulity is in fact sometimes realised.
Let us begin by considering normal thinking. Here, as we have
said, the only experientially initiated potentialities which affect a
person's later experiences are those which were initiated by his oivn
earlier experiences. In low-grade thinking, such as day-dreaming,
it would seem that some one potentiality is activated by some very
contingent experience of the thinker, and that this then activates
another, and this in turn another, and so on, in an almost automatic
way dependent on association by contiguity, similarity, etc. The
142] Normal Cognitio7i, Clairvoyaiice, and Telepathy 435
result is a series of thoughts or images which have very little logical
interconnexion ; though the thinker himself, if he reflected on them,
or a psychologist, if he performed a psycho-analysis, might be able
to conjecture why the experiences had followed each other in this
particular order. If, on the other hand, the person is actively pursuing a directed train of thought on some deflnite problem, those
potentialities which would give rise to experiences relevant to the
problem will tend to be stimulated and those which would give rise
to experiences irrelevant to the problem will tend to be kept quiet.
Even here the potentiality which would give rise to an experience
highly relevant at a certain stage m the process often fails to be
activated at the appropriate moment. And potentialities which
give rise to irrelevant or misleading experiences often do get activated. Even when a process of thinking, directed to solving a certain
problem, is eventually successful, the thoughts which are the stages
in this process seldom arise in their proper logical order. The right
logical order usually comes as a result of retrospective reflexion on
the process by the thinker, followed by an act of rearrangement.
The point which I want to emphasise now is the followmg. W hen
normal directed thinking is contrasted with normal low-grade thinking, it may fairly be called a
“ volmitary ” process. And it may
fairly be said that the thinker “ deliberately selects,” out of the mass
of potentialities of experience w'hich his past experiences have
initiated, those which would give rise to relevant exjieriences if they were stimulated. But it is most important not to be deceived
by such phrases. W e must not imagine that the thinker pierceives the
various potentialities of experience, as a man might perceive a lot of
ties and socks and shoes and pullovers in his bedroom, and then deliberately activates a certam selection fro7n them, as a man might deliberately put on a certain tie, a certain pair of socks, a certain pair of
shoes, and a certain pullover, in order to produce a certain colour
scheme. The following analog may make the fallacy quite plain.
When the process of constructing a machine wdth one s hands is contrasted with bluiking or jerking one’s knee, it may fairly be called a
“ volimtary ” process. And it may fairly be said that the agent
“ deliberately selects,” out of a mass of potentialities of movement
derived from his past bodily actions, those which would give rise
to the relevant overt movements if stimulated. But he certainly
does not perceive his own motor-nerves and muscles, select certain
of the former, and decide to send such and such nervous impulses
down the former in order to activate the latter in such a way as to
make his Angers move as he wants them to do. He is perceiving
and thinkmg of nothing but his hands and the materials with which
he is working. He is desiring nothing but to make certain compli-
436 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part:
cated movements with his hands against the resistance of the materials. This autoniutically
,
and m ways utterly unknown to him,| sets up unfelt processes in unperceived nerves. And, in the main,these are in fact the appropriate processes in the appropriate nerves ; since, in the main, the expected and desired overt movements result.To imagine that a thinker literally selects and deliberately activatesthose potentialities of experience which are relevant to the problemthat he is trying to solve is like imagining that a manual workerliterally contemplates his own brain and nervous system as if it were a complicated switch-board and deliberately presses such andsuch buttons. The thinker or the manual worker wills that a certainprocess of thought or bodily action shall take place ; and automatically, in ways unknown to him, his volition initiates and sustains, among unobservable entities, unobservable processes whichdo ill fact tend to bring about the desired process of thought orbodily action.
I have insisted upon this point about normal thinking because it has an important bearing upon telepathically induced thinking. Itseems to me that there are two ways in which we are liable to makeneedless difficulties for ourselves in connexion with this subject.(i) W e tacitly assume that potentialities of experience initiated byM’s experiences must be located in M’s brain or in M’s mind ; andsimilaily, mutatis mutandis, for A and for each other individual.(ii) M e tacitly assume that, wffieii a certain set of co-existent potentialities of experience are activated in such an order as to give rise
to a certain coherent train of thought in M s mind, M must have con-templated a whole mass of co-existent potentialities and must havedeliberately selected and activated this particular sub-group. Thenwe are faced with telepathically intluced discursive cognition. Wethereupon raise such rpiestions as these. How can N contemplate potentialities of experience which are located in M’s brain or in M’smind ? How can N select from these just that sub-group which is relevant to his own problem at the moment ? How can N activatethis sub-group located in M’s mind or brain ? And, if N does this,
why are the corresponding exjieriences produced in N’s mind andnot in M’s ? Now these difficulties are at least lightened by the two followingconsiderations, (i) Even it the potentialities of exjierience which areinitiateil by M’s experiences are located in M’s mind or M’s brain,there is not the least reason to suppose that N would have to con-template them and deliberately activate a certain selection of them.For we have seen that this is certainly not the way in wffiich the set of potentialities which are relevant to a normal train of thought areactivated by the mind in which that train of thought occurs.
142] Norynal Cognition, Clairvoyance, and Telepathy 437
(ii) We have very little ground for assuming that the potentialities
of exjjerience which are initiated by Ws experiences are located in
M’s mind or in M’s brain. If I say that an actual experience is located in M’s mind, I know what I mean. I mean that it is one of
M’s experiences, and I know perfectly well what it is for a certain
experience to belong to, or occur in, a certain mind. But experientially initiated potentialities of experience, whatever they may be, are certainly not themselves experiences. MTien I say that a certain
acquired potentiality of experience is located in M’s mind this can
only be an abbreviated way of sapng that it was produced by a past
experience of M's and that it is a cause-factor in producing or modifying later experiences of M’s. If the statement means anything more than this, I have no idea what it means. If, on the
other hand, I say that it is located in M's brain, I must mean that it
is a more or less persistent modification in the spatial arrangement
or the movements of the ultra-microscopic particles in some part of
M’s brain. Xow there are well-kno^\m empirical facts about the
loss of a person’s normal memories through injuries to his brain and
his subsequent recovery of these memories which make it very
difficult to accept this view of experientially initiated potentialities of
experience. So the statement that potentialities of experience in- itiated by M’s experiences are located in M’s mind seems to be either
metaphorical or meaningless ; and the statement that they are located in his brain, if taken as the whole truth, seems to be difficult
to reconcile with admitted facts about the effects of brain-injuries on normal experience.
We must therefore consider seriously the possibility that each
person’s experiences initiate more or less permanent modifications
of structure or process in something which is neither his mind nor his
brain. There is no reason to suppose that this Substratum would
be ami:hing to which possessive adjectives, such as “ mine ” and
“ yours ” and his ” could properly be applied, as they can be to
minds and to animated bodies. The situation would be this. The
modifications which are produced in this common Substratum by
M’s experiences normally affect only the subsequent experiences of
M ; those which are produced in it by X's experiences normally
affect only the subsequent experiences of X. But in certain cases
this normal camsal ” self-confinement,” as we might call it, breaks
down. l\lodifications which have been produced in the Substratum by
certain of M’s past experiences are activated by X's present experi- ences or interests, and they become cause-factors in producing or modifying X’s later experiences.
As we know nothing about the intrinsic nature of experientially
initiated potentialities of experience, we cannot say an}d;hing definite
438 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part 142]about the intrinsic nature of the common Substratum of which wehave assumed them to be modifications. As there is no reason whatever to think that such potentialities of experience are, or could be,themselves experiences, there is no reason whatever to supposethat the Substratum is a mind. On the other hand, it could hardlybe any particular finite body. It does not seem impossible that it should be some kmd of extended pervasive medium, capable ofreceiving and retaining modifications of local structure or internalmotion. But I do not thinlv that we have at present any adequatedata for further speculations about its nature.

A PROXY CASE EXTENDING OVER ELEVEN SITTINGS
WITH MRS OSBORNE LEONARD
By C. Drayton Thoma,s
FOREWORD
The following letter by Mr H. Hatch vouches for the accuracy of
statements made in this narrative.
Thornton House,
58 Hibson Road,
Nelson, Lancs. March 11, 1935.
Perhaps some matters in this book will be clearer if I explain my
connexion with Bobbie. I am his mother’s stepfather, but he lived in my home all his short life. His own father only knew him when a baby
and I looked upon Bobbie as my son, and he thought of me as his father.
I ought to say also that I have no connexion with Spiritualism, that
I have taken an Honours degree in Science, and that I have spent most
of my life in teaching science and in writing text-books.
I am perfectly certain that the evidence proves that knowledge of
facts and places was obtained in some abnormal way—how, it is for
psychic researchers to say.
Fraud is quite out of the question. As explained in the book, none
of the facts, places or people were known to either the sitter or the
medium. I was most careful in my letters to make no statements other
than comments on evidence already given.
Chance coincidence is an equally absurd theory. Consider some of
the names given. “ Bentley ” (96) was given as a place name—a clue to the “ pipes ” ; actually Bentley Street is one minute’s walk from my
home in that direction. “ Catelnow ” (140) is given as a place near by ; actually Catlow is a hamlet some two miles away to which Bobbie and
I walked on the last occasion he left the house before his death. Are not
2g 439
440 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe chances against correct guessing in each case thousands to one, andtherefore millions to one in combination ?
I would direct particular attention to the statements about the photograph of Bobbie with “ a board in front ” and “ a round thing withouta peak ” on his head (34 and 35). The chances against correct guessinghere seem to me to be so high as to make the theory absurd.
Telepathy can only be an explanation if by that vague term one heremeans the power of the medium to read the subconscious thoughts of]ieople (1) whom she did not know, (2) of whose locality in Britain shehad no idea, (3) who did not know when the sittings were in progress,(4) who were actually over 200 miles distant. I suggest that this hypothesis is too far-fetched.
I wish to say that all the statements of fact made by Mr DraytonThomas are absolutely true. I shall be glad to answer any questionsrelating to them.

143] ^4 Proxy Case 441
INTRODUCTION
In the Proceedings of our Society for May 1933 there is an account
of some proxy sittings with Mrs Osborne Leonard which I took on
behalf of various applicants. Two or three sittings were given to
most of these cases, but in the experiment now to be described there were eleven sittings and the series extended over many months.
The longer opportunity for accumulation of material may in some
measure account for its better quality. It is possible that, had I given more sittings to each of the cases above mentioned, the results
would have been better.
Although the present case concerns a young boy it was said that
he was helped by others : it may have been owing to their ex])crience
and suggestion that the child was able to select so much appropriate
material. The subject of chief interest in this study was not originated by the boy, but by my regular communicators. The ojiinion
expressed by them as to the cause of the boy’s death is highly important ; firstly because it had been suspected by no one on earth,
and secondly because we were unable, for several months after the
clues were given, to trace any connexion between the boy’s illness
and its asserted origin.
This therefore merits special consideration and will form the
subject matter of Part II, for which all relevant material is reserved.
I shall, however, indicate in Part I the place in each sitting where
reference was made to this topic.
The first sitting introduces the baffling subject of psychometry.
It is rarely that I have tried this with Mrs Leonard, but I haj)pened
to do so on this occasion. The psychometrising was of doubtful
assistance ; for although Feda (Mrs Leonard’s Control) seemed to
begin with pure psychometry this quickly changed into the familiar
type of message. Feda meanwhile was apparently uncertain
whether the information came to her by means of the article, or
direct from some imseen communicator.
The series affords illustration of problems connected with trance
mediumship which still await final solution. Prominent among
these is the question of wodws operandi and the fact that information
which one could express in a few sentences will often emerge in
diffused and extended form. Whether the cause is to be sought in
telepathy, imjjerfect clairaudience, the medium’s inhibitions, or the
communicator’s difficulty with memory—or various combinations
of these—one would much like to ascertain. It is my ho].>e that the
material here provided may be useful to those studying such
questions, and may directly or indirectly help toward a solution.
442 C. Drayton Thomas [partI am grateful to Mr Hatch and Mrs Newlove for allowing me togive their names and postal address. This will enable anyonewishing to make further enquiries to go to headquarters, and it disposes of the objection which might otherwise arise that the wholeof this story would seem to depend upon my unsupported word. Ithappened that Mr Besterman and Mr Gerald Heard were presentat Sitting No. 6, and heard Feda give the remarkably correctdescription of a route which would lead towards the locality wherethe mysterious “ pipes ” were said to be.
Part I consists of a slightly abbreviated record of the twelvesittings, with verifications and an analysis of results.
Part II gives a complete story of the “ pipes ” problem.
Part HI is a numerical analysis of successes and failures.
Part IV is an inquiry into Telepathy and the modus operandi oftrance messages.
Feda is the name of Mrs Leonard’s Control.
John my father, and Etta my sister are my regular communicators.
C. D. T. are my initials and will indicate my part in dialogue withFeda.
Readers will be able to place theh own valuation upon the evidential material of these sittings, but in the table appended to eachsitting will be found the mark given by me. The name of the child from whom I was seeking information wasBobbie Newlove ; he will be called Bobbie in these records. Hismessages of affection and all personal matter which has no definitely
evidential value will be omitted, as also his descriptions of the life heis living in the Beyond. We shall confine ourselves strictly to evidence which can be tested.
Much of the material connects with the boy’s memories, whilesome of it relates to his opinions, or to things he was said to haveobserved since his passing. These items I distinguish by M. formemories, and by 0. for opinions or observations. Feda, John andEtta occasionally offered opinions.

Ix September 1932 I received a letter from a stranger, a l\Ir Hatch.
He wrote from Nelson, a town 200 miles distant, of which I had no
knowledge other than the fragmentary memories of having once
lectured there ten years before.
Here are relevant portions of the letter.
For ten years my stepdaughter has lived with me and my wife, and
her little boy has been the life and centre of our lives. He was particularly intelligent and extraordinarily loving and lovable. A few weeks
ago he died suddenly of diphtheria, aged ten. The loss is so dreadful that
we feel we must ask if you can in any way obtain comfort similar to that
recounted in your book. Life Beyond Death.
I discouraged expectation of receiving messages ; it seemed to me
that this boy would be too young to make a successful communicator. Meanwhile the family remained unaware, until receiving
extracts from the first sitting, that I was attempting (by methods
previously successful in similar cases) to make contact with the child.
It was in these circumstances that I took the letter to my sitting of
November 4, 1932.
At an appropriate moment during the sitting I said to Feda, “ I have a very earnest request for news of a little boy, Bobbie Truelove ”. (By a slip of memory I gave the surname wrongly, it should
have been Newlove. It will be noticed that I corrected this at the
begiiming of the third sitting.) I then suggested that Feda should
hold the letter. She accepted the idea. Needless to say I had folded
it in such a way that no uiforniation could be ascertamed by glancing
at it. Added to this I watched carefully during the few minutes it was in the medium’s hands, and observed that her eyes did not open.
I will now set out Feda’s remarks consecutively, adding the
comments received from the family.
First Sitting, November 4, 1932.
(1) Feda : Isn’t there a name connected with them beginning with
a
‘ T ’ 1 When I said that I did not know, Feda added that it was an
“ important name ”. The family’s comment on this was that Bobbie
loved his mother to call him by a pet name beginning with the
letter ‘ T ’.
It is mifortunate that in so many cases Feda gives only the initial letter instead of the full name. In the present case there is nothing
444 f\ iJrai/to)) Thomas I'PAIIT
to make one sure tliat Bobbie’s pet name was lacing attempted ; ontlie. otlrer hand, an attemj^t to announce this name would be quite
natural in the circumstances. As we shall shortly see, Feda had theimpression that the child was actually present.
(2) Feda ; Will you find out whether this l)oy had had a pain in his
hand. I felt such a funny pain in the hand while touching this
letter. As the medium was holding the letter I assumed that psychometrywas in progress. If so, then the pain in the hand would presumablyrefer to the writer and not to Bobbie himself. I learned on enquiryhowever, that the writer, Mr Hatch, did not recognise this as applying to himself, but that Bobbie, who had always been a delicate
child, occasionally lost the use of the right hand after a bout of
excessive laughter ; at such times he did not complain of pain, buthe was unable to use the hand for writing while the condition lasted.
(3) Feda ; I am also getting a name beginning with ‘ M ’, it sounds
like Mar— something, connected with this letter too ... Is there a name in or on this letter starting with ‘ M ’ ? One is left in doubt as to what may have l)een intended by this
reference to Mar—. The first comment I received was as follows ; “ Yes, Bobbie’s godmother, whom he loved, I think, more than
anyone outside the family circle, is named Marie.”
There is, however, no doubt that Bobbie’s thoughts had often
reverted to a child named Marjorie, whom he had frequently metand who had made a great impression on him. There will be several
references to this on later pages. Neither this name, nor any other
commencing with ‘ M ’, was mentioned in the letter I had received.
Feda was not sure of the source of these ideas ; for, in relation to
this name, she added : “ I think I am getting that from the letter, or it may be in the thought of the person who wrote the letter to
you.” The phrase, “ It sounds like Mar— ”, certainly seems to
suggest clairaudience and not psychometry.
(4) Feda ; The little boy has been trying to get in touch with them
before.
[His people wrote : “ We have had very vague messages from local mediums.”] ^
(5) Feda : You said a few weeks since he j)assed over, Feda feels it would be several months now.
^ Short comments interspersed between quotations from the record of the
sittings are in square brackets. These comments, unless there is some state- ment to the contrary, are based upon information received from Mr Hatch or Mrs Newlove, either in letters or verbally when I made their acquaintance
during my visits to Nelson in June and July 1933.
143 ] J Pro.rti Case 44.")
[1 was iul'omied that the child had died some three months before this
sitting, i.e. on August 12, 1932.]
(6) Feda ; Glands ; ask if he had anything the matter with his glands.
When I get anything like that it helps to find out if I am getting
the right one. [Mr Hatch replied : “ I do not know whether the glands are affected
in diphtheria, but it is probable.”
I was equally ignorant, but on referring to books, discovered, as did
Mr Hatch, that the glands are affected by diphtheria. So this point,
which had been neither in my mind nor in Mr Hatch’s, was correct.]
(7) Feda : All boys are fond of cakes and things, but a little while
before he passed over I get such a feeling of a lot of cakes and
cooking going on as if for some special occasion.
[This is vague. The only fact at all relevant is that, at some time
within six months of passing, Bobbie and a friend, after having studied
a cookery book, had a grand toffee-making.]
(8) Feda : Do you know if he was connected with a town, not London
but a town, not one of the biggest in the provinces ? [This was, as I knew, correct for Nelson where Bobbie had lived.]
(9) Feda : Is there something to do with a place—does anybody go
there to do some special study, not like Oxford or Cambridge,
Eton or Harrow.
C. D. T. : No, it is a manufacturing town.
Feda : The studying they are doing is not so much of a scholastic
kind. It is more as if they are learning to do something in a
practical way.
C. D. T. ; And who is this that is studying ? Feda : Somebody connected with the boy, like making a study of
how to make something, like specialising in the making of something, not just making it and turning it out with a machine, but
a kind of study of it. [After a short break this subject was continued, see below.]
(10) Feda : It is a busy place, but not one of the very biggest of those
towns. I don’t think you would call it the biggest of those towns,
and yet it is a largish place where they are concentrating on
important things.
C. D. T. : I should say that is correct, so far as I know.
[Mr Hatch wrote : “ This is unquestionably an accurate description
of Nelson.”]
(11) Feda : Do you know if some manufacturing places are on the banks
of a canal or river there ? It does not feel pretty enough to call a river because of the buildings and the things on the side of it. [There is a river and a canal, and there are factories on the banks of
the river. Bobbie knew both river and canal.]
Feda : (Resuming previous theme 9). Oh, are they partly making
some stuff, there in this place, is it earthenware or pottery, some-
44(5 ('. Drayton IVioma.s [part
i
t hing like stone '! I think they are making more than one tiling
there, but I do get a feeling of something being made of a hard | nature, something like stone, something is being put together,
I get a feeling of it lieing put together very closely in lumps ; it i
is not steel or iron or metal, it is more like things being made,
and I think it is rather a new industry.
[i\lr Hatch replied : “ Bobbie had a great friend who is a working
man engaged usually in making mortar and cement. He took a great
interest in the boy and was most distressed when he died. Later he
suggested that he should make a concrete cross for the grave. Wethankfully agreed, feeling that work with real love behind it was better
than anything bought from a monumental mason. This friend has never made one before and had to ‘ make a study of how to make something.’ ”]
Readers will feel that this is not convincing. When, however,
after the conclusion of these sittings, I visited Nelson and met the
person above alluded to, Mr Burrows, and saw the grave—the cross not yet erected, but blocks of concrete making a curb with a concrete
platform round the grave, and noticing that the concrete was madein small portions fitted together,—I realised how apposite had been
the above description. Mr Burrows will be mentioned hereafter.
Bobbie greatly admired him ; for, in addition to teaching Bobbie
gymnastics and boxing, Mr Burrows was the professional at the
skating rink, and Captain of the Rink Hockey Club.
It is only my fear that readers will not be in a position, at this
point, to share my opinion that Feda’s remarks actually apply to
the concrete-and-cement work around Bobbie’s grave, that restrains
me from pointing out in detail how clear it is that Feda did not knowwhat it was she was describing. But it is unwise to build uponinadequate foundations, and there wdll be other opportunities, as we])roceed, for illustrating this fact, namely, that the mind originating
the message is not Feda’s and that Feda is frequently unable to
realise what it is that she is describing. There is abundant evidence
indicating that Feda’s part is simply to transmit from one who knowsthe facts, and w'ho is trying amid difficulties to convey information
which can be recognised by those for whom it is intended.
(12) Feda : These people are not very poor and not very rich, sort of
between people ; I think they have a comfortable home and nice
surroundings—the family of the boy.
[This remark was accepted by Mr Hatch as a correct description.]
(13) Feda : Ask them if the boy’s neck or throat was affected. I keep on getting something about that.
[The diphtheria affected the boy’s neck and throat, but he hadpreviously been troubled with enlarged tonsils which would have lieen operated upon had Bobbie been less delicate.]
143 ] 447
Mr Hatch’s reaction to this first sittmg may be judged from the
following passages which I extract from his letter of comments.
“ There certainly seems more in the above than coincidence would
explain. Yet do you not think that psychometry, while showing that the
mind of the medium has certain unknown powers, is yet no evidence of
survival ? If Bobbie were trying to communicate I cannot believe that
he would refer to any of the matters mentioned. Still, as you say, it is a foundation, and if you will be good enough to try again we shall indeed
be grateful. “ I have heard it said that those who are desperately anxious for
evidence are very credulous. I do not think it is so with me. My fear
is lest I should be deceived by evidence that can be explained by some
other faculty of the mind, perhaps one that has not been investigated
as yet.”

Second Sitting, November 18, 1932. ,(14) A previous weakening. (See Part 11.) ![This is the first of 33 references to the subject discussed in Part II,
jThe Problem of the Pipes. It seemed better to deal with them as a whole iand so I have removed them from among the miscellaneous matter of
the sittings. The position of each is shown as above, by number and a
t)rief indication of contents.
The valuation marks are included in the analysis at the end of each
sitting.]
(15) Peda : Etta thinks he had a good constitution as children go. [Mr Hatch says that Bobby had not a good constitution but was;always frail.]
(16) Feda : He seemed rather a lively boy and he was not what Etta
jwould call a naughty boy in temperament, he was a boy who waswhat you would call “ all there ”. He had a very nice nature,
and though he was quite a boy he could be, and was, very affectionate too ; she says, I think his mother would say “ yes ”
to that. Many boys are so undemonstrative, but this boy wouldjbe very affectionate. ji[It should be noted that it is Etta who says, “ I think that he had a jgood constitution as children go.” This seems to have been an inference 'of hers and therefore the mistake is less important than would have been
a misstatement made by Bobbie himself. The rest of the paragraph is correct. Bobbie was very lively, very good, and particularly affectionate.] i(17) Feda : He was very appreciative of his mother and his relations |and his home life. [Mr Hatch writes ; “ This is all true.”]
(18) Feda : There was a little girl that this boy was very fond of.
(19) Does the girl’s name begin with ‘ J ’ ? I keep seeing a
‘ J ’.
J. G. and P.
(20) There is a girl’s name beginning with ‘ G ’
; there are really
two names beginning with ‘ G ’ connected with him. One is a proper name and the other is a little made-up name, a pet name.[“ A little girl he was fond of ” : Yes, Marjorie, a child of twelve whowas a semi-professional at the skating rink. There will be several
further allusions to her, usually by the letter ‘ M ’. Feda here seems to have assumed that because the letter ‘ J
’ cameafter the reference to a girl it was therefore the girl’s name ; andsimilarly with the name ‘ G ’. The initials are all quite relevant, however.
‘ J
’ and ‘ P ’
: Jack and Peter were two of Bobbie’s special friends.
The two names ‘ G ’ may refer to his mother, whose name is Gwendoline,
but often called in the family Gennie.]
I4:i] ,4 Proxy Case 441)
(21) Feda : There is a rather elderly gentleman he is very iVmd of. Etta
thinks it is someone he regarded as a relation, I am sure too old
to be the father.
[Mr Hatch says that this may refer to himself. Mr Hatch is older than
Bobbie’s father and is step-father to Bobbie’s mother.]
(22) Feda : I understand he had given him something the boy was very
pleased about only shortly before he passed over. [Mr Hatch frequently gave things to Bobbie, but remembers nothing
to which this would specially aqiply.]
(23) Feda : Had this gentleman taken out something in the boy’s name
that would be of monetary advantage to him later on, putting
something on one side for him that would have been useful to him later. [Not understood. They gave Bobbie money for his Savings Certificate at school, but cannot think of anything further to which this would
apply.]
(24) Feda : There was something that Bobbie was very interested in,
but I don’t quite understand. He had been allowed to build
something. I think he was not doing it alone, he was going to do
it with another young person ; it seems as if he was going to build something. It felt to me like building an outhouse, but he
seemed too young for such an interest. There was something of
that kind being done in which he was very interested and going
to take his part. It is one of the things he would have wanted
to talk about if he had been on the earth.
[With a boy friend, Bobbie had planned to build a glider—an impracticable scheme, but one upon which, for a time, he had worked with
much enthusiasm. His mother allowed the boys to do this in the
scullery. Note : Etta says, “ It felt to me like building an outhouse,
something of that kind ”. Did she confuse the scullery with the object
under construction there ?]
(25) Feda ; He was fond of someone who was attached to a school.
[This might refer either to one of Bobbie’s teachers, or to Mr Hatch,
to whom he was much attached ; Mr Hatch teaches in a school.]
(26) Feda : And he sent his love to someone whose initial was ‘ M ’,
I don’t mean his mother. It is a woman, that is to say, it is a female name.
[This is highly appropriate for his godmother, of whom he was very
fond and with whom he had stayed in London. She was always alluded
to as “ Auntie Marie ”. Alternatively, it might mean the little girl
Marjorie, above mentioned, to whom Bobbie was much attached.]
(27) Feda : Someone called Joyce he liked. [Two years back Bobbie had known a Joyce, but the family do not
think it likely he would name her in this connection. There were others
4r)(j C. J)r(ii/lo)i Thovuifi (partof that name whom he knew' at his co-education school, also others
among the Brownies ^ with whom he was acquainted.]
(28) Feda : He was very pleased at winning something not very long
before he passed over. [Not long before he died Bobbie was pleased at being top of his formfor the half-year’s examination, as well as for the term’s marks.
Nine weeks before his death Bobbie won, in a competition, a salt- sifter shaped like a dog. This article gave him much pleasure. Hecalled it his “ bow-wow ”. (See Fig. II.) It will be referred to later : see Nos. 54, 56, 61.]
(29) Feua ; Etta says he was very fond of something which he did notdo by himself ; and it seemed to do with numbers, as if he playedwith something with numbers on, and he used to take turns withit. Whatever this was with numbers he used to like to do something with curved lines, grooves and curved lines and numbers : he used to do this after tea, it occupied some time after tea. [At a recent Fair he was particularly successful w'ith one of the automatic machines from which he won pennies by shooting into numberedcircles. “Not by himself”; he was always accompanied there byothers and of course would take his turn at the machine and not monopolise it. “ After tea ” : he did this several times during eveningsafter tea.]
(30) Feda : He played indoors with coloured marbles, it was somethingthey did on a table. [Yes, he played a game with coloured marbles and a card pattern onthe table.]
(31) Feda : They had been trying to make something—this is nothingto do with what I said about building—they had been doingsomething intricate in the house that Bobbie was interested in,
they got a lot of parts for it, like fixing them all up together.
They were wanting some other 2>arts for it not long before Bobbie2)assed over. [Mr Burrows was fitting up a gymnasium for Bobbie and it was notyet finished. They still required a horizontal ladder and other items.
It was being made in an upstairs room and Mr Burrows added to it each
time he called. Bobbie’s diary has the follow'ing references : March 31. The instructor came and put u^) two parts of gymnasium.May 10. Instructor came and fixed up parallel bars. June 15. Got bellbar for gym.]
(32) Feda : Was he interested in rabbits 1
1 For the information of foreign readers the name “ Brownies ” may be
explained as the junior branch of the Girl Guide organisation. Its chief aims
are the building up of good character and bodily health. Brownies have their counterpart for boys in the well-known Boy Scout movement, whose younger
members are called Wolf Cubs.
143 ] ^4 Proxy Case 451
[Yes, Bobbie frequently visited Mr Burrows’ garden, and when there was interested in the rabbits kept by a neighbour close by.]
(33) Feda : I think he will come again and let me see him. I feel he is a bit on the dark side, not a fair boy.
[No, the boy was decidedly fair. Feda’s idea, which she seems to have
obtained by feeling rather than by sight, was wrong.]

C. D. T. ; Have they been able to bring Bobbie Newlove ? Feda : You mean Truelove, don’t you ? C. D. T. : I made a mistake, the name is Newlove. Let us call himBobbie. Have they brought him ?
(34) Feda : Yes, and they thought about passing over a few messages.What is that you are showing me ? Will you ask is there aphotograph of Bobbie in a rather peculiar position 1 I see himfull faced, or very nearly full faced, but with something in frontof him, as if there is a board in front of him. It is as if he hadbeen photographed sitting at the back of something, like at theback of a board or a tray or something. In the position heseemed to be leaning a bit forward towards the tray or board orwhatever it is, I get a feeling of a crouching position.
[Mr Hatch writes : “ This is certainly remarkable. The last photograph we have of Bobbie is in fancy dress. He is the Jack of Heartswith boards back and front like a sandwich-man. On his head is acrown as in a pack of cards. It is wrong that he was sitting or crouching,he was standing erect (see Fig. I.).”
One is uncertain whether Feda was given a visual impression of thisparticular photograph or whether she received Bobbie’s generalisedimpression of his various attitudes while wearing the fancy dress.]
(35) Feda : Will you ask also if he had been given—I think it musthave been a joke—something new that he was fond of using orwearing on his head, something round ; if it was a cap it had nopeak to it. He used to put it on his head and I think he liked it. Mr John is trying to draw just like a ring, like something he hadput on. It has no peak to it at all. You had better say something round that was new, to wear on his head, that he waspleased at having. It was as if he thought it was rather important putting this round thing on his head.
[This apparently refers to the crown. He was so fond of putting it on that his mother had to check him lest it should be worn out. (SeeFig. II.)]
(36) Feda : What does Bobbie want to say about his nose, his nose hurt ? (hand rubs nose).
He is making me feel as if something had hurt his nose on theside towards the end of his earthly life. Oh, he doesn’t think it caused his passing or anything of that kind.
[Mr Hatch writes : “ Bobbie was learning to box, and on the last lesson his instructor, usually very gentle with him, gave him a blow onthe nose which brought tears to his eyes. He complained afterwardsthat it hurt when washed.” When, on visiting the house, I was shownBobbie’s little diary, I noticed that he humorously referred to this
under its date thus—“ .Tune 14. The instructor came. Burst my nose.”This ha]ipened shortly before Bobbie’s death.]

(37) John repeats the reference to a predisposing cause for Bobbie’s
illness. [See Part II where this topic will be dealt with in its entirety.
Wherever this matter of the “ Pipes ”, is alluded to in these sittings the
paragraph will be represented by its number, and a reference to Part II where it will be found in full.]
(38) An event nine weeks before the death for which the “ pipes ” will be the clue. [See Part II.]
(39) Feda : Did I tell you last time about a girl a little older than
Bobbie that he was fond of ? She seemed as if very kind to him,
like giving up things to him and being very nice to him, and this
girl has been—I can’t get this quite—but it is something to do
with a ball that belonged to Bobbie. I don’t think this is much
good—you see I am not getting this from Mr John now, I am
getting it from Bobbie. Something this girl has been doing about
a ball that Bobbie was fond of "when he was here, the girl has
been doing something with it. [The child Marjorie at the Rink had a special part which she played
at the commencement of hockey matches. The team termed her their
mascot, and she began their competitions by an exhibition of skating in
which she finally drove a ball into the goal. Bobbie enjoyed watching
this. She was twelve years old and they were great friends. While
Marjorie was away on a visit Bobbie said to his mother, “ If I don’t see Marjorie soon I shall go mad ”. This was only a month before his death.
The sittings allude to her several times. The ball did not, of course, belong to Bobbie although he may at times have joined in playing with
it ; for he often skated with Marjorie.]
(40) Feda : And will you ask them if he went to a j^lace where there was
a broken stile ? At least it may not have been the stile itself that
you put your foot on was broken, but a part of the construction
through which the stile was made was broken.
(41) And there was a long footpath there too, part of it seems to go
between something, like as if you were going between something
rather high, I get like a high wall on one side. There is not
usually building near stiles now, but I get the feeling of something close to the path and the stile.
(42) When you get over the stile it is more open.
(43) Then I think there is a church with a group of trees round it.
(44) I feel you have only got to go a little way over the stile, and
there is something that would be dangerous near to this stile,
something you can fall down, as if you would say to children, “ Now, don’t go that way.” It is something you could fall down
into. And it is wet too ; I can’t see the water—I think they want me
to say that—and yet it feels sticky and wet there.
( 45 )
454 C. Drayton Thmnas [PAET(46) This is a place that Bobbie would know very well, would havereason to know. He has been thinking of it lately when he hasbeen with his people on the earth. He must have been near thisplace with them and it made him think about it again, whereashe would have forgotten it.
]\ir Hatch writes ; “ This is very good. A favourite walk was bya stile. Whether it is damaged I do not know, but I will find out.And beyond it is a church with trees. His body is buried in thechurchyard. Past the stile the path leads to a quarry, at the foot ofwhich is water. (See Fig. Ill, p 488.) Bobbie wanted to go there toplay, but we forbade it.” Mr Hatch wrote later ; “ I have been thewalk described in your last notes, but cannot find any damagedstile ; however, these last messages are the best we have had.”
Mr Hatch enclosed a plan of his walk, which is here reproduced(Plan 1 ). The stile, which had been there in Bobbie’s time, and wasPlan ].
143 ] A Proxy Case 455
broken, had now been completely removed. Beyond the site of this
stile a footpath runs along the precipitous edge of a quarry. Bobbie’s
mother tells me that she used to regard this unprotected path as dangerous. It is now made safe by a fence. There is no high wall on the side opposite the quarry but a row of houses ; these houses
might be described as “ something rather high ” and “ like a high
wall on one side ”. “ When you get over the stile it is more open ” ; yes, there is an extensive view over the quarry on the left. “ Church
with a group of trees round it ”
; this is a few minutes’ walk from
the quarry, not connected with it, but part of a walk which the
family often took. “ He must have been near this place with them,
etc. ” ; Mr Hatch adds, “ Yes, almost every time we have gone out
since his passing we have been either to the grave or to a friend who
lives near.”
On re-reading the above, while preparing this paper, I mistakenly
assumed that the walk which the family often took included the
path by the stile. It therefore seemed inexplicable that, if passing
the site of the stile “ almost every time we have been out since his
passing ”—a
j^eriod of several weeks—they should have been un- aware of the stde and its subsequent removal.
To my letter of enquiry about this Mr Hatch replied on February
24, 1935, “ You are mistaken in thinking that we had often taken
the walk by the stile after Bobbie’s death. The walk we did take was up the road to the grave. Gwen {i.e. Mrs Hewlove) went the
walk after your sitting and could not find the stde, though she had
thought there was one. We then vuote you that the description of
the walk was correct except that there was no broken stile. Some
weeks afterwards I found from a friend that a broken stde had been
there but had been removed shortly before Bobbie’s death.”
Third Sitting {Continued).
(47) Feda : A place near there beginning with Sw— It is near the
place they have been describing. There seems to be an ‘ L ’ a
little further in the same name—‘ Sw ’ and ‘ L ’
:
(48) Bobbie would sometimes go by ways and means of this stile to a building that has collapsed, he would not go to it exactly, but
he would go near it. Why it has collapsed Mr John does not
know, and he doesn’t think Bobbie does either, but it is left there
in heaps, partly standing and partly a heap of debris.
[Sw . . . L ” ; These letters present an unsolved puzzle.
As to the ruined building, Mr Hatch wuote : “ Nearer our house than
the quarry is an old barn, partly standing and partly a heap of debris.”]

456 C. Drayton Thomas [part(49) Feda : What was it Bobbie used to do with that ? Bobbie wantsto tell me about a very wonderful strap he had got, it went roundsomething. He was always fitting it on and taking it ofi, makingit a bit longer and a bit shorter, as if he was trying to pull it like that. (Medium’s hands here acted as if pulling up to the shoulder.)
As if it was made of rubber or elastic. He was always pulling it, and his mother did not like it much, she used to say, “ Now becareful, mind what you do with that ”.
[His mother remembers that he would pull out an elastic band orsomething similar, and she warned him, being afraid that it would fly in her face or his.]
(50) Feda : Did he tell you anything about a man relative who hadpassed over not long before he did ? Mr John says it is almostimpossible for us to be correct in calculating time, but he wouldhave thought it would be about two years. He was connectedwith the family ; and there is a letter ‘ A ’ in connection withthis. [His father’s brother-in-law, named Arthur, died suddenly about twoyears before this.]
(51) Feda : Bobbie was funny about his food, some foods that boys likehe was rather strange about, as if he did not like a certain food,he was very difficult about it, and there was something that hewas being given only a little while before he passed over that hedid not like at all. It was one of his pet aversions. It was a food,quite an ordinary food that many boys would like but he happened not to. He was given it towards the end of his earth life. [Quite correct. He was funny about food ; for instance, he wouldnever touch jam, not even a cake that had a little jam in it. He dislikedmilk too. Bobbie’s mother wrote : “ The food which Bobbie was beinggiven towards the end of his earth life, his pet aversion, was the whiteof egg. He hated it and always left it, but I was beginning to insist thathe should try to eat it.”]
(52) Feda : Did Mr John tell you that for a boy he would think Bobbiewas rather affectionate, sensitive to people’s words and actionsand even thoughts, a particularly understanding kind of boy.Thinks there would be a very strong link between himself andhis family. He was not quite the casual off-hand boy. He wasa boy with a good deal of deep feeling and understanding.
(53) He was rather fond of flowers, which not many boys are. MrJohn says, T think he means some particular plants that perhapshe took an interest in and would notice more than many boys.
[Mr Hatch wrote : “ The first part is correct, but I do not think hewas very fond of flowers ”. During my visit I was talking with Bobbie’s friend Mr Burrows, the
143 ] A Proxy Case 457
boxing instructor, who told me that Bobbie liked to come with him to
his garden. While there he showed much interest in potato plants,
which he had never previously seen. He had not understood that
several potatoes grew on a single root. Mr Burrow's therefore gave him
one to plant, and Bobbie was excited about its growth and over zealous
in watering it. He often inquired when he might dig it up, and fre- quently spoke of it at home. He lived to see it flower only.]
(54) Feda : You must not take it off the shelf, you must leave it on the
shelf near the corner. Leave it on the shelf where the others
could see it and have it. He used to take it sometimes—I think
I have got this right—there was something that used to be on the corner of the shelf, and sometimes Bobbie wanted it, and they
used to say, “ Leave it on the shelf in case the others want it ”, —something round and smooth and polished.
C. D. T. : I wonder w'hat he did with it when he took it in his
hands ? Feda : Was it a watch ? C. D. T. : Are you guessing, Feda ? Feda : I was only asking him, because it looked like a watch he was holding in the palm of his hand.
C. D. T. : What does he say ? Feda : He seems to be twisting something like you do a watch or
a clock.
C. D. T. : Winding it ? Feda : Yes, winding something.
C. D. T. : Is it Bobbie showing this ? Feda : It is Bobbie giving it to me. It feels something like a watch.
C. D. T. : It looks like a selected bit of evidence, but it just lacks
the definite indication. I could think of at least four things.
Feda : You had better not guess. He rolls it or winds it. It was
not a watch. They still have it. It is not in that place, it has
been put somewhere else, but they have still got it. Bobbie
thinks it has been put in a drawer instead of on the shelf. Is it on a plate ? He is giving me the idea of a plate being near it. [Mr Hatch writes : “ Bobbie was very fond of a little salt-sifter which
he won at Morecambe. It was kept at the corner of a shelf and he used
to twist the cork at the bottom and to roll it along the dinner table. It has been moved, but not into a drawer. It is of glazed earthenware,
shaped like a dog. ‘ Round, smooth and polished ’ is correct. It is now
kept on a shelf just below the dinner plates.” (See Fig. II.)]

Fourth Sitting, January 13, 1933.
Mr Hatch wrote at this time : “ Is it possible for you to put twoor three questions ? If they were answered correctly it would bewell-nigh overwhelming proof of survival. I leave it to you, ofcourse, but to save time I append the questions :
143 ] A Proxy Case 459
1. What (lifl P)ohbie keep in the bathroom cuplioard i
2. Where did he like to go with his Mummie last winter in the
evenings and was looking forward to going again this winter ?
3. What did he do in the attic besides boxing ?
I put these questions, and it will be observed as we proceed that
two of them were answered with some detail. It is as well to
mention here that I thought it would be interesting to compare the
result with my own guesses. I therefore wrote to Mr Hatch that
I guessed ;
(1) Boat, (2) the Pictures, or Ice Skating-rink, (3) playing with
trains. It became clear after the next few sittings that my alter- native guess for number (2), Skating-rink, was partly correct. I did
not learn mitil the sittings were completed that my guess for (1) “ Boat ” was also correct. But it is, perhaps, of some significance
in view of the telepathic hypothesis, that this never emerged in
replies to these questions, nor did my third guess, which proved
completely wrong.
Feda ; Etta says that she has brought the boy ; you know, Bobbie
Newlove, and that he wanted to say one or two things before they
went on to anything else.
C. D. T. : Bobbie, I can’t think what it was you used to do in the attic
besides boxing. I have been trying to guess.
(55) Feda : Had he been given by his people something that was in a box, and he used to take it out and it seemed to be in an awful lot of pieces? I think he had two boxes to do with it, he used to take
things out of the boxes as if he was fastening them together.
What he is building seems as if it comes up to a 2Joint, or there is a high something sticking iqi on top of it. I feel there is a pokingup j3art on top ; and I think there is a picture to do with it too, as if he was trying to build something from the picture, or to look
like it. [Mr Hatch : “ This might be his Meccano. Bobbie was fond of
making cranes with it which certainly come uj) to a jJoint. He also had
a Meccano aerojdane in two boxes. Both have j^ictures as a guide.”]
(56) Feda : Had Bobbie a duck ? I will tell you what he is showing
me ; it looks something like a duck. Will you ask if he had a toy
duck ? I think that is right. I see it in his hand like as if he is pushing it towards me. I don’t think its legs is very long, or else he is holding his legs up a bit, but ducks have not got very long
legs. I think it must be a duck because of its legs.
[Possibly this was an attempt to refer again to the dog salt-sifter which Bobbie had won at Morecambe (see Third Sitting, No. 54). If so, the subject is resumed later in this sitting, No. 61. The dog stands on
short hind legs with fore legs inconspicuous.]
460 C. Drayton Thomas [part(57) Feda ; He keeps on saying “ mice He was interested in something to do with mice and 1 think someone else is mixed n]) withthis, l.iecause I get a feeling of another child, or young person, whowas interested in and had as much to do with the mice as Bobbiehad
.
[Bobbie’s mother wrote ; “ 1 have at last been able to make inquirieswith regard to the mice. Bobbie, it appears, was interested in somemice which a friend of his had. Apparently he brought some to showus, but was shooed off again because I am frightened of them. I have onlya very vague remembrance of this, but the boy friend is quite certain.”](58) Feua : What are you showing me ? Did you pull a string out ofthe wall ? Bobbie did some funny things for a boy, now look, hei s going to the wall and he seems as if he is untwisting somethingand he is pulling something from the wall, either thick string orrope, and on the end he seems to be fixing something carefully.That is important, what he is doing with it. It is the pulling it out that seems to be the important thing. It is something aboutdrawing it out as far as is possible and then letting it go back tothe wall again. It is something that he seemed to do ratherregularly.
[Mr. Hatch : “ This is good ; in the attic he had, among other things,an arrangement for strengthening the muscles. The drawing appendedwill show you the idea. Drawing it out was the important thing, and hedid it rather regularly.” (See drawing.)
This is evidently the answer to question No. 3, which was, “ What didhe do in the attic besides boxing ? ”]
(59)
Feda : Ask if he was going to have something done to his teeth alittle while before he passed over, something that was delayed a
143j 461
little. That was before he got very ill. He remembers having
his teeth looked at, and that something was to be done.
[Mr Hatch : “ Yes, we knew he would have to visit the dentist soon,
and we were rather worried about it.”]
(60) Feda : His mother had a rather important engagement before he
passed over, he thinks it was a Saturday, and he thinks that his
being ill would have in some way interfered with it. He thinks
it was something for the Saturday afternoon.
[Mrs Newlove tells me that she had such an engagement fixed for the
Saturday, it was with the Brownies of which she was an official. Bobbie was taken ill on the previous Sunday. Directly his illness became
serious, Mrs Newlove wrote to postpone the engagement. Bobbie died
the following Thursday night. Bobbie knew that his mother was to have spent that Saturday with the Brownies.]
(61) Feda : Not the name Bobbie, but another name beginning with
‘ B ’ that was rather important in their house. I mustn’t say
sound because I am getting this by feeling. He gives ‘ B ’ by
sound, but now I get the feeliiig that this would seem to be more
like an animal’s name, or the name of a toy. It is something in
their house that he was very fond of, and he calls it a funny name
beginning with ‘ B ’, not a long name. Wait a bit—Ber, Bunkey,
Bussey. The name he is giving me sounds as if it began Bus
or Bos.
[This is possibly a further reference to the salt-sifter mentioned
previously (see No. 56). It is shaped like a dog in sitting posture.
Bobbie was very fond of it and called it his “ bow-wmw ”. Cf. Like an
animal’s or toy’s name. A funny name beginning with ‘ B ’.]
(62) Feda : There is someone he liked and was interested in whose
name began with ‘ W ’ and it sounds like Wenda, or Wendy, that
is the nearest I can get to it. [Mr Hatch : “ We can only think of a Winnie in whom he was
interested.”]
(63) Feda : Bobbie wants to say something about handwriting. He
was told to do something which would help, and he had been
trying to do it. He wanted to improve it, and he tried to before
he passed over.
(64) The reason he is mentioning this is because it has been spoken
of lately, and he wanted to say, “ Yes, I was trying to do it a
little while before I passed over.”
[Mr Hatch : “ We begged him to try with his writing as it was keeping him back at school. We had mentioned his bad writing when trying
to read his diary

after his passing.”]
(65) Feda : His people have been talking about going to a place that was much connected with Bobbie when he was here, and they
know that they ought to go some time. It may make them a bit
4f)2 C. Drayton Thomas [part
sad lifcause of the connections with Bol)l)ie when he was on the
earth. There is an initial ‘ H ’ connected with where they are
going. I get Ha- They have been thinking of going to this
place. He feels as if something is making them go to this place.
[Mr Hatch : “We have thought of visiting friends near Halifax. The
jdace has no associations with Bobbie, but the ’bus journey there would
remind us vividly of him, as we have been most of the way there with
him.”
If this Ha— was an endeavour to transmit the name Halifax, it is an
instance of Feda’s imperfect clairaudience, similar to the preceding B,
Ber, Bunkey for bow-wow, and the Wenda for Winnie.]
(66) Feda ; Will you ask his mother if she has been thinking or doing
anything about Rosemary ; will you say that ? He means it as a little message for her. He wanted it to be symbolical. Hefelt it was in her mind.
[Boldue was interested in the Guides and the Brownies and his
mother’s work with them. After Bobbie’s death she began to receive
letters in connexion with this work from Lady Rosemary Stopford.
The name Rosemary might be considered symbolical of this work, but
it did not strike Mrs Newlove until some time after she had written to inform me that the name was not recognised.]
(67) Fepa : He keeps on saying he has seen Arthur there.
[Mr Hatch : “ In a previous sitting (see ])aragraph 50) it was correctly
stated that a connexion, actually his father’s brother-in-law, died
suddenly about two years ago. The initial ‘ A ’ was given ; now the full name is correctly given.”]
(68) Feda : And there is a funny name he is remembering, sounding
rather like Euan. It is a name that Bobbie remembers, some- body he used to be interested in, and the name does sound very
much like Euan.
(This is not recognised.]
((i!J) Feda : l)o you know if there was some discussion about havinganother doctor, if another doctor had to be got to look at him,
suddenly, late ; Ijecause I keep getting a mix-up between twodoctors.
[Mr Hatch ; “ Correct. Another doctor, a specialist on the throat,
happens to live next door. He saw Bobbie a few hours before he died.”]
(70) Previous constitutional weakness, and further reference to “ the
pi])cs ”. (See Part II.)
C. U. T. : Bobbie, have you given the answers to those three things
your mother asks, they were—(I ) What was kept in the l)athroomcuj)board ? (2) What did you do in the attic besides boxing ? and (3) Where did you go last winter evenings with your motherand were hoping to go again this winter ? It may be that youhave given the answers already.
143 468 ] A Proxy Case
(71) Feda : When he went with his mother didn’t he carry something
for her 1 feel it is ratlier imjxirtant that he carried something
for her, not sometliing that he put under his arm, hut something
swinging a bit. [Mr Hatch : “ Bobbie was keenly interested in roller-skating and it is curious that you guessed correctly this answer to the question about
what he did on winter evenings. Bobbie used to carry his skates
swinging. His mother sometimes olfered to carry them but he would
never allow her to do so. Possibly he feels that he carried them to save
her trouble.”]
(72) Feda : And when they walked did he hold her arm ? I don’t know
if he always did this, but I get a very strong feeling of holding her arm. Boys don’t usually do that, but I seem to get him doing
this when they went out at night.
[Mr Hatch : “ Yes, correct.”]
(73) Feda ; Tliey had spoken and thought about buying something new for this winter that was going to be rather expensive in connexion with where they were going together. It was a bit
expensive, but it would be rather an improvement on what they
had. He enjoyed going to tliis place, and lie would talk about
it a lot afterwards, and about the progress they had made.
[Mr Hatch : “ There was some talk of a pair of skates for his mother.
She had none, but used a pair from the rink. It is true that he enjoyed
going and would talk about the progress they had made.”]
(74) Feda : What a funny place it is, there did not seem much furniture
there. Will you ask if it was rather a bare place, because I am
getting a feeling of a place that is rather bare, perhajis it is purposely bare ? It feels as if it was a ]ilace where they cleared
the furniture ; it feels as if there were a lot of other people there
too. I keep hearing voices. That has to do with where they went
on winter evenings, and t hey hojied to go again, only after buying
something special.
C. D. T. : He has not told you what it is ? Feda : No, I can’t get what it is. [Mr Hatch : “ A correct description of the rink.”]
(75) Feda : There was someone they used to expect to see there, a youngish man, someone they knew particularly well, someone much older than Bobbie. Now I am seeing an ‘ M ’, I think that
would be the man’s name. And getting warm there.
[Mr Burrows, a great friend of Bobbie’s, was a prominent person at
the rink. The little girl, Marjorie, previously mentioned in these notes, was there also as a semi-professional.
Note Feda’s wrong inference : “ M—I think that would be the man’s
name.” “ Getting warm there ” ; one certainly does in roller skating.]
(76) Feda ; Did she ask him to get new boots for it ? I get a discussion
464 C. Drayfoii Thomas [partabout boobs or shoes to do with it, which he knows she will remember. He is losing it a bit, he is going back a bit. [Mr Hatch : “ Bolibie wanted new lioots for the rink.”]
(77) 0. D. T. ; Bobbie, what did you keep in the bathroom cupboard ? Show a jhcture of it, think about it and let Feda see. Feda ; No, Bobbie, I amseeing that wrong, what is it ? not a balloon,
Bobbie, it would go bang ! I don’t know what he means now, he
shows me a picture which looks like a balloon, and it came whenyou asked him. I feel it is light and round, like something that
floats in the air. Will you ask them if he did keep one in the
bathroom cupboard ? [There is no known connexion between this reply and the bathroom.
I suspect that we have here an example of the confusion which inevitably follows when the sitter’s question is ignored and the communicator continues his previous train of thought. Bobbie had just beenspeaking about the rink—carrying skates, buying new skates, the rink,
persons he knew there, new boots for skating. What more natural
than that he should think of the Festal Nights at the rink in which heusually captured several of the coloured balloons ? On those nights a bunch of balloons was dropped to be scrambled for by the children. I have repeatedly noticed that, for reasons which we can guess, a communicator either does not catch one’s question, or prefers to completewhat he has in mind to say.]
C. D. T. : Can you show Feda what you did in the attic ?
(78) Feda : He is lying on the floor. I suppose you are lying on the
floor ? He is showing me something like stretched on the floor.
I think he wants me to go flat on the floor or something. It feels as if I have got to lie on the floor and move something. I wantto waggle altogether, sort of squirm about. I think my handsand feet and head is going. That is all I can get about it. [Mr Hatch : “ Lying on the floor is correct. Bobbie was given drills there ; raising legs while on his back, raising the body from the handsand toes, and various tricks.”]
C. D. T. : I was very interested when they sent me a photographof Bobbie showing the board that Feda seemed to see him lookingover, and the round thing on his head without a brim that Fedadescribed. It was all perfectly shown in the photograph. Theonly discrepancy was that he was not crouching. It was a fancydress occasion, and he was representing someone, and he had thelarge card half as big as himself slung in front of him to illustrate the character he portrayed.
(79) Feda : No, Etta, no, what do you mean about a book ? Somethingis coming back to my mind about that, but I am not in a positionnow to ask Bobbie to verify this, but you know we have told youthat when we are bringing a would-be communicator to you
U3] A Proxy Case 4(i5
we often know something ahout it Ix'forehand, we know tlie synopsis of what they are going to give. Well, to my mind now
there comes l)ack the recollection about a book. Will you find
out, did he get it from a book, had he been interested in a book
that is in some way connected with what he pretended to be ?
I do remember that he was going to speak about a book.
[Mr Hatch : “ The boards had been used before, not by Bobbie, but
he knew about it ; they were used in a play by Brownies taken from
Alice in Wonderland. Bobbie had read the book Alice in Wonderland
and was very thrilled with it.”]

(90) Feda : Bobbie wants to ask his mother does she remember howthe doors were changed at that place they went in the evenings ? They shut up one lot of doors and opened the others, went in by
a different set of doors to what there were first. There was a
different arrangement of the doors afterwards. He only just
remembered about that.
[Mr Hatch ; “ This is incorrect. No change has been made regarding
the doors of the skating rink.”]
(91) Feda : And did he use something made of celluloid, something that
he used and they wanted him to stop using it ? They thought it might make a flame or explosion.
[Mr Hatch ; “ Yes, he had bought a second-hand cinematograph
lantern, and we were a little nervous about the celluloid films.”]
(92) Feda ; Will you ask his mother whether she had the bathroom
done after he passed over, the walls, because he remembers she
wanted to have them done ? there was something that she was
talking about having done before he passed over, about the bath- room ; talking about the bathroom reminded him.
[The family say that parts of the bathroom wall and ceiling needed
attention where the lincrusta was loose. This had been put right since
Bobbie’s passing.]
143] A Proxy Case 467
(93) Feda ; Wait a bit, Bobbie. I nearly got what you are trying to give me. He saw that his mother had folded up a coloured paper
thing that he had used. It was something he wore. You know,
tissue paper ? Well, he is showing me that and in several colours,
and as if they were folded up into conical shape and triangular
shapes ; but she has had to fold them very carefully, because they
have been folded up before, and there seems to be several of them,
because they seem to make a big lump. It was something that
she had an idea might come in useful again, and it was something
Bobbie had helped her with. Part of it was a puce pink, and also
there was a bright green and blue ; there seemed to be several
colours, white as well, and he thinks his mother folded them and
put them all in a box together ; but he did not use them again,
because he passed over. There has been an occasion since he
passed over in which, and for which, they could have used them,
but they did not, and he rather thought they would, but yet was
not surprised when they did not. [Mr Hatch writes : “ This might be the caps out of Christmas crackers
which were folded up, and which would have been used again if Bobbie
had lived.”
In answer to my further inquiry I was assured that these caps amswered
to the description, including the “ puce colour ”.]
(94) C. D. T. : They did not know what you meant about the month of
April. They don’t think anything happened in April ; was it your birthday, Bobbie ? [In a previous sitting Feda had mentioned April but failed to catch
Bobbie’s meaning. Finally she had said, “ He keeps on saying April.
I think they will recognise it.”]
Feda : Xo, it was not, nor his passing.
C. D. T. : Was it connected with your school, Bobbie ? Feda : A"es, in a way. Sir. You are getting very near it. C. D. T. : Did you win something then ? Feda : Xo, but he tried something.
C. D. T. : Work or play 1 Feda : It was a bit of both. It was something that he tried to do,
there was a kind of meeting about it, which he was rather important in, and which he thought a lot of and looked forward to. (Long pause.) And Atkins, there is a name he is giving me sounding like Atkins. It is either Atkins or Atkinson. I get At—
,
Atk—, and that is all mixed up with the April thing.
[This may refer to the following facts wFich were given me by the
family on my visit to them. Bobbie had wished to enter for his school
sports. He asked permission, and the matter was discussed by the family.
Although the sports were held in the summer the competitors’ names
were taken in April. There was a similar family discussion as to his entering for the fancy dress parade of the Hospital, at which he wore
the Jack of Hearts costume. The name is not recognised.]
468 C. Drayton Thomas [partC. D. T. ; They thought that that animal beginning with the letter
‘ J1 ’ Mms his bow-wow.
Feda : That is right, but what a silly name.
C. D. T. : I believe it is what he called the china article that hewon and kept on the shelf. Feda ; I think it is something to do with bow-wow, he seemed to come forward and somehow open to me about that.
C. D. T. : The little girl they thought was Winnie, whom Bobbieknew so well. You said Wendy.
Feda : That is the right one, but that was Feda’s fault. [My object in reporting on these items was partly to give encouragement, and partly in the hope of eliciting further confirmatory descriptions. I attach little value to a mere assent when I ask if such-and-suchis the right solution.]
CJ. D. T. ; And what else did you do in the attic besides exercisesto strengthen the muscles ? You boxed, but you did other thingsthere too ?
(95) Feda : What is he pretending to l)e ? Is he being silly ? He is jumping about, putting his hands like that—(here medium’s armswere thrown upward), bowing and like that. He is pretendingto be acting, like clowns or something ; it is something like thathe did, because he made me feel he wanted to be something like posing and all that.
[Mr Hatch : “ I think this is good. We had fitted up the attic as agymnasium. The ‘ bowing ’ is a good description of his movementswhen lifting dumb-bells or other weights.”]
Feda : Some of the things I have got for them I don’t understand,and just a little bit of a twist would make them get the WTongmeaning.

470 C. Drayton Thomas [partSeventh Sitting, March 10, 1933.
(101) Feda : Etta says Bobbie had very good powers of observationand you might tell his people I say so. I think that would bemarked in him as a boy, because boys are very careless in manythings, and Bobbie was not. He was a normal boy, but he hadstrong powers of perception and observation. '
[Mr Hatch : “ Very true. Bobbie certainly had powers of observationabove the average.”]
(102) Feda ; Another thing about him, he would have had a rather[ scientific mind.
| [Mr Hatch ; “ I think that, as far as one can judge a boy of ten, this , is correct. He used to pore over some books of mine on palaeontology.He mastered the names of certain extinct monsters. He loved chemicalor electrical toys.”]
(103) Feda : He also had a strongly artistic side which I think he gets1 from his mother. She says he is not telling you this, it is Etta.Bobbie gets some artistic power through his mother’s side ofthe family.
Will you ask his mother whether someone rather closely con-nected with her became rather well known and esteemed forsome special artistic work that I think was connected withdrawing or designing ? Bobbie has inherited that, not in theexact form that his relative had it, but the same gift in a ratherdifferent form. (See 104.)
[Mr Hatch : “ We do not think he was artistic. He could not drawat all well, but he had good taste. His mother is not artistic either, butan uncle of hers is well known in the east of England as an architect.”](104) Feda : Bobbie has an exceptionally good idea of form, outline,shape, proportion, perspective—I gather that his people haveconcrete evidence of it. [Mr Hatch : “ No, Bobbie had not good ideas of form, perspective,etc., and we have nothing concrete of artistic value of his.”
On my vi.sit to Nelson 1 was shown some of Bobbie’s artistic effortswith paints ; they are crude, and scarcely equal to the average for boysof his age. Etta’s impression of his abilities in this direction seemsmistaken.]
(105) Feda : A little thing that Bobbie mentioned to her ; an oblongwooden box with a flat lid that just comes down on top of thething. Inside this seems to be a collection of, well—metal things ; Etta says, I can’t remember what he said it was now—1 thinksome kind of tools. But they are special things.
I gather he had had a set given him as a present not very longbefore he passed over, and something about them had to bechanged, exchanged. 1 don’t know whether he meant the boxhad to be exchanged, but something in it had to be exchanged.
143 ] A Proxy Case 471
It was not quite right for what he wanted. Somewhere on the
box is a round stamp or label. I think Bobbie said it was near
the edge or corner. [Mr Hatch : “ We do not know what this means. He had no wooden
box as is described, and he had not had a set of tools for a long time. At
the last Christmas he was given a Meccano aeroplane construction set,
but it was in a cardboard box. It had a large number in a circle like a
label in the corner.”
I incline to think that two boxes are here confused, either in Etta's
memory or in the transmission through Feda : (1)1 was shown the one
given to Bobbie more recently, and its lid answers to the description.
(2) The aeroplane set, which he had two years before, was beyond his power to 2)iece together, and so was taken back to the shop to be built
up.]
(106) Feda : Are Bobbie’s jreople hel^ring a very old j^erson ? I forget
what Bobbie told me, but I think it was an old lady, whom they were sorry for and doing their utmost for, and Bobbie is very
pleased about it. Bobbie’s people feel they must give special
heljr for the time being.
[The family informed me that, at the date of this sitting, they were
thinking of sending daily dinners, and were inclined to select as the
recipient a certain old lady whom they knew. Shortly after this they
decided upon this widow, aged 63, but who looks older and is toothless.
They were still sending dinners to her when I visited them in June 1933.]

(109) Feda : Do yon know if Bobbie would be very interested in—well,I could only describe it to you as a kind of chemist’s shop, aplace where there are bottles ? I don’t think it is a chemist’sshop, really, but it is a place with bottles and weighing things,and like instruments and things of that kind. I have a feelingthat he had been in such a place, and was very interested in it, and liked going, too. I get a feeling of a clean, white place, all nice and clean and white. Clean tajrs and bottles and measuringthings. He went there for some reason. [Mr Hatch : “ This is very good. I had a good deal to do with alaboratory in the town, and Bobbie liked to go there with me. Thereference to taps, bottles and weighing things is quite correct.”
I gathered later, when discussing this with Mr Hatch, that Feda’semphasis upon the cleanliness of the place was a trifle overdone.]
Tenth Sitting, May 19, 1933.
C. D. T. : I am wondering whether Bobbie Newlove will give moreImessages.
(110)
Peda : He is a very bright boy, and he is rather polite too, I thinkif you would ask his mother that she would tell you that it is so. [Mr Hatch : “ Yes, he was certainly polite.”]
Ill) Feda: His mother has been thinking something about a cap,thinking something rather special of it lately. It is only a little thing, but he just wanted her to know it.
[Mr Hatch writes : “ Yes, she has been thinking about his cap.”]
(112) Feda : She came across something with a special badge on it. It is not a heart e.xactly, but the lower part is rather shaped like aheart, at the bottom it is heart-shaped. It is something like astraight line goes through the top of it, and a little upstandingpiece comes out of the top.
Mr Hatch replied that they knew no badge of this shape. On myvisit to Nelson I asked whether Bobbie had a badge on his schoolsports jacket, or other kind of badge. They knew of none. I therefore marked this as a failure. Later in the day I was shown theboards and cap which had been spoken of in an earlier sitting, and ofwhich I wished to take a photograph. On seeing the Jack of Heartsi
143 ] ^4 Proxy Case 473
cap I recognised it as answering exactly to this description. Cf. photograph (35) and notice the heart on the front of the crown or
cap, with the line going each side the top of the heart, and the
“ little upstanding piece at the top The one inaccuracy was the
statement that “ it is not a heart exactly ”, unless one takes this to
refer to the cap itself, upon which the heart is fixed. Referring to
my notes I saw the words, “ she came across something with a
special badge on it ”. A question elicited the reply that Bobbie’s
mother had turned out this paper crown while spring cleaning. The
date of this sitting agrees closely with the time when it had come
under her notice.
Sitting continued.
(113) Feda : Wait a bit, don’t be in a hurry. (Long pause.) “ Church.”
Wait a minute, Bobbie. I don’t see quite what you mean.
(This was all whispered.) “ Church ”, something about a church. I don’t know—anyhow he is showing me a church, the
outside of a church, and the churchyard.
C. D. T. : Church and churchyard ? Feda : Yes, he is taking me to the side. I think the right-hand
side of the church as you face it. I think it is somewhere his
mother has been lately. Not going into the church, but going
down into the churchyard to the right, and I think the ground
slopes down a bit just there too. It is somewhere his mother
has been lately, and where she was thinking of him very much.
(The above was whispered softly and with long pauses between the
sentences.)
[Mr Hatch ; “ This is quite correct ; his grave is in just the position
indicated.”
On visiting Nelson I found that this description was exact. One
enters the gate, passing the stocks, which are on the left side of the path ; then, going along the right-hand side of the church, the ground distinctly sloping downwards, one comes to the grave. It was true that
his mother had been there shortly before this sitting, indeed, she
frequently goes there, and naturally thinks then of Bobbie.]

(129) Feda : He wanted to tell his mother that he is usually with herearly in the mornings.
Will you ask her if cardboard boxes made her think of himjust lately ? [Mr Hatch : “ Correct, it was in connexion with the spring cleaning.”]C..D. T. ; I expect she thinks of you a great deal, Bobbie.
(130) Feda : She and I were such chums. We were not so much likemother and son, we were chums. He says he felt so grown up,sometimes she felt as if he was taking her out, felt really as if he was taking her. He says, “ I think she will understand if youtell her.” And she used to love to plan things she and I woulddo and go to together, especially that last year in which I wason the earth. I seemed to have got more grown up than ever,and she depended on me so much that last nine months. I hadgrown more, so that she and I could enjoy things together thatusually are enjoyed by two people of just the same age, and wereally enjoyed them as if we were the same age ; and she usedto tell me things that she had done, and even about things shehad bought, you know. She would even mention things abouther clothes which I suppose most mothers don’t do, but sheused to often tell me about things she had bought.”
“ I was always happiest when I was with her ”, he says.“ She was like another boy as well as a mother. When youknow her better you will think she is a boy too.”
“ She is not mannish to look at, but I could always talk toher like I could to another boy.” He says, “ She always talkedto me as if I was grown up.”
[Mr Hatch : “ This is a remarkably correct description of his relationswith his mother.”
“ When you come to know her better, etc.” Having now met MrsNewlove, I can entirely agree with this.]

(132) Feda ; Bobbie says, they will think at home about showing youa special photograph showing me down to the waist : I have gota kind of sweater on, it is one that mother likes. It is practicallyfull face, only my hair is coming down a bit at the side of theforehead, and 1 am not exactly frowning, but as if I am drawingmy eyebrows down over my eyes. I think you’ll notice thatparticularly.
[During my visit to Nelson I was shown numerous photographs ofBobbie. In several 1 noticed “ hair coming down a bit at the side of theforehead ”, and one of them, in addition, showed the facial expressionhere descrilied ; it was apparently caused by the fact that the boy wasfacing bright sunlight. In this photograph the child, wearing a jersey,stands upon a stool. “ Sweater . . . that mother likes ” : Mrs Newlove writes of this stool photograph, “ I did not care for thelikeness, Init did like the jersey. I remendjer being rather disappointedbecause Bobbie looked so untidy and his hair needed cutting so badly.’]Feda : 1 think she has been thinking about this photograph justlately, as if she would like to show it to you.
[It is not clear which photo is meant ; luit for the fact of its showingBobbie at full length it might be the above in which he stands on a stool.Mrs Newlove had not thought of that one recently.]
(133) Feda : I wonder if she will show you something that belonged tome that is not—well, I can’t show Feda the shape of it. It is made of yellow wood, it looks like varnished wood, a very highpolish on it, he says. It was something he was very fond of thathe had rather towards the end of his earth life. It used to smellof varnished stuff. I think it still does ; he says there are plenty(jf woods that do not smell at all, Init that this is more like avarnish.
[For some time this object could not be traced. Later it was noticedthat the above-mentioned photo showed Bobbie standing on a stoolwhich is of “ yellow, varnished wood ”. The stool does not now smell ofvarnish, for the photo was taken in 1926, and the stool was then severalyears old. Mrs Newlove thinks BoI)bie would consider that this stoolbelonged to her and to himself especially.]
Feda : There is a connexion between photographs and thiswooden thing. I think he will have to leave it like that.
[The yellow stool apj)ears in this photograph of Bobbie ; but as hesaid, “ showing me down to the waist ”, and he is here seen full length,one is doubiful whether it is the one meant.]
(134) Feda : Would you ask my mother if she has planted a small treeor has got a small tree especially for me ? It is rather a peculiargreen, it is jiyramidical in sha|.)e, I believe the tree has some

u:i] ^4 Proxy Case 477
well, your father calls it—“ symbolical meaning She has been
thinking of me just lately in connexion with it. [Mrs Newlove wrote : “ This is only a surmise, but the ‘ tree with
symbolical meaning ’ might possibly mean his Christmas Tree. Every
Christmas Bobbie had a very large one, decorated with coloured glass
ornaments, such as are used for Christmas Trees, and toys. Last
Christmas, of course, we had no tree, and it would be about May when,
turning out some drawers in preparation for the spring cleaning, I found some of these coloured ornaments ; and my thoughts naturally went
back to the memories they recalled . . . ‘ She has been thinking of me
just lately in connexion with it ’.”]
(135) Feda : Cajrtain, someone he used to call Captain, someone he
liked, I think his mother is going to see this Captain.
[Mr Hatch : “ Mr Burrows, captain of the rink hockey team, a great
friend of Bobbie’s and who is now often at the house. But Bobbie did
not call him Captain. The diary consistently terms him ‘ the In- structor
’ ”.]
(136) Feda : The swings, the place where the swings are, he used to go
there and his mother did not like it much. Jolly at this time of
the year. Mother will remember.
[Mr Hatch : “ The Fair comes soon to Nelson. Bobbie loved the
swings, but his mother did not like him to go on them much.”]
(137) Feda : Will you ask her whether she remembers the track I was
so interested in, that she did not like, the track where there was some racing ? I think something had happened, I think it was
rather dangerous, and I know I wanted to go, and I think it must
be this time of the year. It was a sort of circular track. It was
something I wanted to look at, and I don’t think mother liked it. [Mr Hatch : “ This is good. There was a kind of motor cycle racing
at the Fair which he wanted to see, but his mother disapproved.”]
Feda : I think something happened about it, an accident or something, I have a feeling of something dangerous and unpleasant,
but that would have been after we saw it. [Mr Hatch : “ There was an accident there. He never saw the racing,
however.”
Bobbie was familiar with the track, even if he did not see the racing.]
(138) Feda : He says, did I tell you that ours was a hilly district? Did
I tell you we lived close to hills, you seemed always to be
walking up or down hills ?
C. D. T. : I happen to know that it is hilly.
[This is more correct than I realised at the time ; the hills are much
steeper than I then supposed.]
(139) Feda : He says it is pretty well straight down there. You know
one part going that way. You know you get very near to where
478 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe ground was cut away to make that road down there, rather a steep part, as if it is sliced away to make one side of the road,
and, he says, I don’t think this was very long ago. It is like a
sort of wall it makes at one side. There is an awkward tramline
at one part. People used to complain about it. He says, I don’t
know whether they have altered it, but there were a great manycomplaints about it. He says, like two lines coming close to- gether, in a narrow part, it couldn’t have been a worse place to make them close together.
(140) There is a place ‘ C
’ —close by, a long name sounding like Catelnow, Castlenow. There seemed to be two or three syllables,
like a Ca sound, cattle or castle something.
[Mr Hatch : “ The name given is like Catlow, a hamlet near here.
Bobbie and I went there the day he was taken ill, the last occasion thathe left the house. About one-quarter mile along the road leading to it jmst the church is a place which was dangerous for buses—there are no trams. It was altered a little while before Bobbie’s death and madesafe by the removal of a braiding. Leading from this spot is Scholefield
Lane and below it lies the hamlet of Catlow.”]
[One of the last entries in Bobbie’s diary, August 7, reads—“ Wentto Catlow Bottoms. Sore throat. Went to bed.”]
(141) Feda ; His mother’s neck has been worrying her a bit lately. Inthe throat, the neck, she felt rather tired there. I don’t knowwhether she got a cold there, but she seemed uncomfortable.
[Mr Hatch : “ His mother says she has had exactly this feeling in herthroat, but never mentioned it to anyone.”]
(142) Feda : Wait a minute, there is a young girl Bobbie is interestedin at home, her name begins with an ‘ M ’, and a boy with theinitial ‘ K ’, and also another one beginning with ‘ E ’
; theyare all special friends of Bobbie’s and people his mother has beenthinking of and doing things with just lately.
[Mr Hatch : “ This is exactly correct if you take ‘ home ’ to mean thetown but not the house.”
In conversation they gave me particulars as follows : ‘ M ’
; Marjorie(M the rink, several times previously alluded to. ‘ H ’
: a boy Eoywhom Bobbie knew at the rink. They had given some of Bobbie’stoys to Boy. ‘ E ’
: a youth, Earle, whom Bobbie knew at the rink,
aged 19.]
(143) Feda : There is another woman there as well as his mother. Awoman talking about Bobbie ; this woman is in the house.
[This may be an allusion to Bobbie’s grandmother, who lives withthem.
In a recent letter Mr Hatch had written : “ Bobbie used often tocycle in a garden ; will you ask him where % ” I therefore now put thatquestion.]
143 A Proxy Case 470 ]
(144) C. D. T. ; You often cycled in a garden. Why you did it in the
garden I can’t think ; it wasn’t your own garden, was it ? Feda : Wait a minute, I wonder who it belonged to. Bicycle
through a gate, when you got to the gate you could turn to the
left down a side path and you could bicycle there if you wanted
to.
(145) I think there is another boy with him, and I see a tall lady.
Is there a clergyman, minister, connected with this place 1 I don’t think he lives there, and yet I get a feeling of clergy and
ministers. I see a tall lady and another boy.
[Mr Hatch : “ This is remarkable, as the garden referred to belongs
to the family of a minister who died about three years ago. The description is exact, except that there was no other boy.”]
When discussing this with the family I learnt that “ a tall lady ”
lives there ; so that item is also correct. How shall we accomit for
the reference to another boy which does not apply to that garden ? Since A\uitmg the foregoing I have received the following note in answer to my inquiry.
“ ‘ Another boy with him, and I see a tall lady ’. We have discovered
since you asked us about this that on one occasion only Bobbie wished
to take another boy with him into this garden. The owner, however, did
not allow him to do so, as she felt, quite naturally, that if she allowed one
she might be expected to allow more, and the garden would be overrun. This other boy did not go into the garden, but only to the gate, while
Bobbie tried to obtain permission to have him in. On no other occasion
did Bobbie bring a boy with him while in that garden, nor did any other
boy friend of the family go there. The owner of the garden herself told
me this.”
In order to make sure that the above account was accurate in
every detail it was submitted to the “ tall lady ” who owns the
garden, with the request that she would correct it where necessary.
It was returned unaltered and with her signature ap])ended in testi- mony to its complete agreement with fact.
Sitting continued.
(146)
C. D. T. : Do you know the name of the people who lived there 1 Feda : I am seeing the letter ‘ C ’ again, I think that is the name
of somebody living there. The letter ‘ C ’ comes up very big.
Co—, I must not guess as to whether it has got anything to do
with it, but it sounds like Ke—, Ce—, Coo— . C. D. T. : What about spelling it ? Feda : I don’t think he can give any more, he is going back a
bit now.

statements and placed them in order. This is prefaced by an abbreviated outline of the course of events from the first mention of the
pipes to their final discovery.
BOBBIE NEWLOVE
THE PROBLEM OF THE PIPES
[Abbreviated outline.)
The story opens with a letter of appeal from Mr Hatch in which he
informed me of the recent loss of a boy aged ten. The cause of
death was diphtheria. In a further letter the boy’s name, Bobbie
Newlove, was given. Beyond this, and the address of the boy’s
home, I knew nothing of the facts which subsequently emerged at
my sittings with Mrs Leonard.
On the 2nd December, 1932, my father, while speaking about
Bobbie, expressed the opinion that there had been some cause which
facilitated his taking diphtheria.
He then added that this predisposition might be traced to something which happened nine tveehs before the boy’s death, and he asked
my special attention to this fact. I quote one of his sentences
verbatim : “ If it had happened to anyone coimected with you, you
would have immediately connected up the two happenings, nine
weeks before his passing and his actual passing.”
It may be that I saw in this some challenge to my intelligence ; for I resolved to discover what was imjDlied in those remarks.
When I asked to be told exactly what it was which the above
assertion hinted, the reply came, “ pipes—pipes, he just says this
pipes. That word should be sufficient.” This seemed to suggest
infection from defective drainage, and I expected that the family
would acquiesce in this. But they refused to accej;)t any suggestion
of the kind, and replied that they could not trace the matter at all. The word “ pipes ” conveyed nothmg to them.
We must now' trace the indications given in successive sittings
which finally led us to discover w'hat w'as meant by “the pipes ”.
It was not until three months after this first mention of pipes that
the family learnt of the exact place where Bobbie and his friend had
played ; but even this left them without any clue as to why pipes
482 C. Drayion Thomas [part
had been mentioned, and it was not until my visit on July 1, 1933,
that one pipe was discovered there. The second pipe, which justified
the use of the plural word, was not found until later. At the sitting m January 1933 Bobbie repeated the assertion that
his trouble was traceable to the pipes, and when I replied that his
people failed to find any connection between his illness and pipes
Feda merely remarked that she considered Bobbie a very clearminded and intelligent boy. I therefore asked the family if they
thought it probable that Bobbie might have heard diphtheria
spoken of in connection with bad drains. The reply was : “ Wedo not know. It is very unlikely that Bobbie had heard of anyone
catching the disease from pipes.”
The subject was resumed at a sitting later, in January 1933, and
the further information was then given that the pipes were not in a
place to which he went regularly, nor to which he went direct from
home, but that he had gone to them when in a second place. Clues
to this second place were then given, and included a reference to
animals, which my father asked me to note particularly because,
“ his j^eople may say w'hen they first read it that Bobbie never went
to a place where there were such things. But he did.” Among
further descriptions of the j^lace was reference to a barn, having one
side nearly or entirely open, more like a place of shelter, and containing bundles of straw. Another boy was said to have been there
with Bobbie and to have been the reason for Bobbie’s going. Although these clues eventually led us to the right spot they were of no help at this early stage because the family were not familiar with
the locality in question.
During a sitting in February 1933 I expressed a wish that some
definite name might be given in order to assist the search. Feda
then said that she was being given a name like “ Bentley ”, and then,
after some struggles and uncertainty as to the word intended, she
pronounced “ Stock ” and proceeded to describe a town and certain
streets. In fact, a route was described and, as I learnt afterwards,
quite correctly, which started from Bobbie’s home, taking a loop
round the railway station near by, and then going up hill past
Bentley Street (in which Bobbie’s school was situated) and leading
onward towards the old Stocks. The latter stand at the entrance to
the Churchyard. Now that we know where the pipes are, it is easy
to see that Bobbie’s description led us three-quarters of the way to
the place. These descriptions make it 'p&'>'f(^tly clear that the intelli- gence giving them ivas intimately acquainted with Bobbie’s home and
its surroundings. I should add here that I knew nothing whatever
about it, and that Mrs Leonard was never told that the town hi
question had become of interest to me. In subsequent sittmgs
143 ] A Proxy Case 483
additional touches were given which, while they gave us no help at
the time, are significant because ultimately found to be correct. At a sitting in the middle of May 1933 a further description was
given which eventually led us to the place itself,—“ A place with an address on ‘ B ’
. . . he went to this ‘ B ’ place at certain times.”
I say it led us eventually to the place itself. It is easy to see this now
that one knows the facts, but at the time it only puzzled us. It was not unnatural that ‘ B ’ should suggest the Baths, and I inquired whether the family had heard of any infection in connexion
with pipes at the Baths. This, however, was a false scent, and led
to nothing. In the same sitting the actual locality was mdicated by
the letter ‘ H ’, but this, like the previous letter ‘ B ’, failed to convey
anything to us at the time.
It is now obvious that ‘ H ’ meant “ the Heights ”, and ‘ B ’ the
name of Brierfield, the locality in which the Heights are situated.
Guided by the clues given in reply to my inquiries the pipes were
finally discovered. Water issued from the ground through iron
pipes ! It was there that Bobbie had so often played during the
weeks preceding his death. Infection from the water may have
caused a condition of blood w^hich weakened the boy’s system before
the oncoming of diphtheria. Justification for the Communicator’s
opmion that the boy’s death might be attributed to his playing there
is found in a statement by the Medical Officer of Health for the
district. His letter will be quoted in full. Let us now take the sittings seriatim.
THE PEOBLEM OF THE PIPES.
Second Sitting, November 18, 1932.
Feda : Did you tell Bobbie’s people anything 1 felt about him
here ? (Hand touches medium’s throat.)
C. D. T. : Yes, that was right, throat trouble, he died from diphtheria.
Feda : 1 got it very strongly, that feeling, it is the same one that
Gladys had {i.e. Mrs Leonard, who once had diphtheria). Etta
says everything was done for him that could be done, he evidently
couldn’t be kept here.
C. D. T. : So sad for them.
Feda ; Oh, what does she mean ? She says he passed over with it. Explain that, Etta, will you ? Oh, all right—Etta says, yes, she
(14) feels he had diphtheria, but was his heart not strong ? Because
it seemed to her that it was not just the throat trouble that killed
him, it seemed to her there was something which affected his
heart apart from the diphtheria.
C. D. T. : I have an idea that the two things sometimes go together.
484 C. Drayton Thomas [part
Feda ; Etta says, I don’t think it was quite that. I wonder if he
had had something apart from the diphtheria, perhaps before the
diphtheria, that had been rather a strain on his heart, weakened
his heart in some way, so that the diphtheria was too much for it. Perhaps you can find that out. If it had not been for this condition of heart the diphtheria would not have been too much for
him. There was something that weakened his system before ; she
got a very strong feeling about that.
[Mr Hatch writes : “ Yes, the illness started with tonsilitis, turned to quinsy, and no doubt these weakened the heart.”
Apparently Etta meant more than this.]
Third Sitting, December 2, 1932.
(37) Feda ; Mr John says again he knows he is right about what he said,
that the people on earth might have put down about Bobbie’s
throat and the diphtheria causing his passing, but there was
something behind that, and, Mr John says, he feels certain he is right. There was something behind that condition ; he would
not have passed over with that condition alone, there was something before that.
[Mr Hatch writes : “We know of nothing except the tonsilitis and
quinsy which I have mentioned before ”. Note. In later sittings this elusive cause of a predisposition to infection is insisted upon and becomes an intriguing problem. Its final solution was reached during my visit to the house in the summer of 1933,
as will be seen when we come to my account of that visit.]
(38) Feda : Will you ask if there is anything they can trace to nine
weeks before, something that at the time might not have seemed
important ? Now, must be careful about this, nine weeks before
Bobbie passed over there was something that ought to have been
very significant in the face of his passing, something that, in a
sense, led up to his passing, but not the weakening process that
they spoke of before ; it was not the something that weakened
him, but nine weeks before Bobbie passed over there was something happening, something very significant that had a link with
his passing. Well, if it had happened to anyone connected with
you, you would have immediately linked up the two happenings —nine weeks before his passing and his actual passing.
C!. D. T. : I suppose you could not put in one word what this is ? Feda : I will see if I can put in a nutshell what I feel about it. Wait a bit, “ pipes, pipes ” ; well, he says just this—“ pipes ”. That word should be sufficient. Leave it like that.
C. D. T. : Was it Bobbie who was telling you about this incident
to do with pipes ? Feda : No, Mr John. He says, 1 asked Bobbie a few questions
before the sitting that I thought might have a bearing on his
earth life, and this was one of them.
143 ] A Proxy Case 485
[Mr Hatch writes : “ We cannot trace this at all. Nine weeks before
his passing I took him to Morecambe for a very short holiday, but
nothing of importance happened that I know of. The word ‘ pipes
’
conveys nothing to us.”]
In subsequent sittings this subject is repeatedly touched upon, and
the word “ pipes ” became our term for it. Not until my visit to
Nelson, in June 1933, did we find any justification for the word. It was then, on learning that Bobbie had kept a diary, that I asked to
see it, and at once turned to the date nine weeks before his death in
order to discover whether there might be anything relevant to the
above. My search was successful. The date, June 13, 1932, con- tained the statement, “ Had two ice creams ”
; and at June 15 were the words, “ joined gang ”. The mention of ice creams suggested possible infection, and the second entry aroused curiosity.
Nine weeks before the boy’s death on August 12 would be June 10,
which is but a few days from the date on which he joined the gang.
I inquired what was meant by the “ gang ”, and learnt that it was
a secret society formed by Bobbie and one or two of his boy friends ; they used to play at having adventures, and chose for the place a
spot in the locality which I shall describe when giving an account of
my visit to Nelson. It is called The Heights. This spot was decided
upon in March and used for play during the summer. The visit to
Morecambe, which was for three days at the end of June, would seem
to have no bearing on our quest.
Fourth Sitting, January 13, 1933.
(70) Feda : Bobbie thinks all the time that there was something that
would be wrong with him first, that caused him to take it. C. D. T. : I don’t think his family know of that.
Feda : There was.
C. D. T. : Is that what he thinks now ? Feda ; He does : he had been told there was something in his case which was making it easy not only for him to get it, but not to be
able to throw it off when he did get it. [Mr Hatch : “ His tonsils were unhealthy : this may have caused
him to take it.”]
Feda ; 1 don’t know what you mean, Bobbie, you say you got yours
from the pipes.
C. D. T. : That is curious, because my father said that previously
and Bobbie’s people can’t find any connection with pipes.
Feda : 1 think Bobbie is a very clear-minded boy, he seems very
intelligent.
[Mr Hatch replied to this : “ We don’t know. 1 think it is very
unlikely that Bobbie had heard of anyone catching the disease from
pipes.”]
486 C. Drayton Thomas [partFifth Sitting, January "21
,
1933.
C. D. T. : Etta, about the “ pipes Bobbie’s people still can’t
trace them. If Bobbie could tell them anything about the pipes it would be very interesting.
(80) Feda : It was not in his home. It was not in a place where he wasregularly. There was a place that he went to, notfrom his home,but while he was in a second place he went to a third one, andthrough these—what he calls pipes—he picked up the condition
which was not the cause of the trouble in the first place, but it introduced a destructive element which resulted in diphtheria.
(81) Feda : You know I told you, didn’t I, that there had been a wrongphysical condition of Bobbie’s for some time before, not a goodcondition at all ; but he went somewhere, you see, not straight
from his home, to this other place ; while he was at the second
place, outside his home, he went to a third place where the pipes were wrong, where he introduced into his system this poisonouscondition—where he infected his system.
[Here I must anticipate by giving the interpretation which was only
arrived at eight months later than the date of this sitting.
Mr Hatch wrote me on September 27, 1933, after we had discovered
the first pipe : “ He would go from the ruined hut, where we believe he
played in the Delf, to the pipe which, as you will remember, was quite
apart in the open space beyond the Delf.” The Delf would be the secondplace from which he went to the pipes.]
C. D. T. : I wonder where they will be able to trace that place.
Feda : He is trying to think. I think Bobbie is there. (Handpoints.)
C. D. T. : There ? Oh, good, perhaps he can tell father.
(82) Feda : He is getting this from him. I get a feeling wherever this
place was, of there being animals you call cattle. Mr John says,
make a point of this. I am quite sure of this ; yet his people maysay when they first read it that he never went to a place wherethere were such things. But he did. We know we are right in this
matter, and that if inquiries are quietly persisted in, it mayeventually come to light. Bobbie himself is wishful that this
might be so, and two or three friends of his who have passed over
are also helping, so that, sooner or later, the matter will be brought
to light in what will appear to be an accidental and yet natural manner.
(83) Either before or after Bobbie caught it there—we think after
there was something done to apparently improve matters with
regard to those “ pipes There was something altered that
probably now has improved the condition, made it safer ; it wascertainly unsafe before.
143] A Proxy Case 4S7
“ A 2)lace he went to . . . pipes.” As I have found it necessary to
introduce a reference to our final solution of the “ pipes ” problem,
it may be well to give the complete story here. This was for long a
puzzle to the family, as they knew of no place answering to this description. “ Cattle . . . his people may say ... he never went to a
place where there were such things.” “ Before or after . . . there was something done to improve matters with regard to these pipes.”
“ The matter will be brought to light in what will appear to be an
accidental and yet natural manner.”
Note how the above remarks fall into line with the following facts. On July 1, 1933, I visited “the Heights” in company with the
family. First we inspected the lower portions of the ground, and
then explored the disused and overgrown quarry, locally termed
“ the Delf ”. On leaving this I noticed a shed somewhat higher up
the hill and near the road which bounds the area on its topmost side. On nearing this shed the ground showed marks of animals, and hay
was visible in the shed. We therefore examined this shed and found
that one end of it was used as a stable, and the other end had stores
of hay and straw for bedding. One end was open, and this fact
excited interest, since one of the clues was “ an open end ”. Indeed,
this shed answered in several particulars to descriptions given in the
sittings, as also did the surroundings. (All these points will be found
in later sittings.) While we stood there a woman approached. I made some remark about the fine view ; she responded suitably, and
we entered into conversation. With the puzzle of the “ pipes ” still revolving in my mind I inquired whether she knew if children came
to play in the quarry. She replied that they did, and that they sometimes made mischief, that among other misdeeds they had “ broken
the pipe ”. The mention of a pipe in connexion with this spot to
which Bobbie’s descriptions had led us, and wdiich we already knew
answered in several ways to those descriptions, inspired hope that
we were on the right track. Further inquiries elicited the information that there was a spring part-way down the hill, where water
issued from a pipe. She added that they now had the town water
laid on, and so were not dependent upon the pipe. 1 gathered that
this alteration had been made some years before.
We then walked down the slope to see the spring. Water issued
from the hillside by the side of the displaced pipe, an iron pipe
several feet in length. Past this pipe the water trickled down the
slope in a small channel of its own making.
We had discovered one pipe, and it was in the place to which the
clues given in the sittings had led us. We saw no second pipe, and
why the word was used in the plural we failed to guess. Our discovery of this pipe was entirely due to the meeting with our infor2 k
488 C. Drayton Thomas [part2 nant. It is unlikely that we should have seen the spring and its pipebut for her remark ; for we had visited the same locality a few daysliefore and had not suspected its existence. The pipe is inconspicuously placed, and not visible until one goes quite near, being hiddenby the formation of the ground.
A letter from Mr Hatch dated September 27, 1933, says : “ Sinceyour visit last June I have been to the Heights several times, andon one occasion I came across water running from another pipe in
quite another direction from the first one, but nearly as close to theDelf—it was about three minutes’ walk from it. This pipe protrudesover a kind of trough filled with water, and is tucked away at theend of a footpath. Mr Burrows and I made the discovery.”
Thus was the term “ the pipes ”, used by the communicators eversince December 2, 1932, found, in the following September, to bejustified by the discovery of two pipes situated in the immediatevicinity of the place frequented by Bobbie and his friend.
Having thus glanced at the end of the story, let us continue theJanuary 1933 sitting.
(84) Feda : The animals will be the best clue. He understands fromBobbie— he says Bobbie seems to suggest to him that his parentswere not so familiar with this place, or did not go to it to the sameextent that he did.
[“ Animals the best clue.” Yes, it was the sight of animal trackswhich led us to examine the shed. “ Parents not familiar with this
place ” ; they had not seen it. Bobbie once brought his mother to viewthe Heights from the lower road, but, finding it would be some distance,
and the weather being inclement, they returned home.]
(85) Feda ; There was another boy mixed up in this, who went to this
place and seemed to be the reason for Bobbie going.
[” Another boy.” Yes, “ the gang ” comprised Bobbie and his friendJack, and they had decided upon this place as their field of operations.
A letter dated November 8, 1933, from Mr Hatch says : “ Did I tell you that I questioned Jack about the pipe that we first found on theHeights and he admitted that he and Bobbie played with the water ?”]
C. D. T. : I wonder what sort of a place it was and where ?
(86) Feda : Wait a minute, I am getting a feeling of it not being quitea country place.
[This is accurate.]
C. D. T. : I wonder what Bobbie did when he was there ?
(87) Feda : They are showing me places like stables now ; you knowwhat barns are, well, like barns and stables. I am getting strawin big bundles, I have got to call it a barn, with one side nearly, or all, open more like a shelter place.

(88) I don’t seem to be quite in the country, there is so much
building round that it hides what country there may be.
The shed is a stable at one end and a store, or small barn, at the
other. “ One side nearly or all open, more like a shelter place ” : an
exact description. (See Fig. IV.) “ Building round hides what
country there may be ” : there are buildings near which hide the
view in two directions, yet there is an extensive view over Nelson
and the country from the front of the barn. So the description is not strictly correct. One may hazard the guess, however, that
Bobbie was giving his recollection of the prospect as seen from
within the Delf. From that position one sees nothing of the sur- rounding country, because the sides of the quarry and the building
bomid the view all round.

(89) Feda : I must not say this is anything to do with it, but I hear
water running, as if big taps were turned on, and water trickling, as if it is running into a kind of gutter or drain. Like a swilling,
they are trying to make me say the word “ swdlling ”. [Mr Hatch did not understand this, but, assuming that it related in some way to the pipes, replied, “ We still cannot trace this matter of
the pipes. We will make further inquiries.”]
These further inquiries were, how^ever, fruitless. It was not until three months after this sitting of January 13,
i.e. in March 1933, that the family accidentally learnt the "whereabouts of the gang’s playground ; but only on July 1, 1933, was
the mystery solved by our discovering the first of the two pipes. It was then fine weather and the water was only “ trickling ”, but after
heavy rains the sound would certainly convey the idea of “ swilling
for then the water comes out with a rush. It falls into a pool, which
overflows into a kind of gutter which runs down the steep slope of
the hill.
Sixth Sitting, February 16, 1933.
Feda : Bobbie says he is very pleased with the result of his messages, but there has been something that rather puzzled him.
He was puzzled because they could not make it out.
C. D. T. : Woidd he like to make it easier for them by giving
clues ? Feda : It was to do with what he calls “ the pipes ”.
C. D. T. : I thought so. That is the most important point of all, and the one that has puzzled them most.
490 C. Drayton Thomas [paetFeda ; He says, I know I am right about it ; and did he tell youbefore that the pipes were not at home ? [Mr Hatch replied to this : “ We are still very puzzled about the
references to ‘ the pipes
C. D. T. : Isn’t it a pity, Feda, that we can't get the name of the
place ? (Feda’s f>art of the following dialogue is reproduced in her characteristic diction.)
(96) Feda : I am getting a funny name, it sounds to Feda like Bentley.
This is what he calls a clue to it.
(97) Bentley and Stoo, something. Stock, Stop, begins Stoo.
(98) Feda : He is trying to show me—make me feel—a town, not a pretty town, it is full of streets, you know, streets full of ugly
jreople that does not know anything about Feda.
C. D. T. : You mean ugly streets and houses, not people.
Feda : No, ugly people, not the streets ; you see they doesn’t knowanything about Feda, or about this subject.
G. D. T. : “ But knowledge to their eyes her ample page.
Rich with the spoils of time did ne’er unroll.
Chill penury repressed their nobler rage.
And froze the genial current of their soul.”
Feda ; 1 should like to learn poetry. I don’t think they have got
many “ spoils ” of anything, and they all goes miserable andlooking on the ground, and coughing and sneezing and being
awful unhappy.
C. D. T. : Did Bobbie tell you this ? Feda : Yes, and they are going down hill where shops is andhouses and they goes down this hill and they come to a cross road ; and I think there is a big station fhere ; because there is a bridge just down that turning.
One of the cross roads leads to a dark bridge where trains goes
what you say “ expectorating ” like that, ch—ch—ch— andblowing out sparks and stuff. That is what a lady told me is right “ spectorating ”. And then if you does not turn down to where the trams is you go straight up a hill opposite you, and I see Bol)bie going up that hill, and 1 am following him up it, andhe is getting a little bit away from the town part, he is getting more towards houses and less shops and cleaner and less of the
poor miserable people. It feels a bit brighter, you see, there.
Oh, now I am getting the name again that sounds like Ben or Bentley.
Mr Hatch’s comments are given below. Enclosed with them wasa rough sketch which I have embodied in the lower part of the onehere shown (Plan 2).

Bobbie’s School. In the Churchyard higher up, mentioned before in the
sittings, are the Stocks used long ago for ill-doers. But we can see no
connexion between these and the ‘ pipes ’. It is true that it is cleaner
and brighter as you go up the hill. “ It seems from this sitting, and from a previous one, that Bobbie went
from School to the place where the pipes were. But, so far as our knowledge goes, the only place answering to this description is the Baths, and
this does not fit in with the account of a barn-like place, with hay, etc.”
The solution was reached at a much later date, namely, on July 1,
1933.
492 C. Draylon Thomas [partThe effort for a name, Stoo, Stop, etc., once achieved “ Stock ”,
which is almost Stocks. The Stocks are just inside the entrance ofthe Churchyard previously mentioned.
I have marked the described route by a dotted line in the map.The description seems to start from Bobbie’s home and, going downhill, takes left-hand turn to railway station and railway bridge ; turning back from the tram lines, which would be reached if oneshould proceed some yards further, it goes uphill past his home againin the direction of the Church, passing one end of Bentley Street,
which Bobbie would specially remember, as his School was there.
Mr Hatch wrote on March 17, 1933, “ First with regard to theroute which you have traced on the map : It certainly does agreewith the description, and I agree that it seems to reveal an ultimateknowledge of the locality. It is somewhat puzzling to understandwhy this particular route should have been described.”
Sixth Sitting continued.
(99) Feda ; There is somebody there called “ Phil ”, it sounds to Pedalike Phil. Will you tell them that the name Phil is a clue ? (100) Feda : There was a boy called Peter who knew this place too. Bobbie is not quite sure whether his real name was Peter, butthey called him Peter. And, wait a bit, and another boy whosename sounds like Eric or Alec.
Mr Hatch, in referring to the above, wrote, “ We are trying to
trace the names Peter, Alec or Eric, but have not succeeded yet,
also Phil.”
Bobbie often talked of his school companions, but the names of
many of these are not remembered by the family.
In the above-quoted letter of March 17, 1933, Mr Hatch said : “ With regard to references to the ‘ pipes ’ I may say that we seemat last to be on the track of what has been insisted upon so fre- quently. The references seem to point to a place which had beenvisited by Bobbie and a boy friend, and by them only. Neither his
mother nor I had ever been there. Perhaps I had better not say
more at present as some more information may come through. Wecannot trace the names of his friends that were given. Do you think
it will be possible to get any further information about Bobbie’s
visits to the place where the ‘ pipes ’ were ? ” The family tell me that, in view of this possibility, they thought
it better not to question Bobbie’s friend Jack, but to see if Bobbie
could solve the mystery himself.
143 ] A Proxy Case 493
Eighth Sitting, March 24, 1933.
(107) Feda ; Etta says 1 am perfectly certain that they will verify the
evidence about the pipes.
C. D. T. ; 1 would like you to give them all the help you can
because it would be such a good point.
Feda : She says, a very good evidential point indeed. And,
bearing that in mind, will you write and ask them not to tell you anything they discover until we have given you a little more about it ? in case they should write and tell you something
that we might be just waiting to give you.
Ninth Sitting, April 10, 1933.
(Early in the sitting came the following dialogue :) C. D. T. ; I want to ask about little Bobbie, have they heard anything more about him ? Feda : Would you like them to get any more about him ? C. D. T. : Well, it was all very interesting, and I think it would be
worth while getting more. 1 am eager that his people should
find out about those pipes ; if 1 could help them to do that we
might finish the case, but we can’t really finish the case until
they have found out about the pipes.
Feda ; Mr John thinks they are on the track.
(Later in this sitting the subject was continued thus :)
(108) Feda : Something has just come to Mr John’s mind about Bobbie,
he wondered whether he had given it before. Has Bobbie ever
said anything at the sittings about a brook or inland water ? It seems to be some special piece of water, and he would often go
to a place situated close to this water, it almost feels like swampy
to Feda.
C. D. T. : That was mentioned once, but not a brook, merely a
little place near a stile where water was. (See No. 45.)
Feda ; No, it is not to do with that either, another place alto- gether. It is rather important to him, as if he did something
rather special there.
Mr Hatch replied to this, “ The reference to a brook or inland
water might mean a boating pool which he liked to visit, but the
swampy condition is incorrect.”
On my visit to Nelson in June 1933 it was explained that on this
boating pool in Thompson’s Park Bobbie used to row in the canoes. On July 1 I paid my second visit, during which we found the first of the pipes on Marsden Heights. It was w’hen reconsidering this
paragraph (108) after that visit that I noticed how perfectly it applied to the place where w*e saw water issuing from the pipe.
(See Fig. V.) The water made a small pool and swampy area around
494 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe spot where it issued from the hill. If this w^as a reference to the
“ pipe ” place it would be specially relevant in view of my request
early in this sitting, and conversation about Bobbie’s people being on the track of the place. I incline, therefore, to think that this
alludes to the place where “ the gang ” used to play and where welater discovered the pipe.
Tenth Sitting, May 19, 1933.
(115) Feda : Now, look, he wanted to say that he thought that they were
on the track of what he spoke about, the trouble he spoke about,
that had a connexion with his passing.
0. D. T. : Can you help them any more about it ? I have notheard whether they have found it or not. Feda : Well, now, he says this, that they were on the right track,
but there has been a difficulty, they have been held up in their
investigations. Bobbie has been expecting this, and he is not
disappointed about it, because he felt it was going to be difficult,
he felt there would be obstacles in the way of proving it, or bringing it to light. You see, there are two different bodies of
people to contend with. He says they know what I am talking
about, two different bodies, and neither of them would make it easy, but one might make it easier than the other.
[Mr Hatch wrote : “ PerhajDS we had better leave this till we can talk
it over with you ; there is a strange confusion with parts very correct. The mystery might have been already solved by this time, for anything I knew to the contrary ; but Bobbie seems to have been aware ofthe progress of events.
“ Two ... to contend with ”, the family interpret this as meaningthat they were divided as to the places meant, which was indeed the fact at the date of this sitting.]
(116) Feda : “ Underground ”, something to do with taking up ground,underground. I don’t know what he means, but this is what hesays ; he can’t hel]) them very much more about this just now.[This is vague, but may possibly have been an endeavour to indicate
the spot where we eventually found the pipe and a small stream issuing
from the ground.]
(117) C. D. T. : Bobbie, I am going there in about a month’s time ; if
I wanted to go to the place where the pipes are, and wished to
start from the Railway Station— do you know what I shoulddo ? I should walk up the hill past your house ; and when pastyour house and a little uphill, what ought I to do then ? Is thatthe right direction ? Feda : Yes, and there is another way to it, past the school. Hesays, I should think past the house and keep straight on.
C. D. T. ; Yes, and what am I to look out for ? Would the placebe on the main road or should I have to turn somewhere ?
143] ^4 Proxy Case 4it5
(118) l^EDA : It seems to i)e on the right. I don’t think it is very far
from the main road, I think it is on it. [My question was based upon the sketch map sent by Mr Hatch to
illustrate a previous sitting. I aimed to provide Bobbie with a starting
point from which he might describe the route to the pipes. It so happened that my suggested route was c[uite in order, for that is one way
to Marsden Heights.
“ Another way past the school ” ; this is correct. “ Turn right ” ; correct. One goes past the Church some distance
and then turns up a short blind road on the right. A gate at its end
opens on to the Heights. (Cf. Plan 3.)]

Hill
496 C. Drayton Thomas [part(119) Ff:i)A : On that main road he shows me it goes uphill, all the wayalmost, not just a little bit of a hill. Now for a good distanceis it more open on the left than right 1 You see a main road,and yet I feel spaces. It is not all built on, there are lots ofbuildings, but lots of spaces as well. He says there are still some sjraces. The whole of that main road is rather a mixture.This main road at one time was not much built on, and it hasbeen much built on lately, like a mixture of space and newbuildings.
C. D. T. ; Then I go on up the hill and what do I come to ?
(120) Feda : Is there a place with an address on ‘ B ’ ? He is trying towrite it up on a board. The place seemed to be close to a placewhere he went to. He went to this ‘ B ’ place at certain times.I had l)etter wait and see. [“ Uphill ” is correct ; “ Spaces and buildings ” also correct. InBobbie’s time it was still more open on the left-hand side than on theright. “ Place' B
’ ”, the Marsden Heights, in which the pipe was found,is in the Brierfield Urban District. “ Went at certain times ” ; this locality was the chosen play place of“ the gang ”.]
C. D. T. : Don’t you mean the Baths, Bobbie ? Feda : He does, it was connected with and mixed up with the bathssomehow.
C. D. T. : Is it within the same walls, under the same roof ?
(121) Feda : Isn’t it a nuisance I can’t quite get that ? Don’t ask himthat, I think there is something he is trying to get. I have gotto be awful sure about this—the place that he would go in thedoorway—because it is on the corner of the side road, and I getthe feeling that often he would go a bit down the side road toget to the j)lace where he went.
It seems clear now that, at this point, I introduced much confusionby assuming that the letter ‘ B ’ stood for the Baths ; for Fedaaccepted my idea and referred to it as the Baths under the impressionthat Baths was the correct name. My second question about being under a roof evidently puzzledand confused, and f|uite naturally so, if I am right in my surmisethat the boy w'as describing an out-of-door place. “ Doorway at corner of side road ”
; the gateway into the Heightsis at the left corner at the top of the short, blind road. Bobbie wouldgo through it to get to the gang’s playing spot near the water pipe inthe hill side.
Sitting continued.
C. D. T. : I want to ask him if he had been drinking the water atthe Baths.
143] .4 Proxy Case 497
(122)
Feda : He knows what he had been told it is. He has been told
that this was the cause of it. You know what he would call the
baths—I am letting him say what he wants to, because you can
see if he is accurate—He says he thinks what he remembers is that a part of this building is not quite the same. You puzzled
him a bit asking whether it was near the building, because it was not all built at the same time, there was something that
had to be built on afterwards. When it was thought to be all complete there was something added to it, quite a good big
portion.
“ You know what he would call the baths ”
; here Feda accepts
my term for the place in question and alludes to it as “ the baths ”. We must, however, keep in mind the probability that what Feda and
I are terming “ the Baths ” is really the place which Bobbie and my
communicators call “ the pipes ” or “ B ”. Let us see if what follows
will apply to the latter place ; for it certainly does not apply to the
Baths.
“ You puzzled him . . . something built on afterwards.” This
addition to a building correctly describes the shed or barn by the
Delf : this erection shows clear evidence of having been added to
from time to time. It is a home-made structure of wood and corru- gated iron put together as need arose. It is quite likely that an
observant boy would have noticed these additions.
Sitting continued.
(123) Feda : Is there a district there that begins with the letter ‘ H
’
near the baths, a longish name ? He calls it the district. C. D. T. ; I’ll inquire.
(124) Feda : You see, he knew somebody living in the ‘ H ’ part that
used to go to the same place.
[The Marsden Heights were always called by Bobbie “ The Heights ”. Who is meant by “ somebody ” is uncertain. There are alternative
explanations.]
(125) Feda : Look, you have been going up hill, haven’t you ; suppose
you were to go down to the right, like a side way, when you have
gone up a hill, you wouldn’t go very far to the right before you come to a place that was—There are no cliffs there, are there ?

he is trying to make me feel such a peculiar place, it feels to me
almost like a drop, a kind of abrupt drop down, not an ordinary
hill. And as if there is still some evidence of it being there, but
not quite as it was.
The above correctly describes a road to the right, after one has
come uphill from Bobbie’s house, and a walk by the quarry alluded
to in a previous sitting (Cf. Nos. 41-44). “ Not c^uite as it was ”
;
498 C\ Drayton Tkonuis [partin Bobbie’s time a stile separated this walk by the quarry from theside road. The stile has since been removed, and jjrotective railings
now separate the path from the abrupt edge of the quarry. The sidesof the quarry are like cliffs.
Sitting eontimied.
(126) Feda : And you can get to that place by walking up the hill andturning to the right near the baths ; not, perhaps, the best way,but you could get so. [This short paragraph summarises the foregoing and is perfectlycorrect if one substitutes “ Brierfield Heights ” for the Baths ”.]

500 C. Drayton Thom,as [partPART III
Before proceeding to discuss the significance of the foregoingmessages it may be convenient to notice in brief summary how theevidence accumulated month by month from November 1932 to
May 1933.
In November, December and January we find Etta, John, andfinally Bobbie himself expressing the opinion that Bobbie’s illness could be traced to something connected with pi]>es. (14, 37, 38, 70.)
An event nine weeks before death will be a clue. (38.)
In January my request for further clues brought the informationthat these pipes were not at the boy’s home ; that animals woidd bea guide to their position ; that Bobbie’s people did not know of the])lace, but that he went there with another boy. As a further clue
there was described a barn or stables. (80, 82, 84, 85, 87.)
In February the route leading to these pipes was described in
part. (96, 98.)
In March Etta expressed certainty that the pipes would betliscovexed. (107.)
In May Bobbie gave directions pointing to the exact locality
where the pipes were eventually found. (117, 118, 119, 120, 123,
126.)
In Jidy the first of the two pipes was discovered and the secondin September.
No maps of Nelson were to be had, either in guide-book or local
directory, and it was not until these sittings were over and the pipesfound that I ins|)ected ordnance survey maps, both the large scale
and the small. I found springs indicated, but no mention of pipes.
My knowledge of Nelson was restricted to the fact of its being a manufacturing town, united with others in a valley, and that thesurrounding country was hilly. Mrs Leonard was told nothingwhatever aljout the subject of these sittings, nor did I mention thej)lace to Feda.
We have seen that the information given about the existence andwhereabouts of these pipes was correct. Let us now consider whetherthere was justification for the opinion, so confidently expressed, thatBobbie’s death might be attributed to the pipes.
The water issuing from the hillside is pure, but it falls into pools, one of which is on the open hillside where it would be visited by wildbirds, poultry and animals.
At my request the Brierfield Medical Ofticer of Health, Dr J.
143] A Proxy Case 501
Strachan Wilson, M.B., C.M., visited the place. He afterwards sent
me the following report ; Town Brierfield,
Lancashire, February 21, 1934.
Dear Sir,
Your letter of the 10th instant, re springs on Marsden Heights,
to hand.
Mr Haigh, the Sanitary Ins]jector, and myself visited the two springs
you mention. The water in both pools is obviously liable to contamination from surface water and is not fit for drinking purposes. Any
person, child or adult, might develop a low or even an acute infection
from the drinking of such water.
We have had samjiles of the water issuing from the hillside, in both
cases, analysed, and the analysis shows that the water from both sources
is suitable for drinking.
Yours faithfully,
J. S. Wilson,
Medical Officer of Health.
That verdict about the pools into which the pipe water falls is decisive. We are certain that Bobbie frequently played by this water
during several weeks ; then came an illness which, beginning with
tonsilitis, turned to quinsy and then to the diphtheria which over- came him.
The accompanying photograph of the pipe and pool nearest to the
Delf shows how close is the surface of the water to the mouth of the
pipe. The fall is only two inches. Bobbie’s friend, Jack, says that
they “ played with the water ”. A boy who was playing with water
as it issued from the jiipe could scarcely avoid wetting his hands in
the contaminated pool below. Those wet hands might easily convey
infection to the mouth, either by wiping on handkerchief or by
cupping them for a mouthful of water from the pipe. Bobbie lived
in a healthy part of Nelson and there were, as I am informed by the
local Medical Officers of Health, only two other cases of diphtheria in
Nelson at that time, and four in the Brierfield area. There our definite information ends.
The communicators may or may not have been correct in con- cluding that Bobbie’s death was caused directly or indirectly by his
playing with this water. We cannot be certain, nor would the proved
truth or error of their opinion affect the evidence that they were in
possession of facts on which such a conjecture might reasonably be
based. These facts were : the existence and locality of the pipes, the
pool into which the water discharged, the frequenting of this place
by the boys and their playing with the water. Anyone acquainted
with these facts might have suspected that the throat affection
C. Drayton Thmnas [partwliich followed was traceable to tbe contaminated water. But no oneon earth had the least suspicion of this until it was stated in the courseof these sittings.
What makes the incident really remarkable from the evidential
point of view is that the members of Bobbie’s family were entirely
ignorant of the facts, and that the only person acquainted with them,be,sides Bobbie himself, was his companion Jack—certainly a mostunpromising and unlikely source of telepathic information on thesubject. Yet the existence of this water was asserted and reassertedduring a period of six months, and the pipes were finally discoveredby our following up the clues given.
Whence, then, came the knowledge so clearly displayed ? Was it from minds on earth ? Doubtless many persons were aware of those])ipes on the Heights ; yet it is certain that not one among them eversuspected that I was taking .sittings on behalf of Bobbie’s family.
That fact was private to the few persons in Bobbie’s group. Theonly others who knew, namely, my stenographer, my wife and I, were unaware of the exi.stence of the Heights. No one person knewboth facts, viz. that the pipes existed, and that I was inquiringabout Bobbie. Whence, then, came the information ? It is a])roblem which I commend to the attention of those who may hesitate to share my conviction that Bobbie Newlove and his friends in
the Beyond gave the mes,sages.
Telepathy from minds on earth is regarded by some as an alternative hypothesis to communication from the departed.
There is little to be said for it. We have no record of long andfletailed messages being conveyed from one person to another bytelepathy. Whether spontaneous or experimental, telepathy is always fragmentary.
Consider our .story of the pipes. There were no people on earthwho knew the two facts which are so emjrhatically and continuouslyinterwoven in the sittings, viz. (1 ) that Bobbie played with the wateron the Heights, and (2) that I was trying to get from him messagesfor his people. These two facts were, however, known to some veryacute intelligence somewhere, who made use of them during a period
of six months in face of incredulity by Bobbie’s people and ourfailure to understand.
This knowledge about the ])ipes—which proved to be accurate
could not have come by telej^athy from Bobbie’s home circle, becauseno one there was aware of the existence of the pipes. Members ofthe “ gang ”, on the other hand, would have no idea that Bobbiehurt himself by playing with the water, nor of the fact that I wasseeking to obtain messages from him.
Critics who wash to apply the telepathic hypothesis to this case
1431 A Proxy Case 503
will need to assume, without any justification for such an assumption,
that thoughts pass between people who have not heard of each other
and between whom there is no link save that they were interested
in a person who died. And further, the selection must be assumed
to act with unerring discretion, so that no facts are allowed to pass
which do not relate to the inquiry in hand. In short, everything vnust happen exactly as if an intelligent supervisor were obtaining information from the deceased for the purposes of the inquiry.

Doubtful remark about the pipes having been rendered

Wrong opinion about Bobbie’s constitution being good.
Wrong opinion as to Bobbie’s ability for drawing.
It is of special interest that the communications contain several
statements upon matters happening at the date of these sittings,
i.e. many months after the boy’s death.
Were there no evidence to the contrary, it might have been suggested that such information had come telepathically from the
people at Nelson. The evidence of the “ pipes ”, however, gives no encouragement to those favouring that hypothesis.
Other attempted alternatives, such as Universal Memory, or unlimited Clairvoyance, do not help us. I can think of no explanation which fits the facts save that of the boy’s continued interest in,

descriptions of streets and roads around his home, even mentioning
the street which must have been specially familiar to him because
his school was there.
The replies to questions sent by Bobbie’s people show intimate
knowledge of the boy’s interests both within the house and else- where.
In response to my persistent inquiry as to the whereabouts of the
pipes, there was given a mass of information which was finally found
to be correct, although much of it was entirely imknown to Bobbie’s
relatives. Above all, there emerged in the course of the sittings a
suggestion which had never occurred to anyone, and which related to
the probable cause of the child’s death. Investigations following up
the clues given have shown the extreme probability that the communicators were right in their surmise, and that the boy’s system was injuriously affected through his playing with contaminated
water in a place of which his people knew nothing—and of the
existence of which they remained sceptical for a period of six months.
This is conclusive evidence that the messages did not emanate from
minds on earth ; for no one who knew of those pipes had the least
suspicion that I was receiving messages relating to Bobbie Newlove,
or, indeed, of my existence. On the other hand, I had not the least
knowledge of the Marsden Heights or that Bobbie had played at any
place where there was contaminated water. My knowledge of
Bobbie and his home was hmited to what his people wrote in com-
508 C. Drayton Thomas [part
meriting upon each sitting as the records reached them. What they
wrote has been stated under its respective dates, and it will be
observed that I was told nothing which could have enabled me to
elaborate the messages, even had I been sufficiently unprincipled to
wish to do so. We have, therefore, a feature which is probably unique in the
records of psychical research. It is this surprising expression,
definite, emphatic and repeated, of an opinion which had no exist- ence in the thought of any person on earth previous to its emergence
at these sittings. No clairvoyant inspection of the Marsden Heights
would afford the medium information as to the reason why the boy’s
illness should have ended fatally ; leakage from human minds andthe supernormal acquisition of information by the medium’s unaided
faculty are both ruled out by the circumstances of the case.
Is there any alternative but to recognise the activity of extramundane intelligence, one which knew facts which were unknown to
the family at Nelson, and which based on those facts a conclusion
which is highly probable if not demonstrably correct ?

PART IV
THE MODUS OPERANDI AND INSIGHT INTO
TELEPATHY
In the foregoing series of trance messages we have found varying
degrees of success and failure. We may profitably study a few of
these with the hope of learning something about telepathic reception.
The immediate receiver is the Leonard-Feda combination, and my
view is that Feda first receives and then causes it to be voiced by
Mrs Leonard’s mind-brain-nerve-muscle mechanism. It is not
necessary to hold that hypothesis ; others may serve our immediate
purposes, which is simply to note how the receiver “ feels ” when the
information comes into consciousness. Some may like to think that
the information has first arrived telejjathically in the sitter’s subconscious mind, and that Feda perceives it there ; but, even so, Feda
must receive or obtain it from the sitter. We want to know how
information arrives.
Those who deem that a Control is but a secondary personality of
the medium have the same problem to solve. How does the idea
reach the medium’s consciousness, whether the primary or the
secondary consciousness ? How is the thought received ? When Feda said, “ Is there a place with an address on ‘ B ’ ? He
is trying to write it up on a board ” (see 120), what was actually
happening ? It may be guessed that someone changed the method,
as if hoping thereby to convey the required idea ; if the sense of
soimd did not respond, the sense of sight might do so. But how is that switching from sound to sight accomplished ? Is it by effort of
the communicator ? or does Feda shift the mechanism of reception?
We find her, at times, saying that they are mahitig her feel so-andso, or that what is being described gives her the feeling thus and thus : often she will seem to quote verbatim, then presently to fall back on
paraphrase. Do these variations indicate different forms which the
idea takes on reaching Feda’s consciousness, or do they denote
differences in the manner by which thought is sent to her ? Is it Feda or the communicator who decides the form ? Naturally, I have asked Feda, and the reply is, in essence, that she
tries one method and then another, but cannot use them simultaneously. That looks as if she can to some extent choose the form
in which the ideas reach her consciousness, but I doubt if that is the
whole secret. The following dialogue with Feda bears upon this question.
510 C. Drayton Thomas [part
C. D. T. : Sometimes for minutes on end you seem to get their very
words. I wonder what it is that makes that possible.
Feda : Mr John says, “ We find at one sitting that we can go on the
dictation method, and at another we have to make pictures
without dictation, and these we transfer, or we assist Feda in
transferring, to the brain of the medium. Whether we shall do
the first method or the second method it is not in our power to determine. We have to accommodate ourselves to your conditions. I am inclined to think—and I have exchanged ideas
with many serious investigators and we are all agreed—that it
is nothing whatever to do with our ability to communicate ; except, as I once remarked to you, some of us have a temperament
that fits us for communicating more than others.”
C. D. T. : That I can understand.
Feda : Mr John says, “ On many occasions I have come here prepared
to dictate to Feda ; and I have thought, ‘ Now the material
I have in hand to-day needs the dictation method ’, but I find
myself unable to dictate. I find a condition which makes it advisable to switch over to some other topic, unless the material
I have in hand could be shown pictorially. It is limiting—it holds us up.”
C. D. T. ; Have you noticed, Feda, what previous condition is best for a sitting that is to have much dictation in it ? Feda : Yes, I have noticed. If Gladys (Mrs Leonard’s name) has not
been writing letters, or thinking about letters, or reading letters that the postman brought, and she has been just thinking of
nothing at all that morning—especially to do with words—then
I get the dictation well. But if she does letters she thinks all the
time, “ This person needs to know so-so, and even if I don’t write
now this person wants me to say so-so ”. Now that isn’t good
for the conditions. She has worn herself out a bit about words,
you see. C. D. T. ; Is it that you don’t, then, hear the words plainly ? Feda : Well, I think it is that I can’t get them, can’t catch them in her
mind because her mind is tired of them, her mind has already hadenough of words.
C. D. T. : You don’t find the dictated sentences are there for you ? Feda : No. Etta says I am convinced that an area of the conscious
mind, or that part of the brain in which the conscious mind works,
has over it a kind of sensitised material like—let us say—wax,
and if it has been used for one thing it won’t take another impression.
C. D. T. : Like the sensitised gelatine of a photographic plate ? Feda : Yes, but at the same time you can’t very well make that into an
analogy, because we sometimes can get something else on that is very good. The “ wax ” will take something else, but it won’t
take what it has already been used for. Now that is what Etta
says, and she is right. If you take Gladys of a morning when she
143 ] A Proxy Case 51 1
hasn’t been worried or done letters but is just ready for a trance,
that’s a very good dictation time.
The reference to a broken stile, see No. 40, is peculiarly interesting
because, although the broken stile was there during Bobbie’s lifetime,
it had been removed before the date of this sitting.
Clearly, then, the description was given from the memory of one who had known the place in Bobbie’s lifetime, and not from any
clairvoyance of medium or Control : the latter hypothesis would
involve the difficulty of having to suggest how clairvoyance could
be directed to the right town, and then be able to trace, amidst its many scores of streets and paths, the particular route which had
been a favourite walk of the family.
There have been many occasions when proper names were pronounced easily and correctly. The conditions of which Feda has
been speaking were then, presumably, at their best ; but I find that
names usually present a difficulty.
An attempt to give the name Callow Bottoms illustrates this. It was at the end of a description of the neighbourhood in which he had
lived that Feda, speaking for Bobbie, said :
(140) Feda : “ There is a place ‘ C ’ close by, a long name sounding like Catelnow, Castlenow. There seemed to be two or three syllables,
like a Ca sound, cattle or castle something.”
The family comment was : “ The name given is like Catlow, a hamlet near here. Bobbie and I went there the day he was taken
ill, the last occasion that he left the house.” Wdien studying Bobbie’s
diary I noticed that almost the very last entry read—“ Went to
Catlow Bottoms. Sore throat. Went to bed.”
Remove two letters from Catelnow and we have Catlow.
Feda can sometimes give a name without difficulty, but should
there be any hitch, necessitating a second or third try, it is rarely
she achieves success. Her explanation is that, even when she hears
the name clearly, anxiety to get it voiced affects the medium’s brain,
causing a tension which hinders expression of the required word.
But often Feda cannot hear the name distinctly.
On referring to section 19-20 we find three initials given in lieu of
the full names. These initials were entirely appropriate to the
context, but Feda’s ignorance of the names which they represented
may be inferred from the remark, “ Does the girl’s name begin with
‘ J
’ ? ” Now the name was Jack ; as Feda was unaware of the sex
it is evident that she had not heard the name clearly. This error remmds one of her remark, “ Some of the thmgs I have got for them
512 C. Drayton Thomas [partI don’t understand, and just a little bit of a twist would give them awrong meaning.”
In this connexion we may refer to section 75, where Feda re- marked “ ‘ M ’ I think that would be the man’s name Whetherthat was a guess or an inference, it was wrong ? Feda apparentlydid not catch the name itself, but only the initial. Yet there havebeen occasions when it was quite evident that the actual name wasknown, whether to Feda or to the communicator, and yet could notbe pronounced by the medium.
Let us pass to a further point. It would appear that Feda is sometimes unaware that reference is being made to an objectpreviously described. The following seem to be illustrations of this : A few weeks before Bobbie’s death he had a short holiday atMorecambe, where, at some children’s sports, he won a salt-sifter ofglazed earthenware shaped like a dog. It was usually kept on thecorner of a shelf in the dining-room, and at dinner Bobbie had ahabit of rolhng it along the table and twisting and untwisting thecork at the bottom. In general appearance it is round, smooth andpolished. Note how curiously the reference to this article is introduced.
(54) Feda : “ You must not take it off the shelf, you must leave it onthe shelf near the corner.” Leave it on the shelf where the otherscould see it and have it. He used to take it sometimes—I thinkI have got this right—there was something that used to be on thecorner of the shelf, and sometimes Bobbie wanted it, and theyused to say, “ Leave it on the shelf in case the others want it —Something round and smooth and polished.
C. D. T. ; I wonder what he did with it when he took it in hishands.
Feda ; Was it a watch ? C. D. T. : Are you guessing, Feda ? Feda : I was only asking him, because it looked like a watch hewas holding in the palm of his hand.
C. D. T. : What does he say ? Feda : He seems to be twisting something like you do a watch ora clock.
C. D. T. : Winding it 1 Feda : Yes, winding something.
C. D. T. : Is it Bobbie showing this ? Feda : It is Bobbie giving it to me. It feels something like a watch.C. D. T. : It looks like a selected bit of evidence, but it just lacksthe definite indication. I could think of at least four things.
Feda : You had better not guess. He rolls it or winds it. It wasnot a watch. They still have it. It is not in that place, it hasbeen put somewhere else. Bobbie thinks it has been put in a
143 ] J Proxy Case 513
drawer instead of on the shelf. Is it on a plate ? He is giving me
the idea of a plate being near it.
The family recognised this as referring to the salt-sifter and in- formed me that it had been moved, but not into a di-awer, and that
it was now kept on a shelf just below the dinner plates.
At a later sitting this salt-sifter (if my supposition is correct) was
agam indicated.
(56) Feda : Had Bobbie a duck ? I will tell you what he is showing
me ; it looks something hke a duck. Will you ask if he had a toy duck ? I think that is right. I see it in his hand like as if he is pushing it towards me. I don’t think its legs is very long, or else he is holding his legs up a bit, but ducks have not got very
long legs. I think it must be a duck because of its legs.
Then Feda dropped the subject and, after some minutes of talk on
other matters, suddenly commenced to speak again about what I believe to be the same object, although it is very doubtful whether
Feda was aware that this was an attempt to make up for the previous
failure.
(61) Feda : Not the name Bobbie, but another name beginning with
‘ B ’ that was rather important in their house. I mustn’t say
sound because I am getting this by feeling. He gives ‘ B ’ by
sound, but now I get the feeling that this would seem to be more
like an animal’s name, or the name of a toy. It is something in
their house that he was very fond of, and he calls it a funny name
beginning with ‘ B ’, not a long name. Wait a bit—Ber, Bunkey,
Bussey. The name he is giving me sounds as if it began Bus or Bos.
Since it is said to be an animal’s or toy’s name which begins with
‘ B ’ it seems highly probable that Bobbie was tr}dng to describe the
salt-sifter which he won at Morecambe so shortly before his death
and which he greatly prized, always calhng it his Bow-wow. The
name Bow-wow agrees with the description, “ begmning with ‘ B
’ and not long ”. If this assumption be correct it further illustrates
how imrehable Feda’s clairaudience can be, for she said it sounded
to her like Ber, or Bunkey, or Bussey, a name begmning Bus or Bos.
Bobbie had spoken of his mother and a cap of which she had been
thinking, and went on to say (through Feda) :
(112) “ She came across something with a special badge on it. It is not
a heart exactly, but the lower part is shaped rather like a heart,
at the bottom it is heart-shaped. It is something like a straight
line goes through the top of it and a little upstanding piece comes
out of the top.”
514 C. Drayton Thomas [partThe reference to a cap may have been intended to lead up to a|;mention of his Jack of Hearts crown (Cf. 35), or it may perhaps havejsuddenly brought the latter to Bobbie’s mind, but the phrasing con-|fuses the heart with the crown op which it is fixed. “ Not a heartfexactly ” would be true of the crown. The rest of the description is i|accurate as apphed to the heart itself, but misleading on account ofibeing preceded by the words, “ the lower part is shaped rather likeija heart.” It is not surprising that the family reported they knew of!lno such badge.
On my visit to the house I asked if Bobbie had any badge on his\sports jacket, or other kind of badge. They knew of none, and wemarked this down as a failure. Later in the day I asked to see the;Jack of Hearts boards and cap, as I washed to photograph them.^When they were placed in position before the camera I noticed thatthe heart corresponded with the description of the badge. “ Something like a straight line goes through the top of it, and a little upstanding piece comes out of the top.”
This crown was part of Bobbie’s Jack of Hearts’ outfit, and if westudy the way m which this had been first given (see 34 and 35), wemay suppose that Feda was “ shown ” the boards, but that the capwas described to her in words. If that were so, it need not surprise usthat, when this cap w^as again described, after an interval of fivemonths, Feda did not recognise it. If we read sections 24 and 31, comparing the messages with theirverifications, we get the impression that Feda received the descriptions in so vague a form that she was unable to form a clear pictureof the objects intended. The idea “ building in a scullery ” reachedFeda’s consciousness as “ like building an outhouse.” The seconditem, which referred to fitting up a gymnasiimi, was spoken in a waywhich suggests that it came in fragments. It is evident that re-ception was not pictorial, but rather a succession of nebulous ideas.And is not this exactly how telepathic impressions are usuallyreceived by experimenters, and often, also, in cases of spontaneoustelepathic impressions ? How often we find that a recipient becomes“ aware of something wrong at home ”, yet is quite unable to saywhat the trouble may be.
The following illustration merits being given in full, even if in-volving some repetition of what has been said previously. Note thevague and partially inaccurate way in which the ideas are expressed.I state the facts first, and then give Feda’s wording.
One of Bobbie’s special interests was roller skating. Among thepeople he met at the rink was a child named Marjorie, who held asemi-professional post there. She was an accomplished skater andfrequently gave an exhibition before the commencement of the
143 ] A Proxy Case 515
hockey matches. Indeed, the home team termed her their Mascot
and she would begin their competitions by an exhibition of skating,
in which she finally drove a ball into the goal. She was a year or two older than Bobbie and they were great friends, as can be
gathered from the fact elsewhere stated that once, while she was away on a visit, Bobbie said to his mother, “ If I don’t see Marjorie soon I shall go mad ”. This was but a month before his death. He
often skated with Marjorie, and was familiar with this exhibition in
which she played with the ball—indeed, it is probable that he sometimes joined her in playing with it. And now, notice how this emerges in the sitting (39) :
Feda : Did I tell you last time about a girl, a little older than Bobbie,
that he was fond of. She seemed as if very kind to him, like giving up things to him and being very nice to him, and this girl
has been—I can’t get this quite—but it is something to do with
this girl and doing something with a ball that belonged to Bobbie.
I don’t think this is much good—you see I am not getting this
from Mr John now, I am getting it from Bobbie.—Something this
girl has been doing about a ball that Bobbie was fond of when he was here, the girl has been doing something with it.
I think there is no doubt that this refers to Marjorie and her
exhibition with the ball, but how vaguely expressed ! Does it not
give the impression that Feda only heard a few words here and there,
much as a deaf person catches the general trend of a discourse ? Or
shall we say that, while receiving the ideas, there were breaks in the
reception, and that in voicing the message Feda fills each break with
the word ‘ something ’ ? One notices that she says, “ It is something
to do with this girl ”, and “ doing something with a ball
On another occasion, after Bobbie had been giving a considerable
amount of information relating to the skating rink, I gathered that
the subject was concluded, because Feda said, “ He is losing it a bit,
he is going back a bit
I therefore sought to introduce a new subject by putting a question
sent by the family. I said, “ Bobbie, what did you keep in the bathroom cupboard ? Show a picture of it, think about it and let Feda
see.” (77.)
This is what followed. No reference was made to the bathroom
cupboard ; but instead came what appears to be a further reference
to the rink. It would seem that Bobbie either did not notice my
question or that he chose to ignore it because, in the interval, he had
recollected something further which he wished to say about the
skating rink.
Confusion not infrequently follows the putting of a question, for
516 C. Drayton Thomas [partthe communicator may disregard it and continue his previous line ofthought. Feda naturally assumes that it is the question which is being answered, and the sitter may fail to reahse that the communicator is calmly continuing just as if no question had been asked.
We have seen that the method of reception by the Feda-Leonardconsciousness is not, as a rule, clairvoyance. I gather that Feda“ sees ”, or “ is shown ”, when the objects in question are such as canbe easily pictured. An outstanding case of this clairvoyance formental pictures is found in section 34. The description of the boylooking over his sandwich board is most striking when comparedwith its verification. It seems as if Feda “ saw ” what her wordsdescribed. But apparently something went wrong with the latterhalf of the description, which contains the inaccuracies “sitting”,“ leaning a bit forward ”, “ crouching position ”. Were these latertouches due to Feda’s imperfect perception of a mental picture ? This seems probable. On the other hand, the inaccurate pointsadded to the description may have been given by my father, who,after all, would have only received his idea of the picture at secondhand from Bobbie. There is, however, an alternative siggestionwhich is not without interest. It may have been an instance of acomposite picture resulting from the commmiicator’s marginalthought mingling with the main idea which he was trying to project.For it is known that a second photograph was taken by a Pressphotographer, and in it Bobbie with his boards was among otherfancy-dress companions. Unfortunately, that negative was not used,and is lost or destroyed. Possibly Bobbie himself was adding towhat had been said by my father and unintentionally gave Feda ageneralised impression of his various attitudes while in the fancydress.
Clairvoyance was certainly not used in item 91, where one mighthave expected that it would have been a simpler method of transmitting the idea. Reference is made to an article of celluloid whichmight flame or explode. The verification of this object is sufficientlycertain. Why was it not “ shown ” ? The verbal method failed toget through so difficult a word as cinematograph, whereas clairvoy-ance would, one supposes, have produced a visual impression of thetoy which, if described to the sitter, could have been easily recognisedfor what it was. True, it would not have been sufficient, for clair-voyance could not have imparted the information that they “ wantedhim to stop using it ; they thought it might make a flame or ex-plosion ”. For that statement a definite thought had to be transmitted ; a “ feeling ” or a picture would not have conveyed the idea.And here it may be remarked that Feda uses the words “ see ”and “ feel ” with a certain amount of careful distinction, and will
143 ] A Proxy Case 517
always give me her exact impressions when I inquire by what means
she is getting such and such a fact. In these sittings we find numerous clearly-expressed and even long
and intricate descriptions. This is never achieved telepathically,
apart from mediumistic utterance. Telepathy, as we know it from
spontaneous occurrence and from experiment, is chiefly feeling,
rarely a transmission of clear-cut thought. Now we may ask, are the numerous clear-cut and accurate thoughts, which were ex- pressed in the course of these sittings, sent by persons at Nelson or not ? If they came from Nelson they would represent a triumph
which places them in a class of telepathy about which psychical
research knows nothing. But we have seen that the most outstanding feature of these sittings—the pipes problem—did not come from
people at Nelson. Telepathy from earth was ruled out. Consequently, we may, m my opinion, confidently assume that the information, so copiously and so accurately given, came from Bobbie
Newlove’s mind and was transmitted to Leonard-Feda. In other
words, it was not due to the telepathy which is familiar to psychical
research, whether in experiment or observation, but is an instance
of information imparted by one who had left the physical body
behind at death. Let the reader turn to section 130 and note the
boy’s description of his attitude towards his mother. Much of it would be far from true of most boys, yet it is recognised as being
“ remarkably correct ”. Now that I have met Mrs Newlove I can vouch for its perfect relevancy. Notice, also, that it rings true to the
boy’s viewpoint, and is not the kind of description which would have
been derived from his mother’s thought about him. Such a message
as this exceeds, in extent and in detail, anything known to have
passed from mind to mind on earth by extra-sensory channels. When
it is remembered that my only fink with the family consisted of
letters sent in acknowledgment of my report of sittings, that I knew
nothing but what these told me, and that the family were most
careful to give me no information likely to lessen the evidential value
of subsequent messages—remembering all this, it would be difficult to maintain the supposition that the medium was reading my mind,
or tapping the thought of unknown persons two hundred miles
distant in an unnamed town.
It may be asked why telepathy in the presence of a medium
should produce results so much better than does telepathy between
agent and subject under non-mediumistic conditions. Is it that those
between whom thought-transmission takes place during a mediumistic sitting are within a field of influence created by the medium ? Such a field of influence might render possible a community or interpenetration of sensation and thoiight. (The hypnotic experi-
518 C. Drayton Thomas [partments of M. Emile Boirac suggest this. See his Psychic Science,iRider 1918.) !I do not press this hypothesis, but offer it for consideration in|view of the fact that mediumistic messages are incomparably superior[in extent and accuracy to non-mediumistic telepathic messages.
The most puzzling question connected with the problem of the;Pipes relates to the difficulty experienced by the communicators intelling what they knew. It is evident that they knew the factsduring the six months which elapsed between their first hint andour final discovery. And there is no reason to doubt their wish tomake it plain.
Why, then, could not the facts have been stated in one shortsentence, such as, “ Bobbie played by the pipes where springs issueon the Heights ” 1 That is the question which I asked my fatherafter the mystery had been solved. His reply, which opens up thewhole subject of modus operandi, was, in substance, this—The diffi-culty lay in the necessity of fitting-in the information, of being ableat the opportime moment to fit it upon the medium’s brain, eitherpersonally or through Feda. The several parts of any messagewhich we desire to give may be likened to the separate pieces of apuzzle. “ I should wish ”, said he, “ to start with that piece whichwill enable me to proceed methodically, but I may find that I cannotconvey it to Feda, or that she cannot convey it to the medium. SoI have to give just whatever happens to fit at the moment. Then,suddenly, while the medium’s mental activity is running like amachine, I notice it bringing up something which harmonises with adifferent piece of the puzzle, and I hurriedly cast about to find thepiece that will fit. Even when the opportime moment comes, I maybe further embarrassed by failure to recall my prepared material.Hence it is necessary that I should provide clues, or associationlinks, with my own material, in order that I may recollect it iustantlywhen it is required. That which I hope to give must harmonise, orassociate with, what is uppermost in the medium’s brain, or I shallfail to attach it and to fit it in so that it will be taken. All happensin accordance with the laws of association. The brain does not takethat which is at the moment unsuited to it. I frequently wish tospeak on a particular subject, but cannot. I may try to lead up tomy desired topic, but that leading up to it is, in effect, ‘ padding ’. Much of a sitting may consist of that, and while the communicatorkeeps the brain-machine revolving in the hope that it will bringround something suitable to his purpose, the chances are that thesitter, being unaware of this, grows listless and weary because,although words are being spoken, they do not convey anything thathe wishes to hear. Did he fully realise what is going on he might
l43j ^4 Proxy Case 519
assist in giving us the opportunity for which we are waiting.
’
’ Finally
he added : “ Much depends upon the medium’s condition at the time, but the
sitter’s attitude also exerts its influence : keen interest freed from
anxiety is a great assistance, and although we dislike leading
questions, yet suitable questions will sometimes help.” That was
the pith of the reply.
We are, I think, better able to perceive his meaning if we recall
the difficulty sometimes felt by ourselves in speaking to others of
things we deeply feel. Very sensitive persons become keenly aware
of that difficulty : they feel, without realising how, that it is useless
to mention some particular subject, because it would be incompatible with the other person’s present state of mind. So we decide to
wait a more suitable opportunity lest the seed fall upon ground too
stony to receive it. It is the highly sensitive minds which feel this
most strongly, and it is, I think, beyond question that the mind of a medium in trance is super-sensitive. I imagine that the mind of
the communicator is vastly more so. VTien psychology achieves a more complete understanding of the
working of the average mind, and shows us the meaning of those
puzzling differences which we often notice in ourselves between one
time and another, it may help us to fathom the precise difficulties
of those "who, from life’s further side, strive to express their thoughts
to us by means of a stranger’s brain.

A FURTHER NOTE ON MR WHATELY CARINGTON’S
INVESTIGATION ^
By J. Cecil Maby
Mr Whately Carington’s reply to my Note in Proc. S.P.R. vol. xliii. (see p]). 362-70) would appear to justify some further remarks onmy side. Incidentally, I would also like to avail myself of thisopportunity to discuss certain general aspects of this class of investigation that were implicit, but not explicit in my earlier remarks ; my chief aim being not to oppose, but, if possible, to complement]\Ir Carington’s own attitude.
First, however, a few words regarding Mr Carington’s reply to myNote.
I am, of course, only too willing to admit that I am no professionalstatistician, and hence was compelled to rely, to some extent, onMr Carington’s own interpretation of his long and involved calculations. I hasten, therefore, to acknowledge his elucidation of one ortwo issues that may not have been altogether clear to some of thosewho had not been through the actual computations, nor employedthe analytical procedures advocated. I should, however, haveappreciated a little more lenity with respect to such misunderstandings, in view of the facts, first, that it is obviously impossiblefor anyone to be a master of every branch of science in these days,and second, that Mr Carington has, to some extent, misinterpretedmy remarks. Thus, when I speak of general reliability of theoriginal data I use the word reliable in its common connotation, notin any special statistical sense. Lastly, I fear that Mr Carington was a trifle perturbed by whatmay have appeared to him to be unjust criticisms of his admirablework. As, however, I have since reassured him privately that nosuch injustice was intended, there will be no need for me to commentfurther here on the somewhat terse tone of his reply to my previousNote, which, no doubt, was the result of mutual misunderstandingnow happily past.

had occasion to carry out many laborious sheets of numerical correlations and probable errors, and other estimates of like nature ; and I know well that graphical or other less rigid methods of analysis
of the data would not have yielded such conclusive or reliable
results. Moreover, I was careful, in my Note, not in any way to
question the value or excellence of Mr Carington’s analyses, as such.
To my mind, no question can well arise as to the merits of statistical
analysis : its value has long been proved in other fields, and, to- gether with our author, I regard it as an extremely powerful instrument—however incomprehensible and boring to the non-mathematical mind !
]\Ir Carington pomted out in his first paper that his chief aim was
to demonstrate a method, rather than to make any startling deductions with regard to the nature and constitution of human personality. Well and good ; but such deductions cannot thereafter fail to be drawn from so much careful work on the reactions of mediums
such as Mrs Leonard, Mrs Garrett and Herr Rudi Schneider, and
published withal in the Proceedings of this Society. Indeed, Mr
Carington himself has not failed to draw them. Incidentally, he
also tends to cast rather a gloomy shadow upon logical and non- mathematical methods of analysis and interpretation of psychological data, which, however, have long and well (if somewhat painfully and tardily) shed light on many obscure psychological problems.
Now, without pretending to make an irrefutable point, but simply
in order to help preserve a balance at this juncture, I would like
to suggest that, since our minds express themselves in words

i.e., non-numerical symbols of metaphysical ideas, thoughts and sensations—Human Psychology ^ must, therefore, also primarily concern
itself with words. That being so, numerical analyses would appear
to represent a secondary and, in a sense, highly artificial mode of
approach to the psychological life and structure of the mind ; though
not so, of course, as regards the physiological problems and quantities of the body and its nervous system.
It may, perhaps, be noted in passing, that abstract number in
^ N.B. that I am not speaking here simply of animal behaviourism. Since
they lack any clear and comprehensive language of self-expression, we cannot
rightly pretend to know anything whatever of the thoughts and feehngs of
dumb beasts, except by highly fallible analogy. So-called animal psychology
is a purely behaviouristic and physiological science into which true psychoanalysis can scarcely be said to enter. This point has an important bearing on the present enquiry. (See below.)
522 J. Cecil Maby [partitself has no reality, even in the mind of a mathematician. Forexample, what does the number 3, say, convey to the mind ? Either
it suggests three physical objects or sources of sensorial stimulus
of some sort, or else it is imagined as a graphic symbol on a piece
of paper, or, again, as the spoken sound “ three.” In the beast andilliterate savage, all psychological ideas may be said to refer to
])hysical objects or sensations ; in the more cultured and literate
mind they also possess a verbal symbology. Numerical symbology,indeed, also arises from cultural development and the progress of
civilized intercourse and barter ; yet I believe that one is justified
in assuming a science of numbers to represent a later developmentthan one of words. One may say, therefore, that the sentient mindis occupied primarily by purely sensorial ideas ; while, subsequently,
the idea and its word symbol become more or less inseparably inter- woven. In attempting to analyse the ideational content of a person’s
mind, therefore, we cannot well avoid devoting ourselves primarilyto verbal symbology and verbal inter-associations. Unhappily, suchassociations do not appear conveniently to offer themselves for
mathematical analysis, except, perhaps, of a very simple kind.
Physiological reactions, on the other hand, are evidently measurable,
quantitatively in ordinary space-time units. Such quantities, however, must ever remain purely secondary to the thoughts and feelings
themselves, which they cannot even be said to represent in symbolical form. At least, physiological quantities are no more or less than an indirect expression of the relative intensity and duration ofa given emotion ; whereas the concomitant (resultant or causative)
thoughts or feelings remain absolutely inviolable and unplumbedby such behaviouristic analyses.
Fortunately, however, since Mr Carington has interested himselfin behaviouristic response, the above facts do not affect his numericalcalculations. For the psycho-galvanic reflex is essentially a physiological reaction (though sometimes psychologically actuated), andword reaction times are, likewise, physiological concomitants ofpsychological processes. Numerical data are, therefore, here primarily in question. We have no more reason, however, for assumingthat such physiological reaction values are direct and proportionate
indices of concomitant psychological states ^ than we have for
assuming that the violence of an earth-worm’s struggles, whentrodden upon, are an index of its pain

seemingly so certain.
We have seen that Mr Carington, on his own admission, makes use^ As I hope shortly to show in a paper to be pubhshed on the subject, the
psycho-galvanic reflex, for example, is deplorably unreliable as an index even
to simple emotions (though useful in a general way) ; much more so in relation
to non-emotional psychological states, for intelligence tests, etc.
143] A Further Note on Mr Carington’s Investigation 523
of behaviouristic responses in his endeavour to analyse human
personalities. The reactions which he employs are not only primarily physiological, but they are also—or should be, if things are to go
smoothly of a reflex type. One may fau'ly state, therefore, that
Mr Carington has based his deductions, respecting the various
supposed personalities in question, upon behaviouristic reactions in
the bodily organisms of his three mediums, which are strictly of a mechanico-physical nature. The important question then arises : Precisely what do we mean by the expression human persoyiality I I beheve that the great majority of people use the term personality
with reference to psychological make-up ; that is to say, the term
refers to mental structures and attributes rather than to bodily ones. Hence, when Mr Carington employs behaviouristic tests and physiological data in his analyses, there can be very little doubt that what
he is investigating is the physiological organisms rather than the
psychological personalities of the supposed communicators and
controls. That being so, the further and yet more important
question now arises : Can the control of the medium’s organism, in
the trance state, by the invading personality be supposed to be so complete as to influence not only the medium’s mind (and hence
govern the organs of articulate speech via the appropriate nervous mechanism), but also the entire physiological mechanism, to the
extent of influencing reaction times, electrical skin resistance, etc. ? Of course, I do not wish to deny the ultimate possibility of such
complete control, amounting to actual possession of the bodily
organism (in the old sense) by the invading spirit, but it is undeniably a tremendous assumption, which, if proved, would settle
Anally the main problem of Psychology, namely : Do the spirit and
mind possess a discrete existence and autonomy outside of the bodily
organism, or are they not rather expressions, in another mode, of the
complex of physico-chemical activities that constitute a living
organism and may be of certain activities of the nervous system
in particular.
It appears clearly to me that the assumption of comj)lete bodily
and mental possession is imphcit in l\Ir Carington’s method ; and
he may be right in permitting himself that assumption. If, however, such an assumption were finally shown to be imjustified, and
yet such physiological changes of state in the medium were still found to occur under the given conditions, then we might see m that a sure proof of the fact that the soi-disant personalities were no more
nor less than alternative controlling personahties inherent in the one
original organism ; a proof of multiple personality, in fact. What a pity it is that the results of such a quantitative investigation cannot, in the nature of things, give us a decisive answer to the
524 -/. Cecil Maby [partquestion : Are these cases of true spiritual invasion and possessionfrom without, or have we merely a sub-division of an unitary psychophysical organism /rom within ? And it is just here that the additional value of verbal responses and ideational mental contents areof paramount importance ; since the completely foreign nature ofthe latter alone would be likely to prove (or else strongly to suggest)a real inspiration from without—all the more so, however, if theyare found to be associated with distinctive physiological reactionsin connection with the supposed personalities.
Here we come up against the question of possible telepathy. Inso far as the different word responses might chance to arise out oftelepathy or mind-reading between the medium and an operatorsuch as Mr C. Drayton Thomas (see below), one might expect either() a general and fairly consistent (?) lengthening of reactiontimes for all trance “ communicators ” : but which mightalso be due merely to the trance state as such, and henceinvolve the “ controls ” as much as the “ communicators.”() sporadic and inconsistent variation of the individual reactiontimes of the “ communicators ” owing to variable delay in
getting the answers telepathically.
Unfortunately, I have not details of the reaction data now beforeme ; but I recollect, and some graphs for the Leonard personalities’
reaction times seem to indicate, that the responses in trance wereconsistently much slower than those of normal Leonard. Moreover,when the times coimected with individual words were discounted andsimply reaction-time distribution curves drawn for the severalpersonalities, those for all the trance personalities fell pretty muchtogether, while that of Ln (normal Leonard) was most conspicuously distmct. From this it would appear that the trance state
itself increased reaction times as a whole—trance inter-personaldistinctions being comparatively slight as compared with thedistinction of Ln already noted.
As for personal reaction times to the individual words, Mr Carington would be able to tell us how far he found them to be consistent ; but my general impression was, I recollect, that they wereextraordinarily variable and sporadic as compared with the sort ofreactions one gets from normal subjects. If that, indeed, was so, maynot the actual reaction times on any single occasion (in trance) havebeen simply an expression of the medium’s varying delay either
(ffl) in reading her sitter’s mmd, telepathically, or
(6) in receiving and comprehending the “ message ” of a real
spirit communicator ?
I43j A Further Note on Mr Carington s Investigation 525
Spiritistic Possession
To return to the problem of spirit communicators, and their
possible possession of the medium’s organism. If the body be re- garded merely as an elaborate physical instrument built by the
spirit for the achievement of certain psychic experiences and purposes, and guided by the psychic organisation that exists spiritually
and develops mentally (as a captain directs and steers his shijj),
then it seems practically inevitable that the specific qualities of
such an instrument should “ colour ” every idea or communication
expressed through it—no matter whose the personality that lay
behind it. In other words, one would expect that although the
actual thoughts expressed by a
“ communicator ” should be foreign
and patently “ inspired,” yet the physiological properties and re- actions of the medium’s body {qua physical instrument) would
remain unchanged by the state of possession. This “ local colour ”
might even extend so far as to limi t the verbal vocabulary of the
“ communicator ” to that inherent in the medium’s normal mind.
Indeed, so much one would rather expect, if the idea of the physical
instrument is correct ; just as an organist is limited in his j^laying
by the number of keys, manuals and stops on the instrument before
him. So that if it can ultimately be shown that spiritistic possession can go so far (supposing that it happens at all) as to modify the
normal physiological reactions of the medium’s body, as good as proof will have been evinced of the reality of such an invasion from
without. The present great difficulty, however, is that it is impossible to say just where the normal personality’s, or else personalities’,
faculty for modifying psychological and physiological responses ends.
If only we knew that at all certainly, we might then state where
spiritistic mvasion (if any) begins ! Add to this protean power of the
organism the ability also to receive telepathic impulses, to mindread and sense paragnostically, etc., and the complexity of the
problem is only too apparent.^ One way or another, however, Mr
Carington appears to me, personally, to be making an uncommonly
penetrating and persistent attack on that problem, for which he
merits our praise and admiration.
One last word upon the possibility of an mvading psyche not only
directing the thoughts (and speech), but also modifying, to some
extent, the normal physiological reactions of a medium’s organism.
It should not be thought that the analogy of the organist playing
upon a given instrument is altogether a fair one, for it omits the
important fact that in the human organism (as instrument) there is
1 1 am glad to see that, in liis second paper, Mr Carington admits that “ the
whole story is enormously more complicated than (he) at first imagined.”
526 J. Cecil Maby [part
a certain amount of undoubted plasticity, so far as the protoplasm
and the nervous connections are concerned. It appears to be a fact
that nervous connections can be quite readily built up and destroyed
in tbe adult organism, as well as s}maptic thresholds raised and
lowered appreciably at will. Hence our persistent ability to learn
new facts and habits, as well as to remember and forget. It would
appear, therefore, that an invading psyche might actually get more,
or even different, things out of a given bodily organism than did
the normal controlling personahty ; whereas an organist is ulti- mately limited by the special physical construction of his instrument,
which lacks such plasticity of response.
If, then, Mr Carington actually finds specific and detailed behaviourisms corresponding to each soi-disant personahty, we need
not be immeasurably surprised ; and we can at least deduce therefrom that such personalities are autonomous, whether they originate
within the medium her- or himself, or whether they represent true
spiritistic invasions from without. And if I may be allowed to
express a personal sentiment, based upon common, though notrigidly “ scientific,” observation, it is that we are ah of us subject
to occasional possession ( = invasion ?) by spiritistic impulses {N.B.
I do not venture to say complex personalities) of a kind apparently
distinct from the mere emergence of a dissociated, or subconscious,
part of our o-rni personalities. Such possessions, if real, mayrepresent either
(a) the release of certain physiological genetic elements in ourcomplete organic make-up, or possibly
{b) a true spiritistic impulse received from without our ownphysical organism, from another personality, whether alive or “ dead,” and permitted to play its own melodies uponthe instrument of our body.^
In their simpler and more generally recognised form, the latter
constitute what we term telepathic impulses, in which the percipientappears sometimes to play a passive role, but at others (conjointlyvdth the agent) an active one. In their fuller and less generally admitted form, such psychicinvasions are exemphfied by the feeling that many of us sometimeshave of the spirit of another (near relation, such as a deceasedfather, or a powerful friend), working through us pro tern. While,in their completest form, we see such apparent invasions in thephenomena of the trance medium or the somnambulist.

143] ^4 F^irfher Note on Mr Carington's Investigation 527
Experimental Procedure
As we have seen, Mr Carington originally stated that he was
chiefly interested to demonstrate a statistical method ; which he
appears very ably to have done. Nor have I ventured to question
the validity of that method or of his actual calculations and deductions. In my Note {vide supra) I did venture, however, to raise
certain questions regardmg the method of collection and intrinsic
reliability of the actual data employed ; and that not, I must
reassure Mr Carington, with any idea of mere fault-finding or impertinence, but with an honest desire to further the interests of
such work. I cannot but think it a pity, therefore, that he took
rather less pains, in his reply, to answer my comments upon experimental procedure than to justify his calculations, which, presumably,
need no justification.
Mr Carington commences his rejoinder by admitting that his
data were more or less mireliable, and does not exactly deny that
the experimental conditions might have been improved, one way
or another. Here, then, is my first point : that it was a mistake to
have expended so great an amount of time and energy on these
lengthy tests and computations, including the risk of exhausting
three good mediums’ interest and reactive-capacity,^ without having
first experimented in extenso with the proposed technique on several
ordmary subjects. As it is, any such minor sources of confusion or
error as may have existed will have detracted from the maximal
value of the data obtamed from the main investigation itself. Again, though it would be unreasonable to expect that every
difficulty or problem should be foreseen, it would have been to
advantage to have tested IMrs Leonard in her normal (imprepared)
state between and m parallel wdth the main (trance) sittmgs, instead
of as an afterthought ; and the whole question of histrionic poses
and secondary personalities {vide the Besterman-Gatty and Salter
tests) might have been gone into as a preliminary. The important
questions of possible telepathy between medium and operator (see
below), cmmfiative mental facihtation,- on the one hand, and
psychological boredom, on the other, might have been first studied
^ Such an inference appears to follow from actual tests of many normal
and neurotic subjects, that I have made, employing the word-association test and psycho-galvanic reflex : —a subject’s spontaneous reactivity to a given
class of test progressively flags. Subjects that have become famihar with
such psycho- analytical methods also grow “ sophisticated ”. Preliminary
experiments are, therefore, better made on unimportant subjects.
“ I.e., increasing reflexivity and “ sophistication ” of the responses con- comitant with repetitive reaction, tending to reduce reaction times, lessen
p.g. reflexes, and standardise word responses.
528 ./. Cecil Maby [partin detail. The effects—which are undoubtedly important—of such
factors as change of operator, method of presenting the stimuli,
choice of suitable stimulus words, irregular time intervals betweensittings, etc. might also have been made the subject of preliminary
investigations and discussions. Finally, I believe that Mr Carington
would have benefited and saved much calculation by the use of
some other form of p.g. reflexometer apparatus [e.g. Mr G. G.
Blake’s device ') ; while I have previously pointed out the fact that
small p.g. reflexes to spoken replies often appear to be merely anindication of the degree of psycho-physical disturbance, resulting
from the mere effort of articulation, rather than of personal psychological significance, and that when no verbal response is mademany reactions fall to zero—especially with a familiar subject.
Actually, Mr Carington reassures us (and I am glad to hear it)
that “in so far as the factors mentioned are constant for a given
word, personality or occasion,” and also “ in so far as they are not
constant ”, they are duly accounted for in his calculations and/or
by the quantity that he calls OWP, representing Error.
All that I need add, therefore, is the query ; Would not the data
have been rendered more secure and valuable, and the calculations
simpler, if some of these sources of error could have been ehminated,
or reduced, by preliminary experiments and more attention to the
empirical side ? I beheve, personally, that they would. Possibly,
however, Mr Carington made such preliminary experiments as are usual m such a case, but did not happen to refer to them in his
papers.
Injluence of the Sitter—Telepathy
In answer to my suggestion that telepathy between subject andoperator ’ was not only possible, but highly probable under such
circumstances, Mr Carington affects not to understand quite whatI mean.
I mean, of course, that thought transference in the broad sense waspossible, no matter whether the operator might be termed an active
agent or merely a jMSsive source of information. These two processes,
namely, active telepathy by some sort of energetic emission of
thought from agent to a passive (?) percipient, and telaesthesic
1 Vide G. G. Blake, M.I.E.E., in Journ. Roy. Soc. Arts. Vol. Ixxx., No. 4126,
pp. 128-153.
- Vide also pp. 351-2 of Mr Carington’s second paper, loc. cit., in which he
beheves that he has refuted telepathy ; though he is careful to add : “ But
ardent spiritists should note that any construing of this remark (see actual
text) into the sense of ‘ telepathy hypothesis disproved,’ or the like, would
constitute a gross and unwarrantable perversion of what I have said.” Exactly
what, then, are we to believe of Mr Carington ?
143] ^-1 Further Note on Mr Carington's Investigation 529
mind-reading of a passive (?) agent by an active percipient, are commonly included by the term Telepathy. The distinction, however, has often been intimated, and the Earl of Balfour recently
discussed the matter in his important paper {Proc. S.P.R. Vol. xliii.) on Mrs Willett’s mediumship ; so that I can scarcely believe that
Mr Carington should have failed to appreciate my meaning.
For example, take the case of Mrs Leonard, with Mr Drayton
Thomas as operator.
Am I not right in supposing :
() that Mrs Leonard, in trance, is perfectly capable of reading
her sitter’s mind (especially one so familiar as C.D.T.’s)
almost like a book ? Certainly, she thus read my mother’s
a complete stranger’s.
() that all the words and ideas actually given in response by
Mrs Leonard’s communicators, “ John ” and “ Etta,” were
familiar to Mr C. Drayton Thomas himself—no matter
whether they happened to be supraliminal or subliminal
at the time of the tests ?
(c) that the replies of “ John ” and “ Etta ” (in so far as they were specific, and did not show confusion with ideas in the
medium’s own mind, or that of her control, “ Feda ”) might
be supposed to be fairly well segregated in C.D.T.’s own
mind as memories relating to his father and his sister
respectively ? Add to this the facts that the operator himself called out the
stimulus words, and cannot but have entertained appropriate answers (whether supraliminally or subliminally is not the point),
and it will be apparent for all to see that mind-reading and/or
active telepathy from person to person were practically inevitable.^
Even though Mr Drayton Thomas was tested separately with the
same word list, and found to give foreconscious rephes in non- agreement with those by “ John ” and “ Etta,” - it is no proof
that the medium did not read the subliminal ® part of the operator’s
Whether such telepathic action should have at all influenced the reaction
times and p.g. reflexes, as apart from the response words, is another matter
upon which it would be interesting to hear Mr Carington’s opinion. But if
so, one would be all the more surprised, since it is scarcely to be expected that a telepathic percipient or active mind reader should borrow another’s physiological, as well as his mental reactions and dispositions.
^ Vide pp. 349-352 of Mr Carington’s second paper, loc. cit.
® General evidence appears to point to the abihty of metagnomic subjects
to read the subhminal as well as, or better than, the supraliminal mind of a
sitter—or even that of a person distant in space or time. {E.g. see Osty’s
‘ Supernormal Faculties in Man.”)
530 J. Cecil Mabry [part
mind. In any case, Mrs Leonard is, I understand, so familiar with
Mr Drayton Thomas as a sitter, and hence also {ex hyjrothesi) with
the “ John ” and “ Etta ” components of his mind, that the appropriate answers would be ready prepared, even when some other
operator such as Mr Irving took his place.^ And if anyone should
doubt the possibility, nay probabihty, of such mental interaction,
then I can only suggest that he must either be ignorant of, or have
purposely blinded himself to, the facts of Psychic Science.
The case of “ Feda ” is simpler, and has already been discussed
by Mr Carington. For “ Feda ”, hke Mrs Garrett’s “ Uvani ”, maynot irrationally be supposed ^ to constitute a secondary personality
of the medium’s own mind ; and one would not be at all surprised
to find that the mental content of such a more or less dissociated
personality was fairly discrete from that of the primary personality.
Concomitantly, however, some degree of similarity and overlapping
might be observed ; and that Mr Carington actually found, I gather,
in the cases of both “ Feda ” and “ Uvani ”, as well as in the interesting and important experiment with Mrs Salter upon her normal
and “ automatic ” selves.
But in the last instance, one should remember that, on the hypothesis which supposes a certain amount of real spiritistic inspiration
overlaid and somewhat confused by the automatist’s own mental
content,^ both significant similarity and significant difference would
be exjDected to be found between the normal and automatic reactions.^
Mr Carington here suggests a resemblance to the two Gatty poses,®
which, elsewhere, he refers to as “ generalised, non-fraudulent poses, or changes in mental orientation ”. Of course, the question arises as to whether any conscious pose is not fraudulent in such psychoanalytical tests. Let that pass, however. The more important
point is, I think, as follows. Might it not easily appear from quantitative analyses that the sort of relationship existing between two
histrionic poses, say, of a smgle individual was similar to that
between another individual’s primary and secondary personalities, or even that between a medium’s normal personality and a veritable
spirit communicator, whose reactions had been somewhat confused
and overlaid by the medium’s own personality. Yet, au fond,
might not all these really represent absolutely different and unrelated cases, bearing only a numerical resemblance to one another ?

143 ] A Further Note on Air Carington's Investigation 531
I only suggest this as a possibility, and perhaps Mr Carington will
be able to tell us whether he thinks his quantitative methods would
or would not be able to distinguish reliably between three such
cases. If not, it would obviously be dangerous and misleading to
hint at resemblances between the Gatty and Salter pairs of
personalities.
The Verbal Responses
Finally, I suggested in my previous Note that Mr Carington might
have benefited from being personally present at the tests. He
rephes to this :

“ I do not agree. The experiments are behaviouristic, not psychoanalytical,^ and one of their chief aims has been to secure objectivity
by eliminating personal judgements.” Well and good. So much I appreciate ; nor need I trouble to answer the insinuations contained
in the second paragraph of Mr Carington’s reply, since these are patently unjustified by my suggestion. Given Mr Carington’s ex- planation {supra), all that I now wish to add is that, granted such
good opportunities, it seems a pity to have missed making the investigation psycho-analytical as well as behaviouristic ; though I appreciate that that would have been over-much for a single investigator,
and would have necessitated a separate treatment from the quantitative analyses.
Word analyses of the kind here in question would undoubtedly
be coloured by the subjective attitude, experience and intuition of
the individual analyst ; but, given some detailed experience of word
association tests and of the reactions of a number of average minds
of various types and grades, it should not be difficult for an impartial
third-party analyst to glean further interesting information from a
careful study of the actual word responses of the various personalities. Mr Drayton Thomas has, in fact, already given us an interesting summary of the words from the Leonard sittings, together
with his personal interpretation of them. But when Mr Drayton
Thomas very kindly lent me the word response sheets for two or three weeks, I fomid that it was possible yet further to analyse the
responses upon a number of lines apparently additional to those
already followed by Mr Carington and himself ; resulting in further
simple numerical comparisons between the various personalities.
Since this was merely a private pioneer and subsidiary experiment on my part, the results of this analysis have not been published, but
some of them were, I think, sufficiently in agreement with Messrs.
Carington’s and Drayton Thomas’s own findings to intimate that
' Mr Carington here seems to use the term psycho-analytical in a curiously
limited and special sense.
532 J. Cecil Maby [part 143]
the method employed was at least worth further consideratioh.
A good deal of personal “ intuition ” (really crystallised subjective
experience of word association tests, etc.) certainly enters into the
process, and I fully admit the soundness of Mr Carington’s sentiment,
that such analyses are necessarily less conclusive and objective than
numerico-statistical estimates. At the same time, it is evident that
they can be made, and that they may 'lend additional support to
deductions drawn from quantitative analyses of the physiological
data. The results of such verbal analyses may be expressed in
simple numerical form. They are also complementary to analyses
such as Mr Carington has himself carried out so successfully, in that
they deal with the words and ideas themselves, which his physiological data can scarcely be said to do.
To conclude then, may I sum up the gist of this argument as
follows ? In everyday affairs we usually rely as much upon the
personal judgment and expert opinions of individuals of experience
and acumen (in any given field) as we do upon the impressive figures,
percentages, probabilities, etc. provided by statistical science. All
I wish to suggest, therefore, is that we should continue to do likewise in Psychology and Psychical Research, wherein, as in Art,
Religion and Philosophy, all cannot be determined by the balance,
the foot-ride and the pendulum. Qualities are quite as important
as, and sometimes more important than, quantities. Thus
momentarily taking leave of physical science, but not of psychology —one may remark that had the ancient Greeks valued statistics as highly as they valued patriotism and military discipline, the Persian
host would never have been so valiantly opposed at Thermopylaeand ultimately routed at Marathon.
I leave Mr Carmgton to disport himself at showing the ineptness
of this analogy. There may, however, be others who will appreciate
the broad idea that lies behind it. Throughout this Note my aim has been to discuss matters in a
general and, I hope, constructive way, rather than to insinuate
various vague criticisms. But should Mr Carington decide—as I expect he may do—that I have still “ failed to indicate a single
numerical result with which (I) disagree,” then there can remain
very little for us to quarrel over ! At the same time, I shall have hadthe opportunity to remark upon one or two principles which appear
to be connected with the general conduct and subsequent evaluation
of an exceptionally important investigation, and one that I, personally, have found highly interesting and stimulating.

SOME COMMENTS
ON MR MARY’S “ FURTHER NOTE ”
By Whately Carington
It is now clear to me that my reply to Mr Maby’s first Note was
based on an extensive misunderstanding of his mtentions—a circumstance which I trust may be held to extenuate any undue acerbity
in my remarks.
I know that Mr Maby will not take it amiss if I refrain from dealmg
with all the points of interest which he raises, but confine myself to a few of the more specific and important. I should like first, however,
to make it clear in the most general way possible that I have no
desire to claim that the quantitative methods I have introduced are the only methods, or even the most fruitful, that can be applied in
psychical research. They are, I believe, capable of yielding results
not otherwise obtainable, and perhaps of giving us a degree of assurance on certain points to which the qualitative approach cannot
lead ; as such they are likely to prove indispensable, but they must
always be supplemented by, and themselves at best be complementary to, less specialised studies. Generally speaking, we must
rely on these latter to tell us what to look for, and on the quantitative methods to tell us whether it is there.
The following comments occur to me in reply to particular points
raised in Mr Maby’s Note.
1. I am afraid I cannot agree with the suggested artificiality of
numerical analysis. It is true that, for the most part, we think m
words rather than in numbers ; similarly we also eat bread and
butter rather than economic statistics, are the figures of agricultural
production therefore to be stigmatised as “ artificial ” 1
2. I fail to see that my methods in any way assume “ complete
bodily and mental possession ”. They are, primarily, means of
obtaining comparative data regarding the reactions of mediums in
their various conditions of trance and otherwise, but these data re- quire interpretation in the light of our knowledge at any given
moment ; e.g., when I started, I supposed that significantly different
sets of reactions could not be produced by a single personality, but
the Besterman-Gatty exqDeriment showed that this is not so. It may
be that future work will yield results which will demand something
in the nature of a “ possessive ” explanation, but the theory must
follow the facts. The only way, it seems to me, in which the method
may fairly be said to “ assume ” possession is that it does seem

capable, in principle, of producing data which might virtually force
such an explanation upon us.
3. I agree that there is a tendency for all trance reaction times to
be slower than the normal, but it seems to me scarcely practicable
to decide whether this is due to a process of communication, to
telepathic delays, or to “ the trance state as such The question
of identity is all important, and I think that if ever we were to
obtain from a communicator a set of reactions significantly different
from those of the medium and significantly similar to those obtained
from that communicator ante mortem (themselves also differing
from the medium) it would be difficult to support Mr Maby’s contention that the method “ cannot, in the nature of things, give us a
definite answer to the question ; Are these cases of spirit invasion
. . . from without, or ... a sub-division . . . from within ? ”
4. As regards the consistency of differences between reaction
times for different words : This is covered by the quantity I have
called “ I ” (RN 1-18, 42-70, 135-153). Reference to these results
will show that the consistency is significantly large compared with
the error present, in nearly all cases. Prepared Leonard is the most
important exception.
5. Experimental Procedure : (a) Reliability is never absolute,
though in buying pounds of butter we do not usually worry about the
probable error of the weighings. Where error is liable to be serious, as here, we can do no more than use the best methods we know,
estimate how great the error is, and compute the chance of the
observed results being due to it. This I have done.
(b) In 1920 and thereabouts I observed a matter of some 10,000
reactions with nearly a hundred different (normal) subjects using
the same technique as in this work. The results (cf. my Measurement of Emotion) seemed to me to justify the belief that the procedure was good enough for all practical purposes, although, of
course, one can always go on refining any method—and methods for
testing the refinement of the method—indefinitely. I do not think
I can, in these circumstances, fairly be accused of neglecting the
preliminary testing of my tools.
6. Exhaustion of mediums : If a subject were to become ex- hausted by re]3eated tests, the result could only be, I think, that
all words would sink to a common dead level of uninterestingness,
so that the differences between them would no longer be significant
compared with the day to day errors involved. This would be
refiected in the quantity “ I ”. But the relevant figures for the
Irving sittings show more significant values here than for the earlier
Thomas experiment. It is true that somewhat different words were
used, and that the improvement is probably due to the smaller
143] Some Comments on Mr Maby's “ Further Note ” 535
intervals between sittings ; but “ exhaustion ” is certainly contraindicated.
7. Telepathy : I naturally cannot deny that telepathy in a broad
sense was taking place, though I have no reason to suppose that it was, and I should certainly challenge at least the first of Mr Maby’s
suppositions. I am not sure whether telepathy ever takes place at
aU ; if it does, and if in these cases it has done so very freely (so that
Mrs Leonard may be regarded as sharing, as it were, in the mental
content of Mr Thomas and Mr Irving), surely we would expect that
she would feel the effect, so to speak, of the ideas which determine
the lengths of their reaction times and produce somewhat similar
results ; which she does not. If she did, it would constitute positive
and very remarkable evidence of telepathic intercourse ; her failure
to do so does not prove that nothing of the kind took place, but it does seem to me to render very much more difficult the task of those
who seek to attribute the effects observed to telepathic action.
According to IVIr Maby, as I understand him, we must suppose that
Mr Thomas and Mr Irving have something in the nature of secondary
personahties of their own tucked away in their minds (“ segregated ”)
and that these supply Mrs Leonard telepathically not only with
responses but with hesitations and failures in reproduction other
than those characterising the main personalities. I do not say it is impossible, but it does seem rather far-fetched, and quite mmecessary.
8. If it “ appears ” from quantitative analysis that the three cases mentioned by Mr Maby are identical, then evidently the method in
question is incapable of distinguishing between them, and if we have
independent reason for beheving them to be distinct this will be
to the discredit of the method concerned. But perhaps I have misunderstood the point. If it be asked whether I think that quantitative methods of some kind would be capable of making the distinction required, then surely the answer is that, if they cannot, the
distinction is without validity. A quantitative element of some kind
must, I think, enter mto any method capable of yielding valid
results, if only to the extent of telhng us the likelihood of the
differences between our various observations being due to chance.
But if it be asked whether the particular methods I have hitherto
employed will be capable of doing this, I can only say that I cannot
tell at the present stage ; broadly speaking, I should expect them
to do so, provided we include such extensions as those used in
sections 29 to 32 of Q.S.T.P. II. Elaboration is likely to be necessary,
if only because an experiment which can only yield one of two an- swers {e.g., “ same ” or “ different ”) cannot distinguish between
three or more possibihties.
9. Verbal responses : The fact that I have hitherto published
2n
536 Whately Carington [part 143]
nothing much about these should not be taken as indicating that I underestimate their importance. Actually I have spent scores of
hours work on them, but have repeatedly been driven back by myinability to find a system of classification which satisfies me on the
two counts of being both unambiguous and informative. I have
been trying to penetrate to the kind of way in which the mind re- sponsible for the reactions works—the relational thought-structure, as it were, underlying them ; if I could do this, I feel I noight be
able to determine whether the responses of Leonard and John, say, were produced by the same type of mind, and that this would be
important ; but it is very difficult. One or two points of interest have emerged, of which the most
remarkable perhaps is the very strong tendency of Normal Leonard
to react with words evidently determined by stock phrases, chches,
and compound words. This suggests to me the raising of a kind
of shield or barrier from which the stimuli glance off without penetrating at all deeply, and behind which the true psychic life goes on
undisturbed. Feda, again, seems noteworthy for the sharpness of
her imagery—a kind of pictorial attitude, so to speak ; one can
almost, to put it colloquially, see her visualising the scene which the
word suggests.
It seems possible that further work on these lines, if I can hit on
the right plan for conducting it, may throw much light on the
essential nature of the personalities concerned ; but the requisite
inspiration is hard to come by.
In conclusion : Mr Maby is undoubtedly right in insisting on the
value of other-than-quantitative methods ; certainly we need all the weapons in our armoury to deal with the problems before us, and I am only too delighted that he, or others, should bring every
device that ingenuity can suggest or virtuosity command to bear on the interpretation of the facts I have obtained. But as regards
these facts themselves, and the methods used to gain them, I do
not think there is much room for doubt. It is perfectly true, of
course, that if I were to plan the whole experiment over again I might do slightly better as a result of past experience ; but I do not
think that the results would be appreciably different, except perhaps
for being of the same kind but rather more emphatic. At the sametime I cannot fail to appreciate the great amount of trouble taken
by Mr Maby in elaborating the various points which he has raised, even though I am not at all persuaded that any conclusion I have
reached is adversely affected by them.
ON “ THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF TRANCE
PERSONALITIES ”
By Hereward Carrington
The two contributions by Mr Wbately Carington, dealing with this
subject, are doubtless of first-rate importance. His doctrine of “ countersinularity ” between medium and control is psychologically
valuable—though clearly predicted by Professor Flournoy,^ and to
some extent by Mr Whately Carington himself in his original paper
upon the subject {Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxi., pp. 401-16). His
findings would seem to indicate that his original theory was to some
extent erroneous, and that (partly in consequence of this) our own
findings were erroneous also—as set forth in Bulletin I. of the A.P.I.
It is in this connection that I venture a few words of comment upon
Mr Whately Carington’s conclusions.
While it is now contended that the regular Controls (Feda, Uvani,
etc.) are probably subconscious personifications, it is freely admitted
that other alleged Communicators do not appear to be so. My own
conclusions hi this connection were surely tentative enough. I said : “ As to the ultimate nature of ‘ Uvani ’ I do not pretend to
speak. I can only say that our experiments seem to indicate . . . the mental independence of a so-called ‘ spirit control ’
. . .” etc. Elsewhere I said : “In mediumistic cases we seem to deal with
a perhaps fictitious personality which is nevertheless in touch or contact, in some mysterious way, with another (spiritual) world,
from which it derives information, and through which genuine
messages often come ” (pp. 72-73).
It can hardly be contended, therefore, that the main conclusions
of our Report have been invalidated by these newer findings : on
the contrary, they seem to have been confirmed by them. Our own
opinion was that the responses from the Communicators were far
more striking and conclusive than those from the regular Controls.
It is to be noted that Mr Carington, in his last Report, based his
conclusions almost entirely upon reaction times—leaving out of
accoimt the galvanic deflections on the one hand and the words
themselves on the other.
But does this procedure give us a fair picture of the whole case ? Take the Gatty experiment, e.g., to which Mr Carington (very
rightly) attaches great importance. Gatty (0) and Gatty (H) were
1 In his Spiritism and Psychology (Trans, by H. C.), 1911, pp. 193-94. 537
538 Hereward Carrington [part
found to differ from one another as greatly as two individuals would.
Very good. But did either Gatty (0) or Gatty (H) furnish any
definitely supernormal information ? They certainly did not. They
furnished memories and associations quite in keeping with their
own past lives. One can quite understand how a medium’s subconscious mind could concoct hypothetical reactions from some
fictitious personality (such as Mr Pickwick, for example), or even from some historic character—assuming he knew even the smatterings of history. But how could it accurately concoct and supply us
with a series of typical and personal reactions, seemingly emanating
from some person who actually existed (but whom the medium had
never seen), which were afterwards checked by members of the family
and found by them to be strikingly appropriate and eminently
characteristic ? There is the crux ! It might be contended that this material was in the sitter’s mind,
and hence obtained from it by means of telepathy. (I understand
that this is Dr Rhine’s contention.) But Mr Carington’s experiments
in this direction seem to indicate very clearly that telepathy played no part in them, and he so stated.
We may be willing to grant any amount of play-acting ability on
the part of the subconscious mind of the medium. But that does
not alter our main problem, viz.. Why are the responses invariably
typical of the right person ? Or, as the Rev. Drayton Thomas put it
:
“ ... all that we have found seems to favour the supposition that
with change of control there comes into operation a differently
composed mind and menioryC (Italics mine.)
The association words we received seemed quite characteristic
and typical of the personalities involved in life, as subsequently
verified by friends and relatives known to them when living. All
this is very different from the Gatty (H) = Gatty (0) material,
interesting as this is from the psychological point of view.
In short, as I stated in our Report
;
“ It would thus seem that the reaction words are, in a sense, a
far better indicator of the actual state of affairs than are the
galvanic reflexes [or reaction times] which were treated statistically.”
This conclusion seems to have been amply borne out by Mr
Thomas’s results, in which some highly characteristic reactions were
also obtamed, judged by the words alone.
This personal and identifying material seems to me to have been
unduly slighted by Mr Carmgton, in both his original Reports, and
also in his review of our Bulletin, as I have already indicated in the
Journal.
A final word in conclusion. Certam critics of jisychical research
are constantly contending that psychiatrists are the only persons
143] On “ The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities ” 539
capable of judging our results adequately, and that from tbeir work
alone may really frrdtful results ever be obtained.
I ask one question, in reply. Do sucb critics believe that genuinely
supernormal phenomena have ever really been obtained 1 And
do they beheve that the theoretical possibility of “ communication ”
should at least be left an open question ? If not, then there is of course no use for further discussion. But if so, then it is my opinion
that a man like, e.g., Dr Hodgson knew more about psychical and
trance phenomena than all the psychiatrists in the world—inasmrich
as their whole theory is based upon the non-existence of these supernormal phenomena. I can see no reason, therefore, to kow-tow to
their opinions in the shghtest degree, or to beheve that their esti- mates of psychic phenomena are any more valuable than those of
other men. Indeed, if genuine supernormal phenomena exist, they
are usually less so. Therefore, while it is doubtless true that both psychical researchers
and psychiatrists might benefit greatly from a mutual knowledge of
each other’s work, it is not logical to contend that either of them
is entitled to pass final judgment upon the results of the researches
in the other’s field. No one branch or science may hope to solve the problems of
psychical research—though every branch has its contributions to
make, once its exponents accept the reahty of psychic phenomena !
EEPLY TO MR HEREWARD CARRINGTON’S NOTE
By Whately Carington
There is so little that is controversial between Mr Hereward Carrington and myself that httle is called for beyond a friendly acknowledgment of his remarks.
The only major exception seems to be that whereas, in his Bulletin,
he concluded pretty definitely, albeit cautiously, that “ Uvani ” was an mdependent entity (unless I quite misunderstood the general
tenor of his remarks), I am equally confident that the personality
concerned is a countersimilar secondary. But he would almost
certainly have come to the same conclusion as I did, on the basis of
his own material (Cf. my RN 19.1), if he had been able to subject
it to the same statistical tests. On the other hand, it is not quite correct to suggest that “ while
the regular Controls (Feda, Uvani, etc.) are probably subconscious
personalities, it is freely admitted ” (by me) “ that the other alleged
Communicators do not appear to be so ”. I am by no means satisfied that John, Etta, Dora and Mr Hereward Carrmgton’s Communicators are not “ subconscious personafities ”
of some sort. What I said was that they do not appear to be countersimilar secondaries ; but I went on to remark that “ . . . Communicators, if and
in so far as they are not what they purport to be, are more in the
nature of histrionic poses than secondary personafities in the
ordinary sense of that term ” (Q.S.T.P. II., p. 342). This is reasonably non-committal, but a long way from contendiag or admittmg that the personafities concerned are not
“ subconscious
personafities ” with the implication that they are what they claim
to be.
As regards the points raised by Mr Carrington with respect to
supernormal information and the character of the response words : Broadly speaking I agree with all that he says, but the first takes
us clean outside the field in which I have been working and into that
of psychical research generally ; while the second involves diffi- culties from the point of view of quantitative treatment which I have
mentioned in my Comments on Mr Maby’s Note. But, although in
my review I drew attention to the striking nature of some of the
responses obtained by Mr and Mrs Carrington, I must confess that
in my concentration on the instrumental and quantitative aspects
of the case I was inclined to do them less than justice. I do not
think it sensible to dismiss such responses with a vague appeal to
540
[part 143 541
] Reply to Mr Hereward Carrington’’ s Note
“ telepathy ”
; for, if telepathy occurs at all, it seems to me to open
the door to the praeter-physical generally so wide that our chief concern should be not with deciding between the terms of the
antithesis “ Telepathy-Communicator ”, but with epistemological
considerations as to whether there is any real distinction between
them other than that created by our traditional habits of thought.
But in self-defence, I think I may fairly claim that, so far as my
own work is concerned, I have expressly and specifically been dealmg
with the quantitative study of trance personalities, whereas this
whole question of responses remains, so far, almost wholly in
quahtative field.
NOTE ON PROFESSOR THOULESS’S REVIEW OF
EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION
By Dr J. B. Rhine
While deeply appreciative of the attention and criticism Professor
Thouless has given my volume, I find it necessary to correct the
general impression which his review (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. xliii., p. 24)
gives as to the principal contribution of the work, and to consider a few other points of the review.
Professor Thouless states ; “ The novelty of Dr Rhine’s results
lies in his apparent demonstration that this power is not uncommon
and it is here that his evidence is quite inadequately stated.” I call especial attention to the fact that this emphasis on frequency is the
reviewer’s point of view, not that of the book reviewed. Nowhere,
I think, is this to be found m the book. Certainly its list of conclusions and suggestions are silent on the point. It is therefore
hardly to be held accountable for the failure to present detailed
descriptions essential only to such a point of view.
After reporting in detail on the first three of the eight principal
subjects, I expressly excused myself (page 88) from further repetition, and thereafter omitted description of conditions except where
new experiments were involved. The frequency question was never an outstanding one to us, and, furthermore, the report had to be
limited in length.
It was plain to me that those left unconvinced by the work of
Linzmayer, Stuart and Pearce, for which details were relatively fully
given, would not be convinced by mere repetition of similar details
of the other work. And, so far as the other subjects go, most of
them worked in special experiments, the conditions of which are given in the book, and which go considerably beyond the minima
required by Professor Thouless. For example, three of the five
remaining were successful subjects in distance telepathy tests, a
fourth in DT. Both of these conditions exceed limits laid down by
Professor Thouless. This leaves only one whose capacity for extrasensory perception may be regarded as not fully accounted for by
the report of conditions. But as stated, it was not intended that
every subject should be given an independent case. We were working for bigger stakes than frequency of distribution of E.S.P. ability.
Our objective was to try to explain it as far as possible.
In the judgment of most critics the “ novelty ” of the Duke work
lies in its experimental separation for the first time of telepathy and
542
[part 143] Note on Professor Thoiiless’s Review 543
clairvoyance, and of their independent demonstration. It is much
more novel than the number of subjects foimd. Estabrooks and
Coover both used college students for subjects as was done at Duke,
and in both these cases too the positive deviations were contributed
by many individuals. The only novel feature m the Duke work in
relation to the number of subjects was the fact that the better
scoring subjects were followed up further.
Professor Thouless rejects one of the most important points of the
book because he uses, I think, an inadequate method for evaluating
the significance of the results. I refer here to the remarkable fact
that all our eight major subjects showed both clairvoyant and
telepathic ability, and reached under comparable conditions approximately similar score-levels. These facts along with others
presented in the book suggest strongly that there is some basic
relation between the two phenomena. This would be a most
important relation if true. I had not regarded the case as doubtful
enough to require statistical support, but Professor Thouless apparently does. First he unfortunately overlooked a footnote (page 148)
entered to show that the eighth subject at last showed both abilities. Second, the method he uses is not capable of efficient evaluation of
the probability of the coincidences.
If a mathematical basis is needed for judgment of this relationship
the treatment should be applied to all the facts available. First,
what is the probability that, assuming no known relationship between telepathy and clairvoyance, eight ^ principal subjects found
possessing the one capacity will all have measurable capacity for the
other as well ? To compute this it is necessary to estimate how rare good subjects really are, a very difficult matter. If one takes the
highest possible estimate yet made of such frequency, reflected from
our own experimental study, he might approach the figure that one
in every two persons is telepathic or clairvoyant. Surely, no one will
insist on a greater frequency. But even with one half as the probability estimate, the eight cases give odds of 255 to 1 , against a chance
theory of the coincidence of telepathic and clairvoyant capacities
being found in the same individuals. This is itself a significant
relationship. If now a more conservative estimate of the frequency of
good subjects is taken, the signiflcance soars into huge figures at once.
If we wish to concern ourselves fmther with the closeness for
each subject of the averages for the two test conditions, the fact
that in five out of the eight subjects the average scores per rmi for
both telepathy and clairvoyance fell upon the same unit, and in
only two cases was there more than a unit’s difference, offers further
^ The facts in the eighth case arrived late and were inserted as footnotes,
pp. 92 and 148. (In the Enghsh Edition, Faber and Faber, pp. 124 and 202.)
544 Dr J. B. Rhine [part 143]
support to the finding stated above. If the differences between the
averages for P.C. and P.T. are treated by finding the ratios of the
differences to the standard error of the difference of the average
deviations from the theoretical mean, the result is that six of the
eight show insignificant differences, and the totals for the eight
subjects make another, or seven in nine examples. It is also noteworthy that the two cases in which the differences are significant
belong to the three examples in which the data for both P.C. and
P.T. could not be limited to the same period.
Finally, it should be added that, for the two subjects in which
comparable daily fluctuations were available, in all but four in
fourteen fluctuations the scores rose and fell in both the P.C. and
P.T. together.
In the chapter devoted to this comparison other evidences are given which support the view that there is close fundamental
relationship between P.C. and P.T., such as similar effects with
certain drugs taken by the subjects, with distance intervening
between percipient and the perceived, and others.
Perhaps it may be pardonable to re-state here what the objectives
of the Duke work actually are. The chief aim is, beyond the
separating out and clarifying of the basic phenomena of extrasensory perception, to find out their relations to each other, to the
rest of the mental, organic, and physical universe. As such it is a
part of a broad scheme (too broad for an individual, of course) to
find the boundaries and the powers of human personality as a natural
system, for what they may be worth to human life. In the book here discussed, it was myhope not so much to estabhsh
its points with absolute finahty, by one stroke, in so difiicult a field,
but to effect some approaches which may warrant the help of others
in the independent repetition which must precede wide acceptance.
If these reports can but stimulate repetition with a moderately sympathetic attitude I shall be content. I have to thank Mr Tyrrell
for so ably helping toward that end with his ingenious technique.
I take this opportunity to endorse heartily Mr Tyrrell’s view of
the importance of “ atmosphere ”. Favourable mental attitude is essential to success in many delicate human activities ; precautions,
of course, are essential to safe conclusions. With patience they can
be brought into mutual harmony. But not all of us have the
patience and others of us have personahties which through suggestion create unfavourable mental states in their subjects. Such
inhibiting effects are not hmited to the parapsychical field but are matters of common observation.
For the review as a whole and the excellent analysis of Coover’s
work I am much indebted to Professor Thouless and the Proceedings.
PKOFESSOR CUMMINS’S “ NOTES ON ‘ WALTER ’ THUMBPRINTS ”
Some confusion appears to have arisen among persons not familiar
with the technique of finger-print investigation by the use by
Professor Harold Cummins, the author of “ Notes on ‘ Walter ’ Thumbprints of the ‘ Margery ’ Seances ” in Part 139 of our Proceedings, of the term “ rod core ” as apphed to the negative wax
impressions inspected by him on his visit to England in August 1934.
It appears to have been thought that, as a negative impression
reproduces the features of the original in reverse, converting ridges
into furrows and vice versa, a negative described as having a rod
core must derive from an original having the opposite type of core known as a “ staple core To dispel this confusion Professor Cummins has contributed a supplementary note explaining in detail the way in which negative
impressions are described by experts ; this note is preserved at the
Society’s Rooms. The gist of Professor Cummins’s note may be
briefly summarised in his own words, as follows : “ Finger-print science follows the practice of describing pattern
details in terms of ridges of the actual skin (registered by furrows in
the plastic negative)”, and again, “ Recognised practice consistently
describes core structures (and all other minutiae as well, such as endings, forks, inclosures, islands) in terms of the actual skin,
irrespective of the type of impression mider examination. ... I say
again that the ‘ Walter ’ prints in question have rod cores, and that
in this feature as well as other jDattern details they are identical with
the ‘ Kerwin ’ (Dr ‘ X ’) right thumb.”

REVIEW
J. C. Flugel, a Hundred Years of Psychology. London : Duckworth,1933, pp. 384. 15s. net. Knowledge of any science is incomplete unless the story of its origin and development is also known. At the present day, wheninterest in psychology is so widespread, a book such as Professor
Flugel has here given us should be welcomed by all who desire to
know what the problems of psychology are and how they have beendealt with in the past and in our own times. The origins of the
science of psychology are to be found further back than a himdredyears ago, and Dr Flugel approaches his task by describing briefly
the kind of knowledge of the mind that might have been attained bya student at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Havingindicated the state of psychology in 1833, he goes on to describe its development up to 1933 when this book was first published, and in
doing so he gives an admirable account of the influences that havebeen at work in the formation and growth of the various schools
of psychological thought which exist at the present time.
Among these influences are to be found the physiological re- searches concerning the relations of mind and body, the attempts
to correlate mental and nervous functioning from the days of the
phrenologists up to the most recent work on cerebral localisation,
the physiological psychology of sensation and the sense organs, and
the data derived from the study of abnormal mental states. In the course of this exposition more or less detailed reference is made to some of the topics which have been investigated by our
Society, such as hypnotism and the psychology of subliminal states,
but only once is there any mention of Psychical Research. In his
description of the part played by Phrenology in directing men’s
minds to a search for some specific form of psycho-physical correlation Dr Flugel says that in the first half of the nineteenth century
“ phrenology w’-as, as some of the historians of psychology have well
suggested, somewhat in the position of psychical research to-day.
Its claims seemed, on general scientific grounds, unlikely to be true,
but had aroused great popular interest and belief and had not as yet
546
[PAET 143] Review 547
been confronted with any evidence that could be said to amount to
definite disproof. It was, moreover, frowned on by the principal
authorities, both in psychology and physiology, and therefore never became in any sense one of the recognized teachings of academic
science.”
Although it is admitted that “ phrenology has been psychology’s
great faux fas ”, yet a chapter is devoted to an account of its doctrines, because they undoubtedly influenced indirectly the development of psychological investigation. It may be a want of foresight on the part of Dr Flugel that he does not recognize the possible
influence of psychical research on the future of psychology, but there seems no reason for his neglect of the part it has already played in
the investigation of certain unusual phenomena of the human muid.
But criticism of Dr Flugel’s sins of omission is forestalled by his
disarming admission in the opening words of his preface : “ Such a book as this is almost inevitably bad ; in the sense at least that
what the reader will find will not correspond to what he hopes for or expects.” On the contrary Dr Flugel may rest assured that his
readers, whether they find what they expect or not, far from considering it a bad book, cannot fail to recognize how good it is. To
the student it will prove an invaluable guide to the many “ schools
”
that exist at the present time, and he will share Dr Flugel’s hope
that some day “ there may come into being one ‘ psychology ’ with
many methods, in place of the several ‘ psychologies ’ that exist
to-day.”
