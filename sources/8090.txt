  		              		Experience Description   

    I was at my grandma's house watching TV and then, the next thing I know, I was back home in Virginia but with relatives who had passed away and with some who were still alive. I didn't see a bright light or a   tunnel. I felt  nothing but just an amazing love. I've slowly lost some details over time, but I also saw some weird-looking men who were not human and they were watching us.

I woke up in the hospital and was told my heart stopped and I had died for over 4 minutes. Yet to me, my time out of my body  seemed like forever.
