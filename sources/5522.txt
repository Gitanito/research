'ruE mind naturally revolts at the idea of what
j,; strange or unaccountaLJle. Although nothing
else is capaule of stretching our credulity so far as
a wontler, to which we have yiclcled our assent; it
b perhaps equally true that nothing else is mo1e
likely to pro\'oke our intolereuce before the assent
Jws been extol'1c(t bye' iuence. Persons who had
lle\ c1 11c:.11 J of dreams that were attendeo with re-
gular aud connecteu discourse, were at first dispo-
'ed to look upon the nightly exercises of 1\liss
n..HJ HEL B~~KEH., as a grievous and abominable
jruposturc. .Accoruil1gly, when she was brought
to New-York, ~orne lreatell her name wi£h derision,
. orne '\ith coulcrupt, and others with a severity
~hat wouhl per ccu{c. Thi-; was to he expected.
'l'hal an iguorant girl of 19 years of age, should
dream in a course of enlightened theology, and
should at tlJe same time express her thoughts in
fciTiti and eloq· ~cnt Jnng:uagc, "ilh a clearness, an
.4\. 2
6
order, aud a force, far he} ontl any at!aimncnt of
ller waking cfforb; that she ~hould do 1hiSi, too,
in the form of an exhortation to an assembled audi-
ence, preceded and conclutlcJ by' a kind of miui-
sterial prayer; such an occurrence ·was too much
out of the common track of experience to ue readily
acknowledged.
The progress of things, howeYer, soon produced
a change of public opinion in her favour. People
were allowed to witness and to examine the occa·
sion of their uncharitable sentiments, anu tJ1e con-
sequence was a re-versal, almost without exception.,
of their preYious convictions.
Indeed, the unanimity of public opinion, has
now become an argument of no small weight, in
C()nfirmation of various other proofs, to show that
this you11g lady's misfortune is t·eaJ, and beyond
l1er controul. Hypoct·isy is unequal to a part like
l1ers. It is true that insencerity, in mere cold
reasoning, is not always easily discovered. Any
ingenius intellect may p~actise it without much
tlanger of detection. But the discernment of the
heart is keen and quick; it is a kind of sense; it
}lerceives and distinguishes with the certainty and
promptitude of ins1inct; it cannot long be deceiYed
or eluded in regard to a question depending upon
evidences with which it is familiar. 1\'loral eYiuen~
ces are not succesiifully couuterfeited, without a
combination of more flrt, aud Jnore knavery, than
7
) outh, to say fl1e leas1, is geuerally hei1· to. lie
who attempts io practise imposition here, has to
contend, uot only with the umlerl:ltauding, but also
wi1h the common sent:;e and feeling of mankind. ,
Perhap~ there never was a theaLJical actor, who
did not in e~·ery scene gf his performance, offend
mol'e Ol' less against the nice and subtle rules to
which nature conforms, and which they who would
personify her must accurately fulfil. Ingenuous sen-
timent~, in par1 icular, ha" e their apprO}Hiate ex-
pre~:sion, iu form~ to which chicane and fraud can
Jay no lwpeful claim. When therefore, those who
arc present at a moral exl1ibition addressed entirel.r
to their better feelings, instead of being repelled
and tli,gusted by any awkwat·d signs of hypocrisy.
are in:o,Cll='ihly t·ifleu of su~picions which 1hey had
fm1tlly cherishcu, and are silently led ovet· from an
in,·oluntary transition from doubt to belief, and
from repugnance to sympathy and approbation ; a
strong prouabHity arises that truth is gained by
the re' oJution thus effected. But it would seem
that with persons acquainted with the story of i\1iss
RACHEL BAKER, she c.an need no laboured de-
fenec. The character aml circumstance::; of her
fa:nily, the uniform ~implicity and integrity of her
life, and 1he unquestionable piety which has dis-
tin_!:ruished its progress for seYeral years past; all
coiJ~pire to fix the most fayourable and friendly
;mpressions upvn the wind of the olJserver. So
~tt·iking is the e'·idcnce on this head, that the SUJ,..
position of her having been guiHy of four year..'
habitual and painful in1posture, without. reward~
and without imaginable object, is more violent, and
involves greater mystery, than that which leave~
her reputation unimpeached ; besides, it happens
that her case is not singular. There are upon re-
cord scyeral others of a similar nature, and which.,
if they can be ex_t)lained at all, must doubtless be
accounted for upon the same general principle.
Some of them have been collected, and are now
presented in conuexion, to the world, in the l1ope
of facilitating the investigation of a satisfactory the-
ory on the subject. It is therefore considered as
at length definitiYely settled, that the human n1ind
is capable of regular and systematic operations in
time of sleep, or at least, i1i some intermediate
state between sleeping and waking. It will be
seen in an ingenious clissertation, which the ed.itor
l1as the satisfaction of presenting from the pen of
the learned Doctor 1\litchill, that he classes such
exercises unuer the general name of Somnium, or
Dreaming.
If others have a better name to propose. the
field is open. The phenon1ena certainly admits of
his classification, and it does not at present appear
wl1at substantial oLjection can lie against it, There
is a deE:cription of persons in the comrpunity, who,
jn the supc:·stition of their credulity, have imagined
that 1\lis~ Raker's discourses are dictated by au
e~ traunlinary agency of the Divine Spirit. 'rhis
conjecture is perfectly gratuitous; the case does;
not require it, and ahe herself explicitly discards
H. The end of celestial revelations is long past,
and it is equally weak ami presumptuous to talk of
thei1· renewal in our day.
Nor is their any need of convertiug the wonder
into a miracle, in order to explain it; a little in-
qujry into the n'llure and principle of dreaming,
will reward the pains of him lvho wiJI submit to
take them, with a much more credible solution of
the pl'oblem. Of sleep, inueed, we know almost
notl1ing but the fact; it seems to be an incident ra.;.
tber of our animal, than of our mental Jleing; it is
also probably capable of a great variety of degrees,
to which we may suppose the activity of the soul
to bear some intimate relation and proportion: at
any rate, this we know, that notwithstanding the
soporific influences which prevail over the body,
the mind acts powerfully in dreams, and not un-
frequently puts the sleeping body itself in motion,
and produces speaking, walkiug, running, and
sometimes a long cour~e of perfectly rational con-
duct. \Vhat then, is so uistinguishingly wonderful
in the case of RaeheI, 11tat it should not be classed
wi1h these phenomena? Is it a thing for miraculous
con~truction, that among a multitude of rational
aml systematic dreamers, there happens to be one
who finds 21. subject of discourse in the momcntouo
interests of her religion?
The only thing remaining to be supplied is a
correct theory of dreaming; this the editor pre,
tends not to furnish. It is the extent of his pre-
-tensions to give to the public, a collection of clas..
sified and authenticated facts; n1ost of which are at
once new and indubitable. Some extracts are aiso
reprinted from the works of distinguished men in
relation to the cause or causes to which such facts
are to be attributed. To determine the merits of
these extrac1s, and further to develope the inter..
esting subject of which they regard, is submitted
to the learned and the curious, who haYe more
leisure and ability for the inquiry.

DEAn Sxn,
TnE high sense I entertain of the private
and religious character of your daughter Ra-
chel, of her total unconsciousness of \Vhat
she utters in J1er eveniug exercises, and of
tbe t;a]utary influence her performances have
l1ad upon the minds of ntany young females
in this city, causes this co1umunication an<l
fCfjUCSl. rrhe Rev. David l{athhnnc, anrl
his lady, brought 1\liss l{achcl to my house,
in i his city, in Octoher, for n1e<lic.n.l aid au<l
advice. Her case hcing uc'v and extrn.or·di-
nnr.r: I thoun·ht it proper to call in council
.Ooctors 1\IitchilJ, Uirch, l\1ott, au<l llruce :
"rc \\·ere, an(lr a full iavestiga.tion of the case,
uuanin1ously of opinion, that 1ncdicinc ought
to be " 'ithheld at vresent, nud until it was
nsccrtaincd that her evening exel'cises injured
l1cr health. During her stay in this city: she
'vas visited hy many of our respectable cli-
Yines, physicians, 1ih'rary an(l rcli0ious char-
acters, both in her \Yakcful and unconsciou(;!
state; all of 'vhon1 'vcrc JlCrfcctly satisfic(l of
l1cr integrity ancl purity of thought.
1-i
ker; they 'rere of the Presbyterian pct~sn:t
sion, of good re1>ute, tltongh 11ot opulent.
She lived \vith her parents at Pelham until
she was nine years ol(]; at this age she
scarcely knew her letters, having had but one
month's school instruction. J1"'rom Pelham,
in 1803, sl1e removecl 'vitb her parents to
Marcellus, in the county of Onondaga, and
state of Nc\v.York, \Vhere she at J>resent re-
sides, 'vith them. By inforn1ation from her
parents, I ]earn that she has ha(l but six
months schooling in the place where he now·
1·esides; yet so far as parental example, fre..
quent hearing the word of God 1·eacl in the
family, anil expounded by lJublic preachers
could influence, she might be said to have
kno,vn the Holy Scriptures from a child.
She infor1ns me that in her childhood, she
frequently had strong convictions of U1c iln-
portance of eternal things; pa.rticnlarly \vhen
she '\1\'as about nine years old, the thought~
ef God and eternity 1vould make he1· tra1nble.
All 'vho ·were best acquainted with l1cr fron1
her childhood say, that she " 'as always of n.
serious make, of few 'vords, ti1norous and
much given to tnelancholy, a.n-1 to this day
she appears when a\vake, to be far fl'om pos-
16
•' I :un tllldone !·' I am a sinncr, nn(l thc
greatest on earth! I a1n going tlo,rn tu hell
1vithout a Christ. to appear for tne! I l1ave
«lenied his name; I have sinned against hin1
'vHh a high hantl and \\'ith an outstretched
arm; I cannot, dare not pray : but I 'vish
you mother, never to name to any person my
situation. Her mother endeavoured to coni-
fort her, by saying that Christ came to seek
and to save that \Vhicl1 was lost; but instead
of cotnforting ber \vith these words, it seent..
ed only to encrease l1er distress ; sbe appear-
ed to be on the 1n·iuk of despair; for a ntun-
ber of clays she took but little foo{l, and sleep
had, in a great measure departed from her.
In this same month, if my 1nemo1~y serves,
she commenced her uight talking. 'fl.te first
t.ime she talked in her sleep, was abont tlHA
~8tb N oven1her, 1811. She was then sitting
l tl het· chair; (she :tad l.~ecn observed to be
nodding) sltr began \vitb sighing anll groaning
:.ts in exct'sr--ive 11ain, \vhich caused great
alnrn1 to all thf" family. 'rhcy \Vere at first
apprehensive that she \\ras making her exit.
~\..short tilne before this. she said she had hut
a short ti1ne to live; and no\v 1ualdng usc of
sir~ila.r exl!ressious, confinned her pr\rcnts
t5
essing vcry quick perception ~, a 11enetrating
tli~eel'nment, ot· lively sensation!;; Ll1csc: and
othct· tnental faculties, in the Oj!inion of all
tho c l•cst acquainted " ·ith her, arc far fro1u
heiug bc~rond " 'hat is soinn1on to fetnales.
In June, 1811, she c.an1e to 8f·ipio on a vi-
~it, antl 'Yas }}l'esent a~ the haptbnn of a,
young laay, at onl'}>laec of 'ror~bip; tbe ad-
nlinistralion of the ordinance struck her
1nirul \viLh a. sense of setious thing"; after
'vhich she returned to Marcellus, and as she
says, strove tn quell every serious thought,
and felt determined to hi(!e her feelings frotn
every person; but bet· 1nind 'vas in1presscd
\Vith such an idea. of her sinfulness, and
'\'t·ctchcd state, that her distress \Vas almost
in npporf.aule ; this "·as too plainly (1epicted
in her counteunuce, to be kept hid. She 'vas
frequently solicited to tell the ca.use of her
•lejecliou, but she rctnainetl silent until the
first or Novcmht.~r; in the evcniof;, she \vas
~itting hy the lhe-side \Yith bel'_mother, t!1c
J' \st of the fan1ily being absent, her Inother
bcgau to question her closely respecting tl1e
state of her tuind ; she sat silent for a fe\v
1ninutcs as though site heard ber not, and
then burst into a j!ood of tears and exclaimed
1S
a fea1·ful thiug to fall a. sinner into the hantl of
the livin~ (iurl. She appeared no"· n1ot·ethan
ever, distressed for her soul ; indec(l, she
appeared to lle terrified il1to the aplltehcn-
sion that her contletnnation ,,·as scaled. De-
spair ant.l anguish seen1cd settled on evPry
feature; at the san1e thue she appearetl to
have a deeper, an(l 1uore agoujsing sense of
l1er 01Yn vileness in tl1e sight of an holy
God. The 'vhole house became very Jnnc.IJ
alarmed; this "'as a solcn1n spectacle to he-
hold; this ·was the night, she says, that she
gave herself up unreservedly into the· bands
of .A.lmigbty God and l1eard those hea1·t cotu-
forting expressions: "daughter, be of goo{]
Gheer, thy sins are forgiven thee." After
d1is slJe appeared to he restored to a cahn
unruffled serenity of soul; all 'vithin " ·as
harrnouy an(llove; and every breath, prayer,
~tnd 1naise, she expressed herself iu "'ords
like the follo\ring : "I, even I, \Vlll eve1·
llraise and bless tl1y holy n:nne, an(l will
not forget thy mercy to so ill-deserving a
creature. Thou bast set u1e as a monutncnt
of thy sparin; mercy. 0 can it be that I,
<!vcn I, should evei' taste the sY~··eets of re-

soon aftershe con1meuced talking. Shetalkct.l
then, like oue sotne,\·lutt deranged, and ap-
lleare(l to he much <listressc(l about herself

There are three states of animal existence;
JValcefulness. Sleep, an(\ TT,

In the \-Vakeful state the senses are open,
the brain excited, the w·ill predominant, an<l
all the functions going on, in as regular a
train as the constitution, health, and habit
of the individual permit. Dtn·ing sleell the
\vill is suspended, consciausness has no lH'e-
valence, the organs ofsense cease to act, and
there is a discontinuance of voluntary po\ver,
and of all exertion depending thereon. 'The
memory, ilnagination and judgment are all
prostrated and gone. These t\vo colHlitious

-,..,-ake l1er; iL gradually subsides, and she
passes into a sound a.ud natural sleep, 'vhl(·h
continues during tbe l~emainder of the night.
In the morning, or at the usual time, she
" rakes as if nothing ha<l happened ; and is

nor of allY disorder. With the exception of

nlHl as she has no consciousness of these oc-

1:eply to tl1is sort of obserYers is sitnply lhis ·
sucl1 are the ra1·e and peculia1· eircutnstances
of her case, that ntore faith is required to
suppose it a consuntma.te and practical piece
of deceit, than to eonsider it the result of de-
votional Somnium. It may at the sn1nc titne
be added, that the story of imposture is total-
ly contradicted by the correctness and pro-
priety of her conduct. She is, and ever l1as
been, as virtuous and free from reproach, as
any young 'voman in society.
It may also be remarked that, he:r lan~
guage and sentiments during the fit of Som-
nium, are eminently pure and chaste ; noth.
ing but words of the most scrupulous an(l re-
fined delicacy ever passed her lips.
It may further be sai<l, that her min(} du-
ring tbese pe1·iods, is chiefly engaged in the
doctrinal pa1·ts of Calvinistic christianity,
n.nd tlu1t sl1e. sh01''S herself not merely ortllo-
«1ox, but able anti copious in their elucida-
tion. Her discourses excel in every thing
that relates to expel'imental evidence, an(l to
the operation of divine grace upon the human
soul. To minds of a less sceptical cast, and
unaccustomed to medical observations, the
ject. On these occasions she manifests a
pa·ofound aud 1uinnte ac<1uaintancc 'vith the
ltoly scriptures, especially in matters of doe-
trine. ~he refers to the books of the old and
new testatuent " 'ith perfect ease, an(l seems
f:nniliar "'ilh tb~ir n1eaniug. 1\.fter she has
nns"'crca a question, she retut·ns to herfo1·mcr
tli~conrsc, uuless she is interruptctl by auo-
1he&·. In this \Yay she gives r~sponses to
hair a dozen interrogations in suc.ccs!-iion, up-
oH the graYest Inaitl'rs in a tnanner, that fc\v,
il' nuy, of the \Valriug beholders can equat
,.I'hough she listens for the voice of the llerson
'vho adtlre.sscs her, she does not ·wake, but
her Sotnuintn continues.
IIet· exercises have occasionally been in-
tcn·nptcd. ".rheir rt.~currence 'vas pr~vcntecl
Ly an attack of the 1neasles : during the first
year of het· nightly visitations. "\Vbile she
"~ts under the n1orbillnus action, her pai·ox-
y~nls of Son1niun1 did not return; but 'vhen
that disorder ahate<l, the devotional tendency
of her n1ind once 111ore gained the ascendan-
cy. They have like,vise been ten1porari1y
cnrctl by the occurrence of a sick head-ache,
" ·hich has tormented her abont three times a
year. ''Then she suffers a Yiolcnt aHacl{ of
Scipio. So likewise she prays ant\ preachc~
,,·hen the fit pl'esses her, though her eonvic~
tion in her seasons of wakefulness is, that
iudiYiduals of her sex, are prohibitell by apos.
tolic man(late, from acting as vublic teachers.
These variations from the fact, in l't\llltion
to her boclily con<lition, to her local situation,
and to her ministerial functions, are memor.
able fcatu1·es of the affection under whieh she
labours. While subjected to this peculiar
action, she says that she kno·ws not "PLether
sl1e is in the bo(ly or out of lhe hody; yet de-
clares she feels bigh enjoyn1ent, and bene-
volently wishes that othrrs could have the
exquisite sensations 'vhich she experiences.
Nevertheless, during her waking hours, she
laments her malady as a sore aflliction; an<\
conshlers it as a visitation upon her to punish
her sins, or to try her constancy and ,,irtue.
Her Somnium is of a peculiar character in
this respect; that on being called by nauH~
RACHEL, she in1me(liately suspenfls her dis-
course, and asks, '\\·hat do yoa 'Yant tny
1\'iend ? If thereupon, a query be put to her,
sl1e pron1ptly ans,vers it. The.se replies are
neither brief nor evasive, but cotnprehensive
aud direct, until she ha8 exhausted the sub-
41
symj)tolns exhibited have seemed to defy hu-
Jnn.n explanation, au<l to lie far beyond the
limits of the understanding. To relieve them-
selves fron1 the difficulty of interpreting the
nppcaranccR, and of irae.ing them to some
natural enuse, they refer them direetly to su-
pernatural agency; tuHl in ascribing the effu-
sious of her internal senses to the imntecliate
ins~H~dion of l)eity, they piously think they
pllilosophi~e enongh. But the rational exami-
ner 'villnot draw so bold a conclusion, until
he is satisfied that the phenomena are inex-
plicable UJlOn the l::nvs \vhich govern the ani-
1nn1 ce.onotuy. N everthcless, on this point,
persons \Yho reason ancl feel, must determine
fur thmnselves ; let every 1nau be fully per-
S~'aderl in liis ou~n udnd.

person labouring under some disease. The

operation of}lhlebotomy autl the.ba.ic tinottn·e
\Yithout success. Neither the letting of hlood,
not· the exhiliition of laudanum, produced
uny alleviation of the sympto1ns. Remedics
,vere not pushed farther. In Octoher, 18:14,
slte 'ras brought to Ne'v-Yo1~k. It 'vas
11oped that tl1e incidents of travelling lJy
land in a carriage, for a jonrnQy of three
lnuulrctl ntiles, '\\-ou1d interrupt the catenati-
on of her tl1onghts and actions. It \Vas
supposed that the noyolties of a cro,vded and
hustling city, Jnight llreak the establisl1ed as-
sociations; it 'vas e.ven conjectured that the
vicinity of the ocean, ~Yith its lnuuid antl sa-
line atrnosphere, n1ight pro<lnce an alteratioll
for the better; noue of them however an-
S\rered the purpose. 'Vhcthcr she \Yas in a

among the experienced and learned members
of the faculty.
The gentlemen found a ne\V case to en-
gage theil· consideration. 'l~hcir patient com-
tJlained of no disorder whatever; she had no
bodily iufit·mity, and \Yt\S entirely uncon-
scious of any 1nental indisposition. 'The per-
sons around her said she prayed aloucl after
she went to bed, and gave excellent advice
to nll \Vho l1eard her; they affirmed this \Vas
done in the solitude of a country d\velling,
as }lUnctun.lly ns in the centre of a populous

cious, sweet nnd delightful, that few or th~
'vaking brethren, could interest an audience
t30 deeply. She hr..s rcprrscntations of the
kind that are, in the strict sense of the 'vurd,
called Yision. The follov.'ing n1ay serve a.s
an exa1nple: I sugsested to her one evenjng,
at 1\Ir. 'Vilhington"s, ihe propriety of re-
maining quiet during bcr sleep, like other
persons, instead of talking so earilestly, antl
at such length. 'rhe observation d icl not brenk
. Iter Somuiu1n. In her reply, she fir1nly
denied that she was asleep; she gave rca..
~on~ for her opinion; she affirme<l that the
haavens were in full (\isplay befo1·e her; she
beheld the dwellL~g of tl1e omnillotent, and
t11e celestial host in attendance~ she describ-

'vitb snell vivid descriptions, that a pa.inter
coulcl have dr~nvn a picture fro1n it.

1.81.5; containing an account of a ma.'ll,
1cho preached andpr·ayecl in his sleep.
DEAR SIR,
YouR favour of the 29th ult, with tbe
surprising case of Rachel Baker, 'vere re-
ceived two or three days ago. The case of
JOB CooPER, \Vitb \Vhom I \Vas "rell ac-
quainted, "vas equally so. Job Cooper, 'vas
a \veaver by trade, and lived \vith a \Yenyer
by the na1ne of Beans, about three hundred
yards from n1y father's house, in the county
ofBucks, in the state of Pennsy1vania, " 'hen
he becan1e a sleeping preacher.
The facts respecting this extraordinary
case, and \vith which I \vas perfectly ac-
quainted, being frequently a witness for ma-
ny months, at·e nea1~ly as follows : Mr Cootl-
er was an ordina1·y young man, about t\ven-
ty-one years of age, when \le first began
preacbing in his sleep ; his habits were not
bad, neither :\vere his piety or virtues above
the usual standard, his constitution was good,
and he generally excelled in athletha exer-
cise.s. He began preaching in the wlntet·;
{he ·weather, I recollect, \vas very cold. On
(lUC of those cold evenings, Mr. Cooper
"·cut to sleep on his l1ack upon a bench before
the fire, nfter j\1r. Beans ancl his \Vife ha(l
;.;one to bed ; and on that llench he preached
his first sermon ; \V hic.h ' vas distinctly heard
hy his mntlloycr a.nd \Vife, \'rho supposed he
\vas n1in1ic.ldng some pnhlic friend '''hose
tneetiugs l1e attended ; though he belonged
to no particular religious society.
'£he next .day his employer, Mr. Beans,
spoke to him, about the impropriety of sucll
contluct, hut Mt·. Cooper declared himself
innoe.ent of the char·ge, and totally ignorant
of a.ny thing nnnsual happening to him in his
sleep. In the e\,.cning, .IVft-. Cooper and the·
i:uni ly rclil'e<l to rest at their Estutl ti1nc, hut
hefon! 1niduighi, 1\.ft·. Coopel, began his sc-
t•ond sermon, upon 'Yhich ~Ir. Beans and
his 'vifc got tlp, lit a candle, '\'ent into l1is·
t'OOtu, ancl stood hy liis betl till he l1a<l finish-
e,\ his discourse~ a.ftct· 'vhicb he imtuediate-
ly aYrokc: an<l inquired of then1, '~.rhy they
\Vct·c distntbin~ hitn by hi·inging a eandle in-
to his roon1 at that time of night. He "·as in-
formetl l1c hatl been p1·euching again; at
'Yhich he appearecl 1nuch snrpri~cd, not be.
nience fro1n dreams or other cn.ltses itnriu~
his sleep; the next day, 1\Ir. Bean~ calle<l on
Mr. Benjamin Kinsey, a respectable gentle-
man of the neighbourhood, and n1y Fathel',
and co1nn1unicate<l the circun1stance to them.
,
1·equesting them at the sam2 time, to go to l&is
house before midnigl1t, \Vl1en he \Voulcllct
them in to \Vitness the £1.et; and examine as
far as they were able such an uucen1mon and
-eurious case ; to \Vhieh they eonsented. They
went at the appointed time, accompanied by
myself, then about seventeenot·eighteen years
of age, andoneotherperson. We hadnot wait-
ed longbefore Mr. Cooperbegan histl1ird dis-
course, \vhen we were conducted Into bis J;oom.
-
He began with a prayer, follo\ved by an ex:-
bortation, an{l concluded 'vitb a short prayer ;
this 'vas the first time that he either commen-
~ed or ended with a prayer. A sl1ort time
after concluding the second prayer, he a'Yokc
a_nd conversetl \vith the company, a1Hl ap-
-peared somevihat mortified, as he expresse(l
it, at becoming an object of curiosity, frotu a
circumstance neither "vithin his own knowl-
eclge or control. His prayers atHl exhortn -
tions were al\Yays preceded by a shiYe.ring
or treJnhling, accon1panie{l 1rlth groaning.-
53
arul spa.stns, generally slight, though not
ahvays so ; his respiration not entirely free,
being fa·eqnently suspended or interrupted,
sitnilat· to that of a person su<ldenly alarmed
or fa·ightened; hut all those symptoms disap-
pearecl the i,1stant he hcgan to articulate, like
a pen.;on heing l'Clievecl fron1 the lncubus, or
Ni~htluare, on being moved or spoken to.
~\ftcr concludiug his prttyer and cxllortations,
l1e generally had a slight return of the symp-
tonts already n1cntioned, after 'vhich he a-
\vukc. }?rom the comincncetnent of the pa-
rox~ynl till after the conr.lnsion of his <lis-
course, he apllearetl insensib-le of 'vhat 'vas
l>assiug in his l'Oom, and neither replied to
any c1nestions put to hhn, or suffered an in..
tca·rnption in his exhortations fro1n the con..
vct·sation of the spectators about his be£1..
His articulation \Vas rem~u·kably distinct, an(l
l1is discourses tlelive1ed 'vith a fluency far su-
llcrior to any thing he conld perform 'vhen
:nvake. 'rhe singularity of his case, excite(l
the curiosity of great numbers of people to
come frotn considerable distances, particu-
.arl.r front the city oi Philadelphia, to be
\VHnc~~c~ of so extraordinary a fact. 'rJ1is
·uriosity abated in Jess than a year, ·when
E..z
51·
he \vas left to sleep quietly ant1 pre~ch with-
out interruption. Son1e fc\V years afterwar(ls,·
he went to reside in Vh~ginia, \Vlte1·c I under-
stood, twelve or fifteen years subsequently,
that he continned at tin1es to be iroubletl \Vith
the same complaint. A number of me.dical
gentlemen occasionally atte1ule(l his discour-
ses, \V ho all agried, that it \vas the effect of
some disease \Vith 'vbich they \vere totally
ignorant, and that the regular }Jaroxysms of
the disorder \Vere abate.d or carried off by
the exercise of speaking ; to this it was ob-
jecte(l, that if speaking alone was sufficient
to earry off the pa1·oxysms, wl1y were his ex-
ercises, without a single exception, confined
to the subject ofreligion? a subje~t which no
one ever knew to have arrested his attention
beyou<l the con1mon received principles i>f
morality. My own impressions have al\vays
been, that it \Vas the effeQt of disease ; a dis-
ease however, 'vhich had no visible effect
upon his health, constitution, habits, or his
1nind when awake. These Sir, are the
principal facts relative to this extraordinary
£ase, and to ·which I was a witness at vari-
0tl~ times for several months, a.nd shall now
e9nclude this '"·ith a quotation f\·o1u the Die..
tionnaire Philesophique.

ctune cmn.ciated, and at length 'vas like a liv..
in~j Hkcleton. His life was no'v threatened.
J[e \Yns attcn«lecl lly a pl1ysician, a young
gentleman vd1o was attached to him by the
f>trictest and \Varmest f1·iendshijl. He gre\V
\Vorsc and worse, till little hope of life \Vas
]eft. In this situation his spirits failed hbn,
and he began to entertain doubts of .Ris final
l1appiness. He \vas conversing, one morn-
ing, with bis b1·other, in Latin, on the state
of his soul, 'vheu he fainted and died a·way.
After the usual time, he was ]aid out on a
board, according to the common practice of
the country, and tl1e neighbourhood ,yere in-
vited to ~ttend ltis funeral on the next day.
In the evening, his I>hysician and friend re-
Mrnetl ft·otn a ride into the country, an(l \vas
afllictcd beyond nteasurc at the ne,vs of his
death. He could not be persuaded that it
'vas certain; and on heing told thnt one of
the persons who ltad assisted in laying out
the body thonght he had observed a little trr~
tnor of the ffesll nuder the arm, although thr~
~8
body was cold aud stiff, he cndea...-otn·cd to
ascertain the fact. l-Ie first put his o'vn hand
into \Varm \Vater to tun.ke it as scusiLle as pos-
sible, a1ul then felt nnclcr the arm, nnd at
the heart., and affirmed that he felt an usual
warJnth, though no one else could. He had
ihe body restored to a v¥artn bed, and insist.
e<l that the people, ·who had been invitetl to
the funeral, should be requested not to at-
tencl. To this the brother objected as absurd,
the eyes being sunk, the lips discoloured,
an<l the " T
hole body colil antl stiff. llo,vev-
'
er, the doctor fina11y preyailed; and all pro-
bable means 'vere used, to tliscover synlp-
toms of returning life. But the third day ar-
rived, ancl no hopes \Vete entertained of suc-
cess but by the doctor_, \Vho never left him
night nor day. The people 'vere again invi-
ted, and assembled to attend tne funeral.
"rhe doctor still oLjected, and at last confin-
ed l1is request for delay to one l1our, then
to half nn hour, and finally to a quarter
of r..n hour. He bad diseov~re(l that the
tongue was much s'voln, and threatened to
crack. He \Yas endeavouring to soften it,
by 5'ome emollient ointJuent put upon it \Vith
;1 fPathcr, 1vhen the brother came in~ nJaont
"
the cxpil'alion of the last pe.riod, and nlisll\-
king \vhat the doctor 'vas doing, for an at-
tetnpt to feed him, 1nanifestecl some resent~
ment, and in a. spirited tone, said, "It i~
shameful to be feeding a lifeless corpse ;''
and insistecl, ·with earnestness, that the fu-
lH'.ral ~hould inunec\iatcly proceed. At thie
ctltical and itnportant mon1cnt, the horly, to
Hte gt·Pttt alartn and astonishn1ent of all pre-
sent, opened its eyes, gave. a dreaflfnl groan,
and sunk again into apparent death. This
put a.n end to all thonghts of burying him,
and CY4_l.ry effort ·was again employe<l in hopes
of hringing about a speedy resusc.ita.don. In
nhout an hour, the eyes again opened, a
heavy gro:ln proceeded ft-otu the body, and.
again all appearance of animation vanished.
In anotber hour life sce1ncd to return with
n1orc power, and a con1plete 1,evival took
Illarc, to the great joy of the fu.mily and
f1·iends, antl to the no s1nall astonishment and
conviction of very many who had been ridicu-
ling the idea of restoring to life a. dead body.
~Ir. 'feuneut continued in so \veak and
low a state for six \vceks, that great doubts
" "ere entertained of his final recovery. Ho\V·
over: after that period, he recoye1·ed much

pause. His brother asking hilll what wa.s
the matter, he said, that he felt a suddea.
shock in his head, and it no\V see1ned to him
as if he had read that book before. By de-
grees his recollection was restored, and he
coulcl speak the Latin as fluently as before
his sickness-. His memory so con1pletely re..
vived, that he gained a perfect knowledge of
tlte past transactions of his life, as if no diffi..
culty had previ'Ously occurred. This etent,
at tbc titnc, made a considerable noise, and
-atfor<led, not only matter of serious contem-
plation to the tlevout christian, especially
\vhen connectetl 'vith Vihat follows in this
narration, hut furnisl1ed a subject of deep in-
vestigation and learned inquiry to the real
philosopher and curious anatomist.
'.fhe w.riter of these memoirs \Vas greatly
interested by these uneotnmon events; and, on
n favourable occasionJ earnestly pressed Mr.
Tennent for a minute account of what bis
viell·s and tq~prehensions were, \Vhile he lay
in this extraordinary state of suspended ani..
1natiou. He discovered great reluctance to
enter into any explanation of his perceptions
and feelings at this time ; but, being importu-
nately urged to do it, he at len~th consented..

,
" "hat passed around hin1, on a Sunday afterM
tJoon, his sister, \Vho had staid frotu church
to attend l1im, 'vns reading in the Bible,
"vl1en he took notice of it, and asked her
\:vhat she l1ad in her banrl. She ans\Yere<.l
that she ~·as reading the Bihlc.. He I·ep1i-
ed, '' ''rhat is t.he bible? I kno"\v not 'vhat
you Inean.'' This affected the sister so n1ucb
that she burst into tears, and informed hhn,
that he \Va.s once \vell acquainted with it.
On her reporting this to tl1e brother \vhen lte
returned, Mr. 'I'ennent \Vas found, upon ex-
alnination, to be totally ignorant of every
transaction of his life previoua to his sick-
ness. He coul<l not read a single 'vord,
neither clid he seetn to have any idea of what
it meant. ..A.s soon as lu~ became capable of
attention, he 'vas taught to read and 'vrite~ as
children are usually taught, and afterwards
began to leai'n the Latin language under the
tuition of his brother. One day as he \vas re-
citing a lesson in Cornelius Nepos, he sud-
denly started, clapped his hand to his head,
~s jf something l1ad hurt hiJn, and made a
and proeee{led lYith a solemnity not io be
described.
"\Vhile I lYas conversing lvith n1y broth-
er," saitl he, "on the state of my soul, aud
the fears I had entertained for my future wel-
fare, I found myself, in an instant, in a.noth...
er state of existence, under the direction of
a superior being, lvho ordet·ed me to follo'v
l1im. I was accordingly wafted along, I
l{llO\V not holv, till I beheld at a distance an
ineffable glory, the impression of lvhich ou
my min(l it is impossible to communicate to
mortal man. I immediately reflected on my
ha}>py change, an{l thought; 'vell, blessed
be God! I am safe at last, notwithstanding
alltny fears. I sa'\v an innumerable host of
happy beings, surrounding the inexpressible
glory, in acts of adoration and joyous \lOr-
ship ; but I did not see any bodily shape or
1·epresentation in the ~lorious appearance. I
heard things unutterable. I heartl their songs
and hallelujahs, of thanksgiving and praise,
'\vith unspeakable ra.pture. I felt joy unut-
terable and full of glory. I thftn a.rJplied to
my conductor, an<l requested leave to join
the haJ>py throng. On '"hich he tapped n1e
()U tae shoulder, and said, ' Yon 1uust rc...
turn to the eal'lh.' 'rhis seCJned like a s'vortl
throu0h my heart. In an instant I reco11cct
to l1avc seen my brother standing before me,
disputing \vith the doctor. The three days
t.lul'ing which I 11ad appeared lifeless, seem..
ctl to n1e not 1norc tlu\n ten or hvcnty min-
utes. 'flte idea of returning to this .world of
sot·ro\Y antl trouble, gave me such a shock,
that I fainted repeatedly." He added,
•: Such was the effect on my tnind of \Vhat I
had seen and heard, that ifit be possible fol'
a human heins to live entirely above the
"Yol'hl an{1 the things of it, for some thnc af-
tct·w..u·<ls, I \Vas that person. The rayishing
sounds of the songs an(l hallelujahs that I
heal·d, and the very \Vords that were uttered,
\verc not out of n1y ears, \rhen a\vake, for
at least tht·cc years. .A.ll the kingdoms of

enly glory, that nothing 'vhich did not, in
~on1c utcasurc, relate to H, conld conlmuud

It is not stnprising, that after so affecting
au account, strong solicitude should have
been felt for further information as to tbe
\Yot·c.h:, er at least the suJ~jects of praise and
a.doration, 'vhich Mr. Tennent had hear<l
.But 'vben he \vas requeste(l to com1nunicate
these, he gave a decided negative, adding,
HYou \Vill kno'v thetn, "ith many otl1er pal'-
ticulars hereafter, as you "\vill find the whole
amoBg my papers ;" alluding to his intention
of leaving the 'vriter hereof his exer.utor,
whieh precluded any further solicitation.*
• It was so ordered, jn the eourse of divine Providenee, that
the writer was sorely disappointed in his expectation of obtain-
ing the papers here alluded to. Such, however, was the will of
heaven! Mr. Tennent's death happened during the revolution-
ary war, when the enemy separated the writer from him, so as
to render it impracticable to attend him on a dying bed ; and
before it was possible to get to his bouse, after his death, the
writer being with the American army at the Valley-Forge, his
son came frolll Charleston, and took his mother, and his father's
papers and property, and returr~ed to Carolina. AlJout fifty
miles from Charleston, the son was sudllen1y taken sick antl di-
ed among entire strangers; and nevet· since, tbou~b the write1•
was a]so left executor to the son, could any trace of the fa\lter's
'!Japers be discovered by him.

HiSTORY 01;- CYRlLLO PADOVANO, THE NOTED
SLEEP-\VALKER.
Ey Dr. Goldsmith.
IT J.:1s often been a question in the Schools,
\vhcther it be preferable to be a king by day,
and a beggar in our dreams by night; or,
tnvc1·ting the question, a begga-r by day, and
a. 1U01H\rch \Vhile sleeping ? It has been usu-
ally deci<letl, that the sleeping n1onarch \Vas
tiJc happiest man, since he is supposed to
enjoy all his happiness without contatnina.-
tion; \Vhilc the ntonarch, in reality, feels
the vn.tious inconveniences that atten<l his
'·tation.
However this may be, there a.:re none sure
tnorc n1isera.hle than those 'vho enjoy neither
sitnation \vlth·any tlegree of comfort, hut feel
all the inr.onvenicnces of \V~nt anti poverty

mous Cyrillo Padovano, of whom a long lire
has been vrritten; a man, if 1 1nay so ex-
press it, of a double character, who actetl a
very different part by night, from what he
professed in the day. Cyrillo was a native
ofPadua in Italy, a little brown complexion-
e<l man, and, while lt:\vake, remarkable for
his simplicity, probity, piety, and canclour ;
but unfortunately for him, his dreams were
of the strongest kind, and seemetl to over-
turn the whole system of waking morality ;
for he every night walked in his sleep, and
upon sucl1 occasions was a tbief, a robber,
and a plunderer of the dead.
The first remarkable exploit we are told of
Cyrillo, was at the university, 'vhereheshew-
ed no great marks of assiduity. lJpon a
certain occasion his roaster set him a very
long and difficult exercise, which Cyrillo
foun<l it impossible, as he supposed, to exe-
cute. Depresse<l with this opinion, an<l iu
certain expectation ofbeing chastised the next
day, he went to bed quite dejected and un..
easy : but awaking in the morning, to his
great surprise, he found his exel'cise com-
pletely and perfer.tly finished, lying upon
'his table, and, still more .extraordinary!
written in his own hand. This information
be comtnnnieatcd to his master when he ~ave
up his task: \Vh.o being equally astonished
with him, resolve£1 to try him the next day,
'vith a longer and more difficult task, and to
watel1 him at night when he retired to rest.
Accordingly, Cyrillo was seen going to be(l
\vitl1 great uneasiness, and soon was heard
to sleep profoundly; but this did not conti-
nue long ; for in about an hour after he lay
down, he got up, alighted his candle, and
sat down to study, 'vhe1·e he completed his
task as before.
A tnin(.l like Cyrillo's, not naturally very
strong, and never at rest, began, when he
arrived at Dlttnhoocl, to become gloomy, so-
licitous and desponding. In consequence of
tJtis turn of thinking, he resolved to leave the
\Vorld, and turn Carthusian, \Vhich is the
most rigorous of all the religious orders.
Formed for a severe an(l abstemious life, he
'vas b~re seen to set lessons of piety to the
whole Coin'ent, and to she'v that he deserv~
ed t11e approbation as well of l1is fello,vs in
seclusion, as of the 'vhole order. But this
good fame did not last long; for it 'vas soon
found that Cyrillo ·walked by night, and, ,as
68
've are toltl of the fable(l Penelope, undid in
his sleep all the good actions for,vhich he luul
been celebrated by day. "The first 11rar~ks
be played 'verc of a light nature, very little
more than running about from chatnLer to
eltan1ber, and talking a little more loosely
than becan1e one of his professed piety. As
it is against the rules of the fraternity to con-
fine any man by force to his ceH, he \vas per-
mitted, in this manner, to walk about; and
though there was nothing very edifying in bis
sleeping conYel·sation, yet the Convent 'vere
content to o'7erlook and pity his infirmities.
Being carefully observe{\ upon one of these
occasions, the following circumstances offer..
ed. One evening, having fallen asleep on
ltis chair in his cell, he continued immovea..
ble for about an hour ; but then, turning
about in the attitutle of a listener, he laugbetl
heartily at 'vhat he thought he lteal'll spol{en;
lhen snapping his fingers, to she'v he did
not value the speal{er, he turned to,vards the
next person, antl made a sign with l1is fin-
get·s as if he 'vanted suuif; not being suppli-
ed, he seen1ed a little disconcerted ; and
pulled out his o'vn box, in which there being
nothing, he scraped the inside as if to fincl
69
S(nnc : he next ' 7
ery carefully put up his box
again ; an<l looking round l1im with great
suspicion, buttoned up the place of l1is frock
where he kept it. In this manner he contin-
ue(\ for some, time immo,·eable ; but without
any seeming cause, tle"Y into a most outra-
f)OUS passion, in 'vhich he spared neitheP
oaths nor execrations ; 'vhich so astonished
antl scandalized his brother Friars, that they
left hitn to execrate alone.
llut it had been well if poor Cyl'illo went
no farther, nor driven his sleeping exb·ava-
ga:ncies into guili. One night he was per-
ceived going very busily up to the altar, and
in a little beaufet beneath, to rummage with
sonte degree of assiduity. It is supposed
tiJnt he '\Vished to steal the plate which was
nsua1ly deposited there, but 'vhich bad acci-
'lentally been sent oft' the day befo1·e to be
clcanc(l. Disappointed in this, he seemed
to lu:~ extre1nely enraged; but not caring to
retnrn to his cell empty haniied, he claps
on one of the official silk ''estments ; a:nd find-
ing that he could carry still more, he put
on one or hvo more over each other ; and
thus cumbrously accoutred, he stole off with
a. look of terror to his cell ; there hiding bis
'7i
mortification. The society conside,red th~
deposition of their benefactress antotlg them
as a very great honour, and masses iu abun- .
dance \Vel"e promised for her safety. But
'vhat \Vas the amazement of tbe whole Con-
,·cnt the next tlay, when they found the
vault in which she \Vas depositecl broke open,
the bo«ly mangled, her 1ingers, un which
'vere son1e rings~ cut off, and all her finery
cara
·red :nvay. E\·cry person in the Convent
\Yas shocked at such barbarity, and Cyrillo
\Vas one of the fore1nust in condemning the
sacrilege. However, shortly after, on go-
to his cell, having occasion to examine under
the tnaHress, l1e there found that he alone
'vas the ~uiltless plunderer. The Convent
lV:ts soon ntade acquainted \Vith his misfor-
tmtc : aud at the general request of the ft·a-
tcrnity, he \vas retnoved to another Jnonastry,
\vhere tl1e Prior had a po,ver, by right, oi
confining l1is couventuals. Thus, debarrell
front cloing 1nischief, C~Tillo led the reJnain-
der of his life in piety and pcac~.

bed chamber, in which no person slept but
himself. It was in the month of September,
and at the full ofthe moon ; the night unusu-
ally clear. He 'vas not thinking of his child
at the time, but of a very different subject.
He fell into a slumber which laste(l some
time. The \Yindo\v shutters were open
and the room very ligl1t. 'Vhile he was
awake, thinking on some very important sub-
ject. a person appeared to him, and in a
lotul and distinct voice, pronounced these
words, you'l~ child is dead .' he saw a man
lValk across the room, and could distinguish
the coat of a dark grey, with black trin1mings

l1imself do,vn to continue l1is nap. Those
\Vho had \Vatched bim during this interval,
",.ere \Villing to see his manner of behaving
the morning after.
"\Vhen Cyrillo a'vaketl, he sce1ned at first
a good deal surprised at the hnnp in the mid.
dle of his bed ; an<l going to examine the
eause, was still more astonished at the quan-
tity of vestments that \Yere bundled there; he
'vent among his fello,vs of tl~c Convent, in-
quiretl ho'v they came to be placed there,
ancl learning the manner from them, nothing
could exceed his patience and C(}ntrition.
His last and greatest project 'vas consider-
ed of a still more heinous nature. .A. lady,
lvho l1ad long been a benefactor to the Con-

she had made for that pnt'pose. It was there

:tnd a part of l1er o'vn jewels, of ·which she
hau gt·eat abundance. The soletunity atten.
ding her funeral was n1aguiftcent, the expen-
ses great, and the sermon affecting. In all
this pomp of grief none seetneLlJnore affected

tion v.J
'VtTH respect to the pl1enomena of <lreatn-
ing, three different questions may be propos-
ed. First; 'vhat is t11e state of the 1nind in
sleep ? or, iu other words, 'vhat faculties
then continue to operate, and ·what faculties
arc then suspen(lecl ? Secondly ; ho\v far do
out· dreams appear to be influenced by our bo-
tlily sensations; antl in 'vhat respects tlo
they vary, according to the different coucli-
tiuns of the body in health, and in sickne"s ?
thirdly; ,\·ha.t is the cLangc 1\rhich sleell
produce on those }larts of the body, 'vith
'vhich onr mental operations are ntore imme-
diately connected ; and ho'v does this change
npet·ate_
. in divcr~ifying~ so rcrnnrkahly, the
phenomena which our mind, then exhibit:'
j.i..om those of ·which \Ve are conscious in oul~
1vaking hours ? Of these three questions, the
flrst belongs to the Philosophy of the Human
Mind, and it is to this question that the fol-
lo,ving inquiry is ahnost entirely coDfined.
·The second is Jnore particularly interestints
to the medical inquirer, and does not proper-
ly fall under the plan of this work. '.fhe
third seems to me to relate to a subject,
lvhich is placed beyond the reach of the hu-
man faculties.
It " '"ill be grantetl,. that, if 've eould ascer..
tain the state of the min(\ in sleep, so as to
be able to resolve the various phenomena of
dreaming into a smaller number ofmore gen-
eral principles ; and still more, if ·we could
resolve them into one general faet; we should
be atlvanced a very important step in our in-
quiries Ul)On this subject; even although we
o;hould find it hnpossible to shew, in 'vhat
n1anner this cl1angc in the state of the mind
-.:esults from the cl1ange which sleep produ-
ces in the ~tate of the body. Such a step
would at least gratify, to n certain extent,
that disposition of our nature \vhich prompts
lls to ascend from pat·iiculat' facts to genera,l

}~n\'S ; and. 'vhieh is the founua.Lion of all our
pl1i\osophical researches : anil, in tl1e pre-
~ent instance, I an1 inclined to think, that it
carries ns as far as our itnperfect faculties en-
ahlc us to proceetl. •
In con<lncting this inquiry 'vith respect to
Htc state of tlle min<l in sleep, it seen1s rea-
sona.b\c to expect, that sotne 1i0ht nuty be ob-
iaitwd, frotn an examination of tile circum-

proael• ; for, 'vhen we at·e dispose<l to rest,
it is natul'al to imagine, that the state of the
1nitHl approaches to its state in 8leep, n1ore
l\Cttr1v'l than 'vhen 've feel ourselves alive
.,
and aetive, and capable of applying all va-
•·ious faculties to their proper purposes.
In general, it n1ay be remarked, that the
:tpproaeh of sleep is accelerated by every cir-
cumstn.uce 'vhich diminishes or suspends tlll:l,
CX\"\\'c.isc of the tncntal po\vers ; and is rctard-
C(l hy eYC'.t'y thing which bas a contrary ten~
tlency. 'Vhen \VC wish for sleep 've natur-
ally rndcaYotn· to 'vithhold, as much as pos-
sible, all lhe active exertions of the mind, by
disengaging onr attention f1·on1 every interes..
ling s~1bject of thought. 1\rhen lre al".e dis~

posed to keep a'vake, 've naturally li*. onr
attentior1 on some subject \vhich is calculated
to afford employment to our intellectual po'v"
ers, or to rouse an(l exercise the active prin-
eiples of our nature.
It is well kno\Yll that there is a llarticular
.class of sounds 'vhich compose us to sleep.
The hum of bees ; the murmur of a fountain ;
the reading of an uninterestjng (liscourse ;
have this tendency in a remarkable degree.
If we exatnine this class of sounds, we shall
fin(\ that it consists 'vholly of such as are fit-
ted to 'vithdraw tile attenHon of the min<l
ft·om its o'vn thougl1ts ; antl are., at the same
·thne, not sufficiently intet·esting, to en~a;e
its attention to themselves.
It is also a matter of comtnon observation,
~hat children a1ul persons of little reflection~
- \Vl1o are chiefly occnpie(\ about sensible ob-
jects, and whose mental activity is, in a
great measure, suspendecl, as soon as theil'
:rerceptive powers are unen1ployed ; fintl it
extremely difficult to continue awake, when
they ar6\ deprived of their usual engagements.
~rhe same thing bas been remarked of sava-
r;es, whose time like that of the lo'\ver ani•
79
n1als, is almost completely dividetl between
sleep aud their bodily exertions.*
:Front a consideration of these facts, it
sectns reasonable to conclude, that in sleep
thoHe. operations of the mintl are suspended, -

Iy to be ilnagined, tLat, as soon as sleep

clusion is, that 'vhen we are desirous to pro-
~ure sleep, \Ve hring hoth mind and body,
:lS nearly as ·we can, into that state in 'vbich

~rlJe difference, therefore, between the st:1te
of the 1niuil \Vhen \Ve are inviting sleep, and

a.nd body ~ in consequence of son1c physical
alteration in the systetu, 'vhich 've shall ncY•
~r,. probably, he able to explain.
In order to illustrate this conclusion a lif-
tle farther, it tnay lJe proper to remark, that,
jf the suspension of our voluntary operations
in sleep be admitted as a fact, there are only
hvo suppositions \vhich can be for1ned con-
cerning its rause. The one is, that tbe po\V-
er of Yolition is suspended; the other tl1at
the '\\rill loses its influence oveL~ those facul-
ties of tl1e mind, and tl1ose n1e1nl)ers of the
body, 'vhich, during onr '\vaking hours, are
subjected to its authority. If it can be she,vn,
tl1cn, that the former supposition is not agree-
allle to fact, the truth of tbe latter seetns to
follow as a necessary consequcnee.
t. That the povver of volition is not sus..
pent.led during sleell, appears fron1 the efforts
·which \Ve a\·e f'.onscious of making "'·bile in
that sitllalion. We dream, for exan1ple, that
we at~e in danger ; and ·we attempt to call out
for assistance. 'rhe attempt indeed, is, in
general, unsuccessful ; and the sounds 'vhich
've emit, are feeble and indistinct : but tl1is
only confirms, or rather is, a necessary cou-
8!
~equcnec of the supposition, that, in sleep,
the conncxion beh,·een the will and our vol-
untary operations, is disturbed, or interrupt-
ed. The coutinuance of the po,ver of voli..
tion is <lcrnonstrated by the effort, however
inefl'eetual.
In like manner, in the course of an alarm-
ing llrcam, \Ve are sometimes conscious of
making an exertion to save ourselves, by
.... '
llight, fro1n an appt~ehended flanger; but in
spite of all our efforts, \Ve continue in becl.
In such cases, 've commonly dream, that
've n.re attempting to escape, and are pre...
ve.ntetl by some external obstacle : but the.
fact seems to he, that the body is, at that
time, not subject to the \vilJ. In the distur-
bed rest which ,,.e so1nethn<.'s have wl1en the
body is indisposed, the mind appears to re..
tnin son1e. po\ver over it; but as, even in
these c.n.~es, the n1otions \vhich are made,
consist rather of a. general agitation of the
"~hole system, than of the regular exe~tion of
n. p;u·ticular metnber of it, ·with a vie'v to
}H'Ocluce a certain effect ; it is reasonable to
conclndP, that in perfec&ly sou1Hl sleep, the
mind. although it rctains,thc Jlo,vet~ of vol~
tion, retains no influence 'vhatc.vc1~ o\·cr the
boilily orgaus.
2. ~.rhe same conclusion is confirmed by a:
different vie'v of tl1e sullject. It is probable,
as was already observed, that when 've are
auxiotts to procure sleep, the state into "·hich
we naturally bring the n1iud, approaches to
its state after sleep commences. N o'v it is
manifest, that the means 'vhich nature di..
rects us to employ on such occasions, is 11ot
to suspend the power of volition but to sus-
pend the exertion of those po\vers 'vl1ose ex-
ercise depends op volition. Ifit 'vere neces..
sary that volition should be suspended before
lve fall asleep, it 'vould be impossible for us,
by our OlVU effot•ts, to hasten the mo1ncnt of
rest. The very supposition of such efforts
is absurd; for it implies a continued will to
suspen(l the acts of the '"ill.
-~ccording to the foregoing doctrine, 'vith
t•espect to the state of tl1c mind in sleep, the
ctl"ect 'vhich is procluced on our 1uental oper-
ations, is strikiugly analogot~s to that 'vhich
is proceeded on our bodily powers. Frotn
the observations 'vhieh have been already
made, it is manifest, that in sleep, the body
is, iu a very inconsiderable degree, if at all.•
sa
r,uf,ject to our coJun1and. The vital aud iu.. ·
voluntary tnotious, however, stAffer no inter-
ruption, but go on as " 'hen \Ve arc a\vake,
in consequence of the operation of some caus-
es unkno\\'n to us. In like manner, it 'vould
appear, that those operations of the mind
'vhieh depend on our volition are suspended ;
\Vhilc certain other operations arc, at least
occasionally, cart·iecf on. 'Tl1is analogy nat-
ut·,tlly suggests the idea, tltat all our mental
opet·ations, wl.tich arc independent ofour \Vil1,
may continue during sleejl ; and that the
phcnouH'.na of dl'eaming may, perhaps, llc
1noc\ucetl hy these, diversified in their appa-
rt•nlt•IT'ecl~, in consequence of the SUSJlCnsion
of our voluntat·y po\vers.
If the appearances "T
hich the mind exhib..
its during sleep, are found to he explicable
on thi~ general principle, it 'vill posses all
the cvi<lence 'vhich the nature of the subject
a.\1n1its of.
It was formerly she·wu, that tl1e train of
r.lulllght in the mind docs not depend ilnnzedi-
atef.tf on out· 'vill, but is regulated by certain
general ],n,·s of association. .A.t the same
time, it appeared, that among the various
~uhjccts \Yhich thus spontaneously .present
85
}c~rotn these principles, c.ombined ·with the
general fact "·hich I huxe endeavoured toes-
tablish 'vith respect to H1e state of the. milHl
in sleep, t\VO obYious consQquences foHovv :
}·ir,t, that "'hen 'vc are in this situation,
the succession of our thoughts, in so far as it
dcpencls on the la\vs of association, ma.y be
cn.rriecl on by the operation of the same uu-
kno·wn causes hy 'vhich it is produced w·ltile
\.\'C arc awake ; and, secondly, that the or~
aler of our thoughts, in these tvro 8tates of the
n1ind, 1uU.st h\' '\·cry different; inasmuch as,
iu the one, it clepends solely on the laws of
association ; and iu the other, on these la,Ys
C(nubiuc<l 'vith our on·n voluntary exertions.
In order to ascertain how far these conclu-
;';ions arc agreeable to truth, it is necessary to
·~onlp:tre them 'vlth the kuo,vn phenou1ena
dt·ea•ning. For \Yhich purpose I shall en-
den.vour t-o she"\\·, iit·st, that the succession of
nnr thoughii in sleep, is regulated by th~
same general la,vs of association, to 'vbich it
is suhjectecl while " 'e arc a·wake; and, s~­
t;ondly, that the circumstances which dis-
critninaLe dreaming from our w·akiugthooghts,

of attention ; and that, by doing so, \Ve not
cnly can stop the b·ain that '\\·ould otherldsc
have succeeded, but frequently can divc1·t
the current of our thoughts into a nc\v chan-
nel. It also appeared, that \Ve have a po,v.
er, ·which may be 1nuch improved by exer-
cise, of recalling past occurrences to the
me1nory, by a yoluntary effort of the recollec-
tion.
The iu(lirect influence \Vhich the 1nind thus
possesses oYer the train of its thougltts ~s so
great, that tluring the \Vhole time \ve arc
:nvake, excepting in those cases iu "'·hich \VC
fall into what is called a reverie, and suffer
ourthoughts to follow their natural course, the
,,rder of tueit· succession is nhvays re.gula.te(l
more or less by the \vill. The \vill, ipdeed,
in regulaHng the train of thought, can oper-
ate only, as I already she,vetl, by availin~
itself of the establishellla'vs of association ;

In n. fortne1· part of this 'vork, I consider"'

1. 'rhat the succession of our Lbout;hts iu
sleep, is regu1atetl by the sau1c gcncralla\vs
of association, 'vl~ich influence the 1nind
lvhile 've are a'vakc, allpcars fro1n the fol-
lo,ving consideration.
i. Our dreatns are frequently suggested to
us by bodily sensations : an(l "ith these, it
is 'Yell kno"'n, from what 've rxpericnce
'\Vhile a\\·ake, that llarticular ideas are fre-
quently Yery strongly ass;;ociated. I l1a.ve
been told by a ft·iend, that, having occasion,
~n consequence of Rn ilulisposition, to apply
a bottle of hot )Vater to his feet when l1e went
lo bccl, he dreamed that lle 'vas making a
.journey to the top of mount .lEtna, and that.
he found the heat of the ground almost insuiJ-
portable. -~nother person, having a blister
applied to bis head, dreamed that he y~·a.s
scalpe(l by a party of Indians. I belie,re ev.
ery one who is in the habit of (lreaming,
"\Vill recollect instances, in bis ovrn case, of
a similar nature.
2. Our drean1s are influenced by the pre--
vailing temper of tbc miud ; aud vary in
their complexion aeeording as our habitual
disposition, at the time, inclines us to cheer..
fu1ness or to melancholy. Not tuat this ob-
88
cd tlle extent of that po,,~er ·which the mind
may acquire over the train of its thoughts ;
and I obserYetl, that those intellectual tlivcr-
sities amr,ng men, which \Ye commonly refer
lo lJeculiarities of genius, at'e, at least in a
great measure, resolveal>le into dilferenc.es
in their habits of association. One man pos-
sesses a rieL and beautiful fnuey, '\rVl1ich is at
all times obedient to his will. _4..notlu~r pos~
.'Jes5es a quickness ofrecollection, lYh.ieh ena-
bles him, at a 1noment's warning, to bring
together all the results of his past exlleriencc,

use for illustrating tlny propose<l subject. A
third, can, without effort, collect l1is atten-
tion to the most abstract questions in plliloso-
llhy ; can perceive at a glance, the shortest
a.n~l most rffcr.tual pror.css for arriving at the
trnth ; tuHl can banish fron1 his tnind every
extraneous idea, 'vhich fa.ncy o: casual a.sso-
eiation n1ay suggest, to distract his thoughts,
or to mislea(l his judgment. _1\. fourth unites
. all these llOWet·s in a capac.ity of pcrceiring
truth 'vith an aln1ost intuitive rapi<lity; and
in an eloquence 'vhich enables hiln to com-
man(l, at pleasure, 'vhatever his me1nory and
his fancy can supply, to illustrah~ and to
89
a•loru iL 'l~he occasional exercise 'vhich
such 1nen make of tbeir llO'\Vers, may un-
tlonhtedly be said, in one sense, to be un-
pretucditate<l Ol' unstudied ; but they all in-
dicate previous habits of meditation or study,
as nnqnestionallly, as the dexterity of the
expert accountant, or the rapid exposition of
i he professional musician.
:Fronl 'vhat has been said,. it is evident,
i lwt a. train of thought 'vhich in one man,
v.ronlcl rt~qnire a. painful effort ofstudy, may,
iu a.nothcr, be ahnost spontaneous : nor is it
to he donhtecl, that the reveries of studious
1ucn, even 'vhen they allow, as much as they
can, their thong1ats to follo'v their o'vn course,
:li'C 1nore or less connected together by those
pt·inciples of association, \Vhich their favout~ite
Jnn·suits tend more particularly to strengthen.
'.rhc inftueucc of the same l1abits may be
tl'act~ll clistincUy in sleep. There are proba-
bly fc\v Jnathctna.ticians, 'Yho have not dl·eam-
cd of an interesting I>roblem, an<l 'vho have
Itot c\·cn fancied that they \Verc prosecuting

90
~upations ; and sometimes feel themsclves
possessed of a fluency of speech, 'vhich they
never experienced before. The ?oet, in his
dreams, is transported into Elysium, and
leaves the vulg:tr and unsatisfactory enjoy-
ments ofhu.manity, to d\vell in those regions
of enehant1nent and rapture, 'vhieh have been
created by the divine imaginations of Virgil
and of 'rasso.
"And hither Morpheus sent his kindest dreams,
" Raising a world of gayer tinct and grace;
" O'er which were shadowy cast Elysiru1 gleams,
'' That play'd inwaving lights, from place to plae~,
'" And shed a roseate smile on N atul'e's face.
''Not Titian's pencil e'er could so array,

~uNo, fair illusions ! artful phantoms, no !
"My muse will not attempt yolll' fairy land :
H She l1as no colours, that like your's can glow ;
~'To catch your vivid scenes, too gross her hand."lt
...4.s a farther proofthat the succession of our
fhoughts in <Ireaming, is influencetl by ourpre-
vailinghabits ofassociption: itmay be remark.
ed, that thescenes and occurrences which most
frequently present themselves to tbe min(l
• ~astle of Indo.len~e.
9i
'vhilc 'vc are asleep, are the scenes and occur~
rcnces ofchildhood and earlyyouth. Thefacil-
ity of association is then much greater than in
n1ore advanced years ; and although during
the <la.y, the memory of the events thus asso-
ciated, may be banished by the objects and
1nusuits which press upon our senses, it re-
tains a more jlermanent bold of the mind
tl1nu any ofour subsequent acquisitions ; and
like the knowledge \Vhich '"e possess of our
n1other tongue, is, as it were, interwoYen and
incorlloratetl \vith all its most essential ha-
bits. Accor<lin~ly, in o1d men, 'vltose thoughts
are, in a great mea~ure, disengaged from the
'\vorld, the transactions of their middle age,
\Vhich once see1ned so important, are often
obliterated; while the mind dwells, as in a
drram, on the sports and the coJn}Janions of
their infancy.
I shall only observe farther, on tbis head,
tl1a1. in our dreams, as well as \\7
hen awake,
·we occasionally make use of ·words as an in-
struanent of thought. Such dreams, howev-
er, tlo not afl"ect the mind \Vitll such emotions
of pleasure and of pain, as those in ''rhich
tl1e iluaginntion is oceu1,ied \vith parti<~ular
objects of sense. The effect of philosoph]-
92
cal studies, in hal)ituating tl1c 1nintl to tho
allnost constant en1ploymcnt of this instru-
Jnent, nnd of consequence, its effect in 'veak-
ening the ilnagination, "·as forJncrly remark-
ed. If I am not n1istaken, the iuftuenoe of
these circtunstaBccs 1nay also be traced in
the history of our dreams ; ,~lhich, in youth,
comtnonly involve, in a n1uch greater degree,
the exercise of inutgination ; and affect the
mitul with n1uch more po·werful emotions,
tl1an "·hen we begin to en1ploy our maturer
faculties in 1nore general and abstract specu.
lations.
From these different observations, we a1·e
authorisecl to conclu{le, that the same la,vs
of association 'vhich rcgulate the train of our
thollghts 'vhile \Ve are awake, continue to
OJlerate during sleep. I UO\V proceed to con-
sider, ho'v far the circumstances which dis.
cri1ninate drea1ningfrom our'valdngthoughts,
eorres'(lond with those which migl1t be cxpec-
tea to result from the suspension of the influ.
ence of tl1e 'vill.
1. If the influence of tl1e will be suspended
dul'ing sleep, all our voluntat·y operations,
such as r(l'colleetion, reasoning, &c. ruust
a~o lJe susllcnde<l.
93
'l,hat lui~ l'(':llly is the case, the cxtrava-
gau,~e nud inconsistency of our drea n.1s ~re
sufficient proofs. "\Ve fre{luently confuun(l
together tin1es and plaees the most ren1ote
frou1 each other ; and, in the course of the
same dream, cotH·.eive tl1e san1e person as
existing in tlifferent llarts of the \vorld.
~ome.timcs lrc ima~ine ourselves conversing
'vith a dead friend, \Yithcut remembering the
circtunstanec of his death, although, pet:-
lwps, it happened but a fe\V days before antl
uffcctcd us deeply. .A.ll this proves clearly,
that the subjects 'vl1ich then occupy our
thoughts, are such as llresent tl1emselves to
the n1ind spontaneously; and that we have
no power of employing onr reason, in com-
paring together the differeut parts of our
•lrra.Jns ; or evt'n of exerting an act ofrecol-
l<·ction, in or<ler to ascertain how far they
are con~i.steut and possible.
'rhc pt·occsscs of reasoning, in -,.vhich 've
sometin1cs fancy ourselves to be engage(l dur..
iug sll'cp, furnisu no exception to the fore..
going observation ; for although every such
process: the ti1nc "~e fol'm it, itnvlies voli-
tion; an(l: in particular, irni>lies a t·ecollec-
tion ofthe 1n·emises, till 've arrive at the corr..
it O\'ill :;uggcsiions for the cotnposition of an
other.':·*
!!. If the influence of the '\'ill during sleep
he su~}}Cnlled, the mind will' remain as pas.
sive, \Vhile its thoughts chunge fron1 one sub-
ject to another, u.s it does <htring our 'vaking
l1ours, "'hil~ <litferent llercct.>tiLle objects are
1ncscntcd to our senses.
()f this 11assi-re state of the mind in our
ch·e:un~, it is necc~sary, to 1nultiply proofs ;
ns it has ahvays been considered as one of
the mo~t. extraordinary circutnstnuccs '' ith
'vhich they are accompanied. If our dreams,
as well as our " 'aking thoughts, " ·ere sub-

that in the one ca_se, as 'vell as in the other,
'"e 'rould endeavour to banis!1, as much as
"·e could, every iuea ·which ha(l a tendency

in spite of all our efforts to the contrary, 'vith

formerly ollservctl, tlutt our belief of the sep-
erate and independent existence of the ob-
jects of our perceptions, is tl1e result of ex-
perience ; which teaches us that these per-
ceptions do not depend on our ·will. If I
open my eyes, I cannot prevent 1nyself from
seeing the prospect before 1ne. The case is
different 'vith respect to our conceptions.
While they occupy the mind, to the exclu..
~ion of every thing eh;e, I endeavoured to
shew, that they are alv.rays accompanied \Vitb
belief; but as \Ye can banish thmn from the
mind, during our waking hours, at pleasu1·e;
:uul as the 1nomentary belief ,~·hich they pre~
tlnce, is continually checked by the surround-
ing objects of our perceptions, we learn to
consider them as fictions of our O\Vn creation ;
and, excepting in sotne aceidental cases, pay
1•0 regard to tbetn in the conduct of life. If
the docb·inc, ho\vever, forn1erly stated with
rc~1)cct to conception be just, and if, at the
sante ti1ne it be allo\ved, tbat sleep suspends
the influence of the 'vill over the train of our
t,houghts, \Ve should naturally be led to ex-
pect, that the same belief ·which accontpanies
perception \Vhile \VC are a"'·nkc, should ac-
colnpany the conceptions ·which occur to us
in our dreams. It is scarcely necessary for
r.1c to remark, l1ow striking1y this conclusion
coincides 'vit.h ackno\\·lcd.ged facts.
l\;Iay it not he considered as some c-oufir-
ntation of the foregoing doctrine, that when
~pium fails in pro<lueing eomplete sleep, it
conuuonly llroduces oneof the effects of sleep,
l~:r· suspending the activity of the mind, and
rhronring it into_a rc,·erie ; and that ·while ,ve
:trc in this state, our conceptions ft·equeatly

Another circumstance "rith respect to out
~onceptions during sleep, deserves our uo.
tice. As the subjects \Vhich lVC then think
upon, occupy the mind exclusively ; anu as
the attention is not diYcrted by the objects of
our external senses, our conceptions must be
proportionably lively and steady. Every
llerson kno"1
S l1o'v faint the conception is
lvhich \Ve for1n of any thing, \vith our eye.s
open, in compatison of what 1ve ct.a.n form
'vith our eyes shut ~ and that, in proportion
as \Ve can suspen(l the exercise of all our
other senses, the liveliness of our conception
increases. To this cause is to be ascribed,
in part, the effect which the dread of spirits
in the dark, has on some persons, '"bo are
fully convinced in speculation, that their ap-
prehensions are groundless; and to this also
is owing the e.ffect of an accidental llercep-
tion, in giving them a momentary relief from
their terrors. Hence the remedy which na-
ture points out to us, when we find ourselves
overpowered by imagination. If every thin~
around us be silent, we endeavour to create
a noise, by speaking aloud, or beating 'vith
our feet ; that is, we strive to divert the atten-
-tion from the subjeets of our hnagination, by
99
present.ing an ollject to our powers ofpercep-
tion. 'file conclusion "\\·hich I draw front
these observations is, tl1at, as tl1cre is no
state of the body in \vbich our perceptive
Jtnwt~rs a.rc so totally uneu1ploycd as in sleep,
it is natnrn.l to thinl{, that the ohjects 'vhicb
we conc€~iYc or in1agine, n1ust then 1nake au
in1prcssiou on the mintl, beyon<l con1parison
greater, tuan any thing of 'l"hich '''e can

'The pllcnotnena which 'vc have hitherto
e.xpla.ined, take place 'vhen s1eep scen1s to
be c.on1plcte ; that is, 1vhen the InilHl loses
its influence over all those po\vers ·whose ex-
. ct·cise dt~pcnds on its 'YilL '!~here are, ho,v-
evcr, n1any cnses in \vLich sleep semus to be
}Hlrtia) ; tbat is, 'vhen the 1nind loses its in..
flu''nee orer so1ne po,~·ers, nnd retains it oYer
others. In ihe case of tl1e sonznauzhu.li, it
l'(~ta.ins its po,ver over the litnbs, but it pos-
8esscs no influflnce over its O\Yn thoughts,
anti scarcely any over the body; excepting
those particular n1embers of it \vbich arc em-
ployc<l in "~a] king. In madness, the powell
ofthe',vill over the body re1na.ins undiminish-
ed, \Yhile its influence in regulating the train
orthought is ir~ n gt·eat measure suspended;
100
~Hher in eousequence of a particular idea,
which engrosses the attention, to the excln-
:)ion of every thing else, and wJ1ich we find
it in1possible to banish by our efforts ; or in
consequence of our thoughts succeeding each
other with such rapidity, that 've are una-
ble to stop the train. In both of these
kinds of madness, it is lvortby of remark,
that the conceptions or imaginations of the
mind becoming independent of our will, they
are apt to be mistaken for actual perceptions,
and to affect us in the same manner.
:By means of this supposition of a llartial
sleep, any apparent exceptions which the
history of dreams may afford to the general"
principles already stated, admit of an easy
explanation.
Upon reviewingtheforegoing obse1·vations,
it does not occur to me, tl1at I have in any
instance transg;resse(l those rules of philoso-
pllizing, 'vhich, since the time of Newton,
are commonly appealetl to, as the tests of
sound investigation. For, in the first place,
I have not supp~Jsed any causes 'vhich are not
known to exist; and, secon(lly, I have.
shP-\Vn that the phenomena under our consid..
eration. are Decessary consequences of the
1.01
causes to \vhich I have referred them. I
have not supposed, that the mind acquires
in sleep, any new faculty of which we are
not conscious while awake; but only, what
've kno'v to be a fact, that it retains some of
its po,ve1·s, while the exercise of others is
suspendecl : and I have de<luce{l synthetical-
ly, the kno,vu phenomena of dreaming, from
the operation of a particular class of our fa-
en]tics, uncorrected by the operation of an-
otJH~r. I flatter myself, therefore, that tl1is
inquiry "'ill not only thro\V some light on the
state of tbe ,.mind in sleep ; but that it will
have a tendency to illustrate the mutual adap-
tion an<l subserviency, \Vhich exists among
the different parts of our constitution, \\rhen
've are in complete possession of all the fa-
eillties and principles which belong to our
llature.
THE fore.going observations on the state
of the mind in sleep, and on the phenomena
ofdreaming were \vritten as far back as the ·
year -1772; and 'vere read, nea1·ly in t)m
form in 'vl1ich they are now published, in
the year 1773, in a private literary society

ding sensation : yet nothing can be n1ore n~­
~nn·d than to say, t-h:tt a m~tn 1uay, in the
same individual instant, beliet,e he is in one
place, and imagine l1e is in another. No
man can demonstrate that the objects ofsense
exist without him ; we are conscious of no-
. thing but our own sensations : ho"·evcr, by
the uniformity, regularity, consistency, and
steadiness of the impression, we are led to
believe, that they have a real and durab]e
eause 'vithout us ; and we observe not any
thing 'vhieh contradicts this opinion. But
the ideas ofimagination, being transient and
:fleeting, can beget no such opinion, or habi-
tual belief; though there is as much perc~iv­
ed in this case, as in the former, namely, a.n
idea of the object within the mind. It will
be easily understood, that all tlris is intended
to obviate an objection that might be brought
against the similarity of d1~eaming and itna.
gination, from ou1· believing in sleep that all
is real. But there is one fact that plainly
sets them hoth on a J>aralleJ, that in sleep we
often recollect that the scenes 'vhich 've be.
ltoh1 are a mere <lream in the sa1ue manner as
a person a\Yake is hc.bitually conYinced that
-1.03
on which I have the misfortune to dift'er from
some of my friends.
""\\Then I ant walking up the High-street
of Edinburgh, the objects which strikes my
eyes and ears give me an idea of their pre-
sence; an(l this idea is lively, full, and per-
manent, as arising from the continued oper-
ation of light and sound on the organs of
"
sense.
u ..~gain, when I am absent from E<lin-
lntrgb, but co11ceit'ingor imagining myself to
"\valk np the high-street: in relating, perhaps,
'vha.t befel me on such an occasion, I have
lik~'vise in my min<l an i<lea of what is usu-
ally seen an<l heanl in the high-street: an<l
tltis idea of imagination is entirely sin1ilar to
those of sensation, though not so strong and
durable."
"In this last instance, 'vhile the imagina-
tion last, be it ever so short, it is evi<Leut
that I thi,nlc •nyselfin the street of Edinburgl1,
as truly as 'vhen I drea1n I am there, or even
as " 'hen I see andfeel I an1 there. It is true,
've cannot so well apvly the 'vord belief· in
this case ; because the pe1'iception is not clear
or steally, being ever disturl•ed, and soon
dissjpated, by the superior strengtl1 ofintru-
iOft
of years afterwards, at a time when I \Vas
occupied with very different put·suits, I hap.
pened, in turning over an old ''olume of the
Scots }lagazine, the volun1e for the year
f 749, to meet with a short essay on the same
subject, 'vhich surprised me by its very stri-
king coincidence with some ideas which had
formerly occurred to me. I have reason to
believe that this essay is very little known,
as I have never seen it referred to by any of
the numerous writers \Vho have since treated
of the human mind; nor have even heard it
once mentioned in conversation. I ha(l some
time ago the satisfaction to learn very acci-
dentally, that the author was Mr. Thomas
Melville, a gentleman who die(l at the early
age of twenty seven ; and whose ingeniou.s
observations on light and colours, published
in the essays of the Edinburgh Philosophi-
cal Society, are well known over Europe.
The pasiages which coincide the most re-
markably with the doctrine I have stated;
are the following. I quote the first with par-
ticular pleasure, gn account of the support
which it gives to an opinion \vhich I former-
ly proposed iu the essay on conceptiun, an.(}
105
the representations of his imagination are
fictitious.''
u In this essay 1ve make no inquiry into
the state ofthe body in sleep.''
" If the operations of the min(l in sleep
can be fairly llctluced ft·om the same causes
as its operations 'vhcn awake, 've are cer-
tainly advn.nce<l one consi<lerable step,
though the causes of these latter should be
still unknown. 'The doctrine ofgravitation,
\vhich is the most ·wonderful and extensive
discovery in the 'vhole compass of human
~cicnce, leaves the llescent of heavy bodies
as great a mystery as ever. In philosophy,
as in geometry, the whole art of investiga-
tion lies in reducing things that are difficult,
intricate, and remote to ,v~hat is simpler and
easier of access, by pursuing and extendin.g
the analogies of nature."
On looking over tl1e same essay;- I find an
ohservation, 'vhieh I stated as my o\vn, in
Jlage 137 of1his \\'ork. "The mere imagiu~
ation ofa tender scene in a romance, or <Ira-
Ina, lvill <lra"' tea.l~s fi'Onl the eyes of tbose,
l\'ho knolv very "·ell \Yhen they recollect
thentselves, that the whole is fictitious. In
the 1uean titnc they must. conceire it is real ;

TuE opinion of Dr. Rush on dreaming,
an<l the kirHlred affections, is contained in
his last and 'Tery important \Vorlr, eutHlcd,
''Thiedical Inquil'ies and Observationsuponthe
Diseases ofthe HumnnMintl." He considers
dreaming the effect of imperfect sleep; aud
as being in reality a transcient paroxystn of
delirium ; \vhile de1iriun1 may be conteJnpla-
ted as a more la!iting dream. He thinks
the remote causes ofIncubus or Night.ntare,
the same witl1 those of drea1ns. In his judg~
ment, Somnan1bulism is nothing but a 1ighte1·
grade of delirium, an<l indeed, may be de-
fined to be a transcicnt paroxysm of tna(l-
ness and illusion, or, 'vhat I call llallucina-

To enumerate all the phenon1ena of dreams,
lll'<l to att.c1npt an explanation of their 1n·oxi..
mate cause, \voul(l require a previous ac-
count of the theory of sleep, and this y.,·ould
render it necessary to introduce seve•·al physi-
olo._;ical principles, all of 'vhich would be
foreign to the practical objects of tbiR \Vork ;
for v~·hich reason I shall barely rema.rk, that
drea1ning is the effect of unsound or imperfect
sleep. That this is the case, is obvious, from
its being uncommon among persons 'vho la-
bour, and sleep soYndly after1vards ; ~uul
from its causes to be mentioned presently.
It is ahvays induced by morbi(l or ir;:egu1ar

hence it i~ a.ccotupani~d 'vith the same errone-
ous t1·a·in, or the same incohere11ce of thought,
'vhich takes place in dcliriun1.
'rhi!3 is so much the cn5~e, that a dream
ma.y be considered as a tt·anscient paroxysm
of delirium- and delirium as a per1nanent
dream. It di1lers from 1nadness in not be-

dreatns are gDnerally acco1npanied witb dis..

food, drinks, exercise labour, stutlies, and
business, They are semetimes terrifying,
or distressing, an<l not only detract from
the happiness of life, but, "\\'·hen neglected,

By this turn, I mean that disease in 'vhieh
,
false perceptions take place in the ears and
eyes, in the 'vaking state, from a morbid af-
fection ofthe bra1n.~ or of the sense, \Vhich is
the seat of the illusion. It 1nay be consider.
etl as a waking dream. Persons affected
·with it, fancy they bear voices, or see ob.
j ~cts that do not exist. Tbese false percep.
tions nrc said, by superstitious people, to be
IJremonitions of death. They son1etirnes in.
(licate, either the forn1ing state, or the actu.
al existence of disease, 'vl1ich being seate<l
most com1nonly, in a highly vital part of the
}Jody, that is the brain, no'v an<l tl1en ends
in death, and thus administers support to
superstition. They de_pen(l, like false per.
'
f10
upon the back, by 'vhich means tho bloott is
disposed to stagnate in the places above men-
tioned, from an excess or diminution of the
force tbat Jnoves it.
Persons who go to bed in good health, and
are founcl dead in their beds in the morning,
it is supposed generally ~ic of this disease.
Its re1nedies should be the same as for
clreams, with the additional one of sleeping
alternately on each side.
Of Smnna1nbulisrn.
I shall introduce my remarks upon this
disease by copying Dr. Hartley's correct and
perspicuous account of its cause, in l1is "Ob-
servations upon Man."
"Those'vho walk and talk iu their sleep,.,
says the doctor, "have evidently the nerves
of the muscles concerned so free, as that vi-
brations, or nervous influence, can descend
from the internal parts of the brain, tl1e pe-
culiar residence of ideas, into them. At the
same time the brain itself is so oppressed,
that they have scarce any memory. Persons
who read inattentively, that is, see and speak
almost without re1nembering; also those 'vho
labour under such a morbid loss of memory,
as that though they see, hear, speak and a'!t-
:11:1
JH'O ne nata, frotn moment to 1noment, yet for-
get all imrncdiately, son1e,vl1at resmnble the
persons ·who 'vnlk ancl talk in their sleep."
Drea.n1iug, I have said, is a transcient par.
oxYSul of deliritun. Somnamhulis1n is uothing
hnt a highet· gt·at1e of the sr..me tli~case. It
is a w:anscient paroxystn of maoness. Like
1na.dne.ss it is accon1panied " 7
ith 1nuscular ac-
fioJJ. wHh incolH~rcnt. or coberent conduct,
, ~
and with that con1plete obli,·ion of both,
n·hich tnkes place in the \vorst grade of n1ad-
ncss. Coherence of conduct discovers itself
in ver~ons 'vho are affected 'vith it, underta-
king, or resu1ning, certain l1ahitual exercise
or employments. 'rhus \Ve read of the schol-
ar resuming l1is studies, tbe poet bis J>en, and
the at·tisau his labours, \vhile nnder its in-
fJucncc, ·with their usual industry, taste, and
corrtlctncss. It extended still further in the
late Dr. Blacklock, of Ediugburgh, who
ro~e fl'um his be(l, to 'vhich he l1ad retired at
an ()arly hour, can1e into the room \Vhere.his
f:unil~· was assembled, conycrsed 'vith them,
and aftcrwartls entertained thmn with a plea-
sant song, l\'ithout nny of them suspecting he
·was nsleep, and 'vithout his retaining, after
lie a'vokc, the least reco11ection of what Ire
bat} doue.
'vhen they are close to each other. This
proves them both to be the effect of disease
in the single person, who hears, or sees,
the suppose(\ voice o1· object. I am a'vare
·that this explanation of illusions, may be ap..
plied to invalidate the accotants that are giv-
en in the Old and N e'v Testatnents of the
~;upernatural voices and objects that " 'ere
beard or seen by individuals, particularly by
Daniel, Elisha, and St. Paul ; but they
a;hould no more have that effect, than the
eures of diseases that are llerfortne<l by nat-
:-aral means should invalidate the accounts that
are given in those books, of the same <liseas-
eB being cnred in a miraculous ntanner.
But admitting the voices or objects, that
were heard or seen, by the Prophets and
~postle above mentioned, to have been pro-
\iuced by a change in the natural actions of
the brain, or of the organs of hearing, or see-
ing, that change, consi(_lering its design,
:was no less supernatural, than if tbe voices
or objects supposed to have been heard or-
seen, had been real. It is remarkable, that
in all those cases, where miracles we1"e ne-
cessary, to establish a divine commission,
er a nevi <loctrine, every circumstance eon-
1:13
ccpt1on in madness, upon motion being exci·
ted in a part of the ear or the eye, 1vhich
tloes not ,.iiJrate with the iJnpression made
upon it, but comJnunicates it io a part upon
\rhich the in1pression of the noise heard, or
of the person seen, 'vas forme1·ly made, and
hPnce the one becomes audible, and the other
,,isihlc.
'£he deception, when n1ade upon the ears_,
consists most commonly in hearing our o'vn
names, and for this obvious reason, 've are
accuston1ccl to bear them pronounced more
f1·equenUy, than any other words, and hence
the llart of the ear, 'vhich vibrates with the
sound of our names, moves more promptly,
froru hahit, than any other part of it. For
the sante reason the deception, 'vhen made
upon the eyes, consists in seeing our o'vn
persons, or the persons of our intimate
fl'ieuds, 'vhetbe1·living or dead, oftener than
any other lleople. The part upon the retina,
ftoln 'vhich these images are reflected, move
1nore promptly, from habit, than any other
of that part of the organ ofvision. The voice
'vhich is supposed to be l1eard, and the ob.
jccts \\·hich are supposed to be seen, are
ueyer heard nor seen by two persons, even
K~
it§
nectc(l \vith them, was distinctly hearu, or·
seen, not by an individual only, but by hvo
or three, an{l sometimes by several hundred
"·itnesses, in all of whom it is scarcely pos-
sible for an illusion to have existed at the
sante tinte f1·om natural causes. 'I.,he reme-
'lics for illusions should be, bleeding, pur-
ge.s, and low diet, when the pulse indicate~
undue excitement in the arterial system. A
certain J\'Ir. Nicolai, a member of the acade..
my of sciences in Be1·lin, was much relieved
of tltis disease, by the application of :Leeches
to the hremorshoi<lal vessels.
In a reduce(\ state oft he system, the rem-
edies should be, cordial diet, and tonic
medicines. Mr. Nieo)ai heard tbe voices of
his friends only \Vhen l1e was alone, and in a
state of inaction. This fact suggests the ad.
vanta~es ot' cotnpa.ny an(l exercise, as add~
Uonal remedies in this (lisease.

Letter from JoSEPH PRIESTLY, LL. D. &e.
addressed to Dr. MITCIIILL, in 1801, con-
taining so1ne thoughts concerning Dreanzs.
DEAR SIR,
THAT ideas have a permanent existence
in the 1nind cannot be denied, because some-
times voluntarily, an<l sometimes involunta-
rily, they occur long after their .first intro-
duction. The brain, therefore, by tneans of
·which the mind is furnished 'vith a11 its ideas,
and 'vhich is the repository of them, must Le
of such a texture as not only to receive, but
firmly to 1·etain, the impressions that are
made upon it by the external senses. It n1ust
a1so be capable of keeping them in a <loranent
or quiescent state; for ideas may be forgot-
ten, and, at a great distance of time, recol-
lecte£1, and yet with the greatest certainty of
their being the satne that they were at the
first. By what kind of mechanism this is
effected is one of the great secrets of nature;
but the opinion of _1\lfr. Hartley, or 1·ather of
Sir Isaac Newton, seerns the 1nost p1·obahle,
viz. tba.t, <hn·ing the presence of any sensa..
lion, some part of the substance of the btain
is in a vibratory motion, and that in retaiuing
a disi>osition to vibrate in the 13ame ;manner

lUUllica.ted by seu~,ttion.

into a dotntant state, u1ust e,.onsist in tLe in-
avtHude of l11e ret;icu or the brain to \\'hich
they helnng to he ex~~ite.cl ; and in the case of
sle~'p.. this may he o,~·ing either to the com-
JJression of a part or the 'vho1e of tl1e brain,
so that it slw1l be krpt by force from perform..

That there actually are regions of the
brain, the repository of ideas and of knowl-
edge, "~hicb are someti1nes out of the reach
of voluntary excitement, is evident frqm
some persons entirely forgetting certain lan-
guages " 'hen they are in l1ealth and sober,
and speaking the1n fluently in a state of de-
lhium, insanity, or intoxication, of \vhich
som~ rema1·kable instances are given by Dr.
Rush, in the note above mentioned. One is
of a French countess who had forgotten the
"T
eIsh language, which sl1e ha(llearned of
hrr nurse, and yet spake H, and no other,
in the delirium of·a fe' er ; and another of a
young tnan 'vho, he told me: was a fello\V
student 'vitll hiln at Edinburgh, wl1o spoke
French fluently as he 'vas conducting l1im
to his lodgings, after drinking too 1nuch;
though the next day he not only remen1bered
nothing of it, but \Vas unable to speak that
language at all : but he had been well ac-
quainted 'vith it when he 'vas a boy. '.rhat
this kHo,vledge of these languages: and con-
sequently, the ideas that 'vere the elentents ef
f19
ir, actually existed in the 1ninll and the hrah1J
though in a. dor1nant state, cannot, tlterefore,
he denied : for in a state of extrao1·dinary
excitmnent, or excitement of a peculiar kind;
the lutowledge of them was actually revjyed.
I have bcax(l otl1er facts of the same kind
very well authenticated.
In a. state of perfeetly sound sleep, all
i<lcas, as far as appears, remain in this dor-
mant state. But this, I believe, .is the case
'vith Ycry fe\v 11ersons : for most. p£rsons ne.
ver sleep 'vithont dreatning more or less:
that is, though 1nany of their ideas are in a
..lorlnant state, otltcrs are not so, but occupy
the tuiaul, autl sometin1es even agitate it to a
;rent degree, ahnost ns much as in the most
intense cxerc.ise of its po·
wers when a\vake.
'Vith some persons these sleeping thought~
arc a continuation of those 'vith \vhich the
1nin(\ was occupied \vhen it 'vas awake; but
with n1yself, antl many other persons, tbis is
very rarely the case, the sleeping tl1oughti
l1aving no connection '\vhalever with the \vak-
ing ones. On the approach of sleep they
uuty be observed to come from some very
different quarter, and gradually to exclude
tlle others. Consequently, 'vhilc one part of
,
i t20
the brain is either cotnprcssetl or rclaxe<l h..·
slc{~p, and the i(leas belonging to it becontc
dormant, other parts are more excited; so
f.hat the hleas rrposited in then1 co1ne forth,
and ocr.upy the mind till the approach of vi.
gilance. This circumstance ''ras first obser.
vetl to me by an ingenious friend in England:
and since I have heard it I have gh·en par-
ticular attention to it, as much, at least, a~
the nature of the case \viii aumit : for a per~
son must a\\rake in particular critical ruo-
1ncnts to be able to 1nake any observations of
the kincl.
I remember, bo,vever, that before I heard
this ren1ark of my frientl's, I once awoke
from a <lream attended with circtunstances
exceedingly favourable to l1is Iuea, and the
hypothesis above mentioned. I thought I
\Vas attending a public speaker, whose voci...
feration \Vas very loud, and his tones very
peculiar. Before the barran~ue ·was conc}u.
tied I awoke. Bnt still, though no articula-
tion could be perceived, I had a distinct
hearing of the peculiar tones of the speaker,
resembling notes in 1nusic ; a1ul lying per.
frctly still, I attended to the sound a sensib1 e
space of i.ime.. T o satisfy myself that I 'v<JA
really awake, I opened my eyes, a11d stt"\Y
distinctly every thing in the room in which I
la.y. Ho\V long I might baye retained this
sound, remaining from my dream, I cannot
tell ; but on a very slight motion of my head
it instantly disappeared. Some time after
this I a\voke frotn another dreant in similar
circumslanccs. I thought I 'vas examining
an unfinished buihling, and, stan(ling on
some 1·afters near the roof, I heat·d hvo of the
carpenters speaking very loud to each other ;
and, awaking, I very distinctly beard the
sound of their voices, Sl, short time afterwards,
1.hough I could not distinguish any of tlteir
'\Vords.
In these cases it seems evident that the re.
gion of tl1e brain in whic.b the dreaming
thoughts prevail1nust have been different from.
that which is occupied hy the 'vaking ones,
nnd that one of the trains of ideas excluded
the other.
If I might indulge a conjecture on so ob-
"r.ure a subject, it \Vouhl be, that the regiolt
\)f the ideas \Vhich occur in dreatns is mort}
(lceply seated, nn<l, therefore, that tl1is in-
terior part of the brain is not so soon affecte,J
by the cau~e ofsleep as the exterior part. l f

sleep be occ:tsione<l by the con1prcssion of
the brain, as expet·iments made on the Par.
isian beggar, who could be made to sleep at
pleasure, by pressing that part of his brain
lVhich 'vas not coveretl by the skull, seems
to make probable, some light may be thrown
upon it from the consideration of the state of
the brain during sleep, when it is said all the
arteries of the body are more empty, and the
veins more full, than in a state of vigilance.
In the brain, the veins do not accompany
the arteries, as in other parts of the body,
but ente1· the skull, and issue from it in dif-
ferent places ; and the ran1ifications of the
veins spread over the lateral sinuses of the
· dura mater, which incloses the brain.. Dur.
ing sleep, therefore, the external parts of
the brain will be compressed by the diiten-
sion of these veins, while the arteries in the
interior part being less distended than in a
state of vigilance, those parts of the brain
that are contiguous to them 'vill be relieved
from their usual pressure.
If the disappearance of ideas in sleep be
o'ving to a relaxation of any part of the brain,
it is possible that, on this very account,
other parts, at son1e distance, may be iu a
ble to form any tolerable conjecture ho'v they
have come into a different situation. I there-
fore leave the subject to your greater ingenu-
ity ; and am, \vith considerations of esteem
...nd respect, yours, &c.

It is son1etbing favourable to the hypothe-
sis of tlae ideas excited in -tlreams, having
their seat in some region of the brain more
deeply seated than that whicb is occupied by
our 'vaking thoughts, that many per~ons,
~nul I am one of the number, seldom drea1n
of any thing that is recent. TJ1e persons
tltat occur in their drcan1s are generally those
that Jwxc been long dead ; but yet they are
never considered as having been dead, hut as
alive, and they speak an<l act in their proper
~lHlracters.
It seems to follolv, from this, that only
that part of the brain is at rest lvhicb was oc-
cupied by the more recent trains of ideas,
·while those \vhicb penetrated deeper, are not
so much affected by the cause of sleep. But
at one time those ideas must l1ave occupied

of the employment of the leisure hours of the

}{R. lJRUAN,
THE story I am no\v going to relate,
may be dcpende(l UilOn as a fact, and how
incredi11lc soever it may appear, there \Vere
so tnany eye 'vitnesses of the trut:b of it, that
no fact can be better attested. .A.bout the be-
ginning of the year 1759, one Joseph Payne,
a cou ntry latl about sixteen, came to live
·with Cnpt. Fisher of this to\vn, as a foot boy ;
be had before been serYant to a. :L'arn1er, at

lrimself, he has given me lea.ve ;" a fe'v mot·e
unconnected, but sensible expressions, as if
talking to the farme1~ l1is first master; he sup.
posed himself to haye been at church, named
a text, antl repeate(l a kind of sermon of
which tl1e following is an exact transcript.
"They lecl him away to c'rucify hint:"
"Don't you know what was then done? ot·
do you know the meaning of this day, Good.
Friday? why it is to be kept holy? You read
in the scriptures; they bonour me 'vith tlleir
lips, but their hearts are far from me; they
bear but do not understand. We find that the
chief priests and rulers led him, or caused
him to be led away to crucify l1im ; they at-
tempted to do it before, but had not power,
for his turn " 7
as not yet come. Ckrist him-
self, before he came upon earth, knew he
'vas to suffer ; an<l this day '\vas the son of
man naile(l to the cross, whilst his inveterate
enemies, the Jews, ~.vith jears antl scoffs,
telling l1itn, if he would shew himself to be
the son of God, to come do\vn from the cross,
and save himself; but he prayed for them,
and said, Fatherforgit•e then2,jor they know
'not what they do. Dear heart ! if \VC did
but duly and rigl1tly consider these things;
•
·we sl1ould act very differently from wbat 've
tlo at present. Did he not break bread and
bless it? observing at the same time, tl1at
one of his disciples that dipped \vith hhn at
the table should betray him. Good 'Were itfol~
that man, if he had never ~een born. lVhen
he was about to suffer, he cryed out, there is
-no S01'TOW like unto my sorrow, for the sins
of the ·whole world bore !fiOre heavily upon
him_. and 'vere more painful by 1nuch than
the nails in his hands and feet.
"Duringth~sethings allnaturewasdarken-
e(l, and seemed to be ouii of order : the tem-
ple was l'ent, and those who had been dead
appeared out of their graves. Notwithstan-
ding these terrible appearances, the Jews re-
mained lw,rd heartened, and unbelieving ;
and when he ·was laid in the sepulchre ; the
priest and rulers caused a guard of soldiers
to take care that his disciples ditl not steal-
~nvay the body. On the sabbath <lay the an-
gel of the Lord came and rolled alray the
stone, and sat upon it, and for fear of him,
the keepers did shake and became as cleatl

ed in Jerusalenz, the Jeu·s 'vere so far from
being inclined to belie"\<·e in him, that they
gave the soldiers that watcl1ed, large sums of
money to say ltis body 'vas siolen away by
l1is disciples. They even then 'vould not be
conYinced of their stubbornness, and there
are too many remain so to this <lay.
"As Christ was raised f1·om the dead on
Sunday, or tbe first day of the 'veek, we
keep that day in commemoration of H, and is
called Easter..Sunday. After his resurrect..
ion, he was seen of many. "\Vh:r llu you ask
ho\V I kno'\v these things? I have itfrom the
scriptures, and take pains and search for
them. Is it not said, seelc and yo11t shal!

ask and it shall be given yott; for eve1,y one
that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh
jindeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be
opened. Ho'v then can any man expect to
find.• unless he seeks? or expect mercy with-·
out asking for it? or, is it reasonable to sup-
pose, in a natural sense, a door 'vill be open-
ed to you unless yon first knock at it? No,
seek mercy and you sl1all find it, and then
you will say at the last day, I h«vefought a
1.3.1
good flgTtt; I have finished my cours~; I
have kept the faitlt. Henceforth is laid up
for.me a cro\vn of righteousness, which the
Lord, the righteous judge, sl1all give me at
that day : where such will see him, in his
glorifietl state, to oft·er up praises and thanks-
giving for ever an<l ever. And Jesus took
b1~ead and b'ralce it; saying, do this in re-
1Jzenzbrance ofme. Likewise the cup,; say.
ing, tllis ~is the 'new testament of my blood,
which is $ltedfor you. I will drink no more
ofthefr~tit ofthe vine, until that day I drink
it1zew in the lci1lgdom of heaven. Antl 'vhen
they bad sung an hymn, they 'vent out into
the ~fount of Olives. N o\V we go to church
from Sttnda!J to Sunday, confessing our ma-
nifold sins and wickedness, and come away
'vith no alteration in aur for1ner conduct.
We say : .lllmighty a'nd ntost merciful Fa-
tlteJ•, u·e have erred and strayed fran~ thy
ways lilce lost sheep; 'lee ha1.Je followed too
much the devices and desires of our own
hearts; we hat~e offended against thy holy

ought to l1ave done, and we lzave done those
things we ougld not to have done, and tlte1,e
is 1zo kealth in u.s. Now what benefit can
any pet•sou exllect front this confession, Utt..
less he does it 'vith a sincere tuind, and full
resolution, to lead a better life? don't we
sec the contrary of this every day ? instead
of co1nposetl ancl serious behaviour, bow rna..
ny run it over with a light, airy, and laugh-
ing countenance, and are glad when the task
is finished. But thou, 0 Lord, hat~e me'rcy
upon us nu·sel·able offenders. When sinners
go to church and crave mercy, wiil1 1vhat
face can they do it, unless it be with a full
determination to change the.ir ways ? (lo tl1ey
not kno\v they thereby add sin to sin ? has

not the Lor(l decla1·ed, the prayers of the
\Yicked are an abomination to him? but God,
looketh at that man that is of a broken and a
contrite beart, and trembleth at his word,
for God is a spirit, an<l 'vill be worshiped
in spirit and in truth. Did he not say to the
'VOJnan of Samaria; the hour con~eth tvhen
tlze Fathel· is to be tcorshippeil in spi1·it and

sal1:ation is ofthe Je\vs. But he canze to hi.~

begs of God ahnighty to govern and protect

don't know the true meaning of the 1vords,
and \Ve may lvell say, ''ve have erred
and strayed from thy 'vays like lost sheep,'
by \vhich there is too much reason to fear,
've shall stray into everlasting destruction.
For ' my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are my lvays, like your n'ays,'
saith the Lord : ' you honour me with
your lips, but your hearts are far from me,'
as was observed before; behaving not as
worshippers, but as hypoc1·ites ; for God
is not to be mocked; is not to be deceiv-

and one another. We are commanded to re..
tire in secret to our chall!bers and commune

Judge not therefore, lest ye be judged. For

IT 'vas a good piece of a'lvic.e wl1ich Py-

If I might second the philosopher's advice,
it should be mine, that in a morning before 1ny
scholar rose, he should consider \Vhat he ha(l
'been about that night, and with the same
strictness, as if the c.ondition he has believed
himself to be in, lYas real. Such a scrutiny
into the actions of his fancy must be of con-
siderable advantage; for this 1·eason, because
thr circ.umstances 'vhich a manhnagines him-
self in during sleep, are generally such as
entirely favour his inclinations, good or bad,
and give hhn imaginary opportunities of
pursuing them to the utmost; so that his tem-
per will lie fairly open to his view, ·while he
considers holv it is ntoYed ·when free frotn

The ocean which \vashes the south side of

ceous animal ofextraordinary size which had
been killed. The body had been towed to
land, antllay exposed at full length upon the
shore. Every person talked of the whale,
and the greater part ~f the people flocked to

of his own profession spiritualized, in a man-

T11rs memorallle event happened to\Yards
the middle of July, 171.9; hut I cannot be
exact as to the day. 'The major had spent
t11e cveujug and, if I mistake not, it was the
sabbatl1 in some gay company, and had an
unhappy assignation 'vith a 1narried 'voman,
of 'vhat rank or quality I did not pat·ticularly
inquire, 'vhom he was to attend exactly at
hvelve. The company broke up about ele-
fen; and notjudging it convenient to antici-
pate the time appointed, he went into his
chamber to kill the tedious 11our, perhaps 'vith
son1e a1nnsing bool<, or some other ,,·ay. Rut
it Yery accidently happened, that he took up

Ile thought he sa'v an unusual blaze of light
fall on the book \\rbile be 'vas reading, ·which
he at first ima.gined might happen by some
accident in the can(lle. Rut lifting up his
eyes, he apprehended, to his extretnc amaze-
ment, that there 'vas before him, as it were
snspcnded in the air, a visible representation
of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross, sur.
rounded on all sides with glory ; and was
impressed as if a voice, or something equiva.

cr,'' &c. And this gentleman adds, in a parenthesis, "It was
so lively nnt.l striking, that he could not tell, whether it \~as to
his bodily eye!!, or to those of his mind." This makes me think,
that what I batl said to him on the phenomena of visions, ap·
pllrltion~, &c. [as being, when most real. supernatural impres-
sions on the imagination, rather than attended with any exter·
n.at objecl] had some influence upon him. Yet still it is evident.

continued, he knew not exactly ho'v long,

made me several thnes take the liberty to
suggest that he might possiuly be all this
while asleep ; but lu)\Ve\'er that were, he
quickly after opened his eyes, an(l saw noth-
ing more than usual.
It may easily be supposed, he \Vas in no
~cnditinn to make any observation upon th~
tin1e in \Vb.lch he had retnained in au insen.
sible state. Nor did he, throughout all the
remainder of the nigl1t, once recollect tha.t
crin1inal and detestable assignation '"l1ich

rose in a tumult ofpassions not to be conceiv-
ed ; and \valke<l to and fro in his chan1ber, till
he \vas 1·ea<ly to drop (lown in unutterable as-
tonishtnent and agony of heart ; appearing
to ltimself the vilest monster in the creation
of God, 1vho had alibis life time been cruci~
165
(ying Cln·ist afresh by his sins, and now sa~-~
as he assuredly believed, by a miraculous
vision, the lton·or of 'vhat he had done.
\Vith this 'vas connected such a vie,v, both
of tbc majesty and goodness of God, as caus-
e(\ him to loath and abhor himself, an(l 'to
repent as in dust an(l ashes.' Ile immedi-
ately gave jtulgn1cnt against himself, that he
was ntost justly 'vorthy of external damna-
tion; he 'vas astonished, that he ha(l not
been ilnntc(liatcly struck dead in tlJc miust
of his 'vickedncss : antl, vvbich I think de-
serves particular rcntarlt., tho11glt he assur-
edly believed that l1e should ere long be in
hell, an(l settled it as a point 'vith himself
for several months, that the wisdom and jus-
tice of God di<l almost necessarily require
that such an enorntous sinner should be made
an exatnple of everlasth1g vengeance, and a
spectacle, as such, hoth to angels and 1uen,
so that he harclly durst prcsun1e io pray for
pardon ; yet what l1e tben suffered, 'vas not
so much from the fear of hell, though he con..
clu(\ed it " rouhl soon be l1is portion, as front
a sense of that horrible ingratitude he had
shown to the God of his life, and to that bles..

!ometimes does l1appcn, that \YC <lo not iru-
mccliately recollect \Yhct·e \Ye nt·e, nor \Vhat \VC
have been al>out, or have to do. JJut when
the memory starts into wakefulness~ it bl"ings
tbe knowledge of these things back upon us
like a flood of light~ an<l soutctintcs the drea1n
1vitb it.
But the most curious circuntslancc of the
mind in tbc state of drean1 is, the po'\'er it
l1as to becontc the agent of every person,
character, and thing, of \Vhich it dreams.
It carries on conversation 'vith several, asks
questions, hears ans\\'ers, gires and receives
information, an<l it acts all these parts itself.
Yet, ho,vevet' variously eccentric the ima-
gination nttty he in the creating of irnages and
i(l~as, it cannot supply the place of n1cntory,
"\vith respect to things that arc forgotten,
.
'vhen \Ve are a\vake. For example, if \Ve
have forgotten the na1ne of a. I>crson, aud
dream of seeing hint an<l asking his na.1ne,
he cannot tell it, fot· it is ourselves asking
ourselves the qn('stion.
But tholtgh the imagination cannot supply
the place of real Jhetnory, it has the 'vild
faculty of counter-feiting mctnory. It d1·eams
ef pe1·sous it never knew, an<l talks to them
170
jutlgment ; and the band and dial, like the
memory, record the operation.
No,v, in proportion as these several facul-
ties sleep, slumber, or keep a\vake, cluring
the continuance of a dream, in that propor-
tion 'vill the dream be reasonable or frantic,
remembered or forgotten.
If there is any faculty in mental man tl1at
»eve:.; sleeps, it is that volatile thiug, the itn-
agination. The case is different \vith the
jufl~ment and tnemory. 'rh.e sedate and so-
"her constitution of the j utlgment easily dispo-
ses it to rest, and as to the memory, it re-
cords in silence, an(\ is active only when it
is called upon.
That the judg1nent soon goes to sleep, may
he perceived by our so1netimes beginning to
dream before 've are fu11y asleep ourselves.
So1ne ratHlom thought rtlns in the minll, and
we start, as it 'vere, into recollection, tl1at
we are drean1ing, between sleeping antl 'va-
king. If the pendulum of a watch, by any
accident, beco1nes displaced, that it can no
longer control and regulate th{'. elastic force
of the spring, the 'vorks are instantly thro·wn
into confusion, and continue so as long as
the spring continues to l1ave force. In like
•
173
as if it rcmctnl)cred them as old acguaintance.
It relates circuJnstauces that never happened,
and tells theu1 as if they hall happened. It
goes to plar.es tha.t never existed, and knolvs
\Vhcre all the streets and houses are, as if
\Ve had been there before. 'I'he scenes it
creates are often as sceues l'emctnbered. It
\vill sotnetiu1cs act a dream within a dream,
and, in the dt'lusion of drea1ning, tell a
dream it never dreatned, and tell it as if it
\vas fron1 tnemory. .
It •nay also h(\, rctuarke<l, that the ilnagi-
nation, in a dream, has no ic.lea of time, as
1huc; it counts only by c.ircutnstauees, and
jf a succession of circtuustances pass in a
dt·eatn, that would n'quire a great length of
tjme to accotnplish them, it will appear to the
cla·camea·, that a length of time equal thereto
l1as passed also.
_t\.s tbis is the state of the tninll in a dream,
it tnay rationally be said, that every person
is llHHl once in b-rcnty.four l1ours; for 'vere
he to aet in the <lay ns he dt·ealns in the night,
he 'vonld be confined for a lunatic.
In a state of,va.kefulness those three facul-
ties heing all artive, an<l acting in unison,
constitute the rational man.
In dreatn it is otherwise, nn<l llicrerorc,
that state 'vhich is called insanity~ appc:u·~ to

tie~, and a ce~sation of the jndgtucnt du1·ing
'vakefnlness, tl1at "'c so often e.xpcl'icncc dur-

They are specimens of her utterance without any
premeditation whatever. Something of a s1milar na·
ture flows from her lips eve1·y evening during the year.
The present discourses are not sPlected as more rxcel·
lent or extl·aordinal'y than the rest. 'I'bey a1·c merely
such as were p1·onounced on the several nights wflcn
the stenographers attended. These jlersons were wcJI
v-ersed in the art of writing shorthand, and are profi·
cients in theology. '.rhey are, moreover, possesbed
of the hi~hest integrity ; on their reports, therefore,
the highest reHance may be placed. The curious will
find in them much information on the subjects upon
which they treat; and the philosopher cauuot fail to
class them among the most rare and wonderful perfor-
mances of the human mind.
It is wortl1y of remark, that these discourses 1vcrc
not confined to a small numberl or a particular class
of bearers; ministers of the gospel, lovers of literature,
v~taries of science, adepts in medicine, and seekers af·
ter truth from all the reputable walks of life, an<l from
every religious pel'suasion, have been present during

asked, ''How long have you known Je!SUS ?"]
It is no\v nearly three years since I have lov.
ed my Jesus, and I have reason to bless hitn
that be did not cut me off in my sins ; truly I
love him : h@ is the first among ten thousautl :
he is fairer than the sons of men : he is alto..
gether lovely : he is the rose of Sharon, and
the lily of the valley. I sat down under bis
shadow with great delight, anti his fruit was
sweet to my taste.
The wondering -world inquires to know,
How I should love my Jesus so:
"'Vhat! are his charms say they, above
The object of a mortal love ?''
Yes; my beloved to my sight
Shows a sweet mixture, red and white ;
All human beauties-all divine-
In my beloved meet and shine.
White is his soul, from blemish free ;
Red, with the blood he shed for me !
The fairest of ten thousand fall-s ;
A sun amongst ten thousand stars!
His head the finest gold excels;
Tllfl'e wisdom in perfection dwells;
Ani glory, Hkr. a crown, adorns
Those temples once beset with thorns~
Compassions in his heart are found,
liard by the signals of his wound;
His sacred side no more shall bear
The truel scourge, the piercing spear,
llis ltands are fairer to behold
'fhan di:unon(ls s~t in rings of gold ;
'rhof'e hc.a cnly hancls that on the tree
~rere nail'c , aml torn, and bled for me!
Though once he bow'd his feeble knees,
Loaded with sins and agonies;
Now on the throne ofhis command,
His legs like marble pillars stand.
His eyes arc majesty and love,
The eagle, tempen~d with the dove;
No more shall trickling sorrows roll,
Tlarough those dear windows of his soul !
His mouth, that pourcrl out long complaint€,
Now smiles, and cheers its fainting saiuts:
His couutcnance more graceful is
~l'han Lebanon, with all its trees.
A11 oyer glorious is my Lord ;
l\lust tJc belov'd, and yet a<lor'd:
His worth if all the natlons knr.w,
Swre the whole earth would love him too!
O, rny friends ! I wish that my beloved
may be your beloved, and then ''re shall en-

ADDRESS.
N O\V ye children of men, botuul to ap-
pear befo1·e the bar of God, I have come be-
fore the presence of God ; he heareth n1y
"\Yords, he ]rnoweth n1y thoughts, and he
kno\veth your hearts, and searcheth all our
hearts. I \vill call on you that kno'v the
Lord, first of all, you that love his name, you
that are his people. I, even I, who atu a
babe, I, even I, 'vill speak unto you that
you may say, " great and marvelous are
thy works, Lord God Ahnighty !" Do not
do as I have done, but serve God. I have
earnestly inquired of him 'vhy he doth unto
me as he hath not to the rest of tbe 'vor1d,
but I desit·e to acquiesce in his \Vill, and not
murmur 'vhen his baud lieth heavy upon meo
I beseech yon, 0 you my frietl<ls 'vho kno'\'
his name, as holcl \Vitnes~es to stand up fop
the IJord Jcsns Christ. 1le not discotu·ag~d,
my ~ricnds, if you 1neet \vith tt·ia.ls and clis-
couragetncnts. \Vhen ~ ou are rcad~r to des-
pond, consider that the Lorll \Vill deliver

.\vere.pre.serveu in the ilnmcs of the fnrnace,
anu ca.nle out safe frolu the fire, when thejr
accusers \vere cast into it and consumed. So,
also, lVC read of Daniel ; he \Yas tbro"·n in-
to the den of lions, and \Vould have been con-
sum~d, but uo doubt, Daniel lifted up his sou1
to God, and the lions' n1outh~ 'vere stop-
ped, and they hurt not the man of 6otl. Can
. you, thc1·efore, 0 can you, tlaerefore, think
the Lord,- ~vheu you are triecl, ~uul \Vheu af-
fliction cometh on you, ·will fot·sake l1is dear
~bildt~en, and leave them to the }>Ower of
their enemies? You ought to consider that
these things come frotn the hand of your hea-
venly father. The apostles an<.\ prol_)h.ets
went under chains and grievous tl'ials, atHl
suffered the loss of all things gladly for the
Lorcl Jesus, and 've complain. \Vc do not
do as 'Ne ought to (lo oftentin1es ; 'yc ar~e apt

or lllCH because it is the will of Go(l, .my
l.Jcavenly Father; .if it 'vere possilJlc for 1ne
to a\ oid the flealing of God I \Vould do it;
it is mol'ti(yiug to 1ny nniural pride. 1Vbcn I
pray unto my Father, tl'nly· 1nany a time a
teat· roHcth down my check, and I often say,
ln)TFnthcr 'vhy <lost thou deal thus 'vitb me?
think not that I ~uu about to deceive you,
for I run not spcaking unto you .of the things
of this "'orld, hut of a bet.tcr 'rorld. I ther~
fore h 1
SCC<'h those that ]oye our Lord, not to
h·u t iu themsclYcs, hut 1·ather trust in the
livinc·· God, knowiug t·hat the carnal heart is
not subject to the law of God, neither, in-
ilcctl, can be; that the natural man receiv-

•
;2iS ·
e.th not the things of t11e spirit of God ; t11ey
are foolishness unto him, neither can he kno\v
thcnl, because th~y are spiritua~ly uiscerued.
Question. By \V hat auth~rity do Y<?U tn·e-
. sun1e to"address nten?
. A. 1\tly deal· friend, by 'vhat autl1ority do
_ I speak unto you ? I do uot speak ofn1y au-
thority, but as the Lord speaketl1 ; and so
I told you before, and lvhat, methinks, the
Lor(l hath told you before in his ·word. Be-
hold, ~aith God, I will pour out my spirit
upon 11 flesh,· and your so11s and your
daughters shall prophesy, and your young
Jnen shall see. visions, an<l your old men
shall drecun drea1ns, anrl on my. servants anq
011 IllY· handmtJids I ·wiH·pour out in the last
1lays of my spil'it, and they shall prophesy.
'.rhe day deaweth nigh 'vben be that shall
con1e will co1ne, au<l will not tarry. If your
eyes, 1ny friends, do not see this day before
they are closed in death, yet, when your bo-
.dies shall rest in the grave, then you " ·ill fin(l
thnt I did not tell you vain things; and l1atl1
not the Lord said that he 'vould choose the
'veak things to confound the things \Vllich are
mighty? and ·" ·hat the Lord God rcvealeth
that I will speak. I do not desire to de~
..
to say tl1at I am perfect because I speak un-
to you. I tell you now, as I told you before,
I am un(ler the han(l of the Lortl, and I can-
not help it. .
No\v, n1y friends, he you satisfied; but if
you are not satisfied, tl~re is a day con1ing
'vhen you 'viii be satisfied ; you 'vill rrot then
ask "v.
hy the I.Jord hath chosen to use such a
• •
poor feeble 'vorm as I am to declare his truth.
Let me, then, turn to tl1e time th!lt I 'vas
speaking of, when the saints should d'vell
w~th Christ a thousand years, when his
kingdom will come.
Question. Will tlte Lord edify, by l1is
speaking, U1ose ·who do not believe his "\Vord?
A. Truly he will not edify except they
11ear; hut the Lord "\Vill call evety man into
judg,men.t; but if I speak not the trut11, be-
lieve me not. I desire to speak nothing bnt
the truth of Gocl, 'vhether it edify or not·I
cannot te11, but you 'vill have to give an ac-
count of 'vhat he hath told yon, and what ye
l1ave heard.
•
N o,v, my friends, think not that tl1e Lord
will edify a carnal 1uinded man ; I tell you
he 'vill not ; I trust he 'vill edify those who
will hear. I, being a babe, do speak to
them a fe,y ,,rords.
..
·o ! yc that ha"'·e belie.ve<l upon the Lor<.l
.Jesus Christ! rejoice, for your redemption
dra\Veth nigh : yea, it is nearer than \Vhen
you first believed on him; it dravreih nigh.
\\rhcn the an1bassaclors labour for your good,
l1earken to them ; attend to \Vhat they tell
you, for they sl1o'v unto you the 'vay of eter-
nal life. I leave you in the hands of the liv-
ing God, and turn my attention to poor sin-
ners.
Qnestiou. Do you not violate that com-
Uland ot" the apostle, .'' Suffer not a 'von1an
to s1wak in the church," \vhcn you presume
thus to address sinners in the nan1c of the
J~ord?
A. .1\fy dear f~iends ! shall I-0, shall I,
t1i'en, hold 1nv peace? the apostle saith, let
not a '\-'omnn stand up in the church as a pub-
lic tcachct· : but are you hard of believing?
ar~ yon l1ard or understanuing? I have tohl
you that I cannot avoid doing these things :
nty f-tod kno,vcLh \Yhat they mean. I do not
· pretend to teach men ; but I only tell them
of tl1cir dan0cr, n.qd tell them that there is
\YO to thmn that are at ease in Zion. God
forbid tbn.t I shonltl be silent : I p1·ete!ld to
S!leak uot!Jin; but the truth, as it is in Christ
God. 13ut though you may tl1ink these are
ha.rd·sayings, yet I do testify, tbat unless yoq
be \vashed in this iountain, you cannot see
the kiugdoin of God ; fur no unclean thing
"'ill ever enter there: only .. those that have
ltad an application of the blood of Christ,
'vhich clcanseth froJn all sin. Oome ye!
cotne ye! anti buy \Vine and ·wilk, \vithout
money and \Vithout price ; come, and bow
before the lnost high God: trust him 'vho is a
gracious Redeetner, and accept his salvation.
O, fricn(ls ! it \Vill be \Vell if you trust in hirp.
\vho trotl ihe 'vine- p1·ess alone; \vho died
without the gates of Jerusalem, for the sins
of the "'orltl.
Oh ! love divine, what hast thou done? .
The I.ord of glory died for me;
~rhc Father's co-eternal Son
Bore all my sins upon tl1e tree.
BL\hol<l, he is seateu otl a throne of Jncrcy,
rnaking intcrc('Ssion for sinner~. Is he not
:;aying, "0, Father! spare them a little
longer, ull I dig about them a little longer?
Is he uot standing 'vith outstretched bands,
and saying, " Cotne unto me, ·anti learn of
1ne ; for I am meek_, and low1y ofheart, and
•
.
Jesus my Lor<l. ~hall a "'oman holfl her
peace, because she is a "'oman ? ~Iethinks
the apostle 1neant not so ; but Jneant that they
shouhllct their light shine before n1en. I~ it
a n1yslery to y<Ju 1ny friend~? let it not be a
1nystery any longer, but rather leavc il in tho
bands of the living Gou; l1e 'vill do 'vhat is
best and right. Let me, therefore, turn ruy
attention to sinners.
Perhaps there are sou1e in the hearing of
my voice, 'Yho have not yet directed their
views to the Saviour. I perceive they stand
on a precipice, .In a slippery place, ready to
fall, Hand fiery billo,11
lS roll below.'' 0 ! can
you rest any longer in tl1e situation in '\Yhich
you are, exposed every mo1nent to be cast off
\vithout any mercy! But turn unto the Lord,
'vho 'vill have Ine.rcy, and to our f~od,
\vho ,,~in abundantly pardon. ~lay you,
therefore, turn, and consider, that it may be
've1l for you 'vhen thne shall be no 1norc!
\-\Tho is there a1nong you that can bear the
hlca. of1ying dov"n in the place of tor1nent
for eYer nnd e\·er? Antl I do testify, 1hat
except ~·e lJ~ ,,,·ashed in this fountain, 'vhich
is open for Judah, and the inhabitants of Je...
r U:!aleJn;o you cannot enter into the glory of
2~~JJ
ye shall fitHlrest to your 'souls : Take 1ny
yoke upon you ; for 1ny·yoke i~ easy autl1uy
btu·tle.n is light." May you, therefore, re-
pent and be converte(r, that your sins may be.
forgiven you·; that your nn.tne llHt y be \Vrit-.
ten in the Latnb's book oflife, anti have rigl~t ·
to eait of the tree of life, 'v.hieh shtndeth in
the midst of the paradise of God.
Truly, it is my duty to pray to him t-hat
made the heavens and the earth ; for be 'vill
:hear a babe.
Come sound his praise abroad,
And h) mns of t)o1·y sing ;
Jehovah is the sovereign God,
The universal king.
He form'd the deeps unknown,
He gave the _seas their bound ;
The watery worlds are all his ow~,
And all the solid ground.
Come wol'Bhip at his tluone ;
Come bow before the Lord:
\
We are his works, and not our o"'ln ;
He form'd us by his word.
To-day attend his voice,
Nor dare provoke his rod ;
Come, like the people of his choic~,
_

ADDRESS.
T O\V: 0 yc, 1ny beloved brethren and sis...
1ers, I hnxe co1ue into yotu· presence; I '\YiH
~30
noi; cease to spenk of those, things tha.t you
may be enconragetl, and 1na.y not be 'venry
of 'Yalking in the 'vays of the Lord. Truly,
.[ an1 lc s than the least.. and am not worthy
,
to call you hrethrcn, but I will endeavour to
exhort you, inasnuLeh as the (lay approachcth.
Doth not iniquity abound, and the loYe of
many 'vax cold? J\;Iany turn back, and
t\ralk no more lvith Jesus, as those did in
the days of his flesh. But, n1y friends, I
tl:ust it is 'vith you as it 'vas 'vith Peter, and
that you say \Vith hin1, "Whither shall we
go? Thou bast the 'vord of eternal life,
and we believe, and are sure, that tholl art
Christ, the Son of the living God." May
you rather follow the Lamb of God \Vhith-
ersoevcr he goeth. Truly the christian life
is a life of continual warfare. Now 1nay
you be l\:illing to follo\v him through evil
report an(l gootl report, for he is a goo(l
Shephenl, that \Vill guide his sheep in gootl
pastures, fresh antl green ; he 'vill guat·<l
thetn, and carry the la1nbs iu his artns, and
gently lcttd those that are 'vitb young. Be-
hold! he speaketh ViOl ds of consolation an<l
\Vor<ls of co1nfort to them : he saith unto
,
lhen1, for his Apostle. hath said this is a true
~a~
betore Jesus con1es and makes his appear..
ance ; but blessed are they that a1·e found
'vaiting, they 'vill have a seat at his right
hand ; they that are \Vashecl clean in the blood
of the everlasting Son of God. They are
blessed and happy, says John, in the Revela-
tion, tl1at keep the \Vot·<ls of this book, wor..
ship God, and worship him in spirit, with a
pure heart ; for they that worship God must
worship him in spirit and in truth. Think
not that an outward profession will suffice ;
for truly, the \Vords of our Lord confirm
what my words are to you, Truly, saicl our
Lord to Nicodemus, except a man be born
again he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus vvas blind, and asked, how can
these things be ? But our Lord opened his
eyes, and he then perceived that it 'vas an
important thing to have the heart changed,
and to be made a new creature. No,v, sin..
ners, come and say, 0 Lord, I am a poor,
blind, '\Yeak creature. Co1ne not before the
Lord in your o'vn righteousness, for they ate
,j,lthy rags.
[Here it was asked by one of the company,
Ifit 'vere possible for one 'vho had been re-
newed by the spirit o.f Christ, a11d made a
ue\V creature, ever to fall a\vay, and finally
peri~h ~]
l\Icthiuks there is no one that ever had one
spark of divine grace, that \Vill ever fall
a\vay and perish; for hath notour God .Po\vcr
to keep l1im? Hath he not more power than
the devil? and hath he not engaged to keep
bis people, an{l to save all that come unto
him ? truly they that have the oil of grace in
thcit· hea1·ts : his spidt 'vill keep his elect, for
he is able to keep them.
0 ! fdends, there are son1e that are foolish
virgins ; there are tnany 'vho make a false
profession ; \ve ought, therefore, to ask our-
selves if \\re are indeed placing our confi..
dcnce in him who is the only rock of safety,
and \vhetber ·we do indeed believe in him, for
I atn sure that they that are foun<led -on
Christ Jesus can never be 1noved ; for they
are like tnount Zion, which cannot be mo-
,~ed :
Should storms of thund'ring veljgeance rolJ,
And shake the globe from pole to pole,
No flaming bolt shall daunt my face,
For Jcsus is my hiding place.
A few more rolling sw1s, at most,
Will land me safe on Canaan·~ coast.
Where I shall sin~ the song of grace.
And sec my glorious hiding place.
The ar1n of Jesus is suffiicicnt to save tltem
f1·om the very ja,vs of hell! \Vill not our
Gotl o'vn and bless those who have luul an
application of the blood of Christ ? On11.· }"a-
ther will say these are "'orthy to be receiverl
jnto his housr, and they \vill sit do\vn \\'Hh
...'\..braham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdon1
of (:.to<l. Are ··we all christians ? We 1n·ofess
to be ;-it is no s1nall 1natte1· to haye the
grace of God, antl to be indeed a christian.
I speak these tbings1Unto you, my friends,
desiring that you 1nay search diligently, if
you have the oil of love in your hearts ; for
l1e that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
(:Jo<l in him, for God is love. And if ·we
l1ave this loye, we shall pray for all men,
even for our enemies ; although they perse-
cute us, ~,e can pray for tl1e.n1 ; even as J e-
sns praye<l for his persecutors, and said, on
the eross, "Ft'.ther, forgive them ! they
kno\V not ·what they do.~' .A.ntl what love,
then~ ~hall w·e have to our brethren ! Tru-
Jy, it \vill cause the ·wQrld to say, ':What
nncl it is a tnystery to many. Art thou speak..

advantage of education: I a1n but a poor ig-

elh to be so hard to understand ; yet it is easy
'vith h1nt to aecomplish his 'vill by the ''T
eak-
est instruJnents. I am bo,vc<l down all the
day long, and a1n ready to say that the bm·-
den of the Lord is too heavy ; and oftentimes
I pray that he would cut my life short ; but,
trul~r, if I conld feelt·econcilecl as I do now
to his (tealings with me ; if it were at all
tintcs 'vith nte as it is now I a1n speaking
unto you, I should be still, aud kuo\v that

self, at times, and 1n foutul 1nourning and

Q. llachcl, what is the marriage supper of
tbc lamb?
A. ~Iy dear friends, shall-I say that if any
one is born of God be is married unlo (1hrist;
beholcl, we that have experienced religion,
and have true genuine faith, are n1arried unto
Christ; we shall be the bride, the Latub·ill
'vife, in that day whenl•e makcth np his jew·-
els, and he \vill spare his 1)eople, even as a
man spareth his own son, that se1·vcth hiJn;
truly, when \Ve experience the grace of Go<l
in our hearts, we arc 1nar1·icd unto Christ.
But, ren1ember, we shall come into his pre-
sence 'vhen 've forsake this clay ; it is fool-
ishness fot' any who have not ha.d theit heart
change<l : they cannot understand 'Yhat this
change 1neans, an(l whal it is thus to be Inar-
rie<l to Christ. It is not in the po\ver of ma.n
to change the heart : no, it is not :flesh and
blood that shall ever clutnge the heart of any
crealut·c. lie 'vho livetfl on uigh, 'vbo cre-
ated the heavens and the enrth, 'vho ordain-
ed them, and set thcn1 in their proper order ;
that self san1e beirg chaugeth the hearts (!(
the childr·cn of men, and n1arrieth them unto
Christ. You cannot mart·y yourself unto
Christ ; anti no man can truly change his
own heart, for it is truly impossible to merit
salvation of hin1self; therefore, if the Lord
do not change our hearts, \Ve shall not be
able to enter into the marriage supper. If I
"'ere able to buy a garment that 'vould never
wcn.r out, it ·would not fit me to enter in : no,
Christ must, himself, furnish the wedding
garment. I 'vould to God that you \Vere all
changed; and if not, you cannot in any wise
lJe. "'orlhy to enter in \vith him. Here Dro
{'1..4eo(l asked-
Q. \Vhcre shaH we find tl1is marriage
supper?
.A.. 'rt·uly I, even I, think that the gospel
of onr God is part of it; 've do not possess
the fnll amount of this till \Ve arrive in heav-
en. l\1y fricn(ls, hehol<l, the body ancl the
l,lootl of Christ, truly, is the feast that \Ve
- Jnust feast upon. Do \Ve that are professors
of the I.Ac
uuJ,, kno'v 'vhat this feast 1neans ?
'Vc do tl'nly I>:trtake of the natu1~a1 bread,
the etublent of the l)ody of Christ ; \Ve do
truly pal'take of the 'vine, the sign of the
bloo(l of Christ; tuul our SaYiour saitl, as
:248
oft as he eat of this bread: and drink of this
cup, do it in ren1e1nbrancc of 1ne. But l'C-
metnber, if \ve are of this lHtppy number, \re
shall drink ofthis cup that shall never fail us,
've shall eat of this bread, that 've shall never
hunger; then 'vill tl1e supper be co1npleted;
tlaen will we d'vcll ·with our beloved for ev-
~r and ever. •
Behold, 've that do profess to love the
Lord .Jesus, can sit under the droppings of
the sanctuat·y, and eat of the bt'cau, ancl drink:
of the cup, in remembrance of hian ! .A.nd
it is our song and our delight, thus to sit un-

his fruit is sweet to our taste, and we sit

Jlere Dr. ~{'Leod askcd-
Q. Hovv is a person n1arJ·icd to Christ.?
A. Have I not told you, that they are n1ar..
ried when they haYe their hearts change<l :
they are become his friends, and so as one
wl1o is his companion: the.v are united to him
in love, ancl seek not to be unmarried. }"or
Jesus Christ, the son of God, it was l1e 'vho

I 1vill quietly wnit till they address the ~lost

me to declare and then I will hear the1n. .Be
not \\-·eary, for I ·will not speak any thing
thatwill be injurious : Hear me with patience,
for it is the will of God that I should speak
unto you. Enter into your closets and pray
unto your Father, \Yho seeth in secret; and do

Answer. When I l1ave exl1

and have prayed to my Go(l, then will! hear
t11e ambassadors with patience, and \vill be
much edified in hearing then} : For my Go(l
hath made me to do so much ; for of tnyself

incline you to run after him, and inquire \Vhat
you ~hall do, in the days of your youth.
N O\V, unite with me in prayer to him that
dwelleth on high; for, truly, this "\\·ork the
L01·d hatlt required of me. I, even I, must
retuler up an account how I spend my life in

A. 1\'fy <lear friend, bast thou askeel me
if there can be any salvation 'vitl1out elec-

there \vill be no salvation 'vithout the slJed-
ding ofhloo<l; and Christ hath shed his o'vn
blood to atone for sin; and behold ye, nty
friends, he offered salvation unto all men, and
they ~hat hear the voice of God, an(l come
and helieve in Christ, they shall be saved. ·
Let me not say the Lord hath chosen to
l,e hi~ chil(lren the;;)e or those, and hath left
the -ec~t to perish; I should lie, speaking for
truth 1vhn.t I kutnv not; for I have not the

Yea, it is, and they cannot do evil, for his

must keep his comn1andments. If I had an
eye like him, I could show you \\'ho they at·e,
and if I had his unc.lerstandin~ I could tell
you the reason \Vhy some of the human race
are saved, and some arc left under sin to go
do·wn to the pit. It is foolish, 0 friends, for
the children ofmen to attempt to discover the
secrets of the Almighty ; therefore, for you
that have heard his gospel, I "·oulil, say,
tlo not puzzel your minds and torment your
hearts to find out who are of the chosen, and
who are not. But of all things strive to know
whether ye be in the faith ; for he offers sal-
vation to all. "Whosoever \vill, let him
come." I exhort you, then to come and be-
lieve in l1is name ; for all that believe are
saved, and these are the elected ones ; but
them that do not believe do shut themselves

.A.nd, O, friends ! it is l1is blood thai ,,·ash..

you of the jailor? He 'vas appointed to keep
the apostles ; but an angel of the Lo1·<l came,
and shooh. off theit~ fetters, and openctl the
pt~isou gates ; so that they l1ad an opportuni-
ty of escaping, and he supposed they 'verc
gone. He 'Yas goin~ to kill himself; but
Paul cried to hitn not to hurt hitnself. It
'vas then l1e got a vie'v of his sins ; au(l he
fell <lown at theit· feet, and inquieed \vhat he
should clo to be saved. The servant of the
J..orcl clirectetl him to nothing else but only,
'~ ]Jelicvc in the Lord Jesus, au!l thou shalt
be sa\·cd ;" ana he arose, and 'vas baptized
imtne.diate1y.
NO\V, if you ·will con1e into the situation of
the jailor, an<l the poor publican, you shall
he seceivcd in like manner ; for the Lord
l1ath said, he 'vill bin(l up the broken heart-

dro~-nerl. l\fy friends, was it not the hand
of the Lord? yea~ every one must confess it
"'as the hand of the Lord. And \Vho di<l de~
liver the apostles ? it was the hand of the
Lord that loosed thcit~ chains, an(l opened the
prison like thunder. And O, my friends.,
wl1at think you of Daniel? He '-Vas cast into
the lion's den, but they did him no hartn.
Although he was cast into their den, tl1c
Lord stopped the n1outh of the lion. Daniel
prayed constantly to the Lord, and be saved
him. 'Vas not this the hand of the Lor<l ?
yea, every one must confess that this "·as tbe
han(l of the Lord. And again, 0 ye, n1y
ft·iends ; you remetnber the three c,hildren ;
they 'vere cast into the burning furnace, but
they 'vcre not hurt : And, behold, four men
'vere seen \\ralking in the n1idst of the fur-
nace, :nHl the fourth "·as like the Son of
Gou. Yea, my friends., it was the Lord that
·preserved then1 all, and shall we be "'eak in
the faith? shall ""c doubt tl1at he can ln·e-
serve us? God forbid. He is the sa1ne now
as he 'vas then, and has he not, anu does
he not (lo greater tl1ings no\v than these? Is
not this greater, to pardon the iniquities of
the chilclt·en of Jnen ? Do I speak rasl1ly ?

ls it not so ? 'It is like raising one from the
dca(l ; foe llehold, 've are dead in trespas-
ses,. and it is his to raise us up, and makt\
us live in newness of life.
And yon, 'vho have not been rai!§ed, I have
tl'aly brought these things to your minds, that
you mlght not think light of them. Although
the Lot·d doth not do great works, yet is not
this a great thing to quicken those dead in
sin? I \vould that salvation 'vould come
out of Israel, atHl you may all be partakers
of it. }\lfy friends, I pt~ay that you n1ay be
led out hy the still \Vaters, au<l n1~y dweB in
peace. And pray reJnetnber me. I am a w·eak, ,
frail creature, hnrdcnec.l 'vith sin ; and pray
fur n1e. An<l 0_, sinners, I beseech you
"\vould not rest any longer in sins ; bnt con1e
unto the Lord, that he 1nay have mercy upon
you. Reme1nber you 1nust stand befo1·e the
l)ar of God, as 'veil as I must; and without
the righteousness of Christ, we cannot stand
tl1at tt·ial. I do, therefore,-lea·ve you in the
l1and of God. I leave you in his hand, when
I call upon hitn; and unite in prayer to God,

"\Yonldst be rcconciletl to me in thy dear Son.

thee to be reconciled to me, a poor Ull\vorthy
\Vorm of the dust, a child that is not worthy

hcen given to Yanity ; I have not 'valked Le.

l>een like a child that has been disobedient,
and deserves to be bcat~n \\·ith many stripes.
lle thou, then, reconciled unto me, for tl1y
dear Son's sake ; for I perceive that all I
ever did is vain, and all I ever can do 1nust
be vain to merit thy favour; there is no-
thing that can be rjght and Rcceptable but

Q. Rachel, here are a number of the
Friends come to see you_., have you any thing
to say to tltcm ?
A. My .dear frteads, I do rejoice to say
much unto them that are friends to me and to
my Saviour, Jesus Ohrist, if indeed they be
friends to my S'!viour. 0 frtends ! are you
come up to hear ~::hat a poor unwortl:y worm
of the dust h:ts tu say for the name of my
Lord Jesus Christ? though I am truly _
but a
worm yet it is my duty to be faitbful, for I
am in his l1and, I do therefore speak plainly
unto you ; I do inquire, are you his children ?
. ifyou love hhn in sincerity I will not cease to
O\Vn you as my friends. Yea~ I will beseech you
not to fear, but to be very confident, knowing
that he 'vill keep you ; for he is able to keep
all that put their confidence on him. Can
yoll truly say that J csus is preeiftus to you,
the chief among ten thousand, and one alto-
getbet.. lovely? is your God my God, nty Fa.
tl1er your Father, n1y Saviour your Saviour?
and are my people your people ? If so, I trust
that you \'V ill rejoice 'Yith llle both here anu
in the fait' heayens above : and I knolv that
you 'vill if you are friends of Jesus. I u·Hl
not be found speaking any thing sa,·ing the
truth in Christ Jesus my Lord. If I speak
not accordingto the truth, believe n1e uot ; for
l\YO be unto me if I say any thing but the truth,
and this is the truth. 0 friends ! if you are
alienated from the covenant of pron1ise you
n.re strangers and outcasts, lw.ving no soli(l
foun(lation of hope, and are Lound to ever-
lasting wo ! It is of the greatest importance
{o inquire if you are of the truth or no ; for
it profiteth nothing to have an outward pro-
fession of the name of Christ, while the heart
is full of,all manner of abominations and
''~ickedness : for our Saviour said, wo unto
you if you make clean the outside of the-cup
and Illatter 'vhile the in,vard part is filled lvith
filth and na~Hness that h?.th not been cleansed
a\\~a.y: 'vo unto you if you have uot been

thus it behooveth n1e to fulfil all righteousness•
.Tesns \Yas baptized to fulfil all righteousness,
and cud the la'\V; and truly Jesus 'vas bap-
tized in the riyer Jordan, and cotning out of
the \Yater, the spirit catnc in the shape of a

taken away by the spirit into the 'vilderness

setting him on the pinnacle of the temple
saith unto him, if thou be the Son of Gotl
cast thyself do\vn, for it is written, he shall
give his angels charge concerning tl1ee lea t

When he was dead, they broke not a bone

Ne\•J-York 6th, May, 1815.
GENTLEMEN,
From a principle ofjustice, and a love of truth, I ex-
press my opinion ofthe cnse of RAcHEL BAKER, which
I consider as belonging to a class of moral pltenomen:1
so numerous, and carrying on its face such marks (l~
29~
germi11~ sjm}llicity, that I am compelled to aJmit the
reality of its existence,
'l,ruc it i~, that every s-ubstance has its shadow, ant~
that upon every subject which is pn·scnted to the obo
sen·ation af man there is the appca,·ance distinct from
the reality oftruth, 1·equil'ing the most acute and patienr.
in\·estigation to discriminate between them. This is
proven by the various and contradictory systems formed
by learned and able men, from what appeared to them
accurate observations of natural pllenomena; and like·
·wise by their differences of opinion as to the fact~ of
the appearances themselves, Equally true it is, thal,
supe1·added to this fruitful source of invohmta1:1J error,
the depravity of human nature produces counterfeits of
almost every good thing, from motives almm;;t as various
as the shapes they assume. But, what then ? must.lH\
for fear of deception, reject all appearances : condemn
every thing extraordinary, upon slight examination: or
cease to investigate ? Or shall we not, rather, redouble
our industry and circumspection, keeping our judg-
ments alike unbiassed by sanguine predilection and•
seeptica1 prejudice? remembe1·ing, that the best estab-
fishea facts, and least questionable systems, have be-
comr such only by the concurrence of numerous obser_
vations; sometimes the effect of accident, sometimes of
patient jnvestigation ; and that very many of these
things which we admit to be facts, are so admitted, not
because we cau ac~ount for, or even unde1·stand them,
but merely that, being common, tltey ltave become
JmmLwr.
I -wt.s amc:.gst th'le~ ,,.tro, from repr~entations pre;
~95
•iuusly made of hel', were unfavoarahly impressed as
to the moth·es, or sincerity, of Miss Rachel Baker.
But, the suhject being neither new nor astonishing to
ntc, I determined to investigate this particular case, as
I ho.d done others, as free from prejudice as possible,
and to judge for myself. I saw he1· three times; once
in her serious waking moments, and twice in he1· preter-
natural state of sonmium ; and had thence a good op~
llortunity of estimating the comparative aculencss and
readiness of her faculties in ~hose different. states; a test
which I deemed of no slight importance; e5pccially as,
in her wakiug state, by attacking her peculiar tenets in
religion, I purposely prov{)];.eu her to defend them,
with a~ much earnestness a~ her diffidence would per..
mit. ncsides which, I m::<~e inquh·ies of those best
acquaintr.d wi1h hPr~ rP.::;per,Un:; her tf1mper, d~spo~ilionj
and hahits; her means of religions in€f:ructiun, &c. !md
the character of her parents; of wh!ch partic.uhll's I
received inform~tion, ,,llich agrfcs with the detailed
narra.Cves of c:redltable and respectable persons which
I havf• seen, and wl1idJ I undcrst~.nd are to make a
p<nt of your pubHcc: tion upon her cas<.'. '.rhe result
of this joquiry and invct.dgatio!l> in my mind, was briefly
thj · : That all thrzt Rachel expresses in Iter state of
somn:lojaism, is the result of p1·ec()nccivcd ideas and
1.piuions, but deliuerei with a readiness and a fluency
1!·hich is ucry fa:r u.bove her 1
1Vaking state; that in lhe
I
''hole of he: nightly exercisP, there is an earnestness '
antl a wal'mth, not easily counterfeited ; that wl1en
awake, she has an unaffected Tepugnance to these exhi~
bitions~ of which her friends inform her, bnt of which
296
she has ao recollection, and a rcnl diffidence, bot.b of her
informatiou and her abilities to display il. '.ro this I
might add, what I believe to be fact, because informe4
ofit by the friends around her, whose characters, and
disinterested generosity to hn·, put them above su~piw
cion, but what I should have laid no stress upon, if it
had stood alone ; that the last night that I beard bel'
prayer and exho!'tation, she bad no knowledge that
a~y person whatever would be present; and th~t she
constantly had the same exercises, ·whether strange1·s
attended or not.
So much as to th:is particular case. But as to the
class to which it belongs, tl1ere are so many, and they
are so well authenticated1 that, at no distant time, it 'vill
probably be deemed a less proof of weakness and cre-
dulity to admit thom a~ they stand, than to J•eceive the
whimsical and contradictory attempts of sceptical in·
credulity to explain them away, or to resolve them
into siuistel' and unworthy motives. ·
