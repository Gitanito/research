  Experience description: &nbsp;

Most nights I fall   asleep very rapidly, considering that I dealt with my grief by staying busy. But   this night was different I had a hard staying asleep. I would doze off and wake   right back up, over and over again. I was getting rather irritated about it and   was contemplating on taking something to make me got to sleep (Nyquil, Tylenol   PM, etc). When I relaxed and decided to give one more shot (I hate taking   medicine).

The next   time I dozed off I felt like I woke right back up again, but when I opened my   eyes I was no longer in my bed. I was standing in a huge open field, full green   grass, wild flowers of assorted colors and the tree line was about half a mile   in all directions. Miranda was standing about 6 feet away from me, wasn't saying   anything at first. We just stood there and looked at each other.

I noticed   the clothes she was wearing, I assumed if I ever saw her again( dreams or   whatever), I would see either the clothes she was wearing in the accident or   what we buried her in. But I was wrong, she was wearing a gown of light, no   seamstress marks, no thread of any kind. Just a white, brightly glowing gown,   looked kinda like a cloud. It had straps that covered about 2 1/2 inches of her   shoulders. Everything else was visible. It had a light blue haze around it, like   an aura.

I moved my   eyes up and noticed her face, when she was a teenager she had a problem with   acne and chicken pox. They in time had left some scars and blemishes. With make   up could be covered up to wear if you didn't know they were there you wouldn't   see them.&nbsp; But she had no make up on and her complexion was perfect. No   scars or anything, reminded me of a newborn's skin, completely flawless. I   always stated that my wedding pictures was the best I had ever seen her. What I   was looking at didn't hold a candle to what I see in those pictures. She was   exceeding my expectations of what an angel should look like.

But   reality finally caught up with me and I spoke. I told her but your... She threw   up her hand to stop me. She said, &quot;don't say it because it isn't true.&quot; Your   about say &quot;But you're dead&quot;. And it isn't true. Yeah, the body I traveled   through life is gone but that isn't me. I'm just as alive as you are, I'm just   somewhere else.

But I'm   not here to talk to you about this. I'm here to talk to you about, you. I   replied, well what about me? She said, well you have a lot of pain in heart and   in your mind that you have got to let go of. I asked her what pain she referring   to? Well you're wondering about pain and suffering I went through. I said well   yes, I can't help it. It was about 2 hours from the time of the accident until   the time you passed. And when you did I was standing right there in front of   you. I saw the life leave your body. She said don't worry anymore, I felt   nothing.&nbsp; Upon the first impact ( her car collided with 2 trees), the lord   took me from my body so I didn't feel any pain whatsoever. My body was still   alive but I was no longer there. I knew there was a reason for him taking me   like this so I didn't fight it. I just kinda went along with the flow.&nbsp;   When they finally let you in to see me, when the med-evac arrived, I was at your   side the whole time. When you leaned over and told me that everything was going   to be fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;I heard you say, I love you and watched you kiss my forehead.   I knew it was time to let my body go. But always remember that I was beside, you   not laying on that table. In protest, I said when I spoke, you seemed like you   were looking for me. She said, that was my body recognizing your voice and   responding. But you noticed that I never fixated on you. Because I wasn't in   there to focus.

I asked   her if that was all she had to tell me? She said, no there was so much more I   needed to know. I asked well what else?

She   mentioned the autopsy.&nbsp; You are holding a lot of guilt for releasing my   body for it. I said,&nbsp; well of course I do, you had been through a car   accident suffered for 2 hours, finally let go and now they want to cut on you   like a piece of meat. Have you not been through enough. Why can't they just let   it go?

She said,   quit thinking of it like that. I don't know what they did, don't want to know   what they did, and didn't care to know. Because I wasn't there.&nbsp; When this   was going on, I was with you and the kids in Huntsville( my daughter had a   compressed skull fracture, bone was lodged in her brain. She recovered with   miraculous speed).

She said,   you knew I was there because you looked for me. And it dawned on me there were a   few instances when the doctors would come into her ICU room if I had my back to   them, they would walk up behind me tap my shoulder and take me out of the room   to talk. They had to keep my daughter sedated to where she didn't know her   surroundings, but not too far, because her lungs may not take the oxygen   anymore. So I was forbidden to talk in her room. Thinking she may hear and   recognize my voice and try to wake up. But there were many times I know I felt   someone come into the room and would wait on the tap. But it never happened and   when I turned around to see what they were doing, there was no one there. I just   chalked it up to my imagination running wild under all the stress, and didn't   give it another thought. But she explained that, that was her. Coming to check   on the baby herself.

I asked   her if she had any regrets, or was she sad about having to leave like this? She   said that I will see in due time. That when the lord takes you from your earthly   body, all the negative emotions, anger, sadness, hurt confusion etc. will stay   in your body. All your going to bring with you is the positive emotions Love,   peace, contentment, trust etc. What everyone strives their whole life to feel.   So therefore, it's impossible for me feel like that. Where I'm at now, tears   don't exist. There is no need for them.

I said,   well, I have another question, and this part gets just a little fuzzy. I want to   say she answered before I asked the question. But I can't be sure. Anyhow my   question was, will I ever see you again? And she said make no mistake, you will   see me again. There will come a time in your life, I can't tell you when (   saying this with the expression of I know, but I can't tell you). But you will   open your eyes and I will be there waiting for you. Saying &quot;let's go, it's your   time&quot;.

I said   well, now that we have gotten all of this out and I know now what to expect.   What do we do? She said, I just want you to hold me.&nbsp; We don't have much   time left, just hold me. I knew that I was asleep this whole time and this was   more than just dream. But I needed some kind of proof. And this was my moment of   truth. I know that when you dream, you might pick something up, but you don't   feel it, only see yourself holding it. When I touched her if I couldn't tell any   detail it was my mind playing a very sick game with me. But if I could feel her,   than she was real. It was like she knew this and was giving me some kind of   confirmation.

So I   started towards her, she started towards me and when I finally touched her it   was the most marvelous thing I have ever experienced. I put my arms around her   waist and pulled her close, she wrapped her arms around my neck and laid her   head on my chest. I could feel the weight of her body leaning against mine, the   light pressure of her arms around my neck even her hair in my face tickling my   nose while I was breathing. Life has never been this real.&nbsp; And all I could   think was YES YES YES!!!!! This was real and I will see her again. I have never   felt happiness to this degree.&nbsp; NEVER!

And that   is how I woke up the next morning. I felt like the weight of the world had been   lifted off of my shoulders. I could finally smile again, and I know that   everything I do she is right there beside me.

  How long did the experience   last? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    It didn't seem that long in the   place we were at, but it was actually all night. When I awoke it was daylight   morning. I guess about 8:00 CST 
  
  Was the beginning and end of   the experience gradual or more sudden? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Beginning was gradual, I   feel that she was trying to contact me, but it kept waking me up. The end was   sudden. 
  
  Could you sense the emotions   or mood of the deceased?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes 
  
  very calm, relaxed, reassuring   love. 
  
  Did the deceased give you   information you did not previously know? &nbsp;   Yes, when she described the   fact of leaving the body. The emotions you take with you, and what leave behind.   I would have never thought of that. When she explained that she was in the room   at our daughters bedside. When she was standing at my side when she let her body   go. 
  
  How do you currently view the   reality of your experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Experience was definitely real 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please explain   why you view the reality of your experience as real or not real:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Because everything I would in   expect in this world was there. Everything! It kinda made me question the   thought of what we think reality is, could actually be a form of birth for the   soul. Kinda like a caterpillar doesn't know he going to become a butterfly, he   just lives. And then something happens and he has this sudden urge to incase   himself in cocoon. But when he immerges he has become a beautiful butterfly. I   have heard that we only use 8% of our brain power. So who knows what were   supposed to know. I know that sounds ridiculous. But its the way I see it. 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the   experience dream like in any way?&nbsp;&nbsp;    No 
  
  The only reason I call it a   dream is for lack of a better word. It was while my body was sleeping, but for   every other aspect. I was there. 
  
  Describe in detail your   feelings/emotions during the experience:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Curious, I wanted to know what was   beyond this life. And she never actually give any detail about it, except that I   would see her again and I will be in a place full of happiness and joy. 
  
  Was there any emotional   healing in any way following the experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes 
  
  I beat myself up over   everything that had happened. I was the one who taught her how to drive. I felt   so responsible for all of this. And she was explaining that it wasn't my fault,   and I had to quit accusing myself of all of this. 
  
  What was the best and worst   part of your experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Best: The reassurance that we will   be together again.

Worst:   Having to leave that paradise I know as Heaven. 
  
  Has your life changed   specifically as a result of your experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   My grief is no where what   it was the night before all of this. She has explained that everything is ok. 
  
  Did you have any changes of   attitudes or beliefs following the experience? &nbsp;&nbsp;   No 
  
  Did the experience give you   any spiritual understandings such as life, death, afterlife, God,   etc.?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes 
  
  Yes that when we die, we seem   to associate it as the end. But in reality it is actually the beginning. 
  
  Death Compacts    are when two or more living people promise among themselves that whoever dies   first will try to contact the other(s).&nbsp; Have you ever made such a   compact?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No 
  
  Did you observe or hear   anything regarding people or events during your experience that could be   verified later?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No    
  
  What emotions did you feel   during the experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Complete contentment in knowing   that she is alright and I will be joining her when it's my time to go. 
  
  Was the experience witnessed   or experienced by others?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    No 
  
  Did you have any sense of   altered space or time?&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes 
  
  It seemed to be only about an   hour, but in actuality, it was all night 
  
  Did you see a light?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Yes 
  
  The filed was illuminated by a   light similar to the sun. But I noticed there was no shadows. So that meant the   light had to come from every direction. I noticed this detail but never thought   it would mean anything significant 
  
  Have you shared this   experience with others?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes 
  
  Mixed reactions, Many wish they   could have this contact with passed loved one. And others are just amazed, one   man said I believe every word of this is true. Because I read love novels about   as much as my wife does, and have never heard of anything so touching. And there   are skeptics, I knew there would be, but it's like I told them I don't expect   everyone to believe me. But it's not what you believe, it's what I believe,   that's what has gotten me through all of this. 
  
  Have you shared this   experience formally or informally with any other researcher or web site?&nbsp;&nbsp;   No 
  
  &nbsp;Is there anything else you   would like to add regarding your experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I have also experienced a few   things kinda strange since then. For instance I went to bed the other night.   Nothing out the ordinary at all. But when I woke up I noticed that my cover had   been reversed. Where it's normally the sheet then the comforter. The comforter   was under their sheet. They were spread out to where they intentionally been put   like that. No wrinkles even on both sides of the bed, it was like she was saying   just stopped by to say hello and I love you. 
  
  Did the questions asked and   information you provided accurately and comprehensively describe your   experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes 
  
  Please offer any suggestions   you may have to improve this questionnaire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I think you have just about   covered it. Please Email me and let me know what you think about this. All parts   of this survey is welcomed to be used in any way you feel necessary. I feel it   was a gift, that she was able to contact me, I want to be able to give something   in return. thanks for listening to my experience.
