" I think you do well in publishing the Nar-

It is altogether of an extraordinary character;
and while it makes a large demand on our cre-
dulity, it can scarcely fail to awaken serious
thoughts and devout desires in the minds of all
who read it with attention. Infidelity is fear-
fully prevalent ; and the opinion that the whole

another world, should be called into requisi-

The disclosures of Miss D , contained in
the following pages, are thus made public by
the repeated and urgent request of several
valued friends. If they should excite a more
diligent attention to eternal things, the writer
will greatly rejoice, and the design of their

PREFACE TO THE TWELFTH EDITION.
Miss D -, whose disclosures have excited
considerable interest and inquiry, was not at all
imaginative ; but possessed much sobriety of
mind, and had, for some time previous to the
period of being entranced, lived according to
the Gospel of Christ. Nor did she ever vary
her statements of what she had heard and seen
in the spiritual world; for, although closely
catechized by different persons on the subject,
she invariably gave the same testimony, and a
short time before her death solemnly attested
its truth to the author, in the presence of
several witnesses.
Her attendants, to whom she first made the
disclosure, were also persons of established re-
ligious character, well known to the writer; and

PREFACE TO THE TWELFTH EDITION.
Miss D-, whose disclosures have excited
considerable interest and inquiry, Was not at all
imaginative; but possessed much sobriety of
mind, and had, for some time previous to the
period of being entranced, lived according to
the Gospel of Christ. Nor did she ever
vary
her statements of what she had heard and seen
in the spiritual world; for, although closely
catechized by different persons on the subject,
she invariably gave the same
testimony, and a
short time before her death solemnly attested
its truth to the author, in the presence of
several witnesses.
Her attendants, to whom she first made the
disclosure, were also persons of established re-
ligious character, well known to the writer; and
so far from being a
party to an
imposture, they
evinced very great reluctance to have Miss
D-'s communications made public, knowing,
as
they did, that such communications could
not but deeply affect some parties with whom
they were on terms of friendship, and whose
feelings they manifestly wished to spare. For
the same reason this small work has not ap-
peared sooner.
It is possible that some persons may feel an
educational prejudice against the disclosures of
Miss D , they having, from their infancy,
been taught to regard as superstitious all belief
in supernatural manifestations : but the preju-
dice of education, however popular and influen-
tial, is not always on the side of truth ; for it
led the Jews, in opposition to the clearest
evidence of the Messiahship of Jesus, to reject
and crucify their lowly King. Incredulity in
other persons may, probably, arise from the
influence of a philosophy which dogmatically
says, that such an event, as the following nar-
rative details, could not have taken place : but
human philosophy is not a sure guide; for it led
the Greeks to despise the preaching of the
cross, and to regard as foolishness what was
the wisdom of God. It is readily admitted
that the event involves mysteries not to be
explained by man, whatever be the culture of
his mind, or the grasp of his intellectual facul-
ties ; but if we are not to believe any thing
which we cannot comprehend, we must sink
into atheism and universal unbelief. Nor is it
improbable that other individuals may scepti-
cally inquire, " What object is to be accom-
plished by such an event?" But this inquiry,
very improperly, assumes that short sighted
man is capable of seeing the end from the

beginning, and of fully understanding all the
mind of God. Objects of the greatest moment
may be accomplished by it, although, from our
limited powers of comprehension, we may per-
ceive them not. The present is a day of
popular scepticism, on the subject of super-
natural manifestations, both in the world and
in the church. It is now considered weak and
superstitious to give credence to such things;
and some of the followers of Wesley do not
hesitate to laugh at, what they are pleased to
call, his "proneness to superstition," because
he believed in them. I think, therefore, that
I can perceive an important end to be pro-
moted by the disclosures of Miss D , and
I shall not be astonished if similar occurrences
be permitted to rebuke the infidelity of the
present age.
The Author is happy to state that, although,
some have perused his pamphlet with sceptical
minds, and laid it down with a sneer, others, by
the blessing of God, have derived from it much
spiritual good ; for he has heard of many per-
sons in different parts of the country who have,
on reading it, been awakened, and ultimately
led to the Saviour : so far, therefore, has the
design of the publication been happily accom-
plished.
In the present Edition the Author has added
the case of Ann Atherton, who was entranced

THE ENTRANCED FEMALE.
The word trance, as explained in
the London EncyclopaDdia, signifies "a
temporary absence of the soul ; a rap-
ture ; a state in which the soul is rapt
into visions of future or distant things."
And according to the learned Parkhurst,
the word means a " sacred ecstasy,
when, the use of the external senses
being suspended, God reveals some-
thing in a peculiar manner to his
servants, who are then taken, or
transported, out of themselves." This
is a phenomenon full of mystery,
and the reality of which some persons
have doubted ; but, I think, without
due consideration. Balaam is said to
have been in a trance ; and having
had " his eyes opened" therein, we are
told that he " saw the visions of the

remained in this state for several days,

were a slight foaming at the mouth,
and a little warmth about the region

great interest both night and day ; and
after having been in this state for
nearly a week, she opened her eyes,
and said, " Mr. C is dead." Her
attendants, thinking that she was
under the influence of delirium, replied
that she was mistaken, as he was not
only alive, but well. " O no !

she: " he is dead ; for a short time ago,

infinitely exceeding in beauty and

it appeared to be adapted to their

weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of
teeth. Whilst she gazed upon this
revolting scene, many souls arrived
from earth, and were
greedily seized
by innumerable devils of monstrous
shape, amidst horrid shouts of hellish

triumph, and tortured according to
their crimes.
This fearful view of the state of the
lost, agrees with the testimony of
S. T., whose case is on record in Mr.
"Wesley's Journal.* She tells us that
whilst in her trance, the place of the
condemned was unveiled, and she "saw
a vast number who stood up cursing
and blaspheming God, and spitting at
each other. And many were making
balls of fire, and throwing them at
one another." She also " saw many
others who had cups of fire, out of
which they were drinking down flames ;
and others who held cards of fire in
their hands, and seemed to be playing
with them."

Many other things were mentioned

which is to be a

lice ; but, on the contrary, there is the
most perfect accordance. The word of
God informs us that there is a world
of spirits, into which men enter on
quitting this life, and are happy or
otherwise according to their moral
character; and if the Lord should in
some cases, for reasons best known to
himself, lift the veil which conceals
from our view that spiritual region, we
ought not to reject the light thus let in
upon us, but rather avail ourselves of
its assistance for the better under-
standing of the word of God, and the
realities of another state of existence.
With respect to the locality of the
world of spirits, conjecture has been
busily and fruitfully employed. Some
suppose that it is in the sun; others
that it is in the centre of the vast
universe, attracting and governing all
the celestial bodies in their revolu-

appears most plausible, is that of its
being in the atmospheric region, and
consequently all around us. It is
true we perceive it not, because our
" senses are holden." Our physical
nature is supposed to be the veil,
separating between us and the invisible
world; but when this veil is removed
by the hand of death, our souls will at
once find themselves in that world, and
discern things which, though now pre-
sent, are not seen, because spiritually
discerned. This view of the subject
seems to be countenanced by the sacred
Scriptures. The mountain appeared
covered with spiritual beings when the
Lord, in answer to the prayer of the
Prophet, opened the eyes of his servant,
or drew aside the veil. (2 Kings vi. 17.)

" caught up to meet the Lord in the

" minister for them who shall be heirs
of salvation/' " do always behold the
face of our Father which is in heaven."
They do not leave the spiritual world
to perform their ministrations, but are
in heaven, it would seem, at the very
time they are " encamping round about
them that fear the Lord." It is true
that this view, as well as others, rela-
tive to the abode of separate spirits,
involves difficulties not to be solved in
this imperfect state ; but it neverthe-
less appears to receive some sanction
from the word of God, and is, in my
estimation, more consistent with the
condition of being entranced than any
other opinion held on the subject.
It is also a very generally received
opinion that spirits know each other in
the invisible wr
orld. The rich man

Abraham and Lazarus ; and the

It is also a

Apostle, referring to a future state, tells
us that " then shall we know, as also
we are known." According to the tes-
timony of Miss D , she knew, with-
out being informed, the various beings
she met with in the world of spirits.
It appears to be a region of knowledge
intuitively obtained, without any la-
borious effort or inquiry. This view
of the subject is calculated .to strike
terror into the hearts of those who,
by their neglect or influence, destroy
souls, as it supposes they will know
their victims when they shall meet
them in the world lying beyond the
tomb ; but it is a view well adapted
to excite pleasurable emotions in the
breast of those who " turn many to
righteousness," as it encourages the
hope of their recognising their " spiri-

joicing in the presence of our Lord

There is another opinion, entertain-

appear to be without foundation in the
word of God, —that the inhabitants
of eternity know what is taking place
in this world. The temptations pre-
sented to the mind by wicked spirits,
the guardianship of angelic beings, the
cloud of witnesses represented by the
Apostle as looking from their place of
rest upon Christians running the race
set before them, and the joy felt in
the presence of the angels of God over
one sinner that repenteth, certainly
very strongly countenance the opinion.
This also agrees with Miss D 's
statement; for she told us most dis-
tinctly that the state and circumstances
of the population of our globe were
fully known to the inhabitants of
the other world. How startling is the

her body perceived more heat and warmth in her
than they thought to be usual in dead bodies ; upon
which they desisted awhile ; and because the room
was close, and a fire had been always in it, thinking
the usual warmth might proceed from thence, they
opened the casements to let in what air they could,
and put out the fire, and then left her sometime to
herself. But returning, they found the same warmth
to continue : then they left her in this manner one
whole day, yet could find no alteration ; whereupon
they applied a looking-glass to her mouth, but not
the least cloud appeared. They put live coals to
her feet, which discovered not the least sign of life
or sense.
" Notwithstanding, her mother was very timorous,
which made her delay her burial ; and she kept her
uncoffined till seven days were expired ; at the end
of which time her heat, which was before so languid
and obscure that it could scarcely be observed,
began more manifestly to discover itself. Upon
which rubbings and other artificial helps were used,
which proved effectual, that in a short time they
found a trembling vibration of the pulse : afterwards

35
was, that she desired to see her mother, who coming
to her, she thus uttered her mind.
" *
O, Mother ! since I was absent from you, I
have been in heaven : an angel went before me to
conduct me thither. I passed through three several
gates, and at length I came to heaven's gate, where
I saw things very glorious and unutterable,—as
saints, angels, and the like, in glorious apparel, and
heard unparalleled music, divine anthems, and
hallelujahs. I would fain have entered that glorious
place ; but the angel that went before me withstood
me; yet I thought myself half in, but he told me
I could not be admitted now, but must go back and
take leave of my friends, and after some short time
I should be admitted. So he brought me hither
again, and is now standing at the bed's feet.
Mother, you must needs see him ; he is all in
white.'
" Her mother told her it was but a dream or
fancy, and that she knew not what she said. Where-
upon she avowed, with a great deal of vehemency,
that it was as true as that she was there at present.
She took notice also of several persons in the room
by their names, to show that she did not deceive,
but spake with understanding. But for the greater
confirmation, she told them of three or four persons
that had died since she was deprived of her senses,
and named each person ; one of them had died and
they knew not of it until they sent to inquire. She

a vicious person, came as far as the gate, hut was
sent back again another way. All the persons she
named died in the time she lay in the trance.
"She lived two years after this, enjoying a perfect
health, and then died in great assurance of her
salvation, speaking comfortable words and giving
wholesome instruction to all who came to visit her.
" It is worthy of observation, that during the
whole time of her sickness, which was above a
quarter of a year, she neither eat nor drank any
thing besides the juice of an orange and the yolk of
an egg.
