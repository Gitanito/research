  		              		Experience Description   

    I was lying in bed in a good deal of pain from the migraine. I was trying to decide whether to take more aspirin or let my body heal it. I rolled over to try to sleep and light was cast into my bedroom. I thought that it may be a car passing by so I looked at my curtains to see if they were still closed. They were and I could see this beautiful golden light and tunnel that I knew was attached to a golden room even though I could not see the room. This tunnel was so loving and kind. 

  I don't know how to explain this other than to say that the tunnel was me. The energy emanating from the tunnel was so peaceful. All of my pain from my migraine was gone. I didn't quite leave my body but I felt a weightless sensation like I could go back and forth with my thoughts even though I was still lying on the bed. I asked my Spirit Guides if this was it. If this was MY light and MY tunnel. They nodded excitedly. There was no judgement regardless of what my choice would be. I really wanted to go further into this tunnel but if I went into it any further I knew that I would not be able to stay on Earth. I have never felt peace like this. This peace was so strong that it almost felt physical. 

  All of a sudden I could see a golden being. Like a golden man with a long golden beard. He seemed to be standing at a podium with all of my deceased loved ones behind him. They so longed to be with me and to comfort me. Their faces were so loving. Next, I was in a huge stadium. There were souls all around me but behind a barrier. It was pure pandemonium. I could not figure out why they were so excited. Like who they were waiting to see. It was like when you see the Beatles and all the fans are screaming to get close to them. All these souls were screaming and excited to get close to....me! I could hardly believe it. They were so proud of me for coming to Earth. 

  And I realized they were waiting for me to write my name in the halls of celebration of those who came to Earth. It is so hard here that we will all be acknowledged for coming here. I felt incredible shame in that moment. They regarded me as a hero and I have hated most of my life here. I have complained through most of my life. All of a sudden and before I could reach the place to sign my name in the Great Hall of Life, I knew that I could not do this and stay there. I began to slide back very slowly. I would have been extremely upset to leave this dimension (it was in my bedroom but also another dimension, very weird), had I not wanted to stay on Earth. I sat in awe of what happened and the golden light stayed in my room and kept it lit up for about 30 minutes. I basked in that glow and felt the love and peace until I fell asleep. I shall look forward to death from then on, it was so very wonderful.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 September 2016  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness        Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening   I had a very bad migraine. I had many in the past but that night I knew that I may die but wasn't sure.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I lost awareness of my body  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   Everything was much more potent.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         The whole time.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time slowed down.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I think it was the same.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The same.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     I could not go far into the tunnel or I could not come back. This I knew with absolute certainty even though no one had told me. I went into the other dimension with all the souls cheering me on but also had to come back.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     They were friends, family and pets (all deceased).  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Very bright golden light. The light seemed to have its own personality. It was me-that is the only way I can explain it. It was pure love. I cannot wait to see it again at the end of my life.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     Yes, I went into another dimension that was actually in my bedroom. It was also made of me. Like the golden tunnel it seemed to be made of my energy. Very familiar. This was when all the souls were in pandemonium lined up trying to touch me. They were screaming in excitement like I was Elvis. I was a celebrity to them simply for coming to Earth and living life as a human. Life on Earth is very harsh. It certainly is NOT reality. These souls, some did not get approved to come to Earth. And some were simply living vicariously through me. I could tell at that moment that they had been observing and watching my entire life. I was floating down this red carpet heading toward a place where I would be celebrated for coming to Earth when it occurred to me that I must stay. I began to slide backwards down the red carpet very slowly. I was satisfied as I had made the decision to stay but I would have been very upset had I wanted to leave.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Absolute Happiness. Relief that I may get to leave Earth or at least had the choice. I hated my life up until 2016. About 3 months before that I began to love Earth for the first time ever so I was really annoyed that I had been finally offered the choice to leave Earth but did not want to anymore. I was elated to feel this experience of non-judgement. I felt so loved and accepted. Joy and peace.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     I felt like one with not only others but one with things like furniture in my room. This was VERY clear to me during this time. Only when I woke up the next day did the feeling of oneness go away. It is hard to feel it now but it made so much sense then.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will  Same as the last question, I came to a border that I could have passed but would have been done with Earth. I was in control and it was so beautiful how much it was up to me. Whatever I chose to do would have been the right answer according to the universe in that moment.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other faiths- New age   I am not religious at all. At the time and currently I follow what my Spirit Guides teach. They give me information and I make Facebook posts to share freely with others. I believe in God, but not the religious God. God as a being of pure love. My Spirit Guides taught me how to talk to God and it is neither a he nor she. I call God a he because it is simply easier to explain. God says that 'He' merely steeped aside as we brought ourselves into existence. God is with us every second of the day and is our mother, father, friend all rolled into one. He adores us.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age   Same as above.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     Everything matched my beliefs very well.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   Yes, there was a golden man with a golden beard. He was at a podium in front of my loved ones.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I could see my soul life quite easily. Not lifetimes but I could see that I was already being given choices of where to go next after this human life. I could come back as a human again or literally go anywhere that I wanted after this. It was obvious that I existed before this lifetime as well. It's like I could see my soul as this long ribbon that had many adventures and lifetimes before this.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Yes, it was very obvious to me that we are all one. But it goes even deeper than that. We are all the same, like the exact same thing somehow. I don't feel it now but I did during the experience.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Yes, the meaning was obvious too in that moment. It was for me to exist and to just love myself. Like to live without judgement of myself or others. The meaning of life seemed to be for us to to 'be.'  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     That was very obvious during the NDE. I know for a fact because of the NDE that the human experience is less reality than the other side. This experience is harsh on purpose. I learned that we come to Earth to learn as souls about things like aging, death, scarcity, pain, patience, sickness. This is simply a learning plane. I could tell that I had been approved to come here and that I had chosen my life and the main events that happened. This was very important as my life was simply a facet in the universal knowledge that all souls will share in. I know that I had a life as a soul before and will after.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     Yes, we come here to experience all of the difficulties ON PURPOSE. This is why the souls were so proud of me and were trying to touch me. They knew I had a difficult time here and they were proud of me. We wanted to know what it was like to age, become sick, experience harsh emotions etc., that is why we come to this grand learning place as souls. That is the entire point. This answers the question of suffering on this planet such as why some children have cancer etc. It would be entirely pointless to come to Earth and incarnate into an enlightened body. You may as well stay on the other side. We come here to suffer. I don't know why souls want to learn about this but they are incredibly interested to learn about it.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Only that I need to love myself much of more. And as a result of the NDE I really have learned to live myself. According to what I felt that night I wasted a lot of time hating myself. Love is all there is on the other side. It is pure love.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I used to fear death before. Not death itself but what you went through just before. Now, I know that your soul pops out before you actually die. I look forward to actually dying one day and seeing my tunnel again.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This experience is very vivid compared to my normal life during that time.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The tunnel. It is my friend. I know it is waiting for me one day.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The next day. They were amazed. They loved it. It gave them all great hope and excitement. They all wished they could have an NDE.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Just the usual stuff floating around about it. I have never read about any but I knew that they were peaceful etc.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I was fully awake. Some people try to explain some NDEs away as the person's brain dying or lacking oxygen or possibly them dreaming it. I was awake when this happened so I know it was real. A migraine such as mine does not just go away and become replaced by full body peace if it was not a real experience. I would have continued to feel pain if this was all in my head. I feel bad for people who have a hard time believing in mystical experiences.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Same answer as above.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Nope, you did a wonderful job.
