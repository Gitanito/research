The following pages represent out-
lines of a series of sermons which I
preached in the fall of 1935. Their
delivery aroused much favorable com-
ment and their publication is prompted
by numerous requests for copies. For
sentimental reasons I am publishing
these sermons in their original form.
The problem of mental healing is
today of unusual interest particularly
to American Jews. Unfortunately
there is a dearth especially of simply
written material on this subject. If
these sermons will in a small way help
crystallize the issue involved and lead
to further study, their publication will
be justified.

INTRODUCTION
By DR. FELIX A. LEVY
President, Central Conference of
American Rabbis
Spiritual healing is as old as Jewish
tradition itself and plays a rather
prominent part in our life. No period
of our history has been free of the
practice of "mind cure" or of the dan-
gers of magic and superstition that
lurk in this custom. To guard against
the latter eventuality in our own day
and to give our Jewish valetudinarians
a Jewish way by which "psychoses"
and "neuroses" may be dissolved, and
health, spiritual and physical, may be
gained Rabbi Mendelsohn has pub-
lished the following discourses.
[9]
INTRODUCTION
These sermons fill,
as every rabbi
knows, a distinct need. Our people
are driven frequently to strange altars
in order to find relief from some real
or imaginary malady that will not
yield to medical knowledge or skill.
They will read strange literatures and
pray alien thoughts because they are
unaware of what their own religion
offers them or find its ideas inacces-
sible because of the lack of popular
literature on this topic. In simple al-
most childlike language the author has
expounded the views of Judaism on
mental healing and many will be
grateful to learn, from the Jewish
point of view, about the relation and
inter-relation of mind and body, of the
therapeutic functions of prayer and of
the spiritual attitude as a cure for
physical ills. The rabbi of today has
rarely the time and even more seldom
the inclination to serve as "healer."
Perhaps we ought have practitioners
[10]
INTRODUCTION
(there are a few), deeply religious
men and women, who by their mini-
stration aid the physician and nature
in effecting the patient's recovery.
A study of this little volume and a
following of its suggestions can help
the divided mind and restore con-
fidence to shattered nerves. Faith
does move mountains but is not a cure-
all nor can religion with its call to
prayer and communion claim to be an
infallible panacea. Judaism, as our
writer indicates, steers a middle
course, and makes neither extravagant
claims nor the unintelligible (to us)
denials of Christian Science. Our re-
ligion recognizes as real all the factors
of human personality, does not negate
body or call pain and evil illusions.
May the book achieve its author's
purpose, to stimulate further discus-
sion of an important problem. May it
also brighten the lives of many readers
which it deserves and bring to a nerv-
[ii]

ous and disintegrated generation a
hope and a faith, and thus an integrity
of personality, in the name of the God
of Israel who can "heal all wounds"
and "make us whole."

I.
WHY IS OURS A NERVOUS AGE?
The present age has been variously
characterized. It has been character-
ized as the age of science, since science
has in our day succeeded in doing so
many marvelous things for us. It has
been characterized as the age of psy-
chology, since psychology has in our
day succeeded in penetrating the hu-
man mind and divulging many of its
ramifications. However, it seems to
me that there is still one more way of
characterizing the present age and
that is the age of "nerves." There
are undoubtedly more neurotics in our
day than ever before in the history of
mankind.
If we are willing to study modern
[13]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
life carefully we shall have no diffi-
culty in locating the reason for the
great number of neurotics in the world
today. A nervous individual is in
many respects an abnormal individual
and modern life prevents us from
being normal. We all boast about the
accomplishments of civilization, but
we forget that it possesses one inher-
ent evil, viz., it alienates us from
nature. Our instincts demand that we
be very close to nature, but civiliza-
tion is constantly getting us farther
and farther away from nature. Our
disregard of the laws of nature and
our adherence to civilized rather than
natural morality create a conflict in
our minds and this conflict expresses
itself in a variety of nervous disturb-
ances.
Another reason for the great num-
ber of neurotics in the world today is
the failure of medicine to cure most
functional diseases. Now I do not
[14]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
want to be misunderstood. I am cer-
tainly the last person to underestimate
the tremendous service which medicine
is rendering to us and the constant
progress which it is making in the field
of human health. However, this serv-
ice and this progress are primarily in
organic diseases. When our organs do
not work properly, medicine is most
helpful, but when our emotions do not
work properly, medicine seems to be
helpless. If medicine were able to
cure functional diseases, there would
not be as much quackery as we find
on all sides in this country today.
Now intelligent people realize that
the fact that this is a nervous age is a
serious problem which cannot be
ignored. The nervous individual is
constantly haunted by fears and wor-
ries and he does not know where
these fears and worries come from nor
how to get rid of them. Frequently
they are so disastrous as to lead to
[15]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
suicide. And even if they do not lead
to this extremity the neurotic is a ter-
rible burden to himself and to his
family. If you have a neurotic in your
family, you know exactly what I
mean.
What are these neurotics doing in
order to save themselves from their
unhappy lot? Those whose disturb-
ance is serious fill our hospitals and
sanitariums, but those whose disturb-
ance is not serious resort to escape
mechanisms. They engage in a
variety of activities for the purpose of
getting their minds away from them-
selves. One of these activities is card
playing. Many a card player will tell
you that this pastime soothes his shat-
tered nerves. We Jews are a nervous
people, and for this reason there is
probably more card playing among
Jews than among any other group in
this country. However, it is a well-
[16]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
known fact that card playing, like all
other escape mechanisms to which
neurotics resort, has never relieved
anybody's nerves. On the contrary,
after an evening of cards an irritable
individual will be even more irritable.
Ask husbands who have nervous wives
or wives who have nervous husbands
and they will readily corroborate this
point.
Since the aim of religion is to bring
happiness into the life of man and
since neurotics are invariably un-
happy, the problem of curing "nerves"
is a religious problem. Fortunately,
religion has tackled this problem and
the nervous individual who desires to
cure himself will find relief by apply-
ing diligently the prescription of re-
ligion. This prescription is found in
the first chapter of Genesis which
deals with the subject of creation and
which is read on this Sabbath in all
[17]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
synagogues. A careful study of this
chapter will bring to light two funda-
mental propositions:
In the first place, the first chapter
of Genesis teaches us that man is
created in the image of God. There
is a spark of the divine in every human
being, whether he be white, black, or
yellow, or whether he be rich or poor.
If man is created in the image of God,
it means plainly that happiness is the
inalienable right of every human be-
ing. The neurotic in particular must
digest this principle, since no one can
ever be happy unless he first believes
that happiness is possible. In the
second place, the first chapter of Gen-
esis teaches us how to acquire happi-
ness. The outstanding attribute of
God is His creativeness and Judaism
teaches us that man must constantly
imitate God. If God does and creates
things, we too must do and create
things. We must find out just what
[183
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
we like to do best and then proceed
and do it. Not escape mechanisms,
but useful activity can and will make
for happiness.
I shall not be surprised if many of
you will say that I have given you
only another "preachy" sermon. I
shall not be surprised if many of you
will say that this rabbi, like all other
rabbis, ministers, and priests, is trying
to rob us of pleasures like card playing
and to get us to work for charity and
religion. If this be your conclusion,
you are greatly mistaken. Not every-
body is qualified to work for charity
and religion, and I can assure you that
frequently synagogues, churches, and
charitable institutions would be much
better off if many of their workers
would resign. If you enjoy public en-
deavor, well and good, but if you do
not enjoy it and you are in it only in
order to please somebody else, the
sooner you quit, the better for every-
[19]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
body concerned. The point to remenv-
ber is that you must find yourself in
your work regardless of what this work
may be. Make an art of everything
you do, whether it be baking pies,
writing books, or painting pictures
and when you are a real artist happi-
ness will be yours.
Many nervous people claim that
you do not have to be an artist in
order to gain happiness. There is an-
other and more effective way of gain-
ing this objective and this is by taking
up Christian Science. However, as far
as Jews are concerned the question
arises whether or not a Jew can accept
Christian Science and still remain a
Jew. This question deserves special
treatment and it will constitute the
subject of our sermon next Friday eve-
ning.
[20]
II.
CAN A JEW BE A CHRISTIAN
SCIENTIST?
For a number of years I have been
asked to speak on the relationship of
Judaism to Christian Science. I have
hesitated to do this just as other
rabbis have hesitated and the reason
is obvious. In every Jewish congrega-
tion there are members who have a
Christian Scientist in the family, and
we Jews are a very sensitive people.
When the rabbi speaks against Chris-
tian Science these members interpret
his remarks as an attack on them per-
sonally and sermons should of course
deal not with personalities but with
generalities. However, Christian Sci-
[21]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
ence is becoming more and more of
a problem in American Jewry and any
rabbi who ignores this question is, in
my opinion, faithless to his calling.
Last week I announced that the
topic of my sermon for this Friday
evening would be, "Can a Jew Be a
Christian Scientist?" However, this
statement is not properly worded.
This is a free country and our Consti-
tution guarantees freedom of worship
to all of us. If a Jew so desires he cer-
tainly can be a Christian Scientist, just
as he can be anything else. He can be
a Catholic, a Presbyterian, or even a
Holy Roller. The real question there-
fore is not whether a Jew can be a
Christian Scientist but rather whether,
after accepting Christian Science, he
can still remain a Jew.
Before answering this question, we
must first find out what it means to be
a Jew. A great deal of confusion pre-
[22]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
vails on this subject not only among
Gentiles but also among Jews. In the
Book of Jonah we are told that when
Jonah was asked to identify himself he
said: "I am a Hebrew and I fear the
Lord, the God of heaven." This defi-
nition has been accepted by the Jewish
people for thousands of years and it
still holds true today. A Jew is only
he who professes Judaism and the mo-
ment he begins to profess another
religion he ceases being a Jew. Chris-
tian Science practitioners, however,
have been telling Jews that the accept-
ance of Christian Science does not in
any way affect their Judaism. Chris-
tian Science practitioners have even
been telling Jews that the very oppo-
site is true, that the acceptance of
Christian Science will make of them
better Jews.
Many Jews have been influenced by
this argument, but unfortunately it is
[23]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
a flagrant misrepresentation, to say
the least. Anyone who is willing to do
a little studying of Christian Science
will have no difficulty in locating the
real facts. Mrs. Eddy publishes hi her
text-book "Science and Health" the
creed of her new faith. The second
article of this creed says: "We ac-
knowledge His son one Christ, the
Holy Ghost or divine comforter."
Does not this show beyond any doubt
that a Christian Scientist is a very
good Christian? And Mrs. Eddy does
not stop at this point, for she takes us
much farther. She makes it perfectly
clear that a Christian Scientist must be
an orthodox Christian and he must
subscribe to the entire orthodox Chris-
tian theology. He must believe that
the crucifixion of Jesus was intended
as the vicarious atonement for human
sins; he must believe that Jesus rose
from his tomb in order to prove to the
[24]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
world that it is possible to conquer
death.
I wonder whether you know that all
other Christians are bitter enemies of
Christian Science not only because of
its impossible theories but even more
so because of its arrogance. Mrs.
Eddy proclaims boldly that all other
Christians are decidedly erroneous in
their interpretation of Jesus, and that
she alone possesses "the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the
truth." All other Christians are not
true followers of Jesus because they
have overlooked the most important
detail in his character. Jesus healed
the ailing but the large majority of
Christians have relegated the entire
matter of healing to the medical pro-
fession. Not so, however, is the case
with Mrs. Eddy. She and her follow-
ers have made healing the primary
object of the Christian Science church.
[25]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
The Christian Scientist, according to
Mrs. Eddy, is therefore the best Chris-
tian in the world and there is none like
unto him.
The fact of the matter is that Mrs.
Eddy is not only pro-Jesus and pro-
Christianity but she is also anti-
Judaism and anti-Jew. In "Science
and Health" she makes slurring re-
marks about Judaism and she harps
repeatedly on "rabbinical error." The
Jew who accepts Christian Science is
expected to swallow the orthodox
Christianity of this church and its
slurs on Judaism and the Jewish
people. Moreover, in order to join
the Christian Science church a Jew
must waive all allegiance to Judaism
and to the synagogue. It is therefore
perfectly evident that it is impossible
to accept Christian Science and remain
a Jew.
Of course at this point you will
[26]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
naturally ask, Why then do Christian
Science practitioners deny this unde-
niable fact? The answer is not diffi-
cult to locate. Christian Science is a
materialistic religion and the Jew who
is stingy with his synagogue is very
generous with the Christian Science
church. He is anxious to convince his
Gentile friends that they have made
no mistake in accepting him into their
ranks. In order to draw Jews into
their midst Christian Scientists are
satisfied to do a little temporary mis-
representation on the fine points of
their theology.
Some Jews are under the impression
that the opposition to Christian
Science arises only from orthodoxy but
that reform is willing to adopt a more
liberal attitude. This impression is
entirely erroneous. Reform is just as
adamant in its opposition to Christian
Science as orthodoxy, and the Central
[27]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
Conference of American Rabbis has
been quite outspoken on this subject.
I have before me a letter from Dr.
David Philipson of Cincinnati, who is
one of the oldest and most prominent
reform rabbis in the land, in which he
tells me that he refused to officiate at
a marriage between a member of his
congregation and a Jewish girl who
had accepted Christian Science. He
also states that he would not officiate
at the funeral of a Jew who was a
member of a Christian Science church.
It therefore goes without saying that
a Christian Science Jew cannot be
buried in a Jewish cemetery.
For many centuries it was consid-
ered opprobrious among Jews to refer
to a "meshumad" in the family. I do
not know whether this is still the case
in this country today, but the fact re-
mains that a Jew who accepts Chris-
tian Science is a perfect "meshumad"
[28]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
and a Jewess who accepts Christian
Science is a perfect "meshumedes."
To the Jew who joins a Christian
Science church I therefore say, "My
dear friend, I hate to lose you, but the
step which you have taken excludes
you from K'lal Yisroel and I am
forced to part company with you. My
people is no longer your people and
my God is no longer your God."
C29]
III.
NEED A JEW BE A CHRISTIAN
SCIENTIST?
In my sermon two weeks ago I tried
to prove, and I hope to your satisfac-
tion, that it is impossible to accept
Christian Science and remain a Jew.
Of course I realize that my argument
has a serious flaw. For the Christian
Scientist will come forward and say,
"Well, what of it? Supposing I grant
that Christian Science destroys Juda-
ism; what difference does that make?
If the Jew finds in Christian Science
that which he is unable to find in
Judaism, he will continue to accept it
and the thunderings of rabbis will not
in any way alter the situation."
My purpose this evening, therefore,
[30]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
is to deny categorically this conten-
tion. I shall try to show you that
Christian Science has no message
whatever for the Jew. I am perfectly
willing to admit that some of the
teachings of Christian Science are
beautiful but these are borrowed
from Judaism. There is an old Tal-
mudic proverb which says, "Do not
throw stones into the well from which
thou hast drunk." Mrs. Eddy violated
completely the admonition in this
proverb. After borrowing her best
teachings from Judaism, she belittled
the Hebrew Bible and ridiculed Jewish
teachers. In order to clarify my point
let me cite two popular doctrines of
Christian Science and their Jewish
counterpart.
In the first place, the Christian
Scientist says that Mrs. Eddy must
have discovered a great religion since
she proclaimed to the world that "God
is All in All." If God is to be found
[31]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
everywhere and in everything, then
ours must be a perfect world. This
represents a beautiful doctrine which
is bound to make life more interesting
and attractive. Now I do not deny
that this is a beautiful doctrine, but I
do deny that Mrs. Eddy is entitled to
any credit for this doctrine, since it is
Jewish to the core. The book of
Isaiah says plainly, "Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth
is full of His glory." And the first
chapter of Genesis says plainly, "And
God saw everything that He had made,
and behold it was very good." Here
you have an unmistakable proclama-
tion of God's omnipresence and our
world's perfection.
In the second place, the Christian
Scientist says that Mrs. Eddy must
have discovered a great religion since
she proclaimed to the world the lesson
of optimism. Mrs. Eddy taught that
God is not only everywhere, but he is
[32]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
also loving and merciful to all His
creatures. He who accepts this doc-
trine has therefore nothing to worry
about. Here again I do not deny that
this is a beautiful doctrine, but I' do
deny that Mrs. Eddy is entitled to any
credit for this doctrine, since it is Jew-
ish to the core. The book of Exodus
says plainly, "The Lord, the Lord God,
merciful and gracious, long-suffering
and abundant in goodness and truth."
And the twenty-third Psalm says
plainly, "The Lord is my shepherd, I
shall not want." Here you have an
unmistakable proclamation of Mrs.
Eddy's optimism.
I could continue to show you in-
definitely how all the beautiful
doctrines of Christian Science are
borrowed from Judaism. However,
the Christian Scientist will again come
forward and say, "You have over-
looked the most important thing about
Christian Science. You have failed to
[33]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
state that it is a healing religion.
Christian Science teaches that by
having faith in Jesus and by praying
to him, the depressed and the ailing
will be relieved of their suffering." It
will no doubt sound strange to the
Christian Scientist, but the fact of the
matter is that this idea too is borrowed
from Judaism. Judaism, of course,
does not say that the final healer is
Jesus, but Judaism does say that the
final healer is God. Twenty-five cen-
turies before Mrs. Eddy was born the
prophet Jeremiah offered the following
prayer, "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall
be healed; save me and I shall be
saved; for Thou art my praise." The
Orthodox Jew still recites this verse
three times daily in the Sh'mone Esre,
the prayer of silent devotion.
Thus far I have shown you only one
phase of Christian Science. How-
ever, in order that you may know the
whole story I cannot stop at this point.
[34]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
I must proceed to show you that some
of the teachings of Christian Science
are highly objectionable. In order to
teach her followers not to be disturbed
by any disease Mrs. Eddy evolved a
philosophy of her own. According to
this philosophy material things have
no objective existence; they exist only
in your mind. If everything you see
and hear and smell does not exist, then
disease too does not exist. Mrs. Eddy
therefore proclaims repeatedly that
"disease is an error of mortal mind."
This doctrine is contrary not only to
logic but also to Judaism; hence the
Jew must reject it. For when Jere-
miah prays, "Heal me, O Lord, and I
shall be healed/
7
he states plainly that
disease exists, for if it did not exist
then there would be nothing for God
to heal in the prophet.
I do not know to what extent Gen-
tile Christian Scientists really accept
Mrs. Eddy's doctrines but I do know
[35]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
that the large majority of Jewish
Christian Scientists do not accept
them. They prate about being "in
Science" and about disease being "an
error" but they do not mean what they
say. I have first hand information
that most Jewish Christian Scientists
use physicians and medicine con-
stantly although this is against their
religion. I know of a Jewess who is
a prominent Christian Scientist but
who came to a dentist and said,
"Doctor, I have been too busy to read,
so I came to you to relieve my tooth-
ache." That dentist was sufficiently
charitable to help the poor lady in
spite of her insult to his profession.
Such tactics make the Jewish Chris-
tian Scientist a pathetic figure. No
one, in my opinion, is entitled to more
pity than the average Jewish Chris-
tian Scientist.
In all justice to the Jewish Chris-
tian Scientist, I must say that occa-
[36]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
sionally you do find one who sincerely
accepts Mrs. Eddy's doctrines. I
knew of a Jewish mother whose two
year old boy became seriously ill and
all she did for him was to keep on
reading from "Science and Health."
The father begged that they call a
doctor, but the mother insisted that
the baby did not need a doctor and
the mother was absolutely right. The
baby died. I knew of another Jewess
who contracted an infection and again
the husband begged that they call a
doctor. Here again the wife insisted
that she did not need a doctor and
again she was absolutely right. They
rushed her to the hospital where she
died. Jews and Jewesses who take
Christian Science seriously always suf-
fer the consequences.
Let me then restate my thesis. The
distinctive theories of Christian Sci-
ence are illogical, objectionable, and
dangerous. However, when Christian
[37]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
Science teaches that God is every-
where, that this is a beautiful world,
and that prayer relieves suffering, it is
rendering a genuine service to man-
kind. These excellent teachings are
all found in Judaism and Christian
Science has therefore nothing what-
ever to offer to the Jew. Why then do
some Jews take up Mrs. Eddy's re-
ligion? This question will be discussed
in my sermon next Friday.
[38]
IV.
SHALL WE CONDEMN THE JEW-
ISH CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST?
All Jews who are willing to face re-
ality are satisfied that Christian Sci-
ence is a disintegrating force in Jewry.
Once a Jew joins a Christian Science
church he is lost to his people. For
this reason most rabbis have expressed
themselves in condemnatory terms
about the Jewish Christian Scientist.
However, if we resort to condemna-
tion and do nothing else, we are only
following the road of least resistance.
The late Dr. Gotthard Deutsch of the
Hebrew Union College used to say,
"It takes two to make a shidduck"
After a careful study we may perhaps
conclude that the blame for the spread
[39]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
of Christian Science is to be placed not
upon the Jews who accept it but rather
upon the Jewish community which has
made this acceptance possible.
Of course I know that some of our
people have taken up Christian Sci-
ence for social reasons. These Jews
do not have the courage to profess
their origin. They believe that there
is a stigma attached to being a Jew
and that by professing Christian Sci-
ence the stain is immediately removed.
About such people it is difficult to ex-
press an opinion. Their motive is so
low and disgusting that one hates to
talk about it. We have no cause to
regret the exit of such people from
our midst. On the contrary, we should
be glad that they will no. longer pass
for Jews but for Christian Scientists,
and in this particular instance Chris-
tian Science is rendering a genuine
service to the Jewish Community.
However, most Jews who take up
[40]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
Christian Science cannot be included
in this category. They are prompted
by sincere motives. This act is usually
consummated during a crisis when
Jews, like all other people, are greatly
in need of cheer and encouragement.
These unfortunates resort to Christian
Science because they find in it that
which they have not found in the syn-
agogue.
What is wrong with the American
synagogue? I take it that all of us are
friends of the synagogue and we
should therefore have the courage to
see not only its strength but also its
weakness. As far as I am concerned,
the greatest weakness of the syna-
gogue is expressed in a fable by the
famous Russian Kriloff. This fable
tells about a peasant who returned
from the circus and described his ex-
periences to his cronies. He said that
he had seen insects no larger than the
head of a pin. "How about the ele-
[41]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
phant?" asked one of the auditors.
"The elephant?" asked the peasant.
"Was he there? By Jove, the ele-
phant I did not see." The American
synagogue too has failed to see the
elepihant in Judaism. The primary ob-
ject of the synagogue is to teach the
Jew that he must have faith in God
and that this faith is acquired through
prayer. Everything else outside of
faith and prayer is secondary in Juda-
ism and yet the American synagogue
emphasizes many other things but not
these two cardinal principles.
The reason why the American syna-
gogue does not emphasize faith and
prayer is not difficult to locate. The
American Jew has not as yet found
himself religiously and he therefore
does not know what he wants. As a
result of this situation we have Jews
who style themselves orthodox but do
not know the meaning of orthodoxy;
we have Jews who style themselves
[42]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
conservative but do not know the
meaning of conservatism; we have
Jews who style themselves reform but
do not know the meaning of reform.
If an individual is not sure of himself
he looks for assurance from somebody
else and what is true of an individual
is true also of a people. Since syna-
gogues do not know what they want
they clamor for crowds. They advise
the rabbi that if religious subjects are
not popular he should preach on secu-
lar subjects but he must draw crowds.
As an old religious people we ought to
know that crowds are frequently an
index not to religion but to irreligion.
We ought to remember the vision
which came to Elijah that God is not
to be found either in the wind, earth-
quake, or fire but in the "still small
voice." At any rate, under present
conditions the synagogue is largely not
a religious institution but a lecture
platform. It is this fact which in my
[43]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
opinion is driving many Jews to look
for faith and prayer in the Christian
Science church.
Another reason why Jews take up
Christian Science is the fact that we
lack the missionary spirit. Jews are
very sensitive people. Frequently
they would like to make friends but
because of their natural reserve they
cannot do that. However, instead of
blaming themselves for their back-
wardness they blame the rabbi and the
officers of synagogues. This back-
wardness is a serious barrier to tlie
progress of synagogues and we have
not yet learned to overcome it. Since
officers of Christian Science churches
are better handshakers than officers of
synagogues, the Jew who visits the
Christian Science church is greatly at-
tracted by this overbubbling zeal and
sociability.
What then shall we do in order to
stop Jews from taking up Christian
[44]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
Science? The problem is more serious
than most of us realize. There are no
statistics available for Chicago, but I
have been told that seventy thousand
Jews have taken up Christian Science
in New York City alone. Thus far
most rabbis and synagogues have ig-
nored the entire problem. The only
one in the country who has done some-
thing constructive in this direction is
Rabbi Morris Lichtensteih of New
York. He founded a Jewish Science
synagogue and he published a series of
valuable books in English in which he
shows that the Jew does not have to
look for religious knowledge and inspi-
ration outside of his faith. Rabbi
Lichtenstein stresses particularly the
subject of healing in Judaism, and his
efforts have met with a great deal of
success.
Conditions peculiar to New York
City forced Rabbi Lichtenstein to or-
ganize a special Jewish Science syna-
[453
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
gogue, but this is not necessary in
other communities. It is my firm con-
viction that the same results can be
obtained even more satisfactorily
through existing synagogues. Let all
synagogues organize weekly Jewish
Science meetings at which the funda-
mentals of Judaism and especially
faith and prayer should be stressed.
These doctrines cannot be brought to
the people effectively through our reg-
ular services, since they are too formal.
Public worship is primarily an inspira-
tional and not an educational agency.
Many orthodox leaders have dodged
the entire subject of Christian Science
by saying that it is a problem of re-
form only. Orthodox Jews, these
leaders argue, never take up Mrs.
Eddy's cult. However, this conten-
tion is decidedly erroneous. The fact
of the matter is that the large ma-
jority of Jewish Christian Scientists
whom I know, come from orthodox
[46]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
homes. To attempt to solve any prob-
.lem by ignoring it means to follow the
philosophy of the ostrich which im-
agines that by burying its head in the
sand it is safe from its pursuer. Chris-
tian Science is a problem which con-
cerns all of us, and it is only through
a concerted effort on the part of all
Jews that we can ever hope to reach a
solution.

THE VOICE OF THE
CONGREGATION
My series of sermons on "Judaism
and Mental Healing" has aroused a
great deal of interest. This fact has
not surprised me in the least, since I
decided to deliver this series only after
a number of people had asked me to
do so. That mental healing is today
a burning issue among the Jewish
people is evident also from the goodly
number of questions which came to
me during the delivery of these ser-
mons. Most of these questions dis-
play thought and learning, and they
are a compliment to the intelligence of
those who attend our services.
Let me express my profound grati-
[48]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
tude to all those who have sent in
questions. They have helped me
greatly and some of them are so im-
portant that I expect to publish them.
All questions will be answered this
season, but this evening I am going to
discuss only those which I consider of
immediate significance.
Before answering definite queries I
wish to discuss for just a moment a
general criticism which came from a
large number of people and which runs
something like this: "You have not
told us enough. We should like to
know much more about why this is a
nervous age and how we are able to
cure ourselves from nervousness."
Those who have made this complaint
do not seem to understand that the
sermon is only a stimulant to Jewish
knowledge. No sermon or lecture will
ever educate anybody in anything.
You may listen to lectures on medicine
for fifty years in succession and yet
[49]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
you will not be a physician unless
you are willing to study and digest
these lectures for yourself. The late
Henry Ward Beecher, who was one of
the very great American preachers,
used to say, "You can't save any souls
after the first twenty minutes" and
he was absolutely right. The modern
Jew must therefore not rely on the ser-
mon alone and he must do some study-
ing in Judaism for himself.
Let us turn now to some definite
questions which have been put to me.
Here is the first question: "In your
sermons you seemed to have belittled
the value of Christian Science. How
is it then that all Christian Scientists
are poised and cheerful?" My answer
is that I deny the premise of this ques-
tion. It is not true that all Christian
Scientists are poised and cheerful.
The most nervous person I know is a
Jew who is an ardent Christian
Scientist. A prominent Gentile physi-
[50]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
cian of this city relates a story about
a Gentile woman whom he treated for
a nervous disturbance. This woman
moved to another city and after a
lapse of some time she wrote to her
Chicago doctor: "Please send me the
prescription for the pills you gave me.
I need them so that my hands may not
tremble when I hold up my book in the
Christian Science Church." Surely,
the Jew who accepts Christian Science
is seldom poised and cheerful, since
this new cult creates a conflict in him.
The Jewish Christian Scientist feels
that he has something to hide, and he
is therefore never at home in the com-
pany of his newly-acquired Gentile
friends.
Of course I am ready to admit that
some Christian Scientists are happy
people. By training themselves to
have faith in God and to pray to Him
constantly, human beings do acquire
an optimistic outlook upon life. How-
[51]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
ever, the religious Jew has done the
same thing for hundreds and hundreds
of years before Mrs. Eddy was born.
When you strip Christian Science of
its illogical and impossible theories, it
does have a message for the Gentile
but not for the Jew who is able to find
all the cheer he needs in Judaism.
And here is the second question:
"Your remedy for fighting Christian
Science among Jews is to teach Jewish
Science. Does not this show that you
are only an imitator?" My answer is
that it does not show anything of the
sort. By adopting the name Jewish
Science I am not imitating anybody.
I am only reclaiming a Jewish term
which has always existed. In the first
chapter of Proverbs we are told: "The
fear of the Lord is the beginning of
knowledge/
7
Here the word "knowl-
edge" is used to denote religion and
"science" is derived from the Latin
"scire" which means "to know." The
[52]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
term "Jewish Science" is therefore
only a synonym for the "Jewish re-
ligion" but those who do not like the
word "science" may use "chochmah"
instead. In my opinion the word
"science" is preferable since Christian
Science has advertised it for us, and
when I say Jewish Science people will
know exactly what I have in mind.
However, this question suggests an-
other one which has not been asked by
anybody. Since when is it wrong to
imitate the good practices of Gentiles?
Certainly Ezekiel did not think so, for
he proclaimed to his contemporaries:
"Neither have (ye) done after the or-
dinances of the nations that are round
about you." There are many excellent
things which you could have learned
from your Babylonian neighbors, said
the prophet, but since you failed to do
so God will be stringent with you. In
like manner I say that there are many
excellent things which we are able to
[ S3 ]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
learn from our Christian neighbors
today. We can learn from our Chris-
tian neighbors reverence and loyalty,
since the average church member is
more reverential and more loyal than
the average synagogue member. It
happens that the word "science" as a
synonym for religion is Jewish, but
even if it were Christian we should not
hesitate to use it.
And now for one more comment
which came to me: "You dwelt so
much on the prominence of healing in
Judaism, but all this is meaningless,
since the American Jew knows nothing
about it." My answer is that this
comment is very well taken. If the
Jew had been familiar with his religion
Christian Science would never have
been a problem among our people.
However, since the Jew is ignorant of
his religion it is the duty of the syna-
gogue to teach it to him. Historically
the synagogue has been known as
[54]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
"Beth Hammidrash" a house of study,
and unless it is willing to carry on this
tradition we do not need synagogues
at all.
In concluding this series of sermons
I must add one more reason why the
Jew should not look for mental healing
outside of his own people. Jews have
been the leading physicians of the soul
not only religiously but also medically.
The greatest contribution to mental
therapeutics has been made by profes-
sor Sigmund Freud whose theories
have revolutionized modern psychi-
atry. The fact that Freud is a Jew has
everything to do with his medical
knowledge, since in my opinion his
basic principles are derived from
Jewish sources. This represents a new
and interesting angle of the subject of
mental healing, and I shall return to
it a little later this season.
[55]
VI.
ANCIENT JUDAISM AND
MODERN PSYCHOLOGY
There is a well-known and well-
established law in sociology that the
minority will always imitate the ma-
jority. It is the misfortune of Judaism
that it has held up an unusually lofty
ideal before its adherents. For this
reason the number of these adherents
has always been very small and there
has always been apostacy in Israel. In
every age and generation Jews and
Jewesses have forsaken their own
faith, the faith of a minority and ac-
cepted the faith of their neighbors, the
faith of the majority.
Now when we read the book of
Jeremiah we discover that this great
prophet treats the subject of apostacy
"
[56]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
from a striking point of view. Jere-
miah deplores not so much the fact
that many of his brethren forsook the
faith of their fathers but rather the
fact that, the new faiths which they ac-
cepted were ineffective and inferior to
Judaism. Here is what Jeremiah has
to say on the subject of apostacy:
"For my people have committed two
evils: They have forsaken Me, the
fountain of living waters, and hewed
out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can
hold no water." Had the new faiths
which his brethren accepted been an
improvement upon Judaism the
prophet would not have said any-
thing, but since these faiths were far
from being an improvement, the
prophet felt called upon to condemn
his brethren in the severest terms pos-
sible.
History repeats itself. In our day
too the Jew is still in the minority and
[57]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
he is still imitating the majority. It
should therefore be no surprise to any-
body that apostacy is just as prevalent
among our people today as it was in
ancient times. There is no church or
denomination or religious movement
in which you will not find some Jews.
This is particularly true of all faith
healing cults. We live today in a nerv-
ous age and Jews in particular are a
nervous people. Centuries of perse-
cution and oppression have left scars
even in the souls of free and emanci-
pated Jews, and we therefore furnish
a greater quota to nervous disturb-
ances than any other group in this
country. Hence any religion which
promises happiness to unhappy people
is sure to attract large numbers of
Jews.
However, like Jeremiah of old, the
modern rabbi should deplore not so
much the fact that many of his
rss]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
brethren forsook the faith of their
fathers but rather the fact that the
new faiths which they accepted are in-
effective and inferior to Judaism. We
Jews consider ourselves specialists.
We do not claim to have produced the
world's greatest scientists or artists,
although we have made some contribu-
tions in these fields, but we do claim
to have produced the world's greatest
religious teachers. No religious move-
ment and no faith healing cult has as
yet enunciated any sound doctrine
which had not already been enunciated
by Judaism. That Judaism still en-
joys supremacy even in the field of
mental healing is evident particularly
from the contribution of Freud to this
subject.
Who is this man Freud? Sigmund
Freud is a physician of Vienna who is
considered the greatest psychiatrist of
modern times and perhaps of all times.
[59]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
His theories have revolutionized com-
pletely our knowledge of psychology.
No man has succeeded in probing into
the innermost recesses of the human
soul as deeply as he has. We Jews
should be interested in Freud since he
is not only a Jew but also a self-re-
specting Jew. He has for years been
a member of the B'nai B'rith lodge of
Vienna and he is also a member of the
Board of Governors of the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. However,
what is most interesting is the fact that
his theories are derived from Judaism.
He himself admitted that if he had not
been a Jew he would never have been
able to make his great contribution to
psychology.
The Freudian psychology is compli-
cated and it takes years of study to
master it. However, I shall attempt to
point out its main principles in a few
words. Freud is not a religious repre-
[60]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
sentative but a medical representative.
He and his disciples all over the world
have succeeded in curing thousands
of nervous people by a new method.
Freud claims that the methods
hitherto used for curing nervous
people have been false. Neurologists
have hitherto prescribed pills, electric
massages, or rest cures for nervous
people. These prescriptions have
proved ineffective because the nervous
individual is not sick physically but
mentally. He therefore needs not
physical medicine but mental medi-
cine.
The main trouble with the nervous
individual, says Freud, is the fact that
he is running away from himself. He
is confronted by an unpleasant past
which he refuses to face and this alone
is responsible for his nervousness.
The thing to do, therefore, is to make
the nervous individual see himself as
[61]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
he really is, and when this is accom-
plished he is cured. Of course to make
an individual see himself as he really
is, is very difficult, but through careful
application and with the aid of a good
physician it can be done. Freud and
his disciples have proved this time and
time again.
Now it should be of unusual inter-
est to the Jew of today that the old
book of Psalms has visualized both the
Freudian method and its difficulty. In
the one hundred and thirty-ninth
Psalm we find the following remark-
able verses: "Search me, O God, and
know my heart, try me and know my
thoughts; and see if there be any way
in me that is grievous, and lead me in
the way everlasting." These verses
are so simple that it is impossible to
misunderstand them. In the first
place, the Psalmist is convinced that
unless he knows his heart and unless
[62]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
he knows his thoughts he cannot at-
tain "the way everlasting," which
means that he cannot be happy. In
the second place, the Psalmist is con-
vinced that it is extremely difficult for
him to know his heart and his
thoughts. He therefore prays to God
to help him in a situation which he is
powerless to handle by himself.
The fact that the Freudian psy-
chology is derived from Judaism gives
the modern rabbi the moral right to
exclaim with Jeremiah of old: "For
my people have committed two evils:
They have forsaken Me, the fountain
of living waters, and hewed out cis-
terns, broken cisterns, that can hold no
water." There is surely wisdom in the
world for the Jew outside of Judaism,
but the point which I am trying to
make is that there is no religious wis-
dom for the Jew outside of Judaism.
A large number of Jews today are
[63]
MENTAL HEALING IN JUDAISM
afflicted with nervous maladies, but
Judaism has already long ago pre-
scribed the remedy for these maladies.
Of course this remedy is difficult to
master, but Judaism has never prom-
ised an easy life for the Jew. Nerv-
ousness is one of the most baffling
problems of modern life, but the Jew
should consider himself fortunate that
through his own faith he is able to
solve this problem.
