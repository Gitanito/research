the cytosine and the different aspects
of the DNA molecule they begin to switch
and fall off because it gets oxidated an
oxidation is a process where it&#39;s
exposed to the environment and living
tissue begins to just get corrupted and
breaks down now this is well-established
science that when you&#39;re dealing with
old DNA you cannot take that old DNA and
take those changes that are really the
degradation of the DNA and say that&#39;s a
mutation that caused a physical change
in the organism does this make sense
okay I&#39;m not wanting to get too
technical here because I know we&#39;re
talking not to a scientific public but a
general public but just imagine that
something&#39;s been laying around for over
a hundred years with the environment
decaying it and then a group of
scientists at Stanford and UCSF take it
and say voila we have found seven never
before before seen combined bone
syndromes
that resulted in this unusual creature
that looks nothing like a human being
and that&#39;s what they did that&#39;s what
they did and it gets more complicated
than that but I don&#39;t want to bore you
they basically took over a million
places where there were these changes
from the degradation picked 60 some of
them and head-on places that would
explain bone deformity and claim that
those were new never-before-seen
syndromes now this leap of conclusion
that&#39;s in the article which went
worldwide with the help of the
intelligence community I&#39;m going to get
to this in a moment so that was on the
front pages everywhere completely
submarined the idea that this could be
an unusual new species or specimen
notwithstanding the fact that Nolan and
his colleagues knew about the Russian
one notwithstanding the fact that dr.
Nolan himself told me that he knew that
the
that had been degraded out in the
environment would have problems in terms
of reaching these conclusions and in one
e-mail he says he would not reach those
conclusions in fact in an email dated on
December 30th of 2013 this on in this
email
he states that the chances these jeans
would come up by chance meaning of
mutation are infinitesimal infinitesimal
I&#39;m quoting well what happened well the
next thing we know he is not at all
talking he cuts off communication with
us and I&#39;m the principal investigator
who supplied him this sample and spent
tens of thousands of dollars to take a
whole research team over to Barcelona to
get the cat scans the x-rays the sample
etc and so on and he ends up joining up
with this group this teach to the Stars
Academy group with Tom DeLonge we&#39;ll get
to this in a minute and they facilitate
the global fake disclosure that this is
suddenly not couldn&#39;t possibly eat he
related that the case is closed as they
deformed human fetus here&#39;s the problem
with all of this is that the research
paper he put out is so dense and unless
you have a PhD in genetics you&#39;re not
going to understand it that&#39;s the first
thing secondly it appeared and got
through the peer review of genome
research everyone listening needs to
contact dr. Susman su SS ma m and she is
the editor of Genome Research and point
out that this paper according to the top
geneticists in the world should have
never made it through peer review period
full stop it would have gotten a zero
rating is what he has stated number
three
they cherry picked it&#39;s sort of like
Dick Cheney cherry-picking the
intelligence to put Colin Powell in from
the UN to say see he has weapons of mass
destruction let&#39;s go in there and have a
two trillion dollar war that kills
hundreds of thousands of people this is
the scientific equivalent of what Dick
Cheney did in in terms of data but
because of people&#39;s respect for that
Journal and the fact that the corruption
between the media and the intelligence
community facilitated this obscure
report on this obscure case being
headline front-page news worldwide the
whole world thinks the case is closed
when my friends the case isn&#39;t even
begun because there&#39;s another case it
has to be done we are calling for a full
investigation of Stanford UCSF Cold
Spring Harbor and Genome Research
magazine the process of how this made it
through peer review when this top global
scientist has said absolutely it should
never have been published and also how
was the data manipulated now last night
I received another report that where he
said that in talking to ten different
molecular biologists and geneticists not
a single one thought the paper had any
credibility now I&#39;m a medical doctor I
am NOT a PhD geneticists so I am relying
on these other experts but these other
experts are saying this is completely
without merit
now how does something without merit
make its way into one of the most if not
the most prestigious genetics research
magazine on earth how does that then
become front-page news on the New York
Times and CNN I think we need a full
investigation for the possibility now we
can&#39;t prove this of some kind of
deliberate act of corruption and if the
process
in academia on this has been corrupted
we are in very big trouble on this
planet because what that means is that
the tricks that were being done in the
50s and 60s which we&#39;ll get to in a
moment where the CIA and we can prove
this because we have documents under
FOIA request Freedom of Information Act
where that CIA deliberately has gone in
to academic institutions put people
under some duress for some reason and
force them to say and do things to
change the scientific opinion let me
give you one very famous example
probably everyone listening knows about
Project Blue Book Project Blue Book was
the kind of window-dressing research end
of the Air Force in the United States
looking into UFOs the real action was
going on and unacknowledged special
access projects which we expose in this
book if you haven&#39;t read this book you
must get it we are actually because of
this emergency this happened we&#39;re
putting this available for anyone to get
it half off on our website at serious
disclosure calm and if you get the DVD
that goes with this you can get this for
free so you need to go and get it and
read it and study it we don&#39;t have time
to go through all of that here today we
have so much material to cover but in
1969 the Condon the Air Force pretended
to have an object of study of UFOs done
where it was predetermined that the UFOs
were not real and the head of the
committee was a professor Condon at the
University of Colorado in Boulder he was
a renowned scientific figure he
assembled a lot of other very renowned
scientific figures that he but he made
one mistake
he got one honest scientist on his team
named dr. Robert Woods let me tell you
what happened and this is in the
disclosure material and you should must
read this dr. Woods was a senior
research aerospace scientist at
McDonnell Douglas
space which became part of Boeing a few
years ago but at that time and he worked
with and knew old man McDonnell
personally mr. McDonald and he worked
together but he so he was on this condom
committee and the Condon committee when
he started bringing hard evidence of the
facts and the truth
the professor Condon personally went to
the head of McDonnell Douglas aerospace
mr. McDonald to get dr. Woods fired and
and get him not only off thrown off the
committee conning committee but fired
from McDonnell Douglas because dr. Woods
had such integrity he was saying no
these are legitimate cases here are
actual photographs here are actual
videos here&#39;s actually places where
these have landed here government
documents and he was doing what I was
you know this is sort of 50 years ago of
course but and luckily the old man
McDonald was quite fond of dr. Woods and
said no I&#39;m not gonna fire you
and he kept him on but dr. Woods was
thrown off the committee the next thing
you know this fake committee headed up
by dr. Woods issues a report saying
there&#39;s nothing aren&#39;t real there&#39;s no
reason for the government to study at
less close Project Blue Book and they
use that report to close any government
official publicly overseen investigation
of UFOs what I&#39;m telling you is fact I
then after I personally briefed the
director of the CIA james Woolsey I put
in a FOIA request and I got documents
about the Condon committee and in the
CIA documents it explicitly says that
dr. Condon was working for them was an
asset of the CIA and that this had to be
kept away from the public knowledge
because if it was known it would be
create a public scandal now
why I am sharing with you here is not in
debate this is proven through FOIA
request these are official but the
government documents not ones that have
a questionable provenance or that
someone forged them these were
officially released I have them in my
archive though the question becomes and
this is a reason this is a question we
can&#39;t prove this yet is this what we&#39;re
witnessing Carol in front of our very
eyes this past week or two that we have
another situation of unbelievable
government collusion and corruption
resulting in what has happened to this
yes and then here and this is where I&#39;m
gonna connect the dots over the course
of this two-hour show I&#39;m trying to be
methodical in what I&#39;m presenting here
there is something very strange that
happened and at a certain point we got
we got an email from the director of and
this was actually on the blog of the
director of Sirius and I&#39;m going through
it from Kalika and about and he said
that states he says Gary no one dr.
Nolan was visited by agents from some
form this is not me saying this this is
Kalika from some form of federal level
he told me
on the record on a phone call which
federal investigators most likely now
have a hinder possession afterwards he
reversed his findings now he&#39;s working
directly with former CIA and NASA
experts in the UFO field on a
multi-million dollar project now this
was posted March 23rd 2018 the day after
this Journal report appeared correct
correct now I want to connect another
dot and this I&#39;m bringing this up I&#39;m
going to be careful here for legal
reasons I have a very trusted member of
my team who has been with me for a
couple years
who also works with senior military
officials in India and up to and
including the president the prime
minister he had a meeting with Tristan
Harris Tristan Harris is the who I have
also met with Tristan Harris is the
Harris as the Harris chair he&#39;s the head
of that trust that endowed dr. Nolan&#39;s
chair at Stanford University and Tristan
Harris had his conversations with my
colleague stated that the reason they
had to change the story on this was that
there was too much pressure that it was
too explosive that they were afraid and
what my associate said is that it was
quite clear there had been some sort of
threat or inducement to cause them to
not want to say what this skeleton which
anyone who wants to go on our website
and look at it well who is a doctor or
even a layperson will conclude certainly
is not a human will will say and
apparently this was of such great
concern but this contact flew all the
way from San Francisco after his meeting
with Tristan here
who&#39;s who&#39;s for whose trust is endowed
the Harris chair that dr. Nolan occupies
it&#39;s at Stanford and comes back to meet
with me in Washington to say something&#39;s
very wrong here and now this was about a
year ago or so before this report came
out the next thing I know which is very
concerned concerning to me I get
something from Jon Rappoport and Jon
Rappoport is an investigative reporter
who was drilling down on this strange
little group known as the to the stars
Academy that there was an aging rock
star named Tom DeLonge who who sort of
headed it up but he has apparently
become someone manipulated by many of
these people in the intelligence
community and this report goes through
who these folks are now let me just give
him the end and now we&#39;ve learned that
this dr. Nolan the Gary Nolan at
Stanford is a member of this team one of
them is a guy named Louise Elizondo he
was the Pentagon chief of a secret
program from 2007 to 2012 to study and
explore UFO activity of course it was
all couched as a threat and it was
funded in part by if the Pentagon our
tax dollars was twenty two million
dollars that then went to Bigelow
Aerospace some of it and he this
particular person Elizondo we did a
research on him a Senator John Warner
who had has been a member of the Cabal
keeping this secret he&#39;s now retired
he&#39;s 90 years old his son told me that
one of his closest friends who just
retired from the Office of Naval
Intelligence stated that Elizondo was
the master counterintelligence
disinformation person he had ever seen
at the Pentagon and he is the person in
the center of this to the stars Academy
group just giving you the facts so I
think what we need to do is stick with
Bax here now there&#39;s another man Jim
semi van he&#39;s from the CIA Directorate
of operations for 25 years
doctor how put-off has been working with
the National Security Agency General
Electric&#39;s Perry Stanford University
interestingly and SR I international and
regularly advises NASA and the
Department of Defense and the
intelligence community&#39;s Chris Mellon
he served 20 years in the federal
government deputy assistant secretary of
defense for intelligence and
interestingly is a descendant of Paul
Mellon who along with Allen Dulles
founded the CIA more about this later
norm Cohn who has has a 30 year history
with with the CIA and then you get down
to the second page of his report dr.
Gary Nolan and of the Ratchford and
Carlota a Harris professor in the
Department of Microbiology and
immunology at the School of Medicine at
Stanford and it goes on and on and on
and on and on very worrisome because
you&#39;ll know them by the company they
keep and what I&#39;m saying here is there
is this at the time that we handed off
this precious one-of-a-kind we&#39;ll never
get a sample like this again of the bone
marrow of this skeleton the atacama
humanoid to dr. Nolan he was
enthusiastic he reported to this top
geneticist that there were of amazing
findings that 90% of the DNA didn&#39;t
match to humans which is much much less
than a chimpanzee or a gorilla and the
next thing you know he&#39;s on this
Advisory Group chock-full of
counterintelligence spooks CIA people
Pentagon people and then all of a sudden
after five and a half years of the delay
this report goes into the world&#39;s most
prestigious genetics gern
and gets headline news all over the
place saying case closed
there&#39;s nothing to this this smells like
the Condon committee it feels like the
Robertson panel now what was the
Robertson panel a little bit of history
in the 50s we have documents a whole
sheaf of documents from the FOIA
requests from the CIA that we did that
describe the Robertson panel being a
1950&#39;s iteration of this process where
they talked about engaging scientists to
hoax UFO events and photographed them
later come out and prove they were a
hoax but make them look like actual UFO
pictures and things that are being
reported by the public now this is not a
contested document either so this kind
of corruption of academia and then
collusion with big mainstream media
outlets which as you know from the Air
Force intelligence officers reporting in
the movie and the book unacknowledged
States very clearly that this they used
to carry bags of cash I&#39;m quoting the
Richard Doty said point blank we would
carry bags of cash to affect the outcome
of a story or to get the cooperation of
these editors and national security
correspondents at the national media in
the United States so that there is no
question that the media has been
corrupted by the these illegal
unacknowledged special access programs
and that the Fourth Estate is dead
some years ago in the 1990s I met with a
guy named Bob Schwartz he was on the
board of Time Life magazine and he said
to me he says dr. Greer we have become
scribes taking dictation from the right
hand of the king that we absolutely have
no independence when it comes to
something this explosive and that the
the fourth the state the press is dead
on this and what they will only report
what the intelligence community tells
them to read
port and that is what everyone listening
though that needs to know is what&#39;s
happening in real-time in front of our
very eyes
so you don&#39;t have to go back 60 years to
the 50s or 50 years to the 60s this is
happening in front of our very eyes
today so that&#39;s why I wanted to be on
your show to give you this big picture
of what&#39;s actually going on now
I also have a document that&#39;s called is
in our art on our website called media
play from the CIA and I&#39;ll hold this up
this is an official document from 1991 I
hope you can see it and they have some
things blackened out on it like the
 always do but one of the
interesting things it says it says we
have relationships with reporters from
every underlying their emphasis major
wire service newspapers news weeklies
and television networks in the nation
this United States for the CIA this has
helped us to turn intelligence failure
stories into success stories and has
contributed in many instances we have
persuaded reporters to postpone change
hold or even scrap stories that could
have adversely affected what they wanted
to public to know so this is this is
what&#39;s more interesting and a proposed
to today is there&#39;s also somewhere in
here the one there&#39;s one that has the
same thing it says about academia this
is under be in the same CIA document I
held up current program the agency
meaning the CIA has a wide range of
contacts with echo academics through
recruiting professional science
societies excuse me contractual
arrangements and OTE we have recently
have been designated the focal point for
all information about CIA&#39;s relations
with the academic
immunity and that we are engaged in
recruiting scholars in residence etc
this this is very concerning this paper
states point-blank
we&#39;re corrupting academia now just so
you know it is illegal for the CIA to do
anything in the United States that would
be the FBI&#39;s domain and here we have
documents talking about the corruption
in the media and academia and in this
case this this poor little Atacama
humanoid case we have we have a headline
news all over the world here&#39;s the LA
Times saying case closed
this six-year-old 6-inch creature is in
fact a fetus that we aborted
this is unbelievable scientific
misconduct
