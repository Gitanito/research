A woman hovers above her own lifeless body, detached and at peace, before moving through a dark tunnel toward a dazzling light. 

Whether a believer or a skeptic, chances are you recognize the standard markers of a near-death experience. But in 1975, when Bruce Greyson was a newly minted psychiatrist, this was new terrain. 

At the time, Greyson was working in UVA's emergency room with a psychiatric resident named Raymond Moody, who had just published the soon-to-be-runaway bestseller, Life after Life, in which Moody coined the now familiar term &quot;near-death experience&quot; (NDE). 

Greyson, who was already exploring brain-mind anomalies, became fascinated by the countless letters Moody received from people relating to the surprisingly consistent reports of what clinical death survivors   recalled about their flat-line time. 

&quot;They were astounded and often relieved to find out they were not alone,&quot; he remembers. 

Almost three decades later, Greyson, 57, is still fascinated. This director of UVA's Division of Personality Studies began a new project earlier this year designed to verify reports of out-of-body NDEs. Greyson, in collaboration with UVA cardiologists, is conducting an investigation that focuses on patients receiving automatic heart defibrillators who must endure a brief cardiac arrest to ensure that the units are functioning. 

Wearing a conservative yellow tie as he leans back in his chair, Greyson says there's nothing to report yet, but he smiles and mentions he's considering extending the two-year study. 

&quot;Bruce is a very careful, cautious researcher,&quot; says Dr. Michael Sabom, an Atlanta-based   cardiologist who also studies near-death experiences. 

Greyson points out some of the anesthetics used on the cardiac patients interfere with memory, so he rigged a computer to generate images visible only from the ceiling. 

&quot;If people can remember what's going on,&quot; Greyson says, &quot;then that's very hard to explain.&quot; 

Scientifically proving NDEs' occurrence, however, is not what most interests Greyson as a psychiatrist. He's excited by how near-death experiences change people's lives. According to Greyson, near-death survivors share no distinctive traits prior to their NDEs, but afterward they generally become more spiritual, more altruistic, and less materialistic. 

Having pioneered a path-breaking study of suicide survivors who reported having NDEs, Greyson discovered that, unlike other failed suicides, his subjects were   less likely to repeat their attempts. According to Greyson, &quot;What they tell you is once you're not afraid of death, you're not afraid of life.&quot; 

Unaware of any chemical capable of creating such a life-altering effect, Greyson suggests NDEs have important implications for psychiatry, noting, &quot;We work very hard for a long time to make very small changes.&quot; 

Has his research has affected his own outlook? &quot;It's given me a different perspective on what's important in life,&quot; Greyson says. &quot;It's also made me a lot less willing to dismiss crazy ideas out of hand.&quot;
