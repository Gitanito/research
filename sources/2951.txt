Why Our Planet
Suffers Earthquakes”
BEING THE EIGHTH OF
The Galahad Lectures
HE GALAHAD LECTURES constitute a great
curriculum of information on the Unknown
Esoteric History of the Earth, from the time of
its conception as a planet, up through the Edenic
period when the first forms of human life exist­
ed under the Great Water-Veil, into the Ante­
diluvian world with its strange civilizations, and through the
Atlantem and Egyptian epochs into the modern Christian.
C These Scripts comprise the Instruction given as part of the
Lecture Courses of Galahad College Summer School held in
Asheville, N. C., in the summer of 1932 and have been recorded
and preserved in this form for students of the Foundation Fel­
lowship. C The Foundation Fellowship is a nation-wide as-
sembly of Metaphysical Students, sacredly searching for the
true fundamentals behind life in Mortality and for accurate
knowledge of the soul’s enhancements in octaves higher than
those of earth.

EIGHTH LECTURE
HERE is so much that is vital, and I need not
add, of tremendous dramatic interest, in this
particular sequence of our instruction, that
time after time I am puzzled over an appro­
priate and adequate selection of the matter
which is available to include in these papers.
My solution of that quandary to date has been
to choose only those phases of enlightenment
that might be called units in, or steps upward
toward, an understanding of the complete
cosmic picture that is being painted for our
profit. It has seemed essential, in giving an interpretation of how this
planet on which we are working out so many problems, got its ma­
teriality—its crust, its water conditions, its stellar peculiarities—to
dwell for at least one discourse on phenomena that have come
periodically when certain natural processes have matured according to
immutable laws, causing disturbances of the earth’s crust affecting hu­
man life disastrously. I refer of course to earthquake disturbances,
volcanic action and tidal waves.
Now if we wanted to view the drama of Natural Processes from the
standpoint of one little earth life, I would quickly agree with anyone
who chooses to maintain that the Almighty has fallen far short of
creating “the best of all possible worlds.’’ It is manifestly unfair, in
the orthodox point of view, for any individual to be bom in an area
that is subject to periodic catastrophes and cataclysms, and for the
hand of an angry God—through no obvious fault on the part of that
individual—to reach out and put an end to his life. Such a God would
3

be cruel indeed, if we were to consider one little envelope of flesh, 0r
one little physical mechanism, or one little span of existence as a
sentient being, as being all of life that came to him throughout all
the aeons.
When we glance at the hypothesis of life as being a cumulative series
of existences, however, each giving something of eternal value and
enhancement to the soul, then the effects of great mundane alterations
are understandable. Moreover, what matters it how many individuals
lose their lives—or rather, their physical bodies—or how often it
happens, since in a handful of years, or a handful of centuries, they
will be right back in flesh, undoubtedly in a less hazardous environ­
ment? True, they may be shocked at leaving any one life in so drastic
a manner. On the other hand, the supposition is that they knew sub­
consciously in advance, how they would quit life, and when, and that
each came into his particular body, and into an environment thus
hazardous, because it meant a quick turmoil and passing, that likewise
was part of his lesson to be learned.
We want to remember that eternity means eternity! When we realize
that we have all eternity in which to live, and that there is no such
thing as death, in the sense of perishing, we are not spiritually ap­
palled at thus changing bodies, since each change profits us somehow
or we would not consent to make it.
So when we grasp the whole eternal program, these catastrophes are
but the workings of natural and beneficial laws. As such they are
not concerned in their effects on the individual. Rather, the individual
adhpts himself to them. If he gets the experience of erasement inad­
vertently, he will come directly back and finish the program to which
he set himself long, long ago in the beginnings of his functionings of
spirit. if
God has laid down certain laws for this universe that have everything
to do with the conduct of spirit as evolving Consciousness. It is the
essence of such evolution, that spirit conform to the workings of these
laws. Let us keep this always in mind, not only in this brief instruc­
tion which touches the high spots of cosmic illumination, but through­
out the years that lie ahead.
For if you get this program of cosmic law and the delineation of
cosmic principles, into your consciousness, it will be for all time. It
will be the basis of your character, temperament and instincts, in the
Thought-interims and the Life-sequences that may be lived, down a
million years. This is not food that is picked up cafeteria style and
4
that does not stay by us. We are considering and attempting to digest
cosmic fundamentals that should perform a one hundred percent
metabolism within our spiritual bodies, supplying the mental blood­
stream with rich nutriment and making permanent stamina on and on
through the life cycles ahead of us, into glory. Now then—

1our last Lecture I halted in the middle of an exposition
about our modern “shanty civilization.” I mentioned
that down in South America the Incas built their roads
a thousand miles long, ballasted by three feet of rock,
with retaining walls eight feet in height and thickness.
But the Incas were not the only people who sent a record
of their superior culture down to posterity. Consider the pyramid
builders. The Great Pyramid in Egypt contains stones weighing 500
to 800 tons each. These stupendous masses of rock were leveled and
fitted together with the precision of an oculist’s fitting the bifocal
lenses of one’s glasses. Modern engineers have no machinery to even
begin to lift such tremendous weights.
We go to New York, crane our necks at the Empire State Building
and accept that we are clever people architecturally and financially,
that our engineers should erect a building so beautiful and so high
above the metropolis. But in the last analysis, it is only the
height of that structure that impresses us. There is scarcely a feature
to recommend it aside from such height. It means the congestion of
human beings into a vertical space that accomplishes nothing but an
inflated evaluation of the ground space on which it stands. Moreover,
one sizable earth-shake would turn the streets about it into a dump of
bricks and mortar fifty feet deep. If Manhattan Island tilted, or was
bombed by an enemy, it would become but a mass of steel ribs stick­
ing up against the heavens, as rakish and impotent as the ribs of a
mastadon.
We are building nothing for posterity. We care nothing for posterity.
We are not even thinking about posterity. We are not allowed to think
about it. We are encouraged not to think about anything. Our maga­
zines, our novels, our dramas, our moving pictures, are all shaped to
anesthetize our thinking equipment under the guise of diversion and
entertainment. The trend of modern education is toward propaganda
that would make automatons of us, that atrophies instead of creating
initiative. If we had been trained to think, to reason out the “why”
of things, to realize that for every human problem there is a human
5
solution, this so-called economic catastrophe would not have occurred
We should long ago have possessed ourselves of the knowledge that
would have forestalled and circumvented it. The interests and forces
that precipitated it, could never have brought it about. We are being
fed a perpetual program of superficialities, not only over our radios
but throughout all departments of our lives. We are so obsessed w
ith
the “Bigger and Better” slogan that our entire psychology of living
has become hysterical.
Nowhere is this motif of hysteria more pronounced than in our archi­
tecture. Buildings are erected today on the acceptance that they w
ill
be pulled down in thirty to fifty years. Look at the structures erected
sixty or seventy years ago, particularly throughout the South. They
are old-fashioned, out-of-date, in most cases monstrosities. Go out
through the American Southwest and look at the adobe huts of the
New Mexican Indians. Those of you who have traveled over the
Sante Fe Trail by Pullman or motorcar remember those pathetic piles
of sun-dried earth in which human beings exist in unutterable squalor,
presenting twisted windows and sagging eaves. You have probably
asked yourselves how mortal people could ever spend their lives in
huts made of mud. And all the time, back here in the East we have
come from structures likewise made of mud, only the mud is dried in
separate cakes and put together with mortar. These buildings, despite
their surface beauty, are nothing but piles of mud-cakes called bricks.
In fifty years, or even less, they will be senile yellow in color with the
mortar dropping from between them.
If the “ancients” had had occasion to erect an auditorium devoted to
purposes of education, they would have made its walls three feet thick,
of enduring granite. Its architecture would have been of such beauty
that it would have been acclaimed down a hundred generations. Only
an earth disturbance of cataclysmic proportions could have toppled it
earthward. And its size would probably have been commensurate
with its beauty and durability.
The whole cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris could have been put into
one wing of the great Hall of Karnac without one stone of Notre
Dame’s touching the walls of that Temple!

ttfKHEIN the last great water ring fell, precipitating the Flood
of Noah and submerging ancient Atlantis, humankind
perish with that continent a knowledge of great
saw
earth processes and particularly a knowledge of earth-1
crust movements that dictated the locations of great
cities and communities, all of which had to do with the
permanence of buildings that sheltered humankind. The true loss in
that catastrophe was academic more than material.
Mankind lost perception of the fact that one of the worst things that
can possibly be done architecturally is to build cities either on a flat
open space or along a water course, both of which performances are
exactly what we moderns do in the ignorance of these, our Dark Ages
of the present. We, knowing little of terrain processes and encouraged
not to know because it would aggravate a “needless public fear-com­
plex,” look first for level ground when locating a village, town or city,
in order to effect economy in construction. Our second stipulation is,
that such a community shall be adjacent to a body of flowing water,
either to provide us with a drinking supply or to carry off sewage.
Both of these practices are heavy with jeopardy for the future citizens
of such communities.
In the first place, flat land is always land whose underlying rock prisms
are merely caught together and held temporarily by lateral pressure
against their edges, or it is resting on a subterranean layer of igneous
or aqueous material and sooner or later it will rise or fall. The world’s
most disastrous earthquakes usually come to cities that are located on
steppes or plains. Rare indeed have been the earth-shakes in steep
mountainous country, as I expounded in our previous Lecture. There
the rock prisms have been heaved up and fallen back into arch forma­
tions. The harder the jiggle the tighter they have pressed together,
and the safer is the terrain in consequence. Out on the vast level
spaces between such mountains, the land is loosely knit in its rocky
substrata and resting on oceans of fiery or watery material far, far
down in the vitals of the planet. A heaving or a sagging may come
at any moment.
In the second place, building cities beside flowing-water courses is
building cities along active earthquake faults, since water courses are
usually the residue of watersheds made by the land’s collapsing or
pitching downward in a V. This V may extend for miles and deploy
into open country. No matter. Where subterranean prisms have
pried apart, or the earth has opened in fissures, water either gushes up
or runs downhill and fills them. Then that water seeks its level, and
assumes a flowing motion that eventually ends in a sea.
So in our modern ignorance we erect structures that are essentially
mud-brick shanties on the precarious areas, and when earth processes
exercise we call God very harsh and wrathful for “taking great tollof
human life.’*
Knowing the alternative, is all a part of the enlightenment which w
e
must regain from “lost” civilizations. Eventually we must go back
to the architecture and building locations of the Lemurians and Al­
lanteans. We must discard our erroneous ideas of economy and erect
our homes and public edifices after the manner of the hillside con­
struction now so prevalent in California. Hillsides are part of the key­
stone arches which the subterranean prisms have formed, as the
earth’s crust has been pushed up or crumpled. They are the safest
places on which to build that the earth’s crust provides—if they be not
merely alluvial material that has been washed down from loftier
heights and that tend to give the general outlines of such mountains
the soft contours so often comparable to Hogarth’s Line of Beauty.
On a flat plain, whether it be the comparatively narrow space between
two mountains—known as a valley—or whether it be the alluvial
sediment that was once the bottom of a sea or lake, as we have from
Ohio to Colorado or on the Siberian wastes, the smooth level sections
are all accumulations of subterranean rock prisms. They are resting
on something beneath. They may be composed of fragments of meta-
morphic rock—great masses of gravel that are slowly changing into
stone, due to the silicons mixed in their substances—or they may be
composed of huge concretions of pre-Laurentian granite and basalt
that have been shoved up from primordial strata. None the less, they
are but a great floor without proper shoring beneath it to permanently
hold the weight. In time, as the substrata readjust themselves to sus­
tain that weight, they will sag or give. Then great buildings w
ill
topple, pinning people beneath them, or rivers will alter their courses
and drown vast numbers by flooding.
It is the distribution of alluvial material over the prism surfaces of such
a prairie, that fools us so tragically. Take a cross-section map of the
United States that shows the Allegheny Range at the right and the
Rocky Mountain Range at the left. In between there is a far-flung
space known as our Midwest prairie section—the bed of Lake
Agassiz—mentioned in our last discourse. We have a span of flat
country, therefore, where competent geologists can trace the course
8
of the sag, the Mississippi River naturally presenting its lowest point.
The erosion of wind and rain has washed a stupendous amount of sedi­
ment over this sag. We see it in vast sweeps. We call the landscape
a thing of beauty. And all the time it is analogous to an ugly stretch
of undeveloped real estate, or a quagmire that has become blanketed
over with a fall of winter snow. It looks substantial. It has exquisite
surface lines. But to venture upon it means disaster.
We all know the treachery of such areas or localities to the feet. A
back yard in the autumn is an accumulation of the summer’s debris.
Discarded garden implements are scattered around. Perhaps there are
sunken wells or old cucumber frames contributing to the jeopardy of
the one who would cross it. Some autumn night the snow comes
down, the snow that in Vermont we designate as “sugar snow’’—after
the huge velvet polls that descend in sugar season. That back yard is
transformed into an expanse of loveliness. But that does not alter the
fact that the rubbish is beneath it, that the tines of an upturned rake
may puncture our boots, that the cucumber frames may collapse or
the buried log trip us. Or the thin boards over the old well-hole may
give way beneath our weight and precipitate us into its depth.
N our far-flung prairie sections, alluvial material has over
the ages taken the place of the back-yard snow. Sedi­
mentary material covers up all visible breakage in the
earth’s crust, burying the scars of what happened when
the crust was heaving or buckling but leaving subter­
ranean fissures that may yet “give’’again. If you will
refer to a cross-section map of the United States, you will observe in
the lower parts of the mountain regions, that which is called foothill
country. Frequently a formation not unlike a series of terraces can
be discerned, mounting one above the other, or back from one another,
until the real mountain-height is reached. These terraces, although
they too may be smoothed off by erosion of alluvial material, are but
areas that have risen or fallen like a table top as the substrata became
adjusted beneath them in the vicinity of those ranges. At the edge of
each one of these terraces the geologist perceives an earthquake fault.
Sometimes these areas are completely surrounded by faults.
One of the peculiarities of this rising and falling of tablelands into
terraces, is the number of springs that have resulted. And yet the
cause is not so hard to recognize. Our rivers have found beds along
the lines of least resistance, as I have said. That is, they have taken
9
the tilting lines of the fissures. They, like the springs, have result^
from the upward hydraulic pressure of rock-prism lands suspend^
over or lying upon subterranean water courses. When the land sag8
or sinks, this subterranean water is forced upward. The amount o
f
this subterranean water existing under our feet is appalling to con.
template. Our earth is about 8,000 miles in diameter, and yet the
mean depth of all the oceans upon its crust is only two miles.
think we have a lot of water in our oceans when we get on shipboard
and spend five days going to Europe or eighteen days going to the
Orient. But two miles out of 8,000 is but a trifle. The amount of
water which this vast subterranean area has imbibed and is now con­
taining, is greater than all of its surface water by hundreds of tim
es.
Out in the vicinity of Louisville is Mammoth Cave. We walk for
five miles under the surface of the ground, as I once did, through what
seems to be Dante's Inferno lacking the fire and demons. Tourists
make the circuit of this stupendous vault with constant exclamations
as to how wonderful it is. Many people in our party going throughthe
cave thought me guilty of irreverence when I constantly demanded:
“W hat’s particularly wonderful about it?’’ It looked spectacular and
it felt dramatic to walk on the bed of what had once been a subter­
ranean river. But after all it was nothing but an underground passage
for water that had washed a burrow for itself. The thing that m
ade
it dramatic, was the revelation that all the rivers of the world might
not be on the surface, that streams could actually find their way
through the bowels of the earth and scarcely see daylight till they
spilled into the sea. But why, pray, should all streams be on the sur­
face? Mammoth Cave was and is just one passage out of thousands
that have been washed out in the substrata of the earth’s crust and
which cure or have been filled with swirling waters which mankind
knows nothing about. The wonder on the part of the tourist probably
lies in the fact that there are earth processes going on of which hectic
and puny mortals on the surface know little or nothing. Man in his
bigotry is surprised that it is possible.
The subterranean water that bored its way through the ground and
created Mammoth Cave doubtless came from earthquake fissure ac­
tivity. At one point we climbed a crude ladder through a vertical
opening that hardly admitted our bodies. In other words, we went up
through an old fault that was still sagging open. But there was not
half as much “wonder’’ about a lot of rock’s tumbling apart, or being
burrowed by a river that has now run dry, as there is in the birth of
10
an oak tree in the springtime out of an acorn that fell to the ground
the previous autumn.
Our entire Midwest prairie section seems to rest on foundations far,
far down in the bowels of the earth that are no more stable than a
water-ocean in the open would be. This has been proven by a study
of earthquakes, time and time again. Those of you who have had any
access to books on geology must be familiar with the long series of
crust displacements, risings and saggings, that have occurred even
within the history of modern man. In and around New Madrid,
Mississippi, in the winter of 1811-1812 as I have said, the earth-shaking
went on for four months, ere the floating alluvium-covered rock-
prisms found substantial foundation.
UCH rising and falling types of movements have been
continual ever since the earth’s crust became cool enough
to have any weight at all, or to film over the mobile ma­
terial encased beneath. The constant pressure of new
substances falling to the ocean beds as the arctic ice-caps
melted, has made internal heat, which has resulted in
sidewise infusions of fiery or molten matter. These infusions, brought
about by terrific hydraulic force, have pushed the rock ledges above
them, up toward the surface, and in the pushing have broken them to
fragments. Then too, there must have been parts of the earth’s crust
where the precipitation of cooling water has resulted in the same sort
of snapping and breaking that comes when a piece of ice is applied
against a hot lamp chimney. Alter the temperature of molten ma­
terials too suddenly, and there is a contraction that means a spider­
web cracking of the surface. A score of causes have contributed to
the pulverizing of the earth’s original crust. Due also to the peculiar
action of subterranean waters in the whirling earth-globe, not to men­
tion molten material sloshed about by the spinning of the planet, and
the pulling-away influence of the moon and other heavenly bodies,
the breakages in these prisms seem to have come in lines. These lines
uniformly run from northeast to southwest, or southeast to northwest.
And, I repeat, you cannot travel over ten straight miles of the planet’s
surface without crossing one of them or perhaps a dozen.
Geologists, knowing this, but knowing also that humanity has always
built its cities either on level sections or near water courses and cannot
transfer them at a wave of the hand, are inclined to keep silent when
1
1
asked if such-and-such a great city is “safe.” No city is entirely^
that is not built on a mountain or on the side of a mountain.
We know that we can trace a gigantic crust fissure up the Atlantic
Coast from approximately Macon, Georgia, to a point in M
aryland
just west of Baltimore. Philadelphia, Trenton, New York, N
ew
Haven, Providence, Boston and Portland, are all built along that fault
There is another major fault that seems to begin at a point west of
Newfoundland and go westward up the St. Lawrence to Buffalo, C
leve-
land, Toledo, Detroit and Chicago, “running out” somewhere in
Nebraska. I mention this not to alarm anyone needlessly. I amnot
pronouncing forthcoming doom for any specific city. We know that
cities have been built on prairies that have existed undisturbed for
centuries. But ultimately there comes a change, when the precipita­
tion of alluvial material has created a weight that is greater than the
substrata can endure, or when there is an alteration in the fiery or
aqueous matter below. The whole area that is over the mobile sub­
strata will respond to readjustment, perhaps for hundreds of m
iles.
That readjustment may be effected vertically or sidewise.
When a fault is located in a vicinity where mining is carried on, it is
possible to go below the surface in a bucket and make an analysis of
the constituents of the strata, noting the various metals and minerals
as they have been laid down, one upon another, or have cleaved apart,
disclosing or identifying the various rock prisms broken up through
the ages for what they really are. If a great mass of igneous rock is
pushed up through sedimentary rock, the grinding or pulverizing is
plain and the fault dislocation is all too apparent.
NOTHER planetary disturbance, frequently making for
great loss of life, comes in the form of oceanic tidal
waves. These waves, dashing against shores that show
faults, are too frequently misunderstood in their signifi­
cance by laymen, again being attributed to a wrathful
or neglectful Almighty, when a very mediocre geological
alteration is in progress. Tidal waves may come from a submarine
volcano, or crumpling of the ocean's floor, or from some unusual con­
junction of neighboring planets, most often the sun and the moon.
All of us are aware of the influence which the moon exerts on normal
sea water. Not all of us are aware of the tremendous weights which
shores frequently have to bear when a tide above normal comes crash­
ing against them. There are sixty-two and a half pounds of weight for
12
every cubic foot of water in the oceans. This means by simple
arithmetic that a tidal wave a mile square and ten feet above normal
smashes a weight of nine and one-half million tons against the strata
composing the shore. The tidal wave that swept over Maya, in Central
America, on the sinking of Atlantis, is reputed to have been 65 feet
high. This means that a weight of water approximating 61 million
tons to the square mile was dumped over the junction-area of North
and South America. Is it any wonder that the whole terrain of
Qentral America was altered by that cataclysm?
If any such weight of water, moving at such a speed, were to come
out of the East and strike the Atlantic Coast fault today, the result
would be appalling beyond all reckoning. The so-called Atlantic Shelf
from Boston down to Savannah, would never be able to withstand
it. We know that a few years ago the bed of the Atlantic off New­
foundland took a drop deeper into the bowels of the earth and has
not yet been located.
But none of this has to do with any temperament of the Almighty,
exercised either for or against humanity.
These are natural processes following natural laws as immutable as
the melting of snow from our pastures in the springtime. It is hu­
manity’s portion merely to become wise in them and act adroitly in
the face of them.
We do know that even at present, tremendous alterations of terrain
are under way. At the time that the Atlantic’s bed off Newfoundland
went down to an unplumbed depth, a portion of old Atlantis west of
the Sargossa Sea rose toward the surface. Off the eastern coast of South
America there has appeared a series of islands never before charted.
Off the western coast of South America and Lower California, por­
tions of Old Lemuria have come so close to the surface in recent years
that the United States Navy canceled its ship maneuvers in that vicini­
ty in order that naval vessels might not run aground in battle practice.
Too often we accept that because we live a small span of life-—cos-
mically speaking—without any type of catastrophe’s afflicting us out­
side social upsets analogous to the world war, that we dwell upon a
fairly stable planet. We should keep ourselves in a more malleable
state of mind. Or rather, we should view the planet for what it is:
a cooling ball of molten material whose interior is still in a state of
flux. We lull ourselves into a false sense of security, and when read­
justment matures we are unprepared to meet it and as a result plunge
into panic, ii* t?
1

Let us keep mentally elastic, therefore. Let us make one of the fund*
mentals of our Christian Behavior, elasticity of mind in regard t0
worldly alteration. Nothing is permanent but change! As we pro}*
deeper and deeper into human consciousness we find the need isover,
whelming for a realization of the imperishableness of Life. And
must paint a convincing picture to the society to whom we m
inister
that a just God would not “let” the earth’s great cataclysms happen
unless He had made some provision for those who may be temporarily
damaged or demolished by them, to continue their earthly existence.
Otherwise He would doubtless have found some other process o
f
projecting and perfecting a planetary body that serves as the stagefo
r
the spiritual drama.
OW tragic indeed is life for those who are not yet aw
are
of the fact of returning to earth-life again and againtill
the earth purpose has been completely served! I claim
that the hypothesis of earthly revisitation, ignoring for
the moment all evidences of prenatal memory, is anes­
sential corollary to Astronomy and Geology. We can­
not understand one without the other. Earthly life becomes m
ean­
ingless without such hypothesis. We meet men and women by the
thousand who will have nothing to do with religion—not that wew
ant
to make them religious but we do want them to understand the things
epitomized by religion—because they refuse to worship a God w
ho
lets a world war or a San Francisco earthquake happen. We m
ust
get it across to them that God doesn’t “let” these catalysms happen,
as I said before.
The psychology to adopt is, that this earth has been projected accord­
ing to a definite plan or program of natural laws, and that those law
s
must work in proper cycle of event. At a certain time after a spirit
nebula starts whirling, a core of solid matter must form. At a certain
time all gases, water and the lighter minerals and metals must be
thrown off by centrifugal force into a ring system around that core.
At another later time, these telluric rings must commence to fall upon
that core and build it up. At still another later time all the rings and
canopies of matter must be down upon the new planet’s surface.
Weight must make pressure, pressure must make heat, heat m
ust
cause expansion, and expansion must send carbon and igneous matter
into the skies, to be returned again and again as mineral and m
etal
strata. All the water rings and canopies must come down too andbe
14
absorbed, with a gigantic hissing, into the thirsty surface, and as the
water gradually wins that fight, various forms of vegetable and animal
life must manifest. What matters it if in these cycles, various forms
of physical bodies perish? Life itself can go on and on, indefinitely
and inextinguishably. Thus the Continuity of Life makes provision
for the possible tragedies resulting from the dispassionate play of great
planetary forces. With this fact as the key, God takes on a mightier
significance in His divine considerations for the races of men im­
prisoned on the planet’s surface. The orthodox person, ignoring or
refuting earthly revisitation, indirectly depreciates the Creator’s be­
neficence, even castigates Him for having produced a world where
periodical catastrophes terminate human life mercilessly. The story
of the Flood, for instance, as recorded in Holy Writ, is naught but a
libel on Divine Providence.
OW MANY times water rings and water canopies came
down upon the surface of the earth, producing new ad­
justments of terrain, new tidal waves, new deluges, we
have no means of knowing. But we do recognize that
over countless ages inexorable processes have been go­
ing on, and will probably continue to go on until the
earth becomes a cold dead cinder idling through Space, its mission
finished and its momentum spent. The very fact that these great
cataclysms come at stated times, should force us to investigate the
Almighty’s alternatives to the destructive effects of them on human
life in sentient species.
Certain types of people there are who follow these great planetary proc­
esses with keen interest, only to decide that it is naught but supreme
conceit on man’s part that he should believe that they serve his evolu­
tion. What bigotry, what bombast, they decry. But those who per­
mit these colossal studies to react so upon themselves, are thinking
of the human species as a biological exhibit with two arms, two legs,
a head and a torso. They overlook or ignore the spiritual side of man
and his potentialities for transcending all these cataclysmic processes.
Ifthe mind of man can transcend the smallest atom of matter, or exert
control over it, the mind of man can exert control over a planet or
even over an entire planetary system. That being the case, then plan­
ets themselves, despite their size in comparison with man’s physical
organism, are subservient to him. And being subservient to him,
1

they can logically have been created, for his purpose, evolutionary ^
otherwise. i? it*
As the Great Teacher has put it: “Is not a man greater than a star?
Are ye not greater than many stars, beloved, being Sons of B
ene,
faction?’*
Man needs an arena for his spiritual evolution, a classroom in circum
­
scription that he may know lack of circumscription for what it is. H
e
attains this awareness by deploying in physical form on the planet’
s
surface. There are great forces that have proven their existence again
and again, Behind Life, who could disintegrate this planet by a m
o­
ment’s thinking—or send it crashing into another heavenly bodyand
put both out of existence. The fact that they do not do this, postulates
that the planet was created for spiritual man’s habitation and naught
else. 5# t?
Earthquakes happen, tidal waves flow, mountains move, plains rise
and fall. What matters it? The Spirit within us, the logical reasoning
minds that can absorb and interpret these planetary processes, had
no beginning and can have no ending: exactly as the Great D
ivine
Cause that wrought the planet into being, is eternal.
We cannot study Astronomy, or Geology, or Anthropology, or any
great evolutionary denouement in Nature or Spirit, without finding
that all resolves down to this: the development of the self-awareness
and self-control that men and women are perfecting through rela­
tionships with one another as they come into, and go out of, life on
life. t?
HERE Life came from, how it got upon this planet inits
rudimentary forms, how man-life first appeared and
started to exhibit, will be the subject of our succeeding
Lecture. We shall see that as each of the stupendous
vaporings slid north and south in ceiling canopies, and
gradually came down at the poles, they brought dow
n
with them forms of life that propagated upon the planet’s crust. N
o
study in creation is more profound or enthralling than this. But m
an,
apparently, did not appear here through that type of galvanism. M
an
came to Earth as Spirit, even as one day he will leave this point in
space as Spirit and take up a higher form of manifestation. M
an,
however, as an anthropological exhibit, is earth-bound. As Spirit, he
is everything but the evolution of the physical plan itself. He came

This is the hardest item we have to grasp. I have never seen the es­
sential you. You have never seen me. All I have seen of you is
your body, your outer shell. A ll you have seen of me is the sheathing
1 may have worn each time I came to earth. I am reminded of the
poem called Gnosis which expresses the idea in rhyme far more aptly
than I can put it in prose—
17
Thought is deeper than all speech,
Feeling deeper than all thought,
Souls to souls can never teach
What unto themselves was taught.
We are spirits clad in veils,
Man by man was never seen,
All our deep communing fails
To remove the shadowy screen.
Heart to heart was never known,
Mind with mind did never meet,
We are columns left alone
Of a temple once complete.
Like the stars that gem the sky,
Far apart though seeming near,
In our light we scattered lie
All is thus but stardust here.
What is social company
But a babbling summer stream?
What, our wise philosophy
But the glancings of a dream?
Only when the sun of love
Melts the scattered stars of thought,
Only when we live above
What the dim-eyed world has wrought.
Only when our souls are fed
By the fount that gave them birth,
And by inspiration led
Which they never drew from earth.
We, like parted drops of rain,
Swelling till they meet and run,
Shall be all absorbed again,
Melting, flowing, into One.

yet it is also declared in H o ly W rit, “N o M an hath seen G od at any
time.” From the spiritual stand p oint o f essen ce as w ell as works,
both are correct and neither is a paradox.
No man has seen th e an th rop om orph ic G od, and neither has anyone
seen the Spiritual G od , for Spirit can n ot be seen . It can only be dis­

Let us keep mentally elastic, therefore. Let us make one of the fund*
mentals of our Christian Behavior, elasticity of mind in regard t0
worldly alteration. Nothing is permanent but change! As we pro}*
deeper and deeper into human consciousness we find the need isover,
whelming for a realization of the imperishableness of Life. And
must paint a convincing picture to the society to whom we m
inister
that a just God would not “let” the earth’s great cataclysms happen
unless He had made some provision for those who may be temporarily
damaged or demolished by them, to continue their earthly existence,
Otherwise He would doubtless have found some other process o
f
projecting and perfecting a planetary body that serves as the stagefo
r
the spiritual drama.
OW tragic indeed is life for those who are not yet aw
are
of the fact of returning to earth-life again and againtill
the earth purpose has been completely served! I claim
that the hypothesis of earthly revisitation, ignoring for
the moment all evidences of prenatal memory, is anes­
sential corollary to Astronomy and Geology. We can­
not understand one without the other. Earthly life becomes m
ean­
ingless without such hypothesis. We meet men and women by the
thousand who will have nothing to do with religion—not that wew
ant
to make them religious but we do want them to understand the things
epitomized by religion—because they refuse to worship a God w
ho
lets a world war or a San Francisco earthquake happen. We m
ust
get it across to them that God doesn’t “let” these catalysms happen,
as I said before.
The psychology to adopt is, that this earth has been projected accord­
ing to a definite plan or program of natural laws, and that those law
s
must work in proper cycle of event. At a certain time after a spirit
nebula starts whirling, a core of solid matter must form. At a certain
time all gases, water and the lighter minerals and metals must be
thrown off by centrifugal force into a ring system around that core.
At another later time, these telluric rings must commence to fall upon
that core and build it up. At still another later time all the rings and
canopies of matter must be down upon the new planet’s surface.
Weight must make pressure, pressure must make heat, heat m
ust
cause expansion, and expansion must send carbon and igneous matter
into the skies, to be returned again and again as mineral and m
etal
strata. All the water rings and canopies must come down too andbe
