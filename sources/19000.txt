hello everyone my name is Marcel Peter
Beck and I&#39;m grateful to have had a part
in this great documentary I just
finished watching the movie and Wow it
was very powerful and I hope it&#39;s
inspirational to those of you who had
never experienced or been exposed to
contact it&#39;s not just about vacuuming
crafts from other parts of the universe
but it&#39;s about establishing direct
communication or those st. Jim beans on
board that can be profound and
life-changing and self empowering in
other words you can stop the domination
as taking place for so many years and
you yourself can become an ambassador to
earth and help transform this world to
one piece in abundance so go out under
the stars and develop you everybody can
share Thank you very
just watched the movie again just an
amazing film thank you Steve and Emily a
beautiful job I know this was a labor of
love for you guys you did a beautiful
job
it&#39;s unpossible ii and people are gonna
love this and for anybody who is
interested in higher states of
consciousness this film has is just
chock full of information you know I
thought I would share something that
happened it&#39;s kind of appropriate
because it happened the last on the last
ce-5 the last night of the CD 5 and it
was after everyone had gone to bed I
think Steve I shared this with you but
not many other people sorry those are my
birds in background everyone had gone to
bed it was about 4 o&#39;clock in the
morning and I decided I would meditate
you few more minutes before I went to
sleep and as I sat there on the side of
the bed ready to meditate about 5 or 6
glowing orbs of light appeared on the
other side of my sliding glass door that
door was probably maybe eight or nine
feet from where I was sitting
beyond the glass doors were
I do and in the desert beyond which
leads to Joshua Tree so I realized that
these were beings outside the glass door
I immediately invited them in and
invited them to be in whatever form they
felt comfortable and with that just that
thought they were instantly this side of
the door in the room just hovering there
maybe eight or nine maybe a foot above
the ground
just hovering there and they were a
beautiful bluish white like the energy
that emanated from them was just full of
love full of friendship a little
curiosity probably curiosity on both of
our parts but I thought I would share
this information because it was it&#39;s
very appropriate it was the last CD vibe
that we did there last night
so I hope everybody enjoys the movie
I am honored to have been in it I thank
you I thank you Kevin in Cornwall new
Kia thanks for your video it was amazing
lots to think about cosmic consciousness
meditation the whole story of your ce-5
