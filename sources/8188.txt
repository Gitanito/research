  		              		Experience Description   

    My brother was sleeping on the adjacent bed, and my parents were sleeping in the next room. The room was well-lit because a street light was shining in the window.  I tried to go to sleep, but couldn't  because my heart was hurting a lot. It felt like  it was working  with effort, as if there were some weight on it.  I did not attach a lot of meaning to this pain. I thought that I would simply fall asleep and by morning it would all pass. I was lying on my back,  trying to breathe calmly. 

  Then  I felt  weightless and was floating upward. I watched as I  gently began to exit from my body. My Spirit looked like  dense fog. I felt and knew that I was coming out of my body because my heart was not beating and my body was not breathing. At first, I wasn't afraid. I was just experiencing leaving my body. But then I understood that if I  left my body completely and entirely severed the connection to it, then I would not be able to return to it. I wanted to visit my parents, flying to them as a Spirit, but I understood that they would not be able to see me in this state. I knew  that my voice was part of my body and not part of me. A body can't call out when it has no breath. I felt regret that there was so much I had not done and that I was leaving so soon. I started to think about how I could return to my body before the final connection  was severed. I decided that I had to  force my body to breathe. I felt that if I summoned the strength from  my Spirit  and directed it at my body and  commanded my body to take a breath, that my heart, having received oxygen and the strength of the Spirit's energy, would start to beat. It took tremendous effort to force my body to take a breath. I remember that I was concentrating only on this and was commanding my body to take a breath. During this I was strengthening this command with the will of the Spirit. 

  After some time, it worked. My body took a sharp breath and my heart starting beating. I slowly and gently started going back into my body. I felt fine,  calmed down and fell asleep. For a long time, I could not tell my parents about this, because it was so hard to talk about. It was different from what they taught in the Orthodox church. Memories of the event are still like a surprising, unexpected experience in the human body.

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Jehovah's Witness

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     It did not correspond with the teachings of the orthodox church  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I did not believe in the existence of the Spirit before

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes.     We each have our own goal and mission. But, we are all united by a single goal  to make the world better for the Good of the Universe  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         I was uncertain if an afterlife exists.     I was distinctly aware that the death of the body is not the death of the Spirit  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     we all arrive with a concrete goal, each with our own.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes.     In the Spirit world there is no envy,  lies, aggression, or malice. We treat one another with unconditional love.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I understood that the Spirit is what's real. The body is temporary. With time, I remembered how I first entered into my body, through the body of my mother, when the embryo of my earthly body was in my mother's womb. This does not happen at the moment of conception, but at the moment when the body of the child is formed, but the heart is not yet beating. And just then, the powerful energy of the soul entering the body causes the heart to start up and begin to beat. I remember being in my mother's belly and the feelings I had. I also knew what my mother was feeling and what she was doing. I told my mother about this and she confirmed it. I have started to have extra-sensory perception and healing abilities. More than once I have had premonitions of events that came true. My Spiritual vision is getting stronger.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It's just the life of the Spirit, outside of the body this is normal  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Healing abilities, clairvoyance, lucid dreams, Spiritual vision have become stronger  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I understood who I really am.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Several years have gone by. It's hard for them to believe.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   I am not sure if I knew something about it.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     Because when your Spirit leaves your body, there's no mistaking it  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     It was a real experience  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         A person continues to think and understand everything in the same way as during life. Only a more expanded understanding of things. We need to show more love toward people
