   This, like its predecessor of the same name in Chicago in the 1860s, was an offshoot of the lyceum education movement of the mid-nineteenth century, as adapted to spiritualism.  The spiritualist lyceums functioned essentially as "Sunday schools" for members of the established spiritualist churches and groups, especially children, proclaiming itself "The only paper in the world devoted to the children of spiritualists."  This journal provided regular district and local reports on the doings of the Lyceum Union in Britain and came to carry crosswords and other puzzles and featured "Our Kiddies Corner" for young children.  Florence Morse was the daughter of J.J. Morse, on whom see the note under The Spiritual Review.  In its later years the journal was a valuable source, in its memorials, for leading figures in the Lyceum Union and spiritualism in Britain generally.  LOC; BL; NSAC Lily Dale.
