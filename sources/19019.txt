this is mount shasta
it&#39;s 14 000 and some feet so volcano
although allegedly dormant
and
we&#39;re out there
doing these contact protocols and
suddenly
i&#39;m pointing i didn&#39;t want to hit it
with my laser
this object appears
again it can sometimes make a comma
motion
that it&#39;s in the field so i tell people
at that point they&#39;ve arrived the
detectors begin to interact and then
they&#39;ll de-materialize
but we&#39;ll go into the dimensions of
consciousness and see
see who they are and contact them this
is an interesting object because it came
over
not a falling star
and look what happens at the very end of
it
let me blow it up
there&#39;s not a falling star
reminiscent of the object that came in
at the beach that went wrapped around
the peruvian doctor
unfortunately we were it got ice and
kindness came in this is not a moon look
at this how beautiful but the lens it
was about 22 degrees 24 degrees
uh and the lens camera uh froze over
with the ice
people go guys you go out in that
weather i said yeah this was in the
summer
but you&#39;re up at seven eight thousand
feet
yep
look at all these objects
this is a beautiful object this is
reminiscent of the crop circle the cubic
forms of the crop circles that same year
and an object comes in just like that
one the one you saw earlier and it makes
this beautiful geometric shape that&#39;s
kind of
woven cube
at the base of it
this is not a falling star
i assure you
here&#39;s another one of these objects that
comes in right in front of the trees a
few feet from us lights up
and when you see that you go they&#39;re
here
now the people say well why don&#39;t they
just fully materialize and come out and
walk around well it&#39;s very dangerous for
them to do that
and if they&#39;ve come this far through
trans-dimensional space-time and from
other galaxies they expect us to be
awake enough to go into consciousness
and then commune and communicate with
them
when they&#39;re dematerialized right in the
field they do these events just to let
us know that they&#39;re very close
now this is amazing because people lived
at mount shasta many years and
will live there for years and never see
it every time we go this happens
so these objects are emerging up at
about 13 000 feet or close to 14
and this is not this is a star this is
out coming out of the mountain
and it is a light ship coming out of
this the crystalline deep formations
within
mount shasta very trans-dimensional
the one that lifted up and flew off to
the left i showed you earlier
was actually in the field with us this
one is actually emerging out of the
mountain
we have a photograph i&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll be
in this series where there&#39;s about a
dozen of them
this is a glacier
very steep vertical
yeah it is almost as if
one of the brightest stars in the sky
emerges on the side of the mountain
and comes out and begins to communicate
with us in consciousness
you know it&#39;s interesting they chose
that area
there&#39;s an uh i had i have some night
vision scopes that are much better than
the ones we&#39;re filming with and you can
actually see the terrain and the
vertical
area and it&#39;s coming straight out look
at how bright it is
isn&#39;t that beautiful
you guys should go take your groups up
to mount shasta
it&#39;s up at the near the oregon border in
california
i&#39;ve done many expeditions there the
problem is
we it&#39;s hard for us to find a place to
do our contact work there
that will hold all of us
this one&#39;s going on
and then this comes in right in the
fence look
boom
very close to us
so they&#39;re here here and then they&#39;re in
our consciousness watch this there it
goes
now these light craft and beans that
appear very quickly it&#39;s reminiscent of
when i interviewed the police and the
military in
belgium during when they had all those
large triangular crap being seen
and the part of the report that got left
out
is that they would de-materialize and
form just a a sphere like this and then
shoot off into space
and go straight out into space
so this is also very late after there
are there are no satellites
and it
it&#39;s interacting with us again
and you can hear the detector just went
off
blue blue
we&#39;re up at a site at about uh seven or
eight thousand feet when this happened
very clear air
gorgeous
but cold
you need six layers of clothing and this
is in september
early september i believe
beautiful
and then it
you can see
it doesn&#39;t move it just disappears
this got pixelated we&#39;re trying to zoom
in
it&#39;s beyond the camera this was a is a
night scope
monocular third generation hooked to a
digital camera
another object
right outside the circle
sometimes there&#39;ll be a scatter of these
and when they scatter
it&#39;s an area where
the area is being activated as it were
this is mount shasta&#39;s in the fog
it&#39;s going straight up
yeah
mount shasta is almost like one of the
chakras of mother earth
beautiful
it was going up came up from the volcano
going up
a golden
object in the north field here
i&#39;m talking about a golden object
arrived in the north field
and then the camera captures this yeah
right here
so with these nice scopes you can&#39;t see
color
but
uh
many of these objects they arrange for
every color of the rainbow
these look like discrete lightning bolts
in a small area
these happen very frequently coming into
this dimension
so we need to um
of course
we can&#39;t i don&#39;t know if we can
skip forward to the next series
uh it&#39;s actually a video and it&#39;s not a
chapter thing
all right
all right
this is a planet
this is not
so one of the things that that most
people don&#39;t realize when you begin to
practice the ce5 protocols
is that you have to have all your senses
on this is just visual there are tonals
there&#39;s sounds that are coming in may or
may not get recorded and there are also
even
smells
you can actually sometimes you&#39;ll smell
like carnations or roses or
very very bright
emerging
bless you
then towards the end of the night what i
always ask people to do is to connect
everything that we&#39;ve seen
and the intelligences within them the
people within them and invite them to
come into your dream time
and since there&#39;s really no barrier to
space and time
right now you can go back in time to
this event connect to those beings and
ask them to come in to dream time with
you tonight here
you understand
that this is these are just ways to
awaken the mind and remind you they&#39;re
never
very far away at all
when you begin to realize that
interstellar civilizations are not
required
to appear the way hollywood would like
for you to imagine them
then and you begin to understand all the
different ways they can manifest like
this
you can go out and with a completely
open mind
experience their their presence
there has never been an expedition in
the 25 years i&#39;ve been doing this where
something new that i&#39;ve never seen or
experienced hasn&#39;t happened
so i don&#39;t know if you can fast forward
is there a fast forward function on that
in the interest of time
the reason we&#39;re having oh here we go
we&#39;ll see
we&#39;re and we&#39;re on another
on the west coast of florida
near mark on marco island we&#39;re on a
state beach
and all of a sudden these very strange
objects start appearing everywhere
you can probably just fast forward on
this because it&#39;s really very
interesting to
see there it is look
right there
it turns out on this one particular
night there were 300 of these objects
seen
and they&#39;re actually lighting up
the mangroves
we&#39;re looking towards the gulf of mexico
this is a lagoon
that you have to walk through during the
day if you want to go out to the ocean
and we&#39;re on a sandy beach
this is beautiful
what is this
we take a photograph there&#39;s it&#39;s a
little out of focus we&#39;re just starting
our meditation and a brilliant object
flashes but what the camera captures is
this
this is the ocean
the edge of the ocean is out beyond
these mangroves this is sky these are
stars and this
it goes all the way
twice as far as this
and it&#39;s almost like a rupture in
space-time with all these objects that
appear over the ocean very near us
and everyone is in meditation you can
see
so you can fast forward this to the next
you can just fast forward through these
oh go back oh well
that&#39;s all right go ahead
yeah yeah
look at this one moving
really bright one
so you can fast forward it some more
i mean
you get the idea the kind of phenomenon
this is a collection that
oh we can go back to this crest stone
beginning of the crest stone one there
we go
now that we&#39;re again is very strange the
tibetan prayer bowl
is the arrows in the wrong place
and objects begin to show up around us
and we&#39;re in in this sandy
area on my land
in colorado
and this is one of the stranger things
that have happened
we&#39;re in a circle these are the same
there&#39;s a still a camera very high
resolution and this
looks like a blue
beam appears between two people
and you&#39;ll see this again at mount
shasta
in a moment
this is one of my favorite this is
coming straight up people the native
peoples reported this for centuries
this is an object here&#39;s our circle
this object comes up
and stops right here right in front of
us a light ship
the local ranchers will see these
objects coming up from the earth and
they call them cheap fireworks
and they&#39;re actually a deep underground
in the earth e.t
spacecraft that come in and then launch
up
this is me
right here
and out here on this part of the baca
the desert there&#39;s this reddish
object that appears
right at dust right at dusk
and this is beautiful we&#39;re breaking up
this is where we put sherry&#39;s ashes on
my land
and there&#39;s this gorgeous burst of
energy and light right beside it
we went out earlier to set up before the
group and i started sensing there was a
golden ship and i pointed over in the
meadow just like that picture in england
and this is sitting right on the land
right on the edge of the stream here
nothing over there there are no houses
no cars no roads
and it&#39;s just coming up from the ground
luminous
it&#39;s a ship sitting in the field
oh it seems so frozen
maybe the end of this tv i don&#39;t know
the end okay so let&#39;s
um do we want to stand and stretch what
time is it
okay so why don&#39;t before we put the next
ones in why don&#39;t we take a stretch
and about a 20-minute break is that good
and we&#39;ll come back are you guys
enjoying this yeah okay we&#39;ll have we
have more so we&#39;ll continue so you can
put the lights up
and we&#39;ll see you in about 20 minutes
we just have about uh maybe
uh 30 more minutes of images if you can
bear them do you want to see more
all right and then we&#39;re going to do
question and answers and then it&#39;ll be a
wrap for tonight so
i don&#39;t know if everyone&#39;s in yet
so folks uh people who are on the staff
if you can go out and gather folks
around and ask them to come in quietly
we&#39;re going to go ahead and get rolling
uh webinar folks ready
yeah
so this is a continuation uh
of some images
we may fast forward through a few for an
interest of time
yeah yeah i&#39;m ready
let&#39;s go
don&#39;t you hate computers you&#39;re so slow
and stupid
the reason we&#39;re having a problem we
usually use
dvds uh because computers really are
very poor quality for this
and but the hotel didn&#39;t provide a
remote
so there was no yeah for the dvd player
so i didn&#39;t
discover that until we were about ready
to start and no one knew that they
didn&#39;t provide one
and i do apologize there&#39;s a little bit
of technical problems here
this again or not too long ago 2011
object that comes you can see the
mountains is not something in the sky
it&#39;s very close to us again
at our contact site
now the dark object is because the
camera got kicked over and that&#39;s dust
don&#39;t be
it&#39;s nothing interesting
but the abdo this luminous object is
right here
this is pretty interesting because it&#39;s
a tr three objects in front of the
mountain
another it&#39;s a theme that keeps
recurring
this was fantastic unfortunately the
night vision camera didn&#39;t capture it
no satellites up this object with the
nice scopes i have that are much better
than these that are connected to the
camera you could see a perfect c-city
triangle
floating across so it was three spheres
connected by bars floating across
the sangro de christo mountains
interestingly after this and not too
long ago in the midwest one of our teams
had a knight scope that captured a sea
city triangle that flew right over and
turned you&#39;re going to see that in a
moment
which would which actually see the shape
of it this unfortunately it was so
bright that this particular resolution
on this camera and knight scope
did not permit the the
discernment of the actual
structure that this was in the
atmosphere
not too far away and fully materialized
and then go to the next one
i guess you can&#39;t fast forward or go to
the next
this is magnificent look at the size of
this object right above the mountain
look at the size of this
so this
this is what you think it is look at the
shape and the size it is a craft that&#39;s
actually hovering there that unveils
itself comes into this dimension and
then recedes
does that make sense
so you need to look for these when
you&#39;re out
so let&#39;s go to the next
this is an object right in the tree
where sherry&#39;s remains
the ashes are
look how close it&#39;s maybe 20 feet from
us
oh this you can skip over this this was
on the other disc and you move through
these
as that object again is magnificent but
you just saw it
yep
this is interesting because this is
again another year at shasta we&#39;re
across the valley from the town of mount
shasta up on the other side and suddenly
all these objects start appearing coming
out
this happened for several hours
and then there are still photographs
you&#39;ll see
of these beans that are
around us by this huge log house that we
were using
um
i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in this series at
one point there was a gigantic
arcturine type being a mesomorphic that
was about 12 feet tall
that was just outside the group
partially in this dimension
this is very jerky this is why you can&#39;t
really use computers computers are very
poor
video as you know
yep it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s glitching but there&#39;s
a whole group look at all the ice and
snow this time this year
and these objects are coming out
there&#39;s a road down here what you want
to be and someone walks right in front
of the camera
there yeah here they&#39;re coming
i don&#39;t this is pixelating and breaking
up digitally i apologize uh
there&#39;s no probably nothing we can do
about someone else walks in front of the
camera
memo to participants do not walk in
front of the camera when a contact event
is here&#39;s one way up here in the snow
field see this one
so they begin to emerge all over the
mountain eventually there are about a
dozen of them oh yeah it&#39;s back it&#39;s
back
here there two here one here
and then there was the one up here
and soon you&#39;ll see it unfortunately
this is jerking along the actual video
is really excellent but um the computer
is chewing it up
oh there&#39;s one way up higher
often they&#39;re in volcanic areas because
in those
mountains are very very large
crystalline caverns where they can
reside
and also they&#39;re monitoring geophysical
activity
in the event of instability
so
you look way
there&#39;s more
it keeps then they get brighter and
bigger and brighter it goes on and on
and on
some of them are huge
so these are
some people lived in this area their
whole lives and never seen it we&#39;ve
never gone to mount shasta where these
beings and these craft haven&#39;t emerged
out of the mountains
and it&#39;s all has to do with the
consciousness of the of the group
look at that one magnet it&#39;s like a
giant star coming emerging out of the
mountain
yeah it really this is way far away this
is a 14 000 foot mountain so the size of
this object is substantial this is a
huge mountain
it&#39;s not a
speck of light
so these are
light ships that are emerging out of the
mountains really bright and there&#39;s one
straight above now you&#39;ve seen the ones
that flew up and flew out in the space
these are ones that are just coming in
and out materializing dematerializing in
and out of the mountain
and this happens in uh
all over the earth actually underwater
as well someone at the break was asking
me
hopefully still images will be better
look at this it looks like a an uh it&#39;s
a bean
and almost like a uh
this is this is
a and it&#39;s
yeah
it&#39;s between two people just coming
almost like a jacket but it&#39;s it&#39;s
barely in this dimension it comes in and
out of this dimension this is no flash
bulb this is there luminous
you know it&#39;s partially this is an
infrared shot in the middle of the day
and this object comes in we have the
camera set up and it picks this object
up
that&#39;s a sphere it comes up where i&#39;m
meditating
in the morning
because we get up around 11 or 12
before noon because we&#39;re up till 4 in
the morning
and here&#39;s this object
then this
the following night an object comes and
appears right in front of the tree
and is materialized right in front
visible to the naked eye
this is a plane
now this is beautiful
there are all these beautiful lavender
objects come up over my heart chakra
this is a gas tank
but
and but this is not my laser my laser&#39;s
in the pocket this thing that looks like
a laser is coming from space and comes
down
and look at this and pause this for a
moment
this is
what happened with this is worth
describing it looks like a abstract art
this is an actual photograph of what
were seeing with the naked eye so after
that contact event happened and there
was an et that was in the middle of the
circle we heard footsteps outside the
circle in the direction of this
and i went out and i had my hands out
palms
facing out and with my third eye my
heart and my two palms made
a
tetrahedral shape connecting to those
beings
and
suddenly
the entire area was suffused in
millions and millions and millions
of
multi-colored beautiful lights it was
like swimming in an ocean
of celestial light
and it was all around us
it was people were weeping it was so
celestial it was definitely
extraterrestrial with the level of
celestial energy and it came into this
dimension
and
just from the point of view of art this
is so beautiful unfortunately the
computer has kind of ruined this but
it&#39;s actually much clearer you see the
actual photograph
so
what can happen is that they can create
an environment
where they come in and you then find
yourself walking in an ocean of
scintillating light
and their essences are all around you
and what i felt was that every single
one of these
emanations
was a representation of a different
species from a different star system and
it&#39;s as if you were walking through
stars that were conscious and it was
like an ambassador flotilla a point
subconscious like at the almost a causal
astral interface that came into the
dimension of earth it was so stunningly
beautiful
okay next
oh dear maybe that&#39;s the end of it
okay so those now this next little dvd
unfortunately i haven&#39;t seen and it was
fedex and it came in last yesterday so
uh from a team member who was assembling
some and so were we guinea pigs together
all right
i haven&#39;t seen it hopefully there&#39;s
nothing
but i i i i it should have some very
interesting
here we go
many of you have seen this about a five
minute event this is what the
debunkers on youtube have said is a
uh
flare
so it&#39;s dark dark at night it&#39;s in the
winter nine o&#39;clock the sun sets at five
and
what happens
is
really astonishing because first there&#39;s
this one massive golden ship and then
another one and they&#39;re there and there
is a very stiff third 20 30 knot wind
coming out of the north and they are
stationary
definitely are not flares but
that&#39;s what they&#39;re explaining just like
the phoenix lights also were now this
here you have another person who should
be down
uh
and
this is one of them and in a moment
you&#39;ll see another
the experience of this was really
beautiful because
it looked like the sun coming up at nine
o&#39;clock at night
and it wasn&#39;t something that came up
actually it was just appeared and was
stationary
and you can see the cloud being lit up
and the wind&#39;s coming very very very
strongly
from this direction so someone said oh
well it&#39;s a special flare on a parachute
another person said
well it&#39;s just a regular flare
but so look at this one and
it&#39;s what you think it is and
but this went on for about five minutes
and they were very bright beautiful this
is a camera the sony as7
that you can adjust it so at night
you&#39;re filming in full color like night
scope
pretty pretty amazing technology
so daniel who&#39;s on our team in toronto
was the camera guy for this
and
it was quite cold that night we were up
by the dunes and not further out by the
ocean because the wind was brutal and it
was in the 30s i think this is florida
in the winter
and but quite cold
now if you were to put up a flare
in a 20 30 knot wind
believe me when i tell you first of all
you see a smoke trail even if it was an
electronic flare on a little parachute
which is what one debunker said it would
be moving at at the speed of the wind
obviously and if the grant at the ground
if it&#39;s 20 or 30 knots when you get up
higher it&#39;s going to be much
more wind as you know as you go up you
catch more of the winds because you
don&#39;t have any break
a windbreak from the land and structures
on the land
but
we were connecting with these two and
it&#39;s almost like two eyes you feel like
you&#39;re look having a two a being
with two eyes and they&#39;re sort of
recapitulating us staring at them and i
felt they were looking back at us and
connecting i was asking people to go
into this deep state of consciousness
and connect with them
have you have most people seen this
before
yeah
but i wanted to
yes well people get excited and you know
they want to stand up and it&#39;s
understandable but it&#39;s
people are trying to
and they go there and then eventually
they just
go away
in spanish
first this one and then
and then this one
so we had a guy who who was actually
uh
it was a navy guy
and he said this is no flare but
other people said well the military was
just playing tricks on you and of course
you can always claim that basically with
your if you&#39;re there and you&#39;re you&#39;re
feeling it
and seeing it and when you see it with
the naked eye it&#39;s even more
effecting than when you see it through a
camera
and then they they go away
goodbye
beautiful
these are some clouds here
and that&#39;s a star that&#39;s my laser
pointing out where they were
i don&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t edit editing
is really important because here we go
oh this is the same object this is a
still still photograph and they have it
looks like it&#39;s daytime you see the
stars this is great still photography
it&#39;s a man a psychiatrist who&#39;s on our
team and he lives in montreal had a
really wonderful camera set up look how
crystal clear
these are
so they&#39;re not
and by the way we i had i have a a
fourth generation knightscope
binocular military grid you have to fill
out the homeland security paperwork to
get them
and there were no aircraft anywhere in
this area and no ships
but still they say it was either dropped
from an aircraft or came up from a ship
even though there are no aircraft there
and there are no ships there
but the beautiful photography by this
gentleman
this was at a
park on the ocean near up where we had
engaged a house
an oceanfront house to meet in for the
week last year
was it last year year before anyway in
the last two years
now you can see it with a less high
quality camera
yeah this is a
a very inexpensive
digital camera
same event
and also not on a tripod obviously
yeah
still
now i&#39;d like to in all these cameras
there&#39;s no smoke trail there&#39;s no
parachute they&#39;re they&#39;re not blowing
down wind and there are no other ships
or aircraft around
and this went on for quite some time and
the experience in the cir in the in our
circle and on the beach and what
happened later that night
uh
when people went back in the dream time
after the the session
people had extraordinary contact events
with these interstellars
the ets
so we can fast forward to the next
and you can go past these
it&#39;s the same same event
you get the
picture oh here we are
oh this is interesting
oh there&#39;s some this has just happened
in september i haven&#39;t seen these yet
september 5th a few months ago
look at how gorgeous oh and we had a
it&#39;s a calibrating camera and
again no flash ball but there is this
blue orb and this gorgeous light and
it&#39;s where we had people had seen this
object flash in and out
i think there&#39;s this one is
this the triangle that flies over
as transparent ufo
these two objects from see everything is
stationary
these two
are flying synchronously together see it
right here
there it is these two
no satellites
in the area in that area
they&#39;re very close you can see how
bright they are there&#39;s a lake here
and they get brighter a little bit of
jerky camera work but they&#39;re doing the
best they can
uh on september 11th 9 11 interestingly
look at the date
oh there&#39;s another event this is the
golden ship that went from east to west
this is another event and it was truly
golden
beautiful color
it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s living too and
spinning look at it carefully you see
three see the sections of it it&#39;s like
it&#39;s it&#39;s not just it has like three
components
coming soon
i&#39;m not sure what that was
anyway i guess he&#39;s wanting to be a
filmmaker
here we are
this is where we&#39;re going to be in may
up in oracle in arizona
and in the edge of the field
this multi-colored gorgeous there&#39;s
nothing there
emerges and uh comes very close to us
and here&#39;s another one this is at night
but it&#39;s just the
it&#39;s all it&#39;s made and look at all the
light within it
no well
no
this was uh in australia and it was an
infrared specially adapted camera
and we start having all these amazing
objects
occur
also not artifacts by the way
i am not sure oh look at this this is
the one this is the sea city triangle
look at it look at it go
in and out of the clouds
oh i was hoping you&#39;d crop it and zoom
in on it
and we need a good film guy michael
beijing
let&#39;s do michael
oh this is another
fly-in by kindness
it&#39;s blue-white
if you were to see it with the naked eye
one of the wonderful things about the
if you get one the apps for your
phone or your ipad or
just print off a satellite chart
it&#39;ll it
if you&#39;re out late enough it depends on
the time of year
there&#39;s a time where there are no
satellites visible
and so
when they when these events happen after
there are no satellites
it rules them out if it&#39;s during that
time when there could be satellites
you&#39;ve got to check the satellite charts
so we go to the next one
oh i don&#39;t know where this is
oh this may be portugal this is not
labor labeled i don&#39;t believe
is it plain
yep
well must be something there let&#39;s see
you got a counter
oh
oh there&#39;s an object here that came and
went i don&#39;t know if you noticed from
one frame to another
it&#39;s still there
so let&#39;s go to the next i think this
must must be frozen no it&#39;s just slowly
doing like a few seconds
oh yeah
yeah it&#39;s going up
it&#39;s quite large this this ship

this is not a satellite and not an
aircraft
i&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t put on here okay
that&#39;s great thank you we have lights up
did you enjoy those huh yeah okay well
that gives you some idea
one of the things that happened in
portugal we had the pooja set up in the
in the center
and the very last night we did the puja
and one of these uh objects
appeared over the puja table
and
the you know the orange that i put on
the tray
dematerialized from one frame to another
and moved back to where it was before i
offered it before the puja witnessed by
everybody
it
left the spot and went
i&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t include that and
then we took a picture of the group
behind us
where these beautiful light being like
columns of light beams
all around us
that was in one shot no flash bulb
beautiful
