Scenes which I recognized as being from my youth, etc. being vividly portrayed - really in a continuous (sometime circular around the small light) fashion. I frankly thought that I was dreaming (being in the hospital bed) and was consciously trying to analyze what was happening. I thought it was an unusual dream with a very weird format (circular boundary). I mostly stopped paying attention to what was being portrayed and puzzled about the strange format. After what seemed a considerable time, the tunnel collapsed inward and the light exploded toward me. 

This apparently was when the code team shocked me. I then awoke to find twenty to twenty-five people (code team) in my room, and immediately realized what must have happened. Because of the potassium deficiency, when I was revived, my heart was beating with an abnormal rhythm, and I kept slipping into unconsciousness. I was placed in a medial coma for eight to ten hours and the potassium deficiency was found and corrected. It was probably at least five to eight minutes from the onset of ventricle fibrillation until I was revived.
