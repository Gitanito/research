  		              		Experience Description   

    I was waiting for hip surgery while on the operating table. I was talking to the anesthesiologist when everything went dark. The lights came on and the operating room was empty. I couldn't figure out where everyone went. I got off the table and headed for a door. I pushed open the door and fell.

  I landed on grass and found myself in Willamette National Cemetery in Portland, Oregon. I was wearing a hospital gown and I couldn't understand why no one could see me. I started to walk over to one of the shelters where funerals take place for veterans. I noticed a large gathering was taking place. I walked over and  could see my wife and my step-daughter crying. I started to freak out as I realize it was my funeral. I tried to get their attention but there was no sound; it was absolute silence. Then, everything went dark again. 

  This time I could see from a different angle. I  watched my parents arguing in a room. The room had concrete blocks for walls that were painted white. I couldn't exactly hear what was being said but it almost seemed as if I was in my mother's womb. I was being presented with various scenes that seemed to go on forever. (I'm going to save this part for a book.) At the end, I became woozy and blacked out. I woke up in a chair. There was a woman in a nurse's uniform with a dark blue sweater who was standing  in a dark room. She started to talk to me but her mouth wasn't moving. She told me that I was being sent back because iIt wasn't my time yet.

   I blacked out again and then  woke up on a couch. I couldn't move. Later, I realized this must be part of my coma experience. This went on for a while. Then, I saw this really bright light as if I was looking directly at the sun. I opened my eyes and my wife was crying while holding my dog tags and my hands. She could barely get the word out as she said, 'Hi.' The doctors explained to me that I had a massive pulmonary embolism and an ischemic stroke. I had stopped breathing. I was at the  Veteran's Administration and  had to be rushed to a medical university hospital so they could  perform open-heart surgery to remove the blood clots. I barely survived what is called a Widowmaker. Now, I am fully recovered. The doctors told me that  I am  a medical marvel.
