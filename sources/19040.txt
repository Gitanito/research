even though what I&#39;m doing with ce-5 is
when I&#39;m most ridiculed for it was the
project that got the most respect and
attention from the intelligence
community because they knew it was real
they knew the science of consciousness
is real they knew that these et
civilizations utilize communication
technologies that interface with thought
and telepathy and consciousness they all
know this this is an open secret in the
intelligence community we all think that
power is derived from your weapon system
your financial clout the usual
materialistic paradigm the reason that
the deeper elements of the intelligence
community have this intense interest in
it and don&#39;t want the public to know is
that first of all it is extremely
efficient spycraft which they don&#39;t want
others to have secondly they know that
if people understood the power of
consciousness and of mass consciousness
they would be able to completely change
the direction of the planet that is to
me the big secret most people have heard
of the random number generator studies
through the global consciousness project
a question tonight can you actually
measure the emotional outpouring in a
worldwide crisis some tightest think
that they have done just that their
machines and computers found a bizarre
pattern right after several global
disasters this was an experiment in
which researchers placed dozens of
random number generators around the
world and analyze their data to see if
they could discover anything about
global or collective consciousness on
September 11th a few hours before the
first plane struck this network of
random number generators became more
coherent less random and more coherent
it may sound bizarre but dr. Nelson and
his team have been at this for the
better part of a decade the first spike
showed up in 1997 with the death of
Princess Diana other events like the
Concorde crashed the Madrid train
bombing and the Pope&#39;s funeral all
registered on those random number
generators but early on the morning of
September 11th that data went off the
charts the odds of this being a
coincidence
is less than one in 100 billion this
shows there is a deep relationship
between collective consciousness and the
physical world sociology studies of
meditators where they go into a
community say you have a town of 200
thousand people and they would send in 1
percent of the population equivalent to
thousand people to go into deep
meditation and they found that emergency
room visits decline violent crimes
declined robberies all kinds of negative
behaviors declined even though those
people didn&#39;t even know they were in the
city because there is this resonant
effect through the force if you want to
look at it that way through this
entangled inter woven consciousness
field and people who didn&#39;t even know
these meditators were there became more
ordered more peaceful more happy etc and
so on this was actually based on the
studies done in quantum physics in which
a container of helium was cooled down to
absolute zero when only 1% of the helium
became a line to go herand the entire
container went through a phase
transition instantly shifting into
coherence and taking on almost magical
properties a state called super fluidity
so there was this transformation at that
1% point when a critical mass of people
on the whether it&#39;s 1% or a fraction of
that depends on the state of
consciousness of those who are
practicing the meditation or a prayer or
coherence but at that point you can
shift an entire civilization if we all
become coherent just 1 percent of us
like a molecule of helium and we become
a line in coherent and move in the right
direction it will transform the other
99% even though they don&#39;t know that
we&#39;re doing it and that&#39;s the beauty and
the power of the structure of
nonlocality in consciousness is that
it&#39;s all interwoven but there&#39;s enormous
power when you&#39;re operating at that
deeper level of consciousness and
that the intelligence community is very
much afraid of because that&#39;s something
a they cannot control and be it would
transcend their ability to alter the
outcome the total number of minds in the
universe is one in fact consciousness is
a singularity phasing within all beings

let&#39;s go out into space and look at our
planet world wars weapons of mass
destruction going into space in a
competitive way with Soviet Union
degradation and destruction of our
environment our targeting of
extraterrestrial assets around the earth
and in space and successfully killing
many ETS and downing their spacecraft
the New York Times revealed the
existence of a secret government program
to investigate UFO sighting I have put a
briefing together for every president
since Bill Clinton this is the next big
thing that they want the public to be
afraid of
the national security state we&#39;re
constantly spinning this story that this
is a threat we must have American
dominance in space a concerted effort
between mainstream media social media
platforms and tech giants to say let&#39;s
gain control back of the narratives that
we require I think this is a national
security imperative we need to do things
so that the public will accept in blood
and treasure the sacrifice is needed to
have an interplanetary war unquote
we went out to Oracle and sure enough I
mean we did these protocols and you know
things started to appear it just
appeared it&#39;s got on the radar the
intelligence community and they knew
that we had come across the Rosetta
Stone of contacting and communicating
with interstellar civilizations and it
worked that is what started the
intelligence community coming after what
we were saying and doing and trying to
intercept it this is in fact cosmic
disobedience on a grand scale we&#39;re
gonna bypass this sociopaths in these
covert programs and do this directly
