 This was a product of the New Life Centre / New Education University Centre in London, a New Thought venture of Orlando Edgar Miller and Paul Tyner.  The Centre featured regular services on Sundays, with talks by the principals.  The journal was very high-toned and intellectual in its approach and seems not to have prospered.  Contributions by a host of minor English New Thought figures and by Mabel Gifford Shine, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and others.  In addition to the Centre, Miller had a Healing Home business and the Miller Institute, a New Thought sanitarium -- and probably house of assignation.  Miller was in Wormwood Scrubs for manslaughter from October 1914 to January 1915, during which interlude the journal was probably edited by Paul Tyner, a frequent contributor.  On Miller and his exploits, see the notes under Psychological Review of Reviews and Chapala Round Table.   NYPL; University of Cambridge.
