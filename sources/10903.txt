She was resuscitated in a hospital setting using a defibrillator, after being gone for at least four minutes.  A few months after being released from the hospital, she told our 12 year old daughter, 'I'm all better now.'  Our older daughter responded with, 'You are?  How do you know that?'  Our 2 year-old said, 'God told me.'  A few weeks later, we were sitting around the campfire as a family, roasting marshmallows, when our daughter told us, 'God came to see me when I was at the hospital.  He carried me up to the sky when the doctors were putting something on me.  He told me I was all better now and took me back to the hospital.'  She was very upset that she had to return to the hospital.  She really wanted to go.  We asked her what God looks like, and her answer was, 'Nothing'.  Later, she asked us who was holding her in the 'cradle' at the hospital (her word for the crib in the Intensive Care Unit at Children's Hospital).  We told her nobody was since it was too small for us to get in with her.  She claimed somebody was in there with her, and they were wearing yellow.  She has not spoken about this since that time.
