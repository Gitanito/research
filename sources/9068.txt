On the third day, the pain moved to my shoulders and I had trouble breathing. I was sitting on the couch and all of a sudden I was no longer in my house I was standing on this side walk looking into this very bright light but the light did not blind me. I was not walking towards the light I just stood there. An older man walked past me slowly. There was no sound it was completely quiet. I had the strongest feeling of loneliness. I was back in my house again and I knew it was serious so I called 911 to get help. I made it to the hospital. The doctor told me I had three blockages and only thirty percent of my heart was working. I was on the verge of death.
