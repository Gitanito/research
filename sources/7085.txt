He made a close study of psychic phenomena, seeking to understand it through Jungian concepts.

James Fleming McHarg graduated in medicine at Edinburgh University in 1940 and then served in the Royal Navy, reaching the rank of surgeon commander. He trained at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and was the deputy physician superintendent at the Gartnavel Royal Hospital in Glasgow. His final post was that of consultant and honorary senior lecturer in the department of psychiatry of Dundee University.

McHarg was an elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and a foundation fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1971. He was the founder of the McHarg Essay Prize, awarded to a trainee psychiatrist who had produced an outstanding research paper. &nbsp;  Psychical Research

In his later years McHarg sought to understand the psychic experiences reported by some of his patients.1 He joined the Society for Psychical Research, serving on its governing council, and the (American) Parapsychological Association, and contributing articles to the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research and other journals (see list below).

In an article about the paranormal and the recognition of personal distress2 McHarg explores both genuine and pseudo psi phenomena that might arise from ‘pre-existing psychotic, psychoneurotic, or physiological pathologies’. &nbsp;Here he mentions the writings of Hughlings Jackson, Henry James and cases of near-death experience. He further discusses the contribution of psychiatry to psychical research in a book published to mark the centenary of the founding of the SPR.3  Selected Works  Articles
