11. The rem
ote antiquity of this m
ode of
conveying know
ledge by sym
bols, and its
long-establishedappropriationtoreligioussub
jects, had given it a character of sanctity
unknow
ntoanyotherm
odeofwriting; andit
seem
s to have beenaverygenerallyreceived
opinion, araoug the m
ore discreet H
eathens,
that divine truth w
as better adapted to the

an intellect, w
hen veiled
undersym

a,
than w
hen exhibited in the undisguised sim

losophy.1
12. Theart of conveyingideas tothesight
haspassedthroughfour different stages in its
progress to perfection. In the first, the ob
jects and events m
eant to be signified, w
ere
sim
plyrepresented: inthe second, som
epar
ticularcharacteristic qualityof the individual
w
asem
ployedtoexpressa general quality or
abstractidea; asahorse for sw
iftness, a dog
for vigilance, or a hare for fecundity: inthe
third, signs of convention w
ere contrivedto
represent ideas, as is now practised by the
Chinese: and, in the fourth, sim
ilar signsof
conventionw
ereadoptedtorepresent the dif
ferent m
odificationsof toneinthevoice; and
itsvariousdivisions, by articulation, into dis
tinct portions or syllables. This is what w
e
call alphabetic writing; w
hich is m
uch m
ore
clearandsim
ple than any other; the m
odifi
cations of tone by the organs of the m
outh,
being m
uch less various, and m
ore distinct,
than the m
odifications of ideas by the ope
rations of the m
ind. The second, how
ever,
w
hich,fromitsuseam
ongthe^Egyptians, has
been denom
inated the hieroglyphical m
odeof

who dwelt concealed in the em

inary
itself as the generator and nourisher
of all things, the ruler of the world,
the first of the deities, and the
supreme Lord of all mutable or
perishable being.8 Not that they, any
m

considered m
erely as a m

which the pervading Spirit, the original pro

andtheother, anim

the^Egyptians addedathird, by personifying

tiesof particular anim

garded, not onlyassym

butasactual em

consubstantial with his essence, and parti
cipating in his attributes.8 For this reason,
thesym

andveneration, than if theyhad been m

signs and characters of convention; and, in
som

ere even substituted as ob

64. Such seem
s to have'been the case in
./Egypt; w
here various kinds of anim

evenplants,received divine honors; concern
ing w
hichm

cient and m
odem tim

covered. The ./Egyptians them

never reveal any thing concerning them

long as they had any thing to reveal, unless
-undertheusualtiesof secrecy; w
hereforeHe
rodotus, w
ho w
as initiated, and consequently
understood them
j’declines entering into the
subject, andapologisesforthelittlewhich the
general plan of his w
ork has obliged himto
say.9 In the tim
e of D
iodorus Siculus the
priestspretendedtohave som
esecret concern

m
ore science than they really possessed, in
this, asw
ell asinotherinstances: forStrabo,
w
ho w
as contem

iodorus, and
m
uch superior to himin learning,judgm
ent,
and sagacity, says that they w
ere m
ere sacri-
ficersw
ithout any know
ledge of their ancient
philosophy and religion.11 The sym
bolical
characters, calledHieroglyphics, continued to
beesteem
ed m
ore holyandvenerablethanthe
conventional signs for sounds: but, though
they pretended to read, and even to write
them,12 the different explanations w
hichthey
gavetodifferenttravellers,induceustosuspect
that it w
as all im
posture; andthattheknow
ledge of the ancient H
ieroglyphics,and con
sequently of the sym
bolical m

sacred anim

underthePersianandM

e
m
ay indeed safely conclude, that all w

theytold of the extensive conquests andim
m
ense em
pire of Sesostris, &
c., w
as entirely
fiction; sincePalestine m
ustfromits situation
have been am

sitions; and yet it isevident fromthe sacred
writings, that at no tim

i
gration to their captivity, w
ere the ancient

ebrew
s subject to the kings of /Egypt;
w
hose vast resources were not derived from
foreign conquests, but froma river, soil, and
clim
ate,whichenabledthe laborof fewtofind
food for m

contrived to im
pose,in m
any instances,upon
Plutarch, A

acrobius, as their
ancient creed; and to this Iam
blichus at
tem
ptedtoadapt their ancient allegories, and
H
erm

hich they very readily ex
plain, thoughtheir explanations arew

wondered at, w

e consider the m
anyre

66. It is probable that in /Egypt, as in

ong the vulgar, the

Heathenism. “Theshepherd,”'says M

Tyrius, “honors Pan byconsecrating to him

73. The sanctity, so generallyattributed to
groves bythe barbarians of the North, seem
s
tohavebeenim
perfectlytransm

to the Greeks; for the poets, as Strabo ob
serves, call any sacred place a grove,though
entirely destituteoftrees;13 sothattheym

81. This m
ode of prediction seem
s tohave
been originally Chaldaean, and to have been
brought from Babylon bythe G
reekstogether
with the little astronom
y that they knew:7
8
but the C
lialdseans continued to bethegreat
practitioners of it; and byexciting thehopes
of aspiring individuals, orthefears ofjealous
tyrants,contrived to m
akethem
selves of m
is
chievous im
portance in the Rom
an em
pire;9
theprinciplesof theirpretendedsciencebeing
sufficiently specious to obtain credit, w
hen
every other of the kind had been exploded.
The Greeks do not seem ever to have paid
m
uchattentiontoit, nor, indeed, toanym
ode
ofpredictionafterthedeclineoftheiroracles:10
1
1
neitherisit ever m

ong the super

creed certainly adm
itted the principle upon
which it is founded.11 It issaidtohave been
believed by only a certain sect am
ong the
Chaldseans;12 thegeneral systemof w
hosere
ligion seem
s to have been the sam
easthatof
m
ostothernationsofthenorthernhem
isphere;
and to have taught the existence of an uni
versal pervading Spirit, w
hose subordinate
em
anations diffused them
selves through the
world,13 and presentedthem
selves in different
places, ranks, and offices,to the adoration of
men; w
ho, by their m
ediation, w
ere enabled
to approach the otherw
ise inaccessible light
ofthesuprem
eandineffableFirst Cause.14
82. Like the G
reeks, they honored these
subordinate em
anations, and gavethemnam
es

suchasM
ichael, Raphael, Uriel,Gabriel,&c.;
w
hich the Jews having adopted during the
captivity, and afterw

, they have still retained their

Jews: for as the true Creator had conde

God, theynaturallyabhorredall pretendersto

83. At Babylon, as in other countries, the
attribute w
as divided into two distinct per

the latter producedasthe work of Zoroaster;
hutwhich is inrealitynothing m

it should have im

astonishing; asit is m
anifestly a com
pilation
of noearlierdatethantheeighthorninth cen
turyofChristianity, andprobablym
uchlater.
94. The Greeksseemoriginallytohaveper
form
edtheir acts of devotion to the astherial
Spirit uponhighmountains; fromwhich new
titles, and consequently new personifications,
w
ere derived; such as those of Olym
pian,
D

w

hich w

,
as m
ere sym

an
error to console hum
an w

the Rom

form
seitherof m

6 nor
hadthe G
erm
ans, evenin the age of Tacitus,
renouncedtheirprim
itiveprejudices,oradopted
anyof therefinem
ents of their neighbours on
thissubject.
95. In som
e instances, the circular area
abovem
entionedisinclosed in a square one;
andw
eare told that a square stone w
as the
prim

and ancient Arabians.7 Upon m

96. In these square areas, upon different
coins alm

goddess, represented by this form
, acquired
thesingulartitlesof the Place ofthe Gods,9
and the Mundane House of Horus.10

ThesetitlesarebothEgyptian: but thelatter

elem
entary worship, to which Neptune be*
longed.
.101. It is observed byD
ionysius the geo*
grapher, that Bacchus w
as worshipped with
peculiar zeal and devotion by the ancient
inhabitants of som
e of the sm
aller British
islands;*4 w
herethewomen, crowned with
ivy, celebrated his clamorous noctur
nal rites upon the shores of theNorth
ern Ocean, in the same manner as the
Thracians did upon the banks of the
Apsinthus, or the Indians upon those
of the Ganges.*s InStukeley’sItineraryis
the ground-planof anancient CelticorScandi
naviantemple, foundinZealand, consistingofa
circleofrudestoneswithinasquare: andit is
probable that m
any others of these circles
were originally enclosed in square areas.
Stonehenge is the m
ost important m
onum
ent
of thiskindnowextant; and froma passage
of H
ecatasus, preserved by D
iodorusSiculus,
it seem
stohave beennot wholly unknow
n to
that ancient historian; w
ho m
ight have col
lected som
e vague accounts of the British
islandsfrom the Phoenician and Carthaginian
m
erchants, w
hotradedthere for tin. “ The
Hyperboreans,” said he, “ inhabit an
island beyond Gaul, in which Apollo
is worshipped in a circular temple
considerable for its size and riches.”
This island can be no otherthanBritain; in
whichw
eknowof no tracesof anyothercir
cular tem
ple, whichcould haveappearedcon
siderabletoaGreekor Phoenicianof that age.
Thattheaccountshould be im
perfect and ob
scureisnot surprising; since even the m
ost
inquisitiveandcredulous travellers am
ong the
Greekscouldscarcelyobtainsufficientinform
a
tionconcerning the British islands to satisfy
them of their existence.*6 A tem

EuxineSeanearthecoastofthe Am

102. The large obelisks of stone found in
m
any parts of the North, such as those at
Rudstone and near Boroughbridge in Y
ork
shire, belongedtothesam
ereligion: obelisks,
as Pliny observes, being sacred to the Sun;
w
hoseraysthey signified both by their form
and nam

of the Nile; and thesewaters, as before ob
served, werecalled the defluxion of Osi
ris, of whom the soul w
as supposed tobean
emanation. The m
eans, therefore, bywhich
they w
ere purified from all grosser m
atter,-
might properly be em
ployedasthe sym
bol of
that pow
er,which separatedthe retherial from
theterrestrial soul, andpurified it fromall the
pollutions and incum
brancesof corporeal sub
stance. Theabsurdtaleof Canobusbeingthe
deified Pilate of M
enelaus is an inventionof
the later Greeks, unworthy of any serious
notice.
166. The riteof Ablution infireandw
ater,
sogenerallypractisedam
ongalm
ostallnations
of antiquity, seem
s to have beenam
ystic re
presentation of thispurification andregenera
tionof the soul after death. Itw
as perform
ed
byjumping three tim
esthroughtheflam
eof a
sacred fire, and being sprinkled w
ith water
from a branch of laurel;2 or else by being
bedewedwith the vapor fromasacredbrand,
taken flam
ing from the altar and dipped in
water.3 The exileat hisreturn, and thebride
at her marriage, went through cerem
onies of
this kindtosignifytheir purificationandrege
neration for a newlife;4and theyappearto
havebeencom
m
onlypractised asm
odesofex
piation or extenuation for private or secret
offences.5 Asolem
nablution,too, alwayspre
cededinitiationinto the^EgyptianandEleusi-
nianmysteries;6andwhenaJewishproselyte
wasadmitted, hewasimmersedinthe presence
of threewitnesses, after beingcircumcised,but
before hewas allowedtomaketheoblationby
which he professed himself a subject of the
true God. A
s this cerem
onyw
as supposedto
wash off all stains of idolatry, thepersonim
mersed was said to be regenerated and ani
matedwith a newsoul; to preservewhich in
purity, he abandoned everyformer connexion
of country,relation, or friend.7
167. Purificationby fireisstill in useamong
the Hindoos, asit wasamong the earliest Ro
mans;8andalsoamongthenativeIrish; men,
women, and children, and even cattle, inIre
land, leaping over, orpassingthrough thesa
cred bonfires annually kindled in,honor of
Baal ;9 an ancient title of the Sun, w
hich
seem
stohaveprevailedintheN
orthernaswell
as Eastern dialects; w
hence arose the com
pound titles of theScandinavian deities, Bal-
dur,Habaldur, &
c.expressingdifferentpersoni
fied attributes.1
0 This rite w
as probably the
abom
ination, so severely reprobated by the
sacred historians of the Jews, of parents
makingtheir sons anddaughters pass
through the fire: for, in India,it is still
perform
ed by m
others passing through the
flam
es w
ith their children in their arms;1
1
andthoughcom
m
entators have construed the
expression in the Bible to m
ean the burn
ing them alive, as offerings to Baal M
oloch,
it ism
ore consonant to reason, as well as to
history, tosuppose that italludedtothism
ore
innocent m
ode of purification and conse--
cration to the Deity, which continued inuse
am
ongthe ancient inhabitants of Italyto the
laterperiodsof Heathenism; whenit w
asper
form
ed exactly as it is now in Ireland, and
held tobea holyand mystic means of com
m
unionwith thegTeat active principleof the
universe.1

168. It must,however, be admitted that the
Carthaginians and other nations of antiquity
didoccasionallysacrificetheirchildrentotheir
gods, inthemostcruel andbarbarousmanner;
and, indeed, there is scarcely any people
whose historydoesnot afford som
e instances
of such abom
inable rites. Eventhepatriarch
A
Jarabam
,when ordered to sacrifice his only
son, doesnot appear tohave beensurprisedor
startledatit; neither couldJephtha havehad
anynotionthat such sacrificesw
ere odious or
even unacceptable to theDeity, or hewould
nothave considered his daughter as included
in his general vow, or imagined thatabreach
of it in such an instance could be a greater
crim
ethanfulfillingit. Another modeofmys
tic purificationwas the Taurobolium, JEgobo-
lium, or Criobolium of the M
ithraic rites;

the planets w

different fromthat of nature, and evenfrom
that in which any theorist ever has placed
them, isdifficult torconjecture. The earliest

the third centuryof Christianity;6w
ho says
that it w

of this ingenious gentleman was drawn by
several learned writers of antiquity, from the
confusion in which the traditionsofearly times
were involved: instead of turning historyinto
mythology, they turned mythology into his
tory; and inferred that, because some of the
objects ofpublicworshiphad been mortal men,
they had all been equally So; for which pur
pose, they rejected the authority ofthe myste
ries, where the various gradations of gods,
daemons, and heroes, with all the metaphysical
distinctions of emanated, personified, and ca
nonisedbeings, were taught;1
0and, instead of
them, brought out the old allegorical genea
logies in a new dress, under pretence of their
having been transcribed fromauthentic histori
cal monuments of extreme antiquity foundin
some remote country.
