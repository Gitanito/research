The first thing I remember is being in a tunnel and looking out of a round window or opening.  I could see my husband holding me and telling me not to go, to stay, and to come back.  I didn't feel any pain.  I never turned around as I kept looking through this window.  I could see myself lying there.  I remember thinking that I needed to go back because I couldn't leave my husband.  I also remember thinking that I had to make sure that I could move my fingers and toes first to make sure I wasn't paralyzed.  When I could move them, I was instantly drawn back into my body.  Then, I felt the intense pain.  While I was in this tunnel, I felt at peace and yet scared at the same time.  My husband told me later that my eyes were open in a dead stare with no blinking, as if I was dead.  I also remember looking through the window and everything was in black, white, and gray tones.  There was no color.  I try to make sense of all of this and all I can say is that I truly had died and was gone for a short bit.
