of man. Wliat other hypothesis than that of reincarnation
gives a plan of the progress of the soul? None within
reason. W e have our choice of accepting reincarnation
which explains human progress from the gutter to the stars
or chaos.
There are a few earnest souls however, who get flashes
of their past lives, sometimes in dreams or meditating; and
when I say this I ’m not alluding to people who tell you they
were some great personage in the past. I would rather be­
lieve a man who told me he was a horse thief in the past,
than one who said he was Julius Caesar, or some great
reformer.
Reincarnation is often rejected because we cannot re­
member of having lived before. But this is not so strange,
for many of us can hardly remember things that happened i
in our youth or childhood days. The true reason why we do .
not remember is because we are living in a different body |
now, and therefore using different brains. The brains we 1
are using to-day cannot give us proof of a past existence, \
but the ego, or real self of man remembers. I f we try to ^
comprehend human evolution, we must put away the illu­
sion that the physical body is the real self. The physical l
body is no more the man, than is the coat he wears. As 1
soon as we grasp the fact that life is evolving through chang- \
ing forms, and that the form changes for the purpose of *
giving the life varied experiences. But the life is the -same \
life regardless of even the radical changs of form. i
Stop looking at your physical body as your real self, and
you will begin to understand the scheme of the cosmos. Man |
is not only living in the physical world, but he lives continu- l
ously in three worlds; i. e., the physical, emotional, and
mental worlds. It is not strange to hear people, whose con- \
sciousness is always centered in the physical side of life,
ridicule reincarnation, because they have never studied, or
tried to comprehend this great truth.
Many reject reincarnation because some ignoramus told
them they will come back as animals. This is a great error.
Once a man always a man. The knowledge we gain in life
is never lost, but if we live a purely animal life, then we are
no better than animals; and we have abundant proof of this
Bor we meet with human beings who have the characteristics
of wolves and snakes.

A certain ladv came to me and asked for an explanation
of reincarnation.* I told her, that in our evolution we pass
through the animal kingdom first, and the lower races of
m
an next. She said, that it seems plausible that she had
evolved through the lower races of man including the negro,
bu
tshe was shocked to think that she should evolve from an
anim
al.
Som
e people imagine they are so refined, the very idea of
evolving from animals shock them, yet they claim to be try­
ing to better themselves. The man who sincerely partakes
of the study of reincarnation, cannot but help see it, too, for
w
e see daily, on the streets, the young races, in the negroes
and ehinamen. Open your eyes and notice your brothers
andsisters. Look at those above you also and you will begin
jjsee it. You cannot honestly condemn what you have
heard from another, until you have studied the subject and
proven its worth. Then and not till then, may you ridicule
or condemn.
What is this hypothesis o f rein carn ation th at is a ttra ctin g
the attention o f some o f the em inent thinkers o f to-day?
What is the secret o f its v ita lity that enables it to su rvive
the ridicule o f the profan e? F o r it has been know n fro m
the very early ages o f the w orld. Jesus, taught it to liis
disciples; Pythagoras, P lato, and e v e ry reform er the w orld
has ever known, taught it. W h y ? Because it lies in the fa ct
that reincarnation is a lo gica l th eory fo r the purpose o f life
and human evolution, and it shows the d ivin e origin o f the
race, and the plan o f the cosmos b y w hich e very individu al
may better himself. I t shows man w ith an etern ity behind
as well as before him. A one sided etern ity is absurd. Im ­
mortality must include past as w ell as future, it must be
independent of time or space. A n existence that denies man
a oast must represent him as a flat creation, called suddenly
. r physical existence like a mushroom over night. But a

unreasons Me for us to believe that the physical
. e i - i ta , - - ------parents are
the creators of his soul. I f the soul existed before the hodv
was born and could reach a stage of perfection without it,
what would be the use of it entering any body at alL Now,
jf we believe our souls are im m ortal— that we exist some­
where, after we cast off our physical body, then that some­
where must be a place, th at is meant for our betterment and
progress. Can you imagine a better place than a physical
planet to better ourselves? I f there is one place above all
where men and women must learn kindness and sympathy
fo r each other, then I say, that place is this planet or an­
other, surely not in some heaven where it is not required.
Compassion, love, tolerance, we must have before we may
enter a state of bliss. Even orthodoxy agrees on this, for
they that talk about brotherly love, onlv talk, mind you,
for they do not comprehend the true significance of the real
Christ teachings. Christ said, “ Love one another/ 1hut few
o f those, who claim to be his followers, practice that to-day.
It sounds simple, but its significance is tremendous; it mem*1
to realize the one life, in all that the individual you call
your brother, and that his life and welfare should be the
same to you as your own, A little sane thinking will en­
lighten us on this subject, that humanity is one, and he who
hurts another hurts himself. F or what takes place in the
nature of humanity takes place in his own nature, for hi'*
true nature is that of the human race. Sooner or later it
must return to us, either in this life or the next, for we
cannot escape from ourselves, and this explains to us why
beggars, criminals, cripples and deformed hum',n beings
come into this world. This is the law of Divine justice: we
m ay break the law as we generally do, hut we cannot escape
it. The Jaw of reincarnation and cause and effect, gives a
man his proper place in the universe. W e see at once that
there is no injustice, that we reap precisely what we sow

r im m t for the presence of great geniuses in the human
race. How do you account fo r a Shakespeare, a Newton, or
an Edison appearing among us. The knowledge that some
cf the modem geniuses have given to the human race many
| cf us cranot even comprehend a fter it has been explained
| Vi us. Seme w ill say it is heredity. It is true we inherit
I physieel characteristics from our parents, but not mental and
j moral ones. Edison and N ew ton did not get their genius
f from their parents.
How do you account fo r Buddha and Jesus ? It is a well
| known fact that geniuses and saviors o f the world, o f today,
have parents that are hardly known. This would not be if
the theory of mental and moral heredity was sound. I f they
r, had anything to transmute we would most assuredly have
heard of them as w ell as their offspring. Whence comes this
it extraordinary aptitude fo r arts, and sciences, displayed by
many children to-day f H ow do others derive that ferocious
j instinct of vice which often is strangely in contrast with
the environment in which they were bora? How do yon
account for the intellectual giants exhibiting their marvelous
♦ knowledge,— men who can calculate the law o f eclipses, half
I a century in advance with marvelous exactitude ? Heredity
■
Y cannot explain this. Reincarnation furnishes the solution,
! if we try to see it.
These geniuses are men who have given many lives to one
‘ study, they have persistently searched for knowledge along
these lines, before they are hailed as geniuses. By no other
theory can we account for the marvelous power and knowl­
edge, that some men possess. A very close observer may
easily distinguish that the young souls are evil and impure,

then we are not required to enter any more prison house of
flesh, to chain our soul down. The knowledge we gain in
one life ls never lost. For instance i:i our childhood days
wc may meet with an accident. W hen we grow to man­
hood, we may not remember all the circumstances in which
the accident occurred, still its impression remains in the
mind. In the same manner the experience gained in one
life is not remembered in the next, but the impression they
provide, remains with the ego during its march to perfection.
The doctrines of reincarnation and transmigration of
soul begins from the remotest ages of the world. It is part
of the oldest religions known to man. Upon the tombs and
rock temples of ancient Egypt, which have withstood the
elements for thousands of years, are deeply carved pic­
tures of transmigrating souls. Sometimes Osiris is seated
on a pyramid or on an elevated throne, with human beings
ascending the stairway to him, while close at hand stands
Justice with her balance and the book with the record of
the wars— life (the astral body) placed in the scales, the
recorder standing by to take a note of it. Here, as it is pic­
tured, those who have attained the realization of self pass
away to the right, retaining human form. Those who have
not attained this sthte in human evolution pass to the left
and down the pyramid; again some with anim als’ heads
and human bodies, indicating their character, for our char­
acter shapes the astral body.
Be not amazed, then, at what I have told thee; you must
be born again.
