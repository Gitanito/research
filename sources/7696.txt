  		              		Experience Description   

    I was diagnosed with esophageal IV cancer on November 11, 2020. I felt like I was hit by a truck, and could barely function. When the doctor gave me my diagnosis, they asked if I wanted to know my prognosis, and how much time they thought I had left. I recall telling the doctor that I do not accept that I have stage IV cancer, and then I don’t want to know the statistics. I can tell everybody thought that I was losing it, but were okay with me processing on my own timeline. With esophageal cancer at a late stage, you generally have a large mass in your esophagus, as did I, and it restricts swallowing and eating. My mass was so large, I was unable to keep anything down, and I was losing weight. The doctors recommend a medical stent be surgically placed in my orifice, to make room for swallowing food. I resisted at first, and was trying to figure out another way. I kept losing weight and not eating, and was terrified that I would starve to death. I was told that I either had to do the stent, or get a feeding tube. I chose the stent.  

  I made my appointment for the surgery, and remember being wheeled in to the surgery room and being put under anesthesia. I woke up feeling horrible, in a massive amount of pain. They told me that that was normal, and that they would surveil me for 24 hours. The rule was that I had to eat before being released. I ended up in the hospital for almost a week, terribly sick and not being able to eat anything. During that time, I was throwing up constantly and on a massive amount of pain medication and other medications for nausea, etc.  

  At some point, I remember leaving my body and being in another realm. There was no fear, anxiety, or stress. As you recall, I’m pretty much traumatized at this point, and pretty confident that I am almost dead. I was terrified until I left my body. Once I was up there, I remember feeling like I was wrapped in a love in a way I’ve never felt love in my life. I’ve explained it as feeling like I was in a womb. I could feel a presence near me, and I remember seeing a light. It felt like three or four days of me telepathically communicating to the presence. I was begging and pleading to be able to stay on Earth, so that I could be there for my daughter and my mother. I’m a single mom, and my daughter has cried to me about being scared of being an orphan. My mother is 70, and was not taking the news well. I just remember pleading and begging for days. I made all of these promises that I would change my life, not do drugs, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, etc. After what felt like days, the presence agreed to let me stay. I remember being so happy with myself.  

  My job before getting sick was in sales, and it felt like had I closed the biggest sale of my life. This turned out to be accurate. I was elated. In the midst of my excitement, the presence telepathically said 'But, if you go back, life will not be easy.' I was so excited about closing the deal, I didn’t really pay much attention to things not being easy.  

  Next thing I know, I’m back in the hospital bed and feeling pretty bad and sick. At the time, I thought that I was hallucinating due to starvation. I was released from the hospital a few days later and I went home feeling terrible. A few weeks later I started improving, and I was able to eat food again. I thought that this was due to the stent that had been placed during surgery and I was healing well. Therefore, I was able to eat again. On December 31, 2020. I could not stop throwing up and I felt terrible. I called the doctor and they wanted me to take my temperature, I took it, and it was over 101. They told me I needed to go to the emergency room immediately, as I could have an infection that could be deadly, due to the chemo. I remember crying all the way there, and being so dismayed that I would be spending my New Year’s Eve in the emergency room during Covid. I had to wait eight hours to be seen. By the time I got to be seen by a doctor, I had pretty much given up on life, and was ready to just die. They did all of those tests, and all my numbers were coming back normal. I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. They x-rayed my abdomen and chest, and found that the stent had migrated to my stomach. I was told that stents take years to migrate, if ever. I was also told that they migrate when the tumor shrinks.  
  
  I did’t know what to think at this point, but I knew that I could still eat food, and that the stent was no longer in my esophagus. I went to the doctor the following Monday after the holiday, and was told that the tumor shrank, and that my tumor marker bloodwork had went from 1500 to 230. It was such a drastic drop, that the lab tested it multiple times. The doctor set up an appointment for an endoscopy to remove the stent from my stomach. At that appointment, I just had a feeling that the cancer was fully gone, and I felt almost back to my original health, or even better. That is when I felt without a shadow of a doubt that the God experience was real. I also felt like I was watching a miracle in process, and feeling it. I told the doctor before he stuck the camera down my throat that he wouldn’t find a tumor, and that it would be gone.  

  He looked at me like I was out of my mind, as he was the doctor that originally gave me the endoscopy and saw how large my 4 cm tumor was. After the endoscopy I asked him how did it look, how much tumor did he see? He said that it looked like it was about 80 to 90% gone. I got the photos and follow up notes the next day. On that paperwork the picture showed no visible tumor, and it was confirmed in the notes that the previously seen mass was no longer visible. In my head, I felt like I was cancer free.  

  There’s so much more to the story, but long story short, they gave me a scan weeks later.  It showed that I still had metastasized cancer in my chest, and that I had cancer in the lymph nodes around the original tumor. The doctor said I was still stage four, and the goal was to prolong my life. I continued on chemo until April, and after that I had so many people treating me horribly due to me talking about this God experience, and calling me crazy, that I had to leave the state and get out of Seattle. I just continued chemo and went to Puerto Rico for six weeks.  I went on a spiritual awakening retreat alone, and took care of myself. I completely changed my diet, radically changed my mindset, and knew without a shadow of a doubt that I would be cancer free. I had complete faith that God would not do just one miracle for you, and not finish the job. When I returned from Puerto Rico, I was cancer free.

    I have now been cancer free since May 28, 2021. I’ve had two follow up scans since then. There’s a lot more details, but that’s the gist of the actual experience.
