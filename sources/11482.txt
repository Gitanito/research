  		              		Experience Description   

    Myself and another kid where playing in a garage that also had an old refrigerator inside of it. I do not remember the details of how we ended up inside the fridge. But I do clearly remember being trapped inside of it. I don't remember being scared, rather I was just falling asleep. For whatever reason, I thought I was at a shopping mall with my mom and the details of being in the mall are quite clear. Memories of being taken out of the fridge aren't too clear, but I do remember hearing voices either asking. 'Is he breathing?' or saying, 'He isn't breathing.' As I was  carried out of the garage,  I slowly started seeing what was going on around me. I saw the car ride to the hospital. I remember seeing the dash of the car and the buildings on the way to the hospital. 

  Back in those days kids never wore seatbelts, so I always rode in the car standing on the hump in the floor between the driver and passenger seat. It was as if I was standing in that spot, but I really wasn't. 

  I have no memory going into the hospital other than being above an operating table and everything around me being dark. I heard a doctor saying my name and slapping me. Then I was on the table looking up at a doctor with a mask and bright surgical light above me.  I don't have any memories after that. 

  I think I forgot the whole experience until I was 6 or 7 years old. I was looking through the top drawer of my mom's dresser trying to find spare change to go to the store. There were packages of photos and my mom's ID, birth certificates, and other important papers. When I was looking through them, I found a newspaper clipping of the day I was in the fridge. I saw my name in the article. I'm not sure why I forgot everything until I saw the news clipping, but then everything started coming back to be. I never said I found the clipping, but I once brought it up to my dad a few years later. He told me not to talk about it and never say anything about it around my mom. I don't know the details of how I finally had my mom talk about it but I was in my early teens, I think. All she said was that I was not the same person afterwards. I didn't like human contact as much as I did before. My personality was different but I have no idea what I was like as a person prior to the accident. I don't think my family liked me that much as a kid or adult. I never connected or bonded with anyone growing up and the reason I'm thinking about this more recently is because I'm the only one basically left alive now. Its been almost fifty years now since the incident, but still that event is vivid in my mind.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  My mom described finding me and the events going to the hospital but I never told her I remembered all of that because my dad said not too go into detail about what I experienced.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it

What is your religion now?         No comment     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     It's hard to answer many of the questions because of my age at the time  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     My family and I were never close. I can sense things about people but it is not like reading minds. My dreams sometimes are vivid and I have been chased by things but don't know what they are.  I don't die in my dreams even if I'm shot,  underwater, or fall from great heights. The dreams confuse me a lot but have also woken me up in times of an emergency.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I don't connect or bond with people very easily  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I'm just sad that I feel like I'll never know who I really was supposed to be  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     heightened awareness in many things  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Just how vivid the memory is  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Many years later I tried talking about it, but it is like people shut down around me. Or if I can sense something about a person and tell them they avoid me afterwards  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.       
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     It changed the entire course of my life. I believe because I act connected to life but feel sometimes uncertain why I'm here.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   My dreams sometimes  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I don't know. I just want to understand all of this more in my life
